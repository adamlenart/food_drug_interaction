    "0": "Patients with cardiovascular diseases are often treated by concurrent multiple drug therapy. It is therefore plausible that with an increasing number of drugs the risk of drug interactions increases. Such interactions can be either pharmacodynamic (and are due to the mechanism of the administered drugs) or they can be pharmacokinetic (resulting in a reduction or enhancement of drug elimination). Pharmacokinetic interactions can be either due to interactions at the level of drug metabolizing enzymes (most important cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes) or interactions at the level of drug transporter proteins (for example P-glycoprotein (MDR1)). It is important to distinguish between both mechanisms because interactions at transporter proteins can be attributed to those drugs that are not enzymatically metabolized. The scope of this article is to give an overview on clinically relevant interactions of the four beta-blockers widely used in the therapy of cardiovascular diseases namely atenolol (CAS 29122-68-7), bisoprolol (CAS 66722-44-9), metoprolol (CAS 37350-58-6) (each beta-1 selective), and carvedilol (CAS 72956-09-3) (beta-1 and beta-2 nonselective). Among these beta-blockers atenolol is mainly eliminated by renal excretion, bisoprolol is in part excreted as parent compound via the renal route (50%), the other 50% are hepatically metabolised, whereas metoprolol and carvedilol are metabolised by CYP2D6. In addition, evidence is accumulating that carvedilol is a substrate for P-glycoprotein. For these four beta-blockers various pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions have been demonstrated. Such interactions that result in an altered pharmacokinetics are mainly observed with those beta-blockers that are excreted via metabolism (metoprolol and carvedilol). Accordingly these drugs have a higher potential for drug interactions. However, it should be emphasized that, in general, beta-blockers are well tolerated safe drugs with a large therapeutic index.", 
    "1": "The association between chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular death is accounted for, in part, by higher rates of serious arrhythmias. Research shows an independent relationship between worsened renal function and atrial fibrillation, heart block, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and asystole. These higher rates also associate with underlying structural heart disease including left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiac fibrosis, valvular disease, and left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction. In addition, chronic intermittent ischemia is implicated in the arrhythmias observed during hemodialysis. The superimposed conditions of acidosis and fluxes in both potassium and magnesium also contribute to higher rates of arrhythmias. Baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate is linked to worsened outcomes and increased defibrillation thresholds in patients receiving implantable cardioverter defibrillators. Preventive strategies include meticulous management of electrolytes, baseline treatment for cardiovascular disease, and when indicated, implantable cardioverter defibrillators. Future research into the mechanisms and prevention of sudden cardiac death in patients with chronic kidney disease is warranted.", 
    "2": "Management of hypertension in diabetic nephropathy is challenging and generally requires a minimum of three different and complementary antihypertensive agents to achieve the recently recommended blood pressure (BP) goal of <130/80 mm Hg in order to reduce cardiovascular (CV) risk and preserve kidney function. Commonly used antihypertensive combinations include an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker, agents that have compelling indications for use in diabetic renal disease, added to a diuretic, generally a thiazide-type agent. If additional therapy is required, either a beta-blocker or calcium antagonist may be added. Beta-blockers are particularly effective in people with a high sympathetic drive, i.e. high pulse rates, to lower BP and reduce CV risk while reducing proteinuria and slowing decline of kidney function. In light of this information, it is disturbing that a recent analysis of the NHANES III database indicates that only about 11% of people with diabetic kidney disease have achieved the target BP of <130/80 mm Hg. Recent data from Denmark demonstrate that focusing on total CV risk reduction among people with diabetes, including achievement of recommended BP and lipid goals along with the use of aspirin, exercise and a proper diet, can reduce the absolute risk of a CV event by 20% over less intensive treatment.",

Recent reports have suggested that endothelial dysfunction is an important target for future therapies of heart failure. However, whether NE can induce endothelial apoptosis and its mechanism remains unknown.", 
    "4": "Endothelial cells from neonatal rat heart were treated with various concentrations of NE for different durations. Apoptosis was assessed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end-labeling (TUNEL) and DNA fragmentation assays. Caspase activity was measured using specific fluorogenic substrates. Proteins of Bcl-2 family and cytochrome c were assayed by Western blotting.", 
    "5": "NE induced endothelial apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. After treatment for 48 h, increasing NE concentration from 5, 10, 50, 100 to 200 microM resulted in 6+/-3%, 14+/-5%, 43+/-4%, 66+/-5%, and 89+/-6% apoptotic cells, respectively. The apoptosis was accompanied by down-regulation of Bcl-2 protein synthesis but not by cytosolic cytochrome c translocation. Caspase-2, -3, -6 and -9 were activated during apoptosis and caspase-2 inhibitor (Z-VDVAD-FMK) and caspase-3 inhibitor (Z-DEVD-FMK) significantly attenuated the apoptosis. Overexpression of Bcl-2 inhibited caspase activity and decreased the apoptosis. Moreover, the NE-mediated apoptotic effect was attenuated by beta- (beta2>beta>beta1) adrenergic antagonists (ICI-118,551>propranolol>atenolol) but was not affected by alpha1- or alpha2-adrenergic antagonists (prazosin or yohimbine).",

The choice of the most appropriate method of electrocardiogram (ECG) acquisition and QT/RR interval measurement in clinical trials requires better understanding of the differences among currently available approaches. This study compared standard and Holter-derived 12-lead ECGs for utility in detecting sotalol-induced QT/QTc and RR changes. Manual methods (digitizing pad and digital on-screen calipers) were compared for precision of QT and RR interval measurement.",

Holter-derived and standard ECGs produced nearly identical sotalol-induced QT/QTc and RR changes from baseline, as did the manual digipad and on-screen caliper measurements. The variability of on-screen QT measurement in this study was greater than that of digipad.",

Among those who did not achieve target BP, 70 (34.5%) lacked systolic BP control (BP = 153 +/- 17/79 +/- 3 mmHg), four (2%) lacked diastolic BP control (BP = 123 +/- 3/86 +/- 3 mmHg) and 109 (53.7%) lacked both systolic and diastolic BP control (BP = 158 +/- 20/94 +/- 7 mmHg). The mean age of the group achieving target BP was significantly lower than the group which lacked systolic BP control (51.6 +/- 9 vs. 63.5 +/- 9 years; P < 0.0001). While there were no significant differences in fasting blood glucose, glycosylated haemoglobin, triglycerides, urea, creatinine, uric acid and serum electrolytes between the group achieving target BP vs. groups without target BP, a significant difference in total cholesterol was seen.",

Antihypertensive monotherapy was prescribed in 145 (54.5%) patients, whereas two- and three-drug combinations were prescribed in 32.3 and 8.2% of patients, respectively. As monotherapy, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were the most frequently prescribed drugs followed by beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and diuretics. As two-drug combinations, an ACE inhibitor with a beta-blocker/diuretic and a beta-blocker with a CCB/diuretic were usually prescribed.",

    "15": "Although many beta1-receptor antagonists and beta2-receptor agonists have been used in pharmacotherapy for many years their pharmacological properties at all three known subtypes of beta-adrenergic receptors are not always well characterized. The aim of this study was, therefore, to provide comparative binding characteristics of agonists (epinephrine, norepinephrine, isoproterenol, fenoterol, salbutamol, salmeterol, terbutalin, formoterol, broxaterol) and antagonists (propranolol, alprenolol, atenolol, metoprolol, bisoprolol, carvedilol, pindolol, BRL 37344, CGP 20712, SR 59230A, CGP 12177, ICI 118551) at all three subtypes of human beta-adrenergic receptors in an identical cellular background. We generated Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing the three beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes at comparable levels. We characterized these receptor subtypes and analyzed the affinity of routinely used drugs as well as experimental compounds in competition binding studies, using the non-selective antagonist 125I-cyanopindolol as a radioligand. Furthermore, we analyzed the beta-receptor-mediated adenylyl cyclase activity in isolated membranes from these cell lines. The results from our experiments show that all compounds exhibit distinct patterns of selectivity and activity at the three beta-receptor subtypes. In particular, a number of beta2- or beta3-receptor agonists that are inverse agonists at the other subtypes were identified. In addition, beta1-receptor antagonists with agonistic activity at beta2- and beta3-receptors were found. These specific mixtures of agonism, antagonism, and inverse agonism at different subtypes may have important implications for the therapeutic use of the respective compounds.", 
    "16": "Experiments were performed to investigate the influence of exercise training on cardiovascular function in mice. Heart rate, arterial pressure, baroreflex sensitivity, and autonomic control of heart rate were measured in conscious, unrestrained male C57/6J sedentary (n = 8) and trained mice (n = 8). The exercise training protocol used a treadmill (1 h/day; 5 days/wk for 4 wk). Baroreflex sensitivity was evaluated by the tachycardic and bradycardic responses induced by sodium nitroprusside and phenylephrine, respectively. Autonomic control of heart rate and intrinsic heart rate were determined by use of methylatropine and propranolol. Resting bradycardia was observed in trained mice compared with sedentary animals [485 +/- 9 vs. 612 +/- 5 beats/min (bpm)], whereas mean arterial pressure was not different between the groups (106 +/- 2 vs. 108 +/- 3 mmHg). Baroreflex-mediated tachycardia was significantly enhanced in the trained group (6.97 +/- 0.97 vs. 1.6 +/- 0.21 bpm/mmHg, trained vs. sedentary), whereas baroreflex-mediated bradycardia was not altered by training. The tachycardia induced by methylatropine was significantly increased in trained animals (139 +/- 12 vs. 40 +/- 9 bpm, trained vs. sedentary), whereas the propranolol effect was significantly reduced in the trained group (49 +/- 11 vs. 97 +/- 11 bpm, trained vs. sedentary). Intrinsic heart rate was similar between groups. In conclusion, dynamic exercise training in mice induced a resting bradycardia and an improvement in baroreflex-mediated tachycardia. These changes are likely related to an increased vagal and decreased sympathetic tone, similar to the exercise response observed in humans.",

    "18": "Eighty-four patients with systolic dysfunction had two measurements of BNP with an interval of 8 to 12 months and were followed in order to register the occurrence of death. The study was observational and prospectively designed. During follow-up, patients were treated according to state of the art. Physicians were kept blind to BNP levels.", 
    "19": "The median follow-up was 1190 days. The median initial BNP level was 260.4 pg/ml and decreased to 123 pg/ml in the second measurement (P=0.001). The decrease in BNP was significantly associated with ACE-i dosage and with the use of a beta-blocker. All-cause mortality was 20.2%. Patients whose initial BNP level was above the median had a significantly higher hazard of dying (HR 2.96, 95% CI 1.06-8.26). The same was observed for those whose BNP increased between the first and the second measurement (HR 2.64, 95% CI 1.00-7.00). In multivariable analysis, baseline BNP above the median and increasing BNP were associated with shorter survival.", 
    "20": "Higher baseline BNP and the increasing levels during follow-up were independently associated with mortality. The decrease in BNP levels was proportional to ACE-i dosage and larger among patients on beta-blockers. These results confirm the prognostic information provided by BNP determination and suggest that serial measurements give additional prognostic information.", 
    "21": "Based on its proposed ability to block the effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) on the firing rate of serotonergic neurons, the 5-HT1A partial agonist/beta-adrenergic antagonist pindolol has been examined in clinical trials for its ability to enhance the efficacy of SSRIs. However, varying results have been obtained in these clinical trials. To explore this issue, we examined the effects of pindolol alone and in combination with fluoxetine on the electrophysiological activity of serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus of anesthetized rats. Administration of pindolol (1, 5, and 20 mg/kg, s.c.) alone decreased the number of spontaneously active serotonergic neurons. Administration of fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) alone also decreased the number of spontaneously active serotonergic neurons. However, when administered following fluoxetine, pindolol significantly attenuated, but did not block completely, the inhibitory effects of fluoxetine on the number of spontaneously active serotonergic neurons. These results indicate that pindolol can attenuate the effects of fluoxetine on the firing of serotonergic neurons. These results may help explain the varying efficacy of pindolol in clinical trials with SSRIs.",

    "29": "Chronic heart failure (CHF) in children occurs mostly as a result of systolic dysfunction of the systemic ventricle or of congenital defects leading to large left-to-right shunts and pulmonary overcirculation. The ensuing symptoms and signs are similar in both cases, and include respiratory distress, poor feeding and growth, and hepatic congestion. Grading the severity of the symptoms accurately and reproducibly is important for studying CHF and the response to therapy. The Ross classification for young children and the New York Heart Association classification for older children are frequently utilized for such grading. The standard therapy for CHF in children consists of diuretics, to reduce cardiac preload and improve symptoms, and the maximization of nutritional support. The role of digoxin in treating CHF in children is controversial, especially regarding those children with pulmonary overcirculation where the function of the systemic ventricle is usually well preserved. As the importance of neurohormonal changes in the pathogenesis of worsening CHF is elucidated, newer medications aimed at counteracting such changes are becoming more important in the medical therapy of CHF in children. ACE inhibitors improve function and survival in adults with CHF, and they probably do the same in children with systemic ventricular dysfunction. It is less clear how effective they are in pulmonary overcirculation, but patients with high flow and low pulmonary resistance are most likely to benefit. In infants receiving treatment with ACE inhibitors, it is necessary to monitor for renal insufficiency or renal failure. beta-Adrenoceptor blockade has also been established as an effective therapy for adults with CHF with beneficial effects on survival and left ventricular function. While data for the pediatric population are limited, early studies suggest that beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers) may work well in infants and children with CHF. Caution must be used by starting treatment with very low dosages of beta-blockers and gradually increasing to the desired goals with close monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate. It is clear that larger multicenter trials are crucial to our ability to provide the most appropriate treatment for children with CHF. The demand for effective medical treatment will increase as more patients with palliated single ventricles survive surgery and then develop CHF from dysfunction of a hypertrophic and dilated single ventricle.", 
    "30": "Controlled clinical trials performed in more than 13 000 patients have, to date, consistently shown the beneficial effects of long term beta-adrenoceptor antagonist (beta-blocker) therapy in patients with chronic heart failure. It is not clear whether this represents a class effect or whether it is specific only to some agents. Beneficial effects on the prognosis of patients with mild to moderate heart failure have been shown with metoprolol, bisoprolol, and carvedilol. These beta-blockers, however, differ in their pharmacologic characteristics. Metoprolol and bisoprolol are selective for beta(1)-adrenergic receptors and are devoid of ancillary properties. Carvedilol, at a dosage of 50 mg/day, blocks all beta(1)-, beta(2)-, and alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors, and it has associated antiproliferative and antioxidant activities. These differences cause a varied acute hemodynamic response, with a reduction in cardiac output and a tendency toward a rise in pulmonary wedge pressure with selective agents and no change in cardiac output and a slight decrease in pulmonary pressures with carvedilol. Accordingly, when the therapy is started, the most frequent adverse effects are worsening heart failure with metoprolol and bisoprolol, and hypotension and dizziness with carvedilol. It remains controversial whether these differences also influence the long term effects of therapy. Carvedilol may provide a more comprehensive blockade of the cardiac adrenergic drive than selective beta-blockers because it does not upregulate beta(1)-adrenergic receptors, blocks all adrenergic receptors and decreases cardiac norepinephrine release. These properties may lead to a larger increase in left ventricular function and a lack of improvement in maximal exercise capacity with carvedilol, compared with selective beta-blockers. It is, however, unclear whether these differences also influence patient outcome. The long term effects of different beta-blockers on prognosis are currently being compared in the Carvedilol or Metoprolol European Trial (COMET) in which more than 3000 patients with chronic heart failure have been randomized in a 1 : 1 ratio to receive metoprolol or carvedilol.", 
    "31": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most commonly encountered sustained arrhythmia. Heart rate control, reduction of symptoms, and prevention of embolism are major goals of treatment. Whether the strategy of cardioversion with subsequent maintenance of sinus rhythm has an advantage over heart rate control is under active investigation. Digoxin, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists, beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers), and amiodarone are the pharmacologic agents most commonly used to achieve rate control. In patients with drug-resistant AF, atrioventricular nodal ablation (or modification) with implantation of a permanent pacemaker is an alternative therapy. Conversion to sinus rhythm can best be achieved by electrical cardioversion. In selected patients, pharmacologic cardioversion can also be attempted. The use of antiarrhythmic drugs for the maintenance of sinus rhythm depends on several factors: (i) the nature of the arrhythmia (first attack, paroxysmal AF with frequent attacks, paroxysmal AF with infrequent attacks, or persistent AF); (ii) the associated symptoms; (iii) and the risk of severe adverse effects associated with the chosen drug. If the administration of an antiarrhythmic drug is appropriate, the choice of the drug must be tailored to the specific characteristics of the given patient. In lone AF, class Ic antiarrhythmic drugs are the best tolerated. These agents should be combined with a calcium channel antagonist or a beta-blocker to prevent rapid ventricular response in the case of conversion of AF to atrial flutter. In this situation, catheter ablation of atrial flutter at the isthmus (hybrid therapy) should be performed. All class I antiarrhythmic agents should be avoided in patients with structural heart disease. Alternative approaches that may be used if sinus rhythm cannot be maintained with drug therapy include: (i) the ablation of arrhythmogenic pulmonary veins; (ii) the implantation of an atrial defibrillator; (iii) the use of specific pacing sites; (iv) or pacing modes. Whether these approaches will reach clinical relevance merits further investigation. Intraoperative catheter ablation or surgical ablation (maze procedure) seems a promising approach for curing AF in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Among all of the available treatment options, the most consistent proof of efficacy in reducing mortality and morbidity from AF exists for antithrombotic treatment.", 
    "32": "Ventricular arrhythmias (VA) have been associated with mortality in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM). All 3 main mechanisms of arrhythmogenesis - reentry, trigger activity, and automatism - have been implicated. Arrhythmogenic substrates in IDCM favor these mechanisms and are often potentiated by electrolyte imbalance secondary to diuretic treatment, by antiarrhythmic drugs, or by bradycardia, leading to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT). Myocardial macroreentry is the mechanism most frequently responsible for monomorphic VT in IDCM; however, focal activation and His-Purkinje macroreentry are often responsible and, especially in the latter case, are frequently unrecognized. Clinical suspicion and final recognition by electrophysiologic testing have important therapeutic consequences, because both focal activation and His-Purkinje macroreentry can be treated effectively by catheter ablation. On the other hand, the frequent recurrences of myocardial macroreentrant VT after ablation require this therapy to be used in combination with drugs or an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). beta-Adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers) have a beneficial effect for primary prevention of VA in IDCM. Type III antiarrhythmics have a neutral effect on mortality and type I antiarrhythmics should be avoided. Treatment of nonsustained VT in IDCM is controversial because it often presents without symptoms and is linked more to overall mortality than to arrhythmic mortality. Empiric treatment with amiodarone or electrophysiologically guided sotalol are preferred to the use of other drugs for secondary prevention of sustained VA. ICDs should be implanted in patients who have been resuscitated from cardiac arrest due to VA, or in those with poorly tolerated VT and severe left ventricular dysfunction. Empiric treatment with amiodarone or electrophysiologically guided class III antiarrhythmics may also be alternatives for patients with IDCM and no severe left ventricular dysfunction, especially if VT is well tolerated.", 
    "33": "Ventricular tachyarrhythmias secondary to a variety of underlying cardiovascular problems pose a therapeutic challenge to the clinician. The initial presentation may be as sudden cardiac death, which underlies its public health problem. The underlying conditions predisposing to this arrhythmia include ischemic heart disease, dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmiogenic right ventricle dysplasia and certain postoperative states including corrective surgery for tetralogy of Fallot and valve replacement. Other causes include prolonged QT syndrome, idiopathic right and left ventricle tachycardia and bundle branch re-entry tachycardia. Ischaemic heart disease is the most common cause of ventricular tachycardia and therapy has evolved considerably over the past two decades. The development of and refinements in the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) have introduced a new dimension in therapeutic options and markedly improved survival in these patients. Insights in the dichotomy between arrhythmia suppression and total mortality have reoriented drug therapy with a decrease in the use of sodium channel blockers. beta-blockers have emerged as antiarrhythmic drugs in their own right and their synergistic effects with amiodarone have strengthened the antiarrhythmic drug arm. The role of these drugs in patients with hemodynamically stable ventricular tachycardia, especially in relatively preserved ventricles needs to be explored. Catheter ablation techniques have provided curative therapy in patients with idiopathic and bundle branch reentry tachycardia. Further advances in radiofrequency ablation, including use of newer mapping techniques, promise a greater role for ablation of ischemic ventricular tachycardia in the future. A hybrid approach consisting of drugs, catheter ablation and/ or ICD may provide effective therapeutic approach in some situations. Further innovations and technologic developments promise a further reorientation in therapy towards identification and treatment of the underlying arrhythmogenic substrate.", 
    "34": "Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This condition leads to an increased risk of premature mortality in patients with ischemic heart disease and stroke. Many risk factors besides hyperglycemia in itself contribute to this increased risk, acting in a synergistic fashion. One of the most important risk factors is hypertension. Several recent clinical trials have shown the benefits of reducing high blood pressure in patients with diabetes mellitus to lower levels than have previously been recommended in clinical guidelines. In both the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) and the Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) study a significant trend for increased benefits associated with lower diastolic blood pressure levels was shown. Therefore, clinicians should be encouraged to do more to treat hypertension in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and increase the proportion of patients in whom acceptable blood pressure control is achieved. For example, in Sweden, acceptable blood pressure control is currently only achieved in about 20 to 25% of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Recent evidence also points to the primary importance of a tight blood pressure control. This implies drug combination treatment for the majority of patients. Therefore, the clinician must be able to use a broad variety of antihypertensive drugs, and from these drugs choose alternative combinations with pharmacological synergism.", 
    "35": "Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia in the general population and is frequently associated with organic heart disease. beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (b-blockers) are very effective in preventing atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass surgery. It has been shown recently that the beta-blocker metoprolol controlled release/extended release (CR/XL) is also effective in maintaining sinus rhythm after conversion of atrial fibrillation. There is concern that class I antiarrhythmic drugs, such as quinidine, disopyramide, and flecainide in particular, may increase mortality. The risk of proarrhythmia associated with beta-blocker treatment is very low. Therefore b-blockers, such as metoprolol CR/XL, may be the first line of treatment to maintain sinus rhythm, especially after myocardial infarction and in patients with chronic heart failure and in those with arterial hypertension. In patients with persistent atrial fibrillation, AV-nodal conduction-slowing drugs, such as calcium channel antagonists and beta-blockers are used to control the ventricular rate during atrial fibrillation. Several studies clearly show that beta-blockers alone, or in combination with digoxin are very effective in controlling the ventricular rate at rest and during exercise. beta-blockers are effective in maintaining sinus rhythm and controlling the ventricular rate during atrial fibrillation. Given these effects and their favorable effects on mortality, beta-blockers should be considered as first-line agents in the management of patients with atrial fibrillation.",

However, there was no significant difference in overall mortality between the valsartan and placebo groups. Morbidity was defined as cardiac arrest with resuscitation, hospitalization for heart failure, or administration of intravenous inotropic or vasodilator drugs for > or =4 hours without hospitalization. Among patients not receiving an ACE inhibitor, irrespective of concomitant beta-blocker use, valsartan reduced the risk of mortality and the combined endpoint by 33.1% and 44% compared with placebo; total hospitalizations for heart failure were also significantly lower in the valsartan group (27.6 vs 64.6%). In the subgroup of patients who were taking an ACE inhibitor and a beta-blocker at baseline (n = 1610), mortality was significantly higher in the valsartan group than in the placebo group. The most common adverse events in the valsartan and placebo groups which led to discontinuation of treatment were dizziness, renal impairment (both of which occurred in significantly more valsartan recipients) and hypotension.", 
    "44": "Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a common disease with high associated morbidity and mortality, and the outcome appears to be worse in black compared with white patients. There is currently no clear consensus for basing the pharmacological treatment of CHF on racial differences. Most studies that have investigated the potential effects of racial differences on pharmacological responses in heart failure have been based on African Americans and white participants. Using these data, this review will discuss the current understanding of the effects of racial differences in response to pharmacotherapy in heart failure, possible mechanisms for these observed differences, and how this may impact on patient management. Diuretics have favorable symptomatic benefits in both black and white patients with heart failure with evidence of fluid retention. ACE inhibitors seem to be less effective in the treatment of black patients with heart failure compared with white patients. This may be due to low pre-existing activity of the renin-angiotensin system in blacks. The role of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in the management of all patients with heart failure is incompletely defined and there are no clear trial data to show any difference in effect between black and white patients with heart failure. There is good evidence for the use of spironolactone in all patients with heart failure, but no evidence for a different effect in black patients. Similarly, there is no conclusive data to suggest a difference in effect of digoxin in different racial groups. The evidence available would suggest that certain beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (certainly carvedilol but not bucindolol) are effective in both black and white patients with CHF. The combination of hydralazine and nitrates would appear to be particularly effective in black patients with CHF though the African American Heart Failure Trial (A-HeFT) trial should provide clearer evidence for the potentially greater beneficial effects of these two drugs in the black population. It is important to accept that racial categorization acts as only a surrogate marker for genetic or other factors responsible for individual responses to drug therapy and that any identified differences will not apply to all members of each stratified group. Nonetheless, in managing a complex, common and often fatal condition such as heart failure, recognizing potential individual differences in drug responses should enable the responsible clinician to provide a tailored and evidence-based approach to patient treatment.", 
    "45": "Atrial fibrillation in patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery is a common problem, occurring in 25-50% of patients. Older patients and those with a prior history of atrial fibrillation are at highest risk, as are those patients in whom preoperative treatment with beta-blockers has been discontinued. The immediate sequelae of this common complication include hemodynamic instability and congestive heart failure with long-term consequences including thromboembolic phenomena and increased cost and length of hospitalization. beta-Blockers, amiodarone, and sotalol have all been shown to decrease the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation, but their use may be limited by their adverse effects. Other agents have some promise as prophylactic agents, but need further verification. Biatrial pacing has been shown to be effective, especially when beta-blockers are used simultaneously. The goals for the treatment of atrial fibrillation include maintaining hemodynamic stability, controlling ventricular rate, preventing thromboembolic complications, and restoring sinus rhythm. The most effective strategy for the prevention of atrial fibrillation is to identify the highest-risk patients and target them for prophylaxis with beta-blockers, amiodarone, sotalol or pacing.", 
    "46": "This study evaluated the effects of batch size on the in vitro dissolution and the in vivo bioavailability of immediate release formulations of propranolol hydrochloride and metoprolol tartrate. The formulations were manufactured as small and large batches (6 kg and 60 kg for propranolol; 14 kg and 66 kg for metoprolol), and dissolution was performed using USP Apparatus I at 100 rpm and pH 1.2. Two panels of 14 subjects each were randomly assigned to receive the small and large batches of either propranolol or metoprolol in an open, randomized single-dose study. Blood samples were collected over a 24-hour (propranolol) or 18-hour (metoprolol) period and analyzed by validated methods. As determined by the f2 metric (similarity factor), the dissolution of the small and large batches of propranolol and metoprolol was similar. The mean Cmax and AUC(inf) for the small batch of propranolol were 79.0 microg/L and 536 microg/L/hr, and for the large batch they were 83.5 microg/L and 575 microg/L/hr. Cmax and AUC(inf) for the small batch of metoprolol were found to be 95.5 microg/L and 507 microg/L/hr and for the large batch, 95.1 microg/L and 495 microg/L/hr. The 90% confidence intervals for the small and large batches were within the 80% to 120% range for lnCmax, and lnAUC(inf) for both the propranolol and metoprolol formulations. These results suggest that the scale-up process does not significantly affect the bioavailability of highly soluble, highly permeable drugs and in vitro dissolution tests may be useful in predicting in vivo behavior.", 
    "47": "The distribution and signaling pathway of beta 3-adrenoceptors involved in relaxations were examined in guinea-pig gastrointestinal smooth muscles. In esophagus, beta 1-adrenoceptors participate in isoprenaline-induced relaxations. However, both beta 2- and beta 3-adrenoceptors contribute to the relaxations in taenia caecum. In gastric fundus, duodenum, and ileum, beta 3-adrenoceptors were responsible for the relaxant responses. These results suggest that functional beta 3-adrenoceptors are present in four smooth muscles except esophagus. This was strongly supported by molecular analyses with RT-PCR, showing the expression of beta 3-adrenoceptor mRNA in the four tissues. beta 3-Adrenoceptor-mediated relaxations were unaffected by both an adenylyl cyclase inhibitor, SQ-22,536 (100 microM), and a PKA inhibitor, H-89 (10 microM), in guinea-pig gastric fundus smooth muscle. Furthermore, in the presence of SQ-22,536 (100 microM), the stimulation of beta 3-adrenoceptors elicited relaxations without an elevation of cAMP, indicating the involvement of cAMP-independent mechanism(s). beta 3-Adrenoceptor-mediated, cAMP-independent relaxations were significantly diminished by a Kv channel blocker, 4-aminopyridine (3 mM). These results indicate that beta 3-adrenoceptors play a primary role in relaxations of guinea-pig gastrointestinal smooth muscles and 4-aminopyridine-sensitive Kv channels participate in cAMP-independent smooth muscle relaxations in response to the activation of beta 3-adrenoceptors.", 
    "48": "There is little information whether cardiac capillary supply is deranged in diabetes. Hyperglycaemia is a potent stimulus for endothelin-1 (ET-1) production. We therefore hypothesised that increased ET-1 production in Streptozotocin-induced Type 1 diabetes causes abnormalities of cardiac capillaries and the aorta. To this end we compared the effects of an ET receptor A blocker (ETA-RB) with that of an ACE-inhibitor (ACE-i) or their combination in rats with Streptozotocin (STZ) diabetes.", 
    "49": "Sprague Dawley rats were injected with 65 mg STZ i.v. and subsequently developed diabetes. Rats were left untreated or received daily either the ACE-i Trandolapril, the ETA-RB Darusentan or a combination of both. After 6 months the experiment was terminated and the heart and the aorta were investigated using quantitative morphological techniques.", 
    "50": "ACE-i but not ETA-RB lowered blood pressure in STZ Type 1 diabetic rats. Capillary length density was lower in untreated STZ diabetic rats (2932+/-128 mm/mm3) compared to non-diabetic control rats (3410+/-252 mm/mm3). Treatment with ACE-i (3568+/-431 mm/mm3), but not with ETA-RB (2893+/-192 mm/mm3), prevented the decrease in capillary supply. Volume density of the myocardial interstitium was higher in untreated STZ diabetic rats (0.86+/-0.04%) compared to non-diabetic control rats (0.36+/-0.06%). In all three intervention groups the values were lower (ACE-i: 0.53+/-0.05%, ETA-RB: 0.7+/-0.08% and combination: 0.69+/-0.1).", 
    "51": "Our study identifies a capillary defect of the heart in STZ diabetes, i.e. decreased capillary supply. This abnormality was reversed by ACE-i, but not by ETA-R blockade. A similar trend, although not complete normalisation, was seen in cardiac fibrosis.", 
    "52": "The mechanism(s) of bradykinin-induced bronchoconstriction was investigated in the Brown Norway (BN) rat model of allergic asthma. Bronchoconstrictor responses to i.v. bradykinin in BN rats were maximally augmented 24 h following challenge with allergen and declined at later time points. Histological evaluation of the inflammatory status of the lungs after ovalbumin (OA) challenge showed a marked inflammatory response, which was maximal at 24 h and declined thereafter. However, pretreatment with budesonide did not inhibit the augmented bronchoconstrictor response to bradykinin 24 h after allergen challenge. The selective B1 receptor agonist, Lys-[desArg9]-BK had no bronchoconstrictor effects, whereas the selective B2 receptor antagonist, HOE 140, abolished the response to bradykinin in OA-challenged animals. The augmented response to bradykinin was not affected by methysergide, indomethacin, disodium cromoglycate, iralukast, the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, CGS8515, or the NK2 receptor antagonist, SR48968. It was, however, partially inhibited by atropine both in saline- and OA-challenged animals. Pretreatment with captopril and thiorphan markedly potentiated responses to bradykinin both in saline- and OA-challenged animals. Thus, augmentation of the bronchoconstrictor response to bradykinin occurs in actively sensitised BN rats 24 h after challenge with OA and is associated with marked pulmonary inflammation. The response is entirely B2 receptor mediated and approximately 50% of the response is cholinergic. However, mast cell activation, the products of the cyclooxygenase or 5-lipoxygenase pathways and tachykinins are not involved. Peptidase inhibition mimics the effect of allergen challenge on the bronchoconstrictor response to bradykinin and it remains possible that the mechanism of the augmented response to bradykinin following allergen challenge involves downregulation of peptidase activity as a consequence of the inflammatory response.", 
    "53": "Changes in arterial stiffness and structure occur during cardiovascular diseases and can be modified by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. In the present study we investigated the role of membrane-bound ACE (t-ACE) in the regulation of arterial structure and mechanics. Large and small arteries of t-ACE-/- mice were isolated to determine the passive pressure-diameter relationship. We observed that t-ACE-/- mice exhibit a reduced arterial distensibility compared to t-ACE+/+ mice. This reduced arterial distensibility was also observed after 9 weeks of captopril treatment (80 mg/kg/ day). We hypothesized that bradykinin type 2 receptor (BK(2)) stimulation might be involved in the regulation of arterial stiffness. t-ACE-/- and t-ACE+/+ mice were treated with Hoe 140 (1 mg/kg/day) for 14 days. After Hoe 140 treatment, both the structural and mechanical changes observed in the t-ACE-/- carotid artery were abolished. Although Hoe 140 administration increased blood pressure in both groups by approximately 10 mm Hg, the pressure difference between the two groups did not change. Thus, t-ACE is involved in the regulation of arterial distensibility. The changes observed in t-ACE-/- mice are not caused by an altered fetal development. Moreover, it is likely that the regulation of arterial distensibility by ACE involves stimulation of the BK(2) receptor.", 
    "54": "We developed a novel and generalized approach to investigate G protein-coupled receptor molecular assemblies. We solubilized a fusion protein consisting of the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor and green fluorescent protein (GFP) for bead-based flow cytometric analysis. beta(2)-Adrenergic receptor GFP bound to dihydroalprenolol-conjugated beads, providing a K(d) for the fusion protein and, in competition with beta(2)-adrenergic receptor ligands, K(d) values for agonists and antagonists. Beads displaying chelated nickel bound purified hexahistidine-tagged G protein heterotrimers and, subsequently, the binary complex of agonist with beta(2)-adrenergic receptor GFP. The dose-response curves of ternary complex formation revealed maximal assembly for ligands previously classified as full agonists and reduced assembly for ligands previously classified as partial agonists. Guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate-induced dissociation rates of the ternary complex were the same for full and partial agonists. Soluble G protein, competing with ternary complexes on beads provided an affinity estimate of agonist-receptor complexes to G protein. When performed simultaneously, the two assemblies discriminated between agonist, antagonist or inactive molecule in a manner appropriate for high throughput, small volume drug discovery. The assemblies can be further generalized to other G protein coupled receptor protein-protein interactions.", 
    "55": "Hypertension is a major risk factor for atherosclerosis and the genesis of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Therefore, the protection of atherosclerosis progression is one of the purpose of an anti-hypertensive treatment in vascular system. Nitric oxide (NO)-releasing drugs have been reported to have an inhibitory effect on shear stress-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation in endothelial cells. For further understanding of the effects of these drugs, the present study focused on the effects on intracellular signal transduction and cell proliferation in cultured human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMC) under high atmospheric pressure. Three hours of 160-mmHg atmospheric pressure resulted in an approximately 380% increase in cell proliferation compared to non-pressurized controls. Nipradilol (3,4-dihydro-8-(2-hydroxy-3-isopropylaminoproxy)-3-nitroxy-2H-1-benzopyran) (10(-6)M) demonstrated approximately 40% reduction in cell proliferation compared to that shown by pressurized HASMC as a vehicle control. Three hours of 160-mmHg atmospheric pressure resulted in a 25% increase in the amount of activated ERKs. Nipradilol (10(-6)M) demonstrated approximately a 26% reduction in the amount of activated ERKs. NO(x) concentration under the presence of nipradilol (10microM) with HASMC resulted in a 7.2microM of NO production and was 2.4-fold more than that from no dug control (3.0microM). An administration of L-NAME (10(-4)M) supplemented with Nipradilol (10(-6)M) did not show any significant effect on cell proliferation. From these observations, we concluded that nipradilol has an anti-proliferative effect on HASMC under high atmospheric pressure. Nipradilol may act as a nitric oxide inducer from HASMC and suspected to work as a supplement to mitigate the impaired endothelial cell function caused by hypertension.", 
    "56": "The present study investigated the involvement of catecholamines in stress-mediated alterations in CYP1A1 induction by benzo(alpha)pyrene (B(alpha)P) in Wistar rats. This was achieved by measuring EROD activity and CYP1A1 mRNA levels in liver tissue from rats exposed to restraint stress and B(alpha)P coupled with pharmacological modulation of peripheral and central catecholamine levels and different adrenoceptors. In a state of reserpine-induced central and peripheral catecholamine depletion, stress strongly suppressed EROD induction. Peripheral catecholamines do not appear to play a critical role in the stress-mediated modulation of EROD inducibility by B(alpha)P. Stress did not alter EROD inducibility by B(alpha)P when peripheral catecholamines were either depleted by guanethidine or supplemented by peripheral adrenaline administration. On the other hand, central noradrenergic systems appear to have a role in the stress-mediated changes in B(alpha)P-induced EROD activity and Cyp1A1 gene expression. Stimulation or blockade of noradrenaline release with atipamezole and dexmedetomidine, respectively, significantly modified the up-regulating effect of stress. Alpha1 adrenoceptors also appear to participate in the effect of stress on EROD inducibility. Alpha1-blockade with prazosin potentiated the up-regulating effect of stress, possibly preventing the down-regulating effect of noradrenaline. Beta adrenoceptors also seem to be involved directly or indirectly in the stress-mediated modulation of Cyp1A1, as propranolol (beta-antagonist) blocked the down-regulating effect of stress on B(alpha)P-induced Cyp1A1 gene expression. Plasma corticosterone alterations after stress were not related to alterations in the B(alpha)P-induced EROD activity and Cyp1A1 gene expression. In conclusion, stress appears to interfere in the regulation of B(alpha)P-induced hepatic CYP1A1 in an unpredictable manner and via signalling pathways not always directly related to catecholamines. In particular, whenever drug treatment disrupts noradrenergic neurotransmission, other stress-stimulated factors appear to modify the induction of CYP1A1. In summary, regulation of induction of hepatic CYP1A1 during stress appears to involve various components of the stress system, including central and peripheral catecholamines, which interact in a complex manner, yet to be elucidated.", 
    "57": "Cardiac output may be an important determinant of the induction dose of intravenous anaesthetic. Esmolol is known to reduce cardiac output, and we examined its effect on the propofol dose required for induction of anaesthesia. The size of the effect seen with esmolol was compared with midazolam co-induction. Sixty patients were randomly allocated to placebo (saline), esmolol (1mg x kg(-1) bolus, followed by an infusion at 250 microg x kg(-1)min(-1)) or midazolam (0.04 mg x kg(-1)) groups. Induction of anaesthesia commenced 3 min following the administration of the study drug, using a Diprifusor set to achieve plasma propofol concentrations of 10 microg x ml(-1) at 5 min. The primary end point used was the propofol dose per kg at loss of response to command. The mean (SD) propofol dose for each group was 2.38 (0.48) mg x kg(-1) for placebo, 1.79 (0.36) mg x kg(-1) for esmolol and 1.34 (0.35) mg x kg(-1) for midazolam (all means significantly different; p < 0.0005). We found that predosing with esmolol reduces the propofol requirements for induction of anaesthesia by 25%.",

Over the past several years, many of the contraindications traditionally listed for betablockers have been questioned and disproved. Beta-blockers were contraindicated in CHF because of their intrinsic negative inotropic activity, but have now been shown to be beneficial, partly due to their ability to enhance sensitivity to sympathetic stimulation. Beta-blockers have also been contraindicated for patients with obstructive lung diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, due to the potential risk for bronchospasm. However, new evidence has shown that cardioselective beta-blockers are safe in patients with obstructive lung diseases, and may actually be beneficial by enhancing sensitivity to endogenous or exogenous beta-adrenergic stimulation.

The accelerating effect of (+/-)pindolol is thought to derive from its blockade of the SSRI-induced, 5-HT1A autoreceptor-mediated inhibition of serotonergic cell firing and 5-HT release. However, controversial results have been reported in regard to its ability to antagonize the effect of 5-HT at such receptors. In the present study, we have analysed the effect of (+/-)pindolol on receptor-mediated G-protein activation by measuring guanylyl 5'-[gamma-[35S]thio]-triphosphate ([35S]GTPgammaS) binding onto tissue sections from the hippocampus and dorsal raphe nucleus from rat, guinea pig and human brain. In these regions, enriched in 5-HT1A receptors, (+/-)pindolol antagonized the stimulation of [35S]GTPgammaS binding induced by 5-HT in a concentration-dependent manner. We found that in both rat and human brain the calculated pEC50 values were higher in the dorsal raphe nucleus than in hippocampus. This suggests a higher potency of (+/-)pindolol at somatodendritic 5-HT1A receptors compared to post-synaptic 5-HT1A sites. In the absence of 5-HT, (+/-)pindolol (up to 10(-3) M) did not modify [35S]GTPgammaS binding, which remained at basal levels, indicating that, in this assay, (+/-)pindolol acts as a neutral antagonist rather than a partial agonist as it has been observed in other experimental models. The present data are relevant for the understanding of the neurobiological basis of pindolol acceleration of the action of SSRI antidepressants.", 
    "87": "VF is induced during ICD implantation to determine efficacy of therapy. Establishing the best clinical method of induction of VF would potentially be beneficial in reducing the number of induction attempts and reducing the frequency of inadvertent induction of VT. Commonly used methods to induce VF include shock in the T wave vulnerable period (T shock) and high frequency stimulation. This study compared the efficacy of T shock with a new induction method using a 9-V DC pulse. The study was a randomized, prospective, case crossover trial in patients receiving ICDs. VF was induced by T shock and DC in a randomized sequence during an ICD implant. VF was induced at least four times in each patient (two T shocks and two DC inductions) and with each induction; attempts were continued with modifications until successful. A paired evaluation between the T shock/DC induction was performed in 37 patients (28 men, age 64 +/- 12 years) with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 0.40 +/- 0.20. Arrhythmia indications were VT (n = 23), VF (n = 10), and VT/VF (n = 4). Drug therapy included amiodarone (n = 10), metoprolol (n = 6), digoxin (n = 1), and lidocaine (n = 1). The average T shock voltage was 207.0 +/- 16.1 V. The S1 cycle drive length was consistently 400 ms, and the mean S2 coupling interval was 317.8 +/- 19.6 ms. The length of time DC applied averaged 3.8 +/- 1.4 seconds. A total of 148 episodes of VF were included in the analysis. T shock induced VF with a cycle length of 213.5 +/- 35.1 ms, and DC induced VF with a cycle length of 214.6 +/- 34.5 ms (P = 0.86). Although VF was eventually induced for each randomization, the number of attempts required were dependent on the method of induction. The successful DC first attempt VF induction rate was 96%, with three patients requiring two attempts during one of the DC inductions. T shock had a 68% first attempt success rate with 21 patients requiring multiple T shocks to induce VF. All nine female patients had at least one unsuccessful first attempt T shock, which contributed to an overall unsuccessful first attempt induction rate significantly higher in women then men (36.1% vs 12.5%, P = 0.001). A constant DC voltage induction of VF may be more effective than T shock for induction of VF in a clinical setting because it reduces the number of attempts required to induce VF. By either method, VF appears to be more difficult to induce in women. DC induction has the advantage of simple programming of only duration of stimulation. These findings have implications particularly for ICD implantation with conscious sedation.", 
    "88": "The purpose of the present study was to assess the influence of autonomic blockade on shortening of effective refractory period (ERP) induced by short-term rapid atrial pacing (RAP) and its recovery process. Fifteen patients (8 men, 7 women, age 52 +/- 16 years) without structural heart disease and without a history of atrial fibrillation were included in this study. All patients underwent RAP at a cycle length of 300 ms for 5 minutes, after which the ERP was measured in all patients at 1, 3, 5, 7.5, and 10 minutes following cessation of RAP. In ten patients, these RAP and measurements of ERPs were repeated after administration of propranolol (P) and subsequent administration of atropine (P + A), respectively. In the remaining five patients atropine (A) was given first and then the administration of propranolol followed (P + A). Relative to the baseline value, the ERP immediately after RAP did not differ significantly from the Control(C), P, A, or P + A (C, 79%+/- 8%; P, 82%+/- 9%; A, 80%+/- 6%; P + A, 82%+/- 13%). However, the ERP 3 minutes after cessation of RAP was significantly (P < 0.05) longer in A (93%+/- 4%) and P + A (97%+/- 5%) than that in C (86%+/- 5%) and P (86%+/- 5%). The recovery time for ERP to return to pre-RAP value was significantly shorter during A and P + A than during either C or P (C, 536 +/- 161 s; P, 503 +/- 172 s; A, 282 +/- 111 s; P + A, 291 +/- 147 s; P < 0.05). Parasympathetic blockade may promote recovery from ERP shortening induced by short-term RAP.", 
    "89": "Inhaled beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonists (beta(2)-agonists) are the most commonly used asthma medications in many Western countries. Minor adverse effects such as palpitations, tremor, headache and metabolic effects are predictable and dose related. Time series studies suggested an association between the relatively nonselective beta-agonist fenoterol and asthma deaths. Three case-control studies confirmed that among patients prescribed fenoterol, the risk of death was significantly elevated even after controlling for the severity of asthma. The Saskatchewan study not only found an increased risk of death among patients dispensed fenoterol, but also suggested this might be a class effect of beta(2)-agonists. However, in subsequent studies, the long-acting beta(2)-agonist salmeterol was not associated with increased asthma mortality. In a case-control study blood albuterol (salbutamol) concentrations were found to be 2.5 times higher among patients who died of asthma compared with controls. It is speculated that such toxic concentrations could cause tachyarrhythmias under conditions of hypoxia and hypokalemia. The risk of asthma exacerbations and near-fatal attacks may also be increased among patients dispensed fenoterol, but this association may be largely due to confounding by severity. Although salmeterol does not appear to increase the risk of near-fatal attacks, there is a consistent association with the use of nebulized beta(2)-agonists. Nebulized and oral beta(2)-agonists are also associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular death, ischemic heart disease and cardiac failure. Caution should be exercised when first prescribing a beta-agonist for patients with cardiovascular disease. A potential mechanism for adverse effects with regular use of beta(2)-agonists is tachyphylaxis. Tachyphylaxis to the bronchodilator effects of long-acting beta(2)-agonists can occur, but has been consistently demonstrated only for formoterol (eformoterol) a full agonist, rather than salmeterol, a partial agonist. Tachyphylaxis to protection against induced bronchospasm occurs with both full and partial beta(2)-agonists, and probably within a matter of days at most. Underlying airway responsiveness to directly acting bronchoconstricting agents is not increased when the bronchodilator effect of the regular beta(2)-agonist has been allowed to wear off, although there may be an increase in responsiveness to indirectly acting agents. While there has been speculation that underlying airway inflammation in asthma may be made worse by regular use of short-acting beta(2)-agonists, in contradistinction, a number of studies have shown that long-acting beta(2)-agonists have positive anti-inflammatory effects. An Australian Cochrane Airways Group systematic review of the randomized, controlled trials of short-acting beta-agonists found only minimal and clinically unimportant differences between regular use and use as needed. Regular short-acting treatment was better than placebo. However, a subsequent systematic review has found that regular use of long-acting beta-agonists had significant advantages over regular use of short-acting beta-agonists. More studies and data are needed on the regular use of beta(2)-agonists in patients not taking inhaled corticosteroids, and in potentially vulnerable groups, such as the elderly and those with particular genotypes for the beta-receptor, who might be more prone to adverse effects.", 
    "90": "A431 resistant variants to epoxomicin (EXM) were established, showing 4.0-6.7 times more resistance to EXM than parental A431P. Both variants demonstrated increased expression of the beta-subunit molecules of 26S proteasome with approximately 2.5 times increased activity. In variant cells, cyclin B and P34cdc2 were over-expressed, whereas P21WAF1 was expressed at a similar level to A431P. Because of the proteasome inhibitor acting as a G2/M blocker, results are to the advantage of resistant cells proliferating in the presence of an inhibitor under a severe environment. Variant cells showed increased expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and decreased expression of mRNA, but also slight accumulation of protein of c-Cbl, which is a negative regulator of EGFR possessing ubiquitin ligase activity to desensitize EGF signaling. UbcH7, acting intimately with c-Cbl, was decreased in level compared to A431P. These phenomena can be regarded as one of the causes of prevention of c-Cbl-mediated down-regulation of EGFR in variant cells, enabling them to live. The anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 mainly consisted of a phosphorylated form with resistance to proteasomal degradation, suggesting that Bcl-2 phosphorylation occurred independently of its apoptotic function. Variant cells showed resistance not only to EXM, but to the 5 proteasome inhibitors, while demonstrating collateral sensitivity to doxorubicin.", 
    "91": "This study investigates the effect of the aryloxypropanolamines 4-[3-[(1,1-dimethylethyl)amino]-2-hydroxypropoxy]-1,3-dihydro-2H-benzimidazol-2-one (CGP 12177), bupranolol, and 3-(2-ethylphenoxy)-1[(1S)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphth-1-ylamino]-(2S)-2-propanol oxalate (SR 59230A) [commonly used as beta(3)- and/or atypical beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-AR) ligands] on the contractile function of rat intralobar pulmonary artery. Affinities of beta-AR ligands for alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors (alpha(1)-AR) were also evaluated using [(3)H]prazosin binding competition experiments performed in rat cortical membranes. In intralobar pulmonary artery, CGP 12177 did not modify the basal tone, but antagonized the contraction induced by the alpha(1)-AR agonist phenylephrine (PHE). In arteries precontracted with PHE, CGP 12177 elicited relaxation, whereas in those precontracted with prostaglandin F(2alpha) (PGF(2alpha)), it further enhanced contraction. CGP 12177 induced an increase in intracellular calcium concentration in pressurized arteries loaded with Fura PE-3 and precontracted with PGF(2alpha). In PGF(2alpha) precontracted arteries, phentolamine (an alpha-AR antagonist) and phenoxybenzamine (an irreversible alpha-AR antagonist) antagonized the contractile responses to PHE and CGP 12177. Both responses were also decreased by bupranolol and SR 59230A. Specific [(3)H]prazosin binding was displaced by CGP 12177, bupranolol, and SR 59230A with pK(i) values of 5.2, 5.7, and 6.6, respectively. In contrast, (+/-)-(R*,R*)-[4-[2-[[2-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl]amino]propyl]phenoxy]acetic acid sodium (BRL 37344) and disodium 5-[(2R)-2-([(2R)-2-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl]amino)propyl]-1,3-benzodioxole-2,2-dicarboxylate (CL 316243) (nonaryloxypropanolamines beta(3)-AR agonists) displayed very low affinity for [(3)H]prazosin binding sites (pK(i) values below 4). These data suggest that CGP 12177 exhibits partial agonist properties for alpha(1)-AR in rat pulmonary artery. They also show that bupranolol and SR 59230A exert an alpha(1)-AR antagonist effect. As a consequence, these aryloxypropanolamine compounds should be used with caution when investigating the role of beta(3)- and atypical beta-AR in the regulation of vascular tone.",

We analyzed the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the circulating and peritoneally infiltrating PMN from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY). Flow cytometric analysis revealed that ROS generation by PMN from SHR was higher than that from WKY before (at 6 weeks of age) and after (at 16 weeks of age) the onset of hypertension. In vivo, ROS generation by PMN from SHR, but not that by PMN from WKY, was significantly suppressed by 10-week treatment with 50 mg/kg/day carvedilol, and this treatment did not affect blood pressure. Western blotting analysis revealed that protein kinase C alpha (PKCalpha), but not PKCbetaI or betaII, was activated more strongly in PMN from SHR than in PMN from WKY. Furthermore, expression of p47phox of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase, but not of p67phox, in PMN from SHR was higher than that in PMN from WKY. These results suggest that ROS generation by PMN is principally enhanced in SHR through activation of PKCalpha and p47phox.",

Based on electrocardiograms from 39 healthy patients, we computed the stability of repolarization measurements and compared the sotalol-induced repolarization changes when measured with area-based parameters and traditional QT interval techniques (manual and automatic). Also, we evaluated the effect of different types of heart rate correction on these repolarization measurements. The results show that the stability of the automatic repolarization measurements is higher when measured using computer algorithm than using manual QT measurement. By using a population-based heart rate correction, the area-based parameters reveal significant modification of the overall shape of the T wave in its early, middle, and final part. In conclusion, morphological parameters of T wave are able to identify the changes in repolarization interval induced by sotalol. These parameters are more stable and thus more reliable than the traditional QT interval measurements.",

    "114": "Voltage-gated tetrodotoxin-sensitive sodium channels of Purkinje neurons produce \"resurgent\" current with repolarization, which results from relief of an open-channel block that terminates current flow at positive potentials. The associated recovery of sodium channels from inactivation is thought to facilitate the rapid firing patterns characteristic of Purkinje neurons. Resurgent current appears to depend primarily on NaV1.6 alpha subunits, because it is greatly reduced in \"med\" mutant mice that lack NaV1.6. To identify factors that regulate the susceptibility of alpha subunits to open-channel block, we voltage clamped wild-type and med Purkinje neurons before and after slowing conventional inactivation with beta-pompilidotoxin (beta-PMTX). beta-PMTX increased resurgent current in wild-type neurons and induced resurgent current in med neurons. In med cells, the resurgent component of beta-PMTX-modified sodium currents could be selectively abolished by application of intracellular alkaline phosphatase, suggesting that, like in NaV1.6-expressing cells, the open-channel block of NaV1.1 and NaV1.2 subunits is regulated by constitutive phosphorylation. These results indicate that the endogenous blocker exists independently of NaV1.6 expression, and conventional inactivation regulates resurgent current by controlling the extent of open-channel block. In Purkinje cells, therefore, the relatively slow conventional inactivation kinetics of NaV1.6 appear well adapted to carry resurgent current. Nevertheless, NaV1.6 is not unique in its susceptibility to open-channel block, because under appropriate conditions, the non-NaV1.6 subunits can produce robust resurgent currents.", 
    "115": "Plaque destabilization leading to myocardial infarction is observed after surgery even if the intervention is of noncardiovascular nature. Mediators of peri- or postoperative stress responsible for such events could include catecholamines and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Monocytes may be involved in destabilization of atherosclerotic plaques by production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP). We examined whether catecholamines could affect the expression of MMPs in human monocytes/macrophages and whether catecholamines could modulate LPS-stimulated expression of particular MMPs in these cells. Epinephrine and norepinephrine up-regulated MMP-1 and potentiated LPS-induced expression of MMP-1 in peripheral blood monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages. We further characterized this effect employing the monocytic cell line U937 and showed that catecholamines potentiate LPS-induced effects on MMP-1 and MMP-9 antigen and activity. mRNA levels of the respective MMPs also increased. These effects did not result from higher mRNA stability but rather from increased transcription possibly induced by enhanced DNA binding of AP-1 and were mediated by either beta1- or beta 2-receptors. If this mechanism is also effective in vivo, our findings might, at least in part, help to explain the observation that cardiac events are important causes of morbidity and mortality after noncardiac surgery and support the findings that peri-operative beta-blockade has been shown to reduce postoperative mortality from cardiac events.",

    "132": "For a similar DBP reduction, Per/Ind decreased SBP significantly more than atenolol, with a more pronounced reduction for central than for brachial SBP. After one year, the difference between brachial and central SBP was maintained by Per/Ind (8.28 +/- 1.53 mm Hg) and significantly attenuated by atenolol (0.29 +/- 1.61 mm Hg). Under atenolol, the principal factor modulating SBP reduction was mean blood pressure. Under Per/Ind, this parameter played a minor role, and the central SBP reduction implied a major role for disturbed PWV and wave reflections.", 
    "133": "Under Per/Ind, but not atenolol, normalization of brachial SBP is achieved with a significantly greater reduction of central SBP. This hemodynamic profile reflects changes of wave reflections issued from distal arterial and arteriolar territory, where Per/Ind, but not atenolol, is known to improve vessel wall structure.", 
    "134": "Mechanisms of action at the cellular level of a variety of drugs and xenobiotics may be assessed using Chlorella vulgaris cells. Synchronous culture, which consists of cells at the same phase of development, provides the most convenient model for studying processes at the cellular level. Stability of metabolic activity of synchronously growing cells is achieved by conducting cell culturing under strictly controlled conditions. The aim of the present study was to determine to what extent propranolol and metoprolol alter the Chlorella vulgaris metabolic activity, expressed by the number of progeny cells, the culture absorbance at lambda = 680 nm and the amount of selected photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, antheraxanthin, lutein, violaxanthin and beta-carotene). Three different concentrations (10(-4), 10(-5) and 10(-6) M) of propranolol and metoprolol were administered to the Chlorella vulgaris cultures. It has been demonstrated that the higher the propranolol and metoprolol concentrations (from 10(-6) M to 10(-4) M) the lower the number of progeny cells in the cultures, expressed by the lower values of division coefficient. Both the propranolol and metoprolol caused a decrease in the photosynthetic pigments production in the mother cells. This effect was more important in the propranolol-treated cultures. The higher values of photosynthetic pigments concentrations in the progeny cells grown under the presence of a drug indicate that both the drugs tested influence mainly the cell growth and in a lower manner--their metabolic activity, expressed by the production of photosynthetic pigments.", 
    "135": "The aim was to investigate the insulin-releasing activity of motilin during and after feeding. A single intravenous bolus injection of motilin (0.01-0.3 microg/kg) dose-dependently stimulated endogenous release of insulin in the postprandial state. The insulin-releasing activity of motilin in the fed state was completely abolished by pretreatment with atropine or hexamethonium and was partly inhibited by ondansetron. Truncal vagotomy also greatly suppressed the motilin-induced insulin release. While phentolamine significantly enhanced insulin release in response to motilin, propranolol significantly inhibited this response in both states. The motilin-induced insulin release in the fed states was not accompanied by any changes in glucose concentrations. In conclusion, while the physiological significance remains unclear, these results indicate that physiological doses of motilin stimulate endogenous release of insulin via a vagally cholinergic muscarinic pathway, and that adrenergic and 5-hydroxytryptamine3 receptors are also involved in this response, in the dog.",

Patients who showed a reduction in the HVPG of more than 20% of the baseline were defined as being responders.",

However, of the 29 patients receiving captopril, 9 were classified as being responders. On multivariate analysis with parameters including age, cause, Child-Pugh score, HVPG, and PVV, only low PVV was found to be a significant independent factor for responders (PVV < 12 cm/s; odds ratio [OR], 12.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.47-102.40) in the captopril group.", 
    "139": "Longterm captopril administration reduces the portal pressure effectively in cirrhotic patients with a low PVV. This suggests that the reduction in portal pressure after captopril administration is a result of improved portal venous outflow brought about by a decrease in the intrahepatic vascular resistance.

    "140": "Platelet shape change (SC), aggregation and deaggregation responses are integral components of hemostasis that are elicited and modulated in vivo by the simultaneous activation of several membrane receptors. Selective activation of the purinergic P2Y1 receptor in vivo elicits a sustained SC and a small, transient aggregation response that is reversed rapidly by a robust deaggregation response (Platelets 2003; 14: 89). Using a kinetics-based turbidimetric approach to study the modulation of these concurrent components of human platelet responses, we demonstrate that these P2Y1 receptor-related responses and a number of their kinetic and steady-state characteristics are differentially elicited and modulated. P2Y1 receptor agonist concentrations that elicited aggregation (pEC50 for ADP, 2-MeSADP; 5.88, 6.69) were 10-fold greater than those that elicited SC (7.33, 7.67). The magnitude of the aggregation response was agonist concentration-dependent, saturable and was associated with an agonist concentration-dependent deceleration of the deaggregation response. Gi-coupled receptor (alpha 2A-adrenoceptor, EP3 and P2Y12 receptors) agonists also enhanced aggregation through deceleration of the deaggregation response, and an inhibitor of PI3K activity (wortmannin) inhibited aggregation through acceleration of the deaggregation response. Neither treatment affected the extent or the kinetics of the SC response. The aggregation but not the SC response was rapidly desensitized by P2Y1 receptor activation by ADP. The affinity of the presence of a single P2Y1 receptor subtype. The differential characteristics and modulation of the SC and aggregation responses by a single receptor support the idea that different signaling pathways activated at different occupancy states of the same receptor underlie the two responses. P2Y1 receptor-mediated platelet aggregation and SC responses provide a convenient model for studying the phenomenon of agonist-directed signaling by differential occupancy of the same membrane receptor.", 
    "141": "An endocrine disruptor chemical, bisphenol-A (BPA), is reported to have several short-term actions in various tissues and/or cells; however, the mechanisms of these actions have not been fully elucidated. We investigated short-term actions evoked by BPA in pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. BPA elicited dopamine release in PC12 cells in a dose-dependent manner. A selective N-type calcium channel antagonist (omega-conotoxin GVIA) and a ryanodine receptor blocker (ryanodine) inhibited the BPA-induced dopamine release. The expression of ryanodine receptor mRNA was detected by RT-PCR in PC12 cells. Subsequently, in order to prove whether membrane receptors participate in BPA-evoked dopamine release, a guanine nucleotide-binding protein inhibitor [guanosine 5'-(beta-thio) diphosphate], cyclic AMP antagonist (Rp-cAMPS) or protein kinase A inhibitor (H7 or H89) was added to PC12 cells prior to BPA-treatment. All of these agents suppressed BPA-evoked dopamine release, indicating that multiple signaling pathways may be involved in BPA-evoked dopamine release in PC12 cells. In conclusion, we demonstrated that BPA induced dopamine release in a non-genomic manner through guanine nucleotide-binding protein and N-type calcium channels. These findings illustrate a novel function of BPA and suggest that exposure to BPA influences the function of dopaminergic neurons.",

The mortality and the overall proportion of patients requiring rehospitalization was similar in the two cohorts. Thirty months after onset of symptoms there was a difference between the two study populations. Patients in the county hospital smoked less frequently (p = 0.004). They tended to have less problems with chest pain at rest (p < 0.05) and dyspnoea at slight physical exercise (p = 0.01). Furthermore, they had less emotional symptoms (p = 0.003) and their state of health caused fewer problems when doing housekeeping (p = 0.008).

The above-mentioned agonists produced concentration-dependent relaxation of the smooth muscle strips. Both the selective G(i/o)alpha and G(s)alpha antagonists 8,8'-(carbonylbis(imino-3,1-phenylene))bis-(1,3,5-naphthalene trisulfonic acid) (NF 023) and 4,4',4\",4\"'-(carbonylbis(imino-5,1,3-benzenetriylbis(carbonylimino)))tetrakis-benzene-1,3-disulfonic acid (NF 449), respectively, inhibited the relaxation induced by procaterol. However, only NF 023 inhibited the relaxation induced by xamoterol and CL 316243. 1H-[1,2,4]Oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one, a soluble GC inhibitor, significantly inhibited the relaxation induced by different agonists. In contrast, the selective AC inhibitor [9-(tetrahydro-2'-furyl)adenine] (SQ 22536) inhibited only the relaxation induced by procaterol.

Xamoterol produced significant increase in cGMP levels, whereas only procaterol enhanced the cAMP levels. Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of beta(1), beta(2), and beta(3)-AR subtypes in the IAS. In summary, beta(2)-AR activates both G(s)alpha and G(i/o)alpha-protein subunits and induces relaxation in the rat IAS via both cAMP/cGMP pathways. In contrast, the beta(1)/beta(3)-ARs activation causes the smooth muscle relaxation via G(i/o)alpha-protein subunit/GC/GMP/PKG pathway. These studies are important for the understanding of intracellular mechanisms underlying IAS smooth muscle relaxation and in turn the pathophysiology of certain anorectal motility disorders.", 
    "147": "The dose-related beneficial effects of carvedilol on survival in heart failure have been verified, however, the effects on left ventricular remodeling (LVRM) after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) have not been defined. This experiment was designed to compare the effects of low, middle, and high doses of carvedilol (LD-car, MD-car, and HD-car) with metoprolol (Meto) in preventing postinfarction LVRM in rats. After the left coronary artery was ligated, 177 surviving female SD rats were randomized to: (1) AMI (n = 35), (2) LD-car (0.1 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1), n = 35), (3) MD-car (1 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1), n = 35), (4) HD-car (10 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1), n = 37) and (5) Meto (2 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1), n = 35) groups. A sham-operated group (n = 16) was also randomly selected. Gastric gavage therapy lasted for 4 weeks. After hemodynamic studies, the rat hearts were fixed and pathologically analyzed. After exclusion of rats which died or had an infarct size < 35% or > 55%, complete data were obtained in 69 rats, comprising AMI (n = 11), LD-car (n = 11), MD-car (n = 12), HD-car (n = 12), Meto (n = 11) and sham (n = 12) groups. There were no significant differences in MI size among the five AMI groups (44.5-46.3%, all P > 0.05). Compared with the sham group, left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), volume (LVV), weight (LVW) and septal thickness (STh) were all significantly increased, while +/- dp/dt was significantly decreased in the AMI group (all P < 0.001). Compared with the AMI group, heart rate was significantly decreased in all except the LD-car treatment groups (P < 0.05-0.01); LVEDP, LVV, LVW, and STh in the four treatment groups were also significantly decreased (P < 0.05-0.001) except LVW and STh in the Meto group (both P > 0.05)(LVEDP: 14.5 +/- 4.6, 12.1 +/- 2.4, 7.7 +/- 1.9 and 13.0 +/- 6.7 mmHg vs 24.1 +/- 5.2 mmHg; LVV: 0.82 +/- 0.1, 0.79 +/- 0.1, 0.72 +/- 0.1 and 0.72 +/- 0.1 mL vs 0.92 +/- 0.1 mL; LVW: 666 +/- 57, 622 +/- 70, 589 +/- 57 and 699 +/- 78 mg vs 730 +/- 79 mg; STh: 1.14 +/- 0.12, 1.18 +/- 0.21, 1.19 +/- 0.15 and 1.35 +/- 0.20 mm vs 1.33 +/- 0.29 mm; P < 0.05-0.001); while +/- dp/dt was significantly increased in each therapy group (P < 0.05-0.001). There were dose-effect relations in LVEDP and LVV in the carvedilol groups. The results indicate that low, middle and high dose carvedilol has dose-related effects in the prevention of postinfarction LVRM with respect to volume expansion and segmental hypertrophy in rats, while metoprolol prevents only LV dilatation but not hypertrophy.", 
    "148": "Carvedilol has hypotensive effects and inhibits agonist-induced cell proliferation of vascular smooth muscle and then prevents vascular remodeling. However, the basic mechanisms have not been clarified. We examined the effects of carvedilol on [Ca2+]i mobilization and voltage-dependent L-type Ca2+ current (ICa.L) in vascular smooth muscle cells, and compared them with metoprolol. [Ca2+]i was measured using fura-2 AM and patch clamp techniques in rat embryonic aortic smooth muscle cells (A7r5). In the presence of extracellular Ca2+, vasopressin and endothelin-1 increased [Ca2+]i due first to the Ca2+ release from store sites, and subsequently Ca2+ entry. Carvedilol did not inhibit the Ca2+ release, but significantly suppressed the sustained rise due to Ca2+ entry concentration-dependently. Nilfedipine and nicardipine (10 microM) partly inhibited the sustained rise, but carvedilol inhibited it more effectively than the Ca2+ channel blockers. Under voltage clamp conditions, carvedilol (0.2-10 microM) reversibly inhibited the ICa.L concentration-dependently without any changes in the current-voltage relationships of ICa.L. Carvedilol shifted the steady-state inactivation for ICa.L to more negative potentials and inhibited ICa.L in a voltage-dependent manner. In addition, carvedilol did not inhibit Ca2+ release from store sites induced by thapsigargin, but significantly inhibited the sustained rise due to capacitative Ca2+ entry unrelated to ICa.L. In contrast, metoprolol did not mimic these effects of carvedilol. These results provide evidence that carvedilol inhibits ICa.L and may also inhibit the channels for agonist (vasopressin and endothelin-1)-induced Ca2+ entry in vascular smooth muscle cells, which might contribute to the vasorelaxing and antiproliferative effects of carvedilol.", 
    "149": "Changes in the density of myocardium and blood lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptors (beta-AR) in left ventricular (LV) geometry have been found in patients with essential hypertension (EH). However, it is not known whether intrinsic beta-AR subtype function changes during left ventricular remodeling of hypertension. The purpose of this study was to further investigate the changes and clinical significance of beta-AR subtype function in LV remodeling in patients with EH. One hundred and thirty-four men (mean age, 53 years) with EH as defined in the Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure grades 1 to 2 and 40 normotensives were studied. Based on the echocardiographic LV mass index and relative wall thickness, four patterns of LV geometry, ie, normal left ventricle, concentric remodeling, eccentric hypertrophy, and concentric hypertrophy were identilied. beta-Adrenoreceptor subtype responsiveness was measured by a treadmill exercise test (to measure cardiac beta1-adrenoreceptor responsiveness) and by Salbutamol injection test (to measure cardiac beta2-adrenoreceptor responsiveness) in 134 male patients with EH. Forty normotension subjects were also studied as controls. In patients with EH in the groups of concentric remodeling, concentric hypertrophy, and eccentric hypertrophy, heart rate in response to the treadmill test (peak exercise-resting rate) was significantly higher (P < 0.05, P < 0.01. P < 0.01, respectively) than that in the control group. In the concentric remodeling and concentric hypertrophy group, the chronotropic doses of salbutamol required to increase the heart rate by 30 beats/min (CD30) were significantly lower (P < 0.05, P < 0.01, respectively) than that in the control group. However, in the eccentric hypertrophy group. CD30 was higher significantly (P < 0.01) than that in the control group. In the concentric remodeling, concentric hypertrophy, and eccentric hypertrophy groups, beta1-AR responsiveness significantly increased them in the normotensive group, whereas beta2-AR responsiveness significantly increased in the concentric remodeling and concentric hypertrophy groups them in the normotensive group, and significantly decreased in the eccentric hypertrophy them in the normotensive group. The results suggest that non-beta-selective blocker may be beneficial for normal morphology, concentric remodeling and concentric hypertrophy, while beta1-selective blockers may be beneficial for eccentric hypertrophy in patients with EH.",

After each drug injection alone, the heart rate was not different compared with the control. However, the heart rate was significantly decreased by combinations of procainamide and propranolol or flecainide and propranolol. In addition, arrhythmia was produced in combination with propranolol. These findings indicate that the drug-drug interactions between antiarrhythmic drugs have a marked influence on the heart rate in chick embryos.",

An enzyme marker was similarly prepared by coupling sotalol with beta-D-galactosidase. The detection limit of sotalol by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was approximately 32 ng/ml with 50-microl samples. This assay was specific for sotalol because of very slight cross-reactivity with 4-(methanesulfonylamino)benzonitrile (1.6%), but none with D,L-isoproterenol. Using this assay, drug levels were easily measured in the serum of rabbits after oral administration of sotalol at a single dose of 3 mg/kg.

We have, therefore, examined the expression and function of the ACTH receptor (the melanocortin 2 receptor, MC2-R) in human and mouse primary islet tIssue and in the MIN6 mouse insulinoma cell line. Mouse MC2-R mRNA was detected in both MIN6 cells and mouse islet tIssue by PCR amplification of cDNA. In perifusion experiments with MIN6 pseudo-islets, a small, transient increase in insulin secretion was obtained when ACTH(1-24) (1 nM) was added to medium containing 2 mM glucose (control) but not when the medium glucose content was increased to 8 mM. Further investigations were performed using static incubations of MIN6 cell monolayers; ACTH(1-24) (1 pM-10 nM) provoked a concentration-dependent increase in insulin secretion from MIN6 monolayer cells that achieved statistical significance at concentrations of 1 and 10 nM (150 +/- 13.6% basal secretion; 187 +/- 14.9% basal secretion, P<0.01). Similar responses were obtained with ACTH(1-39). The phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX (100 microM) potentiated the responses to sub-maximal doses of ACTH(1-24). Two inhibitors of the protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway, Rp-cAMPS (500 microM) and H-89 (10 microM), abolished the insulin secretory response to ACTH(1-24) (0.5-10 nM). Treatment with 1 nM ACTH(1-24) caused a small, statistically significant increase in intracellular cAMP levels. Secretory responses of MIN6 cells to ACTH(1-24) were also influenced by changes in extracellular Ca2+ levels. Incubation in Ca2+-free buffer supplemented with 0.1 mM EGTA blocked the MIN6 cells' secretory response to 1 and 10 nM ACTH(1-24). Similar results were obtained when a Ca2+ channel blocker (nitrendipine, 10 microM) was added to the Ca2+-containing buffer. ACTH(1-24) also evoked an insulin secretory response from primary tIssues. The addition of ACTH(1-24) (0.5 nM) to perifusions of mouse islets induced a transient increase in insulin secretion at 8 mM glucose. Perifused human primary islets also showed a secretory response to ACTH(1-24) at basal glucose concentration (2 mM) with a rapid initial spike in insulin secretion followed by a decline to basal levels. Overall the results demonstrate that the MC2-R is expressed in beta-cells and suggest that activation of the receptor by ACTH initiates insulin secretion through the activation of PKA in association with Ca2+ influx into beta-cells.", 
    "163": "Diastolic heart failure is predominantly a disease of the elderly: at the age of 70 years, almost half of all patients with heart failure have diastolic heart failure. Hypertension and obesity are common underlying disorders in patients with diastolic heart failure. Patients with diastolic heart failure have an equal, or only slightly better, prognosis in terms of mortality compared to patients with systolic heart failure. Echocardiography can distinguish diastolic heart failure from systolic heart failure. Patients with heart failure and a normal ejection fraction almost certainly have a diastolic dysfunction. There is a lack of reliable data about the optimal medicinal treatment strategy for patients with diastolic heart failure.

One of the studies ('Carvedilol or metoprolol European trial' (COMET)) demonstrated a statistically significant 17% reduction of all-cause mortality with carvedilol. Although striking, the results may have been influenced by differences in blood pressure and heart rate, as well as the short-acting formula of metoprolol that was used. Furthermore, the 'Carvedilol hibernation reversible ischaemia trial; marker of success' (CHRISTMAS) study demonstrated myocardial hibernation in the majority of ischaemic heart-failure patients, and showed beneficial effects on left-ventricle function with carvedilol in both hibernated and non-hibernated patients.

The patient is currently under metoprolol for a year without flare-ups.", 
    "169": "The use of metoprolol tartrate in this patient resulted in resolution of bilateral noninfectious uveitis. This is the first report of non-antiinfectious, antiinflammatory, or immunosuppressive drug effective for uveitis.

    "170": "Brimonidine 0.2% (Alphagan) is a topical alpha-2 agonist widely used as an antihypertensive. There have been occasional reports of systemic adverse effects in children including apparent central nervous system depression. There are few data available on the overall safety of brimonidine 0.2% in children.", 
    "171": "Computerised pharmacy records were used to identify all children who had been prescribed brimonidine 0.2% in our eye department between August 1999 and June 2001, and their notes were reviewed.", 
    "172": "In all, 23 patients were identified from pharmacy records and 22 sets of notes were recovered and reviewed. The mean age at commencement of treatment was 8 years (range 0-14 years). In all, 10 (46%) were treated in one eye and 12 (54%) in both. Brimonidine 0.2% was taken for a mean 14 months (range 1 day-75 months). A total of 14 (64%) patients were already taking a topical beta-blocker when brimonidine 0.2% was commenced and a further four (18%) were being treated with another topical hypotensive agent. Of the 22 patients, six (27%) had to stop brimonidine 0.2% because of adverse side effects (two because of local irritation/allergy, two because of tiredness, and two because of fainting attacks).", 
    "173": "Many topical hypotensive agents are not licensed for use in children and few safety data are available. In this study, 18% of children had systemic adverse effects sufficient to necessitate stopping the drug. It is possible that educational impairment may have passed unnoticed in others. Larger studies are required to investigate this further.",

    "176": "The end point for statistical analysis was the difference in survival between the placebo and treatment mice. The odds ratio for survival of treatment mice relative to placebo mice was 1.64. The hypothesis of equal survival proportions gave a chi-square of 2.0916 (1 degree of freedom), which has a p-value of 0.1481. The analysis was then adjusted for mouse weight and intraperitoneal (-)-propranolol dosage using a logistic regression (LR) model. The LR treatment odds ratio was 2.017 and the LR treatment chi-square was 2.8864 (1 degree of freedom), which has a p-value of 0.0893. Consequently we accept the null hypothesis of no treatment effect on survival. The odds ratio estimates show that the treatment mice are 2.02 times more likely to survive than placebo mice, but this was not statistically significant with p = 0.089. Nine percent more treatment mice survived than placebo mice. The investigators accustomed to handling rodents noted that mouse recovery seemed substantially faster in the treatment mice than in the placebo mice.",

The aim of this substudy was to determine the effects of carvedilol on left ventricular remodeling in this patient group.", 
    "178": "Patients entering the CAPRICORN trial from 13 centers in New Zealand, Australia, and Spain were recruited for this echocardiographic substudy. In 127 patients, quantitative 2D echocardiography was performed according to a standard protocol before randomization and repeated after 1, 3, and 6 months of treatment with carvedilol or placebo. Left ventricular volumes, ejection fraction (Simpson's method), and wall motion score index were determined in a blinded analysis at the Core Echo Laboratory. At 6 months, left ventricular end systolic volume was 9.2 mL less in the carvedilol group than in the placebo group (P=0.023), and left ventricular ejection fraction was 3.9% higher (P=0.015). Left ventricular end diastolic volume and wall motion score index were not statistically different between the 2 groups at 6 months.",

    "180": "Patients with diabetes are at high risk for the development of coronary artery disease and have a significantly impaired prognosis after ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) as compared with non-diabetic patients. The beneficial effect of pharmaceutical treatment for secondary prevention after STEMI is proven also for diabetics, but little is known about its use in clinical practice. Between June 1994 and December 2000, consecutive patients with STEMI, admitted to hospital within 24 h of symptoms onset, were enrolled into the multicenter MITRA registry in 61 hospitals in Germany. We examined whether there were differences in the frequencies of pharmaceutical secondary prevention after STEMI and in long-term outcomes between diabetics and nondiabetics in 8206 patients who had been discharged alive and followed for a mean period of 17 months. The prevalence of diabetes in 8206 patients discharged alive after acute STEMI was 18%. Diabetics were older and more often female, and more often already had prior myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke than non-diabetics. As chronic discharge medication, diabetics received aspirin and betablockers less often, but more often ACE inhibitors than non-diabetics. The mortality rate 17 months after STEMI was nearly twice as high in diabetics than in non-diabetics (19.1% vs. 10.4%, p<0.01 at univariate analysis; OR=1.50 and 95% CI 1.27-1.77 at multivariate analysis). The combined endpoint of death, MI and stroke occurred in 25.8% of diabetics, but only in 15.8% of non-diabetics ( p<0.01). Long-term treatment with aspirin, betablockers and ACE inhibitors in diabetics was associated with a significant reduction of mortality. Diabetics received intensive pharmaceutical therapy for secondary prevention significantly less often than non-diabetics, although the beneficial effects of this treatment were similar or even more pronounced as compared with non-diabetics. Diabetes was an independent predictor of increased mortality in follow-up after acute STEMI. Intensifying secondary prevention by a more frequent use of established pharmaceutical regimes might improve the prognosis of diabetics after STEMI and prevent cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events.",

    "182": "Patients with primary open angle glaucoma who had received latanoprost (n = 60) or timolol (n = 60) for 6 months or longer were enrolled and prospectively randomized to receive additional administration of bunazosin or placebo. One hundred twenty eyes of 120 patients were thus divided into 4 subgroups of 30 patients each. Bunazosin was administered twice daily, and timolol or latanoprost was administered per label. The patients were followed up for 3 months. Responders were defined as having a reduction in intraocular pressure of greater than 2 mm Hg from baseline.", 
    "183": "Mean baseline intraocular pressure was 22.3 +/- 3.0 mm Hg in the bunazosin subgroup and 22.3 +/- 3.1 mm Hg in the placebo subgroup of the latanoprost arm, and 22.5 +/- 3.5 mm Hg in the bunazosin subgroup and 22.3 +/- 3.0 mm Hg in the placebo subgroup of the timolol arm. In the bunazosin subgroups of both arms, intraocular pressure was significantly reduced compared with baseline measurements (P < 0.05) with mean intraocular pressure measurement reductions of 2.1 +/- 2.4 mm Hg and 2.8 +/- 2.1 mm Hg in the latanoprost arm and 2.6 +/- 2.1 mm Hg and 2.8 +/- 2.1 mm Hg in the timolol arm at 6 and 12 weeks after the start of the follow-up, respectively. In the latanoprost group, bunazosin provided a further reduction of intraocular pressure (7.7%) at 12 weeks from that initially obtained at 2 weeks (P = 0.0377). In the placebo subgroups of the latanoprost and timolol arms, no significant change was found between at baseline and at any visit after the start of the follow-up. In the latanoprost and timolol arms, there was a significant difference in intraocular pressure and its change between the bunazosin subgroup and placebo subgroup at any visit after 4 weeks from the start of the follow-up (P < 0.01).", 
    "184": "Bunazosin hydrochloride 0.01% may provide an additional intraocular pressure reduction in patients already receiving latanoprost or timolol. Since adding bunazosin to eyes treated with latanoprost caused a relatively small hypotensive response at 2 weeks and provided a further reduction from 2 weeks to 12 weeks, longer than 4 weeks may be required to evaluate a clinically meaningful response to treatment. Further investigation on more cases and longer follow-up are needed.",

    "189": "We investigated the expressional regulation of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D isoforms in rat brain by toluene. Toluene (10 mmol/kg) was injected intraperitoneally into male rats daily for 3 days. CYP2D4 level in the brain was determined by Western blotting. The level of CYP2D4 in the brain and the catalytic activity specific for this isoform were significantly increased by toluene administration. The expressions of CYP2D mRNAs in the brain were quantified by real time PCR. The mRNA level of CYP2D4 increased similar to the expression of the protein and enzymatic activity. These results showed that CYP2D4 was transcriptionally induced by toluene administration for 3 days. This is the first report that subacute exposure to toluene activated the expression of CYP2D4 mRNA in the brain. The response of CYP2D4 expression to toluene is thought to relates to the regulation of the physiological and pharmacological functions of CYP2D isoforms in the brain.",
