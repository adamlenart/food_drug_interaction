She was successfully treated with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting. Maternal and fetal outcome were good. We discuss cardiologic and anaesthetic management of labour and delivery.", 
    "1": "This study was undertaken to define the contributions of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and increased adrenergic activity to the acceleration of ischemic contracture (IC) that occurs in chronic hyperthyroid rat heart. Acute and chronic hyperthyroidism (THYR) were induced by thyroxine administration for 2 and 14 days, respectively, and normal animals (NORM) served as controls. Isolated hearts were perfused in a Langendorff mode. NORM alpha acute, n = 6; THYR alpha acute, n = 8; and THYR alpha, n = 13; and NORM alpha, n = 13 were subjected to 20-min zero-flow global ischemia (I) and 45-min reperfusion (R). Additional THYR and NORM hearts treated with propranolol (prop) were subjected to 30-min I; THYR beta prop, n = 6 and NORM beta prop, n = 8, and THYR beta, n = 6, NORM beta, n = 8 served as controls. Acceleration of IC was measured by the time to peak contracture (Tmax). Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) was assessed by the ratio of left ventricular weight in milligrams (LVW) to animal body weight (BW) in grams. Cardiac hypertrophy developed in chronic but not acute hyperthyroidism. Propranolol reduced the extent of LVH. Contracture occurred earlier in chronic than in acute hyperthyroid and normal hearts. Propranolol did not alter contracture. In conclusion, IC is accelerated by thyroxine administration, and this is probably not due to LVH or increased beta-adrenergic activity. Propranolol diminishes LVH in hyperthyroidism.", 
    "2": "There is strong evidence that autonomic imbalance plays an important role in progression of heart failure. Analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) has achieved substantial acceptance as a noninvasive method for the assessment of autonomic tone. The purpose of this investigation was to study HRV in an experimental model of heart failure using cardiomyopathic (BIO TO.2) hamsters. Animals showed an autonomic imbalance of cardiac control that seems due to attenuation of parasympathetic activity and an enhanced sympathetic tone. The reduction of parasympathetic activity in BIO TO.2 hamsters is suggested by (a) the reduction of the high-frequency (HF) spectrum, and (b) the lack of atropine to generate a response. The increased sympathetic activity is indicated by (a) the decreased time-domain indexes, (b) the increased LF/HF ratio of the power spectrum, and (c) the alteration of HRV indexes induced by propranolol. These results support the notion that in heart failure, there is a similar autonomic imbalance in both human and hamster and suggest that the cardiomyopathic hamster is a suitable experimental model for studying the involvement of the autonomic nervous system in the progression of heart failure.", 
    "3": "Nebivolol is a newer beta1-selective adrenergic receptor antagonist, which unlike classic beta-blockers, lowers systemic vascular resistance by direct vasodilator effects possibly involving NO. This study was designed to determine the effects of nebivolol on small arteries, which contribute to the most part of systemic vascular resistance. Mesenteric arteries, isolated from 9-week-old Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, were studied under perfused and pressurized conditions using a video dimension analyzer. Aortic rings from the same animals were suspended in organ chambers, and isometric tension was measured. Experiments were performed during contraction to prostaglandin F2alpha. In small arteries, nebivolol (10(-9) to 3 x 10(-5) M) induced concentration-dependent relaxations (maximum, 55 +/- 8%). The relaxations were less pronounced as compared with those to acetylcholine (maximum, 99 +/- 2%; p < 0.05), but were significantly greater than those to atenolol (maximum, 2 +/- 0%; p < 0.05). Nebivolol-induced responses were markedly reduced by the NO-synthase inhibitor N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methylester (L-NAME; 10(-4) M; maximum, 11 +/- 2%; p < 0.05). This inhibition could be entirely reversed by pretreatment with L-arginine (10(-3) M; maximum, 46 +/- 7%), a precursor of NO. In contrast to mesenteric arteries, nebivolol did not affect vascular tension of precontracted aortas. These findings indicate that nebivolol induces NO-mediated relaxations in small arteries but not large elastic vessels and therefore, independent of its antihypertensive action, might be effective in protecting the microcirculation in various cardiovascular disease states.", 
    "4": "Two experiments investigated the mechanism for changes in measures of behavioral arousal inhibition in rats following administration of atropine. In Experiment 1, 40-day-old rats were given administrations of atropine sulfate, the alpha-, beta-adrenergic blocker labetalol, or both. The drugs, either alone or in combination, increased transport response intensity, whereas both together increased dorsal immobility durations. In Experiment 2, rats were given atropine, the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine, or a combination of two of the drugs. Propranolol blocked atropine-induced increases in transport response, and phentolamine was without effect. Phentolamine, when combined with atropine, increased dorsal immobility durations. Results are discussed with respect to aspects common to both transport response and dorsal immobility.", 
    "5": "The efficacy of antihypertensive drugs newer than diuretics and beta-blockers has not been established.

Overall mean blood pressure fell from 173/99 mm Hg (SD 14/8) to 138/82 mm Hg (12/7). There was an 8% excess of withdrawals from the nifedipine group because of peripheral oedema (725 vs 518, p<0.0001), but serious adverse events were more frequent in the co-amilozide group (880 vs 796, p=0.02). Deaths were mainly non-vascular (nifedipine 176 vs co-amilozide 172; p=0.81). 80% of the primary events occurred in patients receiving randomised treatment (157 nifedipine, 147 co-amilozide, difference 0.33% [-0.7 to 1.4]).",

    "13": "The effect of epinephrine on the activity of the Na+-K+ ATPase was studied in isolated rat jejunal cells. The activity of the pump was assessed by measuring the ouabain inhibitable K+ accumulation by the enterocytes using 86Rb as a tracer. Epinephrine stimulated significantly the Na+-K+ ATPase in crypt cells but not in villus cells. This effect was still apparent in presence of propranolol and prazocin but disappeared in presence of yohimbine. Amiloride did not affect the epinephrine-induced stimulation. Calcium channel blockers and dibutyryl cAMP enhanced the activity of the pump, and exerted respectively overlapping and additive effects with epinephrine, when added simultaneously. The calcium ionophore A23187 inhibited the basal activity of the ATPase and the stimulatory effect of epinephrine disappeared in its presence. These results suggest that epinephrine stimulates the Na+-K+ ATPase in jejunal crypt cells by activating alpha2 receptors and decreasing intracellular calcium, and not by altering cAMP levels.", 
    "14": "The effect of streptozotocin induced diabetes on autonomic regulation of heart rate and endothelial function was examined in Sprague-Dawley rats. Weanling rats (3-4 weeks of age) of either sex were randomly assigned to a non-diabetic (male 5, female 6) or diabetic (male 4, female 5). Diabetes was induced with a single intraperitoneal (IP) injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 100 mg/kg). Nondiabetic rats received an IP injection of saline. Eight weeks after injection, rats were chronically instrumented with a left jugular venous catheter and a left carotid arterial catheter. After recovery (5 days) cardiac sympathetic tonus, parasympathetic tonus and intrinsic heart rate were determined. On an alternative day, the pressor response to nitric oxide synthase inhibition (NOS-X) was determined in areflexic rats. Cardiac sympathetic tonus (72 +/- 13 vs. 41 +/- 7), parasympathetic tonus (-51 +/- 10 vs. -22 +/- 7), and intrinsic heart rate (368 +/- 6 vs. 292 +/- 9), were reduced in diabetic rats. Furthermore, diabetic rats had a smaller pressor response (A33 +/- 7 vs. A66 +/- 5) to NOS-X. These results document impaired autonomic control of heart rate and endothelial dysfunction in 8-week streptozotocin induced diabetic rats.", 
    "15": "The influence of daily spontaneous running on the sympathetic and parasympathetic components of the spontaneous arterial baroreflex control of heart rate was examined in 22 female spontaneously hypertensive rats [12 sedentary and 10 daily spontaneous running]. Following 8 weeks of sedentary control or daily spontaneous running, animals were chronically instrumented with an arterial catheter. Daily spontaneous running resulted in an increased heart weight/body weight ratio (5.2 +/- 0.27 vs 4.3 +/- 0.01 g/kg) and a resting bradycardia (321+/- 8 bpm vs 360 +/- 6). The spontaneous changes in arterial pressure and the reflex responses of heart rate were examined under three experimental conditions: 1) pre-blockade, 2) following beta1-adrenergic receptor blockade, and 3) following muscarinic-cholinergic receptor blockade. Daily spontaneous running attenuated the spontaneous gain of the arterial baroreflex control of heart rate (56%). After muscarinic-cholinergic receptor blockade, the spontaneous gain remained reduced in daily spontaneous running rats (57%). In contrast, after beta1-adrenergic receptor blockade the spontaneous gain was not different between sedentary control and daily spontaneous running animals. Results demonstrate that daily spontaneous running decreased the sympathetic component resulting in an apparently greater influence of the parasympathetic component on the spontaneous arterial baroreflex control of heart rate.", 
    "16": "There is substantial evidence for an important modulating role of monoamines (catecholamines and serotonin, 5-HT) in the rostral ventral medulla (RVM), a region which plays an important role in cardiovascular and nociceptive functions. We investigated in slices the role of endogenous monoamines in the synaptic control of the activity of rat RVM neuronal populations using intracellular recordings in the lateral RVM plus lateral aspect of nucleus paragigantocellularis lateralis. A triple-labelling protocol allowed us to identify the location of impaled neurons and their eventual monoaminergic phenotype within the serotonergic and catecholaminergic populations of the RVM. Focal electrical stimulation revealed the existence of a functional monoaminergic input onto RVM neurons which was mediated by endogenous 5-HT acting at inhibitory 5-HT1A receptors but did not involve noradrenergic neurotransmission. The slow 5-HT-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) was only observed in the regularly discharging neurons, which were found to be neither catecholaminergic nor serotonergic. The synaptic release of 5-HT was, itself, under an inhibitory control involving GABAA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptors. Moreover, we characterized the effect of the 5-HT-releasing agent fenfluramine on this functional 5-HT-mediated synaptic transmission. Our results show that the effect of fenfluramine is biphasic consisting of an initial prolongation of the serotonergic IPSP followed by a decrease in amplitude. Our data provide a basis for the previously reported inhibitory effects of exogenously applied serotonin agonists/antagonists on the autonomic functions controlled by the RVM. This 5-HT pathway, which functionally links the serotonergic and catecholaminergic regions, might play an important role in cardiovascular and nociceptive functions.", 
    "17": "A reduced ability to increase cardiac output (CO) during exercise limits blood flow by vasoconstriction even in active skeletal muscle. Such a flow limitation may also take place in the brain as an increase in the transcranial Doppler determined middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCA V(mean)) is attenuated during cycling with beta-1 adrenergic blockade and in patients with heart insufficiency. We studied whether sympathetic blockade at the level of the neck (0.1% lidocaine; 8 mL; n=8) affects the attenuated exercise - MCA V(mean following cardio-selective beta-1 adrenergic blockade (0.15 mg kg(-1) metoprolol i.v.) during cycling. Cardiac output determined by indocyanine green dye dilution, heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and MCA V(mean) were obtained during moderate intensity cycling before and after pharmacological intervention. During control cycling the right and left MCA V(mean) increased to the same extent (11.4 +/- 1.9 vs. 11.1 +/- 1.9 cm s(-1)). With the pharmacological intervention the exercise CO (10 +/- 1 vs. 12 +/- 1 L min(-1); n=5), HR (115 +/- 4 vs. 134 +/- 4 beats min(-1)) and delta MCA V(mean) (8.7 +/- 2.2 vs. 11.4 +/- 1.9 cm s(-1) were reduced, and MAP was increased (100 +/- 5 vs. 86 +/- 2 mmHg; P < 0.05). However, sympathetic blockade at the level of the neck eliminated the beta-1 blockade induced attenuation in delta MCA V(mean) (10.2 +/- 2.5 cm s(-1)). These results indicate that a reduced ability to increase CO during exercise limits blood flow to a vital organ like the brain and that this flow limitation is likely to be by way of the sympathetic nervous system.", 
    "18": "Noradrenaline release, graded by frequency variation of field stimulation (0.1-2 Hz), in atrial myocardial specimens (n=45) from children (n=21) with congenital heart defects, was used to examine the inotropic responses of graded, receptor-selective, endogenous stimulation. Muscle trabeculae subjected to autonomic blockage by timolol, prazosin and atropine showed a slight positive force-frequency relationship (staircase phenomenon). Blockage by atropine/prazosin (i.e. beta-adrenoceptor stimulation) or atropine/timolol (i.e. alpha1-adrenoceptor stimulation) both resulted in positive inotropic effects. A group of specimens opposed by atropine and primarily subjected to frequency variation, secondly was returned to 1 Hz. Stabilization was followed by sequential reversal by beta-blocker (timolol), alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation by exogenous noradrenaline, reversal by alpha 1-blocker (prazosin), and finally supramaximal beta-adrenoceptor stimulation (isoprenaline). The maximal levels of inotropic responses mediated by exogenous alpha 1- and beta-adrenoceptor stimulation was estimated. Analysis of the contraction-relaxation cycles revealed that alpha1- and beta-adrenoceptors were recruited differentially. The alpha1-adrenoceptor mediated, endogenous inotropic effect at 1 Hz was close to the level obtained by exogenous noradrenaline stimulation. In contrast, less than 70% of the beta-adrenoceptor mediated, exogenous inotropic effect was expressed by endogenous noradrenaline at the same stimulating frequency, thus indicating that the alpha1-adrenoceptors may be located closer to the adrenergic nerve terminals than the beta-adrenoceptors. There may be a heterogeneous relationship within the same heart as to the relative distance between the nerve terminals and the adrenoceptors. Spatial localization of adrenergic receptors relative to adrenergic nerve terminals adds another aspect to adrenergic regulation. The alpha1-adrenoceptor pathway may play an important role, especially in low-intensity sympathetic inotropic myocardial control, whereas the beta-adrenoceptor pathway adds important effects to the high-intensity sympathetic regulation. Sympathetic activity may thus tonically stimulate the alpha1-adrenoceptor pathway, without necessarily stimulating the beta-adrenoceptor pathway to the same extent.", 
    "19": "Gender differences and seasonal variations in cardiac electrophysiology and susceptibility to arrhythmias have been described clinically. The present study was undertaken to determine if there are similar gender and seasonally related differences in the electrophysiology of the rabbit heart.", 
    "20": "We analyzed epicardial electrograms, left ventricular endocardial monophasic action potentials (MAPs), and simulated X and Y lead ECGs from 145 isolated rabbit hearts studied over a period of 41 months. Hearts from males had seasonal increases in the duration of myocardial recovery. During the months of June to September compared with October to January and February to May, epicardial activation-recovery intervals (231.6+/-23.4 vs 215.6+/-19.2 and 213.5+/-18.8 msec, P = 0.003), MAP durations (256.5+/-25.4 vs 237.0+/-19.6 and 230.7+/-26.4 msec, P < 0.001), and QT intervals (278.3+/-25.6 vs 267.3+/-11.8 and 261.3+/-13.0 msec, P = 0.037) were longer. Overall, hearts from females had shorter QT intervals than males (257.7+/-15.7 vs 270.1+/-20.3 msec, P < 0.001), and this difference was reflected in their shorter epicardial activation-recovery intervals and MAP durations. However, hearts from females showed a greater prolongation of epicardial recovery (P = 0.007) and greater incidence of arrhythmias (P < 0.001) with sotalol than males. Also, the incidence of arrhythmias was greater in the winter months October to May (P < 0.001).",

These differences may be related to variation in the expression of or regulation of the membrane ion channels mediating repolarization.", 
    "22": "Left ventricular dysfunction is often reversed after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery; however, this change is not easily predicted. The authors hypothesized that functional changes after a low dose of dobutamine (5 microgram. kg-1. min-1) intraoperatively would predict functional changes when complete revascularization was achieved.", 
    "23": "The authors analyzed 560 segments in 40 patients scheduled for elective CABG surgery for regional wall motion (1-5 scoring system) at four stages: baseline (after induction and intubation), with administration of low-dose dobutamine before cardiopulmonary bypass, after separation from cardiopulmonary bypass (early), and after administration of protamine (late). Two independent observers scored the myocardial regions according to a 16-segment model in multiple imaging planes. For each segment, the response to dobutamine was dichotomized as improved or not improved from baseline and analyzed with logistic regression. The influence of covariates (ejection fraction, myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, and beta blockers) was also determined with logistic regression models. P < 0.05 was considered significant.", 
    "24": "Changes in myocardial function after low-dose dobutamine were highly predictive for early (P < 0.0001) and late (P < 0.0001) changes in myocardial function from baseline regional scores. The overall odds ratio for early and late improvement increased by 20.7 and 34.6, respectively, when improvement was observed after low-dose dobutamine was administered. The overall positive predictive value of improved regional wall motion after CABG did not vary with left ventricular ejection fraction, a history of myocardial infarction, or beta blocker use, and it varied little with diabetic status (range, 0.86-0.96) if regional wall motion improved with low-dose dobutamine before CABG. The overall negative predictive value was 0.70; however, the range varied with diabetic status (i.e., lowest in diabetic patients and highest in nondiabetic patients).",

    "26": "In the present study, the beta-adrenoceptor subtypes distributed in the detrusor of the ferret were investigated in functional experiments in vitro and in vivo using a variety of beta-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists. All the beta-adrenoceptor agonists tested relaxed the isolated detrusor strip, the rank order of potency being (+/-)-(R*, R*)-[4-[2-[[2-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl]-amino]propyl]phenoxy]- acetic acid sodium (BRL 37344A)>(+/-)-4-(3-t-butylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy) benzimidazol-2-one (CGP-12177A), isoprenaline and (R, R)-5-[2-[[2-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethylamino]propyl]-1, 3-benzodioxole-2,2-dicarboxylate (CL 316,243)>dobutamine and procaterol. In antagonist experiment, 3-(2-allylphenoxy)-1-[(1S)-1,2, 3,4-tetrahydro-naphth-1-ylamino]-(2S)-2-propanol hydrochloride (SR 58894A), but neither 2-hydroxy-5(2-((2-hydroxy-3-(4-((1-methyl-4-trifluoromethyl)1H-imidaz ole-2-yl)-phenoxy)propyl)amino)ethoxy)-benzamide monomethane sulphonate (CGP-20712A) nor erythro-(+/-)-1-(7-methylindan-4-yloxy)-3-isopropylaminob utan-2-ol hydrochloride (ICI-118,551), caused a rightward shift of the concentration-relaxation curve for isoprenaline. In in vivo experiments, isoprenaline and CL 316,243 each reduced bladder pressure in a dose-dependent manner. CL 316,243 was the only drug that did not produce any significant influences on blood pressure and heart rate at doses that reduced bladder pressure. The present functional study provides the first evidence that relaxation of the ferret detrusor by beta-adrenoceptor activation is mediated mainly via the beta(3)-adrenoceptor, as in the human detrusor.", 
    "27": "The partial agonist activities of carteolol were investigated on atypical beta-adrenoceptors of duodenum on the guinea pig. Carteolol produced a concentration-dependent relaxation of the guinea pig duodenum (pD(2)=4.85), which was not significantly affected by propranolol (1 microM). In the presence of propranolol (1 microM), however, the non-selective beta(1)-, beta(2)- and beta(3)-adrenoceptor antagonist, bupranolol (30 microM), caused a rightward shift of the concentration-response curves for carteolol (apparent pA(2)=5.31). Moreover, carteolol (10 microM) weakly, but significantly, antagonized the relaxations in response to catecholamines (isoprenaline, noradrenaline and adrenaline), to a selective beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonist, (R*, R*)-(+/-)-4-[2-[(2-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl)amino]propyl]pheno xyacetic acid sodium salt (BRL37344), and to a non-conventional partial beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonist, [4-[3-[(1, 1-dimethylethyl)amino]-2-hydroxypropoxy]-1, 3-dihydro-2H-benzimidazol-2-one] hydrochloride (CGP12177A), also in the guinea pig duodenum (apparent pA(2)=5.77, 5.92, 6.05, 6.56 and 5. 58, respectively).

    "28": "Despite ample in vitro evidence that myofilament Ca(2+)-responsiveness of stunned myocardium is decreased, in vivo data are inconclusive. Conversely, while Ca(2+)-sensitizing agents increase myofilament Ca(2+)-responsiveness in vitro, it has been questioned whether this also occurs in vivo. We therefore tested in open-chest anesthetized pigs whether EMD 57033 (the (+) enantiomer of 5-[1-(3,4-dimethoxybenzoyl)-1,2,3, 4-tetrahydro-6-quinolyl]-6-methyl-3,6-dihydro-2H-1,3, 4-thiadiazin-2-one) increases responsiveness to Ca(2+) of non-stunned myocardium and restores function of stunned myocardium by normalizing the responsiveness to Ca(2+). Studies were performed under beta-adrenoceptor blockade to minimize the contribution of the phosphodiesterase-III inhibitory actions of EMD 57033. Consecutive intracoronary Ca(2+) infusions were used to evaluate the contractile response (assessed by the left ventricular end-systolic elastance, E(es)) to added Ca(2+) of non-stunned myocardium and myocardium stunned by 15 min coronary artery occlusion and 30 min reperfusion. In non-stunned propranolol-treated myocardium, the Ca(2+) infusions doubled E(es) (baseline 6.9+/-0.9 mmHg mm(-2), n=8). Following Ca(2+)-washout, subsequent EMD 57033 infusion (0.1 mg kg(-1) min(-1), i.v.) tripled E(es) (P<0.05) and potentiated the Ca(2+)-induced increase in E(es) to 55.7+/-10.0 mmHg mm(-2) (P<0.05). Stunning (n=7) decreased E(es) to 5.3+/-0.6 mmHg mm(-2) (P>0.10) and attenuated the Ca(2+)-induced increase in E(es) (P<0.05). Subsequent infusion of EMD 57033 increased E(es) to 6.8+/-1.8 mmHg mm(-2) (P<0. 05) and restored responsiveness to added Ca(2+). These in vivo findings are consistent with the in vitro observations that myofilament Ca(2+)-responsiveness of stunned myocardium is reduced and that EMD 57033 increases contractility by enhancing myofilament Ca(2+)-responsiveness.", 
    "29": "Many older people do not receive beta-blocker therapy after myocardial infarction or receive doses lower than those tested in trials, perhaps because physicians fear that beta-blockers may precipitate heart failure. We examined the relation between use of beta-blockers, the dose used, and hospital admission for heart failure and 1-year survival in a cohort of all older patients surviving myocardial infarction in Ontario, Canada.", 
    "30": "We collected data on a cohort of 13,623 patients aged 66 years or older who were discharged from hospital after a myocardial infarction and who did not receive beta-blocker therapy or received low, standard, or high doses.

Among the 4681 patients prescribed beta-blockers, the risk of admission was greater in the high-dose than in the low-dose group (1.53 [1.01-2.31]). Among all 13,623 patients in the cohort, 2326 (17.1%) died by 1 year. Compared with those not dispensed beta-blocker therapy, the adjusted risk ratio for mortality was lower for all three doses (low 0.40 [0.34-0.47], standard 0.36 [0.31-0.42], high 0.43 [0.33-0.56]).",

    "33": "Increases in glucose concentration control the transcription of the preproinsulin (PPI) gene and several other genes in the pancreatic islet beta-cell. Although recent data have demonstrated that secreted insulin may regulate the PPI gene (Leibiger, I. B., Leibiger, B., Moede, T., and Berggren, P. O. (1998) Mol. Cell 1, 933-938), the role of insulin in the control of other beta-cell genes is unexplored. To study the importance of insulin secretion in the regulation of the PPI and liver-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) genes by glucose, we have used intranuclear microinjection of promoter-luciferase constructs into MIN6 beta-cells and photon-counting imaging. The activity of each promoter was increased either by 30 (versus 3) mm glucose or by 1-20 nm insulin. These effects of insulin were not due to enhanced glucose metabolism since culture with the hormone had no impact on the stimulation of increases in intracellular ATP concentration caused by 30 mm glucose. Furthermore, the islet-specific glucokinase promoter and cellular glucokinase immunoreactivity were unaffected by 30 mm glucose or 20 nm insulin. Inhibition of insulin secretion with the Ca(2+) channel blocker verapamil, the ATP-sensitive K(+) channel opener diazoxide, or the alpha(2)-adrenergic agonist clonidine blocked the effects of glucose on L-PK gene transcription. Similarly, 30 mm glucose failed to induce the promoter after inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase activity with LY294002 and the expression of dominant negative-acting phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (Deltap85) or the phosphoinositide 3'-phosphatase PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue). LY294002 also diminished the activation of the L-PK gene caused by inhibition of 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase with anti-5'-AMP-activated protein kinase alpha2 antibodies. Conversely, stimulation of insulin secretion with 13 mm KCl or 10 microm tolbutamide strongly activated the PPI and L-PK promoters. These data indicate that, in MIN6 beta-cells, stimulation of insulin secretion is important for the activation by glucose of L-PK as well as the PPI promoter, but does not cause increases in glucokinase gene expression or glucose metabolism.",

    "43": "The beta-adrenoceptor blocker propranolol stimulated testosterone secretion by rat testicular interstitial cells (Leydig cell-enriched preparation) in vitro at concentrations ranging from 10(-5) M to 10(-4) M. Treatment of these cells with H7 (20 microM), an inhibitor of protein kinase C, reduced the stimulatory effect of L-propranolol on testosterone secretion by about 5-fold. At concentrations ranging from 31.25 microM to 1000 microM, L-propranolol reduced [3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate binding (IC50 = 75 microM) to rat testicular interstitial cells. At similar concentrations, L-propranolol displaced the binding of [3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate to the homogenate of these cells by only 5%. These findings suggest that the effect of L-propranolol on [3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate binding could be indirect, possibly by increasing the concentration of a chemical mediator interacting with the regulatory domain of protein kinase C. At even lower concentrations (10(-9) M to 10(-7) M), propranolol added directly to the reaction mixture with protein kinase C partially purified from rat testicular interstitial cells increases the phosphorylation of histone. This phosphorylation was comparable to that obtained with (25 microg/ml) phosphatidylserine. The D- and L-stereoisomers of propranolol were equally active. A complete reversal of this propranolol effect on histone phosphorylation was achieved with (20 microM) H-7. In the absence of Ca2+, propranolol was not able to phosphorylate the histone. Taken together, these results suggest that protein kinase C could be the putative kinase involved in this reaction and that its activation by propranolol may be due to interaction of the drug with the regulatory domain of the enzyme at a site differing from the site of interaction with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate. The ability of propranolol to activate the putative protein kinase C could be related to its stimulatory effect on testosterone secretion by Leydig cells.",

Infusion (0.6 mg/kg/min) in male beagles (n = 5) to a maximum dose of 54 mg/kg increased QTc more than 20 ms at 2.0 mg/kg. At a dose of 8.9 mg/kg i.v., QTc increased 34% above baseline and remained elevated throughout the subsequent infusion and for at least 60 min postinfusion. At this maximum class III dose, azimilide increased heart contractile force (HCF) 10% and +dP/dt 34% and decreased heart rate (HR) 12%, without significantly changing mean blood pressure (MBP), left ventricular end diastolic pressure, -dP/dt, stroke volume (SV), or cardiac output (CO). At the mean maximum 47 mg/kg i.v. dose, QTc remained elevated, but decreases were observed in HCF (-27%), +dP/dt (-24%), -dP/dt (-35%), SV (-16%), and CO (-52%). Cumulative intravenous bolus injections of azimilide (0.3, 1, 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg) in male mongrels (n = 5) increased effective refractory period (ERP) and +dP/dt (18% and 16%, respectively, at 10 mg/kg) as a function of dose and significantly decreased HR (-22% at 10 mg/kg). MBP decreased significantly (-23%) only at the highest dose. Ventricular fibrillation threshold (VFT) was unchanged at 30 mg/kg. Effects of dl- (n = 3) and d-sotalol (n = 4) on ERP and HR were similar to azimilide's, but both compounds caused a greater MBP depression and VFT elevation. These results suggest that azimilide is well tolerated by the cardiovascular system, providing an increase in contractility and a slight decrease in HR at intravenous doses that produced a large or maximum increase in cardiac refractoriness.",

After epinephrine treatment, a 1.2-fold increase of lactate formation and a 20 per cent decrease of ATP concentration was found under normoxic conditions. These effects were rapid and specific to beta, alpha(1) and alpha(2) antagonists. Glycolysis was stimulated to almost the same extent by both epinephrine and forskolin as normoxic conditions. The stimulation of glycolysis was probably due to stimulation of phosphofructokinase (PFK) as well as to activation of Na(+), K(+)-ATPase. The decrease of ATP was a contributing factor to PFK activation. Despite the high levels of c-AMP at hypoxia, glycolysis was not further induced by epinephrine.",

On examination, visual acuity was no light perception OD and hand motion OS. Intraocular pressures were 33 mm Hg OU.

Seventeen normal healthy volunteers (without medication), 7 cataract patients (treated with pyrenoxine eyedrops) and 7 glaucoma or ocular hypertension patients (treated with 0.5% timolol maleate) were assigned to this study. The eyedrops had been used on a daily basis for at least 3 months. In the evaluation of corneal epithelial barrier function, fluorescein uptake was measured using a slitlamp fluorophotometer after application of 3 microl of 0.5% fluorescein for 10 min. In the evaluation of the superficial cell area, the central corneal epithelium was measured by tandem scanning confocal microscopy (TSCM). The healthy control and timolol groups were compared. Corneal fluorescein uptake in the healthy control, pyrenoxine and timolol groups was 20.3 +/- 3.2, 21.5 +/- 4.0 and 76.2 +/- 30.0 ng/ml (mean +/- standard error), respectively. There was a significantly higher fluorescein uptake in the timolol group compared to the pyrenoxine group (p = 0.0088) and the healthy control group (p = 0.0055). TSCM showed no significant difference in the superficial cell areas of the corneal epithelium between the healthy control and timolol groups. beta-Blocker eyedrops decreased the corneal epithelial barrier function.

    "48": "Previous work in the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor demonstrated critical interactions between Ser-204 and Ser-207 in the fifth membrane-spanning segment and the meta-OH and para-OH, respectively, of catecholamine agonists (Strader, C. D., Candelore, M. R., Hill, W. S., Sigal, I. S., and Dixon, R. A. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 13572-13578). Using the substituted cysteine accessibility method in the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor, we have found that in addition to Ser-204 and Ser-207, Ser-203 is also accessible on the surface of the binding-site crevice and is occluded by bound agonist. Mutation of Ser-203 to Ala, Val, or Cys reduced the binding affinity and adenylyl cyclase-activating potency of agonists containing a meta-OH, whereas their affinities and potencies were largely preserved by mutation of Ser-203 to Thr, which maintained an OH at this position. Thus both Ser-203 and Ser-204 appear to interact with the meta-OH of catecholamines, perhaps through a bifurcated H bond. Furthermore, the removal of the OH at position 203 led to a significant loss of affinity of antagonists with nitrogen in their heterocyclic ring structure. The greatest effect was seen with pindolol, a partial agonist, suggesting that a H bond between the heterocyclic ring and Ser-203 may play a role in partial agonism. In contrast, the affinities of antagonists such as propranolol or alprenolol, which have cyclic structures without H-bonding capability, were unaltered after mutation of Ser-203.", 
    "49": "Tetrahydropapaveroline (THP), a condensation product of ethanol-derived acetaldehyde, potentiates cardiac function through a beta-adrenergic mechanism. It is well established that beta-adrenergic activity is markedly depressed in hypertension. However, little is known about the myocardial action of THP in hypertension. In this study, the effect of THP was examined using left ventricular papillary muscles and ventricular myocytes from 10-week-old normotensive (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats. The mechanical parameters evaluated include: peak tension developed (PTD), peak twitch amplitude (PTA), time-to-PTD/PTA (TPT/TPS), time-to-90% relaxation/relengthening (RT(90)/TR(90)), and the maximal velocities of contraction/shortening and relaxation/relengthening (+/-VT/+/-dL/dt). Intracellular Ca(2+) transients were measured as fura-2 fluorescence intensity changes (delta FFI). THP (0.01-100 microM) produced a concentration-dependent increase in myocardial contraction on muscles and myocytes from both groups of animals. However, preparations from the SHR group were generally less responsive to THP than their normotensive counterparts. The increase in contractility by THP was associated with increases in delta FFI and +/-VT, and shortening of TPT/TPS and RT(90)/TR(90). The role of beta-adrenoceptor(s) in the mechanism of action of THP was explored using specific beta-receptor subtype antagonists CGP 207.12A (beta(1)) and ICI 118,551 (beta(2)). In preparations from both WKY and SHR hearts, the THP-induced increase in cardiac contractility was either attenuated or blocked by CGP 207. 12A and ICI 118,551. These results indicate that THP exhibits a positive action on myocardial contraction that is mediated, in part, through both beta(1) and beta(2) adrenergic receptors. This cardiac inotropic response, however, is markedly diminished in hypertension, which is due possibly to alterations in beta-adrenergic signal transduction.",

Removal of endothelium potentiated the contractile responses to H(2)O(2) and to ATP. H(2)O(2) (30 microM)-induced phasic contraction could be abolished by catalase (800 U/ml), but not affected by SOD (150 U/ml), DMSO (5 mM) and apyrase (5 U/ml), suggesting no involvement of O(2)(-), hydroxyl free radicals and ATP release. Also, several receptor antagonists including phentolamine, atropine, methysergide and chlorpheniramine (each 3 microM) were without effect on H(2)O(2) (30 microM)-induced phasic contraction, suggesting no involvement of typical neurotransmitter release. However, both H(2)O(2) (30 microM) and ATP (1 mM)-induced phasic contractions not only presented homologous desensitization, but also showed heterogeneous desensitization. Furthermore, the phasic contractions in response to H(2)O(2) (30 microM) or ATP (100 microM) could be inhibited or abolished in a concentration dependent manner by RB-2 and suramin (10-100 microM), two widely used P(2)-purinoceptor antagonists, with only partial inhibition by Evans blue (300 microM), a moderately selective P(2x) receptor blocker, or by alpha-beta-methylene-ATP (100 microM), a selective P(2x) receptor desensitizer. On the other hand, both H(2)O(2) (30 microM) and ATP (100 microM)-induced phasic contractions were also attenuated, to different degree, by inhibitors of several enzymes including PLC, PKC, PLA(2) and cyclooxygenase. Lastly, removal of extracellular Ca(2+) or pretreatment with procaine (10 mM) and dantrolene (30 microM), two putative intracellular Ca(2+) release blockers, or with Ni(2+) (100 microM) and tetrandrine (5 microM), two Ca(2+) channel blockers, all significantly inhibited H(2)O(2) and ATP-induced contractions.

    "55": "Isolated rabbit hearts, subjected to aerobic perfusion, or low-flow ischaemia followed by reperfusion, were treated with two doses of carvedilol, one dose (2.0 microM) with marked negative inotropic effect due to beta-blockage and the other (0.1 microM) with no beta-blockage nor negative inotropism. Carvedilol was compared with two doses of propranolol, 1.0 - without - and 5.0 microM - with negative inotropic effect. Anti-oxidant activity was measured as the capacity to counteract the occurrence of oxidative stress and myocardium viability as recovery of left ventricular function on reperfusion, membrane damage and energetic status.", 
    "56": "Carvedilol counteracted the ischemia and reperfusion induced oxidative stress: myocardial content of reduced glutathione, protein and non-protein sulfhydryl groups after ischaemia and particularly after reperfusion, was higher in hearts treated with carvedilol, while the myocardial content of oxidised glutathione was significantly reduced (0.30+/-0.03 and 0.21+/-0.02 vs. 0.39+/-0.03 nmol/mg prot, both P<0.01, in 0.1 and 2.0 microM). At the same time, carvedilol improved myocardium viability independently from its beta-blocking effect. On the contrary, propranolol maintained viability only at the higher dose, although to a lesser extent than carvedilol. This suggests that the effects of propranolol are dependent on energy saving due to negative inotropism. The extra-protection observed with carvedilol at both doses is likely due to its anti-oxidant effect.",

In addition, futile deacetylation, determined by the replacement of 13C-labelled acetyl groups with endogenous 12C-acetyls accounted for approximately 7-10% of the urinary metabolites, corresponding to approximately 5% of the dose undergoing N-deacetylation. 3. Evidence for chiral metabolism was sought via NMR of isolated metabolites using beta-cyclodextrin as a chiral shift agent. Practolol was excreted as a racemate. However, some enantioselective metabolism/excretion had occurred as the hydroxy- and hydroxyglucuronide were not excreted as racemic mixtures. 4.

    "59": "Patients with diabetes constitute a large group among patients with ischaemic heart disease, and their risk of repeated cardiovascular events is large. Due to this, there is increasing focus on intervention against the increased risk of cardiac morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes. Subgroup analyses of patients with diabetes from studies on patients with ischaemic heart disease show that intervention with thrombolysis, aspirin, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors and statins have similar relative benefit among patients with diabetes, but because of the greater risk in these patients, the absolute benefit is increased. In spite of this, intervention is less common among patients with diabetes, a fact that should be corrected. Direct intervention targeted at the metabolic disorder in ischaemic heart disease has only been investigated in the DIGAMI study, where glucose/insulin treatment followed by long term treatment with insulin was compared to conventional treatment. The mortality was lower in the insulin treated group after one to four years of follow up, a promising result which is currently being investigated in the DIGAMI-2 study.", 
    "60": "Preclinical studies in rodents suggest that augmentation of serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) therapy by the 5-hydroxytryptamine(1A) (5-HT(1A)) receptor agent pindolol might reduce the delay between initiation of treatment and antidepressant response. This hypothesis is based on the ability of pindolol to potentiate the increase in serotonin (5-HT) transmission induced by SSRIs, an effect achieved by blockade of the 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors in the dorsal raphe nuclei (DRN). However, placebo-controlled clinical studies of pindolol augmentation of antidepressant therapy have reported inconsistent results. Here, we evaluated the occupancy of 5-HT(1A) receptors following treatment with controlled release pindolol in nine healthy volunteers with positron-emission tomography (PET). Each subject was studied four times: at baseline (scan 1), following 1 week of oral administration of pindolol CR (7.5 mg/day) at peak level, 4 h after the dose (scan 2), and at 10 h following the dose (scan 3), and following one dose of pindolol CR (30 mg) (at peak level, 4 h) (scan 4). Pindolol occupancy of 5-HT(1A) receptors was evaluated in the DRN and cortical regions as the decrease in binding potential (BP) of the radiolabelled selective 5-HT(1A) antagonist [carbonyl-(11)C]WAY-100635 or [carbonyl-(11)C] N-(2-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl)ethyl)-N-(2-pyridyl)cyclohexa necarboxamide abbreviated as [(11)C]WAY-100635. Pindolol dose-dependently decreased [(11)C]WAY-100635 BP. Combining all the regions, occupancy was 20 +/- 8% at scan 2, 14 +/- 8% at scan 3, and 44 +/- 8% at scan 4. The results of this study suggest that at doses used in clinical studies of augmentation of the SSRI effect by pindolol (2.5 mg t.i.d.), the occupancy of 5-HT(1A) receptors is moderate and highly variable between subjects. This factor might explain the variable results obtained in clinical studies. On the other hand, at each dose tested, pindolol occupancy of 5-HT(1A) receptors was higher in the DRN compared to cortical regions, demonstrating a significant in vivo selectivity for DRN 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors relative to cortico-limbic postsynaptic receptors. This selectivity is necessary for the potentiation of 5-HT transmission, and this finding represents an important proof of concept in the development of 5-HT(1A) agents for this application. Early evaluation of new drugs with PET imaging will enable rapid screening of compounds based on DRN selectivity and more appropriate determination of doses for clinical trials.", 
    "61": "Positron-emission tomography (PET) provides potential in neuropsychiatric drug development by expanding knowledge of drug action in the living human brain and reducing time consumption and costs. The 5-hydroxytryptamine(1A) (5-HT(1A)) receptor is of central interest as a target for the treatment of anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia. Research on the clinical significance of the 5-HT(1A) receptor now benefits from the highly selective radioligand [carbonyl-(11)C]WAY-100635 (WAY) for quantitative determination of 5-HT(1A) receptors in the primate and human brain in vivo using PET. In this paper, three studies are reviewed to demonstrate the suitability of WAY as radioligand for quantification of central 5-HT(1A) receptors in brain and as an applicable tool for drug development. In the first study a monkey model was used to characterize WAY binding. It was confirmed that the reference ligand 8-OH-DPAT and psychoactive drugs such as buspirone and pindolol occupies 5-HT(1A) receptors in the primate brain. Pindolol is an beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist with a high affinity to 5-HT(1A) receptors. This drug has been suggested in combination with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for the treatment of depression and was given to healthy males in the second study. Pindolol induced a marked inhibition of central 5-HT(1A) receptors as calculated by the ratio-analysis method and simplified reference tissue model, 2 h after administration of 10 mg as a single oral dose. This observation suggests that pindolol may have a role for the suggested potentiation of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment of depression. The third study was on robalzotan (NAD-299), a recently developed 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist and putative drug with implications for the treatment of depression. In the cynomolgus monkey brain, robalzotan in the dose range 2-100 microg/kg IV occupied 5-HT(1A) receptors in a dose-dependent and saturable manner with a maximal calculated occupancy of 70-80%. The relationship between robalzotan plasma concentration and 5-HT(1A) receptor occupancy could be described by a hyperbolic function that was used to guide the selection of appropriate doses in man. In a subsequent PET study of robalzotan binding to 5-HT(1A) receptors in the living human brain, similar results have been replicated recently. These studies reviewed here illustrate and corroborate that quantitative neuroimaging of receptor binding has potential for the evaluation and dose finding of new central nervous system drugs.", 
    "62": "Elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) serum levels, an exquisitely sensitive objective marker of inflammation, relate to long-term prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease and in apparently healthy men.

    "63": "Endothelium-dependent (10 to 50 microg/min acetylcholine) and endothelium-independent (2 to 8 microg/min sodium nitroprusside) forearm blood flow responses were measured with venous occlusion plethysmography in 60 male patients with angiographically documented coronary artery disease. Forearm blood flow responses to acetylcholine were inversely correlated with CRP serum levels (r=-0.46, P:=0.001). With multivariate analysis that included the classic risk factors for coronary artery disease, elevated CRP serum level remained a statistically significant independent predictor of a blunted endothelial vasodilator capacity. Most important, normalization of elevated CRP levels over time was associated with a normalization of endothelium-mediated forearm blood flow responses after 3 months.", 
    "64": "Thus, elevated CRP serum levels indicative of a systemic inflammatory response are associated with a blunted systemic endothelial vasodilator function.

    "65": "In the present study, the action of PACAP 38 on one-way passive avoidance learning was investigated. PACAP-38 was administered into the lateral brain ventricle and the latency of the passive avoidance response was measured 24 h later. In order to study the possible roles of various neurotransmitters in mediating the action of PACAP on the consolidation of passive avoidance learning, the animals were pre-treated with receptor blockers in doses that per se proved to be ineffective. PACAP facilitated the learning, the consolidation of learning and the retrieval of the passive avoidance response. The following receptor blockers attenuated the action of PACAP on this consolidation: haloperidol, phenoxybenzamine, propranolol and methysergide. An antagonist of PACAP 38, PACAP 6-38, and also nitro-L-arginine (the latter blocks the enzyme nitric oxide synthase) thereby inhibiting the formation of NO from L-arginine, completely blocked the action of PACAP 38 on consolidation. The following receptor blockers were ineffective: naloxone, bicuculline and atropine. The presented data suggest that PACAP 38 is able to improve the learning and memory processes in a passive avoidance paradigm. In this action, the PACAP 38 receptor and NO are important mediators. Dopaminergic, alpha- and beta-adrenergic mediation and serotonin receptors modified the action of PACAP 38, but they are probably not of great importance.",

Sucralfate is a mucosal protector. The effects of combinations of beta-blocker, band ligation, and sucralfate (triple therapy) remain unknown. A total of 122 patients with a history of esophageal variceal bleeding were randomized to receive EVL only (group A, 62 patients) or triple therapy (group B, 60 patients). The procedure for the triple therapy included ligation with the addition of sucralfate granules until variceal obliteration. In addition, nadolol was administered during the course of the study or until death. After a median follow-up of 21 months, recurrent upper gastrointestinal bleeding developed in 29 patients (47%) in group A and 14 patients (23%) in group B (P =.005). Recurrent bleeding from esophagogastric varices occurred in 18 patients in group A and 7 patients in group B (P =.001). Twenty-one patients in group A (50%) and 12 patients (26%) in group B experienced variceal recurrence after variceal obliteration (P <.05). Treatment failure occurred in 11 patients (18%) in group A and in 4 patients (7%) in group B (P =.05). Twenty patients from group A and 10 patients from group B died (P =.08); 9 and 4 of these deaths, respectively, were attributed to variceal hemorrhage (P =.26). The combination of ligation, nadolol, and sucralfate (triple therapy) proved more effective than banding ligation alone in terms of prevention of variceal recurrence and upper gastrointestinal rebleeding as well as variceal rebleeding.", 
    "67": "The loss of intrinsic neurons is an early event in inflammation of the rat intestine that precedes the growth of intestinal smooth muscle cells (ISMC). To study this relationship, we cocultured ISMC and myenteric plexus neurons from the rat small intestine and examined the effect of scorpion venom, a selective neurotoxin, on ISMC growth. By 5 days after neuronal ablation, ISMC number increased to 141+/-13% (n = 6) and the uptake of [(3)H]thymidine in response to mitogenic stimulation was nearly doubled. Atropine caused a dose-dependent increase in [(3)H]thymidine uptake in cocultures, suggesting the involvement of neural stimulation of cholinergic receptors in regulation of ISMC growth. In contrast, coculture of ISMC with sympathetic neurons increased [(3)H]thymidine uptake by 45-80%, which was sensitive to propranolol (30 microM) and was lost when the neurons were separated from ISMC by a permeable filter. Western blotting showed that coculture with myenteric neurons increased alpha-smooth muscle-specific actin nearly threefold to a level close to ISMC in vivo. Therefore, factors derived from enteric neurons maintain the phenotype of ISMC through suppression of the growth response, whereas catecholamines released by neurons extrinsic to the intestine may stimulate their growth. Thus inflammation-induced damage to intestinal innervation may initiate or modulate ISMC hyperplasia.", 
    "68": "Constitutive activity of the beta(2)-adrenoceptor, which is sensitive to inhibition by an inverse agonist such as ICI 118551, has been readily demonstrated in recombinant systems expressing constitutively-active mutant receptors or over-expressing the wild-type beta(2)-adrenoceptor. Here we demonstrate the presence of constitutive beta(2)-adrenoceptor activity in BC3H1 cells which endogenously express this receptor. In BC3H1 cells, only ICI 118551 behaved as an inverse agonist at beta(2)-adrenoceptors, while propranolol, ICI 118551, atenolol and, to a lesser extent, alprenolol exhibited inverse agonism in CHO-beta(2)4 cells transfected with cDNA for the human beta(2)-adrenoceptor (310 fmol. mg protein(-1)). The level of expression of beta2-adrenoceptors in BC3H1 cells was not high (78 fmol.mg protein-1) and the efficiency of receptor - effector coupling in this cell line was much lower than in the recombinant CHO-beta(2)4 cells (as judged by the partial agonist nature of both salbutamol and clenbuterol). ICI 118551 (log K(D)-9.73+/-0.07) and propranolol (log K(D)-9.25+/-0.12) both behaved as conventional competitive antagonists of isoprenaline-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation in high expressing CHO-beta(2)4 cells. In contrast, ICI 118551 appeared to act as a non-competitive antagonist in BC3H1 cells and in low expressing CHO-beta(2)6 cells (50 fmol.mg protein(-1)). This non-competitive effect of ICI 118551 in BC3H1 cells was also observed when either salbutamol was used as agonist, or the incubation period with isoprenaline was extended to 30 min. The possibility that these effects of ICI 118551 are due to an interaction with different affinity states (R, R* and R') of the receptor is discussed.", 
    "69": "Previous studies have shown that beta-adrenoceptor antagonists may be substrates of organic cation transporters in kidney and lung. In this study we examined the transport of the beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists propranolol and metoprolol, in renal LLC-PK(1) cell monolayers. Experiments with BCECF (2', 7'-bis(2carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein) loaded LLC-PK(1) cell monolayers demonstrated that metoprolol and propranolol flux across the basolateral membrane was consistent with non-ionic diffusion. Flux across the apical membrane consisted of both non-ionic diffusion and the uptake of the cationic form of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. Uptake of the cationic form of metoprolol across the apical membrane was Na(+)-independent, electrogenic and sensitive to external pH. Furthermore, uptake was sensitive to inhibition by Decynium-22 and the organic cations TEA (tetraethylammonium) and MPP(+) (1-methyl 4-phenylpyridinium). These results, allied with the apical location of the uptake mechanism suggest that beta-adrenoceptor antagonists may be substrates for the organic cation transporter, OCT2. To confirm beta-adrenoceptor antagonists as substrates for OCT2, we demonstrate, in cells transiently transfected with an epitope tagged version of hOCT2 (hOCT2-V5):(1) Decynium-22 sensitive [(14)C]-propranolol uptake, (2) cis-inhibition of OCT2 by a range of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists and (3) metoprolol induced intracellular acidification.", 
    "70": "The adsorption isotherms of the enantiomers of three beta-blockers, metoprolol, alprenolol, and propranolol, were measured on cellobiohydrolase I (CBH I) immobilized on silicagel, in the concentration range between 0.25 microM and 1.7 mM, at pH = 5.0, 5.5, and 6.0. In agreement with previous results, these data are accounted for by a two-sites physical model and fit closely to a Bilangmuir equation. The saturation capacities and the binding constants were determined for each enantiomer on the chiral and the nonchiral sites. The chiral sites are shown to be strongly ionic, in contrast to the nonchiral ones, which are mainly hydrophobic. However, the chiral binding of (S)-propranolol is endothermic, with a high adsorption entropy, in contrast to the chiral interactions of (R)-propranolol and to the nonchiral interactions, which are all exothermic. This indicates that hydrophobic interactions also play a role in the chiral binding. The dependence of the adsorption parameters on the hydrophobicity of the solute is discussed and interpreted in terms of the retention mechanism. The results are compared with the structure of the protein, recently elucidated by X-ray crystallography.", 
    "71": "Since the first publication of isosorbide mononitrate 30% immediate-release 70% sustained-release (IR-SR) formulation in 1985, a considerable body of literature concerning its clinical efficacy and safety has become available. Theoretically, the formulation has the advantage over conventional isosorbide mononitrate or dinitrate (ISMN/ISDN) that it has a simpler and more predictable pharmacokinetic profile. The objectives of this paper are to review published data so far and to see whether the theoretical advantages translate into better clinical effectiveness. 1. After oral administration, isosorbide mononitrate IR-SR has a rapid onset of action (30 minutes), and effects are evident for up to 17 hours. 2. The antianginal effects of once-daily isosorbide mononitrate IR-SR increased with increasing dosages, were generally larger than those of either placebo or equipotent doses of conventional ISMN/ISDN, and were somewhat larger than those of the beta blocker bupranolol. The effects were generally similar to those of sustained release nifedipine. 3. Patients showed significantly greater improvement in some quality-of-life indices with once-daily isosorbide mononitrate IR-SR than with twice or three times daily regimens of conventional ISMN/ISDN. This was particularly so with mobility, psychological distress, and life satisfaction indices. 4. Tolerance did not develop after 13 months of once daily isosorbide dinitrate IR-SR. No rebound increase in incidence of ischemic episodes was observed after discontinuation of treatment. 5. Long-term efficacy data both of isosorbide mononitrate IR-SR and of conventional ISMN/ISDN are limited so far. Large studies in patients with angina pectoris and patients with heart failure addressing long-term effects are ongoing, and some of the data will be completed within the next months. Isosorbide mononitrate IR-SR has a rapid onset of action and has been shown to be clinically efficient and, in addition, to be more so than conventional ISMN / ISDN. Nitrate tolerance with continued use of the formulation has not yet been reported. Long-term effects on morbidity and mortality are currently being assessed.",

Release patterns of these fragments have been related to bizarre episodes of self-injurious behavior (SIB) among autistic individuals. Moreover, elevation in beta-endorphin (betaE) but not ACTH levels was associated with a positive response to an acutely administered, centrally acting opioid blocker among autistic individuals exhibiting SIB. In the present study, POMC fragments were measured in 12 self-injurious patients before and after long term (3 month) treatment with an opiate blocker naltrexone (NTX). POMC fragments were sampled from blood collected at the beginning of the baseline and placebo-controlled treatment phases of the study. Results indicated that the co-release (coupling) of POMC fragments were stable over time and the profile of POMC fragments in plasma predicted the effectiveness of a CNS acting drug in autistic subjects who self-injure.", 
    "73": "Rats were acutely injected with alcohol (75 mmol/kg body weight) and at the end of 2.5 h changes in cardiac synthesis rates were assessed with a 'flooding dose' of L-[4-(3)H]phenylalanine. The results showed that acute alcohol dosage reduced the fractional rates of cardiac protein synthesis (k(S), %/day). This effect was also seen when data were expressed relative to either RNA (i.e. k(RNA), mg protein/day/mg RNA) or DNA (i.e. k(DNA), mg protein/day/mg DNA). Both left and right ventricles responded similarly to ethanol. However, propranolol pre-treatment (at doses of 17 and 170 micromol/kg body weight; i.p.) did not prevent these effect of ethanol in either the left or right ventricle. Indeed, there was evidence that propranolol per se perturbed cardiac protein synthesis in vivo in control (i.e. without ethanol) rats particularly in the right ventricle. In conclusion, the results suggest that alcohol is cardiotoxic to the myocardium, which may cause its effects on protein synthesis independently of beta-receptors and/or xanthine oxidase inhibition.",

However, this procedure is asymptotically optimal only if the odds ratio is constant across strata. We propose an alternative analytic strategy based on the simultaneous use of two statistics, ZS and ZI, each involving a weighted averaging of within-stratum differences between proportions. The two treatments are declared significantly different at overall level alpha if either min(ZS, ZI) > Zalpha/2 or max(ZS, ZI) > Zalpha*/2, where alpha* is data dependent. Our strategy is shown to be more powerful than the M-H and other related procedures. Numerical examples are provided for illustration.", 
    "75": "The findings of this study support the hypothesis that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors mediate the initiation of long-term potentiation (LTP) and behavioral changes induced by the anxiogenic beta-carboline, FG-7142. Unlike previous work, this study examined the effects of FG-7142 on LTP of amygdala efferents in both hemispheres. 7-amino-phosphono-heptanoic acid (AP7), a competitive NMDA receptor blocker, given prior to administration of FG-7142, prevented LTP in amygdala efferent transmission to the medial hypothalamus and periacqueductal gray (PAG). When given FG-7142 alone, cats showed lasting behavioral changes accompanied by LTP in all pathways studied. Duration of LTP, and its relationship to behavioral change, depended on the pathway and the hemisphere of the pathway. Correlation and covariance analyses indicate that LTP in the left amygdalo-ventromedial hypothalamic pathway mediates initiation, but not maintenance, of increased defensiveness. This finding replicates previous work. A new finding is that increased local excitability in the right basal amygdala (reduced threshold for evoked response), and LTP in the right amygdalo-PAG pathway, may be important for maintenance of increases in defensive behavior. Furthermore, the effects of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, on behavior and physiology single out the importance of right amygdalo-PAG LTP as a critical mediator of increased defensiveness. Flumazenil reversed the increase in defensiveness produced by FG-7142 in a drug-dependent manner as described in Adamec (1998a). Moreover, flumazenil reversed LTP only in the right amygdalo-PAG pathway. The findings of the present study suggest that response to FG-7142 may be a useful model of the effects of traumatic stressors on limbic system function in anxiety, especially in view of the recent data in humans implicating right hemispheric function in persisting negative affective states.",

It has been postulated that pindolol enhances the antidepressant effect of SSRIs by blocking somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors, thus antagonizing the SSRI-induced feedback inhibition of midbrain 5-HT cell firing. A recent study, however, found that pindolol suppresses the firing rate of central 5-HT cells, suggesting that the compound possesses agonistic activity at 5-HT1A autoreceptors.",

Neither 0.25 nor 3.0 mg/kg (-)pindolol reversed the citalopram (0.1-0.2 mg/kg. IV)-induced suppression of 5-HT cell activity, but produced a further decrease in firing rate. In contrast, WAY100635 (0.1 mg/kg) completely reversed this effect of citalopram. Yet, pretreatment with 3.0, but not 0.25 mg/kg (-)pindolol significantly attenuated the acute inhibitory effect of citalopram on serotonergic cell firing.",

    "81": "To examine the role of beta-adrenergic mechanisms in the regulation of endogenous glucose (Glu) production [rate of appearance (R(a))] and utilization [rate of disappearance (R(d))] and carbohydrate (CHO) metabolism, six horses completed consecutive 30-min bouts of exercise at approximately 30% (Lo) and approximately 60% (Hi) of estimated maximum O(2) uptake with (P) and without (C) prior administration of the beta-blocker propranolol (0.22 mg/kg iv). All horses completed exercise in C; exercise duration in P was 49.9 +/- 1.2 (SE) min. Plasma Glu was unchanged in C during Lo but increased progressively in Hi. In P, plasma Glu rose steadily during Lo and Hi and was higher (P < 0.05) than in C throughout exercise. Plasma insulin declined during exercise in P but not in C; beta-blockade attenuated (P < 0.05) the rise in plasma glucagon and free fatty acids and exaggerated the increases in epinephrine and norepinephrine. Glu R(a) was 8.1 +/- 0.8 and 8.4 +/- 1.0 micromol. kg(-1). min(-1) at rest and 30.5 +/- 3.6 and 42.8 +/- 4.1 micromol. kg(-1). min(-1) at the end of Lo in C and P, respectively. During Hi, Glu R(a) increased to 54.4 +/- 4.4 and 73.8 +/- 4.7 micromol. kg(-1). min(-1) in C and P, respectively. Similarly, Glu R(d) was approximately 40% higher in P than in C during Lo (27.3 +/- 2.0 and 39.5 +/- 3.3 micromol. kg(-1). min(-1) in C and P, respectively) and Hi (37.4 +/- 2.6 and 61.5 +/- 5.3 micromol. kg(-1). min(-1) in C and P, respectively). beta-Blockade augmented CHO oxidation (CHO(ox)) with a concomitant reduction in fat oxidation. Inasmuch as estimated muscle glycogen utilization was similar between trials, the increase in CHO(ox) in P was due to increased use of plasma Glu. We conclude that beta-blockade increases Glu R(a) and R(d) and CHO(ox) in horses during exercise. The increase in Glu R(d) under beta-blockade suggests that beta-adrenergic mechanisms restrain Glu R(d) during exercise.", 
    "82": "Adrenergic and cholinergic tone on the cardiovascular system of embryonic chickens was determined during days 12, 15, 19, 20, and 21 of development. Administration of the muscarinic antagonist atropine (1 mg/kg) resulted in no significant change in heart rate or arterial pressure at any developmental age. In addition, the general cardiovascular depressive effects of hypoxia were unaltered by pretreatment with atropine. In addition, the ganglionic blocking agent hexamethonium (25 mg/kg) did not induce changes in heart rate. The beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (3 mg/kg) induced a bradycardia of similar magnitude on all days studied, with a transient hypertensive action on days 19-20, indicating the existence of an important cardiac and vascular beta-adrenergic tone. Injections of the alpha-adrenergic antagonists prazosin or phentolamine (1 mg/kg) reduced arterial pressure significantly on all days of incubation studied. Collectively, the data indicate that embryonic chickens rely primarily on adrenergic control of cardiovascular function, with no contribution from the parasympathetic nervous system.", 
    "83": "Noradrenergic mechanisms in the hypothalamus may be involved in counterregulatory responses to glucoprivic episodes. After 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG; 1.2 mmol/kg iv), extracellular norepinephrine (NE) concentration in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMN) increased in a bimodal fashion to 251 +/- 39% (P < 0.001) and 150 +/- 17% (P < 0.001) of baseline during the first 30 min. In the lateral hypothalamus (LHA), NE decreased by 30 min (61 +/- 4%, P < 0.001) and no consistent changes were measured in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN). Because the NE response in the VMN after 2-DG followed the same pattern as GABA, the interaction between NE and GABA was evaluated. In the VMN, GABA had little effect on extracellular NE concentrations but NE increased GABA concentrations 166 +/- 13%, (P < 0.01). In the presence of yohimbine (alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist) the first GABA peak after 2-DG was absent, and the second GABA peak was absent in the presence of timolol (beta-adrenoceptor antagonist). These results support an interaction among noradrenergic and GABAergic systems in the VMN during glucoprivation and that increased NE mediates the increase in extracellular GABA after 2-DG.",

Fifty-four women (42%) of these women had mitral stenosis diagnosed for the first time in the index pregnancy. Twenty-nine (23%) had a previous mitral valvulotomy. Nineteen women (15%) developed hypertension during pregnancy, 10 of whom had pre-eclampsia. Sixty-three women (49%) had a mitral valve area of < or = 1.2 cm2 with 11 having critical mitral stenosis (mitral valve area < or = 0.8 cm2). Atrial fibrillation was present in 12 women. Most women (87%) required medical therapy to control the heart rate. OUTCOME IN PERSISTENT SYMPTOMATIC WOMEN: Intervention was considered in 37 women (29%) who remained symptomatic, 11 (9%) of whom had a calcified mitral valve. The remaining 26 women were scheduled for balloon mitral valvulotomy during pregnancy, 20 of whom had balloon mitral valvulotomy with good effect (16 antepartum; 4 postpartum). In seven women, scheduled balloon mitral valvulotomy was not performed because of advanced preterm labour (n = 5), fetal distress (n = 1) and preterm labour with fetal distress (n = 1). These seven, together with the 11 with calcific mitral stenosis, were managed conservatively with good outcome. MATERNAL COMPLICATIONS: Fifty-one percent had maternal complications, the majority occurring at their initial admission to hospital. Pulmonary oedema was the most frequent. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the severity of stenosis assessed by measurement of the mitral valve area by echo-Doppler was the most powerful predictor of maternal pulmonary oedema. The other factors were late antenatal presentation, presence of symptoms prior to the index pregnancy and diagnosis of cardiac disease for the first time in the index pregnancy.",

    "89": "Vasovagal syncope is the most common cause of syncope, but its risk for driving remains uncertain. We analyzed the clinical characteristics of patients who had syncope during driving and subsequently underwent the head-up tilt test (HUTT). Of the 245 consecutive patients undergoing HUTT, 23 (9%) had > or =1 episode of syncope during driving. HUTT was positive in 19 (group A) and negative in 4 (group B) patients. No patient had structural heart disease. In group A, the driving incident occurred on the first syncope in 3 patients, and the other 16 patients had 1 to 4 episodes of prior syncope not associated with driving. In group B, the driving incident occurred on the first syncope in 1 patient, and the other 3 patients had prior syncope (3 episodes in each) not associated with driving. Seven group A and 1 group B patients had 2 syncope-related driving incidents, and the remaining patients had only 1 syncope-related driving incident. The syncope-related driving incidents caused personal injury in 7 group A and 2 group B patients. One incident in 1 group A patient caused the death of another driver. After HUTT, all but 1 patient in group A received medical treatment and only 1 patient in group B received empirical beta-blocker therapy. During the follow-up of 51+/-26 months, 1 patient died and another was lost to follow-up. Of the remaining patients, 4 patients had recurrence of syncope and 2 patients had presyncope in group A. One of these patients had another syncope-related driving incident. No group B patient had syncope recurrence. A second etiology of syncope was never found in any patient. We conclude that vasovagal syncope during driving is not uncommon in patients referred for syncope evaluation. Early medical attention to patients with vasovagal syncope may help reduce syncope-related driving incidents.",

The present study investigated the effect of celiprolol, atenolol, and placebo on acetylcholine-induced vasomotion in patients with coronary artery disease. Furthermore, direct effects on coronary vasomotion and on hemodynamics were evaluated. Acetylcholine (intracoronary concentrations of 6.3x10(-7), 2.0x10(-6), and 6.3x10(-6) M) was given before and after double-blind celiprolol (0.30 mg/kg IV), atenolol (0.15 mg/kg IV), or placebo in 3x12 patients. Vasomotion was investigated by quantitative coronary angiography in proximal and distal segments of epicardial coronary arteries, and by the determination of the coronary resistance index based on Doppler-flow measurements. The investigated drugs had no direct affect on the diameter of the epicardial coronary arteries. However, celiprolol, in contrast to atenolol, significantly reduced systemic vascular resistance (change after atenolol: from 1,855+/-308 to 2,161+/-550 dyne s cm(-5); celiprolol: 1,691+/-435 to 1,411+/-343 dyne s cm(-5); and placebo: 1,722+/-215 to 1,710+/-213 dyne s cm(-5), p<0.001) and the coronary resistance index (change after atenolol: 2.52+/-3.58 to 2.86+/-4.24; celiprolol: 2.70+/-1.55 to 2.49+/-2.26; and placebo: 1.97+/-1.35 to 1.92+/-1.25, p<0.01). Celiprolol, atenolol, and placebo did not have different effects on acetylcholine-induced coronary vasomotion of epicardial conductance vessels (diminution of proximal lumen diameter before/after atenolol: 0.42+/-0.39/0.44+/-0.39 mm; celiprolol: 0.32+/-0.26/0.30+/-0.24 mm; and placebo: 0.36+/-0.29/0.43+/-0.40 mm) and of coronary resistance vessels (reduction of coronary resistance index before/after atenolol: 1.95 +/-4.74/ 1.92+/-3.74; celiprolol: 0.98+/-0.73/1.41+/-1.50; and placebo: 1.16+/-1.29/1.16+/-1.04). In contrast to atenolol, celiprolol possesses vasodilative properties in systemic and coronary resistance vessels. There was no direct effect on the diameter of conductance vessels. Acetylcholine-induced coronary vasomotion both in conductance and resistance vessels was not influenced by the beta blockers that were studied. This suggests that atenolol and celiprolol do not influence endothelium-dependent, nitric oxide related vasomotion.",

After 7-day administration of the substance in two doses (5 and 50 mg.kg-1), the changes in the reactibility of arterial preparations were investigated on three models of the contraction of the isolated rat aorta (KCl, noradrenaline, and PGF2 alpha) from both qualitative and quantitative views. The results were also supplemented with organometric studies of the effect of the substance in rats.",

In the mitochondria, both substances inhibit the specific activity of cytochromoxidase (FA33 by 37.14% and FP33 by 35.88%). In the sarcolemma, substance FA33 inhibits the specific activity of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase by 23.02%, while substance FP33 possesses an activating effect increased by 23.24%. In the sarcoplasmatic reticule both substances inhibit the specific activity of Ca(2+)-Mg(2+)-ATPase (FA33 by 14.96% and FP33 by 8.79%). The different effects of substances FA33 and FP33 on the activities of the markers of the subcellular fractions of the cardiac muscle can be connected with different inotropism of both substances.", 
    "116": "The effect of 18 compounds of the aryloxyaminopropanol type--potential beta-adrenolytics (differing each from other by modifications in the hydrophilic and lipophilic part of the molecule) on the inhibition of oxygen evolution rate in spinach chloroplasts has been investigated. The compounds with n-octyloxymethyl and n-nonyloxymethyl group in position 3 of aromatic ring were found to exhibit the highest inhibitory activity (IC50 = 67, resp. 120 mumol dm-3). The compounds containing a heterocycle or the dimethylamino group in the hydrophilic part of the molecule and with propoxymethyl group on the aromatic ring were not active. Using EPR spectroscopy it was found that the studied compounds interact with Z+/D+ intermediates, i.e. tyrosine radicals TyrZ and TyrD situated in D1 and D2 proteins on the donor side of photosystem 2. Higher concentrations of the studied inhibitors cause release of Mn2+ ions from the oxygen evolving complex which is situated in photosystem 2. The interaction of the tested compounds with chlorophyll occurring in the photosynthetic centres has been confirmed by fluorescence measurements as well.", 
    "117": "Typical atrial flutter is a macroreentrant arrhythmia of the right atrium. The isthmus area between the tricuspid annulus, the inferior vena cava, and the ostium of the coronary sinus is a critical zone of the reentry circle. Atrial flutter has been treated with class I and III antiarrhytmic drugs to maintain sinus rhythm, with moderate success. Catheter ablation has been highly successful in treating atrial flutter. A contiguous line of bidirectional electrical block is created in the isthmus area between the tricuspid annulus and the inferior vena cava by application of radiofrequency energy. In patients with both atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation, ablation of the atrial flutter circuit may make the atrial fibrillation more easy to control. Quality of life assessments show improvement after ablation of atrial flutter. With a probability of success of 90%, a recurrence rate of 5% to 15%, and few complications, catheter ablation emerges as the best treatment of recurrent, symptomatic flutter.", 
    "118": "The possible existence of a beta(3)-adrenoceptor (beta(3)-AR) in human near-term myometrium was investigated by in vitro functional and biochemical studies and analysis of mRNA expression. SR 59119A and SR 59104A and CGP 12177 (two selective agonists and a partial agonist, respectively, of the beta(3)-AR), salbutamol and terbutaline (beta(2)-AR agonists) each produced a concentration-dependent relaxation of the myometrial spontaneous contractions. There were no differences in pD(2) values for the relaxing potencies of terbutaline, salbutamol, CGP 12177 and SR 59119A. The rank order for their relaxing efficacies was SR 59119A>SR 59104A>terbutaline approximately salbutamol approximately CGP 12177 (E(max)=52+/-7%, 42+/-12% and approximately 30% respectively). Propranolol, a beta(1)- and beta(2)-AR antagonist, and ICI 118551, a beta(2)-AR antagonist (both at 0.1 microM), did not affect the SR 59119A-induced relaxation whereas SR 59230A, a selective beta(3)-AR antagonist (1 microM), significantly reduced the maximal relaxing effect of SR 59119A. SR 59119A and salbutamol induced a significant increase in cyclic AMP levels that was antagonized by SR 59230A but not by propranolol for SR 59119A, and by propranolol but not by SR 59230A for salbutamol. The beta(3)-AR mRNA was positively expressed in myometrium preparations in a reverse transcription polymerase chain assay. The results presented provide the first evidence for the existence of the beta(3)-AR subtype in human near-term myometrium and suggest that the effects of SR 59119A might be mediated through an increase in cyclic AMP level.", 
    "119": "We studied the effects of the novel Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange inhibitor KB-R7943, 2-[2-[4-(4-nitrobenzyloxy)phenyl]ethyl]isothiourea methanesulphonate, on the native nicotinic receptors present at the bovine adrenal chromaffin cells, as well as on rat brain alpha(3)beta(4) and alpha(7) nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) expressed in Xenopus oocytes. As expected, KB-R7943 blocked the Na(+)-gradient dependent (45)Ca(2+) uptake into chromaffin cells (IC(50) of 5.5 microM); but in addition, the compound also inhibited the (45)Ca(2+) entry and the increase of cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration, [Ca(2+)](c), stimulated by 5 s pulses of ACh (IC(50) of 6.5 and 1.7 microM, respectively). In oocytes expressing alpha(3)beta(4) and alpha(7) nicotinic AChRs, voltage-clamped at -60 mV, inward currents elicited by 1 s pulses of 100 microM ACh (I(ACh)) were blocked by KB-R7943 with an IC(50) of 0.4 microM and a Hill coefficient of 0.9. Blockade of alpha(3)beta(4) currents by KB-R7943 was noncompetitive; moreover, the blocker (0.3 microM) became more active as the ACh concentration increased (34 versus 66% blockade at 30 microM and 1 mM ACh, respectively). Inhibition of alpha(3)beta(4) currents by 0.3 microM KB-R7943 was more pronounced at hyperpolarized potentials. If given within the ACh pulse (10 microM), the inhibition amounted to 33, 64 and 80% in oocytes voltage-clamped at -40, -60 and -100 mV, respectively. The onset of blockade was faster and the recovery slower at -100 mV; the reverse was true at -40 mV. In conclusion, KB-R7943 is a potent blocker of nicotinic AChRs; moreover, it displays many features of an open-channel blocker at the rat brain alpha(3)beta(4) AChR. These results should be considered when KB-R7943 is to be used to study Ca(2+) homeostasis in cells expressing nicotinic AChRs and the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger.", 
    "120": "Stable clones of HEK293 cells expressing either FLAG(TM) epitope-tagged, wild type human beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptors or C-terminally green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged forms of these receptors were established. The binding affinity of [(3)H]-dihydroalprenolol and other ligands was little affected by addition of GFP to the C-terminal of either receptor. Isoprenaline induced the internalisation of both beta(1)-adrenoceptor-GFP and beta(2)-adrenoceptor-GFP and following removal of the agonist both constructs were able to recycle to the cell surface. The extent of internalisation of beta(2)-adrenoceptor-GFP produced by isoprenaline was substantially greater than for beta(1)-adrenoceptor-GFP. C-terminal addition of GFP slowed markedly the rate of internalization of both the beta(1)-adrenoceptor and the beta(2)-adrenoceptor in response to isoprenaline. Sustained exposure to isoprenaline (24 h) produced substantially greater levels of downregulation of native beta(2)-adrenoceptor compared to beta(2)-adrenoceptor-GFP although both were equally effectively removed from the plasma membrane. Sustained exposure to isoprenaline resulted in a large fraction of beta(2)-adrenoceptor-GFP becoming trapped in internal vesicles/lysosomes but not degraded. Even after sustained exposure to isoprenaline a significant fraction of beta(1)-adrenoceptor-GFP remained at the cell surface. These results indicate that although GFP tagging of beta-adrenoceptors can provide qualitative visual patterns of agonist-induced receptor trafficking and regulation in HEK293 cells the quantitative details vary markedly from those obtained with the unmodified receptors.", 
    "121": "Infarct size as determined by perfusion imaging is an independent predictor of mortality after implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias (VA). However, its value as a predictor of VA recurrence and hospitalisation after ICD implantation is unknown. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate whether infarct size as determined by perfusion imaging can help to identify patients who are at high risk for recurrence of VA and hospitalisation after ICD implantation. We studied 56 patients with CAD and life-threatening VA. Before ICD implantation, all patients underwent a uniform study protocol including a thallium-201 stress-redistribution perfusion study. A defect score as a measurement of infarct size was calculated using a 17-segment 5-point scoring system. Study endpoints during follow-up were documented episodes of appropriate anti-tachycardia pacing and/or shocks for VA and cardiac hospitalisation for electrical storm (defined as three or more appropriate ICD interventions within 24 h), heart failure or angina. After a mean follow-up of 470+/-308 days, 22 patients (39%) had recurrences of VA. In univariate analysis, predictors for recurrence were: (a) ventricular tachycardia (VT) as the initial presenting arrhythmia (86% vs 59% for patients without ICD therapy, P=0.04), (b) treatment with beta-blockers (36% vs 68%, P=0.03) and (c) a defect score (DS) > or = 20 (64% vs 32%, P=0.03). In multivariate analysis, VT as the presenting arrhythmia (chi2=5.51, P=0.02) and a DS > or = 20 (chi2=4.22, P=0.04) remained independent predictors. Cardiac hospitalisation was more frequent in patients with a DS > or = 20 (44% vs 13% for patients with DS < 20, P=0.015) and this was particularly due to more frequent hospitalisations for electrical storm (24% vs 3% for patients with DS < 20, P=0.037). The extent of scarring determined by perfusion imaging can separate patients with CAD into high- and low-risk groups for recurrence of VA and cardiac hospitalisation after ICD implantation.",

    "124": "The 24 h fast erased the phenotype-related differences in insulinaemia and adipose lipoprotein lipase activity present in freely fed rats. Adipose lipoprotein lipase increased twofold in obese rats 1 h after refeeding, whereas no change occurred at that time in lean rats. Activity remained at that level for at least 6 h after refeeding in obese rats, whereas in lean animals it was increased fivefold after 6 h of refeeding. In muscle of obese rats, lipoprotein lipase decreased in response to refeeding, but paradoxically increased twofold in lean animals. Giving propranolol to lean rats before refeeding abolished the atypical response of muscle lipoprotein lipase to food intake and restored the early (1 h after refeeding) increase in adipose lipoprotein lipase but had no effect in obese rats.", 
    "125": "Refeeding after prolonged fasting activates the P-adrenergic pathway in lean rats, which transiently counteracts insulin-mediated modulation of lipoprotein lipase. The P-adrenergic pathway is not activated by refeeding in adipose tissue and muscle of the obese Zucker rat. In the obese Zucker rat, the early modulation of adipose lipoprotein lipase activity is abnormal upon refeeding after prolonged fasting, suggesting short-term resistance to the action of insulin.", 
    "126": "A 49-year-old man was referred for further treatment of sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) associated with cardiac sarcoidosis. During an electrophysiologic study (EP), dl-sotalol suppressed the spontaneous VT and prevented induction of VT. However, when predonisolone treatment was started, monomorphic VT recurred frequently. To terminate the VT, a temporal pacing lead was placed at the apex of the right ventricle, and programmed electrical stimulation was attempted from the lead. During the EP study, 2 different monomorphic VTs were repetitively induced and both types were able to be terminated by rapid ventricular pacing; in one of the VT morphologies, constant and progressive fusion was obvious during the ventricular pacing. Some monomorphic VTs associated with cardiac sarcoidosis are due to reentry with an excitable gap, but the clinical efficacy of EP-guided antiarrhythmic drug treatment seems to be less certain during steroid therapy. In the present case, a defibrillator device was implanted to prevent a possible arrhythmic event.", 
    "127": "The first effective antihypertensive treatment became available in the 1950s but the early drugs caused intolerable side effects. Drugs with a better side-effect profile became available in the 1960s, and their utility was soon subjected to rigorous clinical trials. In the 1970s, the availability of these drugs opened the door for outcome studies. Most of the results reported in the 1970s and 1980s were rather impressive. Antihypertensive treatment reduced mortality in severe and mild hypertension, in hypertension of the elderly, and in patients with advanced complications of hypertension. A large number of 'hard end point' (mortality and morbidity) trials were organized in the last decade of the 20th century. Most compare the merits of new antihypertensive agents (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, calcium channel blocker, angiotensin II receptor blocker) versus an older (beta-blocker or diuretic) drug. These trials are rooted in the fact that blood pressure lowering does not equally affect all complications of hypertension. Particularly bothersome is the fact that treatment decreases stroke but fails to substantially reduce coronary events. These variations in treatment outcomes may reflect the multifactorial pathophysiology of hypertension: essential hypertension is frequently associated with pressure-independent coronary risk factors, and the target organ status of a patient (left ventricular hypertrophy, renal dysfunction) greatly affects their prognosis. These new trials investigate whether the mechanism by which a drug decreases the pressure and how it affects various risk factors are of clinical relevance. The practice of medicine in hypertension is evidence bound. Historically, only when the superiority of the treatment had been convincingly shown did physicians alter practice patterns. The effects of systolic blood pressure lowering and of treating mild diastolic hypertension in younger patients have not been sufficiently investigated. Lowering of the systolic blood pressure and treating patients with mild hypertension might have major beneficial effects on public health. We need new studies in this area in order to improve clinical practice in hypertension.",

    "133": "More information is needed about the subtype of the beta-adrenergic receptor coupled to the G-protein-adenylate cyclase (AC) system in human erythrocytes and about the optimal experimental conditions to study this system. In this study we describe the characteristics of spontaneous and beta-agonist-activated AC in human erythrocytes. Human erythrocyte membranes were isolated and AC activity was utilized to assess the quantity of cAMP. Our data show that the subtype beta-2 is the functional beta-adrenergic receptor involved in such activation; this modifies the beta-adrenergic-stimulated activity of AC in human erythrocytes. Isoproterenol in a medium with calcium (1-10 mM, range that includes physiological plasma concentrations) enhances the activation of AC; this effect was blocked by propranolol, but not by atenolol. We conclude that in human erythrocytes subtype beta-2 is the functional beta-adrenergic receptor and that such a response depends to a large extent on Ca(2+) concentrations.", 
    "134": "The 1'-hydroxylation of rac-bufuralol, which is catalyzed by polymorphic CYP2D6 in humans, was studied in brain microsomes from male and female Wistar rats and from the female Dark Agouti rat, a model of the CYP2D6 poor metabolizer phenotype. The kinetics of the 1'-hydroxylation of bufuralol (1-1500 microM) by brain microsomes were biphasic. The activity of the high-affinity site of metabolism was consistent with Michaelis-Menten kinetics (apparent K(m1) = 0. 61-1.42 microM, V(max1) = 4.3-4.8 fmol/min/mg of protein), whereas the low-affinity activity was better described by a Hill function (K(50%(2)) = 253-258 microM, V(max2) = 817-843 fmol/min/mg of protein, n = 1.2-1.3). Values for kinetic constants were similar in all rat strains. Quinine was only a weak inhibitor of both the high- (apparent K(i) = 90 microM) and low-affinity (210 microM) sites of metabolism. In contrast, the kinetics of 1'-hydroxylation of bufuralol by rat liver microsomes were best described by a two-site Michaelis-Menten function. V(max) values were 3 to 5 orders of magnitude greater compared with those for brain microsomes (male and female Wistar), and liver microsomes from female Dark Agouti rats were significantly less active than those from Wistar rats. These data, together with the known potent inhibitory effect of quinine on bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation by rat liver microsomes, indicate tissue-specific differences in the enzymology of this reaction. The role of brain CYP2D enzymes remains to be clarified.", 
    "135": "The role of adrenoceptor subtypes and of cAMP on rat skeletal muscle proteolysis was investigated using a preparation that maintains tissue glycogen stores and metabolic activity for several hours. In both soleus and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles, proteolysis decreased by 15-20% in the presence of equimolar concentrations of epinephrine, isoproterenol, a nonselective beta-agonist, or clenbuterol, a selective beta(2)-agonist. Norepinephrine also reduced proteolysis but less markedly than epinephrine. No change in proteolysis was observed when muscles were incubated with phenylephrine, a nonselective alpha-agonist. The decrease in the rate of protein degradation induced by 10(-4) M epinephrine was prevented by 10(-5) M propranolol, a nonselective beta-antagonist, and by 10(-5) M ICI 118.551, a selective beta(2)-antagonist. The antiproteolytic effect of epinephrine was not inhibited by prazosin or yohimbine (selective alpha(1)-and alpha(2)-antagonists, respectively) or by atenolol, a selective beta(1)-antagonist. Dibutyryl cAMP and isobutylmethylxanthine reduced proteolysis in both soleus and EDL muscles. The data suggest that catecholamines exert an inhibitory control of skeletal muscle proteolysis, probably mediated by beta(2)-adrenoceptors, with the participation of a cAMP-dependent pathway.", 
    "136": "The Losartan Intervention For Endpoint (LIFE) reduction in hypertension study is a double-blind, prospective, parallel-group study comparing the effects of losartan with those of atenolol on the reduction of cardiovascular complications in patients (n = 9,194) with essential hypertension and with electrocardiographically (ECG) documented left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Baseline blood pressure was 174.4/97.8 mm Hg (mean), age 66.9 years, body mass index 28.0 kg/m2; 54.1% were women and 12.5% had diabetes mellitus. This population will be treated until at least 1,040 have a primary endpoint. After five scheduled visits and 12 months of follow-up, blood pressure decreased by 23.9/12.8 mm Hg to 150.5/85.1 mm Hg (target < 140/90 mm Hg). The mandatory titration level of < or = 160/95 mm Hg was reached by 72.1% of the patients. At the 12-month visit, 22.7% of all patients were taking blinded study drug alone, 44.3% were taking blinded drug plus hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), and 17.7% were taking blinded drugs plus HCTZ and additional drugs. Controlling for all other variables, patients in the US received more medication and had 2.4 times the odds of achieving blood pressure control than patients in the rest of the study (P < .001). Previously untreated patients (n = 2,530) had a larger initial decrease in blood pressure compared with those previously treated. Diabetics (n = 1,148) needed more medication than nondiabetics to gain blood pressure control. Only 13.9% of the patients had discontinued blinded study drug and 1.4% missed the revisit at 12 months. These data demonstrate both the successful lowering of blood pressure during 12 months of follow-up in a large cohort of patients with hypertension and LVH on ECG, but also emphasize the need for two or more drugs to control high blood pressure in most of these patients. Being previously treated and having diabetes were associated with less blood pressure response, whereas living in the US indicated better blood pressure control. It has been possible to keep most of these patients with complicated hypertension taking blinded study drug for 12 months.", 
    "137": "Increasing evidence supports a role for oxidative stress, proinflammatory cytokines, and apoptosis in the pathophysiology of focal ischemic stroke. Previous studies have found that the multi-action drug, carvedilol, is a mixed adrenergic antagonist, and that it behaves as an antioxidant and inhibits apoptosis. In the current study, the authors investigated whether carvedilol provides protection in focal cerebral ischemia and whether this protection is associated with reduced apoptosis and the downregulation of the inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin- 1beta (IL-1beta). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) by an intraluminal filament technique. Carvedilol (1, 3, and 10 mg/kg) was injected daily subcutaneously 2 or 4 days before the induction of ischemia. Neurologic scores, infarct volumes, TUNEL staining, and mRNA levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta were assessed at 24 hours reperfusion. The effect of carvedilol on microvascular cortical perfusion was studied with continuous laser-Doppler flowmetry. Twenty-four hours after MCAO, carvedilol at all three doses reduced infarct volumes by at least 40% and reduced neurologic deficits on average by 40% compared with vehicle-treated controls when given 2 or 4 days before the induction of ischemia. This protection was not mediated by changes in temperature or blood flow. Treatment with all three dose regimens resulted in fewer TUNEL positive cells compared with controls. At 24 hours reperfusion, carvedilol decreased TNF-alpha and IL-1beta expression by 40% to 50% in the ipsilateral ischemic cortex compared with the contralateral controls. The results of the current study indicate that carvedilol is neuroprotective in focal cerebral ischemia and may protect the ischemic brain by inhibiting apoptosis and attenuating the expression of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta.",

    "147": "Although chronic sympathetic activation provides inotropic and chronotropic support to the failing heart, such activation may also have deleterious effects, including the direct cardiotoxic effects of catecholamines, activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and an increase in myocardial oxygen demand. These observations indicate that beta-blockade might be beneficial in the treatment of heart failure. This suggestion is receiving growing support from clinical trials, which show that beta blockade improves the clinical and functional status of patients with heart failure resulting from dilated cardiomyopathy or ischaemic heart disease. These trials have also indicated beta blocking agents are much safer in patients with heart failure than was previously thought, provided that they are introduced at a low dose and titrated carefully. Newer beta blocking agents have ancillary properties that may be important in the treatment of heart failure. Bucindolol and carvedilol have vasodilating effects that may unload the failing heart, and carvedilol also has antiproliferative and antioxidant properties not shared by other beta blocking agents. Carvedilol is the only beta blocking agent that has reduced overall mortality in patients with heart failure in controlled clinical trials, and it also reduces hospitalization and improves the global assessment of patients. A large comparative trial against other beta blocking agents to confirm that these benefits are unique to carvedilol is about to be launched. Further clinical experience is required to determine the optimum use of carvedilol in the treatment of heart failure. The results obtained so far with carvedilol suggest that the management of heart failure is about to undergo a significant change.", 
    "148": "Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are expressed in the midbrain ascending dopaminergic system, a target of many addictive drugs. Here we assessed the intracellular Ca2+ level by imaging fura-2-loaded cells in substantia nigra pars compacta in mouse brain slices, and we examined the influence on this level of prolonged exposures to nicotine using mice lacking the nAChR beta2-subunit. In control cells, superfusion with nicotine (10-100 microM) caused a long-lasting rise of intracellular Ca2+ level which depended on extracellular Ca2+. This nicotinic response was almost completely absent in beta2-/- mutant mice, leaving a small residual response to a high concentration (100 microM) of nicotine which was inhibited by the alpha7-subunit-selective antagonist, methyllycaconitine. Conversely, the alpha7-subunit-selective agonist choline (10 mM) caused a methyllycaconitine-sensitive increase in intracellular Ca2+ level both in wild-type and beta2-/- mutant mice. Nicotine-elicited Ca2+ mobilization was reduced by the Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX) and by T-type Ca2+ channel blocking agents, whereas the choline-elicited Ca2+ increase was insensitive to TTX. Neither nicotine nor choline produced Ca2+ increase following inhibition of the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores by dantrolene. These results demonstrate that in nigral dopaminergic neurons, nicotine can elicit Ca2+ mobilization via activation of two distinct nAChR subtypes: that of beta2-subunit-containing nAChR followed by activation of Na+ channel and T-type Ca2+ channels, and/or activation of alpha7-subunit-containing nAChR. The Ca2+ influx due to nAChR activation is subsequently amplified by the recruitment of intracellular Ca2+ stores. This Ca2+ mobilization may possibly contribute to the long-term effects of nicotine on the dopaminergic system.", 
    "149": "We studied the effect of short-term nadolol administration on the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by polymorphonuclear leukocytes and mononuclear cells in 8 normal subjects. At a oral dose of 40 mg/day for 5 days, nadolol produced a decrease in the ROS generation by leukocytes. ROS generation by polymorphonuclear leukocytes decreased by 38% from 134 +/- 44 mV at baseline to 83 +/- 34 mV after 5 days (p = 0.005), and ROS generation by mononuclear cells decreased by 33% from 174 +/- 69 mV at baseline to 117 +/- 55 mV after 5 days (p = 0.015). There was also a significant reduction in linoleic acid oxidation as reflected by the lower levels of 9- and 13- hydroxy-octadecadienoic acid after 5 days. There was no change in the plasma thiobarbituric acid-reacting substances, a less sensitive index of oxidative damage to lipids. There was also no significant change in the levels of metatyrosine and orthotyrosine, which are known indexes of oxidative damage to amino acids and proteins. The absence of a significant change in metatyrosine, orthotyrosine, and thiobarbituric acid-reacting substances may reflect the short duration of nadolol administration and the decreased ROS load. Because ROS may induce lipid peroxidation, this inhibitory effect of nadolol on ROS generation by leukocytes and linoleic acid oxidation may inhibit low-density lipoprotein oxidation and thus atherogenesis. This effect may partly explain the favorable outcomes observed in patients with coronary artery disease on long-term beta-blocker therapy."
