The dogs were divided randomly into four groups of five dogs each (n = 5), anaesthetized with halothane and pretreated intravenously (i.v.) with verapamil 0.1 mg kg-1, propranolol 0.06 mg kg-1, or lignocaine 4 mg kg-1 while the controls received sterile physiological saline. Adrenaline (4 micrograms kg-1) was administered i.v. 10 min after drug pretreatments. Lead II of the ECG was recorded and blood collected for haematology. Ventricular fibrillations preceded by ventricular tachycardia occurred in the control dogs and three died within one minute of adrenaline administration. The predominant arrhythmias were ventricular premature beats, ventricular tachycardia, and second degree heart block. A significant increase (P < 0.05) in T wave amplitude was observed in the control group from 0.16 +/- 0.05 mV to 0.43 +/- 0.09 mV while only minimal increases were noted in the drug pretreated groups and there were no deaths. Data obtained from this study suggest that verapamil when administered early compares well with propranolol in the control of adrenaline-induced ventricular arrhythmias in the dog. Lignocaine when administered early prior to the induction of the arrhythmias protected against death but not arrhythmias. Drug pretreatments did not have any clinically significant effects on electrocardiographic parameters.",

    "2": "Follicle-enclosed Xenopus oocytes were used to describe the ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channel-blocking properties of U-37883A (4-morpholinecarboximidine-N-1-adamantyl-N'-cyclohexyl), in comparison with glibenclamide. In follicular oocytes, the KATP channel opener P1060 (30 microM), a pinacidil analog, activated a large outward K+ current that was blocked by glibenclamide (IC50 = 0.33 microM) and U-37883A (IC50 = 0.26 microM). P1060 activation was inhibited by both U-37883A and glibenclamide in a noncompetitive manner. U-37883A also blocked the KATP channel activation by cAMP (300 microM) and adenosine (10 microM). Single-channel studies on isolated follicular cells showed that U-37883A (10 microM) reduced the open probability of the KATP channel by 76%, without significantly modifying the single-channel current amplitude. Receptor binding studies with [3H]U-37883 in membranes from follicle-enclosed oocytes demonstrated a single class of low affinity binding sites, with a Kd of 450 nM and a Bmax of 17 pmol/mg of protein. Studies with analogs of U-37883A showed that U-52090A inhibited KATP current and displaced [3H]U-37883 from its binding site with similar potencies. In contrast, U-42069D neither inhibited KATP current nor competed with [3H]U-37883 binding. In RINm5F cells (an insulinoma cell line), U-37883A, unlike glibenclamide, failed to inhibit KATP current. Furthermore, there was no significant specific binding of [3H]U-37883 in RINm5F cell membranes, which displayed high levels of specific binding of [3H]glibenclamide. These data demonstrate the presence of a receptor for U-37883A-type guanidines that controls the activity of the endogenous KATP channels in follicle-enclosed oocytes. The available data collectively suggest that U-37883A is a more selective blocker of the follicular KATP channel, which is very similar to that in smooth muscle, than of the pancreatic beta cell KATP channel.", 
    "3": "Thirst elicited by the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol in rats depends in part on the secretion of renin, the consequent synthesis of angiotensin II (ANG II), and the binding of circulating ANG II to dipsogenic receptors in the brain. These receptors probably reside in either of two forebrain circumventricular organs, the subfornical organ (SFO) or organum vasculosum laminae terminalis (OVLT). Experiments determined that lesions of the SFO, but not of the OVLT, reduced drinking induced by isoproterenol treatment. Competitive ANG II-receptor antagonism with sarthran reduced isoproterenol-induced drinking when the blocker was infused into the SFO but not when it was infused into the OVLT or into the lateral ventricles at a 25-fold greater dose. The findings confirm the widely held belief that renin-dependent thirst elicited by isoproterenol relies on ANG II binding to receptor sites at a circumventricular organ in the brain. The results demonstrate that this site is the SFO and not the OVLT.",

The rates in daytime periods were not significantly different from each other (P = 0.699). The rate of aqueous flow for the night period was 1.37 +/- 0.37 microliters/min, a 57% reduction from both morning 1 and afternoon periods (P < 0.001).

The present study characterized [125I]RTI-55 binding to membranes prepared from rat, monkey and human caudates and COS cells transiently expressing the cloned rat dopamine (DA) transporter. Using the method of binding surface analysis, two binding sites were resolved in rat caudate: a high-capacity binding site (site 1, Bmax = 11,900 fmol/mg of protein) and a low-capacity site (site 2, Bmax = 846 fmol/mg of protein). The Kd (or Ki) values of selected drugs at the two sites were as follows: (Ki for high-capacity site and Ki for low-capacity site, respectively): RTI-55 (0.76 and 0.21 nM), 1-[2-diphenyl-methoxy)ethyl]-4-(3-phenylpropyl)piperazine (0.79 and 358 nM), mazindol (37.6 and 631 nM), 2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-fluorophenyl)tropane (45.0 and 540 nM) and cocaine (341 and 129 nM). Nisoxetine, a selective noradrenergic uptake blocker, had low affinity for both sites. Serotonergic uptake blockers had a high degree of selectivity and high affinity for the low-capacity binding site (Ki of citalopram = 0.38 nM; Ki of paroxetine = 0.033 nM). The i.c.v. administration of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine to rats pretreated with nomifensine (to protect dopaminergic and noradrenergic nerve terminals) selectively decreased the Bmax of site 2, strongly supporting the idea that site 2 is a binding site on the serotonin (5-HT) transporter. This serotonergic lesion also increased the affinity of [125I]RTI-55 for the DA transporter by 10-fold. The ligand selectivity of the caudate 5-HT transporter was different from the [I125]RTI-55 binding site on the 5-HT transporter present in membranes prepared from whole rat brain minus caudate. The [125I]RTI-55 binding to the DA transporter was further resolved into two components, termed sites 1a and 1b, by using human and monkey (Macaca mulatta) caudate membranes but not the membranes prepared from rat caudate or COS cells that transiently expressed the cloned cocaine-sensitive DA transporter complementary DNA. Similar experiments also resolved two components of the caudate 5-HT transporter. Viewed collectively, these data provide evidence that [125I]RTI-55 labels multiple binding sites associated with the DA and 5-HT transporters.", 
    "13": "We have examined the role of the spinal nicotinic receptors in mediating cardiovascular and behavioral responses in conscious rats. Intrathecal administration of nicotinic agonists to the lumbosacral region of the spinal cord caused a dose-dependent increase in systolic blood pressure, heart rate and a nociceptive (behavioral) response. The order of potencies for the pressor response was l-nicotine > or = cytisine > N-methylcarbamylcholine > or = dimethylphenylpiperazinium > d-nicotine. However, cytisine was the most potent in producing the heart rate increase and nociceptive response. Unlike the other agonists, cytisine also exhibited marked desensitization of the three responses upon repeated administration. The effects of nicotine were antagonized in a dose-dependent fashion by mecamylamine, hexamethonium, alpha-lobeline, dihydro-beta-erythroidine and methyllycaconitine. By contrast, cytisine-induced responses were blocked effectively by mecamylamine and methyllycaconitine, but not by alpha-lobeline or dihydro-beta-erythroidine. However, when alpha-lobeline or dihydro-beta-erythroidine antagonism of the pressor response to cytisine was monitored during the initial minute following intrathecal administration, both antagonists significantly inhibited the response. The competitive ganglionic blocker, trimethaphan, or the elapid alpha-toxin, alpha-bungarotoxin, when administered intrathecally, had no effect on nicotine- or cytisine-elicited responses. The cardiovascular responses to intrathecal nicotine and cytisine have two components. The first is likely mediated through direct sympathetic output and desensitizes rapidly to cytisine, the second is coupled indirectly to the nociceptive response and shows a diminished capacity for rapid desensitization. Agonist and antagonist specificities indicate that the spinal nicotinic receptor differs from those in ganglia and those characterized in brain to date. Although antagonist specificity of the blockade of nicotine and cytisine elicited responses differ, this may be due to the unique desensitization capacity of cytisine rather than an action mediated by distinct receptor subtypes.", 
    "14": "Female Swiss-Webster mice were injected with the glucose analogue 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), which when administered to rodents induces acute periods of metabolic stress. A single or multiple injections of 2-DG invoked a stress response, as evidenced by increases in serum corticosterone levels. The influence of this metabolic stressor on the blastogenic potential of splenic T lymphocytes was then examined. It was found that one, two, or three injections of 2-DG resulted in depressed T cell proliferative responses, with an attenuation of the effect occurring by the fifth injection. The 2-DG-induced inhibition of T cell proliferation was not attributable to 2-DG-induced cytolysis, as in vitro incubation of naive T cells with varying concentrations of 2-DG did not result in a reduction in cell number or viability, and flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that percentages of CD3, CD4, and CD8 splenic T cells were not altered as a result of 2-DG-induced stress. Incubating naive T cells in varying concentrations of 2-DG resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of T cell blastogenic potential. Following in vivo exposure to 2-DG, T cell proliferation did not return to normal levels until 3 days after the cessation of 2-DG injections. Administering the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol did not reverse the inhibited lymphoproliferation in 2-DG-treated mice. The inhibition in T cell proliferation was not observed, however, in mice that had been adrenalectomized or hypophysectomized and injected with 2-DG.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "18": "Central fevers are known to develop in traumatic brain injury (TBI) and are believed to be caused by injury involving the hypothalamus. Described are three patients admitted with very severe TBI secondary to motor vehicle accidents. Initial Glasgow Coma Score ratings were 3 or 4. Head computed tomography (CT) scans showed intraventricular hemorrhage in two cases and no focal injury or bleeding in the third. All patients had decorticate posturing and symptoms of autonomic dysfunction, manifested by tachycardia and profuse sweating. Each of these patients developed high fevers ranging from 38.9 degrees C to 40.6 degrees C during their hospitalization course. Centrally mediated fevers were indicated after fever workups failed to show an infectious or inflammatory source. Propranolol 20 to 30 mg every 6 hours reduced the temperatures at least 1.5 degree C within 48 hours. In each case, when weaning from propranolol was attempted, an increase in temperature to greater than 38.0 degrees C reoccurred within 3 days. Repeat workups for infectious or inflammatory causes of fever were negative. The fevers were reduced after a reinstitution of propranolol. The propranolol was continued until all signs of autonomic dysfunction abated. Central fevers after TBI have been reported to have been treated successfully with propranolol in two children with decerebrate posturing.

In the normotensive subjects, mean A-SBP and I-SBP agreed closely, whereas A-DBP was 11 mmHg higher.

    "31": "Myocardial ischemia, electrolyte changes, and fluctuations in autonomic tone may play an important role in the presentation of malignant ventricular arrhythmias. beta-Adrenoceptor blocking agents have been shown to decrease the incidence of ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death in patients with coronary artery disease. Therefore we investigated the changes in myocardial metabolism and transcardiac electrolytes during simulated ventricular tachycardia before and after beta-adrenergic blockade. Six patients with normal coronary arteries (group 1) and 12 patients with documented coronary artery disease (group 2) were included in the study. The right ventricle was paced with electrode catheters to a constant cycle length of 400 msec for 3 minutes. Blood samples were withdrawn simultaneously from the coronary sinus and femoral artery to determine the transcardiac differences in metabolic variables and electrolytes before the pacing, at the end of the pacing, and 2 minutes thereafter. After pacing, the patients were given intravenous propranolol (0.15 mg/kg), and the protocol was repeated. Intraarterial blood pressure and electrocardiogram were monitored continuously. There was a rapid decline of the mean arterial blood pressures after initiation of the pacing in both study groups, whereafter the pressures began to rise. Propranolol somewhat blunted the blood pressure recovery, especially in group 2. Norepinephrine levels increased during the pacing in both patient groups, and the increase was accentuated by beta-adrenergic blockade. The femoroarterial coronary sinus difference in lactate turned negative, and pH, PCO2 and potassium differences increased in group 2 during pacing. However, the myocardial energy state remained relatively good as estimated from the nonsignificant change in the transcardiac differences of the plasma adenosine catabolites. There were no changes in the metabolic variables or transcardiac electrolytes in group 1 patients during pacing. Propranolol did not prevent the metabolic ischemia, but it did prevent the pacing-induced decrease in coronary sinus potassium and increase in transcardiac potassium difference. Propranolol also decreased arterial levels of free fatty acids and their extraction in group 2 patients during pacing. In conclusion, blood pressure decay during simulated ventricular tachycardia is followed by instantaneous sympathoadrenergic activation. In patients with coronary artery disease, this process is accompanied by metabolic ischemia and net transfer of extracellular potassium into the intracellular space. The metabolic and electrolyte changes may result in alterations of electrophysiologic millieau, thereby also modifying the clinical characteristics of ventricular tachycardia. Propranolol decreases arterial levels of free fatty acids and prevents changes in transcardiac electrolytes observed in coronary artery disease patients during simulated ventricular tachycardia. These effects of propranolol may be of clinical significance.", 
    "32": "A Cl- current (ICl) induced by isoproterenol (ISO) has been identified in isolated guinea pig ventricular myocytes. This ISO-induced ICl can be inhibited by propranolol and mimicked by forskolin (FSK), suggesting that beta-receptors, cAMP, and protein kinase A (PKA) are involved in regulating the involved Cl- channel. Because activation of protein kinase C (PKC) mediated via alpha-adrenergic receptor stimulation is also known to regulate several ion channels, the idea that activation of PKC also can induce ICl was investigated by using isolated feline ventricular myocytes and the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. We found that extracellularly applied phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) could activate ICl in feline ventricular cells. Control experiments indicated that in the absence of PMA or other interventions, the steady-state current-voltage relation of patches maintained for more than 40 minutes was unchanged over a voltage range from -100 to +80 mV. This suggests that the present findings are not complicated by the development over time after patching of a steady-state ICl, similar to the findings reported for canine atrial myocytes. When induced by PMA, ICl was noninactivating and outwardly rectifying; it reversed polarity at approximately the equilibrium potential for Cl- and was sensitive to the Cl- channel blocker 9-anthracene carboxylic acid. In contrast, PMA failed to induce ICl when either staurosporine or calphostin C was added to the patch pipette solution used to internally dialyze the myocytes. The kinetic properties of PMA- and FSK-induced ICl were similar. When supramaximal concentrations of both ISO (1 mumol/L) and PMA (6 mumol/L) were applied simultaneously, the size of the induced ICl was the same as that induced by the same concentrations of either agonist applied alone. In addition, maximal induction of ICl with PMA (6 mumol/L) prevented the effects of FSK (1 mumol/L, the concentration causing approximately 40% of the maximal response [approximately EC40]), yet the effects of simultaneously applied submaximal concentrations (eg, approximately EC25 to approximately EC40) of both 0.5 mumol/L PMA and 1 mumol/L FSK were roughly additive. The results suggest that (1) both PMA and ISO or FSK can induce ICl with approximately equal efficacy, (2) the PMA- and ISO- or FSK-induced ICls are similar, and (3) they all flow through the same set of Cl- channels, implying that channel phosphorylation via either PKA or PKC can activate this feline cardiac ICl.",

Nine subjects received intravenous metoprolol (10-15 mg i.v.), intravenous atropine (0.03 mg/kg i.v.), or a saline solution as placebo condition before undertaking a test of the defense response to a distorted sound of 400 Hz frequency, 109 dB intensity, 0.5 sec duration and virtually instantaneous risetime. Dependent variables were continuous (beat-to-beat) heart rate, stroke volume and blood pressure. The results suggest: (1) a vagal origen of the first acceleration and first deceleration and a sympathetic-parasympathetic interaction during the second acceleration and second deceleration of the heart rate response; (2) a blood pressure response pattern characterized by an increase during the first heart rate deceleration (4-11 sec), a posterior decrease coinciding with the second heart rate acceleration (from 12 to 37 sec), and a lighter increase during the second heart rate deceleration (from 38 to 63 sec); and (3) an implication of the baroreceptor reflex, including a baroreceptor mediated inhibition of the parasympathetic cardiac activity during the second accelerative component of the cardiac response.", 
    "45": "The authors' data on time-related changes in the contractile activity of non-innervated smooth muscle amnion of the chick embryo devoid of blood vessels and on involvement of the amniotic fluid neurotransmitters in regulation of the amnion motor activity have been summarized. A scheme of possible mechanism underlying regulation of the spontaneous rhythmic contractile activity of the amnion by two antagonistic neurotransmitters present in the amniotic fluid: serotonin and noradrenalin, which stimulate and inhibit the amnion motor activity, respectively. The results of experiments on successive block of the serotonin and adrenergic receptors by introduction of the corresponding antagonists in the chick embryo amniotic fluid speak in favor of the proposed scheme of humoral regulation of the amnion motor activity. A possible involvement of this humoral mechanism in the inhibitory effect of increased carbon dioxide content of the air on the amnion motor activity has been considered.", 
    "46": "To define the time course of regression of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) during antihypertensive therapy with beta-blocking agents, 73 hypertensive patients were serially studied by echocardiography during 12-months therapy with beta-blockers. Blood pressure decreased significantly after 1 month and further on after 12 months (from 164 +/- 18/110 +/- 9 to 139 +/- 14/94 +/- 7 mmHg, p < 0.001). Left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic dimension increased significantly after 1 month (from 51.2 +/- 3.9 to 52.2 +/- 4.7 mm, p < 0.01) and decreased after 12 months (50.4 +/- 4.0 mm, p < 0.05). Septal and posterior wall thickness decreased progressively after 1 month and 3 months, respectively. LV mass index decreased significantly after 3 months, and further on after 12 months (from 164 +/- 42 to 145 +/- 33 g/m2, p < 0.001). LV fractional shortening did not significantly change throughout the study. Thus, a reduction of hypertensive LVH occurred after 3 months of therapy with beta-blocking agents and went on during the subsequent months without impairment of LV systolic function.", 
    "47": "In precollicular decerebrate cats, intermittent sinusoidal roll tilt of the whole animal (at 0.15 Hz, +/- 10 degrees) produced a vestibulospinal reflex (VSR), characterized by an increased EMG activity of the forelimb extensor triceps brachii during side-down and a decreased activity during side-up tilt. This reflex was first tested during and after a 3-h period of sustained animal tilt at the same parameters indicated above. An adaptive increase in gain of the VSR progressively developed in some experiments, but not in others. In a second group of experiments, however, sinusoidal roll tilt of the head (0.15 Hz, +/- 10 degrees) was associated with a synchronous roll tilt of the body (at 0.15 Hz, +/- 12.5 degrees). This additional stimulus led to 2.5 degrees of neck rotation, which was thus out of phase with respect to head rotation. In all these experiments, submitted to a 3-h period of sustained neck-vestibular stimulation, the gain of the VSR tested every 10-15 min consistently increased to reach the maximum at the end of the third hour of stimulation. This adaptive process was followed up to 1 h after stimulation. Microinjection into the hemivermal cortex of the cerebellar anterior lobe of the beta-noradrenergic antagonists propranolol or sotalol (0.25-0.50 microliter at 8 micrograms/microliter saline) produced only slight and short-lasting changes in the basic amplitude of the VSR, but always decreased or prevented the occurrence of the adaptive increase in gain of the VSR during sustained out of phase head-neck rotation. The same agents also suppressed the increase in gain of the VSR which occurred in some experiments during sustained roll tilt of the whole animal (at 0.15 Hz, +/- 10 degrees), leading to selective stimulation of labyrinth receptors. On the other hand, the beta-noradrenergic agonist isoproterenol (0.25 microliters at 8 micrograms/microliters saline) brought to the light the adaptive process in other experiments in which no adaptation occurred during sustained animal rotation. These effects occurred when the sites of injection were located within the zone B of the cerebellar anterior vermis, which projects to the lateral vestibular nucleus. In conclusion, the results indicate that the adaptive changes affecting the gain of the VSR in decerebrate cats are facilitated by the noradrenergic afferent system acting on the cerebellar vermis through beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "48": "All rats were maintained on liquid diet, prepared from their ordinary hard pelleted diet, for a week, then fasted 32-33 h and subsequently either fed liquid or pelleted diet for 60-90 min or serving as non-fed controls. Both the fed and the non-fed animals had received atropine and alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists 15 min before the test. The rats given the liquefied chow consumed about twice as much as those given the hard chow. In the parotid glands of the rats given hard chow the number of acinar granules and the total amylase activity were reduced, by 50 and 70%, respectively, as compared with the glands of control rats. In the parotid glands of the rats given liquefied chow the number of acinar granules and the total activity of amylase remained unchanged. The results suggest that non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic secretory mechanisms of the rat parotid gland participate in masticatory-salivary reflexes.", 
    "49": "Earlier studies suggest that cardiovascular responses in the laboratory and in the field are likely to be related when the laboratory tasks involve active coping, when the field measure is taken continuously, and when there is allowance for the effects of autocorrelation and physical activity on the ambulant cardiovascular measure. These studies lead to the hypothesis that the hyperreactivity common to the laboratory and to the field has a beta-adrenergic basis. We examined the heart rate variability of 16 hyperreactive and 16 hyporeactive subjects over an 8-hour period while they were receiving either a placebo or a cardio-selective beta-blocking drug (Bisoprolol) in a double-blind crossover design. Subjects were classified on the basis of their heart rate and systolic blood pressure responses to a complex self-paced, reaction-time task. Response in the field was assessed from the standard deviation of the raw heart rate series, after allowance for the serial dependency in the data using autoregressive methods and, when allowance was made for physical activity, assessed from the muscle activity of the thigh. As predicted, on placebo hyperreactive subjects had markedly more variable heart rates, particularly when allowance was made for physical activity. Although not confirmed by a significant interaction effect, this difference largely disappeared under beta-blockade.",

Lymphocyte beta-adrenergic receptors were characterized in terms of receptor density (Bmax). Individuals with high life stress had lower Bmax (p < .005). In multiple regression analyses, 50% of the variance in Bmax was accounted for by life stress and coping style (p = .01). Receptor measures may be useful for characterizing the physiological response to continuing life adversity.", 
    "51": "Propranolol can reduce portal hypertension, therefore is recommended in prevention of variceal bleeding in patients with liver cirrhosis. However, in certain patients with cirrhosis portal hypotensive effect of propranolol cannot be obtained, and the reason of this finding is unknown. In 28 patients with cirrhosis the effect of seven days administration of propranolol on collateral blood flow from inferior mesenteric vein was examined by means of per-rectal portal scintigraphy. Portosystemic shunt index was significantly reduced by propranolol by 17.4 +/- 4.8%. This reduction was observed in cirrhotics classified to A and B, but not C Child-Pugh. These data suggest that propranolol increases vascular resistance in portosystemic circulation which depends on severity of liver failure. This mechanism opposes reduction of portal pressure.", 
    "52": "Power spectrum analysis of accommodative microfluctuations has identified two dominant frequency components: a low frequency component (LFC < 0.6 Hz) and a high frequency component (1.3 Hz < HFC < 2.5 Hz). Computer-driven models of accommodation and experimental manipulation of accommodative feedback loops indicate that LFCs are likely to have a functional role in monitoring retinal image contrast during sustained accommodation. In contrast HFCs have been shown to be correlated with arterial pulse frequency and consequently their characteristics can be modified by the extra- and intra-ocular vascular (and possibly CNS) effects. For example, topical instillation of the non-selective beta-antagonist timolol maleate has shown previously the ability to modify the HFC. In an attempt to clarify proposed differences between beta-adrenoceptor antagonist agents with regard to their effects on systemic and ocular vasculature, we extend the potential offered by HFCs as a non-invasive method of assessing the ocular response to beta-antagonists to the cardioselective beta-antagonist betaxolol HCl. Accommodative microfluctuations were measured using a continuously recording infrared optometer on 10 emmetropic subjects (mean age 23.9 +/- 2.3 years) who viewed a high contrast target located at a vergence of -4 D. A double-blind protocol was employed between saline and betaxolol (0.5%, 2 x 30 microliters) following corneal anaesthesia. Local and systemic effects were separated by examining the treated and untreated eyes of three subjects. Power spectrum analysis indicated that the root mean square (r.m.s.) value and power of LFCs and HFCs were equivalent for the saline and betaxolol trials.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "53": "To evaluate the antiarrhythmic efficacy of l-sotalol and bisoprolol on inducible ventricular arrhythmias, conscious dogs with 4- to 8-day-old myocardial infarction were studied by programmed electrical stimulation. Direct recordings from infarcted and adjacent normal subepicardium were made using a specially designed composite electrode. From 18 dogs developing sustained ventricular tachycardia (sVT) during control stimulation, l-sotalol (1.5 mg/kg i.v.) prevented reinducibility of sVT in 10 animals, while in seven other animals it significantly reduced the rate of tachycardia. Bisoprolol (0.2 mg/kg i.v.), tested in a separate group of 10 dogs susceptible to sVT, was mostly ineffective in preventing or slowing the tachycardia. Both agents significantly prolonged conduction time and refractoriness within the atrioventricular conduction system, and decreased heart rate. However, while l-sotalol lengthened ventricular refractoriness and QT interval, bisoprolol exerted only a minor effect on these parameters. Neither of the drugs affected conduction in normal and infarcted myocardium, as indicated by almost unchanged QRS complex width and duration of ventricular late potentials, respectively. The results indicate that acute beta-blockade is ineffective against sVT induced during the subacute stage of myocardial infarction. The antiarrhythmic efficacy of l-sotalol may predominantly be related to its prolonging effect on ventricular refractoriness, supporting the concept of pure class III action.", 
    "54": "The ability to predict in vivo oral absorption potential based on ex vivo screening in an everted intestinal ring model was examined. In vitro drug accumulation in cross sectional rings of everted rat jejunum was determined with 12 compounds whose in vivo absorptions (as distinct from bioavailabilities) are well characterized. The compounds examined ranged from well- to poorly-absorbed and included compounds absorbed by active and passive mechanisms. The effects of drug concentration, pH, cosolvents, and tissue origin site on drug accumulation were determined. Light microscopic observation indicated that the mucosal tissue remained intact up to 3 h after the intestine was excised. Accumulations of two nonabsorbable markers were also determined as measures of tissue integrity. A strong correlation (slope = 23 pmol/mg of tissue weight per percent oral absorption, r2 = 0.9430 by linear regression analysis) of in vitro uptake into everted rings from a 10 mM drug solution versus the known in vivo bioavailability for each compound was observed. These results indicated that under appropriate conditions, in vitro uptake of drug by the everted intestinal ring model closely paralleled known in vivo bioavailability and was relatively independent of pH, cosolvent, and tissue origin.", 
    "55": "We investigated in the isolated perfused rat liver (IPRL) whether product inhibition of metabolism contributes to the dose-dependent bioavailability of propranolol, a drug with a high, but saturable, hepatic first-pass effect. (+/-)-Propranolol was infused in the IPRL, using a recirculating design, for three 36-min periods (n = 9). Mean steady-state reservoir, i.e. hepatic inflow concentrations (Cin), were 4.97, 10.4, and 20.4 microM, respectively. Mean reservoir concentrations of the metabolites 4'-hydroxypropranolol, 5'-hydroxypropranolol, N-desisopropylpropranolol, and naphthoxylactic acid (NLA), a major side-chain-oxidation metabolite, increased disproportionately with propranolol dose, but their production rate did not reach steady state. In separate experiments (n = 4), perfusate containing 7.1, 12.8, and 21.6 microM (+/-)-propranolol, corresponding to administration rates of 114, 205, and 346 nmol/min, respectively, was passed through the liver for 30 min each using a single-pass design. The bioavailability (hepatic outflow concentration/Cin) of propranolol increased with Cin from 0.012 to 0.150 to 0.288 in the recirculating IPRL. In the single-pass IPRL the increase (0.0077 in 0.0669 to 0.136) was significantly less (P < 0.001). The greater bioavailability of propranolol in recirculating experiments was attributed to product inhibition since metabolites do not accumulate with the single-pass design. NLA did not appear to be the inhibiting metabolite because in further single-pass experiments with propranolol Cin of 21.6 microM the presence of NLA (21.6 microM) in perfusate had no effect on propranolol bioavailability (n = 7) compared with control experiments (n = 5).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The effects of propranolol (2 or 10 mg/kg body wt), nadolol (10 mg/kg), and labetalol (10 mg/kg) on physiological responses (including changes in body temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate) were examined. Lethal temperatures in the labetalol and both propranolol groups were significantly lower than in saline controls. Survival time was significantly less only in the high-dose propranolol group. In all groups, heart rate increased continuously during exposure; blood pressure increased until colonic temperature reached 41-41.5 degrees C and then decreased. These heart rate and blood pressure changes were similar to those that occur during environmental heat stress. Heart rate and blood pressure changes among groups were similar. Respiratory rate, however, was significantly elevated during most of the exposure period in the high-dose propranolol animals. This change in respiration, coupled with the significantly lower survival time in these animals, suggests a vital role of respiration in susceptibility to microwave-induced heating.", 
    "66": "Effects of beta-adrenergic stimulation on the membrane potential and intracellular Na+, K+, Cl- activities and pH (pHi) were examined in isolated guinea-pig ventricular muscles using conventional and ion-selective microelectrodes. Isoproterenol (1 microM) produced a transient membrane depolarization followed by a slight hyperpolarization in quiescent papillary muscles. Although the isoproterenol (1 microM)-induced depolarization was not blocked by tetrodotoxin (10 microM), nifedipine (10 microM), Cs+ (5 mM), Ba2+ (0.3 mM), amiloride (1 mM) or ouabain (10 microM), it was significantly attenuated by anthracene-9-carboxylic acid (9 AC, 1 mM), a Cl(-)-channel blocker. Intracellular K+ activity increased, whereas intracellular Na+ activity slightly decreased during beta-adrenergic stimulation. Intracellular Cl- activity significantly decreased during the isoproterenol-induced depolarization of the resting membrane potential, which was attenuated by 9 AC. Isoproterenol significantly decreased pHi, which was enhanced by amiloride. 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid(DIDS, 1 mM), a stilbene derivative possessing blocking action on Cl-/HCO3- exchange system and Na+/HCO3- symport system, failed to affect the isoproterenol-induced acidosis, but pretreatment with 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG, 5.5 mM) or iodoacetic acid(IAA, 0.3 mM) abolished the isoproterenol-induced pHi decrease. Thus, beta-adrenergic stimulation decreased aiCl, aiNa and pHi, and increased aiK. The decrease in aiCl may be ascribed to the activation of Cl- channels, and opposite changes in aiNa and aiK appear to be due to the beta-adrenoceptor mediated activation of Na+/K+ pump. Acceleration of glycolysis during beta-adrenergic stimulation may be responsible for the intracellular acidosis. These changes in intracellular ionic activities may play a role in the modulation of electromechanical response to beta-adrenergic stimulation.",

In contrast, the pediatric porcine myocardium displays no change in left ventricular systolic function from baseline within 6 hours of brain death. This work investigates whether the beta-adrenergic receptor/adenylyl cyclase pathway remains intact after induction of brain death in the pediatric porcine model. Thirteen 1-month-old swine (7 to 10 kg) were anesthetized and underwent median sternotomy, and baseline transmural left ventricular biopsy specimens were obtained before ligation of head vessels to induce brain death in six piglets, with the remaining seven serving as controls. Baseline left ventricular biopsy specimens were obtained just before and 1 and 3 hours after brain death or at matched time points without brain death in the control group. Myocardial tissue was then analyzed for beta-adrenergic receptor density with the use of saturation [125I]-iodocyanopindolol binding in the absence and presence of propranolol 1 mumol/L. Coupling of the beta-adrenergic receptor to its signal transduction system (stimulation of adenylyl cyclase) was tested at three levels: beta-adrenergic receptor (isoproterenol 100 mumol/L), stimulatory G protein Gs (sodium fluoride 10 mmol/L), and the adenylyl cyclase moiety itself (forskolin 100 mumol/L).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "78": "1. The 4-hydroxylation of propranolol by rat and human liver microsomes is associated with formation of a chemically reactive species which binds irreversibly to cytochrome P4502D6 (CYP2D6) destroying its catalytic function. Therefore, the effect of propranolol treatment (80 mg twice daily) on debrisoquine phenotype was examined, to see if it resulted in phenocopying in vivo. The role of 4-hydroxypropranolol (4OHP) in the inhibition of CYP2D6 activity was also studied using microsomes from yeast expressing CYP2D6 and from human livers; metoprolol was used as the CYP2D6 substrate. 2. Although a significant effect on apparent oxidation phenotype was demonstrated, the absolute change in the urinary debrisoquine/4-hydroxydebrisoquine ratio (D/4HD) was small, such that no extensive metaboliser who received propranolol treatment was reclassified as a poor metaboliser. The in vitro studies indicated that 4OHP is a potent inhibitor of metoprolol metabolism (Ki approximately 1 microM). This inhibitory effect was enhanced when 4OHP was pre-incubated in the presence of a NADPH generating system and human liver microsomes. The effect was decreased significantly when reduced glutathione was added to the pre-incubation mixture. Metabolism of 4OHP occurred when incubated with human liver microsomes in the presence of a NADPH generating system and irrespective of CYP2D6 phenotype; yeast expressing CYP2D6 did not metabolise 4OHP. 3. We conclude that, although treatment with propranolol 80 mg twice daily significantly decreases the catalytic function of CYP2D6, the inhibition is insufficient to result in phenocopying. The reactive intermediate produced by further metabolism of 4OHP is probably scavenged effectively in vivo by glutathione and other nucleophiles.",

The atherogenic index (ratio between total cholesterol and HDL2 plus HDL3) was also decreased. Blood glucose levels remained unchanged in both normoglycemic patients and those with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) during 3 years of therapy.

Furthermore, whether or not such blood pressure readings are sufficient proof of efficacy is still under discussion. Thus, a multicenter study was devised wherein blood pressure were recorded by CR, self-recordings, and noninvasive ambulatory monitoring (ABM). A total of 595 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension were treated for 6 months starting with 1.25 mg of isradipine twice daily. If, after 4 weeks of treatment, CR-determined diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was still > 90 mm Hg, this dosage was doubled (n = 327) and, at week 8, pindolol at 5 mg or spirapril at 3 mg daily was added if necessary for blood pressure control. On the basis of CR, the results confirmed that low dosages of isradipine twice daily are safe and effective in the treatment of mild-to-moderate hypertension. The mean decrease in CR-determined blood pressure was 28.5/19.0 mm Hg at week 24, and the normalization rate (DBP < or = 90 mm Hg) for all patients treated was 78.2%. However, SR-determined blood pressure reduction was 20.0/13.0 mm Hg, with a normalization rate of 42%, whereas ABM-determined blood pressure reduction was 7.0/4.2 mm Hg. On the basis of ABM recordings, 66% of the patients had a DBP < 90 mm Hg on entry into the study and their blood pressures did not decrease with treatment. Thus, it appears that CR-determined blood pressures bias study results by including normotensives and thereby overestimating efficacy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "81": "Little is known about the regulation of 5-hydroxytryptamine1B (5-HT1B) receptors, a putative terminal autoreceptor in the central nervous system. We studied the regional responses of [125I]iodocyanopindolol ([125I]ICYP)-labeled central 5-HT1B sites to chronic treatment with 5-HT agonists and antagonists at a dose of 10 mg/kg/d IP for 30 consecutive days in the rat. In controls, there were 3.4-fold regional differences in Bmax, with a rank order of brainstem > hippocampus > cortex, striatum > spinal cord, and Kas were slightly lower in striatum and spinal cord. RU 24969 significantly reduced Bmax 23 to 63% in cortex, hippocampus, striatum, brainstem, and spinal cord without a change in Ka except for a 1.7-fold increase in cortex and spinal cord. The putative 5-HT1B agonist (m-trifluoromethyl-phenylpiperazine (TFMPP), but not [1-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazine] (m-CPP) or the 5-HT1B antagonists pindolol or quipazine, reduced the Bmax of cortical 5-HT1B sites (-16%). Chronic treatment with the 5-HT antagonists methysergide, pindolol, propranolol, ritanserin, metergoline, or methiothepin did not significantly affect striatal Bmax or Kd compared to respective vehicles. The data demonstrate significant changes in maximum number of 5-HT1B receptors in response to chronic agonist but not antagonist treatments at the dose studied.", 
    "82": "Guidelines for the management of high blood pressure have been recently actualized by several expert panels. These reports display many common features: 1) non-pharmacological or pharmacological therapy should be initiated only after careful evaluation of hypertension (including repeated measurements of blood pressure) and associated cardiovascular risk factors; 2) life-style modifications should always be recommended: weight loss when overweight, regular physical activity, sodium restriction, moderation of alcohol consumption, smoking cessation; 3) initial drug therapy: all reports advocate the use of a low-dose diuretic or of a beta-blocker. According to contraindications or concomitant disease(s), other drugs can be used as initial therapy: converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium antagonists, alpha 1-blockers, alpha-beta-blockers.", 
    "83": "1. The aim of the present study was to investigate the origin and modulation of 5-hydroxytryptamine release in dorsal hippocampus of freely moving rats using brain microdialysis. 2. Basal release of 5-hydroxytryptamine and 5-hydroxyindole-acetic acid was 3.0 +/- 0.2 pg/15 min and 519 +/- 18 pg/15 min, respectively. Stimulation by 60 mM K+ increased 5-hydroxytryptamine release by 66%. Inclusion of 10 microM tetrodotoxin in the perfusion medium reduced 5-hydroxytryptamine release to approximately 5% of basal levels. 3. In addition, release could be modulated by the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-N-propylamino)-tetralin (50 % decrease) and this effect was completely blocked by the 5-hydroxytryptamine-1 receptor antagonist pindolol. 4. These data are in concordance with results from the ventral hippocampus and indicate that release of 5-hydroxytryptamine is predominantly of neuronal origin. In contrast with other studies, the authors found the non-selective 5-hydroxytryptamine-1 antagonist, pindolol, to increase 5-hydroxytryptamine release by 65% following systemic administration. This may hint at a different autoreceptor control in serotonergic fibers ascending from the median raphe as compared to the dorsal raphe nucleus.",

DOPS (4-8 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly shortened the latency of seizures elicited by strychnine (2 mg/kg, i.p.). Similarly, DOPS (4 mg/kg, i.p.) effectively increased the incidence and significantly shortened the latency of seizures induced by strychnine (1 mg/kg, i.p.). 4. Imipramine (20-40 mg/kg, i.p.) and pargyline (200 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly shortened the latency of strychnine (2 mg/kg, i.p.)-induced seizures. 5. Phentolamine (5-20 mg/kg, i.p.) effectively antagonised the seizures elicited by strychnine (2 mg/kg, i.p.). Furthermore, phentolamine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) attenuated the seizure-potentiating effect of DOPS (4 mg/kg, i.p.). 6. Propranolol (0.5-2 mg/kg, i.p.) and prazosin (1-2 mg/kg, i.p.) reduced the incidence and significantly delayed the latency of seizures induced by strychnine (2 mg/kg, i.p.). 7. Reserpine (5-10 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly prolonged the latency of strychnine (2 mg/kg, i.p.)-induced seizures. 8. Clonidine (0.25-1 mg/kg, i.p.) dose-dependently and significantly antagonised strychnine (2 mg/kg, i.p.)-induced seizures. 9. Idazoxan (1-4 mg/kg, i.p.) in a dose related manner significantly shortened the latency of seizures induced by strychnine (2 mg/kg, i.p.). Similarly, idazoxan (2 mg/kg, i.p.) profoundly potentiated seizures elicited by strychnine (1 mg/kg, i.p.).

Disulfiram (3 x 25 - 3 x 100 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly attenuated strychnine (2 mg/kg, i.p.)-induced seizures. DOPS (4 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly potentiated strychnine seizures in disulfiram (3 x 100 mg/kg, i.p.)-pretreated animals. 11.

    "85": "1. The last two decades have witnessed an upsurge in the interest in anxiety disorders. Much research effort has been dedicated to panic disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder. However, it is only very recently that we have begun to understand some of the basic principles about the psychopharmacology of social phobia. 2. Drug classes sofar studied include beta-blockers, nonselective and irreversible MAO-inhibitors (MAOI's) and benzodiazepines. 3. Beta blockers appear to be of use in specific social phobias, like public speaking. There is considerable evidence suggesting that MAOI's are effective in reducing both social anxiety as well as social avoidance. A disadvantage of the conventional irreversible MAOI's is their risk for hypertensive crises when combined with dietary tyramine. So far only a small number of studies with selective MAOI-A inhibitors such as moclobemide and brofaromine have been conducted in social phobia, and the results indicate that both compounds are effective. 4. Drugs exerting selective and specific actions on certain compounds of e.g. the serotonergic system can now be studied and it is hoped that the role of 5-HT and other neuronal systems in social phobia can be elucidated. 5. In order to gain more information about selective serotonergic drugs the first double blind placebo controlled study with fluvoxamine in social phobia is here reported. Preliminary results indicate a reduction of social anxiety. 6. Finally the role of peptides in the treatment of social phobia is critically reviewed. The MSH/ACTH analog Org 2766 was investigated in patients suffering from social phobia. No anxiolytic effects of this peptide could be observed.", 
    "86": "The reverse micelle-based microemulsion was proposed as a vector for the transdermal delivery of propranolol. Soya-lecithin forms reverse micelle in iso-octane with increased solubilizing potential. The lecithin/iso-octane system was studied for the nature of solubilized water, the effect of added water on viscosity, and drug-micelle interaction. The amount and nature of solubilized water was investigated by spectroscopic methods using potassium nitrate as the polarity probe. With increasing water content the viscosity of the system was found to increase. And at a molar ratio (R) = 3, the system showed gel-like consistency (8.1 x 10(3) poise). The polarity probe study suggested the difference in environment of solubilized water as compared with the bulk water. The permeability rate of propranolol contained in the water/lecithin/iso-octane system was calculated to be 1212.0 micrograms h cm-2 while in the case of petrolatum jelly it was recorded to be 122.8 micrograms h-1 cm-2.", 
    "87": "A 40-year-old man developed dyspepsia, watery diarrhea, and weight loss. A clinical diagnosis of hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease was confirmed [free thyroxine, 87 pmol/L (normal range, 8.6-27 pmol/L)]. Bile acid malabsorption was demonstrated by a low 23-selena-25-homocholyltauric acid retention of 7.1% (normal, > 15%). Antithyroid treatment (carbimazole and propranolol) was instituted, and his diarrhea subsided with the control of hyperthyroidism (free thyroxine, 15 pmol/L) along with an improvement of bile acid absorption (Se-HCAT retention, 14.7%). This case very strongly suggests the existence of bile acid malabsorption in hyperthyroidism. The temporal association suggests that the diarrhea may have been due at least in part to bile acid malabsorption, raising the possibility that the latter may be an etiological factor in thyrotoxic diarrhea. We believe this is the first such report.", 
    "88": "Central nervous system (CNS)-related symptoms and quality of life during treatment with controlled-release (CR) metoprolol and a standard formulation of atenolol were compared in a double-blind crossover study in 60 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. After a 4-week placebo run-in period, each beta 1-adrenoceptor blocker was administered at a dosage of 100 mg once daily for 6 weeks. Quality of life was assessed regularly during the active treatment phases by use of two standardized self-administered questionnaires, the minor symptom evaluation (MSE) profile, and the psychologic general well-being (PGWB) index. Both questionnaires have previously been shown to be effective in detecting CNS symptoms and changes in well being produced by beta-blockers. Blood pressure and heart rate were monitored to assess the antihypertensive efficacy of the two drugs. Metoprolol CR and atenolol produced equivalent, clinically effective reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressures measured 24 hours after administration. The drugs were found to exert similar effects on general well being, as assessed by the PGWB index, and there were no significant differences between the two treatments with regard to the three dimensions of the MSE profile, contentment, vitality, and sleep. Thus, at equivalent antihypertensive dosages, metoprolol CR and atenolol are clinically comparable with regard to the degree of CNS-related symptoms produced and effects on general well being. Because these agents differ markedly in lipophilicity, other factors, such as beta 1-selectivity/nonselectivity, may be more important determinants of whether these subjective symptoms occur during therapy with beta-blockers.", 
    "89": "We investigated the possible effects on retinal blood flow of betaxolol, a beta blocker which is used as antiglaucomatous medication. Ring segments of retinal microarteries were isolated from bovine eyes and mounted in an organ bath for measurement of contractile force. The effects of betaxolol were studied during K(+)-, stretch-, and serotonin-induced contractions, to enable comparison to the effects of the standard beta blocker propranolol and the Ca2+ channel blocker verapamil. Betaxolol relaxed K(+)-induced contractions in a dose-dependent manner. The drug relaxed the phasic part of the K(+)-induced contractions more than the tonic part. Betaxolol had no effect on stretch-induced contractions. The tonic part of the serotonin-induced contractions showed a trend to decrease in response to betaxolol. These highly specific effects of betaxolol resembled the effects of propranolol. Since betaxolol has significantly less membrane stabilizing activity than has propranolol, this activity is not responsible for the relaxant action of beta blockers on retinal microarteries. The action of both beta blockers resembled the action of the Ca2+ channel blocker verapamil.", 
    "90": "1. The action of niflumic acid was studied on spontaneous and evoked calcium-activated chloride (ICl(Ca)) and potassium (IK(Ca)) currents in rabbit isolated portal vein cells. 2. With the nystatin perforated patch technique in potassium-containing solutions at a holding potential of -77 mV (the potassium equilibrium potential), niflumic acid produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of spontaneous transient inward current (STIC, calcium-activated chloride current) amplitude. The concentration to reduce the STIC amplitude by 50% (IC50) was 3.6 x 10(-6) M. 3. At -77 mV holding potential, niflumic acid converted the STIC decay from a single exponential to 2 exponential components. In niflumic acid the fast component of decay was faster, and the slow component was slower than the control decay time constant. Increasing the concentration of niflumic acid enhanced the decay rate of the fast component and reduced the decay rate of the slow component. 4. The effect of niflumic acid on STIC amplitude was voltage-dependent and at -50 and +50 mV the IC50 values were 2.3 x 10(-6) M and 1.1 x 10(-6) M respectively (cf. 3.6 x 10(-6) M at -77 mV). 5. In K-free solutions at potentials of -50 mV and +50 mV, niflumic acid did not induce a dual exponential STIC decay but just increased the decay time constant at both potentials in a concentration-dependent manner. 6. Niflumic acid, in concentrations up to 5 x 10(-5) M, had no effect on spontaneous calcium-activated potassium currents. 7. Niflumic acid inhibited noradrenaline- and caffeine-evoked IO(Ca) with an ICM50 of 6.6 x 10-6 M, i.e.was less potent against evoked currents compared to spontaneous currents. In contrast niflumic acid(2 x 10-6 M-5 x 105 M) increased noradrenaline- and caffeine-induced IK(ca).8. The results are discussed with respect to the mechanism of block of ICl(Ca) by niflumic acid and its suitability as a pharmacological tool for assessing the role of Ic(ca) in physiological mechanisms.", 
    "91": "1. The effects of long-term atenolol (25 mg kg-1 day-1) therapy on arterial function were studied in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. The 14-week treatment attenuated the increase in blood pressure by approximately 30 mmHg in SHR, but did not affect blood pressure in WKY rats. 2. Responses of mesenteric arterial rings in vitro were examined at the end of the study. The relaxation to acetylcholine was similar in WKY rats and atenolol-treated SHR and more pronounced than in untreated SHR, whereas the relaxation to the nitric oxide donor 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1) was comparable in all study groups. Moreover, after maximal relaxations to acetylcholine, marked recontractions developed in untreated SHR but not in the other groups. Vasorelaxation to isoprenaline was also attenuated in SHR and was moderately improved by the atenolol therapy. 3. Arterial relaxation induced by return of potassium to the organ bath upon precontractions elicited by potassium-free solution were used to evaluate vascular smooth muscle Na+, K+-ATPase. The rate of potassium relaxation was fastest in WKY rats and was also faster in atenolol-treated than in untreated SHR. 4. The ability of vascular smooth muscle to sequester calcium was evaluated by eliciting responses to caffeine or noradrenaline after loading periods in different organ bath calcium concentrations. The subsequent contractions were lower in untreated SHR than in WKY rats, and augmented in SHR by the atenolol treatment. 5. Smooth muscle contractions to noradrenaline were comparable in SHR and WKY rats, while atenolol treatment slightly increased the maximal response to this agonist in SHR. Responses to potassium chloride were not affected by atenolol and contractions following cumulative re-addition of calcium to the organ bath after precontraction with potassium chloride and noradrenaline in calcium free solution were comparable in all study groups.6. In conclusion, the moderate antihypertensive effect of atenolol in SHR was accompanied by enhancement of beta-adrenoceptor-mediated and normalization of endothelium-dependent arterial relaxation.Furthermore, ability to sequester calcium into cellular stores, and function of Na+,K+-ATPase were augmented in vascular smooth muscle. Therefore, the present results suggest that the long-term blood pressure-lowering action of atenolol in this type of genetic hypertension is accompanied by improved arterial relaxation and normalization of endothelial function.", 
    "92": "1. A wide panel of compounds acting on beta-adrenoceptors active either in mammalian heart or in rodent digestive tract and adipose tissues, were investigated for their effects on Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with the human or murine beta 3-adrenoceptor gene. 2. The beta 3-agonists, bucindolol, CGP 12177A and pindolol exhibited the highest binding affinities; BRL 37344, LY 79771, ICI 201651 and SR 58611A presented high potencies in stimulating adenylyl cyclase; bupranolol appeared as the most efficient beta 3-antagonist. 3. This pharmacological analysis further established that the beta 3-adrenoceptor is the prototype of the adipose tissue atypical beta-adrenoceptor, since these receptors share a number of pharmacological properties which differ strikingly from those of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors: low affinities for conventional beta-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists, high potencies for novel compounds active in adipose tissues, partial agonistic activities for several beta 1/beta 2-antagonists. 4. Although the pharmacological profiles of the human and murine beta 3-receptor were very similar, some quantitative or even qualitative differences were observed for particular compounds such as propranolol, which exhibited weak and partial agonistic effects at the human beta 3-receptors and antagonistic effects at the murine beta 3-receptors. These differences may result from key amino-acid substitutions between the human and the murine beta 3-receptor sequences, which may alter the binding site or signal processing. 5. Compounds active on atypical beta-sites of other tissues such as heart and digestive tract were also potent on the beta 3-adrenoceptor expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, suggesting that this receptor mediates most of the atypical properties described in various tissues, and that differences in ligand effects may result from tissue-related specificities.", 
    "93": "1. In rats, the atypical neuroleptic, clozapine, has been found to increase the hindlimb retraction time but not the forelimb retraction time, in the paw test. These parameters have predictive validity for the antipsychotic efficacy and extrapyramidal side-effects of drugs, respectively. The present study analysed to what extent drugs acting on adrenoceptors affect the behavioural effect of clozapine in the paw test. 2. The alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist, ST 587 but not the peripherally working alpha 1-agonist, methoxamine, decreased the effect of clozapine on the hindlimb retraction time. The alpha 1-antagonist phenoxybenzamine increased this effect of clozapine, and blocked the effect of ST 587 on clozapine at low doses. Only the combination of phenoxybenzamine with clozapine produced an increase in forelimb retraction time. 3. The alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, clonidine, decreased the effect of clozapine on the hindlimb retraction time. This effect was neither antagonized by the alpha 2-antagonist rauwolscine nor by the alpha 1-antagonist phenoxybenzamine. Rauwolscine or the peripherally working alpha 2-antagonist L-659,066 did not influence the effect of clozapine on the hindlimb retraction time. The forelimb retraction time was not affected by any of the drug combinations. 4. In contrast to the beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, clenbuterol, which was ineffective, the peripherally acting beta-agonist, (-)-isoprenaline, increased the effects of clozapine on the hindlimb retraction time. The beta-antagonist, (-)-propranolol as well as the peripherally acting beta-antagonist, nadolol decreased this effect of clozapine. Low doses of the peripherally acting beta 1-antagonist, atenolol, as well as low doses of the beta2-antagonist, ICI-118,551, decreased the effect of clozapine. A low dose of nadolol blocked the effect of (-)-isoprenaline on clozapine. Only the combination of clenbuterol with clozapine produced an increase in forelimb retraction time.5. It is concluded that blockade of central alpha l-adrenoceptors plays an important role in the effect of clozapine on the hindlimb retraction time. Furthermore, the effect of clozapine on the hindlimb retraction time is strongly modulated by peripheral beta 1- and/or beta 2-adrenoceptors. Given the predictive validity of the paw test, the presented data suggest that the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist properties of clozapine are important for its therapeutic effects, but not for its lack of extrapyramidal side-effects.", 
    "94": "The antianginal efficacy of a fixed combination of atenolol (50 mg) and nifedipine (20 mg) was compared with nifedipine (20 mg) alone; 102 patients experiencing three or more anginal attacks on their current monotherapy received each treatment twice daily for 3 weeks in a randomised, double-blind crossover trial. Both treatments reduced the weekly number of angina attacks compared with existing therapy; treatment with the fixed combination resulted in significantly fewer angina attacks per week than treatment with nifedipine alone. Also, when the fixed combination treatment followed the period of nifedipine therapy a further decrease in weekly angina attack rate was apparent. Comparison of individual patient response to each treatment showed that twice as many patients reported lower attack rates while on the fixed combination: 6 patients were withdrawn while receiving fixed combination compared with 10 patients on nifedipine alone. However, the incidence of commonly reported complaints was similar with both treatments.",

In all species [3H]CGP-12177 binding (up to 3 nM) indicated the existence of a homogeneous population of binding sites in fat cell membranes, and competition studies showed that beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors were present. Selective beta 1 or beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists induced lipolysis. The efficiencies of isoproterenol and norepinephrine were similar. The use of selective beta 3-adrenoceptor agonists revealed that BRL-37344 and CL-316243 were full agonists, whereas CGP-12177 and SR-58611A were partial agonists in rat and dog white fat cells. beta 3-Agonists partially stimulated lipolysis in the marmoset, while CGP-12177 was weakly active in the baboon. In macaque and human fat cells, beta 3-agonists were ineffective. The lipolytic effect of norepinephrine involves beta 1-and/or beta 2-adrenoceptors in baboon, macaque, and human.

    "106": "Male Sprague-Dawley rats, treated with either saline (n = 14) or guanethidine (n = 12) from 1 to 13 wk of age, were instrumented for the measurement of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and indexes of regional blood flows (pulsed Doppler flow probes) in the subdiaphragmatic aorta, superior mesenteric artery, and distal aorta (hindquarters). Hemodynamic parameters were simultaneously recorded in the conscious rats on a beat-to-beat basis by a computer. Chronic sympathectomy did not change the MAP level but nearly doubled its spontaneous variability, mainly due to large decreases in MAP associated with regional vasodilations that were slightly delayed with respect to the onset of the decreases in pressure, especially in the aortic and mesenteric circulations. In the hindquarters vascular bed, the onset of vasodilations sometimes coincided with the onset of the decreases in MAP. During depressor episodes, blood flow varied little (aortic and mesenteric circulations) or even increased (hindquarters). This hemodynamic pattern was not affected by acute beta-adrenoceptor blockade. We conclude that chronic sympathectomy sensitizes the cardiovascular system to decreases in arterial pressure mainly by unmasking local autoregulatory responses of regional circulations. The sympathetic control of vascular tone overrides these responses and considerably limits the MAP variability.", 
    "107": "To determine whether paced breathing (PB) and respiratory interval of PB modify the relationship between spectral components of heart rate variability (HRV) and cardiac vagal tone, we studied seven healthy young males under the condition of beta-adrenergic blockade by intravenous propranolol (0.2 mg/kg). Compared with spontaneous breathing, PB at the same respiratory interval as that of individual spontaneous breathing showed no significant effect on the amplitude of the high-frequency (HF) component or the mean R-R interval in either the supine or tilt position, whereas the PB decreased the amplitude of the low-frequency (LF; 0.04-0.15 Hz) component in both positions (P = 0.004 and 0.042, respectively). When the respiratory interval was increased from 3 to 6 s, the HF amplitude showed a progressive increase in both positions (P = 0.001 and 0.035, respectively), while the LF amplitude and mean R-R interval remained unchanged. These results indicate that the effects of PB and respiratory interval on the spectral components of HRV are not mediated by the changes in mean cardiac vagal tone and support the hypothesis that increased respiratory interval amplifies the respiratory-related vagal modulation of heart rate.",

Compared to (-)-nicotine, ABT 418 has reduced potency to interact with the subunit isoforms of nAChR found in sympathetic ganglia, and it does not compete for alpha-bungarotoxin binding sites in brain or at the neuromuscular junction. ABT 418 [minimum effective dose (MED), 0.062 mumol/kg i.p.) was 10-fold more potent in improving retention of avoidance learning in normal mice than (-)-nicotine, whereas the (R)-enantiomer of ABT 418, A-81754, was inactive. The memory-enhancing effect of ABT 418 was prevented by the nAChR channel blocker, mecamylamine.

A-81754, did not have anxiolytic-like effects in this test. Unlike the classical anxiolytic, diazepam, ABT 418 did not impair rotorod performance in the dose range where beneficial effects occurred. In rats, ABT 418 (MED, 0.002 mumol/kg i.v.) was remarkably potent in enhancing basal forebrain-elicited increases in cortical cerebral blood flow, whereas resting cerebral blood flow was unaffected. Free running cortical electroencephalography in rats was unaffected by ABT 418 at a dose of 1.9 mumol/kg i.p., whereas the same dose of (-)-nicotine caused cortical activation (decreased power in the 1-13 Hz range and increased power in the 25-50 Hz range). Whereas ABT 418 was approximately 3- to 10-fold more potent than (-)-nicotine in memory enhancement and anxiolytic test paradigms, the compound had less emetic liability in dogs as compared to (-)-nicotine, and was less potent than (-)-nicotine in eliciting hypothermia, seizures, death and reduction of locomotor activity in mice. The measured pharmacokinetic or brain disposition properties of ABT 418 in rats did not account for the observed enhancement in efficacy with reduced toxicity as compared to (-)-nicotine. The potent cognitive-enhancing and anxiolytic properties obtained for ABT 418 in animal models without eliciting significant side effects suggest that this ligand is a selective activator of cholinergic channel-mediated behaviors. Thus, ABT 418 may represent a novel, safe and effective treatment of the cognitive and emotional dysfunctions associated with Alzheimer's disease.", 
    "110": "Diaspirin cross-linked hemoglobin (DCLHB; Baxter Healthcare Corp., Blood Substitutes Division) is a promising hemoglobin-based oxygen-carrying resuscitative solution. DCLHb (400 mg/kg, intravenously) produces an immediate increase in blood pressure when administered to conscious or anesthetized rats. To determine the role of the central nervous system and the peripheral vascular system in the pressor effect of DCLHb, experiments were performed in cervical-sectioned rats. Intravenous administration of DCLHb produced an increase in blood pressure in cervical-sectioned animals (41.2 +/- 2.5 mm Hg), which was similar to that observed in normal rats. To test whether the pressor effect was due to release of catecholamines or other pressor substances from the adrenal medulla, DCLHb was administered to bilateral adrenal demedullated rats. DCLHb was found to produce a pressor effect in bilateral adrenal demedullated rats (42.0 +/- 6.4 mm Hg) that was similar to normal rats. To determine whether DCLHb alters the responsiveness of peripheral vascular adrenoceptors, the effect of DCLHb pretreatment on the blood pressure and heart rate responses of adrenergic agonists was studied. DCLHb significantly potentiated (66.7%) the pressor response to norepinephrine (0.5 to 2.0 microgram/kg, intravenously) but did not affect the heart rate response to norepinephrine. Phenoxybenzamine completely blocked the DCLHb-induced potentiation of the norepinephrine responses. Phenylephrine produced a dose dependent (5 to 20 micrograms/kg, intravenously) pressor and reflex bradycardic effect. DCLHb significantly potentiated the pressor (40.6%) and bradycardiac (-22.8%) effect of phenylephrine, which were completely blocked by prazosin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "112": "The purpose of this study were to determine the specificity of the head-up tilt test in normal subjects when a graded isoproterenol infusion is used, and to evaluate the role of dynamic ventricular volume change during head-up tilt as a mechanism of syncope. We prospectively studied 12 normal volunteers, each of whom underwent an upright tilt test for 10 minutes at 80 degrees with and without an infusion of isoproterenol. A subgroup of five subjects had a third tilt test during administration of a combination of esmolol and isoproterenol. Blood pressure, heart rate, and left ventricular volumes and flow (obtained with Doppler echocardiography) were recorded in the following sequence: while supine, during upright tilt, while supine with isoproterenol, and during upright tilt with isoproterenol. During the initial head-up tilt, one subject had syncope. An additional eight subjects had presyncope or syncope during head-up tilt with isoproterenol. The remaining three subjects were asymptomatic. In subjects with syncope or near-syncope (\"responders\"), heart rate increased with isoproterenol but decreased markedly, to 76 +/- 5 beats/min, by the end of the protocol. Systolic blood pressure rose slightly above baseline during isoproterenol but fell from 118 +/- 4 to 85 +/- 5 mm Hg during head-up tilt with isoproterenol. The three asymptomatic subjects had only one significant change, an increase in heart rate with isoproterenol. In the five responders undergoing three tilt tests, left ventricular volume decreased significantly at end diastole (94 +/- 25 vs 58 +/- 22 ml) and end systole (34 +/- 13 vs 18 +/- 6 ml) when supine baseline is compared with initial upright tilt.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "113": "The effect of chronic beta-adrenoreceptor blockade (beta-blockade) on hemodynamics and oxygen consumption (VO2) during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in mild hypothermia (34 degrees C) was studied in 34 patients. The study group included 17 patients who received beta-adrenergic blocking drugs for at least 1 mo prior to the study. Seventeen patients who did not receive beta-adrenergic blockers served as controls. Demographic data in the two groups were comparable. Prior to induction of anesthesia, the heart rate was slower in the beta-adrenergic blocker group as compared to the control group. During CPB, measurements were made at two pump flow rates: 2.4 L.min-1.m-2 and 3.0 L.min-1.m-2. Oxygen delivery was similar in the two groups (beta-adrenergic blocker vs control) but the oxygen consumption was significantly lower in the beta-adrenergic blocker group as compared to the control group at both flow rates (P = 0.009). Increasing the flow rate from 2.4 L.min-1.m-2 to 3.0 L.min-1.m-2 produced a similar increase (P = 0.0001) in oxygen consumption in both groups. Increasing flow rate increased mean arterial pressure (MAP) and central venous pressure (CVP) and decreased systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) and reservoir volume similarly in both groups. Thus, compared to the control group, patients on chronic beta-adrenergic blocker medication have a lower VO2 during CPB.",

    "121": "The introduction of new drugs, and a re-evaluation of older drugs, have radically changed the pharmacological management of heart failure. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, digitalis, diuretics and the combination of nitrates and hydralazine are now used. The first Cooperative North Scandinavian Enalapril Survival Study (CONSENSUS I) and the second Vasodilator therapy in Heart Failure Trial (V-HeFT II) have demonstrated that patients with severe or advanced heart failure should be treated with ACE inhibitors, digitalis and diuretics (other vasodilators can be used if ACE inhibitors are contraindicated) to improve symptoms and duration of life. The Studies Of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) and the Munich Heart Failure trial have shown that patients with mild heart failure should be treated with ACE inhibitors. However, data from several large clinical registries suggest that only 40% of patients with heart failure are being given ACE inhibitors perhaps through fear of serious renal damage or hypotension; these fears are unfounded. Patients with anterior myocardial infarcts and reduced left ventricular function also benefit from ACE inhibitors. The fourth International Study of Infarct Survival (ISIS 4) and results from the Gruppo Italiano per Io Studio della Sopravvivenza nell'Infarto miocardico 3 (GISSI 3) have indicated that patients with acute myocardial infarction benefit from early ACE inhibitor therapy and that survival is increased.

    "124": "The binding of radioligand to cell membrane prepared from mouse myometrium was used to identify the characteristics of beta-adrenoceptors. Uteri were taken from mature mice (Kunming Strain) weighing 40 +/- 5 g pretreated with estradiol benzoate 1 mg.kg-1.d-1 ip for 2 d. The binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA) to uterine membrane was saturable, having a Bmax of 378 fmol/mg protein and a KD of 3.1 nmol.L-1. The slope of Hill plot (nH = 1.03) indicated the absence of cooperative interactions. IC50 and K1 values of l-norepinephrine (NE), dl-propranol (Pro), d-timolol (d-Tim), and l-Tim competed for the [3H]DHA binding sites were 171 +/- 10, 10.3 +/- 4.3, 6.5 +/- 2.1, 0.40 +/- 0.23 nmol.L-1 and 113 +/- 6, 6.3 +/- 2.8, 4.0 +/- 1.3, 0.25 +/- 0.14 nmol.L-1, respectively.

The model was induced by intracoronary administration of saponin, volume loading and intravenous infusion of methoxamine. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) increased from 7.9 +/- 0.6 to 24.2 +/- 1.4 mmHg, and aortic blood flow (AoF) decreased from 0.89 +/- 0.06 to 0.53 +/- 0.04 l/min. Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) increased from 9618 +/- 585 to 16492 +/- 1213 dynes.sec/cm5 and right atrial pressure (RAP) increased from 2.5 +/- 0.2 to 4.2 +/- 0.4 mmHg. Furthermore, Vmax decreased from 71.6 +/- 5.1 to 45.8 +/- 2.9 1/sec, and the time constant of left ventricular pressure decay (T) increased from 40.0 +/- 2.6 to 90.2 +/- 7.9 msec. These hemodynamic changes were stable for up to 80 min. Dobutamine improved cardiac function by increasing Vmax and by decreasing T. Consequently, dobutamine increased AoF and decreased LVEDP, while there was no change in SVR. Nitroglycerin reduced LVEDP, SVR and T; increased AoF; and did not change Vmax. Propranolol produced no improvement in the hemodynamics or cardiac function. These results indicate that the present congestive heart failure model is characterized by global left ventricular dysfunction with lowered cardiac output and increased peripheral vascular tone, and it is beneficial for evaluating the pharmacological properties of drugs for acute congestive heart failure.",

The increase in the transferase activity after ischemia/reperfusion was depressed by SG-75 but not by SG-86. Furthermore, only SG-75 significantly inhibited lipid peroxidation and the activation of microsomal GSH S-transferase induced by hydrogen peroxide treatment of liver microsomes. These data indicate that SG-75 has an antioxidative action and the nitro group of SG-75 may play a critical role for this action.", 
    "128": "The effects of kindling and inverse benzodiazepine receptor agonist beta-carbolines on animal models of anxiety are briefly reviewed in relation to affective disorder associated with chemical exposure. Recent experimental results are described. In the present study, cats were given the inverse benzodiazepine receptor agonist, FG-7142, a powerful anxiogenic compound in humans and animals. Neural transmission in pathways involved in defensive behavior in the cat was monitored using evoked potential techniques. Change in these pathways was related to behavioral changes induced by the drug. It was found that a single dose of FG-7142 lastingly increased defensive response to rodents for at least 40 days after drug administration. Behavioral change was specific to defensive response, since approach-attack behavior remained unchanged, replicating previous studies. The benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, Flumazenil, reversed the increase in defensiveness in a drug-dependent manner, replicating previous findings. Increased defensiveness was paralleled by a delayed onset potentiation of neural transmission between the amygdala and the medial hypothalamus of the left hemisphere. Potentiation in the left hemisphere was transient, decaying between 6 and 12 days after the drug. There was a longer lasting potentiation (LTP) of activity evoked in the left and right amygdalo-periacqueductal gray pathways and in the right amygdalo-medial hypothalamic pathway. Potentiation in these pathways appeared at the time of behavioral change. Potentiation of the right amygdalo-periacqueductal gray and right amygdalo-medial hypothalamic pathways persisted until the end of the experiment. In contrast, potentiation of the left amygdalo-periacqueductal gray pathway faded by 40 days after the drug. Flumazenil decreased potentiation ony in the right amygdalo-periacqueductal gray pathway. These data strongly suggest that lasting affective change is mediated by lasting changes in particular efferents of the amygdala of the right hemisphere. Behavioral and physiological effects of FG-7142 were blocked by the N-methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor blocker, AP7. The data suggest that failure of neural inhibition induced by FG-7142 engages NMDA receptor processes to produce lasting potentiation of transmission in neural circuits that mediate defensive response with behavioral consequences. Since FG-7142 interferes with GABA mediated neural inhibition and is proconvulsant, its action might mimic the action of other environmental chemicals with similar properties, such as chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticides. The relationship of the present data to the literature on the neural and behavioral effects of insecticide exposure is discussed. The significance of these findings for multiple chemical sensitivity disorder is also briefly discussed.", 
    "129": "A retrospective analysis without exclusion of 369 consecutive cases of myocardial infarction admitted between January 1988 and March 1992 studied the risk factors, previous medical history and treatment in this period during which medical practice seemed to be standardised with acknowledged benefits of thrombolysis, beta-blockade and aspirin therapy. The population observed is divided in three age groups (< 65, > 65 < 75 and > 75). A Cox model multivariate analysis for age, sex, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, tobacco smoking, previous infarction, coronary artery disease and cardiac failure underlined the risk related to age which was 3.2 for patients 65-75 years of age and 4 for patients over 75 years of age. The risk was high in women (1.4), diabetes (1.5) and previous infarction (1.7). The excess mortality of the elderly age groups could also have been related to medical management as the most effective treatments were less commonly used. Thrombolysis was used in 44% of patients under 65 years of age but in only 9.7% of patients over 75 years; betablockers were prescribed in 77.6% of the younger but only in 27.4% of the older patients. The same tendency was observed in the administration of aspirin, with 81.6% receiving this drug in the younger patients compared to only 61% in older patients. Differences in survival at 6 months according to age (93.6%, 74% and 54.9%) show that there is a clearly defined therapeutic objective over 65 years of age with a large field of action and a probability of significant improvement in mortality and morbidity.",

The mid-left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded for 2, 10 and 2 min in four pigs, and for 2, 2, 5, 10 and 2 min in four other pigs. All the ischaemic periods were separated by 30 min of reperfusion and the biopsies were obtained 60 min after the last ischaemic period. Segment length function was measured in the ischaemic region and in the control region supplied by the left circumflex artery. In the two groups, the percentage systolic shortening was reduced equally, to 59 +/- 9 and 58 +/- 10% of control in the region subjected to ischaemia and only minimally in the control region. The biopsies from the stunned region from both groups showed: (1) no change in either the affinity for carbachol or the number of binding sites of the muscarinic receptors; (2) no alterations in messenger RNA encoding for the alpha subunit-2 of the inhibitory guanine nucleotide binding protein, as demonstrated by northern blot and solution hybridization; (3) no change in membrane-bound inhibitory guanine nucleotide binding protein, as shown by enzyme immunoassay utilizing a specific anti-peptide antibody, and (4) unchanged inhibition of stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity. These results suggest that there is an intact inhibitory guanine nucleotide binding protein-mediated muscarinic receptor adenylyl cyclase system in the stunned porcine myocardium.", 
    "131": "Many inflammatory mediators trigger the adhesion of leukocytes to the vascular endothelium. We sought to determine whether the beta 2-adrenergic receptor agonist formoterol can inhibit the adhesion of neutrophils and eosinophils to the endothelium of venules in the rat airway mucosa. We also tested whether this action is mediated by beta 2-adrenergic receptors. Inflammation was induced in the airways of anesthetized pathogen-free F344 rats by injecting substance P (5 micrograms/kg) or bradykinin (10 mg/kg) intravenously. The rats were perfused with fixative 5 min later, and the tracheas were removed. Adherent intravascular neutrophils and eosinophils, stained by a histochemical reaction for myeloperoxidase, were counted in tracheal whole mounts. We found that, after the injection of substance P, formoterol (0.1, 1.0, or 10.0 micrograms/kg i.v.) reduced the number of adherent neutrophils by 8, 59, or 56% and reduced the number of eosinophils by 59, 90, or 86%, respectively. The three doses of formoterol reduced the amount of substance P-induced extravasation of Monastral blue by 21, 66, or 80%, respectively. Both effects of formoterol were blocked by the beta 2-adrenergic receptor antagonist ICI-118,551, which by itself produced neither leukocyte adhesion nor plasma extravasation. After the injection of bradykinin, the three doses of formoterol reduced the number of adherent neutrophils by 28, 67, or 62% and reduced the number of eosinophils by 17, 38, or 57%, respectively. We conclude that formoterol, acting via beta 2-adrenergic receptors, not only can reduce the amount of plasma leakage but also can reduce the number of neutrophils and eosinophils that adhere to the vascular endothelium at sites of inflammation.", 
    "132": "Fixed-dose combination antihypertensive therapy has been available for over 25 years. During that time, considerable progress has been made in the development of physiologically appropriate combinations. The inherent advantage of fixed-dose combination therapy resides in its improving compliance because fewer pills are required. Alternatively, fixed-dose combination therapy limits dosage flexibility and dose titration of a single component of the combination to complement ongoing treatment of a concomitant non-hypertensive illness. The most frequently employed fixed-dose combinations include some form of a thiazide diuretic together with either a potassium-sparing diuretic, beta-blocker or an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. Newer combinations using a calcium channel blocker and beta-blocker, or a calcium channel blocker and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor are either in development or soon to be available. Such developments, if combined with appropriate cost reductions will ultimately increase the popularity of these combination drug administration strategies.",

Thrombotic occlusion was provoked by a copper-coil technique. We measured intracardiac pressures and their derivatives by catheter-tip micromanometers, cardiac output (CO) by thermodilution method, regional myocardial blood flow (RMBF) by radioactive microspheres technique, global and regional left ventricular (LV) function by ventriculography, and IS with triphenyltetrazolium at the end of the experiment.

AII (0.01-10 nmol/kg intravenously, i.v.) induced a dose-dependent increase in diastolic blood pressure (DBP), the rate of increase in left ventricular pressure (LVdP/dtmax), cardiac output (CO), and total peripheral resistance (TPR) without changing LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) or heart rate (HR). Losartan 3 and 10 mg/kg i.v. caused dose-dependent parallel rightward shifts of the dose-response curves (DBP and LVdP/dtmax) without altering the maximal responses to AII. PD123177 (100 mg/kg i.v.) did not influence the dose-response curves for AII significantly.

Although these two compounds (BIBS 39 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg and BIBS 222 1 and 3 mg/kg) did not alter the maximal increase in DBP to angiotensin AII, they decreased the maximal increase in LVdP/dtmax by approximately 35%.

Here, we report that 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 beta-pregnan-20-one sulfate (5 beta 3 alpha S), a sulfated form of naturally occurring 5 beta 3 alpha, inhibits both the NMDA and the non-NMDA receptor-mediated responses as measured by whole cell voltage clamp recordings. 100 microM 5 beta 3 alpha S rapidly and reversibly inhibits the response to 30 microM NMDA by 66%, 50 microM kainate by 37%, and 25 microM AMPA by 29%. Application of 50 microM nonsulfated 5 beta 3 alpha does not produce any significant effect on the NMDA response, demonstrating that the sulfate moiety is important for the effect of 5 beta 3 alpha S on the NMDA response. The effect of 5 beta 3 alpha S on the NMDA response is concentration dependent, with an EC50 of 62 microM. 5 beta 3 alpha S reduces the maximum NMDA response with little effect on the NMDA EC50, indicating that antagonism of the NMDA response by 5 beta 3 alpha S is noncompetitive. The fact that 5 beta 3 alpha S inhibition of the NMDA response is neither agonist nor voltage dependent demonstrates that 5 beta 3 alpha S does not act as an open channel blocker. Furthermore, inhibition of the NMDA response by 5 beta 3 alpha S is not reduced by the addition of a maximal concentration (10 microM) of glycine, indicating that 5 beta 3 alpha S does not act via the glycine recognition site. The inhibitory action of 5 beta 3 alpha S on the NMDA and non-NMDA receptors may provide a basis for inhibiting glutamate receptor-induced seizures and excitotoxic cell death.", 
    "136": "A diversity of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subtypes has been identified in mammalian brain using recombinant DNA technology. Alterations in the activity of these acetylcholinegated ion channels have been implicated in a number of central nervous system disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD). The potential therapeutic usefulness of (-)-nicotine [(S)-3-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl) pyridine], the prototypic agonist at nAChRs, is severely limited by side effects that are the result of activation of both cholinergic and noncholinergic pathways in the central and peripheral nervous systems. This study sought to determine the in vitro selectivity of (S)-3-methyl-5-(1methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)isoxazole (ABT 418), a novel analog of (-)-nicotine in which the pyridine ring was replaced with an isoxazole bioisotere, to activate nAChRs. ABT 418 was a potent inhibitor of [3H]-cytisine binding to nAChR in rat brain (Ki = 3 nM) but was inactive (Ki > 10,000 nM) in 37 other receptor/neurotransmitter-uptake/enzyme/transduction system binding assays, including those for alpha-bungarotoxin, muscarinic and 5-hydroxytryptamine3 receptors. In PC12 cells, patch-clamp studies indicated that ABT 418 was an agonist with an EC50 value of 209 microM, a potency to activate cholinergic channel currents some 4-fold less than that of (-)-nicotine (52 microM). Channel current responses elicited by ABT 418 were prevented by the cholinergic channel blocker, mecamylamine. ABT 418 was also approximately 10-fold less potent (EC50 value = 380 nM) than (-)-nicotine (40 nM) in increasing [3H]-dopamine release from rat striatal slices, an effect that was blocked by the nAChR antagonist, dihydro-beta-erythroidine (10 microM).2+ In contrast, ABT 418 appeared equipotent with (-)-nicotine in enhancing 86Rb+ flux from mouse thalamic synaptosomes. ABT 418 demonstrated an in vitro pharmacological profile of cholinergic channel activation that was robust at some nAChR, but not others. The reasons for this are unclear. However, a nAChR subtype selectivity may account for the in vitro potency differences of ABT 418 on various neurotransmitter systems, and the substantial separation between the cognitive enhancement/anxiolytic benefits, and the reduced central nervous system side-effect liabilities seen in vivo. ABT 418 represents the first neuronal nAChR ligand that differentiates the toxicities/liabilities and other negative aspects normally associated with liabilities and other negative aspects normally associated with (-)-nicotine from the potential pharmacological benefits of selective cholinergic channel activation.", 
    "137": "In rat hepatocytes, beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR)-mediated cAMP generation was found to be higher in the female than in the male. As compared to the male, the number of beta-AR, detected by [125I]iodocyanopindolol, was elevated in the female. In agonist competition experiments, the proportion of beta-AR in the high-affinity state was promoted in the female than in the male. The alpha subunit of the stimulatory G protein (Gs alpha) was quantified using ADP-ribosylation catalyzed by cholera toxin. The amount of Gs alpha, both small, 42 kDa (Gs alpha S), and large, 47 kDa (Gs alpha L), forms increased in parallel with enhancement of catecholamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase activity in the female. The female showed a disproportionate increase in Gs alpha L, which is preferentially coupled to beta-AR, compared with Gs alpha S. In addition, 17 beta-estradiol facilitated isoproterenol-induced cAMP generation in both male and female rats, whereas castration or testosterone had no effect on this response. It is proposed that the cellular sites for sexual dimorphism in hepatic beta-adrenergic functions are the coupling state of beta-AR to Gs and the amount of Gs alpha as well as the level of beta-AR.", 
    "138": "Induction of DNA synthesis and plasma membrane desialylation in the early prereplicative period in isoproterenol-stimulated mouse parotid glands seem to occur in a close relationship. beta 1, beta 2 or both subtypes of adrenergic receptors could be involved in those responses. To discriminate between those alternatives, dose-dependency studies were addressed to assess the abilities of the selective beta-adrenergic agonists dobutamine (beta 1) and salbutamol (beta 2) to induce plasma membrane desialylation and DNA synthesis. Likewise, the abilities of the selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists atenolol (beta 1) and ICI 118,551 (beta 2) to interfere with the induction of both responses were also studied. Dobutamine was found to be at least 10-fold more potent than salbutamol in inducing DNA synthesis whereas ICI 118,551 was much weaker than atenolol, as inhibitor of the agonist-induced DNA synthesis. On the other hand, dobutamine was also more potent than salbutamol in provoking plasma membrane desialylation. However, whenever an increase in the rate of DNA synthesis was induced by either agonist, a constant 50% reduction in the levels of sialic acid in the plasma membranes was observed. In the same direction, atenolol, at variance to ICI 118,551, was able to produce a full suppression of the plasma membrane desialylation induced by either selective agonist. Taken together, these results suggest that in mouse parotid glands, both DNA synthesis and plasma membrane desialylation during the early prereplicative period are induced preferentially via adrenergic receptors of the beta 1-subtype.", 
    "139": "This study compared the effects of repeated novel stressors on 'depressive behaviors', defined by the forced-swim and open-field tests, in Sprague-Dawley (S-D) and Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats. Since stress appears to alter brain norepinephrine (NE) activity, this study also investigated the effects of the stressors on beta-adrenoceptors (beta-ARs), alpha 2-adrenoceptors (alpha 2-ARs) and NE transporter (NET) sites in S-D and WKY rats. Stress did not alter 125I-iodopindolol (125I-PIN) binding to beta-ARs, nor [3H]idazoxan ([3H]IDAZ) binding to alpha 2-ARs in S-D rats, compared to non-stressed controls. However, WKY-stressed rats showed a significant reduction in 125I-IPIN binding to beta-ARs in the cortex, hippocampus, amygdala and hypothalamus, and a reduction in [3H]IDAZ binding to alpha 2-ARs in the amygdala. [3H]nisoxetine ([3H]NIS) binding to NET sites in WKY-stressed rats was also reduced in the cortex, hippocampus and amygdala. When both strains were compared, the most surprising finding was a significantly higher density of NET sites in the hippocampus and amygdala in WKY rats compared to S-D rats. The results of this study indicate that stress, not only exacerbates depressive behavior in WKY rats, but also selectively alters beta-ARs, alpha 2-ARs and NET sites in limbic brain regions. Thus, the WKY strain may serve as a useful animal model for depressive behavior and for the investigation of novel antidepressant drugs.", 
    "140": "Knowledge of the effects of nerve growth factor (NGF) on glia is limited. A CNS site where NGF-glial interactions may occur is the retina. NGF is endogenous to the retina, and the retinal M\u00fcller glial cells have NGF receptors. Here, we examined the possibility that NGF may be a mitogen for M\u00fcller glial cells, which often proliferate in response to pathophysiological conditions. Experiments were performed on cultured glial cells from the adult human retina. Exposure of cultured M\u00fcller glial cells to 2.5 S NGF under serum-free conditions resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in cell number and bromodeoxyuridine incorporation into nuclei. The half-maximally effective concentration was 0.04 ng/ml (1.5 pM), consistent with activation of high affinity NGF receptors. K252a, a blocker of the neurotrophin family of tyrosine kinase-linked receptors, potently inhibited the proliferative effect of NGF. Transforming growth factor beta-2, another growth factor endogenous to the retina, inhibited the mitogenic response to NGF. These findings indicate that human M\u00fcller glial cells in culture express functional NGF receptors and that the response of M\u00fcller cells to NGF can be modulated by other growth factors.", 
    "141": "A stepwise increase in extracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]o) can evoke insulin release from pancreatic islets in the absence of secretagogues. We have investigated the ionic mechanism underlying this secretory response by recording intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) from single mouse islets of Langerhans using ratiometric fura-2 microfluorometry. In the presence of 11 mM glucose, the [Ca2+]i undergoes fast oscillations associated with bursting electrical activity. Nifedipine (10 microM) suppressed these oscillations and markedly lowered the [Ca2+]i. Raising the [Ca2+]o from 2.56 to 12.8 mM in the continued presence of 11 mM glucose and nifedipine evoked pronounced [Ca2+]i rises of variable amplitude and time course. This effect was dose-dependent (EC50 = 3.6 mM) and remained essentially unchanged in the absence of glucose or in the presence of 3 mM glucose and nifedipine, conditions where beta-cells are hyperpolarized by approximately -25 mV. Depleting the acetylcholine-mobilizable internal Ca2+ pools by repetitively challenging the islets with acetylcholine in the absence of Ca2+ actually potentiated the standard high Ca2+ responses. The latter were strongly reduced by millimolar concentrations of Ni2+ (70% reduction at 3 mM) and by diphenylamine-2-carboxylate (DPC; IC50 = 145 microM), a blocker of nonselective cation channels. The standard high Ca2+ responses were relatively insensitive to the glycolytic inhibitor mannoheptulose. It is proposed that the high Ca(2+)-evoked [Ca2+]i responses are primarily accounted for by Ca2+ influx through dihydropyridine- and voltage-insensitive, nonselective cation channels. These channels do not appear to be under the control of glucose metabolism. Although their function is unknown, they may be essential to supplying the beta-cells with Ca2+ in the absence of stimulatory levels of fuel secretagogues.", 
    "142": "Simultaneous elevation of thyreostimulin and thyroid hormones values, when associated with clinical hyperthyroidism, raises a dual problem of diagnosis and treatment. We report a case of hyperthyroidism with elevated thyreostimulin in a young adult man. The values of free triiodothyronin and free thyroxin were elevated and the thyroxin binding globulin was normal. A normal pituitary tomodensitometry, the normal values of the alpha sub-unit of thyreostimulin and the dynamic tests of thyreostimulin secretion allowed us to rule out the hypothesis of a pituitary adenoma. Non-tumoral inappropriate secretions of thyreostimulin are at present regarded as syndromes of resistance to thyroid hormones. Their biological translation is a simultaneous elevation of thyreostimulin and thyroid hormones. Peripheral resistance, which is rarely complete, finds its expression in clinical hyperthyroidism or in normal clinical condition, whereas pituitary resistance, which causes the lack of feedback on the secretion of thyreostimulin expresses itself by clinical hyperthyroidism, sometimes with goitre owing to the trophic action of thyreostimulin on the thyroid. Generalized syndromes of resistance are the most common. Our patient had a selective pituitary resistance to thyroid hormones and less than thirty cases are reported in the literature. Treatment with a beta-blocker remains indicated when facing clinical evidence for hyperthyroidism and oral triiodothyronin seems to be able to slow down the inappropriate secretion of thyreostimulin. Regarding our patient who experienced a clinical and biological relapse after the stopping of the treatment, we join many authors who recommend a prolonged treatment."
