It is widely accepted that CYP2D6 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum of cells; however, we have identified this enzyme in the mitochondria of human liver samples and found that extensive inter-individual variability exists with respect to the level of the mitochondrial enzyme. Metabolic assays using 7-methoxy-4-aminomethylcoumarin as a substrate show that the human liver mitochondrial enzyme is capable of oxidizing this substrate and that the catalytic activity is supported by mitochondrial electron transfer proteins. In the present study, we show that CYP2D6 contains an N-terminal chimeric signal that mediates its bimodal targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. In vitro mitochondrial import studies using both N-terminal deletions and point mutations suggest that the mitochondrial targeting signal is localized between residues 23-33 and that the positively-charged residues at positions 24, 25, 26, 28 and 32 are required for mitochondrial targeting. The importance of the positively-charged residues was confirmed by transient transfection of a CYP2D6 mitochondrial targeting signal mutant in COS-7 cells. Both the mitochondria and the microsomes from a CYP2D6 stable expression cell line contain the enzyme and both fractions exhibit bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation activity, which is completely inhibited by CYP2D6 inhibitory antibody. Overall, these results suggest that the targeting of CYP2D6 to mitochondria could be an important physiological process that has significance in xenobiotic metabolism.",

The proliferation and involution of hemangiomas are controlled by complex interactions of molecular, cellular, and hormonal regulators.

Various modalities, including local and systemic pharmacologic agents, lasers, surgery and embolization, are employed to halt growth and to induce regression. This article will review the rapidly evolving field of pharmacologic treatment of infantile hemangiomas.", 
    "6": "Amorphous solids and crystalline salts are both of interest as a means of improving the dissolution characteristics and apparent solubility of poorly water soluble active pharmaceutical ingredients which have low bioavailability in humans. The theory and selection of both crystalline drug substance salt forms and amorphous products have been extensively studied. However, less is known about the impact of different counterions on the properties of amorphous drug substance salts. In this study, several salts of either nicardipine or propranolol were prepared and characterized with respect to glass transition temperature, crystallization tendency and moisture sorption behavior. Although the moisture sorption behavior and crystallization tendency varied depending on the counterion used, no trends were readily apparent. The glass transition temperature was found to be dependent on the counterion used to form the salt, and was higher in all instances for the salts than for the neutral compound. Several molecular descriptors were calculated for the various counterions, and multivariate analysis was used to build a model that successfully correlated Tg with a number of these parameters. Important parameters which influenced Tg included counterion pKa and electrophilicity index. In conclusion, it is apparent that, as for crystalline salts, the counterion has an effect on the properties of amorphous materials.", 
    "7": "The purpose of this study was to develop simulation and modeling methods for the evaluation of pharmacokinetics when intestinal influx and efflux transporters are involved in gastrointestinal absorption. The advanced compartmental absorption and transit (ACAT) model as part of the computer program GastroPlus was used to simulate the absorption and pharmacokinetics of valacyclovir, gabapentin, and talinolol. Each of these drugs is a substrate for an influx or efflux transporter and all show nonlinear dose dependence within the normal therapeutic range. These simulations incorporated the experimentally derived gastrointestinal distributions of transporter expression levels for oligopeptide transporters PepT1 and HPT1 (valacyclovir); System L-amino acid transporter LAT2 and organic cation transporter OCTN1 (gabapentin); and organic anion transporter (OATP1A2) and P-glycoprotein (talinolol). By assuming a uniform distribution of oligopeptide transporter and by application of the in vitro K(m) value for valacyclovir, the simulations accurately reproduced the experimental nonlinear dose dependence. For gabapentin, LAT2 distribution produced simulation results that were much more accurate than OCTN1 distributions. For talinolol, an influx transporter distribution for OATP1A2 and the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein distributed with increasing expression in the distal small intestine produced the best results. The physiological characteristics of the small and large intestines used in the ACAT model were able to accurately account for the positional and temporal changes in concentration and carrier-mediated transport of the three drugs included in this study. The ACAT model reproduced the nonlinear dose dependence for each of these drugs.",

GastroPlus (Simulations Plus, Inc.) was used to fit mechanistic models for adinazolam and metoprolol that describe the absorption, PK, and PD after intravenous (i.v.) and immediate release (IR) oral (p.o.) administration. The fitted model for adinazolam was then used to predict the PD profile for a MR formulation and to design a new formulation with desired onset and duration of action. The fitted metoprolol model was used to gain insight and to explain the in vivo behaviors of MR formulations. For each drug, a single absorption/PK model was fitted that provided simulated plasma concentration-time profiles closely matching observed in vivo profiles across several different i.v. and p.o doses. Sedation score profiles of adinazolam were fitted with an indirect PD model. For metoprolol, the fitted absorption/PK model for IR p.o. doses was used to select in vitro dissolution conditions that best matched the in vivo release of MR doses. This model also explained differences in exposure after administration of MR formulations with different release rates. Mechanistic absorption/PK models allow for detailed descriptions of all processes affecting the two drugs' bioavailability, including release/dissolution, absorption, and intestinal and hepatic first pass extraction. The insights gained can be used to design formulations that more effectively overcome identified problems.",

In an experimental setting, TGF-beta blockade prevents the aortic root structural damage and dilatation. The angiotensin receptor 1 blockers (sartanics) exert an anti-TGF-beta effect; trials are now ongoing for evaluating the effect of losartan compared with atenolol in MFS. beta-Adrenergic blockers are the drugs most commonly used in MFS.

In our present study, we examined the comparative effects of raloxifene, tamoxifen, and native estrogen, estradiol on human osteoblast cell line, hFOB in vitro. Both the cell numbers and the ratio of the cells in S phase fraction were significantly increased by the treatment of raloxifene or tamoxifen as well as estradiol treatments in hFOB. Gene profile patterns following treatment with raloxifene, tamoxifen, and estradiol demonstrated similar patterns in a microarray/hierarchal clustering analysis. We also examined the expression levels of these genes detected by this analysis using quantitative RT-PCR. MAF gene was induced by raloxifene treatment alone. GAS6 gene was induced by raloxifene and tamoxifen as well as estradiol. An estrogen receptor blocker, ICI 18, 286, inhibited an increase of GAS6 gene expression but not the levels of MAF gene mRNA expression. Results of our present study demonstrated that raloxifene exerted direct protective effects on human osteoblasts in both estrogen receptor dependent and independent manners.",

    "27": "T-type Ca2+ channel-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) occurs predominantly during the critical period of ocular dominance plasticity in rat and cat visual cortex. Noradrenaline and serotonin are known to facilitate ocular dominance plasticity. In this study using rat visual cortical slices, we tested whether this LTP is modulated by these neuromodulators in the same way as ocular dominance plasticity. Extracellular field potentials evoked by layer 4 stimulation were recorded from layer 2/3 and LTP was induced by low-frequency (2 Hz) stimulation continued for 15 min. The induction of LTP was suppressed by beta, but not alpha, adrenergic receptor antagonists. LTP induction was also inhibited by selective antagonists for 5-HT(1A) or 5-HT(2) receptors. In slices prepared from rats in which noradrenaline or serotonin was depleted by selective neurotoxins, the magnitude of LTP was significantly smaller compared with control slices. These results indicate that the same types of adrenergic and serotonergic receptors facilitate both LTP and ocular dominance plasticity, supporting our hypothesis that T-type Ca2+ channel-dependent LTP mediates experience-dependent enhancement of visual responses of cortical neurons during the critical period.",

We sought to identify predictors of longer-term survival in patients with endomyocardial biopsy (EMB)-documented CA. Forty-five consecutive patients with EMB-documented CA were studied from January 1998 to December 2003. Age, gender, New York Heart Association class, medications, presence of light-chain amyloid, and electrocardiographic voltage were recorded. Baseline left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, deceleration time, diastolic function, LV mass, ventricular septal thickness, and myocardial performance index ([isovolumic contraction time + isovolumic relaxation time]/ejection time) were recorded. Mean age was 66 +/- 10 years with 34 men (76%).

Risk factors are advance maternal age (> 30), multiparity, twin pregnancy, african origin, obesity, pre-eclampsia, gestational hypertension, and prolonged tocolytic therapy. Treatment of acute phase is identical to usual treatment of acute systolic heart failure. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and VKA are contra indicated during pregnancy. After delivery, VKA treatment should be discussed in case of systolic function < 25 % because of higher risk of thrombus. Complete recovery of systolic function is observed in 50 % of the case. The mortality risk is low. Subsequent pregnancy should be discouraged, especially if systolic function did not recover.", 
    "40": "We compared the changes in blood flow of the masseter muscle (MBF), lower lip (LBF) and common carotid artery (CCABF) evoked by electrical stimulation of the lingual nerve (LN) in order to examine whether high cholinergic activity of parasympathetic vasodilatation in females is specific for the masseter muscle, and whether sex-associated differences in cholinergic parasympathetic vasodilatation affect the regulation of blood flow to the orofacial area from the CCABF in urethane-anaesthetized, vago-sympathectomized male and female rats. Increases in the MBF, LBF and CCABF evoked by LN stimulation appear to be mediated via an activation of parasympathetic reflex vasodilatation since these increases were profoundly reduced by pretreatment with the autonomic cholinergic ganglion blocker hexamethonium (10 mg/kg). Although alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (phentolamine and propranolol, 100 microg/kg) had no effect on the LN stimulation-induced blood flow increases in either sex, a marked difference was found between males and females in the effects of the antimuscarinic agent atropine (1-100 microg/kg) on these blood flow increases. Pretreatment with atropine slightly attenuated the increase in the MBF in males, but in females it markedly reduced the increases in all three sites measured, especially in the MBF. Our results suggest that (1) cholinergic activity of the parasympathetic vasodilatation in females is higher than that in males in most orofacial tissues, but particularly in the masseter muscle and (2) cholinergic parasympathetic vasodilatations are more involved in the regulation of blood flow to the orofacial area from the CCABF in females than in males.", 
    "41": "Ghrelin, a 28 aa growth-hormone-releasing peptide, has been shown to increase food intake and decrease arterial pressure in animals and in humans. Recently, a ghrelin antagonist (GhA), [d-Lys-3]-GHRP-6, was demonstrated to decrease food intake in mice, but its cardiovascular actions have not been described. In the present study, the effects of the GhA on cardiovascular parameters in conscious rats were investigated and the involvement of the sympathetic nervous system evaluated. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) measurements were assessed by radiotelemetry. GhA was administered in doses of 2, 4 and 6 mg/kg subcutaneously (s.c.). MAP as well as HR was dose-dependently elevated after sc application of GhA. Sympathetic blockade of alpha-adrenoreceptors with phentolamine (3 mg/kg, s.c.) and simultaneous antagonism of beta(1)-adrenoreceptors with atenolol (10 mg/kg, s.c.) abolished the increase in MAP and HR induced by GhA (4 mg/kg, s.c.). Administration of phentolamine alone inhibited the increase of MAP, but not HR; atenolol alone abolished the elevation of both MAP and HR evoked by GhA. These results suggest that the peripheral injection of ghrelin antagonist increases arterial pressure and heart rate, at least in part, through the activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Therefore, the use of the ghrelin antagonist system as a therapeutic target for reduction in food intake might lead to serious side effects like elevated blood pressure in humans mostly already having an elevated blood pressure as part of their metabolic syndrome.",

The present work described formulation and pharmacoscintigraphic evaluation of timolol-maleate-loaded chitosan/hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose (HPMC)-based polymer matrix for enhanced ocular retention. Chitosan and HPMC ratio was optimized and formulation was characterized for various in vitro parameters. The ocular retention was studied on New Zealand rabbits by gamma scintigraphy, which is a very simple and noninvasive technique. For scintigraphy study, the drug timolol maleate was radiolabeled (99m)Tc by direct labeling method using SnCl(2).2H(2)O as reducing agent. The labeling procedure was optimized to get maximum labeling efficiency (>98%). In vitro stability of the radiolabeled drug ((99m)Tc-timolol maleate complex) was checked and it was found to be stable for up to 24 h. Plain drug eliminates rapidly as significant activity was recorded in kidney and bladder after 2 h of ocular administration. It was evident from the scintigraphic images and the time-activity curve plotted from the data that the plain drug solution cleared very rapidly from the corneal region and reached into systemic circulation via nasolachrymal drainage system, as significant activity was recorded in kidney and bladder after 2 h of ocular administration. Developed formulation cleared at a slow rate and remained at corneal surface for longer time duration. No radioactivity was observed in systemic circulation after 2 h. Ocular irritation of the developed formulation was also checked by hen's egg chorioallantoic membrane test and formulation was found to be practically nonirritant. The study signified the potential of gamma scintigraphy in evaluation of novel drug delivery systems in a noninvasive manner.",

In contrast, modulation of the hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction differs between the two PAH models, likely due to the impact that different pathological pathways have on the physiology of the whole organism. Such differences between models of PAH should be considered in future studies.", 
    "47": "The effects of the monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) inhibitor clorgyline, the L-type calcium-channel blocker nicardipine, the syntaxin inhibitor botulinum toxin type C, and the potent thiol-oxidant phenylarsine oxide (PAO) on the selective tachykinin NK(2)-receptor agonist [beta-Ala(8)]-neurokinin A(4-10) [betaAla-NKA-(4-10)]-evoked 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) outflow from colonic enterochromaffin (EC) cells was investigated in vitro using isolated guinea-pig proximal colon. The betaAla-NKA-(4-10)-evoked outflow of 5-HT from clorgyline-treated colonic strips was markedly higher than that from clorgyline-untreated colonic strips. The betaAla-NKA-(4-10)-evoked 5-HT outflow from the clorgyline-treated colonic strips was sensitive to nicardipine or botulinum toxin type C. Moreover, PAO concentration-dependently suppressed the betaAla-NKA-(4-10)-evoked 5-HT outflow from the clorgyline-treated colonic strips. The suppressant action of PAO was reversed by the reducing agent dithiothrietol, but was not blocked by the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein. These results suggest that the tachykinin NK(2) receptor-triggered 5-HT release from guinea-pig colonic EC cells is mediated by syntaxin-related exocytosis mechanisms and that colonic mucosa MAO-A activity has the important function of modulating the tachykinin NK(2) receptor-triggered 5-HT release. It also appears that PAO-mediated sulfhydryl oxidation plays a role in modulating the tachykinin NK(2) receptor-triggered 5-HT release through a mechanism independent of inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatase activity.", 
    "48": "The importance of mitochondrial dysfunctions in the progression of chronic disease has been well established. Patients with chronic diseases are often prescribed a variety of medications, many of which have been shown to induce mitochondrial dysfunction. Exercise is a known stimulus for mitochondrial biogenesis and also recommended to patients as a lifestyle modification to supplement drug therapy. However, the potential interference of those drugs with mitochondrial adaptations to exercise has not been thoroughly investigated. This review provides a summary and discussion of known and potential interactions of commonly consumed drugs with exercise-induced mitochondrial adaptations.", 
    "49": "We recently reported that feeding Sprague Dawley rats a high-salt diet during pregnancy programmed an exaggerated pressor and tachycardic response to restraint in adult female offspring. In the present investigation, a pharmacologic approach was used to determine the contribution of the sympathoadrenal system to the exaggerated response. Injection of a cocktail containing a ganglionic blocker (chlorisondamine) and a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist (propranolol) prevented the stress-induced tachycardia and increase in blood pressure and abolished the difference between high-salt and normal-salt offspring. These data suggest that the prenatal high salt programmed a sympathoadrenal hyperresponsiveness to restraint stress.", 
    "50": "Novel C-seco-taxoids were synthesized from 10-deacetylbaccatin III and their potencies evaluated against drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cancer cell lines. The drug-resistant cell lines include ovarian cancer cell lines resistant to cisplatin, topotecan, adriamycin and paclitaxel overexpressing class III beta-tubulin, A2780TC1 and A2780TC3. The last two cell lines were selected through chronic exposure of A2780wt to paclitaxel and Pgp blocker cyclosporine. All novel C-seco-taxoids exhibited remarkable potency against A2780TC1 and A2780TC3 cell lines, and no cross resistance to cisplatin- and topotecan-resistant cell lines, A2780CIS and A2780TOP. Four of those C-seco-taxoids exhibit much higher activities than IDN5390 against paclitaxel-resistant cell lines, A2780ADR, A2780TC1 and A2780TC3. SB-CST-10202 possesses the best all-round high potencies across different drug-resistant cell lines. Molecular modeling studies, including molecular dynamics simulations, on the drug-protein complexes of class I and III beta-tubulins were performed to identify possible cause of the remarkable potency of these C-seco-taxoids against paclitaxel-resistant cell lines overexpressing class III beta-tubulin.", 
    "51": "Anthracycline-based antineoplastic therapy is the standard of care for various cancers today and represents a breakthrough in this area. The cardiac toxicity of anthracyclines is well established. The acute form is often reversible and has no predictive value for the future. This early form does not prevent continuation of chemotherapy. Late cardiac toxicity due to anthracycline is the leading limiting factor in its use. In adults, this resembles dilated cardiomyopathy, while in children it may be expressed as restrictive cardiomyopathy. The discovery of modifiable risk factors has made it possible to identify patients at high risk of developing late cardiac toxicity and heart failure. Because left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure may develop long after anthracycline treatment ends, prolonged close follow-up is mandatory in asymptomatic subjects. Follow-up of asymptomatic patients requires serial echocardiography (M-mode, 2D echo, Doppler, tissue Doppler, speckle tracking, etc.). Anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy must be treated according to the standard guidelines for chronic heart failure with left ventricular dysfunction, by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers. Lifestyle changes may reduce the long-term risk. Close collaboration between cardiologists and oncologists is highly desirable for optimizing management of these patients.", 
    "52": "Syncope is a common clinical problem characterized by transient, spontaneously self-terminating loss of consciousness with complete and prompt recovery; the cause is insufficiency of cerebral oxygen/nutrient supply most often due to a transient fall of systemic arterial pressure to levels below those tolerated by cerebrovascular autoregulation. Careful and thorough evaluation of the cause of syncope is warranted in all patients. Determining that certain individuals are at \"low mortality risk\" is inadequate; syncope, although often benign from a mortality perspective, tends to recur, is associated with risk of physical injury, diminishes quality-of-life, and might lead to restriction from employment or avocation. However, the diagnostic evaluation and treatment of syncope is challenging for many reasons. First, syncope is only 1 of many causes of transient loss of consciousness. Second, the patient's symptoms are fleeting, and the patient is generally fully recovered when seen in the clinic; only infrequently are there helpful physical findings. Third, spontaneous events are often unwitnessed by medical professionals; consequently, the medical history of symptom events is usually a \"second-hand\" or \"third-hand\" story. Finally, there is often an excessive sense of diagnostic \"urgency\" that tends to result in a rush to undertake multiple poorly considered \"diagnostic\" testing procedures; a deliberate approach based on initial risk stratification is more likely to reap the dual rewards of a correct diagnosis and initiation of effective treatment in a cost-effective manner.",

    "55": "Following vehicle, MDMA produced a slowly developing hyperthermia, reaching a maximum increase of 1.8 degrees C at 130 min post injection. A low concentration of SR59230A (0.5 mg x kg(-1)) produced a small but significant attenuation of the slowly developing hyperthermia to MDMA. A high concentration of SR59230A (5 mg x kg(-1)) revealed a significant and marked early hypothermic reaction to MDMA, an effect that was mimicked by the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin. Functional and ligand binding studies revealed actions of SR59230A at alpha(1)-adrenoceptors.", 
    "56": "1-(2-ethylphenoxy)-3-[[(1S)-1,2,3,4,-tetrahydro-1-naphthalenyl]amino]-(2S)-2-propanol hydrochloride in high concentrations modulates the hyperthermic actions of MDMA in mice in two ways: by blocking an early alpha(1)-adrenoceptor-mediated component to reveal a hypothermia, and by a small attenuation of the later hyperthermic component which may possibly be beta(3)-adrenoceptor-mediated (this seen with the low concentration of SR59230A). Hence, the major actions of SR59230A in modulating the actions of MDMA on temperature involve alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonism.", 
    "57": "We investigated the clinical response of chronic heart failure patients with beta(2)-adrenergic receptor Gln(27)-->Glu polymorphism treated for 6 months with carvedilol, a alpha/beta-antagonist with antioxidant properties. The 6-min. walk test, the left ventricular ejection fraction, heart rate, plasma norepinephrine and malondialdehyde, a stress oxidative marker, concentrations were evaluated at baseline and after treatment for 6 months with carvedilol in 33 stable chronic heart failure patients with the Gln(27)-->Glubeta(2)-adrenergic receptor polymorphism. Carvedilol significantly increased the left ventricular ejection fraction, while decreasing the heart rate and malondialdehyde plasma concentrations in chronic heart failure patients with the Glu(27)beta(2)-adrenergic receptor allele. There were however, no significant changes in patients with the Gln(27)beta(2)-adrenergic receptor variant.", 
    "58": "There is a great need for the identification of biomarkers for the early diagnosis of atherosclerosis and the agents to prevent its progression. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of 24 week of nebivolol (a third-generation vasodilatory beta-blocker) treatment on serum protein profiles in Apo E(-/-) mice during atherosclerosis progression. Nebivolol treated and non-treated (the control group) groups consisted of 10 genetically modified homozygous Apo E(-/-) mice. Proteomic analyses were performed using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS) in the serum samples from the nebivolol treated and non-treated Apo E(-/-) mice. The protein profiles obtained using three different chips, CM10 (weak cation-exchange), H50 (reverse phase), and IMAC30-Cu(2+) (immobilized metal affinity capture) were statistically analyzed using the ProteinChip data manager 3.0 program. At the end of 24 week of nebivolol-treatment period, a total of 662 protein/peptide clustering peaks were detected using 12 different conditions and reading with high and low intensity laser energy. The highest total number of protein/peptide clusters was found on H50 chip array. The peak intensities of 95 of the 662 protein/peptide clusters were significantly different in the nebivolol-treated atherosclerotic group in comparison to the non-treated control mice groups (P < 0.05). Forty-three protein/peptides were up-regulated (high signal intensity) while 52 protein/peptides had lower signal intensity (down-regulated) in the nebivolol-treated atherosclerotic group. The proteomic profiles of nebivolol-treated Apo E(-/-) mice were different than the control group indicating a potential role of nebivolol in atherosclerosis. Our study contributes to understand the efficacy of nebivolol on serum protein/peptide profiles during atherosclerosis development.", 
    "59": "We have found natural products exhibiting lipolysis-promoting activity in subcutaneous adipocytes, which are less sensitive to hormones than visceral adipocytes. The activities and a action mechanisms of a novel plant extract of Cirsium oligophyllum (CE) were investigated in isolated adipocytes from rat subcutaneous fat, and its fat-reducing effects by peroral administration and topical application were evaluated in vivo. CE-induced lipolysis was synergistically enhanced by caffeine, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, and was reduced by propranolol, a beta adrenergic antagonist. The peroral administration of 10% CE solution to Wistar rats for 32 days reduced body weight gain, subcutaneous, and visceral fat weights by 6.6, 26.2, and 3.0%, respectively, as compared to the control group. By the topical application of 2% of this extract to rats for 7 days, weight of subcutaneous fat in the treated skin was reduced by 23.2%. This fat mass reduction was accompanied by the up-regulation of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP), a principal thermogenic mitochondrial molecule related to energy dissipating, in subcutaneous fat and UCP3 in skin except for the fat layer. These results indicate that CE promotes lipolysis via a mechanism involving the beta adrenergic receptor, and affects the body fat mass. This fat reduction may be partially due to UCP up-regulation in the skin including subcutaneous fat. This is the first report showing that repeated lipolysis promotion through CE administration may be beneficial for the systematic suppression of body fat accumulation or the control of fat distribution in obesity.",

Neuropsychopharmacol. 18, 141-146.] have found that never-medicated depressed patients showed a significant sustained response with Paroxetine + Pindolol treatment. Also, patients with a first depressive episode displayed a trend for higher sustained response rates with Pindolol co-administration. Re-analysing the data of a previous clinical trial of Fluoxetine + Pindolol [P\u00e9rez, V., Gilaberte, I., Faries, D., Alvarez, E. and Artigas, F. (1997). Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of Pindolol in combination with Fluoxetine antidepressant treatment. Lancet 349, 1594-1597.], we have found that first depressive episodes are associated with a significant higher percentage of sustained responses when administering Fluoxetine + Pindolol (70.3%) compared to Fluoxetine + Placebo (44%). Moreover, based on a survival analysis, among the patients with a first depressive episode, those who received Fluoxetine + Pindolol achieved a sustained response significantly earlier (19 days) than those on Fluoxetine + Placebo (35 days). Interestingly, none of these effects were observed in the subsample of recurrent patients. The results suggest that Pindolol augmentation accelerates and enhances the action of SSRI at the beginning of the illness.", 
    "61": "A male newborn weighing 2334 g was delivered at 37 weeks of gestation by caesarean section because of prenatal ultrasound findings of fetal hydrops with atrioventricualr block, ventriucular tachycardia (VT), and impaired ventricular function. In spite of the intravenous administration of lidocaine, VT continued. He developed poor perfusion and systemic hypotension. After the intravenous administration of amiodarone, VT was terminated. The electrocardiogram revealed an extremely prolonged corrected QT interval (860 ms) with 2:1 atrioventricular block. Unfortunately, he died 18 h after birth in spite of the administration of lidocaine, beta-blocker and magnesium. Mutational analysis identified a novel heterozygous de novo mutation (F1486del) in SCN5A. This mutation is associated with the IFM motif in the linker between III and IV domains of Na(v)1.5, which serves as an inactivation particle binding within the pore of sodium channels. This report demonstrates an interesting relationship between the clinical phenotype and the location of the mutation in long QT syndrome.",

However, these recommendations are based on a few small studies, and there are no data available of a larger modern patient population undergoing pharmacological cardioversion of AFib. Therefore, we evaluated the safety of quinidine for cardioversion of paroxysmal AFib in patients after cardiac surgery and coronary intervention.",

There is still considerable debate concerning the protective effect of beta-blocker therapy towards perioperative coronary events, which will be outlined in this article. Two randomized, controlled trials suggest that coronary revascularization of cardiac-stable patients provides no benefits in the postoperative outcomes. In the current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for 'Perioperative Cardiovascular Evaluation and Care for Noncardiac Surgery', routine prophylactic coronary revascularization is not recommended in patients with stable coronary artery disease. However, a recent retrospective, observational study suggests that intermediate-risk patients may benefit from preoperative coronary revascularization.

Carvedilol was shown to be more efficacious than a traditional beta-blocker for treating heart failure and improving myocardial function. Carvedilol is the only agent in its class to have been demonstrated to significantly reduce mortality and morbidity in post-myocardial-infarction patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Moreover, carvedilol does not exhibit the carbohydrate and lipid disturbances observed with other beta-blockers. Originally available as a twice-daily formulation, a controlled-release, once-daily formulation of carvedilol is now available, which has equivalent efficacy and safety, as demonstrated by numerous studies. The convenience of once-daily dosing is expected to contribute to patient adherence, thereby potentially improving long-term clinical outcomes.", 
    "68": "The aim of the present study was to prepare mucoadhesive multiparticulate system for oral drug delivery using ionic gelation technique. Microspheres composed of various mucoadhesive polymers including HPMC of various grades like K4M, K15M, K100M, E50LV, Carbopol of grades 971P, 974P and polycarbophil were prepared. In this technique cross linking of sodium alginate with calcium chloride was done which retarded the release of drug from the mucoadhesive polymer. In the present work Metoprolol tararate was used as a model drug. Interaction studies performed using FTIR spectroscopy revealed that there was no drug to polymer interactions. The preliminary mucoadhesive strength studies performed for various polymers using rotating cylindrical method showed that HPMC had greater mucoadhesive properties than carbopol and polycarbophil. Microspheres so prepared were discrete, bulky, free flowing and showed an average encapsulation efficiency ranging from 50-60%. Particle size of the microspheres, as determined by the optical microscopy was found to be between 400-650 microm. The prepared formulations also exhibited a good mucoadhesive strength which was determined in in vitro conditions through falling film technique and was compared with ex vivo studies. The microspheres so prepared also exhibited a good swelling index which confirmed the strong mucoadhesive property of the formulation. Metoprolol release from the multiparticulate system was regulated and extended until 12 hours and exhibited a non fickian drug release kinetics approaching to zero order, as evident from the release rate exponent values which varied between 0.57 to 0.73. The stability studies performed on the optimized batches at 40 degrees C /75% RH for 90 days indicated no significant change in the physicochemical properties.",

It would therefore be premature and unwise to eliminate all beta-blockers from the array of agents available to optimize BP control in patients with uncomplicated hypertension by extrapolating data based almost entirely on the conventional beta-blocker atenolol. Vasodilating beta-blockers have beneficial effects on central BP, arterial stiffening, and nitric oxide-dependent endothelial dysfunction that may contribute to their clinical benefits in patients with hypertension.",

Unchanged oxygen saturation and increased blood flow would indicate increased oxygen delivery to the retina.", 
    "85": "The ability to remember contexts associated with aversive and rewarding experiences provides a clear adaptive advantage to animals foraging in the wild. The present experiments investigated whether hormonal signals released during feeding might enhance memory of recently experienced contextual information. Oleoylethanolamide (OEA) is an endogenous lipid mediator that is released when dietary fat enters the small intestine. OEA mediates fat-induced satiety by engaging type-alpha peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR-alpha) in the gut and recruiting local afferents of the vagus nerve. Here we show that post-training administration of OEA in rats improves retention in the inhibitory avoidance and Morris water maze tasks. These effects are blocked by infusions of lidocaine into the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) and by propranolol infused into the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA). These findings suggest that the memory-enhancing signal generated by OEA activates the brain via afferent autonomic fibers and stimulates noradrenergic transmission in the BLA. The actions of OEA are mimicked by PPAR-alpha agonists and abolished in mutant mice lacking PPAR-alpha. The results indicate that OEA, acting as a PPAR-alpha agonist, facilitates memory consolidation through noradrenergic activation of the BLA, a mechanism that is also critically involved in memory enhancement induced by emotional arousal.",

We should distinguish between three phases. Publication of a novel finding should raise the possibility that an intervention will work in situations other than those expected, and justify, as a second phase, the performance of rigorous, prospective, observational studies. If the results of these studies substantiate the claims for benefit, randomized controlled trials may be performed in the third phase.

Moreover, CoPP treatment led to a significant reduction of the psoriasiform histopathological changes and remarkable amelioration of the psoriasiform skin lesions, compared with PBS treatment, with a concomitant reduction in proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression. Additionally, CoPP treatment resulted in a decreased TNF-alpha and significantly increased IL-10 release. Our results suggest that HO-1 induction therapy ameliorates the psoriasiform skin lesions by suppressing keratinocyte hyperproliferation and attenuating production of inflammatory responses.", 
    "95": "An 85-year-old woman underwent transthoracic echocardiography for the investigation of breathlessness and atypical chest discomfort. Clinical examination was unremarkable. A standard 12 lead ECG demonstrated anterior T wave inversion, but was otherwise normal. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated a normally functioning left ventricle with hypertrophy and trabeculation of the apical and lateral segments. Imaging with colour flow Doppler demonstrated blood flow from the epicardial surface into the left ventricular cavity through the hypertrophied segment of myocardium during diastole. A diagnosis of multiple, diffuse coronary-left ventricular fistulae predominantly of a large diagonal branch of the left anterior descending artery was made at coronary angiography. The patient responded well to oral beta-blockade, reporting an improvement in symptoms 2 months later in the outpatient clinic. The echocardiographic appearances of coronary fistulae may cause diagnostic confusion, particularly in the presence of myocardial hypertrophy and trabeculation.", 
    "96": "Research has shown that enhancement of cannabinoid CB(1) receptor activity elicits an antidepressant-like response in the forced swim test (FST); however, the effects of chronic administration of cannabinoid agents in the FST are not well characterized. In Experiment 1, the CB(1) receptor agonist HU-210 (0.1 mg/kg) was administered for 10 days to male rats, following which animals were exposed to the FST. In Experiment 2, the same protocol was utilized; however, prior to the FST animals were co-treated with either prazosin (1 mg/kg; an alpha(1)-adrenoreceptor antagonist) or propranolol (2.5 mg/kg; a beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist). In Experiment 3, the same protocol was employed in both male and female rats, and the role of drug withdrawal was examined by administration of the CB(1) receptor antagonist AM251 (1 mg/kg) prior to the FST. Experiment 1 revealed that HU-210 administration evoked a reduction in immobility and increase in struggling that was identical to that produced by the antidepressant desipramine (10 mg/kg). Experiment 2 revealed that this effect was attenuated by both alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists, suggesting noradrenergic involvement in this antidepressant-like profile. Experiment 3 demonstrated that HU-210 administration produced an antidepressant response in both males and females, which was attenuated by the induction of precipitated withdrawal. These results show that protracted administration of a CB(1) receptor agonist produces an antidepressant-like response in the FST in both sexes, which appears to involve the noradrenergic system.",

    "98": "Nebivolol (Nomexor) is a third generation, vasodilating beta-blocker with a high beta(1)-adrenoceptor selectivity. Nebivolol acts as an agonist at the beta(3) adrenoceptor as well as the estrogen receptor thereby releasing nitric oxide in blood vessels via eNOS. Pleiotropic effects of nebivolol furthermore include a positive influence on cholesterol and triglycerides and a decrease in thrombocyte activity. Nebivolol is recommended in the guidelines of the European cardiac society (ESC) for patients with metabolic syndrome. Nebivolol's main properties in combination with its broad range of beneficial pleiotropic effects allow it to be clearly distinguished from other second and third generation beta-blockers.", 
    "99": "Present recommendations for perioperative ss-blockade are solely based on the findings of two randomized controlled trials of inadequate methodology and data analysis in just a little over 300 patients performed in the late 1990s. The PeriOperative ISchemic Evaluation study is the first adequately powered controlled randomized trial on the efficacy and safety of perioperative ss-blocker therapy. During the first 30 postoperative days, the primary endpoint (combined cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest) was significantly less in the ss-blocker compared to the placebo group, primarily due to a marked reduction in the incidence of non-fatal myocardial infarctions. However, in the ss-blocker group total mortality and the incidence of stroke were higher, negating the beneficial effect of perioperative ss-blocker therapy on the primary endpoint. A recently published meta-analysis confirmed in large parts these findings. Based on these publications, most of the present recommendations for perioperative ss-blocker therapy are no longer supported by evidence and respective revision is needed.", 
    "100": "We compared the effects of heart rate reduction (HRR) by the hyperpolarization-activated pacemaker current (I(f)) channel inhibitor ivabradine (MI+Iva) and the beta(1)-blocker atenolol (MI+Aten) on ventricular remodeling and perfusion after myocardial infarction (MI) in middle-aged (12 mo) Sprague-Dawley rats. Mean HRR was virtually identical in the two treated groups (19%). Four weeks after coronary artery ligation, maximal myocardial perfusion fell in the MI group but was preserved in infarcted rats treated with either Iva or Aten. However, coronary reserve in the remodeled hearts was preserved only with Iva, since Aten treatment elevated baseline perfusion in response to a higher wall stress. The higher maximal perfusion noted in the two treated groups was not due to arteriogenesis or angiogenesis. Plasma levels of angiotensin (ANG) II and myocardial ANG type 1 (AT(1)) receptor and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 were reduced during the first week of treatment by both Iva and Aten. Moreover, treatment also reduced arteriolar perivascular collagen density. Despite these similar effects of Iva and Aten on vascularity and ANG II, Iva, but not Aten, attenuated the decline in ejection fraction and lowered left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic volume (LVEDV)-to-LV mass ratio, determined by echocardiography. In conclusion, 1) Iva has advantages over Aten in postinfarction therapy that are not due to differential effects of the drugs on heart rate, and 2) age limits growth factor upregulation, angiogenesis, and arteriogenesis in the postinfarcted heart.",

This study examined cardiovascular, epinephrine (EPI), norepinephrine (NE), cortisol and clinical pain responses in 54 female patients with these disorders and 34 controls. In a subsample of 10 FMS, 10 TMD patients and 16 controls, using a counterbalanced, double-blind, crossover design, the same responses were assessed after intravenous administration of low dose propranolol vs placebo. Testing included baseline, postural, speech and ischemic pain stressors. FMS patients showed lesser heart rate (HR) increases to posture challenge but greater blood pressure (BP) increases to postural and speech tasks than controls, as well as higher overall BP and greater total vascular resistance (TVR) than TMDs or controls. TMDs showed higher overall cardiac output and lower TVR than controls. Both FMS and TMD groups showed lower baseline NE than controls, and TMDs showed lower overall EPI and NE levels. Group differences in HR, EPI and NE were abolished after propranolol although BP, CO and TVR differences persisted. In both FMS and TMD, the number of painful body sites and ratings of total clinical pain obtained 4 times during each session were significantly lower after beta-blockade vs placebo.",

    "108": "Landiolol hydrochloride, a new adrenergic beta(1)-selective antagonist having an ultra-short half-life, is used to prevent tachyarrhythmia during surgery. Since landiolol is thought to be rapidly hydrolyzed to an inactivate metabolite by esterases, quantification of the drug concentration in the blood is impractical. The landiolol concentration in blood was halved within 5 min after blood sampling. This degradation was effectively prevented by pre-treatment with neostigmine (100 microg) in the sampling tube, but not by EDTA pre-treatment, indicating that landiolol could be metabolized by pseudocholinesterase in plasma. After the one-step solid-phase extraction, fluorescence detection of landiolol reduced chromatographic background signals and then improved assay sensitivity to the lower limit of 10 ng/ml in blood; this reproducible approach yielded coefficient variation of less than 6%. The blood concentration-time profile of landiolol hydrochloride in patients of the present investigation afforded more practical assessment than previously reported studies, thus improving accuracy and facilitating detailed pharmacokinetic study in relation to the pharmacological action of drug.",

The different experimental parameters affecting the synchronous fluorescence of the studied drugs were carefully studied and optimized. The first derivative amplitude-concentration plots were rectilinear over the range of 0.10 to 1.00 microg/mL and 0.05-0.50 microg/mL with lower detection limits of 0.0149 and 7 x 10(-3) microg/mL and quantification limits of 0.045 and 0.021 microg/mL for LBT and FUR, respectively.

Studies have indicated that not only prolongation of the QT interval but also an increased short-term variability of QT interval (STV(QT)) is a marker for a decreased repolarization reserve in patients with drug-induced LQTS. The aims of this study were to determine if STV(QT) (1) is higher in patients with LQTS compared with controls, (2) if this effect is more pronounced in a high-risk LQTS population, and (3) could increase the diagnostic power of the surface electrocardiogram in identifying mutation carriers. Forty mutation carriers were compared with age- and gender-matched control subjects in the absence of beta-receptor-blocking agents. Lead II or V(5) RR and QT intervals from 30 consecutive beats were manually measured. STV(QT) was determined from Poincar\u00e9 plots of QT intervals (STV(QT) = Sigma|QTn + 1 - QTn|/[30 x radical2]). Compared with controls, patients with LQTS had a prolonged QTc interval (449 +/- 41 vs 411 +/- 32 ms, p = 0.00049) and increased STV(QT) (6.4 +/- 3.2 vs 4.1 +/- 1.6 ms, p = 0.005). In patients with the highest risk of clinical events, defined as a QTc interval >500 ms or symptoms before beta-blocker therapy, STV(QT) was 9 +/- 4 ms. QTc interval had a sensitivity of 43% and a specificity of 97% in identifying mutation carriers (thresholds 450 ms for men and 460 ms for women). Receiver operator characteristic analysis showed that an STV(QT) of 4.9 ms was the optimal cut-off value to predict mutation carriers. When incorporating an STV(QT) >4.9 ms for those whose QTc interval was within the normal limits, sensitivity to distinguish mutation carriers increased to 83% with a specificity of 68%, so that another 15 mutation carriers could be identified. In conclusion, these are the first results in humans showing that STV(QT) is increased in congenital LQTS, this effect is increased in patients with symptoms before therapy, and, hence, STV(QT) could prove to be a useful noninvasive additive marker for diagnostic screening to bridge the gap before results of genetic testing are available.",

Clarithromycin reacts at its dimethylamino group and yields the corresponding N-oxide that is no longer biologically active.

Solubility enhancement in basic pH was in following order: CTAB>T80>SDS>STC. CTAB and T80 showed remarkable solubility enhancement in acidic pH as well. Among the anionic surfactants, solubility in acidic medium was retarded except at pH 1.2 in case of SDS. Cationic and non-ionic surfactants were found to be suitable for enhancing the solubility of CP which can be employed for maintaining the in vitro sink condition in the basic dissolution medium.

These alterations were coupled to increased [Ca(2+)](c). In addition, glucose responsiveness of membrane potential, [Ca(2+)](c), and insulin secretion were shifted to lower glucose concentrations. SK4 protein was expressed in WT islets. An increase in K(+) currents and concomitant membrane hyperpolarization could be evoked in WT beta-cells by the SK4 channel opener DCEBIO (100 micromol/l). Accordingly, the SK4 channel blocker TRAM-34 (1 micromol/l) partly inhibited K(Ca) currents and induced electrical activity at a threshold glucose concentration. In stimulated WT beta-cells, TRAM-34 further increased [Ca(2+)](c) and broadened action potentials similar to those seen in SK4-KO beta-cells.

These pathological changes in external flow loads will inevitably cause vascular remodeling in the portal vein, which is usually measured by an opening angle. The present study showed that carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4))-induced portal hypertension fully developed at 8 weeks and the opening angle of portal vein increased progressively in the pathogenesis of intrahepatic portal hypertension which was significantly augmented at 10 weeks. Although portal pressure and portal flow were reduced, treatment with either propranolol or nifedipine alone for 3 weeks did not decrease the augmented opening angle of the portal vein, while combined treatment with propranolol and nifedipine markedly reduced the increased opening angle of the portal vein and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) mRNA expression but not inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA expression. The decreasing effect of propranolol plus nifedipine on the elevated opening angle was significantly weakened by L-arginine and markedly reinforced by N-nitro-l-arginine-mythel-ester (L-NAME). These results indicate that combined use of propranolol and nifedipine ameliorates portal vein remodeling in portal hypertension at least by the nitric oxide-dependent way.",

In general, all patients should be on aspirin (ASA) unless they are allergic or other contraindications, if so; clopidogrel should be added to the therapy. In addition to the antiplatelet therapy, which decreases mortality, patients should be started on beta blockers and nitrates. If there is no improvement in symptoms then a calcium channel blockers of the dihydropyridine family should be added. Patients with Diabetes Mellitus and/or left ventricular systolic dysfunction should be also started on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.

Adequate treatment for prolonged postoperative ileus is important to improve patient morbidity and clinical efficiency. Both clinical and pharmacological management strategies have improved rapidly over the last decade, and appropriate and timely management using multimodal techniques should be used for optimal care. In this review, we define postoperative ileus, describe the pathogenesis and briefly discuss clinical management before detailing potential pharmacologic management options.",

    "150": "The outcome in 101 catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia patients, including 50 probands, was analyzed. During a mean follow-up of 7.9 years, cardiac events defined as syncope, aborted cardiac arrest, including appropriate discharges from implantable defibrillators, or sudden cardiac death occurred in 27 patients, including 2 mutation carriers with normal exercise tests. The estimated 8-year event rate was 32% in the total population and 27% and 58% in the patients with and without beta-blockers, respectively. Absence of beta-blockers (hazard ratio [HR], 5.48; 95% CI, 1.80 to 16.68) and younger age at diagnosis (HR, 0.54 per decade; 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.89) were independent predictors. Fatal or near-fatal events defined as aborted cardiac arrest or sudden cardiac death occurred in 13 patients, resulting in an estimated 8-year event rate of 13%. Absence of beta-blockers (HR, 5.54; 95% CI, 1.17 to 26.15) and history of aborted cardiac arrest (HR, 13.01; 95% CI, 2.48 to 68.21) were independent predictors.

Further studies evaluating concomitant therapies are necessary to improve outcome in these patients.", 
    "152": "Recent studies have shown that the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is expressed in vascular tissue. However, the role that ENaC may play in the responses to vasoconstrictors and NO production has yet to be addressed. In this study, the contractile responses of perfused pressurized small-diameter rat mesenteric arteries to phenylephrine and serotonin were reduced by ENaC blockade with amiloride (75.1+/-3.2% and 16.9+/-2.3% of control values, respectively; P<0.01) that was dose dependent (EC(50)=88.9+/-1.6 nmol/L). Incubation with benzamil, another ENaC blocker, had similar effects. alpha, beta, and gamma ENaC were identified in small-diameter rat mesenteric arteries using RT-PCR and Western blot with specific antibodies. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry localized ENaC expression to the tunica media and endothelium of small-diameter rat mesenteric arteries. Patch-clamp experiments demonstrated that primary cultures of mesenteric artery endothelial cells expressed amiloride-sensitive sodium currents. Mechanical ablation of the endothelium or inhibition of eNOS with N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine inhibited the reduction in contractility caused by ENaC blockers. ENaC inhibitors increased eNOS phosphorylation (Ser 1177) and Akt phosphorylation (Ser 473). The presence of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 blunted Akt phosphorylation and eNOS phosphorylation and the decrease in the response to phenylephrine caused by blockers of ENaC, indicating that the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway was activated after ENaC inhibition. Finally, we observed that the effects of blockers of ENaC were flow dependent and that the vasodilatory response to shear stress was enhanced by ENaC blockade. Our results identify a previously unappreciated role for ENaC as a negative modulator of eNOS and NO production in resistance arteries.",

Results are reported at 4 years' follow-up. Survival free of all-cause mortality was 53% and cardiac death was 74%. Survival free of all-cause mortality was 50% (95% CI 35-72) for patients with moderate MR, 49% (95% CI 27-65) for severe MR, and 64% (95% CI 47-78) for mild MR (P = 0.03).

    "156": "Using both immunocytochemical and flow cytometric analyses of rat peritoneal exudate cells constitutive expression of tyrosine hydroxylase and both beta(2)- and alpha(1)- adrenoceptors on macrophages was revealed. Furthermore, according to the characteristic assemblage of tyrosine hydroxylase and adrenoceptor subtype expression different macrophage subsets were identified. In vitro treatment of macrophages with the non-selective alpha,beta-adrenoceptor agonist arterenol and/or the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol indicated that beta-adrenoceptors potentiated nitric oxide (NO) production and suggested alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated suppression of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) production. An increase in H(2)O(2) production in the presence of the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist ebrantil provided support for this. Chronic propranolol treatment in vivo led to increased NO and H(2)O(2) production by peritoneal macrophages. Furthermore, this treatment resulted in opposing effects on the expression of beta(2)- and alpha(1)-adrenoceptors on peritoneal macrophages (a stimulatory effect on beta(2)-adrenoceptors and a suppressive effect on alpha(1)-adrenoceptors). In conclusion, a subset of resident peritoneal macrophages synthesizes catecholamines, which may exert differential effects on H(2)O(2) and NO production via distinct adrenoceptors. Finally, chronic propranolol treatment affected adrenoceptor expression on peritoneal macrophages and altered their capacity to generate NO and H(2)O(2).",

    "158": "Renal function was estimated with glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the simplified Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation. Patients from the Metoprolol CR/XL Controlled Randomized Intervention Trial in Chronic HF (MERIT-HF) were divided into 3 renal function subgroups (MDRD formula): eGFR(MDRD) > 60 (n = 2496), eGFR(MDRD) 45 to 60 (n = 976), and eGFR(MDRD) < 45 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) body surface area (n = 493). Hazard ratio (HR) was estimated with Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for prespecified risk factors. Placebo patients with eGFR < 45 had significantly higher risk than those with eGFR > 60: HR for all-cause mortality, 1.90 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28 to 2.81) comparing placebo patients with eGFR < 45 and eGFR > 60, and for the combined end point of all-cause mortality/hospitalization for worsening HF (time to first event): HR, 1.91 (95% CI, 1.44 to 2.53). No significant increase in risk with deceased renal function was observed for those randomized to metoprolol controlled release (CR)/extended release (XL) due to a highly significant decrease in risk on metoprolol CR/XL in those with eGFR < 45. For total mortality, metoprolol CR/XL vs placebo: HR, 0.41 (95% CI. 0.25 to 0.68; P < .001) in those with eGFR < 45 compared with HR, 0.71 (95% CI, 0.54 to 0.95; P < .021) for those with eGFR > 60; corresponding data for the combined end point was HR, 0.44 (95% CI, 0.31 to 0.63; P < .0001) and HR, 0.75 (0.62 to 0.92; P = .005, respectively; P = .095 for interaction by treatment for total mortality; P = .011 for combined end point).

The prevalence of moderate to severe OSA was 26% and of CSA was 21%. Predictors of OSA were older age, male sex, and greater body mass index, and of CSA were older age, male sex, atrial fibrillation, hypocapnia, and diuretic use. Between 1997 and 2004, the prevalences of OSA and CSA did not change significantly (P(trend) =.460, P(trend) =.211, respectively) despite increased use of beta-blockers and spironolactone (P(trend) < .001, P(trend) < .001, respectively), and an increase in LVEF (P(trend)=.005).",

    "164": "Thirty patients, 17 female and 13 male, with CSX were enrolled in the study. Nebivolol (5 mg/day) or metoprolol (50 mg/day) was administrated for 12 weeks. Twelve hour fasting blood samples, taken at the initiation and on the third month of therapy, were analyzed for the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), nitrite+nitrate (NOx), and the activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO), superoxide dismutase (SOD). No patient presented additional risk factors for increased reactive oxygen species levels.", 
    "165": "Compared with sixteen control participants, patients with CSX had significantly higher activity of MPO and levels of MDA, but significantly lower SOD activity and levels of NOx before treatment. After treatment, MPO activity and MDA levels were significantly reduced; SOD activity and NOx levels were significantly increased with nebivolol but remained unchanged with metoprolol.", 
    "166": "We have shown that patients with CSX who taken nebivolol have lower serum MPO activity, levels of MDA and higher serum SOD activity, NOx levels when compared with metoprolol treatment. Exercise stress test parameters were also ameliorated in patients who had taken nebivolol in contrast to metoprolol.

In this case report we present the data of a patient with panic disorder and comorbid depression who was treated with high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) applied to the left prefrontal cortex over a course of 3 weeks. Measurements of the cerebral oxygenation with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during an emotional Stroop task before and after the rTMS treatment suggests that rTMS may modulate panic-related prefrontal brain dysfunctions in panic patients and that it may serve as a possible treatment option for anxiety disorders.", 
    "168": "An integrative, systems approach to the modelling of brain energy metabolism is presented. Mechanisms such as glutamate cycling between neurons and astrocytes and glycogen storage in astrocytes have been implemented. A unique feature of the model is its calibration using in vivo data of brain glucose and lactate from freely moving rats under various stimuli. The model has been used to perform simulated perturbation experiments that show that glycogen breakdown in astrocytes is significantly activated during sensory (tail pinch) stimulation. This mechanism provides an additional input of energy substrate during high consumption phases. By way of validation, data from the perfusion of 50 microM propranolol in the rat brain was compared with the model outputs. Propranolol affects the glucose dynamics during stimulation, and this was accurately reproduced in the model by a reduction in the glycogen breakdown in astrocytes. The model's predictive capacity was verified by using data from a sensory stimulation (restraint) that was not used for model calibration. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was conducted on the model parameters, this showed that the control of energy metabolism and transport processes are critical in the metabolic behaviour of cerebral tissue.", 
    "169": "Sepsis accounts for 50% of intensive care unit deaths due to cardiac dysfunction. The cellular mechanisms following norepinephrine (NE) during sepsis are undefined. Using a septic adult rat ventricular myocyte (ARVM) paradigm, we examined the molecular mechanism responsible for the blunted contractile response of NE. We tested the hypothesis that NE-induced increases in active caspase-3 contribute to sepsis-induced ARVM contractile dysfunction. Single ARVMs were isolated from hearts harvested from sham and septic male rats. The contractile properties and expression of caspase-3 cascade proteins were determined in ARVMs treated with NE with and without QVD-OPH, prazosin and atenolol to characterize the effect of NE on their mechanical properties. Septic ARVMs exhibited a significant decrease in peak shortening (PS) compared to sham ARVMs. The effect of NE on the PS of the sham ARVMs was more pronounced compared to the septic ARVMs, suggesting a blunted contractile response of NE. NE in the presence of QVD-OPH ameliorated the sepsis-induced decrease in PS at 18h but not at 1h, while the effect of NE on sepsis-induced contractile response remained unaffected at 18h by prazosin and atenolol. An up-regulated expression of caspase-3 in NE-treated septic ARVMs was reversed by QVD-OPH, as seen by the increased number of septic ARVMs exhibiting caspase-3 fluorescence. Transfection of ARVMs using caspase-3 siRNA blocked sepsis-induced up-regulation of caspase-3 and increased PS following NE treatment. These data suggest that caspase-3 inhibition ameliorated sepsis-induced decreased ARVM contractility and blocked the blunted contractile response of NE.", 
    "170": "An extracellular peroxygenase of Agrocybe aegerita catalyzed the H(2)O(2)-dependent hydroxylation of the multi-function beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol (1-naphthalen-1-yloxy-3-(propan-2-ylamino)propan-2-ol) and the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac (2-[2-[(2,6-dichlorophenyl)amino]phenyl]acetic acid) to give the human drug metabolites 5-hydroxypropranolol (5-OHP) and 4'-hydroxydiclofenac (4'-OHD). The reactions proceeded regioselectively with high isomeric purity and gave the desired 5-OHP and 4'-OHD in yields up to 20% and 65%, respectively. (18)O-labeling experiments showed that the phenolic hydroxyl groups in 5-OHP and 4'-OHD originated from H(2)O(2), which establishes that the reaction is mechanistically a peroxygenation. Our results raise the possibility that fungal peroxygenases may be useful for versatile, cost-effective, and scalable syntheses of drug metabolites.",

Nebivolol was reported to be as effective in lowering blood pressure (BP) as other beta-blockers (atenolol and bisoprolol), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (lisinopril and enalapril), the angiotensin-receptor blocker telmisartan, and calcium channel blockers (nifedipine and amlodipine). No published studies were identified that evaluated the effect of nebivolol on long-term cardiovascular outcomes. In data from a study in heart failure, nebivolol was associated with a 14% reduction in all-cause mortality and cardiovascular hospitalization at 12 months (P < 0.05). In comparative clinical studies, nebivolol appeared to be well tolerated relative to the other antihypertensive agents studied. The most commonly reported adverse events with nebivolol were fatigue (4%-79%), headache (2%-24%), paresthesia (7%-13%), bradycardia (6%-11%), rhinitis (1%-7%), and dizziness (2%-5%). Because of differences in its pharmacologic properties, nebivolol may have potential advantages in patients who are unable to tolerate traditional beta-blockers (eg, patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or men who experience erectile dysfunction while taking antihypertensive therapy).",

By the opposite way, stimulation with NMDA in OVX estrogen primed rats induced a significant increase of lordosis. In the present study the action of an alpha1-noradrenergic antagonist, HEAT (BE 2254/2-beta-4-Hydroxyphenyl-Ethyl-Aminomethyl-1-Tetralone), and Metoprolol, a beta-noradrenergic antagonist, were studied injecting them ICV previously to NMDA administration in treated OVX estrogen primed rats. In experiment 1, the enhancing effect on lordosis induced by NMDA at high dose (1 microg) was abolished by HEAT administration (P < 0.001 for 3 and 6 microg), and the LH plasma levels were decreased only with the higher dose (P < 0.05), suggesting that behavioral effects are quite more sensitive to the alpha-blockade than hormonal effects. In experiment 2, enhancing effects on lordosis behavior were not observed with neither the NMDA at low dose (0.5 microg) nor the metoprolol alone (5.71 microg), but a synergism was observed when both were simultaneously administered (P < 0.001). The LH plasma levels were increased by Metoprolol alone (P < 0.05), and powered by the combination with NMDA at low dose (P < 0.01 vs. SAL and NMDA alone); no differences were observed with Metoprolol. LH increase was observed with Metoprolol even without behavioural modifications. These findings strongly suggest that facilitatory and inhibitory effects of NMDA in this model are mediated by alpha- and beta-adrenergic transmission in both, behavioral and hormonal effects.",

This study was a retrospective cohort study carried out using data from claim forms provided to the central regional branch of the Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI) in Taiwan from January 2001 to December 2006. We estimated the odds ratios (ORs) of NOD associated with antihypertensive combination therapy use; non-NOD individuals served as the reference group. A total of 2361 NOD cases were identified among the 12,386 hypertensive patients (6143 men and 6243 women, aged 28-86 years (mean age: 68+11)) during the study period. The risk of NOD was higher after adjusting for age and sex among users of double combinations of diuretics plus beta-blockers (adjusted OR, 1.25; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.12-1.58), diuretics plus calcium channel blockers (CCBs; adjusted OR: 1.14; 95% CI: 1.06-1.26) and beta-blockers plus calcium channel blockers (adjusted OR: 1.12; 95% CI: 1.04-1.29) than that among non-users. Patients who took angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or alpha-blockers as part of a double-drug regimen were at a lower risk of developing NOD than were non-users. Double- or triple-drug combinations comprising angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and vasodilators were not associated with risk of NOD.
