Although routine treatment varies from one centre to another it often includes one or more of such measures as hyperventilation, high-dose barbiturate therapy, osmotherapy or the drainage of cerebrospinal fluid. The preservation of high cerebral perfusion pressure is fundamental to traditional treatment, often combined with inotropic support, as ischemia is considered to be a crucial factor with regard to the development of secondary injuries and oedema in the brain. In the article is described a new treatment of posttraumatic brain oedema, based on the hypothesis that the development of oedema is instead largely due to disturbance of brain volume control mechanisms resulting from increased permeability of the semi-permeable blood-brain barrier. If this hypothesis is true, oedema therapy should include measures to decrease hydrostatic capillary pressure and preserve normal colloid osmotic pressure. Our new therapy therefore includes hypotensive treatment in the form of beta 1-blockade and alpha 2-stimulation and precapillary vasoconstriction by dihydroergotamine (DHE) infusion, all of which reduce capillary pressure. The DHE may also constrict venous vessels, resulting in reduced blood volume. Colloid osmotic pressure is preserved with albumin infusion. Normovolemia is attained despite manifest fluid balance. With this therapy both mortality and morbidity have been reduced significantly, as compared to retrospective figures for a comparable control group.", 
    "1": "This study evaluated the effect of stimulating the central nervous system (CNS) with neostigmine, an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase, on the blood lactate concentration in fed rats and in rats fasted for 48 hours. After the rat was anesthetized with pentobarbital, neostigmine was stereotaxically injected into the third cerebral ventricle. In fed rats, the central injection of neostigmine significantly increased the blood lactate level, while concomitantly increasing plasma glucagon, epinephrine and norepinephrine concentrations. Constant infusion of somatostatin throughout the experiments, to inhibit glucagon secretion from the pancreas, did not affect alterations in blood lactate by central injection of neostigmine. In adreno-medullated rats, CNS-stimulation by neostigmine still increased plasma norepinephrine significantly, however, the alteration in blood lactate was only one-third of that in intact rats. Intraperitoneal propranolol, but not phentolamine, prevented the rise in lactate. Neostigmine increased lactate in fasted rats as well as in fed rats. We conclude that in anesthetized rats, stimulation of the CNS by neostigmine increases blood lactate mainly through circulating epinephrine and partially through circulating norepinephrine or direct sympathetic nervous stimulation; glucagon does not appear to be involved in the increase in blood lactate.", 
    "2": "The primary goal of the present study was to test whether selective pharmacologic blockade of alpha 1 receptors, and specifically of the subtype alpha 1a, could prevent ventricular fibrillation (VF) during acute myocardial ischemia.", 
    "3": "The development of new autonomic interventions is of clinical interest in view of the failure of traditional antiarrhythmic drugs to prevent sudden death. Experimental evidence indicates that alpha 1 receptors, and in particular the subtype alpha 1a, may be involved in the genesis of malignant arrhythmias during acute myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. Despite this evidence, questions have been raised about the actual antifibrillatory efficacy of alpha-adrenergic blockade in the acutely ischemic myocardium. The effects of prazosin and of abanoquil (UK 52,046), a highly selective alpha 1a receptor blocker, were tested and compared with propranolol in a conscious animal preparation for sudden death.", 
    "4": "Ten dogs with a 1-month-old anterior wall myocardial infarction were studied. These dogs had all developed, in control conditions, VF during a 2-minute occlusion of the circumflex coronary artery while exercising (n = 9) or lying on the table (n = 1). Afterwards, the dogs underwent additional tests with the following intravenously administered drugs: abanoquil (n = 10; 1 micrograms/kg), prazosin (n = 9; 0.1 mg/kg), and propranolol (n = 10; 1 mg/kg). Internal control analysis was used. All dogs tested had recurrence of VF with both alpha-adrenergic blockers. Propranolol significantly reduced heart rate during ischemia and prevented VF in 5 of 10 dogs tested (P < 0.05). When heart rate was kept constant by atrial pacing (n = 3), 2 of the 3 animals remained protected by propranolol. Just prior to onset of VF, heart rate was not significantly different in the control and in the abanoquil tests (237 +/- 45 and 253 +/- 34 beats/min, respectively), whereas it was higher (P < 0.05) with prazosin (288 +/- 40 beats/min).", 
    "5": "Alpha 1 and alpha 1a receptor blockers do not prevent VF secondary to acute myocardial ischemia in the presence of elevated sympathetic activity and heart rate. In the same setting, beta-adrenergic blockade prevents the reflex heart rate increase due to ischemia and provides a significant protection.", 
    "6": "The functional activity of various 5-HT receptor agonists, including 5-CT, sumatriptan, CP 93, 129 and 1-naphtylpiperazine, and of drugs known to bind with high affinity to 5-HT1B (pindolol, propranolol, cyanopindolol, SDZ 21,009 and isamoltane) or 5-HT1D binding sites (yohimbine and rauwolscine) was measured at 5-HT receptors that are negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase in cultures of the renal epithelial cell line OK. 5-HT receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase was studied by measuring inhibition of cAMP formation, induced by 100 microM forskolin. Besides 5-HT, various other compounds with affinity for 5-HT receptors behaved as agonists with the following rank order of potency: RU 24,969 > 5-CT > dihydroergotamine = 5-HT > CP 93,129 > d-LSD > 1-naphtylpiperazine > sumatriptan > TFMPP = mCPP > CGS 12066B = metergoline > methysergide. The beta-adrenergic receptor blockers cyanopindolol, SDZ 21,009, (-)-pindolol and (-)-propranolol, and the alpha 2-adrenergic blockers yohimbine and rauwolscine yielded agonist activity at nanomolar and micromolar concentrations, respectively. Isamoltane acted as a partial agonist. Methiothepin was the only compound that antagonised the OK cell 5-HT receptor-mediated inhibition of forskolin-induced cAMP formation. We conclude that the OK cell 5-HT receptor has properties consistent with a 5-HT1B receptor, although differences are apparent with regard to potencies of some compounds. Methiothepin is probably the only effective antagonist at 5-HT1B receptor sites, whereas the described putative 5-HT1B receptor antagonists have to be considered as partial agonists, yielding agonist or antagonist activity depending on the system that is studied.", 
    "7": "Beta-blockers, nitrates, aspirin and thrombolytic drugs have each separately been shown to reduce mortality in acute myocardial infarction, but the effect of these treatments combined during routine coronary care has not been assessed. The coronary care unit at Ostra Hospital services a stable community of 250,000 inhabitants. Since 1984 all patients have been entered into a computerized database. In addition, information on age, sex, discharge diagnosis and hospital outcome is also available for patients admitted between 1979 and 1983. In 1984, routine treatment with intravenous beta-blockers was introduced, to be followed in 1986 by intravenous nitroglycerin and in 1988 by aspirin in all patients without contraindications. Since 1988, intravenous thrombolytic treatment has been also given routinely to all patients with ST-elevation and chest pain < 6 h. Despite a similar number of patients and an increasing median age, the in-hospital mortality has declined from 18.5% in 1979 to 11.8% in 1990 (P < 0.01). It is concluded that mortality from acute myocardial infarction has declined by almost 40% since 1979. This reduction cannot be explained by a single major therapeutic intervention but may be attributed to the combined use of multi-lead monitoring, early use of beta-blockers, nitroglycerin, aspirin and thrombolytic agents.", 
    "8": "The role of a prostaglandin of the E series (PGE) in the hypothalamic mechanisms underlying a fever continues to be controversial. This paper reviews the historical literature and current findings on the central action of the PGEs on body temperature (Tb). New experiments were undertaken to examine the local effect of muscarinic, nicotinic, serotonergic, alpha-adrenergic, or beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists at hypothalamic sites where PGE1 caused a rise in Tb of the primate. Guide tubes for microinjection were implanted stereotaxically above sites in and around the anterior hypothalamic, preoptic area (AH/POA) of male Macaque monkeys. Following postoperative recovery, 30-100 ng of PGE1 was micro-injected unilaterally in a volume of 1.0-1.5 microliter at sites in the AH/POA to evoke a rise in Tb, and once identified, pretreated with a receptor antagonist. PGE1 hyperthermia was significantly reduced by microinjections of the muscarinic and nicotinic antagonists, atropine, or mecamylamine, at PGE1 reactive sites in the AH/POA. The serotonergic antagonist, methysergide, injected at PGE1 sensitive sites in the ventromedial hypothalamus also attenuated the rise in Tb. However, the 5-HT reuptake blocker, fluoxetine, and the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, propranolol, injected in the AH/POA failed to alter the PGE1 hyperthermia. In contrast, the alpha-adrenergic antagonist, phentolamine, potentiated the increase in Tb at all PGE1 reactive sites in the hypothalamus. An updated model is presented to explain how the concurrent actions of aminergic neurotransmitters acting on their respective receptors in the hypothalamus can interact with a PGE to elicit hyperthermia. Finally, an evaluation of the current literature including recent findings on macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP-1) supports the conclusion that a PGE in the brain is neither an obligatory nor essential factor for the expression of a pyrogen fever.", 
    "9": "Early reperfusion therapy, usually in the form of intravenous thrombolysis, is accepted as the standard therapy for patients with acute myocardial infarction. While thrombolytic therapy has been conclusively shown to reduce mortality, a large percentage of patients are not candidates for this therapy and, even in those who are candidates, as many as 25-30% have persistent occlusion or reocclusion of the infarct-related artery. Adjunctive pharmacologic therapy evolved in an attempt to address these issues and is given in addition to reperfusion therapy. Adjunctive therapy includes administration of one or more of the following: aspirin, heparin, beta-adrenergic blockers, nitroglycerin, heart-rate slowing calcium antagonists, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Data are emerging that indicate that some of these agents provide additional reduction in morbidity and mortality when used as adjunctive strategies. Currently, a recommended combination includes, at minimum, soluble aspirin, intravenous heparin, an intravenous beta-blocking agent, and oral angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor.", 
    "10": "1. The ideal drug treatment for atrial fibrillation will control resting heart rate, blunt exercise induced tachycardia whilst not exacerbating nocturnal bradycardia. Monotherapy with digoxin may not be ideal. We have compared the effect of combining digoxin (0.25 mg daily) with atenolol 50 mg and 100 mg or pindolol 5 mg twice daily and 15 mg twice daily in a cross-over randomised single-blind trial in eight symptomatic patients (six male; mean age 62 years) with poorly controlled atrial fibrillation. 2. Heart rate control was measured by 24 h ECG at baseline on digoxin therapy and after 2 weeks with each treatment. Symptom scores for breathlessness and palpitation were measured using visual analogue scales. 3. The addition of both beta-adrenoceptor blockers significantly reduced mean diurnal maximum heart rate from baseline (all P < 0.001 ANOVA). Atenolol at both doses caused a greater reduction than either dose of pindolol (P < 0.001 ANOVA). Nocturnal maximum heart rate was not significantly reduced from baseline by either beta-adrenoceptor blocker, but both doses of pindolol caused increases in nocturnal maximum heart rate compared with atenolol (P < 0.001 ANOVA). 4. Atenolol caused a reduction in diurnal minimum heart rate compared with baseline and caused a reduction in nocturnal minimum heart rate whereas pindolol caused an increase (P < 0.001 ANOVA). 5.

    "11": "After bilateral superior cervical ganglionectomy (SCGx) of adult male rats, norepinephrine (NE) content of the medial basal hypothalamus (MBH) decreased significantly by 39-47% from 16 h to 7 days after surgery. During this time the levels of serum growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL) and of MBH GH-releasing hormone (GRH), thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and somatostatin were measured by RIA. In sham-operated controls, serum PRL increased and serum GH decreased 16-24 h after surgery, attaining pre-surgical levels later on. In SCGx rats, significantly lower serum GH and PRL and higher MBH GRH and TRH content as compared to controls was observed 16-24 h after surgery, during the wallerian degeneration phase after SCGx. MBH somatostatin concentration decreased in SCGx rats 20 h after surgery. Two injections of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocker prazosin 45 and 90 min before sacrifice, alone or together with the beta-blocker propranolol, prevented the changes in MBH hypophysiotropic hormone content, as well as in serum GH and PRL levels, found in SCGx rats 20 h after surgery. Propranolol treatment did not affect hormone levels. Neither drug modified the decrease in MBH NE content observed after SCGx. The results argue in favor of the existence of physiologically relevant projections from superior cervical ganglion neurons to the MBH controlling hypophysiotropic hormone release.", 
    "12": "A chronobiological evaluation of the forced swimming test in rats treated with propranolol has shown that beta-adrenoblockers have antidepressive properties. This is true for oxprenolol which shows less pronounced affects. Nadolol that does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier insignificantly changes swimming behavior in the animals.", 
    "13": "Leao's cortical spreading depression (SD) is often cited as the pathophysiological substrate for the neurological symptoms of migraine with aura. If this is the case it might be expected that drugs useful as anti-migraine agents, particularly those useful in prophylaxis, may alter or prevent SD. Indeep it has been suggested that the anti-migraine compound dihydroergotamine (DHE) blocks or reduces the speed of propagation of SD in the rabbit. In this study we attempted to further investigate the effects of DHE and other anti-migraine drugs on SD by measuring cortical blood flow with laser Doppler flowmetry (CBFLDF) and cortical single unit activity in the alpha-chloralose-anaesthetised cat. The following substances were tested: DHE, acetylsalicylic acid, lignocaine, metoprolol, clonazepam and valproate. The NMDA-receptor blocker MK-801 and halothane (1.5%) were used as reference substances that reliably block SD. The outcome measures were speed of propagation of the wave of SD across the cortex and the CBFLDF increase during the hyperaemic phase of SD. Data were taken from three control episodes (60 min apart) and after drug administration. The rate of propagation was significantly reduced from the first control period (3.0 +/- 0.3 mm/min) to the subsequent 2 control observations (2.3 +/- 0.1 mm/min) even without any drug treatment. Following the control observations the test drug was administered and a further SD elicited. This fourth SD was reliably blocked by MK-801 and halothane. None of the other test drugs inhibited SD, reduced the rate of propagation or changed the amplitude of the CBFLDF increase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "14": "The effect of the new beta-adrenolytic drug Bl 343 Ac (propyl-3-acetyl-4-[(2-hydroxy-3-isopropylamino) propoxy] carbanylate hydrochloride) was tested in preparations of the guinea-pig atrium and compared with the effects of propranolol and metipranolol. BL 343 Ac has an affinity to beta-adrenergic receptors, expressed as the pA2 value, which is comparable to those of propranolol and metipranolol. To achieve the slope of the Schild plot not different from unity, it was necessary to prolong incubation of the drug with the tissue to 75 min. At the concentrations of 10(-5) and 10(-4) mol/l and higher, BL 343 Ac was found to have negative chronotropic and inotropic effects, respectively. IN atria isolated from guinea-pigs and rats premedicated with reserpine, application of 10(-8) and 10(-7) mol/l of Bl 343 Ac exhibited a slightly stimulatory effect on the chronotropy. A positive inotropic effect of Bl 343 Ac was observed on the left guinea-pig atria after prolongation of the incubation time of the drug with the tissue up to 75 min. This inotropic effect of Bl 343 Ac may be associated with an increased concentration of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), observed after 1-h incubation with the drug (from 0.78 +/- 0.05 to 1.13 +/- 0.09 pmol/mg w.w. cAMP). Bl 343 Ac, similarly to propranolol and metipranolol, prolonged the refractory period in the atrial preparations starting with the concentration of 10(-6) mol/l. In the ventricular preparations, Bl 343 Ac shortened the refractory period up to the concentration of 10(-5) mol/l, similarly to propranolol.", 
    "15": "A parotid acinar degranulation of approximately 60 and 40% was observed in cats under pentobarbitone anaesthesia after a 90-min period of continuous stimulation of the parasympathetic auriculo-temporal nerve at 10 Hz in the absence and presence of atropine, respectively. Atropine completely abolished the large fluid response of the gland to the nerve stimulation. In the non-atropinized cats, bethanechol, infused into the carotid artery at a dose rate evoking a salivary flow similar to that in response to parasympathetic nerve stimulation, caused an acinar degranulation of approximately 25% and acinar vacuolation. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP; 0.5 microgram kg-1 min-1 also infused into the carotid artery for 90 min) caused an acinar degranulation of the same magnitude as the parasympathomimetic drug but the peptide did not give rise to any fluid secretion or vacuole formation. The experiments were performed in the presence of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockers. Thus, in parotid glands of the cat, producing no overt secretion of fluid, non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic (NANC) mechanisms may be at work causing exocytosis of the acinar granules. These mechanisms are also likely to contribute to the secretion of granules in response to parasympathetic nerve activity in the absence of blockade of the classical autonomic receptors.",

    "20": "Mammalian neonates have been simultaneously described as having particularly poor memory, as evidenced by infantile amnesia, and as being particularly excellent learners with unusually plastic nervous systems that are easily influenced by experience. An understanding of the neurobiological constraints and mechanisms of early learning may contribute to a unified explanation of these two disparate views. Toward that end, we review here our work on the neurobiology of learning and memory in neonates. Specifically, we have examined the neurobiology of early learning using an olfactory classical conditioning paradigm. Olfactory classical conditioning in neonates at the behavioral level conforms well with the requirements and outcomes of classical conditioning described in adults. Furthermore, specific neural correlates of this behavioral conditioning have been described including anatomical and physiological changes, neural pathways, and modulatory systems. In this Review, we outline the behavioral paradigm, the identified neural correlates, and apparent mechanisms of this learning. Finally, we compare the neurobiology of early learning with that reported for mature animals, with specific reference to the role of US-CS convergence, memory modulation, consolidation, and distributed memory.",

    "22": "Using conventional and ion selective electrodes membrane potential and pHi were measured simultaneously in quiescent papillary muscles of guinea pigs in HEPES or bicarbonate buffered solution. Isoprenaline and propranolol (1 microM) plus phenylephrine (30 microM) were used to stimulate beta and alpha adrenoceptors, respectively. In order to evaluate underlying mechanism(s) of beta adrenoceptor mediated pHi change, effects of Na(+)-H+ exchange, Cl(-)-HCO3- exchange, Na(+)-HCO3- symport, and glycolysis blockers on the pHi change were examined.", 
    "23": "Isoprenaline (1 microM) produced a decrease in pHi of 0.08(SEM 0.01) pH units and a transient depolarisation of the resting membrane. The isoprenaline induced intracellular acidosis was blocked by the beta 1 blocker atenolol (10 microM) but not by the beta 2 blocker ICI 118,551 (0.1 microM). Forskolin also produced a decrease in pHi of 0.06(0.03) pH units. In contrast, alpha adrenergic stimulation produced an increase in pHi, which was abolished by 1 mM amiloride, an Na(+)-H+ exchange blocker. In the presence of amiloride, the isoprenaline induced decrease in pHi was rather enhanced. 4,4'-Diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulphonic acid (DIDS, 1 mM), a blocker of Cl(-)-HCO3- exchange and the Na(+)-HCO3- symport system, failed to affect the isoprenaline induced pHi decrease in bicarbonate buffered solution.

    "25": "In the present study, we reinvestigated the question of whether human heart rate variability (HRV) is fractal in nature. Ten healthy volunteers participated in either of two studies conducted while beat-by-beat long-term HRV (8,500 heartbeats) was recorded for 2-3 h in the quiet, awake state in the supine position. In the first study, five subjects were tested four times each to evaluate the basic fractal nature of human HRV. The other five subjects were examined for the effects of oral propranolol (2 x 80 mg/day) on the fractal property of HRV in the second study. HRV data were analyzed by coarse-graining spectral analysis to break down their total power into harmonic and nonharmonic (fractal) components. The harmonic component was further divided into low (0.0-0.15 Hz; LF)- and high (> 0.15 Hz; HF)-frequency components. From these spectral components, %Fractal, %LF, and %HF as functions of total power were calculated. The fractal component was used to calculate the spectral exponent, beta. The %Fractal of human resting HRV was 85.5 +/- 4.4% (mean +/- SD, n = 20). The beta for the fractal HRV was 1.08 +/- 0.18 (n = 20). With propranolol, these basic properties of fractal HRV dynamics remained unchanged despite an increase in the mean RR interval (placebo, 912 +/- 111 ms; propranolol, 1,134 +/- 133 ms, P < 0.05) and a change in the harmonic spectral shape evaluated by LF/HF (placebo, 2.76 +/- 1.57; propranolol, 1.82 +/- 0.81, P < 0.05). For short-term data, less power was extracted as fractal because of the absence of the very low frequency component, yet the beta and LF/HF were unchanged from long-term data. These findings indicate that 1) the observed inversely proportional frequency (1/f) spectrum in human resting HRV is due to underlying random fractal dynamics and 2) the sympathetic nervous system seemed to play a minor role in modulating the fractal HRV dynamics.", 
    "26": "This study aimed to determine whether a putative ATP-sensitive K(+)-channel blocker, glibenclamide (Glb), prevents metabolic coronary vasodilation associated with increased myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2) caused by beta 1-adrenoceptor stimulation in anesthetized open-chest dogs. Isoproterenol (Iso) was infused selectively into the left circumflex coronary artery before and after Glb. Coronary blood flow (CBF) by an electromagnetic flowmeter, regional myocardial function by sonomicrometers, and left ventricular and arterial pressures were continuously measured. An intracoronary infusion of Iso (10 ng.kg-1 x min-1) resulted in the sustained increase in CBF as well as in the myocardial inotropic and chronotropic state. Glb (10, 30, and 100 micrograms/min ic) attenuated the Iso-induced increase in CBF in a dose-dependent manner, whereas inotropic and chronotropic responses to Iso were not affected by Glb. After beta 1-blockade with bisoprolol (0.3 mg/kg), which completely inhibited inotropic and chronotropic responses to Iso, the Iso-induced increase in CBF, presumably mediated by vascular beta 2-receptor stimulation, was not affected by Glb. Intracoronary denopamine (0.1 microgram.kg-1 x min-1), a beta 1-selective agonist, increased CBF, which was almost completely abolished by Glb. The increases in MVO2 induced by Iso or denopamine were similar before and after Glb, indicating that attenuation of the Iso- or denopamine-induced increase in CBF by Glb did not result from the decrease in MVO2. These results indicate that Glb prevented the increase in CBF associated with increased MVO2 caused by beta 1-adrenoceptor stimulation. It is suggested that ATP-sensitive K+ channels may play an important role in metabolic coronary vasodilation in dogs.", 
    "27": "To characterize the physiological function of the beta-3 adrenergic receptor subtype in vivo, the effects of a beta-3 adrenergic receptor agonist, BRL37344, were examined on systemic hemodynamics and regional blood flow distribution. They were compared with beta-1 or beta-2 adrenergic receptor stimulation using isoproterenol (ISO) in conscious dogs instrumented with aortic and left atrial catheters and ascending aortic flow probes. ISO, at a dose of 0.4 micrograms/kg/min i.v., reduced mean arterial pressure by 7 +/- 3% and increased total peripheral conductance by 145 +/- 12% and heart rate by 109 +/- 10%. BRL37344, at a dose of 8.3 micrograms/kg i.v., reduced mean arterial pressure by 9 +/- 4% and increased total peripheral conductance by 91 +/- 3% and heart rate by 63 +/- 5%. In the presence of selective beta-1 adrenergic receptor blockade with atenolol, ISO decreased mean arterial pressure by 20 +/- 5% and increased total peripheral conductance by 140 +/- 26% and heart rate by 60 +/- 12%. After combined beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptor blockade with propranolol, ISO induced no significant effects. By contrast, after propranolol, BRL37344 still reduced mean arterial pressure by 13 +/- 2% and increased total peripheral conductance by 109 +/- 8% and heart rate by 45 +/- 5%.

    "32": "Propafenone, a sodium channel blocking antiarrhythmic drug with beta-blocking properties, is metabolized to non-beta-blocking metabolites in part by cytochrome P4502D6. Subtherapeutic doses of quinidine inhibit P4502D6 and increase plasma propafenone in extensive metabolizer subjects, in whom the active enzyme is present. In this study we tested the hypothesis that quinidine would enhance beta-blockade in extensive metabolizers receiving propafenone. Seven extensive and two poor metabolizers received propafenone (225 mg orally every 8 hours) plus quinidine sulfate (60 mg orally every 8 hours) or propafenone plus placebo for 7 days in a randomized, double-blind, crossover fashion. In extensive metabolizers, the coadministration of quinidine significantly increased the extent of propafenone-induced beta-blockade, assessed by a decrease in exercise heart rate and by sensitivity to isoproterenol. We conclude that low-dose quinidine enhances propafenone-induced beta-blockade in extensive metabolizers. Thus the polymorphic patterns of drug metabolism can result in clinically significant drug interactions on a genetic basis.", 
    "33": "This study evaluated activation of beta-adrenoceptors and the cAMP pathway on prorenin secretion from human placental explants. For comparative purposes, hCG secretion was also measured. Treatment with selective beta-adrenergic agonists (beta 1-dobutamine and beta 2-terbutaline) produced dose-dependent increases in prorenin secretion, with dobutamine yielding a greater response (10- vs. 6-fold). In contrast, hCG secretion was stimulated only by terbutaline (5-fold). Prorenin and hCG secretory responses were inhibited by corresponding selective receptor antagonists (beta 1-metoprolol and beta 2-ICI 118,551). Selective phosphodiesterase inhibitors were used to evaluate the role of cAMP in mediating these responses. Marked potentiation of beta-adrenoceptor-dependent prorenin secretion was observed with the type III inhibitor, cilostamide (63-76%), and the type IV inhibitor, Ro-201724 (32-43%). Type I (8-methoxymethyl-3-isobutylmethylxanthine) and type V inhibitors (dipyridamole and M&B 22,948) showed no potentiation. These studies demonstrate that activation of both beta 1- and beta 2-receptors stimulates placental prorenin release. The potentiation of beta-adrenergically activated prorenin release by selective inhibitors of phosphodiesterase indicates a coupling of beta-adrenoceptor and adenylate cyclase. The contrast in secretion of prorenin and hCG by selective beta-adrenergic agonists suggests differences in cellular localization. The results indicate that clinically used adrenergic agonists can affect the placental renin-angiotensin system. The role of endogenous activators of beta-adrenoceptors in this system remains to be determined.",

    "35": "We used cross-sectional screening for significant symptoms of depression using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale and identification of patients' clinical characteristics from patient interviews and a computerized medical record. The setting was an academic primary care group practice at an urban ambulatory care center. Participants were 1,633 consecutively consenting patients aged 60 and older who visited the center between January and August 1991. Mean age was 70 years; 72% were women, 32% were White, 47% had less than 8 years of education, and 7% had no health insurance.", 
    "36": "There were 251 (15%) patients with significant symptoms of depression. Antidepressants were prescribed to 1 in 7 patients with such symptoms, with amitriptyline being the most commonly prescribed. Bivariate analyses indicated that patients with significant symptoms of depression were more likely to be White, female, without health insurance, and were more likely to have probable alcoholism, mild cognitive loss, and to receive narcotics, histamine H2 antagonists, and/or benzodiazepines. Depressive symptoms were not significantly correlated with age, education, income, or chronic medical conditions.", 
    "37": "Significant symptoms of depression were common and correlated with several readily available clinical variables. However, these variables lack sufficient discriminatory power to allow for the selective screening of elderly patients most likely to suffer from symptoms of depression. Thus, formal screening for depression among all elderly patients in primary care may be necessary to improve the recognition of this morbid illness.", 
    "38": "Head-upright tilt (HUT) testing is valuable in evaluating syncope. Isoproterenol is used to increase sensitivity. However, isoproterenol is contraindicated or dangerous in undiagnosed heart disease and produces false-positives. We introduced esmolol withdrawal during esmolol HUT, hypothesizing that (1) acute withdrawal of the ultrashort-acting beta-blocker induces beta-adrenergic effects by unmasking endogenous catecholamines and may provoke syncope with fewer risks, and (2) response to esmolol/esmolol withdrawal may predict effective therapy.", 
    "39": "Thirty-six patients with unexplained recurrent syncope/presyncope (7 to 35 years old, known heart disease or arrhythmia in 14) underwent 2 to 4 HUT tests (60 degrees, 49 minutes): (1) baseline, (2) esmolol (500 micrograms/kg plus 50 micrograms.kg-1.min-1), (3) esmolol withdrawal (HUT continued after esmolol stopped), and (4) isoproterenol if tests 1 through 3 were negative and isoproterenol was not contraindicated. A positive test reproduced symptoms with hypotension or bradycardia, requiring recumbency for recovery. Twenty-five had positive tests, and 11 had negative tests. In 5, only the baseline test was positive; in 15, esmolol/esmolol withdrawal tests were also positive, with 3 in whom esmolol withdrawal was positive although negative at baseline. Two isoproterenol tilts were positive. Esmolol withdrawal and isoproterenol tilts had the highest initial heart rate and similar maximal heart rate increment. Only isoproterenol caused hypertension. One isoproterenol test was false-positive, with hypertension-induced arterial baroreflex. Treatment was beta-blockers (8), Na/fludrocortisone (9), both (6), and DDD pacemakers (2). Esmolol/esmolol withdrawal accurately predicted therapeutic response in 15; isoproterenol predicted therapeutic response in none.", 
    "40": "Esmolol withdrawal tilt testing is preferable to isoproterenol for provocative testing of syncope in the young, and it appears to be safer. Esmolol withdrawal testing has clinical utility before invasive testing as a first-line investigation for syncope in patients with or without heart disease.", 
    "41": "Mutant isolates from the Y1 mouse adrenocortical tumor cell line (designated Y1DR) were previously shown to resist homologous desensitization of adenylyl cyclase via endogenous ACTH receptors or transfected beta 2-adrenergic receptors. To further localize the site of the DR mutation, we examined the agonist-binding properties of the transfected beta 2-adrenergic receptor in parental Y1 cells and the DR mutant before and after desensitization with the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol. Binding studies were carried out using [125I]iodocyanopindolol as the labeled ligand and isoproterenol as the competing agonist. We found that the DR mutant has a greater number of high affinity receptors in the basal state than does the Y1 parent (70-80% vs. < or = 50%) and that treatment of membranes from parent or mutant cells with guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate and NaCl converts all of the high affinity sites to low affinity sites. After desensitization with isoproterenol, only low affinity binding sites are detected in parental Y1 cells, whereas the DR mutants retain an appreciable number of high affinity receptors. These results indicate that the DR mutant may resist desensitization by affecting agonist-induced uncoupling of receptors from their guanyl nucleotide-binding regulatory G-proteins.",

    "43": "For inclusion in the study, all patients had to manifest general symptoms of mediator release such as generalized pruritus, urticaria, angioedema, and flushing. Of the 179 patients with anaphylaxis (mean age, 36 years), 66% were female, 49% had atopy, and 37% had a previous history of immediate reactions to allergens. Of these study patients, 11 were receiving medications capable of exacerbating anaphylaxis (beta-blockers in 7 of them).", 
    "44": "Consultation with an allergist was obtained in 142 cases, and a probable diagnosis was made after review of the medical records. Causes of anaphylaxis included foods in 59 patients, idiopathic in 34, Hymenoptera in 25, medications in 23, and exercise in 12; false-positive diagnoses were recorded in 18. Allergy prick tests were done in 104 patients, 71 of whom had positive results; allergen-specific IgE tests were done in 44 patients, 23 of whom had positive results. In 19 patients, only allergen-specific IgE testing was done, and results were positive in 12. Normal test results included C1 esterase inhibitor in 33 patients, metabisulfite challenge in 15, and dye or preservative challenge in 10. Food skin tests were graded on a relative value scale and revealed 15 highly allergic, 24 moderately allergic, and 39 weakly allergic food groups.", 
    "45": "A standard protocol should be used for assessment of patients with anaphylaxis, and fresh food extracts should be used for prick skin testing. A national incidence study of anaphylaxis is needed. The public and school personnel should be educated about food anaphylaxis, and emergency treatment for anaphylaxis should be readily available for patients.", 
    "46": "Astrocytes in culture can maintain glutamate uptake during hypoxia if glucose is available. To determine whether this capacity is shared by brain in situ, extracellular glutamate levels were measured in ischemic brain under conditions of continued glucose delivery. Microdialysis probes were placed bilaterally in caudate nuclei of rats and perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) containing either 30 or 0 mM glucose. Global cerebral ischemia was induced by cardiac arrest. Dialysate collected from probes not perfused with glucose showed a 50-fold increase in glutamate levels over the 60 min following cardiac arrest. Addition of glucose to the perfusate reduced the glutamate rise to < 20% of the levels attained in the glucose-free probes. The glucose effect was negated by the addition of 0.5 mM of the glutamate uptake blocker threo-beta-hydroxyaspartate to the artificial CSF. These results show that oxygen is not required to maintain efficient uptake of extracellular glutamate in brain and suggest that elevations in extracellular glutamate levels during ischemia result from metabolic perturbations other than hypoxia.", 
    "47": "Arterial hypertension is one of the few factors confirmed to accelerate the development of renal failure. Conversely, several studies have documented that systematic reduction of the blood pressure slows the progression of renal failure. It is postulated that 24-h reduction of the blood pressure should be achieved, best controlled by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, and that the elevated blood pressure should be reduced to at least below 140/90 mm Hg. In assessing the progression of renal failure, the renal plasma flow and the glomerular filtration rate are measured, because both renal hemodynamic parameters correlate with the degree of severity of histologic changes. Renal blood flow is increased by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and unchanged or slightly increased by calcium antagonists, whereas renal plasma flow is somewhat decreased by diuretics and beta-blockers. A further criterion for assessing the potential nephroprotective properties of antihypertensive agents is their influence on intraglomerular hemodynamics. According to animal studies, ACE inhibitors can prevent elevated intraglomerular pressure and the associated development of glomerulosclerosis. Retrospective and prospective studies could also demonstrate these findings in human subjects. Despite an equally effective reduction of systemic blood pressure by the antihypertensive medication, there was a lesser reduction in glomerular filtration rate with ACE inhibitors than when another conventional antihypertensive medication was used. It should be further clarified whether these favorable effects of ACE inhibitors were due also to antiproliferative properties (e.g., blockade of the growth-stimulating factor angiotensin II). The results for calcium antagonists are contradictory. Their protective properties in acute renal failure have been documented, but there are no clinical studies verifying the effect of long-term administration of calcium antagonists on the development of renal failure. To summarize, it has been confirmed to date that systemic antihypertensive therapy slows the progression of renal failure of any etiology, and there is initial proof that ACE inhibitors are superior to other antihypertensive agents in this respect.", 
    "48": "Obesity is the most common reason for insulin resistance with consequent hyperinsulinemia. Other reasons for hyperinsulinemia are type II diabetes mellitus and a genetic predisposition with a family history of hypertension. Hyperinsulinemia is considered to cause blood pressure elevation and is generally accepted as an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis. However, insulin per se does not elevate blood pressure, but rather reduces total peripheral vascular resistance in experimental studies. Blood pressure might be elevated by other mechanisms secondary to hyperinsulinemia, however, such as enhanced renal sodium retention, elevated intracellular free calcium, and increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system. Indeed, subjects whose blood pressure is salt-sensitive exhibit hyperinsulinemia after glucose loading, and normotensive subjects with glucose-induced hyperinsulinemia will develop hypertension within 5 years more often than normoinsulinemic subjects. In primary hypertension, the incidence of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia is much higher than in normotensive controls. However, not all reported studies show a relationship between hyperinsulinemia and blood pressure elevation, and in some experimental studies no blood pressure elevation could be induced by prolonged hyperinsulinemia. Therefore, it is still unclear whether hyperinsulinemia induces hypertension or is only casually associated with it. Nevertheless, treatment of hyperinsulinemia is recommended to avoid secondary complications. Treatment should begin with weight reduction and physical exercise, which will improve insulin resistance. Hypertension benefits more from weight reduction than from exercise. If drug therapy of hypertension is required, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium-channel blockers are the drugs of first choice. In addition, beta-blockers and centrally acting drugs appear to be of certain benefit. However, diuretics must be used carefully, because they ameliorate insulin resistance, induce dyslipoproteinemia, and stimulate the sympathetic nervous system.", 
    "49": "In recent years, indirect ambulatory 24-h blood pressure monitoring and self-measurement at home have gained increasing importance in pharmacologic studies. Both methods have important advantages over conventional casual blood pressure determinations in the clinic. The better reproducibility of blood pressure recordings by either ambulatory monitoring or home readings suggests that both techniques are superior to office readings for evaluating the effect of antihypertensive therapy. The multiple readings obtained during ambulatory 24-h monitoring or by self-measurement at home reduce the variability of blood pressure estimates and substantially decrease the number of patients needed to detect clinically relevant blood pressure differences. Furthermore, dose-response relationships of new and established antihypertensive drugs are improved, as the random effect of blood pressure measurements falls below the expected treatment effect. Although there is some overlap between the information obtained with home and ambulatory monitoring, there are also important differences. Ambulatory monitoring provides information about the diurnal profile of blood pressure and has great advantages for trials investigating the time course of a particular drug. Self-measurement can provide repeated measurements in the same situation over prolonged periods of time, and therefore is ideally suited for monitoring changes in blood pressure induced by treatment or progression of the disease. In pharmacologic studies both techniques are thus complementary.", 
    "50": "Several studies were performed to evaluate the degree of inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by an ACE inhibitor by assessing the blood pressure response to a continuous i.v. infusion of increasing doses of angiotensin I in healthy volunteers. We assessed pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions of the ACE inhibitor cilazapril and the beta-blocker propranolol in healthy volunteers and patients with essential hypertension. We also evaluated the effect of cilazapril on aortic compliance in hypertension by pulse-wave velocity along the aorta. We showed that single oral doses of cilazapril 4 mg, captopril 25 mg, or enalapril 10 mg shifted the angiotensin I dose-effect curve to the right and determined a pharmacologic half-life of about 4 h for cilazapril. Increasing single oral doses (1.25, 3.75, 10, and 30 mg) of cilazapril reduced diastolic blood pressure dose-dependently and shifted the angiotensin I dose-response curves to the right. The dose representing 50% inhibition of ACE activity (apparent Ki dose) was about 0.6 mg 3 h after cilazapril administration. Cilazapril and propranolol did not exhibit significant pharmacokinetic interaction in healthy volunteers; each drug reduced diastolic and systolic blood pressure by about 7 mm Hg, and this was doubled by the combination. Monotherapy with each drug reduced blood pressure, and combined administration enhanced the antihypertensive effect. The reduction in cardiac output and the increase in total peripheral resistance induced by propranolol were attenuated by the cilazapril-propranolol combination.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "51": "Growth hormone (GH) improves the metabolic and immunitary parameters in the postoperative period. Clonidine, a central acting alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist stimulates GH release and is currently used as a screening test for GH-deficiency. A continuous iv infusion of clonidine may lead to a sustained increase in GH secretion during the perioperative period. With institutional approval and after informed consent, 20 healthy (ASA 1) patients scheduled for functional middle ear surgery under deliberate hypotensive anesthesia were studied. The anesthetic technique consisted of isoflurane, fentanyl and atracurium. Patients were randomly assigned to two groups. In group 1, hemodynamic stabilisation was obtained with a loading dose of clonidine (4 micrograms.kg-1 in 30 min) and maintained with an infusion of 1 microgram.kg-1.h-1. In group 2, a loading dose of labetalol 0.2 mg.kg-1 was followed by an infusion of 0.1 mg.kg-1.h-1. These infusions were stopped 30 min. before the end of the procedure. GH and glucose concentrations were assayed before the induction of anesthesia, after the loading dose and every 30 min. during the procedure and after the recovery during 2 hours. Serum clonidine levels were assayed after the loading dose, 1 and 3 hours later. Somatomedin C (IGF-I) concentration was measured before the induction and in the first postoperative morning along with GH, glucose and clonidine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "52": "Aortic haemodynamic parameters, and Doppler waveforms in particular, were investigated in acute experiments with fetal lambs. Cardiovascular changes were produced by central infusion of the drugs esmolol and dopamine. Pulsed Doppler waveforms were obtained from the descending thoracic aorta, simultaneous with recordings of pulsatile aortic volume flow rate, diameter and blood pressure. The relation between Doppler-derived velocities and the corresponding full vessel lumen velocities was shown to be fairly linear and consistent across different animals. The aortic volume flow per beat decreased with esmolol (p < 0.003, repeated measures ANOVA); the Doppler and vessel lumen mean velocities also decreased, whether measured only at peak systole or over the full cardiac cycle (at most p < 0.003). With dopamine the aortic flow per beat increased (p < 0.001), as did the Doppler and vessel lumen mean velocities (at most p < 0.02). An inverse relation between the aortic flow per beat and the peripheral resistance was observed. To identify inotropic changes in the presence of vascular effects, a theoretical model based on cardiac power output changes was implemented. The data were divided into three groups, according to whether the model did or did not identify a definite inotropic effect (positive or negative). The Doppler velocity changes for these three groups were different (p < 0.0001). The mean Doppler velocity increased by 7 cm s-1 in the positive inotropic effect group, and decreased by 4 cm s-1 in the negative group. The aortic flow parameters of the human fetus are very similar to those of the fetal lamb.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "53": "The randomized single-blind study was designed to compare the effects of captopril (Cap) and nadolol (Nad) on renal hemodynamics in 60 patients with essential hypertension. They were divided into two groups at random. Cap was given in dosage of 37.5-75 mg/d per os and Nad 40-80 mg/d. The results show that both drugs increase the blood volume distributed to the kidneys from cardiac output (renal blood flow/cardiac output), Cap increasing 10% (P < 0.05) and Nad 8% (P < 0.05). Renal vascular resistance (RVR) is lowered by the two drugs, 13% (P < 0.05) by Cap and 11% (P < 0.05) by Nad. These suggest that both drugs facilitate the maintenance of renal blood circulation in patients with essential hypertension, being beneficial for long-term treatment of hypertension.", 
    "54": "The frequency distribution of the 8-h urinary ratio of log metoprolol/alpha-hydroxymetoprolol was assessed in 65 healthy, unrelated Jordanian volunteers. There was no apparent bimodality in the frequency distribution of this ratio among the subjects studied. The frequency of the poor metabolizer phenotype of metoprolol alpha-hydroxylation was 1.5% (one subject). There was a significant correlation (r = 0.61, P < 0.05, n = 39) between the log metoprolol/alpha-hydroxymetoprolol and the log debrisoquine/4-hydroxydebrisoquine ratios. However, the frequency of poor metabolizer status of debrisoquine among the 39 subjects was 7.7% (three subjects). Only one of the poor metabolizer of metoprolol alpha-hydroxylation. These findings indicate that metoprolol alpha-hydroxylation by CYP2D6 represents a poor probe for studying debrisoquine polymorphism in Jordanians.", 
    "55": "The mechanism for adrenergic desensitisation during physical stress was studied by measuring [125I] cyanopindolol ([125I]CYP) binding sites and the adrenaline stimulated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) responses in peripheral blood leucocytes from ten male cadets during a 5-day military training course. The cadets had physical activities around the clock corresponding to a daily energy consumption of about 40,000 kJ but with an intake of only 2,000 kJ, and only 1-3 h of sleep in the 5 days. During the course, the maximal cAMP response to adrenaline stimulation was reduced to about 45% in granulocytes and to 52% in mononuclear cells, and the half maximal response was obtained only at 5-10 times higher adrenaline concentrations than in the control experiment. The binding sites for [125I]-CYP in mononuclear cells increased during the course. However, [125I]-CYP measured not only surface receptors but also intracellular receptors and might even have represented other binding sites. In conclusion, this study showed that decreased cAMP response to adrenergic stimulation would seem to be one of the mechanisms behind adrenergic desensitisation during stress.", 
    "56": "Blood levels of cyclic nucleotides and their actions on central hemodynamics were studied in 129 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. A direct correlation was established between heart rate, pulmonary artery systolic pressure and concentrations of cyclic adenosine monophosphate. Basing on this finding, the authors propose introduction of beta-adrenoblockers in hyperkinetic circulation tuberculous patients to prevent cor pulmonale. Administration of anapriline in tuberculous patients with compensated cor pulmonale and symptoms of sympathoadrenal hyperfunction improves the patients' condition, promotes a decrease in cardiac output, cardiac index, systolic pressure in the pulmonary artery. No side effects of the drug were reported.", 
    "57": "This study investigated the effect of betaxolol, a beta 1 selective blocker, on the retinal circulation in 10 patients with ocular hypertension. In a masked randomised fashion, one eye of each subject received betaxolol and the fellow eye received placebo (hypromellose). Retinal blood flow (RBF) was determined in a major temporal vein of each eye just prior to instillation of drops and 2 h later, using laser Doppler velocimetry and monochromatic fundus photography. There was an increase of 15.0% in RBF (p = 0.03) in the betaxolol-treated eyes. No significant change was observed in the placebo-treated eyes. Intraocular pressure was reduced by 27.7% in the treated eyes, resulting in an increase of 16.9% in perfusion pressure (p = 0.02) compared with an 8.4% increase in placebo-treated eyes (p = 0.15). This study demonstrated that betaxolol increases RBF in eyes with ocular hypertension; this increase is probably related to the increase in perfusion pressure.",

The auscultatory findings first suggested bronchospasm; however, specific measures failed to improve pulmonary function. The planned procedure was delayed and further investigations showed acute left heart failure due to beta-blockade combining with general anaesthesia.", 
    "59": "The effects of chronic oral administration of propanolol and metoprolol on blood pressure and GABAergic function were investigated in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and compared with the effect of dihydralazine. Under the experiment conditions employed all drugs reduced significantly (p < 0.01) arterial pressure. The beta blockers elevated GABA turnover in the hypothalamus and the pons-medulla. Dihydralazine, however had not such an effect. Our result suggest that the antihypertensive action of beta blockers may be related in part to the enhanced cerebral GABAergic transmission.",

    "61": "In precollicular decerebrate cats, the vestibulospinal reflex (VSR) was intermittently recorded from the triceps brachii during sinusoidal roll tilt of the whole animal (at 0.15 Hz, +/- 10 degrees), leading to selective stimulation of labyrinth receptors. This reflex, tested during and after a 3-h period of sustained animal tilt at the same parameters indicated above, showed an adaptive increase in gain in some experiments but not in others. In a second group of experiments, however, rotation of the head (at 0.15 Hz, +/- 10 degrees) was associated with a synchronous body rotation (at 0.15 Hz, +/- 12.5 degrees) which led to an additional neck input, due to 2.5 degrees of out-phase body-to-head displacement. In these experiments, the VSR, tested every 10-15 min, consistently showed an adaptive increase in gain during and after a 3-h period of sustained vestibular and neck stimulation. Microinjection into the cerebellar anterior vermis of beta-adrenergic agents (0.25 microliters at 8 micrograms/microliters saline) produced slight and short-lasting changes in the basic amplitude of the VSR, due to the neuromodulatory influence of these agents on the Purkinje cells activity. In addition, the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol brought to the light an adaptive process in those experiments in which no adaptation occurred during a sustained roll tilt of the whole animal. On the other hand, the beta-adrenergic antagonists propranolol or sotalol either suppressed the increase in gain of the VSR which occurred in other experiments during sustained animal rotation, or prevented the occurrence of an adaptive increase in gain during a continuous out-phase head and body rotation. We conclude that the adaptive changes in gain of the VSR are facilitated by the noradrenergic system acting within the cerebellar cortex through beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "62": "Using autoradiographic techniques we studied the changes that in adrenergic receptors occurred in the cerebellum of two olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA) patients as compared with a control group. In OPCA cerebellum the densities of total beta-adrenoceptors were reduced along the cortex but increased in the white matter. Although mainly the beta 1 subtype was decreased along the cerebellar cortex, the increase of beta-receptors over the white matter was due to a selective raise in the beta 2 subtype. These findings suggest a postsynaptic neuronal location for the beta 1 subtype and a glial location for the beta 2-adrenoceptor. On the other hand, alpha 2-adrenoceptors were clearly reduced all along the cerebellar cortex of these OPCA brains, this probably being secondary to the loss of presynaptic adrenergic terminals arising from the locus coeruleus. These results help clarify both the subcellular location of adrenoceptors in human cerebellum and the neurochemical pathophysiology of OPCA.", 
    "63": "The nocturnal production of melatonin synthesis has been associated with circadian mechanisms of the organization of sleep. It is well known that the synthesis of melatonin is under the control of pineal beta 1-adrenoreceptors. In this study the effect of ten weeks treatment with the beta-adrenoreceptor (beta-AR) blockers propranolol and ridazolol on melatonin synthesis and on sleep quality was examined in 42 patients suffering from essential hypertension. Before and after 6 and 10 weeks of beta-AR-blocker administration urinary sulfatoxymelatonin excretion rates were measured and sleep factors were evaluated by using a standardized sleep inventory consisting of self-rating sleepiness scales. After 6 and 10 weeks of treatment, a significant about 50 percent reduction of sulfatoxymelatonin was measured. No relationship between these reductions and changes in sleep factors was found. The results indicate that a reduced nightly amplitude of melatonin has minor significance for the organization of physiological sleep. Furthermore, it is suggested that pineal mechanisms beside the beta 1-adrenergic receptor transduction system serve to maintain the melatonin signal to a considerable extent during a chronic beta 1-AR blockade.", 
    "64": "Potential benefit or harm of drug therapy in patients with chronic congestive heart failure and those later presenting to hospital after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) have been studied in a number of large-scale survival studies during the last few decades. Currently available data are reviewed in order to consider both methodology and also the clinical relevance of findings with emphasis on trials with ACE-inhibitors like CONSENSUS-II, the ISIS-4, GISSI-3 and Chinese mega-trials, TRACE, SAVE and AIRE. Results of SAVE and AIRE show a clear survival benefit for the patients. Furthermore, the benefit of both trials was in addition to any other benefit which resulted from aspirin, thrombolytic and beta-blocker therapies. In absolute terms, treatment of 1,000 patients with ramipril (AIRE) for 1 year would be expected to result in the prevention/delay of 40 premature deaths. The beneficial effects of ramipril were clearly apparent by 30 days though additional benefit beyond this point was also present. Furthermore, prespecified subgroup analysis revealed significant benefit for patients at risk like women and the elderly. A selective approach is argued for the treatment of patients with ACE-inhibitors after myocardial infarction.",

All compounds dose-dependently inhibited the disappearance rate of propranolol. Nicardipine and isradipine were more potent in inhibiting the disappearance rate of propranolol than the other dihydropyridines and than diltiazem and verapamil. The inhibitory effect of nicardipine on the disappearance rate of propranolol was not stereoselective and was not influenced by age.", 
    "66": "Atrial fibrillation is one of the most common arrhythmias, leading at least in a subset of patients to severe symptoms (palpitations, weakness, syncope), and to hemodynamic impairment especially in the clinical setting of left ventricular dysfunction. Thus, in many cases restauration of sinus rhythm is indicated because of the negative effects of reduced cardiac output. Quinidine has been the first line drug for many years and has been proven to be highly effective especially when combined with Verapamil. But there is growing concern about using quinidine and other class I-anti-arrhythmic agents because of some hints in clinical trials for increased longterm mortality on these drugs. This study was undertaken to test the efficacy of Sotalol, a beta-blocker with additional strong class-III antiarrhythmic action, compared to a fixed combination of Quinidine and Verapamil for conversion of chronic atrial fibrillation and maintenance of sinus rhythm after medical or electrical cardioversion. To avoid early proarrhythmic effects, potassium values in the range of \"high\"-normal values (> 4.3 mval/L) were tried to be obtained. 82 patients were randomly assigned to receive either Sotalol or Quinidine/Verapamil. There was no difference between the groups as far as the underlying heart disease, duration of atrial fibrillation (mean 219 days) and other clinical features including echocardiographic parameters were concerned. The dose of the drug was weight-related individually adjusted, and the drug was continued thereafter. If sinus rhythm could not be established at that time, electric cardioversion was performed and the drug was continued in lower dosage thereafter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "67": "The air pulse noncontact tonometer provides a safe and reliable method for measuring intraocular pressure (IOP), and makes it possible to avoid topical anesthesia. Based on previous reports that suggested possible anesthetic-induced IOP variations, this study was undertaken to investigate with this procedure the influence of local anesthetics on IOP and of some topically used drugs that could modify IOP values. In 212 normal or glaucomatous patients who underwent IOP measurement with a noncontact tonometer, IOP was determined before and in the first minutes following instillation of one of four tested drugs, oxybuprocaine and betoxycaine, two topical anesthetics currently used in applanation tonometry, and indomethacin suspension and metipranolol as controls. No significant effect was observed when comparing IOP values successively measured with the air pulse tonometer or 1 min after instillation of indomethacin suspension and metipranolol. In contrast a significant decrease in IOP was observed 1 and 5 min after instillation of one drop of the local anesthetics oxybuprocaine (mean IOP: 15.53 mm Hg before, 14.77 mm Hg at the 1st minute; p < 0.001) and betoxycaine (16.06 mm Hg before, 15.70 mm Hg at the 1st minute; p = 0.023). This effect was observed at least to the 15th minute, and in some patients, the decrease in IOP reached 8 mm Hg. Metipranolol only decreased IOP significantly at the 15th minute as compared to initial values, which differed from IOP variations following topical anesthesia. This phenomenon could not be related to mechanical effects of repetitive IOP measurements or massage by eyelids secondary to corneal irritation by anesthetic eye drops.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

In glaucomatous subjects there was a statistically significant reduction of the mean systolic peak flow velocity of the ophthalmic artery in comparison with normals. Glaucomatous eyes with uncontrolled IOP and with visual-field worsening showed a statistically significant decrease in the end-diastolic flow velocities and an increase in the resistivity index values in ciliary arteries.",

Disk membranes of photoreceptor outer segments and synaptic terminals display a preferential enrichment in DHA-phospholipids that appears to be necessary for normal excitable membrane functions. Because of the relevance of adequate DHA-phospholipid synthesis and sorting toward new assembled disk membranes and synaptic terminals, as well as the pathophysiological implications of abnormal DHA metabolism (including its synthesis, delivery to the retina, and incorporation into lipids by de novo and turnover pathways), we reviewed recent studies of: a) the preferential uptake and retention of DHA by photoreceptors and its metabolism as it is activated to DHA-CoA and incorporated preferentially into phospholipids; b) pharmacological manipulations using amphiphilic cationic drugs (i.e., propranolol) to show an active esterification of DHA into lipids via de novo synthesis; and c) perturbations in DHA metabolism in retinas from dogs with progressive rod-cone degeneration (prcd).", 
    "70": "Beta-adrenergic binding sites in primary cultures of chick lens annular pad (CLAP) cells were characterized with dihydroalprenolol (DHAP). Binding site affinities and densities were similar to beta-adrenergic receptors (BARs) previously characterized on crude membranes from freshly isolated cells. In competitive displacement studies, the beta-blocker propranolol was shown to increase the number of available binding sites in a concentration dependent manner. Acute exposure of CLAP cells to propranolol prior to DHAP binding also resulted in an increase in the number of available binding sites. Finally, lens beta-adrenergic binding site levels could be modulated by dexamethasone treatment. These results indicate that lens BARs are subject to common regulatory mechanisms and further implicate ophthalmic pharmaceuticals as possible cataractogenic agents.",

Mean intraocular pressures (IOP) were 18.68 +/- 2.84 mmHg at 1 month, 18.81 +/- 2.56 mmHg at 3 months and 18.56 +/- 2.01 mmHg at 6 months. These values were significantly higher than the initial IOP of 17.48 +/- 2.2 mmHg (p values 0.0006, 0.0001 and 0.0004 respectively). However, 1 month following reconversion to initial therapy the IOP was 17.68 +/- 2.67 mmHg, which was not significantly higher than the initial IOP (p = 0.46). In addition, of 8 eyes uncontrolled during the course of the study, 6 became controlled following reconversion to initial treatment. Combination therapy of TP2 b.d. cannot be recommended to control IOP satisfactorily in patients maintained on timolol 0.25% or 0.5% b.d. and pilocarpine 2% q.i.d.",

In 11 patients with hypertension without peripheral arterial obstructive disease and 11 patients with hypertension and claudication we assessed the blood pressure, leg blood flow, vascular resistance, walking distance, transcutaneous oxygen consumption and Laser-Doppler flow after treatment of one month with 10 mg bisoprolol once daily or 20 mg lisinopril once daily. The walking distance of patients with claudication improved in all patients while participating in an exercise program. For both treatment groups this improvement was significant (p < 0.05) compared to baseline, from 264 m at baseline to 313 m with bisoprolol and to 400 m with lisinopril. The difference was not significant between the both drugs. In patients without peripheral vascular obstructive disease we found a significant (p < 0.05) reduction in blood flow for both drugs. The peripheral blood flow parameters of 38 legs showed no statistical significant effect of bisoprolol nor lisinopril on the local vascular resistance at rest, after occlusion or after exercise.",

After 2 weeks of culture, and incubation with medium containing radiolabeled precursors for 48 h, GAGs of the TM were isolated and subjected to SED. Treatment with epinephrine significantly reduced the hyaluronic acid and increased the chondroitin sulfate in radiolabeled precursor incorporation rate (p < 0.001). Other drugs had little effect. Thus, epinephrine appeared to influence the biosynthesis of GAGs of rabbit TM.", 
    "74": "The pattern and timing of a normal breath in unanesthetized mice was analyzed from measurement of inspiratory and expiratory airflows (VI and VE). Airflow was measured via a differential pressure transducer, attached to a pneumotachograph, which itself was attached to a body plethysmograph into which a mouse was placed. The analog voltage from the differential pressure transducer was digitized and stored for analysis on a microcomputer. Criteria were developed to classify each breath as normal (N) or belonging into one of seven abnormal categories. The abnormal categories were arrived at by computer analysis, recognizing specific modifications of the normal pattern into patterns of: sensory irritation of the upper respiratory tract (S), airflow limitation within the conducting airways of the lungs (A) or pulmonary irritation at the alveolar level (P). Combinations of these effects, i.e., S+A, P+A, P+S and P+S+A were also recognized. Computer analysis of each breath also permitted quantitative evaluation of the degree of S, A or P abnormalities. To induce each type of effect we used inhalation exposures to 2-chlorobenzylchloride, carbamylcholine or propranolol. We propose that this approach will permit rapid evaluation of the possible effects of airborne chemicals at three levels of the respiratory tract, with the classification of the type of effect easily obtained in an objective way using well defined criteria, followed by quantitation of the degree of each effect.", 
    "75": "In order to study the segmental difference in the density of autonomic receptors of the vas deferens, we measured the amount of adrenergic alpha 1-, alpha 2- and beta-receptors and muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the three portions (prostatic, intermediate and epididymal) of dog vas deferens using radioligand binding techniques. Saturation experiments with 3H-prazosin, 3H-yohimbine, 3H-dihydroxyalprenolol and 3H-quinuclidinyl benzilate demonstrated that three were significant amounts of adrenergic alpha 1-, alpha 2- and beta-receptors and muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the three portions of dog vas deferens. Of the three portions examined, the prostatic portion was found to have a larger amount of alpha 1-, alpha 2-receptors and muscarinic receptors, while the intermediate portion was found to have a larger amount of beta-receptors. The epididymal portion was found to have a smaller amount of autonomic receptors. These data suggest that the prostatic portion plays a more important role in the function of the dog vas deferens. It is thought that the different segments of the vas deferens have a different functional role according to the distribution of autonomic receptors.",

Myocardial uptake of substrates remains restricted 6 hours postoperatively and cannot match the demand during periods of increased energy requirements. We investigated the relationship between myocardial oxidative rate and substrate uptake in 22 men c. 8 hours after coronary surgery. Myocardial energy demand was raised experimentally by infusing dopamine. The influence of selective beta 1-blockade was analyzed. The uptake of free fatty acids dominated (34.74 +/- 8.83 mmol/min*10(-3) and sufficed to explain the oxygen consumption in basal postoperative conditions (0.468 +/- 0.051 mumol/min) and during amplified energy requirements (0.881 +/- 0.117, r = 0.71). Although the capacity to adjust substrate uptake to energy requirements thus was regained, the uptake of glucose and of lactate (6.14 +/- 13.13 and 2.29 +/- 20.31 mmol/min*10(3) respectively) was marginal, which may be important for ischaemic tolerance. Metoprolol influenced oxygen consumption during amplified adrenergic activity, but did not markedly affect substrates.",

    "78": "The timing of treatment for any condition is dependent on the underlying pathophysiology. One of the issues to consider is whether decreasing the time to intervention can be translated into recognisable benefits. Key data have been generated over the last 10 years which are relevant to the treatment of acute myocardial infarction (MI), including results of the large-scale 'mega-trials' in broad population groups. The therapeutic interventions which will be considered here are beta blockers, aspirin, thrombolytics and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Of these, aspirin seems to be the least time-dependent, provided it is administered within 12-24 h of symptom onset. Mortality benefits associated with beta blocker therapy increase as the time of administration from symptom onset is reduced and the extent to which thrombolytic therapy is beneficial is also clearly time dependent. The results from GISSI-3 and ISIS-4, which recruited a broader patient population than in previous trials, were concordant, showing a significant improvement in survival after five to six weeks' treatment. The message from GISSI-3 was that administration of ACE inhibitors within 24 h of symptom onset will improve survival and left ventricular function provided patients are hemodynamically stable, are not hypotensive and have no renal dysfunction; 76 lives were saved (representing an 11% risk reduction in mortality) after six weeks' lisinopril treatment, 54 of which were saved in the first five days.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

However, badly designed trials can generate impressive results, and good trial data may be interpreted differently by practicing clinicians. One example of the latter is the use of intravenous atenolol in acute myocardial infarction where, despite a large trial clearly demonstrating that immediate therapy is relatively safe in patients with acute myocardial infarction and reduces in-hospital mortality, its routine use remains extremely variable. The reasons for the poor uptake of atenolol in acute myocardial infarction, including anticipated clinical drawbacks, the way the trial data were published, and the marketing of beta blockers, are discussed in this paper.",

    "84": "alpha-Chloralose is a commonly used anesthetic agent in cardiovascular research despite a paucity of information whether it may have important pharmacologic interaction with subsequently given adrenergic drugs. To assess any potential pharmacologic interaction, we studied the cardiovascular response to beta-adrenergic receptor antagonism (propranolol, 1 mg/kg i.v.) after either chloralose (30 mg/kg i.v.) or saline control in paired studies in 10 chronically instrumented neonatal lambs. Chloralose increased heart rate by 46% as compared to control (283 +/- 37 vs. 194 +/- 48 beats/min, p = 0.0002) and had no significant effect on cardiac output; chloralose also increased mean pulmonary arterial pressure by 45% (27 +/- 13 vs. 19 +/- 6 mm Hg, p = 0.050) and pulmonary vascular resistance by 79% (0.211 +/- 0.13 vs. 0.118 +/- 0.04 mm Hg/ml/kg/min, p = 0.050). The group pretreated with chloralose had significantly elevated heart rate (186 +/- 23 vs. 157 +/- 31 beats/min, p = 0.03), mean pulmonary arterial pressure (29 +/- 9 vs. 22 +/- 6 mm Hg, p = 0.03) and pulmonary vascular resistance (0.228 +/- 0.13 vs. 0.130 +/- 0.05 mm Hg/ml/kg/min, p = 0.05) after propranolol as compared to the conscious saline-treated group. We conclude that pretreatment with chloralose as an anesthetic agent may produce important pharmacologic interaction with subsequent adrenergic drugs in neonatal lambs. While anesthesia may be necessary in animal research, investigators should be aware that the anesthetic agent may also qualitatively and quantitatively influence measured outcome variables.", 
    "85": "Functional diversity of voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCC) is primarily due to the existence of six distinct genes of the channel-forming subunit alpha 1, which can be further classified into the L-type and neuronal non-L-type subfamilies. We have examined functional properties of the calcium channel BII expressed from the cloned cDNA, in Xenopus oocytes, and compared the results with the other members of the non-L-type subfamily, the BI and BIII channels. The BII channel is a high voltage-activated calcium channel pharmacologically features by its unique sensitivity to the inorganic blocker Ni2. The decaying component of the BII current shows high sensitivity to Ni2+ similar to that of the low voltage-activated channels and the R-type channel in cerebellar granule cells, whereas the sustained component is relatively resistant to Ni2+ as are the other high voltage-activated calcium channels. Dihydropyridines, omega-CgTx-GVIA, and omega-Aga-IVA, which have been used to discriminate L-, N-, and P-types, do not affect the BII current. The mode of modulation of the BII channel by auxiliary subunits is strikingly different from that observed in the L-type channels. Both activation and inactivation rates of the BII current are decelerated by coexpression of the beta subunit, and this effect is cancelled by further coexpression of the alpha 2 subunit. In situ tissue distribution studies indicate a higher level of BII mRNA expression in the hippocamus compared to other brain regions, revealing important difference in the relative abundance of BI, BII, and BIII channels in brain tissues. Overall, the results suggest that the BII channel forms a novel functional category of VDCC that is different from T-, L-, N-, and P-type.",

As the beta-adrenoceptor in tilapia erythrocytes has never been investigated, we characterized beta-adrenoceptors in intact red blood cells of a tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) in this study by radioligand binding assay with a hydrophobic beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, 1-[4,6-propyl-3H]dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA), and a hydrophilic ligand (-)-4-(3-t-butylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy)-[5,7-3H] benzimidazol-2-one ([3H]CGP-12177). The equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) for [3H]CGP-12177 calculated from kinetic experiments (KD = 5.8 +/- 4.8 nM) was comparable to that obtained from Scatchard analysis (KD = 1.22 +/- 0.18 nM). However, the KD for [3H]DHA obtained from kinetic studies (KD = 0.41 +/- 0.12 nM) was much smaller than that from a Scatchard plot (KD = 7.8 +/- 1.6 nM). The hydrophobic [3H]DHA bound to two sites (KD = 7.8 nM, Bmax = 12,500 sites/cell and KD = 77.4 nM, Bmax = 70,550 sites/cell), whereas the hydrophilic [3H]CGP-12177 bound to one site (KD = 1.2 nM, Bmax = 1,900 sites/cell). The results indicate that high-affinity beta-adrenoceptors are located both on the surface of and inside tilapia erythrocytes, and low-affinity receptors exist only inside erythrocytes.", 
    "88": "Resistance arteries may play a critical role in hypertension, and correcting their structural abnormalities may improve the clinical outcome of hypertensive patients. There have been several studies of the effects of antihypertensive treatment on the structure of resistance vessels in hypertension. These studies have yielded inconclusive results regarding the ability of individual drugs to induce regression of the changes occurring in blood vessels in hypertension, both in experimental models and in humans. This article reviews the results of studies of antihypertensive treatment on resistance vessel structure and function, and in particular those of a recent study in which the effects of treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril and the beta-blocker atenolol on the structure and function of subcutaneous resistance arteries were evaluated in a double-blind randomized trial in patients with mild essential hypertension. In this study, patients were randomly assigned to receive either cilazapril or atenolol, and blood pressure was effectively controlled for 1 year. Treatment for 1 year with cilazapril resulted in a significant reduction in the media-to-lumen ratio of resistance arteries dissected from subcutaneous gluteal fat biopsy samples, although the ratio was still slightly but significantly larger than that of resistance arteries of normotensive controls. In arteries from patients treated with atenolol there was no significant change in media-to-lumen ratio with treatment. Contractile responses to several vasoconstrictors, particularly endothelin-1, which were blunted in hypertensive patients, were normalized in the cilazapril-treated patients, but were unchanged in those taking atenolol. These results suggest that in humans it is possible to correct in part the vascular remodeling present in hypertension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

An \"in vitro\" experimental model measuring the frequency of contraction, the production of cAMP and binding assay on neonatal and adult rat atria was employed. Sera and IgG fraction from mothers of infants with congenital heart block (CHB) interact with neonatal rat atria increasing the frequency of contraction and cAMP production. These effects were abolished by propranolol, pointing to a beta adrenergic participation. IgG also competed with 3H-CGP to beta adrenergic receptors on neonatal cardiac membranes. Neither the contractile nor the cAMP effects or binding assay were obtained using adult instead of neonatal rat atria. Reactivity against cardiac neurotransmitter receptors may be another serum factor(s) to be considered in the pathophysiology of the development of CHB.",

The investigations were performed in 26 patients suffering from long QT duration (QTC-frequency adapted QT-:484 +/- 34 ms) with permanent, marked bradycardia (heart rate: 42 +/- 7 min-1). Adams Stokes syncopal attack appeared in 12 patients, while in 14 cases ventricular tachycardia attack with syncope could be observed (study group). As control served the data of 30 patients suffering from long lasting marked bradycardia (heart rate: 44 +/- 7 min-1) with normal QT (QTC:420 +/- 28 ms). Each patient was candidate for pacemaker implantation. The following questions were studied: 1. The effect of heart rate on QT duration. The experiments were performed by electrical ventricular stimulation. 2. The effect of sympathetic and parasympathetic-pharmacologic-blockade on QT time. The study was performed under electrical ventricular stimulation by administration of propranolol and atropine. 3. The dispersion of QT time was studied by using electrical heart stimulation and 12 lead ECG recording. Electrophysiological investigations were performed in 14 patients with long QT and permanent bradycardia. On augmentation of the cycle length (bradycardia) the increase in the QT duration was more-out of all proportion-expressed in long QT. On pharmacologic sympathetic blockade in long QT syndrome the QT duration significantly diminished. The QT dispersion was more expressed in patients with prolonged QT interval and on bradycardia the QT dispersion further increased significantly. The irritability of the ventricle was markedly augmented in patients with long QT and bradycardia.

Slow-release (SR) nifedipine was used for comparison. The type and incidence of adverse events seen with both drugs are characteristic of the dihydropyridine class of drugs and were mainly due to pharmacologically induced vasodilation, but lacidipine caused a significantly lower incidence of ankle edema than nifedipine SR. There were no unexpected adverse events during the treatment. The addition of atenolol 50 mg once daily did not increase the frequency of adverse events. Therefore, lacidipine can be considered a safe antihypertensive drug, which can be used as a suitable agent for first-line treatment of hypertension.",

Vegetative cardiac regulation was determined using mathematical analysis of at least 100 successive intervals R-R at rest before and after therapy (120 mg day of propranolol hydrochloride). The authors estimated characteristics of the variance analysis and two secondary values--stress index and centralization index calculated by spectral characteristics of the rhythm.

    "98": "Chronic liver disease is well known to be associated with pulmonary abnormalities. Hypoxemia, clubbing, cyanosis and hyperventilation are common. The hypoxemia in cirrhotic patients has several causes: diffuse shunts due to intrapulmonary arteriolar vasodilatation, impaired hypoxic vasoconstriction, impaired matching of ventilation to perfusion, pleural effusions and diaphragmatic dysfunction. Because of gravity, shifting of blood to the dilated precapillary beds of the lung bases results in an increased hypoxemic dyspnea when the patient is in the upright position, also known as orthodeoxia and platypnea. It has only been described in 5% of the cirrhotic patients and has not been described in a Belgian refereed journal (Medline literature search 1983-Aug 1993). It should be considered in the initial differential diagnosis of hypoxemia in patients with liver cirrhosis and dyspnea. Measuring arterial blood gases in the lying and upright position can prevent further invasive investigations, and whole body nuclide scan with technetium-99m macroaggregated albumin can confirm the diagnosis. Standard therapy with spironolactone (Aldactone) can worsen the condition and we found no additional benefit of beta-antagonists (propranolol/Inderal) in the reduction of the shunt fraction, probably because the main reason for the shunting is precapillary vasodilatation. Since there are no anatomical porto-pulmonary shunts, surgery is also inappropriate. The only therapy consists of oxygen supplements and low dose diuretics in patients with edema.",

Rats were fed semisynthetic diets, deriving 40% of total calories from fat. The control diet, which had sufficient linoleic acid to prevent essential fatty acid deficiency, had a polyunsaturated/saturated fatty acid (P/S) ratio of 0.3. The n-3 PUFA were given as a daily oral supplement of fish oil. For the n-6 PUFA diet, the proportion of linoleic acid in the diet was increased to obtain P/S ratio of 2.0. Diets were administered for 8 weeks. At the end of the feeding period, second-order branches of the femoral artery (< 300-micros diameter) were mounted in pairs in an isometric myograph, and responses to norepinephrine (NE) 3 nM-10 microM with addition of yohimbine 1 microM and timolol 1 microM were examined. Subsequently, the vessels were preconstricted with NE to 60% of their maximal response and relaxation to acetylcholine 1 nM-0.1 mM was observed. Dietary n-3 PUFA supplements led to attenuation of the contractile responses of isolated resistance arteries (p < 0.01, repeated-measures analysis of variance, ANOVA-RM) versus control. The n-6 PUFA diet did not exert this effect although there was a downward trend. Diet did not affect EC50 values for NE. Neither n-3 nor n-6 PUFA diet influenced relaxation responses.

A control group (n = 10) was compared with a stenosis group (n = 9) in which the mean coronary perfusion pressure was reduced (91 +/- 4 g vs. 136 +/- 5 mm Hg, p < 0.01). End-systolic pressure-length (ESP-ESL) relations during dynamic afterload increase and preload reduction were calculated to evaluate regional inotropy. HR and LV peak systolic blood pressure (LVSP) decreased in both groups after beta-blockade (p < 0.05). Subendocardial and mid-myocardial blood flow measured by radiolabeled microspheres decreased in the control group (p < 0.05) but was unchanged in the stenosis group. Systolic shortening of circumferential segments also decreased in the control group (p < 0.05) but was unchanged in the stenosis group. ESP-ESL relations of circumferential segments shifted markedly rightward in the control group, whereas a modest rightward shift was noted in the stenosis group. This study in feline heart with acute LCX occlusion showed an attenuated negative inotropic effect of beta-blockade in underperfused LV anterior wall.", 
    "101": "We studied myocardial disposition of metoprolol after a 4-mg intravenous (i.v.) bolus in 12 patients undergoing cardiac catheterization for investigation of chest pain, using a paired transcoronary sampling technique with simultaneous determination of coronary sinus blood flow (CSF). Myocardial metoprolol content (MMC) was then correlated with concomitant effects on hemodynamic and ECG parameters. Peak myocardial metoprolol content (1.89 +/- 0.40% of injected dose) was attained rapidly (2.67 +/- 0.38 min), but time to peak content was significantly delayed in the presence of extensive coronary artery disease. Residual MMC 17.5 min after injection was 49.1 +/- 8.7% of maximal MMC. Extent of coronary artery disease or variability in left ventricular (LV) systolic function did not influence peak MMC. Metoprolol induced slowing of spontaneous heart rate (HR, p < 0.05), reduction in LV +dP/dt (p < 0.0005), and prolongation of PR intervals (p < 0.05) with maximal changes 5-10 min after injection. Thus, time of peak hemodynamic effects of metoprolol was consistently delayed relative to time of peak MMC. We conclude that after i.v. injection, myocardial metoprolol accumulation in humans is rapid, with marked hysteresis between peak MMC and subsequent hemodynamic effects.", 
    "102": "Voltage-clamp experiments were performed on isolated guinea pig ventricular myocytes to examine the voltage dependence of delayed rectifier block by methanesulfonamide channel blockers. Voltage-dependent channel block, in which block decreases as membrane potential is made more positive, could contribute to the phenomenon of reverse use dependence, in which the magnitude of the drug-induced prolongation in action potential duration (APD) is inversely proportional to stimulation rate. To determine whether such a voltage dependence exists, concentration-response curves were generated for dofetilide, E-4031, sematilide, and D,L-sotalol at test potentials ranging from 0 to 60 mV. All agents blocked current in a manner consistent with selective blockade of the rapidly activating component of delayed rectifier current, IKr. The rank order of potency was E-4031 approximately dofetilide > sematilide > sotalol. Block of tail currents by this class of compounds was more potent after test potentials to +60 mV than after those < or = 0-10 mV. These data are inconsistent with voltage-dependent channel block being a contributing factor to reverse use-dependence and suggest that other mechanisms must be responsible for this phenomenon.", 
    "103": "The cardiovascular actions of combined intravenous (i.v.) diltiazem and propranolol were studied in barbiturate-anesthetized dogs. When given alone, diltiazem increased cardiac output (CO) and P-R interval duration (P-R) while decreasing mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and systemic vascular resistance (SVR). Propranolol alone decreased CO and HR while increasing SVR. With the same i.v. doses, combined infusion of diltiazem and propranolol rapidly resulted in depression of CO to levels similar to those achieved with propranolol beta-adrenoceptor blockade alone. The combination decreased MAP to levels achieved with diltiazem-induced calcium channel blockade. P-R increased beyond the durations produced by either drug given alone. Pharmacokinetic interactions were not apparent, although slight increases in propranolol plasma concentrations were observed during combined drug infusions. These studies support clinical observations that the cardiovascular effects resulting from a combination of diltiazem and propranolol may be attributed to the characteristic cardiovascular actions of each individual drug."
