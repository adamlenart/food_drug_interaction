Chagas disease (CD) caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi remains a major cause of HF in Latin America. We assessed whether the plasma concentration of the third natriuretic peptide, C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), also has diagnostic and prognostic properties in patients with CD or other dilated cardiomyopathies (DCM). Blood samples were obtained from 66 patients with CD, 50 patients with DCM from other causes, and 30 gender- and age-matched healthy subjects. Patients were subdivided according to the New York Heart Association (NYHA) class. The CNP concentration was determined by radioimmunoassay (Immundiagnostik, Bensheim, Germany). The main duration of follow-up was 31.4 months (range 13 to 54 months); 19 patients had died and 11 patients received a heart transplant. CNP concentrations were only significantly altered in patients with DCM or CD of the NYHA classes III and IV (P < 0.05). The Pearson correlation of echocardiographic data with CNP revealed an association only with the left-ventricular end systolic volume (P = 0.03) in patients with DCM. Furthermore, CNP did not predict mortality or the necessity for heart transplant. Our data are the first to demonstrate the raised levels of the third natriuretic peptide CNP in CD and other DCM. Whereas ANP and BNP have a high predictive value for mortality in both diseases, CNP is without any predictive potency.",

    "3": "In multivariable analysis, renal dysfunction was independently associated with significant increased risks for all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.86; 95% CI 1.13-3.05) and SCD (HR = 2.00; 95% CI 1.01-4.02), but not non-SCD, compared to patients without renal dysfunction. Independent predictors of SCD in patients with renal dysfunction were: increased resting heart rate (HR = 2.40; 95% CI 1.50-3.86); low diastolic blood pressure (HR = 3.23; 95% CI 1.52-6.66), and a prolonged QRS duration (HR = 1.63; 95% CI 1.02-2.61). Beta-blocker therapy was independently associated with a significant reduction in the risk of SCD in patients with an eGFR of <75 ml/min/1.73 m2 (HR = 0.61; 95% CI 0.38-0.99).",

Beta-adrenergic blockers along with calcium channel blockers and anxiolytics are widely used to treat symptoms associated with MVPS despite a lack of evidence that supports their efficacy. This study examined the relationship between prescribed medication use and frequency and intensity of MVPS symptoms. A descriptive cross-sectional survey design was used. Descriptive statistics and Cram\u00e9r's V correlational analysis were used to answer the research questions. Self-completed questionnaires were mailed to 2,282 MVPS individuals older than 21 years of age throughout the United States and Canada previously diagnosed with MVPS. Of the 837 participants, 337 (40%) were taking one or more medications. Although there were significant positive correlations between anxiety and calcium channel blockers, chest pain and digoxin, and mood swings and digoxin, the correlations were very weak.",

We describe here a new, simple, rapid and selective development of this technique. The phosphorescence signals derive from the interaction of pindolol with a relatively high concentration of heavy-atom salts in the presence of sodium sulphite as oxygen scavenger. Phosphorescence was registered in the presence of 1.2 M potassium iodide, 15 mM sodium sulphite and 30% v/v methanol at 450 nm, exciting at 285 nm. The detection limit was 21.1 ng mL(-1). The method has been successfully applied to the determination of pindolol in commercial pharmaceutical tablets, urine and blood serum.", 
    "12": "The coupling of sequential injection analysis and optosensing has been developed for the first time. It has been applied to the determination of labetalol in both pharmaceuticals and urine samples, with the analytical signal (native fluorescence) being monitored directly on sensing zone microbeads. The solid support used was the nonionic silica gel C18, using 20% methanol-water (v:v) as a carrier. By using a 1.5-ml sample volume, we achieved a detection limit of 3.3 ng ml-1. This sensitivity allowed the determination of the compound in urine samples. A recovery study was carried out at the labetalol levels usually found in urine after pharmaceuticals administration, and recovery percentages close to 100% were obtained. The relative standard deviation was 3.4% for 100 ng ml-1 labetalol. No pretreatment was needed for urine samples, only an appropriate dilution, therefore minimizing the time required per sample analysis. In addition, the determination of the analyte was also carried out in one pharmaceutical, with a satisfactory result being obtained.", 
    "13": "Acute hemorrhage results in hyperglycemia regulated in a redundant manner by adrenal catecholamines and hepatic sympathetic nerves. In addition, insulin secretion is suppressed and insulin resistance is accounted for completely by elimination of the hepatic insulin-sensitizing substance (HISS) component of insulin action. Blockade of HISS action secondary to blood loss leads to a state known as HISS-dependent insulin resistance (HDIR) which results in a decrease in the glucose disposal action of insulin by 33 +/- 3%.", 
    "14": "This paper describes nine studies that have explored the neuroendocrine control of HDIR that is produced in response to the stress of blood loss. The rapid insulin sensitivity test (RIST), a transient euglycemic clamp, was used to measure insulin sensitivity. To test the role of the adrenergic system, alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists, phentolamine and propranolol, were tested for the ability to block HDIR produced by hemorrhage.", 
    "15": "Neither intervention was effective (32 +/- 6 and 36 +/- 3%, respectively). Exogenous somatostatin was shown to produce HDIR that could be blocked by the somatostatin receptor antagonist, cyclosomatostatin. Cyclosomatostatin completely blocked the development of HDIR that occurred following hemorrhage (RIST index 214 +/- 9 control, 218 +/- 9 mg glucose/kg body weight after cyclosomatostatin plus hemorrhage).", 
    "16": "The adrenergic system is not involved in producing HDIR in response to hemorrhage. Somatostatin appears to be the hormonal regulator of this response and it is suggested that the somatostatin derives from a neural origin within the liver.", 
    "17": "Extensive evidence indicates that the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) mediates hormonal and neurotransmitter effects on the consolidation of emotionally influenced memory and that such modulatory influences involve noradrenergic activation of the BLA. As the BLA also expresses a high density of receptors for orphanin FQ/nociceptin (OFQ/N), an opioid-like peptide with anxiolytic and amnestic properties, the present experiments investigated whether the BLA is involved in mediating OFQ/N effects on memory consolidation and whether such effects require noradrenergic activity. OFQ/N (0.01-100 pmol in 0.2 microL) administered bilaterally into the BLA of male Sprague-Dawley rats immediately after aversively motivated inhibitory avoidance training induced dose-dependent impairment on a 48-h retention trial. The beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol (2.0 nmol) administered concurrently into the BLA potentiated the dose-response effects of OFQ/N. In contrast, immediate post-training infusions of the peptidergic OFQ/N receptor antagonist [Nphe(1)]nociceptin(1-13)NH(2) (1-100 pmol in 0.2 microL) into the BLA enhanced 48-h retention of inhibitory avoidance training, an effect that was blocked by coadministration of atenolol. Delayed infusions of OFQ/N or [Nphe(1)]nociceptin(1-13)NH(2) into the BLA administered either 6 or 3 h after training, respectively, or immediate post-training infusions of OFQ/N into the adjacent central amygdala did not significantly alter retention performance. These findings indicate that endogenously released OFQ/N interacts with noradrenergic activity within the BLA in modulating memory consolidation.", 
    "18": "1. Divergent evidence suggests that the intracellular signalling pathways for beta-adrenoceptor-mediated vascular relaxation involves either cAMP/protein kinase (PK) A or endothelial nitric oxide (NO) release and subsequent activation of cGMP/PKG. The present study identifies the relative roles of NO and cAMP, as well as dependence on the endothelium for beta-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxation of rat isolated aortas. 2. Cumulative concentration-response curves to isoprenaline (0.01-3 micromol/L) in phenylephrine (0.1 micromol/L)-preconstricted endothelium-intact and -denuded aortas were constructed. Isoprenaline-mediated relaxation was partially reduced by endothelium removal and the presence of the NO synthase inhibitor N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (0.1 mmol/L), but not by the cAMP antagonist (Rp)-cyclic adenosine-3',5'-monophosphorothioate (Rp-cAMPS; 0.5 mmol/L). 3. In contrast, in endothelium-denuded aortas, the isoprenaline-mediated relaxation was inhibited by Rp-cAMPS and this inhibition was lost in the presence of the NO donor sodium nitroprusside (1 nmol/L). This effect was not due to phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity because the non-selective PDE inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (1 micromol/L) failed to affect the isoprenaline vasorelaxant response. 4. The K(+) channel blocker tetraethylammonium (TEA; 1 mmol/L) attenuated isoprenaline-induced relaxation in endothelium-denuded aorta, but its effect was non-additive with Rp-cAMPS, suggesting that the K(+) channel component may involve cAMP. In endothelium-intact aortas, TEA but not Rp-cAMPS reduced isoprenaline relaxation, suggesting an additional non-cAMP component. 5. These findings suggest that beta-adrenoceptors induce vascular smooth muscle relaxation by acting through the NO-cGMP pathway and, when that is disrupted by endothelium removal or the presence of an NO synthase inhibitor, the cAMP pathway in smooth muscles is used. The lack of cAMP participation in endothelium-intact vessels may be because NO suppresses or overrides the cAMP effect.", 
    "19": "1. The aim of the present study was to clarify the effects of landiolol, a short-acting selective beta(1)-adrenoceptor blocking agent, on mechanical and metabolic changes in postischaemic perfused hearts. 2. Rat isolated hearts (n = 30) were randomly separated into non-ischaemic or ischaemic groups. The latter group was further divided into Krebs'-Henseleit solution (KHS)- and landiolol (30, 100 or 300 micromol/L)-treated groups. Ischaemic hearts were subjected to 25 min global ischaemia and 20 min reperfusion under atrial pacing. Time-course changes in left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), LV developed pressure (LVDP), peak positive velocity of change of LV pressure (LVdP/dt(max)) and coronary flow were observed along with tissue contents of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), creatine phosphate, inorganic phosphate (Pi), malondialdehyde (MDA) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release in coronary effluent. The effects of landiolol on rat isolated aortic preparations under KCl contraction were also investigated. 3. Ischaemia-reperfusion significantly impaired cardiodynamics, such as LVEDP, LVDP and LVdP/dt(max), decreased myocardial ATP content and increased Pi and LDH release. In the 30 micromol/L landiolol-treated group, cardiovascular parameters impaired by ischaemia-reperfusion and increased LDH release were further exacerbated and myocardial MDA content was significantly increased. In the 300 micromol/L landiolol-treated group, cardiac contractile dysfunction was improved and myocardial MDA, ATP and Pi contents were preserved. All measurements in the 100 micromol/L landiolol-treated group were similar to those in the ischaemic KHS group. Furthermore, significant relaxations of isolated aortic preparations were obtained with landiolol 30-1000 micromol/L, suggesting a possible calcium antagonism with landiolol. 4. In conclusion, landiolol, at low concentrations, aggravated myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injuries, whereas at high concentrations it ameliorated them. The former effect may be mediated by the production of reactive oxygen species, whereas the latter may involve calcium antagonist activity.", 
    "20": "Beta-adrenoceptor blockers belong to the most successful drug classes of medicine. Mainly they are used in internal medicine. 40 years ago beta-adrenoceptor blockers have occasionally been used in psychiatry for the treatment of anxiety disorders. Over the past four decades, the effects of beta-adrenoceptor blockers in the treatment of schizophrenic and manic psychoses, withdrawal syndromes and aggressive behaviour with temper outbursts has been investigated. Beta-adrenoceptor blockers are also used in the treatment of side-effects of psychopharmacological agents like neuroleptic or antidepressant-induced tachycardias, lithium-induced tremor, antipsychotic-induced akathisia or tardive dyskinesia as well. Since the mid-nineties it has been attempted to improve the efficacy of antidepressant agents by means of the 5-HT-(1a)-receptorantagonist pindolol. Presumedly memory consolidation of traumatic events can be enhanced by adrenergic activation. Therefore some open clinical trials investigated the effects of propranolol, a lipid soluble drug, which crosses the blood-brain barrier easily, to reduce the manifestation of PTSD. The present review presents the results of the literature with respect to the indications for beta-blockers in psychiatry. Considering evidence-based-medicine criteria beta-blockers are indicated to treat lithium-induced tremor, antipsychotic-induced akathisia and to reduce aggressive behavior of patients with brain-injuries.", 
    "21": "Antagonists of beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-ARs) have become a main therapeutic regimen for the treatment of heart failure even though the mechanisms of their beneficial effects are still poorly understood. Here, we used fluorescent resonance energy transfer-based (FRET-based) approaches to directly monitor activation of the beta(1)-AR and downstream signaling. While the commonly used beta-AR antagonists metoprolol, bisoprolol, and carvedilol displayed varying degrees of inverse agonism on the Gly389 variant of the receptor (i.e., actively switching off the beta(1)-AR), surprisingly, only carvedilol showed very specific and marked inverse agonist effects on the more frequent Arg389 variant. These specific effects of carvedilol on the Arg389 variant of the beta(1)-AR were also seen for control of beating frequency in rat cardiac myocytes expressing the 2 receptor variants. This FRET sensor permitted direct observation of activation of the beta(1)-AR in living cells in real time. It revealed that beta(1)-AR variants dramatically differ in their responses to diverse beta blockers, with possible consequences for their clinical use.", 
    "22": "Drugs known as beta blockers, which antagonize the beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR), are an important component of the treatment regimen for chronic heart failure (HF). However, a significant body of evidence indicates that genetic heterogeneity at the level of the beta(1)-AR may be a factor in explaining the variable responses of HF patients to beta blockade. In this issue of the JCI, Rochais et al. describe how a single amino acid change in beta(1)-AR alters its structural conformation and improves its functional response to carvedilol, a beta blocker currently used in the treatment of HF (see the related article beginning on page 229). This may explain why some HF patients have better responses not only to carvedilol but to certain other beta blockers as well. The data greatly enhance our mechanistic understanding of myocardial adrenergic signaling and support the development of \"tailored\" or \"personalized\" medicine, in which specific therapies could be prescribed based on a patient's genotype.",

In isolated smooth muscle tissues taken from rats, rabbits and guinea-pigs, all at 37.5 degrees C, the equilibrium dissociation constant (K(beta)) of the competitive, reversible alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine varied between 4 and 28 nm. 2. The concentration of the antagonist required to inhibit contractions to direct- or indirect-acting alpha-adrenenoceptor agonists by 50% (IC50) also varied between 5 and 30 nm. 3. From one tissue to another, the IC50/K(beta) ratio of the blocker varied from 1 to 2.5, the values being close to those predicted by classical receptor theory based on the law of mass action. 4. At 27.5 degrees C, using phenylephrine as the spasmogen in rat aorta, the IC50/K(beta) ratio for phentolamine was 3.1. 5.

As ACE inhibitors are only partially effective in blocking the formation of Ang II, additional treatment with selective Ang II receptor blockers (ARBs) promise additional benefits in patients with HF. This hypothesis is currently being evaluated in Val-HeFT, a large-scale, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study on the effects of adding the highly selective ARB valsartan to usual therapy (diuretics, digoxin, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors) for HF treatment.",

Clinical trials often do not reflect community practice where patients are older and have more co-morbid conditions. Therapeutic agents need to be at least neutral in their effects on these other conditions. Current therapy in heart failure includes angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers and diuretics, with advanced heart failure patients receiving spironolactone and possibly digitalis. Ongoing clinical trials are testing more effective inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) with highly selective angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor blockers (ARBs) such as valsartan. Future trials should study diverse racial groups and the elderly, particularly those with preserved systolic function.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine whether or not the low antioxidant enzyme activity observed in mononuclear cells of hypertensive subjects is in part dependent on a defective activity of antioxidant mechanisms. Activity and mRNA level of antioxidant enzymes, CuZn- and Mn-superoxide dismutases, catalase, glutathione peroxidase type 1, and glutathione reductase were simultaneously measured in mononuclear cells of controls (n = 38) and hypertensive subjects (n = 35), in the absence of and during antihypertensive treatment. An increase in oxidative stress and a decrease in the activity of cytoplasmic enzymes were observed in untreated hypertensive patients. Concurrently, CuZn-superoxide dismutase and glutathione reductase mRNA levels were significantly reduced, and glutathione peroxidase type 1 mRNA was slightly reduced. In contrast, increased activity and mRNA levels of the mitochondrial Mn-superoxide dismutase were observed. Antihypertensive treatment, nonpharmacologic with or without a drug regimen of beta-blocker or angiotensin AT1 receptor blocker was administered for a 3-month period. Afterward, after the improvement in oxidative stress during treatment, a recovery of the cytoplasmic antioxidant enzymatic activity and a more profound decrease in mRNA levels were observed for CuZn-superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase type 1, and glutathione reductase. Meanwhile mitochondrial enzymatic activity decreased, as did the mRNA level. The inadequate response of the main cytoplasmatic antioxidant systems, as well as of the enzymes participating in the maintenance of glutathione levels, may contribute to the vulnerability of hypertensives to oxidative stress.", 
    "35": "The effects of bergamot essential oil (BEO) on the release of amino acid neurotransmitters in rat hippocampus have been studied by in vivo microdialysis and by in vitro superfusion of isolated nerve terminals. Intraperitoneal administration of BEO (100microl/kg) significantly elevated the extracellular concentration of aspartate, glycine and taurine in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. A dose-relation study generated a bell-shaped curve. When perfused into the hippocampus via the dialysis probe (20microl/20min), BEO produced a significant increase of extracellular aspartate, glycine, taurine as well as of GABA and glutamate. The augmentation of all amino acids was Ca(2+)-independent. Focally injected 1:1 diluted BEO preferentially caused extracellular increase of glutamate. Interestingly, this release appeared to be strictly Ca(2+)-dependent. BEO concentration-dependently enhanced the release of [(3)H]D-aspartate from superfused hippocampal synaptosomes. Similar results were obtained by monitoring the BEO-evoked release of endogenous glutamate. At relatively high concentrations, the BEO-induced [(3)H]d-aspartate release was almost entirely prevented by the glutamate transporter blocker dl-threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartic acid (DL-TBOA) and was Ca(2+)-independent. At relatively low concentrations the release of [(3)H]D-aspartate was only in part ( approximately 50%) DL-TBOA-sensitive and Ca(2+)-independent; the remaining portion of release was dependent on extracellular Ca(2+). Interestingly, the monoterpene hydrocarbon-free fraction of the essential oil appeared to be inactive while the bergapten-free fraction superimposed the releasing effect of BEO supporting the deduction that psoralens may not be implicated. To conclude, BEO contains into its volatile fraction still unidentified monoterpene hydrocarbons able to stimulate glutamate release by transporter reversal and/or by exocytosis, depending on the dose administered.", 
    "36": "Androgen-independent prostate cancer cells DU-145 express a number of G protein-coupled receptors, including histamine H1 receptors. There is evidence for the presence of beta-adrenoceptors in the human prostate, and in this work we set out to characterise the expression of beta-adrenoceptors by DU-145 cells, their linking to cyclic AMP (cAMP) formation and the possible modulation by histamine H1 receptors of beta-adrenoceptor function. Saturation [3H]-dihydroalprenolol binding indicated that DU-145 cells express moderate levels of beta-adrenoceptors (22.7+/-2.5 fmol/mg protein), which belong to the beta2-subtype as assessed by inhibition by the antagonists ICI-118,551 and CGP-20712A. Inhibition of [3H]-dihydroalprenolol binding by agonists (noradrenaline, adrenaline and isoproterenol) showed the presence of both high-(53-59%) and low-affinity binding sites. beta-Adrenoceptor stimulation with isoproterenol resulted in robust [3H]-cAMP accumulation (10-30-fold of basal, EC50 142 nM; pEC50 6.85+/-0.05). While not having effect of its own on basal [3H]-cAMP accumulation, histamine significantly augmented the beta2-adrenoceptor-induced response (overall effect 152+/-6% of isoproterenol alone) with EC50 1.35 microM (pEC50 5.87+/-0.06). This effect was independent of extracellular Ca2+, insensitive to antagonists/agonists at H1, H2 or H3/H4 receptors and mimicked by drugs containing an imidazole ring in their chemical structure and by imidazole itself. Taken together, our results show that in DU-145 cells histamine augments beta2-adrenoceptor-induced cAMP independently of the activation of known histamine receptors. The effect may involve other mechanisms such as allosteric modulation of beta2-adrenoceptors by the imidazole moiety of histamine.",

ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and CCBs are recommended for use in patients after myocardial infarction (MI).

In patients receiving the quadruple combination, the overall mortality risk is 75% lower than for patients receiving none of these four therapies. According to the data from the PREVENIR III study, the combination of a statin and a platelet inhibitor reduces the risk of recurrent coronary events by 71%, the risk of recurrent vascular events by 65% and the risk of death from all causes taken together by 68%, when compared with the absence of these two medications. In the French USIC 2000 survey, prescription of the triple combination of platelet inhibitor, statin and beta-blocker is also associated with a 50% reduction in overall mortality. However, although the B.A.S.I.C. strategy is of major therapeutic value, it markedly increases the number of tablets to be taken every day. Treatment compliance, which is a predictive factor for overall mortality in diabetic coronary patients, diminishes markedly as the number of medications to be taken every day increases.

This can be achieved by a variety of approaches including coronary revascularisation, life-style modifications and drug therapies including several drug classes: platelet inhibitors, beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, statins and anti-anginal drugs. The B.A.S.I.C. regimen is a combination of a beta-blocker, a platelet inhibitor, a statin and an ACE inhibitor for secondary prevention in coronary patients. Although recommended in the latest ESC and AHA/ACC guidelines, this strategy is insufficiently applied in medical practice. Indeed, the results of the European Action on Secondary Prevention by Intervention to Reduce Events (EUROASPIRE) Survey conducted over the period 1999-2000, show that 6 months after a first hospitalisation for aorto-coronary bypass, percutaneous coronary angioplasty, myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome, 86% of patients are prescribed a platelet inhibitor, 63% a beta-blocker, 61% a hypolipidaemic agent and only 38%, an ACE inhibitor. The PREVENIR Study published in 2005 reported that only 12% of patients are prescribed the B.A.S.I.C. quadritherapy outside the acute phase. Despite recognised benefits in terms of survival, the B.A.S.I.C. approach is therefore clearly under-prescribed following coronary events.",

It affects 3-4% of the population in our geographical setting and extrinsic allergens are detected as the disease's etiological agent in around half of these cases. IgE is one of the molecules involved in the allergic process. Most of the time and resources at asthma units are devoted to corticosteroid-dependent patients. International guidelines for asthma treatment recommend a stepwise therapeutic approach; in the last step, the use of oral corticosteroids is advised when control is not achieved with long-acting beta-2-agonists and high doses of inhaled corticosteroids. No alternatives or complements to oral corticosteroids had been proposed until November 2006, when the latest GINA update included the IgE blocker omalizumab in the last step of asthma treatment. In this paper we discuss the pathogenesis of the allergic reaction and the key importance of IgE in this process in order to highlight the beneficial effects of a drug able to block the circulation of the free form of this immunoglobulin. We also review the most important studies and patents for the efficacy and effectiveness of the drug in the treatment of adults and pediatric patients with asthma and other diseases.",

Novel antimalarial drug targets are urgently needed to reduce global morbidity and mortality. Our prior results suggested that inhibiting erythrocyte Gs signaling blocked invasion by the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum.", 
    "54": "We investigated the erythrocyte guanine nucleotide regulatory protein Gs as a novel antimalarial target. Erythrocyte \"ghosts\" loaded with a Gs peptide designed to block Gs interaction with its receptors, were blocked in beta-adrenergic agonist-induced signaling. This finding directly demonstrates that erythrocyte Gs is functional and that propranolol, an antagonist of G protein-coupled beta-adrenergic receptors, dampens Gs activity in erythrocytes. We subsequently used the ghost system to directly link inhibition of host Gs to parasite entry. In addition, we discovered that ghosts loaded with the peptide were inhibited in intracellular parasite maturation. Propranolol also inhibited blood-stage parasite growth, as did other beta2-antagonists. beta-blocker growth inhibition appeared to be due to delay in the terminal schizont stage. When used in combination with existing antimalarials in cell culture, propranolol reduced the 50% and 90% inhibitory concentrations for existing drugs against P. falciparum by 5- to 10-fold and was also effective in reducing drug dose in animal models of infection.",

The coronary artery disease in diabetes has specificities and, in particular, more extensive atherosclerosis. Diabetic patients are also more frequently asymptomatic. Due to the extreme complexity of ischemic vascular disease in patients with diabetes, an optimal therapeutic strategy is based on the correction of elevated blood glucose and lipid levels, of blood pressure, of platelet and coagulation abnormalities. Diabetic patients benefit from secondary prevention by drug therapy(aspirin, lipid lowering with statines, beta blocker and ACE inhibitors) to the same extent as, or more than, non-diabetic patients. Both percutaneous and surgical myocardial revascularization have been proved equally effective for CAD treatment in diabetes. A recent randomized trial has shown a significantly improved outcome after surgical revascularization. But, the effects of drug-eluting stents, which dramatically decrease the incidence of re-stenosis, seem promising.",

Acrylamide was grafted onto xanthan gum (XG) by free radical polymerization using ceric ion as an initiator. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry indicated the formation of the graft copolymer. The obtained graft copolymer was loaded with ATL and films were fabricated by solution casting method for transdermal application. Various formulations were prepared by varying the grafting ratio, drug loading, and different penetration enhancers. The formulations prepared were characterized for weight, thickness uniformity, water vapor transmission rate, and uniformity in drug content of the matrix. All the thin films were slightly opaque, smooth, flexible, and permeable to water vapor, indicating their permeability characteristics suitable for transdermal studies. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry studies indicated no significant interactions between drug and polymer. Drug is distributed uniformly in the matrix but showed a slight amorphous nature. Drug-loaded films were analyzed by X-ray diffraction to understand the drug polymorphism inside the films. Scanning electron microscopic studies of the placebo and drug-loaded films demonstrated a remarkable change in their surface morphology. The skin irritation tests were performed in mice and these results suggested that both placebo and drug-loaded films produced negligible erythema and edema compared to formalin (0.8% v/v) as the standard irritant. The in vitro drug release studies were performed in phosphate buffer saline using a Keshary-Chien diffusion cell. Different formulations were prepared and variations in drug release profiles were observed.

Although alterations in these channels have been implicated in a variety of pathological pain states, their roles in processing sensory information remain poorly understood. Here, we carried out a detailed characterization of LVA currents in DRG neurons by using a method for better separation of NaN/Nav1.9 and I(Ca)T currents. NaN/Nav1.9 was inhibited by inorganic I(Ca) blockers as follows (IC(50), microM): La(3+) (46) > Cd(2+) (233) > Ni(2+) (892) and by mibefradil, a non-dihydropyridine I(Ca)T antagonist. Amiloride, however, a preferential Cav3.2 channel blocker, had no effects on NaN/Nav1.9 current. Using these discriminative tools, we showed that NaN/Nav1.9, Cav3.2, and amiloride- and Ni(2+)-resistant I(Ca)T (AR-I(Ca)T) contribute differentially to LVA currents in distinct sensory cell populations. NaN/Nav1.9 carried LVA currents into type-I (CI) and type-II (CII) small nociceptors and medium-Adelta-like nociceptive cells but not in low-threshold mechanoreceptors, including putative Down-hair (D-hair) and Aalpha/beta cells. Cav3.2 predominated in CII-nociceptors and in putative D-hair cells. AR-I(Ca)T was restricted to CII-nociceptors, putative D-hair cells, and Aalpha/beta-like cells. These cell types distinguished by their current-signature displayed different types of mechanosensitive channels. CI- and CII-nociceptors displayed amiloride-sensitive high-threshold mechanical currents with slow or no adaptation, respectively. Putative D-hair and Aalpha/beta-like cells had low-threshold mechanical currents, which were distinguished by their adapting kinetics and sensitivity to amiloride. Thus, subspecialized DRG cells express specific combinations of LVA and mechanosensitive channels, which are likely to play a key role in shaping responses of DRG neurons transmitting different sensory modalities.",

    "77": "Carvedilol's adrenergic antagonism does not fully explain its therapeutic actions. We therefore tested the hypothesis that its action is associated with an increase in NO synthesis. Wistar rats (male, 9 weeks, n = 10) anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital were used. Arterial NO concentration ([NO]), determined by chemiluminescence, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were monitored throughout the experiment. In protocol 1), the effects of carvedilol (1 mg/kg, iv) were studied over a eriod of 90 min. In protocol 2), carvedilol was p administered, followed by the NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor L-NAME (5 mg/kg, iv) and by a second carvedilol administration. In protocol 1), carvedilol induced a significant fall in MAP (from 125,0 +/- 4,5 mmHg to 78.2 +/- 2.6 mmHg; p <0.001), reaching a minimum at t = 11.7 +/- 2.1 min and recovering 60 min afterwards (105.7 +/- 5.9 mmHg). Plasma [NO] varied in response to carvedilol in inverse proportion to MAP: baseline, 19.8 +/- 0.9 microM; t = 11.7 +/- 2.1 min, 32,3 +/- 2,3 microM; t = 60 min, 17.3 +/- 1.9 microM. In protocol 2), L-NAME administration blocked the effects of carvedilol (L-NAME: MAP, 129.9 +/- 5.0 mmHg; [NO], 13,1 +/- 2,3 microM. Post-L-NAME carvedilol administration resulted in MAP of 108.3 +/- 8.0 mmHg, NS, and [NO], 21.3 +/- 1.3 microM, NS. These results suggest that carvedilol increases plasma [NO], which is associated with a fall in MAP. Furthermore, carvedilol's hemodynamic action was blocked by NOS inhibition, suggesting that it depends on endogenous NO production, thus possibly explaining carvedilol's effects in hypertension and in cardiac failure.", 
    "78": "We have previously shown that acute stress-induced release of norepinephrine (NE) facilitates anxiety-like behavioral responses to stress, such as reduction in open-arm exploration on the elevated-plus maze and in social behavior on the social interaction test. Since these responses represent inhibition of ongoing behavior, it is important to also address whether NE facilitates a response that represents an activation of behavior. Correspondingly, it is unknown how a chronic elevation in tonic steady-state noradrenergic (NA) neurotransmission induced by NE reuptake blockade might alter this acute modulatory function, a regulatory process that may be pertinent to the anxiolytic effects of NE reuptake blockers such as desipramine (DMI). Therefore, in this study, we investigated noradrenergic modulation of the shock-probe defensive burying response in the lateral septum (LS). In experiment 1, shock-probe exposure induced an acute 3-fold increase in NE levels measured in LS of male Sprague-Dawley rats by microdialysis. Shock-probe exposure also induced a modest rise in plasma ACTH, taken as an indicator of perceived stress, that returned to baseline more rapidly in rats that were allowed to bury the probe compared to rats prevented from burying by providing them with minimal bedding, indicating that the active defensive burying behavior is an effective coping strategy that reduces the impact of acute shock probe-induced stress. In experiment 2, blockade of either alpha(1)- or beta-adrenergic receptors in LS by local antagonist microinjection immediately before testing reduced defensive burying and increased immobility. In the next experiment, chronic DMI treatment increased basal extracellular NE levels in LS, and attenuated the acute shock probe-induced increase in NE release in LS relative to baseline. Chronic DMI treatment decreased shock-probe defensive burying behavior in a time-dependent manner, apparent only after 2 weeks or more of drug treatment. Moreover, rats treated chronically with DMI showed no significant rise of plasma ACTH in response to shock-probe exposure. Thus, acute stress-induced release of NE in LS facilitated defensive burying, an active, adaptive behavioral coping response. Chronic treatment with the NE reuptake blocker and antidepressant drug DMI attenuated acute noradrenergic facilitation of the active burying response, and also attenuated the level of perceived stress driving that response. These results suggest that long-term regulation of the acute modulatory function of NE by chronic treatment with reuptake blockers may contribute to the mechanisms by which such drugs exert their anxiolytic effects in the treatment of stress-related psychiatric conditions, including depression and anxiety.",

Large-scale randomised, placebo controlled trials involving more than 4000 patients with chronic heart failure have demonstrated that carvedilol improves survival and reduces hospitalizations. Comparative studies with metoprolol in patients with heart failure have suggested that carvedilol may be associated with greater survival benefit although differences in the preparation of metoprolol have left uncertainty in this area. Carvedilol has a high safety profile and the clinical benefits appear maintained across a wide range of patients with comorbidities such as diabetes and renal failure. Carvedilol has also been shown to attenuate LV remodeling and improve clinical outcomes in patients with LV dysfunction and/or heart failure following acute myocardial infarction. As a result of these data, carvedilol is recommended for treatment of patients with heart failure in heart-failure guidelines. This evidence-based treatment should be widely implemented to ensure that patients with heart failure receive appropriate medical therapy.",

Patients received a conventional antiplatelet regimen either without cilostazol (group 1, n=29) or with cilostazol (group 2, n=27). At 6 months, the difference in the change in heart rate between group 1 and group 2 was statistically significant (9.9 beats/min; p=0.04). However, changes in LV end-systolic volume (LVESV) (7.1+/-8.2 vs 10.0+/-21.7 ml, p=0.60), LV ejection fraction (EF) (8.2+/-9.9 vs 9.0+/-12.6%, p=0.85) and the ratio of early mitral inflow velocity to the mitral annular velocity (E/E') (0.6+/-3.7 vs -1.7+/-3.2) were not different between the 2 groups.

    "100": "Bioequivalence data for two pharmaceutical formulations (solid oral dosage forms) containing carvedilol is presented for both racemic and enantiomers of the active substance. This was achieved by on-line coupling of two liquid chromatographic separations followed by fluorescence detection. The first LC dimension was used for a fast separation of racemic carvedilol from propranolol (IS) and the endogenous matrix, by means of a reversed phase mechanism. The peak of racemic carvedilol was on-line transferred to the second enantioselective LC dimension, based on a reversed phase separation on cellulose tris(3,5-dimethyl-phenylcarbamate) stationary phase. Both stages were monitored over a single run by means of a fluorescence detector operated at an excitation wavelength of 285 nm and an emission wavelength of 355 nm. Automated shortcutting of the racemic carvedilol peak to the chiral column and simultaneous detection over the two LC dimensions have been obtained by using an experimental set-up based on two six-port rotative switching valves. Linearity was demonstrated on the interval 2-150 ng/mL for racemic carvedilol and on 1-75 ng/mL intervals for enantiomers. LLOQ fits between 0.7 and 1.4 ng/mL. Recoveries of the target compounds are 87+/-4 and 81+/-4% for the IS. Precision ranged from 0.6 to 2.5% and the mean accuracy obtained on quality control samples (measured as % bias) over the whole study falls between -0.8 and 6.3%.",

The present study investigates the contribution of the sympathetic and vagal parasympathetic systems to the tachycardic response of long-lasting (40 min) conditioned fear responses to context. 2. The conditioned fear response evoked by re-exposure to a footshock chamber was tested 10 min after intravenous injection of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (2 mg/kg) or the muscarinic antagonist atropine methyl nitrate (2 mg/kg) in rats implanted with radiotelemetric probes. 3. Compared with saline controls, the drugs did not change the behavioural component of the response (freezing, 22 kHz ultrasonic vocalizations) or its pressor component (+28 mmHg). 4. Propranolol abolished the tachycardic response of fear, whereas atropine more than doubled it (from +75 to +175 b.p.m. above resting baseline). 5. The results demonstrate that both sympathetic and vagal parasympathetic outflows to the heart are strongly activated during conditioned fear. The vagal activation may act to hold back cardiac acceleration while the animal waits for the aversive stimulus to come.", 
    "102": "1. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I has acute effects on cardiovascular function, including a well-characterized vasodilator response in isolated arteries. In addition to increasing the release of nitric oxide, IGF-I also has effects on a variety of other signalling pathways that affect vascular tone, in particular interactions with the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. We sought to characterize the effects of intravenous IGF-I on blood pressure and on responses to noradrenaline (NA), angiotensin II, acetylcholine and dobutamine. 2. Administration of IGF-I administration caused small decreases in mean arterial pressure (5.4 +/- 1.5%) and responsiveness to the prazosin-sensitive vasoconstrictor effects of NA (a 2.1 +/- 0.6-fold increase in ED(50); n = 40; P < 0.01) and both effects were maximal at 200 microg/kg IGF-I. In addition, IGF-I significantly increased pulse pressure increases induced by low doses of dobutamine (from an increase in pulse pressure of 9.9 +/- 1.2 to 13.4 +/- 1.9 mmHg; n = 39; P < 0.05). Administration of IGF-I had no significant effect on responses to AngII or ACh. 3. Intravenous administration of IGF-I receptor antisense oligonucleotides (400 microg/kg) abolished the effects of IGF-I on NA-induced vasoconstriction (n = 11; P < 0.05), whereas administration of a mismatch oligonucleotide did not. 4. These data indicate that the maximal effects of exogenously administered IGF-I include modest direct vasodilation and inhibition of constrictor responses to NA and an increase in the effect of dobutamine on pulse pressure. The magnitude of these effects was less than what previous in vitro studies and those performed in anaesthetized animals may have indicated likely. 5. The modest magnitude of the dilator effects of IGF-I observed in conscious rats in vivo in the present study suggests that IGF-I is unlikely to be a major player in regulating vascular tone in normotensive animals.", 
    "103": "Previously published data are conflicting about the effect of various factors on secretions from minor salivary glands. The aim of the present study was to investigate the secretion rate from palatal, buccal, and labial glands, and to analyze the immunoglobulin A (IgA) concentrations in relation to age, gender, circulatory disease, diabetes, medication, smoking, and pregnancy. Resting and stimulated whole-saliva secretion rates, as well as IgA concentration in stimulated whole saliva, were also examined. One-hundred and forty two individuals (96 women and 46 men), 18-82 yr of age, participated. The results did not suggest any effect of aging on the secretion capacity of minor salivary glands, but the IgA concentration seemed to increase with age. Women had lower buccal and labial saliva secretion rates, and lower levels of IgA in buccal saliva, than men. For whole saliva, resting, but not stimulated, saliva secretion rates were reduced with age, and the secretion rate of stimulated whole saliva was lower in women than in men. The IgA concentration in buccal saliva showed a positive correlation with IgA in stimulated whole saliva, and the IgA concentration decreased with increased flow rate in both salivas.", 
    "104": "Finding the predictors of outcome in outpatient cocaine dependence treatment trials may be useful for the development of both psychosocial as well as pharmacological treatments for cocaine dependence. Among the most powerful predictors of response to psychosocial treatment are cocaine withdrawal symptom severity and the results of a urine drug screen (UDS) collected at study entry. The present trial seeks to extend these findings by examining outcome predictors in a large number of subjects participating in a series of outpatient cocaine pharmacotherapy trials while selecting three separate criteria to define successful outcome. The ability of several baseline variables were tested to predict treatment outcome in a series of cocaine medication trials that included 402 cocaine-dependent subjects. Predictor variables included results from the baseline Addiction Severity Index (ASI), initial UDS results, and cocaine withdrawal symptom severity at treatment entry, as measured by scores on the Cocaine Selective Severity Assessment (CSSA). Outcome measures included UDS results obtained during the trials and results from the ASI gathered at the end of the trials. Baseline variables that most consistently predicted treatment outcome were the initial UDS results and initial CSSA scores. These findings indicate that baseline UDS results and CSSA scores are powerful predictors of outcome and should be used as stratifying variables in outpatient cocaine medication trials.", 
    "105": "The rate of rebleeding of esophageal varices remains high after cessation of acute esophageal variceal hemorrhage. Many measures have been developed to prevent the occurrence of rebleeding. When considering their effectiveness in reduction of rebleeding, the associated complications cannot be neglected. Due to unavoidable high incidence of complications, shunt surgery and endoscopic injection sclerotherapy are now rarely used. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt was developed to replace shunt operation but is now reserved for rescue therapy. Nonselective beta-blockers alone or in combination with isosorbide mononitrate and endoscopic variceal ligation are currently the first choices in the prevention of variceal rebleeding. The combination of nonselective beta-blockers and endoscopic variceal ligation appear to enhance the efficacy. With the advent of newly developed measures, esophageal variceal rebleeding could be greatly reduced and the survival of cirrhotics with bleeding esophageal varices could thereby be prolonged.",

    "107": "We analyzed nontarget effects of the beta-blockers propranolol, metoprolol, and atenolol with a screening test battery encompassing nonspecific, receptor-mediated, and reactive modes of toxic action. All beta-blockers were baseline toxicants and showed no specific effects on energy transduction nor endocrine activity in the yeast estrogen and androgen screen, and no reactive toxicity toward proteins and DNA. However, in a phytotoxicity assay based on the inhibition of the photosynthesis efficiency in green algae, all beta-blockers were 10 times more toxic than their modeled baseline toxicity. Baseline- and phytotoxicity effects increased with hydrophobicity. The beta-blockers showed concentration addition in mixture experiments, indicating a mutual specific nontarget effect on algae. Using literature data and quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR), we modeled the total toxic potential of mixtures of the beta-blockers and their associated human metabolites for the phytotoxicity endpoint with two scenarios. The realistic scenario (I) assumes that the metabolites lose their specific activity and act as baseline toxicants. In the worst-case scenario (II) the metabolites exhibitthe same specific mode of action as their parent drug. For scenario (II), metabolism hardly affected the overall toxicity of atenolol and metoprolol, whereas propranolol's hazard potential decreased significantly. In scenario (I), metabolism reduced the apparent EC50 of the mixture of parent drug and metabolite even further. The proposed method is a simple approach to initial hazard assessment of pharmaceuticals and can guide higher tier testing. It can be applied to other classes of pollutants, e.g., biocides, as well as to environmental transformation products of pollutants.",

Despite an improvement in operative and interventional treatment options, AAA is the cause of death in 1-3% of men over 65 years of age in industrial countries, mostly due to rupture [1]. Therefore, routine screening for AAA by ultrasonography has been postulated in the past: a 60 year old man with an abdominal aortic diameter of less than 3 cm has a life-time risk of developing AAA close to zero. However, routine screening has not been found to be cost effective. Despite of the results of two well-designed studies, the limits of AAA qualifying the patient for surgery or intervention in contrast to conservative treatment is still a matter of debate. The present review article summarizes the current knowledge of the pathology, incidence, risks, natural course as well as symptoms and current treatment strategies of AAA on the basis of the recent literature.",

On-line ultraviolet diode array (UV) spectroscopic detection was used prior to sample ionisation, to evaluate chromatographic and nano-ESI interface performance. Active drug responses were characterised by chromatographic retention time and electrophoretic ion mobility drift time, and selected ion mobility responses were used to evaluate method performance. Limits of detection for active drugs were in the low-nmol to pmol range. Quantitative responses were investigated using a series of standard solutions of caffeine, showing good linearity (R(2) = 0.9982, n = 6) and reproducibility (RSD = 2.3 %, n = 6).

PKC activation and PSD-95 expression each enhance NMDAR channel opening rate and number of functional channels at the cell surface. Here we show in Xenopus oocytes that PSD-95 and PKC potentiate NMDA gating and trafficking in a nonadditive manner. PSD-95 and PKC each enhance NMDA channel activity, with no change in single-channel conductance, reversal potential or mean open time. PSD-95 and PKC each potentiate NMDA channel opening rate (k(beta)) and number of functional channels at the cell surface (N), as indicated by more rapid current decay and enhanced charge transfer in the presence of the open channel blocker MK-801. PSD-95 and PKC each increase NMDAR surface expression, as indicated by immunofluorescence. PKC potentiates NMDA channel function and NMDAR surface expression to the same final absolute values in the absence or presence of PSD-95. Thus, PSD-95 partially occludes PKC potentiation. We further show that Ser-1462, a putative phosphorylation target within the PDZ-binding motif of the NR2A subunit, is required for PSD-95-induced potentiation and partial occlusion of PKC potentiation. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments with cortical neurons in culture indicate that PKC activation promotes assembly of NR2 with NR1, and that the newly assembled NMDARs are not associated with PSD-95. These findings predict that synaptic scaffolding proteins and protein kinases convergently modulate NMDAR gating and trafficking at synaptic sites.",

We recorded left atrial diameter by annual echocardiography and cardiovascular events in 881 hypertensive patients (41% women) with electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy aged 55 to 80 (mean: 66) years during a mean of 4.8 years of randomized losartan- or atenolol-based treatment in the Losartan Intervention for Endpoint Reduction in Hypertension Study. During follow-up, a total of 88 primary end points (combined cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) occurred. In Cox regression, baseline left atrial diameter/height predicted incidence of cardiovascular events (hazard ratio: 1.98 per cm/m [95% CI: 1.02 to 3.83 per cm/m]; P=0.042) adjusted for significant effects of Framingham risk score and history of atrial fibrillation. Greater left atrial diameter reduction during follow-up was associated with greater reduction in left ventricular hypertrophy, absence of new-onset atrial fibrillation or mitral regurgitation during follow-up, and losartan-based treatment (B=-0.13+/-0.03 cm/m; P<0.001) in multiple linear regression, adjusting for baseline left atrial diameter/height. However, in time-varying Cox regression analysis, left atrial diameter reduction was not independent of left ventricular hypertrophy regression in predicting cardiovascular events during follow-up. In conclusion, left atrial diameter/height predicts risk of cardiovascular events independent of other clinical risk factors in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy and may be useful in pretreatment clinical assessment of cardiovascular risk in these patients.",

A low-dose combination of 4 agents representing 4 classes of standard antihypertensive agents was more efficacious than a standard single dose of each agent individually.", 
    "138": "Although blood pressure is considered the major determinant of left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertension, genetic variability is increasingly being considered among the factors influencing this complication. beta(2)-Adrenergic receptors (beta(2)ARs) are up-regulated in hypertension and largely polymorphic within the human population. Recently, we have shown that the Glu27 beta(2)AR variant is strongly associated with cardiac hypertrophy in hypertension. The objective of this study is to verify whether this polymorphism also affects hypertrophy regression in response to antihypertensive therapy.",

Results were stratified according to treatment and the Glu27Gln polymorphism of the beta(2)AR. In cells with stable overexpression of the Glu27 or Gln27 variant of beta(2)AR, we also explored the implications of this polymorphism on hypertrophy-related intracellular signal transduction.",

Four hundred forty-one hypertrophic hypertensive patients completed the 2-year follow-up. At baseline, patients carrying at least 1 allele of the Glu27 variant presented with a larger cardiac size despite similar blood pressure levels (142.9 +/- 22.5 g/m(2) in Glu27 carriers versus 138.2 +/- 18.4 g/m(2) in Gln27 carriers, P < .02). Blood pressure normalization was achieved by both drugs. At follow-up, compared with the Gln27 patients, the Glu27 patients showed a larger reduction in hypertrophy when treated with enalapril (percent change in left ventricular mass, -6.3% +/- 7.7% in Glu27 carriers versus -2.18% +/- 7.9% in Gln27 carriers; P < .05) but not with atenolol therapy (-2.8% +/- 8.9% in Glu27 carriers versus -2.4% +/- 8.8% in Gln27 carriers, P = not significant). In in vitro studies the activation of p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK-) 1/2 (data not shown) and the activity of the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) promoter after isoproterenol (INN, isoprenaline) stimulation were larger in Glu27 beta(2)AR overexpressing cells than in Gln27 beta(2)AR overexpressing cells (fold difference compared with unstimulated cells, 9.7 +/- 2.9 for Glu27 beta(2)AR versus 4.2 +/- 0.3 for Gln27 beta(2)AR; P < .05).",

Sample clean-up was achieved by precipitation and solid phase extraction (SPE) with a mixed-mode column. Quantification was performed by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography with positive electrospray ionization mass spectrometric detection (HPLC-MS). The method has been developed and robustness tested by systematically searching for satisfactory conditions using experimental designs including factorial and response surface designs. With the exception of amlodipine, the concentration limit of quantification (cLOQ) covered low therapeutic concentration levels for all the compounds. Within assay precisions and accuracies (bias) were 3.4-21% RSD and from -24 to 21% for the concentration range 1.00-5.00 microM, respectively.

    "147": "Adrenergic modulation of glutamatergic spontaneous miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) was investigated in mechanically dissociated rat ventromedial hypothalamic (VMH) neurons using a conventional whole-cell patch clamp technique. Noradrenaline (NA) reversibly increased mEPSC frequency without affecting the current amplitude in a concentration-dependent manner, indicating that NA acts presynaptically to facilitate the probability of spontaneous glutamate release. NA (10 microM) action on glutamatergic mEPSC frequency was completely blocked by 1 microM ICI-188551 [(+/-)-1-[2,3-(dihydro-7-methyl-1H-inden-4-yl)oxy]-3-[(1-methyl-ethyl)amino]-2-butanol], a selective beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist, and mimicked by 1 microM formoterol, a selective beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonist. Neither alpha-adrenoceptor nor beta(1)-adrenoceptor blockers affected the NA-induced increase in mEPSC frequency. NA action on glutamatergic mEPSC frequency was completely occluded in the presence of either 10 microM forskolin, an adenylyl cyclase (AC) activator, or blocked by 1 microM SQ22536 [9-(tetrahydro-2-furanyl)-9H-purin-6-amine], a selective AC inhibitor. Furthermore, the NA-induced increase in mEPSC frequency was completely attenuated by either 1 muM KT5720 or 1 microM H-89 (N-[2-(p-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide), specific PKA inhibitors. However, NA still could increase mEPSC frequency either in the Ca(2+)-free external solution or in the presence of 1 microM thapsigargin. The results suggest that activation of presynaptic beta(2)-adrenoceptors facilitates spontaneous glutamate release to VMH neurons via cAMP/PKA signal transduction pathway. beta(2)-Adrenoceptor-mediated presynaptic modulation of excitatory glutamatergic transmission would therefore be expected to play a pivotal role in the regulation of a variety of behavioral functions, which are mediated by the VMH.", 
    "148": "This study investigated the effect of intraperitoneal (IP) injections of the fatty acid oxidation (FAO) inhibitor mercaptoacetate (MA, 45.6 mg/kg) on feeding in food-deprived rats. As previously, MA significantly stimulated feeding in ad libitum-fed rats. MA, however, reduced feeding in 18 and 36 h-fasted rats despite apparently antagonizing the fasting-induced increase in hepatic FAO. To test whether this anorectic effect involves beta-adrenergic stimulation, 36 h-fasted rats were IP injected with the nonspecific beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol (PROP, 0.5 mg/kg) just before MA injection. PROP attenuated MA's feeding-inhibitory effect, suggesting that MA anorexia is at least partially mediated by beta-adrenergic stimulation. Finally, we evaluated the role of subdiaphragmatic vagal afferent fibers in MA's feeding-inhibitory effect by testing the ability of MA to inhibit food intake in fasted rats after subdiaphragmatic vagal deafferentation (SDA). MA inhibited feeding similarly in SDA rats and sham-operated rats. These data demonstrate that subdiaphragmatic vagal afferents are not necessary for the feeding-inhibitory effect of peripheral MA. These results suggest that the FAO inhibitor MA elicits a feeding-inhibitory effect in fasted rats that is mediated by a different mechanism than its feeding-stimulatory effect.",

    "167": "We have previously shown that the inhibitory neuromodulator taurine attenuates the release of preloaded D-[3H]aspartate from murine corticostriatal slices evoked by ischemic conditions or by application of the sodium channel agonist veratridine. The release of D-[3H]aspartate (a non-metabolized analog of glutamate) was used as an index of glutamate release. The aim of the present study was to reveal the molecular mechanisms responsible for this inhibitory effect of taurine. It was shown that 10 mM taurine suppresses D-[3H]aspartate release evoked by 0.1 mM veratridine, but does not affect the high-K+ -(50 mM) or ouabain- (0.1 mM) evoked release. Taurine had no effect in Ca2+ -free medium when the synaptic exocytosis of D-[3H]aspartate was inhibited. Nor did it suppress the release from slices preloaded with the competitive glutamate uptake blocker DL-threo-beta-hydroxyaspartate (THBA), which inhibits D-[3H]aspartate release mediated by the reverse action of glutamate transporters. Omission of Cl- from the incubation medium reduced the effect of taurine, signifying the involvement of a Cl- channel. The glycine receptor antagonist strychnine and the GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline did not block the taurine effect, although picrotoxin, a less specific blocker of agonist-gated chloride channels, completely prevented the effect of taurine on veratridine-induced D-[3H]aspartate release. The respiratory chain blocker rotenone or mitochondrial protonophore carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) in combination with the mitochondrial ATPase inhibitor oligomycin, which inhibits the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter, also reduced the effect of taurine. The results obtained in the present study show that taurine acts specifically on the release of preloaded D-[3H]aspartate evoked by veratridine, but not on that evoked by other depolarizing agents, and affects the release mediated both by synaptic exocytosis and the reverse action of glutamate transporter. Taurine may attenuate D-[3H]aspartate release by regulation of mitochondrial Ca2+ sequestration and by activation of a chloride channel, but not that governed by GABA(A) or strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors.",

Noncompliance to methodological diuretic use can cause a serious damage such as metabolic disorders, arrhythmias, and even sudden death. Loop diuretics are the drugs of choice. Resistance to diuretics occurs in 10-20% of the cases during the course of treatment; therefore, drug combination as well as dose modification is required. Diuretics are not recommended to use alone for a symptomatic relief. They are prescribed in combination with beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, and/or angiotensin receptor blockers for a continuous pathogenetic therapy of congestive heart failure.

    "177": "Cutaneous vasoconstriction (VC) is the initial thermoregulatory response to cold exposure and can be elicited through either whole body or localized skin cooling. However, the mechanisms governing local cold-induced VC are not well understood. We tested the hypothesis that Rho kinase participates in local cold-induced cutaneous VC. In seven men and women (20-27 yr of age), up to four ventral forearm skin sites were instrumented with intradermal microdialysis fibers for localized drug delivery during cooling. Skin blood flow was monitored at each site with laser-Doppler flowmetry while local skin temperature was decreased and maintained at 24 degrees C for 40 min. Cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC; laser-Doppler flowmetry/mean arterial pressure) was expressed as percent change from 34 degrees C baseline. During the first 5 min of cooling, CVC decreased at control sites (lactated Ringer solution) to -45 +/- 6% (P < 0.001), increased at adrenoceptor-antagonized sites (yohimbine + propranolol) to 15 +/- 14% (P = 0.002), and remained unchanged at both Rho kinase-inhibited (fasudil) and adrenoceptor-antagonized + Rho kinase-inhibited sites (yohimbine + propranolol + fasudil) (-9 +/- 1%, P = 0.4 and -6 +/- 2%, P = 0.4, respectively). During the last 5 min of cooling, CVC further decreased at all sites when compared with baseline values (control, -77 +/- 4%, P < 0.001; adrenoceptor antagonized, -61 +/- 3%, P < 0.001; Rho kinase inhibited, -34 +/- 7%, P < 0.001; and adrenoceptor antagonized + Rho kinase inhibited sites, -35 +/- 3%, P < 0.001).

    "178": "The medial septum/diagonal band region, which participates in learning and memory processes via its cholinergic and GABAergic projection to the hippocampus, is one of the structures affected by beta amyloid (betaA) deposition in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The acute effects of betaA (25-35 and 1-40) on action potential generation and glutamatergic synaptic transmission in slices of the medial septal area of the rat brain were studied using current and patch-clamp techniques. The betaA mechanism of action through M1 muscarinic receptors and voltage-dependent calcium channels was also addressed. Excitatory evoked responses decreased (30-60%) in amplitude after betaA (2 microM) perfusion in 70% of recorded cells. However, the firing properties were unaltered at the same concentration. This depression was irreversible in most cases, and was not prevented or reversed by nicotine (5 microM). In addition, the results obtained using a paired-pulse protocol support pre- and postsynaptic actions of the peptide. The betaA effect was blocked by calcicludine (50 nM), a selective antagonist of L-type calcium channels, and also by blocking muscarinic receptors with atropine (5 muM) or pirenzepine (1 microM), a more specific M1-receptor blocker. We show that in the medial septal area this oligomeric peptide acts through calcium channels and muscarinic receptors. As blocking any of these pathways blocks the betaA effects, we propose a joint action through both mechanisms. These results may contribute to a better understanding of the pathophysiology at the onset of AD. This understanding will be required for the development of new therapeutic agents."
