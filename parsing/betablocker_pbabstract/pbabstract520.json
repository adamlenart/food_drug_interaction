There is a need for more work to identify the relationship between blood pressure, atheroma and other risk factors. 3. A more aggressive approach to treatment may be indicated, especially in high risk groups. 4. In addition to treatment of blood pressure, other major risk factors (lipids and smoking) must be tackled. 5. Alternative treatment regimens with different mechanisms of action and/or effects on lipids should be evaluated in practice. 6. Selective alpha 1-blockers have potential haemodynamic advantages, improve the lipid profile and are well tolerated as first or second line therapy.", 
    "1": "We have utilized cultured cell lines to test the utility of N8-(bromoacetyl)-N1-[3-(4-indolyoxy)-2-hydroxypropyl]-(Z)-1,8-diam ino- p-menthane, BIM, a recently synthesized, irreversible beta adrenergic antagonist. Previously available irreversible antagonists of beta adrenergic receptors have generally exhibited low affinity (typical IC50 values greater than or equal to 1 microM). By contrast, S49 lymphoma cells incubated with 10 nM BIM for 120 min and then washed extensively showed a 70% loss in beta adrenergic receptors, as measured by [125I]iodocyanopindolol binding. This loss, which could be prevented by propranolol, represented a decrease in receptor number without a change in affinity of the remaining receptors for [125I]iodocyanopindolol. The BIM-induced decrease in binding sites was persistent in membranes incubated for several hours after BIM treatment. BIM did not inactivate alpha-1 adrenergic receptors on Madin Darby canine kidney cells, alpha-2 adrenergic receptors on human erythroleukemia cells, nor did BIM treatment alter guanyl-5'-yl-imidodiphosphate-mediated regulation of agonist binding to the beta adrenergic receptors in S49 cell membranes. BIM treatment decreased cyclic AMP (cAMP) accumulation in S49 cells in response to the beta adrenergic agonist isoproterenol, but increased prostaglandin E1-stimulated cAMP accumulation (P = .09) without altering cAMP production in response to forskolin. The inactivation of beta receptors in S49 cells by BIM (IC50 = 0.30 nM) correlated closely with the loss in beta adrenergic receptor-mediated cAMP accumulation in these cells (IC50 = 0.59 nM), implying the absence of substantial receptor reserve for this response. We conclude that BIM is a potent, irreversible, selective beta adrenergic antagonist for the study of beta adrenergic receptors in cultured cells.", 
    "2": "The effects of nicotine on the secretion of arginine vasopressin (AVP) and of the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) were examined in conscious rabbits. Nicotine was shown to produce significant increases in plasma AVP from 1.7 +/- 0.4 to 75.3 +/- 35.1 pg/ml (P less than .05) and in plasma ANF levels from 39 +/- 11 to 121 +/- 52 pg/ml (P less than .05) within 5 min of an i.v. dose of 0.5 mg/kg. These nicotine-induced stimulations could not be inhibited by muscarinic (atropine), dopaminergic [(+/-)-sulpiride], alpha (phenoxy-benzamine) or beta adrenergic (propranolol) blockers or by a rapid infusion of fluids. Trimetaphan was ineffective in blocking the stimulation of AVP secretion but completely abolished the nicotine-induced secretion of ANF. The more lipophilic ganglionic blocker, mecamylamine, blocked the stimulation of the secretion of both peptides. The effect of nicotine on AVP production was confirmed in vitro using the rat hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system preparation where nicotine increased AVP secretion in a dose-dependent manner. This in vitro stimulation was blocked by the ganglionic blocker hexamethonium. The increase in ANF plasma concentrations was probably due to a primary response to nicotine, for although exogenous AVP (1 microgram i.v.) increased ANF levels by a factor of 3 (P less than .05), the AVP antagonist [-(beta-mercapto-beta,beta-cyclopentamethylenepropionic acid)-2- (O-methyl)tyrosine]arginine vasopressin did not prevent the nicotine-induced increase in ANF. Thus, nicotine or its effects appear to stimulate the secretion of ANF and not AVP. It was concluded that nicotine stimulates the secretion of AVP by activating central nicotinic projections to the hypothalamus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "3": "Bromoacetylalprenololmenthane (BAAM), an alkylating irreversible beta adrenoceptor antagonist, was used to study in vivo beta adrenoceptor synthesis in adult rat left ventricle under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. In normoxic conditions cardiac beta adrenoceptor density decreased by 50% 15 h after treatment and recovered to control values after about 250 h. A similar decrease in receptor density and pattern of recovery was found in environmental hypoxia. Neither hypoxia nor treatment with BAAM had a significant effect on the dissociation constant of the radioligand. These results show that cardiac beta adrenoceptor synthesis occurs rather slowly and suggest that alteration of the rate of receptor synthesis in hypoxic states is not a major determinant of reported changes in density.", 
    "4": "Esmolol (Brevibloc) is a potent, titratable, cardioselective beta-blocker with a short elimination half-life (t1/2 = 9.2 min) and no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. It was designed for use in critically ill patients who would benefit from the short duration of beta-adrenergic blockade. Esmolol's short duration of action allows for rapid onset and control of hemodynamic effects. Its safety and efficacy has been demonstrated in patients with acute myocardial ischemia. This review provides a brief summary of the pharmacology of esmolol, as well as experimental and clinical evidence on the use of esmolol in acute myocardial ischemia.", 
    "5": "The toxicity of beta-blocker, Befunolol HCl (BFE), to the retinal pigment epithelium was investigated electrophysiologically. Rabbit in vivo ERG b- and c-waves were recorded after intravitreal injections of 0.1 ml of 0.25, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 10% BFE solutions with osmolalities of 304, 340, 383, 432, 493 and 618 mOsm respectively. Phosphate solutions with osmotic pressure corresponding to the BFE solutions were injected as control. In eyes injected with 0.25% BFE, amplitude of either b- and c-waves were unchanged for 60 min, while in eyes injected with BFE with a higher concentration than 1%, the b-waves attenuated but the c-waves enhanced in proportion to the BFE concentrations. In the control group, the b-waves attenuated and the c-waves enhanced by the injection of the high osmotic phosphate solutions up to 500 mOsm, which corresponded to the osmotic pressure of 6% BFE, but attenuated by the phosphate solutions higher than 600 mOsm. Based on the above result, no acute toxicity of BFE to the retina was suggested in dose of its therapeutic use. The attenuation of b-waves by BFE was likely due to the influence of osmotic pressure since no significant difference in the b-waves amplitudes was found between BFE and equimolar phosphate solutions. However, high concentration of BFE itself was suggested to exhibit an effect to enhance the c-wave because a manifest difference was observed in the c-wave amplitudes between the group at higher BFE concentrations and the correspond control group.", 
    "6": "In order to determine if the beginning of the Myocardial Infarction (MI) is at random along the day or if it follows a circadian rhythm, we analyzed the clinical charts of 819 patients admitted to the Coronary Care Unite. Among them, 645 were male and 174 female. It was established that the beginning of the MI follows a circadian rhythm with maximal frequency between 8 and 9 a.m. and minimal at 0 hours (p greater than 0.01). This rhythm is sex independent. In patients younger than 45 years as well as those who received beta-block agents in less than 24 hours previous the MI no circadian rhythm was observed.", 
    "7": "With the increasing number of drugs, the list of agents which are capable of inducing pulmonary reactions continues to lengthen. This article is a compendium of presently available information on drug induced pulmonary reactions which we have found clinically useful. We have divided the drugs in groups on the basis of two features, pharmacologic actions and type of pulmonary reactions. A total of 109 drugs are cited. Categories of pharmacologic actions include cytotoxic drugs, analgesic and antirheumatic drugs, antimicrobial agents, vasoactive drugs, tranquilizers, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, antiarrhythmics, oral antidiabetics and a group of miscellaneous drugs. Type of pulmonary reactions include pulmonary eosinophilia, bronchoconstriction, acute interstitial pulmonary disease, mediastinic involvement, pleural effusion, pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary calcifications, pulmonary infections and drugs reported to cause drug-induced Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.", 
    "8": "The effect of alpha-adrenoblocker dibenamine and beta-adrenoblocker propranolol on the blood level of thyroid hormones (TH) and TH production by isolated thyroids (T) was investigated in adult and old male rats. Isolated T were incubated for 4 h in medium 199 with or without TSH (100 mU/ml). TH blood concentration and specific TH production by isolated T was decreased with age. TSH stimulated thyroid hormone production in isolated T only in adult rats. Alpha- or beta-adrenoblockers administration resulted in a decrease in the TH blood concentration, basal and TSH-stimulated thyroid hormone production in adult rats. The results obtained suggested that aging was accompanied by decreased adrenergic control of thyroid function.", 
    "9": "The effects of phenylephrine and noradrenaline have been investigated on the perfusion pressure of the rat isolated lung. Both drugs (0.3-30 micrograms) produced a dose-dependent decrease in perfusion pressure elevated by 20 mM KCl, which was reversed to a dose-dependent increase after addition of propranolol (1 x 10(-7) M) to the perfusion fluid. Increments due to both agonists in the presence of propranolol were antagonized by prazosin (1 x 10(-6) M). Propranolol, but not prazosin, elevated the basal perfusion pressure. The results indicate that phenylephrine and noradrenaline are more effective in stimulating beta-adrenoceptors than alpha-adrenoceptors in the rat pulmonary vascular bed and that beta-adrenoceptors may regulate the vascular tone of the rat pulmonary circulation.", 
    "10": "Our previous studies using an in vivo tissue-sampling single-carotid injection method have shown that the transport of DL-propranolol into rat brain is inhibited by the serum from rats with uranyl nitrate-induced acute renal failure. The present studies were designed to examine the effect of serum from patients with renal or liver disease on the transport of DL-propranolol into the rat brain. While the binding of DL-propranolol to serum from cirrhotic patients was significantly decreased compared to normal serum, there was no change for the serum from patients with renal failure. In the carotid injection studies, the brain transport parameters such as the brain uptake index (BUI), the unidirectional extraction ratio (ET), the blood-brain barrier permeability surface area product (PSapp), and PSapp corrected for the unbound fraction (PSuapp) in rats injected with serum from patients with renal failure were significantly reduced to approximately 40-53% of those in controls. No change in BUI, ET, and PSapp was found in rats injected with serum from cirrhotic patients. However, the cirrhotic patients adopted in the present study had relatively mild liver disease (judging from the biochemical blood test), and we cannot refer to the more severe cirrhotic patients only from this study. Moreover, significant correlations were observed between the biochemical parameters (blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine concentration) representing the degree of renal failure and the transport parameters (ET, PSapp, or PSuapp) of DL-propranolol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "11": "Regioisomeric monomethyl ethers of the 3,4-catechol of propranolol (1) and its 3-aryloxypropane-1,2-diol (glycol) metabolite were prepared to prove the structures of these putative products of oxidative metabolism. The ring regioisomer 4-methoxy-3-hydroxypropranolol (3) was prepared from 1-acetoxy-3-acetyl-4-methoxynaphthalene (8). Baeyer-Villiger oxidation was the key step in converting the 3-acetyl functionality to the desired 3-naphthol. The ring regioisomer 4-hydroxy-3-methoxypropranolol (4) was prepared from 3-methoxy-1,4-dihydroxynaphthalene (13) by selective 1-O-acylation with trimethylacetyl chloride. 4-O-Benzylation, followed by hydrolysis, and side chain elaboration afforded the 4-O-benzyl ether of 4. Similar methods afforded glycols 5 and 6, with the side chain obtained by osmium tetroxide oxidation of an O-allyl group. GC/MS analysis using the trifluoroacetyl derivatives of these known standards showed both 3 and 4 were metabolites of 1 in the rat. From a single dose study in man, 4 was identified as a minor urinary metabolite, and both regioisomeric glycol metabolites 5 and 6 were observed. In addition, another regioisomeric hydroxymethoxyglycol metabolite was found.", 
    "12": "The formation of the three prominent dihydroxylated propranolol [(HO)2-P] metabolites, 4,6-, 4,8-, and 3,4-(HO)2-Ps, was investigated in vivo in rat and in man. Authentic O,O-dibenzyl ethers of 4,6- and 4,8-(HO)2-P were synthesized from the corresponding dihydroxy-l-naphthaldehydes. The l-carboxyaldehyde group was used as the latent side chain l-naphthol ether available by Baeyer-Villiger oxidation and subsequent side chain elaboration. The benzyl ethers were cleaved, and the resulting dihydroxynaphthalenes were immediately derivatized with bis-N,O-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide. After ip administration of P-3,3-d2 (20 mg/kg) to rats, 4,6-, 5,6-, 3,7-, 3,4-, and 4,8-(HO)2-Ps were identified by GC/MS as urinary metabolites. After administering pseudoracemic propranolol [(2R)-P-d0/(2S)-P-3,3-d2] ip to rats (20 mg/kg), parent ions of the (HO)2-Ps as trimethylsilyl derivatives were monitored by GC/MS. While 4,6- and 3,4-(HO)2-P arose stereoselectively from (2S)-propranolol, 4,8-, 4,7-, and 5,6-(HO)2-P arose stereoselectively from (2R)-propranolol. About 3.3% of the dose was converted to (HO)2-Ps. Three (HO)2-Ps, 4,6-, 4,8-, and 3,4-(HO)2-P, were identified as urinary metabolites of propranolol in man after a single oral dose of 80 mg of P-3,3-d2. Less than 1% of this dose was converted to urinary (HO)2-Ps in 24 hr.", 
    "13": "The formation of dihydroxylated propranolol metabolites [(HO)2-Ps], determined as their trimethylsilyl derivatives, was investigated using GC/MS techniques. Tentative structural assignment for the (HO)2-Ps was achieved by matching retention times of the (HO)2-Ps arising from the incubation of synthetic mono-HO-P regioisomers in the presence of the rat liver 9000g supernatant. Seven compounds were identified as (HO)2-Ps: 2,3-, 3,4-, 3,7-, 4,6-, 4,8-, 5,6-, and 7,8-(HO)2-P. Five of these regioisomers were observed as metabolites when propranolol was the substrate: 4,8-, 3,4-, 5,6-, and 4,6-(HO)2-P. The pathway for the formation of (HO)2-Ps was investigated by incubating propranolol in the presence of rat liver microsomes under an 18O2 atmosphere. 18O2 was the source of both hydroxyl group oxygen atoms indicating that sequential hydroxylation occurs. Mono-HO-Ps, not having hydroxyl groups at C-4 or C-5, proved to be the best substrates for the second hydroxylation. Propranolol is a better substrate than is 4-HO-P for formation of (HO)2-Ps. The regioselectivity of the second hydroxylation is predictable on the basis of expected sites of electrophilic substitution on the mono-HO-P intermediates. Substrate stereoselectivity in the formation of (HO)2-Ps was determined.", 
    "14": "Electrical stimulation of an acutely decentralized stellate or middle cervical ganglion or cardiopulmonary nerve augments cardiac chronotropism or inotropism; as the stimulation continues there is a gradual reduction of this augmentation following the peak response, i.e., an inhibition of augmentation. The amount of this inhibition was found to be dependent upon the region of the heart investigated and the neural structure stimulated. The cardiac parameters which were augmented the most displayed the greatest inhibition. Maximum augmentation or inhibition occurred, in most instances, when 5-20 Hz stimuli were used. Inhibition of augmentation was overcome when the stimulation frequency was subsequently increased or following the administration of nicotine or tyramine, indicating that the inhibition was not primarily due to the lack of availability of noradrenaline in the nerve terminals of the efferent postganglionic sympathetic neurons. Furthermore, as infusions of isoproterenol or noradrenaline during the period of inhibition could still augment cardiac responses, whereas during the early peak responses they did not, the inhibition of augmentation does not appear to be due primarily to down regulation of cardiac myocyte beta-adrenergic receptors. The inhibition was modified by hexamethonium but not by phentolamine or atropine. Inhibition occurred when all ipsilateral cardiopulmonary nerves connected with acutely decentralized middle cervical and stellate ganglia were stimulated, whereas significant inhibition did not occur when these nerves were stimulated after they had been disconnected from the ipsilateral decentralized ganglia. Taken together these data indicate that the inhibition of cardiac augmentation which occurs during relatively long-term stimulation of intrathoracic sympathetic neural elements is due in large part to nicotinic cholinergic synaptic mechanisms that lie primarily in the major thoracic autonomic ganglia. They also indicate that long-term stimulation in intrathoracic sympathetic neural elements with frequencies as low as 2 Hz may augment the heart as much as higher stimulation frequencies, depending upon the structure stimulated and the cardiovascular parameter monitored.", 
    "15": "A sensitive visual method for the thin-layer chromatography of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs is described. The Rf values and the detection limits of eleven beta-blockers extracted from urine and as pure drugs are given. Other commonly used cardiovascular drugs are shown not to interfere with the method. The procedure is applicable to both urine and liver extracts.", 
    "16": "The negative effects of high blood pressure on longevity and health in the elderly are considerable. Despite this fact physicians still tend to be reluctant when it comes to exposing elderly hypertensives to antihypertensive treatment. To some extent this cautious attitude can be rationalized because cardiovascular homeostasis becomes less effective with increasing age, particularly in hypertension. Over the past decade, however, several controlled trials have demonstrated a favourable benefit/hazard ratio with respect to the effects of antihypertensive treatment on cardiovascular prognosis in elderly hypertensives. The results of these trials are briefly reviewed, followed by a more extensive report on the trial conducted by the European Working Party on Hypertension in the Elderly (EWPHE). The implications for practice are considered with respect to different classes of hypotensive drugs. Thiazides--with potassium sparing adjuvants--despite their biochemically untoward effects are recommended as the treatment of first choice in view of the trial results. The remainder (beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, ketanserin) are still in the competing stage, although there may be clarification in the near future in terms of subjective side-effects and ancillary properties.", 
    "17": "Primary dysmenorrhea occurs mostly in young women with a painful bleeding pattern. In a recent study, 72% of 19-year-old women had light, 19% had medium to severe, and 8% had severe symptoms. Secondary dysmenorrhea means pathological organic alterations of the genital tract: uterus myomatosus, endometrial polyps, endometriosis, and retroflexed uterus. IUDs can also generate this condition. A certain imbalance of estradiol and progesterone results in defective prostaglandin formation in the endometrium (too much PGF2alpha and too little PGI2) as well as in abnormal and increased uterine contractility and diminished endometrial, blood supply with concomitant painful ischemia. Increased prostaglandin synthesis leads to inflammatory processes and the traumatization of the endometrium (high PGF2alpha level), but IUDs also often cause secondary dysmenorrhea. Treatment calls for the normalization of prostaglandin formation in the uterus by dietary change by increasing fatty acid intake (fish oils and plant fats), and also by the systematic addition of exogenic gestagens (Duphaston 10 mg/day po. Orgametril 5 mg/day), and by the use of the progesterone-releasing IUDs (Biograviplan and Progestasert) that lessen the contractility of the myometrium by reducing PGF2-alpha synthesis. If pregnancy is to be avoided hormonal ovulation inhibitors as optimal, since their effectiveness is over 90% (Cilest, Femovan, Marvelon, and Ortho-Novum 2 mg). If contraception is not sought, nonsteroidal antiphlogistics are recommended: ibuprofen (400 mg 3-4 times/day), naproxen (250 mg 4-5 times/day), flufenamic acid (200 mg/day tid), mefenamic acid (500 mg 3 tid or 250 mg qid), aspirin (650 mg every 4-6 hours), indomethacin (25 mg tid, although it is relatively toxic). Magnesium is a natural calcium antagonist that can influence the intracellular calcium concentration in the myometrium. THe calcium blocker nifedipin (20-40 mg po) and beta-sympathomimetics (Partusisten) also mitigate uterine contractions, but the latter can produce more side effects as a consequence of interfering in the vegetative nervous system.", 
    "18": "1. beta-Adrenoceptor blocking agents are used to manage various cardiovascular disorders. A limiting factor in their use is the suppression of the cardiac contractile state. In our study, we examined the cardiac effects of celiprolol, a new beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent with reported positive inotropic effects. 2. Dogs were instrumented by use of sterile surgical techniques for the study of myocardial inotropic state, heart rate and internal left ventricular dimensions. Following complete recovery from surgery, experiments were conducted in the conscious state. 3. Intravenous injection of celiprolol (3 mg kg-1) in nine dogs, increased LV dP/dt by 13 +/- 2.6%, velocity of shortening (LV dD/dt) by 9.2 +/- 3.4%, and heart rate by 19 +/- 4.6% and decreased LV end-diastolic diameter by 1.8 +/- 0.8%, all significantly (P less than 0.05). Celiprolol blocked the inotropic actions of isoprenaline (0.5 micrograms kg-1) but only partially reduced its hypotensive effects. Propranolol, in contrast, reduced LV dP/dt by 17 +/- 3.3% and heart rate by 8.1 +/- 2.7% (P less than 0.05) while totally abolishing the hypotension, tachycardia and increase in LV dP/dt caused by isoprenaline. Following beta-adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol and with heart rate held constant by electrical pacing, celiprolol increased LV dP/dt by 16 +/- 4.0%, LV dD/dt by 12 +/- 3.0% and reduced LV end-diastolic diameter by 3.5 +/- 0.5% (P less than 0.05). 4. Thus, in conscious dogs, celiprolol increases inotropic state and reduces preload independently of beta 1-adrenoceptor mechanisms and the Bowditch phenomenon, while effectively blocking beta 1-receptors in the heart. These properties would make celiprolol useful in patients where a conventional beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent might lead to pump failure.", 
    "19": "The hemodynamic effects of flestolol were evaluated in 30 patients undergoing routine cardiac catheterization. Hemodynamic measurements were obtained during baseline (prior to flestolol), at steady state during IV flestolol infusion (1, 5, and 10 micrograms/kg/min) and at 20 to 30 minutes after discontinuation (postinfusion). Flestolol-induced hemodynamic changes were similar to those induced by other beta blockers without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Significant dose-dependent reduction in heart rate, rate pressure product, and increase in peripheral vascular resistance were seen. Flestolol produced clinically insignificant decrease in myocardial contractility as shown by slight decrease in LVdp/dt, CI, and LVEF. Hemodynamic data from patients with paced heart rate, further confirms a direct mild cardiac depressant effect of flestolol, a finding common to other beta blockers. Consistent with the short elimination half-life of flestolol (t1/2 = 6.5 minutes), most of the hemodynamic changes rapidly returned to preinfusion level within 20 to 30 minutes following its discontinuation. Thus flestolol, with its unique pharmacokinetic profile and titrability, may be beneficial in the treatment of critically ill patients.", 
    "20": "The coronary anatomy of 69 patients with unstable angina, subgrouped according to response to medical therapy, was investigated. All patients received oral treatment with nitrates, calcium antagonists, and beta-blocking agents. When combined oral treatment was not effective, an intravenous infusion of nitrates (10-100 micrograms/min) was subsequently administered. Coronary arteriography was performed within hours (14 +/- 9 h) from the last episode of chest pain in 28 patients refractory to medical treatment, while in 41 patients who became asymptomatic during medical therapy, angiography was performed after an observation period of several days (8 +/- 6 days). On angiography, the nonresponder group was characterized by a prevalence of eccentric and multiple lesions, and by a 46% incidence of thrombi (p less than 0.001). Recurrent symptoms requiring emergency bypass operation were common in this group. In patients responsive to medical treatment, a high percentage of concentric lesions (37%) and totally occluded (34%) coronary arteries was found (p less than 0.05). No infarcts and low rate of recurrent angina were noted in these patients during hospitalization. In conclusion, the finding of intracoronary thrombotic material and eccentric or multiple lesions can be an accurate markers of the active phase of the disease, while \"silent\" occlusion of the involved vessel may be accompanied by relief of symptoms during medical therapy.", 
    "21": "Seventeen thousand three hundred and fifty four mildly hypertensive people with diastolic blood pressures between 90 and 109 mm Hg at screening were randomised to active treatment, with bendrofluazide or propranolol, or to placebo tablets. They were followed for a maximum of five and a half years, giving a total of 85,572 patient-years of observation. There were 456 myocardial infarctions or sudden coronary deaths. Drug treatment did not affect the overall rate of coronary events. Rates per thousand person-years were 8.3 and 9.0 in men and 1.8 and 1.7 in women in the active treatment and placebo groups respectively. Event rates were much higher in smokers than in non-smokers on placebo treatment (12.6 and 7.5 in men and 3.5 and 1.0 in women in smokers and non-smokers respectively). An analysis of subgroup results showed a lower event rate in non-smoking men on propranolol than in non-smokers on placebo (5.0 and 7.5 per thousand person-years respectively). Bendrofluazide had no apparent effect on the event rate. The interaction between the type of treatment (propranolol, bendrofluazide, or placebo) and smoking in determining the coronary event rate was not statistically significant, however. The incidence of electrocardiographic changes of silent infarction--that is major Q/QS abnormalities--differed little with sex, smoking habit, or treatment with either active drug.", 
    "22": "Adverse effects of beta-adrenergic receptor blocking drugs can be divided into two categories: 1) those that result from known pharmacological consequences of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade; and 2) other reactions that do not appear to result from beta-adrenergic receptor blockade. Adverse effects of the first type include bronchospasm, heart failure, prolonged hypoglycemia, bradycardia, heart block, intermittent claudication, and Raynaud's phenomenon. Neurological reactions include depression, fatigue, and nightmares. It is not yet proven whether the beta 1-selective adrenergic blockers or those with partial agonist activity reduce the overall frequency of adverse reactions seen with propranolol. Patient age does not appear, in itself, to be associated with more beta-blocker side effects. Side effects of the second category are rare. They include an unusual oculomucocutaneous reaction and the possibility of oncogenesis. There are also many drugs that interact with beta-blockers, which may increase toxicity. Finally, there are specific patient characteristics where one beta-blocker may be more effective and safer than another.", 
    "23": "We examined the influence of baroreceptor reflex sensitivity (the increase in pulse interval in response to a phenylephrine-induced increase in blood pressure), age, blood pressure, and beta-adrenergic receptor blockade on the variability of blood pressure and heart rate in essential hypertension. Fifty-six subjects were studied before treatment; intra-arterial blood pressure was recorded outside the hospital for 24 hours. Variability was defined (from all beats occurring while subjects were awake) as the standard deviation about the average waking value for mean arterial pressure (MAP) or pulse interval. The correlation (r) between baroreceptor reflex sensitivity and blood pressure variability was -0.47 (p less than 0.0002). Baroreceptor reflex sensitivity was the only independent determinant of blood pressure variability on multiple regression analysis. Thirty subjects were restudied after 5 months of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade. Ambulatory blood pressure was lower during treatment, whereas pulse interval, its variability, and baroreceptor reflex sensitivity were higher. Blood pressure variability was unchanged. The variability of MAP was inversely correlated with baroreceptor reflex sensitivity before (r = -0.42, p less than 0.02) and during (r = -0.45, p less than 0.02) treatment, but it was unrelated to the average ambulatory MAP or to the variability of pulse interval either before or during beta-blockade. Sixteen subjects whose average waking ambulatory blood pressure was 140/90 mm Hg or less were not treated. This group of borderline hypertensive subjects had less variable MAP than did the remaining 40 subjects (12.4 +/- 2.3 [SD] vs 14.5 +/- 2.5 mm Hg; p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "24": "The effect of intravenous infusion of epinephrine, either alone or together with various doses of phentolamine or propranolol, on the secretion of both glucagon and insulin was determined in six sheep. Intravenous infusion of epinephrine alone caused increases in plasma glucagon and glucose concentrations and produced a slight but significant decrease in plasma insulin concentration. The concomitant infusion of propranolol and epinephrine augmented glucagon release and inhibited insulin secretion. Combined propranolol plus epinephrine infusion also caused a marked hyperglycemia. The concomitant infusion of phentolamine and epinephrine produced slight inhibition of glucagon secretion and markedly promoted insulin secretion. Epinephrine-induced hyperglycemia was eliminated by phentolamine infusion. The effects of isoproterenol infusion on plasma glucagon, insulin, and glucose concentrations were similar to that caused by the concomitant infusion of phentolamine and epinephrine. The effects of isoproterenol were abolished by the infusion of propranolol. It is concluded that an alpha-receptor mechanism is the most important component of adrenergic modulation of pancreatic glucagon secretion, whereas beta-receptor activation stimulates and alpha-receptor activation inhibits insulin secretion in sheep.", 
    "25": "The ultra-short-acting beta-adrenergic blockers are parenteral agents that can be rapidly titrated in clinical situations where immediate beta-adrenergic blockade is warranted. The effects of those drugs rapidly dissipate after termination of treatment, providing an important safety feature. Esmolol, the prototype drug of this class, is approved for treatment of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias but also has potential use in treatment of patients with perioperative hypertension and acute myocardial ischemia.", 
    "26": "Hypotension has been the most frequently reported adverse reaction associated with infusion of the beta 1-adrenergic receptor antagonist esmolol. In some patients, this hypotension has apparently occurred independent of reduction in heart rate or systemic vascular resistance, suggesting decreased stroke volume. In the present study, the preload recuitable stroke work area (PRSWA) model was used to evaluate the negative inotropic effects of esmolol in nine chronically instrumented awake dogs. Left ventricular (LV) transmural pressure and minor axis diameter were measured by micromanometers and sonomicrometry, respectively. Vena caval occlusions were performed so that an analog of stroke work (area within LV transmural pressure-diameter loop) could be measured over a range of preloading conditions during esmolol infusions of 0, 100, 300, 1000, and 3000 micrograms/kg-1.min-1 (n = 9), and at 15 and 30 min after termination of esmolol (n = 8). The linear relationship between stroke work and end-diastolic diameter was characterized for each caval occlusion by a slope and x-intercept. PRSWA was calculated for each caval occlusion as slope/two times the square of the difference between x-intercept and the largest end diastolic diameter observed in the study of a particular dog. Heart rate was different from control (91 +/- 4) only at the highest esmolol dose (127 +/- 4). LV peak positive dP/dt, minor axis ejection shortening, stroke work, and PRSWA were depressed from control at esmolol doses greater than or equal to 300 micrograms.kg-1.min-1. All parameters except dP/dt recovered within 30 min following termination of esmolol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "27": "Ventricular tachycardia (VT) produces a wide variety of hemodynamic outcomes. Variations in autonomic nervous system response were studied in an animal model of VT. In 18 dogs anesthetized with chloralose VT was simulated by ventricular pacing (rate 240 bpm). Dynamic changes in left ventricular (LV) function were assessed during sinus rhythm and after VT was initiated, under variable autonomic conditions: ganglionic blockade with hexamethonium (n = 5), alpha-adrenergic blockade with terazosin (n = 7; 0.3 mg/kg), and beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol (n = 6; 2 mg/kg). Micromanometers were used to measure LV pressure, and endocardial piezo crystals assessed changes in cavity size. Sinus interval, an index of autonomic tone, was determined immediately after tachycardia was terminated. Under control conditions the onset of simulated VT was accompanied by severe hypotension, with a decline in LV systolic pressure from 113 +/- 5 to 67 +/- 4 mm Hg within 10 seconds (p less than 0.05). Subsequently, during persistent tachycardia peak LV pressure recovered to sinus values, and maximum +dP/dt exceeded sinus values by 20 seconds (2604 +/- 413 vs 2112 +/- 184 mm Hg/sec; 20 seconds for VT vs sinus rhythm). Diastolic pressures were unchanged, and sinus rate accelerated. Ganglionic blockade with hexamethonium resulted in persistent hypotension, blunted +dP/dt, no change in diastolic pressures, and failure of the sinus rate to accelerate after the tachycardia. After beta blockade there was sustained hypotension (LV systolic pressure 78 +/- 4 vs 120 +/- 5 mm Hg; 20 seconds for VT vs sinus rhythm), maximum +dP/dt was blunted, and minimum diastolic ventricular pressure rose. This was due to an upward shift in the diastolic pressure-dimension relationship associated with prolongation of the time constant of LV relaxation. The sinus interval did not change. In contrast, tachycardia during alpha blockade produced a sustained fall in peak LV pressure; however, maximum +dP/dt recovered (2194 +/- 328 vs 2154 +/- 153 mm Hg/sec; 20 seconds for VT vs sinus rhythm), minimum diastolic LV pressure remained low, and sinus rate accelerated after ventricular tachycardia. Hemodynamic recovery during ventricular tachycardia is mediated by the response of the autonomic nervous system and requires both alpha-adrenergic vasoconstriction and beta-adrenergic augmentation of contraction and relaxation.", 
    "28": "To assess effects of beta-adrenergic blockade on ventricular tachycardia (VT) of various mechanisms, electrophysiology studies were performed before and after intravenous infusion of propranolol (0.2 mg/kg) in 33 patients with chronic recurrent VT, who had previously been tested with intravenous verapamil (0.15 mg/kg followed by 0.005 mg/kg/min infusion). In the verapamil-irresponsive group, 10 patients (group IA) had VT that could be initiated by programmed ventricular extrastimulation and terminated by overdrive ventricular pacing, and 11 patients (group IB) had VT that could be provoked by isoproterenol infusion (3-8 micrograms/min) but not by programmed electrical stimulation, and that could not be converted to a sustained sinus rhythm by overdrive ventricular pacing. Notably, in the group IA patients, all 10 patients had structural heart disease (coronary arteriosclerosis or idiopathic cardiomyopathy); beta-adrenergic blockade accelerated the VT rate in one patient but exerted no effects on the VT rate in the remaining 9 patients, and VT remained inducible in all 10 patients. By contrast, in the group IB patients, 7 of the 11 patients had no apparent structural heart disease; beta-adrenergic blockade completely suppressed the VT inducibility during isoproterenol infusion in all 11 patients. There were 12 patients with verapamil-responsive VT (group II). 11 of the 12 patients had no apparent structural heart disease. In these patients, the initiation of VT was related to attaining a critical range of cycle lengths during sinus, atrial-paced or ventricular-paced rhythm; beta-adrenergic blockade could only slow the VT rate without suppressing its inducibility. Of note, 14 of the total 33 patients had exercise provocable VT: two in group IA, five in group IB, and seven in group II. Thus, mechanisms of VT vary among patients, and so do their pharmacologic responses. Although reentry, catecholamine-sensitive automaticity, and triggered activity related to delayed afterdepolarizations are merely speculative, results of this study indicate that beta-adrenergic blockade is only specifically effective in a subset group (group IB) of patients with VT suggestive of catecholamine-sensitive automaticity.", 
    "29": "The overflow of endogenous norepinephrine (NE) from the mesenteric vasculature of the isolated mesentery of Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) was determined in response to periarterial nerve stimulation (PNS) before and after pretreatment with propranolol or yohimbine. Propranolol pretreatment did not significantly alter spontaneous NE overflow, total NE overflow, NE overflow/stimulus or fractional NE overflow in either WKY or SHR mesenteric vascular preparations at any of the PNS frequencies used. Yohimbine pretreatment did not significantly alter spontaneous NE overflow but did significantly increase total NE overflow, NE overflow/stimulus and fractional NE overflow at all PNS frequencies used in both WKY and SHR preparations. The magnitude of the effect of yohimbine on NE overflow/stimulus did not differ between WKY and SHR over the range of PNS frequencies used. The lack of effect of propranolol on NE overflow suggests that corelease of epinephrine is not sufficient to activate beta adrenergic receptor-mediated modulation of noradrenergic neurotransmission in either WKY or SHR mesenteric vascular preparations under the in vitro study conditions used. However, the effects of yohimbine indicate that prejunctional alpha-2 adrenergic receptor-mediated inhibition of noradrenergic neurotransmission is operative in both WKY and SHR mesenteric vascular preparations. These effects of yohimbine also suggest that no significant differences exist between the functional level of prejunctional alpha-2 adrenergic receptor-mediated autoinhibitory modulation of noradrenergic neurotransmission in mesenteric vascular preparations from adult WKY and SHR under the in vitro study conditions used.", 
    "30": "Dispersed salivary acini isolated from the rat submandibular gland by enzymatic digestion were used to study the effects of alpha-receptor stimulation on transmembrane transport of 36Cl. In the absence of secretagogue, the tracer accumulated in the cells in a time-dependent manner until a steady-state content of 6.8 +/- 0.1 nmol/mg protein was attained after 3-5 min of incubation. Epinephrine (1 mumol/L) alone did not modify 36Cl accumulation but in the presence of the beta-receptor blocker propranolol (1 mumol/L) caused a significant (21%) reduction in the isotope content of the cells to 5.2 +/- 0.1 nmol/mg protein. In acini pre-loaded with 36Cl for 12 min, 1 mumol/L epinephrine caused a rapid but transient net efflux of tracer, but the isotope content subsequently increased to pre-stimulation levels. In the presence of propranolol, however, the efflux of 36Cl induced by epinephrine was larger and more sustained and was partially inhibited by the K-channel blocker quinidine (1 mmol/L) and significantly by the absence of Ca2+ in the incubation medium. The alpha-agonist phenylephrine (10 mumol/L) also significantly reduced the steady-state 36Cl content of tracer-pre-loaded cells. By contrast, exposure of the acini to epinephrine in the presence of the alpha-receptor blocker phentolamine, or the beta-agonist isoproterenol, increased the tracer content of the cells, whether the drugs were added at time zero or to tracer-pre-loaded cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "31": "The authors first reviewed the main theories concerning the pathogenesis of otosclerosis and studied the morphologic and functional characteristics of cell cultures derived from normal and otosclerotic bones. Light transmission and scanning electron microscopy did not permit definite identification of the cultured cells as predominantly osteoblasts, nor did these techniques show significant differences between cultured cells derived from normal and pathologic bone. Functional tests of the cell cultures proved more interesting. First, the bony nature of the cultured cells was demonstrated by studying the intracellular 45Ca++ uptake after stimulation with calcitonin and dybutryl-cAMP. Second, cell cultures derived from otosclerotic bone behaved differently from those derived from normal bone. Their peak uptake of calcium appeared later, and post-stimulatory values were higher, suggesting that cells derived from otosclerotic bone store a greater quantity of 45Ca++. Furthermore, after stimulation with calcitonin and propranolol, we observed an inhibition of the calcium uptake and decreased intracellular cAMP levels in normal bone cell cultures. In contrast, the cell cultures derived from otosclerotic bone exhibited an initial inhibition of calcium absorption followed by massive calcium penetration. The response of adenylate cyclase to the action of Mg++, Ca++, and F- ions was evaluated in cultures derived from normal bone, otosclerotic bone, and normal skin fibroblasts. The resulting data show that activation due to Mg++ is much lower in cultured cells derived from otosclerotic bone than in those from either normal bone or skin fibroblasts. No significant differences were found after Ca++ inhibition in any of the cell cultures. Moreover, in cell cultures derived from normal bone, F- ions induced a strong activation that was lower than the levels observed in cultures of otosclerotic bone or in normal fibroblasts. We hypothesize that an alteration at the calcitonin receptor site is responsible for the difference in calcium uptake and cAMP levels observed in the cells derived from otosclerotic bone as compared to those cultured from normal cells.", 
    "32": "beta 1-Adrenergic receptors of turkey and beta 2-receptors of rat erythrocyte membranes were identified by (-)-[3H]-dihydroalprenolol ([3H]-DHA) binding. Treatment of these membranes with the reagent cyanogen bromide causes a concentration dependent decrease in the number of binding sites, without affecting the affinity of the tracer. Whereas inactivation of the beta 1-receptors is not affected by the pH (between pH 6 and 9), substantial inactivation of the beta 2-receptors takes place only under mild acidic conditions. The ability of CNBr (cyanogen bromide) to discriminate between both receptor subclasses at basic pH is also confirmed for rat heart membranes (beta 1-receptors), Friend erythroleukemia and S49 lymphoma cell membranes (beta 2-receptors).", 
    "33": "The content of aldosterone (A) was studied in rat adrenal glands, blood plasma and peripheral tissues--in the myocardium, skeletal muscles, thymus and liver--1 h after the administration of alpha-adrenergic stimulator noradrenaline and beta-adrenergic stimulator isoprenaline and after simultaneous administration of alpha- and beta-blockers and a sympatholytic agent (pyrroxan, propranolol and bretylium tosylate respectively). Adrenergic stimulation did not change the level of A in the adrenal glands, raised its blood concentration and, to a greater extent, its level in the peripheral tissues. A marked increase in the blood concentration of A resulted from isoprenaline and its accumulation in tissues--from noradrenaline. A decrease in the level of adrenergic activity considerably lowered the A content in the adrenal glands, blood plasma and peripheral tissues excluding the myocardium where this value was higher than in the blood.", 
    "34": "Lithium (Li) at a concentration, which exerts prophylactic effects in affective disorders is known to alter noradrenaline turnover and the beta-adrenoceptor-dependent cAMP accumulation. In the present study the action of chronic Li administration (at least 5 weeks) on agonist and antagonist binding to adrenoceptors and on the regulation of adrenoceptors was investigated in rat cerebral cortex. Li treatment caused a small but significant decrease in the number of beta-adrenoceptor binding sites by 10% (3H-dihydroalprenolol binding) leaving the number of alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor binding sites (3H-prazosin and 3H-rauwolscine, respectively) unchanged. The affinity of the radioligands as well as the affinity of agonists to these binding sites were not altered. The up-regulation of beta-adrenoceptor binding sites produced by repeated reserpine injections was inhibited by 32% in rats treated concomitantly with Li, although the noradrenaline depleting effect of reserpine was not impaired. In contrast, Li treatment had no effect on the up-regulation of beta-adrenoceptor binding induced by 6-OH-dopamine, nor did it alter the beta-adrenoceptor down-regulation following chronic administration of desipramine. The up-regulation of alpha 1-adrenoceptor binding sites caused by reserpine or 6-OH-dopamine also remained unaffected by Li. It is concluded that chronic Li has limited effects on cortical adrenoceptors and their regulation. The inhibition of beta-adrenoceptor up-regulation caused by reserpine may reflect an action of Li on non-adrenergic systems rather than a general \"stabilizing\" effect on adrenoceptors proposed previously.", 
    "35": "Seven healthy volunteers were subjected to standardized bicycle ergometry. Before and at the end of exercise, leucocyte and lymphocyte subset distribution was assessed by immunofluorescence labelling with monoclonal antibodies and the cytofluorograf. Competition binding studies were performed on mononuclear leucocytes with a fixed amount of the radioligand 125I-(-)-cyanopindolol (125I-CYP) and increasing concentrations of the hydrophilic ligand (-)4-(3-tertiary-butylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy)-benzimidazol-2-one hydrochloride (CGP-12177). Total numbers of beta-adrenoceptors per cell and the receptor-ligand affinities were then derived by computer analysis. In separate experiments with blood obtained from resting subjects, beta-adrenoceptor numbers of lymphocyte subsets, which had been sorted by the fluorescence activated cell sorter, were determined by saturation binding of 125I-CYP. During exercise there was a twofold increase in total leucocyte numbers. The ratio between monocytes (4%) and lymphocytes (55%) remained constant, but the composition of lymphocyte subsets had changed. A twofold increase was observed for the lymphocyte population carrying the Leu-7 and the CD8 antigens or only the Leu-7 antigen, whereas the number of B cells and CD4 positive T cells increased only slightly. The lymphocyte phenotype changes appeared after 3 min, reached a maximum at the end of ergometry and had disappeared 30 min after exercise. Exercise led to a doubling of the number of beta-adrenoceptors in unseparated mononuclear leucocytes from 240 +/- 46 to 535 +/- 190 sites per cell (SD, n = 6). beta-Adrenoceptor numbers were higher on sorted Leu-7 positive cells (KD 14 +/- 6 pmol/l, Bmax 1174 +/- 233 sites/cell) and on CD8 positive cells (KD 145 +/- 79 pmol/l, Bmax 1577 +/- 670 sites/cell) than on monocytes (KD 39 +/- 31 pmol/l, 647 +/- 91 sites/cell). Very low specific 125I-CYP binding was found on Leu-7 and CD8 negative cells (less than 0.2 pmol/l). Before exercise the displacement curves with CGP-12177 fitted best a single site model, whereas after exercise 12% of the receptors were in a low affinity state for CGP-12177 indicating internalized receptors.

    "36": "Under influence of a 6-month treatment with 75-100 mg/d propranolol (Obsidan) a significant decrease of the proportions of eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5) in the serum was observed in 18 patients with primary hypertension stage I. The eicosapentaenoic acid belongs to the omega-3-fatty acids known as vasoprotectively effective. The results indicate an up to now unknown side effect of the propranolol therapy which is to be seen in the connection with other unfavourable effects in the lipid metabolism. The possible influence on the omega-3-fatty acid metabolism by propranolol should continue to be investigated.", 
    "37": "The effect of selectivity of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists on resting and post-exercise airway calibre in normal subjects was studied. Eight normal subjects were given atenolol 50 mg, propranolol 80 mg and placebo orally, in random order, double-blind. Specific airways conductance and flow-volume curves (partial and complete) were recorded before, 2 hours after drug administration and after exercise. Neither beta-adrenoceptor antagonist had a measurable effect on lung function tests at rest. The post-exercise increase in flow rates measured from partial flow volume curves was inhibited by propranolol but not by the beta-1-selective adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol, whereas both drugs caused a decrease in specific airways conductance after exercise. Beta-adrenoceptor antagonists may have a dual effect on airway calibre. Firstly, a direct effect on the beta-2 receptors in airway smooth muscle may occur. Secondly, beta-adrenoceptor blockade may, in the large airways, inhibit vagal pre-junctional beta-1 receptors which normally inhibit acetylcholine release at the nerve ending, thereby permitting vagally-induced airway narrowing.", 
    "38": "Electrical stimulation (100 Hz, 1 ms, 150 microA, 10 s) of the anterior hypothalamus in chloralose-anesthetized rats evoked a biphasic pressor response consisting of an initial sharp rise in arterial pressure at the onset of stimulation, followed by a second elevation after cessation of the stimulus. This response was accompanied by an increase in plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline levels. Peripheral sympathectomy with guanethidine selectively abolished the primary phase of the biphasic pressor response, while bilateral removal of the adrenal medulla eliminated only the secondary component. After alpha-adrenergic blockade with phentolamine, the primary phase of the stimulation-induced response was reduced while the secondary pressor component was blocked and replaced by a significant hypotension. The intravenous administration of sotalol enhanced the secondary pressor component without affecting the stimulation-induced plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline responses. After treatment with atropine, the secondary pressor effect was also potentiated, as the reflex bradycardia normally associated with the response was eliminated. A subsequent administration of sotalol in these rats further potentiated the secondary pressor component to stimulation. In rats treated with atropine and sotalol, the sympathetic vasomotor and the adrenomedullary pressor responses could be dissociated according to thresholds and stimulus frequency or current-response characteristics. The results suggest that in intact rats, adrenaline-induced vasodilation and reflex cardiac inhibition contribute to either reduce or mask the adrenomedullary component of the biphasic pressor response evoked by stimulation of the anterior hypothalamus. The study also raises the hypothesis of a dual regulation of both components of the sympathetic system in the anterior hypothalamic region.", 
    "39": "18 middle aged patients with primary hypertension stage I were treated with 75-100 mg Obsidan/d over a period of 6 months. After treatment a significant decrease of eicosapentaenoic acid was shown. This result is important because eicosapentaenoic acid belongs to omega-3-fatty acids, precursors of eicosanoids. They are playing a vasoprotective role and inhibit aggregation of the thrombozytes.", 
    "40": "Extracellular single-unit recordings were made from medial preoptic/anterior hypothalamic (MPOAH) neurones in urethane-anaesthetized female rats, and the responses of these neurones to electrical stimulation of the ventrolateral medulla (VLM) were investigated. Of 189 neurones tested, 20% were excited and 21% were inhibited following VLM stimulation. The latency of inhibitory responses showed a normal distribution and the mean latency was 47 ms, whereas the latency of excitatory responses showed a bimodal distribution with peaks in the ranges of 0-10 ms and 40-50 ms, respectively. Excitatory responses with latencies greater than 15 ms and inhibitory responses were significantly attenuated by intravenous injections of the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phenoxybenzamine but not the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol. In the light of these observations and the known anatomical and electrophysiological findings, it is suggested that A1 noradrenergic and/or C1 adrenergic inputs from the VLM to MPOAH neurones are, at least in part, mediated by alpha-adrenoceptors.", 
    "41": "The metabolic consequences of external hypercapnia (1% CO2) were assessed in rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) in the presence or absence of circulating levels of the beta adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol. External hypercapnia caused a severe extracellular respiratory acidosis and a less pronounced reduction of hepatic intracellular pH (pHi). pHi was restored to prehypercapnic values after 48 hr of continuous hypercapnia due to elevation of bicarbonate levels. In the presence of propranolol, hypercapnia elicited a pronounced activation of pyruvate kinase (PyK) (measured at both low and high phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) concentrations) and inactivation of both total glycogen phosphorylase (GPase) and glycogen phosphorylase a (GPase a). In the absence of propranolol, the changes in enzyme activities were significantly reduced (low PEP PyK activity) or totally absent (GPase inactivation). These results suggest that beta adrenoceptor-mediated phenomena offset disruptive effects of hypercapnia on PyK and GPase activities and may be important in the control of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis during this acid-base disturbance. The adrenergic effects were not related to modification of hepatic intracellular acid-base status. Hypercapnia induced a rapid depletion of liver glycogen and concomitant hyperglycemia. These effects were not prevented by pretreating fish with propranolol and appeared to be unrelated to changes in GPase a activity. These results suggest that factors other than adrenergic activation of GPase a are involved in the enhancement of liver glycogenolysis.", 
    "42": "A model of patent ductus arteriosus in premature lambs was created to study the relative importance of beta-adrenoreceptor stimulation and increased myocardial contractility. In 39 fetal lambs (133 +/- 2, +/- SD days gestation, term 145 days), the ductus arteriosus was infiltrated with formalin, and a snare was placed around it to regulate its patency. One day later, the lambs were delivered, given sheep surfactant, paralyzed, and mechanically ventilated. Microsphere measurements of left ventricular output were made between 4 and 6 h after delivery. When the ductus was opened, there was no change in heart rate, but there were significant increases in left ventricular output, stroke volume, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and peak dP/dt. The increase in peak dP/dt due to opening the ductus was greater than that due to an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure alone and was accompanied by an increase in norepinephrine secretion from the left ventricle. Propranolol (1 mg/kg) was used to evaluate the effect of beta-adrenergic tone on left ventricular output and contractility. The left atrium was paced in both control and propranolol-treated lambs. When the ductus was closed, propranolol significantly decreased stroke volume and peak dP/dt without changing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure or systemic vascular resistance. During a saline volume load (50 ml/kg over a 3-min period), propranolol-treated lambs had a reduced stroke volume and peak dP/dt despite similar values of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and resistance as those of control lambs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "43": "The local hemodynamic effects of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) and the selective 5-HT2 antagonist ketanserin were investigated in the forearm of 20 healthy volunteers. Single doses of 5-HT (0.1-80 ng/kg/min) and ketanserin (5-125 ng/kg/min) were administered intra-arterially. The relative alpha 1-adrenergic receptor and 5-HT2 blocking potencies of ketanserin were investigated using intra-arterial infusions of cumulative doses of methoxamine (0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 microgram/kg/min), tyramine (0.25, 0.50, and 1.25 microgram/kg/min), and 5-HT (10, 30, and 80 ng/kg/min) together with a low dose (5 ng/kg/min) and a high dose (50 ng/kg/min) of ketanserin. Forearm blood flow was measured by venous occlusion plethysmography. Heart rate and intra-arterial blood pressure were recorded semicontinuously. Intra-arterial infusion of 5-HT induced an initial transient vasodilatation, followed by a steady vasodilatation for the low doses of 5-HT (0.1-10 ng/kg/min; p less than 0.05). A steady vasoconstriction was only obtained at the highest dose of 5-HT. Ketanserin induced a dose-dependent increase in forearm blood flow from 15 ng/kg/min (p less than 0.05) onward. The vasodilatation induced by 5-HT (1 ng/kg/min) was significantly enhanced by ketanserin (125 ng/kg/min; p less than 0.05), whereas the vasoconstriction elicited by 5-HT (80 ng/kg/min) was reversed by ketanserin (50 ng/kg/min; p less than 0.05), thus confirming that 5-HT2 receptors were stimulated by 5-HT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "44": "A reovirus (type 3) receptor has previously been identified on the mouse thymoma R1.1 cell line and shown to be structurally similar to the mammalian beta-adrenergic receptor [M. S. Co, G. N. Gaulton, A. Tominaga, C.J. Homcy, B.N. Fields, and M.I. Greene (1985). Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82, 5315-5318]. To determine whether beta-adrenergic receptors are universal recognition signals for reovirus binding, we studied the human epidermoid carcinoma cell line A431 which is known to possess large numbers of functional beta-adrenergic receptors and was found in the present study to be susceptible to reovirus infection. It was observed that unlike beta-adrenergic agonists, reovirus binding and internalization did not result in the triggering of cellular adenylate cyclase activity. The presence of reovirus also had no effect on cellular response to the agonist (-)-isoproterenol, nor on the binding of the hydrophilic antagonist [3H]CGP-12,177 to intact A431 cells. Furthermore, sequestration of beta-adrenergic receptors from the cell surface by (-)-isoproterenol had no effect on reovirus binding. Conversely, the binding of [3H]CGP-12,177 to cells with internalized reovirus receptors was found to be normal. These data strongly suggest that reovirus and beta-adrenergic receptors on A431 cells are distinct from each other. Similar observations were also made with the mouse L fibroblasts, with the exception that these cells appear to possess few functional beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "45": "1. The influence of alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation on mechanical and electrophysiological parameters was investigated in ventricular preparations from guinea-pigs and rabbits. Action potential and force of contraction were measured in papillary muscles and ionic currents were measured in isolated myocytes. 2. The effects of alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation were compared with those of beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. 3. In the guinea-pig the stimulation of alpha-adrenoceptors caused a small increase in the force of contraction (less than 10% of the response to beta-adrenoceptor stimulation) which was not accompanied by any increase of the slow calcium inward current. beta-Adrenoceptor stimulation produced large increases in both force of contraction and slow inward calcium current. The noradrenaline-induced increase in the slow inward calcium current was not affected by phentolamine. 4. In the rabbit, alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation produced large increases in the force of contraction (about two thirds of those seen in response to beta-adrenoceptor stimulation). Whereas beta-adrenoceptor stimulation also produced large increases in both maximal upstroke velocity of slow-response action potentials and slow inward calcium current, there was almost no change of both parameters in response to alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation. 5. We conclude that, first, the contribution of alpha-adrenoceptors to adrenoceptor-mediated changes of force of contraction is minimal in the guinea-pig ventricle, and second, the pronounced changes of force of contraction in the rabbit ventricle in response to alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation are unrelated to changes in the slow inward calcium current.", 
    "46": "To elucidate the role played by catecholamines in the early phase of ischemic derangement of the myocardial energy metabolism, effects of beta-blockers (propranolol, pindolol, and celiprolol) and isoproterenol, and of pretreatment with reserpine and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), were studied using the isolated perfused rat heart. beta-Blockers and isoproterenol were infused for 12 min prior to induction of global ischemia. The myocardial energy consumption rate was assessed by calculating the product of left ventricular pressure and heart rate (LVP x HR). The myocardial cell creatine phosphate (CP), ATP and pH were determined with 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (31P-NMR). Global ischemia induced by cross-clamping of the aortic inflow line for 15 min resulted in falls in CP, ATP, and pH. Propranolol (6 x 10(-8) and 1.8 x 10(-7) mol/min) and pindolol (6 x 10(-7) mol/min) produced a decrease in LVP x HR and suppressed the pH fall during ischemia. Celiprolol was without significant effects on these two parameters. Isoproterenol (6 x 10(-12) mol/min) produced an increase in LVP x HR and tended to accelerate the pH fall. Catecholamine depletion with reserpine or 6-OHDA produced no beneficial effects on the pH fall. It was concluded that the beneficial effects of beta-blockers on the pH fall during early ischemia were not due to the specific beta-blocking action but to the nonspecific cardiodepressant effects of these compounds.", 
    "47": "Catecholamine stimulation increases the heart rate and the force of cardiac contraction. Cardiac output then increases, with a decrease occurring in total peripheral resistance due to smooth muscle dilation in the vascular beds of the muscle and heart, though there is constriction of the skin and viscera; this leads to a net decrease in total peripheral resistance. Consequently, systolic pressure rises and diastolic pressure falls. The net effect is to increase myocardial oxygen demand. Smoking stimulates catecholamine secretion and may therefore be expected to have detrimental effects in patients with angina. In a double-blind study of ten patients with stable angina pectoris treated with nifedipine, propranolol, and atenolol, smoking was found to have direct and adverse effects on the heart and to interfere with the efficacy of all three antianginal drugs, but with that of nifedipine the most. Differences between the two beta blockers may be related, at least in part, to the known different metabolic pathways of these drugs.", 
    "48": "Although the sympathetic nervous system is markedly activated in most patients with congestive heart failure, it is not clear whether such activity is clinically beneficial (and should be reinforced) or detrimental (and should be pharmacologically blocked). Some insights pertinent to this important question can be gained by reviewing the results of clinical trials with beta agonists and antagonists. Neither beta 1-selective (prenalterol) nor beta 2-selective (pirbuterol) agonists have been shown to be effective in treating heart failure in double-blind, placebo-controlled studies; moreover, research has indicated that prolonged stimulation of beta receptors with oral or intravenous catecholamines may adversely affect survival. In contrast, sustained therapy with drugs that attenuate the effects of the sympathetic nervous system (by blocking either tyrosine hydroxylase or beta-adrenergic receptors) may produce hemodynamic and clinical improvement and may favorably affect long-term prognosis. These potential benefits of beta-adrenergic blockade contrast strikingly with the lack of efficacy (with respect to clinical status and survival) of agents that block alpha-adrenergic receptors. Beta-adrenergic blockade carries important risks in the patient with heart failure, however. The risk-to-benefit ratio cannot be delineated accurately until the outcome of additional randomized clinical trials is known.", 
    "49": "In the critical period during which ischemia progresses to infarction, beta-blocking drugs are known to reduce oxygen demand and prevalence of arrhythmia. To investigate whether this treatment confers clinical benefits, 28 trials have been conducted involving some 27,500 patients during the early hours after onset of symptoms suggesting acute myocardial infarction (MI). Patients were randomized to receive either initial intravenous beta blocker plus oral maintenance or standard therapy. In toto, these trials indicated that early-intervention short-term beta-blocker treatment reduces: (1) the risk for early death, reinfarction, and ventricular fibrillation by about 15%; (2) enzymatic indices of infarct size; (3) the number of patients with threatened MI in whom a confirmed MI develops; and (4) the frequency of repetitive and nonrepetitive ventricular arrhythmias. Overall, the treated group had few major side effects other than a small excess of reversible and nonfatal heart block and hypotension. Retrospective analyses suggest (but do not prove) that the reduction in mortality is greatest for those treated within two hours of pain and during the first two days. These results indicate that early initial administration of intravenous beta blocker plus one week's oral beta-blocker treatment produces modest benefits that would presumably be of major public health importance if such treatment were widely used.", 
    "50": "In clinical trials to date, only two types of treatment have been shown to have a positive effect on survival in patients after acute myocardial infarction: beta blockers in acute-phase as well as long-term therapy and thrombolytic agents administered within three to four hours of the onset of symptoms. The favorable trial results from these interventions have raised new questions of scientific and clinical significance. What is the mechanism of the favorable action? Do all patients stand to benefit from treatment? What is the optimal time for initiation of treatment? How long is the treatment beneficial? What are the risks and costs? What is the public health impact of widespread use of these interventions?", 
    "51": "The concept of two patterns of catecholamine activity was first described at the turn of the century by Langely and Dale. In the late 1940s, Ahlquist conceptualized the alpha- and beta-blocking actions of catecholamines. Sir James Black's research in the 1950s led to the introduction of pronethalol and then of propranolol into the therapeutics of angina and arrhythmias. Early beta-receptor blocking compounds were noted not only to be competitive inhibitors of the beta receptor but to have a direct depressant, membrane-stabilizing action. Later compounds, such as pindolol, were noted to have partial agonist activity. Practolol, metoprolol, atenolol, and similar \"cardioselective\", or beta-selective, drugs were subsequently described. Agents that combine beta blockade with alpha blockade or vasodilator action have been developed recently. There are various therapeutically advantageous pharmacodynamic differences among the beta-blocking drugs, such as less effect of beta 1-selective drugs on bronchial smooth muscle. Lipid solubility, systemic bioavailability, first-pass liver metabolism, renal excretion, and brain penetration are pharmacokinetic properties that further distinguish one agent from another. After the initial predicted therapeutic uses, beta-blocking drugs were used in hypertension and subsequently have been applied in a wide range of cardiovascular conditions. Recent work clearly demonstrating a cardioprotective effect in the post-myocardial infarction period is a major reason that use of the agents is likely to remain high.", 
    "52": "Recent studies show that in many coronary artery disease patients with any form of angina, myocardial infarction, or positive exercise tests but no symptoms, most of the ischemic episodes are silent. Furthermore, evidence is building to suggest that in many patient groups, silent ischemia relates to prognosis. Numerous therapies, including nitroglycerin or isosorbide dinitrate, have been shown to modify silent ischemia and its associated risks. Studies indicate that frequency and perhaps duration of silent ischemic episodes can be modified by treatment with beta-adrenergic blockers or calcium antagonists alone or, even more effectively, with a combination of both types of agent. Many ischemic episodes persist, however, when therapy is directed only at reduction of angina. Evidence suggests that some characteristics of silent ischemia predict prognosis, whereas angina characteristics do not. Until additional data about prognosis and the influence of treatment on prognosis are available, the appropriate focus seems to be improvement of outcome in those patients who are at highest risk, rather than only reduction of chest pain.", 
    "53": "Primary decreases in oxygen delivery to the myocardium associated with important reductions in coronary blood flow are the main mechanism of myocardial necrosis. Endothelial injury at sites of coronary artery stenosis, platelet attachment, and release of humoral mediators, including thromboxane A2 and serotonin, may be major causes of primary reductions in coronary blood flow leading to unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction (MI). Findings of clinical studies are consistent with the hypothesis that platelet aggregation and subsequent increases in thromboxane and serotonin concentrations may play a role in causing acute MI, death, or both in patients with unstable angina. Animal studies suggest that both thromboxane and serotonin are important in initiating or sustaining the cyclic coronary blood flow reductions that occur after severe stenosis and endothelial injury. If the contribution from either of these humoral mediators is eliminated or antagonized, cyclic flow reductions are usually terminated. Beta blocker and/or thrombolytic therapy administered within the first two hours after onset of coronary artery occlusion may limit infarct size and improve segmental ventricular function. When given within six hours of symptoms of MI, thrombolytic therapy may reduce mortality.", 
    "54": "The 1984 report of the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of Hypertension for the first time recommended beta blockers as an alternative to diuretics for step 1 of stepped-care treatment. Numerous studies have shown that beta blockers are as effective as diuretics for monotherapy in patients with mild hypertension. They are the only antihypertensive drugs that have been shown to be cardioprotective following a myocardial infarction. Beta blockers are especially indicated for step 1 therapy in young patients (particularly those with evidence of hyperkinetic circulation), in patients who have had a myocardial infarction, and in patients with angina, migraine, or hereditary tremor because they are helpful in treating these conditions as well as in managing hypertension. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers are challenging beta blockers and diuretics as the drugs of choice for initial therapy of hypertension in selected patients. Time will ultimately determine the relative roles of each as step 1 therapy.", 
    "55": "Severe myocardial ischemia and infarction cause release of catecholamines, with exposure of injured myocardial cells to relatively high concentrations during the transitional period in which myocyte injury worsens. In experimental animals, the number of beta-adrenergic receptors increases markedly without any change in affinity within one hour of coronary artery occlusion, and the number of alpha-adrenergic receptors also increases. Stimulation by exogenous cate-cholamines during a period of reperfusion one hour after temporary coronary occlusion is associated with an enhanced biochemical response in the ischemic myocardium. Administration of beta-adrenergic blockers prior to or within a few minutes after occlusion limits the extent of myocardial necrosis. In clinical studies, administration of propranolol, timolol, or metoprolol has been shown to significantly reduce the mortality rate after myocardial infarction (MI). Administration of timolol or metoprolol also reduces the frequency of recurrent MI. Beta-adrenergic blockers may prolong life and reduce the risk for recurrent MI by antagonizing and/or preventing basic biologic alterations in injured myocytes and/or by antagonizing detrimental effects of the relatively high concentrations of catecholamines to which these cells are exposed. Increased number of beta-adrenergic receptors, the ability to translate adrenergic stimulation into intracellular metabolic events, and increased local concentrations of catecholamines may be important factors in arrhythmogenesis and myocyte injury during severe myocardial ischemia and evolving MI.", 
    "56": "Much has been learned in the 25 years since a beta-blocking drug was first administered to humans. The beta-adrenergic receptor has been divided into two general subtypes, and these have been purified to homogeneity. The beta 2-receptor gene has been cloned, and the primary structure of the beta 2 receptor has been deduced. Additionally, important details of the receptor-adenylate cyclase complex have been elucidated. Another general category of information relates to the unique features of the myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor population. These include (1) a relatively high proportion of beta 2 receptors and coupling of these receptors to muscle contraction; (2) the apparent lack of spare receptors; (3) selective down-regulation of the beta 1-receptor population in heart failure, with preservation of the beta 2 and alpha 1 populations; and (4) mediation of the most powerful inotropic stimulus that can be delivered by a receptor-coupled pathway. In the next 25 years, investigations will emphasize the use of molecular biologic techniques to discover crucial information about the control of beta-receptor structure and function. From this research will come both new pharmacologic agents and new applications of currently available agents.", 
    "57": "Previous studies have suggested that beta blockers might be useful in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. A randomized, double-blind clinical trial was therefore conducted to compare results with atenolol versus those with placebo in patients hospitalized with alcohol withdrawal syndrome. In addition to receiving customary therapy, patients were randomly assigned to receive atenolol (61 patients) or placebo (59 patients). Outcome was assessed daily by the measurement of nine features in three categories: vital signs, clinical signs (eg, tremor), and behavioral signs (eg, agitation). Among patients who had withdrawal symptoms at baseline, vital signs became normal more rapidly in the patients receiving atenolol; abnormal behavior and clinical characteristics also resolved more rapidly. On each treatment day, significantly fewer patients receiving atenolol required concomitant oxazepam therapy for agitation. Patients receiving placebo, however, required a significantly higher mean daily dose of oxazepam. The results indicate that atenolol is helpful in the treatment of patients with alcohol withdrawal syndrome.", 
    "58": "Persistent aggressive behavior may develop in patients with brain disorders of various types, including seizure disorders, mental retardation, metabolic disorders, head injury, and in some instances schizophrenia. Although a neurochemical basis for aggression in these cases is unclear, a hyperadrenergic state is considered to be one possibility. This has led to the hypothesis that beta blockers may be useful in the control of aggression. The original assumption was that the site of antiaggressive action of beta blockers is in the brain. However, the antiaggressive efficacy of nadolol, which does not cross the blood-brain barrier to any great extent, suggests a peripheral site or sites. A review of several studies in which both old and young aggressive patients with various organic brain disorders received propranolol showed that aggressive behavior was reduced in 75 (86%) of 87. These results are encouraging because none of the patients had responded to earlier drug treatment. However, with the exception of one study of nine patients, none of the studies were controlled for placebo effects and most were retrospective. Preliminary results suggest tentative guidelines for treatment of aggressive behavior with beta blockers. Further studies are needed, and these should use a prospective, longitudinal double-blind design; large enough patient samples to permit testing hypotheses about disease-specific or symptom-specific responses to beta blockers; and improved instruments for measuring and classifying aggression.", 
    "59": "Although mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a common valvular abnormality, its diagnostic classification has not been well defined. MVP is considered to be an anatomic entity with specific pathologic tissue characteristics and pathophysiologic consequences. The term \"MVP syndrome\" (MVPS) is used to refer to symptoms due to neuroendocrine or autonomic dysfunction that occur in patients with MVP and that cannot be explained on the basis of valvular abnormality alone. Several studies have shown that patients with MVPS have high urinary epinephrine and norepinephrine excretion, high plasma catecholamine concentrations, abnormal catecholamine response to volume expansion, and hyperresponse to adrenergic stimulation. In patients with MVPS and ventricular arrhythmias, the frequency of premature ventricular contractions parallels the urinary and plasma catecholamine values. The clinical presentation of MVPS may be related in part to high adrenergic tone and/or hyperresponse to adrenergic stimulation. Therefore, certain patients with MVPS and high adrenergic tone may benefit from beta blockade.", 
    "60": "The changes in noradrenergic and adrenergic activity that regulate beta-adrenergic receptors in the CNS have been assessed by lesion studies as well as by pharmacologic enhancement and inhibition of transmission. Beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes are differentially distributed throughout the CNS and are probably differentially regulated. An effect of normal aging on beta receptors has been found in studies of both animal and human brain tissue. Preliminary studies relating to neuropsychiatric disorders in humans and animal studies on the action of antidepressants suggest that CNS beta receptors may play a critical role in affective disorders and their treatment. This may explain why beta-blocker medication is associated with side effects such as depression and lethargy, which are generally reversible when selective hydrophilic beta blockers are used or when the therapy is withdrawn.", 
    "61": "Ventricular arrhythmias can lead to sudden cardiac death (SCD), and they can be classified according to the risk they present. Lethal ventricular arrhythmias, the least common, present the highest risk for SCD and usually manifest as paroxysmal sustained ventricular tachycardia. Most of the patients have serious left ventricular dysfunction and important hemodynamic symptoms, which must be treated immediately. Potentially lethal arrhythmias are much more common, accounting for most SCD cases. The patients generally have coronary artery disease, and the ventricular arrhythmias usually do not cause hemodynamic symptoms. Premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia are the usual forms. PVCs are classified as benign in the absence of coronary artery disease, structural heart disorders, and hemodynamic symptoms, and in these cases the risk for SCD is low. Beta blockers have been shown to reduce the SCD rate, and although the precise mechanism is unknown, the effect may be in part on an antiarrhythmic basis. Like the class IA and IB antiarrhythmic agents (the Vaughan Williams classification), beta blockers are effective in about 50% of patients with either potentially lethal or benign ventricular arrhythmias. However, compared with such agents, beta blockers have a more favorable side effects profile.", 
    "62": "The increase in sympathetic nervous system activity noted in heart failure of several etiologies has beneficial effects in the short term; in the long term, though, it may be detrimental. This provides a rationale for use of beta-blocker therapy in patients with cardiac myopathies of various etiologies. Postinfarction trials in patients with ischemic heart disease have suggested that beta blockade provides a substantial mortality benefit, and beta blockers are accepted as first-line therapy for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The use of beta-blocking drugs for dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), however, is currently investigational. Early trials reporting benefits in functional class, exercise capacity, and myocardial function stimulated further interest in this application of beta blockade. Recent studies comparing metoprolol with placebo or standard treatment have shown promising improvements in functional class and exercise capacity. The patients who will benefit most from beta-blocker therapy in DCM may be those with a high resting heart rate and a short duration of symptoms and, perhaps, feminine gender. Marked structural abnormality on cardiac biopsy (eg, fibrosis) may suggest a poor response to treatment. A multicenter controlled study of metoprolol in dilated cardiomyopathy is in progress. If the outcome is favorable, beta-blocker therapy in DCM may become an accepted, rather than an experimental, treatment.", 
    "63": "Binding of the radiolabelled antagonists [3H]rauwolscine, [3H]SCH 23390 and (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol revealed the presence of alpha 2-adrenergic greater than DA1 dopaminergic greater than beta-adrenergic receptors in membrane preparations of calf basal cerebral arteries (basilar artery and circle of Willis) and pial vessels of the cerebral convexity. Computer-assisted analysis of ICI 118 551/(-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol competition binding curves indicated the existence of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptor subtypes (beta 2/beta 1 ratio 7:3). No specific binding of [3H]prazosin (to alpha 1-adrenergic receptors) and [3H]spiroperidol (to DA2 dopaminergic receptors) was detected. Whereas DA1, beta 1- and beta 2-receptor densities were very similar in both blood vessel types, the alpha 2-receptor density was 3-fold higher in the pial vessels of the convexity. This suggests a functionally more important vasoconstrictor adrenergic control of the cerebral circulation in pial vessels of the convexity than in the arteries at the base of the brain.", 
    "64": "The aim of this study was to examine the influence of a time factor that may lead to inaccurate interpretation of data on the incidence of side effects in a double-blind study with drug cross-over. After a washout period, 58 patients with essential hypertension received either 20 mg of enalapril or 50 mg of atenolol. After two weeks, the dosage was doubled (to 40 mg of enalapril and 100 mg of atenolol) in those patients with diastolic blood pressure higher than 95 mm Hg. After four weeks of active treatment and a second two-week washout period, patients received the alternative antihypertensive agent under the same procedure and time schedule as in the first treatment phase. Four patients dropped out. Side effects were evaluated by questionnaire at weeks 2, 4, 8, and 10. In the 54 patients who completed the study, enalapril and atenolol led to almost identical blood pressure reduction in both treatment phases, indicating that pooling these data is a sound method. However, incidence of side effects was twice as high in phase 1 as in phase 2 and markedly decreased in each treatment phase, with no differences being observed between enalapril and atenolol. These results clearly demonstrate that pooling side effects data from a cross-over study may lead to quite wrong interpretations.", 
    "65": "Catecholamine-induced cardiac necrosis is a well-described phenomenon. Patients with severe head injury are known to be in a marked hyperadrenergic state and can experience cardiac morbidity; this was confirmed in a pilot study. A further study was then undertaken to examine a possible relationship between plasma catecholamine concentration and cardiac morbidity in patients with severe head injury and to assess the effect of intervention with the beta 1-selective agent atenolol. The study involved 114 hemodynamically stable patients with acute head injury who were randomized, double blind, to either placebo or atenolol given intravenously (10 mg every six hours) for three days and then orally (100 mg once a day) for four days. Both groups were equally stressed in terms of raised arterial norepinephrine levels. In patients receiving placebo, but not in those given atenolol, there was a significant (P less than 0.01) positive correlation between arterial level of norepinephrine and plasma level of cardiac-specific isoenzyme CK-MB. Thirty percent of the placebo group, in contrast to 7.4% of the atenolol group (P less than 0.05), had pathologically elevated CK-MB levels (ie, greater than 3% of total CK, a value compatible with acute myocardial infarction). Atenolol appeared to significantly reduce the likelihood of supraventricular tachycardia and ST-segment and T-wave changes and prevented cardiac necrosis (as determined post mortem). The finding that beta 1-selective blockade significantly inhibits catecholamine-induced necrosis has possible broad clinical implications.", 
    "66": "As part of the search for the biochemical and neuroanatomical etiology of suicide and depression, we have investigated the binding characteristics of beta-adrenergic receptors in homogenates of the prefrontal cortex of suicide victims and matched controls. Quantitative in vitro autoradiography was used to localize changes in receptor binding to discrete anatomical regions. A total of 28 brains (14 suicides, 14 matched controls) were examined. A significant, 50% increase in receptor density was found in prefrontal cortical homogenates of the suicide group. The increased binding is selective, appearing in some cortical regions but not in basal ganglia or white matter areas. These findings indicate that suicide is associated with anatomically selective changes in noradrenergic function in the brain.", 
    "67": "The effects of a number of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists on the modulation of secretion from bovine adrenal chromaffin cells were investigated. Secretion was induced by nicotine, 56 mM K+, histamine or Ba2+ and was detected by the ATP luciferin-luciferase bioluminescence technique or by the measurement of endogenous catecholamines (CA) by HPLC coupled with electrochemical detection. ATP release from freshly isolated cells by 5 microM nicotine was only weakly inhibited by adrenaline and noradrenaline and even then required high concentrations (greater than 500 microM), while dopamine (1 microM-1 mM) and isoproterenol (100 microM) had no effect. Clonidine (100 microM), oxymetazoline (100 microM), yohimbine (100 microM), and propranolol (5 microM) all produced inhibition of nicotine-induced ATP release with the order of potency:propranolol greater than oxymetazoline greater than clonidine = yohimbine. The inhibitory effect by propranolol could not be reversed by high concentrations of adrenaline or isoproterenol. In chromaffin cell monolayer cultures, all alpha 2-adrenoceptor agents tested (clonidine, oxymetazoline and yohimbine), produced a dose-dependent, Na+-sensitive, non-competitive inhibition of nicotine-induced catecholamine release with little effect on the catecholamine release induced by K+ (56 mM), histamine (10 microM) or Ba2+ (2.2 mM). (+/-)Propranolol caused a similar pattern of inhibition, however, this inhibition was also observed by (+)propranolol, an isomer with little beta-adrenoceptor antagonist activity. The effects of clonidine and propranolol on desensitization of nicotine-induced CA secretion were also investigated. The degree of desensitization of the nicotinic response was dependent on the concentration of nicotine to which the cells were pre-exposed. Desensitization was detected as the decrease in response to a near EC50 concentration of nicotine (5 microM) following pre-incubation of cells to nicotine in the range of 0.3-300 microM. The desensitization had a threshold of 1 microM nicotine and was maximal at 3 microM nicotine in the pre-incubation. Both clonidine (50 microM) and (+/-)propranolol (5 microM) inhibited CA secretion induced by nicotine (0.3 microM-300 microM) during the pre-incubation period. However, regardless of this inhibition of secretion, neither clonidine nor propranolol had an effect on either the onset, or the rate of nicotine-evoked desensitization subsequently observed. These data suggest that inhibition of the nicotinic response and desensitization of the nicotinic response are regulated independently.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "68": "We performed a double-masked study in which 98 patients with ocular hypertension who had been previously treated with timolol received either timolol 0.25% or carteolol 1%, a beta-blocker with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. The drugs were administered topically twice daily for one month after a one-week washout period. Intraocular pressure was measured at baseline and after one and four weeks of treatment. The appearance of the fundus, external eye, visual fields, tear secretion, blood pressure, and pulse were recorded. Adverse symptoms were elicited using a menu-type questionnaire and an overall judgment of therapy was recorded. Carteolol was as effective as timolol in reducing intraocular pressure. There were significantly fewer patients reporting adverse events overall (P = .019), and eye irritation specifically (P = .02), in the group treated with carteolol.", 
    "69": "The V region genes (VH and VL) used in the immune response of BALB/c mice to alprenolol, a synthetic beta-adrenergic ligand, were examined by Southern blot and nucleotide sequence analyses. Fourteen anti-alprenolol hybridomas utilize 10 different combinations of six Vk, one V lambda, eight VH, three JK, one J lambda, and three JH genes. In addition to the combinatorial association, somatic mutations and junctional variation of assembled genes further contribute to diversity of the anti-alprenolol response. Although differing both in length and structure, the five H-chain third complementarity-determining region analyzed contain several acidic residues. Neither V gene utilization, nor H-chain third complementarity-determining-region structure can be simply correlated with affinity of the antibodies for the ligand. The anti-alprenolol V genes were compared with the corresponding sequences of unrelated antibodies. Antibody 37A4 shares a VH gene with anti-(Glu60Ala30Tyr10)n random terpolymer and anti-nitrophenyl antibodies, and a Vk gene with two anti-oxazolone antibodies. Antibodies 14C3 and 17C1 use the same germ-line VH and Vk genes as do anti-anti-idiotypic antibodies of the (Glu60Ala30Tyr10) system. These data demonstrate the genetic diversity of the antibody response to alprenolol, and illustrate the extensive flexibility of the immune system.", 
    "70": "The beta 2-adrenergic receptors of the human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells reside on two polypeptide chains revealed by photoaffinity labelling with [125I]iodocyanopindolol-diazirine. These proteins correspond to two distinct populations of N-asparagine-linked glycoproteins: the 55-52 kDa molecules are associated with complex carbohydrate chain(s), the 65-63 kDa component with polymannosidic carbohydrate chain(s). Both types of receptors are present in preconfluent cells, but only the polymannosidic type is found in the postconfluent cells. Moreover, complex chains appear to be associated with the receptors with the highest affinity for (-)-isoproterenol and polymannosidic chains with the receptors with the lowest affinity for this agonist. the carbohydrate moiety of the beta-adrenergic receptor is involved in the expression and function of the beta 2-adrenergic receptors at the surface of the A431 cells, since tunicamycin and monensin, complete and partial inhibitors of glycosylation respectively, diminish the number of binding sites at the cell surface and increase the total number of sites in the cell. In these conditions a diminution of cyclic AMP accumulation is also observed.", 
    "71": "Pertussis-toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gi in S49 membranes, but not in S49AC- membranes, which lack Gs, induces a threefold reduction of isoproterenol affinity to the beta-adrenoceptors. A similar treatment of turkey erythrocyte membranes, which are devoid of functional Gi, has no effect on beta-agonist affinity to their beta-adrenoceptors. Non-hydrolyzable analogs such as GTP[S] induce a larger decrease in beta-adrenoceptor affinity in S49 cells towards the agonist isoproterenol as compared to pertussis-toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gi. These results suggest that Gi affects beta-adrenoceptor affinity to its agonist and that this interaction requires the presence of Gs. It seems, therefore, that Gi physically interacts with Gs to exert its effects on the receptor and probably on adenylate cyclase as well. Our ability to detect (a) the effect of pertussis-toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation in S49 cells on beta-agonist affinity and (b) the quantitative difference between the effect of pertussis toxin (approx. threefold) and GTP[S] (fivefold to sevenfold) depends on the use of a simple but rigorous method to study in detail the affinity of beta-agonists to their receptors. This method seems to be superior to the analysis of displacement curves as a means to examine receptor-ligand interactions.", 
    "72": "Chronic administration of atropine (40-100 mg/kg, 23 days) produced a 29-33% increase in muscarinic receptors, measured by [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding, in rat brain. Diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate (0.9 mg/kg, 14 days) produced a 35% decrease in muscarinic receptors. Propranolol administration (800 micrograms/kg/hr, 10 days) increased beta-adrenoceptors, measured by [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding, by 69 and 50% in brain and heart respectively. Isoproterenol administration (800 micrograms/kg/hr, 10 days) produced a 50% reduction in cardiac beta-adrenoceptors but did not alter brain receptors. These drug treatments were without effect on binding of the Ca2+ channel ligands, [3H]nimodipine and [3H]nitrendipine, to brain or heart respectively. However, chronic administration of nifedipine for 20 days (36 and 360 micrograms/kg/hr) did produce down-regulation of both cardiac and neuronal Ca2+ channels and a similar down-regulation of beta-adrenoceptors. Co-regulation of Ca2+ channels and neurotransmitter receptors may occur but may not be an automatic consequence of either receptor or channel regulation.", 
    "73": "A randomised double blind parallel group study was performed to compare the efficacy and acceptability of slow release nifedipine (maximum dose 40 mg twice a day) with those of atenolol (maximum dose 100 mg once a day) as single agents for the treatment of essential hypertension. Of 410 patients recruited almost exclusively from general practices in 22 centres in the United Kingdom 210 received nifedipine and 200 atenolol. Both drugs significantly reduced blood pressure, and control--a reduction of the diastolic pressure to less than 95 mm Hg--was obtained in about 65% of patients. Those who received nifedipine had more pronounced reductions in systolic pressure than those who received atenolol. One hundred and forty nine patients who failed to respond adequately to either atenolol or nifedipine in low doses were given both drugs once daily for eight weeks in a fixed combination capsule that contained atenolol 50 mg and nifedipine 20 mg. All patients showed further reductions in blood pressure, although those who were taking beta atenolol before the combination capsule had more pronounced reductions in systolic pressures. Twenty six patients (12%) were withdrawn because of adverse effects while taking nifedipine compared with 19 (10%) taking atenolol. Flushing and oedema were more common after the calcium antagonist, whereas diarrhoea and dyspepsia were more common after atenolol. The frequencies of headaches, dizziness, fatigue, and dyspnoea were equally distributed between the two groups. When the fixed combination capsule was taken side effects such as flushing and oedema continued. Nifedipine was more effective than atenolol in lowering systolic blood pressure, although neither drug used alone controlled the pressure of more than two thirds of the patients studied. When used in a fixed combination slightly better control of blood pressure was achieved with a lower dose of each drug.", 
    "74": "581 consecutive patients admitted to hospital for acute myocardial infarction between January 1983 and June 1985 were divided into two groups. Group A (286) patients were aged 70 years or over (76 +/- 4 years); those in group B (246) were 65 or younger (56 +/- 8 years). Group A patients had a significantly higher incidence of anterior-wall infarction (30% vs. 18% in group B); heart failure (55% vs. 32%); pulmonary oedema (18% vs. 6%); cardiogenic shock (17% vs. 6.5%); or rupture (6% vs. 2%). Patients of the older age group also significantly less often underwent systemic fibrinolysis (0.3% vs. 21%); coronary angiography (2% vs. 61%); percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or aorto-coronary bypass operation (0% vs. 22%) (P = 0.00001). Among the older patient group the cumulative mortality rate during hospitalization was 26.9% vs. 11.8% in group B, after six months it was 39% vs. 15%, after 12 months 46% vs. 17%, and after 24 months 61% vs. 21% (P = 0.00001). Causes of death were comparable in the two age groups, cardiac ones predominating. Angina in NYHA classes III-IV after discharge was present in 10% of the younger but 38% among the older patients (P = 0.00001). The death rate in patients of group A was very high under conservative treatment and surviving patients had a poor quality of life. Yet both coronary artery surgery and PTCA gave demonstrably better long-term results, both as to function and survival. Therefore, patients of even this higher age should more than is the case at present be more aggressively treated with invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.", 
    "75": "Long-term treatment with celiprolol, a new cardioselective beta blocker, significantly reduced blood pressure in 14 patients with essential hypertension (World Health Organization stages I to II). Heart rates remained within the normal range throughout treatment and no significant side effects were observed. In 4 patients, end-systolic septum thickness was measured, and evidence was obtained that the extent of left ventricular hypertrophy was reduced. These findings indicate that celiprolol can be used for the successful long-term treatment of essential hypertension, and that such treatment reduces left ventricular hypertrophy induced by high blood pressure.", 
    "76": "Beta-adrenoceptor blockade is an effective treatment for ischemic heart disease and hypertension, but the more widespread use of beta antagonists is limited by their bronchoconstrictor, vasoconstrictor and negative inotropic properties. Celiprolol has been shown in preclinical studies to be a beta 1-selective antagonist with bronchosparing and vasodilating properties, but without any cardiodepressant effect. This has been confirmed by clinical studies undertaken to date. The aim of the present study was to examine the acute effects of intravenous celiprolol on the cardiac hemodynamics of patients pretreated with oral atenolol."
