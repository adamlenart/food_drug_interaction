The release of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide from the gastrointestinal tract in response to stimulation of the vagus nerves, the splanchnic nerves and to intra-arterial infusion of acetylcholine (ACh) was examined in pigs. 2. Stimulation of the vagus nerves caused an abrupt increase in the release of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide. The amount of the peptide released depended on the frequency at which the nerves were stimulated. Maximum release was obtained at 8 Hz. 3. Atropine and beta-adrenergic blocking agents failed to diminish the vagally induced release of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, while the response was completely blocked by hexamethonium and increased after alpha-adrenergic blockade and after splanchnicotomy. 4. Intra-arterial infusion of ACh closely imitated the response to vagal stimulation, but the release of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide induced by ACh was abolished by atropine. 5. Stimulation of the splanchnic nerves caused a decrease in the release of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, an action which was annulled by alpha-adrenergic blockade, but still present after the adrenal glands were isolated from the circulation. The inhibitory effect of splanchnic stimulation significantly diminished the vagally induced release of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide. 6. The results demonstrate a dual innervation with opposing effects on the neurones containing vasoactive intestinal polypeptides. The possible physiologic implication of this finding is discussed.", 
    "1": "1. The effect of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockade on the release of pancreatic glucagon, in response to stimulation of the peripheral ends of the splanchnic nerves has been examined in adrenalectomized calves 3-5 weeks after birth. In addition, the effects of insulin, atropine and somatostatin on the glucagon response to splanchnic nerve stimulation have been assessed in adrenalectomized dogs. 2. In calves release of pancreatic glucagon in response to splanchnic nerve stimulation was not suppressed by phentolamine at a dose that effectively abolished alpha-adrenergic inhibition of insulin release, or by propranolol, at a dose that completely eliminated the chronotropic action of the cardiac sympathetic innervation. 3. In dogs release of pancreatic glucagon in response to splanchnic nerve stimulation was not suppressed by atropine (0.2 mg/kg) or somatostatin, at a dose that caused a steady fall in the concentration of gastrin in the circulating plasma (0.5 microgram-kg-1 min-1). Glucagon release was apparently potentiated by exogenous insulin (4.0 u./kg). 4. The results are discussed in relation to the findings of other workers and it is concluded that the precise mechanism whereby stimulation of the sympathetic innervation to the pancreas leads to secretion of glucagon merits more detailed investigation.", 
    "2": "Lethality to both isolated and aggregated mice was determined for graded i.p. doses of d-amphetamine, dl-4-methoxyamphetamine (PMA), dl-2,5-dimethoxyamphetamine (DMA), dl-2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromoamphetamine (DOB), dl-2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine (DOM) and d1-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA). Haloperidol (2.0 mg/kg), propranolol (10 mg/kg) and phenoxybenzamine (30 mg/kg) were tested for ability to antagonize the lethal effects of amphetamine and its derivatives. Considerable protection against amphetamine lethality was produced by haloperidol in both isolated and aggregated mice and by phenoxybenzamine in isolated mice, but propranolol was ineffective. An equivalent degree of protection was not achieved by use of any of the three agents before PMA, DMA or DOB. Protection against DOM was achieved only with phenoxybenzamine and only for isolated mice. Extensive protection against MDA was supplied by both phenoxybenzamine and propranolol for either condition of housing. Despite close structural relationships between the toxicants, the antidotal effectiveness of the receptor-blocking agents seemed quite limited and specific, and did not support any generalizations.", 
    "3": "The antihypertensive effect of oral propranolol was studied in 9 children with hypertension. After treatment with propranolol, systolic blood pressure fell by an average of 26 mmHg (P less than 0.01). Diastolic pressure decreased by 20 mmHg on average (P less than 0.01). The mean propranolol dose was 2.5 mg/kg per day. Side effects included bradycardia and anorexia. There was no correlation between pretreatment plasma renin activity and fall in blood pressure. Propranolol is an effective and well tolerated antihypertensive agent in children.", 
    "4": "Both vasodilator and inotropic agents improve cardiac function in ischemic heart failure. However, since vasodilators may reduce coronary perfusion pressure and inotropic interventions may increase myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2), both may increase myocardial ischemia. Accordingly, we determined myocardial blood flow and MVO2 in a canine model of failure induced by propranolol and volume load combined with acute coronary ligation. Both nitroprusside and digitalis reduced ventricular diastolic pressure (LVDP) and increased myocardial blood flow in the ischemic subendocardium. Decreased systolic wall tension also caused a significant reduction MVO2. The benefit of nitroprusside in failing hearts was obtained even with the addition of critical obstruction of the main left coronary artery (LCA). The role of preload reduction is emphasized by the contrasting results with nitroprusside in hearts with low LVDP: (1) decreased myocardial blood flow in ischemic subendocardium, and (2) left ventricular decompensation in animals with critical LCA obstruction. Thus, reduction of LVDP, which decreases subendocardial ischemia, is essential for the beneficial effects of vasodilators and inotropic interventions in ischemic heart failure. Decreased MVO2 caused by reduced heart size may also have a salutary role.", 
    "5": "The efficacy of adrenergic blockade with practolol was assessed by subjecting 6 adult mongrel dogs in a closed-chest procedure to bolus injections of isoproterenol (0.5 mcg/kg, i.v.) before and after practolol (2.0 mg/kg, i.v.). Following practolol both heart rate and pulse pressure responses were significantly reduced. It is suggested that significant beta1 receptor adrenergic blockade is achieved by practolol.", 
    "6": "Over an 18-month period nine infants in a neonatal intensive care unit developed hypertension (blood pressure, 115/88 to 280/140 mm Hg) at 2 to 45 days of age. Eight of the nine infants had indwelling umbilical artery catheters prior to onset of hypertension; six of the nine infants had evidence of a patent ductus arteriosus. Peripheral plasma renin activity was greater than 300 ng/ml/3 hr in six of eight infants. Angiograms were abnormal in six of seven infants and computerized renal scans were abnormal in all nine infants. One infant had congenital renal artery stenosis. Eight of nine infants had evidence of unilateral or bilateral renal artery thrombi which were felt to have emanated from an umbilical artery catheter or a ductus arteriosus. Hypertension in all infants was successfully controlled medically (follow-up of 3 to 27 months; mean, 14.4 months). Blood pressures remained normal when medication was discontinued. In our experience, neonatal renovascular hypertension is no longer uncommon, responds to aggressive medical management, and rarely requires early nephrectomy. Neonatal renovascular hypertension was usually associated with umbilical artery catheters positioned above the level of the renal arteries.", 
    "7": "Both vagal and sympathetic innervation been have described as influencing hormone release from the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas. The role of neural influences on the release of gastrin, glucagon, and secretin has been studied using the potent autonomic nerve stimulus of hypoglycaemia. Healthy subjects were each rendered hypoglycaemic by insulin 0.2 units/kg on three occasions: after atropine 20 microgram/kg: after propranolol 160 mg orally, and without prior drug administration. Adequate beta-blockade was confirmed by observation of the pusle rate response to a standard exercise at the end of the experiment, and by measurements of plasma propranolol levels. Hypoglycaemia failed to produce a rise in plasma gastrin under either propranolol or control conditions but a significant rise was noted with prior atropinisation. The glucagon response to hypoglycaemia, when measured with either the C- or N-terminal reactive antibodies, was found not to be influenced to any significant extent by either beta-blockade or atropinisation. No alteration in plasma secretin levels was noted during hypoglycaemia. It therefore appears that neural influences are relatively unimportant in the release of gastrin, glucagon, and secretin in man.", 
    "8": "The effects of angiotensin II on sinus rate and atrial contractility were investigated in 17 isolated canine atria and 5 isolated paced ventricular preparations perfused with arterial blood conducted from a heparinized donor dog. When angiotensin II was injected into the cannulated sinus node artery, positive chronotropic responses were dose-dependently produced starting from the 0.01 microgram dose although inotropic responses to angiotensin II were not consistently induced. Angiotensin II produced a similar inotropic response pattern in the paced ventricular preparation. Moreover, when angiotensin II was given into the jugular vein of the donor dog, similar positive chronotropic and inotropic responses were also shown in the isolated atrium. Angiotensin II-induced positive chronotropic and slight inotropic effects were not influenced by treatment with the beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents, propranolol and carteolol, but significantly suppressed by saralasin which has been reported to be a competitive antagonist of angiotensin II. From these results, it is suggested that angiotensin II induced a positive chronotropic and slight positive inotropic effect via angiotensin II receptors in the dog heart.", 
    "9": "The possibility that propranolol may exert its beneficial actions in thyrotoxicosis by an effect on thyroid hormone concentrations has been investigated by measuring these and oxygen consumption in a group of thyrotoxic patients before and after treatment with propranolol. Following treatment a significant fall in plasma T3 concentration and oxygen consumption occurred and a direct correlation was found between these two variables. Propranolol may, therefore, exert some of its beneficial effects in thyrotoxicosis by an action on T3 metabolism.", 
    "10": "1. The 24 h urinary excretion of kallikrein has been studied in 40 normotensive control subjects and in 74 age-matched patients with essential hypertension under similar conditions. By use of the renin-sodium index, hypertensive patients were divided into two subgroup: low-renin hypertension and normal-renin hypertension patients. Urinary kallikrein determinations were also obtained from six hypertensive patients with primary aldosteronism. 2. Urinary kallikrein was significantly lower both in patients with normal-renin and low-renin essential hypertension. Urinary kallikrein excretion was very high in the patients with primary aldosteronism. 3. In nine hypertensive patients beta-adreno-receptor-blocking therapy caused a significant decrease of plasma renin activity, but had no significant effect on urinary kallikrein excretion. 4. The results support the concept that low urinary kallikrein is likely to be a marker of essential hypertension. Under certain conditions its excretion is positively related to mineralocorticoid hormone concentrations but it is not primarily related to the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "11": "1 The effects of the combined alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug, labetalol, on the uptake of [3H]-(-)-noradrenaline into the isolated vas deferens of the rat have been determined and compared with those of some other alpha-adrenoceptor blocking drugs and cocaine. 2 Labetalol, like cocaine, produced a simple competitive inhibition of [3H]-(-)-noradrenaline uptake and was about 4 times less potent than cocaine. It is concluded that labetalol is a potent inhibitor of uptake1. Phentolamine and thymoxamine also inhibited [3H]-(-)-noradrenaline uptake, and were respectively 8 and 14 times less potent than cocaine. Tolazoline, piperoxan and yohimbine were inactive in concentrations up to 30 microgram/ml. 3 The uptake1 blocking action of labetalol could explain, at least in part, the previously reported difference in its ability to block noradrenaline and phenylephrine vasopressor responses in the anaesthetized dog. 4 The possibility that uptake1 inhibitory concentrations of labetalol could be present in the blood of subjects receiving normal antihypertensive doses of the drug is discussed.", 
    "12": "Of 60 patients referred for management of drug-refractory ventricular tachyarrhythmias, 10 (17%) had mitral-valve prolapse. These 10 patients ranged in age from 19 to 70 years (mean, 47 years); seven were women. All 10 had recurrent ventricular tachycardia, while four had a history of ventricular fibrillation. Nine patients were refractory to propranolol in combination with one or more of the standard antiarrhythmic agents. All showed improvement with aprindine therapy. The results show that refractory malignant ventricular prolapse syndrome; patients with mitral-valve prolapse account for a rather high percentage of those patients referred with recurrent drug-refractory ventricular tachyarrhythmias; in patients with unexplained ventricular arrhythmias, mitral-valve prolapse should be considered; and aprindine may be effective for ventricular tachyarrhythmias associated with mitral-valve prolapse.", 
    "13": "Isolated rat livers were perfused with propranolol and other drugs in a simplified recirculation system without plasma proteins or erythrocytes. The propranolol levels in the reservoir declined biphasically. The first phase was rapid and almost flow-limited despite use of high perfusion flow rates. This rapid uptake generated liver/perfusate ratios greater than 25 and was not significantly diminished by lowering the temperature or removing oxygen from the system. It appeared to reflect one or more physical binding processes. Autoradiography showed high concentrations of propranolol in the periportal zones of the liver lobule. The second, slower phase of uptake was associated with metabolism of propranolol to other compounds and was temperature, oxygen and concentration dependent. A number of drugs inhibited the slow phase but had little effect on the rapid uptake phase. Several of these drugs were able to displace small amounts of propranolol from the liver.", 
    "14": "A rapid, specific, high-pressure liquid chromatographic determination of atenolol in plasma and urine was developed. This method employs the high sensitivity of fluorescence detection together with selective extraction and reversed-phase chromatography to measure concentrations as low as 20 ng of drug/ml of plasma with a coefficient of variation of 3.91%. The assay is specific enough to be valid in the presence of plasma and urine substances. The detection limit (i.e., three times baseline noise) is 3 ng/ml.", 
    "15": "PGE1, PGE2, and PGF2alpha over a dose range of 1 to 50 microgram/kg decreased the number of circulating eosinophils in splenectomized rats. Pretreatment with a beta-blocking agent, propranolol, did not alter this effect, but adrenalectomy eliminated it. Anterior hypothalamic destruction also abolished eosinopenia induced by PGE1 and PGF2alpha but not that induced by PGE2.", 
    "16": "The changes in left ventricular (LV) dynamics induced by brief periods of ischemia (100 seconds) and subsequent reperfusion were analyzed in conscious dogs. Global LV ischemia, induced by partially occluding the left main coronary artery, reduced LV flow homogeneously and impaired LV function as reflected by decreases in LV stroke \"work\" (89 +/- 4% M +/- SE), systolic shortening (72 +/- 4%), velocity of shortening (56 +/- 6%), LV systolic pressure (34 +/- 5%), and dP/dt (59 +/- 6%). Regional LV ischemia, induced by occluding either the left circumflex or anterior descending coronary artery completely, reduced flow to the ischemic segment (82 +/- 3%) while decreasing segment work (96 +/- 5%), shortening (82 +/- 3%), and velocity of shortening (70 +/- 5%), with minimal depression of overall LV function. In both groups the extent of shortening was reduced more rapidly and greater (P less than 0.01) than shortening velocity. Moreover, with localized ischemia, segment work was reduced more (P less than 0.01) than shortening. With reperfusion, a transient overshoot in function above preischemic control levels was observed in both groups (global work increased by 60 +/- 12% and regional work by 28 +/- 4% above control). This overshoot was not dependent on adrenergic mechanisms, but was prevented by inhibiting reactive hyperemia. Thus myocardial ischemia induces a dissociation between extent and rate of myocardial shortening. A further dissociation between shortening and work is apparent with regional ischemia. After reperfusion there is a transient overshoot in function which appears to be dependent upon the associated reactive hyperemia.", 
    "17": "Heart rate responses to three different procedures (amyl nitrite inhalation, standing up, and isoproterenol infusion), were studied before and during acute adrenergic beta blockade with intravenous propranolol in three normal and six hypertensive subjects. Propranolol decreased, but did not completely abolish, the heart rate increase produced by amyl nitrite and standing, probably because of vagal participation (withdrawal) in heart rate increase produced by baroreceptor hypotension (amyl nitrite) and on assuming the upright posture. Heart rate responses to amyl nitrite varied greatly from patient to patient (from 27 to 97%), but the drug proved to be the most potent stimulus for heart rate increase as a result of its marked hypotensive effect. However, this vasodilator-induced acute hypotension was well tolerated, and without deleterious hemodynamic consequences, despite the presence of beta blockade. Different degrees of correlation in heart rate increase were observed with the three procedures, reflecting probably the varying sympathetic-parasympathetic participation in reflex heart rate control. It is concluded that from the clinical stand point, neither amyl nitrite administration nor standing up can be used as a test to assess acurately the degree of beta blockade, because both procedures activate vagal withdrawal which increases heart rate regardless of the degree of beta blockade.", 
    "18": "The metabolic conversion of propranolol to propranolol-diol [1-(1-naphthyloxy)-2,3-propyleneglycol] by rat liver 9000g supernatant was demonstrated to proceed through the intermediate 3-naphthyloxy-2-hydroxypropionaldehyde. Using side chain deuterated propranolol-d5 as substrate, propranolol-diol-d4 was produced, indicating an obligatory aldehyde intermediate. Analysis of desisopropylpropranolol obtained in the same incubation showed no loss of deuterium indicating that the possibility of rapidly tautomerizing imine intermediate did not make a significant contribution in this metabolic conversion. Desisopropylpropranolol, added in small amounts to the incubation mixture is more rapidly converted to the propranolol-diol than is propranolol, indicating that the major pathway of conversion of propranolol to its diol metabolite is through the desisopropylpropranolol intermediate.", 
    "19": "Fifty-two percent of patients with chronic heavy intake of ethanol had an abnormally low growth hormone (GH) response to propranolo-glucagon. The effect of ethanol is transient, since the GH response was normal in patients studied 2 wk or more after withdrawal of ethanol. The low GH response was not due to a difference in the levels of glucose or insulin. Ethanol probably suppresses the GH response by acting on the hypothalamus or pituitary gland. Along with previous data suggesting transient ACTH deficiency in chronic alcoholic patients, our findings suggest that these patients may have multiple hypothalamic-pituitary deficiencies.", 
    "20": "Ethanol has a positive chronotropic and negative inotropic effect on isolated spontaneously beating rabbit atria. Both effects increased with increasing ethanol concentrations in the bathing medium. This response is apparently a direct action of ethanol on the myocardium and is not due to the release of catecholamines, acetylcholine, or acetaldehyde produced by the oxidative metabolism of ethanol. Ethanol is one of the few pharmacologic agents having opposite actions on heart rate and force of contraction.", 
    "21": "A ten-week, double-masked, randomized, clinical trial compared timolol ophthalmic solution and pilocarpine in the therapy of open-angle glaucoma. Timolol decreased the intraocular pressure at least as much as pilocarpine and did not induce miosis, accommodative spasm, or other annoying side effects. The pulse was slowed by timolol, but blood pressure was unaffected. Significant decreases in intraocular pressure were still present after ten weeks of maintenance therapy with the same concentration of drug.", 
    "22": "1 The mode of action of hypotensive drugs is not necessarily the same early and late in a course of treatment. 2 It was aimed to study this possible difference of effects for the drugs debrisoquine and propranolol, using a clinical trial design and measuring as many cardiovascular functions as possible by noninvasive methods in out-patients. 3 Several well known effects of these drugs were noted; in addition it was found that in some subjects there was a small but progressive salt retention during propranolol treatment, that the displacements of the slopes in baroceptor function tests were different for the two drugs tested, and that venous distensibility was reduced at first with propranolol but soon increased again. 4 It is useful to combine longitudinal measures of body functions with a clinical trial when studying mechanisms of drug action.", 
    "23": "Since both propranolol therapy and saphenous-vein bypass surgery have become accepted treatments for patients with symptomatic coronary-artery disease, it is important to determine if either influences the prevalence of ventricular arrhythmias in these patients. Six-hour dynamic electrocardiography was done on 130 patients with chronic stable angina pectoris at least 1 year after being randomized to surgical or medical therapy. All surgical patients had saphenous-vein grafting; 90% of the medical patients received propranolol. Data analysis showed that even though the overall prevalence of premature ventricular contractions was no different in medical and surgical patients, the prevalence of complex premature ventricular contractions was significantly higher in surgically treated patients not receiving propranolol than in propranolol-treated medical patients (p less than 0.05). However, the survival rate was no different in either group, and the quality of life in the surgical patients remained superior.", 
    "24": "An investigation of the cerebral circulation by the thermoelectric method showed that stimulation of the cervical sympathetic nerve leads to considerable changes in the blood supply to the brain. The changes in blood flow are biphasic in character: An initial small increase is followed by a decrease below the original level. Pharmacological analysis with alpha and beta adreno-blockers showed that the constrictor response of the cerebral vessels is due to excitation of alpha-adrenergic structures and the dilator response to excitation of beta-adrenergic structures. A possible mechanism of these changes is postulated.", 
    "25": "Effects of serotonin on alpha-adrenergic receptors of isolated hamsters' atria preparation were investigated. The positive chronotropic effect of serotonin on isolated atria of the hamster is not related with postsynaptic alpha-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "26": "Dibutyryl 3', 5'-cyclic AMP induced automatic activity in Purkinje fibers of myocardial strip in the rat. The phenomenon was not affected by beta adrenergic blockade.", 
    "27": "With the aim of investigating whether exogenous noradrenaline (NA) and adrenaline (A) can modulate transmitter release via the stimulation of presynaptic beta-adrenoceptors, 3H-release from isolated portal veins was studied after pretreatment with 3H-1-NA, phenoxybenzamine, desipramine and normetanephrine. NA (10 muM) and A (0.05 muM) increased the fractional 3H-release elicited by sympathetic nerve stimulation by 30%. This effect could be blocked by d, 1-propranolol which per se reduced the release by 10%. It is concluded that NA can facilitate its own release via a presynaptic beta-adrenoceptor-mediated positive feed-back mechanism and that adrenaline can stimulate this beta-adrenoceptor-mediated mechanism.", 
    "28": "Using the \"double indicator\" technique the ability of 3H-isoproterenol and 14C-propranolol to cross the blood-brain barrier was studied in man. In 3 subjects extraction of isoproterenol was 3.8% in a single passage and the PS product was 2.0 ml/100g/min. In 4 patients extraction of propranolol was 63% and PS was 46.7 ml/100/min. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was studied in man with the 133Xe-intraarterial injection method. Intracarotid isoproterenol (3 migrogram/min., 6 patients) caused a significant reduction in rCBF, but after correction for a concomitant decrease in arterial PCO2 the alteration was no longer significant (59.8 -51.7/57.4 ml/100g/min.). Intracarotid propranolol (0.15 mg/kg, 11 patients) caused no significant change in rCBF, but after correction for arterial PCO2 change the lateration although on 4% was just significant, p less than 0.05. (56.3 -55.8/54.1 ml/100g/min). After propranolol the rCBF changes caused by alterations in the arterial PCO2 were normal and the focal flow increase during hand work could not be changed by simultaneous intracarotid propranolol.", 
    "29": "The hemodynamic effect of a beta-receptor blockade with mepindolol--a noncardioselective beta-receptor blocker--was studied in 6 male test subjects age 25 to 30 years with an increasing dose of isoproterenol. The cardiac output per min, the heart rate and the stroke volume, the wet blood pressure and the contractility parameters dp/dt max in the right and left ventricles were measured as part of the study. It was found that a dissociated right shift of the dose-effect curves occurred for the stroke volume, contractility parameters and heart rate. The following major conclusions can be made from an exact analysis of this result: 1. Evidence was produced that a distinction must be made in man with respect to the so-called beta1-receptors between those which mediate a specific effect on the heart rate and those which mediate a primarily positively inotropic effect. 2. There are apparently some beta-receptor blockers which inhibit the frequency receptors primarily and the inotropic receptors to a lesser extent. 3. Through their beta 2-effect, noncardioselective beta-receptor blockers can partly compensate for their negatively inotropic effect on the heart by maintaining the Frank Starling mechanism.", 
    "30": "Effects of propranolol on ischemic segmental function were studied in anesthetized open-chest dogs. Two segment-length gauges were used for measuring the regional myocardial function: one was sutured on to the left ventricular surface perfused by the anterior descending coronary artery (ischemic zone) and the other was on to that perfused by the circumflex coronary artery (normal zone). A bolus of propranolol (0.5 mg/kg) was injected into the right femoral vein. Five min later, the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) was completely occluded for one mine and thereafter released. Then a second coronary occlusion for 20 min was performed; an interval of 20 min was allowed between two occlusions. Propranolol, in the ischemic segment, apparently decreased the extent of paradoxical lengthening in the late systole following one min LAD occlusion, and facilitated improvement of segmental function after release of the occlusion. Moreover, the extent of abnormal stretching induced by 20 min occlusion during early systole, was also reduced by propranolol pretreatment. In contrast, compensatory increase in shortening by the normal segment was disturbed by propranolol. These results suggest that propranolol might exert a favourable influence on the segmental myocardial function during either transient or maintained myocardial ischemia.", 
    "31": "The place of diuretics in the treatment of hypertension (HT) no longer requires to be proved, but their mode of action remains uncertain. Blood volume measurements allow us to distinguish the cases of HT which are volume-dependent, and which constitute the major indication for this type of treatment. The various groups of diuretics have a specific action on the renal tubule, but may all lead to complications, which imply that their use should be rational and that biochemical follow-up should be close when they are administered for a prolonged period. Used singly, diuretics effectively suppress HT in 40 per cent of cases, and when used in association with a beta-blocker, they produce normal blood pressure in 70 per cent of cases.", 
    "32": "Cardiac electrophysiologic action of a new beta-adrenergic blocking agent carteolol hydrochloride, or OPC-1085, was studied in either isolated, perfused rabbit hearts or in atrial, ventricular or Purkinje fibers of dogs and rabbits superfused in the tissue bath. Transmembrane potentials were recorded with intracellular microelectrodes and atrioventricular conduction was studied by recording a His bundle electrogram. OPC-1085 at a concentration of 0.1 mg/L shortened the sinus node recovery time, while propranolol at a comparable concentration prolonged it. Isoproterenol-enhanced canine Purkinje automaticity was more markedly depressed by OPC-1085 than by propranolol. In rabbit atrial and ventricular muscle, OPC-1085 up to the concentration of 2 mg/L did not alter the action potential characteristics but tended to shorten the conduction time. At 20 mg/L, OPC-1085 significantly decreased the maximal rate of depolarization and maximal following frequency, and prolonged the action potential duration and conduction time in non-reserpinized as well as reserpinized preparations. On atrioventricular conduction, 0.1 mg/l to 5mg/L of this drug prolonged the St-A and H-V intervals but tended to shorten the A-H interval. All these intervals were prolonged at 20 mg/L. The action potential duration of canine Purkinje-ventricular block developed at higher frequencies of stimulation. In view of the clinical dosage levels, it is sugg ested that the antiarrhythmic effects of OPC-1085 depend predominantly on its beta blocking action. At higher concentrations, OPC-1085 may exert some beta stimulating action, whereas still higher and possibly toxic concentrations could depress conduction through a direct membrane effect.", 
    "33": "The effect of beta adrenergic blockade on the increase in plasma renin activity produced by acute respiratory acidosis was studied in chloralose anesthetized dogs. Sixteen mongrel dogs were given 4%, 8% and 12% CO2 in room air, successively. Propranolol (2 mg/Kg) was given to 8 dogs prior to CO2 inhalation. The other 8 dogs served as the control group. The response of elevated plasma renin activity during 4% and 8% CO2 inhalation was not different between the control and propranolol groups. However, the increase of plasma renin activity in the control group was greater than that of the propranolol treated group during 12% CO2 inhalation. It is suggested that activation of beta adrenergic receptors is not the sole factor in renin control during acute respiratory acidosis, although these receptors do mediate a significant fraction of the renin response to CO2 inhalation.", 
    "34": "Central depressant actions of a new beta-adrenergic blocking agent, indenolol (YB-2), and its dextro isomer were studied in mice and rabbits. d-Indenolol was less active than dl-indenolol in lowering of methamphetamine group toxicity and calming of fighting behavior, though muscle relaxant, hypolocomotive and anticonvulsant effects of d-indenolol were virtually equal to those of the racemate. dl-Propranolol showed a similar profile of central depressant actions to dl-indenolol, whereas dl-practolol revealed no significant central effects in mice. The dose-response relationship between beta-blocking and central effects in the same animal species suggested that both taming and anti-methamphetamine group toxicity effects of dl-indenolol s.c. do not directly relate to either the peripheral beta-blocking or the membrane stabilizing activity. Intravenous as well as intracerebroventricular administration of dl-indenolol resulted in suppression of pressor responses to the electrical stimulation of the brain stem of unanesthetized rabbits. Neither d-indenolol nor dl-practolol was effective against the pressor responses, suggesting that these two compounds acted on the CNS in a manner different from dl-indenolol even when intracerebroventricularly administered. A possible central beta-adrenergic blocking effect of dl-indenolol was discussed in the light of mechanisms of an antihypertensive action of this compound.", 
    "35": "Two isomeric methoxyhydroxy metabolites of propranolol have been identified in man during chronic antihypertensive propranolol therapy. The identification was based on the mass-spectral fragmentation pattern of their trifluoroacetylated derivatives. Both isomers were detected in urine as well as in plasma, mainly as glucuronic acid and/or sulfate conjugates. The amounts of these metabolites excreted in urine were linearly related (r = 0.84) to the oral propranolol dose, 10--320 mg per day. Plasma concentrations at the 320-mg daily dose ranged from 20 to 112 ng/ml. Similar isomeric methoxyhydroxy metabolites of propranolol containing a glycol or a lactic acid side-chain were also identified.", 
    "36": "Ferret trachea and bronchus contract to carbachol greater than 5-HT greater than bradykinin (BK) greater than PGF2alpha greater than histamine greater than 2-methylhistamine (2-MeH: a specific H1-receptor agonist). Rat trachea is insensitive to the spasmogenic actions of histamine, 2-MeH, PGF2alpha, BK and 5-HT. Ferret trachea and bronchus and rat trachea (which were partially contracted to carbachol) relax to isoproterenol greater than PGE1 greater than E2 greater than 4-methyl-histamine (4-MeH: a specific H2-histamine receptor agonist). High doses of histamine also relax rat trachea. The contractions of ferret airways to 2-MeH coupled with the antagonism of histamine-induced contractions by mepyramine showed the presence of H1-histamine receptors in the trachea and bronchus of ferret. After H1-blockade, the relaxant responses to histamine on ferret bronchus and trachea, and rat trachea were not affecte by \"specific\" doses of burimamide, metiamide, and cimetidine (H2-receptor antagonists), indomethacin (PG-synthetase inhibitor) and propranolol (a beta-adrenoceptor blocker). These results appear to suggest the existence of an atypical histamine receptor subtype (i.e. not of the classical H1 or H2 type) in the airways of rat and ferret.",

Unlike pilocarpine, the mainstay of glaucoma treatment for the last 100 years, beta-blocking agents do not contract the pupil nor interfere with vision even in patients with central lens opacities. They also do not cause spasm of the ciliary muscle producing transient myopia and disturbance of accommodation. Paradoxically, one of these agents, timolol, causes a fall in intraocular pressure when administered locally even in patients responding to beta-agonists with a reduction in intraocular pressure. Concomitant administration of timolol with epinephrine seems to enhance its ocular hypotensive effect in many patients. The exact mode of action of beta-blockers in reducing intraocular pressure is unknown but appears to primarily reduce aqueous production. This new class of drugs seems destined to play an important role in the treatment as well as in the understanding of glaucoma.", 
    "38": "Experiments were designed to investigate responses of immunoreactive parathyroid hormone (PTH) during alpha-adrenergic stimulation and blockade in cows. Alpha-adrenergic agonists (methoxamine, phenylephrine and noradrenaline, the beta-adrenergic action of which was blocked by propranolol) did not change PTH and free fatty acid levels, whereas they characteristically increased the blood pressure and decreased the heart rate. In contrast, alpha-adrenergic blockade by phentolamine progressively increased PTH levels. The elevated PTH concentrations, associated with increased plasma noradrenaline and free fatty acid levels, rising heart rate and decreasing blood pressure, indicated that all these changes can be related to a beta-adrenergic stimulatory mechanism. Beta-adrenergic stimulation was presumably responsible for the initial elevation of PTH concentrations, whereas, during the later phase of the phentolamine infusions, a concomitant hypocalcaemia probably also produced a stimulatory effect.", 
    "39": "A fluorescent analogue of propranolol, 9-AAP, was injected intravenously in order to detect beta-adrenergic receptors in the anterior segment of the albino rat eye. Specific 9-AAP fluorescence was noted along cell membranes of the ciliary epithelium and to lesser extent in the walls of blood vessels in the ciliary processes and episclera at the limbus. The iris showed maximum 9-AAP binding in the region of the sphincter muscle. These data suggest that 9-AAP may label beta receptors in the anterior segment of the rat eye.", 
    "40": "1. A human cancer cell line (COLO 16) derived originally from an epidermal squamous cell carcinoma was found to possess adenylate cyclase responsiveness to beta-adrenergic agonists. 2. The adenylate cyclase response was characterized with respect to activation constants (KA) for various beta-adrenergic agonists and inhibition constants (Ki) for antagonists. 3. Intact cells responded with dose-dependent increases in production of cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate. 4. Properties of the beta-adrenergic receptor were evaluated by using the specific binding of [3H]propranolol to cell membranes. Specific binding was saturable, with KD 5.79 nmol/l and binding sites 0.68 pmol/mg of protein. 5. Competition for binding to cell membranes was shown by beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists and was stereospecific. There was close agreement between the affinity of these various agents on adenylate cyclase and receptor binding. 6. It is likely that the beta-adrenergic receptor-linked adenylate cyclase in COLO 16 cells represents persistence in a cancer cell line of a receptor present normally in epidermal cells.", 
    "41": "1 In spontaneously active Purkinje fibres of young cows the dose-response curves of the action of isoprenaline upon different electrophysiological parameters were measured.2 The increase in slope of diastolic depolarization could roughly be described by a one-for-one binding curve with a half maximum effect near 10(-8) M and the increase in the height of the plateau level by a two-for-one binding curve with a half maximum effect near 10(-7) M (-)-isoprenaline.3 These dose-response curves were similar to those of two parameters measured under voltage clamp conditions by other authors. The increase in slope of diastolic depolarization behaved like the shift of the activation curve for the pacemaker potassium current towards positive potentials and the growth in plateau height like the increase in the slow inward current mainly carried by Ca ions. From this conformity we propose that the parameters evaluated by us from action potential records could be used for a qualitative analysis of the action of catecholamines on pacemaker potassium current and Ca influx.4 The effects of the isomers of a new drug, 1-isopropylamino-3(4'hydroxyphenoxy)-propan-2-ol (IHP), were evaluated in the same way as those of isoprenaline. The (-)-isomer was at optimal concentrations (10(-5) M) nearly half as effective as isoprenaline in increasing frequency and slope of diastolic depolarization but caused no increase in plateau height. An identical relationship, but at 5 to 10 times higher concentrations, was obtained with the (+)-isomer.5 When 10(-4) M(-)-IHP was added to a preparation equilibrated with a maximum dose of (-)-isoprenaline (10(-6) M), frequency and plateau height declined. This result together with the observation that the effects of IHP could be blocked by the specific beta-antagonist propranolol, revealed the beta-agonistic nature of the new drug. Its inefficiency in increasing the plateau height and thus the slow (Ca) inward current was explained by its relatively low potency and intrinsic activity.", 
    "42": "1. The inhibitory effects were studied of 4 beta-adrenoceptor antagonists against renin release induced by isoprenaline (0.5 mumol/1) in rat kidney slices. Additionally the pA2 values of these 4 drugs were measured against isoprenaline in guinea-pig isolated atria and trachea (against beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors respectively). 2 When employed at a concentration of 2 mumol/1 propranolol and atenolol significantly inhibited renin release (P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.01) whereas practolol and IPS 339 [t-butyl-amino-3 ol-2 propyl) oximino-9 fluorene] had little effect. 2 A positive correlation was shown between the degree of inhibition of renin release and the pA2 of the antagonists at the beta1-adrenoceptors. 4 When practolol and IPS 339 were used in equipotent molar concentrations to propranolol for the beta1-adrenoceptors they inhibited renin release. 5 The results suggest that the adrenoceptor involved in the renin release induced by isoprenaline in the rat kidney is of the beta1-type.", 
    "43": "The thirst induced by transfer of rats from air at 5 degrees C to air at 25 degrees C (thermogenic drink) was inhibited by d,1-, but not d-propranolol (6 mg/kg body weight) administered 0.5 h prior to removal from cold. The thermogenic drink was not inhibited by a similar administration of the beta1-adrenergic antagonist, practolol (50 and 150 mg/kg body weight), but was inhibited by the beta2-adrenergic antagonist, butoxamine (35 mg/kg body weight). The results are consistent with the suggestion that beta2-adrenergic receptors play a role in mediation of the thermogenic drink in rats.", 
    "44": "Oxotremorine, 0.25 mg/kg, produces marked tremor in the rat, which is abolished by scopolamine, 0.5 mg/kg, and is substantially reduced in intensity and duration both by adrenalmedullectomy and by chemical sympathectomy with 6-hydroxydopamine. Oxotremorine increases plasma norepinephrine from 0.62 +/- 0.07 to 3.01 +/- 0.47 ng/ml and plasma epinephrine, from 0.82 +/- 0.14 to 3.42 +/- 0.48 ng/ml, in conscious unrestrained rats. l-Propranolol (0.5-2.5 mg/kg) reduces tremor, and at 2.5 mg/kg is more effective than either chemical sympathectomy or adrenal demedullation. d-Propranolol and sotalol are also active at 4 and 10 times the dose of l-propranolol, respectively. l-Propranolol does not prevent the rise in catecholamines induced by oxotremorine. It is suggested that stimulation of central muscarinic receptors causes tremor by a combination of two effects. There is an increase in cholinergic influence to motor efferents accompanied by an activation of the sympathoadrenal system to release catecholamines which augment tremor by stimulation of beta2 adrenoceptors.", 
    "45": "Nadolol was extracted from tablet excipients with an acidic potassium chloride solution. The drug was oxidized with periodic acid, and the resulting aldehyde was reacted with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine to form the corresponding hydrazone. Excess reagent was removed with a cupric chloride solution. The hydrazone was extracted into chloroform, and its absorbance was measured at the 352-nm maximum.", 
    "46": "A sensitive radioimmunoassay for beta-endorphin is described. Antibodies against human beta-endorphin which exhibit a high avidity for the C-terminal of the peptide were raised in rabbits following the injection of thyroglobulin-coupled human beta-endorphin (betah-E) as immunogen. Methionine-enkephalin, alpha-, gamma-endorphine, as well as ACTH peptides did not cause interference in the radioimmunoassay. beta-Lipotropin, however, showed a 50% cross-reactivity. The sensitivity of the assay is 25 pg/0.5 ml tube volume for beta-endorphin. beta-Endorphin was extracted with a high recovery from the rat plasma using silicic acid and beta-endorphin levels as low as 100 pg/ml could be measured. Basal levels of beta-endorphin-like immunoreactivity in plasma of rats were about 400 pg/ml. beta-Endorphin levels in adrenalectomized rats and in animals chronically treated with the cortisol synthesis blocker metyrapone were found to be markedly increased (about 7-fold). Exposure of the rats to electrically induced footshocks caused a similar increase of immunoreactive beta-endorphin in plasma. A significant increase was also seen after insulin injection.", 
    "47": "The in vivo activity of rat-parotid isoamylases was increased following alpha-receptor block by phentolamine. Additional inhibition of the beta-receptors by propranolol did not further augment the isoenzyme activities. After 21 days, the isoamylase concentrations were even lower than after alpha-receptor block alone. Based upon these results, an alpha-receptor mediated discharge from the duct system of already secreted gland protein and a possible role of the alpha-receptors in protein secretion from the parotid gland are discussed.", 
    "48": "The heart-rates of surgeons were recorded by ambulatory monitoring methods while they operated and while they conducted surgical outpatient clinics. Heart-rates during operations were also monitored 1 hour after the surgeons had taken an oral dose of 40 mg oxprenolol. During operations the mean heart-rate of 8 surgeons was 121/min with maximum rates in some cases of over 150/min. The tachycardia was abolished by 40 mg of oxprenolol which reduced heart-rates during operations to below those recorded during surgical outpatient clinics. Physical work necessary to reproduce the mean heart-rate whilst operating could not be sustained for more than 10--15 min.", 
    "49": "1) Plasma renin activity (PRA) response to isometric exercise was studied before and after the intravenous administration of 0.2 mg/kg of propranolol in 8 normotensive and 10 normal renin hypertensive patients. 2) Handgrip exercise at the 30% level of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) for four minutes induced a significant increase in PRA in either normotensive or normal renin hypertensive patients, while the increase in PRA in normal renin hypertensive patients was significantly higher than that in normotensive patients. 3) Pretreatment with the administration of propranolol inhibited an increase in PRA after handgrip exercise in either normotensive or normal renin hypertensive patients. 4) The results suggest that isometric handgrip exercise can induce an augmentation in renin release mainly by stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system in either normotensive or normal renin hypertensive patients. The possible mechanism of the exaggerated response in PRA to handgrip exercise in normal renin hypertensive patients has been discussed.", 
    "50": "A double-blind single-dose trial was performed on 13 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma. Metoprolol 1%, 2%, and 4% produced a median fall in IOP of 5.6, 5.4, and 6.8 mm Hg, respectively, in the treated eye. The differences in effect between the 1%, 2%, and 4% solutions were not statistically significant. There was no significant fall in IOP in the untreated eyes. There were no significant changes in blood pressure, pulse rate, or pupillary diameter. We could not detect any local objective or subjective side effects during the single-dose study. The clinical usefulness of metoprolol may be limited due to local toxic reactions after treatment with multiple doses. Furthermore, there is the problem of tachyphylaxis that could limit extended treatment with topical beta-adrenergic blocking drugs.", 
    "51": "In animals and man the antidysrhythmic agent disopyramide in primarily metabolised by mono-N-dealkylation. The effects of disopyramide and its N-dealkylated metabolite (MIP) have been investigated using isolated cardiac and nervous tissue, and their effects have been compared with the effects of other antidysrhythmic agents. Disopyramide, d,l-propranolol and quinidine all decreased both maximum driving frequency and developed tension in electrically driven guinea pit atria. MIP and procaine amide also decreased maximum driving frequency, but had a positive intropic effect. MIP was only 4 times less active than disopyramide in decreasing maximum driving frequency. There was no evidence that either disopyramide or MIP possessed beta-adrenoceptor antagonist properties. In superfused rat sciatic nerves, it has been shown that neither disopyramide nor MIP possesses significant local anaesthetic properties. Procaine amide and lignocaine were highly active in this test. The possible contribution of MIP to the actions of disopyramide in vivo is discussed.", 
    "52": "Guanosine 5'-tetraphosphate (GTP4) stimulated mammalian adenylate cyclase activity at concentrations down to 1 micronM. Greater stimulatory activity was apparent with lung than with heart, brain or liver from the rat. At a concentration of 0.1 mM, GTP4 stimulated lung adenylate cyclase activity from rat, guinea pig and mouse about four-fold. Other guanine nucleotides such as GTP, GDP, GMP, guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate and 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate (GMP.PNP) also stimulated mammalian adenylate cyclase activity. EMP.PNP irreversibly activated, whereas GTP4 and GTP reversibly activated adenylate cyclase. Adenosine 5'-tetraphosphate (ATP4) stimulated rat lung and liver but inhibited rat heart and brain adenylate cyclase activities. Lung from guinea pig and mouse were not affected by ATP4. The formation of cyclic AMP by GTP4-stimulated rat lung adenylate cyclase was verified by Dowex-50 (H+), Dowex 1-formate and polyethyleneimine cellulose column chromatography. GTP4 was at least three times more potent than 1-isoproterenol in stimulating rat lung adenylate cyclase activity. The beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol blocked the effect of 1-isoproterenol but not that of GTP4, thus, suggesting that GTP4 and beta-adrenergic agonists interact with different receptor sites on membrane-bound adenylate cyclase. Stimulation of rat lung and liver adenylate cyclase activities with 1-isoproterenol was potentiated by either GTP4 or GMP.PNP, thus indicating that GTP4 resembles other guanine nucleotides in their capacity to increase the sensitivity of adenylate cyclase to beta-adrenergic agonists. Stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity by guanine derivatives requires one or more free phosphate moieties on the 5 position of ribose, as no effect was elicited with guanine, guanosine, guanosine 2'-monophosphate, guanosine 3'-monophosphate or guanosine 2',5'-monophosphate. Ribose, ribose 5-phosphate, phosphate and pyrophosphate were inactive. Pyrimidine nucleoside mono-, di-, tri- and tetraphosphates elicited negligible effects on mammalian adenylate cyclase activity.", 
    "53": "The investigation examined the mechanism of the increase in brain tryptophan concentration of rats treated with d-amphetamine. Certain well recognised influences upon brain tryptophan have been excluded as responsible. Thus, the effect is not associated with changes in the plasma concentrations of NEFA or free tryptophan. It is probably not due to a tryptophan-specific mechanism, because amphetamine increases the ratio of brain/plasma concentrations not only of tryptophan but also of tyrosine and phenylalanine. The concentration ratios for liver/plasma also rose, as did the liver tryptophan concentration, but these changes were less striking than for brain. Both alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocking drugs opposed the changes in brain, but in different ways. Thus, after treatment of rats with phentolamine, amphetamine decreased the plasma concentrations of the three aromatic amino acids; however, as the brain concentrations were little altered, the brain/plasma concentration ratios rose. Propranolol (and the dopamine blocker pimozide) opposed the increases of the ratios, so that the brain concentrations again altered little. The increased brain/plasma ratios resulting from the administration of amphetamine were associated with hyperthermia. Propranolol, pimozide and the diabetogenic drug streptozotocin opposed the changes in both plasma and brain; phentolamine affected neither. Despite the increase in brain tryptophan caused by amphetamine this drug had relatively little concurrent effect on 5HT synthesis. Experiments with adrenergic blockers suggest that the small rise of plasma insulin after the injection of amphetamine into rats did not cause the brain changes; these are probably a consequence of hyperthermia. The findings with streptozotocin suggest that the hyperthermic effect of amphetamine is manifested only in states of normal insulin secretion.", 
    "54": "In this article shall be referred to a special form of reaction of the ST-T-complexes in the propranolol test. Instead of a normalisation of this section of the ECG an inverse reaction develops. It consists in the fact that after application of propranolol the negativities of the T-waves increase and the lowerings of the ST-distances deepen. They appear most frequently after an acute heart attack, such as after a spontaneous angina pectoris, and they can be reproduced only during some days. It is supposed that the cooperation of acute ischaemic myocardial processes with negative sequelae of the blockade of beta-receptors are responsible for this inverse reaction.", 
    "55": "1. Value and limitations of the precordial Xenon-clearance technique are analyzed. The results of this technique are compared to the scintigraphic display of the initial Xenon distribution and to microsphere scintigraphy (Engel et al. 1976a). 2. The effects of coronary obstructions and of segmental LV dysfunction on regional myocardial blood flow are analyzed (Engel et al. 1977). Independent of coronary obstructions, a clear reduction of regional myocardial blood flow in areas of hypokinesis and akinesis was observed. Thus in coronary disease a decrease of regional myocardial blood flow may represent either a cause or a result of abnormal segmental wall motion. 3. The effects of nitroglycerin, beta-blockade (Atenolol), calcium-antagonists (Nifedipine) and coronary dilatation (Dipyridamole) on regional myocardial blood flow were investigated (Engel et al. 1976b). Regional flow at rest decreased after nitroglycerin and beta-blockade, increased mildly after Nifedipine and markedly after Dipyridamole.", 
    "56": "22 pateints with a fixed, sometimes therapy-resistant (N = 18) hypertension were treated with a new antihypertensive agent, the pyridopyridazine derivative BQ 22-708 and hemodynamically investigated. 14 hypertensives received single oral doses of between 5 and 15 mg, 8 other patients also received additional treatment with a beta-receptor blocker (0.8 mg pindolol i.v.) or calcium antagonist (10 mg verapamil i.v.). In hypertension which is only poorly controllable or resistant, therapy with BQ 22-708 combined with beta-receptor offers a genuine alternative medication."
