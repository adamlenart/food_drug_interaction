    "0": "Fetal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and atrial flutter (AF) can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Digoxin is often used as first-line therapy but can be ineffective and is poorly transferred to the fetus in the presence of fetal hydrops. As an alternative to digoxin monotherapy, we have been using sotalol at presentation in fetuses with SVT or AF with, or at risk of, developing hydrops to attempt to achieve more rapid control of the arrhythmia. The present study was a retrospective review of the clinical, echocardiographic, and electrocardiographic data from all pregnancies with fetal tachycardia diagnosed and managed at a single center from 2004 to 2008. Of 29 affected pregnancies, 21 (16 SVT and 5 AF) were treated with sotalol at presentation, with or without concurrent administration of digoxin. Of the 21, 11 (6 SVT and 5 AF) had resolution of the tachycardia within 5 days (median 1). Six others showed some response (less frequent tachycardia, rate slowing, resolution of hydrops) without complete conversion. In 1 fetus with a slow response, the mother chose pregnancy termination. The 5 survivors with a slow response were all difficult to treat postnatally, including 1 requiring radiofrequency ablation as a neonate. One fetus developed blocked atrial extrasystoles after 1 dose of sotalol and was prematurely delivered for fetal bradycardia. Three grossly hydropic fetuses with SVT showed no response and died within 1 to 3 days of treatment. In conclusion, transplacental sotalol, alone or combined with digoxin, is effective for the treatment of fetal SVT and AF, with an 85% complete or partial response rate in our series.",

    "2": "Carvedilol is a nonselective \u03b2-blocker with \u03b11-adrenergic blocking and antioxidant properties. A number of preclinical experiments and clinical trials have demonstrated that carvedilol provides prominent benefit in heart failure. However, less research has been done in the area of animal models of viral myocarditis. This paper reviews the use of carvedilol in animal models of viral myocarditis. The experimental evidence strongly suggests that carvedilol, but not metoprolol (a selective \u03b21-adrenergic blocking agent), protects against viral myocarditis and the superior cardioprotection effect of carvedilol to metoprolol may be due to its upregulating the production of antiinflammatory cytokines, downregulating the production of proinflammatory cytokines, antioxidative effects, the suppression of matrix metalloproteinases production, and positive hemodynamic effects.", 
    "3": "Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the preferred reperfusion method in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) if it can be performed in a timely manner in high-volume centers. Regional STEMI networks improve timely access to PCI but are frequently criticized for being single center. To determine if results of regional STEMI systems could be replicated and achieve similar outcomes in 2 separate geographic regions, we examined the prospective databases of 2 large regional STEMI networks that use identical standardized protocols and integrated transfer systems. The Minneapolis Heart Institute (MHI) database included 2,266 patients with STEMI from 31 hospitals (498 at the PCI hospital, 1,033 transferred from 11 hospitals <60 miles away, and 735 transferred from 19 hospitals 60 to 210 miles away). The Iowa Heart Center (IHC) database included 1,206 patients with STEMI from 24 hospitals (710 at the PCI hospital, 266 transferred from 10 hospitals <60 miles away, and 230 transferred from 13 hospitals 60 to 120 miles away). Median total door-to-balloon times for the PCI hospital, zone 1, and zone 2 patients were 64, 95, and 123 minutes for the MHI and 59, 102, and 136 for the IHC (p <0.05 for each comparison between MHI and IHC). Overall in-hospital, 30-day, and 1-year mortalities was 4.8%, 5.4%, and 8.0% respectively (p = NS for each comparison between MHI and IHC). In conclusion, the use of identical protocols in 2 large regional STEMI systems in geographically separate locations produced nearly identical outcomes, adding to evidence that regional STEMI centers expand timely access to PCI.",

Because intra-temporomandibular joint formalin induces significantly different concentration-dependent responses among the three groups, with dioestrus females showing greater responses than males or proestrus females, equi-nociceptive formalin concentrations were used to test the effects of the \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonists.", 
    "6": "We found that atenolol, ICI 118.551 and SR59230A significantly reduced formalin-induced TMJ nociception in a dose response fashion in both males and females. However, a lower dose of each \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist was sufficient to significantly reduce nociceptive responses in females than in males. Administration of the highest doses of each \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist in the TMJ contralateral to that receiving formalin did not affect formalin-induced nociception in males and females, confirming the local action of the \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonists.", 
    "7": "We conclude that blockade of \u03b2-adrenoceptors in the temporomandibular joint suppresses formalin-induced TMJ nociceptive behaviour in both males and females but females are more responsive. These findings suggest that the use of \u03b2-blockers in the treatment of TMJ pain might be of benefit, especially in females.", 
    "8": "The utility of \u03b2-blockers in the treatment of hypertension has created much speculation as to their efficacy in patients with comorbid conditions, and there are concerns regarding their adverse metabolic effects. It is important to note that these findings were observed with traditional \u03b2-blockers, such as atenolol and metoprolol. The newer generation of \u03b2-blockers, namely carvedilol and nebivolol, is changing the manner in which \u03b2-blockers are viewed in hypertension management. Their ability to inhibit A1 adrenoreceptors and influence nitric oxide leads to vasodilation, which traditional \u03b2-blockers fail to do. These agents have been shown to have favorable metabolic effects while maintaining the beneficial cardiovascular effects of this drug class in post-myocardial infarction patients and the heart failure population.",

    "17": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are integral membrane proteins that change conformation after ligand binding so that they can transduce signals from an extracellular ligand to a variety of intracellular components. The detailed interaction of a molecule with a G protein-coupled receptor is a complicated process that is influenced by the receptor conformation, thermodynamics, and ligand conformation and stereoisomeric configuration. To better understand the molecular interactions of fenoterol analogs with the \u03b2(2)-adrenergic receptor, we developed a new agonist radioligand for binding assays. [(3)H](R,R')-methoxyfenoterol was used to probe the binding affinity for a series of fenoterol stereoisomers and derivatives. The results suggest that the radioligand binds with high affinity to an agonist conformation of the receptor, which represents approximately 25% of the total \u03b2(2)-adrenoceptor (AR) population as determined with the antagonist [(3)H]CGP-12177. The \u03b2(2)-AR agonists tested in this study have considerably higher affinity for the agonist conformation of the receptor, and K(i) values determined for fenoterol analogs model much better the cAMP activity of the \u03b2(2)-AR elicited by these ligands. The thermodynamics of binding are also different when interacting with an agonist conformation, being purely entropy-driven for each fenoterol isomer, rather than a mixture of entropy and enthalpy when the fenoterol isomers binding was determined using [(3)H]CGP-12177. Finally, computational modeling identified the molecular interactions involved in agonist binding and allow for the prediction of additional novel \u03b2(2)-AR agonists. The study underlines the possibility of using defined radioligand structure to probe a specific conformation of such shape-shifting system as the \u03b2(2)-adrenoceptor.",

Ten hospitals were the source of 692 patients with HF (EF < 40%). Physicians of patients with HF were classified as adherent to EBG if the patient chart audit showed they were on a beta-blocker, ACE-inhibitor (ACE-I), or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). Patients were classified as adherent to EBG if MEMS pill caps were used appropriately more than 80% of the time. Sixty-three percent of physicians prescribed evidence-based medications that were adherent to clinical practice guidelines. New York Heart Association (NYHA) III patients were less likely to be adherent (P < 0.001), as were those with renal disease (P < 0.001) and asthmatics (P < 0.001). Nonadherent physicians were less likely to treat patients with beta-blockers (39% vs 98%, P < 0.001) and ACE-I or ARBs (71% vs 98% P < 0.001). Thirty-seven percent of patients prescribed evidence-based therapy failed to use the MEMS pill cap bottles appropriately and were more likely a minority or higher NYHA class.

This study demonstrates an application of 'wrong-way-round ionization' for the simultaneous detection of multiple classes of doping substances without the need to switch the polarity. A screening method for the detection of 137 compounds from various classes of prohibited substances (stimulants, diuretics, \u03b2(2)-agonists, \u03b2-blockers, antiestrogens, glucocorticosteroids and anabolic agents) has been developed. The method involves an enzymatic hydrolysis, liquid-liquid extraction and detection by liquid chromatography/orbitrap mass spectrometry with wrong-way-round ionization. Up to 64% of compounds had a 10-fold lower limit of detection (LOD) than the minimum required performance limit. To compare the efficiency of conventional ionization relative to wrong-way-round ionization of doping substances in\u2009+\u2009ESI, a fortified blank urine sample at the minimum required performance limit was analyzed using two ESI approaches. All compounds were detected with markedly better S/N in a high-pH mobile phase, with the exception of acetazolamide (minimal change in S/N, < 20%).The method was validated by spiking 10 different blank urine samples at five different concentrations.

Both PGE(2) and PGF(2\u03b1) increased significantly during ovarian recrudescence with the peak levels in spawning phase. The PGs showed periovulatory changes with the peak levels at 16 h after the hCG treatment. Incubation of postvitellogenic ovary fragments with estradiol-17\u03b2 (E(2)), 2-OHE(2) or 2-methoxyE(2) produced concentration-dependent increases in PG levels; 2-OHE(2) was more effective. In order to identify the receptor mechanism involved in the 2-OHE(2)-induced PG stimulation, the ovarian pieces were incubated with phentolamine (an \u03b1-adrenergic antagonist), propranolol (a \u03b2-adrenergic antagonist) or tamoxifen (an estrogen receptor blocker) alone or in combination with 2-OHE(2). The incubation of the tissues with the receptor blockers alone did not produce any significant effect on basal PG levels. However, co- and pre-incubation of the tissues with the blockers resulted in inhibition of the stimulatory effect of 2-OHE(2) on the PGs. Phentolamine was more effective than propranolol. The signal transduction pathway(s) involved in the 2-OHE(2)-induced PG secretion was investigated. The incubation of the ovarian pieces with 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor), chelerythrine (a protein kinase C inhibitor) and PD098059 (a mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor) significantly lowered the basal secretion of PGF(2\u03b1) and PGE(2). In contrast, H89 (a protein kinase A inhibitor) increased the basal secretion of PGs at 1 and 5 \u03bcM concentration and decreased it at 10 \u03bcM concentration. The co- or pre-incubation with IBMX, H89, chelerythrine and PD098059 significantly inhibited the stimulatory effect of 2-OHE(2) on PGF(2\u03b1) and PGE(2) levels. The inhibition was higher in the pre-incubation groups. Chelerythrine was the most effective followed by PD098059, IBMX and H89. The results suggest that 2-OHE(2) may employ both adrenergic and estrogen receptors, or a novel receptor mechanism having properties of both adrenergic and estrogen receptors.",

When adrenaline (2ug/kg) was injected intravenously, arterial blood glucose rose from a basal value of 245.5 +/- 4.6mg/dl to 307.5+4.7mg/dl at the peak of response while venous glucose rose from 151.8+4.4mg/dl to 275.8 +/- 4.2mg/dl at the peak of response. Glucose uptake increased to 107.4 +/- 2.5mg/ min at the peak of response. The hyperglycaemic response to adrenaline injection was abolished by propranolol but not by prazosin indicating that this effect of adrenaline is mediated through beta adrenoceptor. Both prazosin and propranolol reduced considerably adrenaline-induced increase in blood flow and glucose uptake, prazosin being more potent in flow reduction.",

There is need for data regarding the efficacy and safety of prophylactic agents in children with migraine; therefore, we designed a randomized clinical trial to compare the efficacy and safety of cinnarizine with that of a well-known prophylactic agent (propranolol) in the prophylaxis of pediatric migraine headache. A total of 120 patients aged between 6 and 17\u00a0years were recruited and 113 patients succeeded in completing all phases of the trial. Of them, 57 patients were given cinnarizine, and propranolol was administered in 56 patients. Reduction in headache frequency was the main response to treatment. Cinnarizine reduced the baseline headache frequency by more than 50% in 74.6% of patients and the mean headache frequency per month was reduced from 11.851\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.739 (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM) to 3.358\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.739 (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM) attacks per month (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

The target compounds include caffeine (stimulant), nicotine (stimulant), atenolol (beta blocker), metamizole (anti-inflammatory and analgesic), fluoxetine (antidepressant), paraxanthine (stimulant) and clofibric acid (lipid regulator). Solid-phase extraction (SPE) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) were selected as extraction and detection techniques, respectively. A detailed study of the experimental conditions of extraction was performed. Under optimal conditions, recoveries obtained were in the range of 21% to 100%, and the relative standard deviations were below 12%. The detection and quantification limits of the method were in the range 2.2-97.4 and 21.1-324.7 ng L(-1), respectively. The developed method was successfully applied to evaluate the presence of these pharmaceutical compounds in wastewaters samples from wastewater treatment plants located on the Gran Canaria Island (Spain).

    "52": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of senile dementia in aging populations. Amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2)-mediated dysregulation of ionic homeostasis is the prevailing underlying mechanism leading to synaptic degeneration and neuronal death. A\u03b2-dependent ionic dysregulation most likely occurs either directly via unregulated ionic transport through the membrane or indirectly via A\u03b2 binding to cell membrane receptors and subsequent opening of existing ion channels or transporters. Receptor binding is expected to involve a high degree of stereospecificity. Here, we investigated whether an A\u03b2 peptide enantiomer, whose entire sequence consists of d-amino acids, can form ion-conducting channels; these channels can directly mediate A\u03b2 effects even in the absence of receptor-peptide interactions. Using complementary approaches of planar lipid bilayer (PLB) electrophysiological recordings and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we show that the d-A\u03b2 isomer exhibits ion conductance behavior in the bilayer indistinguishable from that described earlier for the l-A\u03b2 isomer. The d isomer forms channel-like pores with heterogeneous ionic conductance similar to the l-A\u03b2 isomer channels, and the d-isomer channel conductance is blocked by Zn(2+), a known blocker of l-A\u03b2 isomer channels. MD simulations further verify formation of \u03b2-barrel-like A\u03b2 channels with d- and l-isomers, illustrating that both d- and l-A\u03b2 barrels can conduct cations. The calculated values of the single-channel conductance are approximately in the range of the experimental values. These findings are in agreement with amyloids forming Ca(2+) leaking, unregulated channels in AD, and suggest that A\u03b2 toxicity is mediated through a receptor-independent, nonstereoselective mechanism.",

The measured parameters were as follows: (1) the s.d. of 12 LV-segment time-to-peak systolic velocities (Ts-SD12), and (2) the maximal difference between peak systolic velocities of any 2 of the 12 segments (Ts-Max). Patients with Ts-SD12 \u2265 33 ms or Ts-Max \u2265 100 ms were regarded as having LV systolic dyssynchrony. Patients with systolic dyssynchrony (group 1, n = 29) and without systolic dyssynchrony (group 2, n = 31) were compared.

A sample of 14 high-functioning adults with ASD and a demographically-matched comparison group of 13 typically developing individuals participated. An AX continuous performance test (AX-CPT) was used to evaluate working memory and inhibitory control. AX-CPT performance was assessed following administration of a single dose of propranolol (a beta adrenergic antagonist) and following placebo (sugar pill) administration. Individuals with ASD performed more poorly than non-ASD individuals in the working memory condition (BX trials). Importantly, administration of propranolol attenuated this impairment, with the ASD group performing significantly better in the propranolol condition than the placebo condition. Working memory performance of the non-ASD group was unaffected by propranolol/placebo administration. No group or medication effects were observed for the inhibition condition (AY trials).

    "106": "In this short commentary, we retrospectively analyse the Digitalis Investigation Group (DIG) Trial looking at the primary composite endpoint used in SHIFT (i.e. cardiovascular death or hospital admission for worsening heart failure) and compare the effect of digoxin on this endpoint with that of ivabradine. A remarkably similar risk reduction in the composite outcome and in its components appears evident among patients receiving the active treatment in both studies (although ivabradine was added to a beta-blocker, whereas digoxin was not).",

    "112": "Severe left ventricular outflow obstruction often is associated with diastolic left ventricular myocardial dysfunction and tachycardia despite successful initial treatment. The authors have used esmolol to lower heart rate in this setting for successful weaning of patients from ventilation in postoperative recovery. Their limited experience supports the beneficial effect of continuous esmolol administration on infants with persistent tachycardia and severe left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in postoperative cardiac intensive care.", 
    "113": "As aging proceeds, fertility problems arise, and the success rate of in vitro fertilization declines. During reproductive aging, rat ovaries present spontaneous formation of cysts, followed by a concomitant increase in sympathetic nerve activity, causing infertility and cessation of ovarian function. \u03b22-Adrenergic receptors, which are activated by noradrenaline (NA), modify follicular development and steroid secretions; thus, increased nerve activity has been associated with the development and maintenance of cystic structures. The purpose of this work was to block the effect of this sympathetic activity through in vivo administration of propranolol (a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist) to determine whether it delays cyst formation and cessation of the ovarian function in rats that had reached the subfertile period. Propranolol was administrated daily to 8- and 10-month-old rats for 2 months. Estrous cycling activity was monitored by vaginal smear, serum concentration of the steroidal hormones was determined by enzyme-immune assay and morphological analysis of the ovaries was performed using 6 \u03bcm tissue slices stained with hematoxylin-eosin. Propranolol increased the number of healthy follicles, the ovulation rate, and levels of serum sexual steroids (androstenedione, testosterone, and estradiol) and recovered estrous cycling activity. It also decreased the number of follicular cysts. These results suggest that the blockade of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors recovered ovarian function during reproductive aging. It is suggested that propranolol induces a time-dependent extension of the subfertile window, and it could be used to increase the success rate of fertility programs in aging woman.", 
    "114": "The morbidity and mortality associated with vascular surgery procedures are largely the results of cardiac events. National guidelines have been regularly proposed and updated by the American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) to ensure optimal perioperative management and risk stratification. Controversy remains between experts and other cardiology societies regarding several patient care issues including revascularization before surgery, timing of \u03b2-blocker therapy, and the administration of antiplatelet therapy. Several landmark articles recently published have helped to modify the guidelines in the hope of improving vascular patient outcomes. In this review, we searched all recent available literature pertaining to perioperative cardiac evaluation before major vascular surgery. We propose an algorithm for preoperative cardiac evaluation, which is a modification to the AHA recommendations. Incorporated in this algorithm are recent published pivotal articles that can help in guiding physicians caring for the vascular patient requiring major operative or endovascular interventions.",

Controls comprised 75 eyes of 75 healthy volunteers. Subjective symptoms were evaluated by questionnaire, and lid margin and superficial punctate keratopathy were evaluated by slit lamp examination. Meibomian glands of upper and lower eyelids were observed and scored using noncontact meibography (meiboscore). Tear film break-up time (BUT) was measured and meibum was graded.",

    "119": "Ample evidence suggests that consolidated memories, upon their retrieval, enter a labile state, in which they might be susceptible to change. It has been proposed that memory labilization allows for the integration of relevant information in the established memory trace (memory updating). Memory labilization and reconsolidation do not necessarily occur when a memory is being reactivated, but only when there is something to be learned during memory retrieval (prediction error). Thus, updating of a fear memory trace should not occur under retrieval conditions in which the outcome is fully predictable (no prediction error). Here, we addressed this issue, using a human differential fear conditioning procedure, by eliminating the very possibility of reinforcement of the reminder cue. A previously established fear memory (picture-shock pairings) was reactivated with shock-electrodes attached (Propranolol group, n=18) or unattached (Propranolol No-Shock Expectation group, n=19). We additionally tested a placebo-control group with the shock-electrodes attached (Placebo group, n=18). Reconsolidation was not triggered when nothing could be learned during the reminder trial, as noradrenergic blockade did not affect expression of the fear memory 24h later in the Propranolol No-Shock Expectation group. Only when the outcome of the retrieval cue was not fully predictable, propranolol, contrary to placebo, reduced the startle fear response and prevented the return of fear (reinstatement) the following day. In line with previous studies, skin conductance response and shock expectancies were not affected by propranolol. Remarkably, a double dissociation emerged between the emotional (startle response) and more cognitive expression (expectancies, SCR) of the fear memory. Our findings have important implications for reconsolidation blockade as treatment strategy for emotional disorders. First, fear reducing procedures that target the emotional component of fear memory do not necessarily affect the cognitive component and vice versa. Second, mere retrieval of the fear memory is not sufficient to induce its labilization and reconsolidation.", 
    "120": "In Alzheimer disease (AD), amyloid \u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2) accumulates in plaques in the brain. Receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) mediates A\u03b2-induced perturbations in cerebral vessels, neurons, and microglia in AD. Here, we identified a high-affinity RAGE-specific inhibitor (FPS-ZM1) that blocked A\u03b2 binding to the V domain of RAGE and inhibited A\u03b240- and A\u03b242-induced cellular stress in RAGE-expressing cells in vitro and in the mouse brain in vivo. FPS-ZM1 was nontoxic to mice and readily crossed the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In aged APPsw/0 mice overexpressing human A\u03b2-precursor protein, a transgenic mouse model of AD with established A\u03b2 pathology, FPS-ZM1 inhibited RAGE-mediated influx of circulating A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 into the brain. In brain, FPS-ZM1 bound exclusively to RAGE, which inhibited \u03b2-secretase activity and A\u03b2 production and suppressed microglia activation and the neuroinflammatory response. Blockade of RAGE actions at the BBB and in the brain reduced A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 levels in brain markedly and normalized cognitive performance and cerebral blood flow responses in aged APPsw/0 mice. Our data suggest that FPS-ZM1 is a potent multimodal RAGE blocker that effectively controls progression of A\u03b2-mediated brain disorder and that it may have the potential to be a disease-modifying agent for AD.", 
    "121": "Complement C5a is associated primarily with inflammation. The widespread expression of its receptors, C5aR and C5L2 in neuronal cells, however, suggests additional regulatory roles for C5a in the CNS. C5aR agonist (PL37-MAP) evokes Ca(2+)-influx in GT1-7 neuronal cell line and the Ca(2+)-influx is regulated by estradiol. In the present study, we examined further the mechanism of Ca(2+)-influx and the contribution of the two estrogen receptor (ER) isotypes, ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2, to estrogenic modulation of intracellular Ca(2+)-content. GT1-7 neurons were treated with isotype selective ER agonists for 24h then C5aR agonist evoked Ca(2+)-responses were measured by Ca(2+)-imaging. Transcriptional changes were followed by real-time PCR. We found that not only estradiol (100 pM), but the ER\u03b1 selective agonist PPT (100 pM) enhanced the PL37-MAP-evoked Ca(2+)-influx (E2: 215%, PPT: 175%, compared to the PL37-MAP-evoked Ca(2+)-influx). In contrast, the ER\u03b2 selective agonist DPN (100 pM) significantly reduced the Ca(2+)-influx (32%). Attenuated Ca(2+)-response (25%) was observed in Ca-free environment and depletion of the Ca(2+)-pool by CPA eliminated the remaining elevation in the Ca(2+)-content, demonstrating that the majority of Ca(2+) originated from the extracellular compartment. L-type voltage-gated Ca(2+)-channel (L-VGCC) blocker nifedipine abolished the Ca(2+)-influx, while R-type Ca(2+)-channel blocker SNX-482 had no effect, exemplifying the predominant role of L-VGCC in this process. Acute pre-treatments (8 min) with ER agonists did not affect the evoked Ca(2+)-influx, revealing that the observed effects of estrogens were genomic. Therefore, we checked estrogenic regulation of C5a receptors and L-VGCC subunits. ER agonists increased C5aR mRNA expression, whereas they differentially regulated C5L2. Estradiol decreased transcription of Ca(v)1.3 L-VGCC subunit. Based on these results we propose that estradiol may differentially modulate C5a-induced Ca(2+)-influx via L-VGCCs in neurons depending on the expression of the two ER isotypes.", 
    "122": "A novel liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method employing chiral analytical techniques was developed and validated for in vitro enantioselective metabolic stability study of racemic 1-[4-(2-methoxyethyl) phenoxy]-3-[[2-(2-methoxyphenoxy) ethyl]amino]-2-propanol hydrochloride (TJ0711 HCl), a newly developed vasodilatory \u03b2-blocker. Robust enantiomeric separations were achieved on a chiral SUMICHIRAL OA-2500 column using ethanol and hexane (40:60, v/v) as a mobile phase. Metabolic stability results demonstrated that both TJ0711 enantiomers underwent a rapid phase I metabolism, but preferential metabolism of R-TJ0711 was observed. Our previously reported ultra-performance liquid chromatography-multiple reaction monitoring-information dependent acquisition-enhanced product ion (UPLC-MRM-IDA-EPI) method was finally chosen for metabolite profiling study of TJ0711 enantiomers, because the newly developed HPLC-based method resulted in compromised chromatographic separation, particularly for TJ0711 metabolites. A number of metabolic products were detected and the structures of formed metabolites were predicted. Similar to racemic TJ0711 HCl, demethylation and hydroxylation were proposed to be the principle metabolism pathways during in vitro incubations of each enantiomer with human liver microsomes.",

    "128": "Asthma exacerbations are responsible for many emergency medical interventions and account for a significant proportion of the health costs of the disease. Increased airway inflammation is a key feature of exacerbations in asthma and therefore inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are considered as first-line therapy for long-term asthma control. ICS have been demonstrated to reduce the risk of asthma exacerbations, as well as improving lung function. Oral leukotriene receptor antagonists also reduce the incidence of asthma exacerbations but are less effective than ICS. In patients with inadequately controlled persistent asthma despite low-dose ICS, the addition of a long-acting inhaled beta-agonist (LABA) should be considered. LABA should not be given alone and should always be associated with ICS in asthma. The anti-immunoglobulin E antibody, omalizumab, reduces severe exacerbations and emergency visits in patients with severe allergic asthma. In clinical trials measurement of the inflammatory response in induced sputum could provide information concerning appropriate drug therapy. Asthma-associated comorbidities should be investigated and treated, particularly in severe asthma. Despite a high prevalence of both gastro-oesophageal reflux and allergic rhinitis among patients with asthma, treatment with proton-pump inhibitors or nasal corticosteroids does not reduce the rate of asthma exacerbations.",

    "136": "Low doses of sorafenib have been shown to decrease portal pressure (PP), portal-systemic shunts, and liver fibrosis in cirrhotic rats. Nonselective beta blockers (NSBB) are the only drugs recommended for the treatment of portal hypertension. The aim of our study was to explore whether the combination of propranolol and sorafenib might show an additive effect reducing PP in cirrhotic rats. Groups of common bile duct-ligated cirrhotic rats (CBDL) and sham-operated control rats were treated by gavage with vehicle, propranolol (30 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7day(-1)), sorafenib (1 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7day(-1)), or propranolol+sorafenib. Treatment began 2 wk after the CBDL or sham operation. Hemodynamic evaluation was performed after 2 wk of treatment. In cirrhotic rats, propranolol and sorafenib produced a significant (P < 0.001) and similar reduction in PP (-19 and -15%, respectively). This was achieved through different mechanisms: whereas propranolol decreased PP by reducing portal blood flow (-35%; P = 0.03), sorafenib decreased PP without decreasing portal flow indicating decreased hepatic resistance. After propranolol+sorafenib, the fall in PP was significantly greater (-30%; P < 0.001) than with either drug alone, demonstrating an additive effect. However, the reduction in portal flow (-39%) under combined therapy was not significantly greater than after propranolol alone. Sorafenib, alone or in combination with propranolol, produced significant reduction in portal-systemic shunting (-25 and -33%, respectively), splanchnic vascularization (-37 and -41%, respectively), liver fibrosis (38%), and hepatic neovascularization (-42 and -51%, respectively). These effects were not observed after propranolol alone. In conclusion, the combination of propranolol+sorafenib causes a greater reduction in PP than either drug alone and decreases markedly the extent of portal-systemic shunting, splanchnic and hepatic neovascularization, and liver fibrosis, suggesting that this drug combination is a potentially useful strategy in the treatment of portal hypertension.", 
    "137": "Polymorphisms in and around the Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein (CETP) gene have been associated with HDL levels, risk for coronary artery disease (CAD), and response to therapy. The mechanism of action of these polymorphisms has yet to be defined. We used mRNA allelic expression and splice isoform measurements in human liver tissues to identify the genetic variants affecting CETP levels. Allelic CETP mRNA expression ratios in 56 human livers were strongly associated with several variants 2.5-7 kb upstream of the transcription start site (e.g., rs247616 p = 6.4 \u00d7 10(-5), allele frequency 33%). In addition, a common alternatively spliced CETP isoform lacking exon 9 (\u03949), has been shown to prevent CETP secretion in a dominant-negative manner. The \u0394 9 expression ranged from 10 to 48% of total CETP mRNA in 94 livers. Increased formation of this isoform was exclusively associated with an exon 9 polymorphism rs5883-C>T (p = 6.8 \u00d7 10(-10)) and intron 8 polymorphism rs9930761-T>C (5.6 \u00d7 10(-8)) (in high linkage disequilibrium with allele frequencies 6-7%). rs9930761 changes a key splicing branch point nucleotide in intron 8, while rs5883 alters an exonic splicing enhancer sequence in exon 9.The effect of these polymorphisms was evaluated in two clinical studies. In the Whitehall II study of 4745 subjects, both rs247616 and rs5883T/rs9930761C were independently associated with increased HDL-C levels in males with similar effect size (rs247616 p = 9.6 \u00d7 10(-28) and rs5883 p = 8.6 \u00d7 10(-10), adjusted for rs247616). In an independent multiethnic US cohort of hypertensive subjects with CAD (INVEST-GENE), rs5883T/rs9930761C alone were significantly associated with increased incidence of MI, stroke, and all-cause mortality in males (rs5883: OR 2.36 (CI 1.29-4.30), p = 0.005, n = 866). These variants did not reach significance in females in either study. Similar to earlier results linking low CETP activity with poor outcomes in males, our results suggest genetic, sex-dependent CETP splicing effects on cardiovascular risk by a mechanism independent of circulating HDL-C levels.", 
    "138": "We previously showed that the \u03b2-adrenoceptor modulators, clenbuterol and propranolol, directly blocked voltage-gated sodium channels, whereas salbutamol and nadolol did not (Desaphy et al., 2003), suggesting the presence of two hydroxyl groups on the aromatic moiety of the drugs as a molecular requisite for impeding sodium channel block. To verify such an hypothesis, we synthesized five new mexiletine analogs by adding one or two hydroxyl groups to the aryloxy moiety of the sodium channel blocker and tested these compounds on hNav1.4 channels expressed in HEK293 cells. Concentration-response relationships were constructed using 25-ms-long depolarizing pulses at -30\u2009mV applied from an holding potential of -120\u2009mV at 0.1\u2009Hz (tonic block) and 10\u2009Hz (use-dependent block) stimulation frequencies. The half-maximum inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)) were linearly correlated to drug lipophilicity: the less lipophilic the drug, minor was the block. The same compounds were also tested on F1586C and Y1593C hNav1.4 channel mutants, to gain further information on the molecular interactions of mexiletine with its receptor within the sodium channel pore. In particular, replacement of Phe1586 and Tyr1593 by non-aromatic cysteine residues may help in the understanding of the role of \u03c0-\u03c0 or \u03c0-cation interactions in mexiletine binding. Alteration of tonic block suggests that the aryloxy moiety of mexiletine may interact either directly or indirectly with Phe1586 in the closed sodium channel to produce low-affinity binding block, and that this interaction depends on the electrostatic potential of the drug aromatic tail. Alteration of use-dependent block suggests that addition of hydroxyl groups to the aryloxy moiety may modify high-affinity binding of the drug amine terminal to Phe1586 through cooperativity between the two pharmacophores, this effect being mainly related to drug lipophilicity. Mutation of Tyr1593 further impaired such cooperativity. In conclusion, these results confirm our former hypothesis by showing that the presence of hydroxyl groups to the aryloxy moiety of mexiletine greatly reduced sodium channel block, and provide molecular insights into the intimate interaction of local anesthetics with their receptor.",

Rapid advances in the treatment of AMI, mainly through timely reperfusion, have substantially improved outcomes in patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome and particularly ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. A vast amount of research, both translational and clinical, has been published on various pharmacological and interventional techniques to prevent myocardial cell death during the time of ischemia and subsequent reperfusion. Several methods of cardioprotection have shown the ability to limit myocardial infarction size in clinical trials. Examples of interventional techniques that have proven beneficial are ischemic post-conditioning and remote ischemic per-conditioning, both of which can reduce infarction size. Lowering core body temperature with cold saline infusion and cooling catheters have also been shown to be effective in certain circumstances. The most promising pharmaceutical cardioprotective agents at this time appear to be adenosine, atrial natriuretic peptide, and cyclosporine, with other potentially effective medications in the pipeline.

    "149": "Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis alteration contributes to pancreatic \u03b2-cell dysfunction and death and favors the development of diabetes. In this study, we demonstrate that HDLs protect \u03b2-cells against ER stress induced by thapsigargin, cyclopiazonic acid, palmitate, insulin overexpression, and high glucose concentrations. ER stress marker induction and ER morphology disruption mediated by these stimuli were inhibited by HDLs. Using a temperature-sensitive viral glycoprotein folding mutant, we show that HDLs correct impaired protein trafficking and folding induced by thapsigargin and palmitate. The ability of HDLs to protect \u03b2-cells against ER stress was inhibited by brefeldin A, an ER to Golgi trafficking blocker. These results indicate that HDLs restore ER homeostasis in response to ER stress, which is required for their ability to promote \u03b2-cell survival. This study identifies a cellular mechanism mediating the beneficial effect of HDLs on \u03b2-cells against ER stress-inducing factors.",

His electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated ventricular fibrillation at a local emergency department. After referral, an ECG showed bidirectional ventricular tachycardia (VT) and nonsustained Torsade de Pointes. Two days later, his heart rate became regular, and no additional episodes of VT were observed. His ECG showed sinus rhythm with a corrected QT interval of 423 msec, and two-dimensional echocardiography was unremarkable. We made the diagnosis of a catecholaminergic polymorphic VT. However, only premature ventricular complex bigeminy was induced on exercise ECG and epinephrine infusion tests, and the patient showed no episodes of syncope. His father and mother had different missense mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor on genetic testing. The proband had both mutations in different alleles and was symptomatic. It was recommended that the patient avoid competitive physical activities, and a \u03b2-blocker was prescribed.", 
    "155": "Severe burn injury is associated with induction of the hepatic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. ER stress leads to activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), suppression of insulin receptor signaling via phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and subsequent insulin resistance. Marked and sustained increases in catecholamines are prominent after a burn. Here, we show that administration of propranolol, a nonselective \u03b21/2 adrenergic receptor antagonist, attenuates ER stress and JNK activation. Attenuation of ER stress by propranolol results in increased insulin sensitivity, as determined by activation of hepatic phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt. We conclude that catecholamine release is responsible for the ER stress response and impaired insulin receptor signaling after burn injury.", 
    "156": "A 45-year-old woman with marital and working troubles, a personal history positive for malignant melanoma, and a family history of vitiligo presented with adrenergic urticaria (AU), which at first responded to propranolol, but later became unresponsive to both ?-blockers and antihistamines. Meanwhile, rheumatoid arthritis became apparent. Treatment with corticosteroids and methotrexate led to remission of neither the rheumatologic nor the dermatologic condition. Attempts to taper the immunosuppressive treatment were invariably followed by recurrence of adrenergic urticaria, which still proved unresponsive to propranolol, as did the rheumatoid arthritis. The courses of the diseases strictly paralleled each other. Rheumatoid arthritis could have triggered adrenergic urticaria by simply adding a supplemental stress, but also by systemically activating mast cells, which are known to be involved in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases. A brief discussion of either the dermatological manifestations of, or treatments for rheumatoid arthritis is provided, in order to illustrate the kind of clinical difficulties that such atypical patients pose to physicians. Adrenergic urticaria is an uncommon yet probably under-diagnosed form of urticaria, which is considered a form of neurogenic acute reaction mainly triggered by acute stress. The author presents a case of AU, however, that is only partially explained by a stress setting, though it is strongly associated with the course of an autoimmune disease.", 
    "157": "The safety and efficacy of ivabradine applied in heart transplant (HTx) recipients with permanent sinus tachycardia (PST) has been depicted in previous short-term follow-up studies. We sought to investigate the long-term impact of ivabradine in this patient population. From May to November 2006, 29 HTx recipients with PST, who exhibited either contraindications or intolerance of beta-blocker medication or insufficient heart rate (HR) reduction on beta-blocker treatment, first received oral ivabradine treatment (5 mg bid). Ivabradine treatment was discontinued in three patients due to adverse events within the first week. In the remaining 26 patients, resting HR was significantly lowered from 106.8 \u00b1 9.2 at baseline to 83.2 \u00b1 5.1 bpm after 3 months (p < 0.001). This effect remained stable in the long-term follow-up (82.1 \u00b1 11.8 bpm after 4 years), whilst blood pressure was not affected. Apart from the corrected QT interval (QTc), there were no significant changes in ECG. The elongated QTc at baseline (469.4 \u00b1 29.5 ms) decreased to 444.3 \u00b1 33.1 ms after 3 months ivabradine treatment (p < 0.001). A decrease in QTc until month 9 was observed, followed by a partial increase to the upper limit of the normal value. Neither allograft rejection nor changes in left ventricular ejection fraction were observed over the follow-up period. In conclusion, ivabradine appears to be a safe and feasible long-term therapeutic option for HTx recipients with PST. It reduced the resting HR without impairment of blood pressure, myocardial contractility and cardiac conduction. The prognostic value of normalised QTc following ivabradine administration requires further observation.", 
    "158": "In this investigation, combined effects of quercetin and atenolol in the regulation of isoproterenol (ISO)-induced cardiotoxicity have been evaluated in rats. While ISO administration increased the levels of serum creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) as well as cardiac malondialdehyde (MDA); it reduced the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and the level of reduced glutathione. ISO-induced rats also exhibited ST-segment elevation and tachycardia. Oral administration of atenolol (6\u00a0mg/kg) and quercetin (5\u00a0mg/kg), along with ISO (5\u00a0mg/kg, subcutaneously) every day for 10\u00a0days markedly reduced the serum CK-MB, LDH and SGPT levels. Concomitantly the test drugs improved the status of antioxidative enzymes, decreased the cardiac MDA and nearly normalized the electrocardiogram. Electron paramagnetic resonance study also revealed a decrease in 5,5'-dimethyl-1-pyroline-N-oxide-hydroxyl radicals signal intensity when atenolol and quercetin were administered together to ISO-treated rats. In conclusion, the combined treatment of atenolol and quercetin appears to produce a better cardioprotective effect in ISO-induced animals as compared to their individual treatments, and possibly the beneficial actions are associated with the free radical scavenging action of quercetin.",

The field electric stimulation (0.5 ms pulses, 55 V nominal, 4 min trains at frequencies 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 Hz) of strips from lymph node produced a frequency-dependent increase in baseline tension and frequency of phase contractions. Evoked contractions were significantly (about 80%) reduced by tetrodotoxin (1 x 10(-6) M). The blockage of M-cholinoreceptors with atropine (1 x 10(-6) M) did not affect the field-evoked responses. Contractile field-evoked effects were significantly reduced by the phentolamine (1 x 10(-7)-1 x 10(-6) M) but not completely. Field-evoked contractions were slightly affected by the propranolol (1 x 10(-7)-1 x 10(-6) M). We conclude that the contractile activity of bovine tracheobronchial lymph node capsular smooth muscle is modulated by excitatory adrenergic nerves.",

They span both bacterial membranes and the extracellular space to connect with the host cell plasma membrane. Their extracellular portion is a needle-like, hollow tube that serves as a secretion conduit for effector proteins. The needle of Shigella flexneri is approximately 50-nm long and 7-nm thick and is made by the helical assembly of one protein, MxiH. We provide a 7-\u212b resolution 3D image reconstruction of the Shigella needle by electron cryomicroscopy, which resolves \u03b1-helices and a \u03b2-hairpin that has never been observed in the crystal and solution structures of needle proteins, including MxiH. An atomic model of the needle based on the 3D-density map, in comparison with that of the bacterial-flagellar filament, provides insights into how such a thin tubular structure is stably assembled by intricate intermolecular interactions. The map also illuminates how the needle-length control protein functions as a ruler within the central channel during export of MxiH for assembly at the distal end of the needle, and how the secretion-activation signal may be transduced through a conformational change of the needle upon host-cell contact.", 
    "164": "Non-selective beta-blockers have been a cornerstone of therapy for prevention of esophageal variceal bleeding in cirrhosis patients for more than two decades. When lowering the hepatic vein portal pressure gradient (HVPG) below 12\u2009mm\u2009Hg or decreasing the pressure by 20% from baseline, these drugs are of proven benefit in reducing variceal bleeding and improving survival in this patient population. The recent work by Hend\u00e1ndez-Gea et al., suggests that initiation of the beta-blocker nadolol in cirrhosis patients with high-risk varices can delay or prevent the first occurrence of clinically evident ascites. This finding comes with some caveats, however. The beneficial effect was only seen in patients who had an improvement by 10% or more from baseline HVPG pressure (only 51% of the treated patients in this study). This class of medications has some risk and tolerance issues, and many patients do not respond, even when the heart rate is optimally decreased. Despite this, the use of beta-blockers may be beneficial in the primary prevention of the formation of ascites and further decompensation of cirrhosis.", 
    "165": "Dietary flavonoids possess a multiplicity of neuroprotective actions in various central nervous pathophysiological conditions including depression. Ellagic acid is a polyphenolic compound that occurs in plants such as raspberries, nuts and eucalyptus species. The present study was designed to investigate the antidepressant-like effect of ellagic acid in mice using forced swimming test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST). The involvement of the monoaminergic and opioid systems in the antidepressant-like activity of ellagic acid was also studied. Our results showed that ellagic acid when administered acutely or chronically to mice (25, 50 and 100mg/kg, p.o.), produced a significant reduction in the duration of immobility, with a profile comparable to that of fluoxetine (20mg/kg, p.o.). However, ellagic acid treatment had no effect on the locomotor activity of mice when tested in actophotometer. The reduction in immobility time observed with ellagic acid treatment (50mg/kg, p.o.) was prevented by pretreatment with p-chlorophenylalanine (100mg/kg, i.p., a serotonin synthesis inhibitor), pindolol (10mg/kg, i.p., a \u03b2-adrenoceptors blocker/5HT(1A/1B) receptor antagonist), ketanserin (5mg/kg, i.p., a 5HT(2A/2B) receptor antagonist), ondansetron (1mg/kg, i.p., a 5HT(3) receptor antagonist), prazosin (1mg/kg, i.p., an \u03b1(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist) and yohimbine (1mg/kg, i.p., an \u03b1(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist), but not with naloxone (1mg/kg, i.p., an opioid receptor antagonist). Our results suggest that ellagic acid produced an antidepressant-like effect which was unrelated to its locomotor activity. Furthermore, this anti-immobility effect seems most likely to be mediated through an interaction with the monoaminergic system (serotonergic and noradrenergic systems) and not through the opioid system.", 
    "166": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the major cause of dementia in old people. AD pathology is characterized by amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) deposits in several regions of the brain, and links have been hypothesized between A\u03b2 toxicity and apoptosis. Cerebellar granule cells (CGCs) have been widely used as in vitro tools for molecular studies correlating apoptosis with AD, although the cerebellum is a relatively spared area of the brain in vivo. We have used mixed neuronal-glial cerebellar cultures (NGCCs) and organotypic cerebellar cultures (OCCs) obtained from postnatal mice to assess the toxic effect of the A\u03b2 oligomer 1-40 (A\u03b21-40) after propidium iodide uptake in vitro. Our results demonstrate that NGCCs, which are primarily composed of CGCs, are resistant to A\u03b21-40 challenge (5-10 \u03bcM) when cultured in physiological (5 mM) extracellular KCl ([K+]e) concentrations, i.e., in a condition in which CGCs undergo full maturation. Conversely, when 10 \u03bcM A\u03b21-40 is given to NGCCs cultured in elevated (25 mM) [K+]e (and thus maintained in an immature state), there is a statistically significant increase in cell death. Cell death is by apoptosis, as demonstrated by ultrastructural examination. OCCs are resistant to A\u03b2 challenge in any of the conditions tested (variation of [K+]e, presence or absence of serum, or addition of the neprilysin blocker phosphoramidon). Altogether these observations lead us to conclude that cerebellar cells in an organotypic context may be less susceptible to damage by A\u03b2, raising the question whether isolated CGCs are a reliable assay in drug discovery studies of AD.",

Carvedilol treatment resulted in significant improvements in LVEF, shortening fraction, and velocity of circumferential shortening (VCF(c)). There were no significant changes in the mean arterial blood pressure or systemic vascular resistance index; but LV end-systolic wall stress (LVESS), effective arterial elastance, ventriculoarterial coupling, and LV end-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions and volumes were significantly reduced. Estimated end-systolic elastance, VCF(c)-to-LVESS ratio, and pulsatile arterial compliance significantly improved after 6 months of treatment with carvedilol.

Rate of all-cause mortality, PAH-related hospitalization, change in 6-minute walk test, right ventricular structure and function measured by echocardiography, and hemodynamics measured by right heart catheterization were determined between subjects with and without \u03b2-blocker use. Beta-blocker use was common (28%) in this cohort. After a median follow-up of 20 months, changes in pulmonary hemodynamics and right ventricular size and function were similar between groups. There were no statistically significant differences in adverse events including PAH-related hospitalization or all-cause mortality (p = 0.19), presence of right HF by last visit (p = 0.75), or change in last 6-minute walk distance (p = 0.92). In conclusion, \u03b2-blocker use is not uncommon in a select group of patients with PAH and cardiac co-morbidities and did not appear to exert detrimental effects in clinical, functional, and hemodynamic outcomes.
