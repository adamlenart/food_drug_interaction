Competition for 125I-BE 2254, [3H]rauwolscine, and (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol binding was used to assess affinity for alpha 1-, alpha 2-, and beta-adrenoceptor-binding sites, respectively. Two homologous series of alkyl-linked diacridines and diquinolines were found to interact poorly with beta-adrenoceptors, with only the largest members having appreciable affinity. By contrast, these compounds bind strongly and in a complex manner to alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors. The affinity of diacridines for both alpha-adrenoceptor classes has a parabolic dependence on alkyl chain length with the hexyl and pentyl derivatives being the most potent at the alpha 1- (Ki = 11.5 +/- 2.3 nM) and alpha 2- (Ki = 143 +/- 26 nM) binding sites, respectively. The dependence of inhibition constants on linker chain length for the diquinolines is more complicated, with the ethyl- and heptyl-linked dimers having the greatest affinity for each alpha subclass. There is a nadir in affinity for the pentyl and butyl ligands and an increase in dissociation constant for octyl and longer homologues. Thus, the ethyl diquinoline has Ki values of 6.6 +/- 1.2 and 110 +/- 14 nM for the alpha 1- and alpha 2- adrenoceptors, respectively, and, correspondingly, the heptyl derivative has values of 39 +/- 4 and 51 +/- 1 nM. These findings are discussed with respect to a model of the alpha-adrenoceptor in which the radioligand-binding site is situated in a trench or cleft, surrounded by a flat surface bounded by walls. Daunomycin was found to have no affinity for adrenoceptors of any type and mitoxantrone similarly fails to interact with alpha 2- and beta-adrenoceptors, but binds to the alpha 1 subclass with an inhibition constant (Ki) of 3930 +/- 420 nM. Bisantrene also has no affinity for beta-adrenoceptors but binds to alpha 1- and alpha 2- adrenoceptors with Ki values of 145 +/- 24 and 2310 +/- 430 nM, respectively. Among the mononuclear acridine drugs studied, only nitracrine shows detectable interaction with beta-adrenoceptors (Ki = 760 +/- 50 nM). This compound, like bisantrene, has high affinity for the alpha 1-adrenoceptor (Ki = 131 +/- 17 nM) and moderate affinity for the alpha 2 subclass (Ki = 2180 +/- 500 nM).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "1": "Simultaneous determinations of cardiac output and brachial arterial blood flow were performed in patients with hypertension and high cardiac output in comparison with normal subjects of the same age. Brachial arterial blood flow was measured with a previously described pulsed Doppler apparatus that permitted the noninvasive determination of arterial diameter and blood flow velocity. In patients with borderline hypertension, brachial blood flow was significantly increased (136 +/- 11 vs 72 +/- 8 ml/min; p less than .001). After short-term administration of indomethacin, cardiac output decreased while brachial blood flow remained constant. After short-term administration of a selective beta 1-receptor antagonist (primidolol) and nonselective blocker (propranolol), cardiac output decreased significantly in both cases but the decrease in brachial blood flow was significant only after the administration of the nonselective beta-blocking agent. The study strongly suggested that in patients with borderline hypertension, the increased cardiac output is related to a prostaglandin and beta 1-adrenergic mechanisms whereas the increased brachial blood flow depends mainly on beta 2-adrenergic mechanisms.", 
    "2": "This paper summarizes the results of two studies carried out to evaluate the effects of the cardioselective betablockers atenolol, acebutolol and metoprolol on peripheral circulation of the lower limbs. The 1st study was a double dummy double blind cross over placebo controlled trial carried out for 13 weeks to evaluate the effects of acebutolol (600 mg/die) and metoprolol (300 mg/die), two cardioselective betablockers, on peripheral haemodynamics in patients suffering from mild to moderate hypertension. The 2nd study was a placebo controlled trial on the effects of atenolol (100 mg/day) on haemodynamics at the calf carried out for 8 weeks in patients suffering from essential to severe moderate hypertension, part of which aged over 65 years and affected by arteriosclerosis obliterans of the lower limbs, stage I and II according to Fontaine's classification. Calf blood flow in basal condition (R.F.) and after ischemic stimulus (P.F.) was evaluated by strain gauge plethysmography; basal (B.V.R.) and minimal (M.V.R.) vascular resistances at the calf by the ratio between M.B.P./R.F. and M.B.P./P.F. respectively, Windsor's index (W.I.) by ultrasound. Neither the patients with hypertension only nor the elderly hypertensive suffering from arteriosclerosis obliterans of the lower limbs showed changes in R.F. and P.F., in B.V.R. and M.V.R. and in W.I. after chronic treatment with cardioselective beta-blockers. Many patients--about 17% of all patients, and 40% of arteriopathics--in the two trials had cold hands and feet. These studies suggest that chronic administration of selective beta-blockers does not exert unfavourable effects on muscular blood flow at the calf in patients with hypertension with or without arteriosclerosis obliterans of the lower limbs at I and II stage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "3": "We studied the effects of five beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents (propranolol, atenolol, sotalol, oxprenolol and carteolol) on sinus cycle length (SCL), sinoatrial conduction time (SACT) measured with a constant atrial pacing technique, and atrial developed tension (DT), using isolated blood-perfused canine atria. Except for carteolol, all tested beta-blockers were infused into the sinus node artery at a rate of 1-4 micrograms/min, and carteolol was given continuously at a rate of 0.1-0.4 micrograms/min. Atenolol and sotalol as well as propranolol prolonged SCL and SACT and reduced DT dose-dependently, although propranolol had more potent negative chrono-, dromo- and inotropisms than atenolol and sotalol. Oxprenolol did not change SCL significantly, but lengthened SACT at higher doses and decreased DT in a dose-related manner. Carteolol did not cause any significant changes in the three parameters. The relative potencies on deceleration of SA conduction on the basis of administration of doses which seems to be equipotent as to beta-blocking effect are as follows: propranolol greater than atenolol = sotalol greater than oxprenolol = carteolol. These results suggest that the membrane stabilizing action of beta-blockers may lengthen SACT but that the intrinsic sympathomimetic action of beta-blockers may resist such a prolongation of SACT.", 
    "4": "We examined in a double blind fashion and placebo controlled the effects of some alpha and beta adrenergic receptor agonists and antagonists on the recovery of finger skin temperature 12 min after finger cooling (5 min waterbath for both hands) in twelve patients with Raynaud's syndrome. A favourable effect was established on phenoxybenzamine 20 mg as compared to placebo. A significant but rather small effect on orciprenaline 10 mg. The beta-agonists prenalterol (10 mg) and terbutaline (5 mg) did not influence the recovery of finger skin temperature. The beneficial effect of phenoxybenzamine 20 mg was not influenced by the addition of beta-agonists (prenalterol 10 mg or terbutaline 5 mg) or a beta-blocker (propranolol 40 mg). The beta-agonists terbutaline and orciprenaline caused a fall in diastolic pressure and an increase in heart rate. These effects presumably were connected with one collapse and three near-collapses. On alpha- and beta-blocker (phenoxybenzamine and propranolol) a decrease in systolic pressure appeared, whereas diastolic pressure did not significantly differ from the placebo value. While physical exercise is considered to exacerbate the hypotensive effect of alpha-blockers, a fall in blood pressure during physical exercise could not be established in our experiments after the addition of propranolol to the alpha-blocker phenoxybenzamine. Our results suggest that an alpha-blocker is a good choice in Raynaud's syndrome, whereas the addition of a beta-blocker may have some advantages.", 
    "5": "Three tests were utilized to determine and compare the toxicity of timolol, propranolol and two new aliphatic and alicyclic oxime ethers with beta-blocking activity (falintolol and compound POS 7). Effects on the electrical potential difference across the in vitro bovine corneal epithelium. Local anaesthesia on in vivo rabbit cornea. Antimicrobial activity on bacterial and fungal suspensions. In addition, partition coefficients were determined as physicochemical properties of the drugs. Falintolol, as well as timolol produced a minor change in electrophysiology at clinical concentration. They had neither local anaesthetic, nor antimicrobial effects. Conversely, propranolol and compound POS 7 showed acute corneal toxicity in the present models. It was concluded that changes in the potential difference across a perfused cornea in vitro, local anaesthesia and bacterial inhibition, might be a demonstration of the cytotoxicity of certain topical agents in terms of acute eye tissue reaction. They might represent a valuable model for the acute corneal toxicity evaluation of topical beta-blockers.", 
    "6": "Changes in central hemodynamics, systolic phase structure and capacity for physical work were examined, using respiration ergometry, in patients with neurocirculatory dystonia after a short course of treatment with beta-blockers. It was demonstrated that the treatment resulted in the eukinetic type of circulation, yet changes in physical working capacity showed opposite tendencies: oxygen support of exercise was improved in some patients only. A short-term beta-blocker treatment course can be used as a test of adequacy of the chosen therapy.", 
    "7": "Primary cultures of myocardial cells from neonatal rats were exposed for up to 5 days to the cyclic AMP derivative 8-Br-cAMP. After one day of exposure to the nucleotide, an increase in specific binding capacity of the hydrophilic beta-adrenoceptor antagonist 3H-CGP 12177 was observed in intact cells. (-)-Isoprenaline displaced the radioligand from its binding site. Neither the KD of the antagonist, nor that of the agonist were significantly affected by 8-Br-cAMP. The loss of beta-adrenoceptors during desensitization by long term treatment of the cells with isoprenaline could be partially prevented by 8-Br-cAMP. Only in desensitized, but not in normal cells was isoprenaline-induced cAMP formation significantly enhanced by 8-Br-cAMP pretreatment. This may indicate that beta-adrenoceptors which appear during 8-Br-cAMP exposure are poorly coupled to the adenylate cyclase. Alternatively, the change in receptor density may be accompanied by alterations of other components in the beta-adrenergic system, e.g. an inhibition of the adenylate cyclase. We suggest that cAMP-dependent feed-back regulation of the beta-adrenergic system may play a role during postnatal myocardial differentiation.", 
    "8": "The role of beta-adrenoceptors in the mechanisms of bronchial hyperresponsiveness was studied in 20 normal subjects. Propranolol 120 mg b.d. or placebo was taken for one week. Four bronchial provocation tests: exercise, inhalation of nebulised water, histamine, and methacholine, were carried out before and during the last 2 days of the treatments. FEV1 and flow rate at 50% of vital capacity (V50) were measured. Cardio-vascular beta-blockade with propranolol, measured by reduction in exercise heart rate, was shown in 17 subjects. Propranolol enhanced bronchial responsiveness to some tests in some subjects, but there was no consistent pattern. For the group, the only significant increases in response were 1) the maximum fall in V50 on methacholine challenge (P less than 0.05, paired t-test, n = 17), 2) the dose of methacholine giving a 10% fall (PD10 value) in FEV1 (p less than 0.05 n = 11). These results do not support the concept of decreased beta-adrenoceptor responsiveness as a single lesion leading to abnormal bronchial reactivity.", 
    "9": "Epinephrine, isoproterenol and norepinephrine (10(-6) M - 10(-4) M) reduced the short-circuit current (SCC) across the isolated rabbit iris-ciliary body when added to the blood side (pigmented layer) bathing solution but were without effect when added to the aqueous side (non-pigmented layer) bathing solution. The effect was observed in both HCO-3-rich and HCO-3-free solutions, although it was smaller in the latter. Propranolol and phentolamine (10(-5) M) partially blocked the action of the adrenergic agonists, 8Br-cAMP (1 mM), on the other hand, stimulated the SCC when added to either bathing solution. The apparent contradiction between these results is explained on the basis of separate cyclic AMP compartmentalization in the two epithelial cell layers and the lack of adrenoceptors in the non-pigmented layer.", 
    "10": "The cardiovascular effects of equipotent doses (1,25 X ED95) of vecuronium (70 micrograms/kg iv) and pancuronium (80 micrograms/kg iv) were studied in 16 patients scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass surgery during steady-state conditions of isoflurane (0,4-0,5 vol% end-tidal)-nitrous oxide anaesthesia. All patients were chronically treated with oral beta receptor-blocking agents. Vecuronium did not cause any significant cardiovascular changes whereas pancuronium produced increases in heart rate (13%), cardiac index (15%) and mean arterial pressure (4%) while systemic vascular resistance decreased (8%). In a second part of this study we analysed whether the magnitude of the vagolytic effects of pancuronium is influenced by the anaesthetic procedure and/or by preoperative beta-blocker therapy. A group of 8 patients who were pretreated with beta-receptor blockers and received fentanyl (7 micrograms/kg) during the anaesthetic procedure showed low control values of heart rate (HR), cardiac index (CI), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and the rate-pressure product (RPP) which were due to both, the antisympathetic effects of beta-blocker therapy and the central vagomimetic properties of fentanyl. The administration of pancuronium (80 micrograms/kg) caused the greatest percentage increases in HR (20%), CI (22%), MAP (8%) and RPP (31%) in this group of patients. In contrast, patients (n = 8) anaesthetized with isoflurane-nitrous oxide who were not on preoperative beta-receptor blocker medication, demonstrated higher haemodynamic control values and less increases in HR (10%), CI (10%) and RPP (15%), MAP did not change. The clinical significance of these findings is discussed.", 
    "11": "Discussions of myocardial protection are often limited to the subject of cardioplegia. However, numerous aspects of operative and perioperative care are of comparable importance. This article outlines the broad topic of myocardial protection, provides strategies for its practical implementation, and reports the author's personal results.", 
    "12": "The sensitivity to sympathomimetic amines of isolated atria removed from sham-injected and 6-hydroxydopamine-treated (6-OHDA) guinea-pigs was examined in the presence of an extraneuronal uptake blocker and an alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist. Three weeks of pretreatment with 6-OHDA resulted in leftwards shifts of the dose-response curves for the positive chronotropic and inotropic responses of right and left atria to isoprenaline. The responses to the partial agonist salbutamol were also potentiated after 6-OHDA pretreatment, revealed as an increase in the maximum response relative to isoprenaline. The supersensitivity was post-synaptic in origin and independent of changes in disposition or metabolism, since it was observed with agonists immune to neuronal uptake and O-methylation, and in the presence of extraneuronal uptake inhibition by metanephrine. It was also specific for the beta-adrenoceptor, no supersensitivity to histamine being found. In the right atria, the supersensitivity was partially masked by an opposing depressant effect after 6-OHDA pretreatment which was observed with histamine. Dissociation constants (KA) for the left atrial inotropic responses to orciprenaline were determined by use of the antagonist Ro 03-7894. Atria from 6-OHDA-pretreated animals were supersensitive to orciprenaline, but the KA value did not differ from that after sham injection. It could therefore be concluded that the increase in sensitivity was not due to an increase in affinity for the beta-adrenoceptor.", 
    "13": "Beta-adrenoceptor-blocking agents produce noticeable effects on exercise performance. In patients with coronary heart disease, exercise capacity may in some cases increase during beta-blockade. Training effects (increased functional capacity, increased maximal oxygen uptake) may be somewhat attenuated in relatively healthy individuals taking beta-blockers, although with vigorous exercise programs, physiologic adaptations to exercise probably do occur.", 
    "14": "Literature on the effects of beta-blockers on blood glucose is reviewed. Data are presented regarding the adrenergic influences on glucose regulation and the effects of beta-blockade during hypo- and hyperglycemia in normal and diabetic individuals. beta-adrenergic stimulation enhances insulin and glucagon secretion, as well as glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, and lipolysis. alpha-adrenergic stimulation inhibits insulin secretion and may inhibit glucagon secretion and enhance liver glycogenolysis. In nondiabetics, beta-blockers represent minimal risk of affecting glucose control. In insulin-dependent diabetics, beta-blockers can prolong, enhance, or alter the symptoms of hypoglycemia, while hyperglycemia appears to be the major risk in noninsulin-dependent diabetics. beta-blockers can potentially increase blood glucose concentrations and antagonize the action of oral hypoglycemic drugs.", 
    "15": "Fifteen consecutive patients with accessory AV pathways comprising 12 cases of the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and 3 cases with exclusively retrograde conduction diagnosed by endocavitary electrophysiological investigation were studied. 5 patients had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and the other 10 had reciprocating orthodromic tachycardia. 12 patients underwent electrophysiological investigation to measure the refractory periods and anterograde and retrograde conduction times in sinus rhythm and induced reciprocating tachycardia treatment with oral propafenone at a dose of 900 mg/day for 3 to 6 days. The refractory periods of anterograde conduction and the conduction times were then measured using an endocavitary atrial recording electrode left in position after the initial investigation. The anterograde Wenckebach point decreased from 259 +/- 35/min to 158 +/- 13/min (p less than 0.001). The refractory periods were increased from 270 +/- 45 ms to 371 +/- 100 ms (p less than 0.05). Atrial fibrillation could only be initiated in 2 cases with a mean rate which had decreased from 258 to 130/min. Reciprocating tachycardia could only be initiated in 5 cases and then with a slower rate (average cycle length increasing from 352 +/- 52 ms to 430 +/- 41 ms). Eight of these patients continued the treatment for over one year without recurrence of their arrhythmias, confirming the long-term efficacy of propafenone in the prevention of arrhythmias complicating accessory AV conduction pathways.",

The procedures for determination are summarized in a table, together with the most important analytical parameters.", 
    "17": "Variability in response to some drugs such as debrisoquine can be attributed to genetic polymorphism of their oxidative metabolism. Most beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers) are extensively metabolised via oxidative routes. Anecdotal reports of high plasma concentrations of certain beta-blockers in poor metabolisers of debrisoquine (PM) have claimed that their oxidation is under polymorphic control. Controlled studies have shown that debrisoquine oxidation phenotype is a major determinant of the metabolism, pharmacokinetics and some of the pharmacological actions of metoprolol, bufuralol and timolol. The PM phenotype is associated with an increased drug bioavailability, a prolongation of elimination half-life and more intense and sustained beta-blockade. Phenotypic differences were also noted in the pharmacokinetics of the enantiomers of metoprolol. In vivo and in vitro work has identified some of the metabolic pathways which are subject to the defect, namely, the alpha-hydroxylation and the O-dealkylation of metoprolol and the 1'-hydroxylation of bufuralol. In contrast, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of propranolol which is also extensively oxidised, are not related to debrisoquine polymorphism, although 4'-hydroxypropranolol formation is lowered in PM subjects. The clinical significance of impaired elimination of beta-blockers is unclear. If standard doses of beta-blockers are used in PM subjects, they may be susceptible to concentration-related adverse reactions and they may also require lower and less frequent dosing for control of angina pectoris.", 
    "18": "Intestinal absorption characteristics of eleven beta-adrenoceptor antagonists were measured by monitoring their disappearance from in-situ intestinal loops in the anaesthetized rat. All have basic pKa values of around 9.5 (with the exception of sotalol) but show a wide range of lipophilic character (octanol-water log P values from -0.79 to 3.65). The results show two types of absorption behaviour, indicating different mechanisms for 'hydrophilic' and 'lipophilic' beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. The four most hydrophilic molecules (sotalol, atenolol, nadolol and practolol) show virtually identical absorption rate constants. Absorption is slow and relative rates in jejunum (mean pH 6.5) and ileum (mean pH 7.3) are not consistent with pH-partition (jejunum greater than or equal to ileum). The more lipophilic members of the series (pindolol, timolol, metoprolol, oxprenolol, alprenolol and propranolol) are all absorbed much more rapidly. Absorption rate constant rises rapidly with log P and the expected pH effects are seen (ileum greater than jejunum). Acebutolol shows anomalously slow absorption for its log P value.", 
    "19": "The intravenous administration of 8-hydroxy-2(di-N-propylamino) tetralin, a selective 5-HT receptor agonist, caused a biphasic blood pressure response and bradycardia in Sprague-Dawley rats. The initial pressor response involved peripheral alpha 1-adrenoceptors since it was present in pithed rats and was antagonized by prazosin. Though the intracerebroventricular route of administration was not more effective the hypotension and bradycardia were probably of central origin. The bradycardia was prevented by pretreatment with atropine and propranolol suggesting an involvement of vagal as well as sympathetic activity. These results support the view that central 5-HT receptor activation reduces the blood pressure and heart rate.", 
    "20": "The subtypes of beta-adrenoceptor present in left atrial preparations from the guinea-pig and cat have been assessed using both responses obtained in organ bath experiments and radioligand binding studies. From the positive inotropic responses to procaterol, the pKB values for practolol using a variety of agonists, and from displacement of [125I]cyanopindolol from left atrial membrane homogenates by the selective beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonists L643,717-01J10 and ICI 118,551, it was concluded that guinea-pig left atria possess only beta 1-adrenoceptors, whilst cat left atria possess both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor subtypes.", 
    "21": "We investigated the antiarrhythmic effect of beta-blocking agents. Using 35 anesthetized dogs, the chest was opened and the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) was ligated for 30 min and the ventricular multiple response threshold (VMRT) was observed in the time course. The dogs were divided into five groups premedicated intravenously ten min before LAD ligation with either isotonic saline (the control group), D,L-propranolol (0.5 mg/kg), D-propranolol (0.5 mg/kg), D,L-pindolol (0.1 mg/kg), or D,L-acebutolol (2.5 mg/kg). Thirty min after ligation, myocardial mitochondria were prepared from the ischemic and the non-ischemic areas, and then the content of mitochondrial long-chain acyl-CoA and Ca++-binding activity were measured. The value of VMRT 1.59 +/- 0.21 mA before ligation decreased to 0.99 +/- 0.13 mA 30 min after ligation. Content of acyl-CoA in mitochondria from the ischemic area increased significantly compared to those from the non-ischemic area. Mitochondrial Ca++-binding activity in the ischemic area decreased significantly compared to that in the non-ischemic area. Each administration of three beta-blocking agents prevented the decreases in VMRT and Ca++-binding activity and excessive accumulation of acyl-CoA; D-propranolol had no effect. These results suggest that the antiarrhythmic action of beta-blocking agents is based, at least in part, on the protection from decrease in Ca++-binding activity due to mitochondrial dysfunction induced by the excessive accumulation of long-chain acyl-CoA in mitochondria.", 
    "22": "Cetamolol is a new beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent shown in animals to have moderate beta 1-adrenoceptor selectivity and partial agonist activity. In healthy normal volunteers, beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade was measured as the reduction of exercise-induced tachycardia, systolic blood pressure, and double product at 2, 8, and 24 h after a single oral dose of 10, 25, and 50 mg cetamolol. beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade was significantly linearly related to log serum cetamolol level, was maximal at 2 h, and was still clinically significant at 24 h. A crossover study of single 0, 10, and 25 mg doses confirmed these findings.", 
    "23": "The cardiovascular effects of adimolol, a new, potent, long acting beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug were investigated in three studies. In the first study blood pressure and heart rate were measured in five male volunteers before and at 2, 4, 6, 8, 24, 32, 48, 72 and 96 h after single oral doses of adimolol. All doses of adimolol reduced supine, standing and exercise heart rates in a dose dependent manner. The maximum effect ranged from 18% following 25 mg to 29% following 600 mg and all doses showed an effect at 96 h (range 3.5-17.2%). In the second study the effects of adimolol, 25 and 400 mg, labetalol, 200 and 800 mg, propranolol 40 mg and placebo were compared on supine and standing heart rate and blood pressure and on exercise heart rate before and at 2, 4, 6 and 8 h after single oral doses. The exercise heart rate was significantly reduced at all times following adimolol 25 and 400 mg, labetalol 800 mg and propranolol 40 mg. At 2 h all the drugs significantly reduced standing systolic blood pressure. In the third study, 4 h after single oral doses of adimolol 400 mg, labetalol 400 mg and propranolol 40 mg six subjects received serial 4 min infusions of phenylephrine. The blood pressure was measured after each infusion. Labetalol 400 mg significantly shifted the blood pressure dose-response curve to the right. There was no difference between propranolol 40 mg and adimolol 400 mg. These studies show that adimolol is a potent, long acting beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug without evidence of alpha-adrenoceptor blockade in man.", 
    "24": "The influence of extracellular Ca2+ and nifedipine on contractile responses to 10 microM noradrenaline (NA) was investigated in isolated rat and cat middle cerebral (RCA, CCA) and mesenteric (RMA, CMA) arteries. In the CCA (containing predominantly alpha 2-adrenoceptors), the NA-induced contractions developed considerably more slowly than in the RCA, RMA (containing mainly alpha 1-adrenoceptors) and CMA (sensitive to both alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor selective antagonists). The tonic component of the NA-induced contraction in the four types of artery was substantially suppressed after only short periods in Ca2+-free solution. In each type of artery, excluding the CCA, the contractile response to 124 mM K+ was more sensitive to Ca2+ deprivation than that to NA. This suggests that NA, besides mobilizing extracellular Ca2+, can also release Ca2+ from an intracellular pool in the RCA, RMA and CMA, but not in the CCA. Thus, alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated contractions in the RCA and RMA seem to depend on both Ca2+ influx and intracellular Ca2+ release, whereas alpha 2-adrenoceptor-mediated contractile responses in the CCA appear to rely almost entirely on Ca2+ influx. Both the maximum response and the tonic component of the NA-induced contraction were significantly more sensitive to nifedipine in the CCA than in the RCA. In comparison with the NA-induced contractions in these arteries, those in the RMA and CMA were relatively resistant to nifedipine. In the CCA exposed to NA in Ca2+-free medium, nifedipine almost abolished the contraction induced by re-addition of Ca2+, whereas in the other types of artery, Ca2+ re-application evoked a significant contraction also in the presence of the drug. The differential effects of nifedipine presumably reflect differences between the arteries, not only in the relative contribution of Ca2+ influx and intracellular Ca2+ release to the contractile activation, but also in the nifedipine sensitivity of the Ca2+ entry pathways utilized by NA. It is concluded that the mechanisms through which NA induces contraction seem to be related both to the subtype of alpha-adrenoceptor stimulated by NA and to the type of vessel studied.", 
    "25": "Ovariectomized (OVX) and ovariectomized-adrenalectomized (OVX-ADX) rats were injected with estradiol benzoate (EB, 4.0 micrograms/rat) and received 44 hr by infusion into the ventromedial hypothalamic area one of the following treatments: norepinephrine (NE), clonidine (an alpha-agonist), isoproterenol (a beta-agonist) or a combination of clonidine and isoproterenol. Infusion of NE (200 ng/rat) induced lordosis in both OVX and OVX-ADX rats 15 minutes after its administration. NE-induced lordosis was blocked by systemic treatment with either the alpha-antagonist, prazosin (1.0 mg/kg), or the beta-antagonist, propranolol (4.0 mg/kg). Intrahypothalamic infusion of clonidine (200 ng/rat) or isoproterenol (200 ng/rat) induced lordosis behavior in OVX, but not in OVX-ADX rats, suggesting the involvement of adrenal secretions in this response. Combined administration of clonidine (100 ng/rat) and isoproterenol (100 ng/rat) induced lordosis behavior 15 minutes after its intrahypothalamic infusion in OVX-ADX animals. Results are discussed in relation to a model proposed for the induction of lordosis behavior involving steroid-NE interactions.", 
    "26": "The nonspecific beta-adrenergic antagonist d,l propranolol, the specific beta 1-adrenergic antagonist atenolol, and the specific beta 2-adrenergic antagonist butoxamine were administered intraperitoneally (IP) to ovariectomized female rats in order to determine the role of beta-adrenergic receptors in drinking. D,l propranolol and atenolol administered at doses of 6, 12, and 18 mg/kg significantly attenuated the one-hour water intakes of rats administered angiotensin II (200 micrograms/kg, SC) and the water intakes of rats deprived of water for 24 hours. D propranolol, which has little beta-adrenergic blocking ability, administered at doses of 6 and 12 mg/kg, and butoxamine, administered at doses of 25 and 35 mg/kg, had no significant effects on the water intakes of angiotensin II treated or water deprived rats. Regardless of the dose, d,l propranolol, atenolol, and butoxamine failed to significantly alter the water intakes of rats administered 1.0 M NaCl (10 ml/kg, IP) The results provide evidence that beta 1-adrenergic receptors, but not beta 2-adrenergic receptors, are involved in mediating the increased water intakes induced by angiotensin II and water deprivation. On the other hand the increased water intake due to administration of hypertonic saline does not appear to mediated by beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "27": "We studied the autonomic response characteristics of airways in 65 swine in vivo. Tracheal smooth muscle response was measured isometrically in situ; bronchial response was measured simultaneously as change in airway resistance and dynamic compliance. To determine the optimal resting length at which maximal tracheal contraction was obtained, length-tension studies were generated in four animals using maximal electrical stimulation of the vagus nerves determined from stimulus-response characteristics in eight other swine. Pharmacological studies were performed in 25 animals to determine the relative potency and intrinsic activity of agonists (acetylcholine greater than histamine much greater than norepinephrine) causing contraction of trachea and bronchial airways. In 13 swine, the effects of autonomic stimulation were studied by intravenous administration of dimethylphenylpiperazinium (DMPP) after muscarinic blockade with 1.5 mg/kg iv atropine. Tracheal contraction caused by topical application of 3.4 X 10(-4) mol histamine (13.4 +/- 1.54 g/cm) was 96 +/- 7.2% blocked by 25 micrograms/kg iv DMPP in adrenal-intact animals; minimal relaxation was demonstrated in adrenalectomized animals, indicating absence of substantial sympathetic innervation to porcine trachea. Nonadrenergic innervation was not demonstrated. After beta-adrenergic blockade, sympathetic stimulation caused alpha-adrenergic contraction in bronchial airways but not in trachea. These data define the unique response characteristics of the airways of swine and demonstrate their utility for acute experimental study of airway responses in vivo.", 
    "28": "The circadian rhythm of blood pressure derived from continuous recordings of blood pressure in hypertensive subjects, provides an accurate and repeatable method of describing blood pressure on a temporal scale which can be used to evaluate the effects of anti-hypertensive drugs. It has been postulated that the rapid rise of pressure between 0600 and 1000 hr is due to intrinsic sympathetic activity mediated at the peripheral arteriole by alpha-adrenoreceptors. Drugs which block beta-adrenoreceptors do not appear to influence blood pressure at this time, no matter how frequently they are administered or how long-acting they may be. Meteroprolol and sotolol are beta-adrenoreceptor blocking drugs which appear to be different in that they produce a considerable fall in nocturnal blood pressure, which is similar to the effects of alpha-adrenoreceptor blocking agents. The physiological and clinical significance of these findings remains to be defined, but they emphasise the need for full and complete information on blood pressure changes before the most effective method of blood pressure reduction can be defined.", 
    "29": "Binding of (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol [( 3H]DHA) to isolated brown adipose tissue (BAT) microsomal membranes was used to estimate beta-adrenoreceptor density, and this was found to be saturable, reversible, and stereospecific. Scatchard analysis indicated a single class of binding sites of equilibrium dissociation constant 2.2 nM, with a maximum number of binding sites of 160-170 fmol/mg protein. These values were unaffected by the age or sex of the animals, and similar Kd values were obtained for binding to heart and lung membranes. The kinetically derived Kd from forward and reverse reactions was 1.4 nM for BAT. Hofstee analysis of displacement of [3H]DHA produced linear plots for propranolol but curvilinear plots for atenolol and ICI 118,551. Atenolol showed 50-fold selectivity for beta 1-receptors and ICI 118,551 50-fold selectivity for beta 2-receptors in heart, lung, and BAT membranes. These plots indicated beta 1:beta 2-receptor ratios of 59:41 for BAT and heart and 25:75 for lung. It is possible that both beta-adrenoreceptor subtypes in BAT may be involved in the activation of thermogenesis in the tissue.", 
    "30": "Stimulation of myometrial beta-adrenergic receptors by agonists results in myometrial relaxation through adenylate cyclase-dependent mechanisms. Their activity is modulated by local or systemic estrogen-progesterone milieu. During pregnancy, guinea pigs demonstrate an ovarioplacental shift for progesterone production at less than or equal to 0.35 gestation and a gradual increase in estrogen levels. To investigate whether these changes affect myometrial beta-adrenergic-receptor and adenylate cyclase properties, we directly characterized beta-adrenergic receptors and adenylate cyclase in myometrial plasma membranes from time-dated pregnant (term 65 days), postpartum, and nonpregnant virgin guinea pigs by well-established in vitro methods. In all animals, there appeared to be a high-affinity, low-capacity, single class of binding sites with pharmacologic specificities consistent with the beta 2-adrenergic-receptor subtype. The dissociation constants of these beta-adrenergic receptors were significantly decreased in pregnant animals at approximately greater than or equal to 0.80 gestation when compared to pregnant animals at 0.35 to 0.40 gestation, nonpregnant animals, and postpartum animals. Moreover, the total number of beta-adrenergic receptors was significantly higher at greater than or equal to 0.80 gestation than in the other groups. Basal adenylate cyclase activity increased in animals from 0.35 to greater than or equal to 0.8 gestation and was higher than that of postpartum animals and nonpregnant animals. The degree of adenylate cyclase stimulation by (-)isoproterenol was higher at term than at an earlier point in gestation or in nonpregnant and postpartum animals. These results indicate that, with advancing gestation in pregnant animals, there is an up-regulation of beta-adrenergic-receptor and adenylate cyclase function.", 
    "31": "To test whether left ventricular (LV) end-systolic dimensions are determined only by end-systolic pressure for a given inotropic state, 7 conscious dogs were studied during abrupt closure of a fistula created between the left subclavian artery and the left atrial appendage. The dogs were instrumented with an LV pressure micromanometer and ultrasonic crystals measuring LV major- and minor-axis diameters and ventricular wall thickness. During beta-blockade treatment and for the same end-systolic pressure, closure of the fistula produced a 40% decrease in cardiac output; end-diastolic diameter decreased by 1.5 mm and end-systolic diameter decreased by 0.9 mm. Calculated end-systolic volume was similarly decreased by 1.3 ml for a decrease of 2.9 ml of end-diastolic volume. Thus, large end-diastolic dimensional variations associated with peripheral resistance decrease significantly modify the end-systolic pressure-diameter (and volume) relations in the conscious animal. It is suggested that indexes obtained from these relations should not be used in patients when systolic pressure variations are associated with large stroke volume variations.", 
    "32": "One hundred patients admitted to coronary care with unstable angina were followed for a period of 1 year. A conservative approach to treatment was adopted. Routine beta blockers, calcium antagonists, and anticoagulants were not employed. Patients with persistent pain following admission were treated with nitrates only and with symptomatic treatment. One death and nine nonfatal infarctions occurred within the first 28 days after admission. A total of eight deaths, 14 nonfatal infarctions, and three readmissions for unstable angina occurred during the follow-up period of 1 year. Of the various initial factors studied, persistence of pain and the magnitude and extent of ECG ST-T changes were the only predictors of an unfavorable outcome. Non-smokers and those with a previous history of angina on effort had a significantly higher incidence of persistence of pain. The withdrawal of beta blockers on admission and the late administration of beta blockers to those with persistent pain did not appear to influence outcome.", 
    "33": "Beta adrenergic receptor binding was performed with 125I iodocyanopindolol on human cavernous tissue membrane fractions from normal tissue and transsexual procedures obtained postoperatively, as well as from postmortem sources. Isotherm binding studies on normal fresh tissues indicated that the receptor density was 9.1 fmoles/mg. with a KD of 23 pM. Tissue stored at room temperature for 4 to 6 hours, then at 4C in saline solution for 19 to 20 hours before freezing showed no significant changes in receptor density or affinity, and provided evidence for the stability of postmortem tissue obtained within the same time period. Beta receptor density of 2 cavernous preparations from transsexual procedures was not significantly different from normal control tissues, and showed that high concentrations of estrogen received by these patients had no effect on beta adrenergic receptor density. Displacement of 125iodocyanopindolol by 5 beta adrenergic agents demonstrated that 1-propranolol had the greatest affinity followed by ICI 118,551, zinterol, metoprolol and practolol. When the results of these displacement studies were subjected to Scatfit, non-linear regression line analysis, a single binding site was described. Based on the relative potency of the selective beta adrenergic agents it appears that these receptors were of the beta 2 subtype.", 
    "34": "Beta adrenergic agonists stimulate the secretion of lamellar bodies by lung alveolar type II cells. Most studies of such stimuli have been for short time periods; we wished to determine the effects of longer infusions of beta adrenergic agonists and antagonists upon biochemical and morphometric measures of type II cell surfactant pools. We implanted osmotic minipumps which infused 10 micrograms/kg/min of isoproterenol, 10 micrograms/kg/min of terbutaline or 0.2 microgram/kg/min of propranolol into the s.c. tissue of rats for 7 days. Saline-infused rats and untreated rats were studied concurrently. Seven days after pump implantation, we measured body, lung and heart weight and lamellar body and lavage disaturated phosphatidylcholine content. A group of rats with saline-, isoproterenol- or propranolol-filled osmotic minipumps had lungs fixed and processed for morphometric volume determination of type II cell organelles. Lung and body weights were unaffected by beta agonists and by propranolol, whereas heart weights were increased 14 to 47%. Lamellar body disaturated phosphatidylcholine was elevated 20 to 30% after 7 days of beta agonist infusion and was 20% lower after 7 days of propranolol, compared to saline infusion. Morphometric estimates of total lamellar body volume per lung showed a 22% increase after 7 days of isoproterenol and a 40% decrease after 7 days of propranolol. These changes were found to be due to an increase in lamellar body volume per cell after isoproterenol and a decrease in both lamellar body volume per cell and total number of type II cells per lung after propranolol infusion.", 
    "35": "Development of brain tissue is thought to be regulated, in part, by biogenic amines. We examined the role of noradrenergic stimulation in regulation of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), an enzyme whose activity is obligatory for neuronal development and which has been used as a biochemical marker for cellular maturation. Intracisternal administration of adrenergic agonists produced a prompt increase in ODC in neonatal rat cerebellum, an effect mediated through beta-2 receptors: the rank order of activity was isoproterenol greater than epinephrine greater than norepinephrine greater than methoxamine; the effect could be blocked by propranolol but not phenoxybenzamine; and zinterol (a beta-2 selective agonist) was equipotent to isoproterenol whereas prenalterol (a beta-1 agonist) was ineffective. The elevation of ODC caused by adrenergic stimulation was cyclic AMP-dependent, as evidenced by: direct measurement of cyclic AMP levels after isoproterenol administration; comparisons of the dose-response curve for stimulation of cyclic AMP with that of ODC; examination of the time course of effect on the two variables; stimulation of ODC by administration of cyclic AMP analogs; demonstration of identical kinetic mechanisms for ODC stimulation by dibutyryl-cyclic AMP and isoproterenol; and potentiation of the actions of isoproterenol on both cyclic AMP and ODC by RO-201724, a specific inhibitor of phosphodiesterase.

    "37": "The cornea is dually innervated, receiving afferent nerves from the trigeminal ganglion and efferent nerves from the superior cervical ganglion. This study examines the specific effects of superior cervical ganglionectomy (SCGX) on the in vitro ion transport characteristics of the rabbit corneal epithelium. Two weeks after SCGX, epithelial Cl--dependent transport and total ionic conductance were increased in comparison to values obtained in paired control eyes. This increased transport level appeared to be independent of membrane receptor activity as demonstrated by lack of responsiveness to alpha-adrenergic, beta-adrenergic, serotonergic, dopaminergic, nicotinic cholinergic, or muscarinic cholinergic blockade. Nevertheless, SCGX produced a supersensitivity to epinephrine-stimulated transport as measured by the responsiveness of the ion transport current. Furthermore, SCGX abolished the responsiveness of the epithelium to serotonin. On the basis of these and earlier findings, the authors conclude that corneal sympathetic innervation influences membrane and receptor properties. Autonomic neurotrophic effects in the corneal epithelium include suppression of apical membrane Cl- permeability and of beta-adrenoreceptor sensitivity to biogenic amines. It is proposed that the corneal serotonergic receptors that activate Cl- transport lie on the sympathetic nerve terminals and stimulate this transport process by causing the neural release of a catecholamine.", 
    "38": "Propranolol, a nonselective beta-adrenergic blocker, appears to reduce portal pressures in portal hypertension by reducing portal blood flow. The aim of this study was to investigate the relative role of selective beta 1- and beta 2-blocking properties of propranolol participating in portal blood flow reduction. Portal hypertensive rats receiving placebo exhibited elevated portal blood flow of 1.31 +/- 0.4 ml/min per g splanchnic tissue and portal pressure of 15.4 +/- 0.43 mmHg, with elevated cardiac index of 358 +/- 20 ml/min per kg. Portal hypertensive rats were divided into groups receiving propranolol nonspecific beta-blockade, atenolol selective beta 1-blockade, and ICI 118551 selective beta 2-blockade. Significant (p less than 0.05) reductions in portal blood flow of 32%, 27%, and 21% were achieved in all three groups, respectively, accompanied by significant (p less than 0.05) reductions in portal pressure of 1.7 +/- 0.3, 0.9 +/- 0.2, and 0.8 +/- 0.2 mmHg, respectively. Cardiac index was significantly reduced in the propranolol-treated (25%) and atenolol-treated (20%) groups, but remained unchanged in the ICI 118551-treated group. We conclude that propranolol appears to achieve its therapeutic reduction in portal blood flow and portal pressure through combined participation of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic blockade. Furthermore, ICI 118551 selective beta 2-adrenergic blockade offers portal blood flow and portal pressure reduction independent of reduction in cardiac output, which could be uniquely advantageous in situations where impairment of cardiac compensatory mechanisms might prove deleterious.", 
    "39": "Mediobasal hypothalamic (MBH) slices of adult ovariectomized (OVX) rats with or without 17 beta-estradiol (E2) pretreatment, were superfused in buffered (pH 7.2) oxygenated Locke medium containing bacitracin. Pulsatile or continuous administration of progesterone (10(-7) or 10(-8) M) produced a marked increase in luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) release provided the animals had received E2 prior to sacrifice. Omission of Ca++ in the medium, or addition of a Ca++ channel blocker (D-600, 10(-4) M), of a calmodulin inhibitor (trifluoperazine, 30 microM) or of a calmodulin-dependent tubulin kinase inhibitor (phenytoin, 50 microM), antagonized the stimulatory effect of progesterone. When sodium channels were blocked by tetrodotoxin (5 X 10(-7) M), the stimulatory effect of the steroid was completely abolished. The amplitude of the K+-induced LHRH release was slightly increased in the presence of progesterone (10(-7) M) but only from MBH slices of OVX-E2-treated rats. These results indicate that the secretory response of LHRH to progesterone requires priming with estradiol, is Ca++-dependent and involves mediation of calmodulin and a calmodulin-dependent kinase system.", 
    "40": "The natural history of the patient with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is characterized by slow progression of symptoms and left ventricular hypertrophy; severe functional limitation is unusual and encountered only in about 20%. Most of the deaths are sudden and occur irrespective of the functional status of the patient and there are no routine electrocardiographic or hemodynamic measurements indicative of poor prognosis. Sudden death may be associated with syncope and young age at diagnosis as well as with a family history of sudden death. The mechanisms underlying the cause of sudden death have not been clearly elucidated. Although complete heart block may complicate myotomy or myectomy, the development, in an unoperated patient, of symptomatic conduction disease is uncommon. Preexcitation syndromes may be present in a small subpopulation (about 2%), but this appears seldom responsible for sudden death. Outflow tract spasm has also been postulated as a causal factor but the fact that proportionately an equal number of patients with and without ventricular outflow gradients die suddenly, suggests that other mechanisms must be important. Further hypotheses, currently however, without substantiation, have implicated acute changes in diastolic filling or acute myocardial ischemia as causes of sudden death. Recently published studies have stressed the importance of ventricular arrhythmias as a cause of sudden death. Ventricular tachycardia occurs in about 30% of such patients and can be found significantly more frequent in adult patients who die suddenly. In children and adolescents, since they have a lesser incidence of ventricular tachycardia, possibly, other mechanisms are involved. In general, episodes of ventricular tachycardia are asymptomatic and self-limited; the main ventricular rate recorded during 135 episodes in 30 of our patients was 142 beats per minute with an average duration of eight beats. Variable QRS morphology suggests different sites of origin. Due to the marked spontaneous variability, the probability of missing ventricular tachycardia with a single 24-hour continuous ambulatory ECG is 54%; on 96 hours of continuous ECG monitoring the probability can be reduced to 8%. Accordingly, continuous ambulatory ECG monitoring should be carried out for at least 48 to 72 hours. At the time of diagnosis, approximately 7% of the patients have atrial fibrillation. On three days of continuous 24-hour ECG monitoring, about 40% will be found to have atrial fibrillation or supraventricular arrhythmias. The correlation between supraventricular arrhythmias and sudden death is weaker than that of the latter with ventricular arrhythmias.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "41": "82 patients clinically and echocardiographically identified as having mitral valve prolapse were examined with regard to the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias and their therapeutic and prognostic implications. 73 patients (89%) had ventricular extrasystoles in the 24 hour ambulatory ECG, 33 (40%) of them with an average of more than 30/h. Severe forms like multiform or paired ventricular extrasystoles and nonsustained ventricular tachycardias have been registered in 28 (34%), 26 (32%) and 9 patients (11%) respectively. There is a correlation between the incidence of the arrhythmias and time of registration which corresponds to a natural logarithm. A prolongation of the time of registration to more than 24 hours therefore implies no essential benefit. The incidence and the number of ventricular arrhythmias demonstrated a significant decrease during sleep. The incidence of ventricular pairs and/or ventricular tachycardias was 13% during the night (0-6 h) in comparison with at least 22% during the three daytime periods (6-12 h, 12-18 h and 18-24 h). There was no correlation between the incidence or severity of ventricular arrhythmias and the patients' ages of left ventricular performance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

At four months she had some breast development, a bone age advance of one year, and elevated levels of FSH and estradiol. Later on the prolactin level was also raised, while LH and TSH values continued low. Posteriorly, irregular cutaneous pigmentation, brown in colour, was evident on the neck and trunk, and a McCune-Albright syndrome was suspected. The relationship between these conditions and treatment of them is discussed.", 
    "43": "Plasma potassium rises during muscular exercise and falls rapidly when exercise is stopped. Since the sympathoadrenal system is stimulated with exertion and both alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonists affect internal potassium homeostasis, we studied the influence of catecholamines on potassium shifts during and after exercise. Six healthy subjects were given maximal exercise stress tests under three conditions: with no medication (control), during beta-blockade with propranolol, and during alpha-blockade with phentolamine. Compared with a peak rise in plasma potassium of 1.23 +/- 0.27 mmol per liter (mean +/- S.E.M.) during the control study, propranolol caused a rise of 1.89 +/- 0.35 (P less than 0.01) and a sustained elevation during recovery. Phentolamine diminished the rise of potassium (0.70 +/- 0.21 mmol per liter; P less than 0.01) and lowered the potassium level throughout recovery. These effects of catecholamines were independent of the venous pH, the plasma bicarbonate and serum glucose levels, and urinary potassium excretion, and they did not appear to be due to insulin. High norepinephrine and epinephrine levels confirmed the release of catecholamines capable of stimulating alpha- and beta-receptors. Exercise work did not differ among the groups. beta-Adrenergic receptors appear to moderate the acute hyperkalemia of exercise, whereas alpha-adrenergic receptors act to enhance hyperkalemia and may protect against hypokalemia when exertion ceases.", 
    "44": "The beta-adrenoceptor antagonist pindolol, given p.o. (10 mg/kg, once a day for 7 days) to 4 and 24 week old male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY), decreased plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity only in young SHR. Kinetic studies indicated that the treatment reduced the ACE maximal velocity or the number of available ACE molecules. In vitro studies showed that pindolol had no direct effects on the activity of plasma ACE. A decrease in soluble (loosely bound) ACE activity was observed in the lung of young SHR treated with pindolol. The results suggest that pindolol affects the site of origin of plasma ACE. The susceptibility of young SHR to pindolol may indicate a probable role of beta-adrenoceptors in the regulation of ACE activity in spontaneous (genetic) hypertension.", 
    "45": "At the conclusion of a double-blinded, randomized clinical trial of propranolol hydrochloride, but before unblinding, the patients and clinic personnel were asked to guess the treatment group assignment of each patient. While 79.9% of the patients receiving propranolol correctly identified their treatment group assignment, 57.2% of the patients receiving placebo incorrectly guessed that they were also in the propranolol group. No specific mechanism was identified to explain why more patients receiving propranolol were better able to guess their group assignment. Clinic physicians correctly identified the group assignment of 69.9% of the patients receiving propranolol and 68.8% of the patients receiving placebo. Clinic coordinators correctly identified the group assignment of 67.1% of the patients receiving propranolol and 70.6% of the patients receiving placebo. For clinic personnel, heart rate level and heart rate change seem to be the mechanisms employed to identify their patients' treatment assignment.", 
    "46": "At the conclusion of the Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial (BHAT), a major research project sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, investigators conducted a survey to assess the effectiveness of the trial's double-blind design. Patients, physicians, and coordinators were asked to guess the treatment group assignment of each subject. Patients receiving the drug, propanolol, were better able to identify their assignment than those receiving a placebo. Clinic personnel were better able than the patients to differentiate between the two groups, probably due to their monitoring of patients' heart rates. The BHAT researchers concluded that, although double-blindness was not completely achieved, this fact did not influence the conduct of the trial, as no group differences in drug and visit compliance or in the use of concomitant therapy were found.", 
    "47": "The safety and efficacy of bepridil plus propranolol therapy were investigated in a placebo-controlled, parallel-design, double-blind trial in 56 patients who were not responding to propranolol alone. Patients entering the study were receiving an average propranolol dosage of 131 mg/day (range 20 to 240). For the first 2 weeks of the study they were given placebo in addition to their propranolol dose, and then were randomized to receive continued placebo plus propranolol or bepridil plus propranolol therapy. The bepridil dosage was adjusted over the 8 weeks of active treatment to an average of 273 mg/day (range 200 to 400). The double-blind treatment period was followed by a 3-week washout period during which all patients received propranolol and placebo. The effects of treatment on the frequency of angina attacks, nitroglycerin consumption, exercise performance (treadmill-modified Bruce protocol) and Holter electrocardiogram (ECG) were assessed. Propranolol and bepridil plasma levels also were obtained. Improved antianginal efficacy and reduced nitroglycerin consumption were noted when bepridil was added to propranolol (p less than 0.01). During 8 weeks of combination treatment, exercise tolerance increased 1.0 +/- 1.2 minutes from a baseline of 7.3 +/- 2.2 with bepridil plus propranolol compared with an increase of 0.02 +/- 1.3 minutes from a baseline of 7.6 +/- 2.9 with placebo plus propranolol (p less than 0.01). With bepridil plus propranolol, there were also increases in exercise time to onset of angina (p less than 0.04), exercise time to 1-mm electrocardiographic ST-segment depression (p less than 0.06) and total work (p less than 0.03) compared with placebo plus propranolol therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "48": "Calcium-channel blockers are known to have depressant effects on atrioventricular (AV) nodal conduction and myocardial contractility. Because of these known depressant effects, bepridil hydrochloride, a new, long-acting, antianginal and antiarrhythmic calcium-channel blocker, was administered intravenously to patients without heart failure to determine acute hemodynamic effects. The patients studied had normal ventricular function, were without electrocardiographic conduction disturbances and were taking no drug except sublingual nitroglycerin for at least 24 hours before bepridil infusion. The study protocol included right- and left-sided cardiac catheterization with infusion of bepridil at 2 mg/kg for 15 minutes followed by 1 mg/kg for 15 minutes in 10 patients, and infusion of bepridil at 3 mg/kg for 15 minutes followed by 1 mg/kg for 15 minutes in 8 patients. Pressures, Fick cardiac output, resistances, left ventricular (LV) dP/dt, LV stroke work index and rate-pressure product of the left ventricle were monitored. There were no significant changes during bepridil infusion at either dose for cardiac output, systemic vascular and pulmonary vascular resistances, LV stroke work index, heart rate, arterial blood pressure and rate-pressure product. There was mild depression of LV dP/dt during bepridil infusion. Further, LV end-diastolic pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and pulmonary arterial pressures were significantly increased during bepridil infusion. There were no apparent changes in AV nodal or intraventricular conduction during bepridil infusion. We conclude that bepridil appears to be a safe drug for intravenous administration despite mild depression of myocardial function in patients with normal baseline hemodynamic function who are not receiving concomitant beta-blocker therapy.",

After 3 weeks of therapy with 200 mg celiprolol 67,8% of the patients showed to be responders. 42 non responders were treated under double blind conditions for the following 3 weeks with 2 different dosages of chlorthalidone (12,5 mg or 25 mg CT) in combination with 200 mg celiprolol once daily. After 3 weeks of therapy 80,9% of the patients showed a satisfying reduction of blood pressure. There was no difference in terms of the extent of blood pressure reduction between the 2 combination treatment groups. A total of 73 patients who responded to celiprolol monotherapy or one of the combination therapies were treated up to 12 months. The data of 43 patients, who came to all monthly controls, could be evaluated. During the whole period of treatment a constant reduction of elevated blood pressure levels was obtained under treatment with 200 mg celiprolol or in combination with 12,5 mg or 25 mg CT. There was no negative influence on laboratory parameters under celiprolol or combination (12,5 mg CT) therapy.

Previous stimulation of the intact plexus tissue in vitro with sympathomimetic drugs or vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) leads to increased local synthesis of cAMP. Tests with selective beta-receptor agonists and antagonists suggested that beta 1-receptors predominate, which is consistent with studies of sympathomimetic effects on cerebrospinal fluid production in vivo.", 
    "51": "To determine the possible influence of studies on beta-blocker therapy following myocardial infarction and the introduction of calcium-channel blockers on the prescribing habits of physicians in a large urban centre, the drug therapy received by 100 patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) (50 with myocardial infarction and 50 with unstable angina) admitted to a university teaching hospital in 1980 was compared with that received by another such group of 100 patients admitted in 1983-84. The proportion of patients with myocardial infarction receiving drug therapy was significantly higher in 1983-84, at the time of both admission (p less than 0.01) and discharge (p less than 0.001). Much of the increase was due to greater use of beta-blockers. Of the 50 patients with unstable angina in 1983-84, 20 were taking calcium-channel blockers when admitted, and 29 were taking them when discharged. In both 1980 and 1983-84 unstable angina was treated more vigorously than myocardial infarction. The results suggest that physicians have developed a more aggressive approach to drug therapy for IHD since the publication of the beta-blocker studies and the introduction of calcium-channel blockers.", 
    "52": "Photoaffinity labeling of membrane-bound nicotinic acetylcholine receptor from Torpedo marmorata electric tissue with the ion-channel blocker [3H]TPMP+ reveals various functional states of the receptor protein if labeling is performed with ms time resolution. In the resting and in the activated state most of the label is incorporated into the alpha-polypeptide chains of the receptor complex. When equilibrated with agonists and antagonists, predominantly the delta-polypeptide chain (and to a lesser extent the beta-chain) reacts with the photolabel. Reactivity of the delta-chain increases after exposure to cholinergic effectors with a half-life slower than the kinetics of receptor activation or rapid desensitization. Agonists and antagonists stimulate photolabelling of the delta-chain with different kinetics. For acetylcholine, carbamoylcholine and suberyldicholine the half-life of the reactivity increases is 400 - 500 ms; for the antagonists hexamethonium, d-tubocurarine and flaxedil it is about 10 s. The latter slow kinetics are also observed when the receptor is preequilibrated with agonists or antagonists prior to mixing with [3H]TPMP+ and starting the photoreaction. We conclude that time-resolved photoaffinity labeling can convalently mark protein structures involved in receptor functions. Of special interest is the observation that antagonists also induce a conformational change in the receptor protein.", 
    "53": "Ovalbumin-induced histamine release from passively sensitized monodispersed cells (2-4% mast cells) or purified mast cells (50-78%) from guinea-pig lung was inhibited by isoproterenol and sulfonterol and their relative potencies or maximum responses were similar in both cases. The apparent dissociation constant for butoxamine was also independent of mast cell purity. The results indicate that beta-adrenoceptors mediating histamine release inhibition from lung are localized to mast cells and act independently of other cell types.", 
    "54": "The effects of dopamine and noradrenaline on amylase secretion from rat parotid gland were studied in a batch incubation system. Dopamine effectively caused amylase secretion but the concentration-response curve was shifted to the right in reserpinized animals, suggesting a minor indirect component in the action of dopamine. The noradrenaline-evoked secretion was the same in reserpinized glands as in the controls. Bromocriptine, a dopamine receptor agonist, was without effect on amylase secretion. The dopamine receptor antagonists pimozide, chlorpromazine, haloperidol and droperidol as well as SKF 38393 all effectively inhibited dopamine-induced amylase secretion without affecting the enzyme release caused by noradrenaline. The D-2 antagonist sulpiride was without effect on both dopamine- and noradrenaline-stimulated secretion. The dopamine-induced secretion was also significantly blocked by the non-selective beta-blocker propranolol as well as by beta 1- and beta 2-selective antagonists. Several alpha-antagonists were all partial blockers of dopamine-stimulated amylase secretion. In contrast, the noradrenaline-evoked amylase release was exclusively abolished by propranolol and beta 1-selective antagonists. The results suggest that the dopamine- and noradrenaline-induced amylase secretion are activated via different receptor systems, and that dopamine stimulation is mainly a postsynaptic D-1 effect and only to a minor extent due to presynaptic interaction.", 
    "55": "Experiments were performed in pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs to 1) determine if neural stimulation of renin release can be mediated by renal alpha-adrenoceptors at renal nerve stimulation (RNS) frequencies that have little or no effect on total renal blood flow (less than or equal to 1.2 Hz) and 2) ascertain whether alpha-adrenergic control of renin release is affected by renal perfusion pressure (RPP). The renal nerves were electrically stimulated both in the absence of RPP control and with RPP controlled near 85 mmHg. Decreased RPP lowered the threshold for neurogenic stimulation of renin release from less than or equal to 1.2 to 0.3 Hz. beta-Adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol blunted the renin secretion rate (RSR) response to graded RNS (0.3-5.0 Hz), but the extent of inhibition during low-frequency RNS was dependent on RPP. Propranolol prevented increased RSR at 0.6-1.2 Hz RNS when RPP was 111-120 mmHg but not when RPP was 85 mmHg. Combined alpha- and beta-blockade with prazosin and propranolol totally prevented increased RSR during 0.6-1.2 Hz RNS at reduced RPP. In summary, both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors mediate neural stimulation of renin release at RNS frequencies that do not decrease total renal blood flow when RPP is 85 mmHg.", 
    "56": "The effect of cationic amphiphilic drugs (CAD) on the synthesis of thiol esters of coenzyme A with long-chain fatty acids was studied in microsomes of rat brain in vitro. The results indicate that propranolol, tetracaine and to a lesser extent, chloroquine, inhibit enzyme activity. Procaine and lidocaine did not inhibit enzyme activity in concentrations up to 0.8 mM. This inhibition seems to be directed primarily to the synthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acyl coenzyme A. The results also suggest that this inhibition may be due to the action of CAD on the microsomal membrane and not to an interaction of these drugs with the fatty acid substrates.", 
    "57": "gamma-Endorphin-type peptides (i.e. gamma-endorphin, des-tyr'-gamma-endorphin [DT gamma E]) result from the processing of the opioid peptide, beta-endorphin. Previous studies have implicated the involvement of beta-endorphin in various types of shock, including anaphylactic shock. In the present experiments the intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of gamma-endorphin (10 micrograms) or DT gamma E (3.3-10 micrograms) significantly improved survival in anaphylactic shock in mice. Moreover, DT gamma E (10 micrograms) reversed the effect of i.c.v. beta-endorphin (3.3 micrograms) to exacerbate shock. A similar dose of DT gamma E was ineffective in antagonizing beta-endorphin-induced analgesia. The anti-anaphylactic action of DT gamma E as well as its effect to block the pro-anaphylactic action of beta-endorphin were prevented by pretreatment with the sympathetic ganglionic blocker, chlorisondamine chloride. The results suggest that gamma-endorphin-type peptides may act in the central nervous system (CNS) to physiologically oppose the autonomic pathophysiologic influences of beta-endorphin.", 
    "58": "Treatment of isolated hepatocytes with the tumor-promoting agent, 4 beta-phorbol 12 beta-myristate 13 alpha-acetate (PMA) produced a time- and dose-dependent, non-competitive inhibition of alpha 1-adrenergic responses, including the activation of phosphorylase, increase in Ca2+ efflux, increase in free cytosolic Ca2+, and release of myo-inositol-1,4,5-P3. The actions of [8-arginine] vasopressin (AVP) on liver cells were also inhibited by PMA, but the inhibition could be overcome by high AVP concentrations. No significant inhibition of beta-adrenergic and glucagon-mediated activation of phosphorylase was induced by PMA and no inhibitory or synergistic effects of PMA were observed on the dose-dependent activation of phosphorylase by the Ca2+ ionophore A23187. In radioligand binding studies, PMA did not directly interfere with [3H]prazosin specific binding, the displacement of [3H]prazosin by (-)-norepinephrine nor with [3H]AVP specific binding to purified liver plasma membranes. Plasma membranes prepared from livers perfused with PMA exhibited a 30-44% reduction in [3H]prazosin binding capacity. Under identical conditions [3H]AVP binding was unchanged. The alpha 1-receptors remaining in membranes from PMA-treated livers had equivalent affinities for [3H]prazosin and (-)-norepinephrine, and were unaffected in terms of coupling to guanine nucleotide-regulating proteins as indicated by the ability of guanosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imido)triphosphate to promote the conversion of the remaining alpha 1-receptors into a low affinity state. These data indicate that tumor promoters are potent antagonists of alpha 1-adrenergic and vasopressin (low dose) responses in liver. It is proposed that PMA acting via protein kinase C (which presumably mediates the action of PMA) exerts its inhibitory action on alpha 1-adrenergic responses at the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor itself and also at a site close to or before myo-inositol-1,4,5-P3 release.", 
    "59": "Highly purified sarcolemmal membranes prepared from bovine heart muscle produced superoxide radicals, especially when incubated with NADPH or NADH, as revealed by the oxidation of adrenaline to adrenochrome. The reaction was inhibited by superoxide dismutase or by heat denaturation of the sarcolemmal vesicles. Less evident was the inhibitory effect shown by catalase, while mannitol, deferoxamine or dicumarol were uneffective. The formation of adrenochrome was an oxygen-dependent reaction with a Km for adrenaline of 8-10 microM. Moreover, the reaction was inhibited by preincubating the sarcolemmal membranes with propranolol, while the alpha-antagonist phentolamine was without effect. Adrenaline oxidation was unaffected by the presence of exogenous linolenic acid or methylarachidonic acid, while arachidonic acid, with a Km for this reaction of 175 microM, showed a marked stimulatory effect. This activation was suppressed by superoxide dismutase, catalase and NaCN, while mannitol was without effect. Moreover, the reaction was blocked by the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin, differently from the lipooxygenase inhibitor nordihydroguaiaretic acid. Also, the incubation of the sarcolemmal vesicles with phospholipase A2 and calcium produced a stimulation of adrenochrome formation which was partially suppressed by albumin. In the experiments using arachidonic acid or phospholipase A2, the addition of indomethacin blocked the adrenaline oxidation. These results indicate that arachidonic acid accentuated the heart sarcolemmal adrenochrome formation presumably by participating in the cyclooxygenase reaction.", 
    "60": "Scrambled DC current applied to the hind paws of rats caused an analgesic response that was inhibited by the histamine H2-receptor antagonists cimetidine, ranitidine and oxmetidine, but not by high doses of naloxone (the opiate antagonist), or other transmitter receptor antagonists. In contrast, AC current applied to all paws produced analgesia that was blocked by naloxone, but not cimetidine, showing the independence of these systems. These findings indicate a specific role for histamine and H2-receptors as mediators of endogenous non-opiate analgesia. In addition, a combination of cimetidine and naloxone did not abolish either form of footshock analgesia, implying the existence of a non-opiate, non-H2, endogenous pain-relieving system. These results also suggest that drugs capable of penetrating the brain and stimulating H2-receptors might have analgesic properties.", 
    "61": "We have undertaken the present study to evaluate the acute effects of propranolol and verapamil on the diastolic function in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We used a non imaging isotope device, the nuclear stethoscope, that has been so far mainly employed for assessment of systolic function, although fitted for detecting diastolic filling rates and times as well. Relative cardiac output, ejection fraction, rapid and slow filling times and rates were measured in five patients suffering from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in basal conditions and 10.20 and 30 minutes after i.v. administration for either propranolol or verapamil, with a time interval of at least 24 hours between the two acute drug studies. With respect to the baseline values only verapamil showed a significant improvement in rapid and maximum filling rates, suggesting that diastolic function is more beneficially affected by Ca-entry blockers rather than beta-blockers in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.", 
    "62": "An autopsy case of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy with extensive myocardial fibrosis is reported in a 43-year-old male. His mother died suddenly at 55. At the age of 39 the patient felt fatigue and feverish sensation followed by dyspnea and palpitation on exertion. He responded to beta-blocker and was discharged on the 51st hospital day. He died suddenly during his work three years and one month after discharge. The heart weighs 700 g. The thickness of the ventricular septum measures up to 3.2 cm, and that of the left ventricular posterior wall 2.2 cm. Subaortic endocardium is moderately thickened. Many patchy fibroses of various sizes and broad linear fibroses are mainly observed in the ventricular septum and in the left ventricular free wall. Microscopic examination shows severe fascicular disarray of hypertrophied myocardial fibers in the ventricular septum and in a part of the left ventricular anterior wall. Pericardial fibrosis, granulation tissue with many capillaries, and slight lymphocytic infiltrate are also noted. These findings suggest that the patient have both congenital hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and myocarditis. There are following possibilities as regards the relation between the two: first, haphazard association of cardiomyopathy with myocarditis; secondly, myocarditis triggered the onset or progression, or both, of cardiomyopathy. He also had liver cirrhosis, probably alcoholic, which appears to accelerate the progression of myocardial disarray and fibrosis.", 
    "63": "Calcium-channel blockers are useful for the treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), but, their adverse effects, especially, those of diltiazem, have not been of much concern. Forty patients with HCM were treated with calcium-channel blockers such as nifedipine, diltiazem, and verapamil. Atrial fibrillation was induced by diltiazem in two patients and verapamil induced syncope in one patient. The clinical and hemodynamic characteristics of the patients were as follows. All of them had the obstructive type of HCM (HOCM). One of them had a high pressure gradient of the left ventricular outflow tract and the others had earlier onset. In these patients, the left atrial overload seemed to be severe. The vasodilating action of calcium-channel blockers decreases the systemic pressure and in turn, may increase the pressure gradient and the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. The elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure causes the left atrial overload which could be at risk of atrial fibrillation in patients with HCM. Therefore, calcium-channel blockers should be used carefully in peculiar cases of HOCM.", 
    "64": "Acute administration of ethanol (4.0 g/kg) intragastrically or intraperitoneally induced rat liver tryptophan oxygenase (TO) activity 3-4 fold 4-5 hr later. Ethanol administration increased the concentration of plasma free tryptophan and free fatty acids. Pretreatment with a beta-receptor blocker, propranolol, modified the latter responses without affecting the TO induction due to ethanol. The rise of the level of plasma free tryptophan due to ethanol was too small to influence TO activity. Liver tryptophan concentration and TO half-life was unchanged after ethanol administration. Ethanol administration increased the concentration of plasma corticosterone sufficiently to increase TO activity. Pretreatment with a glucocorticoid antagonist blocked this TO response to ethanol. The increased TO activities found after ethanol or corticosterone treatment were influenced in the same manner and to the same extent by cycloheximide. Taken together it is concluded that ethanol induces TO through a rise of glucocorticoid hormones and not by a tryptophan-linked mechanism.", 
    "65": "The efficacy of verapamil and propranolol was studied in comparison with disopyramide on the atrial fibrillation experimentally induced in the dog heart in situ by electrical stimulation combined with intra-aortic injection of acetylcholine (ACh). After reducing the amplitude and duration of the monophasic action potential (MAP) and the duration of the effective refractory period (ERP) of the atrial contractile fibres, ACh lowered the fibrillation threshold (FT), and, when fibrillation had been elicited, it accelerated the fibrillation rate (FR). Verapamil and propranolol failed to prevent atrial fibrillation: they did not counteract any of the alterations in the electrophysiological properties of the atrial contractile fibres due to ACh. In contrast, disopyramide, at doses within the therapeutic range, prevented fibrillation. The fibrillation threshold, which fell from 50 mA to 1 mA in the presence of ACh, was restored to control values by disopyramide. Disopyramide also antagonized the reduction in amplitude of MAP caused by ACh before the triggering of fibrillation and the reductions by ACh of the durations of MAP and ERP. Disopyramide first slowed FR, in association with an increase in amplitude of fibrillation waves and a tendency to synchronous activity, and ultimately terminated the fibrillation."
