Propranolol at high concentrations (3 x 10(-5)-10(-4) M) produced relaxations of the coronary arterial strips, which were restored or prevented by exogenous calcium ions. Atenolol (10(-5)-10(-4) M) never changed the tension of the strips. The results suggest that propranolol may inhibit the coronary arteries through its calcium antagonistic action.", 
    "1": "Visual reaction times as a measure of vigilance and of the psycho-physiological condition of subjects was determined after combined physical and mental stress to examine beta-blocker influence. Using the technique of electrooculography 40 subjects aged 25,7 +/- 6 with a mean blood pressure to 126/79 mmHg were measured in a double-blind cross-over design after application of placebo or 50 mg of atenolol (Tenormin) for 3 days. Visual reaction time was defined as the time between display of a peripheral light signal and the start of the eye movement that shifts the direction of gaze from the reference point to the stimulus. The results of the study show, that under these experimental conditions there is a positive effect of beta-blocker medication on vigilance. Findings of other authors are discussed. To prove the sensitivity of the test method in a preliminary study, the effects of the well-described drugs fenetyllinhydrochloride, diazepam, oxazepam and alcohol on visual reaction time were investigated.", 
    "2": "Treatment of adult rats with a beta-adrenergic blocking agent (propranolol) induced a paradoxical sleep deficit which was dose-related. This deficit could be completely corrected by intraventricular perfusion with a beta-agonist (isoproterenol), according to a dose-dependent function. The beta-adrenergic receptors may therefore be specifically involved in the regulation of paradoxical sleep.", 
    "3": "Propranolol was administered intravenously to 12 patients with presumed acute myocardial infarction in the attempt to limit infarct size. Patients' conditions were uncomplicated (heart rate greater than or equal to 60/min, systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 100 mm Hg, mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure mean [PCWP] less than or equal to 20 mm mercury). The aim was to produce beta-blockade that was early, complete, and continuous. Target loading dose was achieved in seven patients and full maintenance was achieved in six patients. The remaining patients received smaller loading or maintenance doses or both because of varying degrees of bradycardia, hypotension, or elevated mean PCWP. Myocardial CK release in the propranolol group was 2651 mIU/ml +/- 843 (mean +/- SE, n = 12) vs 2987 mIU/ml +/- 422 in 21 comparison patients, a difference not statistically significant. The time to CK plateau (completion of infarction) was related to total CK release in both propranolol and comparison patients.", 
    "4": "Beta adrenoceptor blockers differ mainly in their plasma elimination half-lives (t 1/2 s). It has been assumed that drugs with longer t 1/2 will have a longer duration of effect on exercise tachycardia. Several factors may influence the duration of action of beta blockers; we have investigated the contribution of plasma elimination t 1/2 and dose by comparing the effects on an exercise tachycardia in healthy subjects of placebo, 25, 50, 100, and 200 mg of atenolol and of sotalol, and 50, 100, 200, and 400 mg metoprolol. Subjects exercised before and at 2, 3, 6, 8, 24, 33, and 48 hr after oral doses of each drug. Plasma samples for measurement of drug concentration were drawn before each exercise period. Twenty-four hours after 50, 100, and 200 mg atenolol and 50, 100, 200, and 400 mg sotalol there were reductions in an exercise tachycardia; at this time reductions were greater after the larger doses. The plasma elimination t 1/2s of atenolol were between 7.2 +/0 1.0 hr. Although 50, 100, and 200 mg metoprolol induced the same reductions in an exercise tachycardia 2 hr after drug as 25, 50, and 100 mg atenolol and 50, 100, and 200 mg sotalol, these doses were without effect at 24 hr. Metoprolol 400 mg reduced exercise tachycardia at 24 hr but the effect was less than that of the three largest doses of atenolol and sotalol. The plasma elimination t 1/2 for metoprolol was between 3.6 +/- 0.6 and 5.0 +/- 1.8 hr. These results show that duration of cardiac beta blocking of cardiac beta blocking activity of atenolol, sotalol, and metoprolol is determined by the elimination t 1/2 and dose.", 
    "5": "Nine patients with chronic severe low output heart failure (radionuclide left ventricular ejection fraction 17 +/- 5 percent [mean +/- standard deviation], left ventricular filling pressure 26 +/- 6 mm Hg, cardiac index 1.9 +/- 0.4 liters/min per m2, left ventricular stroke work index 18 +/- 6 g-m/m2) from various causes were treated with intravenous prenalterol (a new catecholamine-like inotropic agent) in doses of 1,4 and 8 mg. Significant hemodynamic improvement occurred as measured by increased left ventricular ejection fraction (to 26 +/- 4 percent), decreased left ventricular filling pressure (to 21 +/- 8 mm Hg) and increased cardiac index (to 2.4 +/- 0.6 liters/min per m2) and left ventricular stroke work index (to 25 +/- 8 g-m/m2). Significant increases in heart rate (from 87 +/- 18 to 91 +/- 18 beats/min) and mean systemic arterial pressure (from 87 +/- 8 to 92 +/- 7 mm Hg) also occurred. Peak hemodynamic response occurred at various doses. Significant adverse effects associated with prenalterol consisted of increased ventricular ectopic beats in two patients and asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia in two patients. Thus, intravenous prenalterol produces hemodynamic improvement in patients with a chronic severe low output state but may be associated with increased ventricular ectopic activity.", 
    "6": "Ten cases of chaotic atrial tachycardia (CAT) in childhood are reported. Patients' ages ranged from 1 day to 18 years (average, 3.5 years) at the time of diagnosis. The patients were divided into groups according to the following criteria: (1) no cardiac disease (n = 5), (2) congenital heart disease (n = 4), and (3) acquired heart disease (n = 1). Nine of the children were treated with digoxin; however, it appears there was no beneficial effect. In fact, the single death in our study group may have been attributable to digitalis intoxication. No children have had recurrence of the arrhythmia after discontinuation of the drug. The duration of the tachyarrhythmia was extremely variable; however, CAT was well tolerated and was self-limiting in our patients.", 
    "7": "Effective use of modern antihypertensive agents requires an intimate understanding of the various side effects associated with each of the drugs. Some of the undesirable side effects are unavoidable because they are inherent in the action of the drug. For example, hypokalemia and hyperuricemia are inherent side effects of diuretic therapy. Other adverse reactions are idiosyncratic and difficult to predict. With careful monitoring and individual therapeutic planning, these side effects need not inhibit efforts to control hypertension.", 
    "8": "The effect of beta-adrenergic blockade with oral propranolol on resting, exercise and postexercise ventricular performance was evaluated using multiple-gated equilibrium cardiac blood and pool images in normal volunteers and patients with coronary artery disease. Propranolol produced no detectable effect on basal left ventricular function in normal subjects at doses producing intermediate (160 mg propranolol/day) and maximal (434 +/- 99 mg propranolol/day) beta blockade and in patients with coronary artery disease at clinically effective antianginal doses (162 +/- 47 mg propranolol/day). During exercise, a dose-related, negative inotropic effect was observed in normal subjects: 160 mg propranolol/day produced a small but statistically insignificant decline in exercise left ventricular performance, whereas maximal beta blockade significantly depressed the left ventricular response to exercise. In patients with coronary artery disease, propranolol's effect on exercise ventricular performance depended on the presence or absence of ischemic dysfunction during exercise. In patients with an ischemic functional response to exercise, propranolol significantly improved regional and global performance during and after exercise; in coronary artery disease patients with a normal response to exercise, propranolol had no significant effect on exercise and postexercise ventricular function. These results imply increased sensitivity to the effects of beta blockade in ischemic myocardium. In coronary artery disease patients with an abnormal response to exercise and in normal volunteers during beta blockade, propranolol's effect on exercise left ventricular performance was independent of changes in ventricular preload and after load related to heart rate and blood pressure.", 
    "9": "The Ca++-dependent propranolol-induced increase of K+ permeability of human red blood cells, well documented in previous studies, was found to depend on extracellular K+. This was shown by studying the passive transport of 86Rb and the loss of bulk cellular K+ in both K+-free and K+-containing media. The maximal effect of propranolol was achieved with 5-10 mM K+ in incubation media. The external K+ could be substituted with Tl+, but not with Na+. When added after propranolol, extracellular K+ failed to initiate the effect of propranolol on membrane permeability. The cell/medium distribution of permeant 204Tl showed that the propranolol-induced increase of K+ permeability did not result in considerable hyperpolarization of the red blood cell membrane. The data obtained seem to be more consistent with a counter-transport model for explaining the propranolol effect than with a mechanism based on free diffusion of K+ through the membrane.", 
    "10": "It was earlier found that Tl+ can easily penetrate the red cell membrane. The main finding of this work is that Tl+ can be used for studying alterations in the membrane potential of human red blood cells exposed to various experimental conditions. It was shown that after inhibiting active transport by ouabain, both the rate of trans-membrane movement and the cell/medium distribution of Tl+ were in a good agreement with the expected changes in membrane potential. Alterations in membrane potential were induced by modifying the cation permeability of the red cell membrane and by varying the cation concentration gradient across the membrane, which were achieved: 1) by incubation in an electrolyte-free sucrose solution. 2) by addition of valinomycin or 3) by addition of propranolol. Changes in cation permeability were followed by means of 86Rb tracer. Hyperpolarization of the red cell membrane led to accelerated influx and retarded efflux of Tl+. The opposite effect was obtained by depolarization. Quantification of the results was made using the Nernst equation and the cell/medium concentration ratio of Tl+ at equilibrium. The calculations show that the membrane potential of the propranolol-treated cells increased to about -20 mV, negative inside. The mechanism of the propranolol effect is briefly discussed.", 
    "11": "We observed elevation of serum CPK in hypertensive patients under pindolol treatment. In this report, we showed a representative patient and compared serum CPK values in 56 patients under pindolol treatment to those in 64 patients under propranolol treatment. Mean serum CPK values in the patients under pindolol treatment and propranolol treatment were 117.0 +/- 12.6 (S.E.) and 50.8 +/- 3.8 IU/liter, respectively (p less than 0.01). Although the mechanism of elevation of serum CPK cannot be well understood, we should be careful in clinical evaluation of serum CPK during pindolol treatment.", 
    "12": "The pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of diacetolol, the principal metabolite of acebutolol, were studied in 6 healthy subjects. Plasma concentrations were determined following a single intravenous injection of diacetolol 100 mg and three oral doses of diacetolol 100, 400 and 800 mg, in random order. The average oral bioavailability of diacetolol was F: 0.302 +/- 0.052 (100 mg), 0.363 +/- 0.052 (400 mg) and 0.426 +/- 0.068 (800 mg); the differences are not significant. The mean plasma half-life of the terminal phase, 7.94 +/- 0.26 h after intravenous administration, was significantly higher than after oral administration 12.27 +/- 1.00 h (100 mg), 12.82 +/- 1.59 h (400 mg) and 13.05 +/- 13.05 +/- 1.22 h (800 mg) (p less than 0.02 to 0.05); the mean urine half-lives of the terminal phase were not significantly different. Renal clearance of diacetolol 10.2 +/- 0.81 . h-1 represented about wo-thirds of total body clearance 15.9 +/- 1.21 . h-1. The results suggest either a first-pass effect or incomplete absorption of diacetolol after oral administration.", 
    "13": "Resistography was used to demonstrate in acute experiments on anesthetized cats that intravenous injection of clofelin (2,6 and 10 microgram/kg) and apressin (1, 2.5 and 5 microgram/kg) induced a dose-dependent decline in the arterial blood pressure which was not infrequently preceded by short-lived hypertension. Clofelin induced an increase in the tone of cerebral vessels while apressin reduced it. As regards femoral vessels both the drugs produced diverse (sometimes phasic) reactions, with vasodilation being predominant.", 
    "14": "Heart failure was induced in barbital-anesthetized dogs by administering high doses of pentobarbital. This procedure depresses cardiac function as indicated by a reduction in right ventricular contractile force (RVCF), left ventricular dp/dt and aortic blood flow. Bucindolol (0.1 mg/kg and 0.1 mg/kg/hr) elicited a pronounced and prolonged stimulant effect on these depressed indicators of cardiac function. Both RVCF and aortic blood flow returned to pre-failure levels, left ventricular dp/dt increased 43% but heart rate was elevated only slightly (14%). Total peripheral resistance was lowered 36% by bucindolol. The combination of myocardial stimulation and vasodilatation which contributed to the positive results in this acute model of pump failure suggests a possible role for bucindolol in the clinical management of congestive heart failure. Further these results suggest that bucindolol, in contrast to propranolol, could also be used in a sub-group of hypertensive patients with depressed cardiac function.", 
    "15": "1 The anti-hypertensive effects of intravenously and intracisternally administered (+/-)-propranolol were studied in anaesthetized dogs with acute neurogenic (sino-aortic denervation) hypertension. The animals were pretreated 7 days earlier with intracisternally administered 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT 200 microgram/kg plus desipramine 5 mg/kg i.v.). 2 5,7-DHT (plus desipramine) failed to decrease both basic blood pressure and heart rate measured before sino-aortic denervation. After 5,7-DHT (plus desipramine) pretreatment, acute sino-aortic denervation induced a rise in blood pressure and stimulated the heart rate, these effects being similar (in intensity and duration) to those observed in control (saline-pre-treated) debuffered dogs during the first hour following the deafferentation. 3 In debuffered dogs, (+/-)-propranolol given by intracisternal (50 microgram/kg) or intravenous (300 microgram/kg) routes decreased both blood pressure and heart rate. 4 5,-DHT (plus desipramine) pretreatment abolished the antihypertensive effect of intracisternal propranolol whereas the action of intravenous propranolol was only delayed. In contrast, this pretreatment failed to reduce and even sometimes enhanced the negative chronotropic response induced by propranolol. 5 These results suggest that central 5-hydroxytryptaminergic pathways play an important role in the acute hypotension elicited by intracisternal (+/-)-propranolol in debuffered hypertensive anaesthetized dogs, but little, if any in propranolol-induced bradycardia.", 
    "16": "Phalloidin, one of the main toxins of Amanita phalloides, induced hepatotoxicity in female Wistar rats at 0.9 mg/kg dose i.p. Biliary secretion was selectively inhibited after 3h, but was restored after 24 h. Phalloidin also induced a cytolytic lesion, but not a fatty liver, as in alpha-amanitin intoxication. Propranolol pretreatment (30 min prior to phalloidin injection) did not afford protection against hepatotoxicity, but increased alkaline phosphatase, 5'-nucleotidase and aminotransferase activities.", 
    "17": "In recent studies were reported an inherited membrane defect which is closely related to the development of essential hypertension. This abnormality consists of a functional deficiency in the Na+--K+ co-transport mechanism in erythrocytes of essential hypertensives and some normotensives born of hypertensive parents. Here we report a case of juvenile essential hypertension including familial erythrocyte Na+, K+ measurements. The 2-year-old boy had essential hypertension and bore the abnormality, with no compensatory activity of the Na+, K+ pump. The mother had developed hypertension during pregnancy. She also bore the erythrocyte abnormality as the net Na+/K+ flux ratio was reduced. One sister bore the same abnormality without hypertension but a complete analysis of Na+ extrusion mechanisms in this patient demonstrated a compensatory effect of the Na+, K+ pump activity. Other members of the family were normotensive without the flux abnormality. It appears therefore that erythrocyte flux measurements might be of diagnostic and genetic interest in juvenile hypertension.", 
    "18": "Thirty-eight eyes were treated by adding timolol to the medical regimen. After a suitable trial, attempts were made to reduce other glaucoma medications. Fifteen eyes with infantile glaucoma treated surgically at birth, experienced elevated intraocular pressure later in life. Another 15 eyes had glaucoma associated with congenital anomalies such as aniridia, Sturge-Weber syndrome, and mesodermal malformations. The group with infantile glaucoma demonstrated an average drop in pressure of 24% and 22% after one and three months, respectively. Six of the 15 eyes were controlled at 22 mm Hg or less. In the other group, intraocular pressure fell 30% after one month and 12% after three months. Five of the 15 eyes were controlled. Adverse effects occurred in five patients, timolol therapy was discontinued in two (7%). The IOP was not controlled in any of the eyes with timolol alone.", 
    "19": "Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) early after cataract extraction with alpha-chymotrypsin is a well-described, common occurrence. To study the incidence of pressure increase and the efficacy of medical therapy, IOP was monitored every 12 hours beginning on the first postoperative day in 68 patients after otherwise uncomplicated intracapsular cataract extraction performed with one milliliter of alpha-chymotrypsin and wound closure with multiple sutures. Patients were randomly assigned to one of three groups: treatment with oral acetazolamide, treatment with topical timolol, or no treatment. Without prophylactic treatment, the prevalence of pressure elevation at 24 hours postoperatively was 69% with IOP greater than or equal to 25 mm Hg; 29% with IOP greater than or equal to 40 mm Hg. This was independent of the type of sutures used (10--0 nylon or 9--0 silk). The patients of four different surgeons had similar rates of occurrence of postoperative glaucoma. Both timolol and acetazolamide were essentially equally effective in lowering IOP in these patients. No adverse side effects were observed. With these effective treatments available if needed, we believe that routine monitoring of the IOP by applanation tonometry during the early postoperative course provides a good opportunity for reducing the risk of complications from excessive intraocular pressure.", 
    "20": "Distribution of local temperature in the anterior segment was investigated after topical administration of Timolol 0.5% utilizing infrared thermography. Eighty patients were included in this study; the untreated eye was used as a control. Within 30 minutes of instillation of Timolol a decrease in local temperature of up to 3 degrees C could be observed in 44% of the cases, whereas in 32% no change and in the remaining 24% a small increase of up to 1 degree C occurred. In ten other patients thermography and applanation tonometry were carried out simultaneously over a period of 4 hours following topical administration of Timolol; in this preliminary series a maximal local temperature decrease occurred after 90 minutes, i.e., prior to the maximal effect on intraocular pressure. It is concluded from these results that topical administration of Timolol reduces the ciliary blood flow.", 
    "21": "Criteria for the choice of drug dosage are established. In mild changes of pulmonary hemodynamics in patients with hypertensive disease, minimum doses of hypothiazide are recommended, while treatment should be conducted with obsidan, for the main part. In considerable attendant disorders of pulmonary hemodynamics the dose of hypothiazide should be proportionally increased, while the dose of obsidan is reduced.", 
    "22": "The values of central and regional hemodynamics were studied in 80 patients with hypertensive disease mainly of stage IIB by means of tetra- and bipolar rheography in different periods of treatment with obsidan, apressin and their combination. It was established that obsidan reduces the cardiac output and increases by reflex peripheral vascular resistance, while apressin reduces the vascular tonus and stimulates by reflex cardiac activity. Apressin caused a significant improvement in cerebral and peripheral circulation, but the asymmetry of cerebral and leg rheograms increased in these instances. In obsidan therapy the tonus of cerebral arteries diminished to a lesser degree while the tonus of the leg arteries was often increased, but the inter-hemispheric asymmetry of the rheoencephalogram and the limb rheograms diminished. The combined use of these drugs corrects undesirable effects in regard to the haemodynamic structure and potentiates the hypotensive effect.", 
    "23": "1 Plasma concentrations of metoprolol and a pharmacologically active metabolite, H119/66, have been measured in young and elderly volunteers after a single dose of 100 mg metoprolol tartrate and after repeated administrated over a period of 1 week. Whilst concentrations of metoprolol are similar in each group, concentrations of H119/66 are approximately twice as high in the elderly. 2 Concentrations of unchanged metoprolol and of the major, but pharmacologically inactive, metabolite, H117/04, together with the two active metabolites of metoprolol have been determined in urine. Only the excretion of metoprolol was diminished in the elderly. 3 Areas under the plasma concentration curve for metoprolol after repeated administration are greater than would be predicted from single dose data, and possible explanations for this are discussed. Concentrations of the pharmacologically active metabolite, H119/66, remain unaltered during chronic dosing of metoprolol. 4 This study has shown that the effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of metoprolol and its metabolites is less pronounced than that observed for other drugs.", 
    "24": "1 The acute cardiovascular effects of acebutolol were measured at constant paced heart rate in thirteen patients investigated for possible coronary artery disease, six of whom showed significant coronary stenosis with regional myocardial dysfunction, seven of whom proved normal. Acebutolol 0.75 mg/kg i.v. was given to three patients with coronary artery disease and three normals, and 1 mg/kg i.v. to the other patients.2 Measurements were made of cardiac output, left ventricular and arterial pressures, and left ventricular angiography. Isovolumic and ejection phase parameters of left ventricular function, and systemic vascular resistance were derived. Plasma levels of acebutolol were measured. 3 The acute effects of acebutolol were a slight fall in cardiac output, LV dp/dt and dP/dt/P. There was no change in LV or arterial pressures, no consistent change in LVEDP or EDV, and no consistent change in ejection fraction or mean VCF. These changes imply a small negative inotropic effect, more marked at the higher dose. 4 The effects of acebutolol differed in patients with ischaemic heart disease compared with normals in that LVEDP and EDV increased, mean VCF decreased and cardiac output was lowered more. 5 These data are consistent with myocardial and vascular effects of beta-adrenoceptor blockade more marked at the higher dose and more marked in patients with ischaemic heart disease.", 
    "25": "1. In adult conscious sheep the pressor actions of infused angiotensin II were prevented by the concomitant intravenous infusions of sodium nitroprusside. The effect of such intravenous infusions of angiotensin II on the cardiac baroreflex response to transient rises in arterial pressure caused by intravenous phenylephrine was studied. 2. Intravenous infusion of angiotensin II caused a reduction in pulse interval in the absence of any change in arterial pressure. It also caused a reduction in baroreflex sensitivity measured by determining the relation between pulse interval and systolic pressure during the rise in pressure caused by injection of phenylephrine. 3. After administration of the converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril) the mean baroreflex sensitivity of 3 of 4 pregnant ewes increased. 4. It is concluded that high levels of angiotensin II can modify the cardiac baroreceptor reflex response so that the heart rate is inappropriately high for a given systolic pressure and that it reduces the sensitivity of the cardiac baroreflex response to transient changes in arterial pressure.", 
    "26": "Administration of L-5-hydroxytryptophan (25 mg/kg body weight, SC) to female rats resulted in copious drinking. The dipsogenic response to administration of L-5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) was blocked by propranolol (6 mg/kg body weight, IP), a beta-adrenergic antagonist, and captopril (35 mg/kg body weight, IP), an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. In addition, clonidine (12.5 and 25 microgram/kg body weight, IP), a central alpha-adrenergic agonist known to inhibit renin release, attenuated drinking during 1, 2 and 3 hours after 5-HTP was administered. These results suggest that 5-HTP-induced drinking is mediated by way of the renin-angiotensin system. Haloperidol (150 microgram/kg body weight, IP), a dopaminergic antagonist, also attenuated the dipsogenic response to administration of 5-HTP. In addition, incremental reductions in 5-HTP-induced drinking with increasing doses of spiperone (37.5 to 150 microgram/kg body weight, IP), a more potent dopaminergic antagonist, were demonstrated. Thus, the dipsogenic response to administration of 5-HTP to rats is dependent on both the renin-angiotensin system and an intact dopaminergic pathway.", 
    "27": "Eyes undergoing routine intracapsular cataract extraction (without alpha-chymotrypsin) often experience marked ocular hypertension in the first six hours after surgery. We conducted a randomized, prospective, double-blind study to determine if timolol maleate would prevent this increase in pressure. Thirty-five eyes undergoing routine cataract extraction were given a drop of either timolol 0.5% or placebo twice before and twice after surgery. Nine (56.3%) of 16 control eyes and 2 (10.5%) of 19 timolol-treated eyes had pressures above 30 mm Hg at six hours after surgery (P less than 0.025). Thus, prophylactic timolol 0.5% can substantially reduce the incidence of severe early postoperative ocular hypertension.", 
    "28": "This collaborative study involves 39 investigators and shows the effects of timolol maleate when used short-term on large numbers of patients (418). Intraocular pressure response is excellent. Statistical analyses of pressure response are done using random sampling. Patient complaints were monitored during the study and present interesting findings. Very few adverse reactions were reported.", 
    "29": "In a randomized, double-blind, cross-over study lasting eight months and involving 40 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma, the pressure-lowering effects of 0.25-0.5% timolol maleate were compared those of 0.1% epinephrine hydrochloride and 1% epinephrine. Timolol maleate was significantly more effective in reducing elevated IOP, both before cross-over and overall at both the lowest and highest concentrations of drug used; it was also without adverse side effects. The observed and reported adverse reactions during the epinephrine treatment period, such as blepharoconjunctivitis, burning and stinging after drug instillation, occurred less frequently with 0.1% epinephrine hydrochloride than with 1% epinephrine, whereas reduction of IOP was almost the same.", 
    "30": "Rats were provided both with brain cannulas, to permit infusion in the ventromedial and lateral hypothalamic areas (resp. VMH and LH), and with two heart catheters. In this way infusions of fluids and withdrawal of blood could be done in unanesthetized free moving animals. Infusion of norepinephrine (NE) in the VMH elicited glucagon release during the whole period of NE infusion whereas insulin levels did not change. This glucagon release could not be suppressed by alpha- and beta-receptor blockade but it was suppressed by hexamethonium, a blocking agent of signal transmission in peripheral ganglia of the autonomic nervous system. On the other hand, infusion of NE in the LH elicited insulin release during the whole period of NE infusion whereas glucagon levels remained unchanged. It is argued that [1] the sympathetic nervous system is involved in glucagon release, [2] no alpha- and beta-receptor mechanisms are involved during this glucagon release, [3] the parasympathetic nervous system is involved in insulin release during noradrenergic LH stimulation.", 
    "31": "Experimental evidence has recently accumulated indicating that administration of some prostaglandins (PGs), particularly those of the E series, can evoke release of glucagon by the pancreatic alpha-cells. Virtually, all the in vitro studies (isolated perfused rat pancreas, isolated guinea-pig islets) agree that PGs can increase both basal and stimulated glucagon release. On the other hand, inhibition of PG synthesis with indomethacin blocks glucagon release. In rats and in normal humans, PGE1, but not PGA2 or PGF2a, causes a progressive rise of plasma glucagon levels. While in the rat this response seems independent of the adrenergic nervous system, in man the hyperglucagonemia induced by PGE1 is easily suppressed by propranolol, suggesting an interaction between the prostaglandin and the beta-receptors of the alpha-cell. Studies with inhibitors of PG synthesis in vivo have yielded conflicting results, depending on the particular experimental protocol used and on the type of inhibitor tested. In normal humans, it seems that acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) has no effect on glucagon response to arginine, tolbutamide and insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Conversely, a stimulator of PG synthesis, such as furosemide, increases glucagon response to an arginine pulse in man. In insulin-dependent diabetics, who present an exaggerated glucagon response to stimulants, ASA fails to alter glucagon response to arginine, but completely blunts the glucagon response to salbutamol, a weak beta-2 receptor agonist. In conclusion, these observations provide evidence in support to a role for PGs, at least PGE, in the contro of glucagon release.", 
    "32": "Oxprenolol (O) or propranolol (P) was randomly added double-blind to the regimen of 260 patients with mild and moderate hypertension who had not responded to hydrochlorothiazide (H) alone. Both beta-adrenergic blocking agents were titrated over a range of 120 to 360 mg per day while H was continued. After 6 months of treatment, reduction of diastolic blood pressure (DBP) to below 90 mm Hg and at least 5 mm Hg less than the initial DBP was achieved in 50% of patients receiving P+H and 27% of patients taking O+H (p less than 0.001). P+H lowered BP an additional 10.5/9.8 mm Hg compared with 6.8/7.0 mm Hg for O+H (p less than 0.02). Reduction in heart rate was less after O+H (average, 8.4/min) than after P+H (average, 12.3/min, p less than 0.01). The number of dropouts, morbid events, and reported side effects between the two regimens was not significantly different except that more patients complained of impotence with P+H than with O+H (p less than 0.05).", 
    "33": "Gap junctions between pancreatic beta-cells were quantitatively assessed in freeze-fracture replicas of isolated rat islets of Langerhans incubated for 90 min with or without the potassium conductance blocker tetraethylammonium (TEA). The results show that TEA increases the median number of particles per beta-cell gap junction but not the frequency of gap junctions at both nonstimulating and threshold-stimulating concentrations of glucose. TEA increased the relative gap junctional area at both concentrations of glucose. TEA had no effect on insulin release at a basal concentration of glucose but potentiated that release at the threshold glucose level. Thus TEA modifies beta-cell gap junctions independently of its effect on insulin release. However, the junctional changes observed were greater when insulin release was also elevated.", 
    "34": "A case of severe hypertension resistant to multiple drug therapy was controlled with minoxidil, captopril, and propranolol hydrochloride after treatment with these drugs alone or in other combinations had failed. Hyperreninemic hypoaldosteronism with hyperkalemia and acidosis developed after captopril administration was started.", 
    "35": "Sclerosing peritonitis developed in a 56-year-old white man who had been receiving propranolol (320 mg/day) for hypertension and angina pectoris since December 1976. The patient had abdominal pain, loss of weight, pleural effusion, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Laparotomy revealed extensive adhesions which were so remarkable that the organs were fixed. Infectious and neoplastic causes of fibrosing peritoneal inflammation were excluded. To my knowledge the development of sclerosing peritonitis with extensive colonic involvement and colonic hemorrhage has been been described previously with therapy with propranolol.", 
    "36": "It has been shown in experiments on conscious cats that nitroglycerin exerts a cardiostimulatory effect on the myocardium. The positive inotropic effect of nitroglycerin is associated with the two processes, catecholamine release from sympathetic nerve terminals and blockade of phosphodiesterase activity. The positive chronotropic effect arises from the indirect sympathomimetic properties of nitroglycerin. In addition to the effects listed, nitroglycerin reduces the intensity of the cardiac chronotropic reactions induced by isoproterenol and produces a direct inhibitory action on the myocardium. The implication of the nitroglycerin effects in the realization of its antianginal action is discussed.", 
    "37": "The effects of chagasic sera containing an antibody (EVI antibody) on \"non toxic\" and \"toxic\" actions of ouabain on isolated rat atria suspended in different media, were explored. Ouabain failed to evoke any significantly positive contractile effect on atria beating in EVI Positive Human Sera (EVI(+)S), and only produced \"toxic\" actions (arrhythmias, contracture enhanced frequency, reduced inotropism). On the contrary, atria beating in Krebs-Ringer-Bicarbonate (KRB) or in Normal Human Sera (NHS) reacted to added ouabain with a classical dose-dependent positive inotropic effect. The threshold concentration of ouabain required to elicit the onset of \"toxic\" effects was higher in KRB than in EVI(+)S. Decreasing the extracellular Ca2+ concentration or treating the auricles with verapamil, facilitated positive inotropic influence of ouabain and attenuated the \"toxic\" effects observed on atria beating in EVI(+)S. In addition, the combination of (--)-propranolol plus verapamil enhanced the facilitatory influence of verapamil induced on the positive inotropic effect of ouabain and reduced the \"toxic\" influences evoked on atria exposed to EVI(+)S. These findings support the notion that the overall \"toxic\" responses to ouabain on cardiac tissue immersed in an EVI(+)S containing solution may be related to a combined effect of the EVI antibody activating beta-adrenoceptors as well as to a rise in the tissue Ca2+ content.", 
    "38": "Rabbits anesthetized with urethane were used. Labetalol was found to be about 3.7 times less potent than phentolamine in blocking phenylephrine-induced vasopressor response, and about 7.6 times less potent than propranolol in blocking isoproterenol-induced vasodepressor response. Labetalol (0.3, 1.0 and 2.5 mg/kg, i.v.) decreased both intraocular pressure (IOP) and mean arterial blood pressure (BP) significantly, and also decreased IOP/BP ratio. Propranolol (1.0 and 2.5 mg/kg, i.v.) reduced both IOP and BP slightly without affecting the IOP/BP ratio. Phentolamine (1.0 mg/kg, i.v.) reduced both IOP and BP significantly, but it did not alter the IOP/BP ratio. When both propranolol (1.0 mg/kg, i.v.) and phentolamine (1.0 mg/kg, i.v.) were injected at the same time, IOP and BP were reduced with a decrease in IOP/BP ratio. These findings suggest that labetalol is effective in decreasing the IOP, although the mechanism of the drug action cannot be explained simply by alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade.", 
    "39": "125I-iodohydroxybenzylpindolol (IHYP) is a beta-adrenergic antagonist used as a ligand for the characterization of beta-adrenergic receptors in various cell preparations. Since IHYP may be adsorbed to surfaces such as test tubes and pipet tips, it is necessary to measure the actual free concentration of IHYP in the incubation solution. With this modification, the number of beta-adrenergic receptors in human peripheral PMNs can be determined with greater precision.", 
    "40": "1. Myocardial beta-adrenoreceptors, assessed in membrane preparations of left ventricle by 3H-dihydroalprenolol binding, were compared in dogs following thyroxine administration (n = 6), aorto-caval fistula (n = 12), and in normal dogs (n = 7). 2. Left ventricular hypertrophy occurred in response to both aorto-caval fistula and thyroxine treatment. Yield of myocardial membrane between the different groups was not significantly different. 3. Binding site concentration (pmol/mg membrane protein) in dogs with aorto-caval fistulae was similar to that in normal dogs and was not significantly influenced by the presence or absence of cardiac failure, degree of hypertrophy or duration of fistula. 4. Thyroxine-treated dogs had an increased concentration of binding sites (c. 1.8-fold) compared with both fistula and normal groups, while binding affinities were similar in all groups. 5. The data suggest that beta-adrenoreceptor concentrations in myocardium increase as a direct result of thyroid hormone action rather than as a result of secondary haemodynamic changes or ventricular hypertrophy.", 
    "41": "The role of beta-adrenergic receptors in the mediation of the cardiodynamic effects of a shock-avoidance task was evaluated in conscious dogs with the cardioselective beta-adrenergic antagonist practolol. The animals were chronically instrumented for the measurement of peak rate of change of left ventricular pressure (LV dP/dt), heart rate (HR), cardiac output (CO), systolic (SPB) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure and total peripheral resistance (TPR), and were each subjected to brief bouts of shock-avoidance with and without practolol pretreatment (2-4 mg/kg). Shock-avoidance evoked reliable increases of LV dP/dt, HR, CO, SBP and DBP, and decreases of TPR. Beta-adrenergic blockade virtually eliminated LV dP/dt increases, attenuated HR and CO increase as well as the vasodilatation, diminished SBP increases in certain animals but did not affect DBP increases. Stable interindividual differences in the magnitude of LV dP/dt and HR increases during shock-avoidance were demonstrated; these differences were abolished by beta blockade. These findings indicate that a beta-adrenergic mechanism accounted for most of the rise of LV dP/dt during avoidance but contributed proportionally less to the elevations of HR and CO. Inter-individual differences in myocardial reactivity were however completely ascribable to beta-adrenergic factors.", 
    "42": "A high-affinity pindolol derivative, (+/-)-1-(indol-4-yloxy)-3-[1-(p-azido-m-iodophenyl)-2-isobutylamine]-2-propanol (IABP), has been prepared; it contains an iodide and an azide functional group and acts as a photoaffinity label for the beta-adrenergic receptor. When [125I]IABP (specific activity 1300 Ci/mmol) was photolyzed with crude duck erythrocyte membrane preparations, which contain beta-adrenergic receptor binding sites highly specific labeling of two polypeptides was observed upon electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gels. These two polypeptides, A (Mr approximately 45,000) and B (Mr approximately 48,500), and B (Mr approximately 48,500), were photolabeled in a ratio of approximately 4:1 A/B. Binding of [125I]IABP and covalent derivatization of the beta receptor was at least 70% specific. The data indicate that [125I]IABP is a very effective compound for identification of polypeptides containing the beta-receptor binding site even in crude membrane preparations. The beta receptor of the duck erythrocyte plasma membrane may be composed of more than one subunit.", 
    "43": "The release of hyperlipemic hormone from the glandular cells of the corpus cardiacum (CC) of Locusta migratoria is under the synaptic control of axons in nervus corpus cardiacum II (NCC II). The effects of aminergic agonists and antagonists on the release of the hyperlipemic hormone induced by electrical stimulation of NCC II have been examined. CC isolated from reserpine-injected locusts did not release hormone when subjected to electrical stimulation of NCC II but continued to release hormone in response to high-potassium saline. The electrically stimulated release of hormone from isolated CC was abolished by the alpha-adrenergic blocking agent, phenoxybenzamine, but potentiated by the beta-adrenergic blocking agent, propranolol. Phenoxybenzamine did not interfere with release induced by high-potassium saline. It is suggested that the postsynaptic receptors on the glandular cells are similar to the alpha-adrenergic receptors of vertebrates. Octopamine was found to be present in the glandular lobe of the CC at concentrations of 0.62 pmole per gland pair. Reserpine depleted the content to 0.3 pmole per pair. Bathing the CC in 10(-7) M octopamine resulted in the release of hyperlipemic hormone, and this release was blocked by phenoxybenzamine. It is concluded that the neurotransmitter involved in the synapse between axons of NCC II and the cells releasing hyperlipemic hormone is aminergic, possibly octopaminergic. Octopamine may well be a transmitter mediating hormone release in insects.", 
    "44": "This study was carried out to investigate circadian variation of cyclic AMP contents in the rat pineal glands, using the high-energy microwave radiation technique. The pattern of cyclic AMP concentration in the pineal gland showed a distinct circadian variation, with the maximum level at 0200 and the lowest at 1400. The administration of propranolol completely blocked the dark-induced increase in the pineal cyclic AMP level at 0200, and the administration of isoproterenol induced a threefold, rapid increase in the cyclic AMP level at 1400, although it did not change the level at 0200.", 
    "45": "One action of glucocorticoids is to enhance the tropic effect of catecholamines on heart muscle. To test the hypothesis that this action of glucocorticoids is mediated by modulation of beta-adrenergic receptors, we characterized and quantified myocardial beta-adrenergic receptors in adrenalectomized and glucocorticoid-replaced rats. Adrenalectomy was associated with an increase in myocardial beta-adrenergic receptors, as measured by [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding (P less than 0.001). This increase occurred by 6 h, with no difference over time to 7 days. The administration of cortisol (80 mg/kg.day) to adrenalectomized rats prevented the increase in beta-adrenergic receptors (P less than 0.01). The data indicate that glucocorticoids modulate myocardial beta-adrenergic receptors. However, these results do not support the hypothesis that glucocorticoid enhancement of catecholamine action is mediated by these changes, suggesting that glucocorticoids exert this action at a level other than the beta-adrenergic receptor site.", 
    "46": "In the rat, exogenous hyperthyroidism is associated with increased myocardial beta-adrenergic receptors. In man, however, despite the hyperadrenergic manifestations of thyrotoxicosis, lymphocyte beta-adrenergic receptors are unaltered. To test the hypothesis that lymphocytes do not reflect changes in myocardial beta-adrenergic receptors with hyperthyroidism, we characterized and quantified lymphocyte, myocardial, and lung (as another marker tissue) beta-adrenergic receptors in T3-treated rats. In T3-treated rats (500 microgram T3/kg.day for 3 days), myocardial beta-adrenergic receptors, as measured by [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding, increased by 60% over controls. In contrast, lymphocyte and lung beta-adrenergic receptors were unaltered. However, while lymphocyte adenylate cyclase activity was also unaltered with T3 treatment, lung adenylate cyclase activity was increased. Our data demonstrate that in rats, as in humans, hyperthyroidism is not associated with an increase in lymphocyte beta-adrenergic receptors. The differences in lymphocyte and myocardial receptors and lymphocyte and lung adenylate cyclases suggest that the response to T3 is a tissue-specific phenomenon. The data also suggest that despite the lack of increase in lymphocyte beta-adrenergic receptors in human hyperthyroidism, myocardial beta-adrenergic receptors may be increased.", 
    "47": "We investigated the effects of catecholamines and sympathetic nerve stimulation in the feline pulmonary vascular bed under conditions of controlled pulmonary blood flow. Norepinephrine and nerve stimulation caused dose- and stimulus frequency-dependent increases in pulmonary vascular resistance. However, when pulmonary vascular tone was enhanced and alpha receptors blocked, norepinephrine and nerve stimulation caused dose- and frequency-dependent decreases in pulmonary vascular resistance. The decreases in pulmonary vascular resistance were blocked with propranolol and were of greater magnitude than were constrictor responses observed under basal conditions. Vasodilator responses to nerve stimulation were not modified by atropine. Epinephrine and isoproterenol had marked vasodilator activity in the pulmonary vascular bed when pulmonary vascular tone was elevated. When alpha receptors were blocked, isoproterenol and epinephrine had similar vasodilator activity, and when beta receptors were blocked, epinephrine and norepinephrine had marked vasoconstrictor activity. Selective beta-1 receptors antagonists had little effect on vasodilator responses to isoproterenol, whereas responses to this substance were blocked by propranolol. These results suggest that presence of alpha-and beta-2 adrenoreceptors in the feline pulmonary vascular bed and that both types of adrenergic receptors are innervated by the sympathetic nervous system.", 
    "48": "The beta-adrenoceptor-blocking properties of SK&F 92657, D,L-3-[2-(3-t-butylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy)phenyl]-6-hydrazinopyridazine, were studied in both in vivo and in vitro. The pA2 against isoprenaline tachycardia (beta 1 effect) in isolated guinea pig right atria was 7.16 (6.14-7.87). In contrast, histamine-induced tachycardia was unaffected by SK&F 92657. The pA2 against isoprenaline relaxation of guinea pig tracheal muscle (beta 2 effect) was 7.03 (6.28-7.61). In vivo ED50's against isoprenaline tachycardia (beta 1) and vasodilation (beta 2) in anesthetized cats were 5.7 x 10(-8) and 6.2 x 10(-8) mol/kg, i.v., respectively. Increases in heart rate caused either by activation of autonomic reflexes or by stimulation of efferent cardiac sympathetic nerves were also antagonized by SK&F 92657. The beta-adrenoceptor blockade caused by SK&F 92657 was shown to be competitive both in vivo an vitro and to be equally effective on beta 1- and beta 2-receptor populations. SK&F 92657 was a weak partial agonist in vivo and had only minimal local anesthetic activity. The compound had no direct effect on the functioning of the autonomic nervous system, apart from beta-blockade, but reflexes maintaining homeostasis were reduced because (1) SK&F 92657 is a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist preventing reflex increases in heart rate and cardiac output, and (2) it is a potent vasodilator counteracting reflex vasoconstriction. Postural reflexes were unaffected because SK&F 92657 selectively dilates arterial blood vessels.", 
    "49": "The properties of a new antihypertensive agent, SK&F 92657, D,L-3-[2-(3-t-butylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy)phenyl]-6-hydrazinopyridazine, have been studied. The compound, given intravenously, subcutaneously, or orally, caused a sustained fall in systemic blood pressure of conscious genetically hypertensive rats, normotensive cats, and renal hypertensive dogs. The fall in blood pressure of genetically hypertensive rats was maintained during 52 days of chronic dosing with no development of tolerance. The hemodynamic effects and mechanism of action of SK&F 92657 were investigated in anesthetized cats and dogs using a variety of techniques. Blood pressure was lowered by a direct vasodilator effect on precapillary blood vessels (arteries, arterioles), particularly in the renal, coronary, and skeletal muscle vasculatures, giving an overall decrease in total peripheral resistance with no significant change in cardiac output. In contrast, SK&F 92657 had no significant effect on capacitance blood vessel (veins, venules) tone or on vascular reactivity to vasoconstrictors and consequently did not cause postural hypotension. The beta-adrenoceptor-blocking actions of the drug prevented reflex increases in heart rate and cardiac output, except in the conscious dog, where vagal control of heart rate was predominant. It was also concluded that SK&F 92657 was not acting by alpha-adrenoceptor blockade, ganglion blockade, or inhibition of angiotensin II responses. A \"central\" action was unlikely, as SK&F 92657 caused vasodilatation in denervated autoperfused vascular beds.", 
    "50": "The effect of combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade with phenoxybenzamine and propranolol, respectively, on changes in left ventricular myocardial oxygen consumption and blood flow during nicotine administrations (36 micrograms/kg/min, i.v.) was evaluated in anesthetized, open-chest dogs. Myocardial blood flow was estimated by injection of 8 to 10 micrometers diameter radioactive microspheres into the left atrium, and myocardial oxygen consumption was computed from the Fick principle. Before adrenergic blockade, nicotine caused a market (+151%) elevation in myocardial oxygen consumption and a parallel increase in myocardial blood flow. The increase in myocardial blood flow was uniform transmurally. These cardiac changes were accompanied by elevations in systemic arterial and left atrial pressures, peripheral vascular resistance, and heart rate, but by no change in aortic flow or in myocardial contractility. After adrenergic blockade, nicotine caused somewhat lesser, though still marked, elevations in myocardial oxygen consumption (+60%) and blood flow (+43%). Again, myocardial blood flow increases were uniform transmurally. Also, nicotine-induced increases in systemic arterial and left atrial pressure and in peripheral vascular resistance persisted after adrenergic blockade, whereas heart rate remained constant and aortic flow and myocardial contractility declined. The results indicate that nonadrenergic mechanisms contribute significantly to the increase in myocardial oxygen demand during nicotine infusion.", 
    "51": "Medroxalol is a new antihypertensive agent that is presently undergoing clinical trial. Its cardiovascular properties were studied using spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), anesthetized dogs, and isolated tissues. Medroxalol produced a long-lasting fall in blood pressure when given by the oral route to SHR. It was more potent than phentolamine in antihypertensive effectiveness. Given intravenously to dogs, medroxalol reduced the blood pressure and heart rate of doses that did not greatly reduce cardiac output. The hypotensive effect of medroxalol was reduced but not abolished following alpha- and beta-adrenergic-receptor blockade. Medroxalol inhibited heart rate and blood pressure responses to isoproterenol and phenylephrine in dogs. In vitro medroxalol resembled a competitive antagonist at alpha-adrenergic receptors in rabbit aortic strips (pA2 6.09) and beta-adrenergic receptors in guinea pig atria (pA2 7.73). It was 0.02 as potent as phentolamine at alpha-receptors and 0.09 as potent as propranolol at beta-receptors. It was concluded that the principal action of medroxalol was to produce a fall in blood pressure by decreasing peripheral vascular resistance more than cardiac output. Adrenergic alpha- and beta-receptor blockade alone does more than cardiac output. Adrenergic alpha- and beta-receptor blockade alone does not satisfactorily explain the hypotension. A contribution by an active vasodilatory component appears likely.", 
    "52": "A randomized, double-blind, crossover trial was carried out in 17 hypertensive patients to evaluate the hypotensive efficacy and safety of verapamil. Verapamil in doses of 120 mg thrice daily was compared with pindolol in doses of 7.5 mg twice daily. A thiazide diuretic was given with both drugs. Blood pressure fell about 14/11 mm Hg during treatment with either drug compared to the placebo period, and neither drug caused significant side effects. Verapamil did not affect plasma renin concentration.", 
    "53": "Sympathetic nerve stimulation caused biphasic secretory potentials in cat submaxillary gland cells. The initial phase was a transient hyperpolarization. It was seldom seen after single shocks but nearly always occurred at high stimulation frequencies (10-20 Hz). It was imitated by phenylephrine and completely eliminated by dihydroergotamine or phentolamine and thus considered to be mediated via alpha-adrenoceptors. The late phase, a depolarization, was seen even at low stimulation frequencies and could often be evoked by single shocks. Both alpha- and beta-block reduced this response. Parasympathetic nerve stimulation evoked transient hyperpolarizations. The secretory potentials mediated via all the three receptors classes were paralleled by decreased input resistances across the acinar cell membranes.", 
    "54": "Analogues of medroxalol (1) were prepared in which the carboxamide function, the phenolic hydroxy group, and the aralkylamine side chain were modified. N-alkyl-substituted amide analogues of 1 showed diminishing beta-blocking activity with increasing steric bulk of the alkyl group. This allowed the conclusion that deactivation of the phenolic hydroxy group of 1 by the carbonyl group of the amide function is responsible for the beta-adrenergic antagonistic properties of 1. This conclusion was strengthened by the finding that the phenolic O-methyl analogue 5-[2-[[3-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-1-methylpropyl]amino]-1hydroxyethyl]-2-methoxybenzamide (13) was found to have enhanced beta-adrenergic blocking activity. The finding that 13 also had decreased alpha-blocking activity compared to 1 indicated that the phenolic hydroxy group of 1 enhances alpha-adrenergic antagonism. The finding that 1 and 13 showed such a large difference in relative alpha- to beta-blocking potency while exhibiting approximately equal antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats was surprising. In indicated that pharmacologic properties other than alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade may contribute to the antihypertensive activity of medroxalol. One of the analogues in which the aralkylamine side chain of 1 was replaced by a fragment of a known alpha-adrenergic receptor blocker, 2-hydroxy-5-[1-hydroxy-2-[4-(2-methylphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]benzamide (22), showed an interesting pharmacologic profile of potential therapeutic usefulness.", 
    "55": "Propranolol (Inderal; 1) is extensively metabolized in man. Metabolites of interest pharmacologically include ring-hydroxylated propranolols (1a-g). In order to identify these ring-oxidized products and to study the effect of hydroxyl position on biological activity, we have synthesized all seven isomers. With the exception of 1b and 1g, the desired compounds were prepared by alkylation of the respective methoxy-1-naphthols with epichlorohydrin and reaction of the resulting epoxide with isopropylamine. Cleavage og the methyl group in fused pyridine hydrochloride afforded 1a,c-f. 1g was prepared by the direct alkylation of 1,8-naphthalenediol (17) with epichlorohydrin, followed by reaction with isopropylamine. 1b was synthesized by treating 2-naphthol (9) with chlorine gas and then treating the resulting 1,1-dichloronaphthalen-2(1H)-one (10) with sodium allyl oxide. Acetylation of the hydroxy function and epoxidatrion of the allyl group, followed by relation with isopropylamine, gave 3'-hydroxy-4'-chloropropranolol (15). Dechlorination gave 1b. All of the racemic hydroxylated propranolols produced beta blockade and direct vasodilation in anesthetized dogs. The potency is strongly dependent upon the position of the hydroxyl group, i.e., 1e is 4 times as potent as 1 as a beta receptor antagonist, whereas 1a, 1b, and 1g are all significantly less potent than 1. For direct vasodilation, 1a and 1g are equipotent to 1, while 1b-f are much less potent. The potencies of the compounds were also compared with their 1-octanol/pH 7.4 buffer distribution coefficients; the direct vasodilating potency was found to increase with increasing lipophilicity, while the beta-adrenergic antagonist potency decreased.", 
    "56": "1. The effects of somatostatin on insulin secretion in anaesthetized rats subjected to different manipulations of the sympatho-adrenal system have been investigated.2. Somatostatin (0.1 mug/min) inhibited the secretion of insulin in intact rats both in the basal state and after inducing an enhanced insulin release by infusion of the alpha-adrenoceptor-blocker phentolamine.3. Combined surgical splanchnicotomy and adrenalectomy caused an increase in the basal plasma insulin concentration. Somatostatin (0.1 mug/min) inhibited basal insulin release also in these rats. After infusion of phentolamine, however, the dose of somatostatin had to be raised five fold (0.5 mug/min) to achieve a comparable inhibition of insulin release. On the other hand, a similar rate of insulin secretion induced by glucose in intact rats could be inhibited by the lower dose of somatostatin.4. Administration of the beta-adrenoceptor-blocking agent propranolol to splanchnicotomized-adrenalectomized rats lowered basal insulin secretion to the same level as seen in intact rats. In these beta-adrenoceptor-blocked rats somatostatin (0.1 mug/min) inhibited insulin release both in the presence and absence of alpha-adrenoceptor blockade.5. Rats subjected to chemical sympathectomy through pre-treatment with 6-hydroxydopamine together with adrenalectomy displayed plasma insulin concentrations slightly above the normal range, but the values were much lower than in splanchnicotomized-adrenalectomized rats. Infusion of phentolamine to the chemically sympathectomized rats did not further increase insulin secretion, and somatostatin (0.1 mug/min) depressed insulin release both in the absence and presence of alpha-adrenoceptor blockade.6. It is suggested that an inhibitory tone exerted by the splanchnic nerves modulates the basal insulin secretion in the rat. Somatostatin and the sympathoadrenal system show a complex interaction on the insulin cells in that the sensitivity to somatostatin in splanchnicotomized-adrenalectomized rats with intact beta-adrenoceptors is decreased in the presence of the alpha-adrenoceptor-blocker phentolamine. The exact mechanism behind this decreased sensitivity remains unclear.", 
    "57": "A high-pressure liquid chromatographic assay was developed for the analysis of the beta-adrenergic blocking agent nadolol as a bulk material or formulated in a tablet. Other beta-adrenergic blocking drugs such as acebutolol, alprenolol, atenolol, metoprolol, oxprenolol, pindolol, practolol, propranolol, sotalol, and timolol can be chromatographed in this system. An ethylsilane column and a mobile phase consisting of 35% methanol-65% aqueous 0.0005 M hydrochloric acid-0.05 M sodium chloride are used. Detection is either at 254 nm with a variable-wavelength detector. As exemplified by nadolol, the drug content can be quantitated with or without atenolol as an internal standard.", 
    "58": "Melperone (0.5 to 12.5 mg.kg-1) reduced mean aortic blood pressure in pentobarbital anaesthetised dogs to a greater extent after beta1-adrenergic receptor blockade with atenolol than after cholinergic blockade with atropine. Electrophysiological studies demonstrated that increased heart rate and decreased atrioventricular nodal refractoriness after lower doses of melperone (0.5 to 2.5 mg.kg-1), could be prevented by pretreatment with atenolol. The melperone-induced decrease in atrioventricular nodal conduction time was, however, not affected by pretreatment with atenolol or atropine. Intra-atrial and His-Purkinje conduction times and QRS width were not affected by atenolol or atropine plus melperone. Melperone caused a dose-dependent and very pronounced increase in ventricular and, even more, atrial refractoriness after atenolol. The ventricular and atrial refractoriness increased less after pretreatment with atropine. Some of the cardiac electrophysiological effects of melperone thus depend on the degree of beta-adrenergic stimulation. The overall cardiac electrophysiological effects of melperone results from a combination of direct and indirect actions of the drug.", 
    "59": "1 The dopamine agonist, bromocriptine, produced a hypotensive response following oral administration to conscious normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive (SH)-rats. 2 In SH-rats the dose-related falls in blood pressure to bromocriptine, 3 to 30 mg/kg orally or intraperitoneally, were biphasic, an initial fall at 1 h being followed by some recovery at 2 h and a subsequent fall in blood pressure at 4 and 6 h. 3 The dopamine antagonists, metoclopramide, sulpiride, haloperidol and pimozide, had little or no effect on the hypotensive response to bromocriptine, 10 mg/kg orally, in SH-rats. 4 Pretreatment with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine augmented the hypotensive response to bromocriptine, 10 mg/kg orally, in SH-rats. 5 In adrenal demedullated SH-rats, the hypotensive response to bromocriptine, 3 to 30 mg/kg orally, was abolished. 6 In SH-rats the hypotensive response to bromocriptine, 10 mg/kg orally, was prevented by the beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, propranolol and oxprenolol, but was unaffected by (+)-propranolol and by the cardio-selective beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug, atenolol. 7. In SH-rats pretreated with bromocriptine, 10 mg/kg orally, and then anaesthetized, the pressor responses to low doses of intravenous adrenaline were reversed to depressor, indicating that bromocriptine possesses alpha-adrenoceptor blocking activity. 8 The results suggest that hypotensive response to bromocriptine in conscious SH-rats is mediated by adrenaline released from the adrenal medullae which, in the presence of alpha-adrenoceptor blockade, stimulates vascular beta-adrenoceptors producing vasodilatation."
