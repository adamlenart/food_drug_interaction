    "0": "The responsiveness of beta-adrenergic receptors in cerebral microvessels was studied in aged rats by measuring cAMP formation induced by norepinephrine and [125I]iodohydroxybenzylpindolol binding. The density of beta-receptor sites is reduced by aging in the rat cerebral microvessels. These results suggest that the changes in brain circulation during aging may be at least partially due to a reduction of the beta-adrenergic control of cerebral microvessels.", 
    "1": "The relative importance of alpha- and beta-adrenergic pathways and of their respective intracellular mediators, calcium and cAMP, in the stimulation of phosphorylase alpha induced by catecholamines was studied in hepatocytes isolated from mature male and female rats. The fractional efflux of 45Ca was used as an index of intracellular calcium activity. Our results show that, in females: 1) the activation of phosphorylase alpha induced by 10(-8) to 10(-5) M epinephrine correlates with a rise in cellular cAMP as well as with an increase in 45Ca fractional efflux, 2) both alpha- and beta-agonists stimulate phosphorylase, 3) neither alpha- nor beta-antagonists effectively block the rise in phosphorylase caused by epinephrine, and 4) propranolol suppresses the rise in cAMP while phenoxybenzamine blocks the rise in calcium efflux. On the other hand, we found that in the male: 1) phosphorylase alpha activity is exclusively correlated with a rise in fractional calcium efflux, 2) epinephrine (10(-8) to 10(-7) M) does not increase cAMP and it causes a greater rise in calcium efflux than in the female at all concentrations, 3) phenylephrine increases calcium efflux and phosphorylase activity without affecting cAMP, 4) phenoxybenzamine totally blocks epinephrine action, and 5) beta-agonists and beta-antagonists are without effects. We conclude that, in females, epinephrine utilizes both alpha- and beta-adrenergic pathways which activate phosphorylase by calcium or cAMP, respectively, while, in adult male rats, epinephrine increases phosphorylase alpha activity by an alpha-mediated, calcium-dependent and cAMP-independent pathway.", 
    "2": "Beta-blockers are increasingly often used with suicidal intent, but are also sometimes swallowed accidentally by small children. Beta-blockers available in the Federal Republic of Germany differ in their pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. After analysing 49 cases of intoxication, no certain relationship was found between the different substances and specific symptoms. Cardiovascular signs such as sinus bradycardia, arrhythmia, hypotension (30 cases), as well as dizziness and drowziness (17) were the most frequent ones. Loss of consciousness and hallucination (13), as well as seizures (3), also occurred frequently. Hypoglycaemia or symptoms due to it (12) were noted especially in young children. In addition to primary removal of the drug, repeated administration of charcoal and sodium sulphate are recommended with most of the drugs for interrupting the enterohepatic circulation. Administration of atropine for bradycardia and hypotension was usually not effective. Dopamine is recommended; glucagon for definite signs of shock. Haemodialysis is indicated only in exceptional instances and is effective for only a few of the drugs. Forced diuresis should not be practised.", 
    "3": "To identify the role of the myocardial beta-adrenergic pathway in congestive heart failure, we examined beta-adrenergic-receptor density, adenylate cyclase and creatine kinase activities, muscle contraction in vitro, and myocardial contractile protein levels in the left ventricles of failing and normally functioning hearts from cardiac-transplant recipients or prospective donors. Eleven failing left ventricles had a 50 to 56 per cent reduction in beta-receptor density, a 45 per cent reduction in maximal isoproterenol-mediated adenylate cyclase stimulation, and a 54 to 73 per cent reduction in maximal isoproterenol-stimulated muscle contraction, as compared with six normally functioning ventricles (P less than 0.05 for each comparison). In contrast, cytoplasmic creatine kinase activity, adenylate cyclase activities stimulated by fluoride ion and by histamine, histamine-stimulated muscle contraction, and levels of contractile protein were not different in the two groups (P less than 0.05). We conclude that in failing human hearts a decrease in beta-receptor density leads to subsensitivity of the beta-adrenergic pathway and decreased beta-agonist-stimulated muscle contraction. Regulation of beta-adrenergic receptors may be an important variable in cardiac failure.", 
    "4": "We studied the influence of caffeine treatment (50 mg/kg for 3 doses) on catecholamine utilization and adrenergic receptor binding in female rats. Caffeine enhanced the reduction in forebrain norepinephrine levels following alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine without altering the reduction in dopamine levels. Caffeine reduced the apparent number of beta receptors in forebrain as measured by the Bmax for [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding. No changes in alpha1 or alpha2 receptor binding, as measured with [3H]prazosin and [3H]clonidine, respectively, were noted. These data show that caffeine selectively increases the rate of norepinephrine utilization in rat forebrain and that this is associated with a small, but significant, reduction in beta receptor density in this brain area.", 
    "5": "1. Glucagon, epinephrine, norepinephrine, isoproterenol and phenylephrine each increases significantly glucose appearance and glycogen disappearance from hepatocytes of both juvenile and adult fed rabbits. Such increases caused by catecholamines and adrenergic agonists are suppressed significantly by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol but are unchanged by the alpha-antagonist phentolamine. 2. Glucagon, epinephrine, norepinephrine, isoproterenol and phenylephrine each increases significantly glycogen phosphorylase a activity and decreases significantly the pyruvate kinase activity ratio (assayed with 0.8 mM phosphoenolpyruvate +/- 200 microM fructose 1,6-bisphosphate) in hepatocytes from both juvenile and adult rabbits. Changes induced by catecholamines and adrenergic agonists in the activities of both enzymes are significantly diminished by propranolol but unaltered by phentolamine. 3. These observations suggest that regulation of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in rabbits by glucagon and catecholamines is at least partially due to activation of glycogen phosphorylase and inhibition of pyruvate kinase. Contrary to the age-related changes observed in the adrenergic nature of catecholamines' regulation of these two processes in rats, such regulation of both processes by catecholamines is beta-adrenergic in rabbits regardless of age.", 
    "6": "Changes of cyclic AMP levels were used to assess the specificity of the beta-adrenergic receptor in primary cultures of cells prepared from the intermediate lobe of rat pituitary gland. During a 4 min incubation, beta-adrenergic agonists led to a 4 to 6 fold stimulation of cyclic AMP concentration with the following order of potency (Kd values): zinterol (0.75 nM) greater than hydroxybenzylisoproterenol (1.0 nM) greater than (--)-isoproterenol (4.6 nM) greater than soterenol greater than (7.7 nM) greater than (--)-epinephrine (10 nM) greater than OPC 2009 (procaterol, 11 nM) much greater than (--)-norepinephrine (300 nM). The potent antagonists cyanopindolol, (--)-propranolol and hydroxybenzylpindolol reversed the stimulatory effect of (--)-isoproterenol at Kd values of 0.4-0.6 nM. Other beta-adrenergic antagonists had the following order of potency: pindolol = (--)-alprenolol = timolol (0.9-1.0 mM) much greater than metoprolol (100 nM) greater than dichloroisoproterenol (300 nM) greater than butoxamine (1100 nM). The beta 1-selective antagonist practolol had a low potency at 700 nM. The stereoselectivity of the receptor is indicated by the 400 to 70 fold higher potency of the (--)-isomers of isoproterenol, epinephrine and propranolol as compared to their (+)-stereoisomers. The data show that the beta-adrenergic receptor in the intermediate lobe of the rat pituitary gland is mainly of the bet 2-subtype. Study of this pure population of postsynaptic beta-adrenergic receptors where binding could be correlated with other parameters of cellular activity (cyclic AMP formation and alpha-MSH secretion) should yield useful information about the less accessible adrenergic systems of the brain.", 
    "7": "The activation of Ca2+ -dependent K+ channel by propranolol or by ascorbate-phenazine methosulphate stimulates Na+ -dependent transport of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid. This stimulation arises from a membrane hyperpolarization due to the specific increase of membrane K+ conductance. The same treatment does not modify the Na+ -independent uptake of the norbornane amino acid.", 
    "8": "The circadian pattern of LH release observed in ovariectomized estrogen-implanted rats was inhibited by blockade of alpha-adrenergic receptors by phenoxybenzamine; in contrast, blockade of beta-receptors by propranolol was ineffective. Prasozin, an alpha 1-antagonist, was as effective as phenoxybenzamine, whereas yohimbine, an alpha 2-antagonist, was effective only at high doses. Neither phenoxybenzamine nor prazosin were able to modify the LHRH-induced release of LH from superfused pituitaries. These results suggest an involvement of hypothalamic alpha 1-receptors in the control of circadian LH release.", 
    "9": "Electrical stimulation of the superior ovarian nerve of intact anaesthetized dioestrous rats for 30 min reduced ovarian progesterone levels, even when papaverine and propranolol were also given. The administration of phentolamine (an alpha receptor antagonist) before stimulation reversed this effect. The results suggest that a neural control of ovarian steroidogenesis may be either excitatory through the stimulation of beta receptors or inhibitory through the stimulation of alpha receptors.", 
    "10": "The haemodynamic effects of nifedipine, propranolol, and the combined administration of the two drugs were studied in 12 patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. The combined administration of nifedipine and propranolol appeared to be superior to that of nifedipine alone. The spontaneous heart rate was reduced in most cases after nifedipine plus propranolol, and at atrial pacing the following results were obtained: left ventricular peak systolic pressure was reduced from 200 +/- 39 to 157 +/- 30 mmHg; a positive correlation was found between the pre-drug left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and the magnitude of reduction in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure; systolic blood pressure was reduced from 125 +/- 31 to 111 +/- 27 mmHg, and total peripheral resistance was reduced from 1403 +/- 307 to 1160 +/- 209 dyne s-1 cm-5. The combined administration reduced the resting left ventricular outflow gradient from 76 +/- 19 to 45 +/- 26 mmHg, while cardiac index was left unchanged. The effects on mean pulmonary arteriolar resistance and mean pulmonary arteriolar resistance and mean pulmonary capillary venous pressure were in most cases slight and insignificant. The results indicate an improved haemodynamic condition in patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy after the combined administration of nifedipine and propranolol: a treatment that might provide a new and useful alternative to already existing medication.", 
    "11": "The research over 1023 patients examined in a metallurgical firm for prevalence of essential hypertension has proven that 144 subjects were hypertensive (5 secondary and 139 essential hypertension). 51 patients (35.4%) did not know to be hypertensive, 26 (18%) were without therapy and 57 (39.5%) were inadequately treated. 75 subjects with essential hypertension were treated once daily with Atenolol 100 mg. After a six months treatment 85.4% of patients reached a good control of blood pressure (lying diastolic blood pressure less than or equal to 95 mmHg). Atenolol was well tolerated, few collateral effects have been encountered (13.3%) but mainly the treatment did not cause weakness nor diminished the work capability of the subjects which instead had proven to happen with non selective beta-blocking drugs.", 
    "12": "The reported experiments were carried out on 95 male Wistar rats weighing 300 to 360 g kept for 3 weeks in separate cages in a room at an ambient temperature of 15 degrees C. The rats normally fed or fasted for 24 hours were injected at 24-26 degrees C with adrenaline or noradrenaline (400 micrograms/kg s.c.) or injected at 15 degrees C with propranolol (1 mg/kg s.c.). The metabolic rate (MR), respiratory quotient (RQ) and plasma levels of free fatty acids (FFA), glucose (G) and urea (U) were determined. Similarly as in the non-acclimated rats, the determined parameters considered separately were insufficient for estimating the changes in the catabolism of lipids, carbohydrates and proteins, but a simultaneous determination of the RQ and plasma levels of FFA, G or U with MR measurement indicated the degree of lipid, carbohydrate or protein participation in cold-induced thermogenesis.", 
    "13": "The reported experiments were carried out on 147 male Wistar rats weighing 325 to 400 g kept on normal diet or fasted for 24 hours. These rats were treated with adrenaline, noradrenaline or propranolol (400 micrograms/kg subcutaneously) or were exposed to a temperature of 15 degrees C for 2 hours before and after propranolol injection (400 micrograms/kg). The metabolic rate (MR), respiratory quotient (RQ) and the levels of free fatty acids (FFA), glucose (G) and urea (U) in the plasma were determined. The conclusion was drawn that none of the determined indices alone is a good indicator of changes in the catabolism of lipids, carbohydrates or proteins. However, in the light of the results, simultaneous determination of all parameters, MR including, can provide an indirect information on the role of different substrates in cold thermogenesis.", 
    "14": "The effects of intravenous administration of sodium nitroprusside to a donor dog on cardiac pacemaker activity and contractility were investigated in a cross-circulated dog heart preparation; i.e., the isolated atrial muscle was perfused with blood from a pentobarbital anesthetized donor dog. Intravenous administration of nitroprusside (1-10 micrograms/Kg) caused a hypotension with tachycardia, and occasionally with bradycardia. This effect was blocked by atropine injections into the donor dog, but no significant chronotropic and inotropic changes were observed in the isolated atria. Larger doses (over 100 micrograms/Kg) of nitroprusside produced positive chronotropic and inotropic effects in isolated atria, which were inhibited completely by propranolol. Moreover, direct intraarterial injection of nitroprusside (10-1,000 micrograms) had no significant chronotropic and inotropic effects in isolated atria, although acetylcholine (0.01-0.1 micrograms) induced negative chronotropic and inotropic effects. From these results, it is concluded that nitroprusside has no direct cardiac effect and that it causes a release of catecholamines in doses which produce a profound hypotension.", 
    "15": "1. Neurotransmitter-receptors in the membrane of Xenopus oocytes have been studied using electrophysiological techniques. Neurotransmitters and related agents were applied while recording either membrane potential or membrane current. The majority of ovarian oocytes used were at stages IV and V.2. Three types of oocytes were examined: inner ovarian epithelium covered (e.c.) oocytes; epithelium manually removed (e.r.) oocytes; and collagenase treated (c.t.) ooctyes.3. Ovarian oocytes are sensitive to some cholinergic and catecholaminergic agents. Responses to serotonin were seldom observed and when present were much weaker than responses to other agents. No responses were observed to the amino acids: aspartate, glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and glycine; or to octopamine and histamine.4. Acetylcholine (ACh) usually depolarized the membrane, in a dose-dependent manner, with threshold concentrations as low as 10(-9)m. The ACh-potential was due to an increase in Cl permeability and had a reversal potential around - 19 mV. The intracellular Cl ion activity, measured with a Cl-ion sensitive micro-electrode, was about 65 mm and the estimated Cl-ion equilibrium potential, E(Cl), agreed with the reversal potential of the ACh-potential.5. Curare (10(-4)m), tetrodotoxin (10(-6)m), or alpha-bungarotoxin (10(-6) g/ml.) did not block the response to 10(-6)m-ACh; whereas atropine (10(-7)m) blocked it. No response to nicotinic agents (e.g. nicotine, 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium) was observed. These results suggest that the ACh receptors in the oocyte membrane are muscarinic in nature.6. The apparent latency of the ACh potential, examined by ionophoretic application of ACh to e.r. oocytes and c.t. oocytes, ranged from 0.5 sec to over 20 sec. Intracellular injection of ACh was without effect.7. Responses to catecholamines were observed mostly in e.c. oocytes; while in e.r. and c.t. oocytes they were rare and of very small amplitudes.8. The usual response to both dopamine and (-)-epinephrine was a transient hyperpolarization manifested by an initial increase in K-permeability followed by a decrease. The latency of these responses ranged from 10 sec to over 30 sec and their reversal potential was nearly - 100 mV, which coincided with E(K).9. Oocytes responded to the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist, isoproterenol, as well as (-)-epinephrine. Pre-treatment with the beta-adrenergic receptor blocker, propranolol, abolished the response to both (-)-epinephrine and (-)-isoproterenol. The dopamine potential was also reduced considerably. Both the alpha-adrenergic receptor agonist, phenylephrine, and the alpha-adrenergic receptor blocker, phentolamine, were without effect.10. Maturation of the oocytes, induced in vivo by gonadotropin or in vitro by progesterone, led to loss of responsiveness to both cholinergic and catecholaminergic agents.", 
    "16": "It has been shown that a single intravenous injection of obsidan (0.1 mg/kg) to dogs during acute coronary occlusion results in a decrease in the activities of \"a\" phosphorylase, Mg-dependent ATPase, creatine phosphokinase, succinate dehydrogenase and cytochrome-c-oxidase, in a slight lowering of the ATP content accompanied by the increased content of AMP and unchanged concentration of creatine phosphate. Repeated injections of the drug in the same dose raise the activities of the enzymes up to the control level and produce activation of glycogenolysis and succinate dehydrogenase during the reparative period. The drug favours the preservation of \"b\" phosphorylase activity in the infarcted tissue and does not change the content of adenine nucleotides and creatine phosphate upon prolonged application.", 
    "17": "Systemic vascular effects of dopamine, dobutamine, and prenalterol were studied in 45 anesthetized open-chest dogs. Blood flow (Q) and right atrial pressure (Pra) were independently controlled by a right heart bypass. Transient changes in central blood volume after an acute reduction in Pra at a constant Q showed that blood was draining from two vascular compartments with different time constants, one fast and the other slow. Dopamine (2.5-10 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1) was the most active drug with dose-related increases in heart rate 6-19%, arterial pressure (Pa) 3-36%, and venous compliance 2-25%. Small doses of dopamine (2.5 and 5 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1) reduced arterial resistance of the slow time-constant compartment increasing Q distribution to that compartment 21-42%, whereas larger doses increased both arterial resistance and venous compliance in that compartment. Arterial resistance in the fast time-constant compartment increased with all doses of dopamine. Dobutamine (2.5-10 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1) modestly increased heart rate 2-11% and Pa 9-12% without altering Q distribution demonstrating a relatively flat dose response. Dobutamine 2.5-5 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1 increased venous compliance 5-10% while 10 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1 had no effect or decreased compliance of both compartments. Prenalterol 3 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1 increased Pa 9% primarily by increasing arterial resistance in the fast time-constant compartment without altering heart rate or blood flow distribution. Doses of prenalterol 10-100 times greater caused dose-dependent reductions in Pa and vascular compliance. In this animal model of the circulation with a fixed cardiac output, dopamine had the greatest effect on the peripheral vasculature and chronotropy.", 
    "18": "The effect on the mucociliary (m.c.) wave frequency of sympathomimetic agonists and antagonists was studied in the maxillary sinus in anesthetized rabbits. The non-selective beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline (0.005-10 micrograms/kg i.a.) and the selective beta2-adrenoceptor agonist salbutamol (0.01-10 micrograms/kg, i.a.) induced a dose-dependent acceleration of the m.c. wave frequency, whereas the beta1-adrenoceptor agonist prenalterol (1-200 micrograms/kg, i.a.) did not influence the basal m.c. activity. The selective alpha1-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine (0.01-20 micrograms/kg, i.a.) and the selective alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist oxymetazoline (0.001-1 microgram/kg, i.a.) both induced a dose-dependent retardation of the m.c. wave frequency. The non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (2-200 micrograms/kg, i.a., and 1 mg/kg, i.v.) and the non-selective alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine (0.1-1 000 micrograms/kg, i.a.) had no influence on the basal m.c. wave frequency. Propranolol (1-2 mg/kg, i.v.) reduced the effect of isoprenaline and salbutamol (both in the dose range of 0.01-10 micrograms/kg, i.a.) and similarly phentolamine (0.2 and 1 mg/kg, i.a.) reduced the effect of oxymetazoline (0.01-10 microgram/kg, i.a.). It was concluded that during basal conditions in the anesthetized rabbit the m.c. activity functions independently of sympathetic activity and that sympathomimetic agonists acting on beta2-adrenoceptors accelerate the wave frequency, whereas sympathomimetic agonists acting on alpha1 and alpha2-adrenoceptors have a retarding effect, all in a dose-dependent manner.", 
    "19": "Groups of guinea-pigs were vaccinated with equine influenza A-1 virus and helically-cut tracheal strips were subsequently contracted to carbachol (EC50) and relaxed to isoprenaline at 3, 5 and 10 days post-vaccination. Tracheas from another group were contracted to phenylephrine in the presence of propranolol. Compared to controls, responses to isoprenaline in virus-infected tracheas were significantly potentiated at days 3 and 10. Virus infection significantly inhibited tracheal responsiveness to phenylephrine. It appears that enhancement of isoprenaline may be caused by diminished reactivity of the alpha-adrenoceptor system, thus promoting airway dilatation caused by the beta-adrenoceptor agonist.", 
    "20": "The effects of beta-[Tyr9]melanotropin-(9-18) on the extinction of the active avoidance reflex in (dopamine receptor blocker) haloperidol-treated animals, and on the open-field activity in haloperidol and amphetamine-treated rats were studied. It was shown that a systemically given 100 microgram dose of the peptide, which had no action on the ambulation and rearing activity in the open-field test, could still delay the extinction of the active avoidance reflex. Haloperidol treatment was able to partially block the effects of the ICV administered beta-[Tyr9]melanotropin-(9-18) on both the extinction and open-field activity. After intracerebroventricular administration, the effect of the peptide on the open-field test was partially similar to that of amphetamine: it facilitated the ambulation and rearing activity, and (in contrast with amphetamine) was able to facilitate the grooming activity, even in the presence of amphetamine. The results suggest that dopaminergic innervation might play a mediating role in the effect of beta-[Tyr9]melanotropin-(9-18) on the extinction of the active avoidance reflex and open-field activity. The effect on the open-field activity differens in part from that of amphetamine.", 
    "21": "Alpha-methyl-Dopa (10-100 mg/kg, i.v.) produced a dose-dependent mydriasis in cats anaesthetized with pentobarbital (30 mg/kg, i.p.). The onset was gradual, reaching a maximum plateau in 2-2.5 h. Intracerebroventricular administration of 1 or 3 mg of alpha-methyl Dopa (MD) also produced pupillary dilation with a similar time course. These dosages were without effect when given intravenously. Pretreatment with the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine (0.5 mg/kg i.v.), blocked the pupillary response to MD. The alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin (1.0 mg/kg. i.p.), was ineffective. Selective enzymatic blockade with 3-hydroxy-benzyl-hydrazine (NSD-1015; 25 mg/kg, i.p.), a Dopa-decarboxylase enzyme inhibitor, as well as with bis (4-methyl-homopiperazinyl-thiocarbonyl) disulfide (FLA-63; 2.5 mg/kg, i.p.), a dopamine-beta-hydroxylase blocker, prevented the mydriatic effect of MD. These results support the hypothesis that MD produces a clonidine-like, CNS mediated mydriasis in the cat, primarily by action of its metabolite alpha-methyl-noradrenaline acting on alpha 2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "22": "A case report involving low levels of labetalol is presented. Samples of post mortem stomach contents, liver, kidney, urine, and blood were flocculated with aluminium hydroxide before the labetalol was extracted by using Sep-pakTM C18 cartridges. Quantification of the extracts was performed by HPLC with an ultraviolet detector. The significant of relatively low drug levels found in a patient suffering from a respiratory disease is discussed.", 
    "23": "A method for optical purity determination of a range of chiral drug molecules by NMR spectroscopy is reported. This technique involves the use of optically active lanthanide shift reagents and a newly developed base line analysis. Its applicability was demonstrated for a variety of drugs including nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents and some adrenergic agents. It is established that successful application of the method depends on a constant shift reagent to sample molar ratio, constant instrumental conditions for all solutions, and the use of a calibration curve derived from solutions containing the same total concentration of the two enantiomers. For the examples cited, the correlation coefficient is not less than 0.97, and a mathematical treatment is included which supports the basis of the method.", 
    "24": "It is commonly held clinical belief that antihypertensive agents affect sexual performance. The authors survey the English language literature concerning oral antihypertensive agents and critically review studies examining sexual side effects. Surprisingly, few studies support much of the conventional clinical wisdom. Evidence is strong for the pathogenicity of guanethidine upon ejaculatory mechanisms. Contrary to expectation, strong evidence also exists for the ability of propranolol, especially in high doses, to inhibit erectile functioning. Only equivocal support was found for the pathogenicity of methyldopa, reserpine, and clonidine upon sexual functioning. The authors suggest that this may be in part due to underdeveloped methodology for assessing the sexual side effects of hypertensive medications. Suggestions are offered for future studies as well as for the clinical evaluation of sexual dysfunction in the hypertensive patient.", 
    "25": "1 We have given fifteen healthy volunteers single doses of racemic (+/-)-propranolol orally (40 mg) and intravenously (5-10 mg) to find out how large the variation was of the ratio between (-)- and (+)-propranolol plasma levels in relation to that of total levels of propranolol and 4-hydroxypropranolol. 2 Total propranolol (+/-)-levels 2 h after a 40 mg oral dose of (+/-)-propranolol varied from 21 to 580 nmol/l and those of 4-hydroxypropranolol from 0 to 33 nmol/l. Their levels did not correlate. The ratio between (-)- and (+)-propranolol levels varied from 0.99 to 2.04. The plasma half-lives of the two isomers were usually similar. 3 We conclude that in most single doses studies on relationships between plasma concentrations and effects (beta-adrenoceptor blockade) it is not necessary to quantitate (+)- and (-)-propranolol levels separately since total (+/-) plasma propranolol levels varied much more than the ratio between (-)- and (+)-propranolol.", 
    "26": "1 The effects of food on the pharmacokinetics of orally and intravenously administered labetalol were assessed in six healthy volunteers. 2 Food caused a 38% increase in the mean systemic bioavailability of labetalol: from 0.26 +/- 0.03 (mean +/- s.e. mean) to 0.36 +/- 0.05 (P less than 0.05). 3 Food caused 20% increases in the volume of distribution of labetalol: (from 567 +/- 63 to 685 +/- 76) and in plasma clearance (from 1923 +/- 417 to 2344 +/- 566 ml/min. These changes did not reach statistical significance. Food did not alter the plasma half-life of labetalol after oral or intravenous dosing. 4 Food appears to increase labetalol bioavailability by decreasing its first pass metabolism. It is suggested that this change results from transient alteration of hepatic blood flow. The drug should therefore be taken at a standard time in relation to meals to minimise intraindividual variation in bioavailability.", 
    "27": "The authors determined plasma levels of metoprolol, a widely used beta-adrenoceptor blocker, following oral administration of 100 mg to 23 women. 1/2 of this group were taking a combined estrogen-ethinyl estradiol low dose oral contraceptive (OC). Blood samples were taken before and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours post-dosing. The volunteers were supine for 8 hours, then the cannula was removed, the patients were allowed up, and the last 2 samples were obtained by venepuncture. The concentration of metoprolol in plasma was determined by a modification of the Jack and Riess method. The average age of the control group was 20.7 years compared with 20.5 for the pill group. The difference in AUC between the 2 groups was significant at the P=0.05 level (metoprolol control-662; metoprolol OC-1051). No other parameters displayed statistical significance. Metoprolol plasma concentrations were higher in women taking the pill and the difference was significant. The AUC increase with no change in t 1/2 is consistent with an inhibitory effect of the pill on hepatic microsomal oxidase. Hepatic drug elimination is determined mainly by the activity of the drug metabolizing enzymes and hepatic blood flow. Drugs such as metoprolol with a high extraction ratio do not show changes in clearance and 1/2-life if hepatic enzymes are inhibited. Smoking is known to induce drug metabolizing enzymes and this must be considered. The clinical importance of the interaction between beta-adrenoceptor blockers and OCs is probably small since the overlap between the 2 groups is small. These results, however, suggest that beta-adrenoceptor blocker metabolism may be influenced by the effects of other drugs which inhibit microsomal enzyme activity. Presently, there is research underway to examine the effects of OCs on other beta-adrenoceptor blockers.", 
    "28": "Two patients with histories of migraine had ischemic optic neuropathy develop during an episode of migraine. Clinical and radiologic studies excluded other causes of visual loss. Fluorescein angiography confirmed as ischemic process involving the optic dis. In both cases, visual loss was permanent. No further visual disturbance has occurred in either patient during a two-year period of follow-up while taking oral doses of propranolol hydrochloride.", 
    "29": "The baroreflex control of heart rate was investigated on 10 informed human subjects during light halothane anesthesia (0.3-0.5%, inspired concentration). The relationship of systolic pressure (SP) to the succeeding pulse interval (PI) was evaluated on a beat-to-beat basis during the entire course of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) depressor test. The initial slope of SP-PI plot (dPI/dSP) was used as an index of the sensitivity of baroreflex control of heart rate. Following an injection of SNP (4-6 micrograms/kg), dPI/dt was related directly to dPI/dSP, whereas the latter was inversely correlated with dSP/dt. The recovery of PI lagged behind that of SP, and there was a hysteresislike loop on the SP-PI plot. The time lag of PI recovery and the loop of SP-PI plot were markedly decreased by propranolol treatment and significantly increased by atropine. The slopes of SP-PI plot were significantly decreased by atropine but relatively unaffected by propranolol. These results indicate that SNP-induced hypotension in man during halothane anesthesia is associated with a withdrawal of parasympathetic inhibition and an enhancement of sympathetic activity. The autonomic control of heart rate in response to rapid changes in arterial pressure induced by SNP is dominated by parasympathetic influence; the more persistent sympathetic activity only becomes evident when the parasympathetic influence subsides quickly as the arterial pressure stays relatively constant at a new level. The slope of SP-PI plot (dPI/dSP) and the ratio of dPI/dt to dSP/dt during the decreasing pressure phase of SNP test can be used as indices for the sensitivity of baroreflex control of heart rate.", 
    "30": "Four hours after acute ingestion of 400 to 1,200 mg of propranolol by a healthy, 3-year-old boy, his plasma concentration of propranolol was 2,289 ng/ml. The only pharmacologic effect observed was a diminished heart rate response to crying and activity. In a second case, a 4-year-old boy on chronic propranolol therapy for renovascular hypertension had a hypoglycemic seizure when solid food was refused for three days because of an oral wound. The hypoglycemia was easily managed with intravenous glucose, and there were no sequelae. The first case alludes to the safety of propranolol in a healthy child even with very high plasma concentrations. The second case suggests the necessity of anticipating and avoiding hypoglycemia that can develop in children on chronic propranolol therapy when caloric intake is impaired.", 
    "31": "When added to incubations in vitro. (+/-)-propranolol, a cationic amphiphilic drug, causes profound alterations in incorporation of [32P] orthosphosphate into rat cerebral cortex phospholipids. These include increases in the labeling of phosphatidic acid and polyphosphoinositides abd a decrease in the labeling of phosphatidylcholine. Similar changes occurred in a dose-dependent manner in incubations of cerebral cortex mince, prepared from animals injected i.p. 30 min before death with doses of propranolol ranging from 7.5 to 45 mg/kg. All changes in total incorporation and in labeling pattern had disappeared 3 hr after injection, indicating the reversibility of the effect. Repeated injections of low doses of propranolol (7.5 mg/kg) brought about significant changes in the labeling of brain cortex mince phospholipids, and especially a reduction in total incorporation. Addition of propranolol to kidney and liver minces caused reductions in the labeling of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine and selective increases in the labeling of acidic lipids, restricted to phosphatidic acid in liver and phosphatidylinositol in kidney. After injection of 45 mg of propranolol per kg, but not at 15 mg/kg, some alterations in the labeling pattern were observed in liver and kidney minces. The differential response of tissues to propranolol injections can be explained on the basis of the pharmacokinetics of drug distribution and clearance and metabolic capacities of the tissues. Changes in phospholipid metabolism may be in part responsible for deleterious side effects that can occur during therapy with high doses of propranolol.", 
    "32": "1. To compare the bioavailability and the elimination of propranolol in seven untreated coeliac patients and six normal subjects, plasma concentrations were measured after oral and intravenous propranolol. The bioavailability and clearance of propranolol were similar in both groups. 2. With the use of a perfusion technique, propranolol absorption in the proximal jejunum was found to be decreased by 71% in five untreated coeliac patients, compared with the absorption in four normal subjects. 3. There results indicate that propranolol absorption is decreased in the proximal jejunum in untreated coeliac disease but overall absorption in the small bowel is not impaired.", 
    "33": "1. The effects of propranolol on heart rate, arterial pressure, portal venous pressure and fractional hepatic blood flow were studied in rats with hepatic artery ligature or with portal vein stenosis, and in sham-operated rats. The effect of propranolol on cardiac output was also studied in normal rats. 2. In rats with hepatic artery ligature or with portal vein stenosis, and in sham-operated rats, propranolol decreased heart rate and portal venous pressure significantly and did not alter arterial pressure. Propranolol decreased fractional hepatic blood flow significantly in rats with hepatic artery ligature, but did not change hepatic blood flow in rats with portal vein stenosis or in sham-operated rats. 3. We conclude therefore that: (a) propranolol decreases portal venous pressure in rats; (b) this decrease in portal venous pressure results in a reduction in portal blood flow which is related, in part, to a reduction in cardiac output; (c) propranolol does not alter hepatic blood flow in normal rats or in rats with portal hypertension.", 
    "34": "Immersion of the hand into ice water (cold-pressor test) in nine hypertensive subjects induced elevation of mean blood pressure, increase of vascular resistance in the extremities, decrease of blood flow in the extremities, and increase in heart rate. The preejection phase of systole was not altered. Indoramin and propranolol, each alone and together, attenuated the pressor and other cardiovascular responses. Submaximal exercise increased heart rate during placebo treatment, a response only partially attenuated by indoramin, propranolol, and their combination, but it did not induce changes in mean blood pressure during any of the treatments.", 
    "35": "Pranolium chloride (dimethylpropranolol chloride) is a nonbeta blocking quaternary ammonium that has structural similarities to propranolol and bretylium that exert antiarrhythmic effects in animals. In initial studies, eight patients with chronic ventricular arrhythmias were given gradually increasing intravenous doses of pranolium (up to 3 mg/kg) obtaining plasma concentrations up to 7 micrograms/ml without change in pulse, blood pressure, or arrhythmia frequency. We therefore evaluated the response to pranolium in seven similar patients at doses up to 10 mg/kg as an infusion of 100 microgram/kg/min over 40 to 100 min. At plasma concentrations of 4.7 to 12.2 micrograms/ml, there was suppressing of ventricular ectopic depolarization (greater than 90%) in three subjects and in two others there was partial suppression (49% and 82%). Arrhythmia frequency was unchanged in two. At plasma concentrations of 4.1 to 17.2 micrograms/ml four subjects developed nausea (two of these also vomited) and to experienced perioral numbness. There was no change in sinus heart rate, supine or standing blood pressure, venous reflex response (adrenergic reflex venoconstriction), or ECG intervals in any subject. Pranolium appeared to have antiarrhythmic efficacy in five of seven subjects, without evidence of beta-adrenergic blockade or interference with sympathetic neuron function known to occur with its congeners, propranolol and bretylium. There is a narrow margin between pranolium efficacy and toxicity. It may, however, be a prototype for antiarrhythmic drugs that do not exert undesirable effects on the adrenergic nervous system.", 
    "36": "The effect of oral sotalol on the heart rate-corrected AT interval (QTc) was studied in 33 hypertensive patients. Sotalol given once daily in doses of 160 to 640 mg prolonged in QTc interval in a concentration-dependent manner by up to 150 msec (P less than 0.001) over presotalol levels. The prolongation did not correlate with the initial length of the QTc interval. In seven patients with sotalol-prolonged QTc interval, the withdrawal of sotalol for 3 days shortened the interval to nearly its original length. The effect of sotalol of PQ and QRS times was minimal. Sotalol seems to differ from other beta antagonists in having clear amiodarone-like effects on the action potential of the heart after short- and long-term administration. The measuring of the QTc interval is recommended if high school concentrations are expected, since the risk of cardiac arrhythmias may increase.", 
    "37": "In a double-blind cross-over trial we compared the effects of placebo and propranolol on iv tolbutamide and oral glipizide-stimulated insulin secretion in 10 non-insulin dependent diabetics. The patients were randomly allocated for 2 weeks treatment with placebo and propranolol 80 mg twice daily. At the end of each period an iv tolbutamide test and an oral glipizide-glucose-test were performed. Tolbutamide-stimulated insulin secretion was not affected by propranolol. There was no change in blood glucose levels during the iv tolbutamide test (IVTT), which excluded an effect of blood glucose on insulin secretion. During the oral glipizide-glucose challenge propranolol decreased blood glucose at 60 min (P less than 0.01) and increased C-peptide at 0 min (P less than 0.01) and 30 min (P less than 0.05) compared with placebo. In contrast to earlier results obtained in animals and healthy subjects propranolol does not inhibit insulin- or C-peptide responses to sulphonylurea in patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.", 
    "38": "Previous neuroanatomical and physiological studies have indicated that nucleus ambiguus (Amb) is one source of vagal motoneurons in the brain stem that innervates the pancreas and which, when stimulated, increases insulin release. To investigate one of the neurotransmitter inputs to Amb neurons and its relation to insulin secretion, bicuculline, a specific gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) antagonist, was infused bilaterally into the Amb region as well as into a neighboring area, the rostral level of the lateral nucleus tractus solitarius (nts) of anesthetized male rats. Experiments were carried out in the presence or absence of the alpha-adrenergic blocker phentolamine. In the absence of phentolamine, no increases in plasma insulin levels were seen after bicuculline or vehicle infusion into the Amb region or after bicuculline infusion into the nts, while plasma glucose levels were significantly increased. In the presence of phentolamine, bicuculline infusion into the Amb region led to a prompt and significant increase in plasma insulin levels that could not be accounted for by changes in glycemia. The infusion of vehicle into Amb or of bicuculline into nts produced small or insignificant increases in plasma insulin levels. These results suggest that Amb neurons capable of modulating plasma insulin levels are under tonic GABA inhibition, an effect that appears to be specific for Amb neurons, since bicuculline infusion into another brain stem nucleus (nts) had no effect on insulin release. The fact that phentolamine pretreatment was necessary to reveal the bicuculline-induced effects corroborates previous studies showing that in addition to a central nervous system inhibition of vagal motoneurons by GABA, there is a tonic sympathetic inhibitory input to the endocrine pancreas capable of masking any disinhibition of vagal motoneurons. The physiological role of GABA inhibition of Amb neurons that innervate the pancreatic beta-cells remains to be determined.", 
    "39": "Acebutolol, a relatively cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocking drug, was administered to 20 men with coronary artery disease and angina. A three month double-blind cross-over (placebo and acebutolol) design was used following a 12-week placebo phase and a six-week dose-titration phase. During the cross-over phase, acebutolol (400 mg in 19 men and 300 mg in one, orally three times per day) increased the duration of treadmill exercise (placebo, 6.8 +/- 0.5) min [average +/- SEM]; acebutolol, 8.1 +/- 0.6 min; P less than 0.05) and decreased the frequency of ST segment depression during exercise (placebo, 12 or 20 men; acebutolol, 6 of 20 men). The heart rate x systolic blood pressure product (x 10(-2)) was decreased both at rest (placebo, 105.0 +/- 4.0; acebutolol, 84.0 +/- 3.0; P less than 0.01) and during exercise (placebo, 199.0 +/- 10.0; acebutolol, 144.0 +/- 8.0; P less than 0.01). Acebutolol treatment decreased the frequency of angina (diary cards) (placebo, 9.0 +/- 2.4 episodes per week; acebutolol, 6.4 +/- 2.2 episodes per week; P less than 0.05) and decreased the consumption of nitroglycerin (placebo, 9.0 +/- 4.4 tablets per week; acebutolol, 7.4 +/- 4.0 tablets per week; P less than 0.05). Results suggest that acebutolol increases exercise performance and decreases the occurrence of angina in men with coronary disease.", 
    "40": "To study the possible role of catecholamines in platelet activation, platelet aggregation stimulated by ADP, collagen, arachidonic acid and L-epinephrine, thromboxane B2 (TXB2) formation and plasma levels of catecholamines and renin were studied in healthy men both before and after 6 days of propranolol treatment (40 mg three times daily) under control conditions and during sympathoadrenergic stimulation by physical exercise (200 W) or smoking. Exercise markedly increased plasma norepinephrine from 128 +/- 28 to 998 +/- 418 pg/ml (+/- SD), and plasma renin activity from 1.0 +/- 0.5 to 4.2 +/- 1.8 ng AI/ml . hour. Smoking predominantly increased plasma epinephrine, from 47 +/- 25 to 154 +/- 76 pg/ml. Propranolol did not consistently influence these variables, but blunted the circulatory response to exercise and smoking. Despite the marked increases of plasma catecholamines after both stimuli with and without beta blockade, platelet aggregation stimulated by ADP, 1-epinephrine, collagen and arachidonic acid and associated TXB2 formation were not enhanced. Moreover, as already suggested by a trend toward reduced aggregability in these settings, plasma norepinephrine levels in the same range (745 +/- 368 pg/ml) due to infusion (5 micrograms/min) significantly reduced platelet aggregation with low-dose collagen (0.25-0.75 micrograms/ml), I-epinephrine (0.2-1.0 microM) and ADP (0.5-1.5 microM). These data do not support a role of endogenous catecholamines in initiating platelet activation and TXB2 formation.", 
    "41": "Forty-one patients with hepatic cirrhosis of alcoholic etiology and esophageal varices were subjected to endoscopic sclerotherapy. Four patients were treated during the intervals between hemorrhages; thirty after their first hemorrhage and 7 prophylactically. Propranolol was administered to 5 patients, in doses of 60-80 mg daily. The survival rate for a period of 5 to 16 months was 83%. No complications attributable to the procedure were observed.", 
    "42": "Patients presented here include apparently healthy persons who had diagnostic evidence of chronic cardiac Chagas' disease in the form of a positive complement-fixation test and an abnormal electrocardiogram. They had never been in heart failure. All were examined for autonomic cardiac function. Normal persons served as controls. Patients with Chagas' disease with sole involvement of hollow viscera were also included. In patients with cardiac Chagas' disease, failure of the heart rate to increase after administration of atropine and greatly reduced reflex changes in cardiac rate are believed to be a functional disorder related to degeneration of the neuronal supply to the sinoatrial region of the heart. It is concluded that Chagas' disease is a model of spontaneous denervation of the heart which may be used for the assessment of autonomic control of cardiac function in man.", 
    "43": "The cardiovascular effects of lysine acetylsalicylate and/or propranolol were studied in 26 dogs. All animals were maintained under anaesthesia with halothane 0.75 per cent, supplemented by the intravenous administration of succinylcholine to allow controlled ventilation during a two hour period of monitoring. Cardiac output, stroke volume, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, pulse pressure, central venous pressure, total peripheral resistance, pH, Paco2, pao2 and base deficit were measured in each dog. Lysine acetylsalicylate 50 mg . kg-1, administered alone as a single bolus, significantly (P less than 0.05) increased the cardiac output and stroke volume and significantly decreased the heart rate, central venous pressure and total peripheral resistance in dogs under halothane anaesthesia. Propranolol hydrochloride 0.5 mg . kg-1 as a single intravenous bolus was followed by a significant decrease in cardiac output, heart rate and mean arterial pressure and a significant increase in central venous pressure and total peripheral resistance. The administration of propranolol prior to lysine acetylsalicylate resulted in a significant decrease in cardiac output and heart rate. Pretreatment with propranolol was effective in inhibiting the positive inotropic effect of lysine acetylsalicylate.", 
    "44": "The terminology, pathophysiology, and therapy of acute hypertensive emergencies of pregnancy are reviewed. A hypertensive emergency of pregnancy can be defined to include any of the following: (1) an acute increase in blood pressure to values greater than 160/110 mm Hg, (2) development of symptoms consistent with severe preeclampsia, or (3) symptoms consistent with known complications of uncontrolled blood pressure. A hypertensive emergency requires hospitalization, immediate antihypertensive treatment to reduce maternal blood pressure without substantially decreasing placental perfusion and compromising the fetus, and delivery of the infant as soon as possible. Hydralazine has been shown to decrease blood pressure effectively in hypertensive emergencies of pregnancy. Although many institutions consider hydralazine the antihypertensive agent of choice in pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, there have been no comparative studies to document that hydralazine is the safest or most efficacious agent and only one human study evaluated its effects on maternal blood pressure, fetal heart rate, growth retardation, and uterine activity. Based on available data, minibolus doses or infusion over 20-30 minutes of diazoxide may prove to be safe and effective alternatives to hydralazine, but more data are needed. Nitroprusside may have a role in the short-term treatment of patients unresponsive or intolerant to hydralazine, but human studies are needed before nitroprusside can be recommended routinely. Methyldopa cannot be considered a first-choice agent for the rapid reduction of blood pressure because of its slow onset of action. Further studies are needed before propranolol, i.v. nitroglycerin, captopril, clonidine, minoxidil, naldolol, atenolol, or metoprolol can be recommended. Until further studies are conducted, hydralazine will continue to be the treatment of choice for hypertensive emergencies of pregnancy.", 
    "45": "Counterregulatory secretion of epinephrine occurs during severe insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Under these conditions (minimal plasma glucose 27.4 +/- 1 mg/dl) the decrease of serum potassium concentration (0.9 mVal/L) is mediated by two mechanisms: insulin-induced (0.48 mVal/L) and epinephrine-induced (0.42 mVal/L) cellular uptake of potassium. Epinephrine-induced serum potassium uptake appears to be more sensitive to beta-adrenoceptor blockade than glucose production. The intensification of insulin-induced hypokalemia by epinephrine is of clinical significance.", 
    "46": "Xylazine was administered intravenously (0.16 mg/kg) to sheep. This was associated with a transient hyperglucagonaemia, hypoinsulinaemia and hyperglycaemia. The rate of glucose appearance as determined by isotope dilution techniques was increased three to four fold during the first 20 minutes after xylazine administration. Phentolamine prevented the xylazine-induced increase in the rate of appearance of glucose, and in concentrations of glucose and glucagon in plasma. The insulin response was not altered by phentolamine. Propranolol had no effect on the glucose and hormonal responses due to xylazine. The xylazine-induced effects on glucose metabolism and secretion by glucagon and insulin appear to be mediated by the alpha-adrenoceptors.", 
    "47": "The degree of binding to plasma proteins is an important determinant of drug disposition and response. Normal human pregnancy is associated with concentration of plasma proteins, free fatty acids and possibly other endogenous substances interfering with drug binding. The possibility of an associated change in plasma binding capacity therefore needs to be taken into consideration. Experimental studies conducted mostly in vitro have shown that the plasma protein binding of many (but not all) drugs is decreased during pregnancy, particularly during the last trimester. This phenomenon should be taken into account when interpreting serum concentrations of total (free + protein-bound) drug in clinical practice. Notable examples of drugs whose unbound fraction increases during pregnancy include diazepam, valproic acid, phenytoin, phenobarbitone, salicylic acid, pethidine, lignocaine, dexamethasone, sulphafurazole and propranolol. For many drugs, important differences have been demonstrated in the degree of protein binding between maternal and cord plasma. In some cases, this may provide an explanation for the finding of marked differences in total drug concentration between maternal and fetal plasma at the time of delivery.", 
    "48": "The effect of acute and chronic stress on escape behavior, brain norepinephrine (NE) concentration and beta-receptor binding was examined, and the mechanism of adaptation to chronic stress was discussed in terms of both behavioral and neurochemical standpoint. The rats were divided into an acute stress group (AS), chronic stress group (CS) and control group (C). The rats of AS experienced a single stress session. The rats of CS received 5 separate sessions. The rats of each group were examined by escape test, or killed for the purpose of measurement of beta-receptor binding and NE concentration 30 min after the final shock. The latency of escape test of AS was significantly greater than that of C. On the other hand, the latency of CS, and cortex beta-receptor binding of CS was significantly lower than that of C. However, beta-receptor binding of hypothalamus of AS and CS was not different from that of C. These results indicate that adaptation to chronic stress occurs with respect to escape behavior, and its neurochemical background relates with the acceleration of NE turnover and down regulation of beta-receptor sensitivity of cerebral cortex.", 
    "49": "During hypoglycemia induced by an i.v. insulin infusion for 60 min, rates of plasma glucose (PG) decrease and recovery, PG nadir, and plasma counter-regulatory hormone and free fatty acid responses were studied in eight type I uncomplicated diabetic subjects and eight nondiabetic subjects. Each subject was tested three times at two different rates of insulin infusion (25 and 32 mU/m2/min): (1) during infusion of saline, (2) during infusion of phentolamine + propranolol (combined alpha, beta-blockade), and (3) during infusion of propranolol alone (isolated beta-blockade) for 150 min. At the time of the studies, the diabetic subjects had been made euglycemic by an overnight i.v. insulin infusion. During infusion of insulin (25 mU/m2/min) and saline, the rates of PG decrease and recovery were slower (P less than 0.01) and PG nadir was delayed in the diabetic subjects. Moreover, their plasma glucagon response was blunted while plasma epinephrine, norepinephrine, growth hormone, and cortisol responses were similar in both groups. Infusion of insulin at 32 mU/m2/min caused larger decreases in PG than had been observed when insulin was infused at 25 mU/m2/min. Plasma glucagon responses increased in the nondiabetic subjects (P less than 0.05) but not in the diabetic subjects. However, in the diabetic subjects, plasma epinephrine increased more than in the nondiabetic subjects (P less than 0.05). There was an inverse correlation between the individual plasma epinephrine responses and the plasma glucagon responses in the diabetic subjects (r = -0.72) but not in the nondiabetic subjects. Alpha, beta-adrenergic blockade decreased the plasma glucose nadir and impaired the rate at which normoglycemia was restored in the diabetic subjects (P less than 0.005 vs. saline) but not in the nondiabetic subjects. Plasma catecholamine and growth hormone responses were increased and plasma FFA recovery was suppressed in both groups (P less than 0.05 vs. saline), while the cortisol responses were unaltered. During isolated beta-adrenergic blockade, changes in plasma glucose, counterregulatory hormones and FFA were essentially identical to those observed during combined alpha, beta-adrenergic blockade in both groups except that the augmented plasma norepinephrine responses were no longer apparent.", 
    "50": "although epinephrine is not essential for prompt restoration of normoglycemia in normal man following insulin-induced hypoglycemia, it plays a major role in glucose counterregulation in diabetics who have an impaired glucagon secretion in response to hypoglycemia. These counterregulatory effects of epinephrine are mediated by beta-adrenoreceptors.", 
    "51": "We have examined the influence of isoproterenol and hydrocortisone on the cycle AMP content and lysosomal enzyme release from highly purified human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. It was found that isoproterenol, although a potent stimulus for cAMP accumulation in human lymphocytes, had only marginal effects on both cAMP content of PMN and enzyme release. Since corticosteroids have been reported to increase the response to beta-agonists in various tissues, it was considered that some of the anti-inflammatory potential of corticosteroids might be related to enhancing the response of PMN to beta-agonists. The influence of hydrocortisone on the response to isoproterenol was accordingly examined. It was found that hydrocortisone did in fact augment the isoproterenol-induced increase in cAMP content. In contrast to the potentiation of cAMP accumulation caused by hydrocortisone and isoproterenol together, the two agents produced only an additional inhibition of enzyme release. Since the inhibition of lysosomal enzyme release from human PMN did not closely reflect the changes observed in the cAMP content, a possible compartmentalization of intracellular cAMP is suggested.", 
    "52": "A comparison was made of human postmortem muscarinic-cholinergic, beta-adrenergic and serotonergic (presynaptic) recognition sites in cortical tissues derived from suicide and homicide (control) victims. An elevation of 47% and 35% in the suicide group compared to controls was observed in receptor ligand binding for 3H-quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB, muscarinic antagonist) and 3H-imipramine (IMI, a presynaptic serotonin marker), respectively. In contrast, no appreciable differences in 3H-dihydroalprenolol (DHA, beta-adrenergic antagonist) binding were observed between the two groups. Additionally, tissues from both groups of subjects were analyzed for tricyclic antidepressive agent (TAD) content. High performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) tissue analysis revealed no detectable levels of tricyclic agents with an assay sensitivity of 50 picograms/mg tissue. The results presented herein demonstrate neurotransmitter-receptor alterations in suicide subjects compared to homicide (control) victims. The attendant roles of serotonergic and muscarinic-cholinergic processes in the psychobiology of suicide and depression are addressed.", 
    "53": "The effects of ten, once-daily electroconvulsive shocks on alpha 2 and beta-adrenoceptor binding were investigated in the rat cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus and cerebellum. [3H]Clonidine and [3H]dihydroalprenolol were used as radioligands for alpha 2 and beta-adrenoceptors respectively. Twenty-four hours after the last shock, the density of beta-adrenoceptors was reduced in the cortex and hippocampus, but not in the hypothalamus or cerebellum. There was no change in the apparent affinity of the beta-receptors in any of the regions studied. Alpha 2-adrenoceptor density was reduced in all the regions studied (cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus) with, again, no change in their apparent affinity. It is concluded that the effects of electro-convulsive shock on alpha 2 and beta-adrenoceptors show regional variation; possible reasons for this variation are discussed.", 
    "54": "The binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol to adipocyte membranes may be displaced not only from beta-adrenergic receptors but also nonstereospecifically from other membrane compartments by beta-adrenergic and other adrenergic agents. The EC50 of this nonstereospecific displaceable binding is directly related to the liposolubility (n-octanol:water partition coefficient) of the displacing ligand.", 
    "55": "Glucose-6-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.9) activity in kidney and liver was found to be markedly elevated 3 hr after a single large dose of fluoride (NaF, 35 mg/kg, i.p.). The increases in renal and hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase activity were completely suppressed by adrenalectomy. Moreover, the increments were markedly suppressed by injection of dibenamine as an alpha-adrenergic blocker or by injection of propranolol as a beta-adrenergic blocker.", 
    "56": "In the frog isolated m. sartorius, microelectrode technique and in vivo TV microscopy differentiating bioelectrical phenomena in separate fibers of different groups (dark, light, intermediate), revealed that the drugs altering cAMF exchange (adrenaline, caffeine, imidazole) and used in concentration 10(-5) M, affect to different extents the resting potential and the AP. The effect of the drugs is more obvious in respect to excitatory potential. Mechanism of this phenomenon is discussed.", 
    "57": "We have demonstrated previously a postnatal peak for the beta adrenergic receptor in the heart and detected the appearance of a beta adrenergic receptor before an (-)-isoproterenol inducible increase in heart rate. The present study examined 1) agonist displaceable [3H] dihydroalprenolol (DHA) binding in the neonatal and adult mouse heart and 2) adenylate cyclase in fetal, neonatal and adult mouse heart. 3[H]DHA binding displaceable by (-)-isoproterenol gave a similar Ki from 1 day neonate through adult. Similar to the result found for antagonist displacement binding, there was a dramatic increase in the agonist displaceable [3H] DHA binding postnatally. The maximum was achieved in 2 weeks and then gradually declined to adult level. Cyclase activity (basal, (-)-isoproterenol- and NaF- stimulated) paralleled beta adrenergic receptor increases before birth. However, no early postnatal peak was present. In the 13 day fetal mouse heart, there is no (-)-isoproterenol increase in heart rate, but beta adrenergic receptor (13 +/- 4% of adult) and (-)-isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity (15 +/- 5% of adult) are present. It is concluded that 1) no significant difference exists between the agonist and antagonist displaceable [3H] DHA binding during development, 2) adenylate cyclase activity increases significantly during the last third of pregnancy in parallel with the beta adrenergic receptor, 3) both the beta adrenergic receptor and adenylate cyclase activity can be detected before the heart rate responses and 4) total adenylate cyclase activity does not increase in parallel with the early postnatal beta adrenergic receptor peak.", 
    "58": "The changes in rectal temperature, metabolic rate, cutaneous temperatures and respiratory evaporative heat loss produced by an injection of a bacterial endotoxin piromen (4-40 ng in 1 microliter) into the anterior hypothalamus were assessed in conscious rats in both sexes from a wide range of body mass and at various ambient temperatures (TaS). Intrahypothalamic injection of piromen increased metabolism and decreased cutaneous temperatures which led to fever in rats at Ta 8-30 degrees C. The monophasic fever was not significantly correlated with either body mass, sex difference of the Ta at which the experiments are carried out. Furthermore, daily intrahypothalamic injections of piromen produced no pyrogenic tolerance. Intrahypothalamic injections of either prostaglandin E2, norepinephrine, aminophylline or dibutyryl cyclic AMP also produced increased metabolism and decreased cutaneous temperature which led to fever at Ta 8-30 degrees C. In addition, the fever induced by intrahypothalamic injections of piromen, prostaglandin E2 or nor-epinephrine was greatly antagonized by pretreatment with intrahypothalamic injections of alpha or beta adrenergic antagonist. However, the fever induced by dibutyryl cyclic AMP or aminophylline was not affected by pretreatment with adrenergic receptor blockade. The data indicate that a norepinephrine- cyclic AMP link occurs in the hypothalamic pathways which mediate the piromen-induced or the prostaglandin E2-induced fever in rats.", 
    "59": "The adrenergic control of pituitary beta-endorphin release was investigated by testing the effect of various alpha and beta adrenergic drugs on the secretion beta-endorphin-like immuno-reactivity (beta-END-LI) from primary cell cultures of anterior and neurointermediate lobes as well as into plasma in vivo. Incubation of anterior lobe cells with several adrenergic agonists (10-7-10-5 M) evoked significant release of beta-END-LI with the following potency order; l-epinephrine greater than alpha-methylnorepinephrine greater than guanfacine = methoxamine = l-isoproterenol. The epinephrine- and isoproterenol-induced release from anterior lobes were both inhibited by phenoxybenzamine but not propranolol, suggesting mediation by alpha adrenoceptors. Release of beta-END-LI from cultured neurointermediate lobe cells was also stimulated 3-fold by epinephrine or isoproterenol (10-100 nM) but appeared to do so via a beta adrenergic mechanism because propranolol blocked their effects. Administration of l-epinephrine (100 micrograms/kg s.c.) or l-isoproterenol (200 micrograms/kg s.c.) to rats evoked a 3- to 4-fold increase in plasma beta-END-LI, which peaked 30 min after injection and was dose-dependent up to 500 micrograms/kg, Pretreatment with phenoxybenzamine (5 mg/kg i.p.) 30 min before epinephrine (100 micrograms/kg s.c.) inhibited the drug-induced rise whereas propranolol (2 mg/Kg i.p.) blocked the increase in plasma beta-END-LI after isoproterenol (200 micrograms/kg, s.c.) These results demonstrate that alpha and beta adrenergic stimulation selectively release beta-END-LI from cultured anterior and neurointermediate lobes, respectively. Furthermore, both mechanisms appear to be active in vivo.", 
    "60": "l-Isoproterenol (l-ISO), a specific agonist of beta-adrenergic receptors, evoked a prompt rise of prolactin (PRL) release from superfused anterior pituitary cell aggregates established in culture for 5 days. The effect was concentration-dependent between 1 and 100 nM. d-Isoproterenol was more than 2 orders of magnitude weaker than the l-isomer. When dopamine receptors were blocked with domperidone, PRL secretion was also stimulated by l-epinephrine (E) and l-norepinephrine (NE), the rank order of potency being l-ISO greater than E much greater than NE. Under the latter conditions dopamine and the alpha-adrenergic agonists, clonidine and phenylephrine, had no stimulatory effect at 1 microM. Stimulation of PRL release by l-ISO and E was blocked by the beta-receptor antagonist, propranolol, but not by the alpha-receptor blocker, prazosin.", 
    "61": "The influence of environmental heat stress on the arterial baroreflex control of heart rate (HR) was studied in eight conscious, chronically instrumented baboons. Inflations of balloon occluders around the inferior vena cava (IVC) and thoracic descending aorta (DA) were used to produce acute, graded changes in mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) in 5 mm Hg intervals ranging from +/- 5 to +/- 25 mm Hg. After determination of the HR responses to changes in MABP in the normothermic baboon (blood temperature less than or equal to 37.6 degrees C), the animal was subjected to environmental heating to produce hyperthermia. When blood temperature reached approximately 39.5 degrees C, HR responses to graded DA and IVC occlusions were again determined. During hyperthermia, the HR sensitivity (delta HR/ delta MABP) to MABP changes was markedly diminished for reductions in MABP and significantly enhanced for increases in MABP. To determine whether these alterations in the HR response to changes in MABP were due to an alteration of the baroreflex control of HR, full, sigmoid-shaped HR-MABP curves for both the normothermic and hyperthermic states were constructed and characterized by total HR range, estimated slope of the steep portion of the curve, and MABP at the midpoint of the HR range (BP50). During hyperthermia (1) the whole HR-MABP curve shifted significantly upward by 35-40 beats/min, (2) total HR range, the estimated slope, and BP50 did not change, and (3) the control point (pre-occlusion HR-MABP value) curves were also constructed during either beta-adrenergic blockade or cholinergic (Ch)-receptor blockade in the normothermic and hyperthermic state. Similar to that seen for the unblocked heart, the whole HR-MABP curves were also shifted upward during hyperthermia in this group of baboons with no alteration in the total HR range, the estimated slope, or BP50. The upward shift in the HR-MABP curve during Ch-receptor blockade, unlike during beta-receptor blockade, was much greater than that which could be attributed only to the local effect of blood temperature. Although the control point was also shifted upward along the steep portion of the curve during beta- or Ch-receptor blockade, the upward shift observed during beta-adrenergic blockade was similar to that observed in the unblocked state. Thus, a heat stress-induced hyperthermia produces a rise in HR without significantly altering the characteristics of the reflex control of HR by arterial baroreceptors. To rely solely on changes in HR sensitivity may lead to erroneous conclusions as to the effect of a particular stress on the baroreceptor reflex control of HR. Further, these results indicate that: (1) the upward shift in the HR-MABP curve is mediated by both the local effect of blood temperature on HR and cardiac sympathetic efferent neurons which are independent of the baroreceptor reflex, and (2) the upward shift in the control point is mediated predominantly by vagal withdrawal, probably as part of the compensatory response to a heat-induced hypotension.", 
    "62": "We examined, in conscious dogs, the effects of beta-adrenergic stimulation on measurements of left circumflex coronary arterial diameter and blood flow and on calculations of late diastolic coronary resistance (LDCR) and left circumflex coronary internal cross-sectional area (CSA). Isoproterenol (0.1 microgram/kg) initially decreased mean arterial pressure by 25 +/- 2% (mean +/- SEM), and LDCR by 62 +/- 4%, and increased heart rate by 82 +/- 10%, left ventricular (LV) dP/dt by 79 +/- 12%, and mean coronary blood flow by 85 +/- 5%, while CSA rose slightly. The peak effects on CSA (24 +/- 2%) occurred later, along with decreases in mean arterial pressure (7.4 +/- 1.0%) and LDCR (25 +/-5.3%) and increases in coronary blood flow (14 +/- 2%), LV dP/dt (12 +/- 3%), and heart rate (24 +/- 4%). Pirbuterol (1.0 microgram/kg) induced changes that were qualitatively similar to those induced by isoproterenol. Prenalterol (20 micrograms/kg), a cardioselective beta 1-adrenergic receptor agonist, did not affect mean arterial pressure, but increased heart rate by 40 +/- 5%, LV dP/dt by 72 +/- 10%, mean coronary blood flow by 34 +/- 11%, and CSA by 26 +/- 3%, and decreased LDCR by 29 +/- 5+. Isoproterenol and pirbuterol, but not prenalterol, increased coronary sinus O2 content and decreased A-VO2 difference. After beta 1-adrenergic receptor blockade with atenolol (1 mg/kg), prenalterol no longer induced significant effects, whereas isoproterenol and pirbuterol decreased mean arterial pressure similarly to what was observed prior to blockade, but did not increase LV dP/dt, and induced attenuated increases in mean coronary blood flow, CSA, and decreases in LDCR. Thus, in the intact, conscious animal, large coronary arteries are regulated by beta-adrenergic mechanisms. Surprisingly, a major fraction of large coronary arterial dilation appeared to be either directly or indirectly due to beta 1-adrenergic receptor mechanisms, although beta 2-adrenergic effects were also significant."
