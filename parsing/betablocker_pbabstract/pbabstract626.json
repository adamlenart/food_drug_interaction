    "0": "Alterations of platelet function and blood coagulation may occur with exercise or beta-adrenoceptor blockade. To determine if beta-blockade could modify exercise-induced changes in haemostatic factors we performed a double-blind study of acute strenuous exercise in normal males with and without beta-blockade. Exercise increased prostacyclin and plasminogen activator levels but there was no evidence of thrombin generation as indicated by unchanged platelet aggregation responses, beta-thromboglobulin and fibrinopeptide A levels. The only alteration in coagulation by beta-blockade was a reduction in the factor VIII:C and VIII:RAg rise after exercise and this modification may be relevant to the protective effect of these drugs in patients with coronary artery disease.", 
    "1": "Heart muscle necroses can be produced in rabbits by normobaric hyperoxia. The pathogenesis of these lesions is controversial. In our investigations we found that such necroses can be prevented by beta blockers, but not by a calcium antagonist. This can be explained by the different action of the two drugs on the coronary arteries. The result supports the view that heart muscle necroses after normobaric hyperoxia are a direct toxic effect of oxygen on the heart muscle fibers.", 
    "2": "The incidence of side-effects on administration of chloranolol (Tobanum), a beta-adrenergic receptor blocking drug, to 2066 patients with hypertension, angina pectoris or arrhythmias was measured by three different methods. In 600 patients in an efficacy trial (Group 1) both spontaneously reported complaints and objective signs were tabulated. A side effect - directed method, utilising a questionnaire containing a list of possible side-effects was also used, with the questionnaire being completed by the physician. 35 questions referred to anticipated and other side-effects. The trial was performed in two groups: in 537 patients a placebo was also given (Group 2), and in another set of 929 patients (Group 3) the questionnaire inquiry was performed uncontrolled, without placebo. All three groups were comparable in their distribution of sexes, ages and diagnoses, the mean daily dose of chloranolol its use alone or in combination, and in a similar duration of treatment. 55% of all patients received chloranolol therapy for a period of more than 3 months. The ratio of in- and outpatients was 1:5. The side-effect incidence was independent of the age and sex of the patients and of the dose of chloranolol. The incidence was also unaffected whether chloranolol was used alone or in combination. The number of side-effects differed markedly between the three groups, their ratio was 1:10:24 in Groups 1, 2 and 3. Two-thirds of the side-effects subsided spontaneously within 1 month of their onset.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "3": "Pafenolol, a new selective adrenergic beta 1-blocking agent, has been tested for the first time in 6 hypertensive patients. After single oral doses of pafenolol 25 to 100 mg, there was a marked reduction in heart rate and systolic blood pressure during exercise tests. These effects were dose dependent. A significant positive correlation was found between the reduction in heart rate during exercise and the plasma level of pafenolol 5 hours after drug intake (correlation coefficient r = 0.94). Side effects were mild and seemed to be dose dependent. It is concluded that this new beta 1-blocking agent was effective in reducing blood pressure and was well tolerated.", 
    "4": "Binding of 3H-dihydroalprenolol (3H-DHA) to beta-adrenoceptors in homogenates from rat and rabbit lung was homogeneous and of high affinity (KD = 0.6 and 1.1 nmol/l at 20 degrees C; 1.1 and 2.2 nmol/l at 37 degrees C). The beta 1-selective antagonists betaxolol, metoprolol, bevantolol and acebutolol displaced 3H-DHA in a biphasic manner. From these data, the beta-adrenoceptor subtype distribution in rat lung homogenates was estimated to be 80% beta 2 (at 20 and 37 degrees C) as compared to 25% beta 2 in rabbit lung homogenates. In general, binding of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (selective and nonselective) was slightly (less than 2 X) weaker in rabbit than in rat lung homogenates. In rat lung, binding of cardioselective beta-blockers to beta 1-receptors seemed to be more temperature-sensitive than binding to beta 2-receptors or binding of nonselective beta-blockers. Levobunolol, a potent non-cardioselective beta-blocker in pharmacological experiments, displaced 3H-DHA in a homogeneous manner (indicative of non-selectivity). In rat lung homogenates KD values were 0.8 nmol/l at 20 degrees C and 2.1 nmol/l at 37 degrees C. Similar values were found for the metabolites dihydrolevobunolol and hydroxylevobunolol. Surprisingly, d-bunolol, the dextrarotatory enantiomer of bunolol, showed a biphasic displacement curve, the fraction of high affinity sites being 83% in rat lung homogenates and 23% in rabbit lung. This ratio of sites is expected for a beta 2-adrenoceptor preferring ligand. High affinity binding (i.e. supposedly binding to beta 2-receptors) was about 50 times weaker than binding of levobunolol, in agreement with known stereospecificity of beta-adrenoceptor binding.", 
    "5": "In isolated hepatocytes of rats with advanced phosphate depletion (serum Pi in controls: 8.79 +/- 0.16 mg/dl; Pi depletion: 2.79 +/- 0.18 mg/dl), diminished gluconeogenesis is observed [controls: 247 +/- 21 nmol X (mg protein)-1 X (30 min)-1; Pi depletion: 174 +/- 15]. In vitro stimulation with glucagon (28 nmol/l) caused a significant rise of glucose production, fall in lactate production, and increase in cAMP content in controls, but did not change glucose or lactate production in Pi depletion despite significant stimulation of cAMP content. This defect was not corrected by pretreating Pi-depleted animals with somatostatin. Impaired basal and glucagon-stimulated glucose production by hepatocytes of Pi-depleted animals was not reversed by incubation in a medium with high Pi content. Insulin (17 nmol/l) did not influence glucose or lactate production in hepatocytes of control or Pi-depleted animals. Epinephrine (10(-6) M) caused a significant stimulation of glucose production in control animals which was inhibited both by phenoxybenzamine (10(-4) M) and propranolol (10(-3) M). Epinephrine-mediated increase of glucose production with pyruvate (10 mM) as substrate was reduced but still demonstrable in hepatocytes of phosphate-depleted animals in parallel with a significant rise of hepatocellular cAMP concentration. Various concentrations of bovine PTH1-34 failed to affect cAMP concentration, glucose or lactate production in Pi-depleted animals and glucose or lactate production in controls. Impaired basal and stimulated (glucagon and epinephrine) glucose production despite adequate cellular cAMP generation points to steps distal to adenylate cyclase as the cause of disturbed hepatic gluconeogenesis in phosphate depletion.", 
    "6": "A kinetic analysis of [3H]-5-HT uptake in the photocytes of the photophores of Porichthys notatus revealed a high affinity (Km: 1.71 X 10(-7] and low affinity component (Km: 1.10 X 10(-5) M). The high affinity uptake was sodium- and potassium-dependent but largely insensitive to temperatures between 0 and 20 C. Ouabain (5 X 10(-3) M) and dinitrophenol (10(-3) M) reduced uptake significantly. DMI, imipramine and fluoxetine, in that order of potency, greatly inhibited [3H]-5-HT uptake. Noradrenaline and adrenaline reduced uptake in a non-competitive manner, while dopamine, tryptophan, 5-hydroxytryptophan and Cypridina luciferin had little or not effect on uptake. Non-facilitated luminescent responses to electrical stimulation were accompanied by release of [3H]-5-HT accumulated in the photocytes. Facilitatory luminescence excitation consistently failed to induce the release of [3H]-5-HT. Electrical and adrenaline (10(-5) M) stimulation of photophores after [3H]-5-HT release has occurred, failed to elicit any additional luminescent response. The photophores were responsive to KCN (10(-3) M) under these conditions. The results indicate that a specific carrier-mediated transport system is responsible for photocytic [3H]-5-HT uptake, and that release of photocytic [3H]-5-HT is stringently regulated and followed by inhibition of luminescence excitability.", 
    "7": "Distinct peaks in cAMP and cGMP content during early development, partly opposite to each other, may be correlated with the two main phases of gastrulation and ciliary activity. Monoamines increases cAMP formation. A transient or extended decrease follows, presumably reflecting some feedback mechanism. Muscarinic agents and Ca2+ interfere. The developmental variation in cyclic nucleotides may reflect a temporal shift in the role of various signal substances as well as feedback regulation related to Ca2+ influx. The opposite changes in cAMP and cGMP during early gastrulation may reflect a mutual dependency of the two nucleotide cyclases related to changes in Ca2+ influx.", 
    "8": "A crude membrane fraction was prepared from hamster brown adipose tissue. Extensive washing of the crude membranes was crucial for the appearance of specific beta-adrenergic receptor binding as assessed by (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol. Adrenergic agents competed for the specific binding sites with beta 1-specificity. Binding characteristics were very similar to those earlier found in intact cells, supporting our previous finding that a single (non-tumour) mammalian cell may contain as many as 60,000 beta-adrenergic receptors. Desensitization in situ (i.e. chronic norepinephrine stimulation due to cold acclimation) only marginally affected the number of beta 1-receptors and their affinity (Ki) for norepinephrine. Total (fluoride-stimulated) adenylate cyclase increased somewhat, but the Kact for norepinephrine slightly decreased. Thus the ratio Ki/Kact was rather unaffected by cold acclimation. However, the fraction of adenylate cyclase which could be stimulated by norepinephrine decreased drastically. GTP introduced a low-affinity form (for agonist) of the receptor. The form observed in isolated cells must primarily be the high-affinity form. The basis for desensitization must reside in a diminished ability to transfer the signal from the receptor to the cyclase. This change may be molecularly located in the N-protein or in its interaction with the receptor.", 
    "9": "17 subjects with essential hypertension (14 male, 3 female - ages: 40-69 years), 13 of whom continued their previous anti-hypertensive therapy, completed a double-blind cross-over trial of ketanserin 40 mg twice daily versus placebo tablets twice daily - each treatment phase was six weeks in duration. For the group as a whole, blood pressure (BP) was reduced in the ketanserin phase compared with the placebo phase; supine mean BP decrease: 4 +/- 1 mm Hg (p less than 0.05); standing mean BP decrease: 7 +/- 1 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). Heart rate (HR) was also significantly decreased in the ketanserin phase by 5 +/- 1 beats/minute (p less than 0.001). When individual subgroups were analysed the reductions in BP and HR were greater in subjects already receiving anti-hypertensives, diuretic and/or beta blockers. Changes were observed in 24 hour urine sodium and potassium excretion - sodium (mmol/day): placebo 137 +/- 17, ketanserin 174 +/- 19 (p less than 0.05); potassium (mmol/day): placebo 74 +/- 8, ketanserin 57 +/- 5. For the group as a whole there were no significant adverse effects during the ketanserin phase, although two subjects had a dose reduction of ketanserin because of drowsiness and dizziness. Two additional subjects withdrew from the study due to adverse effects, one in the placebo phase. In conclusion ketanserin in the dose administered has a modest hypotensive effect which is best seen in subjects already receiving other anti-hypertensive agents.", 
    "10": "The importance of the interaction between smoking and propranolol (metabolised in the liver) and atenolol (excreted almost entirely in the urine) was investigated in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Resting and exercise heart rates were significantly greater during smoking than no-smoking phases. Atenolol and propranolol significantly improved ST segment response after exercise whether or not the patients were smoking. Plasma propranolol significantly increased when patients stopped smoking whereas there was no such change in atenolol levels.", 
    "11": "Higher AUC and Cmax values were obtained for metoprolol, oxprenolol and propranolol in groups receiving the low-dose oestrogen-ethinyl oestradiol oral contraceptive, but statistical significance was reached only with metoprolol AUC. The oral contraceptive had the opposite effect on acebutolol AUC and Cmax but this was not significant. The oral contraceptive had no detectable effects on the tmax and t 1/2 values of any of the beta-adrenoceptor blockers.", 
    "12": "All beta-adrenergic receptor blockers that require metabolism prior to elimination are potentially subject to drug interactions due to enzyme induction. However, data is only available in man for propranolol, metoprolol and alprenolol. Cross-sectional population studies suggest that environmental factors, such as smoking in the young, are able to influence the oral clearance of propranolol. Long-term studies comparing within-subject clearances of metoprolol, alprenolol and propranolol before and after rifampicin and pentobarbitone, indicate that oral clearance is increased by 50%-500%. Inducing agents can influence intrinsic clearance, liver blood flow, and protein binding in addition to drug metabolising ability, indicating that changes in pharmacokinetic disposition may be complex. Enzyme induction exhibits both dose and time dependency relationships. The maximal extent of enzyme induction is similar between subjects. The range of intersubject variation in drug metabolism is similar before and after induction. The reduction in steady-state beta-adrenergic receptor drug concentration following enzyme induction is sufficiently large that an altered pharmacodynamic response would be expected if no dosage modification is made.", 
    "13": "The effects of diazepam on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of two lipophilic beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (propranolol and metoprolol) and a hydrophilic beta-adrenoceptor antagonist (atenolol) were compared in 12 subjects. Administration of propranolol and metoprolol produced small increases in the AUC0-8h for diazepam compared with placebo (P less than 0.05 for metoprolol). Atenolol had no significant effect on the AUC0-8h for diazepam. The increase in the AUC0-8h was accompanied by increases in the plasma concentrations of N-desmethyldiazepam. Diazepam had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of either propranolol or atenolol. The pharmacokinetic interaction could be attributed to inhibition of diazepam metabolism by the lipophilic beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. The pharmacodynamic studies showed that when compared with placebo or atenolol there was a significant impairment of kinetic visual acuity (KVA) when diazepam was co-administered with metoprolol. Although there was a significant correlation (P less than 0.02) between plasma concentrations of diazepam and impairment of KVA, the pharmacodynamic interactions may not be due solely to the small pharmacokinetic interaction observed.", 
    "14": "The degrees of interactions between the H2-receptor antagonists, cimetidine and ranitidine, and several beta-adrenoceptor blockers were investigated in healthy volunteers following 7 days of oral monotherapy with penbutolol, propranolol, metoprolol, pindolol and atenolol, and after co-administration with each of the H2-receptor antagonists. The kinetic parameters of unmetabolised penbutolol and penbutolol glucuronide were unaffected, whereas the levels of 4-hydroxypenbutolol and 4-hydroxypenbutolol glucuronide were significantly reduced. Furthermore, cimetidine led to a marked increase in propranolol and metoprolol plasma levels. During co-administration with cimetidine, pindolol plasma levels were only slightly raised, whereas the pharmacokinetics of atenolol were not affected. With regard to pharmacodynamics, the inhibition of exercise-induced tachycardia by each of the beta-adrenoceptor blockers was not affected by cimetidine. Ranitidine did not alter atenolol plasma levels, but did raise the peak plasma concentration of metoprolol by about 30%. It is concluded that cimetidine interactions do occur and can be predicted for substances metabolised by the cytochrome P-450 pathway.", 
    "15": "Treatment of angina pectoris with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists and verapamil in combination is effective and increasingly common. The study reported here was designed to show whether the pharmacokinetics of verapamil are influenced by concurrent treatment with three different beta-adrenoceptor blockers, and whether there is any pharmacodynamic interaction between these drugs. Twelve healthy volunteers (eight men, four women) aged 21-25 years and weighing 48-82 kg consented to participate in the study. They received verapamil 50 mg three times daily for four 1-week periods, each separated by a 1 week 'washout' period. During three of the four treatment periods, the subjects took either atenolol 100 mg once daily, metoprolol 100 mg twice daily or propranolol 80 mg twice daily; in the remaining period they took verapamil alone. The concentration/time curve and plasma elimination half-life of verapamil and norverapamil, its major metabolite, were not influenced by 1 weeks co-administration atenolol, metoprolol or propranolol. As expected, co-administration of each of the beta-adrenoceptor blockers significantly reduced exercise heart rate when compared with verapamil alone.", 
    "16": "There is evidence, from human and animal studies, that drug-metabolising enzymes exist in multiple forms, the individual enzymes having selective, but not specific, substrate requirements. Consequently drug interactions may arise when two drugs bind to the same enzyme. The degree of enzyme inhibition will be partly dependent on the relative affinities of the drugs for the enzyme and on their rates of turnover. The decrease in drug clearance produced by enzyme inhibition is dependent on the fraction of the drug normally metabolised by the inhibited pathway(s). Cimetidine, a P-450 enzyme inhibitor, increases the systemic bioavailability of propranolol and labetalol, which undergo extensive metabolism, but does not affect the clearance of atenolol, which is excreted largely unchanged. In this situation, both the extent and type of biotransformation are important. Thus, cimetidine has no effect on the clearance of penbutolol, even though the drug is eliminated almost entirely by biotransformation. The major metabolite is penbutolol glucuronide, and it has been shown recently that cimetidine does not inhibit glucuronylation. Beta-adrenoceptor blockers also act as enzyme inhibitors themselves. For example, antipyrine clearance is decreased by propranolol and to a lesser extent by metoprolol, whereas atenolol has no effect. It has been suggested, therefore, that there is a relationship between the lipid-solubility of beta-adrenoceptor blockers and their ability to inhibit drug metabolism. The clearance of lipophilic beta-adrenoceptor blockers is dependent on hepatic enzyme activity, and is therefore sensitive to enzyme induction. For drugs with high hepatic clearance and subsequent high presystemic elimination, a moderate increase in the extraction ratio will produce a marked decrease in systemic bioavailability.

    "17": "The influence of chronic therapy with nifedipine on the pharmacokinetics of propranolol 80 mg twice daily, metoprolol 100 mg twice daily and atenolol 100 mg once daily was investigated in eight healthy volunteers. Nifedipine 10 mg three times daily did not affect the pharmacokinetics of metoprolol and atenolol whereas nifedipine shortened the time to peak plasma concentration for propranolol by about 1 h. Propranolol, metoprolol and atenolol provoked comparable decreases in heart rate measured at rest and during exercise. The beta-adrenoceptor blocking properties of propranolol, metoprolol and atenolol were not affected by concomitant therapy with nifedipine. The present study did not show significant pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between nifedipine and lipophilic beta-adrenoceptor blockers.", 
    "18": "In theory, beta-adrenoceptor antagonists could lower the clearance of free lignocaine in three ways (a) by decreasing hepatic blood flow, (b) by competing for plasma binding sites or (c) by inhibiting the enzymes responsible for metabolising lignocaine. The first mechanism has been demonstrated for propranolol and is probably common to all agents lacking intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. The second mechanism is discounted by data showing that propranolol, one of the more highly bound beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, does not alter the free fraction of lignocaine in plasma. In vitro studies support the third mechanism for the more lipid-soluble beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, as does the fact that observed decreases in the clearance of lignocaine in vivo are generally greater than the anticipated maximum lowering of hepatic blood flow.", 
    "19": "Most beta-adrenoceptor blockers undergo extensive oxidative metabolism. The evidence for polymorphism of the debrisoquine type is reviewed. The AUC and half-life of metoprolol were considerably greater in poor metabolisers (PM) of debrisoquine than in extensive metabolisers (EM). Metoprolol alpha-hydroxylation is impaired and O-dealkylation must also be affected. Polymorphism in the former route has been demonstrated in a population of 143 patients to be directly related to debrisoquine phenotype. Bufuralol AUC and half-life are much higher in PM than EM subjects. Hydroxylation at the 1 and 4 positions are affected. Genetic polymorphism for 1-hydroxylation has been shown in family and population studies. Propranolol 4-hydroxylation is defective in PM subjects of debrisoquine but propranolol AUC is not related to phenotype, presumably because other major pathways are unaffected. Oxidation phenotype correlates well with intensity and duration of beta-adrenoceptor blockade after metoprolol, PM subjects requiring only once-daily dosing. However, in EM subjects twice-daily dosing is required even if slow release preparations are used, since plasma metoprolol concentrations may remain negligible 24 h after dosing. The beta-adrenoceptor blocking effects of propranolol and bufuralol are unlikely to be influenced by oxidation status. Anecdotal reports of toxicity arising in PM subjects taking metoprolol or propranolol need to be substantiated. However, vomiting after the administration of bufuralol often occurs in poor metabolisers. Metabolic interactions with drugs sharing the same enzyme system are discussed. Debrisoquine and bufuralol competitively inhibit each other's metabolism in vitro. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "20": "The effect of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists with varying lipophilicity on microsomal phase I and II reactions was investigated using rat hepatic microsomes. The degree of inhibition of ethoxyresorufin deethylase paralleled octanol/water partition coefficients: propranolol greater than alprenolol greater than timolol greater than metoprolol greater than atenolol. Propranolol (highly lipophilic) and atenolol (hydrophilic) also had widely different effects on 7-ethoxycoumarin deethylase inhibition and on disopyramide N-dealkylation. However the inhibition of harmol conjugation was not related in the same way to octanol/water partition coefficient as was the phase I reactions.", 
    "21": "There is a reasonable agreement between defined daily doses (DDDs) and prescribed daily doses (PDDs) of antihypertensive drugs, at least in Norway and Sweden. Sales and prescriptions of antihypertensive drugs in seven European countries (CSSR, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Northern Ireland, Norway and Sweden) have increased 50 to 200% during the last 10 years. The drug statistics also illustrate marked qualitative and quantitative differences in the utilization of antihypertensive drugs between these seven European countries. Mortality in cardiovascular diseases also differs between these countries, particularly between Northern Ireland and Finland and the other countries. So do sales of alcohol and tobacco. However, none of these factors seem to co-vary with drug utilization.", 
    "22": "For a benefit analysis of drug utilization data little reliable information is available. Benefit criteria have to be established for individual classes of drugs as well as for various types of diseases submitted to drug treatment. Antihypertensive therapy is taken as an example of how drug preferences vary from country to country and how prescribing patterns are affected by the appearance of new drugs. In the Federal Republic of Germany, fixed-ratio combinations of reserpine and diuretics are still the leading group of drugs in this field, whereas they have virtually disappeared in Great Britain and Sweden. In the latter two countries, beta-blockers are the most widely prescribed antihypertensives, and also in Germany they rank quite high in sales, but less so in the number of prescriptions. Extreme differences are found in the utilization of cardiac glycosides between Germany and Great Britain, but little is known about the consequences of risk/benefit analyses of either over- or underprescribing of these drugs. It is highly recommended to make further efforts in analyzing drug utilization data and developing studies in drug epidemiology.", 
    "23": "Nitrates, betablockers an calcium antagonists are the major drugs for treating angina pectoris. Therapeutic efficacy and incidence of unwanted reactions depend on the proper choice and dosage of these agents. The type of ischemic symptoms, cardiac function, presence of sinoatrial or atrioventricular conduction anomalies, and coexistent non-cardiac disorders should be taken into account when a particular drug is selected. In patients with angina at rest a calcium antagonist is indicated in the first place, while in exercise-induced ischemia betablockers and calcium antagonists are equally effective. With regard to antianginal efficacy there are no important differences between various representatives of these drug groups, but their tolerance may markedly vary in individual patients. Combination of betablockers, calcium antagonists and/or nitrates is often required in cases with severe limitation of exercise capacity. Therapeutic guidelines for patient groups with and without congestive heart failure are suggested.", 
    "24": "Stimulation of splanchnic nerves and application of adrenergic drugs have been shown to give variable effects on gastric motor activity depending especially on the background activity. beta-adrenoceptors and dopaminergic receptors mediate inhibitory effect on proximal gastric motor activity. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of isoprenaline, a beta 1- and beta 2-agonist, and dopamine on gastric antral motility in gastric fistula dogs. Dopamine was used alone and in conjunction with selective blockade of adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors during infusion of bethanechol or pentagastrin inducing motor activity patterns as in the phase III of the MMC and the digestive state respectively. The stimulated antral motility was dose-dependently inhibited by dopamine. The effect was significantly blocked by specifically acting dopaminergic blockers, while alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockers were without any significant effects. Dose-response experiments with bethanechol and dopamine showed inhibition of a non-competitive type. Isoprenaline was used alone and in conjunction with selective blockade of beta 1- and beta 2-receptors during infusion of bethanechol which induces a pattern similar to phase III in the migrating myoelectric complex. The stimulated antral motility was dose-dependently inhibited by isoprenaline. The effect could be significantly blocked by propranolol (beta 1 + beta 2-adrenoceptor blocker) and by using in conjunction the beta 1-adrenoceptor blocker practolol and the beta 2-adrenoceptor blocker H 35/25. The dose-response experiments showed inhibition of a non-competitive type. These studies indicate that gastric antral motility is inhibited by isoprenaline through both beta 1- and beta 2-receptors and by dopamine through specific dopaminergic receptors.", 
    "25": "The actions of adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists are by no means agreed even though experiments with adrenal medulla extract date back to the beginning of the century. This review will consider the work of my own group and that of others in an attempt to classify the adrenoceptors which modulate gastric acid secretion. There are a number of factors to consider. Species differences are important and particular attention will be given to results from rat, dog and human. The secretagogue used is also important because the effect of adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists can be modified by the choice of histamine, muscarinic agonist, (penta) gastrin or food. Other factors include the gastric model used and the presence or absence of anaesthesia. The broad conclusions are that both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors can inhibit gastric acid secretion. Both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors mediate inhibition of pentagastrin-induced secretion while alpha-adrenoceptors are important in the reduction of histamine-induced gastric acid secretion.", 
    "26": "The purpose of this study was to elucidate the effect of alpha-, beta- and dopaminergic receptor stimulation and blockade on pentagastrin and bethanechol stimulated gastric acid secretion in conscious dogs with gastric fistula. Gastric acid secretion was found to be subject to a dose related inhibition by isoprenaline. The dose of isoprenaline producing approximately 50% inhibition was higher in the bethanechol--than the pentagastrin experiments (0.10 vs. 0.03 micrograms/kg/min.) and slightly lower after parietal cell vagotomy. The antisecretory effect was mediated via the beta 1-receptors alone. The inhibitory effect of isoprenaline on pentagastrin stimulated acid secretion showed the characteristics of competitive type and on bethanechol stimulated acid secretion of non competitive type. An increasing and dose-dependent stimulation of bethanechol stimulated gastric acid secretion was found for dopamine 1, 5 and 10 micrograms/kg/min. Dopamine (40 micrograms/kg/min.) exerted an inhibitory effect on pentagastrin and bethanechol stimulated gastric acid secretion mediated, via the beta 1-receptors. The stimulatory effect of low doses of dopamine during bethanechol stimulation could not be defined as an effect via beta-receptors. This dual response, the weak inhibitory effects and the potent decreasing effect on antral gastric motility indicate that dopamine has no physiologic relevant effect on gastric acid secretion. One may conclude that beta 1- and beta 2-receptors may exert an influence on gastric acid secretion in dogs. The main effect of dopamine seems to be on gastric motility, while the effect on gastric acid secretion is of minor importance.", 
    "27": "The relative influence of adrenergic receptors on gastric acid secretion in the dog stomach with different vagal activity or \"tone\" is almost unknown. beta-adrenoceptors seem to be most important for the direct effect of adrenergic stimulation on acid secretion. In this study the effects of vagotomy and beta 2-adrenoceptor activity were studied in conscious gastric fistula dogs. Pentagastrin stimulated acid output was increased slightly in non-vagotomized dogs and to its prevagotomy level in vagotomized dogs after propranolol infusion. Practolol showed no such effect. Histamine stimulated acid secretion was not influenced significantly by beta-blockade. Similar dose-response curves were found for non-vagotomized dogs with high beta 2-adrenergic tone and dogs with low vagal tone (vagotomy) after pentagastrin and histamine stimulated acid secretion. This study indicates that a counterbalance between beta 2-adrenergic and cholinergic vagal tone exists. A \"tonic balance theory\" is suggested and is probably involved in the resulting acid secretion after vagotomy.", 
    "28": "Previous studies have indicated that the endogenous peptide, melanotropin release inhibiting factor (MIF) and its analog cyclo(Leu-Gly) ( CLG ) facilitate dopamine (DA) receptor agonist binding and inhibit DA receptor supersensitivity induced by neuroleptics and opiates. The effect of CLG was tested on beta-adrenergic hypersensitivity induced by reserpine to ascertain whether CLG has effects on other neuronal systems besides DA. Administration of reserpine to rats induced hypomotility and enhanced binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol (DHA) to cortical membranes. Concurrent administration of CLG blocked both the hypomotility and the enhanced [3H]DHA binding to cortical membranes. Lithium has also been shown to prevent reserpine induced hypomotility and increased cortical [3H]DHA binding. These studies suggest that CLG may be producing its effect either like lithium or by an amphetamine like action. If CLG can be shown to have lithium like activity, it could prove to be useful in the treatment of mania.", 
    "29": "The influence of different baseline values (blood pressure, heart rate) on ED50- and Emax-values of isoprenaline dose-response curves (DRC) in the presence and absence of beta-blocking drugs was assessed in urethane-anesthetized rats. The results show that Urethane is a suitable anesthetic in this animal model. Different baselines have no influence in ED50-values. Assessment of potency of competitive antagonists (pA2) from complete DRC appears unaffected by differences in baseline or in Emax. Pharmacologic effects (heart rate, blood pressure) are better depicted as absolute effect values than delta-values.", 
    "30": "Studies have been performed to answer two questions: whether there are subgroups of beta 2-receptors separating effects in bronchial and skeletal muscle and whether beta 1-receptors in asthmatic airways mediate bronchoconstriction. Asthmatic patients have been studied in randomised cross-over trials. Effects on FEV1, heart rate and skeletal muscle tremor have been monitored. In some experimental studies, two new compounds, D2343 and QH-25, have shown a selectivity for beta 2-receptors in bronchial muscle compared to skeletal muscle. Studies in asthmatics did not confirm this. Thus, the beta 2-receptors in the two organs appear to be identical. The clinical effect of beta 1-receptors in the the airways was studied by giving selective beta 1-receptor blocking agents. It was shown that pafenolol , a beta-blocker more beta 1-selective than metoprolol, had less effect on FEV1 than metoprolol given in equipotent beta 1-blocking doses. Beta 1-receptor stimulation with a new selective beta 1-stimulating agent, prenalterol, did not give bronchodilation in doses which gave a significant increase of heart rate. Thus, beta 1-receptors do not contribute to bronchodilation in asthmatic patients.", 
    "31": "The hypothesis that a generalized defect in beta-adrenoceptor function characterized asthma and atopy has been proposed by Szentivanyi. Such a defect may be intrinsic to the beta-adrenoceptor mechanism or could be attributed to circulating factors which interfere with the binding of catecholamines to beta-adrenoceptors. This study shows that sera from a proportion of the asthmatic population studied contain beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity and that the degree of inhibition correlates with some of the clinical indices of asthma.",

    "33": "L-3,4-(3-3,4-Dimethoxyphene-ethylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy)-phenyl-++ +crotonic acid nitrile X HCl (Hoe 224) has beta 1-blocking action. In the isolated left atrium of the guinea pig, the ED50 necessary to counteract the positive inotropic action of 2 ng/ml isoprenaline (isoproterenol) was determined as 10.3 ng/ml in comparison to the ED50 of propranolol 2.7 ng/ml. On the isolated right atrium of the same animal, the ED50 for inhibition of increased heart rate brought about by 2 ng/ml isoprenaline was 29.5 ng/ml in comparison to the ED50 of propranolol 13.5 ng/ml. On the isolated tracheal chain of the guinea pig 40 micrograms Hoe 224/ml also inhibited relaxation induced by 50 ng isoprenaline/ml only by 31%. The ED50 for propranolol in this experiment was 1.2 ng/ml. Therefore, Hoe 224 is a very specific beta 1-blocker. In the dog anaesthetized with pentobarbital the ED50 of Hoe 224 for depression of dp/dt increase by 0.1 mg isoprenaline/kg i.v. was determined as 85 micrograms/kg i.v. Under the same conditions, the ED50 for propranolol was 10 micrograms/kg i.v., for atenolol 17 micrograms/kg i.v., for practolol 56 micrograms/kg i.v. In the conscious dog, 1.6 mg Hoe 224/kg orally depressed the increase of dp/dt brought about by 0.1 microgram isoprenaline/kg i.v. by 50%. The beta 2-blocking effect of Hoe 224 intraarterially against vasodilating effect of 0.01 microgram isoprenaline/kg given intraarterially in the A. femoralis of anaesthetized dogs was very weak. 100 micrograms Hoe 224/kg reduced the effect of isoprenaline only by 23%, but 2 micrograms propranolol/kg intraarterially reduced this effect by 61%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "34": "Peripheral alpha antagonists not only preserve renal hemodynamics, but decrease RVR and maintain renal perfusion autoregulation in the face of decreased systemic perfusion pressures. On the other hand, central alpha agonists appear to have variable effects. Clonidine preserves RBF and GFR both acutely and chronically, guanabenz decreases RBF acutely but not chronically, and alpha-methyl dopa preserved RBF but decreases GFR. Beta blockers also have variable effects on RBF: the most-often-studied beta blocker, propranolol, has reduced RBF by 10-20% while other commonly used beta blockers, such as nadolol and metoprolol, may preserve RBF. This may reflect propranolol's inability to maintain renal perfusion autoregulation in the face of decreased systemic blood pressure. This failure of propranolol is not completely understood but may be a function of its lack of cardioselectivity or ISA (49). It is also possible that inhibition of renal vasodilators such as the kallikrein-kinin system plays a role (49). Finally, it appears that patients with normal renal vascular tone may be at highest risk to suffer decrements in RBF with beta blockers. Perhaps most importantly, the clinical impact of propranolol's effect on renal function is unclear, since the reductions in GFR have not been sufficient to produce azotemia.", 
    "35": "Elevated vascular resistance is the key factor in most cases of essential hypertension. Vascular resistance is determined by the sarcoplasmatic concentration of free Ca2+. Experimental studies have shown an increased dependence for the noradrenaline-induced contraction on extracellular Ca2+ from the aorta to the small resistance vessels. This is in accordance with the potent vasodilating effect found with Ca2+-influx inhibitors in man. Furthermore, a selective enhancement of the vasodilating response to verapamil has been found in patients with essential hypertension as compared to normotensive subjects. The verapamil-induced vasodilation in the hypertensive patients was positively correlated to plasma adrenaline concentration. These findings suggest accentuated Ca2+-influx dependent vasoconstriction in essential hypertension, which is related to the activity of the sympathetic nervous system. Acute administration of verapamil and nifedipine results in a distinct fall in blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension but not in normotensive subjects. Generally, the percentage fall in blood pressure with Ca2+-channel blockers has been closely positively correlated to the initial blood pressure level and in an open study with 43 patients with essential hypertension the decrease in blood pressure to verapamil was also positively correlated to the age of patients. These data may provide the basis for a new treatment concept for essential hypertension proposing a Ca2+-channel blocker as the first choice for the older patients and a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent as the first line drug for the younger patients. Combined treatment with a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent and a Ca2+-channel blocker seems most efficient in normalizing blood pressure in many therapy-resistant hypertensive patients.", 
    "36": "Twenty-four hypertensive patients reported vasospastic symptoms in their hands during treatment with beta-blocking drugs with different pharmacological properties. Twenty patients had symptoms when staying indoors and 11 did not always experience complete relief of symptoms following active rewarming attempts. Finger systolic blood pressures were measured after standardized local cooling. In 15 patients, blood pressure decreased to a pathological level during this procedure. Previous beta-blockade was changed to combined alpha- and beta-blockade with labetalol given twice daily in a mean dose of 259 mg/day for 3 months. After this period, most patients showed a decreased temperature sensitivity both objectively and subjectively. Blood pressure control was maintained at the previous level. Heart rate increased significantly during treatment with labetalol. Labetalol offers an alternative treatment to patients suffering from vasospastic side-effects of beta-blockers.", 
    "37": "The fetal heart rate response to a controlled sound stimulus was recorded in 36 pregnant women before and after a maternal peroral dose of either 80 mg propranolol, or placebo. The sound stimulation was repeated 60 minutes, 120 minutes and 180 minutes after the drug administration. The fetal heart rate response to sound was significantly depressed by this moderate dose of propranolol. The sound stimulation method is found to reflect sensitively the immediate influence of propranolol on the fetus.", 
    "38": "The effects of two different beta-adrenergic antagonists on maternal arterial pressure and fetal heart rate were studied in 8 pregnant women with pregnancy hypertension. The fetal heart rate was monitored by abdominal ECG recording under standardized conditions. Basal heart rate, long-term variability and short-term variability were calculated in a computer. Four patients received 50-100 mg atenolol once daily; the other 4 received pindolol 10 mg b.i.d. Reduction in mean arterial blood pressure was seen in both groups of patients. The basal fetal heart rate was decreased in atenolol-exposed fetuses but not in pindolol-exposed fetuses. In this preliminary study there was no apparent effect on the fetal heart rate variability.", 
    "39": "A review is presented as regards the neonatal effects of beta-blocking agents in hypertension during pregnancy. Experience points to low fetal and neonatal risks, but firmly based data concerning the neonates are very scanty. An on-going double-blind study is presented in which pregnant women with hypertension are randomly allocated to either metoprolol or placebo treatment. One of the aims is to study the postnatal adaptation of the infants. The following measurements, recordings and examinations are performed: anthropometric measurements, Apgar score, blood gases and acid-base status in umbilical (venous and arterial) blood, lactate and hypoxanthine in umbilical venous blood, catecholamines in umbilical arterial blood, pulse rate, blood glucose and a quantitative neurobehavioral assessment in the neonatal period.", 
    "40": "It is generally accepted that hypertensive cardiovascular complications can be prevented by treatment. However, during pregnancy, antihypertensive drugs might be hazardous in view of their influence on the fetus. Nevertheless, in spite of the diverging published results, even beta-blockers have been used in the pregnant patient. As our basic knowledge concerning the circulatory and fetal effects is minimal, we decided to elucidate the influence of the non-selective beta-blocker, propranolol, on the haemodynamic circumstances in hypertensive pregnant rats. Renal hypertension was induced by clamping both renal arteries 4 weeks before pregnancy. Shortly before term, cardiac output was determined with the dye-dilution technique and utero-placental blood flow was determined with the microsphere technique, both before and after propranolol injection. Mean arterial pressure and heart rate were registered continuously. The acute propranolol injection reduced mean arterial pressure by 26%. This was due mainly to a 32% decrease in cardiac output, which in turn was due to a 24% decrease in stroke volume and a 6% decrease in heart rate. Both myometrial and placental blood flow decreased significantly, by 45 and 50%, respectively. It was furthermore of interest to observe the significant increase in blood flow resistance in both myometrium and placenta. In conclusion, it can be stated that the non-selective beta-blocker propranolol, which lacks intrinsic stimulating activity, reduces mean arterial pressure mainly by a cardiac output decrease. The present results further indicate that the influence on peripheral blood flow might be caused by cardiac output changes as well as by direct effects on the uteroplacental vascular bed.", 
    "41": "Maternal and fetal beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade was induced in sheep by infusing i.v. 11 pregnant ewes with metoprolol in doses producing maternal plasma concentrations of metoprolol comparable to those obtained in clinical use. Ten other ewes and their fetuses served as controls. Under acute anaesthesia the fetus was exteriorized and subjected to two levels of controlled asphyxia by intermittent, complete obstruction of the maternal placental blood flow. Fetal haemodynamic reactions were assessed by measuring fetal heart rate, cardiac contractility, cardiac output and cerebral blood flow. The metabolic reactions were evaluated from blood gases, pH, lactate and hypoxanthine concentrations, while the electrophysiological status of the brain was evaluated from the somatosensory evoked EEG potentials (SEP). Already during the period of moderate asphyxia the beta-blocked fetuses demonstrated a blunted haemodynamic response, in comparison with the control fetuses, resulting in an accelerating lactic acidosis, signs of a breakdown of intra-cellular energy-rich phosphates and an impaired cerebral function. During the period of severe asphyxia, both groups of fetuses exhibited signs of extensive cerebral deterioration. During the ensuing recovery phase, 80% of the control fetuses regained their brain function, as assessed by SEP, whereas this was true for only 30% of the beta 1-blocked fetuses. It is concluded that the ovine fetus relies heavily on greatly increased sympatho-adrenal activity to adapt itself to asphyxia and that blockade of the fetal beta 1-adrenoreceptors by maternal medication is a hazard to the potentially asphyctic fetus.", 
    "42": "Effective blood pressure treatment has only been available during the last 20-25 years. Most antihypertensive drugs employed for other hypertensive conditions have also been used in hypertensive states of pregnancy. In this survey, most of the drugs already in use and some new ones are discussed. No special emphasis is placed on the use of drugs in emergency situations. As beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs are widely used nowadays, the principal differences between some beta-blockers are discussed in detail. A discussion of future requirements in order to get a better picture of the value of antihypertensive drugs completes this survey.", 
    "43": "The symptoms of hypertension in pregnancy may be exacerbated by pain or other stressful stimuli, arising during labour. The anaesthetist has a part to play in alleviating these problems, through his knowledge of analgesic techniques. In addition, pre-eclampsia sometimes necessitates delivery by cesarean section. Increases in arterial pressure during intubation and surgery may be poorly tolerated. Proper anaesthetic management of pre-eclampsia therefore requires knowledge of circulatory and other, e.g. hormonal, responses to pain and other types of stress. The present paper gives a short review of these aspects.", 
    "44": "The effects of prenalterol, a selective beta 1-adrenoreceptor agonist, were studied in a patient with the Shy-Drager syndrome, presenting with incapacitating orthostatic hypotension. The main haemodynamic defect was an impressive postural fall in stroke volume and cardiac output pointing to denervation of the capacitance vessels. Prenalterol 4 X 30 mg orally produced a marked increase in supine and standing blood pressure, along with substantial symptomatic improvement. Notable positive chronotropic and inotropic effects were observed. Association of fludrocortisone 0.5 mg/day resulted in further haemodynamic and symptomatic improvement, presumably due to plasma volume expansion. Haemodynamically, prenalterol and fludrocortisone resulted in a substantial increase in standing cardiac output, primarily due to the chronotropic effects of prenalterol. In addition to the haemodynamic effects, prenalterol stimulated the renin-aldosterone system and restored the normal diurnal pattern of water and sodium excretion, the latter may have contributed to the improvement of orthostatic tolerance. Prenalterol could be a valuable adjunct to the existing treatment schedules of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension.", 
    "45": "The submandibular glands of male rats were exposed to 50 Gy X-irradiation as a single dose, with or without pre-treatment with either alpha-adrenergic agonists (noradrenaline, phenylephrine) or a cholinergic antagonist (atropine). The effects were analyzed by morphometric, cytochemical and biophysical methods. When X-irradiated without drug pre-treatment, many serous epithelial cells of the intralobular convoluted ducts displayed morphologic evidence of irreversible radiation damage, in contrast to neighbouring mucous and other cells which were unaffected. The effect was maximal 96 h after irradiation. Serous cells from animals irradiated after pre-treatment with atropine showed much more wide-spread injury than those of animals exposed to X-irradiation only. In contrast , serous cells suffered considerably less damage if their secretory granules had been depleted 1 or 2 h before irradiation with either noradrenaline or phenylephrine. Other epithelial cells showed no modulation of their slight radioresponsiveness by these drugs. The observations were substantiated by morphometry of three cell types: (a) mucous cells, (b) non-granulated serous and intralobular striated duct cells, and (c) granulated serous cells. The findings suggest that the striking radiosensitivity of salivary gland serous epithelial cells is linked to their content of secretory granules. These granules are rich in heavy metals, as demonstrated cytochemically with the sulphide silver method (SSM). Using particle-induced X-ray emission ( PIXE ) spectroscopy, the principal metals were shown to be Zn, Mn and Fe. It is conceivable that membranes which enclose organelles rich in metals with the ability to form redox systems (e.g. Fe2+ in equilibrium Fe3+) show enhanced sensitivity to radiation damage due to the metal-catalyzed induction of lipid peroxidation by ionizing radiation. Disruption of secretory granules would be expected to release lytic enzymes into the cell sap, resulting in autolysis. This hypothesis is supported by the findings that atropine--which increases the number of granulated serous cells--enhances radiosensitivity, while noradrenaline and phenylephrine--which cause degranulation of serous cells--decrease radiosensitivity.",

    "47": "Electrophysiologic effects of acetylcholine (Ach) injections were compared to those obtained by vagus stimulation with and without beta-adrenoreceptor blockade during right heart catheterization in 12 dogs. Monophasic action potentials were obtained by suction electrode technique, and programmed electrical stimulation was used to determine heart rate independent changes in 50 and 90% repolarization times and the effective (V-FRP) and functional (V-FRP) refractory periods of the right ventricle. Vagus stimulation decreased heart rate with and without beta-blockade, while after Ach injections a marked increase in heart rate was found, which could be eliminated by beta-blockade. Vagus stimulation increased action potential duration and refractoriness at high sympathetic tone induced by pentobarbital anesthesia, mainly by inhibiting the effect of beta-adrenoreceptor stimulation. It is concluded that stimulation of the vagus induces antiarrhythmic effects at high sympathetic activity, while the change in ventricular electrophysiology found after Ach injections in high doses to intact animals is an effect probably induced by stimulation of beta 1-receptors.", 
    "48": "Pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions which involve currently available benzodiazepines may be classified into two major categories: interactions which affect benzodiazepine rate of absorption, and interactions which affect clearance and, therefore, elimination half-life. Ethanol is the prototype for absorptive interactions.

In addition, ethanol, cimetidine and isoniazid decrease first-pass hepatic extraction of triazolam, enhancing its systemic availability and decreasing oral clearance. The pharmacokinetic consequence of induction of benzodiazepine oxidation is higher clearance and decreased steady-state concentrations during chronic dosing. Conversely, inhibition of benzodiazepine oxidation decreases clearance and increases steady-state benzodiazepine concentrations during chronic dosing. Because a correlation of benzodiazepine plasma concentration and pharmacological effect is not established, the pharmacodynamic consequences of these interactions are not currently well characterized.",

    "50": "Glycogenolysis was stimulated by catecholamines in in vitro cultures of hepatic tissue of Xenopus laevis. Dose response curves showed that adrenaline and isoprenaline were equally effective while noradrenaline and phenylephrine were progressively less effective in eliciting glycogen breakdown. Neither oxymetazoline nor methoxamine had any effect on glycogenolysis. Administration of adrenaline to cultures was followed within 1 min by a rise in tissue cyclic AMP concentration and within 2 min by an increase in phosphorylase a activity. Both these responses were blocked by propranolol but little affected by phenoxybenzamine. These findings suggest that catecholamines activate glycogenolysis via a beta-adrenergic receptor in X. laevis and that alpha-adrenergic receptors play no role in regulating hepatic glycogenolysis in this species.", 
    "51": "Noradrenaline showed a negative inotropic effect on the isolated electrically triggered atrium of the perch. The effect was stronger at lower temperature and was antagonized by an alpha adrenergic blocker, phentolamine. The inotropic effect of adrenaline was dependent on incubation temperature. The effect was negative at 15 C but biphasic at 24 C, where with increasing adrenaline concentration a positive inotropic effect was followed by negative inotropy. Phentolamine not only antagonized the negative inotropic effect of adrenaline at 15 degrees C but changed it to positive. This positive inotropic effect was antagonized by a beta adrenergic blocker, propranolol. On the triggered ventricular strip adrenaline had no effect at 6 or 15 C, but increased contraction force at 24 C. It can be suggested that in the perch heart atrium there is an activity balance of alpha and beta receptors, which mediate the negative and positive inotropic control, respectively. As in higher vertebrates, alpha adrenergic activation decreases and beta activation increases by agonists in the following order: noradrenaline, adrenaline and isoprenaline. The balance changes towards increased beta activity when temperature rises.", 
    "52": "Using the guppy, Lebistes reticulatus, and the siluroid catfish, Parasilurus asotus , the effects of purine and pyrimidine derivatives on the movement of melanophores were studied. All the substances tested did not aggregate pigment within melanophores. Adenosine and adenine nucleotides were very effective in dispersing melanosomes within the cell, although adenine itself lacked such action. Derivatives of other purines than adenine and of pyrimidines did not disperse melanosomes. The pigment dispersion induced by adenine derivatives was specifically antagonized by methylxanthines. It was concluded that adenosine receptors are present on the melanophore membrane, which take part in the darkening reaction of fishes.", 
    "53": "Medroxalol and two of its enantiomers (MDL 17, 330A , MDL 17, 331A ) were tested for activity at adrenergic receptors to clarify the mechanism(s) of the antihypertensive action of medroxalol . The potency order for blocking postsynaptic alpha 1-receptors in vivo in rats was similar to that reported in vitro. However, relatively high doses of these compounds were necessary to block alpha 1-receptors in vivo compared to their antihypertensive doses. Postsynaptic alpha 2-receptors were not blocked by medroxalol in vitro. Propranolol pretreatment of rats to block vascular beta 2-receptors antagonized much of the hypotensive response to medroxalol and its enantioners , most extensively with MDL 17, 330A , but much less with MDL 17, 331A . The potency rank order as beta 2-adrenergic agonists was the same as previously reported for these compounds as beta 1-adrenergic receptor antagonists. The stimulation of beta 2-adrenergic receptors in vascular smooth muscle appears to be an important factor in the hypotensive action of medroxalol .", 
    "54": "Our current understanding of the pathophysiology of angina and myocardial ischemia includes both anatomic and dynamic mechanisms. The relative contribution made by hemodynamically important atherosclerotic obstruction and dynamic coronary artery obstruction, either by arterial spasm or arteriolar constriction, to the pathophysiology of ischemia in any given patient should be delineated. This information appears to be useful in identifying patients likely to achieve major benefit from vasodilators on the one hand or beta-adrenergic blocking agents on the other. A number of agents are now available within these two pharmacologic classes. There are some differences in action of these various agents that require thorough familiarity of effects of these drugs so that their action can be optimized. Practically speaking, the large majority of patients with an angina syndrome will respond to nitrates. Nitrates are extremely safe and cheap; thus, their use for relief or prevention of the acute ischemic episode remains the initial treatment of choice. When symptoms are more than mild to moderate in severity, or unacceptably controlled in frequency using nitrates alone, other pharmacologic measures are needed (Fig. 2). In patients with a predominant symptom of effort angina, suggesting that a hemodynamically important atherosclerotic-type obstruction is responsible for the syndrome, beta-adrenergic blocking drugs can be very helpful. If effort angina remains unacceptably controlled or adverse effects occur, a calcium-channel antagonist may be added or substituted. These latter agents do not exacerbate bronchospasm or peripheral vascular disease, and they offer a distinct advantage over beta-adrenergic blocking agents in patients with angina who have such disorders. Where the predominant symptom is rest angina, or the patient has other evidence suggesting coronary spasm or arteriolar vasoconstriction, a calcium-channel antagonist may result in a very favorable response. This therapy should be extended not only to patients in whom coronary spasm occurs spontaneously but to those in whom it can be provoked by stimuli such as effort or cold. When spasm is superimposed upon hemodynamically important atherosclerotic obstruction, the favorable response does not seem to be as great as that seen when spasm exists alone. In these cases, coronary bypass surgery, plexectomy , and other nonpharmacologic approaches may have to be added to the pharmacologic regimen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "55": "It is reasonable to consider treating the patient with an uncomplicated infarction with as many as 10 drugs: a benzodiazepine, a sedative, oxygen, morphine, lidocaine, a nitrate, an anticoagulant, a thrombolytic agent, a beta blocker, and possibly a calcium-channel antagonist. Obviously, experienced judgment must be used in selecting the appropriate agents for each patient. A properly staffed and equipped coronary care unit continues to be the most important preventative for unnecessary deaths during the acute phase of myocardial infarction.", 
    "56": "To characterize the pharmacological profile of a new beta-adrenoceptor blocker, 4-[3-(tert-butylamino)-2-hydroxypropoxy]-N-methylisocarbostyril hydrochloride (N-696), experiments were performed in the isolated atria and trachea of the guinea pig, in the pithed rat, in the anesthetized rabbit, in anesthetized dogs and in anesthetized open-chest dogs. Antiarrhythmic action was assessed in conscious as well as in anesthetized dogs. Although N-696 was a non-selective beta-blocker 15-20 times less potent than propranolol under in vitro conditions, it was as effective a blocker as propranolol under in vivo conditions. N-696 produced a fall of the blood pressure in the pithed rat and attenuated the blood pressure rise produced by stimulation of the preganglionic sympathetic nerve. In the anesthetized rabbits, it produced a hypotensive effect associated with an increased discharge of the renal nerve. In anesthetized dogs it produced a hypotensive effect and a decrease in the myocardial blood flow. However, the decrease in the myocardial blood flow was smaller than that produced by propranolol. All these findings indicate that N-696 has a direct vasodilatory effect besides its beta-blocking action. As a beta-blocker N-696 was unique in that it produced a potent antiarrhythmic effect in two-stage coronary ligation arrhythmia.", 
    "57": "The effects caused on the intestine mesenteric artery preparation by 1-[2-ethoxy-2-(3'-pyridyl)ethyl]-4-(2'-methoxy-phenyl) piperazine (IP-66), a compound having a prevailing alpha-blocking action, and by dihydroergotoxine mesylate (DHEM) were compared in normal conditions and in propranolol-induced beta-receptors block. The two drugs behaved in a completely different way both on vasoconstrictor response (delta p) and on noradrenaline (norepinephrine, NA) outflow induced by electrical stimulation of periarterial nerves. In fact IP-66 inhibited delta p much more than DHEM did but, unlike the latter, it increased NA outflow only at the lowest concentration (8.7 X 10(-9) mol/l) whereas it reduced it at the highest one (2.9 X 10(-7) mol/l). Moreover the effect of IP-6--but not that of DHEM--on NA outflow was completely abolished by propranolol. The hypothesis is put forward that IP-66 may show a strong antagonism towards postsynaptic alpha-receptors and a slight agonism towards presynaptic beta-receptors.",

    "59": "The effect of chronic beta-adrenergic blockade on central circulatory adaptations to physical training was investigated. 16 healthy sedentary males (20-31 yrs) trained on cycle ergometers 40 min/day, 4 days a week for 8 weeks at a work load that during the last 5 weeks corresponded to 75% of the pretraining VO2 max. In a single blind way, 8 subjects were during the training period treated with the beta-adrenergic receptor blocker propranolol (160 mg/day), while the remaining 8 received placebo tablets. Pretraining tests were performed before the start of medication and posttraining tests were performed 6 days after the last day of training and medication. The training program resulted in a similar increase (8%) in VO2 max in both groups (p less than 0.01). The resting heart rate (-4 beats/min; p less than 0.05) as well as the exercise heart rate at a moderate work load (120 W: -11 beats/min; p less than 0.01) decreased with training, and no significant difference was seen between the 2 groups. At a high work load (180 W), however, the heart rate decreased significantly more with training in the placebo group as compared with the beta-blockade group (-19 vs. -7 beats/min; p less than 0.05). The oxygen pulse (VO2/HR) increased in both groups at 120 W (+6%; p less than 0.01). At 180 W the oxygen pulse increased only in the placebo group (+8%; p less than 0.05). The estimated stroke volume at 120 and 180 W, as determined by impedance cardiography, did not change significantly with training although there was a tendency towards an increase in the placebo group only. The resting left ventricular wall thickness and diameter, as determined by echocardiography, did not change significantly with training in either group.--In conclusion, the present study indicates that a moderate degree of beta-adrenergic blockade does not prevent or impair the training-induced increase in the maximal oxygen uptake. During submaximal work, however, the circulatory adaptation may be less apparent if training has been performed during partial blockade of the sympatho-adrenal system.", 
    "60": "In absence of beta-receptor blocking agents, alpha-adrenergic inotropic effects could be demonstrated in the rat myocardium for the synthetic alpha-agonists phenylephrine and methoxamine, but not for the naturally occurring catecholamines, adrenaline and noradrenaline. Other synthetic alpha-agonists were without effects. In the presence of the beta-receptor blocking agent, propranolol or timolol, marked alpha-effects were demonstrated for adrenaline and noradrenaline in both the right and left atria and the right ventricle. The results indicate that alpha-receptors may be functionally important in the beta-blocked myocardium.",

All four drugs were equally effective in increasing the electrical threshold for induction of ventricular fibrillation, but efficacy failed to correlate with reported beta-blocking efficacy. The d-isomers of the respective beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents, sotalol and propranolol, were equipotent and equally effective at increasing the fibrillation threshold compared to their respective racemates. The ability of beta-adrenergic antagonists to increase the fibrillation threshold could not be attributed to changes in intraventricular conduction, ventricular refractoriness, or ventricular excitability in common with all four drugs. The antifibrillatory actions of the beta-adrenergic receptor blocking drugs could not be attributed solely to either beta-adrenergic blockade or specific alterations in the membrane properties of the cardiac cell.",

Haloperidol (0.02 mg/kg, s.c.) reduced the yawning induced by DA-agonists to about 50%. The potencies of the DA-agonists in inducing yawning were APO greater than TL-99 greater than 3-PPP (comparable to potencies obtained in other in vivo tests, determining DA-ergic activity). The findings support the validity of the yawning phenomenon as a screening test for DA-agonists. Additionally, it was found that apomorphine induced yawning was significantly and dose-dependently enhanced by the beta-agonist, formoterol. This effect was counteracted by scopolamine, not changed by metergoline and further increased by l-propranolol. These data support the hypothesis of cholinergic involvement in yawning and indicate a role, though unclear at present, of beta-receptors in this behaviour.", 
    "63": "Spontaneous contractions of uterine muscle strips from juvenile, anoestral and pregnant sheep were recorded in vitro isometrically. There is a spontaneous contractile activity irrespective of hormonal status of the animals. Acetylcholine increases the tone and frequency of the phasic contractions of uterine corpus and horn preparations from the three groups of animals. The adrenaline excitatory effect on the myometrial contractions was mediated by alpha-adrenoreceptors. The pregnant uterine strips showed strengthening of the inhibitory effect mediated by the beta-adrenoreceptors.", 
    "64": "The effects of two beta-blocking drugs on endogenous insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity were investigated in a double-blind cross-over study in 13 hypertensive patients. The patients were randomly allocated to each of three 2-week treatment periods with propranolol 80 mg b.i.d., atenolol 50 mg b.i.d. and placebo b.i.d. Endogenous insulin secretion was assessed by measuring serum insulin and C-peptide before and 6 min after iv administration of glucagon; insulin sensitivity was determined by measuring insulin binding to erythrocytes, and as the glucose disappearance rate (KITT) after i.v. insulin. Fasting concentrations of serum free fatty acids (S-FFA) and plasma gastric inhibitory polypeptide (P-GIP) were also recorded during the three study periods. Both propranolol and atenolol reduced blood pressure, heart rate and S-FFA concentrations compared to placebo, and all patients showed measurable plasma concentrations of propranolol and atenolol. The results can be considered representative, therefore, of clinical beta-blockade. The two drugs did not significantly influence the fasting blood glucose level. There was an increase in fasting and glucagon-stimulated serum C-peptide concentration during propranolol therapy compared with placebo (p = 0.037 and p = 0.030, respectively), although this was not reflected by a significant change in serum insulin. Propranolol and atenolol did not significantly influence insulin binding to erythrocytes, but they clearly reduced the glucose disappearance rate KITT was compared to placebo (p = 0.0036 and p = 0.0003), respectively). The findings support the view that beta-blocking drugs can influence glucose metabolism by mechanisms other than inhibition of endogenous insulin secretion."
