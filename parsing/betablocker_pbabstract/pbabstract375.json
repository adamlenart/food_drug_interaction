Obese dogs exhibited elevated body weight (59%), blood pressure (14%), and heart rate (25%). Differences in resting heart rate (control, 58 +/- 5 beats/min; obese, 83 +/- 7 beats/min) were abolished after hexamethonium, indicating an autonomic mechanism. Hexamethonium also reduced blood pressure in obese (20 +/- 4 mmHg) but not control (9 +/- 6 mmHg) animals. Propranolol did not affect heart rate in either group, excluding a beta-adrenergic mechanism. Subsequent administration of atropine increased heart rate more in control than in obese dogs (110 +/- 9 vs. 57 +/- 11 beats/min). The sensitivity of the cardiac limb of the baroreflex (Oxford method) was reduced by 46% in the obese group, confirming impairment of the parasympathetic control of heart rate. The standard deviation of blood pressure measurements was normal when expressed as a percentage of the mean arterial blood pressure (control, 11.2 +/- 0.4%; obese, 11.2 +/- 0.5%). Our results indicate that the development of obesity in dogs fed a high saturated fat diet is accompanied by an attenuated resting and reflex parasympathetic control of heart rate.", 
    "1": "A retrospective comparative study of the use of antianginal drugs in 1987 and 1992/93 has been carried out in unselected series of patients admitted for angiographic evaluation. Compared with the patients in 1987 the patients in 1992/93 were treated with approximately 50% of the doses of beta-blockers and isosorbide dinitrate. There was also a considerable reduction of the proportion of patients who received doses of beta-blockers of a similar level as used in large multicentre studies showing improved survival after myocardial infarction. The explanation of this change in therapy may be due, at least partly, to a general fear of side-effects.", 
    "2": "A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study compared the effectiveness and tolerability of three treatments for glaucoma: 2% carteolol/2% pilocarpine fixed-ratio combination (CBS 341A) twice a day, versus a 0.5% timolol/2% pilocarpine fixed combination twice a day versus 2% carteolol twice a day and 2% pilocarpine three times a day. The treatment period lasted 2 months. At the end of the comparative study, CBS 341A was evaluated in an open-label study during 1 year in the same patients. Seventy-two patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or high intraocular pressure were included in the study. Their intraocular pressure was >21 mm Hg while receiving beta-blocker eyedrops alone. After 15 days and 2 months of treatment with one of the three study treatments, intraocular pressure was measured at 12 noon and 7 p.m.", 
    "3": "The three treatments reduced intraocular pressure similarly but there was a trend toward better intraocular pressure control with administration of the individual drugs as measured at 7 p.m. Mean reductions in intraocular pressure at 7 p.m. on day 60 were the following: 6.04 mm Hg in the CBS 341A group, 5.67 mm Hg in the timolol/pilocarpine group, and 7.90 mm Hg in the group with the individual drugs. Test medications were well tolerated apart from the usual and well-known effects of pilocarpine. At the end of the double-blind period, 70 patients received CBS 341A for 1 year. Intraocular pressure was measured at noon every 4 months. Fifty-three patients had controlled intraocular pressure with CBS 341A alone. Among the other 17 patients, 2 dropped out, 5 had to change their treatment because of disease progression, 6 underwent argon laser trabeculoplasty, 3 required carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, and 1 had trabeculectomy. There were no withdrawals for intolerance.", 
    "4": "The aim of this study was to observe the effect of general anaesthesia (GA) on multiple dimensions of cognitive functioning in hypertensives on propranolol therapy (group A) in comparison to a control group (group B). Ten subjects in each group were administered a battery of six psychological cognitive tests pre- and post-intervention under GA. Both groups showed a significant decrement in memory scores on the 4th postoperative day which showed signs of recovery on seventh day (P < 0.05 for both groups). The group A patients were further compromised in one of the intelligence test scores (Standard progressive matrices) from the beginning (P < 0.05). Although this intergroup deficit persisted even on the 7th postoperative day (P < 0.05), no added effects of GA on this parameter was observed in group A (P > 0.05). In conclusion, GA induced transient memory deficit in both groups. This should be kept in mind while considering 'street fitness' following general anaesthesia.", 
    "5": "Left ventricular remodelling after acute myocardial infarction, through long-term left ventricular chamber dilatation and increased wall stress can result in alteration of the contractile properties of the non-infarct zone, impairment of the systolic and diastolic performances of the left ventricle, and eventually congestive heart failure. Left ventricular remodelling is influenced by several factors, among which the role of systemic and tissue renin angiotensin systems is determinant. Pharmacological interventions on the renin angiotensin systems were shown to limit left ventricular remodelling and reduce mortality from acute myocardial infarction in rats and humans, although the results of some trials remain controversial. To date, the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors have only been demonstrated in patients with a low residual ejection fraction. Recent observations of changes in left ventricular chamber dilatation and left ventricular wall hypertrophy occurring over the course of time after acute myocardial infarction allow better definition of the subset of patients who are at risk of progressive left ventricular dysfunction and congestive heart failure. An akinetic surface >20%, a left ventricular ejection fraction <0 x 40, an anterior location of the infarction, a stroke volume <31 ml.m(-2) during the acute phase, and persistent occlusion of the infarct-related artery are the most powerful predictors of late left ventricular function impairment. Some issues remain controversial, such as the optimal time for introducing ACE inhibitors after the onset of symptoms, the potential additive effects of ACE inhibitors given in conjunction with thrombolytic therapy, and the role of systemic angioplasty of the infarct-related artery.", 
    "6": "In order to compare the long-term effects on ambulatory blood pressure and left ventricular hypertrophy of hydralazine and lisinopril we studied 30 patients, all males, still hypertensive (diastolic blood pressure > or = 95 mm Hg) despite combined beta-blocker/diuretic therapy and with echocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy (left ventricular mass index > or = 1.31 g.m(-1)). They wer randomized to receive hydralazine slow release 50 mg/ chlorthalidone 12.5 mg) for 6 months. Casual blood pressure, non-invasive ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), M-mode echocardiogram, plasma renin activity and plasma catecholamines were evaluated before the randomization and after 6 months of treatment. Both drugs significantly reduced casual as well as daytime systolic and diastolic blood pressure, without statistical differences between the two treatments. Lisinopril was significantly more effective than hydralazine in reducing night-time systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Plasma norepinephrine was significantly reduced by lisinopril and increased by hydralazine. Left ventricular mass was significantly reduced by lisinopril but not by hydralazine. The results of linear regression and multiple regression analysis suggested that the lisinopril-induced decrease in both day- and night-time blood pressure might account for the regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, whereas the lack of left ventricular hypertrophy regression during hydralazine treatment could be due mainly to the reflex sympathetic activation induced by the drug.", 
    "7": "The conformational structure of beta1-blockers metoprolol, atenolol and practolol has been investigated by PCILO method. The aminoalkanol moiety adopts the same conformation in all these compounds. These beta-antagonists differ only in the conformation adopted by the substituent para to the aminoalkanol moiety. The graphical representation of the B1-antagonists for the final conformation reveals that only in the S-form, three interacting sites, namely, aromatic moiety, the beta-hydroxyl group and the -NH2(+) groups of aminoalkanol moiety are available for interactions with the receptor. The interaction of the aryloxy oxygen of the beta-antagonists with water molecule has also been taken into account. A linear relationship was obtained between log K (the partitioning of the beta-blocker in DMPC and also in octanol/water) and the potencies of these beta1-antagonists. Possibly, the role of para substituent is to act as an anchor by partitioning in the lipid bilayer so that the beta1-antagonist adopts the proper orientation for binding to the receptor.", 
    "8": "The early molecular mechanisms activated by the treatment of human lymphocytes with human interferon beta have been studied. These identify an early increase with respect to control, in diacylglycerol (DG) levels as response to interferon treatment. Such a DG production was derived from the rapid and sequential activation of phosphoinositide specific phospholipase C and phospholipase D pathway. This suggests that a synergistic involvement of phosphatidylinositol-bis-phosphate (PIP2) hydrolysis and phosphatidylcholine (PC) breakdown provide early molecular events upon the interaction between interferon beta and its cell surface receptors. This finally leads to the slowing down of cell growth.", 
    "9": "The possibility was investigated that centrally administered rat prolactin (PRL), i.e., intracerebroventricularly (ICV) or intrathecally (IT), may influence mammary contractility in urethane-anesthetized lactating rats. In addition to the monomer (23 kD PRL), the 16- and 7-kD PRL fragments were also tested and their effects were determined on isometrically recorded intramammary pressure (IMP) responses to exogenous oxytocin (OXY). ICV injection of 23 kD PRL provoked increased IMP responses; similar, but inconsistent effects were obtained after 16 kD PRL, and no effect occurred after either saline or the 7 kD PRL fragment. The 23 kD PRL effect had a latency of about 5 min, reached plateau at 10-15 min and its magnitude was dose-dependent. Also, a stronger dose-related effect was shown by 23 kD PRL after IT than after ICV administration, which suggests that lower threshold for the PRL actions exist at the spinal level. On the other hand, ICV or IT injections of antiserum to PRL, but not of normal rabbit serum, fully prevented the respective facilitatory effects of 23 kD PRL on mammary contractility. Further experiments into the mechanisms involved showed that neither adrenalectomy nor hypophysectomy prevented the PRL effect whereas complete blockage occurred after either spinal cord transection, ventral root section (T8-T10 level), or i.v. or ICV administration of the adrenergic beta-blocker propranolol. These results indicate that central effects of PRL upon mammary contractility were neurally mediated and may have resulted from depressed beta-adrenergic control of ductal tone.", 
    "10": "Activation of vascular beta-adrenergic receptors prevents an increase in vascular permeability caused by free radicals or inflammatory peptides. Methylxanthines seem to have similar protective effects on vascular endothelium. In the present study we investigated the effect of theophylline on the beta-adrenergic receptor expression and cAMP concentrations in cultured endothelial and smooth muscle cells from bovine aorta. Comparable values for beta-receptor density and binding affinity were detected in both cell types. Isoproterenol induced significant downregulation of beta-receptors in endothelial (BAEC: -60.5%) and smooth muscle cells (BASMC: -52.5%; P < 0.01). Incubation of endothelial cells with theophylline (4 micrograms/ml and and 40 micrograms/ml) for 24 hours did not affect beta-receptor expression, whereas in smooth muscle cells the beta-receptor density was reduced for -31.5% and -28.7%, respectively. In endothelial cells a transient effect on cAMP concentrations was observed after stimulation with isoproterenol (1 microM), but no effect was found in theophylline treated endothelial cells. Stimulation of intact smooth muscle cells with isoproterenol and theophylline (4 micrograms/ml and 40 micrograms/ml) resulted in a significant increase of cAMP concentrations after 60 and 240 minutes. The present data suggest a novel, celltype specific effect of theophylline on the beta-adrenergic receptor expression in vascular smooth muscle cells in vitro.", 
    "11": "INSULIN RESISTANCE AND HYPERTENSION: Hypertension is often associated with insulin resistance, which may be the underlying cause of hypertension in many cases. The whole complex of insulin resistance and its related factors appears to be based on a reduction in nutritional blood flow to large muscle groups. EFFECT OF TREATMENT: Blood flow is further reduced during beta-blockade but improves during alpha 1-blockade, which may explain the contrasting effects of these treatments on insulin resistance and triglyceride metabolism.",

As monotherapy, each type of agent will normalize blood pressure in about half of all hypertensive patients. Replacing one drug with another that acts through a different mechanism improves the probability of controlling blood pressure. Another way to increase the number of responders is to increase the dose; however, this often results in more side effects. A preferable way of improving efficacy is to combine low doses of drugs that have different impacts on the cardiovascular system, thus opposing the compensatory responses that tend to limit the blood pressure drop.",

    "16": "Acebutolol induces transient polyclonal B cell activation in C57B1/6 mice but down-modulates the spontaneous polyclonal activation of NZBxNZW lupus mice. The immunomodulatory effects of this beta-blocker were studied in C57l/6 mice injected with LPS or immunized with sheep red blood cells. The effect of acebutolol on the polyclonal activation of lymphocytes induced by LPS was also investigated in heterozygous and nu/nu C57BL/6 mice. Finally, the direct effect of acebutolol on spleen cells was studied in vitro. Acebutolol treatment for 15 days (50mg/kg/day) inhibited the polyclonal activation of lymphocytes induced by LPS in C57BL/6 and in C57BI/6 nu/nu mice, but increased the humoral response to sheep red blood cells in C57Bl/6 mice. Moreover, spleen cells from C57Bl/6 mice treated for 15 days with acebutolol showed an increased number of CD5+ and CD4+ lymphocytes, as well as an increased reactivity to concanavalin A but not to LPS. In vitro, acebutolol at 10(-5)-10(-7) M induced an increased reactivity of spleen cells from naive mice to concanavalin A, whereas it did not affect the B cell responsiveness to LPS. These results indicate that acebutolol modulates both T-cells and non T-cells in the immune system.",

The effects of chronic (-)-isoprenaline infusion (400 micrograms kg-1 h-1; 4 h-14 days) on rat ventricular muscarinic M2-cholinoceptors and beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors was determined. [3H]-N-methylscopolamine (NMS) was used to measure M2-cholinoceptor binding and (-)-[125I]-cyanopindolol (CYP) was used for beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor binding. 2. Chronic infusion of (-)-isoprenaline did not affect either the affinity of [3H]-NMS for M2-cholinoceptors, or the maximal density of these receptors (Bmax) at all treatment periods investigated (4 and 20 h; 7 and 14 days). The affinity of (-)-[125I]-CYP for beta-adrenoceptors was not changed following chronic (-)-isoprenaline infusion (4, 12 and 20 hours; 7 and 14 days). 3. Competition between (-)-[125I]-CYP and the selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist CGP 20712A resulted in biphasic curves at all treatment periods corresponding to the presence of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor binding sites. beta 1-adrenoceptors made up the greater proportion of beta-adrenoceptors in rat ventricle. There was no change in the ratio of beta 1- to beta 2-adrenoceptors following 4 h (-)-isoprenaline infusion [(beta 1:beta 2), vehicle: 77.5 +/- 4.0%:22.5 +/- 4.0%, n = 6; (-)-isoprenaline: 79.2 +/- 1.2%:20.8 +/- 1.2%, n = 6], however infusion for 12 h increased the ratio [(beta 1:beta 2), vehicle: 65.2 +/- 6.1%:34.8 +/- 6.1%, n = 6; (-)-isoprenaline: 85.6 +/- 1.8%:14.4 +/- 1.8%, n = 6, P < 0.05], which was maintained for longer infusion periods (20 h-14 days). 4.

    "18": "Inhaled nitric oxide, a selective pulmonary vasodilator, reverses hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and is an effective treatment in some cases of human pulmonary hypertension. Localization of nitric oxide synthase had indicated a neural role for nitric oxide. Thus, we studied the interactions between inhaled nitric oxide and systemic and pulmonary vascular reactivity in acute neurogenic hypertension. In 6 male beagle dogs (mean weight: 15 +/- 1 kg), anesthetized by chloralose (8 cg/kg) and in spontaneous ventilation, the hemodynamic effects on systemic and pulmonary circulation of inhaled nitric oxide (12 ppm) were studied before and after acute sino-aortic denervation. The hemodynamic effects of intravenous propranolol (300 micrograms/kg) were studied after denervation. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), pulmonary capillary pressure (PCP), mean arterial pulmonary pressure (MAPP), cardiac input (CI) and oxygen venous saturation (SvO2) were measured. [table: see text] Sino-aortic denervation causes an acute and transitory pulmonary hypertension due to a double mechanism: a post-capillary hypertension (increase PCP) secondary to an increase left ventricular post-charge by systemic hypertension and a precapillary hypertension. In fact, vascular pulmonary resistances increase from 1.8 +/- 0.1 to 3.4 +/- 0.8 uW after denervation (p < 0.05). Change in pulmonary vascular reactivity induced by catecholamines is probably involved. Propranolol but not inhaled nitric oxide reverse pulmonary hypertension due to sino-aortic denervation.", 
    "19": "Spectral analysis was recently chosen to characterize the fast oscillations depending on the autonomic nervous system. Humoral stimuli could impinge on low frequency (LF) domain of blood pressure (BP) since the time lag to humoral systems activation is larger. This study was designed to analyse LF components of short-term variability of BP of conscious rats in conditions where humoral systems were activated. We studied rats with two-kidney Goldblatt hypertension in which the BP level was dependent upon the renin-angiotensin and kallikrein-kinin systems. Spectral powers of the systolic and diastolic BP and heart rate (HR) were computed in the high (respiratory, HF), mid (0.2-0.6 Hz, MF) and low (0.02-0.2 Hz, LF) frequency bands, as detected by the Fast Fourier Transform technique on consecutive 102-s stationary periods. Renal hypertension by a two-kidney one clip procedure was associated with a marked rise in SBP (+47 mmHg) and no significant change in HR. Renal hypertension selectively increased the LF component of SBP (+86%) when hypertensive rats were compared to sham operated animals. First, administration of losartan, a selective nonpeptide angiotensin II receptor antagonist, to sham rats resulted in a moderate SBP decrease, a significant tachycardia (+47 batt/min) with no change in BP and HR spectra profiles. Losartan determined in the hypertensive group a marked fall in SBP (-25 mmHg) with a significant tachycardia (+50 batt/min). Interestingly, losartan reduced the LF component of SBP (-26%). In a second series of normotensive and hypertensive rats, Hoe 140, a bradykinin B-2 receptor antagonist, did not affect the BP and HR levels of the two groups of rats. Hoe 140 decreased the LF component of SBP variability (-28%). Losartan, added after Hoe 140, decreased the BP (-17 mmHg) in association with a tachycardia (+59 batt/min) and induced a supplementary decrease of the LF component of SBP variability (-60%) in hypertensive rats. After the combined blockade, the LF component of SBP of the hypertensive rats was equivalent to that of the sham rats. Thus, an increase in the LF component of BP variability was observed in a model of hypertension where the BP is dependent upon humoral factors. The contribution of the renin-angiotensin and kallikrein-kinin systems in the slow fluctuations of BP was demonstrated using two specific antagonists losartan and Hoe 140.",

To investigate the effect of bisoprolol (B) and ramipril (R) treatment (TT) on the short-term variability of systolic blood pressure (SBP) diastolic blood pressure (DPB) and heart rate (HR) reactivity during mental stress, we studied 54 mild essential untreated hypertensive patients (24 men, 45 +/- 9.6 years, BP > 160/90 mmHg after a 15-days placebo run-in period) who were randomly assigned to double blind treatment (B: 10 mg/day: n = 28 and R: 5 mg/day: n = 26). A Stroop Word Color Conflict Test (SWCCT) was performed before and after 2 months of treatment. Hemodynamic parameters (BP and HR) were measured by a non invasive device (Finapres 2300E, Ohmeda-Maurepas) and underwent spectral analysis (SBP: mmHg.Hz-1/2, HR: beats/min.Hz-1/2, Anapres 1.2, Notocord-Orgametrie Systems, Igny-Lille) at rest and during SWCCT.

    "23": "1. Effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) on neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor channels were investigated by expressing cloned channel subunits in Xenopus oocytes. 2. When channels were expressed with a combination of alpha 3 and beta 4 subunits, 5-HT (10 to 300 microM) reversibly inhibited an inward current activated by 100 microM ACh in a concentration-dependent manner. The inhibition was also observed when alpha 3 subunit was combined with beta 2 subunit instead of beta 4 subunit, or beta 4 subunit was combined with alpha 2 or alpha 4-1 subunit instead of alpha 3 subunit to express channels. 3. Compounds known to antagonize at 5-HT receptors (LY53857, metoclopramide and propranolol) exhibited an agonistic effect: they inhibited the ACh-activated current. 4. The results suggest that 5-HT inhibits recombinant neuronal nicotinic receptor channels through a binding-site distinct from conventional 5-HT receptors. The binding-site may not be attributed to a unique type of channel subunits.", 
    "24": "This study was designed to determine if tonic beta-adrenergic control of plasma renin activity (PRA) during dietary sodium restriction is due to stimulation of renal beta-adrenoceptors, extrarenal beta-adrenoceptors, or both. Experiments were performed in six conscious resting uninephrectomized dogs with chronically indwelling catheters in the aorta, vena cava, and remaining renal artery. The dogs were fed a low-sodium diet of approximately 7 mequiv. Na/day. PRA decreased by 28 +/- 4% of control (p < 0.01) when the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol was infused directly into the renal artery (ira) at a rate of 0.25 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 for 45 min, whereas iv propranolol infusion at the same rate had no effect on PRA. Propranolol infusion, 1 microgram.kg-1.min-1 iv, decreased PRA by 22 +/- 8% of control (p < 0.05) and produced significantly greater systemic beta-adrenoceptor blockade but a similar renal plasma propranolol concentration as with ira infusion, 0.25 micrograms.kg-1.min-1. Thus blockade of extrarenal beta-adrenoceptors produced no additional suppression of PRA beyond that which could be accounted for by blockade of renal beta-adrenoceptors. Therefore, suppression of PRA by propranolol is due solely to blockade of renal beta-adrenergic receptors in conscious sodium-deprived dogs.",

Propranolol was administered orally (females, 60 mg, 1.12 mg.kg-1; males, 80 mg, 0.96 mg.kg-1) to block nonshivering thermogenesis. Measurements were taken at both 25 degrees C, 13.1 Torr (water vapor pressure; 1 Torr = 133.3 Pa) and 5 degrees C, 3.6 Torr, with sessions randomly assigned to be drug-neutral (DN), drug-cold (DC), placebo-neutral (PN), and placebo-cold (PC). Body core temperature was not different between any of the experimental conditions. Mean body temperature (5 degrees C, 32.2 +/- 0.20 degrees C (+/- SEM); 25 degrees C, 35.3 +/- 0.20 degrees C) and mean skin temperature (5 degrees C, 22.4 +/- 0.70 degrees C; 25 degrees C, 31.4 +/- 0.60 degrees C) were lower (p < 0.05) in the 5 degrees C than 25 degrees C environment (rest, exercise, drug (D), placebo (P), combined); while shivering (EMG) was higher (16.5 +/- 3.9% above baseline) at 5 degrees C than 25 degrees C (15 +/- 2.1% below baseline) (p < 0.05). The greater VO2 in 5 degrees C compared with 25 degrees C for the same condition is the thermoregulatory VO2 (TVO2). TVO2 (mL.min-1) was lower (p < 0.05) on the D (mean = 189.5 +/- 17.7) than on the P (mean = 238.1 +/- 20.2) during rest and during exercise (D, 206.1 +/- 63.7; P, 338.4 +/- 46.7). The EMG was 21% above baseline in the DC, and 12% above baseline for PC (p > 0.05).

    "26": "1. Effects of KC399, an opener of ATP-sensitive K+ channels were investigated on membrane potential, isometric force and intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) mobilization induced by acetylcholine (ACh) in smooth muscle from the rabbit trachea. 2. In these smooth muscle cells, ACh (0.1 and 1 microM) depolarized the membrane in a concentration-dependent manner, KC399 (1-100 nM) hyperpolarized the membrane whether in the presence or absence of ACh. When the concentration of ACh was increased, the absolute values of the membrane potential induced by the maximum concentration of KC399 were less negative. 3. ACh (0.1 to 10 microM) concentration-dependently produced a phasic, followed by a tonic increase in both [Ca2+]i and force. KC399 (above 3 nM) lowered the resting [Ca2+]i and attenuated the ACh-induced phasic and tonic increases in [Ca2+]i and force, in a concentration-dependent manner. The magnitude of the inhibition was greater for the ACh-induced tonic responses than for the phasic ones. Nicardipine (0.3 microM), a blocker of the L-type Ca2+ channel, attenuated the ACh-induced tonic, but not phasic, increases in [Ca2+]i and force. KC399 further attenuated the ACh-induced tonic responses in the presence of nicardipine. 4. In beta-escin-skinned strips, Ca2+ (0.3-10 microM) produced a contraction in a concentration-dependent manner. KC399 (0.1 microM) had no effect on the Ca(2+)-force relationship in the presence or absence of ATP with GTP. However, at a very high concentration (1 microM), this agent slightly shifted the relationship to the right and attenuated the maximum Ca(2+)-induced contraction. 5. We conclude that, in rabbit tracheal smooth muscle, the membrane hyperpolarization induced byKC399 attenuates the ACh-induced tonic increase in [Ca2+], through an inhibition of nicardipinesensitive and -insensitive Ca2+-influxes, thus causing an inhibition of the ACh-induced tonic contraction. The ACh-induced phasic increase in [Ca2+]i and force are also inhibited, but less effectively than the tonic ones, suggesting that the action of such K+ channel openers on agonist-induced responses may be slightly different in tracheal from vascular smooth muscle.",

The two groups were compared for cardiovascular risk factors, pre-admission and discharge drug treatment, in-hospital drug treatment, and complication and mortality rates. Hypertension was more prevalent in the diabetic (63%) than in the control (42%) group. When comparing drugs on admission to those at discharge, there was a significant increase in antiplatelet and nitrate usage in both groups (P < 0.001), in beta-blocker usage in the control group (P < 0.001) and in loop diuretic usage in the diabetic group (P < 0.001). The usage of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors was low: 16% of diabetic patients and 5% of controls at discharge. Thrombolytic therapy was used in 29 diabetics and 37 controls. There was a significantly higher complication rate in the diabetic group than in the control group (P < 0.006), the most common being congestive cardiac failure (59% vs 30%, P < 0.001). Four controls and 13 diabetic patients died; three of the latter had their diabetes diagnosed during the admission. This study did not clearly demonstrate any underlying risk factors or treatment variables to account for the increased morbidity or mortality in diabetic patients with acute myocardial infarct, when compared to a matched non-diabetic population. However, modest associations not detected by this relatively small study are still possible.", 
    "30": "Controversy surrounds the safety of digoxin use in patients recovering from acute myocardial infarction. Previous observations yielded contradictory conclusions. To determine whether digoxin therapy is associated with increased mortality in patients recovering from acute myocardial infarction, we analyzed data from 1731 survivors of acute myocardial infarction enrolled in the Secondary Prevention Reinfarction Israeli Nifedipine Trial (SPRINT), from which patients with severe heart failure were excluded. At the time of hospital discharge, 175 patients (10%) were taking digoxin. Mortality over 1 year after infarction was significantly higher in patients treated with digoxin than in patients who were not receiving digoxin [27 of 175 (15%) vs. 60 of 1556 (4%); p < 0.0001]. Digoxin administration was associated with increased mortality in several subsets of patients. Since patients treated with digoxin had baseline characteristics predictive of mortality more frequently than their counterparts, we adjusted for these differences. Multivariate analysis performed by the Cox proportional hazards model identified treatment with digoxin as an independent determinant associated with increased death during the first year after myocardial infarction [relative risk (RR) 2.8; 90% confidence interval (CI) 1.8-4.2]. Subgroup multivariate analysis indicated digoxin as an independent predictor of first year death in 464 patients who developed heart failure during their hospital stay (RR 2.3; 90% CI 1.3-4.0), as well as among 1267 patients who did not (RR 3.4; 90% CI 1.7-6.9). The present study suggests a significant excess mortality associated with digoxin therapy after myocardial infarction. The increased mortality risk may be related to unidentified variables associated with the severity of disease in patients treated with digoxin. However, our findings raise concern that the administration of digoxin may contribute to increased mortality in survivors of acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "31": "Apomorphine and mCPP induced yawning associated with penile erections in rats, whereas physostigmine induced only yawns. Apomorphine-induced yawning and penile erections were antagonized by low doses of raclopride, whereas physostigmine-induced yawning and mCPP-induced effects were only partly inhibited at high doses of raclopride. Scopolamine as well as clozapine antagonized yawning and penile erections induced by apomorphine, mCPP and physostigmine. Similarly, the 5-HT1A agonists 8-OH-DPAT and S 14506 inhibited yawning and penile erections induced by apomorphine, mCPP and physostigmine, and at similar doses induced lower lip retraction and hyperreactivity to handling. The beta/5-HT1A antagonist tertatolol reversed the inhibitory effects of 8-OH-DPAT and S 14506 on drug-induced yawning and penile erections and increased apomorphine- and physostigmine-induced yawn frequency but not penile erection frequency. Like tertatolol, propranolol increased apomorphine- and physostigmine-induced yawn frequency, whereas ICI 118551 increased only physostigmine-induced yawning. 8-OH-DPAT- and S 14506-induced lower lip retraction and hyperreactivity to handling were also significantly antagonized by tertatolol. Finally, p-chlorophenylalanine pretreatment produced about 95% depletion in 5-HT in hypothalamus, hippocampus, striatum and frontal cortex and modified neither the responses of the inducing drugs nor the inhibitory effects of 8-OH-DPAT and S 14506 on drug-induced yawning and penile erections.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "32": "This study used radioligand binding assay methods and pharmacological experiments to examine whether bopindolol, possessing a long-lasting action in addition to potent beta-adrenoceptor antagonistic effects, is a slowly dissociating antagonist. In addition, the slow dissociation of two of its metabolites, 18-502 (4-(3-tert-butylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy)-2-methyl indole) and 20-785 (4-(3-tert-butylaminopropoxy)-2-carboxyl indole), which have potent beta-blocking activities, was also assessed. The blockade of 3H-CGP12177 binding sites in rat heart and brain induced by pindolol was readily reversed by washing, whereas this inhibition by bopindolol and 18-502 was not easily reversed by washing. In addition, specific bindings of the hearts of the treatment animals with 20-785, atenolol, (+/-)propranolol, nadolol and celiprolol and of washout were 86.7, 78.8, 77.5, 82.3 and 79.9% of the control, respectively. These blockades by the treatment of each drug and washout in the brain were, however, lower than those in the hearts. On the other hand, when the left and right atria were pretreated with propranolol, bopindolol and 18-502, the inotropic and chronotropic actions of isoprenaline were inhibited by these drugs even though they were not present in the extracellular medium. Pretreatment with 20-785, atenolol and nadolol was readily reversed for both inotropic action and chronotropic rate, and inhibition by celiprolol and pindolol remained at 25% of the control at 240 min after treatment with these drugs. A good correlation between inhibitory binding percentage in the hearts and inhibitory inotropic or chronotropic actions were observed, although it was not observed in the brain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "33": "Alprenolol 4-hydroxylation and N-desisopropylation in liver microsomes from male Wistar rats were kinetically analyzed to be biphasic. In the 4-hydroxylation at a low substrate concentration (5 microM), significant strain [Wistar > Dark Agouti (DA)] and sex (male > female) differences were observed, and the differences decreased at a high substrate concentration (1 mM). In the N-desisopropylation, only a strain difference (Wistar > DA) was observed at the low substrate concentration. Cytochrome P450BTL (P450BTL, corresponding to CYP2D2) in a reconstituted system with 5 microM alprenolol had high 4-hydroxylase activity, which was about 10 times that of P450ml corresponding to CYP2C11, and N-desisopropylase activity at a similar extent to P450ml. The two microsomal activities at 5 microM alprenolol were efficiently decreased by antibodies against P450BTL and by sparteine, a typical substrate of the CYP2D subfamily. Polyclonal antibodies against P450ml and P450PB-1 (corresponding to CYP3A2) partially suppressed only N-desalkylation at 5 microM, whereas they reduced the two activities at 1 mM. P450ml showed a high N-desisopropylase activity at a substrate concentration of 1 mM, where the sex difference was not observed. Furthermore, P450PB-2 corresponding to CYP2C6, which is one of the major P450 isozymes in female rats, also had 4-hydroxylase and N-desalkylase activities. These results suggest that a CYP2D isozyme(s) is the primary enzyme in alprenolol 4-hydroxylation and N-desisopropylation in a lower substrate concentration range, and that the involvement of some male-specific P450 isozyme(s) other than CYP2C11 or CYP3A2 may cause the sex difference in the 4-hydroxylation. In a higher substrate concentration range, CYP2C11 is thought to play a major role particularly in N-desisopropylation in male rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "34": "The effect of bethanechol, neostigmine, metoclopramide, and propranolol on myoelectric activity of the ileum, cecum, and proximal loop of the ascending colon was determined in 6 healthy Jersey cows implanted with 8 pairs of bipolar electrodes. Assigned at random, each cow received each of 5 treatments in 3-day intervals. The treatments included bethanechol (0.07 mg/kg of body weight, SC), neostigmine (0.02 mg/kg, SC), metoclopramide (0.15 mg/kg, IM), DL-propranolol (0.2 mg/kg, IM), and 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl) solution (20 ml, SC). All drugs were administered during early phase I of the migrating myoelectric complex in the ileum. Myoelectric activity was recorded for 4 hours after treatment, and data were analyzed for each hour separately. Bethanechol and neostigmine significantly (P < 0.05) increased the number of cecocolic spikes per minute per electrode, duration of cecocolic spike activity (%), and number of cecocolic propagated spike sequences per 10 minutes, relative to NaCl, during 1 or more hours of the recording period. The effect of bethanechol was more pronounced on duration of spike activity and number of propagated spike sequences, whereas neostigmine mainly increased the number of (uncoordinated) spikes. Metoclopramide and propranolol had no significant effect on cecocolic myoelectric activity, relative to NaCl. It was concluded that bethanechol and, less likely, neostigmine at the dosage used in this study may be suitable for medical treatment of cecal dilatation in cattle in which hypomotility of the cecum and proximal loop of the ascending colon has to be reversed. The potential advantage of bethanechol vs neostigmine for medical treatment of cecal dilatation is worth further evaluation.", 
    "35": "More than 25 years of the use of systemic beta-blockers in cardiovascular pathologies, but also in various other indications, have yielded a number of reports suggesting that these drugs was linked with the development of clinical depression. Some retrospective studies have been carried out with positive results, but the rare longitudinal prospective studies have failed to confirm the association between beta-blockers use and depression. Clinical, methodological and pharmacological problems may explain these discrepancies and are of great interest.", 
    "36": "A study was conducted to characterize and compare the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of atenolol in young and elderly men. Six young (mean +/- SD, 25.0 +/- 3.0 years) and six elderly (63.0 +/- 3.2 years) healthy men took atenolol 100 mg orally once daily for 6 days. Heart rate response to submaximal exercise was measured at selected times for 48 hours, and plasma and urine samples were collected over the same time interval. The Sigmoid Emax model was fit to percent reductions in exercise heart rate and atenolol plasma concentrations. The younger men had significantly lower values for area under the steady-state plasma concentration-time curve and higher values for systemic clearance/F and renal clearance. EC50 values showed a trend toward greater sensitivity to the negative chronotropic effects of atenolol among the elderly men. Model-derived percent reductions in heart rate were greater at all concentrations among the elderly men. These data suggest that group differences in atenolol pharmacokinetics were likely a result of age-related decline in renal function, and that the elderly subjects were at least as sensitive as, and maybe even more sensitive than, the younger subjects to the negative chronotropic effects of atenolol.", 
    "37": "Hypertensive emergency is a condition in which there is elevation of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure with the presence of acute target organ disease. Hypertensive urgency is a condition where the blood pressure is elevated (diastolic > 120 mmHg) with the absence of acute target organ disease. Hypertensive emergencies are best managed with parenteral drugs and careful intraarterial blood pressure monitoring. Hydralazine has been widely used in treatment of hypertension in eclampsia and preeclampsia, and its safety has been demonstrated in these patients. Sodium nitroprusside (SNP) has the most reliable antihypertensive activity, which begins immediately after its administration and ends when the infusion is stopped. As with diazoxide, it should be used with caution in patients with impaired cerebral flow. SNP is the preferred drug in obtaining controlled hypotension in patients undergoing neurovascular surgery. Intravenous nitroglycerin is useful in patients prone to myocardial ischemia, but should be avoided in patients with increased intracranial pressure. Esmolol is effective in controlling both supraventricular tachyarrhythmias and severe hypertension. Its short onset of duration of action make it useful in the emergent setting, but because of its negative inotropic effect its use should be avoided in patients with low cardiac output. Verapamil should not be used in patients with preexisting conduction abnormalities. Nicardipine is a potent arteriolar vasodilator without a significant direct depressant effect on myocardium. As with other afterload reducing agents, it should not be used in patients with severe aortic stenosis. Because angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors generally cause cerebral vasodilatation, enalaprilat may be particularly beneficial for patients who are at high risk of developing cerebral hypotensive episodes secondary to impaired cerebral circulation. Fenoldopam, a selective post-synaptic dopaminergic receptor (DA1) has been shown to be effective in treating severe hypertension with a lower incidence of side effects than SNP. Hypertensive urgencies can usually be managed with oral agents. Oral nifedipine, captopril, clonidine, labetalol, prazosin, and nimodipine have all been shown to be effective in these situations.",

Several human forms generated by different mRNA splicings can occur: the A form of 396 amino acids and the B and C forms extended by 12 and 6 amino acids respectively, in the C-terminus region. In order to characterize these different forms as expressed in CHO cells, we studied adenylyl cyclase stimulation by the beta 3 agonists, SR58611A and BRL37344 and its inhibition by the beta 3 antagonist SR59230.",

    "41": "The structure of the potassium channel blocker agitoxin 2 was solved by solution NMR methods. The structure consists of a triple-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet and a single helix covering one face of the beta-sheet. The cysteine side chains connecting the beta-sheet and the helix form the core of the molecule. One edge of the beta-sheet and the adjacent face of the helix form the interface with the Shaker K+ channel. The fold of agitoxin is homologous to the previously determined folds of scorpion venom toxins. However, agitoxin 2 differs significantly from the other channel blockers in the specificity of its interactions. This study was thus focused on a precise characterization of the surface residues at the face of the protein interacting with the Shaker K+ channel. The rigid toxin molecule can be used to estimate dimensions of the potassium channel. Surface-exposed residues, Arg24, Lys27, and Arg31 of the beta-sheet, have been identified from mutagenesis studies as functionally important for blocking the Shaker K+ channel. The sequential and spatial locations of Arg24 and Arg31 are not conserved among the homologous toxins. Knowledge on the details of the channel-binding sites of agitoxin 2 formed a basis for site-directed mutagenesis studies of the toxin and the K+ channel sequences. Observed interactions between mutated toxin and channel are being used to elucidate the channel structure and mechanisms of channel-toxin interactions.", 
    "42": "The effect of topical 2% carteolol on the tissue circulation in the albino rabbit optic nerve head (ONH) was studied using a laser speckle microcirculation analyser. In the first experiment, normalized blur (NB), the quantitative index of peripheral blood flow rate in the ONH, intraocular pressure (IOP), blood pressure (BP) and pulse rate (PR) were measured under general anesthesia before, and 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after a 20 microliters instillation of carteolol in one eye and a placebo in the other eye in a masked randomized manner. In the second experiment, one eye of another group of rabbits received carteolol twice daily for 20 days and the fellow eye a placebo in a randomized masked manner. The NB in the ONH and the IOP were measured before treatment and 2 hours after the last instillation on the 20th day. After a single instillation of carteolol, PR showed a maximum reduction of 14% and the IOP in the carteolol-treated eyes showed a maximum decrease of 22%, while NB in ONH and BP did not show any significant change during the experiment. After 20-day treatment, IOP showed a maximum decrease of 25% in the carteolol-treated eyes and 17% in the placebo-treated eyes. The NB showed a significant increase of 16% (p < 0.01) in the carteolol-treated eyes and 10% (p < 0.05) in the placebo-treated eyes. This indicates that long-term use of topical carteolol increases peripheral blood flow in ONH tissue in the living rabbit eye.", 
    "43": "The standard treatment of mild-to-moderate hypertension is monotherapy chosen from one of the five main classes of antihypertensives following the World Health Organisation and Joint National Committee guidelines. If first-line monotherapy fails, the physician must decide whether to increase the dose, choose a drug from a different class or add a second antihypertensive. However, greater efficacy must not be obtained at the cost of an unacceptable increase in side-effects. Sequential monotherapy is partly based on the impossibility of predicting the blood pressure response to a given antihypertensive. The validity of this strategy is supported by the findings of the Materson study, which suggest combination therapy only after the failure of at least two monotherapies. The aim of combination therapy is to optimize treatment by using two different classes of antihypertensives with synergistic effects. The anticipated advantages are ease of use, the enhancement or addition of the antihypertensive effects, and the possibility of administration to a wide population. This has led to the development of fixed combinations which are low-dosed to reduce the incidence of side-effects. Validated combinations (dosed differently according to the medicinal product) include: beta-blocker + diuretic, beta-blocker + dihydropyridine (DHP) calcium antagonist, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor + diuretic and in the future, ACE-inhibitor + calcium antagonist. The pharmacokinetic interaction of beta-blocker + DHP at the hepatic level must be considered to assess the efficacy of this combination.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "44": "The main goal of combination therapy in current antihypertensive treatment strategy is to achieve an additive or hopefully synergistic effect at a lower dose, hence with fewer side-effects. In reality, no one antihypertensive has a monolithic action profile: the therapeutic effect is the combined result of one or several individual effects, and the consequence of one of several adaptive mechanisms involved in physiological regulation. The action profiles of beta-adrenergic receptor blockers and converting enzyme inhibitors provide a good example of this complexity. The strategy for therapeutic use of an antihypertensive, including possible combination with another drug, thus depends on the level of impairment in the target structure (beta-adrenergic receptor, converting enzyme, calcium channel etc.), modulation of other target structures by the drug, and on the amplitude of counter-regulatory mechanisms that may be brought into play, whether directly or indirectly. The latter have greatest impact on the long-term outcome of antihypertensive treatment, in terms of myocardial hypertrophy, vascular remodeling, and atherosclerosis. Despite the multiple pharmacological and pharmacokinetic interactions leading to the development of increasingly sophisticated activity profiles and despite the use of increasingly focussed combination therapies, we must not forget that the role of many potential pharmacological targets still awaits investigation.", 
    "45": "Several different strategies may underlie the development of combination products for the treatment of hypertension or other disease states. Some of these approaches may be more rational and justifiable than others. Amongst those which can clearly be justified are: (1) improved convenience (and compliance) in patients with an established need for two separate treatments; (2) increased efficacy over monotherapy; (3) reduced side-effects over monotherapy; (4) increased efficacy and reduced side-effects. As far as relevant pharmacokinetic issues are concerned, it is advisable to avoid pharmacokinetic interactions between the two components based on either induction or inhibition of drug metabolism or modification of protein binding as these will add unpredictable variability to the response to the drugs. Compatible if not similar pharmacokinetics are only of relevance if there is a close correlation between plasma concentration and effect for both components independently. Of more importance are dynamic issues, including the mechanism of action. It is preferable to use drugs with differing complementary mechanisms rather than identical mechanisms. It is not essential that the drugs have a similar duration of effect but the dose frequency will be determined by the drug with the shortest duration of effect. These principles provide a sound basis for the development of combination regimens in hypertension including an ACE-inhibitor with a thiazide diuretic and also the combination of a beta-blocker with a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist. The combinations have been established to have a role in the management of hypertension.", 
    "46": "Losartan potassium (losartan) is the first of a new class of antihypertensive agents that specifically blocks the type 1 angiotensin II receptor. The efficacy and safety of losartan have been assessed in double-blind, controlled clinical trials conducted in approximately 3700 patients with uncomplicated mild, moderate and severe essential hypertension. Overall, losartan, whether administered alone or in combination with a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), was effective and well-tolerated in these clinical trials, with an incidence of adverse experiences similar to that of placebo. The antihypertensive effects of losartan 50 mg once daily were similar to those of 20 mg once daily of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril. The antihypertensive effects of losartan 50 to 100 mg once daily were similar to those of the calcium channel blocker felodipine 5 to 10 mg and to those of the beta-adrenergic blocker atenolol 50 to 100 mg once daily. Losartan was shown to have a smooth antihypertensive profile throughout the 24 h period following dosing, which mirrors the diurnal variability of blood pressure. The addition of 12.5 mg HCTZ to 50 mg losartan produced an additional significant antihypertensive response. There were no clinically meaningful differences in the antihypertensive effect of losartan when assessed by demographic subgroups of age or sex; there is a smaller antihypertensive response in Black patients. The most common patient-reported, drug-related, clinical adverse experience, with an incidence greater than that of placebo, was dizziness (2.4% versus 1.3%). The overall rate of patient withdrawal from losartan therapy due to clinical adverse experiences was lower than that of placebo (2.3% versus 3.7%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "47": "Chronic infusion of isoproterenol (Iso) in rats results in cardiac hypertrophy via incompletely understood mechanisms. Our purpose was to determine whether Iso infusion would alter the expression of genes associated with hypertrophy. Male Wistar rats received either 2.4 mg Iso.kg-1.day-1, 9.9 mg propranolol (Prop).kg-1.day-1, both Iso and Prop, or vehicle (NaCl) via subcutaneously implanted osmotic pumps. In Iso-treated rats, the ventricular weight-to-body weight ratio was increased by 27% after 1 day and peaked on day 3 (+ 40%). Levels of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and fibronectin (FN) mRNA in the left ventricles were elevated 20-fold and 13-fold in Iso-treated rats, respectively, peaking at 3 days of infusion. The increase in FN mRNA accumulation was at least partially accounted for by elevated expression of extra type IIIA and IIIB (EIIIA and EIIIB) splicing variants. Levels of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1 mRNA were elevated twofold after 3 days of Iso infusion. The abundance of skeletal alpha-actin (SK) mRNA increased fourfold after 1 day of Iso and declined thereafter. Iso infusion decreased sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) and preproenkephalin (PNK) gene expression by approximately 50% and induced a myosin heavy chain (MHC) isogene switch favoring beta-MHC. Prop partially inhibited the Iso-evoked increases in ANF and FN mRNA, completely prevented the Iso-induced changes in TGF-beta 1 and SERCA mRNA, but had no effect on the Iso-stimulated changes in SK and PNK gene expression. These results demonstrate that chronic Iso infusion elicits alterations in cardiac gene expression that are consistent with the development of myocyte hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis and are directionally identical to those previously reported for pressure overload hypertrophy.", 
    "48": "We examined the effect of polycations, classes of which are released by activated leukocytes, on the transport properties of the alveolar epithelium in isolated-perfused rat lungs. Protamine, polylysines, and ruthenium red produced rapid, dose-dependent increases in mannitol permeability (PAmann) when instilled into airspaces. The coupling between active transepithelial Na+ transport and alveolar fluid absorption was not altered, despite > 10-fold increases in PAmann. The increase in albumin permeability compared with that in mannitol suggested preservation of alveolar barrier-size selectivity. Tracheal instillation of protamine produced no cellular abnormality, whereas its addition to the perfusate resulted in damage to endothelial and type I cells. Protamine produced an even larger (P < 0.05) increase in PAmann in the presence of isoproterenol or dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate + 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine. The stimulation of Na+ and fluid transport by these agents was unaffected by protamine. Mastoparan, a peptide that activates G proteins, produced effects comparable to those of the polycations. The protamine- and mastoparan-induced increase in PAmann was abolished by barium, a K+ channel blocker, but not by zinc, a membrane-protective cation. Other K+ channel blockers, tetraethylammonium and quinine, had no effect. Thus short-term apical application of polycations and mastoparan alter alveolar epithelium paracellular permeability by a noncytotoxic mechanism that is inhibited by barium. The resulting increase in paracellular permeability does not alter fluid absorption driven by active Na+ transport. Polycations have very different effects, depending on whether they are present on one side or the other side of the alveolar capillary barrier.", 
    "49": "Many agonist ligands are known experimentally to display a range of efficacies and potencies in different tissues and preparations. To analyze the role of the levels of receptor expression and availability in the intrinsic activities and potencies of agonists, the function of a number of beta-adrenoceptor ligands was examined in clones of neuroblastoma x glioma hybrid NG108-15 cells transfected to express differing levels of the human beta 2-adrenoceptor, as well as after treatment of these cell lines with the irreversible beta-adrenoceptor antagonist bromoacetyl alprenolol menthane (BAAM). Clone beta N22 expressed approximately 10-fold higher levels of the receptor than did clone beta N17. In measurements of agonist stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity in membranes of these cells or agonist stimulation of the formation of the complex of Gs alpha and adenylyl cyclase, which acts as the high affinity binding site for [3H]forskolin in whole cells, a series of beta-adrenoceptor agonists, including dichloroisoprenaline, ephedrine, dobutamine, and salbutamol, displayed higher intrinsic activity and showed concentration-response curves that were substantially to the left (lower EC50 values) in clone beta N22, compared with clone beta N17. Treatment of clone beta N22 cells with varying concentrations of BAAM reduced the intrinsic activity of these ligands and shifted the concentration-response curves for these agents to the right. In clone beta N22 cells and membranes, reduction in the observed intrinsic activity for ephedrine required elimination of a smaller fraction of the beta 2-adrenoceptor reserve than for salbutamol and reduction in the effect of the full agonists isoprenaline and epinephrine was noted only with high fractional elimination of the receptor pool. The effect of isoprenaline was substantially reduced, however, by BAAM treatment of clone beta N17 cells, where the beta 2-adrenoceptor number approached extremely low levels. Analysis of the data using the formalisms of Whaley et al. [Mol. Pharmacol. 45:481-489 (1994)] showed that prediction of alterations in agonist potency with receptor number for full agonists can be adequately extended to partial agonists.",

Asthma therapy should commence immediately with inhaled beta 2 agonist and systemic or ingested corticosteroid; inhaled anticholinergic is added initially or as early second-line treatment. Supportive treatment includes oxygenation, fluid-electrolyte balance, and nonpharmacologic relief of anxiety. When necessary, mechanical ventilation allowing \"permissive hypercapnia\" using low peak airway pressure (low volume and slow inspiratory flow rate) reduces the risk of barotrauma; the PaO2 and pH are maintained while allowing PaCO2 to rise. Early recognition and treatment of complications, especially pneumothorax, can be life-saving. Identification of precipitating factor(s) occasionally dictates initial therapy (anticholinergic for beta blocker-induced bronchospasm, epinephrine for asthma accompanying a systemic allergic reaction), but is most important as the first step to preventing future episodes.

In the present study, we pharmacologically analyzed the role of noradrenergic systems on the sympathetic and somatic pathways to the lower urinary tract and asked: 1) Are alpha-1, alpha-2, or beta-adrenergic receptors tonically active along sympathetic and/or somatic reflex pathways? And 2) what is the net effect of increasing the extracellular levels of NE by administration of a NE reuptake inhibitor? To address these questions, we recorded evoked potentials from the central ends of the hypogastric and pudendal nerves in response to electrical stimulation of the pelvic and pudendal nerves in chloralose-anesthetized cats, and the effects of prazosin (1-300 micrograms/kg i.v.), an alpha-1-adrenergic receptor antagonist; idazoxan (1-300 micrograms/kg i.v.), an alpha-2-adrenergic receptor antagonist; propranolol (1 mg/kg i.v.), a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist; and tomoxetine (0.003-3 mg/kg i.v.), a selective NE reuptake inhibitor, were examined. The results indicate that facilitatory alpha-1-adrenergic receptors are tonically active along both sympathetic and somatic reflex pathways, whereas inhibitory alpha-2-adrenergic receptors are not tonically active. The net effect of acute inhibition of NE reuptake along sympathetic reflex pathways is increased activation of inhibitory alpha-2-adrenergic receptors. Along somatic reflex pathways, increased activation of both facilitatory alpha-1- and inhibitory alpha-2-adrenergic receptors were recorded after acute NE reuptake inhibition.

    "77": "To study prognostic factors in patients with sustained ventricular tachycardias (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) complicated by left ventricular dysfunction, we evaluated the predictive value of demographic, clinical, and hemodynamic parameters for cardiac mortality and sudden cardiac death in 85 patients with VT or VF and left ventricular ejection fraction < 0.45 (mean 0.27 +/- 0.10). Patients underwent serial drug testing and received appropriate antiarrhythmic treatment, with amiodarone given as last-resort therapy. During a follow-up of 24 +/- 13 months, 23 patients died of cardiac causes, and 18 of them died suddenly. Left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 0.27 and amiodarone treatment were related to greater cardiac mortality and increased risk of sudden cardiac death, whereas beta-blockade was associated with improved survival. In the multivariate model cardiac mortality was best predicted by a left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 0.27, and absence of beta-blockade and severe left ventricular dysfunction were the strongest predictors of sudden cardiac death. We conclude that severe left ventricular dysfunction predicts increased cardiac mortality and high risk of sudden cardiac death. Moreover, beta-blocking treatment is associated with lower cardiac mortality and a reduced risk of sudden cardiac death in patients with sustained VT or VF and depressed left ventricular function. beta-Blocking agents may therefore be an important addition to conventional antiarrhythmic treatment in patients with VT or VF and left ventricular dysfunction.",

Theoretically, concurrent beta-adrenergic receptor blockade might alter this effectiveness, but clinical experience has been variable. Before assessing the relative effectiveness and implications of dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) to detect myocardial ischemia in the presence of beta-blockade the physiologic and hemodynamic effects of dobutamine with simultaneous beta-blockade must be understood in a controlled setting. Therefore the purpose of this study was to determine if beta-blocking agents alter the timing and magnitude of the physiologic response to graded doses of dobutamine during a standard DSE. Paired DSEs were performed in seven instrumented open-chest dogs with and without beta-blockade (esmolol 500 micrograms/kg initial bolus and 100 micrograms/kg/min infusion). Heart rate, systolic pressure, proximal left anterior descending coronary artery flow, myocardial thickening, and percentage left ventricular area change (% AC) were monitored. The data for each parameter were fit to linear or exponential functions.

    "80": "The incidence and vascular type of recurrent ischaemic stroke was studied in patients with supratentorial transient ischaemic attacks or non-disabling ischaemic strokes, who were treated with aspirin (30 or 283 mg). Patients were divided into groups with small vessel disease (SVD) (n = 1216) or large vessel disease (LVD) (n = 1221) on the grounds of their clinical features and CT at baseline. Patients with evidence of both SVD and LVD (n = 180) were excluded from further analyses. During follow up (mean 2.6 years) annual stroke rate was 3.6% in both groups. Of the 107 patients with SVD at baseline who had recurrent strokes, 83 proved to have an identifiable infarct: 30 (28%) again had a small vessel infarct, 39 (36%) had a large vessel ischaemic stroke and in 14 (13%) the recurrent ischaemic stroke was in the posterior fossa. Of the 110 patients with LVD at baseline and recurrent stroke, 91 had an identifiable infarct: 67 (61%) again had a large vessel ischaemic stroke, 16 (15%) had a small vessel ischaemic stroke, and eight (7%) had the recurrent ischaemic stroke in the posterior fossa. Thus patients with a transient ischaemic attack or non-disabling ischaemic stroke caused by LVD were more likely to have an ischaemic stroke of the same vessel type during follow up than patients with SVD (relative risk 2.2; 95% confidence interval 1.5-3.4). Possible explanations for this difference are: (1) patients with a small vessel ischaemic stroke at baseline had both SVD and LVD or were misdiagnosed; (2) recurrent small vessel ischaemic stroke may have occurred more often than reported, because they were silent or only minimally disabling; (3) recurring large vessel ischaemic strokes occurring in patients initially diagnosed as having SVD might have been related to potential cardiac sources of emboli that had not been previously recognized; (4) the antiplatelet drug aspirin (30 or 283 mg) prescribed in this patient group may have prevented thrombosis in small vessels better than in large vessels.", 
    "81": "Brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis is activated by the sympathetic nervous system. BAT responses to norepinephrine are blunted in hypothyroidism and are rapidly restored by thyroid hormone. We examined in rats the effects of thyroid hormone on BAT beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors (AR) expression and capacity to generate cAMP in response to adrenergic stimulation. Both are reduced in hypothyroidism. The reduction in cAMP generation is equal to or greater than that in beta 1,2-AR; it is the same whether cAMP production is stimulated with norepinephrine, selective beta 3-AR agonists, or forskolin; and it is not affected by the inhibition of phosphodiesterase. Both beta 1,2-AR and the capacity to generate cAMP were slowly corrected by thyroid hormone. T3 normalized beta 1,2-AR between 1 and 2 days, whereas the improvement in cAMP generation lagged 1 or 2 days behind. Within 2 days of acclimation of athyreotic rats at 30 C, the number of beta 1,2-AR reached the euthyroid level, whereas exposure to 4 C decreased these receptors. We reached the following conclusions: 1) BAT beta 1,2-AR and capacity to generate cAMP are reduced in hypothyroidism; 2) the latter, however, is not explained by the reduction in beta 1,2-AR, but, rather, reflects a fault at the postreceptor level; 3) the reduction in beta 1.2-AR number is largely caused by the cold stress derived from the low metabolic rate of the hypothyroid state; and 4) the slow restoration of both receptor number and capacity to generate cAMP after T3 are not consistent with these defects being a significant factor in the previously reported blunted uncoupling protein responses to adrenergic stimulation in hypothyroidism.", 
    "82": "Nitric oxide (NO) may be a mediator of beta-cell damage in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. beta-Cells express the inducible form of NO synthase (iNOS) and produce large amounts of NO upon exposure to cytokines. iNOS requires the amino acid arginine for NO formation. It has been shown in other cell types that interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) and bacterial lipopolysaccharide induce the enzyme argininosuccinate synthetase (AS), enhancing the capacity of these cells to regenerate arginine from citrulline and maintain NO production in the presence of low arginine concentrations. To characterize the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of AS in insulin-producing cells, RINm5F cells (RIN cells) were exposed to interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) or to tumor necrosis factor-alpha plus IFN gamma. After 4-6 h, there was a significant and parallel induction of AS and iNOS mRNA. IL-1 beta-induced AS and iNOS mRNA expression was prevented by an inhibitor of the activation factor NF-kappa B pyrrolidine diaminoguanidine, an inhibitor of gene transcription (actinomycin D), and a blocker of protein synthesis (cycloheximide), suggesting coregulation of AS and iNOS by cytokines. RIN cells exposed to IL-1 beta in the presence of citrulline but the absence of arginine had increased AS enzyme activity and produced NO, demonstrating that cytokine-induced AS mRNA expression is accompanied by increased AS activity. Both adult rat islets exposed to IL-1 beta and human pancreatic islets cultured in the presence of IL-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and IFN gamma were able to use citrulline to regenerate arginine and produce NO. Taken as a whole, the present data suggest that regulation of AS activity may play a role in modulation of NO production in both rodent and human insulin-producing cells.", 
    "83": "Initial, but not subsequent, inhalation of 8% desflurane produces transient sympathetic stimulation. We hypothesized that initial but not subsequent increases should produce pupil dilation, and that N2O, fentanyl, and clonidine, but not esmolol, should blunt the response. In 10 volunteers, we maintained anesthesia with 4% end-tidal desflurane in oxygen for 32 min, then increased the concentration to 8% for 10 min. In nine of the volunteers, we twice repeated the increase to 8%, separating each increase by a 32-min period at 4%. On separate days, five volunteers received 4%-8% desflurane in 60% N2O; five received fentanyl 1.5 micrograms/kg or 4.5 micrograms/kg intravenously 5 min before 4%-8% desflurane; four received clonidine 4.3 micrograms/kg, orally, 90 min before 4% to 8%; and four received esmolol 0.75 mg/kg, intravenously, 1.5 min before 4%-8%. Without other drugs present, 4%-8% desflurane transiently increased pupil diameter to 5.4 +/- 0.5 mm (mean +/- SD), with subsequent 4%-8% increases producing attenuated responses (2.9 +/- 1.5 and 3.2 +/- 1.8 mm). N2O produced a higher peak (6.2 +/- 0.7 mm). Fentanyl 1.5 micrograms/kg and 4.5 micrograms/kg decreased peak diameter (2.3 +/- 0.9 and 1.6 +/- 0.3 mm), as did clonidine (2.3 +/- 1.7 mm) but not esmolol. We conclude that, concurrent with sympathetic stimulation, an initial rapid increase in desflurane concentration transiently increases pupil diameter, whereas repeated increases produce attenuated responses. N2O augments, fentanyl and clonidine attenuate, and esmolol does not affect the response.",

The half-time for the 14% decrease in HR (81 +/- 13 bpm to 70 +/- 9 bpm) was 1.2 min. MAP decreased by 26% (85 +/- 7 mm Hg to 63 +/- 6 mm Hg) with a 17.8 min half-time. This delay in MAP response may, in part, be related to the gradual 44% decline in PRA (9.5 +/- 4.5 ng.mL-1.h-1 to 5.3 +/- 2.5 ng.mL-1.h-1) occurring with a half-time of 11.9 min. The times to attainment of 90% maximum decreases were 4.8 +/- 3.0 min for HR, 42.5 +/- 8.9 min for MAP, and 32.1 +/- 15.0 min for PRA.

Bath application of isoproterenol (1 mumol/L, n = 11) or forskolin (1 mumol/L, n = 17) or the intracellular application of cAMP (1 mmol/L, n = 9) activated whole-cell Cl- currents recorded from single myocytes at 36 degrees C.

The results show that (1) the beta 3-AR is mainly responsible for AC activation in lean-mouse WAT; (2) the beta 3-AR is only partly responsible for AC activation in obese mouse WAT; and (3) GTP modulates beta 3--but not beta 1--or beta 2-AR activation of AC in a biphasic manner.

    "97": "Stimulation of phospholipase D activity is frequently observed during agonist activation of Ca(2+)-mobilizing receptors, but the cellular functions of this signaling pathway are not well defined. Pituitary gonadotrophs express Ca(2+)-mobilizing receptors for gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and endothelin (ET), activation of which stimulates luteinizing hormone secretion and transient expression of c-fos. In pituitary cells and alpha T3-1 gonadotrophs, GnRH action was associated with both initial and sustained diacylglycerol (DG) production, whereas ET-1 induced only a transient DG response. Also, phospholipase D activity, estimated by the production of phosphatidylethanol from phosphatidylcholine in the presence of ethanol, was stimulated by GnRH but not ET-1. Such formation of phosphatidylethanol at the expense of phosphatidic acid (PA) during GnRH-induced activation of phospholipase D significantly reduced the production of PA, DG, and cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol. Inhibition of PA-phosphohydrolase activity by propranolol also decreased GnRH-induced DG production and, in contrast to ethanol, increased PA and cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol levels. The fall in DG production caused by ethanol and propranolol was accompanied by inhibition of GnRH-induced c-fos expression, whereas agonist-induced luteinizing hormone release was not affected. In contrast to their inhibitory actions on GnRH-induced early gene expression, neither ethanol nor propranolol affected ET-1-induced c-fos expression, or GnRH- and ET-1-induced inositol trisphosphate/Ca2+ signaling. These findings demonstrate that phospholipase D participates in stimulus-transcription but not stimulus-secretion coupling, and indicate that DG is the primary signal for this action.",

Continuous thermodilution of blood was facilitated by computer modulation of a thermal filament wrapped around the portion of the pulmonary artery catheter residing in the right atrium and ventricle. QTDC was computed from the thermodilution curve monitored by the thermistor. Bolus thermodilution was performed in triplicate by injecting 10 mL of 5% dextrose in water (0 to 4 degrees C). Oxygen consumption (VO2) was calculated as the averaged minute rate of disappearance of spirometer oxygen over a 6-minute steady state. Cardiac output was determined with the direct Fick method (QF) by dividing VO2 by the difference in arterial and mixed venous oxygen content. Basal QTDC was increased and decreased with an intravenous infusion of dobutamine or labetalol, respectively. Data are summarized as mean +/- SD or 95% confidence interval (CI 95%).

Ciliary activation was observed after a 10-min exposure to 4.6 x 10(-6) mol/l ibudilast. Ibudilast dose-dependently increase CBF at the concentrations ranging from 4.6 x 10(-7) mol/l to 4.6 x 10(-5) mol/l. Propranolol inhibited ciliary activity induced by ibudilast; however, neither indometacin nor verapamil affected the activation of ibudilast on CBF. Platelet activating factor (PAF) and Leukotriene D4 (LTD4) are chemical mediators inducing mucosal dysfunction and damage. Ibudilast prevented ciliary inhibition induced by PAF and LTD4. These findings indicated that ibudilast activates CBF and inhibits the effect of PAF and LTD4 on ciliated cells, and consequently improves the pathogenesis of allergic disorders such as the inhibited mucociliary transport system and airway hyperresponsiveness.",

Drug action was evaluated in a concentration range of 10(-7) to 5 x 10(-4) mol/l. An increase of coronary flow caused by the O-glycosides luteolin-7-glucoside (186%), hyperoside (66%) and rutin (66%) as well as an increase of the relaxation velocity (positive lusitropism) by luteolin-7-glucoside (104%), hyperoside (62%) and rutin (73%) were the major effects observed at a maximum concentration of 0.5 mmol/l. Furthermore, slight positive inotropic effects and a rise in heart rate were seen. Similar but less intensive actions were found with the C-glycosides vitexin, vitexin-rhamnoside and monoacetyl-vitexin-rhamnoside. Possible beta-adrenergic activities of the flavonoids could be excluded by the addition of propranolol in fixed concentrations of 10(-8) to 10(-5) mol/l. Moreover, pretreatment of the animals with reserpine (7 mg/kg) did not influence myocardial activity of hyperoside (10(-4) mol/l). As previous experiments showed an inhibition of the 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate phosphodiesterase, the results suggest an inhibition of this enzyme as the possible underlying mechanism of cardiac action of flavonoids from Crataegus species.", 
    "108": "In order to clarify the interactions between monoaminergic and cholinergic systems in working and reference memory functions, the effects of administration of the alpha, beta-adrenergic, D1-, D2-dopaminergic or serotonergic receptor antagonist together with the muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine on this behavior were examined using a three-panel runway task. Both in working and reference memory tasks, the number of errors (attempts to pass through two incorrect panels of the three panel-gates at four choice points) was significantly increased by 0.32 mg/kg scopolamine, but not by the doses up to 0.18 mg/kg. The beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol at 10 mg/kg had no effect on the number of working memory errors. Combined administration of 10 mg/kg propranolol and scopolamine at 0.1 and 0.18 mg/kg significantly increased the number of working memory errors. However, in a reference memory task, propranolol at 10 mg/kg did not affect the number of errors, whether administered alone or together with 0.1 mg/kg scopolamine. Other monoaminergic receptor antagonists, including the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine (3.2 and 10 mg/kg), D1-antagonist SCH23390 (0.032 and 0.056 mg/kg). D2-antagonist sulpiride (100 mg/kg) and serotonin antagonist cinanserin (10 and 32 mg/kg) had no significant effect on working or reference memory errors, whether they were administered independently or in combination with scopolamine at 0.1 mg/kg. These results suggest that beta-adrenergic/muscarinic interactions play an important role in mediating processes involved in working memory performance of rats.",

The method is based on an HPLC separation using a Chiralpak AD column. High recovery rates (80-95%) were achieved by means of a liquid-liquid-extraction at pH 11 with dichloromethane as solvent. The separation on the chiral carrier were carried out with n-hexane/2-propanol; the addition of diethylamine is useful. The obtained capacity factors are k' = 2.36 for R-propafenone and k' = 3.82 for S-propafenone. R,S-propanolol and R,S-metoprolol were used as internal standards.

The true form of portal hypertension is considered to be congestive gastropathy from the points that PHG is observed in high frequencies in the high portal pressure group, the severe esophageal varices group and group without gastrorenal or splenorenal shunt, that the mucosal blood flow rate in the lesion increased and that venectasia is present in the submucosal layer.

    "111": "Catecholamines and prostaglandins are among the many diverse mediators which participate in an interactive communication between the nervous and immune systems. We have examined the response of murine peritoneal macrophages (M luminal diameter) to prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2) and the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol. In the present study we found a relationship between the response elicited by PGE2 and a beta-adrenergic agonist, which in a fashion similar to the response of PGE2 on M luminal diameters suppresses lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production. It has been established that exposure of M luminal diameters to PGE2 desensitizes the suppressive function of PGE2. In this study, prior exposure of M luminal diameters to a beta-adrenergic agonist and the effects on subsequent beta-adrenergic responses, as well as the relationship to PGE2 sensitivity was determined. Complete Freund's adjuvant-elicited M luminal diameters were incubated with or without either a beta-adrenergic agonist or antagonist. All groups of cells were then extensively washed, followed by incubation with LPS (100 ng/ml) with or without graded concentrations of PGE2 or the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol. Supernatants were collected to determine TNF concentrations by a fibroblast cytolytic assay, and Northern blot analysis was used to determine changes in the regulation of TNF mRNA accumulation. Both isoproterenol and PGE2 inhibited LPS-stimulated TNF release and TNF mRNA accumulation. We have established M luminal diameters regulation of sensitivity to isoproterenol-induced suppression of TNF production. The isoproterenol concentration-effect curve was shifted to the right after pre-exposure of M luminal diameter to the beta-agonist, suggesting a desensitized beta-adrenergic receptor population. Further studies demonstrated that M luminal diameters pre-exposed to the beta-adrenergic antagonist, ICI 118.551, washed, and then challenged with LPS show an increased sensitivity for isoproterenol-induced suppression of TNF production. In addition, a decreased sensitivity of M luminal diameters to exogenous PGE2 was observed during the desensitization to the beta-adrenergic agonist. Although concomitant addition of isoproterenol increased PGE2-induced suppression of LPS-stimulated TNF production, M luminal diameter pre-exposed to isoproterenol (10(-6) M) demonstrated a decreased sensitivity for PGE2-induced suppression of LPS-stimulated TNF production and TNF mRNA accumulation. Our results show that the effects observed after acute administration of a mediator may be different when M luminal diameters have been previously exposed to that or other mediators. These investigations support a role for mediators released from the nervous system to regulate the release of a cytokine needed to maintain inflammatory responses.", 
    "112": "Immune defence mechanisms can be modulated by brain function. To study such interactions, an in vitro method was developed to examine the release of cytokines and norepinephrine (NE) after electrical stimulation. Slices of mouse spleen were placed in chambers with a volume of 80 microliters and superfused with culture medium. To characterize electrically evoked NE release and cell viability a suitable stimulation protocol was developed using of [3H]NE. As parameter for immune function, modulation of interleukin-6 (IL-6) release by the spleen cells brought about by electrical stimulation was investigated. Splenic [3H]NE overflow was calcium-dependent, tetrodotoxin-sensitive and elicited by 54 mM potassium. Electrically evoked [3H]NE release at 22 h was about 80% of the release at 5.3 h. Electrical stimulation substantially reduced IL-6 secretion at 6 h (control: 143.4 +/- 14.3 vs. electrical: 71.3 +/- 7.9 pg/ml/10(6) leukocytes, P = 0.0001). This effect was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (P = 0.0298, EC50 approx. 10(-7) M). In conclusion, this new technique allows long-term investigation of cell function in slices of murine spleen. In addition, these are the first in vitro data indicating the presence of a functional neuroimmunological link in murine lymphoid tissue.",

A second objective was to compare the tolerability and the safety of these treatments. Timolol in Gelrite is a new topical formulation of timolol in an anionic heteropolysaccharide gellan gum. A total of 156 patients entered the study after an appropriate wash-out. The medication schedule included one drop of test drug in each eye at 9 a.m. (active drug for both groups) and 9 p.m. (placebo for the TG group, active drug for the TS group). At trough, the mean decrease from baseline intraocular pressure (after appropriate wash-out) ranged from 5.7 to 6.3 mmHg for the TG group and from 5.9 to 6.2 mmHg for the TS group. The difference between the treatment group means ranged from -0.4 to 0.4 mmHg. At peak, the mean decrease from baseline IOP ranged from 5.3 to 6.2 mmHg for TG group and from 5.1 to 6.1 mmHg for the TS group. The difference between the treatment group means ranged from -0.7 to 0.4 mmHg. The results of this study support the hypothesis of a comparable hypotensive effect at peak and trough of 0.25% timolol in Gelrite q.d. to 0.25% timolol solution b.i.d. Furthermore, timolol in Gelrite has an acceptable tolerability profile. The incidence of blurred vision was higher in the Gelrite group, but this different was not statistically significant.

Chronic kallikrein blockade significantly attenuated the postnatal induction of both serum ACE activity (-11% vs. controls) and kidney ACE activity and mRNA (-50% vs. controls). In addition, aprotinin attenuated the postnatal rise of ACE activity in the developing lungs. Kidney renin mRNA and ANG II contents were not altered by aprotinin. HOE-140 also attenuated the postnatal rise in kidney ACE mRNA (-25%) and activity (-40%) without affecting blood pressure.

    "122": "The relationship between solute distribution, physicochemical properties, and tissue physiology was determined by the impulse-response (IR) technique and statistical moment analysis in the isolated perfused rat hindlimb. The concentration of bovine serum albumin (BSA; 2, 4.7, and 7%, w/v), perfusate flow rate (4 and 8 mL/min), and solute physicochemical properties (lipophilicity, P, fraction unbound to protein, fu; fraction ionized, fi; and molecular weight MW) were varied to better understand the underlying determinants of solute distribution. An apparent low availability was found for a number of the solutes as a consequence of tissue sequestration. This low availability precludes the estimation of an apparent volume of distribution (V) for these solutes. The V of solute and tissue (skin, fat, and muscle) blood flow increased with perfusion flow rate (p < 0.01). The unbound distribution volume (Vu) of basic solutes was significantly linear with respect to P. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the distribution volume of solute in tissue was significantly related to fu (p < 0.01), but not improved by including relationships to P, MW, and fi. Data obtained with this IR technique yield results consistent with in vivo studies in terms of the importance of fu as a determinant of V. This work has shown that the estimations of solute V by the IR technique in a single-pass preparation are unreliable for solutes with a low availability due to apparent solute sequestration into tissue. The parameter V may also be affected by changes in the perfused limb physiology associated with the perfusion conditions used. The Vs for lidocaine and diazepam vary with fu in accordance with deductions based on the results of steady-state studies.",

A change in metabolic capacity or tissue uptake, induced by amino acids (AAs) released as a result of digestion of dietary protein, is a possible contributing mechanism to the food effect. This hypothesis was tested in isolated, perfused rat livers in the single-pass mode. Rac-PL (20 micrograms/ml) was infused to steady-state at 3 ml/min/g liver for 150 min. A balanced mixture of I-AA was coinfused from 70 to 110 min. The AA reversibly increased the steady-state concentration of PL by 18% and reduced steady-state concentrations of 4-hydroxypropranolol, N-deisopropylpranolol, PL glycol, naphthoxylactic acid, and naphthoxyacetic acid by an average of 41% and propanolol conjugates by almost 100%, indicating metabolic inhibition. In a second experiment, PL was coinfused with AAs from the beginning of the experiment, and tissue binding was compared with control livers. There was no significant effect of AAs on PL tissue binding. In a third study, the effect of four different concentrations of AAs coinfused from 70 to 110 min was assessed. The percentage change in PL and phase I metabolite levels was linearly correlated to the influent AA concentration. The large magnitude, reversibility, lack of pathway specificity, and concentration dependence of the AA interaction in the perfused liver are also features of food interaction in humans. These similarities constitute evidence that metabolic inhibition by AAs originating from dietary protein could contribute to the PL-food interaction.",

Trapping of dirithromycin within PMN granules (up to 80% at 30 min) was significantly more marked than the intracellular trapping of the other drugs (erythromycylamine, 45% +/- 5.1%; erythromycin, 42% +/- 3.7%; roxithromycin, 35% +/- 3.0%). A new finding was that, in the absence of extracellular calcium, the uptakes of all of the macrolides by PMNs and cytoplasts were significantly impaired, by about 50% (PMN) and 90% (cytoplasts). Furthermore, inorganic Ca2+ channel blockers inhibited macrolide uptake in a concentration-dependent manner, with 50% inhibitory concentrations of 1.6 to 2.0 mM and 29 to 35 microM, respectively, for Ni2+ and La3+. The intracellular distributions of the drugs were unchanged in the presence of Ni2+ and La3+ and in Ca(2+)-free medium supplemented with ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid. The organic Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine had no effect on macrolide uptake, whereas verapamil inhibited it in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. These data show the importance of extracellular Ca2+ in macrolide uptake by phagocytes and suggest a link with Ca2+ channels or a Ca2+ channel-operated mechanism.",

Both doses of esmolol prevented the prolongation of the QTc interval after thiopental and suxamethonium, but not after laryngoscopy and intubation. Alfentanil prevented the prolongation of the QTc interval following thiopental, suxamethonium and laryngoscopy but not after intubation. Esmolol did not prevent the increase in the heart rate and arterial pressure in response to laryngoscopy and intubation. No cardiovascular responses to laryngoscopy and intubation occurred in the patients treated with alfentanil.

We investigated the effects of spinal anesthesia on myocardial ischemia during coronary artery spasm in rats, and compared these with the effects of an alpha- and beta-adrenergic antagonist, and an alpha-adrenergic agonist. An intraaortic catheter was inserted via the right internal carotid artery so that the tip of the catheter was placed near the coronary ostium. An intrathecal catheter was placed at lumbar level. Coronary spasm was induced by the intraaortic injection of methacholine, and we identified the thresholds of myocardial ischemia, defined as the dose of methacholine that induced ST-segment elevation. Subsequently, the thresholds were determined after spinal anesthesia, and after the intraaortic injection of phentolamine and propranolol. The thresholds of myocardial ischemia increased significantly after intrathecal bupivacaine. In contrast, the threshold did not change after the injection of phentolamine. The thresholds increased significantly after the injection of propranolol. Methoxamine significantly decreased the threshold of ischemia. These results demonstrated that spinal anesthesia attenuated myocardial ischemia during methacholine-induced coronary spasm. This effect was equivalent to that of propranolol.",

IL-1 fragment peptide (163-171) had no effect on gastric ulcer formation in the experimental model, whereas sulfhydryl blocker N-ehtylmaleimide partially blocked the protective effect of IL-1 beta. The concentration of protein and noneprotein sulfhydryls in the gastric mucosa was significantly decreased 3 h after stress, and this decrease was partially prevented by IL-1 beta. IL-1 beta also decreased the concentration of molondialdehyde (MDA) in the gastric mucosa after 3 h stress. The results suggest that IL-1 beta could effectively lessen the degree of stress-induced gastric mucosal damage, due possibly to the production of endogenous sulfhydryl compounds in the gastric mucosa.", 
    "133": "Ovine fetal cerebral arteries exhibit an enhanced contractile response to norepinephrine (NE) compared with newborns and adults. It is possible that beta-adrenergic receptors and/or nitric oxide (NO), a putative endothelium-dependent relaxing factor, differentially modulate cerebrovascular responsiveness to NE as a function of development. The present study evaluated the effect of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol, and the NO synthase inhibitor, NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (LNAME), on the contractile response of isolated middle cerebral artery (MCA) and basilar artery (BA) to NE during fetal development. MCAs isolated from four preterm fetal lambs (105 d of gestation), seven near-term fetal lambs (125-130 d of gestation), and eight newborn lambs (2-7 d of age) were evaluated using organ baths. BAs isolated from the near-term fetal and newborn lambs were also evaluated. Contractile reactivity of MCAs to NE decreased significantly during fetal maturation as manifested by a marked decrease in Fmax (maximal relative contractile force generated) and an increase in EC50 (Fmax = 100 +/- 7, 41 +/- 7, and 28 +/- 8% of KCl contraction; EC50 = 0.14 +/- 0.03, 1.09 +/- 0.36, and 1.07 +/- 0.22 microM for preterm fetus, near-term fetus, and newborn lamb MCAs, respectively, p < or = 0.05). Propranolol treatment (10(-5) M) increased Fmax (2-fold) only for newborn lamb MCAs. Pretreatment with LNAME (10(-4) M) markedly enhanced the contractile response to NE (7-fold decrease in EC50 and 2-fold increase in Fmax, p < 0.05) for near-term fetus MCAs, whereas preterm fetus and newborn lamb MCAs were unaffected by the inhibitor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "134": "We have previously shown that the natriuretic response to DA-1 receptor agonist fenoldopam is markedly potentiated by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril. Since inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme can lead to decreased production of angiotensin-II and increased levels of kinins (e.g., bradykinin), it is likely that both of these mechanisms might be involved in this phenomenon. However, it is not known whether and to what degree the accumulation of kinins contributes to the overall potentiation of natriuretic response to fenoldopam seen during angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition. In the present study, we have examined the effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat and angiotensin-II receptor antagonist losartan as well as bradykinin-2 receptor antagonist HOE 140 on fenoldopam-induced natriuresis. Intravenous infusion of fenoldopam (1 microgram/kg/min) for 30 min produced significant increases in urine output and urinary sodium excretion without causing any changes in glomerular filtration rate, renal blood flow and mean arterial blood pressure, a phenomenon suggestive of a direct tubular site of action. In animals treated with either the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat or angiotensin-II receptor antagonist losartan, the diuretic and natriuretic effects of fenoldopam were potentiated to a similar degree. Whereas no significant changes in glomerular filtration rate occurred when fenoldopam alone was given to control rats, in animals treated with either enalaprilat or losartan, fenoldopam produced a modest but significant increase in glomerular filtration rate. In a separate group of animals, the effects of bradykinin-2 receptor antagonist HOE 140 on potentiation of fenoldopam-induced natriuresis by enalaprilat was examined.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "135": "The involvement of ganglionic muscarinic M1 receptors in vagally induced bronchoconstriction in guinea-pig airways is controversial. Therefore, we studied the effects of the M1-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist pirenzepine on vagus nerve (VNS, preganglionic) and electrical field stimulation (EFS, postganglionic)-induced contractions of the guinea-pig main bronchus under various experimental conditions. Using identical stimulation parameters for VNS and EFS (8V, 30 Hz, 0.5 ms, 5s every min), the amplitude of the VNS-induced twitch contractions was 30.4% of the EFS-induced responses, and pirenzepine showed 2.3-fold selectivity (pIC50-values 6.45 and 6.09, respectively) to inhibit vagally induced contractions. With the stimulation frequency for EFS lowered to match contraction levels obtained using VNS, pirenzepine was equipotent to inhibit both types of response at M3 receptor-selective concentrations, suggesting that M1 receptors are not involved. By contrast, when the stimulation episode was prolonged until plateau contraction (10-20 s), in the presence of the nicotinic antagonist hexamethonium (5 microM), the M2 receptor antagonist AQ-RA 741 (0.1 microM) and the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist timolol (1 microM), and again using matched VNS- and EFS-induced contraction levels, pirenzepine inhibited nerve stimulation-evoked responses in a biphasic manner, yielding pIC50-values of 8.12 (indicative of M1 receptor blockade) and 6.43 (indicative of M3 receptor blockade) for the first and second phase, respectively, while postganglionic stimulation showed a purely monophasic inhibition (pIC50 = 6.32). These results show that facilitatory muscarinic M1 receptors are involved in vagally mediated contraction of guinea-pig bronchi, under conditions of elevated neurotransmission and partial nicotinic receptor blockade.", 
    "136": "We evaluated the effects of enalapril [angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor] in comparison with atenolol (beta-blocker) on insulin sensitivity and serum lipoprotein concentration in obese hypertensive dyslipidemic patients. Twenty-eight hypertensive [mean blood pressure (MAP) 152 +/- 3/103 +/- 1 mm Hgl], obese [mean body mass index (BMI) 30 + 1 kg/m2A], dyslipidemic [total triglycerides 2.0 +/- 0.2 mM and/or high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol 1.1 +/- 0.1 mM and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol 4.5 +/- 0.2 mM] outpatients were randomized in two groups receiving enalapril or atenolol for 12 weeks, in an investigator-blinded, parallel, comparative two-center trial. Insulin sensitivity was assessed by a modified insulin suppression test. Blood pressure (BP), insulin sensitivity, and serum lipoprotein concentrations were compared before and after each treatment and between the two treated groups. BP decreased significantly and comparably during enalapril and atenolol treatment (p < or = 0.01). The sensitivity to insulin improved by 15% (p = 0.03) in the enalapril group and worsened by 17% (p < or = 0.01) in the atenolol group. Serum lipoprotein concentrations were not modified by any treatment. The improvement in insulin sensitivity caused by enalapril treatment appears to be an advantage as compared with atenolol treatment in hypertensive obese and dyslipidemic patients, whereas the BP-lowering efficacy of the two drugs is similar. Because this effect has been reported with other ACE inhibitors, it appears to be characteristic of the entire class of ACE inhibitors.", 
    "137": "The cardiovascular and electrophysiological effects of amiodarone resemble those of hypothyroidism. The drug has a structural resemblance to thyroid hormone (T3). Previous studies indicate that amiodarone exerts its major effect through antagonism of T3, probably as a result of inhibition of ligand binding to the thyroid hormone receptor (ThR). There are five subtypes of ThR, of which the beta 1 is the most prominent in the human heart. Our first aim was to investigate whether ThR is involved in a general antiarrhythmic mechanism for antiarrhythmic drugs or whether this action is specific for amiodarone. Therefore, we studied the affinity of one antiarrhythmic drug from every Vaughan-Williams group on T3 binding to human ThR beta 1 (hThR beta 1). Second, we wished to investigate whether amiodarone is a competitive or noncompetitive inhibitor. hThR beta 1, expressed in insect cells using a recombinant baculovirus, was used in regular binding competition assays. Disopyramide, lignocaine, propafenone, metoprolol, dl-sotalol, and verapamil had no effect on T3 binding to hThR beta 1. Amiodarone showed a noncompetitive binding pattern at low concentrations (0.25-2 microM) and a competitive binding at high concentrations (2-8 microM). Among the antiarrhythmics tested, only amiodarone had affinity for hThR beta 1. This may represent a novel type of antiarrhythmic mechanism. The finding that amiodarone, in concentrations corresponding to therapeutic range in plasma, shifts from a noncompetitive to a competitive inhibitor, is of clinical interest in comparisons of low- and high-dose treatment.", 
    "138": "1. Single ventricular myocytes were enzymatically isolated, incubated with the A1-purinergic and beta-adrenergic receptor-specific agonists N6-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA) and isoprenaline (Iso), and then rapidly skinned. Ca2+ sensitivity of isometric tension and unloaded shortening velocity (Vo) were measured, and protein kinase A (PKA)-specific phosphorylations of troponin I (TnI) and C-protein were assessed by back-phosphorylation of cell suspensions with [gamma-32P]-ATP. 2. Isoprenaline treatment decreased the Ca2+ sensitivity of isometric tension relative to propranolol-treated controls, as did simultaneous stimulation with Iso and CPA (Iso + CPA). CPA alone had no effect on Ca2+ sensitivity. Vo was greater in Iso-treated cells than in paired controls, while Vo was significantly less than control in both Iso + CPA-treated and CPA-treated cells. 3. Phosphorylation of TnI and C-protein was increased by Iso treatment and also when Iso and CPA were simultaneously applied. CPA alone caused a significant decrease in the phosphorylation state of these two proteins. 4. From these results we conclude that A1-purinergic receptor stimulation does not inhibit beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated phosphorylation of myofilament proteins, nor does it alter the Ca2+ sensitivity of isometric tension at the level of the myofilaments. However, A1-receptor stimulation does decrease Vo at the level of the myofilaments by a mechanism that is independent of beta-adrenergically mediated phosphorylation of TnI and C-protein."
