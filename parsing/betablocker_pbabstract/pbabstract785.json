The development of the rash and its reappearance after oral challenge were slow. But histological findings were almost identical and were not those of any other drug eruption. Vacuolated and dyskeratotic epidermal cells and mild disorganization with extra mitoses of the epidermal cells were seen.", 
    "1": "1 Labetalol, a beta- and alpha-adrenoreceptor-blocking drug, has been used in the treatment of hypertension in a total of 32 patients for over 4.5 yr, 14 patients for 3 yr or more. 2 Labetalol seems to have a similarly potency of methyldopa and the adrenergic neurone-blocking drugs. 3 Postural hypotension was only observed at doses over 2 g/d. It was the reason for stopping treatment in two patients. 4 Dosage varied; average 889 mg/d, range 75-3,200 mg. Tolerance did not develop. 5 Side-effects led to drug withdrawal in four patients", 
    "2": "Sensitized bovine granulocytes release histamine when exposed to specific antigen. In comparison with in vitro systems in several other species, the modulation of this release by adrenergic agents is unique. Beta-Adrenoceptor stimulation potentiates (rather than inhibits), whereas alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation inhibits (rather than potentiates) histamine release. Adrenaline, which is generally considered to be a physiological antagonist of the anaphylactic reaction, potentiated histamine release in this study. Dopamine, which is present in high concentration in bovine mast cells, was without effect. The results are discussed in terms of the possible role of granulocytes in bovine hypersensitivity.", 
    "3": "Among the increasing number of recent reports of the use of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs for a variety of psychiatric disorders is a series concluding that propranolol hydrochloride is efficacious in the treatment of opiate dependence. These reports were based on clinical observations of outpatient addicts in an uncontrolled situation. In order to validate these findings, we carried out a series of controlled, double-blind studies with hospitalized volunteers. The results of our studies do not confirm the previous reports. Propranolol neither relieved nor precipitated opiate withdrawal in subjects dependent either on dihydromorphinone hydrochloride or on heroin. It did not effectively block heroin-induced euphoria in dependent or nondependent subjects. In addition, there was no effect on the pattern of self-administration in opiate-dependent subjects, whether they were maintained on propranolol or placebo.", 
    "4": "The purpose of this study is to ascertain whether or not prostaglandin (PG) E2 induces LH release by modifying or mudulating the release or action of neural transmitters. PGE2 injected inv into spayed rats primed two days earlier with 10 mug estradiol benzoate increased the plasma levels of LH 10 min later as measured by radio-immunoassay. The peak of plasma LH was not changed by prior treatment with beta- or alpha-adrenergic receptor blockers, propranolol or phenoxybenzamine. The peak level of plasma LH did not alter in rats treated with DL-alpha-methyl-ptyrosine methyl ester HC1 (alpha-MPT) or sodium diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC). Similarly, the peak of plasma LH was not changed by prior treatment with imipramine. Adminisration of PGE2 produced an increase in anterior pituitary and plasma, but not hypothalamic cyclic AMP concomitantly with the elevation in plasma LH. Although it is possible that the effect of PGE2 could be mediated by another transmitter system, as yet unknown, or that the effect of PGE2 on LH release could be mediated via the adenylate cyclase-cyclic AMP system, the results indicate that PGE2 does not act trans-synaptically, but probably acts directly on LH-RH neurons.", 
    "5": "The effects of intravenous labetalol, a drug with both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor blocking actions, have been studied in 20 severely hypertensive patients. There was a prompt and sustained fall in arterial pressure; severe hypotension did not occur in recumbent patients but postural hypotension was common. Pulse rate was consistently reduced, but bradycardia was not a problem. Significant and correlated falls in plasma angiotensin II and aldosterone were seen. In a direct comparison with intravenous propranolol, labetalol was less effective in lowering plasma angiotensin II, but more effective in reducing blood pressure. Oral labetalol provided good control of blood pressure and other features in two patients with phaeochromocytoma. Intravenous labetalol was similarly effective in controlling a hypertensive crisis following clonidine withdrawal.", 
    "6": "Complications of hypertension are by far the greatese preventable public health problem in many of the developed countries of the world. Pharmacologic interventions which primarily involve drug interactions are the generally available and effective means of preventing or delaying these hypertensive complications. Mechanisms of beneficial antihypertensive drug interactions involve simultaneous reduction or control of blood volume (diuretic agents) and decrease of peripheral resistance. Reduction of peripheral resistance without producing intolerable side effects has recetnly been achieved by a complex drug interaction. This interaction involves simultaneous vasodilation and inhibition by beta-adrenergic blocking agents of reflex activation of the renin-angiotensin axis. Clonidine, by effects similar to propranolol, can substitute for propranolol in some patients, or add to the beneficial effects of this important drug interaction.", 
    "7": "A number of structurally dissimilar compounds, sharing the ability to induce vasodilatation have come into clinical usefulness as antihypertensive drugs. Their successful utilisation often depends critically on an appropriate combination with diuretics and beta-blockers. Beta-blockers can specifically inhibit the reflex cardiac stimulation which otherwise may limit the tolerability and haemodynamic value of these drugs. A synergistic antihypertensive effect has been demonstrated with hydrallazine and propranolol and possibly exists with other combinations. Generally, vasodilators are not first-line drugs in chronic therapy but are best added to beta-blockers. Variations of the dose-response and the time-course of effect are stressed as being important determinants of a successful interaction.", 
    "8": "The aliphatic partial structure common to the beta-receptor antagonists leads to similar products of their biotransformation. The main qualitative and quantitative differences of the metabolism of the compounds of this class, however, rest in the nature of their aromatic or heterocyclic substituents. The physico-chemical properties of the beta-blockers appear to be predominantly responsible for the extent of metabolic degradation and for the distribution in the body, especially for the binding to proteins. As a consequence of their different biological disposition the clinically relevant systemic bioavailabilities of the various beta-blockers from oral doses differ drastically. Practolol maintains an extreme position among all other compounds: It is most hydrophilic, it is not bound to proteins, it is metabolized least, but cleared renally in unchanged form to 85% of the dose. Despite its extremely high systemic bioavailability, relatively high daily doses were required for therapy. The receptor sensitivity for practolol has been rated 2 to 3 powers of 1- lower than of propranolol. Comparative pharmacokinetic assessment of beta-receptor antagonists requires quantitative analytical data in clinically representative groups of patients. This has been demonstrated by respective studies with oxprenolol. The intra- and inter-individual systemic bioavailability, the differential analysis of plasma and erythrocytes, the multiexponential elimination kinetics, and their possible dependence on the dose have been studied as clinically relevant pharmacokinetic characteristics. The continuing attempt of the pharmaceutical industry to optimize the properties of beta-blockers also has taken advantage of the slow release principle in oral dosage forms as shown by the example of oxprenolol. The beta-receptor antagonists belong to one of the youngest classes of pharmaceuticals. Pharmacokinetic and metabolic data for the different representatives of this class have been generated in different laboratories with different approaches and different techniques. Therefore, full comparative documentation is still incomplete.", 
    "9": "From analyses of the effectiveness of beta-blocker monotherapy in relation to the patient's age and to pre-treatment renin determinations an antihypertensive drug program is proposed in which beta-blockers form the cornerstone. Patients with essential hypertension can be subdivided into groups with low (19%), normal (59%), or high (23%) renin sodium index. The proportion with low renin hypertension increases with age. Patients with high renin fall into two categories: younger patients with fairly mild hypertension and older pateients with more severe hypertension and signs of renal disease. The antihypertensive efficacy of beta-blocker monotherapy is best in high renin forms, good but less consistent in normal renin patients and uniformly bad in low renin hypertensives. In relation to age, beta-blockers normalized blood pressure (larger than or equal to 95 mmHg diastolic) in three-quarters of the younger than 40-year-olds, in about half of those aged 40--60 years, but in only 20% of those aged over 60 years. On this basis, it is postulated that the older patients with a low renin exhibit a relatively hypoadrenergic state while those with a normal or high renin--for a given age and elevated pressure--have a relatively increased adrenergic nervous activity. Because the beta-blockers have a potent suppressive action on the renin-angiotensin system--and, as a consequence, on angiotensin vasoconstriction, aldosterone volume expansion and central stimulatory feedback mechanisms--their antihypertensive mode of action may be linked to an important extent, though not exclusively, to renin suppression.", 
    "10": "The direct arterial blood pressure was monitored over 24 hours in unrestricted untreated patients in order to obtain the average pressure and standard deviation over 24 hours. The standard deviation was taken as the index of variability of pressure. In eight subjects the study was repeated three months after commencement of treatment with a beta-adrenergic blocking agent (tolamolol, 300 mg/day). In these subjects tolamolol resulted in a fall in mean blood pressure from 107 to 92 mmHg (P less than 0-05) and a fall in heart rate from 82 to 70 beats per minute (P less than 0-01). The variability in blood pressure, however, was unaffected by treatment.", 
    "11": "Beta-adrenoceptor antagonists are effective antihypertensive agents in the majority of patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension. Their antipressor activity is greater on systolic than diastolic pressure and greatest during dynamic exertion. Their circulatory effects are maximum within 1-2 hours of ingestion and the antipressor effects of a single dose are detectable for over eight hours. Both the immediate and long-term blood pressure lowering effects of these drugs are dose-related. The reduction in exercise systolic pressure is related to the logarithm of the dose of each drug; the reductions in pressure at rest follow no simple mathematical function. There is wide individual variation in the plasma concentrations achieved after a given oral dose, although the averaged values follow a linear regression. There are wide discrepancies between plasma-concentration profile and magnitude and duration of antihypertensive activity; blood pressure lowering activity persists for significantly longer than the drug is detectable in plasma. The antihypertensive effects of the beta-blocking drugs are enhanced during chronic administration without habituation. Their effects are specific but independent of the immediate presence of the drug, i.e. blood pressure lowering activity persists after clearance of the drug from the body. The ancillary pharmacological properties of these drugs neither augment nor detract from their antihypertensive potency, although the possession of intrinsic vasodilator activity enhances reduction in the blood pressure standing at rest. Beta-blocking drugs add a new dimension to antihypertensive treatment in their specific potential to reduce the coronary consequences of the disease.", 
    "12": "Hypertension is a common disease and plays an important role as a potentially remediable contributor to cardiovascular causes of death in the community. In moderate to severe hypertension recent treatment has improved morbidity and mortality substantially, but it is disappointing that despite this myocardial infarction still stands as an important cause of death. In this regard it is encouraging that beta adrenergic blockade may be useful not only in lowering blood pressure, but also possibly in reducing independently the risk of myocardial infarction and/or sudden death in some patients. In mild hypertension the number of patients is large and the possible beneficial effect of treatment less well-established, so that there is a clear need for further research in order to define patients at relatively high risk in this group.", 
    "13": "1 The effect of intravenous injections of labetalol at doses of 1 and 2 mg/kg was studied in 15 patients with severe hypertension inadequately controlled by beta-adrenoreceptor-blocking drugs. 2 At a dose of 1 mg/kg there was a slight but statistically insignificant reduction in blood pressure. When 2 mg/kg was given there was a prolonged (6 h) significant reduction in lying blood pressure. At both dose levels there was a small initial increase in pulse rate but forced peak flow was not affected. 3 Side-effects were limited to transient postural hypotension and a feeling of warmth. 4 It is concluded that intravenous labetalol at a dose of 2 mg/kg is safe and effective in rapidly reducing blood pressure in patients already receiving beta-adrenoreceptor-blocking drugs.", 
    "14": "1Labetalol is a new compound with antagonistic effects at both alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptor sites. 2 When given to 12 hypertensive patients at an average daily dosage of 273 mg for 7 months statistically significant reductions (compared with pretreatment values) in recumbent and standing blood pressure were observed. 3 Treatment has to be withdrawn in one patient because of vivid dreams, and dosage was reduced in one patient because of dizziness. Otherwise no side-effects of importance were noted. 4 It can therefore be concluded that labetalol offers a useful anti-hypertensive effect and that this compound is well tolerated.", 
    "15": "Twelve hypertensive patients received oral labetalol treatment (average final dose 1,200 mg/d) over a period of 16 months. 2 Satisfactory blood pressure control was maintained both at rest and after exercise. 3 Plasma renin activity was significantly reduced. 4 Postural hypotension measured in this group of patients after a single dose of labetalol 50 mg intravenously was considerably reduced during long-term oral treatment. 5 No serious side-effects were observed nor were there any significant changes in haematological and biochemical variables during the period. 6 Haemodynamic data obtained in two of the patients after 16 months' treatment suggests that the haemodynamic profile observed after acute intravenous administration is maintained after prolonged oral treatment.", 
    "16": "1 The haemodynamic effects of labetalol 50 mg intravenously were studied in 13 hypertensive patients at rest in the supine and upright positions and during exercise using percutaneous right heart and brachial artery catheterization. 2 Labetalol induced immediate significant reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressures in all conditions. 3 Heart rate, stroke volume and cardiac output were not significantly altered in the supine position at rest but were significantly reduced in the upright position. In addition systemic vascular resistance was significantly reduced. 4 During exercise, heart-rate, cardiac output and vascular resistance were significantly reduced; stroke volume was increased. Left ventriclac filling pressures were unchanged both at rest and during exercise. 5 It was concluded that these changes resulted from blockade to both alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptor.", 
    "17": "1 The pharmacological effects of labetalol have been studied in normal healthy subjects. The results of these studies are reviewed. 2 In the evaluation of the beta-adrenoreceptor-blocking effects of labetalol various indices of beta-adrenoceptor blockade in man were used. Labetalol administered orally and intravenously competitively antagonized the effects of isoprenaline on heart rate and diastolic blood pressure. The beta-adrenoceptor blockade induced was regarded as 'non-selective'. In addition, labetalol produced dose-related inhibitory effects on exercise-induced increases in heart rate any systolic blood pressure and similar dose-related inhibitory effects on the tachycardia induced by valsalva's manoeuvre. Labetalol had only a modest inhibitory effect on the tachycardia induced by tilting since blood pressure was reduced on a dose-related basis. 3 Labetalol was a specific competitive antagonist of the alpha-adrenoceptor agonist effects of systemically administered phenylephrine and locally infused noradrenaline. In addition, oral and intravenous administration of labetalol reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the supine, standing and sitting positions. 4 The onset and duration of the alpha- and beta-antagonist effects of oral labetalol did not seem to be dissociated in time and there was a close correlation between the change in plasma concentration and pharmacological effects. 5 In comparative studies with propranolol, similar beta-antagonist effects were observed but propranolol was 4-6 times more potent weight for weight. Precise comparison, however, was complicated by the combined alpha- and beta -effects of labetalol, especially as the predominant effect of labetalol in normotensive subjects was to reduce blood pressure; whereas the predominant effect of propranolol was to reduce heart rate. In addition propranolol had inhibitory effects on ventilatory function in normal subjects, whereas labetalol in equivalent beta-adrenoreceptor-blocking doses did not. 6 From the details of the studies reviewed it was concluded that in man labetalol possesses combined alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist properties.", 
    "18": "1 The animal pharmacology of labetalol, a drug that blocks both alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptors, is reviewed. 2 In isolated tissues the blockade by labetalol of both alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptors satisfied accepted critera for competitive antagonism. In contrast phentolamine was a competitive antagonist at alpha-adrenoreceptors only, and propranolol a competitive antagonist at beta-adrenoreceptors only. Labetalol was 6-10 times less potent than phentolamine in blocking alpha-adrenoreceptors and 1.5-3 times less potent than propranolol in blocking beta-adrenoreceptors. Labetalol itself was 4-8 times more potent at beta- than at alpha-adrenoreceptors. 3 In anaesthetized dogs labetalol given intravenously blocked vasopressor responses to phenylephrine positive chronotropic, vasodepressor and bronchodilator response to isoprenaline. Phentolamine blocked the effect of phenylephrine only, and propranolol the effects of isoprenaline only. Labetalol was about 7 times less potent than phentolamine in blocking alpha-adrenoreceptors, about 4 times less potent than propranolol in blocking cardiac beta1-adrenoreceptors, and 11-17 times less potent than propranolol in blocking vascular and bronchial beta2-adrenoceptors. This difference in the relative potency of labetalol arises because propranolol is a slightly more potent antagonist at beta2- than at beta1-adrenoreceptors. Labetaol itself was about 16 times more potent at cardiac beta1- than at vascular alpha-adrenoreceptors. In conscious dogs labetaol given orally blocked vasopressor responses to phenylephrine and positive chonotropic responses to isoprenaline. 4 In anesthetized dogs and pithed rats labetaol blocked alpha- or beta-adrenoreceptor-mediated responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation and intravenously administered phenylephrine or isoprenaline to approximately the same extent. 5 Labetalol does not possess partial agonist (intrinsic sympathomimetic) activity at cardiac beta1-adrenoreceptors. 6 The blocking action of labetalol both in vivo was shown to be specific for alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptors. 7 The haemodynamic effects of labetalol are attributable to its adrenoreceptor-blocking actions. The observed responses vary from one experiment situation to another depending on the balance of autonomic influences. For example, in barbitone-anaesthetized dogs, in which sympathetic tone predominates, both labetalol and propranolol reduced heart rate, contractility, output and work--effects which are attributable to beta-adrenoreceptor blockade. Labetalol differed from propranolol in decreasing rather than increasing total peripheral resistance and in causing larger falls in blood pressure at equipotent beta-adrenoreceptor-blocking doses. These differences are probably attributable to peripheral vasodilatation resulting from the vascular alpha-adrenoreceptor-blocking action of labetalol...", 
    "19": "The pharmacology and hemodynamics of tazolol (1-iso-propylamino-3-(2-thiazoloxy)-2-propranolol HC1), a selective myocardial beta-stimulant, were studied in pentobarbital anesthetized dogs. Tazolol, i.v., increased myocardial contractile force and heart rate, but induced only minimal changes in arterial pressure. The cardiac effects of tazolol were blocked by pretreatment with the beta-blockers propranolol or practolol and inhibited in animals made tachyphylactic to amphetamine. They were not altered by pretreatment with hexamehtonium, atropine or reserpine. Tazolol increased left circumflex coronary artery flow to a far greater extent than a dose level of isoproterenol which produced a greater increase in cardiac output. Tazolol also increased superior mesenteric artery flow, whereas isoproterenol decreased it. Renal artery flow was not altered. Tazolol was also found to be orally active and to possess some mild general beta-blocking activity.", 
    "20": "Following an initial dose response study, metoprolol, a selective beta1-receptor blocking agent, was compared with equipotent dosages of propanolol in a double blind cross-over study, including exercise tolerance tests, on fourteen patients with angina pectoris. Long term therapy with metoprolol then followed until the seventy-second week. Patients performed 8% more total work on metoprolol with 15% more work recorded up to the onset of S-T depression, in comparison with propranolol. In the long term, ther was no significant difference in work performed when the daily dosage of metoprolol was changed from a q.i.d. to a b.d. regime. Metoprolol was shown to be an effective anti-anginal compound with good tolerance and safety, with gradual improvement in underlying myocardial ischaemia during long term treatment.", 
    "21": "The benzofuran analog bufuralol, a beta-adrenergic blocker, was determined in blood and urine by a specific and sensitive spectrofluorometric assay. The compound was extracted into ether from blood or urine adjusted to pH 10. The ether extract was separated by TLC to resolve the parent drug from any basic metabolites present, and the spots were eluted off the silica gel and quantitated fluorometrically in 0.1 N HCl. The overall recovery of the assay was 85 +/- 3.0%; the sensitivity limit was 2-4 ng/ml of blood or urine, using a 2.5-ml specimen/analysis. The method was applied to the determination of blood levels in a dog following a single 10-mg/kg oral dose and in two human subjects administered a single 20-mg oral dose.", 
    "22": "We previously reported that alpha- but not beta-adrenergic agonists stimulate renin release from mouse submaxillary glands in vivo. The present studies were undertaken to determine if these in vivo effects were due to a direct action on the submaxillary glands and to find out if cyclic AMP (cAMP) might be involved in submaxillary renin release. Pooled mouse submaxillary gland slices were incubated in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate medium following a preincubation period, and renin release was measured by a radioimmunoassay for the direct measurement of submaxillary gland renin. Tissue cAMP levels were also measured. Addition of the alpha-adrenergic agonists, phenylephrine or norepinephrine, significantly increased renin release (P less than 0.01 vs. control) while decreasing tissue cAMP levels (P less than 0.01 vs. control). In contrast, addition of the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol markedly increased cAMP levels (P less than 0.01 vs. control) and decreased renin release (P less than 0.05 vs. control). Pretreatment of the slices with the alpha-blocker phenoxy genzamine inhibited the effect of phenylephrine. These results indicate that alpha-adrenergic agonists cause renin release from submaxillary glands which is accompanied by a fall in tissue cAMP levels. This is in contrast to renin release from the kidney which is stimulated by beta-adrenergic agonists.", 
    "23": "Physiological and pharmacological studies of more than 150 patients with movement disorders are reported. Particular attention is paid to the differentiation of various types of tremor on the basis of rate, rhythm, and pattern of EMG activity in antagonistic muscles. The typical 'tremor-at-rest' of Parkinson's disease--3-7 Hz activity which alternates between antagonistic muscles--is suppressed, at least briefly, during voluntary activity, at which time typical 8--12 Hz 'physiological tremor' may be seen. Essential tremor and its familial or senile variants also have a characteristic EMG pattern during voluntary activity--5-8 Hz bursts of activity which are synchronous in antagonistic muscles. This type of tremor may also be present in patients with Parkinson's disease and in certain kinships with a Charcot-Marie-Tooth polyneuropathy. Other tremors in association with polyneuropathy ('neuropathic tremor') have different physiological characteristics. Myoclonus is of essentially two types ('positive' with EMG bursts and 'negative' with brief pauses in ongoing activity, as with asterixis) and may, at times, mimic tremor. Certain specific tremors respond predictably to specific pharmacological therapy.", 
    "24": "The spontaneous contractility of rat epididymis was recorded in vivo and the effects of various autonomic drugs were studied. Norepinephrine, epinephrine, and orciprenaline produced a sudden increase in tonus and in the size and frequency of epididymal contractions. Phentolamine (an alpha-blocker agent) inhibited the effects of norepinephrine. On the other hand, alprenolol (a beta-blocker agent) inhibited the effects of orciprenaline but did not block the effects of norepinephrine. In addition, phentolamine and alprenolol decreased the spontaneous activity of the epididymis. Acetylcholine produced effects similar to those of norepinephrine. These effects were blocked by atropine. The results described would indicate the presence of the two receptors, alpha and beta, and that both are mediators of stimulatory effects.", 
    "25": "(-)-3/-Norepinephrine (3H-NE) binding to the microsomal fraction of the rabbit aorta has been studied. Binding appears to increase linearly with time up to at least 30 min, shows no evidence of stereoselectivity and may be inhibited only by compounds possessing the catechol or 3-methoxy-4hydroxyphenyl moieties, with the latter being 100-fold less effective. 3H-NE binding is saturable with a Km of 8.5 X 10(-8) M and V max of 28 pmoles/mg protein. A Hill plot indicates that binding is noncooperative whereas a Scatchard plot suggests that two sites may be present. Binding does not appear to require physiological concentrations of Ca2+ or Mg2+ and is inhibited significantly by EDTA and sodium metabisulfite. In addition, binding is markedly enhanced by low and high pH values. This binding is also inhibited by sodium metabisulfite which suggests that an oxidized form of the catecholamine is the active binding species. Experiments with several group specific reagents indicate that binding may require a free sulfhydryl group but not a carboxyl function. The binding process requires an energy of activation of 14.8 kcal/mole whose magnitude may be partly explained, with the aid of optical rotatory dispersion spectra, by a non-stereoslective conformational change in protein structure induced by the amine. The characteristics of the 3H-NE binding sites observed in the microsomal fractional of the rabbit aorta appear to be different from those expected if binding were to the adrenoreceptors. A possible mechanism for catecholamine binding to free sulfhydryl groups on protein is presented.", 
    "26": "The efficacy of tolamolol, a cardioselective beta adrenergic blocking agent, was evaluated in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias in 27 patients. Nineteen patients had supraventricular arrhythmias and eight had ventricular arrhythmias. Evaluation was by doulbe-blind randomized trial in 23 patients. Tolamolol was effective in reducing ventricular rate in 17 (85 percent) of 19 patients with supraventricular arrhythmias and resulted in conversion to sinus rhythm in 2 of the 17. The mean ventricular rate in 17 patients decreased from 135 to 102/min 10 minutes after initiation of administration of tolamolol and gradually decreased further to 93/min after 60 minutes. Reduction in ventricular rate was sustained for 2 hours of monitoring undergone by all patients and for 4 and 6 hours monitoring in two subgroups. Among the eight patients with ventricular ectopic beats, tolamolol reduced their frequency in four patients and had no effect in four. Six patients had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and experienced no adverse clinical effects on respiratory function in association with administration to tolamolol. Untoward effects occurred in 10 patients, including hypotension in 3, 1 of whom required vasopressor therapy. Other side effects were sedation, nausea, dyspnea and warmth in the chest, all of which were mild and transient, requiring no treatment. Cardioselective beta adrenergic blockade with tolamolol was highly effective in controlling ventricular rate in supraventricular arrhythmias and reduced the frequency of ventricular ectopic beats in half of the small group of patients with this arrhythmia. It is particularly applicable in patients with obstructive pulmonary disease in whom cardiac beta adrenergic blockade is indicated. Hypotension is an important potential side effect.", 
    "27": "An isolated blood perfused kidney preparation was used to study the influence of intrarenal adrenergic receptors on renal hemodynamics, renal function, and the renin-angiotensin system. Beta adrenergic blockade with propranolol resulted in a reduction of fractional sodium excretion, and alpha blockade with phentolamine had no effect on sodium excretion despite significant increases in cortical flow and glomerular filtration rate. The changes in sodium excretion after beta blockade were not felt to be due to a direct tubular effect but rather were secondary to preferential perfusion of nephrons in the juxtamedullary cortex, which is known to have higher sodium reabsorptive capacity. These changes appeared to be direct effects of adrenergic blockade on the renal vasculature and were independent of any effects on renin secretion.", 
    "28": "To evaluate the effects of reflex renal sympathetic nerve stimulation on renal tubular sodium handling, clearance studies were performed in anesthetized dogs. With renal perfusion pressure held constant, baroreceptor reflex renal sympathetic nerve stimulation was produced by controlled arterial hemorrhage or carotid sinus perfusion. Significant decreases in urinary sodium excretion occurred in the presence of minor insignificant alterations in renal blood flow and no changes in glomerular filtration rate. Renal alpha adrenergic receptor blockade (phenoxybenzamine) or adrenergic blockade (guanethidine) completely reversed the fall in urinary sodium excretion; this could not be attributed to alterations in glomerular filtration rate or renal blood flow. These studies support the interpretation that adrenergic innervation of the renal tubules is involved in the regulation of renal tubular sodium reabsorption.", 
    "29": "Slices of submaxillary gland were incubated in vitro in an enriched Krebs-Ringer-bicarbonate medium gassed with 95% O2-5% CO2 at 37 degrees C and the release of K+ into the medium was monitored after stimulation with alpha and beta adrenergic secretagogues under a variety of experimental conditions. K+ was released by the slice system after addition of norepinephrine, epinephrine or phenylephrine, but not after addition of isoproterenol. The extent of K+ release after norepinephrine depends on the dose of secretagogue and is higher when glucose, adenine and inosine, or all three substrates are absent from the medium. The effect of norepinephrine on K+ release is reversed by phentolamine but not by propranolol. Phentolamine also causes a 9.4-fold shift to the right in the dose-response curve to norepinephrine. Addition of ouabain to the incubation medium results in a higher extent of K+ release and prevents the reversal caused by phentolamine. The response to norepinephrine fails to occur when Ca++ is absent from the medium, either by chelation with ethylene glycol bis (beta-amino-ethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid or by elimination from the Krebs-Ringer solution, and shows gradations depending on the Ca++ content of the medium. By itself, however, Ca++ does not induce K+ release from the slice system. The following conclusions are derived from these observations: 1) the release of K+ ions from the submaxillary gland is mediated by alpha adrenergic receptors; 2) the net amount of K+ released is the result of two opposing and almost simultaneous mechanisms, a passive extrusion and an active reuptake; 3) the active reuptake of K+ depends on the availability of energy and is mediated through the ouabain-sensitive Na+-K+ activated adenosine triphosphatase; 4) the reaction is critically dependent on the presence of Ca++ in the incubation medium and probably involves an influx of Ca++ upon stimulation with alpha adrenergic secretagogues.", 
    "30": "Pertussis vaccine injected ip in doses known to cause hypersensitization resulted in a marked decrease in the number of mast cells from the peritoneal washings of rats and mice. A significant reduction was obtained as early as one day after pertussis injection of ten billion cells in rats and was marked after 5 to 7 days. A maximum reduction in the number of mast cells was obtained by a dose of 20 billion cells. There was no detectable histamine biological activity in the supernatant from peritoneal washings obtained after 10 min, 60 min, and 24 hr from control and pertussis-treated rats, indicating that pertussis did not cause degranulation of mast cells in vivo. The histamine content in the precipitated mast cell pellets from control rats was much higher than the corresponding histamine content from pertussis-treated rats. In rats and mice, propranolol and other beta adrenergic-blocking agents caused degranulation of mast cells in the peritoneal washings in vitro. Practolol was the least effective beta adrenergic-blocking agent in degranulating mast cells. Catecholamines, histamine, 6-hydroxydopamine, methacholine, and pertussis failed to cause any degranulation. Isoproterenol protected the mast cell against the degranulation induced by propranolol. Propranolol caused bluing in rat and mice skin when injected id. Mast cells from control and pertussis-injected rats were equally sensitive to propranolol in vitro. The low recovery of mast cells from the peritoneal washings of rats and mice is thought to be due to mobilization of mast cells away from the peritoneum.", 
    "31": "A double-blind placebo crossover trail (2 periods, each of 6 wk) was carried out in 12 patients. In the first period the patients were randomly allocated to either their individual established dose of prazosin or to the same number of placebo tablets; treatment was reversed after 6 wk. Blood pressure was higher by 17/8 mm Hgin the lying posture and by 24/14 mm Hg in the standing posture during placebo than during prazosin treatment. Standing pulse rate and body weight were higher and plasma renin activity lower during prazosin treatment. Postural hypotension occurring 1 to 2 hr after the first few doses was noted in one third of the patients when they resumed prazosin treatment after the placebo course.", 
    "32": "The effects of metoprolol, a selective beta adrenergic receptor antagonist, on blood pressure, beta receptor blockade (antagoinst of isoproterenol and exercise tachycardia), and plasma renin activity (PRA) have been compared with those of placebo in 16 patients with essential hypertension. The dose of metroprolol was 25 mg three times daily for 1 wk and thereafter 100 mg three times daily for 5 wk. The mean decrease in blood pressure during treatment with metoprolol was 24 +/- 3.8 (SEM)/10 +/- 2.1 mm Hg in the lying position and 23 +/- 4.4/9 +/- 3.1 mm Hg after 1 min in the standing position. At a dose of 2.9 to 5.4 mg/kg, steady-state plasma concentrations of metoprolol varied 17-fold (from 20 to 341 ng/ml) between patients and correlated with the interindividual variability in isoproterenol antagonism (r = 0.58, p less than 0.05) and decrease in exercise tachycardia (r = 0.65, p less than 0.01). By contrast, neither of these variables correlated with the dose of metoprolol in mg/kg. Metoprolol decreased PRA by 67 +/- 1.9 and 71 +/- 1.2% in the lying and standing positions, respectively. The decrease in the mean arterial blood pressure in the lying position was significantly correlated to the PRA during the placebo period (r = 0.61, p less than 0.05) but not to the plasma steady-state levels of metoprolol, the degree of beta receptor blockade, and the decrease in PRA.", 
    "33": "The effects of atenolol, a new beta1-blocking drug, on pulse rate, sweating, and blood glucose levels during insulin-induced hypoglycaemia were studied in a double-blind crossover trial in eight normal subjects using placebo and propranolol as reference agents. The intensity of induced hypoglycaemia was identical for atenolol, propranolol, and placebo. Propranolol prolonged hypoglycaemia, but atenolol did not. Atenolol may therefore be safe for use in patients receiving insulin.", 
    "34": "Broken cell particulate preparations of adenylate cyclase isolated from the human glioma cell line 132-1N1 were stimulated 2-to 3-fold by 30 muM adenosine. This concentration of adenosine produced a maximal stimulation of the cyclase while 3 to 5 muM adenosine produced half-maximal stimulation. Theophylline, at 40 muM, inhibited the adenosine stimulation of the adenylate cyclase by about 40% while 200 muM produced near complete inhibition. The inhibition by theophylline could be overcome by increasing adenosine to a concentration 10-fold that of theophylline, implying that the inhibition was competitive. Basal activity was not inhibited by even 1.0 mM theophylline, nor was the epinephrine stimulated activity. In contrast, 1.0 muM propranolol essentially completely inhibited the 8-fold stimulation of 1.0 muM epinephrine but had no effect on either basal or adenosine-stimulated activity. Adenosine and 2-chloroadenosine were equipotent in stimulating adenylate cyclase from the 132-1N1 line, whereas neither adenine nor guanosine had any detectable effect. GTP, 10 muM, produced a small variable stimulation of the adenylate cyclase while the GTP analogue, 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p), produced a marked stimulation fo the cyclase. Preincubation of the adenylate cyclase preparation with the analogue greatly increased its potency and maximal effect. In contrast, both basal and adenosine-stimulated activity decreased markedly with preincubation. The effects of adenosine or epinephrine in combination with Gpp(NH)p were at least additive and often synergistic in comparison to the effects of the compounds alone. The effects of adenosine on intact and broken cell preparations of the human fibroblast lines WI-38 and VA13-2RA were also examined. In the intact VA13-2RA, adenosine produced rapid and large increases in intracellular and extracellular cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP). In the parental fibroblast line, the WI-38, adenosine slightly elevated basal levels of cAMP, but only produced marked elevations in the presence of non-methylxanthine phosphodiesterase inhibitors. The effect of adenosine on the broken cell particulate preparations of adenylate cyclase from the fibroblasts was similar to its action on the cyclase from the 132-1N1; 30 muM adenosine produced a maximal stimulation of the adenylate cyclase, and the stimulation was inhibited by theophylline.", 
    "35": "Some of the interesting points which emerged from an international symposium on beta-blockers and the central nervous system, held in St Moritz in January 1976, are presented. Fifty-eight participants from 12 countries attended the symposium.", 
    "36": "The local effect on veins and arteries of isoprenaline, propranolol and practolol was investigated in the human after intra-arterial application at the forearm. The injection of isoprenaline was followed by a dilatation of the arteries and veins. This effect was inhibited by propranolol, but not by practolol. The results demonstrate, that the peripheral vasoactive beta-stimulatory effect is mediated by so-called beta2-receptors, which were not influenced by a selective beta1-blocking agent like practolol. The results were discussed in respect to their clinical relevance.", 
    "37": "A method for the quantitative determination of propranolol and two of its active metabolites, 3-(alpha-naphthoxy)-1,2-propanediol (propranolol glycol) and N-des-isopropylpropranolol, in brain tissue of mice is described. Tissues are homogenized in perchloric acid-acetonitrile. Propranolol and its metabolites are isolated from the supernatant by solvent extraction and separated and detected as their trifluoroacetyl derivatives by electron capture gas chromatography. Chemical structures of the derivatives were confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The electron capture detector response of all three compounds is high, 0.7-2.0 X 10(-16) moles/sec. Brain levels of 10-250 ng/g can be detected of all three compounds with high specificity and good precision.", 
    "38": "The immediate short-term effect on plasma renin activity of intravenous injection of propranolol was studied in 31 normal subjects and 166 hypertensive patients. In patients with essential hypertension and normal subjects plasma renin activity fell considerably within 15 minutes; the fall was directly proportional to initial plasma renin levels. In contrast, in patients with renal hypertension the fall was much less pronounced or totally absent. These differences in response to propranolol provide, though presently only on a group basis, a biochemical means of differentiating between patients with renal hypertension and those with essential hypertension. The observations also indicate that, unlike normal subjects and patients with essential hypertension, in patients with renal hypertension sympathetic activity plays no part in the control of basal plasma renin levels.", 
    "39": "The effect of propranolol was studied in a double-blind crossover trial in 24 carefully selected hypertensive outpatients. Each patient received propranolol 60 mg/day, 120 mg/day, 240 mg/day, and placebo for four weeks each according to a randomised sequence. Propranolol 60 mg/day was no better than placebo in reducing blood pressure. The effects of propranolol 120 mg/day and 240 mg/day were not significantly different. Both doses reduced lying blood pressure by about 20/10 mm Hg from an initial level of 173/104 mm Hg. No difference was detected between the effects of the different doses of propranolol and placebo on weight or on the occurrence of adverse reactions.", 
    "40": "The effect of a low dose of methyldopa combined with (a) a non-selective and (b) a selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist was studied in a double-blind crossover trial in 24 carefully selected patients with moderate hypertension (mean initial lying blood pressure 189/117 mm Hg). Each patient received methyldopa 750 mg/day, propranolol 240 mg/day, practolol 600 mg/day, methyldopa 750 mg/day combined with propranolol 240 mg/day, methyldopa 750 mg/day combined with practolol 600 mg/day, and placebo for four weeks each according to a random sequence. After four weeks of therapy the most effective treatment, methyldopa combined with propranolol, reduced lying and standing blood pressures by 36-5/21-4 mm Hg and 44-7/25 mm Hg respectively. Thic combination had similar effects to those of the combination of methyldopa with the cardioselective agent practolol except that it reduced lying diastolic pressure further. The combination was more effective than either treatment alone. No significant differences were found between the effects of propranolol, practolol, or methyldopa at the doses used.", 
    "41": "In the arterially blood-perfused canine papillary muscle, i.a. injections of dipyridamole (10-300 mug) produced a dose-dependent increase in developed tension amounting to about 45% of the basal developed tension at 300 mug. The positive inotropic response to dipyridamole was greatly reduced by a prior i.a. injection of propranolol (10 mug) or by pretreatment with reserpine (0.2 mg/kg s.c. for 3 consecutive days) but not affected by a prior i.a. injection of tetrodotoxin (1 mug) or desmethylimipramine (3-10 mug). The positive inotropic response to dipyridamole reduced by pretreatment with reserpine was restored by i.a. infusion of noradrenaline (0.03 mug/min). Dipyridamole did not modify the positive inotropic responses to noradrenaline and tyramine. These results suggest that the positive inotropic response to dipyridamole is largely due to noradrenaline released from adrenergic nerve endings by a mechanism that differs from those operative in the action of tyramine or in liberation of noradrenaline upon excitation.", 
    "42": "The interaction of propranolol with erythrocyte membranes at concentrations stabilizing intact erythrocytes against hypotonic hemolysis produced corresponding perturbations in membrane protein and particularly membrane phospholipid components as monitored by increases in the reactivity of membrane amino and sulfhydryl groups towards trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid and 5,5'-dithio-bis(2-nitro-benzoic acid), respectively. Membrane-propranolol interactions were also analyzed in terms of alterations produced in the kinetic properties of membrane enzymes. These experiments provided evidence that propranolol-induced perturbations were sufficiently generalized as to influence the activity of enzymatic processes associated with both inner and outer membrane surfaces. Configurational changes in membrane phospholipids were implicated in these effects of propranolol, which included alterations in functionally significant membrane-cation interactions, It is suggested that the findings described here may provide a basis for understanding molecular aspects of membrane stabilization in other systems.", 
    "43": "The effect of propranolol has been studied in two patients with chronic renal failure and hypertension which remained refractory despite the removal of excess sodium and water by dialysis. Measurements of plasma-renin, exchangeable sodium, and blood-volume demonstrated that in both patients hypertension was due to excess renin. The administration of propranolol was followed by a rapid fall in blood-pressure to normal, thereby obviating the need for bilateral nephrectomy. In both patients the fall in blood-pressure was accompanied by a striking fall in plasma-renin, and in one there was a highly significant association between plasma-renin activity and mean arterial pressure.", 
    "44": "We studied the antihypertensive effect of propranolol alone and in combination with diuretics in 13 patients with high, 18 with normal and nine with low-renin essential hypertension whose blood-pressure response to diuretics was previously established. Propranolol (160 mg daily) significantly lowered mean arterial pressure in high-renin (129 +/- 2.6 to 114 +/- 2.1 mm Hg) and normal-renin (131 +/- 2.7 to 119 +/- 3.5 mm Hg) patients but not in low-renin patients. A positive correlation (r = 0.36, P less than 0.05) between fall in pressure and fall in plasma renin activity occurred at this dose when the whole group was considered. An antihypertensive effect occurred in both high-renin and low-renin hypertension during large-dose (320 to 960 mg daily) propranolol therapy. This effect was independent of changes in plasma renin activity. The antihypertensive effects of propranolol and diuretics were additive in normal-renin and high-renin hypertension. These data suggest that propranolol's pressure-lowering activity is due to both renin-dependent and renin-independent effects.", 
    "45": "The hypotensive activity of five beta-adrenoceptor antagonists with different ancillary pharmacological properties was compared in a randomised double-blind factorial trial in 25 untreated patients with stable, uncomplicated essential hypertension. In doses that produced similar reductions in exercise tachycardia all drugs had similar blood-pressure lowering activity, greater on systolic than diastolic pressure and greatest during exercise. With the exception of vasodilator activity the possession of any particular combinaton of ancillary pharmacological properties did not significantly influence the specific antihypertensive activity of these compounds.", 
    "46": "When examined by fluorescence microscopy the rabbit basilar artery contains a rich adrenergic-like plexus at the adventitiomedial junction. The fluorescence disappears upon chronic reserpinization and bilateral superior cervical ganglionectomy. Transmural stimulation of intramural nerves a results in a response which is predominantly constrictor but also contains a small, inconstant dilator component. The constrictor response is abolished by chronic reserpinization, bilateral superior cervical ganglionectomy, and cold storage of the preparation. The constriction is prevented by the adrenergic neuron blocking agents guanethidine and bretylium but not by such alpha-adrenergic receptor blocking agents as phenoxybenzamine (PBZ), phentolamine, and tolazoline. Our results show that doses of the three latter agents sufficient to abolish contractions to norepinephrine (NE) in concentrations of up to 10(-2) M only potentiate and prolong the contractile response to nerve stimulation. The beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent, propranolol, and inhibitors of NE neuronal uptake, such as desipramine (desmethylimipramine, DMI) and cocaine, do not influence the size of the neurogenic response. These results suggest that the vasoconstrictor component of the rabbit basilar artery response to transmural nerve stimulation (TNS) is mediated via sympathetic adrenergic-like neurons, but at the same time also raise the question whether the transmission process is typical of classic adrenergic neuroeffector mechanisms.", 
    "47": "The relative contribution of catecholaminergic mechanisms in head-shaking (H-S) of infant rats was explored by comparing the H-S inducing effects of apomorphine and amphetamine in rats from 4-14 days old, and the blocking effect of neuroleptic drugs (chlorpromazine and haloperidol) and more specific alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists (phenoxybenzamine and propranolol), on amphetamine induced head-shaking. As apomorphine, but not amphetamine, may induce H-S in four-day-old rats, and the latter drug potentiates apomorphine induced H-S, even in days in which, if injected alone it has no effect, it is suggested that both dopaminergic and noradrenergic mechanisms are involved in H-S, thus differentiating this motor item from other motor patterns included in stereotyped behaviour. This suggestion is further supported by the demonstration that while D-amphetamine induced H-S is blocked by phenoxybenzamine, other stereotyped motor patterns continue unimpaired."
