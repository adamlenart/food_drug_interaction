    "0": "1. The pressure in the ducts of the two submaxillary glands was recorded in anaesthetized dogs in which either the superior cervical ganglion had been removed or the chorda-lingual nerve had been cut on one side, 17-30 days earlier. Noradrenaline, adrenaline, phenylephrine, acetylcholine and methacholine were injected to produce pressure rises attributed to contraction of myoepithelial cells.2. After sympathectomy increased pressure responses were obtained with all the drugs, but particularly with noradrenaline. Cocaine increased the effect of noradrenaline on the normal gland but slightly less than sympathectomy.3. Parasympathetic decentralization increased the pressure effects of acetylcholine and methacholine, and in most cases also increased those of the sympathomimetic drugs.4. It is concluded that the myoepithelial cells of this gland normally receive motor impulses from both divisions of the autonomic nervous system, and that many, if not all, of the cells are innervated by both. Disconnecting the gland from the central nervous system by either pathway causes supersensitivity of the classical post-junctional type, and sympathetic ganglionectomy causes in addition a pre-junctional sensitization.", 
    "1": "1. Nicotine, 20 mug/ml, briefly and partially blocked the longitudinal contractions of a chick vagus nerve-oesophagus preparation to nerve stimulation, but potentiated them in the presence of hyoscine, 10 mug/ml.2. Strychnine, 20 mug/ml, antagonized the longitudinal contractions of the chick oesophagus to nerve stimulation, though not to acetylcholine or 5-hydroxytryptamine. Hyoscine, 10 mug/ml, enhanced the nerve-blocking action of strychnine.3. These observations suggest that in the vagus nerve of the chicken, hyoscine either blocks certain types of fibre selectively or interacts with pharmacological receptors for strychnine and nicotine.4. Tetrodotoxin, 1 mug/ml, propranolol, 40 mug/ml, cocaine, 200 mug/ml, or strychnine, 100 mug/ml, which render autonomic nerves inexcitable, potentiated the spontaneous movements of isolated preparations of chicken oesophagus at normal intra-luminal pressure; they also potentiated peristaltic response to increased intra-luminal pressure.5. These observations suggest that the preparations contain intramural nerves that inhibit the musculature.6. Peristalsis in the chicken oesophagus was unaffected by nicotine, 20 mug/ml, tubocurarine, 20 mug/ml, hyoscine, 10 mug/ml, phentolamine, 1 mug/ml, propranolol, 0.5 mug/ml, mepyramine, 1 mug/ml, methysergide, 0.1 mug/ml, and morphine, 20 mug/ml. It was produced in preparations of chicken oesophagus after removal of the mucous membrane. Papaverine, 20 mug/ml, inhibited the peristalsis and had a spasmolytic action in the musculature.7. These observations suggest that the peristalsis in isolated preparations of chicken oesophagus is dependent solely upon myogenic contractility.", 
    "2": "1. The actions of isoprenaline on the contraction and the resting potential of the isolated extensor digitorum longus (EDL), a fast contracting muscle, and the soleus, a slow contracting muscle, of the guinea-pig were investigated. Twitch tension was elicited by direct supramaximal stimulation and recorded isometrically.2. The twitch tension of EDL elicited by pulses of 0.5-10 ms duration was increased in the presence of isoprenaline (1 mug/ml). Isoprenaline increased the twitch tension of the soleus elicited by a pulse of more than 5 ms duration, but decreased it when elicited by a pulse of less than 1 millisecond. These effects were blocked by propranolol (1-3 mug/ml) but not by phentolamine (1-5 mug/ml).3. In EDL, isoprenaline prolonged the time to peak tension and the half-relaxation time. The twitch of the soleus was shortened by isoprenaline due to an acceleration of relaxation. These findings were independent of stimulus duration.4. The potentiating effects of isoprenaline on the twitch tension of EDL and the soleus were not observed in K(+)-free Krebs solution and were abolished by ouabain (1 mug/ml) and by reduction of the temperature from 33 degrees to 18 degrees C. The effects of isoprenaline on the relaxation proces were not affected by these treatments.5. In EDL, the resting potential increased from 77.3 mV to 78.5 mV after isoprenaline, whereas in the soleus it increased from 69.1 to 74.7 mV. These effects were blocked by propranolol, K(+)-deficiency, ouabain, and cooling to 18 degrees C. Hyperpolarization by isoprenaline was increased by substitution of isethionate for the external chloride.6. There was a good correlation between the potentiation of the mechanical response and the hyperpolarization of the membrane by isoprenaline. The hyperpolarization seems to be due to activation of the Na(+)-K(+) pump.", 
    "3": "The effects of alterations in the frequency of contraction over the range from 94 to 220/min on left ventricular pressure, diameter, and dP/dt were studied in 10 dogs instrumented with ultrasonic diameter ganges and miniature pressure gauges. The same dogs were studied on separate days in the conscious state, after general anesthesia with pentobarbital Na, 30 mg/kg, and in the conscious state after pretreatment with propranolol, 3 mg/kg. End diastolic diameter was maintained constant during alterations in frequency by infusing saline intravenously. The maximum increases in peak dP/dt and dP/dt/P in the conscious state were 14 and 10%, respectively. After anesthesia, raising the frequency of contraction from 122 to 220/min caused maximum increases in peak dP/dt and dP/dt/P of 36 and 30%, respectively. In the conscious state after cardiac depression by propranolol, the maximum increases in peak dP/dt and dP/dt/P were 23 and 23%, respectively. Thus, increasing the frequency of contraction of the normal heart of the conscious dog causes only a slight inotropic effect, but this effect is significantly greater in the presence of myocardial depression produced by anesthesia with pentobarbital Na or in the conscious animal after a myocardial-depressing dose of propranolol.", 
    "4": "1. The pharmacological activities of the optical isomers of salbutamol have been examined. (-)-Salbutamol was much more potent than (+)-salbutamol on beta-adrenoceptors.2. Both (-)- and (+)-salbutamol showed high selectivity for beta-adrenoceptors in bronchial muscle compared to cardiac muscle, in this way resembling racemic salbutamol.3. The use of isomeric activity ratio to detect differences between receptors was examined in the light of the results obtained with the isomers of salbutamol.", 
    "5": "1. In the driven rabbit left atrium alpha-adrenoceptors mediate the inotropic effect of phenylephrine and the prolongation of functional refractory period by sympathomimetic amines.2. These receptors are highly sensitive to blockade by phentolamine and phenoxybenzamine.3. Prolongation of functional refractory period is greater with the secondary amines, phenylephrine, adrenaline and epinine, than with the primary amines, norphenylephrine, noradrenaline and dopamine.", 
    "6": "A severe rebound rise in blood pressure with agitation and insomnia had been noted in five patients when they had previously ceased clonidine (Catapres) This has been shown to be reproducible in these patients and to be associated with a significant increase in urinary catecholamine excretion. The blood pressure can be controlled and the symptoms alleviated promptly by alpha and beta adrenergic receptor blockade using intravenous phentolamine and propranolol.", 
    "7": "An adenylate cyclase that is activated specifically by very low concentrations of octopamine has been identified both in homogenates and in intact cells of the thoracic ganglia of an insect nervous system. This enzyme appears to be distinct from two other adenylate cyclases present in the same tissue, which are activated by dopamine and by 5-hydroxytryptamine, respectively. The data raise the possibility of a role of octopamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase in the physiology of synaptic transmission.", 
    "8": "The soluble supernatant fraction of homogenates of cloned rat astrocytoma cells (linle C-2A) was subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Two peaks of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate phosphodiesterase activity were found, corresponding to peaks I and IV of a similarly prepared homogenate of rat brain. Incubating cells with norepinephrine (0.3 mullimolar) caused about a threefold increase in the activity of peak IV but no change in peak I. This increase was completely inhibited by prior inclubation with propranolol (0.1 millimnolar), a beta-adrenergic blocking agent, or with cyclohexamnine (40 micromolar). a protein synthesis inhibitor. Induction of a specific phosphodiesterase form by norepinephrine sitggests another feedback control mechanism whereby an organism can prevent the effects of excessive sympathetic activity."
