    "0": "The effects of penbutolol (Hoe 893 d), a new non-selective beta-receptor blocking agent, were studied in 5 patients with moderate hypertension. Initially, it was shown that 2-4 mg given orally once or twice daily tended to lower blood pressure and pulse rate, both at rest and following submaximal work. In prolonged trials (3-8 months) 4-60 mg/day were required to produce an acceptable antihypertensive effect. Penbutolol had no effect on the normal increase in plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline on standing, nor did it alter basal urinary catecholamine excretion. Submaximal work caused no significant change in plasma catecholamines before treatment, but there was a marked rise both in plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline during treatment with penbutolol. In short term studies there was a fall in plasma renin by 4 hours after oral administration of penbutolol 2-4 mg, which persisted for 24 hours. Prolonged treatment with penbutolol 20-30 mg twice daily inhibited renin production under basal conditions and following submaximal work, as well as lowered basal urinary aldosterone excretion. In one patient slight asthmatic symptoms appeared after treatment for 3 months with penbutolol. In other respects penbutolol was well tolerated.", 
    "1": "The relation between sequential changes in left ventricular contractility and atrioventricular (A-V) nodal conduction and refractoriness was assessed in open chest dogs during intravenous administration of acetylstrophanthidin (5 mug/kg) at 5 minute intervals until toxic arrhythmias developed. At each time interval, high fidelity left ventricular pressure, its electronic derivative (dP/dt) and a His bundle electrogram were simultaneously recorded and the A-V nodal refractory period was measured by graded trains of stimuli. Animals were studied with an intact autonomic state (Group I), with pharmacologic blockade of both the beta adrenergic and parasympathetic system (Group II) and with parasympathetic blockade (Group III). Whereas contractility increased in response to small doses of digitalis, displaying a linear dose-response relation independent of autonomic tone, A-V nodal transmission indexes responded minimally to less than 50 percent of the toxic dose of digitalis, and the response was dependent upon autonomic tone. These results indicate a dissociation between the effects of digitalis on contractility and A-V transmission in that the major drug action on the ventricular contractile mechanism is a direct, linear one in contrast to the nonlinear response of A-V nodal transmission, which is predominantly mediated through the autonomic system. Clinically, these observations imply that the optimal dose and serum level of digitalis required to treat congestive heart failure may differ significantly from those required to treat supraventricular tachycardias, the therapeutic response of the latter being largely determined by the underlying autonomic tone.", 
    "2": "This was an open, uncontrolled, comparative study of prazosin carried out in 32 patients, to test the efficacy and toleration of the hypotensive agent. In 8 patients prazosin was combined with a diuretic and in 2 patients prindolol (Visken), and in 1 patient, methyldopa (Aldomet), were added. A satisfactory drop in blood pressure occurred in 30 of the 32 patients. Other effects occurred in 18 patients (56%), but they usually disappeared with continued therapy. In 5 patients therapy was stopped because of these effects. There was no postural hypotension, nor did the males experience sexual problems. The mode of action appears to be an adrenoreceptor blockade without receptor occupancy. Prazosin alone or in a combination of drugs, may be a useful hypotensive agent.", 
    "3": "D-Thyroxine was administered intermittently to 11 patients with hyperlipoproteinaemia (Fredrickson type lla). To avoid possible untoward cardiac stimulation, practolol was prescribed with it. Cholesterol levels were measured regularly over a period of 4 years. A temporary drop of about 15% in the mean cholesterol level was obtained. It is, however, concluded that the over-all response is unimpressive.", 
    "4": "The effects of a beta-receptor blocker (Betadrenol), an isosorbide dinitrate preparation (Isoket) and the combination of the two substances (Betaket) were compared with a placebo in a controlled double blind trial in 20 patients with confirmed attacks of angina pectoris and/or ischemic changes in the ECG on ergometer exercise. Important assessment criteria of the efficacy were regression of ischemic ECG changes on standardized ergometer exercise, increase in load resistance and the nitroglycerine requirement. Treatment with the combination of betablocker and isosorbide dinitrate (Betaket) was more effective in comparison to treatment with the individual substances.", 
    "5": "1. The action of i.v. injection of calcium gluconate on a) the release of catecholamines from the adrenals of cats and dogs, b) the adrenergic responses of circulation, nictitating membrane and spleen in cats, and c) the cardiac and circulatory response in dogs has been investigated. 2. Ca2+-effects mediated by release of catecholamines dominate in the cat, as do direct cardiac stimulating actions in the dog. 3. Ca2+-effects of therapeutic significance, if existent at all, could be assumed only with regard to an anti-anaphylactic effect of the catecholamines released by i.v. injected Ca2+.", 
    "6": "The actions on the bronchial smooth muscle and cardiovascular system S-1540 (Bitolterol) (Shionogi Pharmaceuticals), a new bronchodilator which is chemically related to isoprenaline, and S-1541 which is the active metabolite of S-1540 were studied in comparison with the action of isoprenaline (isoproterenol) and orciprenaline (metaproterenol). 1) The relaxing effect on isolated guinea-pig tracheal muscle constricted previously with histamine BaCl2 or acetylcholine was highest with S-1541, followed by isoprenaline and orciprenaline, in that order, and lowest with S-1540. The relaxing effect of S-1541 on acetylcholine-induced tracheal constriction was reduced and that of S-1540 was completely abolished by a previous treatment with propranolol. The relaxing actions of those drugs on bronchial spasms induced by histamine in vivo were highest with S-1541, followed by isoprenaline, and lowest with S-1540. 2) All these drugs exhibited the depressor and positive chronotropic actions in guinea-pigs. The potencies of the actions were found to be in the following order; isoprenaline was most potent, followed by S-1541 with a little less intensity, orciprenaline much weaker, and S-1540 still weaker with a positive chronotropic action of about 1/1000 of S-1541 and depressor action about 1/500. In the open chest guinea-pig, positive inotropic and chronotropic actions of S-1541 were about the same or slightly more potent than those of isoprenaline; S-1540 had a very weak action, being only about 1/1000 as active as S-1541. These actions of S-1540 were completely eliminated by propranolol pretreatment. S-1540 induced to remarkable changes in the electrocardiogram wave forms even in high doses. 3) Those drugs elicited the depressor, positive chronotropic and inotropic actions in rabbits and dogs. In rabbits, isoprenaline was most potent; S-1541 was similar to or a little weaker than isoprenaline; and S-1540 was extremely weak. In the dog, isoprenaline showed the highest of the above effect, followed by S-1541, orciprenaline and S-1540 in that order, with S-1540 having an extremely low activity. 4) The actions of S-1541 and isoprenaline appeared very rapidly but were of short duration, the duration of orciprenaline was moderate, and the actions of S-1540 rapidly appeared and were of an extremely long duration. It is suggested that S-1540 itself has pharmacological activities in vivo and the active metabolites such as S-1541 also have the activities. S-1540 can be administered by the oral route, is of long duration, and is thus considered to be a bronchodilator with a relative high specificity.", 
    "7": "Trapymin (TM) relaxed excised renal, coronary, pulmonary, femoral and mesenteric arteries and this relaxation was not antagonized by propranolol. The dose-response curve of TM was parallel to that of nitroglycerin and papaverine and steeper than that of dipyridamol or adenosine. TM exerted inotropic and chronotropic actions on excised rat atrium. TM was also effective through the oral route and the effectiveness tended to decrease slightly after repeated use for ten days. TM was effective on vasopressin induced angina in rats and electrocoagulation-induced myocardial infarction. TM suppressed adrenaline-induced arrhythmia but not CaCl2-induced arrhythmia. TM reduced catecholamine content in brain, adrenals and heart but had no influence on monoamine oxidase or dopamine-beta-hydroxylase. TM revealed ganglion-blocking and neuron-blocking actions in cervical ganglion in cats. With propranolol, TM-induced hyperglycemia and reduction in glycogen content in liver and heart was antagonized but TM-induced rise in free fatty acid in serum was not antagonized. Na+-K+ dependent ATPase of bovine heart and P/O ratio of mitochondria of rat heart was not influenced by TM. ADP-induced aggregation of platelets was antagonized by TM. These data indicate that TM induced coronary dilation is partly due to a papaverine like action and also to ganglion-blocking, neuron-blocking and anti-adrenergic action. On the other hand, TM possessed catecholamine release and cardiotonic action as related to beta-receptors.", 
    "8": "The paper deals with a study into the state of renal-pressor humoral factors and morphological changes in the kidneys at early stages of inception and formation of hypertensive disease. By applying the radioimmunological method of determining renin in patients with the IIA and IIB stages of the disease--two groups among them, with normal or an elevated renin activity and with its low level were recognized. In analyzing morphological features of renal tissue obtained through biopsy it was found that in 2/3 of patients with the IB and IIA stages of hypertensive disease no changes in the kidneys were demonstrable. In 1/3 of the patients there were in evidence organic alterations in the form of arteriolohyalinosis, proliferation and fibrosis of the intima, myoelastosis, myoelastofibrosis involving the media of intrarenal arteries of diverse calibre, dystrophic changes in the tubular system, partial glomerular hyalinosis, hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the juxtaglomerular apparatus.", 
    "9": "The effect of different doses of trimipramine has been studied on the force of contraction of isolated kitten atria. Trimipramine produced dose dependent increase in the force of contraction of the atria. Pretreatment of kitten with reserpine or of the isolated atria with propranolol inhibited the positive inotropic effect of trimpramine. The positive inotropic action of trimipramine is probably due to the release and /or due to blocking the uptake of spontaneously released noradrenaline. Trimipramine was also found to potentiate the positive inotropic action of noradrenaline. This potentiation not only decreased in relation to the time of exposure of the isolated atria to trimipramine but also the action of noradrenaline was antagonised.", 
    "10": "The effect of angiotensin II on heart rate of dogs were studied by intravenous and intracerebroventricular routes. Following differences were noticeable when the results obtained with intracerebroventricular were compared with those obtained after intravenous administration. The onset of tachycardia was less as compared to the intravenously administered angiotensin. The dogs required to produce tachycardia was less and the magnitude of tachycardia was also greater with intracerebroventricular administration. The initial bradycardia observed with intracerebroventricular or intravenous administration of angiotensin, could be prevented by using the mechanical buffering device. The spinal cord transection at C2 level and bilateral vagotomy abolished the tachycardia. It is speculated that angiotensin acts centrally either on the hypothalamic or medullary accelerator neurones (central sympathetic structures) and produces some degree of increased adrenegic neuron discharge which is responsible for cardiac acceleratin in dogs.", 
    "11": "Injection of angiotensin II into a lateral cerebral ventricle (I.C.V.) or into a peripheral vein of anaesthetized dog elicited a rise in blood pressure and transient bradycardia followed by sustained tachycardia. Spinal transection at C2 and bilateral vagotomy abolished the central cardiovascular effect of I.C.V. angiotensin. However, in spinal transected dogs the usual pressor response to intravenous angiotensin was observed. Since the transient bradycardia was absent in bilaterally vagotomized dogs or in dogs with their blood pressure stabilized by means of a mechanical buffer devise it must be reflex in origin. The tachycardia was more marked in vagotomized dogs. Prior administration of a beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent propranolol, blocked the tachycardia, but the pressor response was unaffected. The cardiovascular responses to centrally administered angiotensin were practically abolished by prior treatment of dogs with reserpine or by extirpation of both adrenal glands. Thus it may be concluded that ICV angiotensin induces a centrogenic release of catecholamines from the adrenal medulla which is responsible for the cardiovascular responses.", 
    "12": "Direct perfusion of the sinus node artery under a constant pressure of 100 mmHg was carried out in vagotomized dogs. \"Selective\" injection of L-3-methoxy-omega-(1-hydroxy-1-phenylisopropylamino) propiophenone hydrochloride (oxyfedrine) into the sinus node artery induced three types of chronotropic response; a pronounced sinus tachycardia, an initial bradycardia followed by sustained tachycarcia, or a definite sinus bradcardia alone. The paradoxical sinus bradycardia induced by oxyfedrine was more pronounced at higher doses of the compound, whereas it was nver produced by the injection of isoproterenol. The oxyfedrine-induced sinus tachycardia, which occurred even in reserpinized preparations, was not suppressed by the treatment with tetrodotoxin, hexamethonium or bretylium, but it was selectively inhibited by propranolol. Atropine, tetrodotoxin or hexamethonium did not prevent the occurrence of sinus bradycardia induced by oxyfedrine, and physostigmine failed to enhance the response. The present study indicates that the oxyfedrine-induced tachycardia is mediated mainly by a direct stimulating action on adrenergic beta-receptors, while the bradycardia appears to be induced by a direct depressant action on the S-A node.", 
    "13": "The antiarrhythmic effect of aprindine was compared with those of lidocaine and propranolol on several ventricular arrhythmias-epinephrine arrhythmias in cats, ouabain arrhythmias in cats and guinea pigs, ischemic ventricular arrhythmias in coronary-ligated Beagle dogs. Antiarrhythmic effects of aprindine and lidocaine were observed both in ouagain and ischemic arrhythmias, but not in epinephrine arrhythmias. While propranolol had a strong antiarrhythmic effect against epinephrine and ouabain arrhythmias, it did not increase sinus beats in ischemic arrhythmias. Marked anti-arrhythmic effects of aprindine in ischemic arrhythmias were observed in dogs using either single intravenous administration (4 mg/kg) or intravenous infusion (200 mug/kg/min, 2 mg/kg). Antiarrhythmic activity of aprindine is considered to be about twice as strong as that of lidocaine, but lidocaine is less toxic in experimental animals.", 
    "14": "Isolated middle cerebral arteries from cats and pial arteries from humans (obtained during lobe resection) were studied in a sensitive in vitro system allowing a detailed pharmacological characterization of various amine receptors and related dissociation constants. It was found that the adrenergic receptors comprise contractile (alpha) and dilatory (beta) receptors. Acetylcholine induced dilation (at low doses) as well as constriction (at high doses) both responses being inhibited in a comparative way by atropine. Experiments with selective inhibitors showed the presence of specific histamine H2 (dilatory) receptors; at high doses histamine contracted the vessels in a non-specific way. 5-Hydroxytryptamine was the most efficient vasoconstrictor agent, and the response could be blocked by the serotonin-antagonist, methysergide.", 
    "15": "The sympathetic nervous system's role in the post-vagotomy and atropin-induced tachycardia was studied in anesthetized dogs. Bilateral vagotomy was followed by 166% tachycardia while on exclusion of the heart sympathetic innervation (inderal or novocain injections into the right stellate ganglion) the bilateral vagotomy was accompanied by a considerably lesser tachycardia (33%). The i.v. atropine administration increased the heart rate by 177% whereas in the presence of inderal it increased the heart rate by 77% only. Thereupon, the post-vagotomy or atropin-induced tachycardia in anesthetized dogs was to a considerable extent associated with activation of the sympatho-adrenal system.", 
    "16": "1. In both the turtle, Pseudemys scripta, and the tortoise, Testudo graeca, lung ventilation is closely accompanied by a tachycardia of predictable magnitude and duration. 2. Efferent vagal activity progressively decreases as heart rate increases with the onset of lung ventilation. Atropine decreases heart rate during apnoea to those levels observed during prolonged breathing series when the development, duration or magnitude of ventilation tachycardia. It is thus concluded that heart rate change during chelonian lung ventilation is mediated solely by alterations in vagal tone. 3. Peripheral sensory reflexes involving pulmonary stretch receptors, arterial chemoreceptors and baroreceptors, and receptors stimulated by water immersion do not affect heart rate during breathing. It is suggested that ventilation tachycardia in these chelonians is the result of the spread of activity between the respiratory and cardiac centres of the medulla.", 
    "17": "The temperature of mixed venous blood (PA-temp) was measured in the pulmonary artery of healthy male volunteers at rest and during bicycle exercise in the supine position. Oxygen uptake, arteriovenous oxygen difference, and heart rate were determined simultaneously. The subjects were studied both in their basal normokinetic circulatory state and in a hypokinetic circulatory state induced by beta-receptor blockade with propranolol. The PA-temp increased linearly with rising oxygen uptake. During beta-receptor blockade the exercise-induced rise in PA-temp was considerably steeper in relation to work load and to oxygen uptake. Thus when the ordinary ability to increase cardiac output was suppressed by propranolol, an identical dynamic exercise induced a significantly higher PA-temp. A significant correlation (r = 0.92) was found between the rise in PA-temp during exercise and the increase in the arteriovenous oxygen difference. This correlation, which has not been described previously, was not altered by beta-receptor blockade. It is concluded that the close correlation between blood temperature and arteriovenous oxygen difference has a clinical potential for hemodynamic measurements. A simple method for the indirect estimation of arteriovenous oxygen difference by means of blood thermometry would be a considerable laboratory advantage.", 
    "18": "Rabbit hearts perfused by the Langendorff technique were studied. The addition of ovine prolactin (NIH-P-S-10) to the perfusate in a concentration of 50 ng/ml produced rapid increases in both the amplitude and rate of contraction in 33 adult male hearts studied in winter. Prepubertal male animals showed no response, and only 1 out of 12 adult females responded. Pretreatment for 10 days with 2.5 mg/day testosterone propionate led to minimal inotropic but not chronotropic responses in 2 out of 4 prepubertal males and 2 out of 4 adult females to prolactin. Clear responses to prolactin were seen in 5 adult males pretreated with reserpine. Propanolol consistently reversed both the inotropic and chronotropic actions of prolactin. The original experiments were performed in January and February. When tested in May, adult males failed to respond to prolactin and this situation, persisted until October when responsiveness again appeared. The same prolactin preparation and procedures were used throughout indicating that the changes must have been due to seasonal variations in the cardiac responsiveness to the hormone.", 
    "19": "Adrenergic beta-blocking agents were given to 7 patients with advanced congestive cardiomyopathy who had tachycardia at rest (98 plus or minus 13 beats/min). The patients were on beta-adrenergic receptor blockade for 2 to 12 months (average 5-4 months). One patient was given alprenolol 50 mg twice daily and the other patients were given practolol 50 to 400 mg twice daily. Virus infection had occurred in 6 of the patients before the onset of symptoms of cardiac disease. All patients were in a steady state or were progressively deteriorating at the start of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade. Conventional treatment with digitalis and diuretics was unaltered or reduced during treatment with beta-blocking agents. An improvement was seen in their clinical condition shortly after administration of the drugs. Continued treatment resulted in an increase in physical working capacity and a reduction of heart size. Noninvasive investigations including phonocardiogram, carotid pulse curve, apex cardiogram, and echocardiogram showed improved ventricular function in all cases. The present study indicates that adrenergic beta-blocking agents can improve heart function in at lease some patients with congestive cardiomyopathy. Furthermore, it is suggested that increased catecholamine activity may be an important factor for the development of this disease, as has been shown in animal experiments.", 
    "20": "Intravenous glucose tolerance in fasting rats was improved by phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic blocking agent, and diminished by propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent. These effects of adrenergic blockers were dependent on the action of insulin, secretion of which is controlled by an adrenergic mechanism. Epinephrine caused by hyperglycemia and impaired glucose tolerance. Both actions of epinephrine were partly inhibited by either an alpha or beta blocker and completely abolished by combination of both blockers in normal rats. However, in rats treated with anti-insulin serum or 5-methoxyindole-2-carboxylic acid, a potent inhibitor of gluconeogenesis, both actions of epinephrine were blocked by propranolol alone, but not by phentolamine. It is concluded that beta-receptor-mediated inhibiton of peripheral glucose utilization is primarily responsible for epinephrine-induced hyperglycemia and impairment of glucose tolerance. Furthermore, the reduction of glycemic action of epinephrine observed after alpha blockade is due to the hypoglycemic action of insulin secreted by the stimulation of beta receptors in pancreatic beta cells.", 
    "21": "Experiments were undertaken to investigate further the effect of furosemide on renin secretion in the anesthetized dog. To separate the effects of the macula densa and the baroreceptor mechanisms, experiments were conducted in kidneys made nonfiltering by combining 2.5 hours of renal ischemia with ureteral ligation. Furosemide, in a dose of 5 mg/kg, increased renin secretion and decreased renal resistance in dogs with a nonfiltering kidney. Prior dilation of the nonfiltering kidney with either acetylcholine or papaverine prevented changes in both resistance and renin secretion. However, following dilation of the intact filtering kidney with acetylcholine, furosemide caused an increase in renin secretion. Infusion of d,l-propranolol decreased renin secretion in both the filtering and the nonfiltering kidneys. Following propranolol treatment, furosemide increased renin secretion in the filtering kidney but had no effect on renal resistance. These experiments indicate that furosemide stimulates renin secretion by both the macula densa and the baroreceptor mechanisms. The data suggest that stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system may alter renin secretion by modulating the renal baroreceptor, but sympathetic innervation does not appear to be involved in the macula densa mechanism.", 
    "22": "Effects of l-propranolol, racemic propranolol and practolol have been determined on transmembrane potentials recorded in guinea-pig left atrium and in sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes of the rabbit heart. In addition to the voltage -time recording of the action potential, its first time derivative was displayed as a function of membrane voltage, forming a phase-plane trajectory. A number of parameters of the action potential were determined from this trajectory. At the concentrations used the beta adrenoceptor blocking agents reduced the maximum rate of rise of the atrial action potential and slowed repolarization. The velocity of the propagated spike was reduced, and the maximum ionic conductance was also reduced. The excitation potential of the propagated spike was unaffected. The membrane effects were markedly dependent on the frequency of stimulation. The beta adrenoceptor blocking agents were without effect on either the sinoatrial or atrioventricular nodes. Since the spontaneously active right atrium beats more slowly than the heart of the intact rabbit, the atrioventricular node was electrically stimulated at 5 to 6 Hz. Neither drug affected the ability of the node to follow these stimulation frequencies. The importance of these effects in the control of cardiac arrhythmias is discussed.", 
    "23": "Five patients developed posttraumatic vascular headaches associated with autonomic dysfunction. The precipitating injury affected the anterior triangle of the neck, presumably involving the region of the carotid artery sheath. Disturbance of sympathetic function, characterized by excessive sweating and pupillary dilation associated with headache, was noted. Appropriate pharmacologic studies revealed evidence of partial sympathetic devervation. While headache was resistant to ergotamine preparations, prompt relief was obtained with propranolol hydrochloride, and adrenergic beta-receptor blocking agent.", 
    "24": "Discussed here is a patient with normotension, hypokalemic alkalosis, hyperreninemia, hyperaldosteronism, juxtaglomerular cell hyperplasia and insensitivity to the pressor effects of angiotensin (Bartter's syndrome). The hyperreninemia and hyperaldosteronism were both suppressible with volume expansion. Hypokalemia was correctible both short-term with potassium chloride infusions and long-term with spironolactone. Nevertheless, the abnormal pressor response to infused angiotensin could not be corrected by these maeuvers, suggesting that this defect is likely to be of primary pathophysiologic significance. We found that potassium loading markedly stimulated aldosterone excretion. This may explain the inadequacy of potassium supplementation alone to correct the hypokalemia and the observed \"escape\" from the potassium conserving effects of spironolactone seen in patients with Bartter's syndrome. The administration of propranolol in large doses only partially suppressed the marked hyperreniemia of our patient and failed to prevent a subsequent rise in the renin level which was associated with spironolactone therapy. In contrast, suppression of the renin level to normal was demonstrated by sodium loading. It is suggested that patients with Bartter's syndrome be treated simultaneously with large doses of spironolactone and a high sodium intake.", 
    "25": "Six patients with idiopathic paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia were investigated by external electrocardiography, intracardiac electrography and pacing, exercise testing, cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography. All had normal hemodynamics and coronary arteries. His bundle electrography proved ventricular origin in five; one had no paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia during His bundle electrography. Treatment with diphenylhydantoin, 4.2 to 8.0 mg/kg/day, and propranolol, 0.8 to 2.7 mg/kg/day, appeared effective, well tolerated therapy in three, and procainamide and propranolol in one requiring medical treatment. Abstinence from tobacco and coffee abolished paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia in one of two who required no medication. The other has no recurrence of paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia since study.", 
    "26": "The vasoactive effects of cholecystokinin-octapeptide (CCK-OP), pentagastrin, synthetic secretin, glucagon, and acetylcholine were assessed in the intestinal circulation of the dog. In pharmacologic doses of glucagon, CCK-OP, and, to a lesser degree, pentagastrin significantly increased blood flow and oxygen consumption. Atropine blocked the vasodilator effects of CCK-OP, pentagastrin, and acetylcholine but did not block those of glucagon. Neither the alpha-adrenergic blocker, phenoxybenzamine, nor the beta-adrenergic blocker, propranolol, blocked the vasodilator response to pentagastrin. Synthetic secretin had no significant effect on either blood flow or oxygen consumption in the intestinal segment. The vasodilator response to CCK-OP and pentagastrin appears to be mediated specifically through cholinergic receptors.", 
    "27": "Thirteen patients with severe hypertension were treated with combined minoxidil, propranolol, and furosemide (mean daily doses 33 mg, 475 mg, and 578 mg, respectively) for nine to twenty-five months (mean 13.8). Average mean blood pressure while on aggressive therapy with conventional medication was 144 +/- 14 mm Hg; on minoxidil and propranolol it was 108 \"/- 10 mm Hg (P less thator to optimum blood pressure control and required large doses of furosemide to control. Propranolol blunted the reflex tachycardia associated with arteriolar dilator therapy but all patients continued with a clinically hyperdynamic circulation. Seven of seven had elevated ejection fractions on echocardiogram, and two of three had elevated cardiac indices. Three of three who had heart catheterization had pulmonary hypertension which was aggravated by exercise. An additional three patients on hydralazine, propranolol, and furosemide also had pulmonary hypertension suggesting this is not unique to minoxidil. Two of thirteen developed pericardial effusions. Renal function improved in three and worsened in three.", 
    "28": "The urinary excretion of catecholamines was measured in six healthy male volunteers at rest and during a fixed amount of work before and after physical training. It was found that, although training resulted in a significantly lower heart rate during exercise, the output of catecholamines was unaltered, indicating that the total activation of the sympathoadrenal system by exercise was similar before and after training. A similar heart rate study before and after training was also made during beta-adrenergic receptor blockade. Under these conditions the heart rate during exercise was not significantly changed by training. It is suggested that physical training reduces the sensitivity of the beta-receptors of the heart.", 
    "29": "An approach to the management of patients with thyroid storm is described. The treatment regimen, which is directed against the abnormalities as they are presently understood, incorporates: (a) Propranolol to inhibit the catecholamine-mediated peripheral effects of the circulating thyronines; (b) Propylthiouracil to inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis and to inhibit peripheral conversion of thyroxine to triiodothyronine (T3), the predominant source of T3 production; (c) Iodine to block the glandular release of thyroid hormones; (d) Dexamethasone along with general supportive therapy. The regimen has been used for a 13 year old schoolgirl with thyroid storm, and the induced rapid fall in serum T3 levels is illustrated. It has also been used in patients with florid thyrotoxicosis undergoing emergency surgery and has resulted in marked clinical improvement associated with rapid decreases in serum T3 levels. It is a simple and efficient regimen, rendering cumbersome forms of therapy such as plasmapheresis and peritoneal dialysis unnecessary.", 
    "30": "Cerebral vascular tonus was measurably influenced by both alpha or beta adrenergic blockade and by inhibition of cerebrovascular acetylcholine or acetylcholinesterase. Cerebral autoregulatory response was significantly affected by intravenous injection of PBZ, intravertabral and intravenous injection of PPL and intravertebral and intracarotid injection of neostigmine. Cerebral vasomotor reactivity to changes in aPCO2 was altered significantly by intravertebral injection of PPL, atropine, and neostigmine. The doses of intravenous PBZ injections were large (1.5 mg/kg) so that PBZ not only blocked peripheral alpha adrenergic receptor sites in the cerebrovascular system but probably also those possibly located in the brain stem (vertebrobasilar territory). The functional significance of a double cholinergic and adrenergic neuronal system located in the brain stem influencing CBF appears to have been established.", 
    "31": "The effects of oral practolol (Eraldin, I.C.I. Ltd) (300 mg) and acebutolol (Sectral, May & Baker Ltd) (300 mg) were compared in a placebo-controlled, crossover study in ten asthmatics. 2. Pulse rate, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and specific airways conductance were measured before and after a bronchodilator and the same procedure was repeated after taking acebutolol, practolol or placebo. 3. A mean increase in resting airways obstruction and reduction in bronchodilator response were evident with both drugs. The differences were statistically significant only after acebutolol for the logarithm of specific conductance. Mean plasma levels of the two drugs were similar. The response to both drugs was similar in the same patient and unrelated to severity of asthma. Mean reduction in resting pulse rate was statisitcally greater after acebutolol compared with placebo but not after practolol compared with placebo. 4. In any individual the beta-adrenoceptor blocking response is unpredictable and any beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug must be used with extreme caution in asthmatics.", 
    "32": "The possible role of practolol in the management of hyperthyroidism has been studied by comparing it with propranolol. 2. In a double-blind cross-over trial, propranolol (40 mg), practolol (120 mg) and a placebo four times daily for one week were compared in twenty-one hyperthyroid patients by sequential analysis. 3. Judged by their effect on the symptoms and signs of thyrotoxicosis, both propranolol and practolol were significantly better than the placebo but no clear distinction could be made between the two active compounds. 4. Propranolol and practolol reduced heart rate by 24 and 17% respectively compared with placebo. 5. Patients generally preferred propranolol or practolol to placebo but this preference did not achieve significance with either drug. 6. Only in its effect on heart rate was practolol significantly inferior to propranolol, and it would appear to be a useful alternative to propranolol in the management of the peripheral manifestations of hyperthyroidism.", 
    "33": "This study was conducted to identify and clarify the actions of pulmonary and systemic H1- and H2-receptors by utilizing specific histamine receptor antagonists. Histamine was infused in anesthetized dogs during control conditions, after H2-receptor blockade with metiamide, after H1-receptor blockade with chlorpheniramine, and after combined H1- and H2-receptor blockade. Histamine infusion, alone, induced marked systemic vasodilatation, pulmonary vasoconstriction, and transient increases in cardiac output and heart rate. H2-receptor blockade prevented the systemic vasocilatation and potentiated the pulmonary vasoconstriction induced by histamine. H1-receptor blockade augmented the systemic vasodilatation, prevented the pulmonary vasoconstriction, and increased the cardiac output and heart rate responses induced by histamine. Thus, H2-receptors appear to mediate the vasocilatation, tachycardia, and increased cardiac output induced by histamine, whereas H1-receptors appear to mediate the vasoconstrictor and the minimal cardiac depressent actions of histamine. Histamine stimulates only H1- and H2-receptors, since combined H1- and H2-receptor antagonism prevented almost all of the cardiovascular actions of histamine.", 
    "34": "Blood pressure (BP), plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma concentration of aldosterone (PA) and cortisol (PC) were determined in essential hypertensive patients before and after beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol and prindolol. Serial measurements of PRA, PA and PC at 30 min intervals (8 p.m. to 6 a.m.) were performed in 8 patients. Administration of propranolol (50 mg three times daily) over a period of 4 weeks was followed by a significant reduction in BP, PRA and PA. PC remained unaltered. The pattern of rhythmic secretion of renin was abolished whereas that of aldosterone persisted at a lower level. Prindolol (10 mg three times daily) had a similar effect on BP as propranolol but failed to lower PRA and PA. Rhythmic secretion of renin was also markedly altered with prindolol in the absence of any change in rhythmicity of PA and PC. The hypotensive action of prindolol was not mediated via inhibition of renin release. The dissociation between PRA and PA rhythmicity indicates that during beta-adrenergic blockade diurnal rhythm of aldosterone secretion is not regulated by the renin-angiotensin-system. Rhythmicity of PC was normal, indicating that also ACTH-secretion was unaltered. Thus, under beta-blockade unchanged diurnal rhythm of aldosterone may be due to normal ACTH-secretion.", 
    "35": "The effects of histamine on lipolysis and associated changes in adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) levels were examined in the isolated canine fat cell. Histamine, like norepinephrine, caused a dose-dependent increase in free fatty acid (FFA) and glycerol levels. The lipolytic response to histamine was preceded by a rise in the levels of cyclic AMP and was greatly potentiated by the addition of theophylline. In isolated canine fat cells, histamine (2 muM) caused a 7-fold increase in FFA levels. This effect was inhibited more than 50% in the presence of insulin (0.4 mmu/ml) or prostaglandin E1 (2.8 muM). In similar experiments, cyclic AMP Levels were increased 11-fold by histamine (2 muM) in the presence of 1 mM theophylline. Burimamide (0.1 mM), a histamine H2-receptor antagonist, reduced the effect of histamine (2 muM) on FFA levels as well as the effect on cyclic AMP levels greater than 95% but did not inhibit the lipolytic response to norepinephrine (2 muM). Propranolol (0.01 mM), a beta adrenergic antagonist, reduced the lipolytic response to norepinephrine by 97% but did not inhibit the effects of histamine on FFA or cyclic AMP levels. Tripelennamine and 1,5-diphenyl-3-dimethylaminopyrrolidine, histamine H1-receptor antagonists, inhibited neither the lipolytic response to histamine nor the effect on cyclic AMP levels. It was concluded that histamine induces lipolysis in canine fat cells by a mechanism involving cyclic AMP and the histamine H2-receptor.", 
    "36": "The effect of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) upon ventricular vulnerability was studied in 30 mongrel dogs subjected to varying levels of adrenergic stimulation. Vulnerability was assessed both by determining the minimum current required to produce ventricular fibrillation (VF threshold) and by plotting VF threshold throughout the vulnerable period (VF zone). Chloralose-anesthetized animals were studied by means of sequential pulses applied to the apex of the right ventricular endocardium. Testing was carried out in closed-chest dogs, in open-chest dogs with and without left stellate ganglion stimulation (LSGS), and in open- and closed-chest dogs pretreated with propranolol. In the absence of adrenergic stimulation. VNS was without significant effect on either the VF threshold or the VF zone under closed- or open-chest conditions. During LSGS, however, VNS was associated with a 93 +/- 22% (mean +/- SE) increase in VF threshold (P less than 0.01) and constriction of the VF zone. Vagus nerve stimulation combined with LSGS raised VF threshold to the control value, but not beyond. After beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol, VNS was without effect on VF threshold in either open- or closed-chest animals. It is concluded that augmented sympathetic tone is a precondition for a VNS-induced elevation in VF threshold. The vagal effect is indirect and is expressed by opposing the effects of heightened adrenergic tone on ventricular vulnerability.", 
    "37": "A four-fold transient rise in c-AMP levels was seen when sensitized guinea-pig lungs were challenged with antigen in vitro. This rise in c-AMP also occurred in vivo and was shown to be due to release of Prostaglandin E2. This conclusion is supported by the finding that inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis (Indomethacin and Poly phloretin phosphate) prevent the rise in c-AMP while neither ICI 74, 917, an inhibitor of histamine release, nor antihistamines had any effect on the c-AMP levels.", 
    "38": "This study was designed to assess the response of cyclic AMP to \"endogenous\" hormonal stimulation resulting from insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Insulin was administered to four normal subjects and four adrenalectomized patients. Hypoglycemia resulted in four-fold increases in plasma cyclic AMP. This response is thought to be secondary to beta-adrenergic stimulation for the following reasons: (1) the response was absent in adrenalectomized, cortisol-treated subjects; (2) it was abolished by propranolol; and (3) urinary excretion of cyclic AMP did not reflect the rise in plasma cyclic AMP.", 
    "39": "Agents known to affect intracellular levels of cyclic AMP in many diverse systems have been tested for their effect on the chemotaxis induced by Escherichia coli culture filtrates, spontaneous motility and cyclic AMP levels of rabbit peritoneal neutrophils. Prostaglandin E1 and A1 but not prostaglandin F2alpha increased neutrophil cyclic AMP levels and, correspondingly, only the former two prostaglandins inhibited chemotaxis. Nevertheless, a quantitative relationship between prostaglandin stimulation of cyclic AMP and inhibition of chemotaxis could not be found. Epinephrine, isoproterenol, and, to a much lesser extent, norepinephrine increased neutrophil cyclic AMP through beta adrenergic stimulation. Only epinephrine and isoproterenol inhibited chemotaxis, but the inhibition was variable and not related to the ability of these catecholamines to increase intracellular cyclic AMP. Cholera toxin increased neutrophil cyclic AMP after a 30-min lag period which paralled its inhibitory effect on chemotaxis and spontaneous motility. However, the effect on chemotaxis require 50 ng/ml of toxin whereas the effect on cyclic AMP was manifested at 2 ng/ml of toxin. Prior to 30-min preincubation there was no effect of even 1250 ng/ml of toxin on either cyclic AMP or chemotaxis. Choleragenoid prevented the effects of toxin on both cyclic AMP and chemotaxis. The bacterial chemotactic factor obtained from E. coli culture filtrates did not effect a measurable change in levels of neutrophil cyclic AMP. The data indicate that even though cyclic AMP is not, in the main sequence of events, triggering the chemotactic response, increases in neutrophil cyclic AMP may modulate the movement and thus the chemotactic responsiveness of the neutrophil.", 
    "40": "Ultrasoundcardiograms (UCG) and radiocardiograms (RCG) were obtained from 50 patients with essential hypertension. They were classified into four groups according to the severity index of Veterans Administration Hospital. These echocardiograms were compared with those obtained from 20 normal individuals. Of the 50 patients with hypertension, ten had abnormal patterns of mitral valve echogram: two had shoulder formation of the A wave (A-A'), three had increased amplitude of the A wave (A greater than E), and five had systolic anterior movement (SAM) of the anterior mitral leaflet toward the ventricular septum. The former two groups were considered to have impairment of left ventricular (LV) function proven by UCG and RCG, however, the SAM group was considered to have hyperfunction with concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle with thickened ventricular septum simulating that of idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis (IHSS). This was supported by the fact that SAM increased after inhalation of amyl nitrite and decreased after injection of propranolol. The descent rate of the anterior mitral valve decreased and the thickness of the ventricular septum increased with the severity of hypertension, indicating the LV compliance decreases as the severity of hypertension advances. A significant positive correlation was noted between stroke index (SI) obtained by UCG and RCG. There were no significant differences of LV dimensions and function indices measured by UCG and RCG among the groups classified according to the severity index of hypertension. This suggests that such factors as myocardial ischemia might play an important role in LV function as well as the grade of afterload due to hypertension.", 
    "41": "Determinations of Noradrenaline-concentrations (NA) in the myocardium of the atria and ventricles of rats were performed and the influences of Practolol and Tyramine were controlled. Following Tyramine, NA was decreased significantly in all specimens. After preinjection of Practolol, NA depletion was considerably less in the right and left atria compared to control values. By these results, the clinical observation of a preferential antiarrhythmic action of Practolol on atrial extrasystoles and tachycardias may be supported.", 
    "42": "D-glucose-6-phosphate (less than or equal to 5 x 10(-3) M), pyruvate, lactate (less than or equal to 1 X 10(-2) M), and dibutyryl cyclic AMP (less than 5 X 10(-3) M) were capable of inhibiting anapylactic histamine release in vitro from chopped guinea pig lung. In lower concentrations, pyruvic acid and lactate, as well as dibutyryl cyclic AMP, enhanced the release. Significant synergism was observed betweenpyruvate (5 X 10(-3) M) and isoproterenol (1 X 10(-8) M) in the inhibition of histamine release. The inhibitory actions of isoproterenol, glucose-6-phosphate, and pyruvate were influenced by calcium ion concentration. However, beta blockade, which diminished the isoproterenol effect, was without efect on pyruvate (1 X 10(-2) M) to the release system. Glucose-6-phosphate and isoproterenol did not have this effect. The results, together with a prevouus study, suggest that glycogenolysis may possess a role in the anaphylactic istamine release in vitro from sensitized lung fragments...", 
    "43": "In order to clarify whether or not trimetoquinol (TMQ) and isoproterenol (ISO) interact with the same receptor, the pA2 values of propranolol (PR) and certain trimethoxybenzene derivatives were measured, using isolated guinea pig tracheal chains. Each of PR, mescaline (MES) and its derivatives gave almost the same pA2 values for TMQ and ISO. Introduction of an alkyl group into the N atom of MES increased the affinity to the receptor in the order of methyl and isopropyl as well as the structureactivity relationship of catecholamines, while that of hydroxyl group in the beta-position of the side chain decreased pA2 values. The slopes of the regression lines for anti-TMQ action of MES derivatives as well as PR were almost one, but those for their anti-ISO action were less than 0.3. 3,4,5-Trimethoxyaniline and 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic acid had little activity as beta-blocking agents. These results suggest the possibility that TMQ and ISO would interact with the same receptor sites. The importance of the trimethoxybenzene and the phenethylamine moieties in the MES-derivatives for anti-TMQ action is discussed.", 
    "44": "Using the method in which leukocyte suspensions were incubated with NaF or metaproterenol at 30 degrees C for 15-30 min to allow them to convert 3H-ATP (10 muCi) to 3H-cyclic AMP, followed by separation of the formed 3H-cyclic AMP by common chromatography, the leukocyte adenyl cyclase activity of monkeys and human beings was measured with high reproducibility. The oral administration of metaproterenol increased the leukocyte adenyl cyclase activity which was stimulated by NaF and decreased the count of peripheral eosinophils in some of the monkeys. In the beta-adrenergic blockade of the monkey which was made by administration of propranolol, the leukocyte adenyl cyclase activity significantly decreased. The leukocyte adenyl cyclase from patients with coronary heart disease also decreased after oral medication with propranolol.", 
    "45": "In 27 patients with non-compensated or medically compensated chronic simple glaucoma, the I.O.P. was measured after the administration of two tablets of beta-isoket (which contain 5 mg isosorbiddinitrate and 40 mg bupranolol). In none of the 54 eyes was the I.O.P. higher after administration of the drug. On the contrary, the I.O.P. was siginificantly or highly significantly reduced for more than 2 hours, probably because of the beta-receptor-blocking component of the preparation.", 
    "46": "Catecholamines produce mitotic inhibition in primary cell cultures of human keratinocytes probably via a block in the G2 part of the cell cycle. Epinephrine produced significant mitotic inhibition (49%) at a concentration as low as 4.5 X 10(-10) M, while its analog, isoproterenol, produced 47% inhibition at 1 X 10(-10) M. Norepinephrine elicited a 49% inhibitory response at 1 X 10(-8) M. One other catecholamine, dopamine, caused a 53% decrease in mitosis at 1 X 10(-6) M. Other structurally related amines to exhibit mitotic inhibition were phenylephrine, 58% at 1 X 10(-7) M; octopamine, 47% at 1 X 10(-5) M; and tyramine, 52% at 1 X 10(-4) M. Serotonin showed no mitotic inhibition at 1 X 10(-4) M. Various alpha and beta adrenergic blocking agents were added to the cell system. The alpha blocking agent, phentolamine, had no effect on mitosis. When added in conjunction with epinephrine or norepinephrine, no reduction of the catecholamine-induced mitotic inhibition was observed. The beta blocking agent, propranolol, by itself showed slight mitotic inhibition at 1 X 10(-6) M. When added along with epinephrine or noreinephrine, propranolol reduced the catecholamine-induced mitotic inhibition approximately 65%. In addition, propranolol blocked mitotic inhibition caused by phenylephrine, an alpha adrenergic agent. However, another beta blocking agent, dichloroisoproterenol, showed strong mitotic inhibition (53%) when added to the cultures at a concentration of 1 X 10(-8) M. The effect was reduced to zero in the presence of propranolol. These data suggest that while beta receptors may be involved in the catecholamine-induced mitotic inhibition of human keratinocytes in vitro, the nature of the receptor-molecule interaction may be complex.", 
    "47": "Minoxidil in daily doses of 6 to 40 mg was administered to 11 patients with severe hypertension. Two patients died of causes unrelated to the drug and one patient withdrew from the study. Blood pressure was controlled in the remaining eight subjects, who received the drug for periods ranging from 5 to 40 months. In three patients minoxidil could subsequently be replaced by conventional antihypertensive therapy. Adverse effects of minoxidil included fluid retention (as assessed by edema and plasma volume studies), nonspecific ECG changes, hypertrichosis and conjunctival redness. Concomitant administration of diuretic and beta-adrenergic blocking agents resulted in excellent tolerance of the treatment and high patient compliance.", 
    "48": "Twenty volunteers were assessed for baseline coagulation (Thrombelastography, Factor VIII and platelet count) and fibrinolytic (Euglobulin Lysis Time and Fibrin(ogen) Degradation Products) activity two hours after ingestion of 60 mgm propranolol or an identical placebo administered on a double blind basis. The responses of these parameters to a fifteen minute period of venous occlusion was also assessed. Beta adrenergic blockade reduced baseline FDP titres but did not affect other parameters, nor the local response to venous occlusion. During occlusion no significant change in coagulation activity could be detected in the non-occluded arm, but a small but statistically significant shortening of ELT was observed. Since this effect was prevented by propranolol it is probably mediated through adrenergic mechanisms. Adrenergic stimuli appear to influence episodes of coagulation and fibrinolysis during everyday activity, but do not contribute to baseline levels of coagulation or fibrinolytic function.", 
    "49": "In a large-scale double-blind controlled trial of practolol (200 mg twice daily) in the long-term prophylactic treatment of 3038 patients recovering from acute myocardial infarction treatment was started one to four weeks after the acute attack. The trial was originally planned to include 4000 patients treated for at least a year but had to be terminated prematurely because of the serious oculocutaneous and peritoneal reactions reported elsewhere. Nevertheless, important findings, probably applicable to other beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists, have emerged in relation to mortality and morbidity. (1) The practolol-treated group showed a significant reduction in overall mortality and in sudden deaths; (2) there was a highly significant reduction in \"all cardiac events\"; (3) the reduction in overall mortality was virtually confined to patients whose original pre-entry infarcts were sited anteriorly; (4) the protective effect of practolol was most evident in those patients with pre-entry anterior infarcts whose blood pressures at entry were below the mean for the trial as a whole; (5) there were highly significant group differences in favour of the drug relating to the incidence of angina pectoris and cardiac arrhythmias, and to the numbers of patients who had to be withdrawn from the trial because of these conditions; (6) significantly more patients were withdrawn from the treatment group because of suspected adverse reactions. It is concluded that practolol used in the long-term treatment of patients who have survived the acute phase of myocardial infarction reduces the death rate when the original infarct is sited anteriorly. It is postulated that the favourable results of the trial were due to beta-adrenoreceptor blockade rather than to some other property specific to practolol itself. Since practolol produces severe side effects in long-term use it is recommended that an alternative beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agent should be used.", 
    "50": "A case is reported of a patient who developed exfoliative dermatitis while being treated with practalol for angina pectoris. The patient also had trigeminal neuropathy, renal impairment and keratoconjunctivitis sicca. The antinuclear factor was diffusely positive but other antibodies were negative. At post mortem the patient was found to have acute pancreatitis, and peritonitis. It is postulated that the patient has antecedent Sjogren's syndrome and on introduction of practalol therapy developed a drug reaction with a generalised exfoliative dermatitis and exacerbation of keratoconjunctivitis sicca leading to bilateral corneal ulceration. The association of similar conditions in patients receiving practalol therapy is reviewed.", 
    "51": "The relationship between Na+, K+-ATPase inhibition by monovalent cations and their inotropic effect was studied in guinea pig hearts. The activity of partially purified cardiac enzyme was assayed in the presence of 5.8 mM KC1 and either 20 or 150 mM NaCl. Rb+ and Tl+ inhibited Na+, K+-ATPase activity, the magnitude of the inhibition by these cations being greater in the assay media containing lower Na+ concentrations. Tl+ produced a dose-dependent inhibition of Na+, K+-ATPase activity in the presence of 20 mM Na+ and 75 mM K+, a cationic condition similar to that of intracellular fluid. Other monovalent cations such as K+, Cs+, NH4+, Na or Li+ produced essentially no effect on the Na+, K+-ATPase activity or slightly stimulated it. In left atrial strips stimulated with field electrodes and bathed in Krebs-Henseleit solution (5.8 mM K+ and 145 mM Na+), addition of Cs+ failed to alter the isometric contractile force significantly. NH4+ and K+ caused a transient positive inotropic effect which was partially blocked by propranolol. The positive inotropic response to K+ was followed by a negative inotropic response. Rb+ produced a sustained, dose-dependent inotropic response reaching a plateau at 1-2 min, whereas Tl+ produced a dose=dependent positive inotropic effect which developed slowly over a 30-min period. The positive inotropic effects produced by Rb+ and Tl+ were insensitive to propranolol pretreatment. Concentrations of Tl+ and cardiac glycosides which produce similar inotropic effects appear to cause the same degree of Na+-pump inhibition. The onset of the positive inotropic response to Rb+ or Tl+ was not dependent on the number of contractions which is in contrast to the cardiac glycoside-induced inotropic response. Substitution of 20 mM LiCl for an equimolar amount of NaCl in Krebs-Henseleit solution produced a significantly greater inotropic response than that observed when sucrose was substituted for NaCl. It appears that, among monovalent cations, only sodium pump inhibitors produce a sustained positive inotropic response."
