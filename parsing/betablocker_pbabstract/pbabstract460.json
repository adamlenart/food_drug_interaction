In vitro, membrane stretching or shear stress have been observed to activate ion channels and cell metabolism and to facilitate erythrocyte and platelet aggregation. 2. The present study was designed to evaluate the participation of shear stresses in the control of apparent platelet cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration in hypertensive patients. 3. Shear conditions and platelet cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration in vitro were studied after a dynamic perturbation induced by 3 months of double-blind treatment with one of two beta-antagonists, carteolol and atenolol. Brachial artery wall shear rate and stress were estimated by means of a pulsed Doppler velocimeter, and blood viscosity was measured by a co-axial viscometer at a shear rate of 96 s-1. Platelet cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration was simultaneously measured by using the Quin-2 fluorescent chelator. The direct effect of atenolol and carteolol on platelet cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration in vitro was also measured after addition of the beta-blockers to platelet-rich plasma. 4. Atenolol and carteolol decreased blood pressure similarly but their effects on shear rate (P less than 0.02), shear stress (P less than 0.01) and platelet cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration (P less than 0.05) differed after 3 months of therapy. In contrast, neither of the drugs significantly altered platelet cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration, in vitro per se. 5. In the overall population, strong positive correlations existed not only between changes in platelet cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration and those in shear rate (r = 0.81, P less than 0.001) and shear stress (r = 0.83, P less than 0.001), but also between their absolute values, suggesting a possible haemodynamic shear-dependent modulation of transmembrane Ca2+ transport.", 
    "1": "We used the closed cranial window technique to observe the responses of pial arterioles to topical application of cocaine in 29 anesthetized cats. Alterations in arteriolar diameter were dependent on the concentration of cocaine applied. Cocaine dissolved in artificial cerebrospinal fluid at concentrations of 10(-8) or 10(-7) M was without effect. Concentrations of 10(-6) and 10(-5) M produced dilation (4.9 +/- 1.5% [mean +/- SEM] and 5.9 +/- 2.0%, respectively) in large arterioles (greater than 100 microns) but no significant change in the diameter of small arterioles (less than 100 microns). A concentration of 10(-4) M dilated both large and small arterioles (20.3 +/- 3.1% and 12.0 +/- 7.1%, respectively). Pretreatment with 1 mg/kg i.v. propranolol blocked the increase in pial arteriolar diameter after application of 10(-4) M cocaine and produced significant vasoconstriction in small arterioles (-8.3 +/- 3.1%). Cocaine produces vasodilation of cat cerebral arterioles. This effect appears to be mediated, at least in part, by mechanisms that depend on stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "2": "It has been suggested that beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, like pindolol, are weak partial agonists for beta-adrenergic-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activation. To evaluate this possibility, beta-adrenergic-mediated chloride secretion was studied in tracheal epithelial cells maintained in primary culture. Pindolol caused a dose-dependent increase in chloride secretion with a half-maximal effective concentration of 91 pM to a maximum that was 30 +/- 3% that of isoproterenol. Pindolol-induced chloride secretion was antagonized by the beta-adrenergic antagonist nadolol. However, in contrast to isoproterenol, pindolol did not stimulate adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation, adenylyl cyclase activity, or protein kinase A activation. Further studies examined the coupling of beta-adrenergic stimulation of cAMP accumulation to beta-adrenergic stimulation of chloride secretion. Coincubation of cells with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor RA233 increased maximal isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP accumulation eightfold but did not significantly increase the potency or maximal effect of isoproterenol for chloride secretion. It is clear that beta-adrenergic-stimulated elevations in cAMP mediate chloride secretion. These studies also demonstrate that pindolol, a drug with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, mediates a beta-adrenergic receptor-specific increase in chloride secretion without increasing adenylyl cyclase nor protein kinase A activities. Thus intrinsic sympathomimetic activity may represent a non-cAMP-dependent mechanism of beta-adrenergic effect.", 
    "3": "To investigate the changes of electrocardiographic and echocardiographic indexes of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) during antihypertensive therapy, 100 hypertensive patients, mean age 46 years, were studied in pretreatment condition and during 12 months of antihypertensive therapy. In pretreatment condition, 83 patients showed LVH by echocardiography (echo; left ventricular mass index greater than 130 g/m2) and 30 patients had LVH by electrocardiography (ECG) (Sokolow index greater than 35 mm). In comparison to echo index of LVH, Sokolow index showed a sensibility of 34% and a specificity of 88%. Both LV mass echo index and ECG index significantly decreased after 3 months but in different way. LV mass index mainly decreased after 12 months, whereas Sokolow index particularly decreased after 6 months, with no further changes in the subsequent months. After 12 months of therapy, the LV mass echo index normalized in 19% of the patients (16/83) and Sokolow index normalized in 57% (17/30). ECG sensibility and specificity, in comparison to LV mass echo, was 20% and 100%, respectively. Thus, ECG appears less sensitive than echo in the detection of LVH. During antihypertensive therapy ECG index of LVH normalized more precociously and to a greater extent than the echo index. However, the normalization of LVH by ECG does not necessarily mean that a complete anatomic regression of LVH has occurred.", 
    "4": "Special considerations in the treatment of the elderly hypertensive include altered pathophysiology, the increasing likelihood of coexisting disease, and the question of whether reduction of left ventricular (LV) mass should be a therapeutic goal. The objective of our study was to compare the ability of a calcium blocker, verapamil, and a beta-blocker, atenolol, to induce reduction of LV mass and to determine the effects of any such reduction on LV filling and contractile performance. Forty-two hypertensive patients over 60 years of age were randomized to progressively increasing doses of long-acting verapamil or atenolol in a double-blind fashion and followed over a six-month period. Blood pressure decreased in both groups but atenolol-treated subjects more frequently required the addition of chlorthalidone. Despite similar blood pressure reductions, mean LV mass index, determined by two-dimensional echocardiography, was significantly reduced in the verapamil group magnitude of [104 +/- 5 g/m2 to 85 +/- 5 g/m2 (P less than 0.01)] but was not changed in the atenolol group. Following withdrawal of therapy, gated blood pool scan determined peak filling rate and the ratio of peak filling to peak ejection significantly increased in the group evidencing reduction (2.42 +/- 0.2 to 3.31 +/- 0.4 EDV/sec and 0.61 +/- 0.03 to 0.85 +/- 0.05, respectively) but did not change in the group which showed no reduction. Cardiac output and ejection fraction were maintained, both at rest and during mild upright exercise in the group evidencing reduction. Reduction of LV mass occurs more frequently with verapamil than with atenolol therapy in elderly hypertensives. Reduction improves diastolic filling and does not impair contractile performance.", 
    "5": "Left ventricular hypertrophy is an adaptation of the cardiac fibre to the imposed mechanical overload. This adaptation is quantitative; increased numbers of contractile units with decreased wall stress. Qualitative changes in genomic expression allow the hypertrophied cardiac fibre to develop a normal active tension at the expense of its maximal shortening velocity. These changes are preceded by the temporary expression of proto-oncogenes, of genes of the proteins of thermal shock and by reorganisation of the cytoskeleton, all possible candidates of the regulation of the gene expression in cardiac hypertrophy. In the long-term, the hypertrophy becomes harmful: inadequate subendocardial vascular development; the lowering of the Vmax is beneficial at cellular level but eventually affects cardiac output; ventricular compliance decreases with the development of fibrosis; changes in calcium metabolism are arrhythmogenic. Modifying, prolonging and improving the natural process of adaptation is clearly the first therapeutic objective in order to decrease the hypertension and cause the hypertrophy to regress. Propranolol acts by reducing the cardiac work load. However, betablockers have the disadvantage of increasing the relative density of the subendocardial collagen. Rilmenidine decreases the quantity and density of the collagen. Vasodilators and diuretics induce regression of the myocytic hypertrophy by lowering the threshold of adaptation of these cells, but they have no effect on collagen synthesis. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors which have been shown to be beneficial in controlling hypertension, induce a decrease in the hypertrophy of the myocytes and reduce fibrosis.", 
    "6": "Forty-seven male patients with mild essential hypertension were randomly allocated to three subgroups. After a run-in period of 4 weeks, the first subgroup (n = 16) received propranolol (80 mg/day) for 36 weeks followed by a placebo period of 4 weeks. The second subgroup (n = 15), after a run-in period of 4 weeks, was given a supplement of encapsulated fish oil (9 g/day) for 36 weeks with a subsequent period of 4 weeks in which fish oil placebo was given. The third subgroup (n = 16), after a run-in period of 4 weeks, was given propranolol (80 mg/day) for 12 weeks, propranolol (80 mg/day) plus fish oil capsules (9 g/day equivalent to 1.8 g/day of eicosapentaenoic acid and 1.1 g/day of docosahexaenoic acid) for 12 weeks, propranolol plus fish oil placebo (same doses for 12 weeks) with a subsequent period of 4 weeks when propranolol placebo was administered. The results indicate a blood pressure-lowering effect of fish oil, which was comparable with that of propranolol. The simultaneous intake of fish oil plus propranolol was more effective than propranolol or fish oil alone. Propranolol treatment resulted in a decrease of plasma norepinephrine, plasma renin activity, and thromboxane B2 formation. After fish oil supplementation, plasma norepinephrine and thromboxane B2 formation were likewise reduced, whereas plasma renin activity appeared increased. The decrease of serum triglycerides, total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol as well as the rise of high density lipoprotein cholesterol are concomitant beneficial effects, which justify the consideration of fish oil alone or in combination with antihypertensive drugs for the treatment of mild hypertension.",

    "8": "Episodes of transient myocardial ischemia during ambulatory activities are common in patients with stable coronary artery disease and who are often asymptomatic. Selection of therapy for episodes of asymptomatic ischemia is limited by a lack of direct comparative studies. To determine the most effective monotherapy for patients with stable angina and a high frequency of asymptomatic ischemic episodes, propranolol-LA (mean daily dose, 293 mg), diltiazem-SR (mean daily dose, 350 mg), nifedipine (mean daily dose, 79 mg) were each compared with placebo, each for 2 weeks, in a randomized, double-blinded, crossover trial. Entry criteria were a positive exercise treadmill test during placebo therapy characterized by 1.0 mm or more ST segment depression and angina pectoris, and six or more episodes of transient ST segment depression of 1.0 mm or more on a 48-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram. One hundred ninety-four patients were screened, 63 were eligible and received randomized therapy, of which 56 patients completed at least two of the four treatment periods and were included in an intent-to-treat analysis. Fifty patients completed all four treatment phases and were included in the protocol-completed analysis. Anti-ischemia efficacy was assessed by 48-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, exercise treadmill tests, and anginal diaries. Ninety-four percent of all episodes of ambulatory ischemia were asymptomatic. Compared with placebo, only propranolol was associated with a marked reduction in all manifestations of asymptomatic ischemia during ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring (2.3 versus 1.0 episodes/24 hr; mean duration of ischemia per 24 hours, 43.6 versus 5.7 minutes; both p less than 0.0001). Diltiazem's reduction of the frequency of episodes compared with placebo (2.3 versus 1.9 episodes/24 hr) was associated with a trend (p = 0.08) in the protocol-completed analysis and with a significant reduction in the intent-to-treat analysis (p = 0.03). Nifedipine had no significant effect on any measured variable of ambulatory ischemia. The dosages of medication used may have been excessive for some patients, and a more beneficial effect may have been evident at a lower dose. In contrast to the marked effects of the active agents on ambulatory asymptomatic ischemia, the effects on exercise performance and angina pectoris were slight. The active agents modestly improved treadmill exercise duration time until 1 mm ST segment depression (3%), and only propranolol and diltiazem had significant effects. Only diltiazem significantly prolonged the total exercise time. Anginal frequency was significantly decreased by both propranolol and diltiazem.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "9": "To decide whether distension of the urinary bladder reflexly affects the left ventricular inotropic state, experiments were performed in eight dogs anesthetized with pentobarbitone. After cannulation of both ureters the urinary bladder was repeatedly distended through a urethral catheter with warm Ringer solution at a steady intravesical pressure. The maximal rate of rise of left ventricular pressure (dP/dtmax) obtained at constant heart rate and cardiovascular pressures was used to assess changes in left ventricular inotropic state. Arterial blood pressure was prevented from changing by a pressurized reservoir containing warm Ringer solution and connected to the femoral arteries. Following prevention of the reflex increase in heart rate by atrial pacing, distension of the urinary bladder always increased the maximal rate of rise of left ventricular pressure in the eight dogs. There were no significant changes in left ventricular systolic or end-diastolic pressures. The increase in maximal rate of rise of left ventricular pressure was abolished following the administration of propranolol. The results indicate that a reflex increase in left ventricular inotropic state occurred in response to distension of the urinary bladder. This reflex response involved beta-adrenergic stimulation.",

Prolonged resuscitation was required, and she remained in severe cardiogenic shock, despite high doses of positive inotropic agents. Massive beta-adrenoceptor blocker overdose was suspected (and subsequently confirmed). IV administration of glucagon was followed by prompt haemodynamic improvement and recovery, illustrating the beneficial role of glucagon in overwhelming beta-adrenoceptor blockade.", 
    "11": "Metoprolol was examined for its effects on clinical manifestations of the disease, peripheral hemodynamic and myocardial contractile parameters in 46 patients with coronary heart disease. The examination was performed during an acute drug test and continuous treatment for 4 weeks. The efficiency of the therapy was monitored by conventional clinical tools, bicycle ergometric test, studies of intracardiac hemodynamic parameters from echocardiographic evidence. With metoprolol, its antianginal effect was attained in 67.5% of the patients, there were significant antihypertensive and negative chronotropic effects and moderate cardiodepressive action.", 
    "12": "Carvedilol, a combined beta- and alpha 1-blocking drug, was given to 8 young (age 39-47) and 21 old (age 64-79) patients with essential hypertension. Clinical and pharmacokinetic responses to 12.5, 25 and 50 mg were determined and compared. In both age groups, pharmacokinetic data were similar with all three doses of carvedilol. Peak blood levels were reached within 90 minutes and at 24 hours the trough blood level was less than 10% of the peak level. Carvedilol or its metabolite did not accumulate. Falls in systolic and diastolic BP were greater than 7 mmHg in 28 of the 29 patients. The falls in diastolic BP did not differ between groups but the older group had a greater fall in systolic BP. However, the systolic BP of the older group was higher and expressed as a percentage, the falls in BP did not differ. The time to peak fall in BP was about 4 hours and was always after the time to peak blood level. There was no correlation between blood level and BP fall. When the drug was administered 24 h after the previous dose, a further fall in BP was seen indicating a greater effect at peak drug levels. Side effects were few and, during the chronic study, there was no postural hypotension or postural hypotensive symptoms. On the study days, five patients developed postural hypotension with symptoms. These were not observed at other times and may have been due to decreased sympathetic outflow on the study days. Carvedilol lowered BP in order and younger patients. There were no significant effects of age on its pharmacokinetics. Carvedilol is an effective antihypertensive agent that can be used in people with essential hypertension in all age groups.", 
    "13": "The effects of propranolol and diltiazem on left ventricular systolic and diastolic function in hypertensive subjects (DBP 90-114 mmHg) were examined with M-mode and 2D echocardiograms in 21 patients in a double-blind fashion prior to and after 4 months of treatment. Systolic function was assessed by measurement of fractional shortening, mean velocity of fibre shortening, peak systolic pressure/end systolic dimension ratio, and end systolic stress/end systolic dimension ratio. To assess diastolic function, maximal rate of change in left ventricular dimension (MAXD), maximal rate of change in posterior wall thinning (MAX PWT) and early diastolic (EDD) and late diastolic dimension changes (LDD) were calculated using digitised M-mode images of mid-wall diameter. Both propranolol and diltiazem reduced systolic and diastolic pressures similarly. No significant changes were observed in any of the parameters of systolic function with either drug. Similarly neither propranolol nor diltiazem altered MAXD or EDD significantly. Although changes in maximal rate of posterior wall thinning (MAX PWT) were not significant with either drug, diltiazem improved MAX PWT in 7 of 8 patients. The results of the study demonstrate that both propranolol and diltiazem reduce blood pressure without significant deleterious effects on systolic or diastolic function. Diastolic functional parameters, which were not abnormal at baseline, showed no consistent change with either propranolol or diltiazem.", 
    "14": "A 0.5% Timoptic was used in 37 patients with a keratoconus during 2 weeks, one drop twice a day to both eyes; the day measurements of the intraocular pressure were subsequently repeated. The mean upper value of P after drops was 14.595 +/- 2.522 mm Hg for the R. eye and 14.139 +/- 2.113 mm Hg for the L. eye. The mean day oscillations in the R. eye amounted 3.378 +/- 1.441 mm Hg and in the L. eye 3.333 +/- 1.042 mm Hg. The differences in daily oscillations of P before and after drops were statistically significant. After excluding from the analysis 4 patients who did not react to Timoptic one compared 12 eyes in which the objective improvement was evident with 21 eyes without improvement. These two groups differed in respect of daily oscillations of P before application of the drops--p less than 0.004.",

We report a patient with a norepinephrine-secreting extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma who had exercise induced ventricular tachycardia. Prior to diagnosis, the patient was treated with a selective beta 1 blocker, atenolol, which resulted in suppression of the dysrhythmia and amelioration of the hypertension. This is the first reported case of selective beta blockade suppressing ventricular tachycardia in a patient with a pheochromocytoma. Electrocardiographic abnormalities described in patients with pheochromocytoma are reviewed.", 
    "16": "The acute effects of consuming alcohol after a single oral dose of 200 mg of metoprolol or placebo were examined in eight healthy men in a randomized, controlled study. Alcohol, in a dose of 0.75 g/kg body weight, did not abolish the antihypertensive effect of metoprolol upon supine systolic blood pressure. The interaction of alcohol with antihypertensive drugs requires further investigation as hypertensive patients who consume alcohol regularly are known to have less adequate blood pressure control.", 
    "17": "In the present study we have compared the effect of intravenous infusion of a calcium channel blocker, nifedipine (1.0 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 for 20 min), with that of isoproterenol (0.1 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 for 20 min) on the hemodynamic parameters and the vascular response of different locations and tissue layers of the gastrointestinal tract. Heart rate increased with isoproterenol but not with nifedipine. Both agents caused a similar increase in cardiac output and a similar fall in mean arterial pressure. After 20 min infusion, nifedipine increased the blood flow of the axillary artery, but isoproterenol had no such effect. Isoproterenol caused vasodilation of the mucosa in the antrum but not in the fundus and the body of the stomach or in the duodenum, jejunum, mid small intestine, ileum, and colon. The mucosal effect of nifedipine was similar, except that it also caused vasodilation in the small bowel and in the ascending colon. Nifedipine caused vasodilation of the muscularis throughout the gastrointestinal tract, but isoproterenol had no such effect. These differences are discussed in relation to the mechanism of action of these two vasodilators. It is suggested that the vascular response of different locations and tissue layers of the gastrointestinal tract to vasodilators is locally regulated by a variety of mechanisms may include beta- and alpha-receptor density and (or) sensitivity, angiotensin II activity, and metabolic need of the tissues.", 
    "18": "1. The effects of drugs and altering stimulus parameters on neurogenic responses to electrical field stimulation (EFS) have been investigated in distal and proximal portions of the guinea-pig trachea. 2. In the presence of indomethacin (3 microM) and propranolol (1 microM) two contractile phases were evident in both the proximal and distal trachea. The first rapid phase was abolished by atropine (0.1 microM), whereas the prolonged, second phase was abolished by capsaicin (10 microM) pretreatment. Tetrodotoxin (3 microM) abolished the initial response and greatly inhibited the second phase. In proximal trachea this second phase was evident only in 9 of 22 preparations. The addition of the peptidase inhibitor thiorphan (10 microM) however, caused a second phase to be seen in all the proximal tissues examined. 3. The two phases of the contractions to EFS were differentially sensitive to the pulse duration applied. The initial, cholinergic contractions were evident at lower pulse durations than were the prolonged capsaicin-sensitive contractions, with the first phase being approximately 10 fold more sensitive than the second phase. 4. The magnitude of the capsaicin-sensitive contraction to EFS was significantly greater in the distal trachea than in the proximal trachea. This difference prevailed in the presence of thiorphan, an inhibitor of neutral endopeptidase. In contrast, concentration-response curves to capsaicin were similar in segments of proximal and distal trachea. 5. The non-adrenergic non-cholinergic (NANC) relaxant responses were studied in tissues in which excitatory neurogenic responses were pharmacologically abolished by capsaicin and atropine treatment. The NANC relaxant responses in the proximal trachea were evident at lower pulse frequencies and were of greater magnitude compared with NANC relaxant responses in the distal trachea. 6. These results indicate that, by pharmacologically manipulating the trachea and by selecting optimum stimulation parameters, a NANC contractile response to EFS can be seen throughout the length of the guinea-pig trachea. This NANC response is most likely to be due to the release of tachykinins from capsaicin-sensitive sensory fibres. It is suggested that NANC relaxant responses mask NANC contractile responses especially in the proximal trachea where NANC relaxant responses predominate.", 
    "19": "We report the cases of three elderly patients presenting with insidious mental impairment whilst receiving both lipophilic and hydrophilic beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents (propranolol and atenolol respectively). In each case marked improvement occurred on drug withdrawal. Two of our cases probably had early senile dementia of the Alzheimer's type and continued to exhibit signs of mild mental impairment, but the third was restored to normal functioning. We found no evidence of impaired perfusion to suggest a vascular basis for the effect or of depression. We believe that beta-blockade may cause or exacerbate mental impairment in the elderly.", 
    "20": "In experiments on white rats, guinea pigs and cats it was shown that preliminary infusion of propranolol sharply increases the edemagenous lungs sensitiveness to the infusion of exogenous norepinephrine of white rats and guinea pigs. The infusion of the propranolol to cats leads to a decrease of volume blood flow velocity in the pulmonary artery with the simultaneous difficulty of the outflow in pulmonary veins and to increase of hydrostatic pressure in the lesser circulation. The infusion on that background of epinephrine called the development of temporary sharp hearts failure with the sharp increase of the pressure in pulmonary artery (to 196%) and systemic pressure.", 
    "21": "Intravenous nicardipine, 5 mg, was administered in two comparable groups of eight patients with chronic coronary artery disease but no clinical signs of heart failure. One group had received no previous treatment and served as a control group, and the other had received long-term treatment with large oral doses of propranolol. Blood concentrations of nicardipine were higher, and the area under the plasma concentration curve was greater in the group previously treated by propranolol. The total clearance of nicardipine was decreased in patients taking propranolol, without a change in the half-life of the drug. Typical hemodynamic responses, namely, a decrease in aortic pressure and in arterial resistances, were greater and more lasting in patients previously treated orally by propranolol. Filling pressure remained stable in both groups. The nicardipine infusion did not induce signs of dromotropic or inotropic negative effects in either group. The greater and more lasting hemodynamic effects of nicardipine in the group previously treated orally by propranolol do not seem to be related to an overall hemodynamic action of propranolol, but are probably due to higher nicardipine plasma levels, and may be caused by a decrease in hepatic blood flow induced by propranolol, with a consequent decrease in nicardipine clearance and by a smaller nicardipine volume of distribution in the propranolol group.", 
    "22": "The aim of this study was to evaluate retrospectively the outcome of 101 patients who were assigned to long-term therapy with propranolol (55 patients) or verapamil (46 patients) between 1980 and 1988. Baseline clinical, electrocardiographic, and echocardiographic data were similar in both groups. Exclusion criteria were the evidence of complex ventricular arrhythmias, a family history of the disease and/or sudden death, previous syncopal episodes, or left ventricular dysfunction. During a mean follow-up of 4 +/- 3 years (range: 1-9 years), side effects were more commonly recorded in patients who were treated with verapamil rather than in propranolol-treated patients (8 vs. 3, respectively), though the difference was not statistically significant. Sixteen patients (13 propranolol-treated patients and three verapamil-treated ones, p less than 0.05) died suddenly while on treatment. In addition, three patients who stopped verapamil because of adverse reactions died from heart failure after withdrawal, but before the end of the follow-up period. The assessment of total mortality on the intention-to-treat basis showed that death due to cardiac causes occurred in 13 propranolol-treated patients and in six verapamil-treated patients (ns). Thus, verapamil was more effective than propranolol in preventing sudden death during long-term therapy of \"low-risk\" patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, though its administration was associated with the occurrence of non-sudden cardiac deaths and a high incidence of side effects.", 
    "23": "This study was designed to investigate the effect of propranolol on endothelin (ET)-1-induced increase in cytosolic Ca2+ [( CA2+]i) in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) obtained from rat aorta. Propranolol (0.01 to 1 mmol/L) reduced the changes in the initial transient and the later sustained phase of [Ca2+]i induced by 100 nmol/L ET-1 as well as 10 mmol/L procaine. The inhibitory action of propranolol on the change in [Ca2+]i induced by ET-1 may be involved in one of the mechanisms of propranolol-induced reduction of vasospasms.", 
    "24": "The effects of a series of fatty acids on the percutaneous absorption of propranolol (PL) through rabbit skin and the mechanism by which fatty acids facilitate the skin penetration of PL were examined in vitro and in vivo using a gel base. Lauric and myristic acids, at the fatty acid:PL molar ratio of 1:1 were the most potent agents in increasing the skin penetration, giving the largest penetration rate (Js) and penetration coefficient (Kp) of PL. The molar ratio of 2:1 also exerted a large enhancing effect, comparable to that with a molar ratio of 1:1. When the enhancing effects of lauric acid, its amide, and its methyl ester were compared, the free acid gave the highest Js and Kp values. The plasma PL concentrations were significantly higher and more sustained after a single percutaneous application of the formulation with lauric acid than those after the formulation without the acid. The mechanism for the enhancing effect was examined by measuring IR and 13C NMR spectra, the solubility in buffer, and the apparent partition coefficient of PL. Additionally, the penetration of PL and lauric acid, as co-penetrants, through rabbit skin and shed snake skin were evaluated. The IR spectra of the mixture of PL with lauric acid (molar ratio, 1:1) was characterized by an extreme shift of the CO peak. Comparison of the NMR spectra of PL, lauric acid, and the mixture suggested that the carbonyl group of lauric acid interacted with the amino and hydroxyl groups of PL, probably by charge interaction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "25": "The clinical efficacy of combination therapy with mexiletine and propranolol was investigated in several centres. Twenty-four-hour Holter electrocardiograms were recorded and the severity of ventricular premature beats (VPBs) was assessed on the basis of the frequency of VPBs and according to the criteria of Lown. Forty-eight cases with VPBs received single treatment with mexiletine (300 mg/day). Single treatment with mexiletine was effective in 26 out of 48 cases (54%). Nineteen cases in which the single treatment with mexiletine was not sufficiently effective received combination therapy with mexiletine (300 mg/day) and a low dose of propranolol (30 mg/day). After the combination therapy, significant decreases in the frequency of VPBs were found in 11 out of 19 cases (58%), and lowering of the severity of the grade was found in 4 cases (30.8%). Thirteen out of 19 cases given combination therapy changed to single treatment with propranolol. A change in treatment from combination therapy to single treatment with propranolol was assessed as \"undesirable\" in 8 out of 13 cases (61.5%). During single treatment with mexiletine, side effects were found in 1 out of 48 cases (2.1%), and during the combination therapy in 1 out of 19 cases (5.2%). Thus, combination therapy with mexiletine and a low dose of propranolol was shown to be useful for patients with VPBs.",

In the present study, acetone extract of ginger at 100 mg/kg p.o. significantly inhibited serotonin (5-HT) induced hypothermia. Therefore, the active constituents of ginger were further examined. The acetone extract was functioned into 4 fractions by column chromatography. Fractions 1 and 2 showed significant activity. Fraction 2 was further purified and [6]-shogaol which was obtained from fraction 2-2, at 10 mg/kg p.o. was shown to inhibit 5-HT induced hypothermia. Anticathartic activity is known to be one of the medicinal effects of ginger. In the present study, acetone extract of ginger at 75 mg/kg p.o., significantly inhibited 5-HT induced diarrhea. In order to clarify the active constituents, the acetone extract was fractionated into 4 fractions by silica gel chromatography. Fractions 2 and 3, which was especially effective, were further purified and [6]-shogoal, [6]-dehydrogingerdione, [8]- and [10]-gingerol were found to have an anticathartic action.

In order to investigate the alterations of esmolol metabolism by hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), the effect of temperature on the metabolism of esmolol in vitro was determined. Samples of human whole blood were combined with esmolol solution (50 micrograms/mL in 0.9 mol/L NaCl) and incubated at 4 degrees C, 15 degrees C, 25 degrees C, and 37 degrees C. Aliquots were sampled at 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, and 120 minutes; esmolol concentration was determined using high-pressure liquid chromatography. There was a temperature-dependent decrease in the degradation of esmolol. The half-life for esmolol in human blood was 19.6 +/- 3.8 minutes at 37 degrees C, 47 +/- 10.1 minutes at 25 degrees C, 152 +/- 46.6 minutes at 15 degrees C, and 226.7 +/- 60.1 minutes at 4 degrees C. This study clearly shows marked reduction of esmolol metabolism with hypothermia possibly leading to persistent beta-adrenergic blockade following the discontinuation of CPB. Persistent beta-blockade may provide additional protection to the ischemic myocardium during hypothermic arrest and/or result in difficulty in weaning from CPB.", 
    "28": "The effect of cholinergic and adrenergic influences on pancreatic polypeptide (PP) release was studied in dogs. Administration of acetylcholine resulted in an elevation of plasma PP, whereas epinephrine induced no increase. Insulin-induced hypoglycemia increased plasma PP in a conscious state but not in anesthetized dogs. The infusion of phentolamine or propranolol did not affect the response of plasma PP to insulin-induced hypoglycemia, whereas atropine markedly inhibited the increase in plasma PP. Likewise, atropine reduced the rise of plasma PP during the intravenous administration of 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG). We conclude from the present experiments that cholinergic mechanisms are of major importance in the response of PP to insulin- and 2-DG-induced glucoprivation, while the major role of the adrenergic mechanism was not proved.",

Percentage narrowing of the major epicardial coronary artery was used as an indicator of constriction of the large coronary arteries, and the time required for the contrast medium to reach the posterior descending coronary artery from the ostium of the right coronary artery (blood flow delay) was used as an indicator of constriction of the small coronary arteries.",

    "32": "A marked blood flow delay of over 7.0 s (control: less than or equal to 1.8 s) with less than 34% narrowing of the epicardial major coronary artery was observed in 13 of 15 pigs with 12.5-50 micrograms of acetylcholine, and in the other two pigs with 100 micrograms of acetylcholine. When marked blood flow delay occurred, the perfused right ventricular myocardium became macroscopically anaemic (ischaemic). Over 75% narrowing of the major epicardial coronary artery was induced in six of the 15 pigs, and over 50% narrowing in 12, with marked blood flow delay with 100 to 200 micrograms of acetylcholine. However, after intracoronary infusion of 10 micrograms of nipradilol, acetylcholine induced narrowing in the epicardial major coronary artery was significantly reduced from 44-79% in control to 19-37% despite 200 micrograms of acetylcholine, though the time delay in coronary blood flow did not change significantly. By pretreatment with intracoronary isosorbide dinitrate (2.5 mg), the percent narrowing of the large coronary artery and the time delay in coronary blood flow were significantly reduced (narrowing from 32-84% to 10-27%; time delay from 7.6-41.6 s to 2.7-22.7 s). Pretreatment with intracoronary bunazosin, an alpha 1 adrenoceptor antagonist (100 micrograms), showed no protective effect on narrowing of the epicardial major coronary artery or blood flow delay.",

    "34": "In congestive heart failure (CHF) the beta-adrenoceptor density and functional responsiveness is markedly reduced presumably due to endogenous down-regulation. In the last few years evidence has accumulated that betablockers therapy can improve clinical condition in selected patients with CHF. To evaluate sympathetic response in CHF we measured hemodynamic effects of cold pressor test. This study was composed by 20 patients, 10 with CHF of different origin and 10 healthy volunteers. They were divided into 4 groups in relation to therapy. We evaluated the modification of the following hemodynamic parameters during cold pressor test: heart rate, mean arterial pressure, mean pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, right atrial pressure, cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance, pulmonary vascular resistance. In normal subjects we observed hemodynamic modification of heart rate, mean arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance according to many other Authors. In atenolol-treated subjects the sympathetic response is strongly attenuated. Patients with CHF not treated with betablockers showed an increase in heart rate and in systemic vascular resistance and a reduction of cardiac index. Chronic treatment with atenolol did not modify heart rate response to cold pressor test. The mean arterial pressure increased while the systemic vascular resistance did not show any significant modification. We observed a trend to increase of the cardiac index; this could explain the beneficial effect of betablockers therapy in selected patients.", 
    "35": "The pharmacokinetics of pafenolol were studied in eight young healthy individuals. The doses were 10 mg iv and 40 mg orally. Each dose was labeled with 100 microCi [3H]pafenolol. The plasma concentration-time curve of the oral dose exhibited dual maxima. The second peak was about four times higher than the first one. Maximum concentrations were attained after 0.9 +/- 0.2 and 3.7 +/- 0.6 hr. The mean bioavailability (F) of the oral dose was 27.5 +/- 15.5%. The reduction in F was due mainly to incomplete gastrointestinal absorption. The drug was rapidly distributed to extravascular sites; t1/2 lambda 1 was 6.6 +/- 1.8 min. The volumes of distribution were Vc = 0.22 +/- 0.08 liter/kg, Vss = 0.94 +/- 0.17 liter/kg, and Vz = 1.1 +/- 0.16 liters/kg. The iv dose of pafenolol was excreted in unchanged form in the urine to 55.6 +/- 5.1% of the given dose and in the feces to 23.8 +/- 5.7% within 72 hr. The corresponding recoveries of the oral dose were 15.8 +/- 5.9 and 67.0 +/- 10.2%, respectively. About 10% of both doses was recovered as metabolites in the excreta. Approximately 6% of the oral dose was metabolized to nonabsorbable compounds in the intestine. The mean total plasma clearance was 294 +/- 57 ml/min, of which renal clearance, metabolic clearance, and gastrointestinal and/or biliary clearance were responsible for 165 +/- 31, 31 +/- 15, and 95 +/- 32 ml/min, respectively. The half-life of the terminal phase determined from plasma levels up to 24 hr after dosing was 3.1 +/- 0.3 hr for the iv dose and 6.7 +/- 0.7 hr for the oral dose.", 
    "36": "The bulk of the mortality (60%) in hypertension occurs in those with mild to moderate elevations of blood pressure, and the chief hazard is coronary disease. Although progression in the severity of hypertension has been slowed with drug therapy, the benefits for coronary outcome and all-cause mortality have been equivocal. Only a 10% reduction in coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality has been shown, an improvement that is not only small, but is statistically insignificant. Only vascular events such as renal failure, stroke, aortic dissection and cardiac failure have been reduced by antihypertensive therapy. Recent trials comparing beta-blockers with other antihypertensive drugs have failed to show the expected promise based on their effectiveness following a myocardial infarction. However, two large trials suggest that they may be effective against coronary heart disease in male non-smokers. A number of possible reasons for this therapeutic failure to reduce coronary heart disease have been postulated. The trials may have been too short to significantly affect the atherosclerotic progression. Also, sample sizes were too small to detect a sizeable reduction in coronary heart disease events. Furthermore, no attention was paid to improvements in the coronary heart disease risk profile, since drugs currently in use are known to have adverse effects on blood lipids, glucose tolerance and uric acid. It is even possible that a predisposition to sudden death is associated with antihypertensive therapy. The trials suggest that in attempts to prevent coronary heart disease, control of smoking and of serum lipids are particularly important in hypertensive persons and may be more effective than controlling the blood pressure alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "37": "1. The effects of treatment with bromoacetylalprenololmenthane (BAAM), an irreversible beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, for 30 min on the contractile responses of the rat left atria and portal vein have been determined. 2. On the electrically driven rat left atria, BAAM at 10(-5) M followed by a 60-min wash-out caused parallel rightward shifts of the isoprenaline response curves with no reduction in the maximal response to isoprenaline. 3. Treatment of the atria with BAAM at 3 x 10(-5) M caused non-parallel rightward shifts of isoprenaline response curves with a reduction in the maximum response to isoprenaline. The KA (dissociation constant) for isoprenaline at beta 1-adrenoceptors was 7.3 x 10(-7) M. Calculation of receptor occupancy demonstrated that in order to produce a maximal response of the rat left atria, isoprenaline had to occupy 12% of the beta 1-adrenoceptors. 4. Treatment of the atria with higher concentrations of BAAM (greater than or equal to 6 x 10(-5) M) caused a non-specific action, the reduction of the response to electrical stimulation. 5. On the rat portal vein, BAAM at 3 x 10(-7)-3 x 10(-6) M followed by a 45-min wash-out had no effect on the spontaneous contractile activity, caused non-parallel rightward shifts of isoprenaline response curves with a depression of the isoprenaline maximum responses. Using data derived from experiments with 3 x 10(-7), 10(-6) and 3 x 10(-6) M BAAM, the KA for isoprenaline at beta 2-adrenoceptor was 6.4, 3.7 and 7.7 x 10(-7) M and the calculated receptor occupancy was that in order to produce a maximal response of the rat portal vein, isoprenaline had to occupy 14, 21 and 12%, respectively of the beta 2-adrenoceptors. 6. The present study with the rat left atria and portal vein has shown that it is possible to determine treatments with BAAM that produce no non-specific actions and consequently BAAM may be used as an experimental tool in KA and receptor occupancy determinations in these tissues.", 
    "38": "1. Isolated preparations of segments of rat jejunum were set up for isotonic recording of the activity of the longitudinal smooth muscle and the extrinsic nerve supply running with the mesenteric blood vessels was stimulated for 30-s periods at 0.5-20 Hz. 2. Contractions were regularly elicited during periods of stimulation at 0.5-2 Hz, and were usually elicited during stimulation at 5 Hz, but relaxations were usually elicited during stimulation at 10 and 20 Hz. On cessation of the period of stimulation, a secondary contraction occurred in most preparations regardless of whether the primary response during the period of stimulation had been a contraction or a relaxation. 3. Tetrodotoxin (0.9 microM) abolished responses during periods of stimulation and the secondary contraction. 4. The relaxations were mimicked by noradrenaline and were abolished by blockade of alpha- plus beta-adrenoceptors but were not affected by hexamethonium, indicating that they are attributable to stimulation of postganglionic noradrenergic fibres. 5. The contractions were mimicked by acetylcholine and were abolished by atropine and hexamethonium, suggesting that they are attributable to stimulation of preganglionic cholinergic nerves: they were also abolished in the presence of capsaicin, indicating that sensory neuropeptide-containing nerve fibres may be involved. 6. The secondary contraction that usually occurred on cessation of stimulation was still present after blockade by atropine or capsaicin of the contractions occurring during stimulation. It was also present after blockade by propranolol and phentolamine of the relaxations occurring during stimulation, and was not affected by indomethacin.", 
    "39": "The synthesis of two kinds of propranolol analogues, A and B, with a rigid skeleton was investigated. The compounds were designed to help identify the conformation involved in beta-adrenergic receptor-propranolol interaction. The key intermediate, 2-hydroxy.2,3-dihydronaphtho[1,8-bc]pyran (5), was obtained starting from acenaphthenone (1). On sequential dehydration, hydroboration, and oxidation, 5 gave 2,3-dihydronaphtho[1,8-bc]pyran-3-one (8), which was converted to compound A. Compound 5 was also derived to 2-formyl-2,3-dihydronaphtho[1,8-bc]pyran (13) via the 2-vinyl compound (12). Condensation of nitromethane with 13 followed by reduction and alkylation produced the desired compound B. The beta-blocking activities of A and B were examined.",

    "42": "The effects of a combined treatment with supraphysiological doses of the thyroid hormone T3 (15 micrograms/kg BW/day, s.c.) and high doses of a predominant beta 1-blocker (atenolol, 12.5 and 25 mg/kg BW, 3X/day, s.c.) or a non-specific beta-blocker (propranolol, 5 mg/kg BW s.c. and 33 mg/kg BW p.o., each 3X/day) on energy intake, body composition and the heart were studied in overfed rats with an increased body fat content. The goal of the study was to investigate whether the above treatment constitutes a therapy for obesity in that T3 causes weight and fat loss and the beta-blockers prevent the unwanted T3-effects on the heart (tachycardia and increased heart weight). T3 did not increase energy intake above the level seen in overfed animals. It caused loss of body weight due to loss of fat but not protein, an increase in interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT) weight and fat, tachycardia and an increase in heart weight. Atenolol and propranolol blocked T3-induced tachycardia. With the exception of the highest propranolol dose which abolished the T3-induced increase in IBAT fat content, the beta-blockers did not modify the other T3 effects. Thus, in spite of the weight and fat loss and the lack of significant protein loss and tachycardia observed under T3/high dose beta-blockers treatment, the T3-induced increase in heart weight makes this treatment unsuitable as a therapy for obesity.", 
    "43": "1. In circular muscle strips of the fundus and corpus of guinea-pig stomach, mechanical responses to catecholamines were studied mainly in the presence of a prostaglandin biosynthesis inhibitor, meclofenamate. 2. Normal preparations developed considerable muscle tone, and adrenaline (10-100 microM) in the presence of 3-5 microM propranolol produced a multiphasic response, generally consisting of transient relaxation and contraction, followed by slow relaxation and then contraction. Responses to phenylephrine were similar to those of adrenaline. 3. Meclofenamate (0.3 microM) nearly abolished the muscle tone and under this condition, both adrenaline and phenylephrine produced a simple contraction. This response was strongly inhibited by prazosin, but only weakly by yohimbine. 4. When muscle tone was maintained by prostaglandin E2 (10 nM) in the presence of meclofenamate, phenylephrine (30 microM) produced transient relaxation followed by slow contraction in most preparations. These were strongly inhibited by prazosin. Adrenaline produced a similar response, but the relaxation was only partially reduced by prazosin. The remaining relaxation was more dominant in the middle fundic region and this was considered to be mediated through beta-adrenoceptors. 5. It is concluded that in the circular muscle of the fundic region of guinea-pig stomach, endogenous prostaglandins are involved in maintaining muscle tone and in modifying the response to catecholamines and that both contraction and relaxation are mediated by alpha 1-adrenoceptors.", 
    "44": "Little is known about an interrelationship between thyroid dysfunction and parasympathetic nervous system. R-R interval variations on electrocardiogram (ECG) have been considered to be reliable indicator reflecting abnormalities of parasympathetic nervous system. We have attempted to apply this technique in patients with hyperthyroidism. Studies were conducted in 60 healthy subjects and 57 patients with Graves' disease. R-R interval variations were expressed as coefficient of variation on 100 heart rates at the time of resting (CVq) and deep respiration (CVd). A negative correlation between R-R interval variations (CVq, CVd) and ages was observed in healthy subjects. CVq was significantly lower in untreated Graves' disease than in antithyroid drug-treated Graves' disease and control subjects. A similar result also was obtained in CVd. Decreased CVq in untreated patients with Graves' disease was restored by administration of beta blockades, propranolol and metoprolol, but not by administration of alpha blockade, bunazosine. The present investigation suggests that there are hypofunctions in parasympathetic nervous system associated with beta (especially beta one) effects in patients with hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease.", 
    "45": "The beta-adrenoceptor antagonist dilevalol in a total dose of 430 micrograms/kg i.v., potently suppressed isoprenaline-induced increases in heart rate and max LVdP/dt (dose ratios of 42 +/- 6 and 38 +/- 5, respectively, in anesthetized pigs), but a dose of 1430 micrograms/kg did not appreciably modify phenylephrine-induced increases in arterial blood pressure (dose ratio less than 4) in both anesthetized and conscious pigs. The actions of dilevalol on ischemic myocardium of anesthetized pigs were investigated following a reduction of left anterior descending artery flow by 85-90%. Dilevalol (300 micrograms/kg), administered after 15 minutes of ischemia, did not affect the ischemia-induced changes in systemic hemodynamics (such as heart rate, max LVdP/dt and cardiac output), myocardial perfusion, and wall-thickening of the ischemic segment during the following 15 minutes of ischemia and 2 hours of reperfusion. The reasons for the lack of antiischemic actions are most likely the absence of negative chronotropy and an absence of afterload reduction by dilevalol.",

    "48": "After years of effort, the treatment of an episode of bleeding from a ruptured varix remains unsatisfactory, as does prophylaxis of rebleeding. As a consequence it was logical to try to prevent bleeding before the first hemorrhage has occurred (primary prophylaxis). Shunt surgery proved to be useful in terms of bleeding rate, but side effects and operative risk made this method inapplicable for prophylaxis. Endoscopic sclerotherapy was efficient in terms of bleeding rate, but doubts about its efficacy in improving survival, together with difficulties in performing repeated endoscopies over the long term, have limited its use in primary prophylaxis. Beta-blockers have proved useful for preventing bleeding and, in some studies, for improving survival. Further studies are still necessary to accurately identify the suitable target population, the method of follow-up and the duration of treatment. Although some groups have started using beta-blockers for prophylaxis before bleeding on a routine basis, others consider this treatment only for prospective randomized trials.",

    "50": "The beta-blocking agent carazolol is used for the prevention of stress syndromes in pigs. Little is known of the pharmacokinetics of this drug, and therefore of its residue status in meat. In this study carazolol pharmacokinetics were investigated in a randomized three-way cross-over design in five pigs. A dose of 0.025 mg/kg was given intravenously, intramuscularly and intra-adiposely (in the subcutaneous fat layer). Carazolol was rapidly distributed and had a short half-life of 1.2-4.2 h. The distribution volume was calculated to be 0.22-0.65 l/kg. After intramuscular or intra-adipose administration the absorption pattern was biphasic. A rapid initial phase was followed by a slow second phase. Absorption was found to be incomplete at 24 h after intramuscular and intra-adipose administration ranging from 24 to 59% and 25 to 66%, respectively. The biphasic behaviour could be explained by retention of the drug in the tissues after absorption of the solvent was complete. A few hours after intravenous administration only negligible amounts of the drug were circulating in the body; however, considerable amounts of drug might have remained at the intramuscular or intra-adipose injection site.", 
    "51": "Although parturition commonly is induced in swine with prostaglandin F2 alpha or one of its analogs, variation in response to the treatment is large. The purpose of this investigation was to more precisely terminate parturition. Two experiments were conducted. Sows all received prostaglandin analog followed, 20 h later, by different doses of the beta-adrenergic blocking agent carazolol and(or) oxytocin. Treatment with 3 mg of carazolol alone caused parturition to commence within 2.6 +/- .23 (SEM) h after injection. Parturition was complete in 2.0 +/- .13 h and proceeded smoothly without the necessity of manual assistance. Adding 2.5 I.U. of oxytocin to the 3 mg of carazolol speeded the onset of labor (1.7 +/- .17 h). However, in some cases parturition was interrupted and the time passing between the birth of the first and the last piglet was prolonged to 2.5 +/- .28 h. We conclude that by applying carazolol 20 h after a prostaglandin analog, parturition in swine may be terminated very effectively.", 
    "52": "An interrelationship between atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and the renin-angiotensin system has been established. Both of these hormonal systems are modulated by sodium balance. The role of the beta-adrenoceptor in the regulation of release of ANP is not clear. We therefore undertook a study to examine changes in atrial-specific granule number and plasma ANP level following beta-adrenoceptor blockade in rats on low and high sodium intakes. A low-sodium diet, as compared with a high-sodium diet, elevated right and left atrial-specific granule number (right atria 54.6 +/- 8.7 vs. 42.3 +/- 5.7; left atria 47.7 +/- 7.7 vs. 30.6 +/- 3.4 granules/unit area) and plasma renin activity (28 +/- 3.7 vs. 5.4 +/- 0.8 ng AI/ml/hr). Plasma ANP levels were lower in the low-sodium animals (98 +/- 34 vs. 345 +/- 38 pg/ml). When treated with the nonspecific beta-adrenoceptor blocker propranolol, the elevated plasma renin activity and atrial-specific granule number in rats on a low sodium intake were significantly less. Neither of these parameters changed in rats on a high sodium intake. Conversely, propranolol treatment resulted in lower plasma ANP levels in rats with high sodium intake. The already-suppressed plasma ANP level in rats on a low-sodium diet was unaltered with beta-adrenoceptor blockade. The results suggest that dietary sodium intake is an important determinant of the response of atrial-specific granule number and plasma ANP levels following beta-adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol.", 
    "53": "There is only a limited number of studies available comparing the effectiveness of various combinations of anti-ischemic and antianginal substances in the same patients with coronary artery disease and stable angina pectoris and even these are restricted to either only a few drugs or a single point in time for testing. Accordingly, this study was undertaken to determine to what extent the combination of two or three drugs with different anti-ischemic mechanisms of action such as the long-acting form of the beta-blocker metoprolol and isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) in sustained-release form as well as the calcium channel blockers nisoldipine and diltiazem in sustained-release form, which previously have not been tested in combination, are capable of enhancing effectiveness and prolonging duration of action. In a double-blind, randomized, crossover study in eleven patients with documented coronary artery disease and stable angina pectoris the effects of monotherapy with 200 mg metoprolol in long-acting form were compared with those of combined treatment with 120 mg ISDN sustained-release or 10 mg nisoldipine or 120 mg diltiazem sustained-release as well as ISDN and nisoldipine and finally, ISDN and diltiazem by means of an intraindividual analysis. For assessment of anti-ischemic and antianginal effects, symptom-limited exercise testing was carried out before as well as three, eight, twelve and 24 hours after medication. The parameters analyzed were ST-segment depression at the highest comparable workload, ischemia-free and symptom-free exercise capacity (one minute prior to ST-segment depression of 1 mm or onset of angina pectoris) as well as the systolic blood pressure--heart rate product at the highest comparable workload and at the highest ischemia-free workload, that is one minute prior to an ischemic reaction of 1 mm. Based on the ST-segment depression, all combinations of two drugs (metoprolol and ISDN at three hours; metoprolol and diltiazem at eight hours) led to a significant or at least relative increase of effectiveness. On comparison of the various double combinations, those with nisoldipine showed an early dissipation of action which, twelve hours after administration, was significantly less marked than those with diltiazem. Of the two tested triple combinations, metoprolol, ISDN and diltiazem was either significantly more effective than the various double combinations (metoprolol and ISDN or metoprolol and nisoldipine, both at eight and twelve hours; metoprolol and diltiazem, twelve hours) or relatively more effective and showed clear prolongation of the effects in excess of twelve hours.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "54": "Twenty-six patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension participated in a 6-week outpatient, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled two-way crossover study to assess the hemodynamic effects of bisoprolol (20 mg QD) at steady state. Hemodynamic assessments included sitting blood pressure, heart rate, and left-ventricular ejection fraction by radionuclide ventriculography after 7 days of bisoprolol or placebo at trough (24 h post-dose) and peak (3 h post-dose) values. The group adjusted mean ejection fraction was not significantly different in patients receiving bisoprolol compared with the placebo group at either peak or trough measurements; in fact, means in patients taking bisoprolol were slightly higher than in the placebo group. No symptomatic hypotension was documented. Blood pressure, measured 24 hours after dosing, was significantly lower in those receiving bisoprolol when compared with the placebo group, by 7.7 mm Hg and 9 mm Hg for diastolic and systolic blood pressure, respectively. Similarly, mean values of heart rate were 10 beats/min lower in the bisoprolol patients than in the placebo group. Only headache and insomnia occurred as adverse events. Bisoprolol (20 mg QD) effectively lowered blood pressure over a 24-hour period without significantly reducing ejection fraction or causing adverse clinical or biochemical events.", 
    "55": "The effects of chronic NE administration (100 micrograms/kg/hr s.c., 6 days) on the stimulus-induced overflow of neurotransmitter from the isolated perfused rat kidney were examined. This treatment increased renal NE content and increased the absolute stimulus-induced overflow of NE. The increase in absolute overflow was not simply the result of the increase in renal NE content as fractional overflow was also increased slightly (20%). Alpha adrenoceptor blockade with phentolamine eliminated the NE treatment-induced difference in fractional overflow. However, the dose-response curves to phentolamine and the alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist UK 14,304 on stimulus-induced overflow from the kidney were not significantly different after NE treatment. Chronic EPI treatment (same dose) produced an 80% increase in fractional stimulus-induced overflow of neurotransmitter but the dose-response curve to UK 14,304 was shifted only slight to the right (3-fold) of the control curve. No influence of prejunctional beta adrenoceptors on stimulus-induced overflow was observed in either the control of the NE-treated group. In conclusion, the data regarding fractional overflow and the effects of the phentolamine suggest that NE treatment produces minimal change whereas EPI treatment produces marked decreases in the influence in prejunctional alpha adrenoceptors. However, although the data with UK 14,304 after NE treatment support this conclusion, the failure of EPI treatment to alter the dose-response curve to UK 14,304 does not. The apparent contradiction of the results with the alpha adrenoceptor agonist in the EPI-treated group as well as the large differences between the effects of NE vs. EPI treatment on stimulus-induced overflow and prejunctional alpha adrenoceptor function cannot be explained at this time.",

Smoking history was related to both adiposity and body fat distribution, and was strongly related to coronary heart disease but not to diabetes. Past smokers who had smoked up to a month ago were the heaviest while present smokers who were currently smoking or had smoked within the past month were the leanest. However, although present smokers had reduced amounts of fat, this was attributable to those present smokers without heart disease. Present smokers with heart disease were not as lean and had increased amounts of intra-abdominal fat. Past smokers had the greatest amount of central fat and this was attributable to those with heart disease. By two-way (smoking history and coronary heart disease status) analysis of covariance, smoking history was significantly related only to subcutaneous fat disposition on the chest and abdomen independent of coronary heart disease, while coronary heart disease status was strongly related to plasma levels of insulin C-peptide, VLDL, HDL, HDL2, and HDL3 cholesterol, and total and VLDL triglyceride, independent of smoking history. Further analysis showed that none of the body fat variables could account for the risk of coronary heart disease associated with smoking history. Higher fasting plasma C-peptide levels in past smokers accounted statistically for part of the risk of coronary heart disease associated with cigarette smoking. However, this effect was not mediated by any of the body fat measurements.", 
    "59": "Disproportionately increased intra-abdominal fat is related to coronary heart disease but not to smoking history. Smoking history is related to coronary heart disease but not to diabetes. Weight gain is associated with smoking cessation and appears to be concentrated in the central subcutaneous regions, especially for those who have coronary heart disease. Weight gain associated with cessation of smoking appears to be unrelated to atherogenic changes in lipids, lipoproteins, or insulin. Other pathogenic processes must be considered in the association between smoking and coronary heart disease.", 
    "60": "The purpose of the present study was to characterize the effects of xamoterol in the human myocardium. In the presence of forskolin or milrinone, xamoterol increased isometric force of contraction, contraction velocity, and relaxation velocity in isolated, electrically driven preparations from human myocardium, but had no effect alone. There was no difference in the effect of xamoterol between right atrial myocardium and left ventricular myocardium from nonfailing (NF), moderately failing (NYHA II-III), and severely failing (NYHA IV) human hearts. The positive inotropic and lusitropic effects of isoprenaline were reduced depending on the severity of heart failure in left ventricular myocardium (i.e., NF greater than NYHA II-III greater than NYHA IV). In the presence of norepinephrine, xamoterol produced negative inotropic effects similar to those of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists pindolol and propranolol. Xamoterol alone had no effects on force of contraction, whereas pindolol and propranolol markedly reduced contractile force. In NYHA class IV, isoprenaline stimulated adenylate cyclase about twofold but xamoterol, like pindolol or propranolol, had no effect. Experiments with the beta 1- and beta 2-selective antagonists CGP 207.12A and ICI 118.551, respectively, showed that the positive inotropic and lusitropic effects of xamoterol were mediated by beta 1-adrenoceptors. Consistently, xamoterol had a selectivity of 13.8 at beta 1-adrenoceptors as measured in radioligand binding experiments. It is concluded that xamoterol acts as a beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist with a selectivity of 13.8 in human ventricular myocardium. The compound has an intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, as it produces beta 1-adrenoceptor-mediated positive inotropic and lusitropic effects in the presence of forskolin. The beneficial effects of xamoterol in patients with heart failure could be due to prevention of the detrimental effects of norepinephrine such as beta 1-adrenoceptor downregulation of an increase of Gi (inhibitory guanine-nucleotide binding protein).", 
    "61": "We studied 251 patients less than or equal to 65 years of age admitted for treatment of symptomatic supraventricular tachyarrhythmia to assess whether these arrhythmias begin evenly throughout the day or manifest circadian variation in occurrence. The arrhythmias included 152 episodes of atrial fibrillation, 50 episodes of supraventricular reentry tachycardia, 30 episodes of atrial flutter, and 19 cases of ectopic atrial tachycardia. A total of 209 patients could tell the exact time their symptoms had started. In 38 of them (18%), the arrhythmia had begun between midnight and 6:00 AM, in 63 (30%) between 6:01 AM and noon, in 46 (22%) between noon and 6:00 PM, and in 62 (30%) between 6:01 PM and midnight. This distribution differed significantly from uniform occurrence (chi square 8.7, p less than 0.05). Fifty patients were using beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents when the arrhythmia occurred. Compared with the other 159 patients, they had no morning surge of arrhythmias (20% versus 33.3% of episodes between 6:01 AM and noon), but instead a much higher incidence at night (34% versus 13.2% of episodes between midnight and 6:00 AM) (chi square 14.4, p less than 0.005). We conclude that the frequency of onset of sustained supraventricular tachyarrhythmias varies with the time of day, showing nearly equal peaks in the morning and in the evening and a trough at night. The modifying effect of beta-adrenoceptor blockage suggests that many morning arrhythmias are of adrenergic origin while other, probably vagal arrhythmogenic mechanisms, prevail at night.", 
    "62": "Changes in heart rate and systolic blood pressure were measured during extubation and emergence from anesthesia in 40 ASA physical status I and II patients in a double-blind study to assess the effect of three doses of esmolol (1, 1.5, and 2 mg/kg) given as a bolus 2 min after reversal of neuromuscular blockade. Heart rate (P less than 0.01), systolic blood pressure (P less than 0.02), and rate-pressure product (P less than 0.01) increased significantly during extubation of the control group. All doses of esmolol attenuated the increases in heart rate, but 1 mg/kg was insufficient to control the increase in systolic blood pressure. Doses of 1.5 and 2 mg/kg controlled both systolic blood pressure and heart rate, but the larger dose produced significant decreases in systolic blood pressure.", 
    "63": "Granulosa cells were recovered from small (1-3 mm in diameter) and large (greater than 6 mm in diameter) preovulatory follicles or from follicles of early pregnant pigs (3-5 mm, Day 18). Incubation of these cells (5 x 10(5)) was carried out in a shaking water bath (40 degrees C) for 2 h with or without salbutamol (10(-5) M), isoprenaline (10(-5) M), propranolol (10(-5) M) and FSH (100 ng/ml). Isoprenaline significantly increased progesterone production (P less than 0.05) by granulosa cells of small follicles and large preovulatory follicles but not by granulosa cells of follicles from early pregnant pigs. After blocking the beta-adrenoceptor with propranolol the stimulatory effect of catecholamines was not observed. FSH alone stimulated progesterone production, particularly in granulosa cells of early pregnant pigs (P less than 0.05) but FSH plus catecholamine treatment did not have any effect on progesterone release. These results suggest that catecholamines may play a regulatory role in follicle maturation and this may differ between naturally cyclic and early pregnant animals.", 
    "64": "To determine whether beta-adrenergic receptors on circulating lymphocytes are impaired during endotoxemia and the precise role of catecholamines in this process, we allocated 16 dogs to three groups: I) control-saline vehicle (n = 5), II) endotoxin--Escherichia coli endotoxin 1.0 mg/kg iv bolus (n = 6), and III) endotoxin + propranolol--E. coli endotoxin 1.0 mg/kg after pretreatment with propranolol, 1.5 mg/kg iv bolus followed by a continuous infusion, 30 micrograms/kg per min, (n = 5). Five hours after endotoxin injection, lymphocytic beta-adrenergic receptor number and sodium fluoride (NaF)-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation were reduced by 41 +/- 6% and 25 +/- 7% of baseline values, respectively, which were significantly different from those observed in the control group (both P less than .01). Propranolol pretreatment prevented the endotoxin-induced reduction in lymphocytic beta-adrenergic receptor number (P less than .02 compared with the endotoxin group), but not the decrease in NaF-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation (P less than .01 compared with the control group). Myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor number was reduced in the endotoxin group compared with that observed in the control group (P less than .06). These changes were associated with a decreased chronotropic response to isoproterenol in the endotoxin group compared with the control group (P less than .05). We conclude that decreased lymphocytic beta-adrenergic receptor number in endotoxin shock is caused by circulating catecholamines, whereas alterations distal to the receptors may be due to other mechanisms.", 
    "65": "1. A proposed mechanism of contractile action of substance P in guinea-pig ileum longitudinal smooth muscle involving a decrease in membrane K+ permeability (PK) has been re-examined. 2. Potentiation of responses to substance P by the K+ channel blocker tetraethylammonium (TEA) was originally proposed as evidence for a mechanism of action of substance P involving a decrease in PK. Potentiation was confirmed; however this was found not to be specific to substance P since a similar potentiation of responses was seen with agonists not thought to act via a decrease in PK. 3. Antagonism of contractile responses to substance P by noradrenaline was similarly confirmed. However, this antagonism was found to represent a non-specific functional interaction through the inhibitory actions of beta-adrenoceptors rather than the proposed specific interaction with an increase in PK by noradrenaline which is normally alpha 1-adrenoceptor mediated. 4. Experiments were made measuring 86Rb efflux, in depolarized guinea-pig ileum longitudinal smooth muscle, to estimate PK. These studies confirmed a reported decrease in PK with TEA, but failed to detect the previously reported decrease with substance P. 5. These results, although not disproving a suggested mechanism of direct contractile action of substance P in guinea-pig ileum longitudinal smooth muscle involving a decrease in PK, do throw doubt on either the evidence, or its interpretation, as proposed by the original authors in support of such a mechanism.", 
    "66": "1. Modulation of the hyperpolarization-activated cation current, Ih, by noradrenaline (NA) and serotonin (5-HT) was examined in guinea-pig and cat medial and lateral geniculate relay neurones using the in vitro slice technique. 2. In the absence of pharmacological antagonists, local application of NA resulted in a slow depolarization and decrease in apparent input conductance, a response which was blocked by local or bath application of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin. Application of NA after pharmacological block of alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors, or application of 5-HT in all conditions, induced a 1-3 mV slow depolarization which was associated with a pronounced increase in apparent input conductance. This response to NA and 5-HT persisted during blocked synaptic transmission and was present in both the guinea-pig and cat medial and lateral geniculate nuclei. 3. The increase in membrane conductance elicited by NA was mimicked by the beta-specific agonist isoprenaline and blocked by the beta-antagonists propranolol and atenolol, indicating that it is mediated by beta-adrenoceptors. The response to 5-HT was blocked by the 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 antagonist methysergide, but not by the 5-HT2 antagonist ritanserin. Applications of either the 5-HT1A agonist ipsapirone or the partial agonist 8-hydroxy-dipropylaminotetralin (8-OHDPAT) were without effect. 4. Current versus voltage relationships obtained under voltage clamp revealed NA and 5-HT to cause a voltage-dependent inward shift at membrane potentials negative to approximately -60 mV. This response appeared to be shared by NA and 5-HT since maximal application of 5-HT greatly reduced or abolished the response to NA. 5. Application of NA and/or 5-HT during hyperpolarizing voltage steps in voltage clamp resulted in a marked increase in amplitude of the hyperpolarization-activated cation current, Ih. In addition, the rate of activation of Ih was strongly increased during activation of beta-adrenoceptors. 6. The activation curve of the conductance underlying Ih (Gh) was shifted by 4-6 mV on the voltage axis with NA and/or 5-HT. The positive shift of Gh activation in the voltage domain resulted in an increase in the amplitude of Gh which is active at resting, and more hyperpolarized, membrane potentials. The subsequent increase in resting membrane conductance decreased the responsiveness of thalamic neurones to hyperpolarizations of all durations. 7. Local or bath application of caesium blocked both Ih and the increase in membrane conductance in response to NA and 5-HT. By contrast, barium blocked neither Ih nor the responses to NA and 5-HT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "67": "It was stated experimentally in dogs that the elevation of the lymph toxicity was more expressed than that of the blood in acute myocardial infarction. The shortening of the half-life period of paramecia evidenced the above mentioned fact. The injection of the lymphogogue preparations (obsidan, heparin, rheogluman) after coronary artery occlusion resulted in distinct rise of blood and lymph toxicity in early periods because of the \"washing out\" of toxic products from the ischemic myocardium, followed by normalization that had been more quicker than in controls.", 
    "68": "Up to 50% of hypertensive men are subject to sleep apnea (SA). With a prevalence in men of up to 10%, SA is a common illness and hypertension (HT) one of its early symptoms. It is important to have available a drug treatment that will effectively control blood pressure (BP) without exacerbating symptoms of SA. Twelve patients with SA and HT were investigated in a double-blind, comparative trial. Patients were randomly allocated to either metoprolol (M) 100 mg daily or cilazapril (C) 2.5 mg daily. Polysomnographic measurements under standardized conditions including intraarterial BP monitoring were taken on two consecutive nights each before and after the 1-week treatment. Values in the M group were (mean +/- 95% CI) systolic BP 161 +/- 2.1 vs. 148 +/- 2.2 mm Hg (p less than 0.01); diastolic BP 98 +/- 1.8 vs. 93 +/- 1.8 mm Hg (p less than 0.01); and HR 73 +/- 1.2 vs 65 +/- 1.1 beats/min (p less than 0.01). Corresponding figures for the C group were systolic BP 140 +/- 2.1 vs. 127 +/- 2.1 mm Hg (p less than 0.01); diastolic BP 95 +/- 1.7 vs. 78 +/- 1.7 mm Hg (p less than 0.01); and HR 82 +/- 1.1 vs. 79 +/- 1.2 beats/min (p less than 0.01). Whereas C reduced both BP and HR in all sleep phases, M produced no changes during REM sleep. SA activity was 45 (range 15-91) vs. 34 (range 2-57) apneas per hour of sleep in the M group and 54 (range 21-84) vs. 40 (range 8-72) apneas per hour in the C group (p less than 0.01). There were no changes in total sleep time or in the proportions of non-REM to REM sleep. Both M and C reduce nocturnal BP in SA patients, but the effect of C is seen in all sleep phases. C has a more favorable effect on the disturbed nocturnal blood pressure of SA patients.", 
    "69": "We have examined the effects of xamoterol, a partial beta 1-adrenoceptor agonist, on cardiac beta-adrenoceptors using isolated myocytes and cell-free preparations. Xamoterol was considerably less effective than isoproterenol in stimulating adenylate cyclase activity but the difference was narrowed by 1 microM forskolin, presumably by inducing more efficient coupling to the catalytic subunit of the enzyme. Xamoterol mediated a time- and concentration-dependent loss of beta-adrenoceptors from the cell surface of cardiac myocytes through a process of internalization sensitive to the cytoskeleton inhibitors, colchicine and cytochalasine. In cell-free preparations, loss of membrane-bound beta-adrenoceptors induced by xamoterol, but not that induced by 1 microM isoproterenol, was prevented by the inhibitor of protein kinase A. In contrast, 100 nM heparin (an inhibitor of beta-receptor kinase) prevented the isoproterenol-but not the xamoterol-mediated decline of beta-receptors. In addition, 1 microM xamoterol attenuated the isoproterenol-mediated internalization of beta-adrenoceptors in cardiac myocytes over a wide range of isoproterenol concentrations. This attenuation required activation of protein kinase A. These results suggest that the influence of xamoterol on the cycling of cardiac beta-adrenoceptors involves different pathways than those utilized by isoproterenol.", 
    "70": "The effect of MDL 11,939 hydrochloride [alpha-phenyl-1-(2-phenylethyl)-4-piperidinemethanol HCl], a novel antiarrhythmic agent, was studied using microelectrode recording techniques. MDL 11,939 (10(-7) - 10(-6) M increased the action potential (AP) duration in both guinea pig papillary muscle and dog Purkinje fiber with a maximum effective concentration of 10(-6) to 3 x 10(-6) M. MDL 11,939 up to and including 10(-6) M did not alter upstroke velocity (Vmax) of the AP in either tissue but 10(-5) M decreased the Vmax in Purkinje fibers. Compared to the other class III antiarrhythmic agents (bretylium, clofilium, and d-sotalol), MDL 11,939 was among the most potent in increasing AP duration in the papillary muscle, while being relatively less effective in increasing AP duration in Purkinje fiber. Bretylium did not increase the AP duration in papillary muscle unless it was reserpinized. MDL 11,939, clofilium, and d-sotalol all produced negative inotropic effects in papillary muscle, whereas bretylium produced a positive inotropic effect. The positive inotropic effect of bretylium was abolished by reserpinization. In papillary muscle preparations depolarized with 22 mM K+, MDL 11,939 at concentrations greater than or equal to 10(-5) M depressed Vmax of the slow AP, suggesting that it inhibited the inward Ca2+ current, and such an effect may contribute to the negative inotropic effect of this agent. In the depolarized preparations, the slow AP duration was still increased by concentrations of MDL 11,939 greater than or equal to 10(-6) M. In conclusion, MDL 11,939 has cellular electrophysiological properties that suggest a class III antiarrhythmic activity.", 
    "71": "In this double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study, the aim was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of a new fixed combination of felodipine and metoprolol with the individual components in monotherapy. After a placebo period of 4 weeks, 159 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension were randomized to extended-release formulations of either felodipine plus metoprolol 10 + 100 mg (FM), felodipine 10 mg (F), or metoprolol 100 mg (M) once daily if supine diastolic blood pressure greater than 95 mm Hg. After 12 weeks of active treatment, the reductions in supine blood pressure (24 h after dosing) were 20/14, 13/10, and 11/8 mm Hg for FM, F, and M, respectively. The difference in change was 7/4 mm Hg (p = 0.004/p = 0.006) and 8/5 mm Hg (p = 0.0002/p less than 0.0001) for the fixed combination and F or M, respectively. Blood pressure control (diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg after 12 weeks) was significantly better for the combination than for F and M, i.e., 71%, 49% (p = 0.008), and 34% (p = 0.004), respectively. Adverse experiences were those to be expected from previous studies with felodipine and metoprolol and did not differ in frequency between groups. It can be concluded that a fixed combination of metoprolol and felodipine has a clinically relevant and significantly better blood pressure reduction 24 h postdose than the individual substances in monotherapy, without decreased tolerability.", 
    "72": "Ventricular tachycardia (VT) was induced by premature stimulation or fast pacing in 14 Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts whose left ventricular endocardial and intramural cells had been selectively killed by freezing. VTs were caused by apparent reentrant excitation in the surviving thin (1 mm thick) subepicardial layer of anisotropically oriented cells having ostensibly normal membrane characteristics. During VT, 100 microM d-sotalol (seven hearts) or 30 microM lidocaine (seven hearts) was added to the perfusate. Electrophysiological variables were measured before and during drug exposure at both slow (S1 = 300 ms) and fast (S1 = 150-180 ms) pacing rates. Sotalol prevented VT reinduction in six of seven preparations, compared to only two of seven with lidocaine. Lidocaine prolonged the functional refractory period (FRP) and slowed conduction velocity (CV). Lidocaine prolonged the wavelength of the cardiac impulse (= FRP x CV) by 18% at slow rates but reduced it by 21% at fast rates. Sotalol, however, since it increased the FRP without reducing CV, caused wavelength prolongation at both rates (43% at slow rates, 26% at fast rates). Thus, this VT model may provide an important contrast of class I and class III drug action, with the drug effects on wavelength predicting susceptibility to VT induction.", 
    "73": "During a 3-year period, 22 patients with recurrent supraventricular tachycardia have been treated with antitachycardia pacemakers (Intermedics Intertach, 262-12, n = 17, and Intertach II, 262-16, n = 5). Eighty-two percent were female, the mean age was 44 +/- 14 years; 86% had atrioventricular node reentrant tachycardia. Symptoms had occurred over 11.8 +/- 7.1 years, with 3.6 hospital admissions per patient, despite 4.7 +/- 2.1 antiarrhythmic drugs. Following pacemaker implantation, during a follow-up of 14.8 +/- 11.5 months, only two patients have been readmitted to a hospital because of supraventricular tachycardia (mean 0.1 per patient). One patient is taking an antiarrhythmic agent, and four are taking beta adrenergic blocking agents. Thus, 23% are taking cardioactive drugs (it was anticipated that two patients would continue on drugs after pacemaker implantation). There have been no serious complications. Atrial antitachycardia is thus an effective therapy in carefully selected patients with recurrent supraventricular tachycardia, reducing hospital admissions for supraventricular tachycardia and reducing the need for antiarrhythmic drugs.", 
    "74": "The relationship between heart rate response and the dynamic changes in the PR interval was assessed in 631 patients undergoing routine cardiac exercise tests for a variety of clinical indications. Patients were stratified into four subsets: nonmedicated normals (n = 437), patients on beta-antagonist agents (n = 118), those on antiarrhythmic agents alone (n = 61) and those with a clinical diagnosis of advanced (New York Heart Association [NYHA] Class III or IV) congestive heart failure. All patients were in stable sinus rhythm throughout the test. PR intervals were measured at rest, at mid-exercise and at peak exercise. Mean PR intervals shortened to a statistically significant degree in most subgroups. This effect was predominantly observed in the earlier stages of exercise. In patients with advanced heart failure, there was no statistically significant shortening of exercise PR intervals later in exercise, demonstrating a parallel with their relatively blunted heart rate response. These changes in exercise PR intervals suggest that implanted pacemaker algorithms may be constructed to maximize hemodynamic benefit in patients requiring physiological pacemakers.", 
    "75": "The non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol, has a protective effect on ethanol-induced gastric haemorrhagic lesions in mice when given in doses of 2.5, 5.0 and 10 mg/kg either parenterally (i.p.) or orally. The effect was more marked after oral administration. Another non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, timolol, failed to protect against ethanol-induced gastric lesions. Thus, beta-adrenoceptor blockade does not seem to play a role in the gastroprotective effect of propranolol. Pretreatment with the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, abolished the protective effect of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg i.p. propranolol but only attenuated the effect of the higher i.p. dose (10 mg/kg) and the three oral doses. These results indicate that the gastroprotective effect of propranolol is mediated partly by the prostaglandin pathway and partly by another mechanism which, we suggest, may involve its membrane-stabilising action.", 
    "76": "The ovaries of many species contain catecholamines and beta-adrenergic receptors. The present studies were done to determine if catecholamines play a role in the regulation of androgen production by porcine theca cells. Basal and luteinizing hormone (LH)-stimulated androstenedione production was significantly inhibited by noradrenaline and isoproterenol. The inhibitory effects were dose-dependent and were enhanced when the cultures contained the carboxy-O-methyl transferase inhibitor, U-0521. The inhibitory effect of isoproterenol was reversed by the beta-adrenergic antagonist, metoprolol. Isoproterenol caused a generalized inhibition of LH-stimulated steroidogenesis, decreasing the accumulation of pregnenolone, progesterone, androstenedione and estradiol in the culture medium. These studies suggest that catecholamines may be important regulators of thecal androgen production.", 
    "77": "The posterior hypothalamus (PH) is involved in the generation of behavioral thermoregulatory responses, but the importance of the PH in the control of autonomic thermoregulatory responses such as heat production in brown adipose tissue (BAT) is not well defined. In the present study, selective stimulation of PH neurons by local application of the excitatory amino acid glutamate (250 nl of 1 M solution, unilaterally) caused a sharp, transient increase in interscapular BAT (IBAT) and core temperature in urethane-anesthetized rats. This effect was blocked by pretreatment with the sympathetic ganglionic blocker, chlorisondamine chloride (2 mg/kg) or the beta-adrenergic receptor blocker, propranolol (2 mg/kg), implicating the involvement of the sympathetic system. The effect of intra-PH injection of glutamate on IBAT and core temperatures could be mimicked by injection of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor antagonist, bicucullin methiodide (BMI, 50 ng), into the same PH site. This effect of BMI could be blocked by co-injection of the GABA(A) receptor agonist, muscimol (25 ng). Further, BMI co-injection potentiated the effect of intra-PH injection of glutamate on IBAT and core temperatures. Conversely, muscimol co-injection prevented the stimulatory effect of intra-PH injection of glutamate. Taken together, the results indicate that direct chemical stimulation of neurons in the PH can activate an autonomic mechanism controlling heat production in BAT. Further, they suggest the neural mechanism in the PH mediating this effect is tonically inhibited by GABA, as blockade of GABAergic function in the PH produces an effect similar to that observed after direct stimulation of PH neurons with glutamate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "78": "We utilized 3H-8-hydroxy-N,N-dipropyl-2-aminotetralin (3H-DPAT) and 125I-iodocyanopindolol (125I-CYP) to label serotonin (5HT) 1A and 5HT1B receptors, respectively, in sections of the rat brain after characterizing the pharmacologic specificity of these agents. We then used quantitative autoradiography to measure the concentrations of 5HT1A and 5HT1B receptors in individual subnuclei of the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and adjacent structures of the dorsal vagal complex. The highest 5HT1A receptor concentrations were observed within the central and intermediate subnuclei of the NTS, with low quantities of 3H-DPAT binding sites observed in the hypoglossal nucleus and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus. In contrast, the density of 5HT1B receptors was relatively homogeneous through all NTS subnuclei, with the highest concentrations localized within the ventrolateral subnucleus. The hypoglossal and dorsal motor nuclei had slightly higher 5HT1B receptor densities than the NTS subnuclei, whereas the area postrema had a very low density. These data suggest that 5HT1A receptors are organized in a manner consistent with the cytoarchitectural and hodological parcellation of the NTS into individual subnuclei. The high concentrations of 5HT1A receptors in the central and intermediate subnuclei suggest a role for these receptors in medullary reflex pathways subserving deglutition. The relatively high density of 5HT1B receptors in the ventrolateral subnucleus suggests that these receptors modulate respiratory neurons, whereas the diffuse organization of 5HT1B receptors in the remaining subnuclei suggests that they are associated with central 5HT afferent pathways to the NTS. Further studies will be required to understand the physiologic role of 5HT1 receptors within the NTS.", 
    "79": "The ability of insulin to promote the phosphorylation of some proteins and the dephosphorylation of others is paradoxical. An insulin-stimulated protein kinase is shown to activate the type-1 protein phosphatase that controls glycogen metabolism, by phosphorylating its regulatory subunit at a specific serine. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of this residue is stimulated by insulin in vivo. Increased and decreased phosphorylation of proteins by insulin can therefore be explained through the same basic underlying mechanism.", 
    "80": "A single administration of the sex-dependent hepatocarcinogenic beta-blocker DL-1-(2-nitro-3-methyl-phenoxy)-3-tert-butylamino-propan-2-ol (DL-ZAMI 1305) induces dose-dependent liver DNA damage, as evaluated by alkaline sucrose gradient analysis, in female but not in male Fisher 344 rats. A single administration of the direct mutagenic epoxide-derivative of DL-ZAMI 1305 3-methyl-2-nitro-1-(2,3-epoxypropoxy)-benzene induces dose-dependent DNA damage in the liver of animals of both sexes. However, also in this case, the genotoxic activity of the compound appears to be significantly higher in female than in male rats. A DNA-damaging capacity similar in the two sexes is instead exerted by DL-ZAMI 1305-unrelated direct mutagens, like N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) and methyl-methanesulfonate (MMS). The data confirm the sex-dependent susceptibility of rat liver to the genotoxic activity of DL-ZAMI 1305-related molecules, also in the absence of an absolute requirement for a metabolic activation of the compound.", 
    "81": "The clinical efficacy of flunarizine and propranolol for the prevention of migraine attacks was assessed in 33 children in a double blind study. After a run-in phase of one month, 32 patients started the active medication. A reduction in the number of migraine attacks was observed in 75% of the flunarizine group and in 73.8% of the propranolol group. Propranolol also reduced the severity of attacks. Transient side effects were observed in 3 of 17 of the flunarizine group and in 5 of 15 of the propranolol group. The most frequent side effect was increased fatigue, which required interruption of therapy in 2 patients of the propranolol group.", 
    "82": "Circadian variation of onset of acute myocardial infarction has been noted in many studies and may carry important implications. However, only a few previous studies have attempted subgroup analysis. In 4,796 patients with documented acute myocardial infarction, the time of symptom onset was recorded. As in other studies, a peak occurred in the morning hours from 6 A.M. to noon with 28% of the population (1.16 times the average percent for the other time periods) experiencing symptom onset in that period (p less than 0.001). There was a second lower peak (25%) in the evening hours between 6:01 P.M. and midnight, also observed in some previous studies. Whether the presence of subgroups with specific clinical characteristics would exhibit different patterns and thereby contribute to these peaks in the overall population was then determined. In patients with a history of congestive heart failure (n = 606) or with non-Q-wave infarction (n = 832), a pronounced peak (29%) occurred only in the evening hours. In patients greater than 70 years of age (n = 1,422), smokers (n = 2,057), diabetics (n = 767), women (n = 1,213) and patients taking beta blocking drugs (n = 847), 2 nearly equal peaks were observed. Finally, in patients with previous myocardial infarction (n = 1,104), no peaks were observed. In a subgroup of patients (n = 1,084) free from the most important modifying factors, there was a single very pronounced late morning peak (32%), 1.39 times the average percent for the other time periods (p less than 0.001), without evidence of a second evening peak.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "83": "Intoxication with metaproterenol, a mainly beta-2 selective agonist, was diagnosed in a dog with tachycardia, tachypnea, weakness, vomiting, and a history of exposure to the drug. Electrocardiography and echocardiography disclosed sinus tachycardia with episodes of ventricular tachycardia and exuberant systolic ventricular function, respectively. Administration of the beta blocking drugs propranolol and atenolol led to resolution of the clinical signs. Excessive sympathetic stimulation caused by metaproterenol is an unusual intoxication in dogs.", 
    "84": "After successful repair of coarctation of the aorta in childhood, exercise-induced upper body systolic hypertension is well documented. Beta blockade has been shown to reduce the arm/leg gradient in untreated coarctation of the aorta; treatment before coarctation repair has decreased paradoxical hypertension after repair. Ten patients with successful surgical repair of coarctation, defined as a resting arm/leg gradient of less than or equal to 18 mm Hg, were evaluated by treadmill exercise before and after beta blockade with atenolol. Mean age was 5.5 years at repair and 18 at study. At baseline evaluation, systolic blood pressures at termination of exercise ranged from 201 to 270 mm Hg (mean 229 mm Hg). Arm/leg gradients at exercise termination ranged from 30 to 143 mm Hg (mean 84). Follow-up treadmill exercise studies were performed after beta blockade. Upper extremity systolic pressures at exercise termination were normalized in 9 of 10 patients. Maximal systolic blood pressure recorded at exercise termination ranged from 163 to 223 mm Hg (mean 196 mm Hg, p less than or equal to 0.005). Arm/leg gradient at termination of exercise also decreased significantly to a mean of 51 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). No patient had symptoms on atenolol and exercise endurance times were unchanged. The study results in this small series suggest that cardioselective beta blockade can be used to treat exercise-induced upper body hypertension effectively after surgical repair of coarctation. Because a high incidence of premature cardiovascular disease has been well documented after satisfactory surgical repair, the findings are of importance for this group of postoperative patients.", 
    "85": "Successful surgical ablation of atrioventricular (AV) accessory connections may be confirmed during postoperative electrophysiologic testing by the absence of accessory connection conduction in both the anterograde and retrograde directions. Whereas the former may be readily apparent by examination of the surface electrocardiogram during sinus rhythm or atrial pacing, assessment of the latter may be complicated by the frequent presence of enhanced retrograde AV nodal conduction in the postoperative period. Consequently, availability of interventions that selectively affect AV nodal conduction and refractoriness without concomitant effects on accessory connections may be helpful for assessing the success of the surgical procedure. In this study the effects of combined propranolol and verapamil administration on electrophysiologic properties of the AV node and the accessory AV connection were assessed both pre- and postoperatively in 17 patients (12 men and 5 women, mean age 33 years) undergoing surgical ablation of accessory connections. Preoperatively, electrophysiologic characteristics of all but 1 of the accessory AV connections were unaffected by propranolol and verapamil administration. Postoperatively, on the other hand, propranolol and verapamil significantly prolonged both the retrograde AV node effective refractory period (baseline: 272 +/- 34 ms vs after drugs: 384 +/- 70 ms [p less than 0.0001]) and the shortest cycle length maintaining 1:1 ventriculoatrial conduction (baseline: 357 +/- 99 ms vs after drugs: 485 +/- 64 ms [p less than 0.0001]). Late postoperative electrophysiologic evaluation (7 +/- 3 weeks) revealed no evidence of residual accessory AV connection conduction, and all patients remain asymptomatic at 21 +/- 10 months follow-up.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "86": "Beta-adrenergic blocking agents are useful in controlling excessive ventricular rate in chronic atrial fibrillation (AF) but often reduce exercise capacity. To investigate the advantage of labetalol--a unique beta blocker with alpha-blocking property--in chronic AF, 10 patients without underlying structural heart disease were studied with treadmill test, 12-minute walk and 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. Patients were randomized and crossed over to receive 4 phases of treatment (placebo, digoxin, digoxin with half-dose labetalol, and full-dose labetalol). Exercise durations were 14.1 +/- 1.5, 14.2 +/- 1.5, 16.1 +/- 1.1 and 15.6 +/- 1.1 minutes, respectively, indicating that labetalol did not reduce exercise tolerance. Although digoxin had no advantage over placebo in controlling maximal heart rate (177 +/- 2 vs 175 +/- 3 beats/min), labetalol, both as monotherapy or as an adjunct to digoxin, was advantageous (156 +/- 4 vs 177 +/- 2 beats/min, p less than 0.01, and 154 +/- 4 vs 177 +/- 2 beats/min, p less than 0.01, respectively). The rate-pressure product was consistently lowered by labetalol at rest and during exercise. At peak exercise, the addition of labetalol to digoxin reduced the maximal rate-pressure product achieved from 30,900 +/- 1300 to 24,100 +/- 2,000 mm Hg/min (p less than 0.01) and the maximal rate-pressure product was lowest with full-dose labetalol (22,300 +/- 1,600 mm Hg/min). During submaximal exercise on treadmill or during the 12-minute walk, the combination of labetalol and digoxin produced the best heart rate control, whereas labetalol monotherapy was comparable to digoxin therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "87": "The effects of theophylline (400 mg twice a day), atenolol (50 mg twice a day) and their combination on myocardial ischemia were studied in 9 patients with stable angina pectoris in a randomized, single-blind, triple crossover trial. Placebo was administered to the patients during the run-in and the run-off periods. A treadmill exercise test and 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring were obtained at the end of each treatment period. Compared with placebo, theophylline significantly improved the time to onset of myocardial ischemia (1 mm of ST-segment depression) from 7.8 +/- 3.7 to 9.5 +/- 3.7 minutes (p less than 0.03) and the exercise duration from 9 +/- 3.4 to 10.1 +/- 3.5 minutes (p less than 0.04). During atenolol and during combination treatment, the time to the onset of ischemia and the exercise duration were similar (10.8 +/- 4.2 and 11.2 +/- 3.2 minutes, 11.2 +/- 3.6 and 11.5 +/- 3.2 minutes, respectively) and longer than during theophylline administration (p less than 0.05). Ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring showed that, during theophylline administration, the heart rate was higher than during placebo throughout the 24 hours (p less than 0.05). During atenolol and during combination treatment the heart rate was similar and in both cases lower than during placebo (p less than 0.05). Compared with placebo, theophylline decreased the total ischemic time from 97 +/- 110 to 70 +/- 103 minutes (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "88": "To pursue our studies of the effects of adrenalectomy on the adrenergic regulation of phosphorylase a, cAMP, cell calcium, and Ca2+ signaling in rat hepatocytes (Studer, R.K., and Borle, A.B. (1984) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 804, 377-385; Freudenrich, C.C., and Borle, A.B. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 8604-8610), we have further examined the alpha 1-adrenergic pathway in adrenalectomized and sham-operated male rats. We measured the number and affinity of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration [(Ca2+]i) of hepatocytes with aequorin, inositol triphosphate (IP3) accumulation, and Ca2+ influx and efflux across the plasma membrane. We also compared the effects of vasopressin with those obtained with epinephrine. We found that the number of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors was slightly depressed (-23%), but that their affinity was unchanged. However, IP3 accumulation evoked by epinephrine was decreased 50%. This is probably the main cause for the depressed peak rise in [Ca2+]i we previously observed and reported. We also found that the basal resting Ca2+ influx was increased after adrenalectomy. Experiments with the beta-blocker propranolol, which abolished the epinephrine-evoked increase in Ca2+ influx, suggest that this effect may be mediated by cAMP, at least in adrenalectomized animals. The effects of vasopressin on IP3 [Ca2+]i and Ca2+ influx and efflux were also significantly decreased after adrenalectomy, indicating that alpha 1-adrenergic-mediated and other IP3-dependent Ca2+ signaling pathways are depressed after adrenalectomy.", 
    "89": "The beta-adrenergic receptors of differentiated ovine muscle cultures derived from either fetal or pre-pubertal lambs were characterized by binding of (+/-)-[3H]CGP-12177, directly to intact cells in monolayer. Fetal muscle cells contained a single class of specific and saturable binding sites which had a dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.38 x 10(-9) M and a binding capacity of 55.2 fmol/micrograms protein. beta-Adrenergic agonists competed for the specific binding sites with a typical beta 2-adrenergic specificity. Satellite muscle cells derived from pre-pubertal lambs contained two classes of binding site. The high affinity site had a Kd of 1.02 x 10(-9) M and a binding capacity of 28.4 fmol/micrograms protein and the low affinity site a Kd of 12.1 x 10(-9) M and a binding capacity of 389 fmol/micrograms protein. beta-Adrenergic agonists competed for the specific binding sites with a typical beta 1-adrenergic specificity. The beta-agonist cimaterol had no effect on either protein synthesis or degradation in fetal muscle cells. In cultures derived from satellite cells cimaterol significantly stimulated protein synthesis at concentrations of 10(-8) - 10(-7) M and at 10(-8) - 10(-6) M in the presence of serum. These effects were maintained if 10(-5) M propranolol was added to the incubation media, but were blocked by 10(-6) M isoproterenol. Propranolol and isoproterenol had no stimulatory effects on protein synthesis. Cimaterol also had no detectable effects on protein degradation or the transport of amino acids or glucose. It is concluded that although beta-adrenergic receptors are present in ovine muscle cultures they may not play a role in the anabolic effect of beta-agonists observed in cultured muscle cells.",
