L-Norepinephrine enhanced the [14C]DMO uptake in a concentration-dependent manner with half-maximal effect at about 1 microM and maximum effect at about 1 mM. The half-maximal effect corresponded to an increase in pHi by 0.08 units and was reduced by 2 microM L-propranolol (beta-adrenoceptor antagonist), but was not affected by 2 microM phentolamine (alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist). The results suggest that L-norepinephrine increases intracellular pH in rat parotid acini and that this effect may be mediated by beta-adrenoceptor stimulation.", 
    "1": "Whereas the phosphorolytic breakdown of liver glycogen is known to be of great physiological importance, the functional role of the hydrolytic glycogenolysis in the lysosomal system is less well understood. In the present study the effects of fasting, alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonism and insulin-induced hypoglycaemia on liver lysosomal glycogen-hydrolysing enzyme activity were investigated in mice. In freely fed mice the glycogen-hydrolysing activity (acid amyloglucosidase) was only 50% of the maltose-hydrolysing activity (acid maltase). Starvation for 24 h reduced the acid amyloglucosidase activity by approximately 30% (P less than 0.001), whereas the activities of acid maltase, acid phosphatase and beta-glucuronidase appeared unaffected. N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase activity was moderately (20%; P less than 0.01) enhanced by fasting. Thus, liver lysosomal enzyme activities may change independently of each other during fasting. Further, during short-term hypoglycaemic conditions (45 min) induced by endogenous or exogenous insulin, the activity of liver acid amyloglucosidase was found to be moderately reduced (15-20%). Blockade of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors by phentolamine and propranolol did not result in any apparent influence on acid amyloglucosidase activity except for the indirect effect exerted by the phentolamine-induced hypoglycaemia. A moderate negative correlation (r = -0.51; P less than 0.001) between total liver glycogen concentration and acid amyloglucosidase activity was observed in a series of 43 freely fed NMRI mice. Our data show that in mouse liver the acid maltase activity predominates over the acid amyloglucosidase activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "2": "A retrospective study of patients who probably had delirium tremens during hospitalization for alcohol dependency is reported. Predictors of delirium tremens were daily heavy alcohol use, a past history of delirium tremens, and a past history of alcohol withdrawal seizures. Management included general measures and specific therapy for complications. Mortality was only 4.9%, which reflects the improved management techniques now available. The use of multiple interventions proved most effective.", 
    "3": "The aetiology of the rise in plasma calbindin-D9K (vitamin D-induced calcium-binding protein; CaBP), following insulin-induced hypoglycaemia, was studied in the pig. ACTH led to a rise in plasma concentrations of both CaBP and cortisol. Metyrapone, which blocks cortisol synthesis, abolished the increases in plasma concentrations of CaBP and cortisol normally observed in response to insulin-induced hypoglycaemia. However, there was no significant rise in plasma concentrations of CaBP in response to pharmacological or physiological doses of cortisol. Injection of clonidine, an alpha 2-adrenergic agonist, led to a rise in plasma concentrations of CaBP, whereas phenylephrine, an alpha 1-adrenergic agonist, tended to exert an inhibitory effect. Also, administration of phentolamine (an alpha-adrenergic blocker) before injection of insulin abolished the usual increase in plasma concentrations of CaBP, whereas propranolol (a beta-adrenergic blocker) enhanced the normal increase in plasma concentrations of CaBP in response to insulin-induced hypoglycaemia. Isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic agonist, was without effect on plasma CaBP. Neither GH nor glucagon appear to be involved in the rise in plasma CaBP following insulin-induced hypoglycaemia. Although atropine abolished the effect of acute hypoglycaemia on plasma CaBP, carbamylcholine was without effect on plasma CaBP concentration. It is concluded that the increases in plasma CaBP induced by either ACTH or alpha 2-adrenergic stimulation may be interrelated since the administration of ACTH can lead to raised plasma concentrations of catecholamines.", 
    "4": "Bopindolol is a new long-acting, nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with partial agonist activity. Its acute (24 hours, 2 mg, administered orally) and long-term (3 weeks, 2 to 4 mg) hemodynamic and hormonal effects were studied in a single-blind placebo-controlled trial in 10 hypertensive subjects. The initial response (mean +/- SE) to bopindolol was a fall in cardiac output (-12% +/- 2%) and heart rate (-11% +/- 2%). Mean arterial pressure began to fall 3 to 4 hours after administration in parallel with a decrease in systemic vascular resistance, which had increased initially. Twenty-four hours after administration, mean arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance were reduced by 12% +/- 2% and 12% +/- 5%, respectively. By that time heart rate and cardiac output did not differ from baseline values despite beta-blockade. After 3 weeks of treatment mean arterial pressure had fallen by 9% +/- 2% and renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate were not changed. One week after withdrawal from treatment mean arterial pressure and heart rate were no longer reduced, but beta-blockade could still be demonstrated, establishing the long duration of action of the drug.", 
    "5": "This review examines the effects of beta-adrenergic blocking agents on blood lipids. These agents have been effective in the treatment of angina and hypertension and in the reduction of recurrence of ischemic cardiac disease, such as myocardial infarction. Many beta blockers, however, have an adverse effect on blood lipids, especially by reducing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and increasing triglycerides. One result is an unfavorable influence on the cholesterol ratio (expressed either as low-density lipoprotein [LDL]/HDL or total cholesterol/HDL). These cholesterol parameters have been shown to have a strong influence on coronary heart disease (CHD) risk. Studies have shown that antihypertensive therapy has reduced the incidence of cerebrovascular disease but, in many instances, has not reduced the incidence of CHD. A hypothesis for this lesser effect on coronary disease is that antihypertensive agents may be adversely affecting blood lipids. Thus, while one major risk factor for CHD is reduced, another may be somewhat enhanced. Pharmacologic properties of some beta blockers such as peripheral alpha blockade (e.g., with labetalol) or intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) (e.g., with pindolol) may counteract some of these negative lipid effects. An investigational beta blocker, bevantolol, which will be marketed shortly in the United States, has been effective in antihypertensive therapy. Bevantolol has been shown to lower LDL cholesterol and not adversely affect HDL cholesterol; in this way, bevantolol favorably influences the serum lipoprotein profile. Whether this effect will have clinical significance remains to be seen.", 
    "6": "Increased O2 consumption was found in rats after bilateral lesions of the lateral hypothalamus (LH) or during voluntary overeating. This phenomenon appears to be mediated by the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) in both conditions, since it is blocked by the beta-blocker propranolol administration. In the first experiment we showed that the brain cortex is involved in the thermogenesis induced by LH lesion and this effect is mediated by SNS, since bilateral functional decortication induced by cortical-spreading depression (CSD) impaired the increase of O2 consumption to the same extent as administration of propranolol. In the second experiment the role played by the cerebral cortex on thermogenesis in rats during voluntary overeating of \"cafeteria\" diet and in control rats was investigated. Cafeteria rats showed a significantly higher colonic temperature, brown adipose tissue temperature (Tbat), and rate of O2 consumption than control animals. CSD led to a significant decrease of Tbat and O2 consumption in cafeteria rats but not in controls. On the basis of the results obtained in the two experiments, the possibility that the cerebral cortex could be involved in the metabolic responses for reduction of body weight to the \"set-point\" is hypothesized.", 
    "7": "The number of membrane-bound beta-adrenoceptors is reduced in the myocardium of spontaneously hypertensive rats, and this decline may account for the decreased inotropic responsiveness to beta-agonists. It is not known, however, whether the total complement of cellular beta-receptors is lower in hypertensive animals. This issue was examined using two different approaches: acid elution of cell surface-bound beta-receptor ligands and comparison of the number of receptors in the plasma membrane and a postcytosolic vesicular fraction. Approximately 30% of the total beta-receptors were located intracellularly in Wistar-Kyoto rats compared with 42% for spontaneously hypertensive rats. Similarly, a decline in membrane-bound beta-receptors in hypertensive rats was balanced by a rise in receptors associated with the vesicular fraction. In contrast, alpha 1-adrenoceptors were higher in the membrane and lower in the vesicular fraction of hypertensive rats without a significant difference in total alpha-receptors compared with normotensive animals. Differences in adrenergic responsiveness in this, and perhaps other, models of cardiac hypertrophy reflect altered intracellular distribution of adrenoceptors, which may be under the control of the sympathetic nervous system.", 
    "8": "By sectioning spinal dorsal roots from C8 to T6, we analyzed the contribution of sympathetic cardiovascular afferent fibers to the reflex bradycardia induced by arterial pressure rises in 24 anesthetized and in 21 decerebrate cats. In anesthetized cats, the reflex bradycardia was obtained in 16 animals with occlusions of the thoracic aorta and in 8 animals with phenylephrine injections (25-75 micrograms/kg). In both experimental conditions, the dorsal root section enhanced the bradycardia response, which thus increased from 15 +/- 3 to 20 +/- 3% during aortic constrictions and from 11 +/- 3 to 19 +/- 6% during phenylephrine injections (P less than 0.05). The enhancement, after rhizotomy of the reflex bradycardia during aortic occlusion, was more pronounced in eleven decerebrate cats as it increased from 21 +/- 4 to 34 +/- 4%, P less than 0.05. In five vagotomized and decerebrate cats, the reflex bradycardia was also increased after rhizotomy despite the overall reduction of the reflex response. In five decerebrate cats with beta-adrenergic receptor blockade (propranolol 0.2-0.4 mg/kg iv), aortic occlusion resulted in a small reduction in heart rate which was not significantly affected by dorsal root section. Our data indicate that excitatory reflexes mediated by dorsal roots are likely to modulate the inhibitory supraspinal reflexes that determine the heart rate reduction during acute rises in arterial blood pressure.", 
    "9": "To determine the relative importance of the mechanisms utilized by the arterial baroreflex in buffering the pressor and vasoconstrictor responses to alpha-adrenergic receptor agonists, we studied responses to norepinephrine and phenylephrine in conscious dogs. The dogs were studied 2-8 wk after instrumentation with aortic catheters and aortic electromagnetic flow probes to measure arterial pressure and cardiac output. Total peripheral resistance was calculated on-line by a digital computer. The dogs were studied after beta-adrenergic receptor blockade (propranolol 1.0 mg/kg) to eliminate the complicating inotropic effects of the agonists studied. Norepinephrine (0.2 microgram/kg bolus) increased mean arterial pressure by 30 +/- 3 mmHg, total peripheral resistance by 51 +/- 4 mmHg . l-1 . min-1, and decreased heart rate by 26 +/- 3 beats/min. After arterial baroreceptor denervation, norepinephrine increased mean arterial pressure by 69 +/- 8 mmHg, total peripheral resistance by 48 +/- 6 mmHg . l-1 . min-1, and heart rate did not change. After ganglionic blockade (hexamethonium 40 mg/kg), norepinephrine increased mean arterial pressure by 76 +/- 3 mmHg, total peripheral resistance by 47 +/- 4 mmHg X l-1 X min-1, and heart rate did not change. Only after elimination of the buffering by heart rate by use of cholinergic receptor blockade (atropine 0.1 mg/kg) or ventricular pacing could buffering of the vasoconstrictor responses to alpha-adrenergic receptor agonists be demonstrated. Thus in conscious dogs the primary mechanism for buffering increases in arterial pressure induced by alpha-adrenergic receptor agonists is compensatory changes in heart rate and cardiac output with little buffering of total peripheral resistance.", 
    "10": "We have developed a model in pregnant sheep to investigate pharmacological agents used for suppression of preterm labor. This model allows repetitive determinations of uterine contractility and simultaneous measurements of myometrial receptor and postreceptor events. We used the model to study the beta-adrenergic agent ritodrine. We infused 11 pregnant sheep with ritodrine and 3 with physiological saline for 24 h. Oxytocin boluses were given before and at 5 and 22 h after onset of the infusion. Myometrial biopsies were obtained before and immediately after the infusion. After 22 h of ritodrine infusion, uterine contractility in response to the same oxytocin bolus was 50% greater than at 5 h (P less than 0.02). Myometrial membrane beta-adrenergic receptor density decreased 49% (P less than 0.005), and catecholamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was reduced 70% (P less than 0.005). The model thus demonstrates that use of the beta-adrenergic agonist ritodrine in a clinically relevant manner results in tachyphylaxis of its effects on both physiological parameters and the receptor cascade system.", 
    "11": "It is now generally accepted that hypertension-induced left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) represents a phenomenon of multifactorial origin. Antihypertensive therapy with beta-blocking drugs influences most of the factors involved in the control of left ventricular mass. Therefore, although initial animal experiments yielded conflicting results, it is not surprising that a great deal of evidence has been accumulated in clinical studies showing that successful long-term antihypertensive treatment with beta blockers induces regression of LVH in hypertensive subjects. Differences in molecular structure among various beta-blocking agents do not seem to influence this property. On the contrary, the question of whether reversal of LVH represents a beneficial or harmful byproduct of antihypertensive treatment with beta blockers is still unanswered. Animal and clinical studies suggest that left ventricular systolic function is unchanged or even improved after regression of LVH, whereas the ability of the heart to withstand recurrence of hypertension is slightly reduced. Furthermore, development of LVH in hypertensive subjects is associated with abnormalities in diastolic function which are not reduced by reversal of LVH induced by antihypertensive treatment with beta blockers.", 
    "12": "Two methods are available for exploring arrhythmias in cardiac patients who are at risk of sudden death: Holter monitoring and invasive electrophysiology. Despite numerous studies, the predictive value of these techniques, in terms of prognosis, remains poor for many reasons. Neither technique considered individually can give reliable prognostic indications simply because each technique addresses different issues which are only partially involved in the mechanism of sudden death. Invasive electrophysiology, by artificially provoking an arrhythmia, detects the potential substrate which may ultimately lead to lethal arrhythmias. Although this is an important technique it is insufficient because merely identifying the substrate for an arrhythmia does not necessarily mean that arrhythmia will occur. On the other hand, ambulatory ECG allows monitoring of spontaneous arrhythmias which may be considered as potential initiating factors in arrhythmias. However, even if initiating factors and potential substrates are present, they are not sufficient conditions to cause lethal arrhythmias to occur. When there is an opportunity to scrutinize the mechanism of arrhythmias which are indeed lethal, as in sudden death, it appears that the lethal event results from the intervention of a new factor which was either absent or not considered during preceding investigations. In coronary patients, curiously, ischemia more often provokes cardiac arrest or an electromechanical dissociation rather than a ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. Sudden death is not infrequently of iatrogenic origin, because of the arrhythmogenic effect of powerful antiarrhythmic drugs. More important, ventricular fibrillation often occurs in the setting of a progressively increased sympathetic tone, which explains either the particular seriousness of a previously known arrhythmia or the occurrence of an arrhythmia which was never before observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "13": "Esmolol (Brevibloc) is an intravenous, short-acting, titratable, cardioselective beta blocker with a very rapid onset and offset of action (t1/2 = 9.2 minutes). Esmolol-induced beta blockade can be maintained as long as infusion is continued. It exhibits neither intrinsic sympathomimetic activity nor significant membrane-stabilizing activity. It is rapidly metabolized by an esterase in the erythrocyte cytosol to an inactive acid metabolite. Its hemodynamic and electrophysiologic effects are similar to those of other beta blockers. Unlike the effects of other beta blockers, however, the effects of esmolol dissipate rapidly to baseline within 30 minutes after its discontinuation. Evidence obtained from clinical studies indicates that esmolol is effective and safe in reducing the ventricular rate in patients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, and in reducing the heart rate in patients with acute myocardial infarction and/or unstable angina. Esmolol has also been shown to be effective and safe in attenuating the tachycardia and hypertension seen during the intraoperative period. Data from postoperative patients indicate that esmolol is ideal as sole-agent therapy for the treatment of moderate postoperative hypertension associated with a hyperdynamic state. The short duration of action and titratability of esmolol make it an ideal drug for use in patients in whom the clinical need for beta blockade is limited in duration, and it offers additional safety in patients in whom beta blockade is beneficial; however, it might be precluded because of coexisting contraindications. To date, experience with esmolol in over 1200 patients has been gathered, and the adverse effect profile is basically similar to that reported here.", 
    "14": "In order to evaluate the role of opiate, dopaminergic and adrenergic systems in the mechanism of hypothalamo-pituitary disturbances in obesity, 9 obese women and 14 healthy women were investigated. Serum GH, LH, beta-endorphin and cortisol concentrations were measured after administration of clonidine, an alpha 2-adrenergic receptor agonist, and naloxone, an opiate antagonist. Additionally, PRL levels were measured after administration of the dopamine receptor blocker metoclopramide. An impaired GH response to clonidine and naloxone was found in obese women. However, a marked increase in beta-endorphin was observed in obese patients after clonidine administration. Naloxone did not cause any significant change in beta-endorphin release. Neither clonidine nor naloxone induced any change in LH release. Serum PRL concentrations in response to metoclopramide were significantly higher in obese patients than in healthy women.", 
    "15": "Disturbed activity in opiate, adrenergic, and dopaminergic systems may be of pathogenetic importance in a hypothalamo-pituitary dysfunction in obesity. The occurrence of hypothalamic amenorrhoea as well as the presence of abnormalities of the central nervous system regulation of GH, PRL, ACTH, cortisol, insulin and vasopressin output might point to a generalized hypothalamo-pituitary dysfunction in obesity.", 
    "16": "Effects of neural blockages on pancreatic enzyme secretion in response to infusing fatty acid into the lumen were investigated using anesthetized rats, equipped with bile-pancreatic and duodenal cannulae, to evaluate the relative contribution of the neural and the hormonal mediations in the pancreatic response. Oleate (0.2 ml) was injected as a bolus into the rat duodenum, and the trypsin output in bile-pancreatic juice was monitored to determine the pancreatic enzyme secretion response with continuous return of bile-pancreatic juice to the intestine. When anticholinergic agents such as atropine sulfate and scopolamine were administrated, although basal level in pancreatic enzyme secretion fell, the increase of pancreatic enzyme secretion from basal level after stimulation by oleate was not significantly different from that of the control (no blockage). However, the ganglion blocker, hexamethonium, inhibited the pancreatic enzyme secretion in response to oleate by 94%. An adrenergic blocker, guanethidine, also led to as much of a decrease as the ganglion blocker-induced decrease. Adrenergic alpha- and beta-blockers partially, but not completely, inhibited the enzyme secretion. Adrenergic blockage also suppressed the basal level in pancreatic enzyme secretion. On the other hand, a specific CCK antagonist, proglumide, significantly inhibited pancreatic enzyme secretion induced by oleate in the presence of scopolamine. These observations suggest that pancreatic enzyme secretion in response to oleate is primarily mediated by CCK and that adrenergic modulation may play an important role in the CCK-mediated pancreatic enzyme secretion in response to oleate, although interpretation of these results may have some restriction related to anesthesia.", 
    "17": "The effect of age on the density and the affinity of beta adrenergic receptors was determined in the hearts of Fischer 344 rats at three ages, 6, 12, and 24 months old. The binding of the beta adrenergic antagonist 125I-iodohydroxybenzylpindolol (IHYP), was used to quantitate and characterize cardiac beta adrenergic receptors. The maximal number of binding sites (Bmax = F moles/mg of protein) were 26.3 +/- 2.5, 25.4 +/- 0.99, and 24.5 +/- 2.4 and the dissociation constants (Kd = nM) were 0.166 +/- 0.014, 0.126 +/- 0.006, and 0.135 +/- 0.015 for 6, 12, and 24 months old animals, respectively. There were no significant differences among the three ages. These results support the contention that neither beta adrenergic receptor density or affinity changes with age in the ventricles of the rat heart.", 
    "18": "In a double-blind trial of streptokinase for acute myocardial infarction, 219 consecutive patients presenting with infarction within four hours (mean, 3.0 +/- 0.8) of the onset of chest pain were randomly assigned to treatment with streptokinase (1.5 million units) or placebo, given intravenously over 30 minutes. The primary end point of the study was left ventricular function in patients with first infarctions. Patients who could undergo beta-blockade also received intravenous propranolol. Heparin (for 48 hours) and a combination of low-dose aspirin and dipyridamole were administered to both groups until cineangiography was performed at three weeks. In the patients with first infarctions treated with streptokinase, the left ventricular ejection fraction was 6 percentage points higher (streptokinase vs. placebo, 59 +/- 10.5 vs. 53 +/- 13.5 percent; P less than 0.005), with benefit to patients with either anterior infarction (57 +/- 11.9 vs. 49 +/- 15.9 percent; P less than 0.05) or inferior infarction (60 +/- 9.1 vs. 55 +/- 11.3 percent; P less than 0.05). Left ventricular function was improved regardless of whether concomitant propranolol was given. Survival (at 30 days) was improved with streptokinase: 2 deaths occurred among 79 patients who received this drug, as compared with 12 deaths among 93 patients who received placebo (2.5 vs. 12.9 percent, P = 0.012). Rates of reinfarction (streptokinase vs. placebo, 3 vs. 1 percent) and requirements for surgery or angioplasty (7 vs. 5 percent) were similar in the two groups. We conclude that administration of intravenous streptokinase (1.5 million units) to patients with a first myocardial infarction results in improved left ventricular function and short-term survival.", 
    "19": "In experiments on the isolated guinea-pig left atrium we tried to get more information about the intracellular signal transmission of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor. We were able to demonstrate that the cyclooxygenase inhibitors indometacin and acetylsalicylic acid enhance the positive inotropic effect of relatively low phenylephrine concentrations at an extracellular calcium concentration of 1.22 mmol/l. Preincubation with prazosin as well as an increased calcium concentration of 2.5 mmol/l abolished this effect. These observations led us to suppose that an elevated level of receptor-generated arachidonic acid, whose degradation is inhibited by the cyclooxygenase inhibitors, caused the increased contractility by releasing more calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Under these conditions also lithium caused a distinct enhancement of the positive inotropic effect evoked by alpha 1-adrenergic agonists, probably by inhibiting the degradation of the second messenger inositol trisphosphate.", 
    "20": "The effect of BFE-55, a derivative of befunolol (a beta-adrenergic partial agonist) on specific [3H]befunolol binding to a microsomal fraction from the guinea pig taenia caecum was tested. A Scatchard plot of specific [3H]befunolol binding in the absence of BFE-55 was concave, suggesting an existence of high and low affinity sites in beta-adrenoceptors. In contrast, the Scatchard plot of data in the presence of BFE-55 (3 X 10(-7) M) was straight. In the presence of BFE-55, the high affinity sites disappeared and the low affinity site was unaffected. In the absence and presence of BFE-55 there was no difference between the pKD values or Bmax values at the low affinity site. These findings indicate that BFE-55 interacts with only the high affinity sites in beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "21": "The present investigation was undertaken to demonstrate saturable beta 2-adrenoceptor binding sites on cell membranes of bovine lymphocytes by means of the non-selective antagonist (3H)dihydroalprenolol. Although the classical density gradient centrifugation technique was used as described for the isolation of these cells from human blood, striking differences in binding characteristics were observed. It is suggested that differences in physical properties of blood might be responsible for these phenomena. Since receptor density and affinity of beta 2-adrenoceptors in lymphocytes are used in human medicine (and will be in the future in veterinary medicine) for correlation with several physiological and pathophysiological conditions, attention is drawn to the effect of dilution of blood during the preparation of these cells; in lactating cows, the best results were obtained with the dilution 1:0.5.", 
    "22": "This study was designed to determine if chronic treatment with delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) alters cardiac beta-adrenoceptors in the rat. Following daily oral administration of 10 or 20 mg/kg THC or an equivalent volume of control solvent for 90 days, rats were sacrificed, and sarcolemmal membranes were prepared from ventricular myocardium. Beta-adrenoceptor density and binding affinity estimated with (-)[3H]dihydroalprenolol; a beta-adrenergic antagonist, were not significantly affected by treatment with THC when compared to vehicle controls. These results suggest that the tolerance to cardiovascular effects of THC which develops during chronic exposure in the rat is not associated with alterations in cardiac beta-adrenoceptors as monitored by radiolabeled antagonist binding.", 
    "23": "The renal hemodynamic response to renal arterial infusions of norepinephrine was compared to epinephrine infusions during renal alpha-adrenoceptor blockade in chronically instrumented and unanesthetized fetal (127-141 days gestation; term 145 days), newborn (6-10 days old), and nonpregnant adult sheep. Infusions of either catecholamines produced renal vasodilation which was of greater magnitude in fetal compared to newborn and adult sheep. Maximal increases in renal blood flow velocity during norepinephrine infusion were 64 +/- 5% in fetal, 23 +/- 4% in newborn, and 24 +/- 7% in adult sheep (p less than 0.001). Similar age-dependent increases in renal blood flow velocity were observed during epinephrine infusion, with maximal changes being 74 +/- 10% in fetal, 23 +/- 4% in newborn, and 19 +/- 4% in adult sheep (p less than 0.001). Increases in renal blood flow velocity produced by both norepinephrine and epinephrine infusions were completely inhibited by intrarenal infusion of ICI 118,551, a beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist. Taken together, these results suggest that the renal vascular beta 2-adrenergic receptor that mediates vasodilation may be stimulated by both norepinephrine and epinephrine with equal potency. In addition, results of this study demonstrate that enhanced beta 2-adrenoceptor mediated renal vasodilatory capacity is observed during fetal life.", 
    "24": "1 Receptor autoradiography using (-)-[125I]-cyanopindolol (CYP) was used to study the distribution of beta-adrenoceptor subtypes in human right atrial appendage, left atrial free wall, left ventricular papillary muscle and pericardium. 2 The binding of (-)-[125I]-CYP to slide-mounted tissue sections of human right atrial appendage was time-dependent (K1 = 4.11 +/- 1.01 X 10(8) M-1 min-1, K-1 = 1.47 +/- 0.25 X 10(-3) min-1, n = 3), saturable (42.02 +/- 2.96 pM, n = 4) and stereoselective with respect to the optical isomers of propranolol (pKD (-):8.97 +/- 0.02, (+):6.88 +/- 0.06, n = 3). 3 The proportions of beta-adrenoceptor subtypes were determined in slide-mounted tissue sections using the antagonists CGP 20712A (beta 1-selective) and ICI 118,551 (beta 2-selective). In right atrial appendage and left ventricular papillary muscle 40% (34-45%) of the beta-adrenoceptors were of the beta 2-subtype. 4 Images from X-ray film and nuclear emulsion coated coverslips exposed to (-)-[125I]-CYP-labelled sections showed an even distribution of beta-adrenoceptor subtypes over the myocardium of the right atrial appendage, left ventricular papillary muscle and left atrial free wall. Sections of pericardium exhibited predominantly beta 2-adrenoceptors. beta 2-Adrenoceptors were localized to the intimal surface of coronary arteries. 5 The selective beta 1-adrenoceptor agonist RO363 and beta 2-selective agonist procaterol produced concentration-dependent inotropic responses in right atrial appendage strips. Responses to RO363 were antagonized by CGP 20712A (pKB = 9.29) suggesting an interaction with beta 1-adrenoceptors. Responses to procaterol were antagonized by ICI 118,551 (pKB = 9.06) suggesting an interaction at beta 2-adrenoceptors. 6 The finding that a significant proportion of human myocardial adrenoceptors are of the beta 2-subtype has important clinical implications for the involvement of these receptors in the control of heart rate and force, and the autoradiographic evidence suggests other roles in the coronary vasculature and pericardium.", 
    "25": "A new assay technique for the determination of neurotransmitter binding in retinal fragments has been used to characterize and quantify beta-adrenergic receptors with the ligand [3H]CGP-12177. This assay allowed us to quantify beta-adrenergic receptors in the retina, pineal gland, and hypothalamus obtained from individual rats during a 10-hr period around the switch from light to dark under a 12-hr light/12-hr dark lighting cycle. A significant rhythm of beta-adrenergic binding was observed in the retina and pineal gland. These rhythms were abolished by chronic lithium treatment. In contrast to previous observations in whole brain preparations, lithium did not affect beta-adrenergic binding in brain tissue (hypothalamus) using this assay. Our data suggest that lithium may attenuate beta-adrenergic receptor down-regulation in pineal and retinal tissue. To the extent that this mechanism is important for the coding of information about light and dark in the environment, these observations might assist in our understanding of the clinical chronopharmacological properties reported for lithium.", 
    "26": "Numerous data have suggested that beta-adrenoceptor-mediated responses were decreased in uremia and that parathormone could be implicated in this phenomenon. In a previous paper we have shown that the beta2 receptor density of mononuclear cells of uremic patients is significantly increased despite a significant increase in plasma epinephrine, suggesting that an endogenous substance could interfere and disregulate the beta 2 receptor density. In order to further evaluate this phenomenon we have firstly studied the influence of one non uremic and five uremic plasma ultrafiltrates on the binding of (-)-[125I]iodocyanopindolol using rat lung beta adrenoceptors. The results show that uremic plasma ultrafiltrates induce a decrease in the Bmax value without any variation on the Kd value. In a second step we have assessed the ability of human synthetic 1-34 and 53-84 parathormone to interact directly with beta-adrenoceptors. No variation in the (-)-[125I]iodocyanopindolol binding parameters was observed. These results suggest that an uremic endogenous substance might interfere on the beta adrenergic receptors and that the alteration in the beta-adrenergic response in uremia is probably not due to a direct action of parathormone on the beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "27": "We tested the hypothesis that beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation is involved with the increase in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) during hypoglycemia. Rats were surgically prepared with the use of halothane-nitrous oxide anesthesia. A plaster restraining cast was placed around the hindquarters, and anesthesia was discontinued. Hypoglycemia was produced by an intravenous injection of insulin (15 U/kg); normoglycemic control rats were given saline. Propranolol (1.5 mg/kg) was administered to some control and some hypoglycemic rats to block the beta-adrenergic receptors. Regional CBF was measured using 4-[N-methyl-14C]iodoantipyrine. Plasma glucose in the normoglycemic and hypoglycemic groups was approximately 6 and 1.4 mumol/ml, respectively. Regional CBF increased during hypoglycemia in rats that were not treated with propranolol. The increase varied from approximately 60 to 200% depending on the brain region. During hypoglycemia, propranolol abolished the increase in rCBF in the hypothalamus, cerebellum, and pyramidal tract. In other regions the increase in rCBF was only 33-65% of the increase in hypoglycemic rats that were not treated with propranolol. We conclude that beta-receptor stimulation plays a major role in the increase in rCBF during hypoglycemia.", 
    "28": "Electrophysiological response to isoproterenol stimulation was studied in isolated perfused salamander proximal tubules. The addition of 10(-5) M isoproterenol to the bath superfusate depolarized both the cell membrane, and transepithelial potentials by 2.2 +/- 0.2 and 0.31 +/- 0.04 mV, respectively (P less than 0.01, n = 35) and significantly reduced the apical-to-basolateral membrane resistance ratio by 30% (P less than 0.01, n = 7) from a control value of 3.7 +/- 0.6. These responses were blocked by 10(-6) M propranolol but not mimicked by 10(-4) M adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate. Qualitatively similar effects were observed with 10(-3) and 10(-7) M isoproterenol. Further characterization of the 10(-5) M isoproterenol response revealed 1) a 50% reduction in the response following the removal of organic substrates from the luminal perfusate, 2) an absolute requirement for sodium, and 3) an absolute requirement for a functioning basolateral Na+-K+-ATPase. The data suggest that beta-receptor stimulation may increase sodium reabsorption by activating sodium cotransport systems.", 
    "29": "During prolonged exercise, the free fatty acids derived from adipocyte lipolysis are the principal fuel utilized by muscles. In humans, the lipid mobilization from adipose tissue is mainly regulated by insulin and catecholamines: the latter hormones have both beta-adrenergic stimulatory and alpha 2-adrenergic inhibitory effects on lipolysis. The aim of this study was to determine whether rapid alterations in the peripheral action of the regulatory hormones occur during physical work and whether they are of importance for the enhanced lipid mobilization. The acute effects of exercise on the regulation of lipolysis were investigated in isolated adipocytes removed from the gluteal region of 14 healthy volunteers before and immediately after the exercise period. Exercise induced a 20-35% significant increase in the lipolytic response to noradrenaline alone and in combination with the selective alpha 2-antagonist yohimbine and to the pure beta-agonist isoproterenol in isolated adipocytes. The antilipolytic effects of both the alpha 2-agonist clonidine and insulin were unaffected by exercise. Exercise did not influence the specific adipocyte receptor binding of 125I-cyanopindolol (beta-adrenergic receptor), [3H]yohimbine (alpha-adrenergic receptor), and mono-125I-[Tyr A14]insulin (insulin receptor). In conclusion, a single period of submaximal exercise increases adipocyte lipolytic responsiveness to catecholamines through an increased beta-adrenoceptor-mediated effect at steps distal to the receptor binding. Thus the increased peripheral action of catecholamines may be of importance for the observed enhanced lipid mobilization during physical work.", 
    "30": "Myocardial hypertrophy in vivo is associated with reexpression of contractile protein isogenes characteristic of fetal and neonatal development. The molecular signals for hypertrophy and isogene switching are unknown. We studied alpha (sarcomeric)-actin messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in cultured cardiac myocytes from the neonatal rat. In the cultured cells, as in the adult heart in vivo, expression of cardiac alpha-actin (cACT) predominated over that of skeletal alpha-actin (sACT) mRNA, the fetal/neonatal isoform. alpha 1-Adrenergic receptor stimulation induced hypertrophy of these cells, increasing total RNA and cytoskeletal actin mRNA by 1.8-fold over control, and total alpha-actin mRNA by 4.3 fold. This disproportionate increase in total alpha-actin mRNA was produced by a preferential induction of sACT mRNA, which increased by 10.6-fold over control versus only 2.6-fold for cACT mRNA. The alpha 1-adrenoceptor is the first identified molecular mediator of early developmental isogene reexpression in cardiac myocyte hypertrophy.", 
    "31": "Ocular sympathetic nerves were stimulated chronically in awake rabbits using electrodes unilaterally implanted on the cervical sympathetic trunk. IOP was measured by pneumatonometry and aqueous inflow was measured by fluorophotometry. In each animal, continuous trains of 1 msec pulses were delivered by means of a portable electrical stimulator. Experiments were spaced by 1 week recovery periods. Stimulation was varied over a range of amplitudes (5-15 V) and frequencies (3-12 Hz). Continuous sympathetic stimulation produced an immediate sharp decrease in IOP followed by a gradual rise to pre-stimulation values which were attained 60-90 min after onset. A rebound increase in IOP occurred when stimulation was terminated. The magnitude of the initial IOP drop, the delay in the return to pre-stimulation IOP, and the rebound rise in IOP subsequent to termination of electrical stimulation were proportional to the stimulation frequency. Maximal effects were observed at 12 Hz, and stimulation with 8-10 Hz for 180 min caused a sustained reduction in anterior chamber aqueous humor flow. Topical 2% phentolamine 1 hr before stimulation markedly reduced IOP and abolished the acute IOP changes observed in untreated stimulated animals. Topical 1% timolol did not affect either the initial IOP drop or the rebound; however, the IOP recovered during stimulation to values greater than pre-stimulation IOP. We conclude that in rabbits the beta-adrenergic effect of prolonged sympathetic nerve stimulation is to decrease aqueous flow. Chronic electrical stimulation in awake animals provides an experimental model for studying the role of the ocular sympathetic nerves.", 
    "32": "The beta-adrenoceptor-blocking and class III effects of sotalol were assessed in 11 patients with inducible orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia. Serum sotalol concentration, maximum exercise heart rate, and electrophysiologic study data were obtained at control, at the beta-adrenoceptor-blocking dosage (407 +/- 149 mg/day, 1.4 +/- 0.5 micrograms/ml), and at the maximum well-tolerated dosage (924 +/- 337 mg/day, 3.2 +/- 1.3 micrograms/ml). Class III effects (increases in anterograde and retrograde accessory connection effective refractory periods, ventricular effective refractory period, and the QT interval during fixed-rate atrial pacing) were evident at the beta-adrenoceptor-blocking dosage of sotalol and became more marked at the maximum well-tolerated dosage. For example, the mean anterograde accessory connection effective refractory period was significantly increased over control (272 +/- 41 msec) by the beta-adrenoceptor blocker (324 +/- 52 msec) and was further significantly increased by the maximum well-tolerated dose (364 +/- 37 msec). Similarly, the minimum preexcited RR interval during atrial fibrillation was increased in all patients at each dosage tested. Antiarrhythmic efficacy, defined by the absence of inducible, sustained, orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia and a minimum preexcited RR interval during atrial fibrillation of 300 msec or greater, was achieved in four patients at the beta-adrenoceptor-blocking dosage and in another four patients at the maximum well-tolerated dosage. These eight patients received long-term sotalol therapy and none has had recurrent, sustained reciprocating tachycardia during 15 +/- 12 months of follow-up.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "33": "The muscarinic agonist carbachol has previously been shown to reverse positive inotropic responses of rabbit left atrial strips to equiactive doses of the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol and to the alpha-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine. Responses to phenylephrine were measured in the presence of the beta-blocker timolol. However, carbachol was not able to reverse the increase in tension produced by elevating the extracellular Ca2+ concentration. To gain more information about the nature of the functional interaction of carbachol with alpha- and beta-receptor stimulants in left atria, the interaction of carbachol with these agonists, as well as with elevated Ca2+ and the Ca2+ activator compound BAY K 8644, was compared with that of the Ca2+ antagonists D-600 and nifedipine. The results demonstrate that the Ca2+ antagonists exhibit a selectivity similar to that of carbachol, in that responses to both isoproterenol and phenylephrine plus timolol were blocked by low concentrations of D-600 and nifedipine, which had no effect on positive inotropic responses to elevated Ca2+. Higher concentrations of these antagonists shifted the Ca2+ dose-response curve to the right. In addition, although phenylephrine and BAY K 8644 increased tension to a similar extent, responses to phenylephrine were more sensitive than responses to BAY K 8644 to inhibition by both carbachol and D-600. These similarities between the effects of low concentrations of D-600 and nifedipine and those of carbachol are consistent with the hypothesis that carbachol antagonizes responses to alpha- and beta-receptor stimulation in left atria primarily by blocking increases in Ca2+ influx produced by these agonists.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "34": "The accumulation by purified immature porcine Leydig and Sertoli cells of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate in the presence of 1-methyl-3-isobuthylxathine was studied and their respective testosterone and 17 beta-estradiol production in response to catecholamines was assessed in vitro. These substances increased both basal and FSH-stimulated cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate accumulation in Sertoli cells. In contrast, catecholamines slightly enhanced basal cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate production but inhibited its human chorionic gonadotropin-stimulated accumulation by Leydig cells. Catecholamines had no effect on basal and stimulated testosterone release by these cells, while dopamine inhibited 17 beta-estradiol synthesis by Sertoli cells. Using various alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists, beta-receptors, likely of the beta 1-subtype, were shown to be present in both cell lines. Taken together these data suggest the presence of a cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-linked adrenergic receptor in porcine Leydig and Sertoli cells, the role of which remains to be determined.", 
    "35": "Blood gamma-endorphin concentrations were repeatedly measured, using an original radioimmunoassay, in patients with myocardial infarction. In the early days of acute myocardial infarction, high levels of this opioid peptide were observed, then plasma gamma-endorphin concentration gradually decreased by the time of discharge. In patients with grave complications, gamma-endorphin level was significantly lower, as compared to patients with uncomplicated infarction.", 
    "36": "Phencyclidine mainly produced head-weaving and head-twitches at doses of 5-7.5 mg/kg and of 7.5-12.5 mg/kg, respectively. Phencyclidine-induced head-twitches and head-weaving were blocked by pretreatment with ritanserin (1 mg/kg), a selective serotonin (5-HT)2 receptor antagonist and with pindolol (20 mg/kg, s.c.), a 5-HT1 receptor antagonist, respectively. In reserpine-pretreated rats, the degree of utilization of 5-HT and the number of 5-HT1 ([3H]5-HT) and 5-HT2 ([3H]ketanserin) binding sites were significantly increased compared with the figures for the vehicle-pretreated rats. The intensity of phencyclidine-induced head-weaving (at the dose of 2.5 mg/kg) and head-twitch (at the doses of 2.5 and 5 mg/kg) was significantly increased in reserpine-pretreated rats compared with that of vehicle-pretreated rats. Furthermore, in the reserpine-pretreated rats, the intensity of phencyclidine (1.25 mg/kg)-induced head-weaving and head-twitches was increased in combination with imipramine, while the intensity of phencyclidine (2.5 mg/kg)-induced head-weaving and head-twitch was decreased by pretreatment with mianserin, a non-selective 5-HT receptor antagonist. These results indicate that phencyclidine induced head-weaving by interacting with 5-HT1 receptors, indirectly after the release of 5-HT and/or with some other mechanisms and induced head-twitch by interacting with 5-HT2 receptors directly and/or indirectly.", 
    "37": "The acute hemodynamic responses to beta-adrenoceptor blockade with the beta 1-selective antagonist metoprolol, and to combined alpha/beta-receptor blockade with labetalol, were compared intraindividually in a randomized single-blind, cross-over study. Fourteen patients with proved ischemic heart disease, aged 52-64 years, were studied at rest (supine) and during ischemia-inducing exercise (in the seated posture) using invasive percutaneous techniques. Metoprolol reduced heart rates and cardiac output greatly (p less than 0.001) and systemic arterial pressures slightly (p less than 0.001) under all conditions. Left ventricular filling pressures increased. Labetalol induced a slight decrease in heart rates during exercise, while cardiac output was unchanged. Systemic arterial pressures and vascular resistances, pressures and resistances in the pulmonary circulation, and left ventricular filling pressures were distinctly lower. During ischemia-inducing exercise, the differences between the effects of labetalol and metoprolol on heart rate, cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance, and left ventricular filling pressures were highly significant. The effects on the rate X pressure product and on angina were similar. It is concluded that combined alpha/beta-blockade with labetalol offsets or attenuates the potential adverse hemodynamic effects of beta-receptor blockade alone without loss of symptomatic efficacy.", 
    "38": "Prejunctional beta-adrenoceptor-mediated modulation of sympathetic neurotransmission was studied in desipramine-pretreated canine blood-perfused gracilis muscle. Overflow of endogenous noradrenaline (NA) to venous plasma and vasoconstriction reflect pre- and postjunctional events in this in vivo model. The nonselective beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline (15 nM in arterial plasma) and the beta 2-selective agonist rimiterol (50 nM) caused similar vasodilatation (35-40% increase in vascular conductance, p less than 0.01), enhancement of nerve stimulation-evoked vasoconstriction (+20-25%, p less than 0.01), and NA overflow (+13%, p less than 0.05). Isoprenaline, 3 nM, evoked vasodilatation but did not alter NA overflow. Blockade of beta 2-adrenoceptors by ICI 118,551 increased basal vascular tone (+9%, p less than 0.01) and reduced nerve stimulation-evoked vasoconstriction (-7%, p less than 0.05), but failed to alter NA overflow significantly (-12%, p = 0.12). ICI 118,551 blocked all responses to the beta-adrenoceptor agonists. Thus, prejunctional beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated facilitation of sympathetic neurotransmission could be demonstrated in vivo, but the effects were modest. Previous experiments, however, have demonstrated a considerably larger influence of alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated prejunctional modulation in this model. Hence, prejunctional modulation via beta-adrenoceptors appears to be of subordinate importance when compared with the alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated inhibitory mechanism under these physiological conditions.", 
    "39": "A variety of compounds were examined for their capacity to alter RNA synthesis in isolated rat cardiac and hepatic mitochondria. The beta-adrenergic blocking agents propranolol and butoxamine, and the antiarrhythmic agent quinidine, produced a concentration-dependent stimulation of RNA synthesis in cardiac and hepatic mitochondria. In contrast, the antitubercular antibiotic rifampicin produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of RNA synthesis in cardiac and hepatic mitochondria. Propranolol, as a representative compound which stimulated RNA synthesis, was also found to stimulate ATP synthesis in isolated mitochondria, whereas rifampicin inhibited ATP synthesis. Coordinate increases and decreases in RNA and ATP syntheses suggest that agents which stimulate or inhibit RNA synthesis may rapidly alter ATP synthesis. This finding is consistent with the rapid turn-over of mitochondrial RNA with a messenger function (1.4 and 3.3 min in isolated rat cardiac and hepatic mitochondria), and it suggests that mitochondrial RNA must continue to be synthesized to maintain inner membrane systems required for ATP synthesis. Stimulation of RNA and ATP syntheses by propranolol through membrane stabilization or other actions represents a heretofore unrecognized action of propranolol which may contribute to its beneficial therapeutic effects.", 
    "40": "Penbutolol has proved particularly effective and suitable for the treatment, even on a long-term basis, of recently developed hypertension, especially in its hyperkinetic forms. The drug produces minimal side effects, is well tolerated and gives an early therapeutic response. In addition penbutolol does not cause any significant alterations in the biohumoral parameters of the patients treated and is ideal for combination with dihydralazine, reserpine and dihydrochlorotiazide in the treatment of more stubborn cases, making it possible to reduce the doses of the other drugs without causing bradycardia.", 
    "41": "Cysteamine-induced duodenal ulceration in rats is accompanied by increased circulating gastrin. Although cysteamine appears to exert a direct action on the gastrin cell some groups have provided evidence for an involvement of the autonomic nervous system. The current experiments were performed to determine whether beta-adrenergic or cholinergic (muscarinic) pathways are involved in the acute effect of cysteamine on gastrin secretion in the isolated perfused rat stomach. Cysteamine (1 mM) increased gastrin (IRG) secretion to a maximum ranging between 100% and 192% above basal. A cysteamine concentration of 5mM resulted in peak levels ranging between 150% and 1050% above basal. Addition of atropine or propranalol did not influence the responses obtained. The present results, therefore, do not support a role for either cholinergic or beta-adrenergic pathways in cysteamine-induced gastrin release at the level of the stomach and suggest that in vivo such autonomic effects are mediated extrinsically.", 
    "42": "Attempts at preventing total and sudden cardiac death after myocardial infarction can only succeed if its mechanisms and its contributing of determinant factors are known. It is now well established that sudden deaths account for one-half of mortality cases and that in the vast majority of cases these deaths are due to malignant ventricular arrhythmia. Several sudden death risk factors have been identified, including ventricular dysrhythmias, left ventricular dysfunction and myocardial ischaemia. A number of therapeutic trials on the prevention of post-infarction death have been conducted, but so far only beta-blockers have proved effective in reducing the incidence of total and sudden cardiac death. It is permissible to think, however, that other, discerningly selected treatments might also be effective.", 
    "43": "During 1983, 15% of admissions to the medical ward of Kaitaia Hospital resulted from ill effects of prescribed medication. Tranquillisers, digoxin, beta-blockers, other hypotensive drugs, and nonsteroid antiinflammatory drugs were the offending agents in 73% of these admissions. Drug induced illness makes an important contribution to the work-load of a general medical ward, and more care in the prescription of these classes of drugs might substantially reduce this contribution.", 
    "44": "Electrolytic lesions of the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) caused significant increases in basal plasma renin activity (+433%) and basal plasma norepinephrine concentration (+98%) in conscious rats. Plasma epinephrine concentration, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, hematocrit, plasma osmolality and plasma sodium and potassium concentrations were not significantly affected by the lesions. Atenolol reduced the elevated plasma renin activity in the lesion group to a value similar to that of a control group (sham lesions or lesions in areas adjacent to the PBN). Captopril significantly lowered mean arterial pressure in the lesion group, but it had no effect on arterial pressure in the control group. Lesions of the PBN also increased the baroreflex-mediated bradycardia evoked by an abrupt elevation of arterial pressure. We propose that the PBN tonically inhibits sympathetic activity, sympathetically mediated renin release and baroreflex sensitivity.", 
    "45": "Sertraline, a potent and selective inhibitor of serotonin uptake, was chronically administered to laboratory rats. Using in vitro receptor autoradiographic techniques, we found that the binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA) was reduced in cortex layers IV-VI. Results of a saturation experiment indicated that the reduction in cortex layer IV was due to a change in number but not affinity of beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "46": "Effort angina may be treated with nitrates, beta-blockers or calcium antagonists which are equally effective. The choice of the appropriate treatment sometimes depends on clinical data, on the contraindications indications specific to each therapeutic class or on side-effects. In most cases, beta-blockers should be preferred since their side-effects are rare provided their contra-indications are respected, they are easy to administer and above all, they exert a protective effect on the heart demonstrated after myocardial infection and highly probable in angina. The possible occurrence, during prolonged treatment, of unstable angina or myocardial infarction--both conditions in which beta-blockers alone or combined with other drugs have been shown to be effective--is in favour of this treatment. However, the frequent presence of a vasomotor factor in the different clinical forms of coronary disease justifies the use of vasodilators concurrently with beta-blockers, notably in patients with severe angina.", 
    "47": "In a six month placebo-controlled cross-over trial twenty patients with hypertension and peripheral arterial disease were randomised to captopril 25 mg twice daily, atenolol 100 mg once daily, labetalol 200 mg twice daily, or pindolol 10 mg twice daily for one month. Although all treatments were equally effective at lowering blood pressure, pain-free and maximum walking distances on a treadmill were decreased by atenolol, labetalol, and pindolol, but not by captopril. Post-exercise calf blood flow availability was impaired by atenolol, labetalol, and pindolol, but not by captopril. Despite ancillary characteristics of cardioselectivity, intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, or combination with alpha-blockade, beta-blockers seem to impair the lower limb circulation in such patients, whereas captopril seems to preserve it, possibly by maintaining the collateral blood supply.", 
    "48": "Most patients with high blood pressure (BP) can be managed by using one of 4 classes of compounds: a diuretic, beta blocker, converting enzyme inhibitor or calcium antagonist. It is becoming clear, however, that different patients respond to different drugs and that side effects also vary from 1 patient to another. In many patients in whom 1 drug is not sufficient to lower BP, the combination of a low dose of 2 drugs, particularly a diuretic combined with a beta blocker or a converting enzyme inhibitor, is an effective way of decreasing BP further. An understanding of the mechanisms whereby drugs lower BP and why they are additive with some drugs and not with others is clearly important in the more rational use of drugs. The finding that much lower doses of drugs can be used is also important; the combination of a low dose of 2 drugs may not only be more effective in lowering BP but also have less side effects than a higher dose of a single drug. In patients with more resistant hypertension that is not controlled by 1 or 2 drugs combined, the next logical step is to add a third drug. Before doing this, however, it is important to check that the patient is complying with treatment and to consider secondary causes. Ideally, such patients should be referred to someone with a special interest in high BP as they are more likely to have an underlying cause for their hypertension.", 
    "49": "Drug-induced reduction of elevated blood pressure decreases cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in patients with moderate and severe hypertension. Furthermore, antihypertensive drug studies in mild hypertensive subjects (diastolic blood pressure 90 to 104 mm Hg) have shown protection against stroke, left ventricular hypertrophy, congestive heart failure and progression of renal damage, as well as improved patient longevity. The Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program trial, recently carried out in the U.S., documented reduced coronary artery disease events (fatal and nonfatal) in special drug-treated patients with mild hypertension. From the standpoint of practical management and considering the ubiquity of essential hypertension, a modified stepped-care regimen advocating initial drug therapy with a beta blocker and addition of low-dose thiazide diuretic when necessary constitutes a judicious approach for widespread application. Although there are 8 orally active beta blockers currently approved in the U.S. for clinical use in systemic hypertension, only acebutolol possesses all of the salutary pharmacologic properties of cardioselectivity, intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and hydrophilicity, thereby making this compound an effective and safe beta-blocking agent for first-order management of a broad segment of the hypertensive population.", 
    "50": "Evidence from numerous clinical trials has indicated that beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity increase plasma triglycerides and decrease high density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients with hypertension or coronary artery disease. There appears to be little or no difference between the nonselective and cardioselective drugs in this regard. In contrast, beta blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and alpha 1 blockers appear not to have these effects. The changes induced by adrenoceptor-blocking agents in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism and their possible significance in relation to the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease are discussed.", 
    "51": "Diuretics and beta blockers are the mainstay in treating mild and moderate systemic hypertension, but there is controversy as to which should be used first. Recent evidence of an increase in sudden death and a greater number of intolerable side effects in the diuretic-treated groups in the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial in the U.S. and the Medical Research Council Trial in Great Britain has prompted some to suggest beta blockers as first-line therapy. However, beta blockers also have side effects, such as decreased ventricular function in patients with mild heart failure, increased airways resistance in those with chronic obstructive lung disease, increased plasma lipids, in particular low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and increased problems in patients with peripheral vascular disease and those with diabetes requiring insulin treatment. Many new beta-blocking drugs with different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties allow the physician to choose the best one for each patient. beta-blocking drugs with long durations of action, high levels of bioavailability, beta 1 selectivity and intrinsic sympathomimetic activity appear most suitable for therapy. Cardioselectivity is suggested for patients with obstructive lung disease and peripheral vascular disease, and diabetic patients who take insulin. Long durations of action permit infrequent administration and recently agents with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity have been shown to have less effects on plasma lipid levels. Acebutolol also reduces ventricular arrhythmias, and may therefore be used to reduce sudden death in patients with coronary artery disease. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of beta-blocking drugs can indicate the most appropriate choice for hypertensive patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "52": "Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of labetalol, a combined alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonist drug, were studied in elderly and young hypertensive patients. After receiving intravenous labetalol, elderly patients had a greater maximal mean decrease in systolic blood pressure (BP) (39 +/- 8 vs 25 +/- 13 mm Hg, p less than 0.02); however, maximal decrease in diastolic BP was similar in elderly (18 +/- 10 mm Hg) and young (17 +/- 6 mm Hg) patients. After receiving oral labetalol, elderly patients had a greater maximal decrease in standing systolic BP (41 +/- 16 vs 16 +/- 14 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) and similar decreases in standing diastolic BP (21 +/- 7 vs 17 +/- 9 mm Hg). Sitting maximal BP decreases after oral labetalol treatment were similar in elderly and young patients (12 +/- 16 vs 17 +/- 7 mm Hg systolic and 24 +/- 6 vs 12 +/- 7 diastolic). The decrease in heart rate was greater in young patients after intravenous labetalol administration. To evaluate labetalol pharmacodynamics, a linear model was used. Slope of labetalol concentration vs systolic BP for elderly vs young patients was 0.928 +/- 1.05 vs 0.326 +/- 0.490 ng/ml X mm Hg-1 (difference not significant). The slope of labetalol concentration vs heart rate for elderly vs young patients was 0.176 +/- 0.063 vs 0.406 +/- 0.303 ng/ml X beats/min-1 (p less than 0.05), with 2 elderly patients showing no decrease in heart rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

An intraventricular systolic gradient less than 50 mm Hg, high-quality echocardiograms and cineangiograms and high-fidelity pressure tracings were selection criteria. Hemodynamic and metabolic variables were assessed during basal conditions, after 5 minutes of isoproterenol infusion or at angina and ST-segment depression, and 5 and 10 minutes after intravenous propranolol infusion. Isoproterenol increased the intraventricular systolic gradient more significantly in group B than in group A (102.4 +/- 8.3 vs 52.2 +/- 8.2, p less than 0.0001). Group B also had higher left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (32.5 +/- 3.9 vs 20.2 +/- 5.7), lower mean arterial pressure (69.7 +/- 3.5 vs 84.7 +/- 4.8) and a smaller increase in coronary sinus flow (176.1 +/- 9.2 vs 261.5 +/- 33.9, all p less than 0.0001), concomitant with lactate release and ST-segment depression. Propranolol promptly reversed hemodynamic and metabolic changes caused by isoproterenol, except for a further coronary sinus flow increase (from 176.1 +/- 9.2 to 219 +/- 14.2 ml/min, p less than 0.001), and heart rate decrease below basal values (57.8 +/- 7.5 vs 79.9 +/- 9.8 beats/min, p less than 0.001) in group B.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "54": "Anatomical and pharmacological evidence suggests a role for catecholamines (CAs) in the modulation of the baroreceptor reflex within the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS). Single neurons in the NTS of the rat were studied for their responses to activation of the baroreceptor reflex and to iontophoretic administration of dopamine, norepinephrine (NE), and epinephrine (EPI) to determine the relationship between the effects of baroreflex activation and CA application on baroreceptive neurons in the vagal sensory nucleus. Of 269 cells studied, 104 (38.7%) exhibited decreases and 41 cells (15.2%) showed increases in firing rate in response to baroreflex activation, while the remaining 124 neurons showed no response. All 3 CAs inhibited spike activity in the majority (68.5%) of NTS cells. These inhibitory effects on spontaneous firing were observed regardless of the response profile of a particular neuron to baroreflex activation. The inhibitory effects of NE and EPI on NTS neuronal activity were specifically blocked by the alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist tolazoline, but not by the beta-adrenergic antagonist sotalol. These results indicate that CAs may interact at several sites within the NTS to influence baroreflex integration, and that the effects of NE and EPI on neuronal activity are mediated by an alpha-adrenergic receptor.", 
    "55": "Adrenergic-stimulated glycogenolysis (estimated as glucose output) was determined in hepatocytes from 7, 14, 20, and 24 mo old male Fischer 344 rats. Glucose output in response to the beta adrenergic agonist isoproterenol was minimal at 7 mo but increased progressively with increasing age. At all ages the isoproterenol response was concentration dependent and was inhibited by the beta adrenergic antagonist propranolol. Stimulation of glucose output by the mixed alpha-beta agonist epinephrine also increased between 7 and 24 mo. Glycogenolytic responses to alpha agonist (assessed in the presence of epinephrine and excess beta antagonist), glucagon, and forskolin did not increase substantially with age and at 24 mo were less than the response to beta agonist. In hepatocyte homogenates adenylate cyclase activation by beta agonist but not glucagon and forskolin increased between 7 and 24 mo. These results suggest that adrenergic stimulation of glycogenolysis, which in young adult male rats is generally attributed to alpha adrenergic-mediated processes, becomes mediated predominantly by beta adrenergic-responsive adenylate cyclase during post-maturational aging.", 
    "56": "Perfluoro-n-decanoic acid (PFDA) is a member of a family of surfactants with numerous industrial applications. The acute toxicity of PFDA is characterized by body wasting and delayed lethality. Recent reports have indicated that the effects of PFDA may involve an action on the structure of biological membranes which results in an alteration of function. In the present study we extend our work on the membrane actions of PFDA by examining its effects on myocardial beta-adrenoceptor binding characteristics and adenylate cyclase. Following a single injection of PFDA the apparent number of beta-receptor binding sites was reduced compared to pair-fed controls. This change in beta-receptor binding capacity was reflected in a reduced ability of norepinephrine to activate adenylate cyclase. No alterations were observed in basal adenylate cyclase activity or in the ability of NaF or guanylyl imidodiphosphate to stimulate the enzyme. The fatty acid composition of the heart was changed by PFDA treatment. Our results suggest that the toxic effects of PFDA may be due to an alteration of the membrane lipid bilayer leading to changes in the functional activity of myocardial membranes.", 
    "57": "114 haemodynamically stable patients with acute head injury were randomised, double-blind, to either placebo or atenolol given intravenously (10 mg every 6 h) for 3 days then orally (100 mg daily) for a further 4 days. Both groups were equally stressed as shown by raised arterial noradrenaline levels. In patients receiving placebo, but not in those receiving atenolol, there was a significant (p less than 0.01) positive correlation between arterial noradrenaline and levels of the myocardial isoenzyme of creatine kinase (CKMB). 30% of the placebo group compared with 7.4% of the atenolol group (p less than 0.05) showed CKMB levels greater than 3% of total creatine kinase (compatible with myocardial damage). CKMB levels greater than 6% of total creatine kinase (compatible with acute myocardial infarction) were present in 16.7% of patients receiving placebo but in no patients receiving atenolol (p = 0.053). Atenolol appeared to reduce significantly the likelihood of supraventricular tachycardia and ST-segment and T-wave changes and prevented cardiac necrosis seen at necropsy.", 
    "58": "L-652,469, 14-acetoxy-7 beta-(3'-ethylcrotonoyloxy)-notonipetranone, isolated from the methylene chloride extracts of the buds of Tussilago farfara L, was found to inhibit both platelet activating factor (PAF) and Ca2+ entry blocker binding to membrane vesicles. It inhibits the [3H]PAF specific binding to rabbit platelet membranes with equilibrium inhibition constants (Ki) of 3.2 and 4.0 microM in the presence of 150 mM NaCl and 10 mM MgCl2 respectively. It is a competitive PAF receptor antagonist with an equilibrium dissociation constant (KB) of 5.16 microM. It also competitively inhibits the specific binding of Ca2+ channel blockers (e.g. [3H]nitrendipine; Ki = 1.2 microM) in cardiac sarcolemmal vesicles. At 10(-5) M, L-652,469 causes a 60% relaxation of Ca2+-induced contraction of rat thoracic aorta strips. Due to its dual antagonistic activities, L-652,469 potently inhibits the gel-filtered rabbit platelet aggregation with a pA2 of 5.79. It was also found to be orally active with a beneficial effect to inhibit the PAF-induced rat foot edema and the first phase of carrageenan-induced rat hindpaw edema.", 
    "59": "Subacute administration (b.i.d. for 4 days) of sertraline, a potent and selective inhibitor of serotonin uptake, was found to reduce cyclic AMP generation by the norepinephrine receptor-coupled adenylate cyclase in rat limbic forebrain slices and decrease the number of beta-adrenoceptors in rat cerebral cortex without affecting the affinity of [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding. Co-administration of sertraline and the serotonin agonist, quipazine, at doses at which neither agent had an effect, resulted in desensitization of norepinephrine receptor-coupled adenylate cyclase and down-regulation of beta-adrenoceptors. These findings suggest that increased serotonergic activity may be involved in the induction of subsensitivity of the beta-adrenoceptor system of rat brain by sertraline.", 
    "60": "Electrophysiological studies using reserpinized cats were performed to examine the effects of L-threo-3,4-dihydroxyphenylserine (L-threo-DOPS) on the noradrenergic pathway from the locus coeruleus (LC) to the spinal trigeminal nucleus (STN). The spike generation of STN relay neurons induced by trigeminal nerve stimulation was not affected by LC conditioning stimulation nor iontophoretic application of L-threo-DOPS. After intraventricular administration of L-threo-DOPS, the inhibition of the spike generation was seen with LC conditioning stimulation and blocked by iontophoretically applied sotalol, suggesting that L-noradrenaline converted from L-threo-DOPS inhibits transmission of STN relay neurons.", 
    "61": "A 6-hydroxydopamine-induced lesion of the dorsal noradrenergic bundle (DNB) in rats markedly decreased neocortical noradrenaline concentration (NNC) by 72-100% as measured 1, 3 and 13 months after the lesioning procedure. The concomitant assessment of neocortical alpha 2- and beta 1-adrenoceptor binding (NAAB and NBAB, respectively) usually indicated significant increases of 25-72% for these two variables. There were, however, cases of unchanged NAAB and NBAB which presumably reflected an incomplete DNB lesion and a consequent time-related, partial recovery of NNC. The results emphasize the potential for long-term sequelae of the DNB lesion, and the existence of a critical NNC threshold (approximately 10-30% of control NNC values) which modulates postsynaptic alpha 2- and beta 1-adrenoceptor density.", 
    "62": "Secretion of corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) from the hypothalamic paraventricular nuclei into the hypophysial-portal circulation is modulated by a variety of neuronal afferents. Effects of intracerebroventricular acetylcholine (ACH), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and epinephrine (EPI) on immunoreactive (ir) CRF concentration in portal plasma were directly evaluated in urethanized male rats. ACH (0.1-10 nmole) administration was associated with a dose-dependent elevation of portal irCRF which was attenuated by pretreatment with either muscarinic or nicotinic receptor antagonists. GABA (0.1-10 nmole) also caused inhibition of irCRF concentration in the portal plasma which was prevented by bicuculline pretreatment. Finally, EPI (0.1-10 nmole) facilitated irCRF secretion via alpha 1- and beta-adrenergic mechanisms. These observations provide the first direct information on possible neurotransmitter actions on hypothalamic CRF secretion.", 
    "63": "The effects of collagenase on the membrane response to catecholamines were studied with intracellular microelectrodes in the guinea-pig taenia caeci and main pulmonary artery. In the taenia, the inhibitory actions of adrenaline mediated through alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors were both nearly abolished by two 5-min treatments with 0.005% collagenase. In the pulmonary artery, the depolarizing action of noradrenaline mediated through beta-adrenoceptors was markedly reduced by three 5-min treatments with 0.01% collagenase.", 
    "64": "An epidemiologic study of a representative sample of a population of 40- to 59-year-old males assessed the effect of one year of rationed walking, as a nonmedicated method of secondary prevention of moderately persistent arterial hypertension, on arterial blood pressure, its response to stress, and physical working capacity; the utility of training regimens after a course of medication to control arterial blood pressure is demonstrated.", 
    "65": "A death due to an intentional overdose of metoprolol is described. The drug was quantified by gas chromatography, and identification was confirmed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Metoprolol concentrations in blood, bile, urine, and vitreous humor were 19.8 mg/L, 83.1 mg/L, 1.6 mg/L, and 15.1 mg/L, respectively. A blood ethanol concentration of 0.25 g/100 mL was the only other significant toxicologic finding.", 
    "66": "The effect of acute renal disease on the serum free fraction of phenytoin, diazepam and propranolol was examined in vitro among 37 patients with acute renal insufficiency of varying etiology and 10 healthy control subjects, men and women equally. The free fractions were separated at 37 degrees C using a pressure ultrafiltration method. The free fraction of phenytoin varied from about 14% to 45% and that of diazepam from 2% to 10%. The free fraction did not correlate significantly with either the serum urea or creatinine concentrations or the creatinine clearance within the acutely uremic group. The free fractions of propranolol varied considerably in the uremic patients but did not correlate significantly with the above parameters either. The mean free fractions of propranolol in the acutely uremics (11.9 +/- 1.0%, mean +/- SE) and controls (8.9 +/- 0.5%) did not differ significantly. The free fractions of both phenytoin and diazepam had a significant inverse correlation with the serum albumin level and that of propranolol with the alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (alpha, AGP) level. The correlations were similar irrespective of the etiology of renal failure. In practice, the variable best predicting the phenytoin and diazepam free fractions in acute renal insufficiency is the serum albumin concentration, and for propranolol the serum alpha 1-AGP concentration.", 
    "67": "Phorbol ester (PMA) exerted a dose- and time- dependent stimulating effect on phagocytosis in axenic Paramecium aurelia. When cells were exposed to 200-800 nM PMA in the presence of latex beads, the phagocytic coefficient was enhanced 2.25 to 3.14 times, during 10 min of continuous treatment and then rapidly declined. A similar effect was observed when the cells were exposed to a forskolin treatment, which resulted in nearly a twofold increase in phagocytic activity after a 10 min pulse. Both PMA and forskolin strongly stimulated phagocytosis (i.e. fivefold and threefold, respectively) in cells in which such activity had been completely inhibited by pre-exposure to the beta-receptor antagonist 1-propranolol.", 
    "68": "To learn the nature of the autonomic control of the serous lingual salivary glands of von Ebner, parasympathetic and sympathetic agonists were injected into rats, and the extent of depletion of the secretory granules in gland acini was measured. Injection of the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol caused a concentration-dependent reduction of the secretory granule content of the acinar cells. Injection of the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, combined with isoproterenol, blocked the reduction in secretory granule content seen with isoproterenol alone. Injection of the parasympathetic agonist carbachol also produced a concentration-dependent reduction in granule content of the acini. This reduction was partially blocked by injection of atropine, and completely blocked by injection of atropine and propranolol. beta-Adrenergic and parasympathetic agonists alone did not cause total degranulation of the acini. However, this was achieved by injection of both agonists. It is concluded that protein secretion in von Ebner's glands is under both sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous control. It is hypothesized that the glands contain two sets of granules with different compositions, each under the control of either the parasympathetic or sympathetic nervous system. Because von Ebner's glands are closely associated with taste buds and because the glands supply the microenvironment of these taste buds the secretion of these glands may be very important in the mechanism of taste transduction.", 
    "69": "We describe the dermatological consequences of treatment with a beta-adrenergic antagonist, atenolol, in a patient with pheochromocytoma. There were acral skin lesions, histologically characterized by epidermal and sweat-gland necrosis. It is believed that the combined action of severe local ischaemia and profuse sweating produced these lesions, which resembled histologically the changes found in patients comatose as the result of carbon monoxide or drug poisoning. The importance of such lesions in diagnosis is discussed.", 
    "70": "The localization of high-affinity uptake sites for 3H gamma-aminobutyric acid (3H-GABA) was investigated in the rat duodenum during ontogenesis and also at the adult stage (from 15.5 days of fetal life up to 105 days post natum) by means of low- and high-resolution autoradiography. At all stages studied, specific endocrine cell types of the epithelium were labelled and an intense uptake was detected in the nervous tissue, especially in glial cells but also in scarce neurones. When the incubation medium was supplemented with beta-alanine (1 mM), a blocker of the glial uptake for GABA, the labelling persisted only in endocrine cells and in few neurones. The intensity and the frequency of the labelling decreased at later periods compared to the earlier developmental stages. The GABA content of the duodenum as measured by a new ion-exchange column chromatography-HPLC-coupled method was higher in the early postnatal period compared to later stages. These observations suggest that GABA, in addition to being a neurotransmitter, may play an important role during development of the duodenum.", 
    "71": "1 The characteristics of vanadate-induced bronchoconstriction and airways hyperreactivity were observed in spontaneously breathing anaesthetized guinea-pigs by measurement of airways resistance (Raw) and dynamic lung compliance (Cdyn). Vanadate (0.3-3 mg kg-1 i.v. over 25 min) increased Raw and decreased Cdyn in a reversible, dose-related manner. This action (1 mg kg-1 vanadate) was not inhibited by atropine (1 mg kg-1 i.v.), propranolol (1 mg kg-1 i.v.) or bilateral vagotomy, suggesting a direct effect on the airways smooth muscle. 2 An aerosol of vanadate (10% w/v in H2O) for 3 min decreased Cdyn by 19.5% (P less than 0.05, n = 6) but caused no change in Raw. 3 Histamine (3 micrograms kg-1 i.v.) caused a bronchoconstriction which was enhanced by vanadate in a dose-related manner. This hyperreactivity (after 1 mg kg-1 i.v. vanadate) was unchanged after propranolol or bilateral vagotomy, but was partly blocked by atropine (enhancement by vanadate of the Cdyn change to histamine was diminished, P less than 0.02, n = 3). 4 Bronchoconstrictor responses to acetylcholine (6 micrograms kg-1 i.v.) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (6 micrograms kg-1 i.v.) were also enhanced by vanadate (1 mg kg-1 i.v.) Hyperreactivity after vanadate to the three bronchoconstrictors tested continued during vanadate infusion and was reversed 45 min after cessation of infusion. 5 Histamine (3 ;Lgkg-' i.v.) caused a transient tachypnoea which was also enhanced by vanadate (0.3-3mgkg-'i.v.), in a dose-related manner, in association with the increased reactivity of the airways (r = 0.66, n = 11). 6 It is concluded that vanadate-induced airways hyperreactivity is non-vagal (efferent) and largely non-cholinergic in origin and appears to involve an action of vanadate within the lung itself.", 
    "72": "We compared the effects of oral nadolol 20 mg once daily and topical timolol 0.25% twice daily on the intraocular pressures of 22 glaucoma suspects, in a 12 week double-masked crossover study. Both nadolol and timolol reduced intraocular pressure (p less than 0.001). The reductions in intraocular pressure did not differ significantly after two weeks and four weeks of treatment. Nine of these subjects underwent treadmill exercise tests in order to compare the effects of nadolol and timolol on the cardiovascular system. The effects of the two treatments on blood pressure were comparable, but nadolol caused a significantly greater reduction in heart rate than timolol at rest (p less than 0.05). Nadolol reduces intraocular pressure effectively and may prove a useful alternative treatment for chronic simple glaucoma.", 
    "73": "In reports on ophthalmological research the results of measurements on the eye are often expressed as mean and standard deviation based on m patients, n eyes (n greater than m). This approach leads to t tests that are invalid because the measurements on the two eyes of one subject are usually related, not independent. In a simulation study involving intraocular pressure data analysed in this way, the null hypothesis of no difference between groups was rejected at a nominal alpha = 0.05 level in 39 out of 200 simulations; thus the true alpha was nearly 0.2. This approach is excessively prone to produce false positive results.", 
    "74": "Eight Sudanese patients with hepatosplenic schistosomiasis and seven Sudanese controls were administered a single oral dose of long acting (LA), propranolol 160 mg; blood propranolol levels were measured at regular intervals for 12 h using g.l.c. In patients with hepatosplenic schistosomiasis, propranolol blood concentrations were greater (P less than 0.05) at all time intervals, Cmax 63.5 (29-143) ng ml-1 (median and range) than controls Cmax 23 (12-37) ng ml-1. Median AUC0-12 was also greater (P less than 0.05) (533 and 218 ng ml-1 h respectively), tmax were not significantly different. In patients and controls prior to treatment, standing heart rate (77.5 (60-110), 72 (68-74) beats min-1) systolic (120 (105-150), 110 (100-120) mm Hg) and diastolic blood pressure (75 (60-90), 70 (60-80) mm Hg) were not significantly different. However following propranolol administration a reduction (P less than 0.05) occurred in both systolic (median 20 mm Hg) and diastolic (median 12.5 mm Hg) blood pressure in the patients compared with controls. Heart rate was reduced by a median of 10 beats min-1 in both groups. These observations indicate that propranolol bioavailability in patients with hepatosplenic schistosomiasis is increased possibly due to reduced presystemic extraction.", 
    "75": "1 Study I evaluated the absorption of oxprenolol in the ileum, compared to jejunum, in healthy volunteers by an intestinal perfusion technique. Around 80 mg of drug were delivered as a saline solution directly in the small bowel. 2 Samples taken 30 cm distally to the site of perfusion showed that 63% of perfused oxprenolol was absorbed in the jejunum and 48% in the ileum; the differences were significant. 3 The plasma concentration-time profiles were similar for the two perfusions. The AUC and Cmax values of free and conjugated oxprenolol for the jejunal perfusion were significantly lower than those of ileum. They showed large but consistent intersubject variations in the two treatments. 4 Study II investigated, using the same technique, the influence of nutrients and digestive secretions on jejunal absorption and systemic availability of this drug. A saline (in treatments A and B) or a nutrient (in treatment C) solution containing oxprenolol was perfused into the jejunum below a balloon either inflated (A) or deflated (B and C). 5 The disappearance rate of oxprenolol from the jejunum was unaffected by endogenous secretions. The mean amount of drug absorbed along a 30-cm jejunal segment accounted for 52 (A) and 57% (B) of the total amount perfused. The intestinal absorption rate was markedly increased in the presence of nutrients (mean amount absorbed 96% for C). 6 The change in the rate of disappearance from the intestine had no effect on the systemic availability of oxprenolol (mean AUC values 8740, 8250 and 8020 nmol l-1 h for A, B and C, respectively) or its elimination from plasma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "76": "1. The trans-membrane migration ratio (TMMR) technique is a simple method for quantitating and comparing the effect of drugs on sperm motility. 2. The ultrafilter membrane (Nucleopore) used allows mixing between the solutions on either side resulting in 21-fold dilution of a drug initially mixed with semen. 3. The concentration of drug originally mixed with semen does not remain constant over the incubation time. 4. The phosphate buffer saline (PBS) in the lower chamber should be replaced by PBS containing the same concentration of drug as in the upper chamber so that a homogenous system is established throughout the incubation. 5. Reports of previous studies using this technique may have underestimated the effect of drugs on sperm motility.", 
    "77": "The effects of propranolol on whole body oxygen consumption and blood oxygen content were measured in the dog during extreme hypoxic conditions. At 9% inspired oxygen four of eight control animals died within 40 min. An identical second group was pretreated with propranolol and none died during the same hypoxic stress. Hypoxia decreased oxygen consumption in both groups, but the decrease was less in the propranolol-pretreated dogs. A second set of 16 dogs was ventilated with 10% oxygen and all animals survived. A similar, although less pronounced, effect on oxygen consumption was noted and propranolol once again lessened the hypoxia-induced decrease in oxygen consumption. With hypoxaemia, metabolic acidosis developed in all animals and the arterio-venous oxygen content difference decreased; however, propranolol lessened the acidosis and the decrease in arterio-venous oxygen content difference. We conclude that, during hypoxia, propranolol increases oxygen utilization by the tissues and this might account for better survival.", 
    "78": "Propranolol reduces left atrial pressure at rest and during exercise in patients with mitral stenosis by lowering cardiac output and heart rate. Ten patients (aged 19-56) with moderate to severe isolated mitral stenosis were studied to determine whether propranolol increased their exercise tolerance. All were in sinus rhythm and free of left or right ventricular failure. Patients were trained in an individually graded bicycle or treadmill exercise protocol that provoked a reproducible degree of near maximal dyspnoea during the second three minute stage of exercise. Propranolol (80 mg or 120 mg) or matching placebo in two or three divided daily doses was given for one week in random double blind fashion. Exercise testing and questioning about subjective clinical response were carried out at the end of each week by an investigator who was unaware of the patient's heart rate. During propranolol treatment the heart rate was 19 beats/minute slower at rest and 38 beats/minute slower at peak exercise, but there was no change in mean exercise time to dyspnoea (274 s during propranolol vs 283 s during placebo). Four patients felt worse during the propranolol week, one patient felt better during the propranolol week, and five patients felt no difference between the two weeks. Propranolol did not improve objective or subjective exercise tolerance in patients with isolated mitral stenosis in sinus rhythm.", 
    "79": "Effect of diltiazem on subcellular distribution of lysosomal enzymes, high-energy phosphate metabolism and mechanical function in the ischemic heart was studied. Ischemia was induced by lowering the afterload pressure of the perfused working rat heart. The activities of cathepsin D, beta,N-acetylglucosaminidase and acid phosphatase were determined in the nonsedimentable and sedimentable fractions after centrifugation of the tissue extract to assess the subcellular distribution of lysosomal enzymes. After ischemia, decreases in the mechanical function and the tissue level of high-energy phosphates were observed. In addition, ischemia caused subcellular redistribution of lysosomal enzymes from the lysosomes to the cytoplasm. Reperfusion of the ischemic heart did not restore the mechanical function and the level of high-energy phosphates completely. Diltiazem (2.21 X 10(-6), 1.11 X 10(-5) and 2.21 X 10(-5) M) was provided for the heart 5 min before the onset of ischemia. Diltiazem preserved high-energy phosphates in the ischemic heart, and inhibited the subcellular redistribution of lysosomal enzymes being caused by ischemia, depending on its concentration. Reperfusion after ischemia with diltiazem recovered the mechanical function that had been decreased by ischemia. These results may indicate that diltiazem can protect the myocardium against ischemic damage.", 
    "80": "We began open trials of beta-blockers, as adjunctive medication, in eight consecutive autistic adults. The immediate result across all patients was a rapid diminution in aggressivity (Ratey et al., 1987). As time on the drug increased, subtler changes in speech and socialization emerged. While results of open trials must be interpreted with caution, these changes were significant and lasting. We speculate that these effects may be the result of a lessening of the autistic individual's state of hyperarousal. As the individual becomes less anxious, defensive and dearousing behaviors are relinquished and more social and adaptive behaviors appear. There is a concomitant improvement in language, though it is unclear whether lost skills are recouped or new ones developed. Further research is indicated.", 
    "81": "The DNA damaging capacity of the sex-dependent hepatocarcinogen beta-blocker DL-1-(2-nitro-3-methyl-phenoxy)-3-tert-butylamino-propan-2-ol (DL-ZAMI 1305) was evaluated in different sex hormonal conditions. A single injection of DL-ZAMI 1305 causes DNA damage in the liver of the female but not the male Wistar rat. When the hormonal environment of the female rat is converted to 'male type' by ovariectomy and 1 week of treatment with testosterone, DNA damage by DL-ZAMI 1305 is completely abolished. On the contrary, in male rats orchiectomy coupled to 17 beta-estradiol administration increases the amount of hepatic DNA damage by DL-ZAMI 1305 to values similar to those observed in intact female rats. DL-ZAMI 1305 induces hepatic DNA damage also when administered to female Sprague-Dawley and Fisher 344 female rats. It is uneffective instead on the male rats of these strains. Moreover, in the female Fisher 344 rat phenobarbital pretreatment reduces the DNA damaging capacity of DL-ZAMI 1305. Our data indicate that the genotoxic activity of DL-ZAMI 1305 depends on the sex-hormonal status of the animal and that this is possibly due to a modulation of the microsomal mixed function oxidase system by sex hormones.", 
    "82": "This study investigates effects of beta-adrenergic blockade on total silent ischemic time assessed by ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring and its relation to heart rate and time of day in ambulatory men with coronary artery disease. Metoprolol, when titrated to optimal dose in a controlled trial in 9 patients, reduced both total silent ischemic time (from 156 +/- 65 to 20 +/- 15 minutes, p = 0.04) and frequency of silent ischemic episodes (from 8 +/- 2 to 2 +/- 2 episodes, p = 0.03) compared with placebo. Mean daily heart rate was reduced, from 82 +/- 2 beats/min during placebo to 58 +/- 1 beats/min, as was heart rate at onset of 1 mm of ST-segment depression (106 +/- 2 to 74 +/- 4 beats/min, both p less than 0.001). Heart rate increased 10 +/- 1 beats/min during silent ischemia with placebo therapy, but increased only 4 +/- 1 beats/min during metoprolol treatment (p less than 0.03). During placebo administration the largest proportion of silent ischemic time occurred between 0600 and 1200 hours. Metoprolol attenuated this circadian variation in silent ischemia while reducing (p less than 0.05) total silent ischemic time in all periods. Thus, beta-adrenergic blockade reduces the frequency of silent myocardial ischemic episodes and total silent ischemic time, while mean daily heart rate and heart rate at onset of ischemia and maximal ischemia decrease. Metoprolol treatment also attenuates circadian variation of silent ischemia. These data may be interpreted to suggest that beta-adrenergic activation operates in the pathogenesis of silent myocardial ischemia and its circadian variation.", 
    "83": "Effects of intravenous injection of 0.6 mg/kg sotalol, a beta-blocking agent with additional class III properties, were studied by means of electrophysiologic techniques in 14 patients, seven with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and seven with concealed atrioventricular (AV) accessory pathways. Sotalol brought about a significant increase in the retrograde effective refractory period of the anomalous pathway, whereas changes in the antegrade effective refractory period were more variable. In five of nine patients with electrically induced reciprocating tachycardia sotalol prevented the initiation of sustained reentry. In most cases the suppression of the circus movement was the result of the development of AV nodal block. Thus our data support the use of sotalol for the treatment of tachycardias incorporating anomalous AV conduction pathways."
