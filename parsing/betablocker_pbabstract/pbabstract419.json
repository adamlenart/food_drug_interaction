This study revealed a group of patients which reacted to 25 mg of captopril with a significant increase of plasma renin activity, but angiography excluded a renal artery stenosis. These patients had significantly more hypertensive organ damage than a control-group, including a significant microalbuminuria. Consequently, we infused a subpressure dose of angiotensin II to investigate its impact on albuminuria in these patients. Although angiotensin II induced hyperfiltration, microalbuminuria was not increased. Because this finding could have therapeutic relevance, we investigated the significance of different antihypertensive drugs (beta-blocker, alpha-blocker, Calcium antagonists, ACE-inhibitor) on microalbuminuria in patients with arterial hypertension. Renal hemodynamics were influenced as expected, but blood-pressure and microalbuminuria were reduced to the same extent by all antihypertensives. In contrast to these results, we could demonstrate significantly different influences of a beta-blocker and an ACE-inhibitor on proteinuria in patients with primary glomerulonephritis. These results suggest different effects of antihypertensive drugs on renal protein excretion depending on the actual disease.", 
    "1": "The variety of pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic approaches to facilitate benzodiazepine discontinuation are reviewed. Strategies to attenuate physiologic withdrawal with clonidine, propranolol and carbamazepine have been inconsistently effective. Strategies to prevent relapse by substituting medications that could later be discontinued more easily (i.e., antidepressants and azapirones) appear more useful but have been less well studied. Psychotherapeutic approaches appear to work, but specific therapeutic components are unclear and non-specific \"placebo\" effects may play an important role.", 
    "2": "Topically administered beta blockers are the preferred medical therapy for glaucoma. These agents reduce intraocular pressure (IOP), thereby preventing damage to the optic nerve and the subsequent loss of vision. Timolol, betaxolol, levobunolol, metipranolol, and carteolol are the topical beta blockers available in the U.S. They have similar IOP-lowering efficacy, but differ in other pharmacological properties. Topically administered beta blockers are generally well tolerated. They undergo systemic absorption, however, and can adversely affect cardiovascular and bronchopulmonary function in patients with existing diseases such as heart failure, sinus bradycardia, chronic obstructive airways disease, or asthma. Betaxolol, which is beta 1-selective, and carteolol, which has intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), may have systemic tolerability profiles superior to the traditional nonselective, non-ISA beta blockers. These hypotheses require confirmation in controlled clinical trials. Local adverse effects associated with beta blockers include stinging, burning, red eye, itching, tearing and loss of corneal sensitivity. Stinging upon instillation is a particularly frequent finding with betaxolol (up to 30% to 40% of patients). Preliminary evidence suggests that carteolol has the best local tolerability profile of these drugs.", 
    "3": "The aim of this study was to determine the relative roles of alpha 1-and alpha 2-adrenoceptors at the level of large epicardial and small resistance coronary arteries when sympathetic tone is increased by exercise in conscious dogs. The responses of left circumflex coronary artery diameter and blood flow were investigated at rest and during graded treadmill exercise (5, 10 and 12 km/h) in six chronically instrumented dogs during control conditions (saline) and after administration of propranolol (1 mg/kg) either alone or in combination with either prazosin (50 micrograms/kg), or idazoxan (300 micrograms/kg), or the association of prazosin+idazoxan (same doses). In control conditions, graded treadmill exercise resulted in a progressive increase in coronary artery diameter (+3.8 +/- 0.6% from 3479 +/- 80 microns) and in a decrease in coronary vascular resistance (-46.0 +/- 4.5% from 8.49 +/- 1.51 mmHg/cm/s). Propranolol significantly constricted large (-4.4 +/- 0.6% from 3486 +/- 87 microns) and limited dilation of small coronary arteries during exercise. These coronary effects of propranolol remained unchanged following additional alpha 2-adrenoceptor blockade by idazoxan but were abolished following alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade by prazosin, given either alone or combined with idazoxan. Thus, alpha 1- but not alpha 2-adrenoceptors are responsible for propranolol-induced constriction of large coronary arteries and limitation of small coronary arteries dilation during exercise in conscious dogs.", 
    "4": "We investigated the mechanism of vascular relaxation produced by denopamine (deno), an oral positive inotropic agent that has selective beta 1-adrenergic action. Deno concentration-dependently (0.1 microM-30 microM) relaxed ring segments of canine femoral, mesenteric, and renal arteries which were partially precontracted with 1 micron phenylephrine or norepinephrine, but did not relax those precontracted with 5 microM prostaglandin F2 alpha or 40 mM K+. The relaxation was not significantly inhibited by pretreatment with 10 microM propranolol or metoprolol. Deno produced a parallel rightward shift in concentration-response curves to phenylephrine in femoral and renal arteries. The Schild plot yielded linear regressions of slopes of 1.301 +/- 0.106 and 0.823 +/- 0.122, respectively, which were not significantly different from unity. The pA2 values of Deno against phenylephrine in femoral and renal arteries were 5.41 +/- 0.03 and 5.76 +/- 0.06, respectively. On the other hand, Deno concentration-dependently (10 nM-10 microM) relaxed ring segments of canine coronary arteries which were partially precontracted with 5 microM prostaglandin F2 alpha. The relaxation was significantly inhibited by pretreatment with 10 microM metoprolol. In conclusion, vascular smooth muscle relaxation by Deno was mediated through beta 1-adrenergic action in canine coronary arteries and through the blocking effect of alpha-adrenoceptors in canine femoral, mesenteric, and renal arteries.", 
    "5": "Patients receiving beta-receptor antagonists for the treatment of hypertension frequently complain of impaired exercise tolerance. To determine whether these medications impair skeletal muscle contractile function, we measured isokinetic muscle function in ten healthy male cyclists receiving nebivolol (N), atenolol (A), propranolol (P) and the calcium channel antagonist diltiazem (D). The subjects performed standardized tests of muscle power on an isokinetic cycle ergometer following subacute ingestion of N, A, P, D and placebo (PL) in a double blind crossover trial. Subjects exercised maximally for 10 s at 90, 110, 120, 130 and 150 rpm with 2-min rest between sessions. Thereafter, they performed a 30-s fatigue test at 120 rpm. Resting heart rate was decreased 13.4%, 21.9% and 14.6% by N, A and P, respectively (P < 0.05 vs PL). Resting systolic blood pressure was decreased 6.7% by A only (P < 0.05 vs PL). Peak power, average power and work done was not different among treatment groups at any crank velocity, nor was there any difference in total work done or rate of work decline in the 30-s test. We concluded from our study that peak isokinetic muscle power during maximal exercise of short duration is not affected by beta-blockade or the calcium antagonist diltiazem. Fatigue during beta-receptor antagonism would not appear therefore to be due to changes in the ability of skeletal muscle to produce peak power output during exercise of short duration.", 
    "6": "Dopexamine hydrochloride is a synthetic dopamine analogue recently developed to improve myocardial and renal performance in patients suffering from low cardiac output states. The present study was designed to assess the pharmacological profile and the anatomical localization of [3H]-dopexamine binding sites within the human nephron. The effects of dopexamine on the 3'-5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-generating system in membrane particles of the human kidney were also investigated. It was found that [3H]-dopexamine was specifically bound by sections of the human kidney. The binding was partly inhibited by the DA-1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390, by the beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118,551 and by the DA-2 receptor antagonist domperidone. The 3 antagonists in combination reduced [3H]-dopexamine binding to nonspecific values. Light microscope autoradiography revealed the accumulation of silver grains, corresponding to [3H]-dopexamine binding sites, within the different portions of the human nephron. The incubation of sections of the human kidney with [3H]-dopexamine plus SCH 23390 caused a remarkable reduction in the density of silver grains within the proximal tubule and the macula densa and a moderate decrease in the density of silver grains within the ascending and descending limbs of the loop of Henle as well as within the distal tubule. The incubation of sections of human kidney with [3H]-dopexamine plus ICI 118,551 caused a pronounced reduction in the density of silver grains within the glomerulus, the limbs of the loop of Henle, the distal tubule and the medullary collecting tubules and a moderate decrease in the density of silver grains within the macula densa and the proximal collecting tubule.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "7": "It is well documented that in the treatment of mild or moderate hypertension selective alpha 1-inhibitors such as doxazosin and prazosin lower blood pressure to approximately the same extent as beta-blockers, diuretics, ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists. However, treatment with selective alpha 1-inhibitors is also associated with a number of other favourable effects. For example, in contrast to most beta-blockers, selective alpha 1-inhibitors have a favourable effect on serum lipids, primarily lowering the triglycerides but also increasing the ratio of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol:total cholesterol. In addition, selective alpha 1-inhibitors do not aggravate glucose metabolism or increase uric acid concentration, as thiazide diuretics frequently do. Some patients gain particular benefit from treatment with a selective alpha 1-inhibitor, namely those with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and kidney failure. While no controlled mortality trials with selective alpha 1-inhibitors have yet been completed, new vasodilator drugs such as these do lower blood pressure in a more physiological manner than traditional antihypertensive agents, and appear to cause fewer side effects. In this respect, with the exception of patients with manifest or strongly suspected coronary heart disease who are not receiving beta-blocker treatment, selective alpha 1-inhibitors should be recommended as first-line agents for the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "8": "The renal vasodilatating properties of tertatolol demonstrated in animals have been confirmed in man. In a first study [Paillard et al., 1986], tertatolol (T) 5 mg and propranolol (Pr) 160 mg (SR) were given orally for 15 days to 2 groups of 9 patients with essential hypertension. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), measured by inulin clearance and renal plasma flow (RPF) measured by PAH clearance increased in T group (+8.9%, p = 0.038 and + 13.0%, p = 0.007, respectively) and decreased in Pr group (-2.8%, NS and -13.4%, p < 0.001, respectively). Two clinical pharmacology studies [Leeman et al., 1986; Nitenberg et al., 1990] have shown specific and selective effects of tertatolol on the renal vasculature. In 8 hypertensive patients with chronic renal failure, the effects of tertatolol 5 mg were evaluated before and after 3 months of treatment on GFR using inulin clearance, and RPF, using PAH clearance [Hannedouche et al., 1991]. After 3 months of treatment, GFR and effective RPF increased significantly by 10 and 13%, respectively, whereas RVR decreased by 16% and the filtration fraction was unchanged. In summary, tertatolol 5 mg, contrasting with other beta-blockers, possesses a selective effect on the renal circulation beneficial to hypertensive patients. The mechanisms of this renal vasodilatation are not fully understood but might involve renal 5-HT1A receptor stimulation.", 
    "9": "The influence of a 3-month antihypertensive treatment on cardiac structure and renal function was assessed in patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension randomly allocated to treatment by the nonselective beta-blocker tertatolol or the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril. Both tertatolol and enalapril treatments were associated with a similar decrease in mean arterial pressure (-26 +/- 6 and -15 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively, both p < 0.05 in comparison with baseline values) and left ventricular mass (echocardiography: -48 +/- 17 vs. -18 +/- 6 g) but no change in glomerular filtration rate (DTPA clearance). Renal vascular resistance decreased similarly in both groups. Urinary albumin excretion was not significantly modified in either group. These results indicate that a consistent reduction in arterial pressure by either treatment was associated with a proportional change in left ventricular geometry and no alteration in renal function.", 
    "10": "Tertatolol is a beta-blocker with unique renal vasodilatatory effects, mainly at the level of the microcirculation. Since many vasodilatory agents inhibit human mesangial cell (HMC) proliferation, the effects of tertatolol on the incorporation of 3H-thymidine in HMC were studied. Tertatolol plus mitogens (either fetal calf serum, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) or bovine thrombin) were incubated with HMC for 28 h, and 3H-thymidine was added during the last 4 h. Trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts per well were divided by the mean number of cells in representative wells from the same experiment. The effect of tertatolol on angiotensin II (10(-6) mmol/l)-induced HMC contraction was also assessed by measuring the planar surface area of individual cells. In serum-free media, tertatolol did not significantly alter the incorporation of 3H-thymidine after 28 h of incubation in HMC. When tertatolol was added in the presence of 1% serum, 3H-thymidine incorporation was significantly reduced, compared to 1% serum alone. Tertatolol also inhibited 3H incorporation when PDGF and thrombin were used as the stimulus. The increase in cell number normally seen after 7 days in serum was also reduced by tertatolol. Tertatolol inhibited the reduction in planar surface area of HMC induced by angiotensin II. The inhibitory effect of tertatolol on HMC proliferation was also potentiated by ritanserin and MDL 72222, 5HT2 and 5HT3 antagonists, respectively. Conversely, the 5HT1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT did not modify the 3H-thymidine incorporation in HMC in the presence of tertatolol. In conclusion, tertatolol inhibits HMC proliferation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "11": "The aim of the studies was to examine the mechanism of the renal vasodilator action of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist tertatolol. In isolated Tyrode perfused rat kidneys, constricted with norepinephrine, serotonin (5-HT) or BaCl2, tertatolol evokes dilatations; these vasodilator responses are not due to an interaction of tertatolol with alpha- or beta-adrenoceptors, muscarinic or nicotinic receptors, opioid receptors, dopamine or histamine receptors and they are independent of prostaglandin release. In the presence of ritanserin and ICS 205930, to block 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors, tertatolol, 5-HT, 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT) and 8-hydroxy-2 (di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) all evoked renal vasodilator responses that were significantly reduced by the nonselective 5-HT antagonist metergoline and by the selective 5-HT1A antagonist BMY 7378 suggesting that 5-HT1 receptors resembling the 5-HT1A subtype were involved. The nitric oxide (NO) inhibitors hemoglobin and nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA), as well as the guanylate cyclase inhibitor methylene blue also inhibited the vasodilator responses to tertatolol and to the serotonergic agonists, suggesting the involvement of the NO-cyclic GMP pathway. These data suggest that 5-HT receptors located on the vascular endothelium of the rat renal circulation are involved in the vasodilator responses caused by tertatolol and these receptors resemble the 5-HT1A subtype.", 
    "12": "Tertalolol is a noncardioselective beta-blocker, devoid of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Its renal vasodilating properties have been demonstrated both in animals and in man. The beta-blocking activity of tertatolol was assessed on the reduction of heart rate at submaximal exercise. The oral dose of 5 mg was optimal, leading to a significant reduction of diastolic blood pressure throughout 24 h. The efficacy was confirmed in mid- and long-term studies. In mid-term, randomized controlled studies, versus beta-blockers, the antihypertensive efficacy of tertatolol 5 mg was comparable to that of acebutolol 400 mg but of earlier onset, and comparable to that of atenolol 100 mg. Its efficacy was confirmed in 3 long-term studies. In the first study, tertatolol 5 mg alone or combined with a diuretic and, if necessary, dihydralazine, controlled 93.6% of patients (supine DBP < 90 mm Hg). 72.7% of patients were controlled with tertatolol alone, 16.4% with tertatolol plus diuretic, and 4.5% with tertatolol plus diuretic and dihydralazine. In a second study, 88.5% of patients were controlled, 56.3% with tertatolol alone and 32.2% with tertatolol plus diuretic. In the third study, 88.8% of patients were controlled after 1 year treatment, 66.1% with tertatolol alone and 22.7% with tertatolol plus diuretic. The overall clinical safety was excellent: only 6.6% of the 2,706 patients treated for 1 year withdrew from the study because of side effects. In patients followed for 1 year, side effects were rare, transient and mostly of mild severity. Biochemical surveillance did not show any adverse metabolic effects of tertatolol. Conversely, in two long-term studies, creatinine and cholesterol levels decreased significantly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "13": "Tertatolol is a noncardioselective beta-blocker without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. In a preliminary 3-month open study, it was shown that T was devoid of any atherogenic effect since HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) and apoprotein levels did not change for 3 months of therapy. To investigate the long-term effects of tertatolol on the lipid profile and its safety in hypertensive patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD), a 9-month, randomized, double-blind, parallel group study was carried out in 40 patients. Tertatolol 5 mg once daily was compared with metoprolol 200 mg once daily. If BP was not controlled after 2 months, a vasodilatator agent, dihydralazine, was added at the lowest dose required to control BP (diastolic BP < 90 mm Hg). Lipoprotein fractions and apoproteins were assayed before (M0) and after 2, 6 and 9 months of therapy. At the same occasions, peripheral arterial disease (PAD) was evaluated on exercise tests carried out on a treadmill and on the regional blood flow measured in the ankle arteries by the Doppler technique. Four patients were not eligible for analysis. In the tertatolol group, 1 patient with a normal BP, and 2 patients who dropped out, 1 because of persistent nausea and 1 because of personal reasons. In the metoprolol group, 1 patient refused to take dihydralazine. In the 35 fully documented patients, BP control was achieved in both groups. The mean reductions in supine systolic/diastolic BP were 31.4/14.6 and 34.7/17.1 mm Hg in the tertatolol and metoprolol groups, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "14": "The Tertatolol International Multicentre Study (TIMS) was aimed at assessing the efficacy and acceptability of 5 mg tertatolol (T) once daily over a 1-year period. The study was carried out in 230 patients (96 men, 134 women, mean age 51.5 +/- 0.7 years) with uncomplicated mild-to-moderate hypertension. After a 1-month placebo run-in period followed by a 1-month double blind placebo-controlled period, 213 patients entered and 166 completed the 1-year open period. A diuretic (D) was added if blood pressure (BP) was inadequately controlled with tertatolol alone. After 1 year, 88.5% of patients were controlled (sitting diastolic BP < or = 90 mmHg): 56.3% on single therapy (T) and 32.2% on dual therapy (T+D), respectively. After a 1-month double-blind period, the incidence of emergent symptoms was not significantly different between the placebo group and the tertatolol group. This low incidence was also observed over the 1-year period, side effects leading to the discontinuation of the treatment in 9.1% of the cases. In patients whose creatinine level was initially higher than 100 mumol/l, tertatolol significantly decreased creatinine level in the single but not in the dual therapy group. This study confirms that tertatolol is an efficient and well-tolerated antihypertensive drug, which improves renal function.", 
    "15": "To evaluate the contribution of atrial distension and/or adrenergic mechanisms in the regulation of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) secretion, plasma immunoreactive ANP, norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (E), and left atrial diameter were measured at rest, during, and after graded upright standardised bicycle exercise in 8 healthy male subjects after single-dose administration of placebo, tertatolol (5 mg), prazosin (1 mg), or combination of tertatolol (5 mg) and prazosin (1 mg). Systolic and diastolic left atrial diameters were measured before, during, and just after exercise by bidimensional echocardiography. Exercise raised plasma ANP concentrations. This rise was greater on tertatolol alone and tertatolol and prazosin than on placebo or prazosin alone: mean area under the plasma ANP concentration curve increased by 35% on tertatolol alone, 45% on tertatolol and prazosin when compared with placebo (p < 0.01), and by 82 and 94%, respectively, when compared with prazosin alone (p < 0.01). The rise in plasma ANP was greater during the postexercise period: 80% for tertatolol alone, 67% for tertatolol and prazosin when compared with placebo (p < 0.01) and 133 and 115%, respectively, when compared with prazosin alone (p < 0.01). The rise in plasma ANP was accompanied by an increase in both systolic and diastolic atrial diameters which was significantly greater on tertatolol alone and on the tertatolol and prazosin combination than on placebo or prazosin alone (p < 0.001). Beta-blockade alone did not affect plasma catecholamine concentrations but exercise-induced increase in plasma NE was significantly potentiated by prazosin and the prazosin and tertatolol combination, and that of plasma E by the prazosin and tertatolol combination.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "16": "Renal hemodynamics in essential hypertensives is characterized by an increase in renal vascular resistance (RVR) and a decrease in renal plasma flow (RPF), while glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is either normal or slightly decreased. Filtration fraction (FF) is increased, indicating that vasoconstriction predominantly affects postglomerular arteries. This increase in FF, called hyperfiltration, can be regarded as a successful maintenance of a normal glomerular filtration but can be deleterious for long-term renal function by favoring the development of glomerulosclerosis. Administration of some beta-blockers (especially propranolol) to hypertensive patients still reduces RPF and GFR, and increases FF. Conversely, in short-term studies, tertatolol has been shown to reduce RVR and increase RPF, without altering FF in hypertensive patients. These effects correspond to a normalization of the renal hemodynamic profile. Their practical interest is however strongly dependent on their persistence in long-term treatment. The beneficial effects of tertatolol were confirmed in 3 long-term studies, lasting for one year. These three studies yielded remarkably similar results: there was a modest overall decrease in serum creatinine, and a more pronounced drop in patients whose pretreatment renal function was altered. These data suggest that tertatolol may preserve the long-term autoregulation of renal hemodynamics. The possibility is raised that in patients with minimal renal dysfunction, tertatolol may also slow down the progression of renal failure.",

    "18": "This paper proposes the structural measurement of autonomic cardiovascular activation components. In a double-blind cross-over design 48 male subjects received either placebo or a combination of 2 out of 3 partial autonomic blockers (p.o.); an alpha-1-adrenergic (indoramin), an unselective beta-adrenergic (propranolol), or a cholinergic antagonist (atropine). During each of the four sessions, the same seven tasks were presented (speech, mental arithmetic, handgrip, signal detection, loud noise, cold pressor, and an anticipation period). Based on a formal model of cardiovascular activation, estimates of the parameters of the model were obtained. The resulting regulatory patterns quantitatively revealed the effects of an alpha-adrenergic, three beta-adrenergic and a cholinergic activation component on 22 cardiovascular variables.", 
    "19": "The prognosis of self-poisoning with beta-blockers is excellent, especially if medical management is started immediately but the wide variety of clinical symptoms and proposed treatments complicate the therapeutic strategy. Beta-blockers that are liposoluble or have marked anti-arrhythmic activity are more lethal (e.g. propranolol, sotalol). Similarly, pre-existing cardiac pathology or co-ingestion of psychotropic or cardioactive drugs increases mortality. The first-line symptomatic treatment is administration of atropine and volume-expanding fluids to treat bradycardia and hypotension, respectively. However atropine is often unsuccessful in reversing beta-blocker-induced bradycardia and repeated doses can provoke atropine poisoning. If symptomatic treatment fails, then antidotes should be administered in a precise order: first, high doses of glucagon, followed by isoproterenol, epinephrine, and the new inhibitors of phosphodiesterases. Mechanical ventilation should be started at the same time as pharmacological treatment in cases of severe collapse or prolonged QRS.", 
    "20": "The results of trabeculectomy in patients with glaucoma secondary to uveitis are poor, but the exact cause of this remains unknown. Therefore, a study was undertaken to determine differences between conjunctiva from patients with glaucoma secondary to uveitis and that from patients with primary open angle glaucoma. Conjunctival biopsies from three patient groups were quantitatively analysed by light microscopy. Group A consisted of 10 patients with glaucoma secondary to uveitis who, prior to surgery, had been treated with topical steroids and topical beta-blocker drugs. Control groups (groups B and C) each consisted of 10 patients with primary open angle glaucoma for whom primary trabeculectomy (group B) or trabeculectomy following failure of topical beta-blockers alone (group C) was planned. Treatment with topical beta-blocker drugs was found to redistribute mast cells within the conjunctiva but to have no significant effect on cell numbers. In comparison with either control group, uveitic conjunctiva was found to contain significantly more fibroblasts, lymphocytes and macrophages. It is possible that these differences are responsible for an enhanced risk of excessive external bleb fibrosis, failure of filtration surgery and poor results with adjunctive 5-fluorouracil.",

    "23": "We investigated the putative common nature of the rat atypical beta-adrenoceptors mediating white adipocyte lipolysis and proximal colon motility inhibition, using the non-selective antagonist alprenolol and agonist isoprenaline and the selective agonists SR 58611A and BRL 37344. Results in either isolated intestinal and fat tissues were consistent with: isoprenaline acting through both typical (beta 1, beta 2) and typical beta-adrenoceptors; SR 58611A and BRL 37344 acting solely through the latter. The identical pA2 values obtained with alprenolol, irrespective of the tissue and the selective agonist (SR 58611A or BRL 37344) used, support the high functional homology of the atypical beta-adrenoceptors in rat colon and adipocytes.", 
    "24": "Clonidine (0.1 mg/kg), an alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, stimulated ultrasonic callings in 10-day-old rats. Unlike normal isolated rat pups, the vocalizations of clonidine-treated rats appeared resilient to maternal cues. Thus, clonidine-induced vocalizations did not decrease during intraoral infusions with 10% sucrose, exposure to home cage bedding or tactile stimulation of the skin. Clonidine (0.05; 0.1; 0.2 mg/kg) also disrupted the attraction normally shown by infant rats to home cage odours in an olfactory place preference test. This effect by clonidine was not shared by raclopride (1-4 mg/kg), naltrexone (0.5-2.0 mg/kg) or propranolol (2.5-10.0 mg/kg). Clonidine-treated infants (0.05; 0.1; 0.2 mg/kg) also failed to apprehend and attach to the anaesthetized mother's nipple. The results raise the possibility that alpha 2-adrenoceptor activation blunts the infant's receptivity to maternal olfactory incentives and intensifies separation-induced responses.", 
    "25": "ICV bicuculline, a selective GABAA antagonist, dose-dependently induced clonic-tonic convulsions in mice. Coadministration of ICV morphine (mu opioid agonist) significantly potentiated ICV bicuculline-induced convulsions, and this effect of morphine was completely blocked by pretreatment with beta-funaltrexamine (beta-FNA), a mu antagonist. ICV glibenclamide, a selective ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel blocker, at a dose which alone did not affect the convulsive threshold of bicuculline, was capable of blocking the exacerbation of ICV bicuculline-induced convulsions by morphine. The present data further suggest that KATP channels may play a tonic regulatory role in the potentiative effect of morphine on ICV bicuculline-induced convulsions.", 
    "26": "Intraperitoneal (IP) administration of bombesin (BBS; 2.5-20 micrograms/kg) induced a dose-dependent inhibition of food intake. The effect was decreased by intraventricular (ICV) administration of bombesin receptor antagonist [Leu14-psi (CH2NH)-Leu13] (3 micrograms/rat) but not by the D1 antagonist SCH 23390, the D2 antagonists sulpiride and pimozide, the dopamine antagonist cis-flupentixol, adrenoceptor blockers phenoxybenzamine or propranolol and serotonergic antagonist methergoline.

    "27": "The effects of seven consecutive daily injections of desmethylimipramine (DMI 20 mg/kg) and propranolol (PRO 10 mg/kg) on 3H-dihydroalprenolol (3H-DHA) and 3H-ketanserin (3H-KET) binding in rat brain were examined. Analyses of saturation binding data using the iterative, nonlinear curve-fitting program LIGAND revealed that PRO increased, while DMI reduced, 3H-DHA binding site density in cerebral cortex without altering receptor affinity, as previously reported. DMI reduced 3H-KET binding site density without changing affinity, and PRO produced the same effect. In cerebral cortex and probably in hippocampus and striatum, DMI and PRO administered together increased the density of 3H-DHA binding sites (beta-adrenergic receptors) and reduced their affinity. This combination of drugs reduced the density of 3H-KET binding sites (5-HT2 receptors) in cerebral cortex, but did not change their affinity. These findings indicate a need for additional studies on the interactions of DMI and PRO and related drugs because of implications for the treatment of depressed patients with cardiovascular disorders.", 
    "28": "The effect of progesterone on the concentration of adenosine 3',5' cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) in the hypothalamus of ovariectomized estradiol primed rats was studied. Progesterone (2 mg/rat), injected 3 days after the priming dose of estradiol benzoate into ovariectomized rats, produced 4 h later an increase in the hypothalamic nucleotide content; whereas the lowest levels of cAMP were found 24 h after progesterone injection suggesting a biphasic response. The increase of hypothalamic cAMP observed at 4h of progesterone injection was blocked by the administration of an alpha(phenoxybenzamine) or a beta-adrenoblocker (propranolol) suggesting the participation of both, alpha and beta adrenergic receptors. Nevertheless, the administration of diethyldithiocarbamate, a blocker of norepinephrine synthesis has no effect to prevent the increase of hypothalamic cAMP induced by progesterone. Since no changes were observed in the hypothalamic cAMP concentration in the animals killed by afternoon, it may be inferred that the effects of progesterone on this parameter may depended on the time of the day at which it was administered.", 
    "29": "The purpose of the present study was to assess the behavioral effects of the beta adrenergic agonist zinterol and to determine whether its actions were mediated by beta adrenergic receptors. Zinterol reduced response rate and increased reinforcement rate of rats under a differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate schedule in a dose-dependent manner; significant decreases in response rate and increases in reinforcement rate were observed at doses of 0.1-1 mg/kg. The effect of 0.3 mg/kg zinterol on this behavior was blocked by pretreatment with the beta adrenergic antagonist propranolol. Zinterol also reduced locomotor activity in a dose-dependent manner; significant reductions were observed at doses of 0.3-10 mg/kg. Similarly, the effect of 1 mg/kg zinterol on locomotor activity was antagonized by propranolol. These effects of zinterol were similar to those of other beta adrenergic agonists as well as those of antidepressant drugs. Although the site of action (central versus peripheral) of zinterol was not determined in the present study, an experiment was carried out to determine if zinterol could act centrally after peripheral administration. The ability of repeated, systemic administration of zinterol to reduce the density of beta adrenergic receptors in cerebral cortex and cerebellum was determined. Repeated treatment with a high dose of zinterol (10 mg/kg, IP) reduced the density of beta adrenergic receptors in these brain regions, suggesting that, at least under certain conditions, systemically administered zinterol did have access to the central nervous system.", 
    "30": "Rats were treated chronically with either cocaine (20 mg/kg/day, 14 days), morphine (incrementing doses of 10 mg/kg/day to 80 mg/kg, 11 days) or saline. During morphine or cocaine abstinence (48 h), dependent rats showed increased anxiety-like behavior in a conditioned defensive burying paradigm as evidenced by significantly shorter latencies to begin burying as well as a 4-fold increase in burying duration relative to saline-treated animals. This withdrawal-induced increase in burying behavior was blocked by pretreatment with either the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (5 mg/kg) or the lipophobic selective beta 1-antagonist, atenolol (5 mg/kg). These results are consistent with the possibility that activation of peripheral beta 1 receptors may substantially contribute to withdrawal-induced anxiety and that beta-adrenergic antagonists could be useful in treating in cocaine and morphine dependent addicts.", 
    "31": "We challenged five patients suffering from tardive akathisia (TA) with intravenous benztropine (2 mg), propranolol (1 mg) and placebo (saline) using a random, double-blind cross-over design to examine the effects of the drugs on the subjective, objective and global manifestations of neuroleptic-induced akathisia. Benztropine produced a marginally significant, and propranolol a significant improvement in the overall manifestations of the disorder. The patients demonstrated a considerable placebo effect and marked variation in their responses to the drugs. The implications of these findings for the pathophysiology of TA in relation to acute akathisia and tardive dyskinesia are discussed.", 
    "32": "The beta adrenergic (beta) agonist salbutamol increased reinforcement rates and decreased response rates on a differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate (DRL) 72-S schedule. These changes in DRL 72-S schedule performance are also produced by most clinically used antidepressants. The effects of salbutamol on a DRL 72-S schedule were dose-dependently antagonized by the beta antagonist metoprolol, but not changed by the 5HT antagonist methysergide. Additionally, neither salbutamol nor the antagonism of salbutamol by metoprolol caused disruption of DRL 72-S schedule performance. These results indicate that stimulation of beta receptors, and not of 5HT receptors, mediates salbutamol antidepressant-like effects on a DRL 72-S schedule.", 
    "33": "The purpose of the present study was to determine the effects of the beta-2 selective adrenergic agonist albuterol on three behaviors, locomotor activity, behavior maintained under a differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate (DRL) schedule, and behavior maintained under a multiple fixed-interval, fixed-ratio (FI-FR) schedule of reinforcement. Albuterol reduced response rate under the DRL schedule in a manner that resulted in an increase in reinforcement rate. Similarly, albuterol reduced response rate under both components of the multiple FI-FR schedule in a dose-dependent manner. The ED50 values for the effects of albuterol on these two operant behaviors were calculated to be approximately 1 mg/kg and the minimal effective doses were 0.3-1 mg/kg. In addition to affecting operant behavior, albuterol also reduced locomotor activity; the ED50 values and minimal effective doses were 0.05 and 0.03 mg/kg, respectively. The effects of albuterol on DRL behavior, FI-FR behavior and locomotor activity were antagonized by the beta adrenergic antagonist propranolol; this suggests that the behavioral effects of this agonist were mediated, at least in part, by beta adrenergic receptors. The differential sensitivity of locomotor activity and operant behavior to albuterol suggests that the actions of this drug on locomotor activity may be mediated predominantly by peripheral beta adrenergic receptors and that its effects on operant behavior may be mediated by beta adrenergic receptors in the central nervous system.", 
    "34": "Chitosan membranes of 20 microns thickness were prepared by a solvent evaporation technique and crosslinked with different concentrations of glutaraldehyde to obtain membranes of various degrees of crosslinking. These membranes were characterized by thermogravimetric (TG) analysis, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and tensile strength studies. The effect of crosslinking on the permeability of membranes to propranolol hydrochloride was evaluated by permeation studies conducted in static glass diffusion cells. A decrease in the thermal stability of chitosan membranes due to crosslinking was observed. The tensile strength of the membranes was improved by crosslinking. The introduction of crosslink points within the membrane reduced its permeability to propranolol hydrochloride as evidenced by decreased permeability and diffusion coefficients. Permeability studies revealed the operation of a pore mechanism in the transport of hydrophilic agents such as propranolol hydrochloride through chitosan and crosslinked chitosan membranes.", 
    "35": "We determined whether the serum lipoprotein levels in insulin-dependent diabetic patients (IDDM) with nephropathy and in patients on haemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis were affected by beta-blocker therapy. A case control study was performed in 18 IDDM patients with diabetic nephropathy, in 18 patients receiving chronic haemodialysis (HD) and 16 patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). In IDDM patients with diabetic nephropathy very low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (VLDL-CHOL) (0.680 +/- 0.17 vs 0.197 +/- 0.04 mmol/l, p = 0.004), total triglycerides (1.71 +/- 0.23 vs 0.808 +/- 0.14 mmol/l, p = 0.004) and very low density lipoprotein triglyceride (VLD-TG) were higher in the beta-blocker therapy group. In haemodialysis patients, beta-blocker therapy caused no significant changes in the serum lipoprotein profiles compared to the control group. In patients receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis VLDL-CHOL was significantly higher (1.47 +/- 0.24 vs 1.08 +/- 0.21 mmol/l, p = 0.042) and cholesterol-high density lipoprotein (HDL-CHOL) was lower in the beta-blocker therapy group. The elevated VLDL-CHOL level (0.96 +/- 0.12 vs 1.24 +/- 0.14 mmol/l, p = 0.021) was correlated with the duration of CAPD in patients receiving beta-blocker therapy. Antihypertensive therapy with beta-blockers in IDDM patients with persistent proteinuria and in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis appears to adversely effect serum lipoproteins which may add to their cardiovascular risk.", 
    "36": "A multicenter clinical trial comparing nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) to atenolol was conducted to evaluate the effects of reporter (physician, patient, and spouse) and assessment of environment (clinic vs. take-home), and structure (long vs. short forms). After a 4-week single-blind, placebo washout, 394 male patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension were randomized to receive 20 weeks of either atenolol or nifedipine GITS, titrated to achieve goal blood pressure of < 90 mm hg for 8 weeks and maintained at the final dose for 12 weeks. Quality-of-life assessments included \"long-form\" clinical assessments by the patient, parallel \"short-form,\" take-home, mail-back assessments by patient and spouse and a side effects and symptom distress evaluation by the physician. Patients completing 20 weeks of therapy indicated a more favorable quality-of-life profile (p < 0.05) for nifedipine GITS compared with atenolol for psychosocial, positive well-being, emotional ties, behavior/emotional control, vitality, and leisure scales using the long-form clinical assessment. The short-form, take-home, mail-back assessments were highly correlated with the clinic assessments, but their responsiveness to treatment differences was less owing to item structure and lower return rates. Spouse reports were more sensitive to treatment differences in sexual functioning with a more favorable response for patients taking nifedipine GITS (p < 0.02). Physicians were less sensitive to the overall impact of side effects, reporting only 14.9% of symptoms reported by the patient. Physician evaluation of symptoms and side effects does not provide the sensitivity required for detecting quality-of-life treatment differences.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "37": "The present investigation was undertaken to study the effect of adrenoreceptor modulators on the expression of salivary proteins. Sprague-Dawley rats were treated for 10 consecutive days with adrenergic agonists isoproterenol, dobutamine, terbutaline, salbutamol, methoxyphenamine, or methoxamine. Antiserum to selected salivary proteins was used to compare the concentration of these proteins in the submandibular and parotid glands of treated animals. Chronic treatments of rats (50 mumol/kg body weight for 10 d) with either isoproterenol or dobutamine induced synthesis of a cysteine-proteinase inhibitor (cystatin) in the submandibular glands. When isoproterenol was injected concomitantly with the mixed beta-antagonist propranolol or the beta 1-adrenergic antagonists metaprolol, protocol, or atenolol, the induction of cystatin was totally suppressed. However, the beta 2-antagonist, ICI-118551, produced only partial reduction in cystatin induction elicited by isoproterenol. On the contrary, rats treated with either isoproterenol or beta 1-agonists demonstrated a significantly reduced concentration of serine-proteinase kallikrein in submandibular glands. The decrease observed in submandibular kallikrein of rats treated with isoproterenol was prevented by concomitant treatment with beta 1-antagonists but not with beta 2-antagonists. Because kallikreins are produced by ductal cells and cystatins are produced by acinar cells of submandibular glands, these observations suggest that there may be differential control of expression of proteins synthesized by ductal and acinar cells. Chronic treatment of rats with nonselective beta-agonist isoproterenol or beta 1-selective agonists increased markedly the proline-rich proteins (PRP) in parotid glands, but the parotid amylase concentration was not significantly affected by beta-adrenergic agonists.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Replacement of open operations by transurethral resection has resulted in a marked reduction both in morbidity and mortality, in turn broadening the indications for surgery even in cases with relatively minor symptoms. Our understanding of prostatic hyperplasia is increasing and in recent years many new options for the treatment of this troublesome disease have emerged. The article consists in a review of current thinking on prostatic hyperplasia, its diagnosis and treatment.", 
    "39": "Exogenous galanin (9 pmol/min during 20 min i.a.) decreased insulin levels in the plasma sampled from the pancreatic vein of the blood-perfused pancreas of dogs in which ganglionic transmission and beta-adrenoceptors had been blocked. This effect was not modified by idazoxan (1 mg/kg followed by 0.02 mg/kg/min i.v.) but was partially reduced (50%) by glibenclamide (1 mg/kg followed by 0.02 mg/kg/min i.v.). This dose of glibenclamide blocked entirely the hypoinsulinemic activity of diazoxide, an activator of pancreatic ATP-modulated K+ channels, whereas the dose of idazoxan prevented the effect of the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist UK-14,304. Therefore, in dogs, the decrease in insulin secretion produced by exogenous galanin is only partially mediated by activation of glibenclamide-sensitive ATP-gated K+ channels and is independent of alpha 2-adrenoceptor stimulation.", 
    "40": "Norepinephrine and trans-1-aminocyclopentyl-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (ACPD) each individually stimulated hydrolysis of phosphoinositides and when tested in combination caused a stimulation that was 50-90% greater than additive in hippocampal and cortical slices of the rat but not in striatal slices. This synergistic augmentation of hydrolysis of phosphoinositide was evident with all stimulatory concentrations of norepinephrine and of ACPD up to 1 mM, at which point ACPD was inhibitory. A time-course study revealed no lag in the synergistic interaction and no down-regulation through 60 min of incubation of the augmented response to the combined agonists. The synergistic reaction was mediated by alpha 1-adrenergic receptors and by metabotropic excitatory amino acid receptors. Increased intracellular calcium, but not activation of protein kinase C, may play a role in mediating the synergistic interaction. Thus, a unique synergistic stimulatory interaction was found between two receptors coupled with phosphoinositide metabolism, a finding which also supports the suggestion that these two systems are co-localized in some cells.", 
    "41": "We compared the electrophysiologic and clinical effects of oral cibenzoline and sotalol in 12 patients with spontaneous and inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), using a randomized, open-label, cross-over study. Electrophysiologic studies were performed in the control state, after oral cibenzoline and after oral sotalol, using an incremental dose-titration protocol. Therapy with cibenzoline at the maximum dose level (130-390 mg/day) resulted in complete suppression of VT in 1 of 12 patients (8%). Sotalol (160-320 mg/day) prevented induction of VT in 4 of 12 patients (33%). The effective refractory period (ERP) of the right ventricle was more significantly prolonged with sotalol (p < 0.001) as compared with cibenzoline (p < 0.05). Neither drug prolonged QT duration corrected for frequency (QTc) and cycle length of induced VT, as compared with the control study. Three patients experienced spontaneous VT after cibenzoline administration, and 2 patients experienced incessant VT during programmed electrical stimulation. No patient had a proarrhythmic effect while receiving oral sotalol treatment. Chronic sotalol therapy maintained long-term arrhythmia suppression in all 4 responders at 1-year follow-up. Sotalol appears to have greater efficacy than and a safety profile superior to that of cibenzoline. Drug-related proarrhythmic effects of oral cibenzoline therapy occurred with greater frequency than that associated with other antiarrhythmic drugs. Based on these findings, cibenzoline cannot be recommended for use in patients with VT.", 
    "42": "beta-Adrenergic blocking drugs are effective in reducing sudden cardiac death after acute myocardial infarction but the precise mechanism of this effect is unclear. We investigated the acute and chronic effects of acebutolol, a beta-adrenergic blocker, on electrocardiographic parameters, diastolic excitability threshold (DET), and right ventricular effective refractory period (RVERP) in chronically instrumented conscious dogs. These parameters were determined during spontaneous sinus rhythm and at a fixed pacing rate (200 beats/min). Acebutolol (0.5, 1, and 5 mg/kg i.v.) decreased the heart rate (HR) (by 23, 26, and 24%, respectively) without effects on any electrocardiographic parameters or on the DET. The maximal increases in ERP were 4.7, 7, and 7.8%, respectively, during pacing and 8.5, 13.3, and 10.3%, respectively, during sinus rhythm. Acebutolol, 10 mg/kg/day P.O. for 6 weeks, reduced the HR from the third day onward without altering the PR, QRS, QT, or QTc intervals or the DET. The increase in ERP was significant from the third day (14%) during pacing and from the seventh day (15.5%) during sinus rhythm. The degree of prolongation of the ERP subsequently remained stable during the 6 weeks of treatment. The ERP returned to the baseline value 7 days after acebutolol withdrawal. This increase in ERP, which was more marked during chronic oral treatment, could contribute to the documented protective effect of the beta-blocking drugs against sudden cardiac death after myocardial infarction.", 
    "43": "We studied the effects of alprenolol and bromoacetylalprenololmenthane (BAAM) on rat left atria. Alprenolol and BAAM at 10(-7), 3 x 10(-7), and 10(-6) M inhibited the cardiac stimulation response slightly, which is indicative of membrane-stabilizing activity independent of beta-adrenoceptor blockade. This membrane-stabilizing activity was readily reversible. Alprenolol and BAAM also caused surmountable antagonism of isoprenaline responses, and this beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonism was slowly reversible. Inhibition of the isoprenaline responses with alprenolol and BAAM at 10(-6) M was at equilibrium after 60 min, which is indicative of reversible antagonism. We conclude that alprenolol and BAAM are competitive slowly reversible beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonists on rat left atria.", 
    "44": "The effects of two types of laboratory stressors, a structured interview and the cold pressor test, on blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were studied in normotensive individuals (n = 16), unmedicated hypertensive patients (n = 12), and medicated hypertensive patients (n = 46). Fifteen patients were in the bisoprolol group, 16 patients were in the enalapril group, and 15 patients were in the nitrendipine group. Concurrent physiologic measures, finger pulse volume (FPV), electrodermal activity, and respiratory frequency (RF), were also used to evaluate the level of stress reached by the subjects during and after the tasks. No significant differences were evident between the different treatments in BP and other physiologic responses to stressors. Patients receiving bisoprolol maintained lower HR and systolic BP values, but these differences were not related to the reaction to the stressors. No significant differences were noted in diastolic BP (DBP) between the different groups. The highest physiologic responses were obtained during the structured interview. Antihypertensive monotherapy does not attenuate cardiovascular reactions induced by acute stress in controlled laboratory conditions. In laboratory studies of the relationships between stress and hypertension, it is important that social stressors be used and that physiologic rather than cardiovascular measures of stress be recorded.", 
    "45": "Beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptor (beta-ARs) expression in the thick ascending limb of rat kidney was studied at the level of mRNA and receptor coupling to adenylyl cyclase. Absolute quantitation of beta 1- and beta 2-AR mRNAs in microdissected nephron segments was performed with an assay based on reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction, using in vitro transcribed mutant RNAs as internal standards. In the cortical thick ascending limb (CTAL), the number of mRNA molecules/mm of tubular length was 2,806 +/- 328 (n = 12) for beta 1-AR and 159 +/- 26 for beta 2-AR (P < 0.01). Lower levels were obtained in the medullary thick ascending, beta 1-AR mRNA still being predominant. The pharmacological properties of beta-ARS was also studied in the CTAL. Cyclic AMP accumulation was stimulated by beta-agonist with a rank order of potency of isoproterenol > norepinephrine > epinephrine. This observation, and the higher efficiency of a beta 1 than of a beta 2 antagonist to inhibit isoproterenol-induced cAMP accumulation, establish the typical beta 1-AR sensitivity of the CTAL. No detectable contribution of atypical or beta 3-ARs to adenylyl cyclase stimulation could be found. In conclusion, this study, which shows markedly different levels of beta 1- and beta 2-AR mRNAS in the CTAL, provides a molecular basis for the predominant expression of the beta 1 receptor subtype in this nephron segment.", 
    "46": "Platelet aggregability was studied in 81 patients with prior myocardial infarction with various cardiac arrhythmias and its effects of some antiarrhythmic agents (allapinine, ethacizine, obsidan and cordarone). It was 32-39% higher in patients with frequent ventricular extrasystole (VE) and VE of high grades (4a and 4b by the classification of Lown and Wolt) than in control patients (without arrhythmias) and patients with supraventricular and rare VE. Ethacizine and cordarone produced a significant inhibitory effects on platelet functional activity, but the effects of allapinine and obsidan on this parameter were insignificant. There was no correlation between the magnitude of antiarrhythmic effects of the drugs and their antiaggregatory properties. It was shown that the results of examining the effects of antiarrhythmic agents on platelet aggregability in vitro were not in agreement with those obtained in vivo.", 
    "47": "The acute hemodynamic and electrophysiologic effects of intravenous amlodipine (2 x 10 mg), administered either alone or on a background of beta-blocker therapy, were studied in 25 patients with angina pectoris. Hemodynamic assessments showed that amlodipine produced significant decreases in systemic vascular resistance and systemic blood pressure, and increases in stroke volume and cardiac output in both treatment groups. Electrophysiologic evaluation revealed that neither sinus node function, nor HIS ventricular conduction, were altered with amlodipine. Therefore, acute intravenous administration of amlodipine alone or in combination with a beta-blocker does not appear to compromise left ventricular performance, sinus node function, or intracardiac conduction.", 
    "48": "Theoretically, it should be possible to match the requirements of individual patients with the pharmacological and clinical properties of the large number of antihypertensive drugs now available. The concept of automatic sequential stepped-care therapy is now largely outdated, but therapy of clinically important hypertension must be initiated with one agent. Diuretics remain a first-line option in the elderly and in Black patients, as do calcium antagonists. Outcome trials are available only for the elderly, and in these the benefits of initial diuretic therapy are well documented. Nonetheless, diuretics may often need to be co-prescribed with a beta-blocker or an adrenergic modifier such as methyldopa. beta-Blockers are preferred in patients with ischaemic heart disease or enhanced adrenergic drive, while alpha-blockers are preferred in patients with blood lipid abnormalities or prostatic problems. Calcium antagonists or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are being increasingly used as initial therapy when quality of life is important and metabolic neutrality is required. Calcium antagonists are more likely to be effective first-line therapy than ACE inhibitors in patients with a high salt intake, in patients with Raynaud's disease, when angina pectoris is present, and in Black patients. ACE inhibitors are preferred for combination with diuretic agents, and in the presence of congestive heart failure or low salt intake. Experimentally, both calcium antagonists and ACE inhibitors can prevent ischaemic ventricular fibrillation and atheroma. Combination therapy between these 2 drug classes is gaining increasing acceptance because of these theoretical advantages.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "49": "The authors investigated the prevalence of ventricular ectopic activity (VEA) during exercise testing and 24-hour ambulatory Holter monitoring and its relation with ischemic episodes during daily activities before and during therapy with diltiazem and penbutolol in 41 patients with stable and typical angina pectoris. Seven (17%) of the 41 patients had exercise-induced ventricular ectopic activity (EIVA). Premature ventricular complexes (PVC) Lown grade I disappeared in 6 patients on therapy and appeared in another 6 new patients. PVC Lown grade IV A in one patient before therapy changed to Lown grade IV B upon therapy. There was no difference between patients with and without EIVA in the ages, average number of angina onset per day, percentage patients with exercise angina, average functional class, percentage of patients with exercise ST depression, average maximal ST depression, heart rate and systolic blood pressure at peak exercise and duration of exercise. The workload before therapy was similar in the 2 groups, but was significantly greater during therapy in patients without EIVA. During 984 hours of recording, 185 ischemic episodes were detected in 25 patients before therapy, and 111 ischemic episodes in 20 patients during therapy. PVC was observed in 12 (48%) of the 25 patients and in 81 (27%) of the 295 ischemic episodes. VEA during ischemic episodes was observed in patients with and without baseline PVC. The ventricular arrhythmias found were more complex types during ischemic episodes than baseline. Thus, the incidence of VEA in patients with stable and typical angina pectoris was 17% during exercise and 52% during daily activities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "50": "Several drugs used for antihypertensive therapy may modify the lipoprotein metabolism. Thiazides in high dosage and loop diuretics can increase serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and/or very-LDL cholesterol and the total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ratio, while HDL cholesterol is largely unchanged; triglycerides (Tg) are also often elevated. Premenopausal women may be protected from this side effect. Whether diuretic-induced dyslipidemia is dose-dependent and low thiazide doses (i.e., hydrochlorothiazide < or = 12.5 mg daily) are interacting less, awaits clarification. beta-Blockers without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity increase serum triglycerides and tend to lower the potentially antiatherogenic HDL cholesterol. The diuretic-antihypertensive agent indapamide, given at a dose of 2.5 mg/day, is neutral with regard to serum lipoprotein and glucose metabolism. The potassium-sparing diuretic spironolactone, conventional sympatholytic agents, calcium-channel blockers, and probably the serotonin2-receptor antagonist ketanserin, exert no relevant effects on the lipoprotein profile. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may slightly decrease serum triglycerides. alpha 1-Receptor blockers slightly decrease LDL cholesterol and Tg and increase HDL cholesterol. Drug-induced development or aggravation of dyslipidemia represents a potentially adverse influence. In the hypertensive population, effective blood pressure control with traditional drug therapy based on thiazide-type diuretics in high dosage led to a distinct decrease in cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality, but failed to satisfactorily reduce coronary complications. The prognostic relevance of drug-induced changes in serum lipoproteins, carbohydrate metabolism and other risk factors or correlates awaits further clarification.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "51": "Epidemiologic studies suggest a close association between hypertension, obesity, and diabetes. It has been demonstrated that essential hypertension, per se, is an insulin-resistant state. However, the pathogenesis of the association between insulin resistance and hypertension is poorly understood. Elevated plasma insulin levels may contribute to the development of hypertension through renal sodium reabsorption, the sympathetic nervous system, the transmembranous cation transport, the renin-angiotensin system, the cardiovascular reactivity, and the atrial natriuretic peptide. Diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and alpha 1-antagonists are first-choice drugs in the management of hypertension. Diuretics, except indapamide, impair insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. The same negative effects, exerted by beta-blockers, are reduced employing those with selective activity. With few exceptions, calcium antagonists have no adverse influence on carbohydrate metabolism. ACE inhibitors and alpha 1-antagonists do not influence or even improve glucose metabolism.", 
    "52": "The effect of 6 months of treatment with indapamide (IND, 2.5 mg/day) on regression of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), an independent predictor of poor prognosis in hypertension, was compared by echocardiography to that of nifedipine (NFD, 40 mg/day), enalapril (ENL, 20 mg/day), atenolol (ATL, 100 mg/day), and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ, 25 mg/day) in four parallel double-blind studies in 151 hypertensive patients with a diastolic blood pressure between 95 and 120 mm Hg and a raised left ventricular mass index (LVMI) (mg/m2) (Devereux). Patients were randomized to IND or comparator following a 2-week washout (1 month in the IND vs. ATL study). Respective baseline and 6-month LVMI values (mg/m2) were: IND (n = 20) vs. HCTZ (n = 20): 151.4 +/- 6.3 and 125.70 +/- 4.6 (p < 0.001) vs. 141.3 +/- 6.6 and 135.6 +/- 8.3 (p = N.S.); IND (n = 22) vs NFD (n = 19): 144.1 +/- 5.3 and 125.1 +/- 4.3 (p < 0.001) vs. 170.4 +/- 6.6 and 148.2 +/- 6.2 (p < 0.001); IND (n = 9) vs. ENL (n = 9): 155.1 +/- 6.3 and 143.4 +/- 5.2 (p < 0.001) vs. 142.0 +/- 6.7 and 130.0 +/- 5.9 (p < 0.001); IND (n = 17) vs. ATL (n = 12): 146.2 +/- 5.1 and 130.8 +/- 6.5 (p < 0.001) vs. 156.7 +/- 8.4 and 142.9 +/- 10.3 (p < 0.01). All drugs significantly reduced diastolic blood pressure, and all except HCTZ induced a significant and similar reduction in left ventricular mass.",

Details of the many studies that individually and collectively document the ability of long-term and acute beta-blocker therapy to reduce overall mortality, sudden cardiovascular death, and nonfatal reinfarction in patients surviving or experiencing a myocardial infarction are described. A discussion of the mechanisms by which beta blockers probably and theoretically achieve these benefits includes the suggestion that they may reduce plaque rupture, thus indirectly inhibiting thrombosis. It is also suggested that, in the future, further cardioprotective benefits may accrue to the use of beta blockers in conjunction with thrombolysis and of beta blockers with a duration of action sustained throughout a full 24 hours.",

Basal pharmacokinetic indexes were estimated on measured levels of propranolol concentration. It was found, that nitrates used with propranolol at the same time decrease its concentration in serum and bioavailability, and increase propranolol clearance calculated for whole body, its distribution volume and shorten propranolol life half-time in the blood serum.", 
    "55": "The mechanism of the effect of noradrenaline on the transport of 3-O-methyl-D-[14C]glucose ([14C]-MG) was studied in mouse brown adipocytes. When cells were exposed to low concentrations (< 10(-8) M) of insulin, the [14C]-MG uptake by cells was enhanced by noradrenaline additively. The action of noradrenaline was mimicked by isoproterenol, and was completely blocked by propranolol. Exposing cells to noradrenaline induced both an increase in the transport activity of plasma membrane fractions and a decrease in that of microsomal fractions similar to insulin exposure, indicating that noradrenaline also induces the translocation of glucose transporters to the plasma membrane. The ratio of an increase in the transport activity of plasma membrane fraction to a decrease in the activity of microsomal fraction was lower in cells exposed to noradrenaline than in cells exposed to insulin. This quantitative disagreement suggests that there are at least two different modes involved in the regulation of the translocation of glucose transporters in mouse brown adipocytes.", 
    "56": "Wistar rat pups were implanted with bilateral olfactory bulb cannulas on postnatal day 5 (PN5). On PN6, pups were trained in an olfactory classical conditioning task with peppermint odor as the CS and tactile stimulation/stroking as the UCS. Pups were randomly assigned to either PAIRED, BACKWARD or ODOR-only conditions. Half the pups in each group received intrabulbar infusions of 100 microM propranolol and half received intrabulbar infusions of saline during the training session. Propranolol infusions blocked acquisition of the learned odor preference expressed by PAIRED saline-infused pups. Diffusion of the infusate was checked in additional pups by infusing [3H]NE and performing LSC analysis. Infusate concentration did not significantly differ between the anterior and posterior halves of the bulb, but were sharply lower in the olfactory peduncle and more posterior areas. The results suggest that olfactory bulb NE is critical for early olfactory learning.", 
    "57": "Propranolol (PL) metabolism was studied in the isolated perfused rat liver under single-pass and steady-state conditions. An attempt was made to predict the data observed in the isolated rat liver perfusion at PL infusion rates of 89-1317 nmol/min using the microsomal kinetic parameters obtained in our previous paper (Ishida et al., Biochem Pharmacol 43: 2489-2492, 1992) and the unbound PL fractions in rat liver microsomes and the perfusion medium. The values of kinetic parameters obtained in rat liver microsomes were corrected for the whole liver. Two groups of cytochrome P450 isozymes having high (Km < 0.5 microM)- and low (Km > 20 microM)-affinities participate in the metabolism of PL and sudan III pretreatment induces the low-affinity enzymes rather than the high-affinity enzymes in control rats. Of high-affinity isozyme(s) PL 4-hydroxylase and 7-hydroxylase made a major contribution to the overall activity, while for low-affinity isozymes PL 4-hydroxylase and N-desisopropylase did. A nonlinear relationship between the PL concentrations entering and leaving the liver was predicted from these corrected kinetic parameters using the venous equilibrium model. The outflow concentrations and the metabolic rates of PL for the predicted curves were over-estimated at higher inflow PL concentrations and under-estimated at higher substrate concentrations, respectively. On the other hand, the prediction for them was successfully carried out for the livers whose intrinsic clearance was altered due to the induction of low-affinity enzymes in PL metabolism by sudan III pretreatment. The outflow rates of 4-hydroxypropranolol showed a downward curvature at lower substrate concentrations, followed a linear rise in the livers from control rats, while the outflow rates of 5- and 7-hydroxypropranolol exhibited their respective limiting values. The outflow rates of 4-hydroxypropranolol and N-desisopropylpropranolol were enhanced markedly with increasing the outflow unbound concentration of PL by sudan III pretreatment. These results indicate that non-linear PL first-pass metabolism is due to the saturation of the reactions for the high-affinity enzymes among enzymes engaging in PL ring hydroxylations.", 
    "58": "The pharmacological properties of BRL 37,344 (sodium-4-(2'-[2-hydroxy-2- (3-chloro-phenyl)ethylamino]-propyl)phenoxyacetatesesquihydrate), a beta 3-selective agonist, and CGP 12,177A) (-)-4-(3-t-butyl amino-2-hydroxypropoxy) benzimidazole-2-one], a non-selective beta-antagonist, recently characterized as a partial beta 3-agonist in rat adipose tissue, were studied in comparison with isoproterenol, a non-selective beta-agonist, in plasma membranes prepared from the livers of newborn rats. Competition binding curves obtained with [125I]iodocyanopindolol ([125I]CYP) as ligand and isoproterenol or BRL 37,344 as competitor were characterized by the presence of a high and a low affinity binding site; the high affinity binding site was no longer detectable when guanidylimidobisphosphate (GppNHp) was present in the incubation mixture. Competition curves with CGP 12,177A were monophasic and independent of GppNHp. In the presence of 10(-7) M of the beta 2-selective antagonist ICI 118,551 [erythro-(+/-)-1-(7-methylindan-4-yloxy)-3-isopropylamino butan-2-ol], a concentration which blocks most of the beta 2-receptors, ligand binding was reduced to 32% of its maximum. Under these conditions, isoproterenol further displaced the ligand, and competition curves still displayed the high and the low affinity binding sites; BRL 37,344, however, caused no further displacement of ligand, except at the highest concentrations. This suggests that BRL 37,344 occupies only the ICI 118,551-sensitive binding sites, i.e. beta 2-receptors. Isoproterenol and BRL 37,344 both stimulated adenylate cyclase (EC 4.6.1.1) activity concentration dependently, although the stimulating effect of BRL 37,344 was about half of what was found for isoproterenol. Furthermore, BRL 37,344 inhibited concentration dependently the isoproterenol-induced stimulation of adenylate cyclase, and the inhibition was dependent on the concentration of isoproterenol. The stimulating effect of isoproterenol and BRL 37,344 on adenylate cyclase was blocked by ICI 118,551, whereas the beta 1-selective antagonist CGP 20,712A ((+/-)-(2-(3-carbamoyl-4-hydroxyphenoxy)-ethylamino)-3-[4-(1-methy l-4- trifluoromethyl-2-imidazolyl)-phenoxy]-2-propanolmethane sulphonate) was ineffective. CGP 12,177A failed to stimulate adenylate cyclase activity. From these results we suggest that BRL 37,344 acts as a beta 2-partial agonist in rat liver. The results obtained with CGP 12,177A are typical for a non-selective beta-antagonist. We therefore conclude that there is no pharmacological evidence for the presence of beta 3-receptors in livers from newborn rats.", 
    "59": "The effects of castration and androgen-replacement on adrenergic receptors in membranes from the rat seminal vesicle were studied. Membranes from seminal vesicles showed saturable and high-affinity binding sites for the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, [3H]dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA), and the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, [3H]prazosin. Castration markedly reduced beta-adrenergic receptors with decreasing the effect of GTP modulating the receptor-ligand affinity, suggesting defects in both the receptor per se and the guanine-nucleotides-regulating mechanism after castration. In contrast, castration increased alpha 1-adrenergic receptors and androgen-replacement reversed this change. The effects of GTP decreasing the alpha 1-receptor binding affinity to the radioligand were observed to a similar extent in the castrated and control membranes. These results demonstrate an inverse regulation by androgen on beta- and alpha 1-adrenergic receptors in membranes of the rat seminal vesicle.", 
    "60": "Carvedilol's potent antioxidant activity could explain its protective action in brain ischemia, but may not apply to glutamate-induced excitotoxicity in cultured cerebellar granule cells, since glutamate neurotoxicity was not associated with the formation of lipid peroxidative products. Rather, carvedilol diminished the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)/glycine-induced increase in intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i), lowering [Ca2+]i by a maximum of 66 +/- 5% (n = 8) with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 0.8 microM. Prior addition of 5 microM dihydropyridines did not shift the dose-response of carvedilol, but did significantly lower the NMDA/glycine-stimulated response to 64% of untreated (n = 8, P = 0.014). Inclusion of 5 microM carvedilol before the additions of NMDA/glycine prevented 85% of the increase in [Ca2+]i. Furthermore, carvedilol displaced 3[H]MK-801 binding to rat brain cortical membranes with a Kd of 29.4 +/- 2.2 microM (n = 6) and no selectively for the glutamate or glycine binding sites. These data therefore suggest that, in addition to its antihypertensive and anti-lipid peroxidative functions, carvedilol has neuroprotective activity as a calcium channel blocker and as a non-competitive inhibitor at the NMDA receptor.", 
    "61": "The Swiss cantons of Vaud and Fribourg participate in the international MONICA project (MONI-toring of trends and determinants in CArdiovascular disease). Within this context, drug therapies and procedures were recorded during two separate years (1986 and 1990) for all hospitalizations of men aged 25 to 64 with the diagnosis of myocardial infarction. The medical files were reviewed to classify this diagnosis as possible or definite on the basis of the symptoms, the ECG results and the enzymatic tests. The two study populations (n = 318 in 1986 and n = 332 in 1990) are comparable with respect to age, history of ischemic heart disease and initial care. In 1990, half of the patients arrived at hospital in less than 3 hours, the median time delay being 4 hours for those first attending a general practitioner and 2 hours for those transferred directly. The frequency of treatments between 1986 and 1990 is compared only for cases with a definite diagnosis of myocardial infarction (respectively n = 217 and n = 223). The proportion of patients given thrombolytic therapy rose from 9% to 44% (p < 0.005) and from 51% to 95% (p < 0.005) for those treated with antiplatelet drugs, whereas the proportion fell from 72% to 55% (p < 0.005) for calcium blockers and from 33% to 24% (p < 0.05) for inotropic drugs. The use of anticoagulants (in 98% of patients) and of beta blockers (in 57%) remained stable across time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "62": "Clinical trials have demonstrated a prophylactic role for aspirin in myocardial infarction and in unstable angina pectoris. The Swedish Angina Pectoris Aspirin Trial (SAPAT) is the first prospective study of aspirin in stable angina. 2035 patients were randomised double-blind to treatment with aspirin 75 mg daily or placebo. All patients were treated with sotalol for control of symptoms. The median duration of follow-up was 50 months. Compared with the placebo+sotalol group, the aspirin+sotalol group had a 34% (81 vs 124 patients) reduction in primary outcome events (myocardial infarction and sudden death; 95% confidence interval 24-49%; p = 0.003) and the reduction observed in secondary outcome events (vascular events, vascular death, all cause mortality, stroke) ranged from 22% to 32%. Treatment withdrawal caused by adverse events occurred in 109 patients in the aspirin+sotalol group and 100 in patients in the placebo+sotalol group; major bleeds, including haemorrhagic stroke, occurred in 20 and 13 patients, respectively (not significant). The addition of a low dose of aspirin to sotalol treatment showed significant benefit in terms of cardiovascular events, including a significant reduction in the incidence of first myocardial infarction in patients with symptoms of stable angina pectoris.",

Among patients assigned to the invasive strategy, coronary arteriography revealed that those with antecedent angina had a more severe residual stenosis of the infarct-related artery after thrombolytic therapy (77.1 +/- 0.7% vs. 73.0 +/- 0.9%, p < 0.001) and more multivessel disease (37.9% vs. 26.4%, p < 0.001). The clinical outcome of the patients with antecedent angina assigned randomly to either the invasive or the conservative strategy were compared. The invasive strategy patients had a slightly lesser incidence of recurrent chest pain in the hospital (29.9% vs. 34.8%, p = 0.13) and more negative (normal) findings on exercise tolerance tests (24.7 vs. 18.9%, p = 0.003), but there was no difference between the treatment strategies in the end point variable of recurrent myocardial infarction or death.",

However, similar to the results for the overall population, the invasive strategy does not alter the risk of reinfarction or death compared with the conservative approach.", 
    "68": "Growing evidence indicates that oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) may promote atherogenesis. Therefore, inhibition of LDL oxidation may impede this process. Carvedilol is a vasodilating, beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent. As a new antihypertensive drug, carvedilol is unique by virtue of its potent antioxidant activity. Therefore, we tested the ability of carvedilol to inhibit the oxidation of LDL by either macrophages or Cu2+. Carvedilol inhibited LDL oxidation by macrophages in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC50 value of 3.8 microM, as assessed by a thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) assay. Under the same conditions, propranolol showed only a mild inhibitory effect (IC50 > 100 microM), while pindolol, atenolol and labetalol had almost no effect. Carvedilol, at 10 microM, almost completely inhibited the macrophage-induced increase in electrophoretic mobility of LDL, while other beta-blockers at 50-300 microM had no significant effect. Carvedilol inhibited superoxide release from mouse macrophages, which correlated well with its inhibition of LDL oxidation. Carvedilol also inhibited Cu(2+)-induced LDL oxidation with an IC50 value of 17 microM, while all other beta-blockers were inactive up to 300 microM. These observations suggest that carvedilol might not only be an effective antihypertensive drug, but might also be effective in prevention of atherosclerosis.", 
    "69": "Anomalously low affinities for the beta-1-adrenoceptor are seen for members of a series of para-substituted N-isopropylphenoxypropanolamines in which the substituent is able to conjugate with the aromatic ring. The energy of conjugation was calculated using the AM1 semiempirical molecular orbital method and appears to correlate with the loss of binding energy, and hence affinity for the receptor. This suggests that binding is associated with movement of the substituent out of the plane of the aromatic ring due to steric interference with the receptor. A previously unrecognized binding site for aromatic groups off the para position is also identified.", 
    "70": "The aim of the present analysis was to calculate the cost-effectiveness of metoprolol versus thiazide diuretics in middle-aged men with mild to moderate uncomplicated hypertension. The analysis was based on the Metoprolol Atherosclerosis Prevention in Hypertensives (MAPHY) study, a randomised trial which showed a significantly lower risk for coronary events in patients taking metoprolol than in patients on thiazide diuretics. The main analysis was based on Swedish costs, but the costs were also varied in a special sensitivity analysis. Metoprolol was shown to be cost-saving compared with thiazide diuretics when both direct and indirect costs of morbidity were included. When only direct costs were included, the cost per life-year gained was $US2400. The result of the present analysis suggests that metoprolol is to be preferred to thiazide diuretics from a cost-effectiveness standpoint in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension in middle-aged men. These findings regarding cost-effectiveness should, however, not be extrapolated to patient groups not included in the MAPHY trial.", 
    "71": "The proposed action of beta-p-chlorophenylglutamate (chlorpheg) as a selective blocker of L-homocysteate uptake was studied in primary cultures of mouse brain neurons and astrocytes and in rat brain synaptosomes. The preparations were incubated with 1 microM to 10 mM L-homocysteate and D-aspartate in the absence and presence of 7.5 mM chlorpheg. In each preparation uptake of the two amino acids comprised a saturable uptake and a non-saturable (passive diffusion) component. L-Homocysteate was of at least 100-fold lower affinity than D-aspartate as a substrate for the amino acid transporter. Chlorpheg was shown to be essentially equieffective as a weak competitive inhibitor of only the saturable uptake of L-homocysteate and D-aspartate. It is concluded that chlorpheg is not a selective blocker of L-homocysteate uptake.", 
    "72": "The significance of platelet beta-adrenoceptors for platelet responses to adrenergic stimuli in vivo and in vitro was studied in healthy volunteers. Low dose infusion of the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline decreased platelet aggregability in vivo as measured by ex vivo filtragometry. Infusion of adrenaline, a mixed alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor agonist, increased platelet aggregability in vivo markedly, as measured by ex vivo filtragometry and plasma beta-thromboglobulin levels. Adrenaline levels were 3-4 nM in venous plasma during infusion. Both adrenaline and high dose isoprenaline elevated plasma von Willebrand factor antigen levels. beta-Blockade by propranolol did not alter our measures of platelet aggregability at rest or during adrenaline infusions, but inhibited adrenaline-induced increases in vWf:ag. In a model using filtragometry to assess platelet aggregability in whole blood in vitro, propranolol enhanced the proaggregatory actions of 5 nM, but not of 10 nM adrenaline. The present data suggest that beta-adrenoceptor stimulation can inhibit platelet function in vivo but that effects of adrenaline at high physiological concentrations are dominated by an alpha-adrenoceptor mediated proaggregatory action.", 
    "73": "One hundred survivors of sudden death were randomized to four groups and treated with Amiodarone, Propafenone and Metoprolol, or were supplied with an automatic implantable cardioverter/defibrillator (AICD, control group). Prospective Holter-monitoring showed that the prognostic significance of the complexity and frequency of ventricular ectopic activity in survivors of sudden cardiac death is relative to the chosen prophylactic antiarrhythmic treatment: Findings in the control group confirm the classical notion that frequent and complex ventricular ectopic activity is predictive for recurrent life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias (relapse) (> or = 25 VES/h, p < 0.05; Lown IVb, just short of statistical significance). Therapy with Amiodarone reduced frequent and complex ventricular ectopic activity as well as the 2-year relapse rate, which was significantly lower than in the control group (AICD: 36%, Amiodarone 12%, p = 0.03). Under Metoprolol the frequency and complexity of ectopic ventricular activity increased, yet the relapse rate was reduced (12%, p = 0.03). Under Propafenone, especially, those patients who showed low frequencies of ventricular ectopic activity were at high risk; the 2-year relapse rate was 28%.",

After 1 year of thyroxine therapy the glaucoma was easily controlled, pilocarpine treatment was stopped and the visual fields were completely normal. To our knowledge this is the first report in the modern literature of reversal of open-angle glaucoma with treatment of hypothyroidism.", 
    "75": "Alterations in cortical EEG activity in male rats produced by putative agonists at dopamine (DA) autoreceptors and by antagonists at postsynaptic DA receptors were compared in order to study, whether an impairment in dopaminergic neurotransmission via two different mechanisms might result in similar or different effects. Simultaneously to the EEG recordings, gross behaviour was observed. Putative agonists at DA autoreceptors (apomorphine 0.05 mg/kg, quinpirole 0.05 mg/kg, or talipexole 0.02 mg/kg s.c.) produced increases in the power in all of the frequency bands, except beta-2, with the most pronounced increase in the delta band. These EEG alterations were accompanied by hypokinesia, ptosis and yawning. In contrast, antagonists at DA receptors (haloperidol 0.1 mg/kg i.p., D2 blocker) or SCH 23390 (0.2 mg/kg i.p., D1 blocker) led to little increases in the delta band, but more pronounced increases in the alpha-2 band. Behavioural signs were hypokinesia, but little ptosis and yawning. The combination of both blockers produced, in addition, strong increases in the delta band and behavioural signs of ptosis and yawning. These results suggest that activation of putative dopamine autoreceptors produces EEG patterns and behavioural patterns different from those produced by blockade of either D1 or D2 postsynaptic dopamine receptors. In contrast, the effects following a stimulation of putative DA autoreceptors, which are expected to decrease the release of the agonist and its action at postsynaptic D1 and D2 receptors, were very similar to those found after a combined blockade of both types of postsynaptic dopamine receptors.", 
    "76": "To determine whether membranes of mammalian central neurons contain an ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channel similar to that present in pancreatic beta cells, the patch-clamp technique was applied to cultured neurons prepared from the neonatal rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus. In whole-cell experiments with hippocampal neurons, extracellular application of 0.5 mM diazoxide (a KATP channel activator) elicited a hyperpolarization concomitant with an increase in membrane conductance, whereas application of 0.5 mM tolbutamide (a KATP channel blocker) induced a depolarization with a decrease in conductance. Similar results were obtained with cortical neurons. In outside-out patch experiments with cortical neurons, a K+ channel sensitive to these drugs was found. The channel was completely blocked by 0.5 mM tolbutamide and activated by 0.5 mM diazoxide. The single-channel conductance was 65 pS under symmetrical 145 mM K+ conditions and 24 pS in a physiological K+ gradient. In inside-out patch experiments, this channel was demonstrated to be inhibited by an application of 0.2-1 mM ATP to the cytoplasmic surface of the patch membrane. These results indicate that the membranes of rat cortical neurons contain a KATP channel that is quite similar to that found in pancreatic beta cells. It is also suggested that the same or a similar K+ channel may exist in membranes of hippocampal neurons.", 
    "77": "The chiral beta-blocker, sotalol (STL), is marketed as a racemic mixture. Although both STL enantiomers have equal Class III antiarrhythmic activity, beta-blocking activity has been ascribed mainly to the R-enantiomer. The pharmacokinetics of STL enantiomers were studied in young (mean age 32 +/- 3 years), healthy male volunteers after oral administration of 160 mg. Subsequent plasma and urine samples were collected over 24 hours, and STL enantiomer concentrations were determined using a stereospecific high-performance liquid chromatography assay. There were no significant differences between pharmacokinetic parameters of enantiomers. The area under the time-concentration curves (mean +/- standard deviation [SD]) were 6.95 +/- 0.85 and 6.76 +/- 1.2 (mg/L)hour for S- and R-STL, respectively. Maximal plasma concentrations of S- and R-STL were 615 +/- 167 and 619 +/- 164 ng/mL, respectively, which were obtained on average, 3.13 +/- 0.60 hours after dosing. The mean residence time (mean +/- SD) was 13.2 +/- 1.2 and 12.9 +/- 1.8 hours for S- and R-STL, respectively. Respective renal clearance values for S- and R-STL were 8.98 +/- 1.5 and 9.46 +/- 2.3 L/hour, and were approximately 1.5 times greater than creatinine clearance. Renal clearance constituted approximately 76% of the oral clearance. Although stereoselective disposition of STL was absent after racemate administration, these results should not be extrapolated to patients with significantly altered physiology, or to the pharmacokinetics of S-STL after administration of pure-S-STL.", 
    "78": "The present study was undertaken to examine whether the inhibitory effect of diltiazem on the metabolism of propranolol differs from that of cimetidine. Six healthy male volunteers received a single oral dose of 20 mg propranolol with pretreatment with placebo, 60 mg diltiazem, or 400 mg cimetidine three times daily for 4 days. Diltiazem and cimetidine increased the area under the concentration (AUC) of propranolol and its glucuronide. Cimetidine also increased the urinary excretion of propranolol glucuronide. There were no significant differences in the AUC of 4-hydroxypropranolol (4OHPPL) and its conjugates or the urinary excretion of conjugated 4OHPPL. Diltiazem increased the AUC of naphthoxylactic acid (NLA) and the urinary excretion to NLA. After cimetidine pretreatment, there was the trend toward a decrease in the partial metabolic clearance to 4OHPPL and a significant decrease in that of NLA. These results suggest that diltiazem and cimetidine inhibit the oxidation pathways of propranolol in different manners. Cimetidine might inhibit both oxidative pathways to 4OHPPL and NLA, whereas diltiazem might not inhibit the pathway to NLA.", 
    "79": "Topically-administered ophthalmic medication may reach clinically significant serum concentrations, as evidenced by the variety of systemic side effects reported. These drugs may interact with other drugs administered orally and intravenously, increasing the frequency and severity of their side-effects. We report 4 patients examined in the emergency room because of various systemic manifestations, in whom the symptoms could be attributed either to antiglaucomatous eye drops, or to interaction between these eye drops and systemic medication. Considering the high incidence of glaucoma (0.5-2%), physicians should be aware of the systemic side-effects of antiglaucomatous eye drops and of possible interaction between such treatment and systemic medications.", 
    "80": "In 31 patients with normal-pressure glaucoma, retinal blood flow, diameter of the retinal vessels and velocity were measured with 2-point fluorometry and automatic measurement of the diameters before and after administration of 0.5% timolol over 2 weeks. After timolol therapy the tension was significantly decreased (before therapy: 18.26 +/- 2.50; after therapy: 15.61 +/- 2.56 mm Hg, P < or = 0.01). The arterial and venous diameters and blood flow were nearly unchanged, but a slight increase in the arterial and venous velocity was noted. We conclude that timolol does not significantly influence the retinal hemodynamics in patients with normal-pressure glaucoma.", 
    "81": "Liposomes are small lipid vesicles capable of trapping beta-blockers such as carteolol within their bilayer structure, the advantage being improved drug action, prolonged action time, and a reduction in drug concentration. In a prospective, randomized double-blind trial, carteolol 2%, liposomes (frozen and thawed multilamellar vesicles, FAT-MLVs), or carteolol 2% suspended with FAT-MLVs was applied to 25 eyes of 25 patients per group in a single 20 microliters dose. Intraocular pressure was measured for 3 days. A significant reduction in the IOP was observed in the patient groups receiving carteolol and carteolol suspended with liposomes. Moreover, improved action and prolongation of drug action was noted in the carteolol/MLV group as compared to carteolol treatment alone. Hence, carteolol 2% is suitable for reduction of IOP, but a reduction of drug concentration can be achieved by suspension with liposomes, thus reducing the side effects.", 
    "82": "We have investigated colonic drug absorption in man by the caecal instillation of a multi-component solution of atenolol, cimetidine, frusemide, hydrochlorothiazide and salicylic acid.

    "83": "To examine the vasomotor effects of purinergic agonists, experiments were performed in isolated afferent arterioles of rabbit kidneys dissected together with their glomerulus and perfused with a pressure head of 120 cmH2O. Changes in vascular diameter were taken as measure of changes in vasomotor tone. Adenosine caused a dose-dependent and persistent decrease in vascular diameter along the entire afferent arteriole with significant changes being detectable at 10(-8) M. Constrictor effects were more pronounced in the glomerular entrance segment of the arteriole where adenosine caused a progressive diameter reduction with maximum contraction at 10(-4) M. Similar monophasic diameter reductions of the distal afferent arteriole were seen with increasing bath concentrations of 2-chloroadenosine (2-ClAdo), cyclohexyladenosine (CHA), and 5'-(N-ethylcarboxamido)adenosine (NECA). Concentrations to achieve half-maximum responses were 92.5 nM for 2-ClAdo, 39 nM for CHA, and 107 nM for NECA. The A2-receptor agonist N6-[2-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-(2-methylphenyl)ethyl]adenosine had no effect on vessel diameter. Increasing bath concentrations of ATP caused significant diameter reductions in both the proximal and distal parts of the afferent arterioles. Addition of the A1-receptor blocker, 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine, eliminated the effect of ATP in the proximal region of the arteriole, but a significant diameter reduction was still seen in the glomerular entrance segment. The ATP analogue, beta gamma-methylene-ATP, caused a significant diameter reduction in this segment. These results are consistent with an essentially exclusive presence of A1 receptors in the glomerular entrance segment of the afferent arteriole, whereas in more proximal regions A2 receptors appear to also be expressed in low density. These studies also provide functional evidence for the presence of P2x receptors in renal afferent arterioles.", 
    "84": "In the isolated rat pancreas the effect of intrapancreatic non-adrenergic non-cholinergic nerves was examined upon insulin, glucagon and somatostatin release during perturbations of perfusate glucose. Elevation of glucose from 1.6 to 8.3 mmol/l increased insulin and somatostatin secretion and inhibited glucagon release. The first phase of insulin secretion was significantly reduced by the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin to 55% of the controls (p < 0.05). The somatostatin response was attenuated by tetrodotoxin while the change of glucagon remained unaffected. In contrast the combined adrenergic and cholinergic blockade with atropine, phentolamine and propranolol (10(-5) mol/l) did not modify the insulin, glucagon and somatostatin response. When glucose was changed from 8.3 to 1.6 mmol/l, the reduction of insulin and somatostatin release was not modified by tetrodotoxin, but stimulation of glucagon was significantly attenuated by 60-70% (p < 0.03), which was similar to the effect of combined adrenergic and cholinergic blockade. Subsequently, the effect of neural blockade was examined during more physiological perturbations of perfusate glucose levels. When glucose was changed from 3.9 to 7.2 mmol/l, tetrodotoxin also attenuated first phase insulin response by 40% while cholinergic and adrenergic blockade had no effect. The nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-Nitro-L-arginine-methyl-ester (L-NAME) did not alter the glucose-induced insulin response indicating that nitric oxide is not involved in this mechanism. It is concluded that neural non-adrenergic non-cholinergic mechanisms contribute to the first, but not second phase of glucose-induced insulin release. Non-adrenergic non-cholinergic effects do not participate in regulation of glucagon and somatostatin secretion under the conditions employed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "85": "The effect of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol has been investigated in nine patients suffering from isolated (six patients) or prominent (three patients) essential tremor of the head. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study the tremorolytic efficacy of propranolol has been assessed by a quantitative accelerometric method after a single oral dose (120 mg) and following 2 weeks of sustained treatment with two different dosage regimens of the drug (120 and 240 mg daily). As compared with placebo, a significant reduction in tremor magnitude was found following a single oral dose but not on sustained administration of the beta-blocker at either dosage. The results suggest that the efficacy of sustained propranolol on isolated or prominent essential head tremor is less predictable and satisfactory than expected on the basis of the single-dose response, as compared with hand tremor.",

However, neither the number of days spent as an antenatal inpatient, nor the perceived need for induction of delivery or elective caesarean section, nor the gestation age at delivery differed significantly between the two treatment groups. Post-randomisation consideration of early (< or = 32 weeks) and late (> 32 weeks) onset groups showed the placebo treated early-onset group (n = 15) to have more patients with severe hypertension (> 150/110 mmHg) and a greater requirement for additional antihypertensive therapy prior to labour than the group treated with labetalol (n = 16).",

    "94": "The aim of this study was to analyze the relationship between heart rate and QT interval (HR-QT) during exercise in control subjects (Group A) and in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) with effort angina and without previous myocardial infarction (MI) (Group B). The diagnosis of CAD was confirmed by coronarographic examination. The correlation HR-QT was significant (p < 0.001) in both groups on effort and at recovery. The analysis of the regression HR-QT was carried out separately, both on effort in upright position and at rest in supine position, to avoid the influence of posture on QT length. During effort, the regression line showed lower slope and intercept values in Group B (p < 0.001) than those for Group A. A similar behavior was also observed at rest. Thus, at the highest heart rate, where ECG signs of ischemia (ST depression > 1 mm) frequently occurred, a longer QT interval was present in Group B. Moreover, in Group B, the QT interval in the presence of ECG signs of ischemia was significantly longer (p < 0.01) than in Group A at comparable heart rates both on effort and at rest, thereby confirming the result obtained by comparing both regression lines. The same effort protocol was repeated in Group B patients after acute administration of atenolol 100 mg per os. After atenolol administration, the analysis of the regression HR-QT in Group B clearly showed a shorter QT interval than that obtained in washout period during the baseline test at the highest heart rates where the ECG frequently showed signs of ischemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "95": "These effects were examined with and without pretreatment of animals with reserpine and the adrenergic antagonists prazosin (alpha 1), yohimbine (alpha 2) and propranolol (beta). The effects of clonidine on glandular concentrations of norepinephrine and dopamine also were examined. These effects were compared with those of xylazine, a presynaptic alpha 2-adrenergic agonist. A single, high dose of clonidine followed by an overnight fast caused marked increases in calcium content and acinar secretory granules in the submandibular and sublingual glands, similar to those caused by reserpine. However, the calcium content of the parotid gland was not altered by clonidine, although there seemed to be a modest increase in acinar secretory granules. The clonidine-induced increase in submandibular calcium content could not be attributed to any adrenergic receptor activity since it was not blocked by either alpha- or beta-adrenergic antagonists. Unlike reserpine, clonidine did not affect catecholamine concentrations in the parotid and submandibular glands. Pretreatment with reserpine did not significantly alter the clonidine-induced increase in submandibular calcium content. It is likely that the greater accumulation of acinar secretory granules is related to the increased calcium stores of the glands in clonidine- and/or reserpine-treated rats. The large differences in calcium content among the three glands might be attributable, in part, to differences in the calcium-binding capacity of their secretory granules. Possible mechanisms for the clonidine effects on salivary-gland calcium include disturbances in membrane-associated pools or gating mechanisms for calcium, which need further study.", 
    "96": "Immunotherapy is defined as the controlled exposure to known allergens to reduce the severity of the allergic response. Although available since 1910, its exact mechanisms of action is not known but may involve an increase in allergen-specific IgG antibodies, a decrease in IgE synthesis, and alteration in T-lymphocyte activity. Immunotherapy is indicated in patients with proven allergy who have significant symptoms. It may be used together with pharmacologic measures but is relatively contraindicated in patients receiving beta-blocker therapy. Immunotherapy may be continued during pregnancy and should not be initiated in patients with autoimmune diseases or in human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients. Selection of appropriate diagnostic tests is important. Before immunotherapy is considered, there are two recommended in vivo tests (combined prick and intradermal skin test, and skin end point titration) and two recommended in vitro tests (radioallergosorbent test [RAST] and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays [ELISA]), all equally safe and sensitive. After appropriate test interpretation, treatment is initiated with slowly escalating doses of allergen. Effects are often apparent in 3 to 6 months and, after continuation for 3 to 5 years, patients usually achieve lasting benefit.", 
    "97": "Subcutaneous doses of indomethacin (IND) produced mainly antral ulcers in refed rats, almost exclusively corpus erosions in fasted rats, but no antral or corpus mucosal insult in nonfasted rats. In contrast, IND-treatment in nonfasted hamsters caused antral ulcers but minimal corpus erosions. Mild and severe hyperinsulinemia were observed in refed rats and nonfasted hamsters, respectively. The hyperinsulinemia and antral ulcers in the animals were significantly attenuated by a pretreatment (80 mg/kg, i.v., in rats, 60 mg/kg, i.p., in hamsters) of streptozotocin. Furthermore, the antral ulcers were dose-dependently attenuated by prazosin, an adrenergic alpha-1 antagonist, and yohimbine, an adrenergic alpha-2 antagonist, but not by propranolol, an adrenergic beta antagonist. The large doses of atropine (3.2-10 mg/kg, p.o.) also attenuated the ulcers. The histamine H2 receptor antagonist, famotidine (1-10 mg/kg, p.o.), significantly attenuated the antral ulcers in nonfasted hamsters, but not in refed rats. The latter two drugs exhibited greater inhibition of the corpus erosions in fasted rats compared with the antral ulcers in refed rats and nonfasted hamsters. The corpus erosions were more extensive after streptozotocin treatment (80 mg/kg, i.v.) and were aggravated significantly by yohimbine, whereas they were hardly affected by prazosin or propranolol. It is thus concluded that hyperinsulinemia and adrenergic activation are commonly involved in the etiology of the IND-induced antral ulcers in refed rats and nonfasted hamsters. Vagal activity, which plays a crucial role in the etiology of the corpus erosions in fasted rats, may play a part in the antral ulcer formation in nonfasted hamsters, but not in refed rats.", 
    "98": "1. In order to determine the relevance of adenosine (Ado) receptor classification obtained from in vitro methods to the cardiovascular actions of Ado agonists in vivo, the cardiovascular effects of adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP), N6-cyclohexyladenosine (CHA, 400 fold A1-selective), 5'-N-ethyl-carboxamidoadenosine (NECA, A1 approximately A2) and 2-phenylaminoadenosine (PAA, 5 fold A2-selective) were compared in open-chest, fentanyl-pentobarbitone anaesthetized dogs. 2. Graded doses of CHA (10 to 1000 micrograms kg-1), NECA (0.5 to 100 micrograms kg-1) or PAA (0.1 to 20 micrograms kg-1) were administered intravenously and changes in haemodynamics and myocardial contractility were assessed 10 min following each dose. The effects of graded infusions of AMP (200 to 1000 micrograms kg-1 min-1) were also evaluated. 3. AMP and each of the Ado analogues (NECA > PAA > CHA) increased the systemic vascular conductance index (SVCI) in a dose-dependent manner and reduced mean arterial pressure (MAP). At doses causing similar increases in SVCI, these agonists caused (i) similar reflex increases in heart rate (HR) and cardiac index (CI) and decreases in AV conduction interval (AVi) and (ii) similar increases in coronary vascular conductance (CVC). 4. After cardiac autonomic blockade with atropine (0.2 mg kg-1) and propranolol (1 mg kg-1), AMP, CHA and PAA still increased SVCI and CVC and decreased MAP. CHA and PAA had no marked effects on HR, CI or AVi. As in the absence of cardiac autonomic blockade, equieffective vasodilator doses of CHA and PAA had identical effects on CVC, CI and AVi. 5.Myocardial contractility, as assessed by E,,,,, measurements, was stimulated by AMP in control animals. Following cardiac autonomic blockade, PAA increased contractility while AMP and CHA had no significant effects.6. Despite marked.differences in receptor selectivity in vitro, no marked differences between the actions of these Al- and A2-selective Ado receptor agonists on the cardiovascular system in vivo were apparent.Difficulties therefore exist in the application of in vitro Ado receptor selectivity data to the prediction of the cardiovascular effects of Ado agonists in vivo.", 
    "99": "The effect of hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg, amiloride 5 mg (HCTZ-A) (Moduretic; MSD) and its combination with pindolol and nadolol on renal function were compared in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension (mean untreated supine blood pressure 179 +/- 5.7/108 +/- 2.6 mmHg) with compromised renal function (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 85 ml/min). After randomisation to a beta-blocker plus diuretic, the beta-blocker was washed out (diuretic-only period) and the other beta-blocker added. Eleven patients completed the randomised cross-over comparative study, 5 receiving pindolol 15 mg plus 1 dose of HCTZ-A daily for 6 weeks, and 6 nadolol 120 mg plus 1 dose of HCTZ-A daily. The beta-blocker was then withdrawn for 4 weeks, after which each group of patients received 1 dose of HCTZ-A plus the alternative beta-blocker daily for 6 weeks. The GFR was measured using chromium-51-ethylenediamine-tetra-acetic acid at the end of each treatment phase. The mean GFR (+/- SE) fell from 69.6 +/- 5.8 to 60.6 +/- 5.1 ml/min (P < 0.01) during HCTZ-A therapy, whereas the addition of pindolol or nadolol caused no further drop in the GFR. We conclude that mild degrees of renal impairment in essential hypertension may be aggravated by HCTZ-A therapy when given as one tablet of Moduretic daily.", 
    "100": "A high adrenergic strain during reperfusion after ischemia impedes functional recovery. Conversely, adrenergic blockade may be beneficial during reperfusion. Negative inotropic effects may outweigh the expected benefit, however. Against this background hemodynamic and metabolic effects of early postoperative infusion with the beta 1-selective agent metoprolol were studied in 22 patients after coronary operations. During basal postoperative conditions, intravenous metoprolol reduced cardiac index and stroke volume index compared with control patients, while other variables were unaffected. During the higher adrenergic level of a dopamine infusion (7 micrograms/kg per minute), the heart rate, rate pressure product, and myocardial oxygen uptake were attenuated in proportion to the plasma level of metoprolol. Intravenous beta 1-blockade did not affect the cardiac output or stroke volume responses to dopamine (the cardiac output was still, however, 19% lower than in control patients). A release of myocardial creatinine kinase isoenzyme myocardial band was observed during dopamine infusion, suggesting that myocardial ischemia was induced. The release was not influenced by metoprolol, but it correlated with heart rate (r = 0.60; p < 0.01). It is concluded that infusion of metoprolol early after coronary operations depresses myocardial contractility with some 19%, which was without clinical significance in straightforward patients; the increased myocardial metabolic demand during a period of increased adrenergic stress was attenuated by metoprolol. This may be of importance for myocardial recovery."
