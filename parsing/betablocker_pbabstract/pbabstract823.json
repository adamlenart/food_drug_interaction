    "0": "Some of the effects of dipyridamole, hexobendine and lidoflazine on mechanical responses in rabbit duodenum have been investigated. In concentrations known to inhibit tissue accumulation of adenosine and its metabolites, none of these agents potentiated inhibitory responses to intramural nerve stimulation or to application of adenosine, adenosine triphosphate or phenylephrine. These results neither support nor dispute the suggestion that adenosine or a related nucleotide is the intramural inhibitory transmitter but do show that tissue accumulation in rabbit duodenum is not an important feature in the termination of the action of adenosine.", 
    "1": "1 Some prostaglandins have been found to be capable of affecting respiration in anaesthetized cats.2 Prostaglandins E(1), E(2), F(2alpha), A(1) and A(2) all elicited increases in respiratory frequency when administered to cats anaesthetized with either pentobarbitone or alpha-chloralose. This effect was abolished by bilateral vagotomy.3 Prostaglandins of the E and A series, but not prostaglandin F(2alpha), elicited increases in tidal volume which were accompanied by falls in systemic blood pressure in cats anaesthetized with pentobarbitone. The changes in blood pressure were also obtained in cats anaesthetized with alpha-chloralose, but not the tidal volume changes.4 It is unlikely that the prostaglandins influenced respiration by direct actions on arterial chemoreceptors or baroreceptors.5 Mechanisms by which the prostaglandins may be acting to affect respiration are discussed.", 
    "2": "1 The distribution of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors in isolated preparations of human bladder neck and detrusor muscle has been studied.2 Adrenaline caused contraction of the bladder neck which was blocked by phenoxybenzamine but unaltered by propranolol.3 Isoprenaline caused relaxation of the bladder neck which was blocked by propranolol. High concentrations caused contraction which was enhanced by propranolol but blocked by phenoxybenzamine.4 Detrusor muscle was relaxed by isoprenaline and this effect was blocked by propranolol. Phenylephrine caused relaxation of detrusor which was unaffected by phenoxybenzamine; in some cases contraction was produced in the presence of propranolol.5 It is concluded that the bladder neck contains mainly alpha-receptors and the detrusor mainly beta-receptors but both regions posses both types of adrenoceptor.", 
    "3": "1 The rat stomach strip was used to assay prostaglandin E(2)-like material released by a rabbit isolated kidney perfused with Krebs solution.2 Doses of noradrenaline and angiotensin II producing similar vasoconstrictor effects released equivalent amounts of prostaglandins from the kidney.3 8-Leu-angiotensin II, a specific inhibitor of the natural octapeptide, blocked the action of angiotensin II on perfusion pressure and the release of prostaglandins, while the action of noradrenaline on both parameters was unaffected.4 Indomethacin, a specific inhibitor of prostaglandin biosynthesis, blocked the effects of both vasoconstrictors on prostaglandin release while their action on perfusion pressure was significantly enhanced.5 In the kidney effluent, amounts of prostaglandin E(2)-like material increased linearly with the rise in perfusion pressure induced by increasing doses of angiotensin II. These results indicate that prostaglandin output from the isolated kidney follows the rise in perfusion pressure.", 
    "4": "1 A cannabis extract (I) (in a concentration equivalent to 10 mg Delta(9)-tetrahydro-cannabinol(THC)/kg) prolonged pentobarbitone anaesthesia in mice maximally 20 min to 2 h after medication. The effect was still significant after 8 h, but less than at 2 hours.2 The cannabis extract (I) (equivalent to 10 mg Delta(9)-THC/kg) prolonged both pentobarbitone and ether anaesthesia in mice when administered 20 min before the anaesthetic. After eight consecutive daily doses of cannabis, the pentobarbitone anaesthesia was still significantly longer than a control group, while ether anaesthesia was not significantly prolonged.3 A second cannabis extract (II) with a different ratio of cannabinoids (also administered in dosage equivalent to 10 mg Delta(9)-THC/kg) failed to affect pentobarbitone anaesthesia in mice. This extract presented about 4% the dose of cannabidiol as extract I.4 Delta(8)-THC, Delta(9)-THC and cannabidiol prolonged pentobarbitone anaesthesia with cannabidiol being generally more active than Delta(9)-THC. Cannabinol (10 mg/kg) was inactive.5 The effects of cannabidiol and Delta(9)-THC were found to be additive, and there was a consistent trend for cannabinol to reduce the effectiveness of Delta(9)-THC and cannabidiol when given in combination.6 Premedication with phenoxybenzamine, phentolamine, propranolol, iproniazid, protriptyline, desipramine, reserpine, alpha-methyl tyrosine or parachlorophenylalanine did not affect the extract I-induced prolongation of pentobarbitone anaesthesia.7 It is concluded that cannabis may affect pentobarbitone and ether anaesthesia in mice at least partially by a direct depressant effect, and that the cannabis-induced prolongation of anaesthesia is probably unrelated to any effect on central 5-hydroxytryptamine or catecholamine neurones.", 
    "5": "The effects of phenobarbital treatment for 12 days on the regional distribution of blood flow and on the disposition of two model drugs, antipyrine and d-propranolol, have been determined in six unanesthetized rhesus monkeys. Phenobarbital significantly increased total hepatic blood flow from 179+/-15 to 239+/-27 ml/min. Liver weight was increased to a similar degree (34%) in phenobarbital-treated animals as compared to control monkeys. The clearance of both antipyrine and d-propranolol was increased and the half-life decreased significantly by phenobarbital. Analysis of the data by a perfusion-limited pharmacokinetic model showed that the changes in antipyrine clearance were due almost entirely to enzyme induction. On the other hand, with d-propranolol, the increase in liver blood flow contributed as much to the enhanced clearance as did the stimulation of drug metabolism. The mechanism by which phenobarbital produces the frequently observed increase in drug clearance, therefore, depends upon the initial clearance value of the drug. For low clearance drugs like antipyrine, clearance changes occur largely as a result of enzyme induction. With higher clearance drugs, the effects of increased hepatic blood flow become progressively more important the greater the initial clearance value.", 
    "6": "1 The cerebral ventricles of dogs under intravenous pentobarbitone sodium anaesthesia, were perfused with artificial cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) at a rate of 0.4-0.5 ml/min from the ventricular to the aqueductal cannulae. The effluent was collected from the aqueductal cannula in 20 min samples. The animals' temperatures were recorded from the rectum.2 gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) 0.1-5 mg when injected into the ventricles produced variable temperature effects. Doses of 0.1 and 0.5 mg always produced hyperthermia and 1 and 5 mg doses sometimes produced hyperthermia and sometimes hypothermia.3 Intraventricular perfusion with 2-bromolysergic acid diethylamide (BOL) and hyoscine did not block hyperthermia. Tests on the rat isolated stomach strip or the guinea-pig isolated superfused ileum for the possible release, respectively, of 5-hydroxytryptamine or acetylcholine by GABA were negative.4 When tested for the presence of prostaglandin E(PGE)-like substances on the isolated rat stomach strip, both the control effluent and the GABA effluent showed activity, the latter being much more potent. There was a temporal correlation between this effect and hyperthermia. Intraventricularly administered sodium salicylate converted the GABA-induced hyperthermia to hypothermia and blocked the release of PGE-like substances.5 Hypothermia induced by GABA alone or in the presence of sodium salicylate was associated with the release of noradrenaline into the effluent.6 Intraventricular administration of GABA in reserpinized dogs produced hyperthermia and not hypothermia. Similar results were obtained with phentolamine perfusion in normal dogs.7 Perfusion with calcium-free solution blocked both the noradrenaline-releasing and hypothermic actions of GABA.8 It is concluded that hyperthermia associated with intraventricular injections of GABA is due to the release of PGE-like substance and hypothermia is due to the release of noradrenaline.", 
    "7": "1 (-)-Adrenaline lowered the kininogen content and transitorily elevated the fibrinolytic activity of plasma following intravenous injection into the rat. Its effect on kininogen increased when administered by intravenous infusion.2 Although less effective, (-)-noradrenaline had a similar action to adrenaline; (+/-)-isoprenaline was inactive and failed to inhibit the effect of adrenaline.3 The effect of adrenaline on kininogen could be reproduced in vitro by incubation of whole blood, but not cell-free plasma, with the catecholamine for 5 min at 37 degrees C.4 Propranolol or phenoxybenzamine, as well as heparin or acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), blocked the reduction of rat blood kininogen by adrenaline in vivo and in vitro.", 
    "8": "1 The beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, acebutolol (M & B 17,803), has been compared with propranolol, practolol, lignocaine and quinidine for its ability to revert or prevent various types of experimental arrhythmias.2 By intravenous infusion, acebutolol had one half the potency of propranolol in reverting an established ouabain-induced ventricular arrhythmia in the anaesthetized dog. Practolol was ineffective in the conditions used.3 High oral doses of acebutolol or propranolol significantly increased the arrhythmic dose of ouabain in the conscious rabbit. Similar doses of practolol produced a significant decrease (i.e. potentiation) in the dose of ouabain required to produce arrhythmia. Lignocaine and quinidine showed no or little activity in this test.4 Propranolol, acebutolol and practolol were all effective in decreasing the frequency of ectopic beats induced by adrenaline and methylchloroform in the anaesthetized cat. Lignocaine and quinidine were only weakly effective.5 Acebutolol and propranolol were equally effective either intravenously or orally in reducing the incidence of ventricular fibrillation produced by chloroform in mice.6 It is suggested that the wide spectrum of experimental anti-arrhythmic activity of acebutolol coupled with its cardioselectivity may make it an interesting compound in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias in man."
