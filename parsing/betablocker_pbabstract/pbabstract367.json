In comparison with propafenone the tertiary amines AM 03 and AM 05 showed a higher negative inotropic potency, while the quarternary amines TH 41, AM 07 and AM 09 were less effective. With regard to their negative chronotropic action, AM 03 and AM 05 were more and TH 41, AM 07 and AM 09 less potent than the parent drug. In contrast to propafenone none of its derivatives exerted beta-adrenoceptor blockade at the concentrations studied.",

In the ALF and XYL groups, there was no significant increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP) or HR for any of the measurement periods. MAP was elevated immediately on pin insertion and for up to 2 minutes in the TPL group, and for up to 3 minutes in the ESM group (p < 0.05). HR changes were seen in the TPL group for up to one minute (p < 0.05).

Neither ESM nor TPL prevented the hypertensive response. Local anesthetic injection into the scalp requires coordination between the anesthesiologist and surgeon, it carries the risk of needle stick injury, and it must be repeated if the surgeon repositions the headrest. The rapid onset and short half-life of ALF, coupled with the absence of hemodynamic effects at the dose used, makes this drug an alternative to the use of XYL injection.",

A surprising finding was a high percentage of patients with an inadequately controlled blood pressure before enlistment into the study. During regular check-up examinations already after two weeks a marked reduction or normalization of the blood pressure, was recorded, in the majority of patients. The author assumes that in addition to the effectiveness of the administered drug the marked improvement of the patients is due to better collaboration of the patients and adherence to the prescribed dosage and lifestyle.",

After a brief account of pathophysiological and morphological data in different types of cardiac ischaemia and angina pectoris the author submits algorithms which should be the basis for therapeutic decisions. It is a question of proper timing of invasive examinations leading to revascularization operations in relation to medicamentous treatment. The latter is supplementary treatment before or after revascularization, or is the main approach in case of minimal complaints, in case of contraindicated invasive treatment or in case of an inoperable finding. The author discusses the action, indications, contraindications, undesirable effects, and average dosage of nitrates, beta-blockers, calcium channel inhibitors and antithrombotics. The author mentions also the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. View on treatment will change with advancing knowledge.", 
    "9": "Confluent monolayers of Caco-2 cells, a human colonic carcinoma cell line, have been used extensively to predict intestinal absorption. A direct comparison of uptake characteristics, however, between cell monolayers and human tissue is missing in the literature. We have determined the flux for a series of small organic molecules, peptide and protein therapeutics, across Caco-2 monolayers and normal human colonic and rectal tissue in vitro to assess whether or not a predictive correlation of transport exists. Caco-2 cells were grown to confluency of Snapwells, and human tissue was obtained from patients undergoing surgery for localized tumors. Mucosa-serosa fluxes were measured by HPLC for small molecules and peptides, and proteins were analyzed by ELISA or RIA. Permeability coefficients were calculated from flux data and compared with previously published coefficients where possible. The permeability coefficients for the examined molecules were of a similar magnitude across Caco-2 cell monolayers and human tissues, ranging from 10(-7) to 10(-5) cm/s. A best-fit analysis of a log-log plot of transport measurements obtained in these two systems gave a good correlation (R2 = 0.991). From this limited data set it appears that uptake characteristics for human colon and rectum are similar to those of Caco-2 cell monolayers. Thus, flux measurements across Caco-2 monolayers may be predictive for permeabilities of human colon and rectum for different classes of therapeutics.", 
    "10": "The efficacy of nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS), 60-90 mg o.d., isosorbide dinitrate, 40-60 mg b.d., and isosorbide mononitrate slow-release, 50-100 mg o.d. was assessed in a six week double-blind, parallel-group study in patients with stable angina on chronic beta-blocker treatment. Of 339 patients who entered the study, 229 were eligible for the valid case analysis of efficacy and 335 for the safety analysis. Nifedipine GITS was significantly better than isosorbide dinitrate (P < or = 0.025) in prolonging time to 1 mm ST-segment depression, time to maximum ST-segment depression, time to occurrence of angina and total exercise duration, in addition to reducing the number of angina attacks and glyceryl trinitrate consumption after six weeks therapy. Nifedipine GITS was also significantly better than isosorbide mononitrate (P < or = 0.025) in prolonging time to occurrence of angina and time to 1 mm ST-segment depression after six weeks therapy. The incidence of headache was considerably higher in both the isosorbide dinitrate and isosorbide mononitrate groups (40% and 41%, respectively) than in the nifedipine GITS group (9.5%, P < or = 0.001), and was the main reason for withdrawal from the study (isosorbide dinitrate 18/99, isosorbide mononitrate 17/99, nifedipine GITS 2/95). Peripheral oedema was more common in patients treated with nifedipine GITS (12.5%) compared to nitrates (2% in both groups, P < or = 0.01), but resulted in withdrawal of only one patient (treated with nifedipine GITS). This study suggests that the efficacy and tolerability of nifedipine GITS is superior to long acting nitrates as second-line therapy to beta-blockade in the treatment of chronic stable angina.", 
    "11": "Five cases of spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) are reported, three in women and two in men (mean age 44 years; range 28-65), all of whom suffered a myocardial infarction. Common risk factors for coronary artery disease were present in the two men; in the female group one patient was taking an oral contraceptive, one was in the postpartum period, and the third was a smoker. Only the three women received intravenous alteplase and their ejection fraction was normal; both men had impaired left ventricular function. Two patients had SCAD of the left anterior descending coronary artery and three of the right coronary artery. Only the two men had angiographic features of coronary atherosclerotic involvement. No patients required surgical revascularisation or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. At a mean follow up of 27 months (range 6 to 40) all patients were alive and all but one were asymptomatic.", 
    "12": "Elderly patients have a significantly higher mortality and morbidity compared with younger patients in the postmyocardial infarction period and thus, with the appropriate management have a greater potential for benefit compared with younger patients. It has been shown in the large randomized trials that elderly patients with acute myocardial infarction benefit significantly from administration of beta-blocking agents and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Aspirin and warfarin sodium (Coumadin) have been shown to benefit patients of all age groups. Secondary prevention with cessation of smoking, use of lipid-lowering agents, treatment of hypertension, and estrogen therapy in the postmenopausal woman have been shown to be effective. Elderly patients, therefore, who are free of general noncardiac disability and who can be expected to live meaningful lives should be offered a comprehensive program to reduce their cardiac morbidity and mortality after discharge following acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "13": "Acute myocardial infarction occurs with increasing frequency with advancing age, and older patients with acute MI are at increased risk of a variety of complications including congestive heart failure, arrhythmias and conduction disturbances, myocardial rupture, cardiogenic shock, and death. Older patients thus comprise a high-risk subgroup of the MI population who consequently may derive substantial benefit from appropriately selected therapeutic interventions. At the same time, many interventions are associated with increased risks in the elderly, so that individualization of treatment is essential in all patients. Optimal therapy is thus based on a careful risk-benefit assessment of the available treatment options in conjunction with information on patient preferences and other relevant factors. Though many therapeutic trials of patients with acute MI have either excluded elderly patients or enrolled too few older subjects to permit definitive conclusions, sufficient data are available to make specific recommendations in several areas. As shown in Table 6, therapies of proven value in the acute-phase treatment of elderly patients with MI include aspirin and thrombolysis. Intravenous beta blockers are likely to be of benefit as well, and long-term oral beta blockade after MI is clearly beneficial. ACE inhibitors are of proven value in the long-term management of patients with left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction less than 40%), but initiation of an ACE inhibitor should probably be delayed for 48 to 72 hours in most cases. The role of other agents including nitrates, magnesium, diltiazem, and verapamil requires further clarification, but anti-arrhythmic drugs and dihydropyridine calcium antagonists should generally be avoided in the absence of specific indications for their use. Finally, though the role of catheterization and revascularization in elderly patients with acute MI requires additional study, current data indicate that age alone should not be considered a contraindication to these procedures. As the age of the population continues to rise, the number of older patients at risk of acute MI also increases. Though progressively more sophisticated interventions may ultimately result in sizable reductions in post-MI morbidity and mortality, given the high risk of adverse outcomes in this population the best treatment is prevention. Thus, the greatest potential for the future, as well as the greatest challenge, is to develop more effective strategies for preventing atherosclerosis and for conquering the epidemic of coronary heart disease.",

    "15": "The purpose of this study was to analyze temporal patterns of spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmias in patients (p) with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). By reading out the ICD-data logs 725 arrhythmic episodes (e) from 43 patients were investigated. After grouping the episodes into four defined time periods (period 1: midnight to 6 a.m., period 2: 6 a.m. to noon, period 3: noon to 6 p.m., period 4: 6 p.m. to midnight) according to the data stored by the device, the percentage of episodes per time period has been calculated for each patient who experienced at least 10 arrhythmic events (n = 22). A significant peak occurrence (mean 34%) could been demonstrated for the morning hours (period 2). Analyzing patients individually, 4 subgroups could be identified: group 1 with an episode peak in period 2 (9 p, 277 e, p < 0.01), group with an episode peak in period 3 (4 p, 83 e, p < 0.01), group 3 with a peak occurrence in period 4 (3 p, 110 e, p < 0.01) and group 4 with an equal episode distribution over all four time periods (6 p, 187 e). Comparing sustained and nonsustained tachyarrhythmias, the nonsustained episodes were found to be distributed much more equally, meanwhile the circadian variation for fast (HR > or = 240/min) and slower (HR < 240/min) arrhythmias was identical. Regarding episodes of patients on beta-blocker or class III-antiarrhythmic therapy the same circadian variation has been found. There was no significant difference between the subgroups of patients with an episode peak in period 2 and the other patients concerning age, sex, cardiac disease, left ventricular ejection fraction, clinical arrhythmia, beta-blocker or class III-antiarrhythmics, number of recorded episodes or follow-up time. Further studies are needed to determine a possible correlation between these findings and different circadian variations in individual psychovegetative activity.", 
    "16": "1. Pindolol, cyanopindolol (CYP) and iodocyanopindolol (IodoCYP) have been reported to act either as antagonists, agonists or partial agonists at the beta 3-adrenoceptor in different preparations. A comprehensive investigation has not yet been described with these compounds tested in one tissue from one species. This study was conducted to delineate the pharmacological effects of pindolol, CYP and IodoCYP and to provide data on their affinities at the predominant beta-adrenoceptor in rat ileum. 2. The beta-adrenoceptors present in rat ileum were characterized in the presence of CGP 20712A and ICI 118 551, atropine and corticosterone, with (-)-isoprenaline used as an agonist. The role of the beta 1 and beta 2-adrenoceptors was determined by the omission of either CGP 20712A, ICI 118 551, or both, from the buffers. Conversely, the effectiveness of the beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor blockade was examined by use of the beta 1-adrenoceptor-selective agonist, RO 363 and the beta 2-adrenoceptor-selective agonist, salbutamol. 3. There was no evidence for the presence of functional beta 1-adrenoceptors, and no strong evidence that beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation contributed to the relaxant effects of (-)-isoprenaline. (-)-Phenylephrine did not produce relaxation of the tissue and 5-hydroxytryptamine produced contraction. 4. The beta 3-adrenoceptor-selective agonist, BRL 37344 and (-)-isoprenaline were potent full agonists (pD2 8.35 +/- 0.04 and 7.76 +/- 0.14 respectively), whereas ICI D7114 was less potent (pseudo pD2 6.92 +/- 0.15). These results indicate that the predominant functional beta-adrenoceptors in rat ileum are beta 3-adrenoceptors. 5. Partial agonist effects were produced by CYP (pD2 5.28 +/- 0.26) and IodoCYP (pD2 7.0 +/- 0.26), but not pindolol. All three compounds antagonized the effects of (-)-isoprenaline with pKb values of 6.68 +/- 0.10, 7.59 +/- 0.07 and 7.59 +/- 0.11 for pindolol, CYP and IodoCYP respectively. Likewise, CYP and IodoCYP antagonized the effects of BRL 37344 with pKb values of 7.20 +/- 0.22 and 7.21 +/- 0.14 respectively. This study provides the first functional data on the effects of IodoCYP, the ligand with the highest known affinity for the beta 3-adrenoceptor, at the characterized rat ileum beta 3-adrenoceptor. 6. In conclusion, whereas pKb values suggest that CYP and IodoCYP have a similar affinity for the beta 3-adrenoceptor in rat ileum, the higher potency of IodoCYP suggests that it promotes a greater coupling efficiency, or that its partial agonist effects are produced through a site other than the beta 3-adrenoceptor. The similar pKb values for CYP and IodoCYP at the beta 3-adrenoceptor contrast with their order of known affinities at the beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors, where IodoCYP is far more potent than CYP. This provides evidence of further differences in the characteristics of the beta 3-adrenoceptors compared to the beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors. Finally, the utility of IodoCYP as a beta 3-adrenoceptor antagonist would appear to be limited because of the greater magnitude of partial agonist effects that it produces.", 
    "17": "1. The contraction and intracellular Ca2+ change evoked by diadenosine tetraphosphate (AP4A) were studied in the outer longitudinal muscle of the guinea-pig urinary bladder and compared with those evoked by ATP and alpha, beta-methylene ATP (a P2-purinoceptor agonist). 2. AP4A, ATP and alpha, beta-methylene ATP produced concentration-dependent transient contractions. These contractions were inhibited by PPADS (pyridoralphosphate-6-azophenyl- 2'-4'-disulphonic acid), 0.3- 30 microM, a P2x-purinoceptor antagonist, and suramin, 1-300 microM, a P2-purinoceptor antagonist in a concentration-dependent manner. From Schild plot analysis, the apparent pA2 values for PPADS for contractions evoked by AP4A, ATP and alpha, beta-methylene ATP were 6.86, 6.56, 6.74, and those for suramin were 6.01, 4.59 and 5.12, respectively; the Schild slopes for PPADS were 1.07, 1.14 and 1.06, and, those for suramin 0.75, 1.05 and 1.16, respectively. 3. AP4A (10 microM) and ATP (100 microM) failed to elicit any contraction of the tissue after a desensitization produced by repeated application of alpha, beta-methylene ATP (1 microM). 4. In fluorescence experiments with fura-2, the increases in [Ca2+]i and contraction evoked by AP4A were suppressed by suramin and nifedipine, an L-type Ca2+ channel blocker. 5. These findings suggest that P2x-purinoceptors, which are more sensitive to PPADS than suramin, exist on the outer longitudinal muscles of guinea-pig urinary bladder, and that the AP4A-evoked contraction results from Ca2+ influx.", 
    "18": "1. The aim of the present experiment was to characterize nicotine-evoked [3H]-noradrenaline ([3H]-NA) release from rat superfused hippocampal synaptosomes, using striatal [3H]-dopamine release for comparison. 2. (-)-Nicotine, cytisine, DMPP and acetylcholine (ACh) (with esterase inhibitor and muscarinic receptor blocker) increased NA release in a concentration-dependent manner (EC50 6.5 microM, 8.2 microM, 9.3 microM, and 27 microM, respectively) with similar efficacy. 3. Nicotine released striatal dopamine more potently than hippocampal NA (EC50 0.16 microM vs. 6.5 microM). (+)-Anatoxin-a also increased dopamine more potently than NA (EC50 0.05 microM vs. 0.39 microM), and maximal effects were similar to those of nicotine. Isoarecolone (10-320 microM) released dopamine more effectively than NA but a maximal effect was not reached. (-)-Lobeline (10-320 microM) evoked dopamine release, but the effect was large and delayed with respect to nicotine; NA release was not increased but rather depressed at high concentrations of lobeline. High K+ (10 mM) released and NA to similar extents. 4. Addition of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) reuptake blocker, citalopram (1 microM) to hippocampal synaptosomes affected neither basal NA release nor nicotine-evoked release. 5. The nicotinic antagonist, mecamylamine (10 microM), virtually abolished NA and dopamine release evoked by high concentrations of nicotine, ACh, cytisine, isoarecolone, and anatoxin-a. Although NA release evoked by DMPP (100 microM) was entirely mecamylamine-sensitive, DMPP-evoked dopamine release was only partially blocked. Dopamine release evoked by lobeline (320 microM) was completely mecamylamine-insensitive. 6. The nicotinic antagonists dihydro-beta-erythroidine and methyllycaconitine inhibited nicotine-evoked dopamine release approximately 30 fold more potently than NA release. In contrast, the antagonist chlorisondamine, displayed a reverse sensitivity, whereas trimetaphan and mecamylamine did not preferentially block either response. None of these antagonists, given at a high concentration, significantly altered release evoked by high K+. 7. Blockade of nicotine-evoked transmitter release by methyllycaconitine and dihydro-beta-erythroidine was surmounted by a high concentration of nicotine (100 microM), but blockade by mecamylamine, chlorisondamine, and trimetaphan was insurmountable. 8. Nicotine-evoked NA release was unaffected by tetrodotoxin, whereas veratridine-evoked NA release was virtually abolished. 9. We conclude that presynaptic nicotinic receptors associated with striatal dopamine and hippocampal NA terminals differ pharmacologically. In situ hybridization studies suggest that nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurones express mainly alpha 4, alpha 5, and beta 2 nicotinic cholinoceptor subunits, whereas hippocampal-projecting noradrenaline (NA) neurones express alpha 3, beta 2 and beta 4 subunits. Pharmacological comparisons of recombinant receptors suggest that release of hippocampal NA may be modulated by receptors containing alpha 3 and beta 4 subunits.", 
    "19": "1. Respiratory and cardiovascular failure are principle toxic effects of beta-blocker overdose. Respiratory arrest is the primary cause of death in beta-blocker intoxicated rats. 2. The effect of beta-adrenoceptor agonists on respiratory and cardiovascular failure in beta-blocker overdose was investigated in a model of acute d,l-propranolol (30 mg kg-1 h-1) intoxication in spontaneously breathing rats. 3. Neither the aselective, hydrophilic beta-agonist isoprenaline (10, 25, 50 micrograms kg-1 min-1), nor the beta 1-selective, lipophilic beta-agonist flerobuterol (1, 3, 10 microgram kg-1 min-1) and the beta 2-selective, lipophilic beta-agonist clenbuterol (10, 25, 50 micrograms kg-1 min-1) had any beneficial effect on cardiovascular and respiratory variables or survival time in d,l-propranolol intoxicated spontaneously breathing rats. 4. Isoprenaline (10 micrograms kg-1 min-1) had no favourable effect on haemodynamic and respiratory variables in artificially ventilated d,l-propranolol intoxicated rats either. 5. Addition of dopamine to isoprenaline resulted in a significant reduction of survival time, primarily caused by a decreased in mean arterial blood pressure, in artificially ventilated d,l-propranolol intoxicated rats. Addition of glucagon to isoprenaline did not affect survival time. 6. Artificial ventilation is the most important supportive measure in d,l-propranolol intoxication in the rat.", 
    "20": "Research has suggested a role for insulin delivery through capillaries in muscle in the regulation of insulin sensitivity. Therefore, the formation and turn-over of capillary endothelial cells in muscle were studied in relation to exposure to moderately elevated insulin concentrations with or without concomitant increase of corticosterone concentrations. Female rats were exposed to a moderate, physiological hyperinsulinaemia (approximately 450 pmol/l) for 24 h 48 h, 3 days, 7 days and 7 weeks. Propranolol was used to inhibit elevated adrenergic activity. In one insulin-exposed group, corticosterone secretion was controlled by adrenalectomy with substitution of corticosterone to maintain normal concentrations, while another group was left with adrenal corticosterone secretion intact. Rats were exposed to insulin with controlled, non-elevated corticosterone concentrations after adrenalectomy and corticosterone substitution; compared to controls, the number of mitoses in capillary endothelial cells in the soleus and extensor digitorum longus muscle were approximately doubled after 24 h, reaching a maximum, about fivefold higher than controls, after 3 days. After 7 weeks of insulin exposure there were no longer any significant differences between control and insulin-exposed rats. The number of capillaries per unit muscle surface area was moderately (10-15%) but significantly increased at 7 days (only the extensor digitorum longus muscle) and 7 weeks (the extensor digitorum longus and the soleus muscles). In rats exposed to insulin, with intact adrenals, endogenous corticosterone production resulted in concentrations about threefold higher than in rats adrenalectomized with subsequent corticosterone substitution. In these rats the increase in mitoses in capillary endothelium was totally abolished. The results of this study suggest that exposure to insulin in this rat model is followed by a dramatic short-term increase in the formation of new capillary endothelial cells in muscle. It is also suggested that this growth factor-like effect of insulin is abolished by corticosterone. It is suggested that insulin and corticosterone exert opposite effects on the capillary network in muscles, which might be important for the insulin supply to this tissue, and hence for regulation of insulin sensitivity.", 
    "21": "The surgical therapy for Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome in patients with bronchial asthma was studied. Between 1974 and 1992, 447 patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome were treated, seven of whom had associated severe bronchial asthma. Supraventricular tachyarrhythmias were induced on occasion by bronchodilating agents such as beta-receptor agonists or theophylline preparations. High-dose steroids were required for acute bronchospasm in three patients, despite possibly leading to cardiac dysfunction. Beta-blockers therapy for Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome can induce bronchospasm; in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and bronchial asthma, pharmacological agents used to treat one condition may exacerbate the other. Therefore, a non-pharmacological therapy was performed, namely surgical division of the accessory conduction pathway via an endocardial approach, in all seven asthmatic patients with Wolff-Parkinson- White syndrome. In all cases, division of the accessory conduction pathway resulted in disappearance of the delta wave, and there were no further tachyarrhythmias either at rest or after administration of bronchodilators. Since surgery, bronchial asthma has been effectively controlled with standard drug therapy in all patients. Non-pharmacological therapy is recommended for patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and bronchial asthma.", 
    "22": "This investigation determined 1) the effect of urine acidification on renal clearance (Clrenal), total systemic clearance (Cltotal) and nonrenal clearance (Clnonrenal) of pindolol, 2) whether urine acidification affected the stereoselectivity of pindolol excretion and 3) the pharmacodynamic effects that may result from changes in the activity of the organic base transporter. The Clrenal, Cltotal and Clnonrenal values of pindolol isomers were determined during pindolol administration (10 mg twice daily; control phase) and during pindolol administration (10 mg twice daily) with NH4Cl, a systemic and urinary acidifier, (1.5 g every 6 hr). Eight healthy males (22-33 yr) randomly received this therapy for 3 days on two occasions. On day 4, urine and plasma were collected over 24 hr. R-(+) pindolol Clrenal values during control and NH4Cl were 203 +/- 82 and 480 +/- 248 ml/min, respectively (P = .03). S-(-) pindolol Clrenal values during control and NH4Cl were 279 +/- 81 and 593 +/- 294 ml/min, respectively (P = .005). NH4Cl increased R-(+) pindolol Clrenal by 173% +/- 136% (P = .003) and S-(-) pindolol Clrenal by 127% +/- 105% (P = .03). Stereoselective renal excretion of pindolol was unaffected by NH4Cl; the R(+)/S(-) pindolol Clrenal ratio was unchanged from control to NH4Cl (0.74 +/- 0.23 to 0.81 +/- 0.10, P = NS, respectively). NH4Cl, however, affected pindolol Clnonrenal in a stereoselective fashion; R-(+) pindolol Clnonrenal values increased (641 +/- 241 to 851 +/- 251 ml/min; P = .02), whereas S-(-) pindolol Clnonrenal values remained constant (354 +/- 116 vs. 370 +/- 213 ml/min). Changes in pindolol clearance values resulted in a significant reduction in beta-blocking activity assessed by isoproterenol testing. We conclude that increasing the urine proton gradient can increase the Clrenal value of organic bases by 2-fold in a manner that is not stereoselective. NH4Cl, however, did increase the Clnonrenal value of pindolol in a stereoselective manner. These data, therefore, indicate that the administration of a urine-acidifying agent can greatly enhance the elimination of organic bases and ultimately reduce the pharmacologic activity of the organic base.", 
    "23": "Human melanocytes established in MCDB-153 culture medium do not express alpha 1-, beta 1-, beta-2 adrenoceptors without extracellular stimulation. The addition of 50 x 10-9 M norepinephrine to the medium causes a time-dependent induction of alpha-1-adrenoceptors with 4.278 receptors/melanocyte after 24 h. Under the same experimental conditions, the dendricity of melanocytes as well as melanogenesis was unaffected over 60 h. Since keratinocytes hold the full capacity for catecholamine biosynthesis but melanocytes lack this system, the secretion of catecholamines from keratinocytes appears to be of critical importance to the alpha-1-adrenoceptor in melanocytes, underlining the symbiosis of both cells in the epidermal unit.", 
    "24": "Dynamic right ventricular outflow tract obstruction (RVOTO) has been reported following lung transplantation for pulmonary hypertension, usually in association with the use of inotropic agents. This report describes delayed severe right-sided heart failure associated with right ventricular outflow tract obstruction following sequential bilateral lung transplantation and closure of a ventricular septal defect. The patient had no evidence of outflow tract obstruction in the early posttransplant period but developed progressive right heart failure more than 2 months later. Catheterization revealed dynamic RVOTO and an elevated right ventricular end-diastolic pressure. The patient was treated with metoprolol tartrate and diltiazem hydrochloride with resolution of the outflow tract obstruction and heart failure. This case demonstrates that RVOTO can occur in the late posttransplant period and must be included in the differential diagnosis for patients who develop right-sided heart failure.", 
    "25": "The effect of quinapril or metoprolol on heart rate variability (HRV) indexes was studied in patients who had recovered from acute myocardial infarction. Patients with stable coronary artery disease and normal volunteers were used as controls. Sixty patients with uncomplicated myocardial infarction (aged 32 to 74 years [mean 56.7]) were randomized to quinapril (n = 25), metoprolol (n = 25), and placebo (n = 10). HRV was assessed 5 days (baseline) and 35 days after the onset of acute myocardial infarction. After the baseline studies, the post-myocardial infarction patients were treated with metoprolol (50 to 100 mg/day), quinapril (5 to 10 mg/day), or placebo. Twenty patients with stable coronary artery disease and 20 healthy volunteers, age- and sex-matched to myocardial infarction patients, were used as controls. Compared with placebo, quinapril and metoprolol increased HRV indexes significantly 35 days after the onset of myocardial infarction. HRV indexes were not statistically different between the 2 treatment groups. At baseline and after therapy, HRV was similar in patients with anterior or inferior wall myocardial infarction. HRV 35 days after the onset of myocardial infarction was not different from HRV in patients with stable coronary artery disease, but was decreased when compared with that in normal volunteers. Data suggest that quinapril has the same beneficial effect on HRV indexes as metoprolol in patients who have recovered from uncomplicated acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "26": "Alkyl-PAF induced two components of polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) priming for enhanced fMLP- and rC5a-induced superoxide anion (O2-) production. Component A priming had a shallow, linear alkyl-PAF concentration-response slope (10 pM-1 nM), and component B priming had a significantly steeper concentration-response slope (1-100 nM alkyl-PAF). Whereas the extent of component B priming decayed significantly within 5-10 min after pretreatment of PMNs with alkyl-PAF, component A priming was completely stable. WEB 2086, a specific and potent PAF receptor antagonist, abolished component A priming when PMNs were simultaneously stimulated with alkyl-PAF and either fMLP or rC5a but only partially reduced component B priming. However, whereas WEB 2086 also obliterated component A priming when PMNs were pretreated with alkyl-PAF for 2.5, 5, or 10 min prior to fMLP stimulation, WEB 2086 had little or no inhibitory effect on component B priming. Paradoxically, WEB 2086 significantly augmented alkyl-PAF-induced component B priming for enhanced rC5a-induced PMN O2. production yet concomitantly obliterated component A priming. PMN priming by acyl-PAF (1 nm-1 micron) had characteristics identical to those of alkyl-PAF-induced component A priming. These studies suggest that there are at least two effector pathways modulating alkyl-PAF-induced PMN respiratory burst priming. They are also consistent with the notion that component A priming is initiated via high-affinity PAF receptors and component B priming is mediated through low-affinity PAF receptors; and whereas alkyl-PAF interacts with both high- and low-affinity PAF receptors, both acyl-PAF and WEB 2086 preferentially bind to the high-affinity PAF receptors.", 
    "27": "N-[(trans-4-isopropylcyclohexyl)-carbonyl]-D-phenylalanine (A-4166) is a nonsulfonylurea hypoglycemic agent that decreases blood glucose levels in nondiabetic and diabetic animals. In the present study, we attempted to determine the effect of A-4166 on hormone secretion from the in vitro-perfused rat pancreas and to examine the underlying secretory mechanisms. In the presence of basal glucose (3 mmol/L), A-4166 markedly stimulated insulin and somatostatin release in a concentration-dependent manner over 0.03 to 3 mmol/L. A sulfonylurea, tolbutamide, also stimulated insulin and somatostatin release. A-4166 and tolbutamide elevated the level of glucagon release; however, the change lacked a clear concentration-dependent property. A-4166 at 0.3 mmol/L and tolbutamide at 3 mmol/L exhibited maximal stimulation of insulin release to a similar extent, indicating that A-4166 is one log-order more potent than and as effective as tolbutamide. By contrast, A-4166 stimulated somatostatin release to a threefold greater extent than tolbutamide. A-4166 evoked an increase in the cytosolic free-Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in rat pancreatic beta cells. [Ca2+]i and insulin secretory responses to A-4166 were inhibited by nitrendipine (NTD), a blocker of the L-type Ca2+ channel, and by diazoxide (DAZ), an opener of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive K+ channel. Furthermore, A-4166-stimulated somatostatin release was also inhibited by NTD and by DAZ. The results indicate that A-4166 and tolbutamide stimulate the release of insulin and somatostatin, and that A-4166 is much more effective than tolbutamide in releasing somatostatin, a hormone that attenuates hyperglycemia under certain circumstances. It is concluded that A-4166-induced insulin release is mediated by an increase in [Ca2+]i in beta cells. An inhibition of ATP-sensitive K+ channels and a consequent activation of L-type Ca2+ channels appear to play a key role not only in insulin secretion from beta cells, but also in somatostatin secretion from delta cells in response to A-4166.", 
    "28": "Putative nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity was assayed in molluscan CNS through histochemical localization of NADPH-diaphorase and through measurement of L-arginine/L-citrulline conversion. Several hundreds of NADPH-dependent diaphorase-positive neurons stained consistently darkly in the nervous system of the predatory opisthobranch Pleurobranchaea californica, whereas stained neurons were relatively sparse and/or light in the other opisthobranchs (Philine, Aplysia, Tritonia, Flabellina, Cadina, Armina, Coriphella, and Doriopsilla sp.) and cephalopods (Sepia and Rossia sp.). L-Arginine/L-citrulline conversion was beta-NADPH dependent, insensitive to removal of Ca2+, inhibited by the calmodulin blocker trifluoperazine, and inhibited by the competitive NOS inhibitor N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) but not D-NAME. Inhibitors of arginase [L-valine and (+)-S-2-amino-5-iodoacetamidopentanoic acid)] did not affect L-citrulline production in the CNS. NOS activity was largely associated with the particulate fraction and appeared to be a novel, constitutive Ca(2+)-independent isoform. Enzymatic conversion of L-arginine/L-citrulline in Pleurobranchaea and Aplysia CNS was 4.0 and 9.8%, respectively, of that of rat cerebellum, L-Citrulline formation in gill and muscle of Pleurobranchaea was not significant. The localization of relatively high NOS activity in neuron somata in the CNS of Pleurobranchaea is markedly different from the other opisthobranchs, all of which are grazers. Potentially, this is related to the animal's opportunistic predatory lifestyle.", 
    "29": "Plasma levels of endothelin-1 are elevated in patients with chronic heart failure; however, it is unknown whether changes in plasma endothelin-1 levels accurately reflect clinical response to therapy in these patients. To determine this, we measured plasma endothelin-1 in addition to functional, hemodynamic, and other neurohormonal parameters as part of a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the beta-blocker vasodilator carvedilol in patients with moderate to severe chronic heart failure. Patients were assigned (2:1 randomization) to receive carvedilol (25 mg twice daily, n = 10) or placebo (n = 5) for 14 weeks, with evaluations made before and after therapy. Compared to patients receiving placebo, patients receiving carvedilol improved significantly as assessed by the parameters described. These changes were paralleled by significant falls in endothelin-1 with carvedilol (-2.1 + 3.8 pg/ml) in comparison to placebo (2.2 + 3.9 pg/ml; p < 0.05 for between-group differences). Changes in endothelin-1 after treatment in both groups correlated significantly with changes in symptom severity, New York Heart Association class, 6-minute walk distance (r = 0.64 to 0.80; p < 0.05), hemodynamic parameters (ejection fraction, right atrial pressure, pulmonary artery diastolic pressure, pulmonary wedge pressure, right atrial pressure, and stroke volume index; r = 0.54 to 0.86; p < 0.05), and neurohormonal parameters (serum aldosterone and plasma norepinephrine (r = 0.74 to 0.76; p < 0.05). By stepwise regression analysis, change in endothelin-1 was an independent, noninvasive predictor of functional and hemodynamic responses to therapy in these patients. These findings suggest that endothelin-1 accurately reflects functional, hemodynamic, and neurohormonal responses to beta-blocker therapy in patients with congestive heart failure. Measurement of endothelin-1 may therefore be a useful, noninvasive approach to the evaluation of clinical response to drug therapy in these patients.", 
    "30": "This study examined the role played by neurohumoral factors in mediating the effects of beta-blocker therapy for congestive heart failure. Fifteen patients with congestive heart failure underwent beta-blocker therapy. Plasma norepinephrine and alpha-atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations decreased 2 weeks after initiation of beta-blocker therapy. Decrease in plasma norepinephrine level persisted for 6 months. Lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptor density increased 2 weeks after therapy but was not increased 6 months later. Left ventricular ejection fraction was unchanged 2 weeks after therapy, but it increased 6 months after introduction of beta-blockers. Plasma norepinephrine level decreased 2 weeks after the therapy in the responders (increase in ejection fraction > 0.10) but not in the nonresponders. Thus early reduction of neurohumoral factor levels preceded the late improvement of left ventricular contractile function and may therefore be partly responsible for the efficacy of beta-blocker therapy for congestive heart failure.", 
    "31": "Because of its prevalence in the population and its associated underlying diseases and morbidity, atrial fibrillation (AF) is an important and costly health problem. Advancing age, diabetes, heart failure, valvular disease, hypertension, and myocardial infarction predict the occurrence of AF within a population. The management of AF is complex and involves prevention of thromboembolic complications and treatment of arrhythmia-related symptoms. Stroke occurs in 4.5% of untreated patients with AF per year. Independent risk factors for stroke in nonrheumatic patients with AF are advanced age; a history of prior embolism, hypertension, or diabetes; and echocardiographic findings of left atrial enlargement and left ventricular dysfunction. Warfarin decreases stroke by two-thirds and death by one-third; aspirin is only about half as effective overall and is insufficient therapy for those with risk factors for stroke. Options for thromboembolic prophylaxis are use of warfarin for all in whom it is safe or, alternatively, warfarin for those with risk factors and aspirin for those without risk factors. One-half of the patients with AF are 75 years of age or older. The uniform applicability and relative safety of warfarin therapy in this age-group are controversial. Specific therapy for the arrhythmia should be dictated by the need to control symptoms. Symptomatic treatments include rate-control medications and strategies designed to terminate and prevent arrhythmia recurrence. Digoxin, beta-adrenergic blockers, verapamil, and diltiazem slow excessive ventricular rates in patients with AF and may favorably manage comorbid conditions. The efficacy of anti-arrhythmic medications is only 40 to 70% per year in preventing recurrences of AF, and these agents, except amiodarone, may increase the risk of sudden death in patients with certain types of organic heart disease and AF. The use of nonpharmacologic symptomatic therapies such as atrioventricular node modification or ablation with a rate-response pacemaker or surgical intervention is increasing.", 
    "32": "Along with arterial blood pressure reduction, maintenance of the integrity of baroreceptor reflex function contributes to preserving end-organ function in the treatment of hypertensive patients. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of antihypertensive agents (trichlormethiazide, atenolol, nicardipine, and enalapril) on baroreceptor reflex function by comparing early and late starts of treatment. We administered each agent to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) as early-start groups from 10 to 36 weeks of age and as late-start groups from 28 to 36 weeks of age. We evaluated the gain of the reflex control of renal sympathetic nerve activity and heart rate using ramp infusions of phenylephrine and nitroglycerin in untreated SHR at 10, 28, or 36 weeks of age and in treated SHR at 36 weeks of age. In 28- and 36-week-old untreated SHR, the renal sympathetic nerve activity gain was not altered and the heart rate gain was decreased (from -2.3 +/- 0.3 to -1.3 +/- 0.3 and -1.2 +/- 0.3 beats per minute [bm]/mm Hg, P < .05, respectively) compared with 10-week-old SHR. Early and late start of therapy produced arterial pressure reductions (-18 +/- 4 and -12 +/- 5 mm Hg, P < .05, respectively). In the early-start groups, the renal sympathetic nerve activity gain was improved markedly in nicardipine- and enalapril-treated SHR (-4.2 +/- 0.2% and -4.9 +/- 0.2% of control/mm Hg, P < .01, respectively), and the heart rate gain was improved markedly in atenolol- and enalapril-treated SHR (-4.1 +/- 0.2 and -4.4 +/- 0.2 bpm/mm Hg, P < .01, respectively). In the late-start groups, the renal sympathetic nerve activity gain was improved moderately in nicardipine- and enalapril-treated SHR (-3.8 +/- 0.2% and -2.9 +/- 0.2% of control/mm Hg, P < .05, respectively). The heart rate gain was improved slightly only in nicardipine-treated SHR (-1.9 +/- 0.2 bpm/mm Hg, P < .05). These results demonstrate that an early start of antihypertensive treatment improves baroreceptor reflex function markedly compared with a late start of treatment. This supports the hypothesis that a possible critical phase sensitive to intervention with antihypertensive treatment exists during the development of hypertension and indicates that the early start of antihypertensive treatment would be required in clinical practice.",

Late treatment failed to improve mechanical function. Reduction of CK activity occurring in untreated infarcted hearts (6.4 +/- 0.3 vs. 5.1 +/- 0.3 IU/mg protein, p < 0.05, sham vs. myocardial infarction) was prevented by early beta-blocker therapy. The increase in CK isoenzyme BB and MB levels, decrease in mitochondrial CK isoenzyme levels and increase in anaerobic lactate dehydrogenase isoenzyme levels in untreated infarcted hearts did not occur during bisoprolol treatment. The decrease in total creatine levels after myocardial infarction (74.2 +/- 4.9 vs. 54.9 +/- 3.3 nmol/mg protein, p < 0.05, sham vs. myocardial infarction) was prevented by bisoprolol treatment.

The prescribed use of aspirin at discharge was also associated with several specific patterns of care, including the use of cardiac procedures, beta-blocker therapy at discharge, and aspirin during the hospitalization. The prescribed use of aspirin at discharge was associated with a lower mortality rate 6 months after discharge compared with no prescribed aspirin (odds ratio, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.98), even after adjustment for baseline differences in demographic, clinical, and treatment characteristics between the two groups.",

    "55": "The beta-blocking agent oxprenolol is used therapeutically as the racemate. In humans and animals it is metabolized i.a. to ether glucuronide diastereomers. A stereoselective HPLC assay was developed to determine directly, without hydrolysis to their parent enantiomers, the oxprenolol glucuronides in biological samples. The glucuronide standards for this direct assay are prepared by incubation of rabbit liver microsomes with RS-oxprenolol. The glucuronides obtained are purified and concentrated with solid-phase extraction, and their concentration is measured by an indirect method, i.e. HPLC assay of the oxprenolol enantiomers after enzymatic hydrolysis with beta-glucuronidase. The direct assay involves separation by HPLC using a C18-reversed-phase column, with UV detection at 274 nm; nalorphine is used as internal standard. On injection onto the column, without previous hydrolysis, the limit of detection is 20 ng for both glucuronides. The assay is sensitive, accurate and reproducible. The method is suitable for the assay of glucuronides in liver microsomal incubates and plasma.", 
    "56": "The local effect of salbutamol and N6,2'-O-dibutyryl adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (Bt2 cyclic AMP) on the rat pleural inflammation caused by allergen was investigated. Antigen (ovalbumin, 12 micrograms/cavity) intrathoracically administered to immunized rats led to a marked pleural protein extravasation and leukocyte infiltration, as attested by the quantification of protein and enumeration of leukocytes recovered from the pleural cavity. Salbutamol (10-40 micrograms/cavity) and the cell-permeable cyclic AMP analogue, Bt2 cyclic AMP (20-160 micrograms/cavity), injected 1 h and 5 min before the antigen, respectively, inhibited the exudation occurring within 30 min, and neutrophil and eosinophil accumulation occurring 4 and 24 h, respectively. The late eosinophilia was also markedly attenuated by salbutamol administered 10 min post-challenge, when mast cells had already been degranulated. Pretreatment with the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (1 mg/kg, i.v.) failed to modify the inhibitory effect of Bt2 cyclic AMP, but abolished the blockade caused by salbutamol of leukocyte infiltration under conditions where the salbutamol anti-exudatory activity was impaired to about 80%. In another set of experiments, salbutamol (20 and 40 micrograms/cavity) markedly inhibited the exudation caused by histamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) which, though to a lesser extent, was also sensitive to Bt2 cyclic AMP (80 micrograms/cavity). As observed with allergic pleurisy, propranolol impaired the inhibition by salbutamol of histamine- and 5-HT-induced exudation, whereas the Bt2 cyclic AMP inhibition was not affected. We conclude that salbutamol and Bt2 cyclic AMP share the ability to inhibit pleural exudation and leukocyte recruitment caused by allergen in immunized rats, suggesting that the anti-inflammatory effect of salbutamol may be mediated by a cyclic AMP signaling pathway, probably via beta 2-adrenoceptor activation.", 
    "57": "Atrial fibrillation represents a common and challenging arrhythmia. A rational approach to management of the individual case depends on careful assessment of the temporal of the arrhythmia, any associated cardiovascular disease, and any particular features suggesting the advisability or risks of any particular treatment regimen. The nature of an arrhythmia and of individual patient factors change over time, requiring a flexible approach to long-term treatment that may be defined only after months or years. While new treatment options such as catheter ablation techniques and implantable atrial defibrillators are being tested, old therapies (e.g., low-dose amiodarone) are undergoing reappraisal. Increasing recognition of the dangers of antiarrhythmic therapy used to maintain sinus rhythm is focusing attention on nonpharmacologic methods. All patients with persistent atrial fibrillation merit serious consideration for direct current cardioversion before accepting that atrial fibrillation is permanent, and many patients may benefit from more than one attempt to restore and maintain sinus rhythm.", 
    "58": "Epithelial cells are actively involved in inflammation and play a role in inflammatory diseases such as asthma. Numerous proinflammatory genes, expressed in the airway epithelium, are regulated by the transcription factor NF-kappa B. We show that the proinflammatory cytokines, IL-1 beta and TNF alpha, as well as a protein kinase C activator cause NF-kappa B activation in A549 epithelial cells. This observation is consistent with a major role for NF-kappa B in inflammation. We also demonstrate that IL-1 beta costimulation with a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, or a transcription blocker, actinomycin D, results in superinduction of NF-kappa B but not the transcription factors Oct 1, AP-1, and Sp-1. We speculate that this may be due to lack of de novo synthesis of the NF-kappa B inhibitor, I kappa B alpha, and suggest that this phenomena may help explain the widely observed effect of mRNA superinduction of primary response genes in response to translational blockers.",

The IC50 value of bevantolol for LVA-ICa was 4 x 10(-5) M, while bevantolol at 10(-4) M inhibited HVA-ICa by 28.5 +/- 7.7%. The potency of bevantolol in inhibiting both ICa was greater than those of propranolol, labetalol and lidocaine, while the inhibitory action of bevantolol on voltage-activated Na+ current was weakest among them.

The stereotyped forward locomotion was accompanied by a slight decrease in total activity, suppression of rearing behavior and an increased activity in the periphery of the open-field arena. In support of receptor specificity, the effects of 8-OH-DPAT and DOI could be antagonised by pretreatment with the 5-HT1A/B and the 5-HT2A/C receptor antagonists (-)-pindolol (2 mg kg-1 s.c.) and ritanserin (2 mg kg-1 s.c.), respectively.

The HOT trial clarifies how much the diastolic blood pressure should be lowered, and whether a small dose of aspirin has a protective effect when combined with optimal control of blood pressure. These studies should give better guidelines for the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "67": "The effect of alpha 1 adrenoceptor blockade (doxazosin, 4 mg daily) on maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max) and physical endurance capacity in 16 mildly hypertensive, athletic men was investigated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, two-period of 4 weeks, cross-over study. The maximal work load obtained during graded bicycle ergometer exercise and the VO2 max were reduced by 16 +/- 3 W (mean +/- SE) and 3 +/- 1 ml x kg-1 x min-1 on doxazosin (p < 0.001 for both), and the running time on 5000 m track increased by 43 +/- 12 sec (p < 0.05). Thus, alpha 1-blockade moderately reduces VO2 max and physical endurance capacity in mildly hypertensive athletic men. However, lower systolic blood pressure (9 +/- 4 mm Hg, p < 0.05) immediately after running, and unchanged heart rate suggest a safer performance of exercise.", 
    "68": "Neurodegenerative diseases, in which neuronal cell disintegrate, bring about deteriorations in cognitive functions as is evidenced in millions of Alzheimer patients. A major neuropeptide, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), has been shown to be neuroprotective and to play an important role in the acquisition of learning and memory. A potent lipophilic analogue to VIP now has been synthesized, [stearyl-norleucine17]VIP ([St-Nle17]VIP), that exhibited neuroprotection in model systems related to Alzheimer disease. The beta-amyloid peptide is a major component of the cerebral amyloid plaque in Alzheimer disease and has been shown to be neurotoxic. We have found a 70% loss in the number of neurons in rat cerebral cortical cultures treated with the beta-amyloid peptide (amino acids 25-35) in comparison to controls. This cell death was completely prevented by cotreatment with 0.1 pM [St-Nle17]VIP. Furthermore, characteristic deficiencies in Alzheimer disease result from death of cholinergic neurons. Rats treated with a cholinergic blocker (ethylcholine aziridium) have been used as a model for cholinergic deficits. St-Nle-VIP injected intracerebroventricularly or delivered intranasally prevented impairments in spatial learning and memory associated with cholinergic blockade. These studies suggest both an unusual therapeutic strategy for treatment of Alzheimer deficiencies and a means for noninvasive peptide administration to the brain.", 
    "69": "Although certain methods such as retrobulbar blocks are used extensively, improvements in procedure can always be implemented. The use of ultrasound, low concentrations of anesthesia, careful monitoring, and, in the case of risk patients, anesthesia standby are all important considerations to ensure uneventful treatments. Topical anesthesia eliminates needle risk as well as risk of ptosis and bruising. Because it has been demonstrated that bacteria routinely enter the anterior chamber during uncomplicated cataract surgery, certain irrigation solutions are helpful, but still debatable. Postoperatively, diclofenac, flurbiprofen, and timolol have all been proven to be effective in reducing ocular inflammation, reducing incidence of CME, and controlling pressure increase, respectively.", 
    "70": "The effect of nicotine was tested on retrieval 24 h after training on a passive avoidance task. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of nicotine (0.25-1.5 mg/kg) increased the step-down latency in mice dose dependently. Pretreatment with the nicotinic receptor antagonist mecamylamine (0.5-1 mg/kg) decreased, whereas pretreatment with the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390 (R-(+)-8-chloro-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-3-methyl-5-phenyl-1H-3-benzazepine-7-ol maleate) (0.01, 0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg) and the beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist propranolol (10 mg/kg) increased the nicotine response. The dopamine receptor D2 receptor antagonist sulpiride (5-10 mg/kg), the anti-muscarinic agent atropine (2.5-10 mg/kg), the peripheral nicotinic receptor antagonist hexamethonium (0.01-0.5 mg/kg), the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phenoxybenzamine (1 and 10 mg/kg) and the peripheral dopamine D2 receptor antagonist domperidone (5 and 10 mg/kg) did not change the response induced by nicotine. Single administration of the antagonists did not cause response; however, a high dose of domperidone (10 mg/kg) and propranolol alone increased the step-down latencies. It may be concluded that a nicotinic receptor mechanism is involved in the nicotine-induced improvement of memory retrieval.", 
    "71": "Therapy with \u03b2-adrenergic blocking agents has been advocated as a potential useful approach in heart failure. Recent studies suggest that histologic parameters may be helpful in assessing the effectiveness of \u03b2-blocker treatment in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). In order to predict the response to \u03b2-blockers in DCM, fibrous tissue was evaluated at endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) in 45 patients (pts) with a mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 0.28 \u00b1 0.07, who were successively long-term treated with metoprolol (M) (mean dosage 138 \u00b126 mg/die). EMB was performed from left (n = 32) or right (n = 13) ventricle by means of a King's bioptome or the Cordis adaptation of this instrument. Quantification of fibrous tissue was performed at 9 \u00d7 magnification and with a computerized morphometric system. Qualitative evaluation at light microscopy distinguished four types of fibrosis: pericellular, perivascular, focal, and endocardial. Volume fraction of fibrous tissue ranged from 1.3 to 35.5% (mean 12.1 \u00b1 9.3%) and was not significantly correlated with any clinical variable considered. After 24 \u00b1 12 months of treatment, 25 pts were considered improved (group A), whereas the remaining 20 pts were considered not improved (group B), according to criteria based on ejection fraction, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, filling pattern at Doppler-Echocardiography, cardiothoracic ratio, NYHA functional class, and exercise duration at ergometric test. Volume fraction of fibrous tissue did not differ significantly between the two groups (group A = 12.1 \u00b1 9.1%; group B = 11.3 \u00b1 9.6%;p = NS). Dominant pericellular type of fibrosis was equally distributed between the two groups (group A = 9 25 pts, 36%; group B = 10 20 pts, 50%), whereas a perivascular and/or focal replacement fibrosis was more frequent in group A (group A = 10 20 pts, 50%; group B = 2 20 pts, 10%; p = .05, OR 5.55 at univariate analysis). At multivariate analysis mean aortic blood pressure was the only variable discriminating the two groups; the type of fibrosis, although not statistically significant, maintained a high value of odds-ratio (5.23). In conclusion, extent of total fibrosis assessed by EMB may range widely in patients with DCM, is not correlated with the most important clinical variables, and is not predictive of long-term response to \u03b2-blocker treatment. Otherwise, prevalent perivascular and/or focal replacement fibrosis could be associated with a higher probability of improvement after long-term \u03b2-blocker treatment.", 
    "72": "Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that adenosine contributes to asthma. Inhaled adenosine provokes bronchoconstriction in asthmatics, but not in nonasthmatics. This process appears to be mediated by mast cell activation, because it can be blocked by antihistamines and inhibitors of mast cell activation. Inhaled adenosine evokes release of mast cell mediators in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, including histamine, prostaglandin D2, and tryptase, a specific mast cell marker. Also, adenosine potentiates the immunological activation of mast cells in vitro, including rat peritoneal mast cells, mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells, human lung mast cells, and the human mast cell line HMC-1. The receptor subtype that mediates this activation differs between mast cell type, but preliminary evidence suggests that human lung mast cells express A2B receptors. An argument against the contribution of adenosine in asthma has been the \"enprofylline paradox.\" This xanthine (3-(n-propylyl)xanthine) is as effective an antiasthmatic as theophylline (1,3-dimethyl xanthine) but was initially thought not to be an adenosine receptor antagonist. More recent evidence has confirmed that enprofylline blocks A2B receptors with a Ki (7 microM) similar to that of theophylline (13 microM) and well within its therapeutic plasma levels (5-25 microM). This finding, we believe, resolves the enprofylline paradox and supports the hypothesis that adenosine, through A2B receptor activation, contributes to asthma. Preliminary evidence suggests that A2B receptors are indeed present in human lung mast cells. A2B receptors, therefore, may be a potential target for the development of antiasthmatic drugs.", 
    "73": "Cerebral cortical blood flow (CBF) was measured in 6 rabbits during parabolic flight maneuvers (20 s of weightlessness). During the first seconds of weightlessness, CBF increased up to 100% when compared with CBF at 1 G. Since this transient increase (5 s) was not modified when propranolol or pentobarbital was given to the animals, one can hypothesize that it was not related to stress.", 
    "74": "Objective: To define the changing incidence, risk, and therapy of acute myocardial infarction (A311). Data sources: Review of contemporary AMI data from the University of Alberta Hospitals, six other sites of the Clinical Quality Improvement Network (CQIN), and other Canadian and international centers. Data synthesis: Ischemic heart disease is age-related and the Canadian population is rapidly aging. At the University of Alberta Hospitals, the incidence of Q wave AMI (per 100,000 population) in 1985 was 113 and has remained unchanged (NS) since that time (129 in 1994). In contrast, the combined incidence of non.Q-wave AMI and unstable angina has increased markedly, from 74 in 1985 to 226 in 1994 (p < 0.05). The use of proven efficacious therapies for AMI has greatly increased in recent years, with thrombolytic drugs being given to approximately 35;percnt; of all patients by 1993; and beta-blockers and aspirin to 75;percnt; and 98;percnt; of patients, respectively. However, females and patients older than 70 years' despite their greater risk, received significantly less efficacious medication than males and younger AMI patients. The use of calcium antagonists decreased from a peak utilization rate of 60;percnt; for all AMI patients in 1989 to less than 10;percnt; by 1993. In-hospital AMI mortality risk has also decreased in the last several years, particularly among higher risk older patients (35;percnt;, 1987 vs. 19;percnt;,1993). In a population of 3896 consecutive AMI patients, recruited largely in 1992 and 1993 from seven CQIN sites, logistic regression analyses revealed aspirin was associated with the greatest relative risk reduction (61%); beta-blocker and thrombolytic therapy were related to risk reductions of 55;percnt; and 16;percnt;, respectively. Incremental age was the most important factor associated with increased relative risk in AMI, overall and in both sexes; sex was not an independent risk predictor. Qualitatively very similar AMI incidence, risk, and treatment data have also been recently observed in other centers in Canada, the United States, and elsewhere. Conclusions: Although widespread primary or secondary prevention is possibly contributory, the recent static incidence of Q-wave AMI and the marked increase in unstable angina and non-Q-wave AMI are more likely due to enhanced health awareness and diagnosis-seeking behavior in the population at risk. The decline in AMI mortality, at least for high-risk acute care patients, is compatible with a clinically relevant secondary prevention effect. There are still, however, windows of opportunity to further improve AMI outcomes by increasing the utilization of proven efficacious therapy, especially among women and older patients. Another particularly attractive epidemiologic benefit in the immediate future would accrue from the further development and effective use of efficacious therapies directed against unstable angina and n-Q-wave AMI.", 
    "75": "Cocaine, when used as a recreative drug, can induce cardiovascular toxic effects such as acute reduction of left ventricle ejection fraction, which indicates a negative inotropic effect of the drug. The purpose of this study was to clarify the direct negative inotropic effect of cocaine in in vitro conditions. Rat right ventricle strips were incubated in Krebs solution gassed with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 at 37 degrees, and electrically driven with 2 ms square pulses, 17 mA, at 110 systoles/min. Separate experiments were conducted to study cocaine effect at 210 and 310 systoles/min. The contractile force was recorded through a strain-gauge isometric transducer. Cocaine increased contractile force at doses of 0.3-10.0 micrograms/ml, up to 53% over basal contraction. In the presence of 4 x 10(-8) M atenolol, low doses of cocaine did not increase contractile force and at doses between 3.0-10.0 micrograms/ml revealed a depressant activity on heart muscle contractions. Doxazosin (1.0 microM) and yohimbine (0.1 microM) did not modify the positive inotropic effect of cocaine, showing that alpha 1 and alpha 2 adrenergic receptors were not involved in this cocaine ventricle action. Increasing ventricle strip stimulation rate to 210 and 310 systoles/min for 30 seconds, the contractile force was risen by 55% and 95%, respectively. Cocaine at doses 1.0-3.0 micrograms/ml did not modify the physiological increase of contractile force seen upon ventricle rate increase. The mechanism involved in the contractile force increment after ventricle rate increase is a transient rise of cytosolic Ca2+, mainly derived from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and from extracellular fluid. Atenolol (4 x 10(-8) M) exposure of the right ventricle strip intensified the negative inotropic effect of cocaine (3.0-10 micrograms/ml) seen by ventricle stimulation at 210 and 310 systoles/min. The myocardial direct depressant effect of cocaine, in the presence of atenolol, was gradually reversed by extracelular Ca2+ increase at 3.2 and 5.0 mM, respectively. In conclusion, the mechanism of myocardial direct depressant effect of cocaine is related to the beating frequency of the ventricle, which may be associated to interference with the Ca2+ release process from the myocite sarcoplasmic reticulum, and not to calcium entry blockade from extracellular fluid. However, a dpressant effect of cocaine on phase \"0\" of depolarization, related to its local anesthetic properties can not be ruled out.",

    "77": "The effects of D-sotalol on intercellular electrical coupling and ultrastructure under hypoxic conditions were investigated in myocardial samples from eight young (1-2 months) and four older (10-12 months) guinea pigs. A right ventricular muscle strip was kept simultaneously in two divided chambers and superfused with normoxic and/or hypoxic (97% N2+ 3% Co2) Krebs solution. Hypoxia caused shortening of action potential duration (APD) and electrical cell-to-cell uncoupling. If the uncoupling appeared after short-term hypoxia (less than 30 min), administration of 3.10(-7)M of D-sotalol to the hypoxic perfusate led to a recovery of electrical coupling. Transmission electron microscopy revealed moderate reversible ultrastructural alterations of the cardiomyocytes. No apparent changes in intercellular junctions were observed. The recoupling effect of sotalol decreased with the time of hypoxia as the ultrastructural damage progressed. After prolonged hypoxia (more than 30 min), cardiomyocytes were markedly injured, intercellular junctions were severely affected, and gap junctions occurred less frequently. In these cases, administration of D-sotalol caused only transient recoupling. After 1 h of hypoxia, no recoupling was observed. Pretreatment with D-sotalol prevented hypoxia-induced electrical uncoupling and markedly attenuated ultrastructural damage, although shortening of APD still persisted. Our results indicate that the cardioprotective effect of D-sotalol on electrical intercellular coupling is closely associated with sotalol-induced prevention of the ultrastructural damage. Considering previous results, we suggest that this protective effect of D-sotalol may be related to its ability to increase intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate and, thereby, to decrease cytosolic free Ca. These effects can explain the antiarrhythmic and defibrillating properties of D-sotalol.", 
    "78": "The objective of a paper was to assess in the observational study the early determinants of outcome in patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI)) in one province of Poland (Tarnobrzeg Voivodship). The studied group were 1858 hospitalized men and women registered in POL-MONICA Krak\u00f3w study with clinical diagnosis of myocardial infarction or acute coronary heart disease, who fulfilled the criteria for definite or possible myocardial infarction according to The WHO MONICA Project. The main out-come measure was death before the end of 28th day after the onset. Patients with shock were at the highest risk to die-relative risk (RR) = 21.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 12.86-35.83. The other characteristics, which increased risk independently were: left ventricular failure (LVF) (RR = 2.51, 95% CI = 1.54-4.10) and age (RR = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.01-1.05) per one year. Male sex and diabetes were not related to the risk of death. After adjustment to age, sex, shock, LVF and diabetes, lower risk was found in patients treated with antiplatelet agents (RR = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.29-0.59), with beta-blockers (RR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.31-0.75) and with nitrates (RR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.39-0.98), which were used in 66.2%, 33.1% and 97% of events respectively. Higher risk was found in patients treated with diuretics.", 
    "79": "There has been a large amount of progress in the methods of prevention and treatment of ischaemic heart disease (IHD), but the effect of these changes on mortality due to IHD has not been assessed. This paper presents the complex analysis of 10-year trends of incidence, case fatality and mortality due to myocardial infarction (MI) and changes in medical care in the acute phase of MI in residents of one province of Poland-Tarnobrzeg Voivodship, which was the target population of the POL-MONICA Krak\u00f3w Project (over 280,000 men and women at age 25-64 years). In men, the incidence of MI, which was 335/100,000 in 1984, increased in 1986 to 463/1,000,000 and then was stable until 1993 when it felt to 362/100,000. Mortality from MI, which was 149/100,000 in 1984, increased to 212/100,000 in 1986 and then was stable until 1992, before falling to 173/100,000 in 1993. There were large fluctuations in the incidence and mortality from MI in women i.e. from 58/100,000 to 116/100,000 and from 21/100,000 to 55/100,000 respectively. In 1993 the incidence was 82/100,000 and mortality was 32/100,000. After adding sudden deaths and other fatal events attributed to IHD the mortality figures increased over the ten years of observation by an average of 29% in men and by 28% in women. The average total MI case fatality was 47% in men and 40% in women, with 86% of all deaths due to MI occurring out of hospital. Case-fatality of MI managed in hospital was 11% on average.", 
    "80": "A treatment-resistant depressed patient developed bipolar rapid cycling in response to pindolol augmentation of paroxetine, after failing to respond in any fashion to pindolol added to desipramine. The rapid cycling initially faded, but recurred after the pindolol dose was increased (in combination with paroxetine) in an attempt to treat a relapse into depression. Her differential development of rapid cycling with pindolol in combination with the SSRI is in keeping with the theory that pindolol augmentation operates via a serotonergic mechanism.",

Diurnal variation curves of intraocular pressure of both eyes were obtained for a 24-hour period. Peak effects up to -30% of the baseline were observed. A statistically significant residual effect was still detectable 24 h after application. The timolol gel had the same efficacy in lowering intraocular pressure as the commercially available aqueous timolol solution with a five times higher strength.

    "82": "Harman (1-methyl-beta-carboline) has been shown previously to act on the hippocampus of the rat in terms of its evocation of anxiogenic responses and induction of alcohol preference. In the present experiments, the localized perfusion of 200 microM harman in the dorsal hippocampus of freely moving rats increased the levels of serotonin (5-HT) but not 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in cerebral dialysates. The systemic administration of 5.0-20 mg/kg harman also enhanced 5-HT in the perfusates but reduced the levels of 5-HIAA in a dose-dependent manner, probably as a result of the inhibition of the enzyme monoamine oxidase type A (MAO-A). Harman given systemically in doses of 2.5-20 mg/kg induced an intense hypothermia, with a maximum fall produced by the 5.0 mg/kg dose. This fall in body temperature (Tb) induced by 5.0 mg/kg harman was not antagonized by 5.0 mg/kg of (+/-)-pindolol. Further, pretreatment of the rats with parachlorophenylalanine (pCPA) also failed to alter the harman-induced hypothermia. The systemic administration of 10 mg/kg of the MAO-A inhibitor, clorgyline, also lowered Tb significantly. Overall, the present experiments show that harman apparently influences 5-HT systems in the brain by its action in inhibiting MAO-A. This property is likely responsible also for the harman-induced increase of 5-HT in the hippocampus of the rats.",

The drug was given in the morning, afternoon and evening in a dose 40 mg. Control group consisted of 20 patients with essential hypertension stage II on betapressin at a mean daily dose 108.4 +/- 6.25 mg. Pre- and posttreatment hemodynamic parameters were registered at tetrapolar chest rheography. Arterial pressure was measured according to N.S. Korotkov. In the study group the parameters were taken 6 times a day each 4 hours before and after the treatment course. The course lasted for 20 days on the average in both groups.

The hypotensive effect varied with the day hour being the highest in the single administration.", 
    "84": "The inotropic effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) on mammalian heart muscles were investigated. 5-HT (10(-8)-10(-3)M) produced increases in the contractile tension of atrial and ventricular muscles isolated from guinea pigs, Japanese monkeys, and humans, but not in rat heart preparations. The maximum percent increase of contraction was largest in guinea pig ventricular muscles (142.0 percent), followed by monkey atrium (86.3 percent), human atrium (71.7 percent), guinea pig atrium (48.7 percent), and monkey ventricle (30.1 percent). The sensitivity to 5-HT, measured as the negative logarithm of the half-maximal inotropic molar contractions of 5-HT, i.e., -logEC(50), was highest in the human atrium (6.65 +/- 0.20), followed by guinea pig atrium (5.53 +/- 0.36), monkey ventricle (4.83 +/- 0.28), guinea pig ventricle (4.56 +/- 0.11), and monkey atrium (4.46 +/- 0.16). The inotropic effects of 5-HT seen in the atrial and ventricular muscles of guinea pigs were abolished in the presence of the beta-receptor blocker, pindolol (8 mu M), while these effects in human atrial muscles and monkey atrial and ventricular muscles were abolished only in the presence of both pindolol (8 mu M) and of prazosin (1 mu M), an alpha(1)-receptor blocker. 5-HT increased the V(max) of the slow response recorded from guinea pig ventricular muscles exposed to high K+ (27 mM) media, whereas this agent did not alter the calcium current of isolated guinea pig ventricular myocytes devoid of sympathetic nerve terminals. In reserpinized guinea pig hearts, 5-HT exerted no inotropic effect on ventricular muscle, yet it had an inotropic effect in the atrial muscle, although the latter effect was considerably depressed, compared to that seen in non-reserpinized atrial muscles. We conclude that the positive inotropic effects of 5-HT observed in the ventricular muscle of the guinea pig and in the atrial and ventricular muscles of the Japanese monkey can be attributed to the release of noradrenaline from sympathetic nerve terminals (indirect effect). In contrast, in human atrial muscles, the positive inotropic effect of 5-HT was apparently the result of stimulation of a specific membrane receptor for 5-HT (direct effect). In guinea pig atrial muscles, both direct and indirect effects of 5-HT were involved in the positive inotropism. An explanation for the lack of sensitivity of rat atrial and ventricular muscles to 5-HT awaits further studies.",

We compared the IOP lowering effects of 0.05% bromocriptine and 0.25% timolol and determined whether they have an additive effect in lowering IOP in normal volunteers. In a double-blind, randomised, prospective, single-dose study, we measured IOP in 24 ocular normotensive subjects before (baseline) and 2, 4 and 6 hours after topical instillation of the following drugs: timolol and bromocriptine alone (n: 14), timolol+bromocriptine, timolol+placebo, bromocriptine+placebo (n: 10). Both bromocriptine and timolol have a significant IOP lowering effect (p < 0.01) compared with the baseline value during the study period. There were no significant differences in IOP lowering effect between timolol and bromocriptine at 2 and 4 hours (p > 0.05), but timolol was more efficacious than bromocriptine at 6 hours (p < 0.05).

The mechanism underlying the therapeutic efficacy of beta-receptor blockers is most likely due to a reduction of increased endogenous noradrenaline plasma concentrations and their negative effects on physiological and biochemical processes in the myocardial cell. beta-receptor blockers can be divided into several classes. Some of them have additional properties different from beta-receptor blockers. The possible therapeutic value of these additional properties will be discussed.",

It is not quite clear, whether the observed difference in mortality after beta-blockade on top of diuretics, digitalis and ACE-inhibitors is due to some as yet unknown pathophysiological changes. Certainly, beta-blocking agents have an established efficacy in arrhythmia. Irrespective of the acknowledged benefit in survival, one should note, that the risk reduction in mortality by 65% by Carvedilol has to be viewed critically-as the risk reductions in several other large scale trials. If the mortality in the group receiving digitalis, diuretics and ACE-inhibitors was 7.8%, the mortality after addition of Carvedilol was 3.2%. This means a difference of 4.6%. If however, percent from percent is calculated, than the risk reduction amounts to 65%. One can easily understand, why this larger latter, number usually is being published.",

The present paper is directed to summarize the clinical evidence for the therapeutic benefit of beta-blocking agents in post-infarction patients, to characterize subgroups of patients who will benefit most from such a therapeutic intervention and to discuss the present impact of newer beta-blocking agents, such as carvedilol which beside its effects on beta-1 and beta-2 receptors exerts potent vasodilating properties via an alpha-1 receptor blockade.", 
    "98": "The elevated plasma norepinephrine concentrations closely correlate to the poor prognosis in heart failure. Inhibition of myocardial norepinephrine effects on the heart by beta-blocker treatment are reported to improve left ventricular ejection fraction and to a lesser extent exercise tolerance. The mechanisms are a restoration of beta-adrenergic signal transduction, an increase of contractile reserve and a protection from toxic catecholamine effects. Bradycardic effects improve energetic situation of the failing heart and directly reduce neuroendocrine activation (plasma norepinephrine concentrations, renin activity). Randomized studies have shown a good clinical effectiveness with carvedilol, metoprolol, bucindolol, and bisoprolol in combination with cardiac glycosides, diuretics and ACE inhibitors. Improvement of survival has been shown for carvedilol and bisoprolol and possibly for metoprolol in dilated cardiomyopathy. In ischemic cardiomyopathy, carvedilol appears to be effective to improve prognosis. Therapy has to be started at very low concentrations of the beta-blocker and the patients must be followed up closely. The beta-blocker therapy is evidenced on pathophysiological research findings and could prove to be useful as additional component of the standard therapy of heart failure when the issue of improvement of survival is solved by future studies.", 
    "99": "158 patients with essential hypertension received beta-adrenoblockers and were exposed to travelling impulse magnetic field, magnetolaser radiation. The study of platelet-vessel hemostasis and blood rheology revealed a relation of good clinical response and increased exercise tolerance with initial platelet dysfunction and rheological disorders which underwent positive changes in the course of treatment.", 
    "100": "ECG investigations of cardiodynamics were performed in 47 patients subjected to isolated ventricular electrocardiostimulation on obsidan treatment. The drug was given in a single dose or in a course. Cardiodynamic effects were evaluated in 3 groups of patients: with hyperkinetic, eukinetic and hypokinetic circulation (17, 19 and 11 patients, respectively). Cardiohemodynamic effects of obsidan are shown to depend on type of circulation and features of intracardiac hemodynamics (fixed cardiac rhythm, atrioventricular dissociation, pathological ventricular asynchronism, valvular blood regurgitation). This potentiates cardiodepressive effects of obsidan in patients with hypokinetic circulation who experience deterioration of cardiac insufficiency.", 
    "101": "Treatment strategies in patients with life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias (i.e. sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, aborted sudden cardiac death) are changing. Amiodarone and d,l-sotalol, chosen by electrophysiologic study guidance, can be considered as drugs of choice for the pharmacological treatment. Compared to these agents, which both have additional electrophysiologic effects, the new pure class III agents seem to be less effective. With regard to antiarrhythmic efficacy, clinical trials comparing the long-term efficacy of antiarrhythmic agents and the implantable cardioverter/defibrillator are under way. Preliminary results indicate that the implantable cardioverter/defibrillator may provide superior outcome with regard to sudden cardiac death compared to the use of class III agents.", 
    "102": "The CAST studies have shown that class I antiarrhythmic agents cause an increase in mortality in patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmias after myocardial infarction. This led to an increase in the use of class III agents. The most important class III antiarrhythmic substances are amiodarone and sotalol. Since these drugs also have partially serious side-effects and drug interactions, the search for more effective and safer antiarrhythmics focuses on new class III drugs. These include, for instance, dofetilide, ibutilide, sematilide, clofilium, tedisamil and d-sotalol. None of these compounds, however, is yet available for broad clinical use. This is probably due to the fact that these new drugs, too, have various disadvantages, e.g. reverse use dependence and proarrhythmic effects.", 
    "103": "The authors' aim was to develop schemes of hypertension stage I-II treatment in subjects exposed to nervous and emotional stress at their jobs. These patients benefited from ambulatory monotherapy with obsidan or piracetam (improvement in psychic status, mental and muscular performance, in memory and attention). Reserpin worsened the patients' activity, mental performance and cognitive functions. Combination of piracetam plus reserpin promoted positive changes in psychic status, mental performance and amnestic function in stage IB-II hypertension. This combination is thought effective for inpatient treatment of hypertensive subjects exposed to psychoemotional stress.", 
    "104": "Culture of mouse mammary gland cells was treated with beta-agonist isoproterenol to result in dose dependent increase in protein. Propranolol, beta-antagonist, blocked this effect of isoproterenol. According to electron microscopic analysis, application of isoproterenol leads to disappearance of vesicles from apical zones of the secretory cells, and to increase in casein micelles in alveolar lumen. As follows from the obtained data, catecholamines play part in regulation of mammary gland activity, stimulating process (via beta-adrenoreceptors) of protein extraction from secretory cells of the mouse mammary gland.", 
    "105": "Pindolol has been shown to be a partial agonist at 5-HT1A receptors in preclinical studies. It has also been reported to inhibit the effects of other 5-HT1A partial agonists such as ipsapirone and buspirone on hormone secretion and body temperature in man, indicating its antagonist action at 5-HT1A receptors in man. To determine if pindolol has 5-HT1A agonist as well as antagonist effects in man, pindolol, 30 mg, p.o. and placebo, were given single blind in random order to 23 normal men with indwelling venous catheters and its effects on hormone secretion and body temperature noted. Pindolol significantly increased basal plasma cortisol concentrations, whereas it decreased plasma prolactin (PRL) concentrations and body temperature. The increase in plasma cortisol due to pindolol suggests a 5-HT1A agonist action and is consistent with a 5-HT1A partial agonist mechanism in man whereas the PRL effects are consistent with an antagonist action at 5-HT1A receptors. The effects of pindolol on plasma cortisol concentration and body temperature were significantly negatively correlated. Furthermore, these results indicate significant differences in the 5-HT1A-dependent regulation of PRL and the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and body temperature, and suggest that human basal PRL secretion is tonically stimulated by 5-HT1A mechanism whereas the HPA axis and body temperature are not. Since rodent studies suggest differences in 5-HT1A receptor sensitivity between males and females, the results reported here need to be replicated in females. These differences in the effect of pindolol are discussed in terms of receptor reserve theory.", 
    "106": "Somatodendritic and terminal release of serotonin (5-HT) was investigated by simultaneously measuring extracellular concentrations of 5-HT, 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (5-HIAA) and homovanillic acid (HVA) in the dorsal raph\u00e9 and ventral hippocampus in freely moving rats. Perfusion of tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1 microM and 10 microM) into the dorsal raph\u00e9 simultaneously decreased dorsal raph\u00e9 and hippocampal 5-HT release. However, following TTX perfusion into the hippocampus (10 microM), hippocampal 5-HT release was profoundly reduced but dorsal raph\u00e9 5-HT remained unchanged. Systemic injections with 5-HT1A agonist, buspirone (1.0-5.0 mg/kg, i.p.) decreased 5-HT and 5-HIAA and increased HVA concentrations in the dorsal raph\u00e9 and in the hippocampus. The decreases in the raph\u00e9 and hippocampal 5-HT induced by systemic buspirone were antagonized in rats pretreated with 1.0 mM (-) pindolol, locally perfused into the dorsal raph\u00e9. Local dorsal raph\u00e9 perfusion of (-) pindolol alone (0.01-1.0 mM) increased dorsal raph\u00e9 5-HT and concomitantly induced a small increase in hippocampal 5-HT. Buspirone perfusion into the dorsal raph\u00e9 did not change (10 nM, 100 nM), or produced a small increase (1.0 mM) in raph\u00e9 5-HT, without changing hippocampal 5-HT. These data provide evidence that 5-HT release in the dorsal raph\u00e9 is dependent on the opening of fast activated sodium channels and that dorsal raph\u00e9 5-HT1A receptors control somatodendritic and hippocampal 5-HT release", 
    "107": "Recently, a method for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the brain has been developed. Thus, it is possible to explore neurochemical and behavioral effects of TMS in rats. Repeated TMS (9 days) reduced beta-adrenergic receptor binding in cortex, as does electroconvulsive shock (ECS) and other antidepressant treatments. Thus TMS appears to be a potential antidepressive treatment.", 
    "108": "Nebivolol is a selective beta 1-adrenergic receptor blocker possessing an ancillary vasodilating effect. The objective of the present study was to study the haemodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of nebivolol 5 mg once daily in a double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study.", 
    "109": "Fifteen patients, 12 men and 3 women, with essential hypertension were investigated. Blood pressure and peripheral circulation were determined after acute oral nebivolol administration, 5 mg daily, and after 4 weeks treatment.", 
    "110": "The acute effect on blood pressure upon single-dosing was weak and non-significant. After 4 weeks both systolic blood pressure (152 vs 163 mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure (89 vs 97 mmHg) were significantly reduced after nebivolol treatment as compared to placebo. Following the first dose the venous volume was higher on placebo (5.88 ml.100 ml-1 tissue) as compared to active nebivolol treatment (5.17 ml.100 ml-1 tissue), while there were no statistically significant differences with regard to venous plethysmographic findings after 1 month on placebo (5.53 ml.100 ml-1 tissue) or on active treatment (5.97 ml.100 ml-1 tissue). Calculated peripheral resistance did not differ between active treatment (617 units) or placebo (548 units) after the first dose, whereas it was significantly lowered after 4 weeks of nebivolol treatment (483 units) as compared to placebo (593 units).", 
    "111": "Oral nebivolol 5 mg once daily lowered blood pressure and heart rate during steady state compared to placebo. Moreover, venous volume was reduced during acute but not steady-state dosing, while peripheral resistance was unaffected in the acute phase but reduced during steady state. Plasma concentrations of the separate enantiomers plus hydroxylated metabolites after the first and last dose in hypertensive patients were similar to those in healthy subjects.", 
    "112": "Propafenone, encainide and flecainide have been categorized as class Ic antiarrhythmic drugs, since they produce similar clinical electrophysiological effects. However, propafenone has also modes of action that differ substantially from pure class Ic activity. The most distinctive electrophysiological difference from other class Ic antiarrhythmic drugs stems from its structural similarity with other beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. The potency of the beta-adrenoceptor blocking property of propafenone has been estimated to range from 1/20 to 1/50 that of propranolol on a molar basis. Because the plasma concentrations of propafenone during long-term treatment may be up to 50 or more times that of propranolol, the beta-adrenoceptor blocking effect may be clinically relevant. However, although the beta-adrenoceptor blocking effects are readily demonstrable in vitro, clinical data are more inconsistent, because the beta-adrenoceptor blocking action has been reported as being undetectable to significant. During atrial fibrillation, with or without accessory pathways, propafenone exerts effective and prompt control of the ventricular rate in patients who fail to convert to sinus rhythm. However, compared with other class Ic antiarrhythmic drugs, propafenone has not been proved generally better in controlling the ventricular rate.", 
    "113": "The apnea triggered by laryngeal stimulation (LS) is associated with a redistribution of blood flow towards the heart and the brain that depends upon peripheral vasoconstriction. The circulatory component of the response to LS has been shown to be reduced following injection of large dose of beta-adrenergic agonist that more intriguingly blunted the ventilatory response as well. To test whether the reduction of LS-induced apnea could be related to the decreased magnitude of the peripheral vasoconstruction, the effects of the alpha-adrenergic antagonist urapidil on the ventilatory and blood pressure responses to LS were studied in 6 adult rabbits. alpha-Adrenergic blockade reduced both the rise in blood pressure and the magnitude of hypopnea induced by LS. These results suggest that the circulatory component of the laryngeal chemoreflex, i.e. the peripheral vasoconstruction, contributes to the magnitude of the ventilatory depression.", 
    "114": "Chagas' disease presents complex physiopathogenic mechanism, many of them poorly understood, that in our country generally produce cardiac lesions. The acute phase related with the presence of the parasite is usually asymptomatic. This report studies if the amount of T. cruzi that induced acute infection could modify the myocardiopathy evolution. Previous works have shown that Albino Swiss mice inoculated with 45 tripomastigotes (AcL) presented alterations in the cardiac pharmacological response to adrenergic agonist and antagonist studied at 30 days post-infection (p.i). Mice inoculated with 7 x 10(4) parasites/animal showed similar behaviour at 7 days p.i. We studied the involvement of the affinity and density of cardiac beta receptors in both acute groups by binding with 3H/DHA. The AcH group presented less cardiac beta receptors number (p < 0.001), but their affinity was conserved. The AcL model presented significantly less affinity (p < 0.01) but density was not different from non infected animals. beta receptors' affinity of both infected groups were similar, but AcH density was significantly diminished when compared with AcL. These studies demonstrates that the amount of T. cruzi received by the host determines and acelerates the evolution of the chagasic myocardiopathy.", 
    "115": "This study was undertaken to investigate the role of nitric oxide (NO), cyclooxygenase products and bradykinin (Bk) receptors in the Bk evoked responses of canine renal arteries and perfused kidneys. Rings of isolated canine renal arteries were mounted in organ chambers for measurement of isometric force. The isolated canine kidneys were perfused with Krebs-solution (constant flow) and the perfusion pressure was continuously recorded. The influence of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin and the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor N omega-nitro-L-arginin (L-NOARG) on the vasocontractile responses to phenylephrine (PE) were examined in both preparations. Furthermore, the effects of Bk on the tone of canine isolated renal arteries and on the vasopressor responses of isolated buffer-perfused kidneys of dogs were tested in the absence and presence of enzyme inhibitors and the B2 kinin receptor antagonist HOE-140. It was found that indomethacin enhanced the contractile responses of large renal arteries to PE by 77 +/- 10%. In intact artery rings L-NOARG (0.1 mM) caused an additional potentiation of the PE-induced contractions in the presence of indomethacin (from 11.5 +/- 1.2 mN to 21.6 +/- 1.7 mN). However, L-NOARG failed to affect contractile responses to PE in endothelium-denuded rings. Bk produced a concentration-dependent relaxation of the precontracted endothelium-intact renal arteries. The IC50 value for Bk was 11.2 +/- 3.7 nM. The relaxant activity of the peptide in renal artery rings was not affected by indomethacin (3 microM). However, in the presence of L-NOARG a significantly higher concentration (IC50 = 860 +/- 300 nM) of Bk was required to relax renal arteries. The Bk receptor antagonist HOE-140 (10 nM for 40 min) attenuated the relaxant effect of Bk in renal artery rings (from an IC50 of 14.2 +/- 2.5 nM to 216 +/- 37 nM). Indomethacin (3 microM for 20 min) did not significantly alter the arteriolar vasoconstriction (from 45 +/- 4 mm Hg to 48 +/- 5 mm Hg, n = 5) evoked by PE. By contrast, L-NOARG (0.1 mM) potentiated (from 56 +/- 7 mm Hg to 94 +/- 11 mm Hg) the PE-induced vasopressor responses in perfused kidneys. Bk reduced the size of the pressor responses at relatively low concentrations (2-60 nM) but the dose-response curve was flat and the maximum inhibitory effect hardly exceeded 50 percent. Indomethacin (3 microM) did not modify the inhibitory effect of Bk in perfused kidney. In the presence of L-NOARG, Bk depressed the PE induced vasopressor effects with a maximum of 18 +/- 20%. Preincubation of the kidney preparations with the Bk antagonist HOE 140 (10 nM for 40 min) almost completely abolished the inhibitory effect of Bk on the PE induced vasopressor responses. The results suggest that the endothelial NO plays a fundamental role in the relaxant effect of Bk and considerably modulates vascular reactivity to PE in canine renal vasculature. Furthermore, significant difference exists between conduit and resistance vessels of dog's kidney in the effect of indomethacin on the adrenergic contractions."
