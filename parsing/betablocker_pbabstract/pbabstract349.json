Thereafter, the cats were dosed for 5 weeks with L-thyroxine (50 micrograms/kg of body weight, s.c., once daily) to induce hyperthyroidism (serum thyroxine concentration, 217 +/- 17 nmol/L). Blood samples were obtained at appropriate intervals before and during hyperthyroidism and were analyzed for plasma propranolol concentration by use of high-performance liquid chromatography.", 
    "3": "In all cats, a two-compartment model best described the control and hyperthyroid intravenous data. The change in thyroid status from euthyroid to hyperthyroid caused a significant (P < 0.05), but small reduction in propranolol area under the curve (19,932 +/- 7,900 min.micrograms/L vs 15,911 +/- 1,400 min.micrograms/L) after i.v. administration. In contrast, after oral administration during the hyperthyroid state, a twofold increase (P < 0.05) in propranolol area under the curve (105,430 +/- 57,600 min.micrograms/L vs 226,811 +/- 112,000 min.micrograms/L) and peak serum propranolol concentration (651 +/- 247 micrograms/L vs 1191 +/- 590 micrograms/L) were attributed to significant (P < 0.05) increase in propranolol bioavailability caused by increased fractional absorption (57 +/- 28% vs 137 +/- 73%) and decreased total body clearance (58 +/- 27 ml/min/kg vs 30 +/- 19 ml/min/kg). Mean arrival time after oral dosing was significantly lengthened by hyperthyroidism (100 +/- 38 minutes vs 157 +/- 71 minutes).",

    "7": "When compared with eyes treated with timolol drops alone, eyes pretreated with dexamethasone drops showed a significantly greater decrease in ocular pressure (mean +/- SD); the maximal decrease in 12 dexamethasone-treated patients was 3.5 +/- 1.9 mm Hg (15.9% from baseline). Six dexamethasone-treated patients had a response of 4.0 to 6.0 mm Hg, whereas three showed responses < 4 and > 2 mm Hg with three < or = 2 mm Hg.",

    "9": "In the past decade, catheter ablation techniques and implantable devices have revolutionized the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias, junctional arrhythmias, and atrial flutter. For most patients presenting with atrial fibrillation (AF), the treatment available today is similar to that used a century ago, although nonpharmacologic strategies of therapy have begun to emerge for selected cases. There have been important recent advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of AF and its complications, and it may be possible to improve patient management by refinement of the way in which current drugs are used.", 
    "10": "Many episodes of ischemia in daily life are silent occurring during sedentary activities and may be related to mental stress. In 35 patients with stable angina and positive exercise test awaiting bypass surgery, we investigated whether laboratory mental stress tests would trigger ischemia of a comparable severity to that occurring in daily life and attempted to elucidate some of the underlying mechanisms.", 
    "11": "All patients underwent exercise testing, personality assessment, 2-day Holter monitoring, and laboratory mental stress tests while on their usual medications.", 
    "12": "Only four patients (12%) had positive mental stress test (ST depression > or = 0.1 mV). All episodes were silent and usually associated with fast heart rate (> 90 beats/min). In contrast, ambulatory ischemia was common (average duration of 51 min per 24 h), and at least one episode was recorded in 27 patients (77%) including the 4 with positive test. Patients with positive mental stress test had a higher heart rate during testing (124 +/- 24 vs. 86 +/- 16 beats/min, p < 0.01), and a shorter exercise time and time to 1 mm ST depression on cycle ergometry than those with negative mental stress test. None of the four patients were on beta blockers. There was no difference in personality inventory between the two groups. Comparisons between patients with and without positive mental stress test revealed no difference in the duration and frequency of ambulatory ischemia, or in the occurrence of silent ischemia. However, the heart rate at onset of ambulatory ischemia tended to be higher in the patients with positive mental stress test (96 +/- 9 vs. 62 +/- 43, p = 0.07). Further subgroup analysis in patients without beta blockers (4 mental stress test positive and 18 negative) showed similar results.", 
    "13": "Laboratory mental stress test is a weak inducer of ischemia detected by electrocardiographic monitoring in patients with frequent ambulatory ischemia. Wall motion evaluation during mental stress test may improve sensitivity. While larger scale studies may determine its clinical role, the present study illustrated that patients with heightened heart rate response to mental stress were identified in whom beta blockers could be the drug of choice.", 
    "14": "The influence of antidepressant treatments on the expression of c-Fos and NGF-1A, two immediate early gene (IEG) transcription factors, was examined. Administration of electroconvulsive seizures (ECS), tranylcypromine, or imipramine, three different classes of antidepressants, increased the expression of c-Fos mRNA and immunoreactivity in rat frontal cortex, but the magnitude of the increase for each treatment differed and the effect of imipramine was preceded by inhibition of c-Fos expression. Expression of NGF-1A was increased by acute or chronic administration of ECS or tranylcypromine, and by chronic (21 d), but not acute, administration of imipramine. To study the mechanisms underlying these differences, we examined the neurotransmitter receptors that regulate the expression of c-Fos. ECS- and tranylcypromine induction of c-Fos immunoreactivity in frontal cortex was partially inhibited by pretreatment with specific antagonists for alpha 1-adrenergic, beta-adrenergic, and 5-HT2A/2C, but not D2-dopamine receptors. ECS induction of c-Fos was also inhibited by D1-dopamine and NMDA glutamate receptor antagonists, suggesting that the greater induction of c-Fos by ECS results from activation of these, and possibly other, neurotransmitter receptors. In the hippocampus, antagonism of tranylcypromine was similar to that in frontal cortex, except the D1-dopamine receptor antagonist also blocked the c-Fos response. In contrast, antagonism of the ECS response in hippocampus was only blocked by the NMDA receptor antagonist. The results demonstrate that ECS- and tranylcypromine induction of c-Fos is mediated by activation of several different neurotransmitter receptors, but that the exact pharmacological profile is different for each treatment and brain region.", 
    "15": "The beta-adrenergic (cAMP-dependent) regulation of Cl- conductance is defective in cystic fibrosis (CF). The present study explored alternative regulation of anion secretion in CF pancreatic ductal cells (CFPAC-1) by angiotensin II (AII) using the short-circuit current (ISC) technique. An increase in ISC could be induced in CFPAC-1 cells by basolateral or apical application of AII in a concentration-dependent manner (EC50 at 3 microm and 100 nm, respectively). Angiotensin receptor subtypes were identified using specific antagonists, losartan and PD123177, for AT1 and AT2 receptors, respectively. It was found that losartan (1 microm) could completely inhibit the AII-induced ISC, whereas, PD123177 exerted insignificant effect on the ISC, indicating predominant involvement of AT1 receptors. The presence of AT1 receptors in CFPAC-1 cells was also demonstrated by immunohistochemical studies using specific antibodies against AT1 receptors. Confocal microscopic study demonstrated a rise in intracellular Ca2+ upon stimulation by AII indicating a role of intracellular Ca2+ in mediating the AII response. Depletion of intracellular but not extracellular pool of Ca2+ diminished the AII-induced ISC. Treatment of the monolayers with a Cl- channel blocker, DIDS, markedly reduced the ISC, indicating that a large portion of the AII-activated ISC was Cl--dependent. AII-induced ISC was also observed in monolayers whose basolateral membranes had been permeabilized by nystatin, suggesting that the ISC was mediated by apical Cl- channels. Our study indicates an AT1-mediated Ca2+-dependent regulatory mechanism for anion secretion in CF pancreatic duct cells which may be important for the physiology and pathophysiology of the pancreas.", 
    "16": "The PNS was anticipated to be involved in the modulation of immune responses. To study aspects of this neuronal-immune communication, a recently developed tissue slice method was used to study the effects of adrenergic and opioidergic transmitters on interleukin 6 (IL-6) secretion in the spleen. The alpha 2-adrenergic agonist p-aminoclonidine (10(-7) M) inhibited IL-6 secretion (control vs. p-aminoclonidine, 100.0 +/- 4.76 vs. 59.3 +/- 6.6% of control values; p < 0.001). The alpha 1-adrenergic agonist methoxamine (10(-8) M) also inhibited IL-6 secretion (100.0 +/- 4.8 vs. 71.5 +/- 3.8%; p < 0.001). The endogenous opioids beta-endorphin (10(-10) M), methionine-enkephalin (10(-9) M), and leucine-enkephalin (10(-9) M) inhibited IL-6 secretion as well (p = 0.0051, p = 0.0337, and p = 0.0226, respectively). Electrical stimulation of spleen slices inhibited IL-6 secretion (100.0 +/- 4.3 vs. 56.7 +/- 4.6% of control values; p < 0.001). The involvement of alpha-adrenergic and opioidergic molecules in this electrically induced inhibition was shown by the use of antagonists. Electrical inhibition of IL-6 secretion was attenuated by phentolamine (10(-7) M; p = 0.0345), by naloxone (10(-6) M; p = 0.0046), by cyprodime (10(-8) M; p = 0.0014), and by the combination of cyprodime (10(-7) M) plus phentolamine (10(-8) M; p < 0.0001). We conclude from the complementary studies that the inhibition of IL-6 secretion induced by electrical pulses was mostly mediated by alpha-adrenergic and mu-opioidergic endogenous transmitters.", 
    "17": "Glucocorticoids inhibit basal and hormone-induced phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene transcription in adipocytes whereas beta-adrenergic agonists and fibrates are stimulatory. Here we show that dexamethasone inhibits the induction of PEPCK mRNA by isoprenaline or clofibrate in 3T3-F442A adipocytes. RU 38486 antagonizes dexamethasone effect, suggesting the involvement of the glucocorticoid receptor. In H4IIE hepatoma cells, glucocorticoids enhance PEPCK gene transcription through a complex region which encompasses an element, AF1, with a direct repeat 1-type sequence. Mutations in the AF1 sequence abolish binding of nuclear factors from liver and from 3T3-F442A adipocytes. We transiently transfected 3T3-F442A cells with a wild type or an AF1-mutated PEPCK-CAT construct comprising -2100 to +69 base pairs of the promoter fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. With both constructs, CAT activity is decreased by dexamethasone and is increased by isoprenaline or by clofibrate. However, dexamethasone is unable to inhibit clofibrate induction of CAT activity in cells transfected with the AF1-mutated construct whereas it prevents isoprenaline action on both constructs. Hence, although a single hormone can repress stimulations originating from different intracellular routes, sites in the promoter which mediate inhibition of a specific stimulation are distinct.",

    "19": "The Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study (TOMHS) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with minimum participant follow-up of 4 years. It was conducted at 4 hypertension screening and treatment academic centers in the United States. The cohort consisted of 902 men and women with hypertension, aged 45 to 69 years, with diastolic blood pressures less than 100 mm Hg. Informed consent was obtained from each participant after the nature of the procedures had been fully explained. Sustained nutritional-hygienic intervention was administered to all participants to reduce weight, to reduce dietary sodium and alcohol intake, and to increase physical activity. Participants were randomized to take (1) acebutolol (n = 132); (2) amlodipine maleate (n = 131); (3) chlorthalidone (n = 126); (4) doxazosin mesylate (n = 134); (5) enalapril maleate (n = 135); or placebo (n = 234). Changes in 7 QL indexes were assessed based on a 35-item questionnaire: (1) general health; (2) energy or fatigue; (3) mental health; (4) general functioning; (5) satisfaction with physical abilities; (6) social functioning; and (7) social contacts.", 
    "20": "At baseline, higher QL was associated with older age, more physical activity, lower obesity level, male gender, non-African American race, and higher educational level. Improvements in QL were observed in all randomized groups, including the placebo group during follow-up; greater improvements were observed in the acebutolol and chlorthalidone groups and were evident throughout follow-up. The amount of weight loss, increase in physical activity, and level of attained blood pressure control during follow-up were related to greater improvements in QL.", 
    "21": "In patients with stage I hypertension, antihypertensive treatment with any of 5 agents used in TOMHS does not impair QL. The diuretic chlorthali-done and the cardioselective beta-blocker acebutolol appear to improve QL the most. Success with lifestyle changes affecting weight loss and increase in physical activity relate to greater improvements in QL and show that these interventions, in addition to contributing to blood pressure control, have positive effects on the general well-being of the individual.", 
    "22": "The aims of this study were to determine if neural pathways between the duodenum and sphincter of Oddi are intramural, activated by duodenal electrical field stimulation (EFS) in vitro, and contain capsaicin-sensitive primary afferents. The possible involvement of cholinergic (muscarinic and/or nicotinic) and adrenergic receptors in these pathways were also investigated. Duodenal EFS (5-60 Hz, 70 V, 0.5 ms duration, 10 s train) at sites 2 cm oral and 2 cm anal to the sphincter of Oddi-duodenal junction produced frequency-dependent excitatory responses in the sphincter of Oddi, measured by manometry (n = 3). Excitatory responses from duodenal circular muscle were also evident. Tetrodotoxin (1 microM; n = 7) pretreatment abolished both sphincter of Oddi and duodenal responses to duodenal EFS. Crushing the duodenum between the site of stimulation and the sphincter of Oddi-duodenal junction also abolished sphincter of Oddi response. The sphincter of Oddi responses to duodenal EFS at the oral and anal sites were reduced by pretreatment with (i) atropine (100 nM: n = 7) to 19 +/- 6% (P < 0.05) and 22 +/- 8% (P < 0.05) of control respectively. (ii) hexamethonium (100 microM: n = 9) to 10 +/- 2% (P < 0.01) and 6.0 + 2.5% (P < 0.01) of control respectively and (iii) guanethidine (1 microM; n = 6) to 75 +/- 6% (P < 0.05) and 78 +/- 10% (P < 0.05) of control, respectively. Combined pretreatment with phentolamine and propranolol (both 1 microM; n = 7) was without effect, as was capsaicin (1 microM; n = 12) pretreatment. Excitatory intramural pathways between the sphincter of Oddi and the duodenum are primarily cholinergic in nature and contain an adrenergic component. Capsaicin-sensitive primary afferents are not involved.", 
    "23": "Low frequency (LF, approximately 0.1 Hz) spontaneous oscillations of heart period in humans have been attributed to and correlated with the sympathetic efferent control of the heart. However, this interpretation is controversial, because sympathetic blockade does not suppress these oscillations, while parasympathetic blockade strongly affects them. The sympathetic origin of LF of arterial pressure, on the contrary, has been convincingly demonstrated. Four 10 min cycle-by-cycle time series of R-R interval (RR), and systolic (SAP) and diastolic (DAP) arterial pressure were produced by automatic analysis of data obtained with non-invasive methods in 10 healthy humans during supine rest and while standing, both before and after beta 1-selective blockade (atenolol). Time series were analysed by autoregressive transfer function analysis. beta-blockade failed to induce systematic changes on the power of the LF peak of RR, in any condition. The coherence between RR and SAP in the same region remained high (0.77 +/- 0.03) and a constantly negative phase (approximately 50-60 degrees, corresponding to a delay of 1-2 heart beats of RR on SAP) was always seen. beta-blockade decreased the power of the LF peak of SAP, increased the transfer function gain between SAP and RR at LF, and the HF power of RR. We conclude that LF oscillations of RR are not directly generated by the sympathetic drive to the heart but reflect mainly the parasympathetic activity. The results suggest that the LF oscillations of the vagal outflow, and of RR, are generated by the baroreceptor reflex, driven by sympathetically-induced blood pressure LF waves.", 
    "24": "The present study was undertaken in anaesthetized pigs to determine whether distension of the uterus reflexly affects the aortic blood pressure, heart rate, left ventricular inotropic state and the coronary circulation. Experiments were performed in 17 pigs anaesthetized with alpha-chloralose and artificially ventilated. Coronary blood flow was measured with an electromagnetic flowmeter positioned around the origin of the left circumflex coronary artery. The uterus was distended by injecting 20 ml warm Ringer solution into a balloon positioned within the uterus (mean transmural pressure of about 17 mmHg). Distension of the uterus without controlling any haemodynamic variable caused an increase in aortic blood pressure. When this response was prevented, an increase in heart rate was obtained in each animal. When the heart rate and blood pressure responses were prevented, the distension did not cause significant changes in the maximum rate of change of left ventricular pressure, but always caused a decrease in mean coronary blood flow. In five pigs, the increase in heart rate and the decrease in mean coronary blood flow were graded by step increments of distension. In six pigs, the haemodynamic responses to distension of the uterus were not affected by the administration of atropine. In 12 pigs, which included the six given atropine, the increase in heart rate was abolished by the administration of propranolol and the increase in aortic blood pressure and the decrease in mean coronary blood flow were abolished by the subsequent administration of phentolamine. In the remaining five pigs, the haemodynamic responses caused by uterine distension were abolished by the administration of bretylium tosylate. The present study showed that distension of the uterus in anaesthetized pigs primarily caused reflex increases in heart rate and aortic blood pressure and coronary vasoconstriction. These reflex responses were mediated by efferent sympathetic mechanisms.", 
    "25": "The predominance of the evidence from our studies indicates that beta 3-adrenergic-mediated thermogenesis in interscapular BAT is impaired with age. Moreover, upon exposure to cold, beta-adrenergic responsiveness in BAT is restored. However, the exact nature of the beta 3-adrenergic upregulation is unknown. When senescent rats are exposed to cold for as a little as 1 h, the increase in GDP binding is equal to the response in young rats. This indicates that any cold-induced upregulation of the beta-adrenergic signal transduction pathway must respond within this time frame. The senescent rats employed in our studies have been reared throughout their life at or near thermoneutrality. We hypothesize that under such conditions, beta 3-adrenergic signal transduction atrophies with age, whereas the induction pathways for the components of this signal transduction system remain intact. For example, the beta 3-adrenergic stimulation of UCP mRNA in BAT from senescent rats maintained at thermoneutrality is 54% of that of young rats. Upon exposure to the cold, possibly through a combination of enhanced beta 3AR-adenylyl cyclase coupling or enhanced gene expression of components in the signal transduction pathway or both, beta 3-adrenergic responsiveness is restored in the senescent rat.", 
    "26": "Recent developments in the treatment of chronic heart failure have lead to the use of beta blockers to improve ventricular function and symptoms, and to reverse or slow pathologic remodeling of the failing heart. Little practical information exists in the literature on how to initiate this therapy and how to select the proper beta-blocking agent. This editorial examines which beta-blocking agents are best tolerated and why, and describes how best to initiate treatment with these agents.", 
    "27": "A chimeric gene was constructed from the genes coding for the human complement regulatory proteins, membrane cofactor protein (CD46) and decay-accelerating factor (CD55). The recombinant chimeric gene was transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells. The gene product is a soluble, glycosylated, 110-kDa protein named complement activation blocker-2 (CAB-2). This protein possesses both factor I cofactor activity and decay-accelerating activity, and inactivates classical and alternative C3/C5 convertases in vitro. The specific activity of CAB-2 against cell-associated convertases is greater than that of soluble forms of either membrane cofactor protein or decay-accelerating factor or of both factors combined. CAB-2 also blocks the activation of complement in vivo, inhibiting both the Arthus reaction and Forssman shock in guinea pigs. Studies in rats demonstrate CAB-2 to exhibit favorable biphasic pharmacokinetics with a t1/2 alpha of 10 min and a t1/2 beta of 8 h; the beta phase accounts for 93% of the administered dose. CAB-2 may be an effective therapeutic treatment of acute human diseases in which excessive complement activation causes damage to normal tissues.",

    "32": "The aim of the study was to determine whether betaxolol is a neuroprotective agent and can therefore slow down the changes seen in the retina following ischaemia/reperfusion. Ischaemia was induced in one rat eye by raising the intraocular pressure for 45 min. Three days later electroretinograms were recorded from both eyes and the retinas were examined immunohistochemically for the localisation of calretinin and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunoreactivities. The effect of glutamate agonists, hypoxia or experimental ischaemia was examined on the GABA immunoreactivity, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and internal calcium levels ([Ca2+]i) of the isolated rabbit retina, rat cortical cultures and chick retinal cell cultures respectively. Betaxolol was tested to see whether it can attenuate the influence of the glutamate agonists, hypoxia or experimental ischaemia. Ischaemia for 45 min causes a change in the nature of the normal calretinin immunoreactivity, an obliteration of the ChAT immunoreactivity and a drastic reduction in the b-wave of the electroretinogram after 3 days of reperfusion. When betaxolol was injected i.p. into the rats before ischaemia and on the days of reperfusion the changes to the calretinin and ChAT immunoreactivities were reduced and the reduction of the b-wave was prevented. Rabbit retinas incubated in vitro in physiological solution lacking oxygen/glucose or containing the glutamate agonists kainate or NMDA caused a change in the nature of the GABA immunoreactivity. Inclusion of betaxolol partially prevented the changes caused by NMDA and lack of oxygen/glucose. Rat cortical cultures exposed to glutamate or hypoxia/reoxygenation resulted in a release of LDH. The release of the enzyme was almost completely attenuated when betaxolol was included in the culture medium. Kainate increased the [Ca2+]i in chick retinal cultures, as measured with Indo-1. In a medium with sodium, this kainate-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i was significantly reduced by betaxolol. The combined data show that betaxolol is a neuroprotective agent and attenuates the effects on the retina induced by raising the intraocular pressure to simulate an ischaemic insult as may occur in glaucoma.", 
    "33": "PiTX-K alpha, a 35-residue peptide recently isolated from the venom of Pandinus imperator, blocks the rapidly inactivating (A-type) K+ channel(s) in rat brain synaptosomes and the cloned Kv 1.2 potassium channel at very low toxin concentrations (6 nM and 32 pM, respectively) [Rogowski, R. S., Collins, J. H., O'Neil, T. J., Gustafson, T. A., Werkman, T. A., Rogawski, M. A., Tenenholz, T. C., Weber, D. J., & Blaustein, M. P. (1996) Mol. Pharmacol. 50, 1167-1177]. The three-dimensional structure of PiTX-K alpha was determined using NMR spectroscopy in order to understand its selectivity and affinity toward K+ channels. PiTX-K alpha was found to have an alpha-helix from residues 10 to 21 and two beta-strands (betaI, 26-28; betaII, 33-35) connected by a type II beta-turn to form a small antiparallel beta-sheet. Three disulfide bonds, which are conserved in all members of the charybdotoxin family (alpha-K toxins), anchor one face of the alpha-helix to the beta-sheet. The N-terminal portion of PiTX-K alpha has three fewer residues than other alpha-K toxins such as charybdotoxin. Rather than forming a third beta-strand as found for other alpha-K toxins, the N-terminal region of PiTX-K alpha adopts an extended conformation. This structural difference in PiTX-K alpha together with differences in sequence at Pro-10, Tyr-14, and Asn-25 (versus Ser-10, Trp-14, and Arg-25 in CTX) may explain why PiTX-K alpha does not block maxi-K+ channels. Differences in three-dimensional structure between PiTX-K alpha and charybdotoxin are also observed in both the tight turn and the loop that connects the first beta-strand to the alpha-helix. As a result, side chains of two residues (Tyr-23 and Arg-31) are in regions of PiTX-K alpha that probably interact with rapidly inactivating A-type K+ channels. The analogous residues in charybdotoxin are positioned differently on the toxin surface. Thus, the locations of Tyr-23 and Arg-31 side chains in PiTX-K alpha could explain why this toxin blocks A-type channels at much lower concentrations than does charybdotoxin.", 
    "34": "Although topical beta-blockers are generally tolerated, they can produce significant systemic side effects. The systemic side effects of nonselective beta-blockers (eg, timolol, carteolol) are primarily related to the cardiovascular (beta 1-adrenergic) and respiratory (beta 2-adrenergic) systems. Carteolol has intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, which theoretically reduces the risk of adverse effects through beta blockade. It has been reported that topical timolol and carteolol unfavorably alter the lipid profile and that the effects of carteolol are less pronounced than those of timolol. Topical beta-blockers are associated with systemic events, not only acting by themselves, but also interacting with other drugs (eg, quinidine) administered orally or intravenously. To reduce systemic absorption and adverse effects, new preparations of beta-blockers, such as timolol gellan, have been developed. We should always bear in mind the potential systemic effects of topically applied beta-blockers in glaucoma therapy.", 
    "35": "Dorzolamide, a topically active carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, is an effective new glaucoma medication that creates a decrease in intraocular pressure similar to that produced by beta-blockers. When beta-blockers are contraindicated, dorzolamide may be used as a first-line therapy. It has excellent additivity with other topical ocular hypotensive medications, including beta-blockers and pilocarpine. Systemic side effects are minimal, particularly compared with those of oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. However, local side effects, including corneal edema in patients with borderline endothelial function, may occur. Decreased visual acuity and allergic reactions, which occur frequently, may curtail the use of dorzolamide in some patients.",

In rat peritoneal macrophages, the order of potency of the different peptides, as expressed by the IC50 values was: VIP (IC50 = 1.90 +/- 0.16 nM) > [4-Cl-D-Phe6,Leu17]VIP (IC50 = 125.8 +/- 13.2 nM) > [Ac-Tyr1,D-Phe2]GRF-(1-29)-NH2 (IC50 = 354.8 +/- 21.2 nM). In mouse peritoneal macrophages a similar pattern of potency was observed: VIP (IC50 = 1.58 +/- 0.12 nM) > [4-Cl-D-Phe6,Leu17]VIP (IC50 = 110.8 +/- 10.7 nM) > [Ac-Tyr1,D-Phe2]GRF-(1-29)-NH2 (IC50 = 251 +/- 19.2 nM). The behavior as VIP receptor antagonists of both [4-Cl-D-Phe6,Leu17]VIP and [Ac-Tyr1,D-Phe2]GRF-(1-29)-NH2 in rat and mouse peritoneal macrophages was confirmed by: (a) the shift to the right of VIP dose-stimulated cyclic AMP production curves in the presence of the two antagonists; (b) the agreement between the order of efficacy of the two peptides in competition experiments with the corresponding inhibition of cyclic AMP production; (c) the inefficiency of the two antagonists on the stimulation of cyclic AMP production by the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol, which indicates the specificity of the interaction; (d) the synergic effect of VIP on isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic AMP production was completely abolished by [4-Cl-D-Phe6,Leu17]VIP or [Ac-Tyr1,D-Phe2]GRF-(1-29)-NH2, suggesting that both antagonists acted via specific VIP receptors. Moreover, propranolol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, did not affect the VIP-stimulated cyclic AMP production and the antagonist role of [4-Cl-D-Phe6,Leu17]VIP or [Ac-Tyr1,D-Phe2]GRF-(1-29)-NH2; (e) in cross-linking experiments, the intensity of the labeling of the [125I]VIP/receptor complexes was significantly lower with the antagonists than in the control experimental situation in both mouse and rat peritoneal macrophage membranes.",

Norepinephrine-induced activation of MAP kinases was partially inhibited by either an alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocker (prazosin) or a beta-adrenoceptor blocker (propranolol) and was completely abolished by both blockers. Both a beta-adrenoceptor agonist, isoproterenol, and an alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist, phenylephrine, increased the activities of raf-1 kinase and MAP kinases and phenylalanine incorporation into proteins. Furthermore, isoproterenol and phenylephrine synergistically activated these kinases and protein synthesis. Similar synergistic activation of MAP kinases was observed when other protein kinase A-activating agents such as forskolin, dibutyryl cAMP, and isobutyl-methylxanthine were used with a protein kinase C-activating agent at the same time. Chelation of extracellular Ca2+ completely abolished isoproterenol- and phenylephrine-evoked MAP kinase activation.",

Patients were categorized, according to changes in MFVP, into four groups: 61 patients with an irreversible restrictive, 37 with a reversible restrictive, 48 patients with a stable nonrestrictive, and 27 patients with an unstable nonrestrictive MFVP. Fifty patients experienced major cardiac events. Cox analysis revealed that MFVP was a strong predictor of events and that the response to loading manipulations improved its prognostic value. Patients with an irreversible restrictive MFVP had a higher event rate (51%) than patients with a reversible restrictive MFVP (19%). Among patients with a baseline nonrestrictive MFVP, those with a stable nonrestrictive MFVP had the lowest event rate (6%), whereas the event rate was 33% in patients with an unstable nonrestrictive MFVP.",

Arterial blood and venous blood from the upper jejunal segment, were obtained for measurement of glucose content. Glucose uptake was calculated as the product of jejunal blood flow and the difference between arterial and venous glucose levels. Prazosin, (0.2 mg/kg) had no effect on the glucose uptake induced by insulin and glucagon injections and glucose infusion. However, prazosin reduced the glucose uptake by about 50% during adrenaline-induced hyperglycaemia. Pretreatment of the animal with propranolol (0.5 mg/kg) significantly reduced the increased glucose uptake caused by adrenaline, glucagon and glucose hyperglycaemia. Propranolol also reduced by half the negative glucose uptake during insulin-hypoglycaemia. Since both the alpha and beta adrenergic receptor blocking agents did not abolish the induced glucose uptake, it was concluded that the effects of adrenaline, glucagon, glucose and insulin on intestinal glucose uptake are mediated in part by beta adrenergic receptors.",

    "55": "During infection, bacterial products, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and viral products release cytokines from immune cells. These cytokines reach the brain by several routes. Furthermore, cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) are induced in central nervous system neurons by systemic injection of LPS. These cytokines determine the pattern of hypothalamic-pituitary secretion which occurs in infection. IL-2, by stimulation of cholinergic neurons, activates neural nitric oxide synthase (NOS). The nitric oxide (NO) released diffuses into corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-secreting neurons and releases CRH. IL-2 also acts in the pituitary to stimulate adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion. On the other hand, IL-1 alpha blocks the NO-induced release of luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) from neurons, thereby blocking pulsatile luteinizing hormone (LH), but not follicle-stimulating hormone release, and also inhibiting sexual behavior which is induced by LHRH. IL-1 alpha and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) block the response of the LHRH terminals to NO. GM-CSF inhibits LHRH release by acting on its receptors on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurons to stimulate GABA release. GABA acts on GABA-A receptors on the LHRH neuronal terminal to block NOergic stimulation of LHRH release. This concept is supported by a blockade of GM-CSF-induced suppression of LHRH release from medial basal hypothalamic explants by the GABA-A receptor blocker, bicuculline. IL-1 alpha inhibits growth hormone (GH) release by inhibiting GH-releasing hormone release mediated by NO and stimulating somatostatin release, also mediated by NO. IL-1 alpha-induced stimulation of prolactin release is also mediated by intrahypothalamic action of NO which inhibits release of the prolactin-inhibiting hormone, dopamine. The actions of NO are brought about by its combined activation of guanylate cyclase liberating cyclic guanosine monophosphate and activation of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase, with liberation of prostaglandin E2 and leukotrienes, respectively. Thus, NO plays a key role in inducing the changes in the release of hypothalamic peptides induced in infection by cytokines. Cytokines, such as IL-1 beta, also act in the anterior pituitary gland, at least in part, via induction of inducible NOS. The NO produced alters the release of anterior pituitary hormones.", 
    "56": "A beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline potently stimulated cyclic AMP formation in chick cerebral cortical slices. L-Noradrenaline (10-1000 microM) also increased cortical nucleotide synthesis, the effect being antagonized by beta-adrenoceptor blocker propranolol, and not affected by alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor blockers, prazosin and yohimbine, respectively. Clonidine, a selective alpha 2-agonist, had no effect on cerebral cyclic AMP production stimulated by both isoprenaline and forskolin. However, clonidine (0.001-10 microM) concentration-dependently suppressed forskolin-driven cyclic AMP synthesis in intact chick pineal glands. In living chicks clonidine suppressed the nocturnal activity of cyclic AMP-dependent serotonin N-acetyltransferase, a rate-limiting enzyme in melatonin biosynthesis, the effect being prevented by yohimbine. The data suggest that the cyclic AMP generating system of the pineal gland, but not that of cerebral cortex in chick, is negatively regulated by alpha 2-adrenergic receptor-mediated signal.", 
    "57": "Marfan syndrome (MFS), first described 100 years ago, remains a clinical diagnosis. Two out of 3 major systems (ocular, cardiac, skeletal) must be classically affected, to avoid overdiagnosis. Diagnosis may be confirmed by linkage to the dominantly inherited gene MFS-1 on 15q21, or by discovering the family mutation. Either technique may be used for prenatal diagnosis. Modern medical and surgical management is prolonging life, by on average, 13 years, with postoperative 20 year survival rate 65%. Beta-blocker therapy slows aortic root dilatation, and elective surgery is offered at ascending aorta diameter > or = 5 cm. Known associations with early death include new mutation, family history of dissection < 5 cm, male sex, and emergency surgery where the death rate is 5 times higher than in elective surgery. Pregnancy bears a 1% risk of fatal complication, and this risk rises with increasing aortic root diameter. Caesarean section at 38 weeks gestation should be offered if aortic root diameter is greater than 4.5 cm. Gene mapping reveals almost every mutation to be unique, interfering with multimerization of fibrillin monomers, or interactions with other connective tissue elements. Neonatal MFS is caused by mutations in exons 24-32, in calcium-binding EGF-like sequences. Mutations affecting cysteines or amino acids critical for calcium binding in other EGF-like domains, or deletions of complete EGF-like domains, generally lead to classical MFS phenotypes, as do mutations in TGF receptor-like domains. Heterogeneity has been reported with a second locus (MFS-2) on chromosome 3 in one French pedigree.", 
    "58": "NADH dehydrogenase in the plasma membrane transfers electrons from NADH to external oxidants like ferricyanide, through pathways which are linked to metabolic processes in the cell. Hormone binding to specific sites (receptors) can modify the enzyme activity, suggesting a direct or indirect coupling between the redox system and the hormone receptors. Reduction of external ferricyanide to ferrocyanide by human erythrocytes was stimulated by beta-adrenergic agonists (adrenaline, ritodrine and isoxsuprine), this effect being dependent upon concentration and pH. The agonist-stimulatory effect was attenuated in the presence of metoprolol (10(-4) M), a beta-adrenergic antagonist, and was not modified in the presence of prazosin, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, suggesting that modification of the redox activity is mediated by binding of the agonists to beta-adrenergic receptors present in the human erythrocytes. Basal and agonist-dependent activities were inhibited in the presence of sulfhydryl reagents p-chloromercuribenzoate (PCMB, 10(-5) M) and N-ethylmaleimide (NEM, 10(-3) M), indicating the involvement of -SH groups. Inactivation by NEM was reversed by washing the cells with GTP (10(-3) M) and GTP gamma S (10(-4) M), suggesting that the specific alkylated -SH group(s) is located on a G protein in the hormone-receptor-G-protein complex. The human erythrocytes contain G proteins, displaying both guanine-nucleotide-binding properties and GTPase activity. Fluoride (10(-2) M) and fluoroaluminate (AlF4- (F-, 10(-2) M + Al3+, 10(-5) M), G protein activators, enhanced the basal and agonist-dependent activities, suggesting the involvement of G proteins in this system. The overall results indicated that one of the coupling components between the hormonal receptors and the redox system is probably a G protein, and the mechanism of enzyme activation after hormone binding to the receptor is based on the redox state of cysteine residues probably within the receptor-G-protein complex.", 
    "59": "We have previously demonstrated that acute third ventricle injections of both Pb2+ and Cd2+ impair the dipsogenic response elicited by three different situations: dehydration and central cholinergic or angiotensinergic stimulation. beta-Adrenergic activation is part of the multifactorial integrated systems operating in drinking behavior control in the central nervous system. In the present study acute third ventricle injections of Pb2+ (3, 30 and 300 pmol/rat) or Cd2+ (0.3, 3 and 30 pmol/ rat) blocked the dipsogenic response induced by third ventricle injections of isoproterenol (ISO; 160 nmol/rat) in a dose-dependent manner. Normohydrated animals receiving ISO + NaAc (sodium acetate) or saline (controls) displayed a high water intake after 120 min (ISO+saline = 5.78 +/- 0.54 ml/100 g; ISO+NaAc = 6.00 +/- 0.6 ml/100 g). After the same period, animals receiving ISO but pretreated with PbAc at the highest dose employed (300 pmol/rat) drank 0.78 +/- 0.23 ml/100 g while those receiving ISO and pretreated with the highest dose of CdCl2 (30 pmol/rat) presented a water intake of 0.7 +/- 0.30 ml/100 g. Third ventricle injections of CdCl2 (3 nmol/rat) or PbAc (3 nmol/rat) did not modify food intake in rats deprived of food for 24 h. Thus, general central nervous system depression explaining the antidipsogenic action of the metals can be safely excluded. It is concluded that both Pb2+ and Cd2+ inhibit water intake induced by central beta-adrenergic stimulation.", 
    "60": "The atypical excitatory effect of acetylcholine on cardiac ventricular muscle was investigated in the horned shark, Heterodontus portusjacksoni. Electrically paced ventricular strips produced a massive 391.45% (+/-26.39%) increase in basal force of contraction in response to exogenously applied acetylcholine. The response was similar in nature to that produced by applied adrenaline, which caused a 382.52% (+/-72.47%) increase. The response to acetylcholine was blocked by the muscarinic cholinoceptor antagonist atropine and the competitive beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol and was reduced by bretylium, an agent known to inhibit the release of catecholamines from adrenergic nerves. These findings strongly suggest that acetylcholine mediates a localised release of a catecholamine via muscarinic cholinoceptors in shark heart. A cholinergically controlled catecholamine store has been proposed (cholinergic-adreno complex), implying that elasmobranchs may be capable of finer control of cardiac output than has previously been suspected. This complex may represent a transitional adrenergic state between humoral and neuronal regulation. The spontaneously beating atrium showed no evidence of such an excitatory response to applied acetylcholine but produced an atropine-sensitive slowing, a response typical of other vertebrates.", 
    "61": "Pindolol, a beta-adrenergic and presynaptic 5-HT1 vA antagonist, when added to specific serotonin reuptake inhibitors, potentiates the antidepressant action, leading to an earlier onset of effect. Following on from the suggestion that nefazodone, a specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor and antagonist of 5-HT2, improves 5-HT1A-mediated transmission, we used a pindolol and nefazodone combination treatment for major depressive disorder. Twenty outpatients underwent a 4-week trial. Patients were seen twice a week, and completed efficacy and safety measures including the 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale, the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale and the Clinical Global Impression scales. Results demonstrated significant improvement in all efficacy measures after one visit (2-4 days of treatment), with decreasing depression scores on all measures continuing throughout the trial. After 1 week of treatment, 15 out of 20 patients had experienced a 50% or greater reduction in their 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale scores. Remission rates were dramatic, with 40% of patients in remission after 1 week of treatment and 90% after 4 weeks. This open study of nefazodone-pindolol combination therapy suggests that this may be a new treatment option for patients with major depressive disorder; however, it needs to be replicated in a double-blind trial before conclusions regarding efficacy and safety can be made.", 
    "62": "A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group study was performed in 80 adult outpatients meeting ICD-10 criteria for major depression and with a Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score of at least 18 at baseline. All patients received paroxetine (20 mg once a day) plus either pindolol (2.5 mg three times a day) or matching placebo for 6 weeks. Analysis of the day 14 MADRS scores on an intent-to-treat basis revealed a treatment-by-centre interaction, with a significant effect of pindolol being demonstrable at only one centre. At this centre, 25% of the paroxetine plus pindolol group and 0% of the paroxetine plus placebo group showed a decrease of at least 50% from baseline MADRS by day 4 (p < 0.05). At day 14, the proportions were 73% and 7%, respectively (p < 0.001). Analysis of covariance on a \"perprotocol\" population demonstrated a significant accelerator effect of pindolol at days 4 and 7 in the absence of a treatment-by-centre interaction, but a centre effect was apparent at later time-points. The results suggest that the latency of antidepressant action can be reduced with pindolol augmentation. A large multicentre study is in progress to investigate this effect further.", 
    "63": "AIM OF ANTIHYPERTENSIVE TREATMENT IN DIABETICS: Prevention or treatment of hypertensive in diabetic patients reduces the incidence and progression of diabetic complications of retinopathy and nephropathy, cerebro- and cardio-vascular disease, and widespread macroangiopathy. Therefore, in patients with diabetes and hypertension beside good glucose control, the basic and probably major intervention steps is to normalize blood pressure. Antihypertensive treatment usually means life-long use of antihypertensive drugs. METABOLIC EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT DRUG CLASSES: Given the known diabetogenic properties of several antihypertensive drugs and their high rate of use, in probably a substantial proportion of patients with diabetes or prone to develop diabetes, treating arterial hypertension with conventional diuretics and/or beta-blockers might, in the long term, offset the beneficial effects of lowering blood pressure. Furthermore, there are conflicting reports of increased mortality in patients treated with diuretics, beta-blockers or calcium antagonists. Consequently, metabolic aspects and side effects of antihypertensive drugs are key elements in determining the preference for a specific antihypertensive regimen. Although the impact of hyperinsulinemia/insulin resistance on morbidity and mortality is an open question, it is preferable that antihypertensive treatment does not increase insulin resistance and/or hyperinsulinemia. Chronic beta-blocker treatment can be accompanied by an increase in insulin resistance. Calcium antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and alpha(1)-blockers are neutral or might even improve insulin resistance and lipid profile. Thiazides impair glucose tolerance, increase low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and decrease potassium, although these side effects are dose-dependent. Unless diuretics are needed for reasons other than hypertension, treatment of diabetics with thiazides should be avoided until the influence of these agents on prognosis is clarified. If the addition of a diuretic is needed, the metabolically neutral indapamide would seem a reasonable choice. PREFERRED FIRST-LINE TREATMENT: On the basis of favorable pharmacological profiles, ACE inhibitors and certain calcium antagonists have emerged as the preferred first-line drugs in the treatment of the hypertensive diabetic patient. In diabetics with nephropathy, therapy is usually initiated with an ACE inhibitor. Moreover, the combination of an ACE inhibitor and a calcium antagonist that lowers the heart rate (such as verapamil) might offer even greater advantages than either class of drug alone, since they combine metabolic neutrality with added antihypertensive and renal protective efficacy.",

We investigated the influence of exercise on QTd in patients with ischemic heart disease. On standard 12-lead electrocardiograms, QTd was measured before and after treadmill exercise in 7 normal subjects, 17 patients with effort angina pectoris (and > or = 75% stenosis on coronary arteriography), and 33 patients with old myocardial infarction. Bazett's formula was used to obtain the corrected QTd (QTcd). The pre-exercise resting QTcd was 45.9 +/- 10.6, 44.3 +/- 15.2, and 74.8 +/- 28.1 msec in the respective groups, being significantly greater in the infarct group (p < 0.05). The QTcd at 5 min after exercise was respectively 49.3 +/- 9.0, 58.8 +/- 19.9, and 75.4 +/- 30.9 msec (p = 0.0347, infarct vs. controls). The difference in QTcd was significant for the angina group before and after physical exercise (p = 0.0003). There was a significant increase of QTcd after exercise in the angina group whether or not the patients were receiving beta-blockers.

    "69": "Since analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) is able to identify subjects at risk of sudden death and as antiarrhythmics can interfere with this prognosis, the objective of this study was to determine whether antiarrhythmics (AA) modified the HRV measured on a 24-hour Holter recording and after rapid ventricular stimulation and whether the initial HRV and its possible modification during treatment with AA were correlated with the results of AA treatment in patients with ventricular tachycardia (sustained VT). The HRV was studied in 50 patients with heart disease and spontaneous sustained VT, reproduced by programmed ventricular stimulation. This analysis was performed at baseline with antiarrhythmic treatment consisting of low-dose beta-blocker and quinidines in 26 patients (group I) or amiodarone in 24 patients (group II). Treatment was effective (i.e. prevented induction of VT) in 9 patients in group I (group la) and 5 patients in group II (group IIa). Treatment was ineffective in the other 17 patients of group I (group Ib) and 19 patients of group II (group IIb). The initial HRV was similar in the patients of groups Ia and Ib or groups IIa and IIb. Temporal analysis did not reveal any significant variation of HRV during AA treatment.

    "72": "Attainment of the regression of hypertension-associated left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) seems to be a desirable goal of blood pressure (BP)-reducing therapy. Since antihypertensive drugs of differing types may exhibit markedly different abilities to modulate LVH, we examined the effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril, and the potassium channel activator minoxidil, alone or in combination with each other, on the left ventricular mass (LVM) in patients with severe essential hypertension who had LVH detected by echocardiography. All patients received the same base therapy of bopindolol and guanfacine. After a run-in period, they were treated with: (1) cilazapril (n = 10); (2) minoxidil, combined with a diuretic (n = 10); or (3) both cilazapril and monoxidil (n = 6) for 12 months. The LVM index (LVMI; LVM per body surface area) was estimated every 3 months by means of echocardiography. Each kind of therapy decreased the arterial pressures to a similar degree. The 1-year treatment with the cilazapril-based regimen resulted in a significantly diminished LVMI (from a mean +/- s.d. of 173 +/- 38 to 152 +/- 22 g/m2; P < 0.05). On the other hand, the minoxidil-based therapy led to a significant increase in LVMI (from 148 +/- 19 to 170 +/- 35 g/m2; P < 0.05). There were no significant LVMI changes in patients receiving the combined, cilazapril + minoxidil-based treatment (172 +/- 34 vs the pretreatment 183 +/- 54 g/m2). The results confirm that long-term treatment with cilazapril is effective both in reducing BP and in reducing LVM. In spite of yielding a satisfactory reduction of BP, minoxidil therapy, even in combination with a diuretic and a beta-blocker, may lead to an aggravation of pre-existing LVH; this effect of minoxidil could be prevented by the simultaneous administration of cilazapril.", 
    "73": "A mixture of amino acids inhibits propranolol metabolism in perfused rat livers. To obtain mechanistic information about the interaction, a related but less tissue-bound drug, metoprolol, was used to determine Vmax and K(M) for parent drug and two metabolites in the presence and absence of amino acids. Six groups of 4 livers from 24 male Sprague-Dawley rats were perfused in the single-pass mode at 3 ml/min/g liver for 130 min with oxygenated buffer containing 3.74, 4.49, 5.61, 7.48, 18.7, or 44.9 microM metoprolol. From 50 to 90 min, a balanced amino acid mixture was included in the buffer. Samples of liver effluent taken every 5 min were analyzed by HPLC for metoprolol and two metabolites, alpha-hydroxymetoprolol and O-demethylmetoprolol. Steady-state concentrations of drug determined before, during, and after amino acids were used to determine Vmax and apparent K(M) values by nonlinear curve-fitting under each condition. Amino acids reversibly reduced the Vmax values of metoprolol and both metabolites by approximately 50% without significantly affecting apparent K(M) values. As a result, large increases in availability occurred, especially at low metoprolol inlet concentrations (> 90%). Amino acids also increased oxygen consumption until the effluent buffer was almost depleted. Possible mechanisms influencing Vmax include direct inhibition of metabolic enzymes by amino acids or cosubstrate (NADPH or oxygen) limitation. Amino acid-mediated pericentral oxygen depletion in the hepatic sinusoids could result in inhibition of drug-metabolizing enzymes, and is consistent with a reduction of Vmax and oxygen depletion in the effluent buffer during amino acid coinfusion. We postulate that one or more of these mechanisms could contribute to the interaction between food and high first-pass drugs observed in humans.", 
    "74": "The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the adenylyl cyclase pathway, and in particular cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A, in the relaxant action of relaxin in the isolated uterus of the nonpregnant rat. The purportedly selective inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A N-[2-(methylamino) ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide hydrochloride (H-8) (at 100 mumol l-7) antagonized relaxin, salbutamol (an agonist at beta-adrenoceptors) and levcromakalim (a K+ channel opener) to a similar extent (by factors of 3.1, 1.9 and 2.8, respectively), demonstrating that it is not a selective inhibitor. Relaxin and levcromakalim were less potent and had smaller, maximal, relaxant effects in longitudinal myometrium than in intact uterus cut in the longitudinal plane. By contrast, nifedipine (a Ca2+ channel blocker) was equipotent in the two preparations and salbutamol only slightly less potent in the longitudinal myometrium. Relaxin did not alter the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A activity ratio in longitudinal myometrium, but did increase the activity ratio by a factor of 2.0 +/- 0.2 in the intact uterus. Salbutamol, the positive control, increased this activity ratio in both longitudinal myometrium (by 1.9 +/- 0.3 times) and in the intact uterus (by 3.8 +/- 0.3 times), whereas the negative control levcromakalim had no effect. Relaxin seems to act as a relaxant of longitudinal myometrium by a cyclic AMP-independent mechanism but possibly interacts with the circular myometrium or endometrium to release a relaxant factor via a cyclic-AMP-dependent mechanism.", 
    "75": "The proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1 (IL-1) is elevated in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. Studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that beta-amyloid (A beta) 1-42, fibrillar A beta 1-40 and A beta 25-35 induce the release of IL-1 beta from activated THP-1 cells, a human monocyte cell line. A beta also is chemotactic for primary rodent microglia and peritoneal macrophages. We hypothesize that A beta is a chemokine and induces these responses by interaction with chemotactic receptors. If this is true, then these A beta-induced responses should be calcium-dependent and require activation of pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins. To test this hypothesis, THP-1 cells were grown in culture with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and incubated with A beta 1-42 (5 muM) in the presence and absence of a calcium chelator, an inhibitor of intracellular calcium mobilization, a calcium channel blocker, or pertussis toxin, a bacterial endotoxin which uncouples G proteins from receptors by catalyzing the ADP ribosylation of cysteine near the carboxy-terminus of the alpha subunit. The media was collected and IL-1 beta present in the media was measured using an ELISA. Treatment of LPS-activated THP-1 cells with A beta 1-42 significantly elevated IL-1 beta released into the media as previously shown. Addition or ethylene glycol-bis (beta-aminothyl ether) N,N,N'N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) (0.5 mM), a calcium chelator, to the media blocked A beta-induced IL-1 beta release, but had no effect on LPS-activated THP-1 cell release of IL-1 beta. The presence of 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic acid 8-(diethyl amino)-octyl ester (TMB-8), an inhibitor of intracellular calcium mobilization, as well as nickel chloride, a non-specific calcium channel blocker, in the media also inhibited A beta-induced IL-1 release from LPS-activated THP-1 cells. IL- 1 beta release from activated THP-1 monocytes incubated with TMB-8 and nickel chloride without A beta remained at baseline values. Pretreatment of THP-1 monocytes with pertussis toxin for 4 h, followed by LPS activation and incubation with A beta, antagonized the release of IL-1 beta from these cells, but did not alter IL-1 beta release from activated THP-1 monocytes. These data suggest that A beta-induced IL-1 beta release from these cells is calcium-dependent and requires the activation of specific G-proteins. These findings are consistent with known second messengers that are activated following stimulation of chemotactic receptors.", 
    "76": "A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled comparison of metoprolol (50 mg) and celiprolol (200 mg) was undertaken in nine normal volunteers. Rest and exercise (supine bicycle) hemodynamics were assessed at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours following single oral doses of medication administered at weekly intervals. The influence of the ancillary pharmacological properties of metoprolol and celiprolol on cardiac pumping indices was assessed from heart rate and peak aortic acceleration (pkA-Exerdop). Following placebo, the heart rate and pkA increased progressively with exercise duration and workload. Following metoprolol 50 mg, the heart rate (-9.7 beat/min at 75 watts exercise) and pkA decreased. The blunting of acceleration was greater at higher exercise workloads (-6.7 m/sec2 at 75 watts exercise). Celiprolol reduced heart rate (-6.9 beat/min at 75 watts exercise) without a change in pkA. The heart rate/pkA relationship showed significant parallel displacement, downwards after metoprolol but upwards after celiprolol. Thus, for a given heart rate increment there was a greater decrease in pkA after metoprolol compared with celiprolol. The different ancillary pharmacological profiles of metoprolol and celiprolol resulted in contrasting hemodynamic profiles. The observed differences in the heart rate/pkA relationships may be attributable to the peripheral actions of these agents. The therapeutic relevance of the better maintained cardiac pumping indices on celiprolol for ischemic patients with impaired cardiac function warrants further investigation.", 
    "77": "Antihypertensive drugs, recommended by the World Health Organization for use in monotherapy, exert different effects on glucose and lipid metabolism. In our study we compared the effects of the beta-blocker atenolol (AT) and the alpha1-blocker bunazosin (BU) on glucose metabolism. The doses administered were chosen to produce similar antihypertensive effects with both drugs. The study was conducted as a bicenter, parallel, controlled, and double-blind study. All patients suffered from mild to moderate primary hypertension, were obese (body mass index > 26 kg/m2), but were nondiabetic. After a drug-free period of 4 weeks, patients were treated either with 6 and 12 mg of bunazosin (n = 15) or with 50 and 100 mg of atenolol (n = 17) once daily for 12 weeks. Glucose metabolism was measured by the iv glucose tolerance test (GTT) and the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp test. The results show a similar blood pressure reduction with both drugs. However, their effects on glucose metabolism were significantly (p < 0.05) different: The area under the curve (AUC) of glucose in the iv GTT increased 26.8% during atenolol treatment but decreased 30% during bunazosin treatment. The same influence on the AUC of insulin was observed [AT +478.5 +/- 441.8 (+22%) vs. BU, -588.5 +/- 411.1 (-22%)]. Similar changes were found in the glucose clamp test. The metabolic clearance rate increased 11.4% during bunazosin use and decreased 8.4% during atenolol use to the same degree that the insulin sensitivity index changed (BU +13.2% vs. AT -21.9%). The differences between the two treatment regimes were statistically significant (p < 0.05). These results in obese hypertensives confirm the well-known negative effects of beta-blockers on glucose metabolism. Additionally, they demonstrate that an alpha1-blocker such as bunazosin develops the same blood pressure-lowering effect as beta-blockers, but with a significantly better profile with regard to glucose metabolism. Therefore, the use of alpha1-blockers can be recommended for obese hypertensives without any special care for glucose metabolism.", 
    "78": "1. To investigate further the mechanism of the long duration of action of the selective beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, salmeterol, we have determined the duration of action of some responses to salmeterol which are not mediated through beta 2-adrenoceptors. 2. In the presence of propranolol (1 microM), salmeterol (1-30 microM) caused concentration-related relaxation of superfused, pre-contracted strips of guinea-pig gastric fundus. On washing the tissues, these relaxant responses were rapidly lost, the time to 50% recovery being approximately 30 min. 3. In human neutrophils, salmeterol (1-100 microM) caused concentration-related inhibition of FMLP-induced O2- release. Propranolol (1 microM) had little or no effect on the inhibitory activity of salmeterol. Washing the cells twice over a 40 min period caused a marked reduction of the inhibitory activity of salmeterol. 4. In guinea-pig superfused trachea, in the absence of propranolol, infusions of (RS)-salmeterol (10-30 nM) and the less potent (S)-enantiomer of salmeterol (300-3000 nM) inhibited electrically-induced contractile responses. When the infusion was stopped, there was no recovery from the inhibitory responses within 200 min. In the presence of propranolol (1 microM), infusions of (RS)-salmeterol (10 microM) and (S)-salmeterol (10-100 microM) also inhibited the contractile responses, but, in contrast, on stopping the infusions differences were observed in recovery times. Thus no appreciable recovery was observed from the responses to (RS)-salmeterol, whereas a rapid loss of inhibition was observed on stopping the infusion of (S)-salmeterol, the time to 50% recovery being 30-35 min. 5. These relatively short-lasting effects of salmeterol which are not mediated through beta 2-adrenoceptors, contrast with the persistence of the responses which are mediated through beta 2-adrenoceptors seen in a variety of tissues, but are similar to the rate of dissociation of salmeterol observed from artificial membranes. These observations suggest that the sustained agonist activity of salmeterol is peculiar to responses mediated by beta 2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "79": "1. The effects of prejunctional beta-adrenoceptor activation on electrically evoked noradrenaline (NA) and adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) were studied by use of continuous amperometry and conventional intracellular recording techniques. Excitatory junction potentials (e.j.ps) were used as a measure of ATP release, and NA-induced slow depolarizations and oxidation currents as measures of NA release, from postganglionic sympathetic nerves innervating the rat tail artery in vitro. 2. Isoprenaline (0.1 microM) increased the amplitude of e.j.ps, slow depolarizations and oxidation currents evoked by short trains of stimuli at 1 to 4 Hz. The facilitatory effect of isoprenaline on e.j.ps and oxidation currents was most pronounced on responses evoked by the first stimulus in a train. 3. Isoprenaline (0.1 microM) did not detectably alter the amplitude-frequency distribution of spontaneous e.j.ps. 4. The facilitatory effect of isoprenaline on e.j.ps, slow depolarizations and oxidation currents was abolished by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol (0.1 microM). Propranolol alone had no effect on e.j.ps, slow depolarizations or oxidation currents. 5. Thus, activation of prejunctional beta-adrenoceptors increases the release of both NA and ATP from postganglionic sympathetic nerves. The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that NA and ATP are released from the same population of nerve terminals and presumably from the same vesicles.",

    "81": "Fasting motility was monitored using a tube with water perfused side holes connected to a pneumohydraulic system. Continuous eight hour recordings were obtained from each volunteer after a 12 hour fasting period. In all experiments, saline was given as control for the first four hour period and beta-adrenergic agents for the next four hours. In separate control studies, saline was given for the whole eight hour period.", 
    "82": "Isoprenaline (2.5 micrograms/kg/min) reduced the number of activity fronts (phase III) of migrating motor complexes from 3 (2-4) in controls to 1 (0-2) during isoprenaline infusion (p < 0.01). Also, phase II-like activity replaced the regular motility pattern (p < 0.01). By contrast, propranolol (25 micrograms/kg/min) did not induce any significant changes in phase III compared with controls. Saline alone had no effect on motor activity.", 
    "83": "Isoprenaline inhibited activity fronts in the human proximal small intestine and induced a postprandial-like motility pattern, whereas propranolol did not affect motor patterns.

    "84": "1. In view of the potential therapeutic application of specific dopamine receptor agonists in the treatment of hypertension and left ventricular dysfunction, we investigated the cardiovascular actions of the novel mixed D1/D2 dopamine receptor agonist Z1046 in awake pigs at rest and during treadmill exercise. 2. Thirteen swine were chronically instrumented under sterile conditions for measurement of systemic, pulmonary, and coronary haemodynamics. Regional blood flows were determined with the radioactive microsphere technique. 3. Z1046 (1, 10, 100 micrograms kg-1, i.v.) produced dose-dependent reductions in central aortic blood pressure (up to 27 +/- 3%, P < or = 0.05) in awake resting pigs which was accompanied by only minimal reflex activation of the sympathetic nervous system. The hypotensive response was principally the result of peripheral vasodilatation (system vascular resistance decreased up to 35 +/- 4%, P < or = 0.05), which was located in the cerebral, coronary, renal, mesenteric, adrenal, splenic and skeletal muscular vascular beds (vascular resistance decreased up to 30-40% after the highest dose in these beds). Only in the cerebral and mesenteric bed was the vasodilatation sufficiently large to overcome the decrease in blood pressure and result in an increased blood flow; the vasodilatation in the coronary bed was most likely due to autoregulation as neither coronary blood flow nor myocardial oxygen demand were changed significantly by Z1046. The systemic vasodilatation that was caused by the highest i.v. dose (100 micrograms kg-1) was accompanied by transient and minor increases in heart rate (15 +/- 5%, P < or = 0.05) and cardiac output (15 +/- 5%, P < or = 0.05) whereas after 10 micrograms kg-1, i.v., a slight decrease in cardiac output also contributed to the hypotension. Z1046 had no effect on pulmonary vascular resistance. 4. The systemic vasodilator responses to Z1046 (100 micrograms kg 1, i.v.) were sustained during treadmill exercise (2-4 km h-1 which produced heart rates of up to 233 +/- 10 beats min-1), but with increasing treadmill speed attenuation of the exercise-induced increase in heart rate (-11 +/- 3%, P < or = 0.05) and hence cardiac output (-10 +/- 3%, P < or = 0.05) (as stroke volume was not altered by Z1046) contributed significantly to a lower aortic blood pressure (-20 +/- 3%, P < or = 0.05) Z1046 had no effect on pulmonary vascular resistance during exercise. 5. Oral administration of Z1046 (0.5, 1.5 mg kg-1) produced a fall in central aortic blood pressure (up to 15 +/- 3%, P < or = 0.05), which developed gradually during the first 90 min and lasted up to 4 h after administration, again with negligible changes in heart rate and LVdP/dtmax. 6. Neither non-selective alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockade, nor selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor blockade altered the vasodilator actions of Z1046, but non-selective alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockade abolished the cardiac responses to dopamine receptor stimulation, suggesting that its cardiac actions were principally caused by D2-receptor-mediated inhibition of catecholamine release, whereas the vasodilator response was probably the result of vascular D1-receptor stimulation. 7. In conclusion, the novel dopamine receptor agonist Z1046 is an effective blood pressure lowering agent that elicits minimal reflex activation of the sympathetic nervous system in awake resting pigs Systemic vasodilatation was not affected by combined alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockade, which is consistent with a predominantly D1 receptor-dependent vasodilator mechanism. The hypotensive effect is maintained during treadmill exercise during which systemic vasodilatation and a lower cardiac output both contribute to the blood pressure lowering actions of Z1046. The cardiovascular profile of this orally active compound warrants further investigation of this class of drugs in experimental and clinical hypertension.", 
    "85": "1. The mKv1.1 voltage-gated K+ channel has been expressed stably in Chinese hamster ovary cells and whole-cell currents recorded by the patch-clamp method. 2. A range of structurally related peptide toxins (dendrotoxins) from the venom of green mamba (Dendroaspis angusticeps) and black mamba (Dendroaspis polylepis polylepis) snakes were tested for mKv1.1 channel blocking activity. Their potencies were compared based on EC50s derived from their respective concentration-inhibition relationships. 3. The rank order of potency, thus determined was: Toxin K > 7-dendrotoxin(7-Dtx) > delta-Dtx > Toxin I = alpha-Dtx > beta-Dtx. 4. Block was independent of voltage and no effects of the toxins on the kinetics of activation were observed. These results are consistent with a mechanism involving the block of closed channels. 5. A wide range of activity was observed even between toxins with an extremely high degree of sequence homology. Toxin K, in particular was an exquisitely potent blocker of the mKv1.1 channel, having an EC50 of 30 pM compared with 1.8 nM for delta-Dtx in spite of 95% sequence identity.", 
    "86": "Using amperometric techniques, electrochemical events associated with vesicular transmitter release were recorded from isolated rat type I carotid body cells when exposed to a solution containing 50 mM K+. Events were enhanced in amplitude by preloading cells with the catecholamine precursor, L-beta-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA). K(+)-evoked secretion was abolished by the non-selective Ca2+ channel blocker Cd2+ (100 microM) and markedly reduced by the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine (5 microM). Our results indicate that secretion from isolated rat type I cells can be monitored electrochemically and we demonstrate a major role for L-type Ca2+ channels in mediating K(+)-evoked secretion.", 
    "87": "The effects of beta-adrenoceptor agonists (beta-agonists) on the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were investigated. The beta-agonists, procaterol, clenbuterol, fenoterol and terbutaline, inhibited TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta production in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas they had no effect on IL-8 production. TNF-alpha production was inhibited more potently than IL-1 beta. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dbcAMP) also inhibited the production of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta, but not IL-8. TNF-alpha production was almost completely inhibited by dbcAMP, whereas IL-1 beta production appeared to be partially refractory even at the highest concentration examined. Both procaterol and theophylline elevated cAMP levels in LPS-stimulated PBMCs, but the effect of procaterol was limited. The inhibition of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta production by procaterol was additively potentiated with theophylline. dl-Propranolol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, abrogated the inhibition of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta production by procaterol. These results indicate that beta-agonists inhibit the production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta, by elevating intracellular cAMP levels. These properties of beta-agonists might be beneficial in the treatment of allergic inflammation.", 
    "88": "This study prospectively evaluated the clinical efficacy, the incidence of torsades de pointes, and the presumable risk factors for torsades de pointes in patients treated with d,l-sotalol for sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Eighty-one consecutive patients (54 with coronary artery disease, and 20 with dilated cardiomyopathy) with inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation received oral d,l-sotalol to prevent induction of the ventricular tachyarrhythmia. During oral loading with d,l-sotalol, continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring was performed. Those patients in whom d,l-sotalol prevented induction of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation were discharged with the drug and followed up on an outpatient basis for 21 +/- 18 months. Induction of the ventricular tachyarrhythmia was prevented by oral d,l-sotalol in 35 (43%) patients; the ventricular tachyarrhythmia remained inducible in 40 (49%) patients; and two (2.5%) patients did not tolerate even 40 mg of d,l-sotalol once daily. Four (5%) patients had from torsades de pointes during the initial oral treatment with d,l-sotalol. Neither ECG [sinus-cycle length (SCL), QT or QTc interval, or U wave] nor clinical parameters identified patients at risk for torsades de pointes. However, the oral dose of d,l-sotalol was significantly lower in patients with torsades de pointes (200 +/- 46 vs. 328 +/- 53 mg/day; p = 0.0017). Risk factors associated with the development of torsades de pointes were the appearance of an U wave (p = 0.049), female gender (p = 0.015), and significant dose-corrected changes of SCL, QT interval, and QTc interval (p < 0.05). During follow-up, seven (20%) patients had a nonfatal ventricular tachycardia recurrence, and two (6%) patients died suddenly. One female patient with stable cardiac disease had recurrent torsades de pointes after 2 years of successful treatment with d,l-sotalol. Torsades de pointes occurred early during treatment even with low doses of oral d,l-sotalol. Pronounced changes in the surface ECG (cycle length, QT, and QTc) in relation to the dose of oral d,l-sotalol might identify a subgroup of patients with an increased risk for torsades de pointes. Other ECG parameters before the application of d,l-sotalol did not identify patients at increased risk for torsades de pointes. Recurrence rates of ventricular tachyarrhythmias are high despite complete suppression of the arrhythmia during programmed stimulation. Therefore programmed electrical stimulation in the case of d,l-sotalol seems to be of limited prognostic value.", 
    "89": "The synaptic connection between the commissural portion of the nucleus tractus solitarius (ComNTS) and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV) was studied in rat brain stem slices, using the patch-clamp technique. The excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSC) evoked by stimulation of the ComNTS were blocked by kynurenic acid (1 mM) and, in Mg2+-free solution, were sensitive to both the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor blocker 3-[(RS)-2-carboxypiperazine-4-yl] -propyl-1-phosphonic acid (20 microM) and the non-NMDA receptor blocker 2,3-dihydro-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo(f)quinoxaline (5 microM). Norepinephrine (NE, 1-100 microM) inhibited the EPSC, and the inhibition was attenuated by the alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonists idazoxan (1 microM) and yohimbine (10 microM) but not by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist nadolol (50 microM). The NE-releasing agent tyramine (100 microM) reduced the EPSC, and the inhibition was attenuated by 1 microM idazoxan. NE (30 microM) did not affect the membrane input resistance but reduced the paired-pulse depression, demonstrating that NE acts on presynaptic alpha2-adrenoceptors. The results indicate the existence of a glutamatergic pathway from the ComNTS to the DMV neurons modulated by presynaptic NE receptors. This pathway might be a component of the vagovagal reflex regulating gastrointestinal function.", 
    "90": "To assess the relative importance of ancillary properties (ie, intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), beta 1-selectivity, membrane stabilizing activity, and lipophilicity) in the effect of beta-blockers on mortality, a meta-analysis of all available secondary and primary prevention trials was performed. Seventy-one trials evaluating the effect on mortality after myocardial infarction (MI) were identified. The overall relative risk (RR) of mortality during beta-blocker treatment versus placebo was 0.89 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.84-0.93), with a trend according to time of intervention: very early intervention RR 0.94 (95% CI 0.87-1.01), early intervention RR 0.91 (95% CI 0.81-1.01), and late intervention RR 0.80 (95% CI 0.73-0.88). Results were similar or even more marked for the end points one-week mortality, reinfarction, and sudden death. beta 1-selectivity, lipophilicity, absence of membrane stabilizing property, and absence of ISA were associated with a greater risk reduction compared with beta-blockers with the opposite ancillary property. When the effect of the three most frequently used beta-blocking drugs (atenolol, metoprolol, and propranolol) were compared, the drug with the combination of ancillary properties showing the most pronounced beneficial effects (metoprolol) had the most marked effect on survival. A similar trend was observed when the five published primary prevention trials comparing beta-blockers and diuretics in patients with hypertension were considered, but the number of studies was too low to allow for definite conclusions. We conclude that beta-blockade after MI leads to a substantial reduction in mortality. The so-called 'class-effect' of beta-blockers, however, can be questioned, because ancillary properties appear to play an important role in the efficacy of these drugs.",

Alpha-adrenoceptor agonists either increased or decreased neuronal activity, depending on the population of neurons studied. On the other hand, the activity generated by intrinsic cardiac neurons was augmented by beta-adrenoceptor agonists. Ventricular contractile force increased when intrinsic cardiac neurons were excited by adrenoceptor agonists. The spontaneous activity generated by neurons was suppressed by beta-adrenoceptor, but not alpha-adrenoceptor, blockade. Neuronal and cardiovascular responses were no longer elicited by an agonist in the presence of its selective antagonist; they were elicited in the presence of antagonists to the other receptor subtypes studied.",

    "95": "Plasma lipoprotein cholesterol abnormalities, diabetes, hypertension and smoking have all been identified as independent predictors of cardiovascular events. Clustering of multiple risk factors suggests a common metabolic link among high blood pressure, insulin resistance, plasma lipoprotein abnormalities and obesity. New guidelines for the management of dyslipidemias target patients with established coronary artery disease (CAD), and high risk patients with multiple risk factors and severe genetic lipoprotein disorders, such as familial hypercholesterolemia. To determine the prevalence of lipoprotein, apolipoprotein and metabolic disorders in premature CAD, 243 men and 61 women with premature CAD (occurring before age 60 years) and 203 age- and sex-matched controls (152 men, 61 women) were studied. After correcting for beta-blocker use (40% of men and 54% of women), hypertension and diabetes were seen more frequently in CAD patients than in controls. In men and women, cholesterol, triglycerides, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, apolipoprotein B and lipoprotein (a) were significantly higher, and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was lower, in CAD patients than in controls. By stratifying patients according to LDL cholesterol: HDL cholesterol ratio (5 or less, or greater than 5) and by triglyceride levels (less than 2.3 mmol/L, or 2.3 mmol/L or greater), significantly more men and women with CAD were found to have an elevated LDL cholesterol:HDL cholesterol ratio and elevated triglycerides (13.8% versus 1.9%, men and women combined, CAD versus controls, P < 0.0001). A metabolic factor index was devised, assigning a score of 1 each for presence of hypertension, lipoprotein abnormalities, diabetes or fasting blood glucose above 7.0 mmol/L, and a body mass index of 27 or greater. The prevalence of a metabolic factor index of 3 or more was 29.2% in CAD men versus 6.7% in controls (P < 0.0001) and 38.3% in CAD women versus 11.7% in controls (P < 0.01). Familial hypercholesterolemia was seen in fewer than 5% of patients with premature CAD and type III dyslipoproteinemia in one of 343 CAD patients. The distribution of apolipoprotein E phenotypes was the same in CAD patients and controls. Multivariate analysis revealed that in men, HDL cholesterol, lipoprotein (a) levels and smoking were the best predictors of risk. In men, plasma levels of LDL cholesterol, triglycerides or body mass index did not enter the model at the P < 0.05 level. In women, low HDL cholesterol, lipoprotein (a), the presence of diabetes, smoking and apolipoprotein B levels were all predictors of risk (P < 0.05). However, the clustering of risk factors may be the best predictor of risk. In this selected population, HDL and lipoprotein (a) are the best metabolic markers of premature CAD; metabolic factor clustering is common in patients with premature CAD.", 
    "96": "To examine whether there is a primary deficit in beta-adrenoceptor density in asthma, pulmonary and cardiac beta-receptor density was determined in vivo with positron emission tomography (PET) in 10 male asthmatic subjects (36 +/- 8 yr of age) and compared with that in 30 age-matched normal male subjects (36 +/- 8 yr of age). Pulmonary beta-receptor density was 10.3 +/- 1.8 pmol/g tissue for the asthmatic group and 10.9 +/- 1.9 for the normal group. Cardiac beta-receptor density was 9.1 +/- 3.3 pmol/g for the asthmatic group and 8.8 +/- 2.3 pmol/g for the normal group. There was no difference in either pulmonary or cardiac beta-receptor density between the two groups. In addition, an inverse relationship was observed between FEV1 % predicted and pulmonary beta-receptor density in asthmatic subjects. In conclusion, beta-receptor numbers are normal in untreated asthmatic subjects.", 
    "97": "Laryngomicroscopy causes considerable haemodynamic and ECG changes and therefore requires high doses of anaesthetic agents, which prolong recovery. In this double-blind randomized work, we studied the effect of esmolol, a short-acting beta-adrenergic receptor-blocking agent, on haemodynamic and ECG changes during laryngomicroscopy under thiopental-alfentanil-isoflurane-suxamethonium anaesthesia.", 
    "98": "Forty ASA class I-II patients (mean age 43 +/- 11 yr) were allocated to receive either esmolol 1 mg.kg-1 + 200 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 (the esmolol group) or saline (the control group). Heart rate and arterial pressure were measured noninvasively and ECG was analyzed with the aid of a microcomputer. Comparisons between the groups were performed using two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures and the Student's t-test.", 
    "99": "In the presence of esmolol, neither the heart rate nor the QTc interval of the ECG increased significantly when compared with the baseline values, with the exception that the QTc interval was increased after intubation. The increase in arterial pressure after insertion of the operating laryngoscope was not prevented in esmolol-treated patients. No cardiac arrhythmias occurred in either of the groups.", 
    "100": "On the basis of the present study, esmolol-bolus + infusion during alfentanil-isoflurane anaesthesia in healthy, middle-aged patients is a useful treatment in circumstances where an increase of the heart rate, prolongation of the QTc interval and cardiac arrhythmias should be avoided.", 
    "101": "The influence of prolonged beta-adrenergic receptor blockade on stereologic parameters of the ventral prostate and serum testosterone concentrations was examined in adult rats injected with propranolol (0.1 or 0.4 mg kg-1/day) for 15 or 30 consecutive days. Both doses of propranolol reduced the relative and absolute volume of the ventral prostate blood vessels. This effect was prevented by simultaneous administration of urapidil, an alpha 1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, indicating that a compensatory vasoconstriction took place as a consequence of propranolol treatment. Serum testosterone concentration was significantly increased following the 30-day application of the lower dose of the drug. These results show that prolonged administration of propranolol, although not affecting the epithelial component of the gland, may indirectly influence prostatic function by reducing the blood flow to the gland.", 
    "102": "The influence of different substitutions in 4-position of the phenyl ring of three recently developed l-alkylamino-3-phenoxy-2-propanol derivatives on the beta-adrenolytic potency and tissue specificity has been investigated and compared to the cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist celiprolol. The pA2 values against the isoprenaline tachycardia in isolated right atria (beta 1) and the relaxation of tracheal muscle (beta 2) both of guinea-pigs were expressed as beta 1/beta 2 selectivity ratio. The efficiencies and cardioselectivity of 4-propoxycarbonylderivative (BL 345 Ac) as well as celiprolol were similar, whereas 4-propoxymetylsubstitution (FoA 34t) decreased the inhibiting potency to the heart tissue nearly three times. The elimination of the 4-substitutent leads to the total loss of cardioselectivity (FoA 04). In addition, the character of the 4-substition has also influenced the nonspecific membrane activity expressed as local anesthetic efficiency in experiments on rabbit eyes and guinea-pig skin.", 
    "103": "Research into the exact mechanism and site of action of ACE inhibiting compounds has been hampered by methodological difficulties concerning the quantitation of ACE inhibition in tissues. This paper describes an attempt to address this difficulty. ACE activity in serum and uncentrifuged skeletal muscle homogenates was measured with a fluorometric assay before and during treatment in 24 fosinopril-treated and 26 atenolol-treated hypertensives. The absolute difference in activity between the higher and the lower of two different sample dilutions divided by the mean activity was taken to represent competitive inhibition in the sample, \"inhibitor index\". The reduction in muscle ACE activity coinciding with fosinopril treatment was not statistically significant (-2.6%, p = 0.68). The inhibitor index, however, increased by 46% (p = 0.045) and no change was seen in the atenolol-treated group (-12%, p = 0.51). The change in muscle inhibitor index (but not the reduction in serum ACE activity) correlated inversely with the change in blood pressure (r = -0.50, p = 0.034) and serum aldosterone (r = -0.54, p = 0.031) in the fosinopril group, but not in the atenolol group. In a second study, serum inhibitor index increased by 0.28 (95% CI 0.24-0.32) in 12 trandolapril-treated, but was unchanged in 11 atenolol-treated patients (+0.0097, 95% CI -0.029-0.048). In conclusion, the present study indicates that the inhibitor index described recognizes physiologically relevant ACE inhibition. The value of the method needs to be investigated further.", 
    "104": "The positive chronotropic effect of a high concentration of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in rat isolated atria results mainly from a tyramine-like mechanism and is linked to an increase in cAMP production by an indirect stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors. Using this preparation, we have compared the action of tyramine and 5-HT. The tyramine (0.15 microM)-induced increase in atrial rate was suppressed by atenolol (a beta 1-blocking drug) and by nadolol (a beta 1 beta 2-blocker), while the positive chronotropic effect of 5-HT was reduced by atenolol and suppressed by nadolol. The 5-HT-induced elevation in cAMP was unchanged in the presence of atenolol and abolished by nadolol. The involvement of beta 2-adrenoceptors in the effects of 5-HT could result from competition between 5-HT and noradrenaline at the beta 1-adrenoceptors that results in a fixation of noradrenaline on beta 2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "105": "We studied the uptake metabolism, and distribution of a fluorescent analog of CDP-diacylglycerol [cytidine diphosphate-1, 2-oleoyl, (N-(4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole) aminocaproyl) diacylglycerol; CDP-NBD-DAG]. When cells were incubated with CDP-NBD-DAG for 60 min at 11 degrees C and washed, the fluorescent lipid was localized to the plasma membrane. However, upon warming to 37 degrees C, the fluorescent lipid redistributed into various intracellular membranes and was metabolized primarily to fluorescent analogs of DAG and phosphatidylcholine (PC), although small amounts of fluorescent phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylinositol (PI) were also formed. The incorporation of 32Pi into some of the fluorescent lipids was also determined in order to assess their turnover. Stimulation of cells with platelet-derived growth factor enhanced the synthesis of fluorescent PI relative to unstimulated cells by approximately 68%, while the synthesis of fluorescent PC was unaffected. In addition, the incorporation of 32Pi into fluorescent PI was enhanced. Stimulation of cells with interleukin-1 beta enhanced the synthesis of both fluorescent PI (approximately 88%) and PC (approximately 250%) compared to non-stimulated cells, but with less incorporation of 32Pi into fluorescent PI. Finally, incubation of CDP-NBD-DAG-treated cells with inhibitors of phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase and DAG kinase resulted in a dramatic increase in the amount of fluorescent PI formed (approximately 64% of all the CDP-NBD-DAG metabolites). We conclude that CDP-NBD-DAG can be used for the de novo synthesis of fluorescent PI, and in combination with 32P labeling, provides a convenient method for studying PI turnover.", 
    "106": "Several studies performed before and after the introduction of fibrinolysis as a routine treatment of patients with myocardial infarction (MI) consistently showed that diabetic patients have a higher mortality in-hospital and after discharge. Women with insulin-dependent diabetes (IDD) appear to have a particularly ominous prognosis. So far, very few randomized prospective studies evaluated the effect of pharmacological treatments on prognosis of diabetic patients during acute MI: most of the information on the effect of commonly used cardiovascular drugs in diabetic patients with acute MI (AMI) has been obtained only from retrospective subgroup analyses of some of the large trials or as nonrandomized comparisons. The overview of fibrinolytic trials in acute MI found that fibrinolytic treatment was associated with a 35 days mortality of 13.6% versus 17.3% in diabetics (-21.7%) and 8.7% versus 10.2% in nondiabetics (-14.3%). Data from trials with aspirin suggest that the beneficial effect of this drug is maintained in diabetic patients with acute MI, but the optimal dosage remains undefined. Based on available evidence, beta blockers appear to be able to reduce mortality post-MI in diabetic patients, with an absolute and relative beneficial effect that is, in most cases, larger than that observed in nondiabetic patients. The pooled data from studies non beta blockers indicate a 37% mortality reduction in diabetic patients, compared to 13% in nondiabetics during the acute phase, and a 48% reduction of mortality compared to 33% in nondiabetics post-discharge. Data on outcome of diabetic patients in trials evaluating calcium antagonists are lacking, and there is a strong need for a reevaluation of data from completed trials to obtain some hints on the possible effect of these agents in this population. The \"long-term\" studies on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients with left ventricular dysfunction some time after AMI have shown that the beneficial effect documented in the overall population is present also when limiting the analysis to patients with a history of diabetes, whereas the \"acute\" studies enrolling patients within 24-36 h after the onset of symptoms have shown a marked beneficial effect of ACE inhibitors in diabetic patients. For example, in the GISSI 3 study, treatment with lisinopril was associated with a decreased 6-week mortality in both IDD (11.8% versus 21.1, p < 0.05) and non-IDD (8.0% versus 10.6%, p < 0.05) patients corresponding to a 44.1% and 24.5% reduction, respectively. All these results must be taken with great caution because in no studies the effect of treatment in diabetic patients was a predefined analysis. They strongly suggest, however, that ACE inhibitors and beta blockers may be particularly beneficial during the acute phase of MI and also post-discharge, offering a strong rationale for their widespread use in diabetic patients with acute MI.", 
    "107": "There is clear evidence of the negative influence of type I or II diabetes non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) on the prevalence, severity, and prognosis of cardiovascular disease. Epidemiologic studies have confirmed the relationship between NIDDM and the occurrence of coronary artery disease (CAD) and cardiac heart failure (CHF). The clinical aspects of NIDDM cardiac complications include a high rate of silent events, which merit an improvement in their diagnosis and treatment. Besides pharmacological therapy, aggressive approaches including percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), and coronary surgery should be considered for the treatment of stable angina. IN some subgroups, the benefit of surgery has been proven. Available data indicate that diabetes (both type I and II) is a risk factor for an increase in morbidity and mortality following coronary bypass surgery. These data do not differentiate results between type I and type II diabetes. The indications for surgical revascularization are: three-vessel disease, left main artery stenosis, two-vessel disease including proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis, and two-vessel disease with left ventricular dysfunction. For PTCA, diabetes (type I more than type II) renders the technique more difficult and restenosis more frequent. From the results obtained in the general population and from a few specific studies, it is suspected that, in type II diabetes, PTCA and CABG are superior to conventional medical treatment. However, further specific studies on the beneficial effects of PTCA/CABG over optimal medical therapy are needed, at least in some angiographic conditions. Management of the diabetic patient with acute myocardial infarction is for the most part similar to the nondiabetic patient, with certain special considerations. Treatment includes thrombolytic therapy, invasive management, surgery, PTCA, beta blocker use, and aspirin use. Finally, diabetes mellitus is a cause of systolic and diastolic function, leading to clinical signs of CHF. Conventional medical therapy also applies to cardiac failure complicating diabetes. Medical therapy includes as the first line diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. We conclude that cardiac care can be improved in diabetic patients. For the time being, the first step is to improve the detection of coronary artery disease. As serious events are more likely to occur in the diabetic population, it would be easier (shorter studies and less patients) to demonstrate the benefit of a selected therapy. Further studies are therefore required. In the meantime, special efforts can be made: (1) prevent the development of coronary artery disease. Preventive measures aimed at the control of risk factors at the individual level must be optimal. What should be promoted is a more global approach to the patient, taking into account all parts of the risk factor profile, in order to amplify the reduction in risk and in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. (2) When CAD is confirmed: the goal is to prevent all major cardiac events: unstable angina, myocardial infarction, sudden death, and CHF secondary to silent ischemic events. This can be achieved through the improvement of the accuracy of noninvasive diagnostic procedures, taking into account the cost of these procedures and the absence of pain perception in diabetic patients.", 
    "108": "Bradykinin (BK) is an endogenous peptide exerting a potent influence on the behavior of the heart. The local regulatory mechanisms responsible for BK modulation of cardiac automaticity and contractility remain poorly understood. The role of the intrinsic cardiac nervous system (ICNS) in mediating the BK-induced regulatory effect was investigated.", 
    "109": "Heart rate (HR) and intramyocardial pressure (IMP) changes in response to BK (1.2-80 nmol) were studied in isolated rabbit hearts (n = 37). The intrinsic neural mechanisms underlying the cardiac effects of BK were characterized by use of atropine (ATR, 10(-6) M), timolol (TIM, 10(-5) M), hexamethonium (HEX, 10(-4) M), and tetrodotoxin (TTX, 10(-7) M). Modulation of beta-adrenergic tone by dobutamine (DOB, 1.6 x 10(-6) M) was used to expose the physiological importance of intrinsic cholinergic systems in mediating the cardiac action of BK.", 
    "110": "A single dose of BK induced an increase in IMP and a biphasic HR response. The negative chronotropic response to BK was correlated with negative HR change induced by nicotine activation of ICNS. BK-elicited 'bradycardia' was abolished by ATR and TTX, and attenuated (approximately 50%) by HEX. ATR and TTX potentiated the positive HR-response which was not affected by TIM. BK selectively antagonized [by 48.1(5.1)%] the DOB-induced tachycardia but did not modify the accompanied inotropic potentiation.", 
    "111": "These findings are the first demonstration that in the autonomically decentralized heart, the negative chronotropic action of BK is mediated by intrinsic cardiac cholinergic neurons. It would appear that the intrinsic neural network response, and not merely the BK-induced potentiation of cardiac postganglionic neural activity is involved in the local neuromodulatory action of BK. This intrinsic cardiac regulatory mechanism seems to play a major role in mitigating the adrenergically induced tachycardia, thus endowing this peptide with the capacity for cardioprotection.",

Adrenergic antagonists were introduced into a small site on the forehead by iontophoresis, and vascular responses were monitored bilaterally with laser Doppler flowmetry. Beta blockade prevented increases in blood flow in infrequent blushers during mental arithmetic and partially inhibited vasodilatation during singing, indicating minor participation of beta-adrenoceptors in blushing. Alpha blockade did not affect blushing but augmented vasodilatation during exercise. Despite higher ratings of self-consciousness in frequent than in infrequent blushers, vascular responses were similar in both groups.

Anaesthesia was standardized. Haemodynamic responses and requirements for atropine, ephedrine and labetalol to maintain HR and BP during surgery were similar in healthy and diseased patients, and in the test drug groups. Differences produced by the test drugs were evident until 5 min following intubation. Esmolol prevented rises in HR and RPP. Glyceryl trinitrate prevented a rise in BP, but was associated with tachycardia and a fall in PRQ to < 1.0. Magnesium sulphate and lignocaine did not prevent responses to laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation, and were associated with rises in RPP.

We also measured metabolic responses to exercise and to salbutamol infusion. Exercise induced a rise in plasma potassium and noradrenaline. Salbutamol produced a fall in plasma potassium, a rise in plasma glucose and insulin and also a rise in plasma noradrenaline. All of these changes were not different following placebo or 3 days after the end of timolol treatment; by contrast, 2 days following timolol treatment, all were significantly attenuated, with the exception of the rise in plasma glucose.

After 90 min of exercise, plasma ammonia levels were as follows: placebo 37 mumol l-1 (0-84), metoprolol CR + fluvastatin 56 mumol l-1 (2-110), metoprolol CR + bezafibrate 79 mumol l-1 (0-167), atenolol + fluvastatin 90 mumol l-1 (10-170), and atenolol + bezafibrate 100 mumol l-1 26-174). In comparison with placebo, metoprolol CR + fluvastatin had the least adverse impact on measures of perceived exertion and the 'feeling scale' during exercise. Metoprolol CR + bezafibrate, atenolol + fluvastatin, and atenolol + bezafibrate treatments had greater adverse effects, particularly on perceived 'cardiorespiratory effort' and 'feeling scale' scores.", 
    "146": "In healthy volunteers, combinations of beta 1-selective blockers and lipid-lowering drugs were associated with significant reductions in fat metabolism, increased plasma ammonia levels, and raised the perception of effort during exercise, in comparison with placebo. Metoprolol CR + fluvastatin had the least effect, combinations metoprolol CR + bezafibrate and atenolol + fluvastatin had intermediate effects, and atenolol + bezafibrate had the most adverse effect.", 
    "147": "The aim of the study was to investigate the pharmacokinetic interaction between sotalol and antacids, and its pharmacodynamic relevance.", 
    "148": "In a randomized cross-over design with three treatment groups, six healthy volunteers received orally either 160 mg of sotalol alone (phase 1), or 160 mg sotalol plus 20 ml of a suspension of an antacid (MAH; magnesium hydroxide (1200 mg) and aluminium oxide (1800 mg)) (phase 2) or 160 mg sotalol plus the antacid given 2 h after sotalol administration (phase 3). Heart rate and plasma sotalol concentrations were measured before and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 h after sotalol administration. Urinary sotalol excretion was measured for 24 h after sotalol application.", 
    "149": "Cmax of sotalol decreased from 1.22 +/- 0.22 mgl-1 (phase 1) to 0.89 +/- 0.29 mgl-1 (phase 2) and increased again to 1.27 +/- 0.18 mgl-1 in phase 3. A similar significant change was noted in AUC (15.6 +/- 2.75 mgl-1, 12.3 +/- 3.04 mg h l-1 and 15.0 +/- 2.06 mgl-1) and in the amount of cumulative urinary excretion (79.2 +/- 11.1 mg, 72.1 +/- 11.2 mg and 80.6 +/- 7.9 mg), respectively. tmax and elimination half-life (t1/2,z) of sotalol remained unchanged in the presence of MAH. After combined administration with MAH, the area under the heart rate curve of sotalol was reduced between 0 and 4 h when compared across treatments.", 
    "150": "Combined administration of sotalol and MAH decreased the serum sotalol levels. The interaction can be avoided by a two hour interval between application of these drugs.", 
    "151": "To determine whether angiotensin II (ANG II) affects cardiac performance via neurons in intrathoracic cardiac ganglia, studies were performed on anesthetized dogs. To exclude possible vascular regulatory effects of ANG II, experiments were also performed using long-term cultures of adult guinea pig ventricular cardiomyocytes with or without intrathoracic neurons. 1) In in situ experiments in 10 anesthetized dogs, cardiac augmentation occurred when ANG II (10 microl or 0.1 ml; 10-100 microM) was administered into limited loci within acutely decentralized stellate or middle cervical ganglia that were neurally connected to, but not those disconnected from, the heart. In another 18 dogs, ANG II increased intrinsic cardiac neuronal activity when administered adjacent to such neurons or into their local arterial blood supply. Ventricular ionotropic effects elicited by ANG II were eliminated by timolol, whereas increases in intrinsic cardiac neuronal activity were not affected. Effects elicited by ANG II were eliminated by administration of a selective AT1 receptor antagonist (losartan) but not by a selective AT2 receptor antagonist (PD-123319). 2) In in vitro experiments, ANG II (100 nM) induced positive chronotropic effects on cultured adult guinea pig cardiomyocytes innervated with adult extrinsic or intrinsic cardiac neurons, but not those cultured without neurons. The frequency of calcium inward current (Ca(i)) transients (recorded by fura 2 fluorescence) increased in innervated cocultures but not in the noninnervated cardiomyocyte cultures; however, the amplitude of Ca(i) transients was not affected by ANG II in cultures or in freshly isolated adult guinea pig cardiomyocytes. ANG II-induced effects in cocultures were blocked by losartan but not PD-123319 or timolol. Thus 1) ANG II-sensitive neurons exist in intrathoracic extracardiac and intrinsic cardiac ganglia; 2) these neurons possess AT1 receptors; and 3) these neurons appear to act directly and indirectly via adrenergic neurons to enhance cardiomyocyte function.", 
    "152": "The influence of daily spontaneous running (DSR) and gender on postexercise cardiac autonomic responses was examined in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Rats were weaned at 4-5 wk of age and were randomly assigned to a sedentary (7 males and 6 females) or DSR (7 males and 8 females) group. After 8 weeks of DSR or sedentary control, rats were chronically instrumented with arterial and venous catheters. After 5 days of recovery, cardiac sympathetic (ST) and parasympathetic tonus (PT) were determined (by the response of heart rate to receptor antagonists) on alternate days under two experimental conditions: no exercise and postexercise. After a single bout of dynamic treadmill exercise (12 m/min, 10% grade for 40 min) ST was reduced (P < 0.05) (male sedentary: no exercise 45 +/- 4 vs. postexercise 28 +/- 3 beats/min; female sedentary: no exercise 69 +/- 10 vs. postexercise 37 +/- 7 beats/ min). PT was also altered after exercise (male sedentary: no exercise -31 +/- 4 vs. postexercise -11 +/- 2 beats/min; female sedentary: no exercise -5 +/- 4 vs. postexercise 7 +/- 4 beats/min). After DSR, ST was reduced (male sedentary 45 +/- 4 vs. DSR 22 +/- 3 beats/min; female sedentary 69 +/- 10 vs. DSR 36 +/- 4 beats/min) (P < 0.05). Finally, male rats had a lower ST and higher PT than female rats. These results demonstrate that 1) ST was reduced after a single bout of dynamic exercise; 2) ST was reduced after DSR; 3) the autonomic response to acute exercise was attenuated after DSR; and 4) there was a gender influence on the cardiac autonomic function.", 
    "153": "The effect of the stable prostacyclin analog iloprost and its mechanism of action were investigated with the use of pressurized rat tail small arteries with a spontaneous myogenic tone. Iloprost concentration dependently dilated these vessels with a half-maximal effective dose of 5.0 +/- 0.5 x 10(-8) M. Application of 10(-7)-10(-6) M glibenclamide, a blocker of ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channels, inhibited the iloprost-induced dilation. Glibenclamide did not affect the basal vessel diameter. The application of 5 x 10(-5)-10(-3) M tetraethylammonium (TEA) and 5 x 10(-9)-10(-7) M iberiotoxin, blockers of calcium-activated potassium (K(Ca)) channels, decreased vessel diameter in the presence of iloprost. Both TEA and iberiotoxin reduced the basal vessel diameter. Glibenclamide at 10(-6) M inhibited the dilation produced by 5 x 10(-5) M Sp-5,6-DCl-cBIMPS, an activator of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase. Iberiotoxin at 10(-7) M decreased vessel diameter in the presence of Sp-5,6-DCl-cBIMPS. H-89 and Rp-8-CPT-cAMPS, blockers of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), inhibited the iloprost-induced dilation of these vessels. With use of the whole cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique, it was observed that 5 x 10(-7) M iloprost enhanced an outward current, determined largely by K(Ca) channels, 1.79 +/- 0.17-fold in freshly isolated smooth muscle cells from rat tail small artery. These data show that iloprost dilates rat tail small arteries with a spontaneous myogenic tone and suggest that K(ATP) as well as K(Ca) channels are involved in this effect, which is mediated, at least partly, by PKA.", 
    "154": "To fully utilize the potential of newly developed mouse models with specific genetic mutations, it is necessary to study the functional consequences of genetic manipulation in the fully intact animal. To this end, the purpose of the present study was to develop and validate a methodology for the study of myocardial performance in the fully intact, closed-chest mouse. Left ventricular function was evaluated in euthyroid, hypothyroid, and hyperthyroid mice, animals with well-documented alterations in myocardial function. The mice were anesthetized and instrumented with polyethylene catheters in the right femoral artery and vein and with a Millar MIKRO-TIP transducer in the left ventricle via the right carotid artery. Structural and functional evidence suggested that the instrumentation procedure did not cause myocardial damage, valvular insufficiency, or aortic obstruction. Isovolumic indexes of myocardial contractility derived from the left ventricular pressure pulse and its first derivative demonstrated a 40% increase in contractility in the hyperthyroid animals and a 40% decrease in contractility in the hypothyroid animals. Similar differences in the indexes of relaxation were observed. Furthermore, isoproterenol dose-response relationships of these contractile parameters were blunted in the hypothyroid animals and augmented in the hyperthyroid animals compared with euthyroid control animals. Given the small size of the mouse and the high frequency of the cardiac cycle, these data demonstrate the feasibilty of combining a high-fidelity, microtip manometer with a high-speed data-acquisition system to obtain faithful recordings of cardiac performance in the fully intact mouse.", 
    "155": "The effect of nipradilol solution (KT-210) on aqueous flow was evaluated using fluorophotometry in 10 patients (6 primary open-angle glaucoma and 4 ocular hypertension) treated with timolol for more than one month. A single dose of 0.5% timolol was instilled into both eyes at 8 AM, and 0.25% KT-210 or placebo was instilled into both right and left eye at 11 AM; the treated eye was chosen randomly. Aqueous flow was measured every hour from 9 AM to 3 PM. There was no significant difference in pretreatment aqueous flow between the two eyes; 1.98 +/- 0.53 microliters/min in the KT-210 treated eyes, and 1.98 +/- 0.76 microliters/min in the placebo treated eyes. The flow measured 1 to 4 hours after KT-210 instillation was 1.66 +/- 0.69 microliters/min, 2.23 +/- 1.02 microliters/min, 2.20 +/- 0.67 microliters/min, and 1.68 +/- 0.64 microliters/min, respectively. This flow did not differ significantly from the flow in the placebo treated eyes (1.83 +/- 0.86 microliters/min, 1.79 +/- 0.69 microliters/min, 2.26 +/- 0.58 microliters/min, and 1.84 +/- 0.32 microliters/min)."
