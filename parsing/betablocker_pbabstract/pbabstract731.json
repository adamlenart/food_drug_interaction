    "0": "The cardiac electrophysiological effects of sotalol were studied in ten patients (pts) aged 20--65 years undergoing intracardiac stimulation studies for palpitations (7 pts) or dizzy spells (3 pts). The following measurements were made: 1. basic sinus cycle length (SCL): 2. SINUS NODE RECOVERY TIME (SNRT) following overdrive pacing; 3. intra-atrial (PA), atrio-His (AH) and His-ventricular (HV) conduction intervals during regular atrial pacing; 4. effective refractory periods of the atria (AERP), AV node (AVERP) and ventricular myocardium (VERP). AV nodal functional refractoriness (AVFRP) was also determined. All measurements were repeated 10--15 min after i.v. administration of 0.4 mg/kg of sotalol. Results were analysed by the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. Significant increases in SCL (p less than 0.01), AH (p less than 0.01). SNRT (p less than 0.01), AVERP (p less than 0.02) and AVFRP (p less than 0.01) were observed. These effects are consistent with the beta-blocking action of sotalol. The acute increase in AERP (p less than 0.01) is, however, not a common property of other beta-blockers and may be related to the 'class III' cellular effect of sotalol. These results are discussed in relationship to the electrophysiological effects of other beta-blocking drugs.", 
    "1": "The authors present detailed data about skin fibrosis appearing in hyperthyroidism treated by Sotalol and radioactive iodine. Cutaneous thickening is discovered quite rapidly when the patient is monitored daily (as in case 4). It is asymptomatic and no other features of scleroderma are found. Regression occurs within 4-10 months. Histologically, fibrosis is located in the entire dermis. Dermal appendages are normal and no inflammatory changes occur. No anomalies of collagen structure and fibroblasts have been observed ultrastructurally. Immunological studies (direct immunofluorescence of the skin, lymphocyte transformation and leucocyte migration tests with Sotalol) were normal. The mechanism is unknown, but an immunological or a toxic one is excluded; however a pharmacological action is possible. The role of other betablockers must be assessed by a randomised study.", 
    "2": "The responses of cervical spinal cord blood flow (C-SCBF) to alteration in respiration were examined in gallamine immobilized and respiration controlled cats. Alveolar PCO2 was continuously monitored with an infrared CO2 analyzer. Mean arterial blood pressure (BP) was measured through femoral canula, which also allowed collection of arterial samples for blood gas analysis. C-SCBF was measured using thermoelectrical element which placed on the dorsal surface of the C6 segment. Simultaneously, changes in blood flow of cerebral cortex, L4 segment of spinal cord, heart and skeletal muscles, skin, kidney and spleen were also measured and compared with that of C-SCBF. Cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFP) was also measured on C5 segment. Changes in the arterial or alveolar PCO2 increased about 20--30 mmHg following respiration arrest or 10% CO2 inhalation, and decreased about 20 mmHg following hyperventilation during 2 minutes, respectively. Respiratory arrest or 10% CO2 inhalation induced an increase in C-SCBF, and a rise in BP and CSFP. Hyperventilation induced a decrease in C-SCBF, a fall in BP and a rise in CSFP. Effect of the respiration on blood flow of cerebral cortex, L4 segment of spinal cord or heart muscle was similar to the effect on C-SCBF in direction, but that of skin, skeletal muscle, kidney or spleen was conversely. C-SCBF increase by respiratory arrest or 10% CO2 inhalation was incompletely suppressed by pretreatment of propranolol 7 mg/kg i.v., C-SCBF decrease by hyperventilation was also incompletely suppressed by pretreatment of phentolamine 5 mg/kg i.v.. Furthermore, these C-SCBF changes were almost completely suppressed by pretreatment of phentolamine 5 mg/kg, propranolol 7 mg/kg and acetazolamide 250 mg/kg i.v. These results suggest that response of C-SCBF to alteration in respiration is chiefly induced by changes in PCO2, that CO2 acts directly on vascular smooth muscle and also on alpha and beta adrenergic receptors in the cervical spinal cord, and that CO2 has a similar action on the C-SCBF as on the blood flow of cerebral cortex, lumbar spinal cord and heart muscle.", 
    "3": "Isolated dog hearts perfused with blood from a donor dogand driven at two heart rates were used to compare the effects of propranolol with those of its quaternary ammonium derivative on atrial, atrioventricular (AV) nodal, and His-Purkinje conduction. Propranolol slowed only AV-nodal conduction, increasing the minimal conduction time and the effect of prematurity, without affecting fatigue. Practolol did not have this effect. Dimethylpropranolol had similar but not identical effects on the AV node, but also slowed atrial and ventricular conduction. In contrast with the quaternary derivative of lidocaine, dimethylpropranolol's effect on atrial and ventricular conduction was not dependent on the heart rate. The effect of dimethylpropranolol on ventricular conduction was observed at doses lower than those reported by others to be antiarrhythmic.", 
    "4": "Effects of catecholamines were studied in vitro on different portions of the left coronary artery of the dog. Adrenaline, noradrenaline and isoprenaline produced dose-related contractions in the common portion of the coronary artery which were blocked by phenoxybenzamine. The proximal portions were relaxed by noradrenaline and isoprenaline, but contracted or relaxed by adrenaline following an initial transient contraction. The contraction was blocked by phenoxybenzamine and the relaxation was blocked by propranolol. Adrenaline, noradrenaline and isoprenaline caused only relaxations which were blocked by propranolol in the distal portion and in the small branches. In coronary, femoral and tracheal strips contracted previously by KCl with or without a phenoxybenzamine pretreatment, isoprenaline produced dose-dependent relaxations. The dose-response curves for isoprenaline were shifted to the right on treatment with practolol. The blocking effects of practolol were nearly ten times potent in the coronary artery in comparison with the femoral artery and the trachea. The results indicate that the common portion mainly possesses alpha-adrenoceptors, the proximal portion contains both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors, and that beta-adrenoceptors dominate in the distal portion and small artery branches. It is also shown that the beta-adrenoceptors in the coronary vessels differ from the femoral and tracheal beta-adrenoceptors in pharmacological feature.", 
    "5": "We have reproduced in vitro the diurnal cycles in levels of serotonin acetyltransferase activity found in the chick pineal gland in vivo. The more closely the lighting conditions of culture matched those under which the birds were raised, the closer was the similarity between cycles in levels of enzyme activity in vitro and in vivo. Repetitive cycles in levels of acetyltransferase activity persisted in culture for at least 4 days under a diurnal cycle of illumination, and at least 2 days in continuous darkness. When glands were explanted into culture in the light phase of a cycle, short periods of further exposure to light markedly stimulated subsequent increase of acetyltransferase in the dark (after a short lag). Prolonged exposure to light in culture markedly inhibited increase of enzyme activity. Cycles in the levels of enzyme activity in glands cultured under altered light cycles were regulated primarily by changes in illumination. However, the endogenous biological 'clock' remained at least partly entrained to the original light cycle. Increase of acetyltransferase activity in vitro was markedly stimulated by theophylline plus compound Ro. 20.1724 (4-(3-butoxy-4-methoxybenzyl)-2-imidazolidinone) under all lighting conditions. Kinetics (to the time of attaining maximum levels in situ) of the increase under diurnal lighting and in constant darkness were indistinguishable from those in vivo. A high concentration of dl-propranolol markedly stimulated an increase in acetyltransferase activity in glands cultured in constant darkness but had little effect on glands under diurnal lighting or continuous illumination.", 
    "6": "Comparisons were made of the acute cardiovascular effects of oxytetracycline, oxytetracycline in propylene glycol, and propylene glycol alone given to conscious dairy calves. The calves were chronically instrumented with intravascular catheters and electromagnetic flowmeter transducers in and on the pulmonary and renal arteries. Injection (IV) of aqueous preparations of oxytetracycline produced no statistically significant (P greater than 0.05) cardiocirculatory changes in these calves. Oxytetracycline in propylene glycol and propylene glycol alone both produced transient (1 to 4 minute) periods of cardiovascular depression characterized by cardiac asystole, systemic hypotension, and decreased pulmonary and renal arterial blood flow. The two preparations, in equivalent doses and volumes, produced statistically similar hemodynamic changes in the calves. The data from this study support the conclusion that the monitored cardiovascular effects of the commercially available oxytetracycline in propylene glycol in the intact, awake calves were due to the solvent propylene glycol. This conclusion is consistent with reports of other injectable products containing the same solvent.", 
    "7": "1 Goat isolated trachea contracted in response to carbachol, histamine and 2-pyridylethylamine (an H(1)-receptor agonist) and relaxed after application of isoprenaline. 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and phenylephrine.2 Mepyramine, a selective H(1)-receptor antagonist, blocked histamine- and 2-pyridylethylamine-induced contractions. In high doses it also exhibited some nonspecific antagonism to carbachol. After H(1)-receptor blockade, 4-methylhistamine and dimaprit (specific H(2)-agonists) relaxed the carbachol-contracted trachea.3 Propranolol, a beta-adrenoceptor blocker, antagonized relaxation in response to isoprenaline and phenylephrine. In high doses, it produced a reversal of the phenylephrine response.4 Indomethacin enhanced contractions in response to carbachol and histamine.5 Relaxation to 5-HT was not affected by propranolol, indomethacin, metiamide or cimetidine (H(2)-blockers). These findings appear to exclude the involvement of adrenergic, prostaglandinergic and H(2)-histaminergic mechanisms in the mediation of this response.6 Atropine potentiated 5-HT-induced relaxations. This suggests the participation of a ;masked' excitatory cholinergic mechanism.7 Methysergide, dibenamine and dibenzyline selectively antagonized or reversed 5-HT-induced relaxation. Dibenamine and dibenzyline enhanced relaxations to isoprenaline.8 This investigation showed (i) a relaxant response of goat trachea to 5-HT, mediated via D-muscular tryptamine receptors; (ii) a small population of excitatory M-neuronal tryptamine and alpha-adrenoceptors; and (iii) predominance of H(1)-histamine receptors in the goat trachea.", 
    "8": "1 Somatostatin (SS) was evaluated as a chronotropic and inotropic agent in isolated spontaneously beating auricles of rats, rabbits and guinea-pigs.2 SS was completely inactive in rat and rabbit auricles but exerted a dose-dependent, negative inotropic effect in guinea-pig auricles in concentrations between 1.5 x 10(-8) to 1.2 x 10(-6) M.3 The negative inotropic effect of SS (6.0 x 10(-8) and 3.0 x 10(-7) M) was not inhibited by a mixture of antagonists containing practolol (7.9 x 10(-6) M), phentolamine (3.5 x 10(-7) M), methysergide (2.8 x 10(-7) M), diphenhydramine (3.9 x 10(-5) M), cimetidine (4.0 x 10(-5) M) atropine (3.4 x 10(-7) M) and indomethacin (1.4 x 10(-5) M).4 The negative inotropic effect of SS was greatly potentiated by reduction in the Ca(2+) concentration of the medium from 5.0 to 1.25 mM.5 On a molar basis, SS was equipotent with acetylcholine (ACh) as a negative inotropic agent in the guinea-pig auricles.6 SS (6.0 x 10(-8) and 6.0 x 10(-7) M) was found to inhibit selectively the positive inotropic action of neurotensin (NT) in guinea-pig but not in rat auricles.7 The inhibitory action of SS against NT was independent of its negative inotropic action.8 These results suggest that SS produces its negative inotropic action by interacting with specific receptors presumably located in the cell membrane of guinea-pig atria. The interaction between SS and its receptor may cause a decreased Ca(2+) diffusion and/or transport into the atrial cells. The physiological and pharmacological significance of these results is discussed.", 
    "9": "1 The injection of dopamine (100 to 500 microgram) into the cerebral ventricles (i.c.v.) of 10 unanaesthetized dogs produced a dose-dependent increase in arterial blood pressure and heart rate. The dogs licked, swallowed, sometimes vomited and became sedated. 2 Autonomic ganglion blockade with hexamethonium (10 mg/kg i.v.) abolished cardiovascular responses to i.c.v. dopamine, indicating that dopamine was exerting its effect within the central nervous system. 3 The dopamine receptor antagonists, haloperidol (500 microgram), chlorpromazine (200 micrograms) and ergometrine (500 micrograms), each given i.c.v., sugsequently abolished the cardiovascular responses to dopamine. 4 Pretreatment with either the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol (600 microgram) or the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist, phentolamine (1 mg) given i.c.v. had no significant effect on the response to dopamine. 5 It is suggested that dopamine injected into the cerebral ventricles of the unanesthetized dog causes hypertension and tachycardia by activating central dopamine receptors.", 
    "10": "1 The effects of methacholine, atropine and adrenoceptor blockade on hypothalamic blood flow (HBF) were measured in conscious rabbits. 2 A dose of 1 microgram methacholine increased HBF while smaller and larger doses had no significant effect. 3 The vasodilatation induced by methacholine was blocked by atropine and by chemical sympathectomy of the hypothalamus with 6-hydroxydopamine. 4 The vasodilatation was reversed by propranolol but was not affected by phenoxybenzamine. 5 These results suggest that the vasodilator action of muscarinic receptor agonists on hypothalamic resistance vessels depends upon the integrity of a noradrenergic system, and is mediated via beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "11": "1. The effects of topically administered atenolol 4% and adrenaline 1% on intraocular pressure (IOP) were investigated in fourteen healthy male human volunteers. Both the sole and combined effects of single doses of the formulations were recorded over a 7 h period. 2. Adrenaline and atenolol both produced significant reductions in IOP when compared to the placebo control, although the pattern of response differed. 3. Adrenaline had a rapid onset of action, resulting in a significant pressure reduction by 45 min post drug administration. A small upswing in IOP then occurred between 45 and 90 min, followed by a prolonged secondary reduction phase. 4. Atenolol produced a gradual reduction in IOP which reached a maximum at 180 min post drug administration and subsequently declined between 300 and 420 min. 5. Combined treatment with atenolol and adrenaline resulted in additive effects up to 180 min, and the early pressure upswing recorded with adrenaline was completely abolished. 6. The results are compatible with the hypothesis that beta 1-adrenoceptor stimulation elevates intraocular pressure. The correlation of these results with relevant animal and human pharmacological data is discussed.", 
    "12": "1. The pharmacokinetics of intravenous and oral atenolol (50 mg) in six healthy volunteers was studied. Plasma, saliva and urine were collected up to 24 h after each dose. 2. There was no significant difference in atenolol half-life when administered by the two routes. Bioavailability of the orally administered atenolol was 50%. 3. Atenolol levels in saliva required about 2 h to reach equilibrium with plasma drug levels. 4. A comparison between the pharmacokinetics and pharmacology of atenolol was made in twelve healthy subjects. 5. Dose-independent pharmacokinetics were observed. Reductions in resting heart rate and arterial blood pressure were proportional to either the logarithm of dose or area under the plasma concentration time curve or cumulative urinary atenolol excretion. 6. Plasma elimination half-life in five subjects with renal failure was prolonged.", 
    "13": "1. The plasma levels and the urinary excretion of hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) have been studied after administration of single doses of 12.5 and 25 mg of the drug in solution and in combination with 100 mg of the selective beta 1-adrenoreceptor antagonist metoprolol in a rapidly dissolving tablet. 2. Metoprolol did not significantly influence the bioavailability or the time-course of HCT. 3. HCT had no significant effect on the time-course or the plasma levels of metoprolol. The average half-life, 4.4 +/- 0.9 h, is about the same as previously observed for separate doses of this drug. 4. It seems unlikely that repeated doses of the combination product studied will lead to biopharmaceutic or pharmacokinetic interactions of clinical importance.", 
    "14": "1. Plasma concentrations and heart rate and blood pressure effects of 160 mg oxprenolol as standard rapid release (RR) and slow release (SR) tablets were compared in healthy volunteers. Peak plasma concentrations were lower with SR tablets than with RR tablets and the peak was delayed. 2. Absorption of oxprenolol was described adequately by first order kinetics with both preparations. The apparent half-life of absorption was 0.40 h with RR and 2.4 h for the SR formulation. The apparent elimination half-life of oxprenolol was about 2 h. Relative bioavailabilities of the two formulations were similar. 3. The effectiveness of oxprenolol RR and SR were assessed by their effects on heart rate in severe exercise (EHR) and also by their effects on blood pressure at rest and during exercise. 4. Maximum reductions in these variables coincided with peak oxprenolol concentrations. The effects on EHR and blood pressure parameters had a distinct time course but there was no difference between the time course of inhibition of each variable for the two formulations over 24 h.", 
    "15": "We have compared the effects of a solution of acid--citrate--dextrose (ACD) with those of a solution of citrate--phosphate--dextrose (CPD), infused at equal rates, on blood calcium ion concentration and different indices of haemodynamic performance in 17 dogs. The influence of beta adrenergic blockade on these changes was examined. The effects of ACD and CPD were studied in five dogs and were similar. Peripheral vascular changes were the principal cause of arterial hypotension. In six dogs, propranolol 0.5 mg kg-1 intensified the hypocalcaemia-induced left ventricular dysfunction.", 
    "16": "In 35 patients aged 18 to 69 years (mean 48) with clinical, electrocardiographic, or electrophysiological evidence of normal sinus node function, the effect of intravenous propranolol (0.1 mg/kg) was assessed on 3 indices of sinus node function. The drug significantly prolonged sinus node cycle length (12%), slightly prolonged the corrected sinus node recovery time (15%), and slightly but insignificantly lengthened sinuatrial conduction time. Propranolol may be administered safely in patients with normal sinus node function without the fear of producing severe sinus bradycardia, sinuatrial block, sinuatrial pauses, or prolonged sinus asystole, after spontaneous or stimulation-induced conversion of a tachycardia.", 
    "17": "To assess the effects of intravenously administered acebutolol (1-20 mg every 4 hours for 24 hours) on cardiac rhythm and performance, we studied 72 patients with evolving myocardial infarction. Twenty-five patients were treated with acebutolol beginning 6 hours after the first increase in the level of plasma creatine kinase. Enzymatically estimated infarct size was compared with that of 25 controls matched for predicted infarct size. Observed infarct sizes were not significantly different in the 2 groups (37 +/- 5 and 30 +/- 5 CK-gram equivalents, respectively). Mean heart rate, diastolic blood pressure, and cardiac output declined from control values during treatment with acebutolol, but remained within the normal range. Mean pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary artery occlusive pressure were unchanged. In a group of 22 treated patients matched with 22 control subjects for frequency of ventricular extrasystoles, acebutolol effected a prompt reduction in frequencies of ventricular extrasystoles and repetitive arrhythmias, whereas values were not significantly changed in controls during the corresponding intervals. Accordingly, acebutolol may be a useful antiarrhythmic agent in selected patients with acute myocardial infarction with adversely altering haemodynamic stability or enzymatically estimated infarct size.", 
    "18": "Cardiac and renal effects (measured as the reduction in exercise-induced tachycardia and PRA, respectively) and circulating drug concentrations after acute beta blockade with intravenous pindolol were compared between seven normal volunteers and six patients with terminal renal failure. Kinetic parameters were similar in both groups (total body clearance, 450 mg/min), indicating enhanced extrarenal elimination in patients. For any given drug concentration, however, the uremic patients responded to beta blockade with a greater decrease in pulse rate than did normal volunteers (P less than 0.001). Moreover, in the same group, the decrease of PRA was more marked (from 13.3 to 5.7 vs. 3.3 to 1.9 ng/ml/hr) and lasted longer (8 hours and more vs. 2 hours). Plasma aldosterone remained unchanged. These data reveal an increased dependency of both heart rate and renin release on beta adrenergic-mediated mechanisms in uremic man. They also show that kinetic findings in normal subjects cannot always be extrapolated to predict kinetic behavior in disease, and that similar kinetics do not imply similar effectiveness.", 
    "19": "There are conflicting reports on the effect of insulin on plasma Ca concentration in rats. Low doses appear to decrease and higher doses to increase plasma Ca. Since birds are known to be very sensitive to parathyroid hormone and have resistance to the hypoglycemic effects of insulin, the effect of commercial and highly purified insulin on plasma Ca concentration was studied in 10-day-old chicks 60 min after the administration of the hormone. Both commerical bovine and purified porcine insulin provoked a dose-related elevation of plasma Ca. Although hypophosphatemia was observed with the highest dose of insulin used (0.4U), hypercalcemia was observed with 0.05 U insulin, a dose that did not modify plasma phosphate concentration. The slopes of the dose-response curves of insulin and parathyroid hormone were indistinguishable and different from that of 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3. Neither propranolol nor deprivation of vitamin D altered the hypercalcemic response to insulin. Unexpectedly, propranolol (40 microgram/chick) provoked elevation of plasma Ca. It is concluded that insulin raises plasma Ca concentration in the chick by a mechanism(s) not yet elucidated.", 
    "20": "Experiments were performed to assess the responsiveness of vessels subserving bone tissue to nerve stimulation and to exogenously administered catecholamines and acetylcholine. Tibias of mongrel dogs were isolated and dissected free; the periosteum was left intact. The main nutrient artery was prepared and cannulated. Ring electrodes were placed around the artery. The preparation was perfused at constant flow with aerated (95% O2 - 5% CO2) Krebs-Ringer solution (37 degrees C) by means of a roller pump. The perfusion pressure was continuously recorded. For each preparation, the flow rate was used at which the response to a standard dose of norepinephrine was the largest. Periarterial electrical stimulation caused frequency-dependent increases in perfusion pressure; because these responses were blocked by phentolamine, they must be due to activation of sympathetic nerves. Injections of norepinephrine caused dose-dependent increases in perfusion pressure that were abolished by phentolamine. Acetylcholine caused dose-dependent, atropine-sensitive decrease of the constrictions caused by norepinephrine infusions. These experiments demonstrate that the isolated perfused tibia of the dog is a satisfactory preparation to investigate the direct effects of sympathetic nerve stimulation and naturally occurring vasoactive amines on bone blood vessels.", 
    "21": "The steady-state disposition of propranolol and its total metabolites was measured after 6 day continuous subcutaneous (1 mg/kg/day) or intracerebroventricular (i.c.v., 0.01 and 1 mg/kg/day) infusion of dl-[3H]propranolol with osmotic minipumps in spontaneously hypertensive rats. After 2 days daily excretion of total radioactivity was 70% or more of the total dose infused each day. Steady-state plasma concentrations (day 3 and 6) of propranolol and its total metabolites did not differ significantly during subcutaneous or i.c.v. infusion of 1 mg/kg/day. During i.c.v. infusion with 0.01 mg/kg/day these concentrations were only 0.01 to 0.02 times as high. Propranolol and its total metabolite concentrations did not differ significantly in peripheral tissues during subcutaneous or i.c.v. infusion of 1 mg/kg/day, whereas brain propranolol concentrations were 40- to 600-fold higher during i.c.v. infusion. During i.c.v. infusion with 0.001 mg/kg/day, peripheral propranolol and total metabolite concentrations were only 0.003 to 0.02 times those following 1 mg/kg/day. Brain propranolol concentrations after 0.01 mg/kg/day i.c.v. were in the same range as those following 1 mg/kg/day subcutaneously. The data suggest that the osmotic minipump is a useful tool for creating and maintaining a steady-state for propranolol in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Moreover, by i.c.v. placement of the pump outlet the brain can be selectively perfused with this agent for a prolonged period of time.", 
    "22": "The elimination of propranolol by perfused livers of rats made cirrhotic by chronic carbon tetrachloride inhalation during phenobarbital treatment has been compared with control animals receiving only phenobarbital. Cirrhosis reduced propranolol clearance at a constant flow of 20 ml/min from 1.43 +/- 0.08 to 1.12 +/- 0.08 ml/min/g liver (P less than 0.025). In addition, an increase in intrahepatic shunting of 15-micron microspheres from 0.41 +/- 0.01 to 9.4 +/- 4.1% was found in cirrhotic livers (P less than 0.05). Finally, in cirrhotic livers, reducing blood flow did not produce the normal rise in hepatic extraction ratio, which actually fell from 0.873 +/- 0.021 at 20 ml/min to 0.836 +/- 0.025 at 15 ml/min and 0.823 +/- 0.026 at 10 ml/min. At each flow the observed extraction was significantly lower than that predicted to result from a reduced enzyme activity alone, consistent with the development of functionally significant intrahepatic shunts. An operational model is proposed that explains impaired drug metabolism in cirrhosis on the basis of the development of intrahepatic shunts which perfuse nonfunctioning tissue, while the remaining blood flow is exposed to a reduced mass of hepatocytes with an apparently normal amount of drug metabolizing enzyme (the intact hepatocyte theory).", 
    "23": "Nine patients on chronic treatment with propranolol for essential hypertension for 3 months or longer were studied after abrupt discontinuation of the drug. Each patient demonstrated transient supersensitivity to the chronotropic effects of isoproterenol, beginning 2--6 days (median 4 days) after propranolol withdrawal, lasting for 3--13 days (median 6 days), with the maximum sensitivity on day 6. A significantly lower dose of isoproterenol was necessary to increase heart rate 25 beats/min on day 6 (median dose 1.2 microgram, range 0.3--3.4 microgram) compared with after day 14, when sensitivity had stabilized (median dose 2.3 microgram, range 1.4--7.6 microgram). Six patients had transient symptoms (headache, chest pain, palpitations and sweating) after abrupt propranolol withdrawal, coinciding with supersensitivity to isoproterenol in five. Transient increases in plasma catecholamines and blood pressures and sustained increases in heart rate occurred during the period of isoproterenol supersensitivity in most patients, and may have contributed to symptoms noted. The delayed onset and potentially long duration of beta-adrenergic supersensitivity after abrupt propranolol withdrawal have important clinical implications.", 
    "24": "To evaluate the ability of histamine to induce ventricular arrhythmias, we studied the effects of histamine on ventricular rhythmicity in the isolated guinea pig heart with complete atrioventricular conduction block. As a function of dose (0.1-30 microgram), histamine enhanced the idioventricular rate by increasing the rate of firing of the original pacemaker and also by causing the sudden appearance of faster idioventricular rhythms that coincided with changes in pacemaker site. Anaphylaxis in the isolated guinea pig heart with complete atrioventricular conduction block caused histamine release and acceleration of idioventricular rate. The effects of histamine on idioventricular rhythmicity were not attenuated by the histamine H1 receptor antagonist chlorpheniramine, but were antagonized by the H2 receptor antagonist cimetidine. Moreover, the selective H2 agonist 4-methylhistamine (4MeH) accelerated the idioventricular rate, whereas 2-(2-thiazolyl) ethylamine (ThEA), at doses selective for H1 receptor activation, did not. The effects of histamine on idioventricular rhythmicity were not modified by the beta-adrenergic blocker pindolol. The mechanism by which histamine increases idioventricular rate probably involves two components: (1) an enhancement in automaticity of the original pacemaker, and (2) the induction of faster rhythms via reentry and/or afterdepolarizations. Whatever the mechanism, both components of the ventricular chronotropic action of histamine appear to involve exclusively histamine receptors of the H2 type. Thus, our results suggest that H2 receptor antagonists may have a role as specific antiarrhythmic agents in the treatment of cardiac dysfunctions caused by histamine release.", 
    "25": "Twenty-one patients, mean age 60.3 years, with stable angina pectoris earlier treated with beta-blockers, were investigated with standardized exercise tests to evaluate the action of nifedipine alone and in combination with a beta-blocker. The first exercise test was performed 3 weeks after treatment with the patient's usual beta-blocker. Following this, the patients were tested twice after a double-blind cross-over 3-week trial with nifedipine and placebo. The patients were subsequently treated for 3 weeks with nifedipine 10 mg 3 times daily or placebo and then performed an exercise test. During the 4th period of 3 weeks the patients took a combination of nifedipine, 10 mg 3 times daily, and their usual beta-blocker and then performed the final exercise test. Nifedipine alone raised the heart rate by 5 beats/min at rest and diminished the systolic blood pressure at rest by 17 mm Hg. During exercise at comparable load the heart rate did not change significantly, but the systolic blood pressure decreased with 22 mm Hg. The exercise tolerance expressed as total work increased on a average by 20%, range-14 - + 194%. Nifedipine in combination with a beta-blocker gave a further decrease in the systolic blood pressure, totally 37 mm Hg at comparable load. The exercise tolerance increased more, totally by an average of 41%. There was a significant correlation between basal values for systolic blood pressure registered during the placebo period at rest and the percentage change in total work. The atrioventricular conduction time did not change significantly compared to placebo during treatment with nifedipine or the combination nifedipine + beta-blocker. No serious side-effects were observed during the study.", 
    "26": "While rheumatoid-factor-producing haemolytic plaque-forming cells (RF--PFC) of the human peripheral blood were easily inhibited by cycloheximide, mouse spleen cells immune to sheep red cells (anti-SRC PFC) were inhibited only after prolonged preincubation in the drug. The RF--PFC were easily inhibited by propranolol, while the anti-SRC PFC were not at all inhibited. Vinblastine inhibited both systems equally. These differences are taken to suggest that the RF--PFC have very little preformed antibody in them and therefore depend upon active protein synthesis for their demonstration. In contrast, anti-SRC PFC, which may be predominantly mature plasma cells, generally need no new protein synthesis for their demonstration because of increased quantities of preformed antibody. A possible mechanism is that RF--PFC may represent primarily RF-specific B cells, the RF of which is released by surface immunoglobulin shedding and therefore susceptible to membrane stabilising agents such as propranolol.", 
    "27": "We compared the ability of the vasodilator prostaglandins PGI2, PGE2, and 13,14-dihydro PGE2 to release renin when infused into the denervated, nonfiltering canine kidney in vivo. Papaverine was used as a nonprostaglandin vasodilator. All the prostaglandins tested were capable of stimulating renin secretion, with the scale of potency being 13,14-dihydro PGE2 greater than PGI2 greater than PGE2; papaverine had no effect on renin secretion. These results indicate that both PGE2 and PGI2 can stimulate renin secretion but that vasodilation per se is not a stimulus. 13,14-Dihydro PGE2 was included because it is a poorer substrate than PGE2, both for transport into cells and catabolism to inactive products, but has comparable potency to PGE2 when tested in systems with limited ability to catabolize PGE2. The fact that 13,14-dihydro PGE2 was the most potent prostaglandin tested suggests that the effects of PGE2 in our system are reduced by the kidneys' recognized ability to extract and catabolize PGE2. Since PGI2 is less avidly metabolized than PGE2 by the kidney, the differences in observed potency between PGE2 and PGI2 could be largely the result of differences in renal catabolism of the two prostaglandins rather than differences in intrinsic potency. Therefore, both PGE2 and PGI2 are candidates for the endogenous prostaglandin responsible for stimulating renin secretion.", 
    "28": "The isthmic portion of human Fallopian tubes was excised during surgery and the ampullary-isthmic junction was identified. The external, longitudinal and the inner, circular muscle layers of this structure were then mechanically separated. The contractile activity of thin strips from these layers was studied isometrically in organ bath experiments. Administration of various adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists revealed that the responses of the longitudinal smooth muscle are primarily mediated by alpha-adrenoceptors while there is a marked dominance of beta-adrenoceptor-mediated effects in the circular layer. Transmural nerve stimulation to those caused by exogenous noradrenaline, although nerve-mediated inhibition of circular muscle activity was not abolished entirely by propranolol, atropine or guanethidine, but by tetradotoxine, indicating the existence of a hitherto unknown non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic, inhibitory neurogenic mechanism. The results support the concept of a specific sphincter-like function controlling ovum transport at the human oviductal isthmus, and that this sphincter may be controlled by both adrenergic nerves and nerves liberating an unidentified transmitter substance.", 
    "29": "Regional and total blood flow and O2 uptake (VO2) were measured in 10 anesthetized paralyzed dogs in which venous outflow from the left hindlimb (less paw) was directed through the femoral vein. After being ventilated on room air during a 40-min control period, they were ventilated on 12.0% O2 for 40 min, 9.2% O2 for 40 min, and again on room air for 40 min. A second group of 10 was treated the same after they were given 1.0 mg/kg propranolol to block beta-adrenergic receptors. Neither limb blood flow nor cardiac output changed significantly during moderate hypoxia in either group; both increased in severe hypoxia but only in the no-beta-block group. Limb VO2 was not decreased significantly in either group during moderate hypoxia but total VO2 was decreased in the beta-block group. Total VO2 was decreased in both groups during severe hypoxia but limb VO2 was maintained in the beta-block group. beta-Block prevented the fall in total and limb peripheral resistance seen in severe hypoxia but did not alter the consistently more efficient utilization of total O2 delivery shown by the limb in comparison to the whole body by higher O2 extraction ratios and lower venous O2 pressure. beta-Vasodilator receptors evidently played an active part in the vasodilatation seen during severe hypoxia.", 
    "30": "Cumulative log dose-response curves of soterenol, isoproterenol, phenylephrine and norepinephrine on isolated pregnant rat uterus at different days of gestation, were investigated. Soterenol produced a sustained inhibition of spontaneous motility during the whole pregnancy and this effect was blocked by butoxamine. The affinity of myometrium for the beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist was parallel to the concentration of progesterone in plasma during pregnancy. Isoproterenol, norepinephrine and phenylephrine caused dual, alpha- and beta-mediated responses, their relative dominance varied with the concentration and the days of pregnancy, alpha-Adrenoceptor effects of the amines coincided with increased plasma concentrations of estrogens, whereas beta ones were in parallel with the increment of plasma progesterone. It is concluded that: (a) there exist in the pregnant rat uterus beta 2-receptor-mediated responses influenced by the length of gestation; and (b) the concentration-pregnancy-dependent biphasic actions of isoproterenol, norepinephrine or phenylephrine suggest that their variable hormone-modulated ability interacts with both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptive uterine sites.", 
    "31": "Adrenoceptor-mediated responses of the cardiovascular system during propylthiouracil-induced hypothyroidism were investigated. Interfering nervous reflexes could be circumvented by using pithed rats. Cardiac beta-adrenoceptor-mediated acceleration of heart rate following electrical stimulation or injection of noradrenaline and isoprenaline was markedly diminished even after 2 weeks of treatment. This loss of beta-sensitivity prevented the study of possible changes of presynaptic regulatory adrenoceptors in this test model. Taking the increase in diastolic blood pressure after application of alpha-agonists as index of the sensitivity of vascular alpha-adrenoceptors we found these to have been desensitized in the hypothyroid state. According to these results the lack of thyroid hormones exerted a similar effect on cardiac beta- and on vascular alpha-adrenoceptors.", 
    "32": "In the supernatant (30,000 x g) of frog erythrocyte homogenates, by using gel filtration we detected a protein that could bind [(3)H]dihydroalprenolol ([(3)H]DHA) with high affinity. This binding was greatly enhanced when the erythrocytes were preincubated with (-)-isoproterenol. After various periods of incubation with (-)-isoproterenol, the extent of the increase in the density of [(3)H]DHA binding sites in the cytosol was paralleled by a proportional decrease in the number of [(3)H]DHA binding sites in the corresponding pellet; both events peaked after 2-3 hr of incubation with (-)-isoproterenol. The K(a) of the (-)-isoproterenol-induced increase in [(3)H]DHA binding in cytosol and the decrease in this binding in the membrane ranged between 60 and 90 nM. The changes in the cytosol and particulate [(3)H]DHA binding sites were independent of RNA and protein synthesis. The increase in cytosol binding elicited by (-)-isoproterenol was blocked by exposure of the cells to (-)-alprenolol which per se failed to change the cytosol binding of [(3)H]DHA. Scatchard analysis revealed that the enhanced [(3)H]DHA binding to cytosol material was due to a 4-fold increase in the B(max) with little or no change in K(d) ( approximately 9 nM). Binding displacement data show that these soluble [(3)H]DHA binding sites resemble the surface membrane recognition sites. Moreover, the ability of various beta-adrenergic agents to increase [(3)H]DHA binding to cytosol after they were incubated with frog erythrocytes paralleled their affinity for membrane-bound beta receptors. These findings support the view that the beta-adrenergic receptor desensitization caused by prolonged exposure to (-)-isoproterenol is due, at least in part, to an internalization of the recognition site of beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "33": "We carried out the present studies to determine whether the suppression of plasma renin activity (PRA) that follows inhibition of prostaglandin (PG) synthesis can be dissociated from the sodium-retaining effects of these drugs. In an initial investigation we studied the effect of indomethacin on PRA in normal subjects in balance on a 10 mM Na+ diet to prevent Na+ retention. Under these experimental conditions indomethacin did not lower PRA even though the fatty acid cyclooxygenase was inhibited, as indicated by a greater than 70% reduction in the major urinary metabolite of prostaglandin E (PGE-M). Sodium depletion leads to enhanced sympathetic activity. We therefore studied the effect of indomethacin on a group of subjects in 10 mM Na+ balance in whom the effect of increased beta-sympathetic activity was blocked by the administration of propranolol. In this group, indomethacin caused 65% suppression of PGE-M and had no effect on Na+ balance, but reversibly reduced PRA in the supine and upright positions by 84% and 70%, respectively. In normal subjects in 10 mM Na+ balance, the isoproterenol-induced increase in PRA also was unaffected by indomethacin. These data establish that inhibition of the cyclooxygenase can result in a reduction of PRA that is independent of changes in Na+ balance or beta-sympathetic tone.", 
    "34": "Cardiovascular 'reactivity' to graded splanchnic nerve stimulation was compared in adult spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive controls (NCR), during abolished adrenal medullary secretion and neurogenic cardiac control and depressed reflex vascular adjustments. Arterial pressure, heart rate and cardiac output were measured, and total peripheral resistance (TPR) and stroke volume (SV) computed before, during and after nerve stimulation. The neurogenic resistance increases in the major gastrointestinal-renal-hepatic circuits expressed themselves as TPR elevations, which were much accentuated in SHR. This reflects an increased w/ri of SHR resistance vessels rather than any altered effector sensitivity, since the responses were particularly accentuated at high discharge rates when noradrenaline junction concentrations approach maximal levels. The splanchnic capacitance responses expressed themselves as SV increases, being the most relevant aspect of capacitance control. SV increased less in SHR, mainly reflecting the reduced diastolic compliance of the hypertrophied SHR left ventricle and the consequent rightward shift of its Frank-Starling curve. The results indicate that an elevated resistance may well be maintained by a normal sympathetic discharge in established SHR hypertension. There seems, however, to be an increasing need for accentuated discharge to the capacitance side to maintain proper cardiac filling of the hypertrophied left ventricle.", 
    "35": "The cardiovascular and adrenergic responses to cigarette smoking during acute selective and non-selective beta adrenoceptor blockade were studied in seven young healthy volunteers in a double blind cross-over fashion. Heart rate, arterial blood pressure, forearm blood flow and plasma levels of adrenaline and noradrenaline were determined before and during the terminal 5 min period of 15 min smoking test. During smoking, plasma concentrations of adrenaline increased markedly and evenly by approximately 0.3 ng/ml in all three experimental sessions. Plasma concentrations of noradrenaline remained unchanged. Propranolol, a non-selective beta blocker, caused a marked rise in diastolic and mean blood pressure and forearm vascular resistance during smoking. This response was not seen in the control series or after selective beta-1 blockage with atenolol. This difference is attributable to propranolol's blockade of adrenaline's vasodilating effect mediated by beta-2 receptors in the resistance vessels. Furthermore, atenolol attenuated the systolic blood pressure and tachycardiac responses induced by cigarette smoking by comparison with placebo. This study suggests that selective beta-1 blockers are preferable in the management of patients who are habitual smokers.", 
    "36": "One thousand forty-five spontaneous episodes of S-T segment elevation were observed in three patients over a total of 72 days of continuous electrocardiographic monitoring. Eighty-nine percent of episodes were asymptomatic; chest pain tended to occur with episodes longer than 3 minutes, and ventricular ectopy occurred almost exclusively with symptomatic episodes. Nitroglycerin regularly relieved angina or S-T elevation, or both. Plasma and urinary catecholamines and their metabolites were normal. Episodes of variant angina were not associated with a generalized increase in sympathetic outflow because serum catecholamine levels at the onset and termination of the S-T abnormalities were not elevated. Controlled trials of propranolol showed no significant beneficial effect. Propranolol significantly increased the length of episodes of S-T elevation in one patient, increasing ventricular irritability. The overall course of variant angina was quite variable, with spontaneous and long-lasting remissions, necessitating cautions interpretation of clinical trials.", 
    "37": "In 64 patients treated with timolol eye drops (0.25% and 0.50%) seven patients developed transitory sensation of dry eyes. Two of these subjects also had xerostomia. Conjunctival and corneal defects were disclosed simultaneously with rose bengal staining. Morphologically, some of these lesions might have the same appearance as of the early stages of kerato-conjunctivitis sicca. A reduction of Schirmer test and break-up time was noted. The duration of symptoms ranged from 3 to 13 days. The mean time of treatment at the d\u00e9but of symptoms was 30 weeks (range 23--43 weeks). A pathogenesis of these seemingly harmless findings is at the present obscure. In none of our patients was the treatment discontinued and the symptoms did not reappear.", 
    "38": "Eleven patients were studied while taking the beta blocker acebutolol for a period ranging from 12 to more than 24 wk. Control titers for fluorescent antinuclear antibody (ANA) were obtained in all. Serial testing was performed over the duration of the therapy and following its discontinuation. Additional immunologic testing was performed in most patients. The patients were observed closely for the development of clinical autoimmune disease. Using a sensitive assay, fluorescent ANA developed in 8 of 9 patients with negative values in the control period. In no patient has evidence of clinical autoimmune disease developed. In general, the titers of ANA tended to rise with increasing duration of therapy and decline after its discontinuation. Positive lupus erythematosus cell preparations were also observed in several patients. These data suggest that autoantibodies are frequently induced by acebutolol and, although no evidence of clinical autoimmune disease has been reported, immunologic surveillance is warranted.", 
    "39": "Effects of palytoxin (PTX) on isolated papillary muscles of guinea pigs were studied in an attempt to elucidate the mechanical and electrical activities. Inotropic effects of PTX above 3 x 10(-9) g/ml; an early positive inotropic effect, slowly developing contracture accompanied by decline in phasic tension, appearance of aftercontractions and arrhythmias at high doses. The positive inotropic effect of PTX was enhanced in high Ca2+ medium but was not modified by propranolol. PTX induced a sustained depolarization and decrease in the amplitude, upstroke velocity and duration of action potential. During development of depolarization, arrhythmias occurred, which lasted for 5--10 min and reappeared 30--60 min after. Oscillatory afterpotential often appeared. Neither reserpine nor practolol prevented the PTX-induced arrhythmia while propranolol prevented it. Tetrodotoxin slowed the development of depolarization due to PTX and inhibited PTX-arrhythmias. In low Na+ medium, PTX exerted fewer effects on resting and action potentials and produced no arrhythmia. The results suggest that PTX-induced depolarization is responsible for the generation of contracture and arrhythmia and that the depolarization is due to the change in membrane Na permeability.", 
    "40": "A newly synthesized compound, 6-ethyl-3-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)chromone (AA-344) given intravenously or orally inhibited considerably the 72-hr passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (72-hr PCA) induced by IgE in rats. The antiallergic action of AA-344 was neither due to the antihistamine or antiserotonin effect nor was it mediated via adrenergic mechanisms. The results obtained in a double sensitization with two IgE antibodies suggest that AA-344 may not impair antigen-antibody combination but probably prevents the release of chemical mediators including histamine. This assumption was supported by observation that AA-344 inhibited a reduction in the skin histamine content caused by the 72-hr PCA, without effect on the compound 48/80-induced histamine reduction. AA-344 also partially inhibited the IgGa-mediated 3-hr PCA in rats. These results indicate that the inhibitory action of AA-344 on the immediate hypersensitivity reactions is due to prevention of the release of chemical mediators from the mast cells, by acting on some process in sequential events leading to the mediator release following antigen-antibody combination.", 
    "41": "The influence of noradrenergic mechanisms on the effects of D- and L-amphetamine on lordosis behavior and stereotype activity was studied in ovariectomized estrogen + progesterone treated rats. Phenoxybenzamine, phentolamine and prazosin, which all block alpha-adrenergic receptors potentiated the inhibitory effect of D-amphetamine on lordosis behavior. Phenoxybenzamine and prazosin also potentiated the effect of L-amphetamine, while phentolamine did not increase the effect. No augmented effect of D- or L-amphetamine was obtained on stereotype activity after pretreatment with phenoxybenzamine or phentolamine. L-propranolol, which blocks beta-adrenergic receptors and pimozide, a dopamine receptor blocker did not influence the effect of D- or L-amphetamine on lordosis behavior. Clonidine an alpha-receptor stimulant drug inhibited lordosis response in estrogen treated rats. This is probably due to a presynaptic effect, decreasing the release of NA from nerve terminals. The possibility that D- and L-amphetamine activates a NA system which influences lordosis behavior either by a direct facilitation or by decreasing the activity of an inhibitory serotonergic system is discussed.", 
    "42": "Superior cervical ganglion stimulation significantly increases both, flow and amylase activity of saliva. Stimulation provokes two markedly different periods of flow: during the first half, flow is very high and differs significantly from the flow of the second half which closely resembles the one previous to stimulation. Alpha-adrenergic blocking agents, when administered intravenously, abolish the hypersecretion induced by sympathetic stimulation; beta-adrenergic blocking agents do not. These facts strengthen the hypothesis that alpha-adrenoceptors are most important in fluid secretion. The infusion of epinephrine acts similarly on cervical ganglion stimulation, but it differs because of its more diffuse effects and deeper cardiovascular alterations. Isoproterenol, after a long latency period, slightly increases salivary flow, which seemingly indicates that beta-adrenoceptors are involved in the fluid secretory processes although in a lesser degree than alpha-adrenoceptors.", 
    "43": "The surface activity at the air-solution interface of a series of beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents has been determined. The drugs investigated included, propranolol, sotalol, oxprenolol, labetolol, timolol, metoprolol and acebutolol. Correlation between surface activity and local anaesthetic potency of the drugs is examined. Light scattering measurements have indicated self-association of sotalol, oxprenolol, acebutolol and metoprolol in 0.5 mol kg-1 sodium chloride. Critical micelle concentrations and aggregation numbers are reported.", 
    "44": "Hydrocortisone in pharmacologically attainable concentrations potentiates beta-adrenergic-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation in rat peritoneal mast cells. Direct binding studies using 3H-dihydroalprenolol indicated no significant changes in the number of beta-adrenoreceptors or in the kinetics of the interaction of the radio-ligand with receptors after treatment of mast cells with the corticosteroid. Competition binding studies with epinephrine revealed no hydrocortisone-induced change in Kd values for this agonist. It is concluded that hydrocortisone-induced stimulation of cyclic AMP synthesis results from an effect that occurs beyond the interaction of the beta-adrenergic agonist with its receptor.", 
    "45": "The long-term intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering effect of a beta-adrenergic blocking agent, timolol maleate, in topical administration was compared with the effect of pilocarpine on simple and capsular glaucoma by means of diurnal pressure curves during a six-month follow-up. In simple glaucoma timolol was more effective than pilocarpine in lowering IOP. In the follow-up a significant but not marked increase of the IOP was observed. In capsular glaucoma timolol was not effective enough, but when it was co-administered with miotics the IOP lowering effect was better than with either substance alone. Timolol induced no accomodative myopia, miosis, reduction of tear flow or other side effects. It increased the outflow facility in simple glaucoma but not in capsular glaucoma. During the trial, the anterior chamber depth increased while the corneal thickness remained unchanged. Four out of the six eyes included in a previous report of secondary glaucoma due to chronic uveitis are still, after one year of therapy, controlled with timolol.", 
    "46": "Metabolic effects of Metipranolol, a new beta adrenergic blocking agent, have been studied in patients with ischemic heart disease, hyperkinetic syndrome, hyperthyreosis and in healthy subjects. Administration of the drug (30 mg per day for one week) resulted in the decrease of noradrenaline excretion, blood free fatty acid level, and in lowering of blood pressure and heart rate, particularly in patients with ischemic heart disease and hyperkinetic syndrome. These alterations were accompanied by alleviation of clinical symptoms. It is suggested that Metipranolol by suppressing the activity of sympathetic nervous system and thereby diminishing lypolysis, exerts favourable clinical effects, most probably related to diminution of myocardial oxygen consumption.", 
    "47": "The effect of labetalol, an alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor blocking antihypertensive, on plasma renin activity (PRA) and the hemodynamics of healthy volunteers at rest and during an ergometric exercise test was studied. Oral doses of 200 and 400 mg labetalol were tested against a placebo in a crossover manner. The labetalol plasma concentrations were determined. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures in the supine position decreased after 400 mg labetalol as did the response of the heart rate to exercise. The lower dose decreased the resting heart rate, but had no effect on the heart rate during exercise. The ergometric exercise induced an increase in PRA which was partly inhibited after 200 mg labetalol in a manner similar to that induced by beta-blockers in our earlier studies. After 400 mg labetalol PRA was already increased at one hour at sitting rest and this higher basal level was maintained for four hours. After this higher dose of labetalol the reaction of PRA to exercise was not significantly inhibited. In renin release the vasodilating alpha-blockade thus dominated the beta-blocking property of labetalol at the dose which decreased the blood pressure.", 
    "48": "A study has been made of the structural requirements for activity on the dopamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase present in homogenates of rat nucleus accumbens. The only active phenylethylamine derivatives tested were those containing hydroxy groups at the 3 and 4 positions on the benzene ring, a two carbon side chain and a terminal nitrogen, either unsubstituted or containing a single methyl group. The alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonists, phenylephrine and isoprenaline respectively, were both inactive. Norsalsolinol was a weak agonist producing only a 50% stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity. The typical neuroleptic drugs, fluphenazine and cis-flupenthixol were both potent antagonists of the dopamine response as opposed to the atypical neuroleptics, metoclopramide and sulpiride, and the alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocking agents, phentolamine and propranolol respectively, which were all inactive. Our results indicate that the dopamine receptors associated with adenylate cyclase in the nucleus accumbens are similar to those in the corpus striatum.", 
    "49": "Atenolol is a beta-selective (cardioselective) adrenoceptor blocking drug without partial agonist or membrane stabilising activity. Its profile of action most closely resembles that of metoprolol which differs only in that it has some membrane stabilising activity. Atenolol has been well studied and is effective in the treatment of hypertension and in the prophylactic management of angina. Its narrow dose response range obviates the need for highly individualised dose titration. In patients with angina its long duration of beta-blocking activity allows once daily dosage, whereas other beta-blockers, unless in sustained release dosage forms, need to be given in divided doses. Other beta-blockers can be given once daily in hypertension, but at presnt the evidence for effective control with a once daily regimen is more convincing with atenolol. Further studies are need to clarify any important differences in blood pressure control between the various beta-blocking drugs, both in conventional or sustained release dosage forms. As with metoprolol, atenolol is preferable to non-selective beta-blockers in patients with asthma or diabetes mellitus. Atenolol has been well tolerated in most patients, its profile of adverse reactions generally resembling that of other beta-blocking drugs, although its low lipid solubility and limited penetration into the brain results in a lower incidence of central nervous system effects than seen with propranolol. Atenolol is eliminated virtually entirely as unchanged drug in the urine and dosage needs to be reduced in patients with moderate to severely impaired renal function (glomerular filtration rate less than 30 ml/min). There is no need for modification of dosage of atenolol in liver disease.", 
    "50": "1. The onset and duration of action of once daily acebutolol (400 mg) on resting and exercise heart rate and blood pressure were studied in normal subjects in a double-blind, cross-over trial against placebo. Subjects were studied 1.5, 3, 8 and 24 h after the first dose and 24 h after the fifth dose. 2. Resting and exercise heart rate and blood pressure were significantly reduced within 90 min of the first dose. 3. A significant reduction in these variables persisted throughout 24 h after the fifth daily dose. However, at 24 h the effects were considerably attenuated, the falls in resting and exercise systolic blood pressure being only 5%. 4. A linear relationship was noted between log serum drug level and percentage reduction of exercise heart rate.", 
    "51": "1. We describe a method for assessing bronchial beta-adrenoceptor blockade quantitatively in man. Specific airway conductance is measured after increasing doses of inhaled salbutamol and the extent to which the dose-response curve is displaced to the right after beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs is used to assess bronchial beta-adrenoceptor blockade. 2. Salbutamol dose-response curves were plotted for six normal subjects by measuring sGaw 15 min after increasing doses of inhaled salbutamol. Salbutamol produced a 30-70% increase in sGaw. 3. Salbutamol dose response curves were obtained 2 h after oral practolol (100 mg and 200 mg) and oral propranolol (40 mg and 80 mg) on separate days and were displaced to the right. 4. The mean dose ratios for practolol 100 mg and 200 mg were 1.2 and 2.1 and for propranolol 40 mg and 80 mg they were 21 and 61 respectively.", 
    "52": "A series of 1-[(4-hydroxyphenethyl)amino]-3-(aryloxy)propan-2-ols was synthesized together with several 1-[(3,4-dimethoxyphenethyl)amino]-3-(aryloxy)propan-2-ols. Their affinity to beta 1- and beta-2-adrenoceptors was determined and compared with the affinity of known beta-blockers. We were able to confirm the substantial cardioselectivity of 1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenethyl)-3-[(4-substituted aryl)oxy]propan-2-ols when compared to those with a 1-(4-hydroxyphenethyl) group. An increase in the size of the 4 substitutent of the 3-(aryloxy) moiety to caproamido leads to a substantially higher affinity for the beta 1--adrenoceptor of rat ventricular muscle in the presence of the 3,4-dimethoxyphenethyl than in the presence of the 4-hydroxyphenethyl or isopropyl group; this combination also gave the highest cardioselectivity.", 
    "53": "Modification of the pharmacological profile of the vasodilating/beta-adrenergic blocking agent 2-[4-[3-(tert-butylamino)-2-hydroxypropoxy]phenyl]-4-(trifluoromethyl)imidazole (1) has been investigated. Introduction of selected substitutents onto the imidazole ring, in place of the trifluoromethyl group, has yielded highly cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocking agents such as 7, 17, and 18. The placement of alkyl or chloro groups onto the aryl ring of 1, as illustrated by 33, has produced a class of compounds characterized as antihypertensive beta-adrenergic blocking agents. In these examples, the acute antihypertensive activity does not appear to be due to either vasodilating or beta 2-agonist properties.", 
    "54": "Series of 1-(4-biphenylyl)-1-hydroxy-2-aminoethanes and 1-(4-biphenylyl)-1-chloro-2-aminoethanes were synthesized. Newly developed reaction conditions for aryl aminomethyl ketone reduction and reductive alkylation, using sodium borohydride, are described. The prepared compounds were examined for adrenergic blocking activity on an anesthetized dog blood pressure preparation and on isolated toad hearts. beta-Adrenergic blockade was investigated using isoproterenol as the agonist. The benzylamino and cyclohexylamino analogs exhibited marked beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity, for which the latter derivatives were more potent.", 
    "55": "We have previously demonstrated that 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T(3)), whether administered in vivo or added to suspending media in vitro, promptly stimulates the in vitro accumulation of the nonmetabolized amino acids, alpha-aminoisobutyric acid, and cycloleucine (CLE) by thymocytes isolated from weanling rats. In these studies, we have examined the in vitro interaction between catecholamines and T(3) with respect to this effect. The previously reported enhancement of CLE accumulation in thymocytes by T(3) in vitro (1 muM) was confirmed. When added alone in concentrations ranging between 10 nM and 0.1 mM, the adrenergic agonists, epinephrine and norepinephrine, had no effect on CLE accumulation. At a concentration of 1 muM, isoproterenol, terbutaline, and phenylephrine were also without effect. However, the effect of T(3) was clearly potentiated by the concomitant addition of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and possibly isoproterenol, whereas terbutaline and phenylephrine were without effect. Neither basal nor T(3)-enhanced CLE accumulation was affected by the addition alone of the adrenergic blocking agents, propranolol (0.1 mM), phentolamine (10 muM), or practolol (0.1 mM). Nevertheless, the beta(1)- and beta(2)-antagonist, propranol, and the beta(1)-antagonist, practolol, blocked the increment in CLE accumulation produced by epinephrine; the alpha-antagonist, phentolamine, was without effect. The enhancement of CLE accumulation that occurred in the presence of T(3), with or without epinephrine, was seen to be a result of an inhibition of CLE efflux, because T(3) alone inhibited CLE efflux, and this effect was increased when epinephrine was also present. On the other hand, neither T(3) alone nor T(3) plus epinephrine appreciably altered the rate of inward transport of CLE. As judged from studies of the ability of thymocytes to exclude trypan blue, neither T(3) alone nor T(3) plus epinephrine either enhanced or impaired viability of cells during 3-h periods of incubation. Cell water content, measured with [(3)H]urea, was unaffected by T(3), either alone or in the presence of epinephrine. In confirmation of previous results, the stimulatory effect of T(3) on CLE accumulation was unaffected by concentrations of puromycin sufficient to inhibit protein synthesis by at least 95%, and the potentiating action of epinephrine on the response to T(3) was similarly unaffected. From these findings, it is concluded that the effect of T(3) to increase CLE accumulation by thymocytes in vitro, though itself independent of adrenergic mediation, is potentiated by beta(1)-adrenergic stimulation. This interaction appears distinctly different from other thyroid hormone-catecholamine interactions, in which thyroid hormones enhance physiological responses to catecholamines. Its mechanism remains unclear, but the properties of the T(3) effect, and possibly the interaction itself, suggest that T(3) enhances CLE accumulation by an action at the level of the cell membrane."
