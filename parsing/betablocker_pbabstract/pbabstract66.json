Thirty-seven centres responded. Rhythm control was preferred in patients with significant AF-related symptoms by 73% of centres, in all patients after a first detected episode by 59%, and in young patients even if AF was well tolerated by 49% of centres. The most common strategy after successful conversion of the first AF episode was a 'wait-and-see' approach without initiation of antiarrhythmic drugs (49%). Conventional \u03b2-blockers were always or sometimes used as first-choice drugs for AF prevention by 76% of centres. Only 11% used dronedarone regularly as a first-choice drug. The diagnostic work-up for exclusion of heart disease prior to initiation of class IC antiarrhythmic drugs was limited. Markers monitored for proarrhythmia risk were QRS duration for class IC drugs (68%) and the QT interval for sotalol and amiodarone (65%). In conclusion, rhythm control is more widely employed than expected. Beta-blockers are widely used for AF prevention in contrast to the limited use of the new drug dronedarone.", 
    "1": "Sweeping, an on-line sample concentration technique in CE, is the picking and accumulation of analytes by the pseudostationary phase or complexing additive. In the presence of an electric field, the analytes concentrated at the additive front that initially penetrated the sample zone. Here, we describe the sweeping of cationic alprenolol enantiomers using sulfated \u03b2-CD and organic solvent. The separation solution contained the anionic additive while ACN was in the sample solution. With fused silica capillaries, positive polarity, and solutions buffered at pH 3, the direction of the enantiomers' effective electrophoretic mobility was the same as the electrophoretic mobility (or electrophoretic mobility without additive). When the amount of ACN in the sample was increased (i.e. 60%), the interaction between the analytes and additive became negligible. This caused the sweeping boundary to shift from the electrophoretically moving \u03b2-CD front to the zone between the sample and separation solution. The equation that described the narrowing of injected sample zone was derived. The performance of sweeping with 60% ACN in the sample was then studied under different operating conditions (e.g. type of injection, injection time, and CD concentration). The low interaction between enantiomers and additive gave only moderate increases in sensitivity (approximately tenfold), but was improved when field enhancement was used during electrokinetic injection. With a conductivity difference (separation/sample solution) of 70 and a short injection time of 30 s at 20 kV, peak improvements of >100-fold was easily achieved.",

    "10": "The mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) is a well-established model of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), characterized by the abnormal formation of new blood vessels, which is similar to ROP. In this model, we have recently shown that subcutaneous (sc) administration of the non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2-AR) blocker propranolol ameliorates angiogenic processes in the retina when its effects are evaluated at postnatal day (PD) 17. In the present study, we investigated whether propranolol application as collyrium can promote the recovery of OIR. After propranolol administration on the eye, mice were first tested for retinal concentrations of propranolol as compared with those measured after sc or per os administration. Subsequently, we determined the effects of propranolol ophthalmic solutions, at the optimal dose for delivery, on VEGF, IGF-1, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1\u03b1, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and retinal neovascularization as assessed in both the superficial and the deep vascular plexuses. The results showed that 2% topical propranolol has an efficiency (in terms of final propranolol concentration in the retina) comparable to that of 20 mg/kg propranolol sc or per os and significantly higher than those observed with doses and administration routes that are currently used with children. Propranolol ophthalmic solutions reduced VEGF and IGF-1 up-regulation in response to hypoxia and drastically inhibited HIF-1\u03b1 accumulation and STAT3 phosphorylation. As a result of its inhibitory effects on hypoxia-induced proangiogenic factors, propranolol significantly reduced retinal neovascularization in the superficial but not in the deep vascular plexus. An evaluation of retinal neovascularization at PD21 showed that propranolol was still effective in inhibiting OIR. These findings strengthen the hypothesis that \u03b2-AR blockade can efficiently counteract OIR and suggest that topical eye application of propranolol can represent an alternative delivery route to systemic administration thus avoiding the risk of associated complications and side effects that could make this drug unsafe in the ROP treatment.",

The chemical compositions, specific surface areas, equilibrium bindings, and selectivity of the obtained molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) were systematically characterized. The experimental results showed that the MIPs with molecular imprinting effects and quite fast binding kinetics could be readily prepared via RAFTBP, but they did not show improved template binding properties in comparison with those prepared via TRBP, which is in sharp contrast to many previous reports. This could be attributed to the heavily interrupted equilibrium between the dormant species and active radicals in the RAFT mechanism because of the occurrence of fast gelation during RAFTBP. The findings presented here strongly demonstrates that the application of controlled radical polymerizations (CRPs) in molecular imprinting does not always benefit the binding properties of the resultant MIPs, which is of significant importance for the rational use of CRPs in generating MIPs with improved properties.", 
    "21": "In this study, we sought to evaluate the image quality and effective radiation dose of prospectively ECG-triggered adaptive systolic (PTA-systolic) dual-source CTA versus prospectively triggered adaptive diastolic (PTA-diastolic) dual-source CTA in patients of unselected heart rate and rhythm. This retrospective cohort study consisted of 41 PTA-systolic and 41 matched PTA-diastolic CTA patients whom underwent clinically indicated 128-slice dual source CTA between December 2010 to June 2012. Image quality and motion artifact score (both on a Likert scale 1-4 with 4 being the best), effective dose, and CTDIvol were compared. The effect of heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability [HRV] on image motion artifact score and CTDIvol was analyzed with Pearson's correlation coefficient. All 82 exams were considered diagnostic with 0 non-diagnostic segments. PTA-systolic CTA patients had a higher maximum HR, wider HRV, were less likely to be in sinus rhythm, and received less beta-blocker vs. PTA-diastolic CTA patients. No difference in effective dose was observed (PTA-systolic vs. PTA-diastolic CTA: 2.9 vs. 2.2 mSv, p = 0.26). Image quality score (3.3 vs. 3.5, p < 0.05) and motion artifact score (3.5 vs. 3.8, p < 0.05) were lower in PTA-systolic CTAs than in PTA-diastolic CTAs. For PTA-systolic CTAs, an increase in HR was not associated with a negative impact on motion artifact score nor CTDIvol. For PTA-diastolic CTA, an increase in HR was associated with increased motion artifacts and CTDIvol. HRV demonstrated no correlation with motion artifact and CTDIvol for both PTA-systolic and PTA-diastolic CTAs. In conclusion, both PTA-diastolic CTA and PTA-systolic CTA yielded diagnostic examinations at unselected heart rates and rhythms with similar effective radiation, but PTA-systolic CTA resulted in more consistent radiation exposure and image quality across a wide range of rates and rhythms.", 
    "22": "We have previously shown that hydrogen sulfide (H\u2082S) reduces myogenic tone and causes relaxation of phenylephrine (PE)-constricted mesenteric arteries. This effect of H\u2082S to cause vasodilation and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) hyperpolarization was mediated by large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated potassium channels (BKCa). Ca(2+) sparks are ryanodine receptor (RyR)-mediated Ca(2+)-release events that activate BKCa channels in VSMCs to cause membrane hyperpolarization and vasodilation. We hypothesized that H\u2082S activates Ca(2+) sparks in small mesenteric arteries. Ca(2+) sparks were measured using confocal microscopy in rat mesenteric arteries loaded with the Ca(2+) indicator fluo-4. VSMC membrane potential (Em) was measured in isolated arteries using sharp microelectrodes. In PE-constricted arteries, the H\u2082S donor NaHS caused vasodilation that was inhibited by ryanodine (RyR blocker), abluminal or luminal iberiotoxin (IbTx, BKCa blocker), endothelial cell (EC) disruption, and sulfaphenazole [cytochrome P-450 2C (Cyp2C) inhibitor]. The H\u2082S donor NaHS (10 \u03bcmol/l) increased Ca(2+) sparks but only in the presence of intact EC and this was blocked by sulfaphenazole or luminal IbTx. Inhibiting cystathionine \u03b3-lyase (CSE)-derived H2S with \u03b2-cyano-l-alanine (BCA) also reduced VSMC Ca(2+) spark frequency in mesenteric arteries, as did EC disruption. However, excess CSE substrate homocysteine did not affect spark activity. NaHS hyperpolarized VSMC Em in PE-depolarized mesenteric arteries with intact EC and also hyperpolarized EC Em in arteries cut open to expose the lumen. This hyperpolarization was prevented by ryanodine, sulfaphenazole, and abluminal or luminal IbTx. BCA reduced IbTx-sensitive K(+) currents in freshly dispersed mesenteric ECs. These results suggest that H\u2082S increases Ca(2+) spark activity in mesenteric artery VSMC through activation of endothelial BKCa channels and Cyp2C, a novel vasodilatory pathway for this emerging signaling molecule.",

    "26": "The mammalian carotid body (CB) is a peripheral chemosensory organ that controls ventilation and is innervated by both afferent and efferent nerve fibres. The afferent pathway is stimulated by chemoexcitants, such as hypoxia, hypercapnia and acidosis. The efferent pathway causes inhibition of the sensory discharge via release of NO that originates mainly from neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)-positive autonomic neurones within the glossopharyngeal nerve (GPN). Recent studies in the rat indicate that these inhibitory GPN neurones and their processes express purinergic P2X receptors and can be activated by ATP, a key excitatory CB neurotransmitter. Here we tested the hypothesis that purinergic agonists stimulate a rise in [Ca(2+)]i, leading to nNOS activation and NO production in isolated GPN neurones, using the fluorescent probes fura-2 and 4-amino-5-methylamino-2',7'-difluorofluorescein diacetate (DAF-FM DA), respectively. ATP caused a dose-dependent increase in [Ca(2+)]i in GPN neurones (EC50 \u2248 1.92 \u03bcm) that was markedly inhibited by a combination of 100 \u03bcm suramin (a non-specific P2X blocker) and 100 nm Brilliant Blue G (a selective P2X7 blocker). ATP also stimulated NO production in GPN neurones, as revealed by an increase in DAF fluorescence; this NO signal was inhibited by purinergic blockers, chelators of extracellular Ca(2+), the nNOS inhibitor l-NAME and the NO scavenger carboxy-PTIO. The P2X2/3 and P2X7 agonists \u03b1,\u03b2,-methylene ATP and benzoyl ATP mimicked the effects of ATP. Taken together, these data indicate that ATP may contribute to negative feedback inhibition of CB sensory discharge via purinergic stimulation of NO production in efferent fibres.",

The triplet excited state of FA ((3)FA(*)) and singlet oxygen ((1)O2) were the main reactive species responsible for the degradation of timolol in the aerated FA solutions. Both dissolved oxygen and iodide ions (I(-)) are the efficient quenchers of (3)FA(*). The photodegradation was drastically accelerated after removing the dissolved oxygen. The presence of I(-) inhibited the photosensitized degradation of timolol in the deoxygenated FA solutions, whereas the role of I(-) in the reaction was concentration-dependent in the aerated solutions. The other halide ions such as chloride (Cl(-)) and bromide (Br(-)) exhibited less effect on the photodegradation of timolol in both aerated and deoxygenated solutions. By LC-DAD/ESI-MS/MS analysis, the photoproducts of timolol in both aerated and deoxygenated FA solutions were identified. Electron transfer interaction occurred between (3)FA(*) and amine moiety of timolol, leading to the cleavage of C-O bond in the side chain and oxidation of the hexatomic ring. These findings suggest the photosensitized degradation was a significant pathway for the elimination of timolol in natural waters.",

Seventy-eight patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (NIDCM) with sinus rhythm who were first hospitalized for ADHF from 2002 to 2010 were retrospectively investigated after exclusion of patients with tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. The patients were divided into two groups stratified by HR on admission with a median value of 113 beats/min (Group H with HR \u2265 113 beats/min; Group L with HR < 113 beats/min). Despite similar backgrounds, including pharmacotherapy for HF, HR changes responding to titration of \u03b2-blocker (BB) therapy and myocardial interstitial fibrosis, left ventricular (LV) ejection fractions improved more significantly 1 year later in Group H than in Group L (57 % \u00b1 11 % vs. 46 % \u00b1 12 %, P < 0.001). Cardiac event-free survival rates were also significantly improved in Group H (P = 0.038). Multiple regression analysis revealed that only the peak HR on admission was an independent predictor of LV reverse remodeling (LVRR) 1 year later (\u03b2 = 0.396, P = 0.005). High HR on first admission for ADHF is a strong predictor of LVRR, with a better prognosis in the event of NIDCM in response to optimal pharmacotherapy, independent of pre-existing myocardial damage and subsequent HR reduction by BB therapy.",

We report the crystal structures of the human 5-HT1B G protein-coupled receptor bound to the agonist antimigraine medications ergotamine and dihydroergotamine. The structures reveal similar binding modes for these ligands, which occupy the orthosteric pocket and an extended binding pocket close to the extracellular loops. The orthosteric pocket is formed by residues conserved in the 5-HT receptor family, clarifying the family-wide agonist activity of 5-HT. Compared with the structure of the 5-HT2B receptor, the 5-HT1B receptor displays a 3 angstrom outward shift at the extracellular end of helix V, resulting in a more open extended pocket that explains subtype selectivity. Together with docking and mutagenesis studies, these structures provide a comprehensive structural basis for understanding receptor-ligand interactions and designing subtype-selective serotonergic drugs.",

Remodeling is a well-characterized response to insult or injury and is initiated early on by neurohormonal activation. Neurohormonal antagonists have formed the foundation of therapy to alter the progression of remodeling and concomitantly improve outcomes. Surgical ventricular reconstruction was designed as a surgical means to reduce the ventricular radius and in principal decrease ventricular wall stress as defined by the Law of Laplace. Despite optimistic initial results from case series, the Surgical Treatment for Ischemic Heart Failure Trial (STICH) trial, a large randomized trial of ventricular reconstruction in addition to coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) therapy for management of patients with heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction showed no clinical benefit. We will summarize the evidence that demonstrates the foundational role of neurohormonal blockade in improving outcomes in patients with heart failure with a reduced ejection and the evidence behind its role in \"medical ventricular reconstruction\".",

Their biological activities on pancreatic \u03b2-cells and on smooth muscle cells were compared to those of the reference ATP-sensitive potassium channel (KATP channel) openers diazoxide and 7-chloro-3-isopropylamino-4H-1,2,4-benzothiadiazine 1,1-dioxide. The aim was to assess the impact on biological activities of the replacement of the 1,2,4-thiadiazine ring by an isosteric 1,4,2-dithiazine ring. Most of the dithiazine analogues were found to be inactive on the pancreatic tissue, although some compounds bearing a 1-phenylethylamino side chain at the 3-position exerted a marked myorelaxant activity. Such an effect did not appear to be related to the opening of KATP channels but rather reflected a mechanism of action similar to that of calcium channel blockers. Tightly related 3-(1-phenylethyl)sulfanyl-4H-1,2,4-benzothiadiazine 1,1-dioxides were also found to exert a pronounced myorelaxant activity, resulting from both a KATP channel activation and a calcium channel blocker mechanism.

However, the role of endogenous ghrelin in the chronic phase is unknown. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to focus on the effects of endogenous ghrelin on cardiac function and sympathetic activation after acute MI. In 46 ghrelin-knockout (KO) and 41 wild-type (WT) male mice, MI was produced by left coronary artery ligation. The mortality due to heart failure within 2 weeks was 0% in WT and 10.9% in KO (P < 0.05). At the end of this period, lung weight/tibial length, atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide transcripts, end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes were all significantly greater in KO mice, whereas systolic function, represented by ejection fraction (16.4 \u00b1 4.7% vs 25.3 \u00b1 5.1%), end-systolic elastance, and preload-recruitable stroke work, was significantly inferior to that in WT mice (P < 0.05). Telemetry recording and heart rate variability analysis showed that KO mice had stronger sympathetic activation after MI than did WT mice. Metoprolol treatment and ghrelin treatment in KO mice prevented excessive sympathetic activation, decreased plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine levels, and improved heart function and survival rate after MI. Our data demonstrate that endogenous ghrelin plays a crucial role in protecting heart function and reducing mortality after myocardial infarction, and that these effects seem to be partly the result of sympathetic inhibition.",

Routinely taken statins should not be terminated and this is also true for \u03b2-blockers. The cerebral perfusion pressure should be kept at baseline levels, whereas a mild hypercapnia theoretically could be beneficial. Hypoglycemia has to be avoided while treatment of high blood glucose levels should be started when they exceed 150 mg/dl.

We have focused solely on the approach to diagnosis and therapy and we have directed this review to the average clinical cardiologist who, in his/her practice, sees occasionally patients affected or suspected to be affected by LQTS; the cardiologist who may know enough to manage them but not enough to be completely confident on his/her most critical choices. We have provided our personal views without making any attempt to blend differences whenever present. On most issues we agree fully but where we do not, we make it clear to the reader by indicating who is thinking what. The result may be unconventional, but it mirrors the challenges, often severe, that we all face in managing and protecting these patients from sudden death while also helping them live and thrive despite their diagnosis. We trust that this unabashed presentation of our clinical approach will be useful for both cardiologists and patients.", 
    "98": "Given the huge burden of coronary artery disease and the effectiveness of medication therapy, understanding and quantifying known impacts of poor medication adherence for primary and secondary prevention is crucial. We sought to systematically review the literature on this topic area with a focus on quantified cost and clinical outcomes related to adherence.", 
    "99": "We conducted a systematic review of the literature between 1966 and November 2011 using a fixed search strategy, multiple reviewers, and a quality rating scale. We found 2636 articles using this strategy, eventually weaning them down to 25 studies that met our inclusion criteria. Three reviewers independently reviewed the studies and scored them for quality using the Newcastle Ottawa Scoring Scale.", 
    "100": "We found 5 studies (4 of which focused on statins) that measured the impact of medication adherence on primary prevention of coronary artery disease and 20 articles that focused on the relationship between medication adherence to costs and outcomes related to secondary prevention of coronary artery disease. Most of these latter studies focused on antihypertensive medications and aspirin. All controlled for confounding comorbidities and sociodemographic characteristics, but few controlled for likelihood of adherent patients to have healthier behaviors (\"healthy adherer effect\"). Three studies found that high adherence significantly improves health outcomes and reduces annual costs for secondary prevention of coronary artery disease (between $294 and $868 per patient, equating to 10.1%-17.8% cost reductions between high- and low-adherence groups). The studies were all of generally of high quality on the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (median score 8 of 9).",

    "109": "Landiolol was efficacious in treating tachyarrhythmia in pediatric cardiac surgery. The desired negative chronotropic effect was achieved without significant hemodynamic compromise. The ultra-short half-life of landiolol provided rapid dose manipulation. This study suggests that landiolol is a promising option for the management of postoperative tachyarrhythmias in pediatric patients.", 
    "110": "Septic shock is characterized by circulatory compromise, microcirculatory alterations and mitochondrial damage, which all reduce cellular energy production. In order to reduce the risk of major cell death and a diminished likelihood of recovery, adaptive changes appear to be activated. As a result, cells and organs may survive in a non-functioning hibernation-like condition. Sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction may represent an example of such functional shutdown. Sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction is common, corresponds to the severity of sepsis, and is reversible in survivors. Its mechanisms include the attenuation of the adrenergic response at the cardiomyocyte level, alterations of intracellular calcium trafficking and blunted calcium sensitivity of contractile proteins. All these changes are mediated by cytokines. Treatment includes preload optimization with sufficient fluids. However, excessive volume loading is harmful. The first line vasopressor recommended at present is norepinephrine, while vasopressin can be started as a salvage therapy for those not responding to catecholamines. During early sepsis, cardiac output can be increased by dobutamine. While early administration of catecholamines might be necessary to restore adequate organ perfusion, prolonged administration might be harmful. Novel therapies for sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction are discussed in this article. Cardiac inotropy can be increased by levosimendan, istaroxime or omecamtiv mecarbil without greatly increasing cellular oxygen demands. Heart rate reduction with ivabradine reduces myocardial oxygen expenditure and ameliorates diastolic filling. Beta-blockers additionally reduce local and systemic inflammation. Advances may also come from metabolic interventions such as pyruvate, succinate or high dose insulin substitutions. All these potentially advantageous concepts require rigorous testing before implementation in routine clinical practice.", 
    "111": "Several studies have reported the benefits of beta-blockers (BB) for patients presenting with systolic heart failure. however, many patients hospitalized as a result of acute heart failure are already using BB and require dobutamine for arterial hypotension and low cardiac output. Therefore, a decision must be made regarding whether BB should be maintained or even started in such cases. The aim of this study was to establish whether there is evidence supporting the safety andyeffectiveness of BB together with dobutamine for patients presenting with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). We conducted a search of the English-language literature in the databases MEDLINE, ISI Web of Science, Virtual Health Library, Cochrane Library and the CAPES Portal of Scientific Journals to identify related studies. Additional literature was obtained through the review of relevant references in the identified articles. The expected outcomes included information on the prognosis (in-hospital and on follow-up mortality, number of days of hospitalization and readmission),yeffectiveness and safety (worsening of symptoms, shock, intolerance) of the concomitant use of these drugs in hospitalized patients with ADHF and low cardiac output. This review included nine studies. however, no randomized clinical trials on this subject were found. Most studies include a low number of patients, and no studies addressing the safety of the concomitant use of these drugs were found. The resulting data suggest that a careful literature review did not supply evidence for the systematic use of BB in patients with low cardiac output syndrome who require dobutamine for inotropic support.",

In the case of hospital wastewater, the effect of the independent variables pH and [Fe(VI)] was evaluated by means of response surface methodology. The results showed that Fe(VI) plays an important role in the oxidation-coagulation process, and the treatment of the hospital wastewater led to degradations above 90% for all the three \u03b2-blockers, and to reductions of aromaticity that were close to 60%. In addition, only 17% of the organic load was removed. In aqueous solution, the degradation of the \u03b2-blockers atenolol, metoprolol and propranolol was 71.7%, 24.7% and 96.5%, respectively, when a ratio of 1:10 [\u03b2-blocker]:[Fe(VI)] was used. No mineralization was achieved, which suggests that there was a conversion of the \u03b2-blockers to degradation products identified by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry tandem. Degradation pathways were proposed, which took account of the role of Fe(VI). Furthermore, the ready biodegradability of the post-process samples was evaluated by using the closed bottle test, and showed an increase in biodegradability. The use of the ferrate advanced oxidation technology seems to be a useful means of ensuring the remediation of hospital and similar wastewater.",

Permeability studies showed a correlation (r(2)=0.92) between in vitro TR146 cell culture and ex vivo porcine buccal mucosa in a modified Ussing chamber. A higher apparent permeability was observed at higher pH values, i.e. the more compound that was unionised the higher the permeability. In vivo studies were conducted in anaesthetised G\u00f6ttingen mini-pigs. A clear influence of pH on the absorption was seen and a significant higher absolute bioavailability was obtained after buccal dosing (58-107%) compared to oral (3%) administration, ranging 58-107% and 3%, respectively. Macroscopically, no local toxic effects were observed by visual inspection of mini-pig cheeks. A very clear level C in vitro in vivo correlation (r(2)=0.98) was obtained between the observed in vitro permeabilities and the bioavailability observed in vivo, suggesting that the two in vitro models have good predictive power for drug delivery, which could be a useful tool for future formulation developments intended for buccal delivery.", 
    "131": "Accumulation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) in bone tissue occurs in ageing and in Diabetes mellitus, and is partly responsible for the increased risk of low-stress bone fractures observed in these conditions. In this study we evaluated whether the anti-osteoporotic agent strontium ranelate can prevent the deleterious effects of AGEs on bone cells, and possible mechanisms of action involved. Using mouse MC3T3E1 osteoblastic cells in culture we evaluated the effects of 0.1mM strontium ranelate and/or 100 \u03bcg/ml AGEs-modified bovine serum albumin (AGEs-BSA) on cell proliferation, osteogenic differentiation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. We found that AGEs-BSA alone decreased osteoblastic proliferation and differentiation (P<0.01) while increasing IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1 production (P<0.01). On its own, strontium ranelate induced opposite effects: an increase in osteoblast proliferation and differentiation (P<0.01) and a decrease in cytokine secretion (P<0.01). Additionally, strontium ranelate prevented the inhibitory and pro-inflammatory actions of AGEs-BSA on osteoblastic cells (P<0.01). These effects of strontium ranelate were blocked by co-incubation with either the MAPK inhibitor PD98059, or the calcium channel blocker nifedipine. We also evaluated by Western blotting the activation status of ERK (a MAPK) and b-catenin. Activation of both signaling pathways was decreased by AGEs treatment, and this inhibitory effect was prevented if AGEs were co-incubated with strontium ranelate (P<0.01). On its own, strontium ranelate increased both pERK and activated b-catenin levels. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that strontium ranelate can prevent the deleterious in vitro actions of AGEs on osteoblastic cells in culture by mechanisms that involve calcium channel, MAPK and b-catenin activation.",

However, most of these investigations have had certain limitations, including being retrospective, an interview-related bias, a various duration of myocardial ischemia, and a lack of multivariate analysis, all of which would have affected the results. Accordingly, we prospectively examined the presence or absence of chest pain and non-chest pain symptoms during a 60-second balloon inflation in the setting of percutaneous coronary intervention, which provides a unique model of transient myocardial ischemia, in 110 men and 80 women with coronary artery disease. Chest pain and/or non-chest pain symptoms (occipital pain, jaw pain, neck/throat pain, shoulder pain, upper arm pain, back pain, and nausea) were observed during the balloon inflation in 72 men and 52 women. In the 124 patients with any symptoms during the balloon inflation, non-chest pain symptoms were more common in women than in men (31% vs 14%, p = 0.02); however, the incidence of chest pain did not differ between the men and women. After adjustment for covariables, including age, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, current smoking, previous myocardial infarction, target vessels, \u03b2-blocker use, and calcium antagonist use, female gender remained significantly associated with non-chest pain symptoms (odds ratio 3.3, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 9.9, p = 0.02). In conclusion, non-chest pain symptoms during the 60-second balloon occlusion of the coronary artery were more common in women than in men, supporting the presence of the gender difference in myocardial ischemic symptoms.", 
    "133": "Vascular lesions encountered in dermatology can be divided into vascular malformations and vascular tumors, namely infantile hemangiomas (IH). Vascular malformations can further be subdivided by their flow characteristics and vessel type. Slow, or low-flow lesions are either capillary vascular malformations (CVMs), venous malformations, or lymphatic malformations. Fast, or high-flow lesions include an arterial component, and are categorized as arteriovenous malformations. IH and CVMs are among the most common benign vascular lesions seen and treated in dermatology. CVMs are present at birth and grow as the individual does, whereas IH usually appear days to weeks later and may rapidly enlarge for a period of months to a year before gradually involuting. As the technology has evolved, early and often laser treatment with the pulsed dye 595-nm laser has become our standard therapy of choice. More recently, we have started more patients on combination therapy for IH with the topical beta blocker timolol. If left untreated, CVMs darken and thicken, making them increasingly difficult to successfully treat with lasers. IH involute, sometimes resulting in fibrofatty, atrophic plaques. These individuals can undergo ablative fractional resurfacing with a fractional CO2 laser to improve the texture and appearance of these lesions.",

The aim of this study was to compare the effects of cilnidipine and azelnidipine on blood pressure, heart rate and albuminuria. An open-label prospective crossover trial was carried out. We recruited 19 type 2 diabetics treated with amlodipine (5\u00a0mg/day) at least for 12\u00a0weeks. At study entry, amlodipine was changed to cilnidipine (10\u00a0mg/day) or azelnidipine (16\u00a0mg/day) and each administered for 16\u00a0weeks. Then, the drugs were switched and the treatment was continued for another 16\u00a0weeks. Despite no differences in 24-h blood pressure and heart rate between cilnidipine and azelnidipine, treatment with cilnidipine resulted in a greater reduction in urinary albumin:creatinine ratio than azelnidipine. Our results suggested that cilnidipine is more efficient in reducing albuminuria than azelnidipine independent of its blood pressure lowering effect in type 2 diabetic patients with hypertension.

Seventeen patients were randomly divided into two groups: patients in the F-group received 2 \u03bcg/kg fentanyl intravenously followed by an infusion of 0.03-0.06 \u03bcg/kg/min, while patients in the R-group received a 0.5 \u03bcg/kg bolus of remifentanil followed by an infusion of 0.0625-0.250 \u03bcg/kg/min. Mean arterial pressure and heart rate were recorded at the following points: before anesthetic induction, at endotracheal intubation, 5 min after intubation, at incision, just before the osteotomy, during the osteotomy, during the maxillary fracturing, at suturing, at extubation, 5 min after extubation, and then 15 and 30 min postoperatively. Heart rate and mean arterial pressure were significantly lower in the R-group in comparison to the F-group from t1 to t9 (P<0.05). All measured recovery times were significantly shorter in the R-group (P<0.05). The incidence of postoperative side effects was comparable between groups. Remifentanil-based anesthesia is an appropriate alternative to fentanyl during Le Fort I orthognathic surgery; it promotes hemodynamic stability, blunts the stress response to noxious stimuli, and provides a better recovery profile.", 
    "142": "PDEs restrict the positive inotropic effects of \u03b2-adrenoceptor stimulation by degrading cAMP. Hence, PDE inhibitors sensitize the heart to catecholamines and are therefore used as positive inotropes. On the downside, this is accompanied by exaggerated energy expenditure, cell death and arrhythmias. For many years, PDE3 was considered to be the major isoform responsible for the control of cardiac force and rhythm. However, recent work in gene-targeted mice and rodent cells has indicated that PDE4 is also involved. Furthermore, selective PDE4 inhibitors augment catecholamine-stimulated cAMP levels and induce arrhythmias in human atrial preparations, which suggests that PDE4 has a more prominent role in the human heart than anticipated, and that PDE4 inhibitors such as roflumilast may carry an arrhythmogenic risk. In this issue of the journal, a team of researchers from three laboratories report on the effect of PDE3 and PDE4 inhibitors on ventricular trabeculae from explanted human hearts. The key result is that the PDE4 inhibitor rolipram does not affect the positive inotropic effects of \u03b2\u2081 - or \u03b2\u2082 -adrenoceptor stimulation.

The hardness, tensile strength, and friability of tablets increased as the concentration of mucilage increased, indicating good compactibility of mucilage powders. The rate of release of propranolol hydrochloride from P. major mucilage matrices was mainly controlled by the drug/mucilage ratio. Formulations containing P. major mucilage were found to exhibit a release rate comparable to HPMC containing matrices at a lower drug/polymer ratio (drug/HPMC 2:1). These results demonstrated that P. major mucilage is a better release retardant compared to tragacanth at an equivalent content. The results of kinetic analysis showed that in F3 (containing 1:2 drug/mucilage) the highest correlation coefficient was achieved with the zero order model. The swelling and erosion studies revealed that as the proportion of mucilage in tablets was increased, there was a corresponding increase in percent swelling and a decrease in percent erosion of tablets.

We tested the hypotheses that: (1) CPT-induced sympathetic activation elicits coronary vasodilatation in young adults that is impaired with advancing age and (2) combined \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenergic blockade diminishes/abolishes these age-related differences. Vascular responses of the left anterior descending artery to the CPT were determined by transthoracic Doppler echocardiography before (pre-blockade) and during (post-blockade) systemic co-administration of \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenergic antagonists in young (n = 9; 26 \u00b1 1 years old, mean \u00b1 SEM) and older healthy men (n = 9; 66 \u00b1 2 years old). Coronary vascular resistance (CVR; mean arterial pressure/coronary blood velocity) was used as an index of vascular tone. CPT decreased CVR (i.e. coronary vasodilatation occurred) in young ( -33 \u00b1 6%), but not older men ( -3 \u00b1 4%; P < 0.05 vs. young) pre-blockade. Adrenergic blockade abolished CPT-induced coronary vasodilatation in young men ( -33 \u00b1 6% vs. 0 \u00b1 6%, pre-blockade vs. post-blockade, respectively; P < 0.05) such that responses post-blockade mirrored those of older men ( -3 \u00b1 4% vs. 8 \u00b1 9%; both P > 0.05 compared to young pre-blockade). Impaired CPT-induced coronary vasodilatation could not be explained by a reduced stimulus for vasodilatation as group and condition effects persisted when CVR responses were expressed relative to myocardial oxygen demand (rate-pressure product). These data indicate that the normal coronary vascular response to sympathetic activation in young men is pronounced vasodilatation and this effect is lost with age as the result of an adrenergic mechanism. These findings may help explain how acute sympathoexcitation may precipitate angina and coronary ischaemic events, particularly in older adults.",

The in vitro drug release was dependent on the drug load, type of fatty acid, and pH of the dissolution medium. Higher drug loads resulted in faster release with behenic acid releasing drug over longer periods relative to stearic acid. The in vitro drug release was pH-dependent at low drug load with the release being slower at lower pH. Due to ionization of the fatty acid at pH 7.4, drug release was susceptible to the ionic strength at this pH value. Solid state characterization indicated that the crystalline state of the fatty acids was not affected by thermal processing via prilling, while the crystallinity of MPT was decreased. During storage, the amorphous MPT fraction recrystallized in the entire matrix. Drug release from behenic acid matrices was increased during storage at 40 \u00b0C; however, no polymorphism of behenic acid was detected. The bioavailability of MPT, after oral administration to dogs as prills containing 30% and 40% MPT using behenic acid as matrix former, was not significantly different from a commercial sustained release reference formulation, although the 40% MPT prills showed a burst release.",

Clinical follow-up of infants with IH should be very careful in the first weeks of life since 80% of all IHs have reached their final size at 5 months of age. The main indications for treatment of IHs are: life-threatening conditions (heart failure, respiratory distress), functional risks (amblyopia, swallowing disorders, etc.), aesthetic risks (especially IH of the face localized on the nose, lips, etc.), and painful ulcerated IH. Beta-blockers, namely propranolol, have quickly become the first-line therapy of complicated IH. The treatment should be given as soon as possible to avoid sequelae.", 
    "187": "One of the most potent insecticidal venom peptides described to date is Aps III from the venom of the trapdoor spider Apomastus schlingeri. Aps III is highly neurotoxic to lepidopteran crop pests, making it a promising candidate for bioinsecticide development. However, its disulfide-connectivity, three-dimensional structure, and mode of action have not been determined. Here we show that recombinant Aps III (rAps III) is an atypical knottin peptide; three of the disulfide bridges form a classical inhibitor cystine knot motif while the fourth disulfide acts as a molecular staple that restricts the flexibility of an unusually large \u03b2 hairpin loop that often houses the pharmacophore in this class of toxins. We demonstrate that the irreversible paralysis induced in insects by rAps III results from a potent block of insect voltage-gated sodium channels. Channel block by rAps III is voltage-independent insofar as it occurs without significant alteration in the voltage-dependence of channel activation or steady-state inactivation. Thus, rAps III appears to be a pore blocker that plugs the outer vestibule of insect voltage-gated sodium channels. This mechanism of action contrasts strikingly with virtually all other sodium channel modulators isolated from spider venoms that act as gating modifiers by interacting with one or more of the four voltage-sensing domains of the channel.", 
    "188": "The interactions of metoprolol tartrate (MPT) and guaifenesin (GF) drugs with human serum albumin (HSA) and human hemoglobin (HMG) proteins at pH\u20097.4 were studied by fluorescence and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Drugs quenched the fluorescence spectra of HSA and HMG proteins through a static quenching mechanism. For each protein-drug system, the values of Stern-Volmer quenching constant, bimolecular quenching constant, binding constant and number of binding site on the protein molecules were determined at 288.15, 298.15, 310.15 and 318.15\u00a0K. It was found that the binding constants of HSA-MPT and HSA-GF systems were smaller than those of HMG-MPT and HMG-GF systems. For both drugs, the affinity of HMG was much higher than that of HSA. An increase in temperature caused a negative effect on the binding reactions. The number of binding site on blood proteins for MPT and GF drugs was approximately one. Thermodynamic parameters showed that MPT interacted with HSA through electrostatic attraction forces. However, hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces were the main interaction forces in the formation of HSA-GF, HMG-MPT and HMG-GF complexes. The binding processes between protein and drug molecules were exothermic and spontaneous owing to negative \u2206H and \u2206G values, respectively. The values of binding distance between protein and drug molecules were calculated from F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer theory. It was found from CD analysis that the bindings of MPT and GF drugs to HSA and HMG proteins altered the secondary structure of HSA and HMG proteins.",

    "190": "We retrospectively analysed the clinical data of four patients with congenital heart defects, who developed post-operative JET and were treated with landiolol hydrochloride, representing all such patients treated at our university. In two patients, landiolol was used after failure of response to anti-arrhythmic therapies, including thermal control, sedation, discontinuation of catecholamines, and pharmacological therapy with nifekalant and amiodarone. Landiolol was used as a first-line therapy in the other two patients. In all patients, landiolol, at a dose ranging from 1.0 to 10.0 \u00b5g/kg/min, achieved successful sinus conversion within 15 min. No adverse events, such as bradycardia, hypotension, or hypoglycaemia, were encountered in all four patients.",

    "192": "We investigated the protective effects of sericin on corneal damage due to benzalkonium chloride (BAC) used as a preservative in commercially available timolol maleate eye drops using rat debrided corneal epithelium and a human cornea epithelial cell line (HCE-T). Corneal wounds were monitored using a fundus camera TRC-50X equipped with a digital camera; eye drops were instilled into the rat eyes five times a day after corneal epithelial abrasion. The viability of HCE-T cells was calculated by TetraColor One; and Escherichia coli (ATCC 8739) were used to measure antimicrobial activity. The reducing effects on transcorneal penetration and intraocular pressure (IOP) of the eye drops were determined using rabbits. The corneal wound healing rate and rate constants (kH) as well as cell viability were higher following treatment with 0.005% BAC solution containing 0.1% sericin than in the case of treatment with BAC solution alone; the antimicrobial activity was approximately the same for BAC solutions with and without sericin. In addition, the kH for rat eyes instilled with commercially available timolol maleate eye drops containing 0.1% sericin was significantly higher than that of eyes instilled with timolol maleate eye drops without sericin, and the addition of sericin did not affect the corneal penetration or IOP reducing effect of commercially available timolol maleate eye drops. A preservative system comprising BAC and sericin may provide effective therapy for glaucoma patients requiring long-term anti-glaucoma agents.",

Prepared nanoparticles were coated with Eudragit S100 polymer in order to prevent the release of metoprolol tartrate in the upper GI tract. It was shown that nanoparticles with low size ranges can be obtained with a low feed inlet rate. Micromeritic studies confirmed that nanoparticle batches are discrete and free flowing. Effects of the pore former on drug loading, porosity and in vitro release were studied. It was found that there was an increase in drug loading and porosity with increasing the amount of pore former. In vitro drug release studies showed that an increase in pore former made drug release faster. Release kinetics proved that nanoparticles follow a zero-order release mechanism.",

Reliable, non-invasive technology for retinal oxygen measurements has been scarce and most of the knowledge on retinal oxygenation comes from animal studies. This thesis describes human retinal oximetry, performed with novel retinal oximetry technology. The thesis describes studies on retinal vessel oxygen saturation in (1) light and dark in healthy volunteers, (2) central retinal vein occlusion, (3) branch retinal vein occlusion, (4) central retinal artery occlusion, (5) diabetic retinopathy, (6) patients undergoing glaucoma surgery and (7) patients taking glaucoma medication.",

An attached image splitter allows the simultaneous capture of four images of the same area of the fundus. Two images are used for further analysis, one acquired with 586\u2003nm light and one with 605\u2003nm light. Light absorbance of retinal vessels is sensitive to oxygen saturation at 605\u2003nm but not at 586\u2003nm. Measurement of reflected light at these wavelengths allows estimation of oxygen saturation in the main retinal vessels. This is performed with custom-made analysis software.", 
    "197": "LIGHT AND DARK: After 30\u2003min in the dark, oxygen saturation in retinal arterioles of healthy volunteers was 92\u2003\u00b1\u20034% (mean\u2003\u00b1\u2003SD, n\u2003=\u200315). After 5\u2003min in 80\u2003cd/m(2) light, the arteriolar saturation was 89\u2003\u00b1\u20035%. The decrease was statistically significant (p\u2003=\u20030.008). The corresponding values for retinal venules were 60\u2003\u00b1\u20035% in the dark and 55\u2003\u00b1\u200310% in the light (p\u2003=\u20030.020). Similar results were found after alternating 5\u2003min periods of darkness and light. In a second experiment (n\u2003=\u200319), a significant decrease in retinal vessel oxygen saturation was found in 100\u2003cd/m(2) light compared with darkness but 1 and 10\u2003cd/m(2) light had no significant effect. CENTRAL RETINAL VEIN OCCLUSION: In patients with central retinal vein occlusion, the mean saturation in affected retinal venules was 49\u2003\u00b1\u200312%, while the mean value for venules in the fellow eye was 65\u2003\u00b1\u20036% (mean\u2003\u00b1\u2003SD, p\u2003=\u20030.003, n\u2003=\u20038). The retinal arteriolar saturation was the same in affected (99\u2003\u00b1\u20033%) and the unaffected (99\u2003\u00b1\u20036%) eyes. The venous oxygen saturation showed much variation between affected eyes. BRANCH RETINAL VEIN OCCLUSION: Median oxygen saturation in venules affected by branch retinal vein occlusion was 59% (range, 12-93%, n\u2003=\u200322), while it was 63% (23-80%) in unaffected venules in the affected eye and 55% (39-80%) in venules in the fellow eye. The difference was not statistically significant (p\u2003>\u20030.05). There was a significant difference between affected arterioles (median 101%; range, 89-115%) and unaffected arterioles (95%, 85-104%) in the affected eye (p\u2003<\u20030.05, n\u2003=\u200318). CENTRAL RETINAL ARTERY OCCLUSION: In a patient with a day's history of central retinal artery occlusion due to temporal arteritis, the mean arteriolar saturation was 71\u2003\u00b1\u20039% and 63\u2003\u00b1\u20039% in the venules. One month later, after treatment with prednisolone, the mean arteriolar saturation was 100\u2003\u00b1\u20034% and the venous saturation 54\u2003\u00b1\u20035%. DIABETIC RETINOPATHY: When compared with healthy volunteers (n\u2003=\u200331), patients with all categories of diabetic retinopathy had on average 7-10 percentage points higher saturation in retinal arterioles (p\u2003<\u20030.05 for all categories, n\u2003=\u20036-8 in each category). In venules, the saturation was 8-12 percentage points higher (p\u2003<\u20030.05 for all categories). GLAUCOMA SURGERY: Oxygen saturation in retinal arterioles increased by 2 percentage points on average (p\u2003=\u20030.046, n\u2003=\u200319) with surgery, which lowered intraocular pressure from 23\u2003\u00b1\u20037\u2003mmHg (mean\u2003\u00b1\u2003SD) to 10\u2003\u00b1\u20034\u2003mmHg (p\u2003<\u20030.0001). No other significant changes were found (p\u2003\u2265\u20030.35). DORZOLAMIDE: A significant reduction of 3 percentage points was found in arterioles (p\u2003<\u20030.01) and venules (p\u2003<\u20030.05) when patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension changed from dorzolamide-timolol combination eye drops to timolol alone (n\u2003=\u20036).

The results indicate that retinal vessel oxygen saturation is (1) increased in the dark, (2) lower in venules affected by central retinal vein occlusions, (3) variable in branch retinal vein occlusion, (4) lower in retinal arterioles in central retinal artery occlusion, (5) increased in diabetic retinopathy, (6-7) mildly affected by glaucoma surgery or dorzolamide.", 
    "199": "Open-water cells in unit process treatment wetlands can be used to exploit sunlight photolysis to remove trace organic contaminants from municipal wastewater effluent. To assess the performance of these novel systems, a photochemical model was calibrated using measured photolysis rates for atenolol, carbamazepine, propranolol, and sulfamethoxazole in wetland water under representative conditions. Contaminant transformation by hydroxyl radical ((\u2022)OH) and carbonate radical ((\u2022)CO3(-)) were predicted from steady-state radical concentrations measured at pH values between 8 and 10. Direct photolysis rates and the effects of light screening by dissolved organic matter on photolysis rates were estimated using solar irradiance data, contaminant quantum yields, and light screening factors. The model was applied to predict the land area required for 90% removal of a suite of wastewater-derived organic contaminants by sunlight-induced reactions under a variety of conditions. Results suggest that during summer, open-water cells that receive a million gallons of water per day (i.e., about 4.4 \u00d7 10(-2) m(3) s(-1)) of nitrified wastewater effluent can achieve 90% removal of most compounds in an area of about 15 ha. Transformation rates were strongly affected by pH, with some compounds exhibiting faster transformation rates under the high pH conditions associated with photosynthetic algae at the sediment-water interface and other contaminants exhibiting faster transformation rates at the circumneutral pH values characteristic of algae-free cells. Lower dissolved organic carbon concentrations typically resulted in increased transformation rates.",

Information in literature points to a reduction in mortality, reinfarction and sudden death in first year, especially in patients with high risk, if \u03b2-blockers (BBs) are used after MI. In a perspective study, Zuckerman et al. have determined outcome following pharmacotherapy after acute MI in older adults. It is apparent that a number of matters require consideration in evaluation of the effectiveness of BBs. It seems that not all patients benefit equally from treatment with BBs but such an intervention reduces mortality. It is also important to recognize that the beneficial effects of BBs should not be considered in isolation since the biological system is too complex to manipulate with the use of a single class of drugs.",

    "203": "The extracellular calcium ion concentration ([Ca2+]o) was increased and the BKCa channel was activated, which induced the hyperpolarization of the PSMC membrane in both the CAP models and normal control rats. This effect was weakened with Iberiotoxin (IbTX), a specific blocker of the BKCa channel, but the amplitude of the hyperpolarization was obviously lower in the CAP than in the control group. The DiBAC4 fluorescence intensity induced by hyperpolarization was 18.78 +/- 2.92 in the former and 38.85 +/- 7.10 in the latter (P < 0.05), while that induced by IbTX was 1.61 +/- 0.46 and 6.12 +/- 1.32 (P < 0.05), respectively.",

    "205": "G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are targets of nearly one third of the drugs at the current pharmaceutical market. Despite their importance in many cellular processes the crystal structures are available for less than 20 unique GPCRs of the Rhodopsin-like class. Fortunately, even though involved in different signaling cascades, this large group of membrane proteins has preserved a uniform structure comprising seven transmembrane helices that allows quite reliable comparative modeling. Nevertheless, low sequence similarity between the GPCR family members is still a serious obstacle not only in template selection but also in providing theoretical models of acceptable quality. An additional level of difficulty is the prediction of kinks and bulges in transmembrane helices. Usage of multiple templates and generation of alignments based on sequence profiles may increase the rate of success in difficult cases of comparative modeling in which the sequence similarity between GPCRs is exceptionally low. Here, we present GPCRM, a novel method for fast and accurate generation of GPCR models using averaging of multiple template structures and profile-profile comparison. In particular, GPCRM is the first GPCR structure predictor incorporating two distinct loop modeling techniques: Modeller and Rosetta together with the filtering of models based on the Z-coordinate. We tested our approach on all unique GPCR structures determined to date and report its performance in comparison with other computational methods targeting the Rhodopsin-like class. We also provide a database of precomputed GPCR models of the human receptors from that class.",

    "207": "Optic nerve atrophy caused by abnormal intraocular pressure (IOP) remains the most common cause of irreversible loss of vision worldwide. The aim of this study was to determine whether topically applied IOP-lowering eye drugs affect retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and retinal metabolism in a rat model of optic neuropathy. IOP was elevated through cauterization of episcleral veins, and then lowered either by the daily topical application of timolol, timolol/travoprost, timolol/dorzolamide, or timolol/brimonidine, or surgically with sectorial iridectomy. RGCs were retrogradely labeled 4 days prior to enucleation, and counted. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE), matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry allowed the identification of IOP-dependent proteomic changes. Genomic changes were scrutinized using microarrays and qRT-PCR. The significant increase in IOP induced by episcleral vein cauterization that persisted until 8 weeks of follow-up in control animals (p<0.05) was effectively lowered by the eye drops (p<0.05). As anticipated, the number of RGCs decreased significantly following 8 weeks of elevated IOP (p<0.05), while treatment with combination compounds markedly improved RGC survival (p<0.05). 2D-PAGE and Western blot analyses revealed an IOP-dependent expression of crystallin cry-\u03b2b2. Microarray and qRT-PCR analyses verified the results at the mRNA level. IHC demonstrated that crystallins were expressed mainly in the ganglion cell layer. The data suggest that IOP and either topically applied antiglaucomatous drugs influence crystallin expression within the retina. Neuronal crystallins are thus suitable biomarkers for monitoring the progression of neuropathy and evaluating any neuroprotective effects.", 
    "208": "We hypothesized that some characteristics of beta-blockers, including negative inotropic, peripheral vasoconstrictor, and antiangiogenic effects, might be potentially useful in treating children with epistaxis. From June 2010 to March 2012, a total of seven children with recurrent primary epistaxis resistant to conventional management were observed at our institution. An overall effectiveness of propranolol was noted in all seven children when given a dose of 1.5-2 mg/kg/day (divided into three doses) as a second line therapy for terminating epistaxis. Based on our first experience, we believe that propranolol could be a favorable treatment option for patients with primary epistaxis."
