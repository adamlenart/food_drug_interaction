The mechanism of the hypotensive effect of ATP has been proved due to the antagonizing action of the agent to the vasoconstriction by noradrenaline and/or sympathetic nerve stimulation. In these 3 cases, ATP has been safely and effectively applied to control blood pressure in pheochromocytoma. ATP could be used as the first-choice drug to keep the circulatory state stable during surgery for pheochromocytoma.",

    "2": "An attempt to develop a highly cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist devoid of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) focused on exploring structure-activity relationships around (S)-[p-[3-[[2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethyl]amino]-2-hydroxypropoxy] phenyl]-4-(2-thienyl)imidazole. Strategies to reduce or eliminate ISA centered on structural changes that could influence activation of the receptor by the drug itself or by a metabolite. The approaches involved (a) eliminating the acidic imidazole N-H proton, (b) incorporating substituents ortho to the beta-adrenergic blocking side chain, (c) increasing steric bulk around the N-H moiety, (d) decreasing lipophilicity, (e) introducing intramolecular hydrogen bonding involving the imidazole N-H, and (f) displacing the imidazole ring from an activating position by the incorporation of a spacer element. The compounds were investigated in vitro for beta-adrenoceptor antagonism and in vivo for ISA. From these studies, the most successful variation involved the insertion of a spacer between the imidazole and aryl rings. (S)-4-Acetyl-2-[[4-[3-[[2-(3, 4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethyl]amino]-2-hydroxypropoxy]phenyl]methyl] imidazole (S-51) was demonstrated to be highly cardioselective (dose ratio beta 2/beta 1 greater than 9333) and devoid of ISA.", 
    "3": "The pharmacodynamics and onset of action of esmolol, a novel, cardioselective beta adrenergic receptor antagonist with an ultra short duration of action, were studied in anesthetized dogs. Steady-state levels of beta blockade were attained within 10 min after initiation of esmolol infusion or when changing infusion rates. Similarly, steady-state blood levels of esmolol were attained within 30 min (the earliest sampling point) after starting an infusion and new steady-state blood levels were re-established again within 30 min after changing the infusion rates. Rapid recovery from beta blockade after termination of the esmolol infusion was paralleled by a rapid decline in blood levels of esmolol. The duration of action and elimination half-life both averaged less than 15 min. Excellent linear correlations were obtained between dose and steady-state blood concentration and the logarithm of the steady-state blood concentration and percentage of beta blockade. In a separate study, the onset of beta blockade with esmolol was observed within 15 sec of initiating a 60-sec infusion of 500 micrograms/kg/min. Peak beta blockade occurred at 30 to 45 sec after switching to a maintenance dose of 12.5, 25 or 50 micrograms/kg/min. The duration of peak effect was dependent on the maintenance dose. Peak blood levels of esmolol occurred immediately after stopping the loading dose and decreased to steady-state blood levels at 20 and 10 min after maintenance doses of 25 and 50 micrograms/kg/min, respectively. The results of these studies indicate that the onset, time to steady state and termination of beta blockade with esmolol are rapid and that an excellent correlation exists between the blood level of the drug and degree of beta blockade both during and after an esmolol infusion.", 
    "4": "The recovery of guinea-pig lung beta adrenoreceptors and beta adrenergic-mediated airway responsiveness was studied after irreversible receptor blockade with bromoacetylalprenololmentane (BAAM). The antagonist receptor concentration and those receptors able to form the agonist high affinity binding state were determined by (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol (DHA) and [3H]hydroxybenzylisoproterenol (HBI) binding, respectively. Airway responsiveness was measured by the ability of isoproterenol infusions to shift the histamine dose-response curve for airway constriction. Twenty-four hours after a single i.p. injection of BAAM (20 mg/kg), both [3H]DHA and [3H]HBI binding were reduced by 48 to 51% without changing the KD value for either ligand. In addition, there was a complete block of airway responsiveness to isoproterenol infusion at 1 microgram/kg/min although responsiveness similar to control values was observed at a higher infusion rate (10 micrograms/kg/min). Ninety-six hours after BAAM treatment, [3H]DHA binding had recovered to the control value whereas no recovery of [3H]HBI binding or of airway responsiveness was observed. By 144 hr after injection, both [3H]HBI binding and airway responsiveness had recovered to control values. The data indicate that after irreversible blockade, the total receptor population as measured by antagonists recovers relatively quickly followed by a slower recovery of those receptors able to form the agonist high affinity binding state that parallels the recovery of airway responsiveness.", 
    "5": "These studies were undertaken to determine the effects of propranolol on catecholamine synthesis and uptake in the rat central nervous system. The effects of propranolol on catecholamine synthesis were studied in vitro in striatal and hypothalamic synaptosomes, and also in vivo. In addition, the effects of propranolol on catecholamine uptake in striatal and hypothalamic synaptosomes were evaluated. Propranolol inhibited synaptosomal catecholamine synthesis and uptake in both tissues. Norepinephrine uptake in the hypothalamus was most sensitive to propranolol inhibition (IC50 = 5 microM). Dopamine synthesis in striatal synaptosomes was also inhibited markedly, with an IC50 = 8 microM. After in vivo administration, propranolol decreased the accumulation of dopa in the striatum, confirming propranolol's synthesis inhibiting effect in dopaminergic terminals. Studies of soluble striatal tyrosine hydroxylase revealed that propranolol has a direct inhibitory effect on the enzyme. These results indicate that propranolol administration may cause a potentiation of norepinephrine activity specifically at alpha receptors, due to concurrent beta receptor blockade and inhibition of norepinephrine reuptake and a decrease in dopamine activity at dopaminergic receptor sites due to an inhibition of dopamine formation.", 
    "6": "The evidence supporting the effective pharmacotherapy of the panic disorders is reviewed. The medications discussed include the tricyclic antidepressants, the monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and the benzodiazepines. Clinical guidelines are developed for each group and cover such issues as side effects, dosing, length of treatment, and relapse after discontinuation of medications. Although this paper primarily reviews the pharmacologic treatment of panic disorders, nonpharmacologic behavioral treatments are briefly discussed, especially as they relate to the pharmacologic treatment of these disorders.", 
    "7": "To investigate the possible role of arginine vasopressin in maintaining high blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), the effect of two arginine vasopressin pressor antagonists on mean arterial pressure and the pressor responsiveness to exogenous arginine vasopressin were studied in conscious, freely moving SHR and in Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). Intravenous injections of either d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)arginine vasopressin, 10 micrograms/kg, or dPTyr(Me)arginine vasopressin, 20 micrograms/kg, had no effect on mean arterial pressure or heart rate of normohydrated SHR, although both antagonists almost completely abolished the pressor response to exogenous arginine vasopressin. Furthermore, dPTyr(Me)arginine vasopressin was ineffective in eliciting a depressor response, even after 24 or 48 hours of water deprivation. During converting enzyme inhibition with SQ 20881, mean arterial pressure and heart rate remained unchanged following arginine vasopressin blockade in both normohydrated and fluid-restricted animals. alpha-Adrenergic receptor blockade reduced the blood pressure of normohydrated SHR, from 160 +/- 7 to 81 +/- 8 mm Hg. When dPTyr(Me)arginine vasopressin was given during alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade there was a small, transient fall in mean arterial pressure. The pressor responsiveness to exogenous arginine vasopressin was similar in hypertensive and normotensive rats. These results suggest that arginine vasopressin does not function as an important pressor hormone in conscious SHR.", 
    "8": "Baseline plasma vasopressin concentrations were measured in 48 men (all 50 years old) with decreased plasma renin concentration and untreated, sustained essential hypertension and in 29 healthy normotensive men. Mean hypertensive plasma vasopressin concentration was more than twice as high as the corresponding normotensive level (15.7 +/- 2.2 [SE] vs 7.5 +/- 1.0 pg/ml; p less than 0.001). Plasma renin concentration in the hypertensive group was reduced compared with that in the normotensive group (0.28 +/- 0.04 vs 0.46 +/- 0.06 Goldblatt units X 10(-4)/ml). These differences appeared despite virtually identical serum osmolality, creatinine clearance, and urinary sodium excretion in the two groups. In the first 38 hypertensive subjects, arterial plasma epinephrine concentrations were significantly increased over those of the first 28 control subjects (99 +/- 12 vs 68 +/- 6 pg/ml; p less than 0.025). In contrast to those with low renin essential hypertension, 35 men with normal renin essential hypertension (all 40 years old) had normal plasma vasopressin levels that were not significantly different from those in a comparable normotensive control group (3.7 +/- 0.8 vs 3.5 +/- 0.4 pg/ml). Arterial epinephrine concentrations were not significantly different between normal renin subjects and the control group. After 6 weeks of treatment with the nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor blocker oxprenolol in 11 subjects with low renin hypertension, blood pressure was reduced and the plasma vasopressin concentration fell from 27.6 +/- 6.4 to 13.5 +/- 4.2 pg/ml (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "9": "To determine the clinical characteristics of patients with life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias with no identifiable heart disease, we analyzed six patients who presented with either cardiac arrest or syncope associated with documented ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. Electrocardiographic and echocardiographic examination and cardiac catheterization results were normal in all patients. Electrocardiographic monitoring revealed ventricular tachycardia in all patients. Exercise testing did not provoke sustained ventricular tachycardia in any patient. Programmed extrastimulation did not induce ventricular tachycardia in any patient. Isoproterenol infusion facilitated provocation of sustained ventricular tachycardia in only one patient. All six patients were treated with solitary beta-blocker therapy. Following treatment, there was a significant reduction in the incidence of ventricular tachycardia, couplets and total ventricular ectopic beats. During a follow-up period ranging from 16 to 36 (mean 22) months, all patients remain alive without clinically significant recurrence. Therefore, patients with life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias without identifiable heart disease may respond to solitary beta-blocker therapy.", 
    "10": "Carvedilol (BM 14.190) has been shown to have beta-adrenergic blocking and vasodilating activity. By means of digital plethysmography, the threshold for vasodilation was ascertained at a dose of 2.6 mg iv infused over 1 hour. The oral threshold dose was established at about 15 mg, with a linear increase in response (r = 0.78) up to 76.5 mg. This dose increased blood flow to the forearm by reduction of arterial resistance. Although venous capacity was not changed, postural symptoms in three subjects could also be indicative of venous involvement. Carvedilol, 50 mg, reduced exercise heart rate for about 10 hours.", 
    "11": "Beta blockade with propranolol for 7 days in healthy normotensive dogs produced a sustained 20-25% drop in heart rate, but only a transient suppression of blood pressure. Plasma renin activity and prorenin were also suppressed transiently, suggesting that both are under beta-receptor regulation. Bilateral nephrectomy (2NX) was followed by rapid clearance of renin from the circulation, at a rate that was minimally influenced by beta blockade. In contrast, the plasma prorenin level rose markedly to a peak within an hour after surgery, leveled off during the next 24 hr, dropped almost toward the pre-2NX baseline by 48 hr, but proceeded to rise again between 48 and 120 hr. Propranolol administration before and during the 2NX period reduced the detectable prorenin, suggesting that its extrarenal source is under beta-adrenergic regulation. The rapid increment of prorenin after 2NX suggests that extrarenal prorenin may have constituted part of the total plasma prorenin before 2NX, and/or had developed sufficiently quickly afterwards to replace and exceed the disappearing renal prorenin. Any fresh increment beyond 48 hr could presumably have been only extrarenal. These observations suggest the existence of a rich beta-regulated extrarenal source of prorenin capable of rapidly supplying the plasma. However, no renin-angiotesin was apparently produced from this prorenin in the nephrectomized state, implying the lack of renal \"convertase,\" without which the prorenin convertase mechanism as a whole was rendered ineffective. The source of the extrarenal prorenin and the identity of the renal convertase remain to be established.", 
    "12": "Both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors have been identified in human myometrium by radioligand binding. Both types of receptors mediate uterine contractility: alpha-adrenergic agonists cause uterine contraction, whereas beta-adrenergic agonists induce relaxation. We studied the possible regulatory effects of gonadal steroids on the affinity, concentration, subtype distribution, and linkage to adenylate cyclase of beta-adrenergic receptors in human myometrium removed during different phases of the menstrual cycle, from postmenopausal women and during depo-progestin (medroxyprogesterone acetate) therapy. We identified beta-adrenergic receptors in human myometrial membranes using the radiolabeled antagonist (--)-[3H]-dihydroalprenolol (DHA). The binding of this radioligand was rapid, reversible, of high affinity (KD = 0.71 nM) and stereo-selective. Total beta-receptor concentration was determined by Scatchard analysis of DHA saturation binding and the ratio of receptor subtypes determined by computer-assisted analysis of beta 2 selective antagonist ICI 118 551/DHA competition binding curves. The fraction of receptors functionally coupled to adenylate cyclase was determined by the agonist/N-ethylmaleimide inactivation method. The affinity of DHA and the fraction of receptors undergoing functional coupling was similar under all hormonal conditions. However, whereas the net concentration of beta-receptors was the same in all groups, beta 1-adrenoreceptors could only be detected in myometrial particulate fractions from uteri obtained in the midfollicular phase, indicating the importance of considering adrenoreceptor subtypes as separately regulatable receptors.", 
    "13": "The effects of arotinolol on changes in renin release in rat kidney cortical slices in response to isoproterenol (IP) or norepinephrine (NE), were studied in comparison with those of AC-623, a main metabolite of arotinolol, and other typical adrenoceptor antagonists. Arotinolol, at concentrations of 10(-8) to 10(-4) mol/l, inhibited the increasing effect of 10(-6) mol/l IP on renin release, in a concentration-dependent manner. Similar results were observed with AC-623, propranolol or labetalol, although the inhibitory potencies of these agents were considerably lower than that of arotinolol. The blocking effect of arotinolol on the 10(-5) mol/l NE-induced decrease in renin release was much less potent than seen with other alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agents such as prazosin, phenoxybenzamine and labetalol. These data suggest that the potent blocking effects of arotinolol and its metabolite on the increased renin release in response to beta-adrenoceptor stimulation may contribute to the antihypertensive effect of this agent.", 
    "14": "Adrenergic receptor interaction with isoflurane was studied in an in vitro rat parotid gland model in which beta-adrenoceptor agonists evoke amylase release and alpha-adrenoceptor agonists induce potassium secretion from parotid cells. The amylase secretory studies were performed using a batch-incubation technique, and potassium efflux was evaluated using 86Rb+ as a probe for K+. Isoflurane was dissolved in a fat emulsion, which of its own had no secretory effect. Isoflurane induced a dose-dependent amylase release that was unaffected by beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol and metoprolol. Isoflurane also induced a significant efflux of 86Rb+ that could not be inhibited by the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist, phentolamine. Dinitrophenol, an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation, had no effect on the isoflurane-induced enzyme release, indicating that amylase secretion occurred by passive leakage. It is suggested that isoflurane has no direct action on alpha- or beta-adrenoceptors. Isoflurane, however, induces potent cellular events that might be due to an unspecific effect on the cell membrane, thereby causing changes in membrane permeability.", 
    "15": "For many drugs, only racemic mixtures are available for clinical use. Because different stereoisomers of drugs often cause different physiological responses, the use of pure isomers could elicit more exact therapeutic effects. Differential complexation of a variety of drug stereoisomers by immobilized beta-cyclodextrin was investigated. Chiral recognition and racemic resolution were observed with a number of compounds from such clinically useful classes as beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, sedative hypnotics, antihistamines, anticonvulsants, diuretics, and synthetic opiates. Separation of the diastereomers of the cardioactive and antimalarial cinchona alkaloids and of two antiestrogens was demonstrated as well. Three dimensional projections of beta-cyclodextrin complexes of propanolol, which is resolved by this technique, and warfarin, which is not, are compared. These studies have improved the understanding and application of the chiral interactions of beta-cyclodextrin, and they have demonstrated a means to measure optical purity and to isolate or produce pure enantiomers of drugs. In addition, this highly specific technique could also be used in the pharmacological evaluation of enantiomeric drugs.", 
    "16": "Cultured rat glioma C6 cells exfoliate membrane vesicles which have been termed 'exosomes' into the culture medium. The exosomes contained both stimulatory and inhibitory GTP-binding components of adenylate cyclase (the stimulatory, Gs, and the inhibitory, Gi, regulatory components) and beta-adrenergic receptors but were devoid of adenylate cyclase activity. It was therefore apparent that the catalytic component of adenylate cyclase was either not exfoliated or was inactivated during the exfoliation process. The presence of Gs or Gi in the exosomes was detected by ADP ribosylation using [alpha-32P]NAD in the presence of cholera or pertussis toxins, respectively. The exosomal concentration of each of the two components was estimated to be about one fifth of that of the cell membrane when expressed on a per mg protein basis. Exosomal Gs was almost as active as the membrane-derived Gs in its ability to reconstitute NaF- and guanine nucleotide-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in membranes of S49 cyc- cells, which lack a functional Gs. The ability of exosomal Gs to reconstitute isoproterenol-stimulated activity, however, was much lower than that of membrane Gs. The density of beta-adrenergic receptors in the exosomes was much less than that found in the membranes. Although the exosomal receptors bound the antagonist iodocyanopindolol with the same affinity as receptors from the cell membrane, the affinity for the agonist isoproterenol was 13- to 18-fold lower in the exosomes. In addition, this affinity was not modulated by GTP in the exosomes. Thus, exfoliated beta-adrenergic receptors seem to be impaired in their ability to couple to and activate Gs. This was directly tested by coupling the receptors to a foreign adenylate cyclase using membrane fusion. The fusates were then assayed for agonist-stimulated activity. While significant stimulation of the acceptor adenylate cyclase was obtained using C6 membrane receptors, the exosomal receptors were completely inactive. Thus during exfoliation, there appear to be changes in the components of the beta-adrenergic-sensitive adenylate cyclase that results in a nonfunctional system in the exosomes.", 
    "17": "This paper presents a rapid, simple and economical method for assaying pindolol concentrations in plasma and urine by high-performance liquid chromatography using ultraviolet detection. It is sensitive enough for use in single-dose pharmacokinetic studies and may also be used to determine pindolol concentrations in the plasma from patients taking the drug, provided that the patient is not taking any of the drugs which interfere with the method. Drugs which were found to interfere with the pindolol peak are quinidine, n-acetylprocainamide and lidocaine. Disopyramide, oxprenolol and levobunolol interfered with the internal standard peak.", 
    "18": "In the presence of atropine, electrical field stimulation of frog atria produced a positive inotropic response. This response had two components. The initial phase was blocked by selective desensitization of P2-purinoceptors with alpha, beta-methylene ATP. The second phase, which was not always clearly separated from the initial phase, was blocked by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol. The present results suggest that ATP may be a cotransmitter released with adrenaline from nerve terminals of the vagosympathetic trunk supplying the frog atria.", 
    "19": "In anesthetized, vagotomized rabbits the plasma concentration of immunoreactive atrial natriuretic peptide (IR-ANP) was found to be 58.5 +/- 3.4 pg/mL (n = 18) when measured using a radio-immunoassay. Tachycardia, induced by electrical pacing of the right atrium, resulted in increased plasma levels of IR-ANP. The size of the increase in IR-ANP appeared to be related to the degree of tachycardia induced. The release of IR-ANP with tachycardia was unaffected by beta-adrenergic blockade with atenolol (2 mg/kg), muscarinic blockade with atropine (2 mg/kg) or ganglionic blockade with hexamethonium (10 mg/kg). The results show that IR-ANP is released in response to tachycardia and that this does not involve a neuronal reflex.", 
    "20": "Two hundred twenty-six patients with mild to moderate hypertension were treated with terazosin in an open, multicenter study to determine the drug's long-term efficacy and safety. All patients had previously received terazosin in a short-term study; 66 patients entered from later short-term studies and had experienced a 7 mm Hg decrease in supine diastolic blood pressure in response to terazosin. Terazosin was administered once or twice daily either alone or in combination with a diuretic and/or a beta blocker. Supine systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly decreased from baseline during time intervals ending at 90, 180, 360, and 720 days of long-term therapy. No clinically significant trends were observed in pulse rate, clinical laboratory test results, physical examinations, or electrocardiograms. Patients had a tendency toward a slight weight gain. The most common adverse experiences attributed to terazosin monotherapy were dizziness and asthenia (9.7 percent and 6.6 percent, respectively). Adverse experiences were usually of mild or moderate severity. Of the 226 patients who underwent long-term therapy, 29 (13 percent) withdrew because of adverse experiences, and three (1 percent) withdrew because of uncontrolled blood pressure. This study demonstrates that terazosin is effective and safe for long-term treatment of hypertension.", 
    "21": "In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial, the efficacy and safety of terazosin in combination with other antihypertensive agents were assessed using patients with inadequately controlled essential hypertension (supine diastolic blood pressure 95 mm Hg or greater). Of 138 evaluable patients, the terazosin-treated group (n = 84) achieved a significant (p less than 0.05) mean reduction of 7.3 mm Hg in supine diastolic blood pressure when compared with the placebo-treated group (n = 54) who achieved a reduction of 0.6 mm Hg. Analysis of patients by background therapeutic categories (beta blocker, beta blocker plus diuretic, or \"other\") revealed that terazosin caused a significantly greater decrease in supine diastolic blood pressure than did placebo when added to the combination of beta blocker plus diuretic (decrease of 7.2 mm Hg for the terazosin group versus a decrease of 1.5 mm Hg for the placebo group) and to other antihypertensive drugs (decrease of 7.9 mm Hg for the terazosin group versus a decrease of 1.0 mm Hg for the placebo group). Significant differences between treatment groups were also observed for supine systolic and for standing systolic and diastolic blood pressure variables in select subgroups. The addition of terazosin did not cause significant changes in physical examinations or electrocardiograms. Changes in pulse rates and body weight did not differ significantly between treatment groups for any background therapeutic category. The overall incidence of adverse experiences was only somewhat greater for terazosin-treated than placebo-treated patients. These results suggest that terazosin is safe and effective when administered in combination with other antihypertensive drugs.", 
    "22": "As millions more patients with mild hypertension are being brought into active drug therapy, the need for effective medications that are safe for long-term use has increased. This is, in part, as a result of the adverse effect on coronary heart disease mortality observed in two of the major therapeutic trials, the Oslo Study and the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial. In both of these, the diuretic-first, stepped-care approach was used. Administration of diuretics is frequently associated with such biochemical abnormalities as hypokalemia, hypercholesterolemia, and hyperglycemia. Thus, the wisdom of the routine use of a diuretic as the first choice of therapy is being questioned. Alternative drugs for initial therapy include beta blockers and selective alpha 1 blockers. With beta blockers, there is a tendency for serum triglycerides to increase and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to decline, as well as a tendency for an undesirable reduction in cardiac output and an increase in peripheral resistance. Selective alpha 1 blockers, because they lower blood pressure in a hemodynamically more favorable manner and have a tendency to improve the lipid profile, are becoming increasingly attractive as initial therapy for mild hypertension and also as part of the combination needed for more severe disease. The favorable results noted with the new selective alpha 1 blocker terazosin strongly support its addition to the list of preferred drugs for initial therapy.", 
    "23": "Remarkable progress has been made during the past 30 years in the management of hypertension, a disease that affects approximately one out of every four adults in the United States. In the 1960s, at least half of the individuals with hypertension were unaware of their disease, and the blood pressures of fewer than 20 percent were controlled at normotensive levels. In contrast, in the 1980s, only a small percentage, perhaps as few as 10 or 15 percent of hypertensive patients, are unaware of their disease and, in many parts of the country, more than 60 percent are being treated to goal blood pressure levels. More effective treatment of hypertension is probably a major reason for the 45 percent decrease in stroke mortality rates in the last 12 years alone and for the dramatic decrease in the number of hypertensive patients in whom renal failure or congestive heart failure develops. In addition, at least a portion of the 25 to 30 percent decrease in coronary mortality rates can probably be attributed to better management of patients with hypertension. The availability of antihypertensive drugs in the 1950s (rauwolfia preparations, veratrum derivatives, thiocyanates, hydralazine, and the ganglion blockers) and the discovery of more effective agents in the period from the 1960s to the present have dramatically improved the prognosis of hypertensive patients. Thiazide diuretics, centrally acting sympatholytic agents, beta-adrenergic inhibitors, and, more recently, selective alpha-adrenergic inhibitors, converting-enzyme inhibitors, and calcium entry blockers are examples of these medications. All of these agents have some side effects, with varying patient acceptability. The search continues for newer drugs that are well tolerated, that lower blood pressure by reducing peripheral resistance, and that produce few metabolic changes. A detailed review of the physiologic effects of antihypertensive medications, as well as a critique of the clinical trials and some of the problems noted in the pharmacologic management of hypertension, is presented.", 
    "24": "The haemodynamic effects of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of neuropeptide Y (NPY) in urethane-anaesthetized rats were studied. In Sprague-Dawley rats, NPY increased both blood pressure and heart rate in a dose-dependent manner. This response was unaffected by removal of the adrenal medullae or pretreatment with a specific vasopressin antagonist (180 ng/kg i.v.), but was abolished by phenoxybenzamine (1mg/kg i.v.). After pretreatment with propranolol (1mg/kg i.v.), the tachycardia was inhibited and the pressor response was of shorter duration than in controls. In 6-hydroxydopamine treated rats (two doses of 250 micrograms i.c.v., three days apart), NPY still elicited a pressor response and tachycardia, which were significantly higher than controls 15 minutes after the injection. Plasma levels of vasopressin were not altered by i.c.v. administration of NPY. However, in Brattleboro rats the peptide had no haemodynamic effects. Our results suggest that activation of sympathetic nervous system but not release of vasopressin or adrenal catecholamines into the bloodstream mediates the cardiovascular response to NPY. Central vasopressin pathways however may be involved.", 
    "25": "The adrenergic control of glucose homeostasis is mediated in part through variations in the release of pancreatic hormones. In this study, purified pancreatic A and B cells were used to identify the recognition and messenger units involved in the adrenergic regulation of glucagon and insulin release. Catecholamines induced beta-adrenergic receptor activity in A cells and alpha 2-adrenergic receptor activity in B cells. The two recognition units provoked opposite variations in the production of cellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate, the beta-adrenergic unit enhancing the nucleotide's permissive effect on amino acid-induced glucagon release and the alpha 2-adrenergic unit inhibiting that upon glucose-induced insulin release. In both cell types, catecholamines interact powerfully with the synergistic control of hormone release by nutrient- and (neuro)hormone-driven messenger systems.", 
    "26": "We evaluated the use of topically administered betaxolol, a cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocking agent, in 11 patients (eight women and three men, 40 to 81 years old) who had asthma and severe glaucoma with increased intraocular pressure despite maximally tolerated medical therapy. In each of these patients, timolol was either contraindicated or had previously led to development of pulmonary symptoms or complications. Before betaxolol, mean forced expiratory volumes in one second were 66% in the men and 80% in the women of reported normal values in age- and height-matched groups. Betaxolol was then topically administered twice daily. All patients continued to administer betaxolol without exacerbation of pulmonary symptoms and without deterioration in measured pulmonary function tests. Betaxolol further reduced intraocular pressure by a mean of 18% (4 mm Hg) when added to the patients' otherwise maximal regimen.", 
    "27": "Four murine monoclonal antibodies specific for alprenolol, a synthetic beta-adrenergic ligand, with different binding properties towards alprenolol and other beta-adrenergic antagonists and agonists (as described in a previous report) were used to induce anti-idiotypic responses in rabbits and mice. Three of the rabbit anti-idiotypes inhibited, and one increased the binding of tritiated dihydroalprenolol to the Ab1 against which they were induced. The syngeneic mouse anti-idiotypes all had an inhibitory effect on the ligand binding to their corresponding Ab1. Cross-reactivity tests of the xenogeneic and syngeneic anti-idiotypes were positive only for two monoclonal anti-alprenolol antibodies. Cross-reaction could be shown neither on a panel of 15 other monoclonals, nor on polyclonal anti-alprenolol antibodies of the BALB/c and the C57BL/10 mice. These results suggest that the immune response against alprenolol results in antibodies with mostly private idiotypic determinants. Moreover, the properties of the anti-idiotypic response against the same monoclonal antibody seem to be different according to the species used for anti-idiotypic induction.", 
    "28": "We conducted a six-month prospective, double-masked randomized trial comparing betaxolol with timolol at 0.25% and 0.5% concentrations in the treatment of primary open-angle glaucoma in 38 patients. To qualify, patients had to demonstrate an average intraocular pressure in at least one eye of greater than or equal to 26 mm Hg without treatment. The median intraocular pressure was consistently lower in the timolol group than in the betaxolol group (after four weeks of therapy, it was 20.2 mm Hg for timolol vs 22.5 mm Hg for betaxolol; P less than .04). Adjunctive therapy was required in eight patients in the betaxolol group compared to one in the timolol group (P less than .05). Betaxolol appears to be a clinically effective and safe agent in the treatment of open-angle glaucoma. However, the magnitude of the decrease in intraocular pressure with it may not be as great as that with timolol and there may be a greater need for adjunctive therapy with it than with timolol.", 
    "29": "The interaction between epinephrine and insulin in modulating in vivo glucose metabolism within individual tissues of the body has not previously been examined. This was investigated using the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic (120 milliunits/liter) clamp combined with administration of [3H]2-deoxyglucose and D-[U-14C]glucose. Epinephrine produced whole body insulin resistance due to increased hepatic glucose output and reduced peripheral glucose disposal. Despite elevated insulin levels liver glycogen content was reduced by 50% during epinephrine infusion (5 nM). However, this effect was transient, occurring predominantly during the initial 60 min of study. These effects were prevented during beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol and potentiated during alpha 1-adrenergic blockade with prazosin. The most significant effect of epinephrine in peripheral tissues was increased glycogenolysis in both oxidative and glycolytic skeletal muscle. A significant reduction in insulin-mediated [3H]2-deoxyglucose uptake (30%) was evident in 5 of 9 muscles tested during epinephrine infusion. This effect was most pronounced in the more insulin-sensitive oxidative muscles. The latter effect was probably indirectly mediated via increased glycogenolysis--increased accumulation of metabolites--inhibition of hexokinase. In addition, it is evident that insulin-mediated glycogen synthesis occurred during epinephrine infusion. All effects of epinephrine on muscle glucose metabolism were prevented by propranolol but not prazosin. Similar effects to that observed in muscle were not evident in adipose tissue. It is concluded that epinephrine may override many of the actions of insulin in vivo, and most of these effects are mediated via the beta-adrenergic receptor. In the intact rat there may be a complex interaction between alpha- and beta-adrenergic effects in regulating hepatic glucose output.", 
    "30": "Management of patients with chest pain and hypothyroidism is a clinical dilemma. Thyroid replacement therapy may exacerbate angina pectoris. Administration of a beta blocker such as propranolol (Inderal) concomitantly with thyroid replacement therapy is useful in treatment of angina. However, beta blockers can induce variant angina owing to increased norepinephrine secretion and enhanced alpha-mediated responsiveness in the hypothyroid state. Hypotension and syncopal episodes may develop in the hypothyroid patient after administration of nitrates. Cardiac catheterization and revascularization are well tolerated by myxedematous patients with angina. After surgery, full thyroid replacement therapy should be initiated gradually and with caution.", 
    "31": "Sarcolemma-enriched preparations from muscles rich in slow oxidative red fibres contained specific binding sites for the alpha 1 antagonist, prazosin (e.g. soleus Kd 0.13 nM, Bmax 29 fmol/mg protein). Binding sites for prazosin were almost absent from white muscle. Displacement of prazosin binding from sarcolemma of soleus muscle (phentolamine greater than phenylephrine greater than idazoxan greater than yohimbine) suggested that the receptors were alpha 1. Binding sites for dihydroalprenolol (beta antagonist) were also more concentrated on red than white muscle and outnumbered prazosin sites by approx. 10:1. Binding sites for idazoxan (alpha 2 antagonist) were undetectable. Contamination of sarcolemma-enriched preparations by endothelial tissue indicated by the activity of angiotensin converting enzyme did not correlate with prazosin binding. It is concluded that post-synaptic alpha 1 adrenergic receptors are present on the sarcolemma of slow oxidative red fibres of rat skeletal muscle. The presence provides the mechanistic basis for apparent alpha-adrenergic effects to increase glucose and oxygen uptake in perfused rat hindquarter.", 
    "32": "Light microscopic autoradiography showed that the supposedly beta-adrenoceptor-selective radioligand [125I]iodocyanopindolol (I-CYP) bound to sites in both the guinea-pig tracheal epithelium and smooth muscle that were sensitive to propranolol and isoprenaline. Low levels of binding were associated with sub-epithelial mucosal cells. Ascorbic acid caused a concentration-related increase in total I-CYP binding which was predominantly associated with the sub-epithelial mucosa, was not inhibited by propranolol, and was thus not associated with beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "33": "The fluorescence of 1,8-anilinonaphthalene sulfonate is enhanced and blue-shifted upon binding to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, a human plasma protein of uncertain function. Fluorescence titrations of delipidated protein indicate at least two classes of binding sites having dissociation constants of 0.33 microM and 12 microM at 25 degrees C in 0.02 M potassium phosphate/0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.4. Exclusion chromatography measurements indicate only 1 binding site per mol protein, suggesting that the heterogeneity is due to differences between protein molecules, the origin of which remains unclear. The fluorescence of a mixture of dye and protein is progressively diminished upon addition of ethanol and other organic solvents whose presence could be detected at concentrations as low as 100 mM. Addition of the adrenergic drug propranolol to a mixture of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (2.5 microM) and 1,8-anilinonaphthalene sulfonate (4 microM) caused a hyperbolic decrease in dye fluorescence to 30% of the initial value, with half-maximal response near 1 microM propranolol. When the protein-dye mixture was heated, the fluorescence of the dye exhibited a reversible downward transition with midpoint near 65 degrees C, compared to a midpoint of 58.5 degrees C obtained by intrinsic fluorescence in the absence of dye. This stabilization was confirmed with fluorescein-labeled protein, whose fluorescence polarization revealed a melting transition at 58.8 degrees C in the absence of ligands which increased by 5-6 Cdeg in the presence of 1,8-anilinonaphthalene sulfonate or propranolol. The sensitivity of 1,8-anilinonaphthalene sulfonate fluorescence to changes in the conformation and ligand environment of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein should facilitate efforts to understand the structure and function of this acute-phase reactant.", 
    "34": "To investigate dobutamine-induced cardiac adaptations, we compared dobutamine-treated with swim-trained and sedentary control rats. After 14 wk of treatment, heart rate was lower in the dobutamine-treated (279 +/- 6) and exercise-trained (287 +/- 4 beats/min) groups than in the control animals (305 +/- 3 beats/min; P less than 0.05). The exercised rats gained less weight (164 +/- 11 g; P less than 0.05) than the dobutamine-treated (238 +/- 16 g) and the control animals (231 +/- 12 g). Also, compared with the two other groups, the exercise group had higher relative heart weights (3.47 +/- 0.08 vs. 2.82 +/- 0.06 and 2.90 +/- 0.05 g/kg in the dobutamine and control groups, respectively; P less than 0.05) and lower epididymal fat pad weights (6.6 +/- 0.4 vs. 13.3 +/- 1.0 and 11.4 +/- 0.5 g/kg in the dobutamine and control groups, respectively; P less than 0.05). However, both the maximum heart rate produced by isoproterenol and the isoproterenol dose producing 50% of the peak heart rate response were similar among the three groups. Myocardial norepinephrine content, beta-adrenergic receptor number, and adenylate cyclase activation by isoproterenol, NaF, 5'-guanylyl imidodiphosphate, and forskolin also did not differ. Thus, although there were differences between the dobutamine-treated and the exercised rats, the two groups were similar in that they developed bradycardia that was not due to cardiac adrenergic desensitization.", 
    "35": "We examined the prevalence and prognostic importance of silent myocardial ischemia detected by continuous electrocardiographic monitoring in 70 patients with unstable angina. All the patients received intensive medical treatment with nitrates, beta-blockers, and calcium-channel blockers. Continuous electrocardiographic recordings were made during the first two days in the coronary care unit to quantify the frequency and duration of asymptomatic ischemic episodes, defined as a transient ST-segment shift of 1 mm or more. Thirty-seven patients (Group 1) had at least one episode of silent ischemia, and the other 33 patients had no silent ischemia (Group 2). Over the subsequent month, myocardial infarction occurred in 6 patients in Group 1 and in only 1 in Group 2 (P less than 0.01); bypass surgery or angioplasty was required for recurrent symptomatic angina in 10 patients in Group 1 and only 3 in Group 2 (P = 0.02). Survival-curve analysis demonstrated that silent ischemia was associated with these outcomes (P less than 0.002), and multivariate analysis showed that silent ischemia was the best predictor of these outcomes among the 15 variables tested (P less than 0.002). Patients in Group 1 with 60 minutes or more of silent ischemia per 24 hours had a worse prognosis than those with under 60 minutes per 24 hours (P = 0.04). Silent ischemia occurred in more than 50 percent of our patients with unstable angina, despite intensive medical therapy, and it identified a subset who were at high risk for early unfavorable outcomes.", 
    "36": "The effect of sulindac on renal function and blood pressure was compared with those of placebo, piroxicam, and naproxen in 20 patients with primary hypertension being treated with a diuretic and a beta-blocker. Although the three non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) did not differ in their effect on renal function (weight, glomerular filtration rate, creatinine clearance) or on serum thromboxane and plasma 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto PGF1 alpha), blood pressure was significantly lower with sulindac than with placebo, piroxicam, or naproxen. These differences were associated with less renal cyclooxygenase inhibition by sulindac (reflected by urinary thromboxane B2 and 6-keto PGF1 alpha) than by other NSAIDs. The findings suggest that the blood pressure differences reflect vasodilation due to differences in the balance between systemic and renal effects of the NSAIDs.", 
    "37": "A case of propranolol overdose complicated by esophageal spasm preventing extrication of an orogastric lavage tube and relieved by intravenous glucagon is presented. Esophageal spasm is an infrequent complication of beta-adrenergic over-dose. Possible mechanisms of esophageal spasm and its relief with glucagon are discussed.", 
    "38": "We tested a once-a-day antihypertensive regimen using minoxidil, nadolol, and a diuretic in 55 patients with resistant hypertension. Forty-seven patients had evidence of end-organ damage. Twelve had mild renal insufficiency (serum creatinine concentration, 2.5 +/- 0.3 mg/dL). In 34 patients, treatment with nadolol and a diuretic was started with minoxidil added one to four weeks later. In the remainder, minoxidil, nadolol, and a diuretic were begun simultaneously because of severe hypertension. Initial supine and standing blood pressure (BP) in the 55 patients were 186 +/- 4/111 +/- 2 and 180 +/- 4/108 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively. After 7 +/- 1 weeks, BP was controlled in 46 patients (84%) with the supine and standing BP reduced to 140 +/- 3/80 +/- 1 and 134 +/- 3/80 +/- 1, respectively. In six patients, BP was controlled but intolerable side effects occurred, making the regimen therapeutically successful in 40 patients (73%). The BP remained controlled during a follow-up of 43 +/- 5 weeks. In 31 patients, BPs measured 24 hours after the last dose were not different from random measurements. Mean serum creatinine levels remained stable in the 12 patients with renal insufficiency.", 
    "39": "Neurotensin (NT) infusions into isolated, electrically-driven hearts of guinea pigs, elicited concentration-dependent reductions of myocardial perfusion pressure accompanied by proportional increases of myocardial tension. The decrease of myocardial perfusion pressure caused by NT (attributed to the coronary vasodilator effect of NT) was highly dependent on basal (pre-NT infusions) levels of perfusion pressure, being larger at high perfusion pressure (e.g., 75 mmHg) values than at lower ones (e.g., 50 and 25 mmHg). The perfusion pressure-lowering effect on NT was potentiated and inhibited by neostigmine and atropine, respectively. It was slightly inhibited by methysergide. However, it was not affected by propranolol, indomethacin or a mixture of diphenhydramine and cimetidine. The decreases of myocardial perfusion pressure caused by NT were abolished by NT receptor desensitization, while those evoked by acetylcholine or vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) were minimally affected by the desensitization. These results indicate that NT exerts a vasodilator effect in guinea pig coronary vessels. This effect is likely to involve the participation of acetylcholine released from NT-stimulated cardiac cholinergic (vagal) neurons and/or nerve terminals and to be mediated by specific NT receptors. The possible contribution of intracardiac serotonin and/or its receptors to the coronary vasodilator effect of NT is discussed.", 
    "40": "Sotalol is not only a beta blocker but a class III antiarrhythmic drug. Its possible antifibrillatory activity was therefore investigated in both the ventricles and atria of dog heart in situ, since vulnerability to fibrillation is not the same in both these parts of the myocardium. Fibrillation threshold was measured concurrently with the duration and amplitude of monophasic action potential, the effective refractory period, the conduction time in the contractile fibres, and after fibrillation had been triggered the fibrillation rate. Variables were measured at 5 and 10 min after sotalol had been given intravenously in closed chest dogs in three doses (1, 1, and 2 mg X kg-1) at 15 min interval. Sotalol produced a rise in fibrillation threshold that occurred simultaneously with a prolongation in monophasic action potential duration and effective refractory period of the contractile fibres and a slowing in fibrillation rate, whereas conduction time was not affected. The changes appeared, however, to be less pronounced in the ventricles than in the atria, in which vulnerability to fibrillation, normally increased by vagal tone, had been previously enhanced by acetylcholine. Sotalol antagonised the changes due to acetylcholine. In both the atria and the ventricles the first dose (1 mg X kg-1), which produced plasma concentrations of approximately 2 micrograms X ml-1 10 min after injection, produced a submaximal effect. Nevertheless, subsequent administrations increased the beneficial effects but not in proportion to the dose and plasma concentrations.", 
    "41": "Equal reductions in heart rate (44 beats X min-1) were obtained in cats by treatment with either the beta blocking agent timolol or alinidine, an agent claimed to cause bradycardia without interfering with beta adrenoceptor function. Infarct size was measured by staining with triphenyltetrazolium-chloride after 5 h of coronary occlusion and related to the area of hypoperfused myocardium as measured by autoradiography. Regional myocardial blood flow was measured by 15 micron radiolabelled microspheres. Compared with the control cats, in whom 87.4 (SEM 2.2)% of hypoperfused myocardium developed into necrosis, timolol reduced infarct size to 65.8 (SEM 2.6)% (p less than 0.001) and alinidine to 76.2 (SEM 3.1)% (p less than 0.01) of the hypoperfused area. Timolol reduced infarct size more than did alinidine (p less than 0.01). Necrosis was more extensive in the endocardium than in the epicardium in all groups. In the subendocardium timolol and alinidine reduced infarct size to the same extent, whereas timolol reduced infarct size more than alinidine in the subepicardium. Although heart rate proved to be the dominant haemodynamic predictor of infarct size, this study indicates that mechanisms other than reduced oxygen demand associated with bradycardia and cardiodepression are operating in the ischaemic myocardium during beta adrenergic blockade.", 
    "42": "A combination of biochemical, physiological and electropharmacological methods was employed to examine the occurrence of neuropeptide Y and the pre- and postjunctional effects of this peptide on sympathetic neuromuscular transmission in the mouse vas deferens. This tissue had a high content of neuropeptide Y-like immunoreactive material, suggesting a dense innervation by neuropeptide Y-containing nerve fibres. Addition of neuropeptide Y at concentrations from 5 X 10(-9) to 5 X 10(-7) M induced both pre- and postjunctional effects in vitro. Neuropeptide Y per se induced a rise in the resting tension, and \"instantly\" potentiated the contractile effects of exogenous noradrenaline and of the stable adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) analogue, alpha,beta-methylene ATP. Neuropeptide Y reduced the secretion of [3H]noradrenaline evoked by electrical nerve stimulation, and selectively depressed the stimulus-evoked, but not the spontaneously occurring excitatory junction potentials in smooth muscle cells. Further, neuropeptide Y reduced the amplitudes of the twitch contractions evoked by electrical field stimulation with short stimulus trains at 10 Hz, and also (although to a smaller extent) the delayed contractile response to longer trains of nerve stimuli. The pre- and postjunctional effects of neuropeptide Y were not changed by alpha- or beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents, or by tachyphylaxis to the effects of ATP, or by the calcium channel blocker nifedipine.",

    "44": "Capsaicin was injected intracisternally (i.c.), intrathecally (i.th.) or intravenously (i.v.) into guinea-pigs anaesthetized with urethane and ventilated artificially. The effects of 0.2-100 micrograms capsaicin on insufflation pressure, heart rate, arterial blood pressure and salivation were recorded. Low i.c. doses of 0.2 and 2 micrograms capsaicin induced bradycardia, hypertension and salivation but no change in insufflation pressure. An insufflation pressure increase, i.e. bronchoconstriction, was observed with 20 or 100 micrograms capsaicin i.c. and this was associated with tachycardia and hypertension. Bronchoconstriction after 20 micrograms capsaicin i.c. was augmented by propranolol (1 mg/kg i.v.). It was, however, unaffected by bilateral cervical vagotomy and could also be induced by i.th. capsaicin injections in the lumbar region. Capsaicin (3 micrograms/kg) injected i.v. induced bronchoconstriction and tachycardia. Propranolol enhanced bronchoconstriction but did not reduce the tachycardia indicating that capsaicin led to activation of sympathetic bronchial but not cardiac fibers. These results also indicate that i.c. capsaicin caused reflex responses consisting of salivation, bronchodilatation bradycardia and hypertension. High doses injected i.c. or i.th. also caused tachycardia and bronchoconstriction. This latter effect, however, was neither a vagal reflex nor did it seem to result from activation of central terminals of afferent fibers with subsequent release of mediators from the peripheral endings due to antidromic spread of nerve impulses. Instead, capsaicin seemed to be readily resorbed into the systemic circulation and thus acting at peripheral endings to cause bronchoconstriction and tachycardia.", 
    "45": "In this paper we propose a non-linear model for explaining the relation between doses, blood levels and pharmacodynamic effects. Several models are examined and a functional relation (without derivatives or integrals) is retained. From there the medical system is optimized by using optimal control methods. In practice, optimal doses and times are numerically determined for the drug tertatolol.", 
    "46": "Minoxidil was given to 16 men with hypertension of various degrees of severity, in conjunction with a diuretic and atenolol. Mean supine and standing blood pressures (BP) on diuretic + atenolol were 172/106 and 162/104 mm Hg, respectively. Minoxidil was added and the dose titrated to lower the diastolic pressure to less than 90 mm Hg. All drugs were taken together once daily. At the end of a maintenance period of 6 months on an average dose of minoxidil of 12 mg (range 2.5 to 20.0 mg), supine BP was 147/87 and standing BP 139/88 mm Hg. Similar BP had been measured throughout the maintenance period, and monitoring of the BP showed that the once daily regimen provided good control for 24 h. A strong correlation was found between the dose of minoxidil necessary to normalize the BP and the mean arterial pressure prior to minoxidil (r = 0.73, P less than 0.005). Serious adverse effects of the drug were observed only in patients receiving doses greater than 10 mg or those with widespread atherosclerosis, or both. We conclude that, when added to a diuretic and a beta-blocker in a once-a-day regimen, minoxidil in a daily dose of less than or equal to 10 mg is effective and well tolerated in mild to moderate hypertension, especially in patients who are free of atherosclerotic complications.", 
    "47": "Experimental hyperthyroidism was induced in rats by daily intraperitoneal injections of triiodothyronine (T3; 100 micrograms/100 g bw) for 3 days (short-term experiment) or by subcutaneous injections of T3 (30 micrograms/100 g bw) on alternate days during 6 weeks (long-term experiment). Control rats received corresponding volumes of solvent. Groups of rats were fed normal pellets or pellets enriched with the selective beta-1-blocker metoprolol (8.8 mmol/kg of diet) or with the non-selective beta-blocker propranolol (3.3 mmol/kg of diet). Plasma amino acids were determined 24 hours after the last T3 injection. In the short-term experiment, most individual amino acids were increased in T3-treated rats, also if beta-blocker had been given, but the increase in plasma concentration of some amino acids (valine, leucine, lysine and histidine) was prevented by propranolol. In the long-term experiment, several amino acids showed reduced plasma concentration during T3 treatment, also when the rats received beta-blocker. The plasma concentration of threonine, however, was normalized by propranolol during T3 treatment. The results indicate that metabolic alterations induced by T3 and producing changes in plasma amino acid concentrations are mainly unaffected by beta-blockade. However, as some plasma amino acid changes were prevented by propranolol but not by metoprolol, certain T3-induced metabolic derangements may be beta-2-receptor mediated.", 
    "48": "In vivo effects of varying concentrations of propranolol on the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve, and its in vitro effects on erythrocyte energy metabolism were studied in 12 elderly and old coronary patients. An 80 mg oral dose of propranolol evoked a significant shift to the right in the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve due to a decrease in blood pH (Bohr's effect) and, according to in vitro evidence, the release of membrane-bound ATP and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. As a result, propranolol improved blood oxygen release in tissue capillaries, as evidenced by elevated pO2 in subcutaneous fat.", 
    "49": "In this comparative bioavailability study in 12 healthy volunteers the blood level profiles and urinary recoveries of both atenolol and chlorthalidone were studied following the administration of the drugs as a fixed combination ('Tenoret 50'), as a free combination, and individually, at doses of 50 mg atenolol and 12.5 mg chlorthalidone. There were no statistically or clinically significant differences between the three treatments of atenolol in terms of individual blood levels, areas under the curve, and urinary excretion. The mean half-lives were between 5 and 7 h, in agreement with other published data. The variation in peak systemic levels is less than that observed for a number of other beta-blocking drugs and is of the same order as seen in other investigations involving atenolol. Thus the bioavailability of atenolol from the fixed combination is equivalent to that from the free combination and from the atenolol tablet. The mean peak blood concentrations of chlorthalidone were 0.94, 1.00, and 0.99 micrograms ml-1 for the fixed and free combinations and the chlorthalidone tablet, respectively. The mean areas under the curve were also similar as were the mean half-lives and urinary recovery. There were no statistically or clinically significant differences between the three treatments. Thus the bioavailability of chlorthalidone from the fixed combination is equivalent to that from the free combination and from the chlorthalidone tablet. It is concluded that combining chlorthalidone and atenolol in a single tablet does not affect the systemic bioavailability of either component.", 
    "50": "Short-term treatment with 1-(p-carbamoyl-methylphenoxy)-3-isopropylamino)-2-propanol (atenolol, Tenormin) (100 mg/d for 5 days) was conducted in 12 patients with labile essential hypertension. Before and at the end of the treatment, cardiohemodynamics, renal hemodynamic and excretory function, and renal pressor (renin-angiotensin-aldosterone) and depressor (renal kallikrein-kinin and prostaglandin) systems were examined. Atenolol decreased cardiac output (CO) without affecting total peripheral resistance. Atenolol also decreased plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone concentration, urinary excretion of kallikrein-kinin, and urinary excretion of potassium whereas it increased plasma potassium concentration. Urinary excretion of prostaglandin E and sodium was not affected by atenolol. Glomerular filtration rate decreased, but renal plasma flow remained unchanged during the treatment by atenolol. A significant positive correlation was found between the changes in CO and in systolic blood pressure (SBP) while negative correlation was observed between the changes in total peripheral resistance and in SBP. A significant positive correlation was also noted between urinary kallikrein excretion and renal plasma flow. The change in urinary kinin excretion was conversely correlated to that in SBP. This study demonstrates that the hypotensive mechanism of atenolol is very complex. Decrease in CO and inhibition of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may mainly be responsible for hypotension. It is likely that potassium retaining action of atenolol partly contributes to its hypotensive action. It is also hypothetized that renal kallikrein-kinin system may play a role in modulating the hypotensive action of atenolol.", 
    "51": "Increases in the water pressure (PW) around the trunk of the sea raven (Hemitripterus americanus Gmelin) were used to evaluate the effects of vascular compression on cardiovascular variables. Cardiac output (Vb), heart rate (fH) and blood pressures in the ventral aorta, dorsal aorta and ductus Cuvier (Pva, Pda and Pdc, respectively) were measured. A 20 cm H2O increase in PW decreased vascular conductance by up to 25%. During vascular compression, a reflex bradycardia reduced Vb and attenuated the accompanying rise in arterial blood pressure. Pretreatment of the fish with the sympathetic antagonist, propranolol, further attenuated the hypertension by accentuating the reflex bradycardia. Subsequent pretreatment with papaverine, a vascular smooth muscle poison, potentiated these effects and did not reveal any autoregulatory vasodilation in the periphery. Atropine pretreatment completely abolished the reflex bradycardia, indicating that the bradycardia resulted from increased vagal cholinergic tone. The fish also exhibited cardiovascular compensation during the 2 min vascular compression. An accommodation of the barostatic reflex (reduced vagal tone) and a sympathetic tachycardia raised Vb and passively increased vascular conductance. The set point for the barostatic bradycardia was apparently temperature-sensitive.", 
    "52": "Rainbow trout were subjected to burst swimming to exhaustion followed by 4 h aerobic swimming at 80% critical swimming velocity. Severe physiological disturbances, including a marked plasma acidosis caused by the burst swim, were corrected during the 4 h of subsequent aerobic exercise. Erythrocytic pH and arterial oxygen content increased, even though plasma pH was reduced. We suggest that the increase in erythrocytic pH was caused by the action of elevated adrenaline and noradrenaline levels in the blood acting on beta-adrenergic receptors on the trout red blood cell, causing the cell to swell and raising intracellular pH, offsetting any effect of a reduction of plasma pH on erythrocyte pH and haemoglobin-oxygen binding. Propranolol blocked the action of catecholamines on trout erythrocytes. We conclude that catecholamines play an important role in maintaining oxygen transport to aerobic muscles, following burst swimming and the associated acidotic conditions.", 
    "53": "It has been postulated that propranolol lowers the intraocular pressure by adrenergic neurone block. However, in the isolated iris of albino rabbits, there was only a small degree of cocaine-sensitive (i.e., neuronal) accumulation of 3H-(-)-propranolol, and none at all after pretreatment of the animals with reserpine. Moreover, after preloading of the iris with 3H-(-)-propranolol, veratridine failed to release any labelled material. Hence, any adrenergic neurone blocking action of propranolol is highly unlikely. Albino and pigmented irides were first exposed to 3H-(-)-propranolol and then washed out. The results and their compartmental analysis indicated an extensive binding of 3H-(-)-propranolol in or at pigment cells; the binding is characterized by a low dissociation constant. It is very likely that the initial binding and the subsequent slow dissociation from pigment cells explains the long duration of action of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in human therapy.",

The comparison of efficacy of DAEA, obzidan and atenolol showed that atenolol exhibited only a low antiarrhythmic activity, DAEA prevented the development of arrhythmia in 50% of animals in a dose of 1.7 mg/kg (1/42 of LD50) and obzidan--1 mg/kg (1/40 of LD50), respectively.

    "56": "Malignant ventricular arrhythmias appearing during acute myocardial ischaemia, are the most frequent mechanism of sudden death. ST-T alternans is the result of an intraischaemic conduction delay and is frequently associated with those potentially lethal arrhythmias. In fact, such a phenomenon was seen in 35% of 46/86 patients with Prinzmetal's variant angina who showed ventricular arrhythmias during ischaemia, while it was never observed in the remaining 40 patients without arrhythmias during ischaemia. Therefore ST-segment alternans should be considered a reliable marker of the possible occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias during myocardial ischaemia. ST-T-segment alternans is associated with R alternans, as clearly demonstrated by thoracic maps, and this phenomenon is due to a 2:1 intraischaemic block. The patients with Prinzmetal's variant angina who present ventricular arrhythmias during ischaemia, show a more prominent increase of the positive area of the QRS (411.75 +/- 102.5 vs 294.05 +/- 80.3 mu volts ms), that is, a more relevant intraischaemic conduction delay. The effects of different pretreatments (lidocaine, propranolol and diltiazem) on arrhythmias related to vasospastic myocardial ischaemia induced by ergonovine maleate, were evaluated in four patients with Prinzmetal's variant angina. As in experimental observations, neither a 'pure' antiarrhythmic agent like lidocaine, nor a betablocking agent like propranolol, prevented acute ischaemic ventricular arrhythmias. Only the calcium antagonist, diltiazem, seemed to prevent such arrhythmias. However, these findings necessitate further confirmation.",

Since plasmacholinesterase is responsible for the hydrolysis of succinylcholine and that of the ester-type local anaesthetics this lack of in vivo interaction of esmolol with the hydrolysis of these drugs should be further confirmed by experiments with these combinations in man.", 
    "59": "The pharmacokinetics of intravenous and oral propranolol have been compared in six obese and six normal subjects matched for age and sex. After intravenous administration there was no difference in plasma clearance but the volume of distribution was greater (V = 339 l vs 198 l) and the half-life was longer (t1/2 = 5.0 h vs 3.0 h) in the obese group. No important difference in the rate of oral absorption was observed. A trend towards higher systemic availability in the obese group (35% vs 27%) was not statistically significant.", 
    "60": "The effect of propranolol on renal haemodynamics was studied in nine patients with arterial hypertension and moderate to severe chronic renal failure. A reduction of the renal function in this type of patient might have clinical consequence. The patients, whose glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ranged between 17 ml/min/1.73 m2 and 71 ml/min/1.73 m2, were studied during three 4-week periods with alternately placebo, propranolol (40 mg b.i.d.) and placebo treatment. The GFR and the effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) were determined as the plasma clearance of 51Cr-EDTA and 125I-hippurane. The GFR fell on the average 7% (95% confidence limits: 1-12%) during propranolol treatment, and the fall was reversible. No changes were found in ERPF. In conclusion, propranolol treatment in this type of patient causes a modest and reversible fall of GFR.", 
    "61": "In an attempt to investigate the changes in left ventricular haemodynamics following uncomplicated myocardial infarction 95 patients with definite electrocardiographic signs of infarction, without clinical signs of cardiac failure, were monitored with a Swan Ganz catheter for the first 24 hours after admission to hospital. The median delay from onset of symptoms was 6.8 hours. Mean heart rate increased (83-86 beats/min; P less than 0.05) while stroke volume index fell (38.4-36.6 ml/m2; P less than 0.05); cardiac index therefore remained unchanged during the observation period. As a result of a fall in arterial pressure both systemic vascular resistance and left ventricular stroke work index fell significantly (P less than 0.01). Pulmonary wedge pressure also fell (13.6-10.5 mm Hg; P less than 0.001), but this fall was confined to patients whose initial reading was above the median of 13 mm Hg. Pulmonary wedge pressure fell both among the 41 patients who required some medical therapy (15.6-10.8 mm Hg; P less than 0.001) and the 54 who received no medication throughout the 24 hours (12.0-9.8 mm Hg; P less than 0.05). The 39 patients with anterior wall infarction had higher baseline pulmonary wedge pressure and systemic vascular resistance than the 42 with inferior wall infarction. Later the stroke volume and stroke work index were persistently lower reflecting the greater degree of impairment of left ventricular function in anterior wall infarction. In conclusion, following an uncomplicated myocardial infarction, cardiac index was maintained, despite a fall in stroke volume, by an increase in heart rate. Pulmonary wedge pressure showed both a spontaneous fall and a fall in those patients given additional medical therapy during the study period.", 
    "62": "The diagnosis and management of disorders of thyroid function in the elderly present particular problems. The diagnosis may be missed because of the insidious onset of the disorder and the tendency to attribute many of the complications of hypo- or hyperthyroidism to other causes. Hyperthyroidism presenting as 'apathetic thyrotoxicosis' is seen much more commonly in elderly subjects than in the young, and unless the clinician is familiar with the clinical presentation, the diagnosis may not be considered. Both disease and concomitantly administered drugs may alter thyroid function tests, and abnormal tests do not necessarily mean hyper-or hypothyroidism. Euthyroid hyperthyroxinaemia is often difficult to distinguish from hyperthyroidism. Hyperthyroidism is usually controlled initially by antithyroid drugs, such as carbimazole, which interfere with the synthesis of thyroid hormone. The patient may start to feel better in 1 to 2 weeks and show objective signs of improvement in 3 to 6 weeks. Propranolol may provide earlier symptomatic relief, but must be used cautiously in older people due to its potential adverse effect on cardiac function. Thyroxine should be introduced slowly in those with hypothyroidism; the initial dose is 0.025 to 0.05 mg daily. Because of the long half-life of thyroxine, the dose is increased every 4 to 6 weeks until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the thyroid stimulating hormone level returns to normal. In elderly people the early treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism is justified.", 
    "63": "We studied 12 patients with crisis of paroxysmal reciprocating supraventricular tachycardia before and after intravenous injection of 5 mg of atenolol. The patients were then followed for periods ranging from 6 to 50 months (median 34 months). During this time, they received oral atenolol therapy, at 200 mg for the first two weeks, and 100 mg daily thereafter. Tachycardia was due to reciprocation within the atrioventricular node in 9 patients, and to pre-excitation in 3 patients. Atenolol slowed the sinus rate, prolonged the atrioventricular conduction time, and increased the atrial cycle length at which atrioventricular nodal Wenckebach phenomenon occurred. During the tachycardia, atenolol increased the tachycardia During the tachycardia, atenolol increased the tachycardia cycle length, due to prolongation of the intranodal atrioventricular conduction time. Of the 11 patients who were observed for the full period, 7 had no further episodes of arrhythmia. One patient (with left-sided pre-excitation) failed to respond to any antiarrhythmic medication, one patient remained free of symptoms for two years, but received an atrial pacemaker for control of the tachycardia at the end of this period. Two patients (one with dual atrioventricular nodal pathways, and one with concealed left-sided pre-excitation) await other treatment for their tachycardia, after remaining free of symptoms for one and two years, respectively. These findings suggest that atenolol is an effective beta blocker for use in controlling arrhythmias in patients with reciprocating supraventricular tachycardia, for use in once daily dosage, and is a medication largely free of side effects.", 
    "64": "We used ultrasonic segment length gauges to examine the regional behavior of midwall fibers at different sites around the left ventricular minor axis in 12 anesthetized dogs. In six dogs (group I) with circumferentially oriented midwall gauges, significantly greater shortening of anterior than lateral or posterior wall segments was demonstrated over a range of left ventricular end-diastolic pressures from 2 to 18 mm Hg. Normalized end-diastolic segment lengths increased more in the anterior wall as end-diastolic pressure increased, suggesting that regional differences in diastolic distensibility may in part account for the observed shortening differences. To examine the extent to which shortening of longitudinally oriented fibers of the subendocardium and subepicardium might influence the behavior of the midwall circumferential fibers, we implanted mutually perpendicular midwall gauges circumferentially and longitudinally in the anterior and posterior walls in six dogs (group II). Longitudinal shortening of midwall fibers was negligible at low end-diastolic pressures, but increased significantly at higher end-diastolic pressures. In the anterior wall, there was greater circumferential than longitudinal shortening, whereas, in the posterior wall, shortening was similar in the two directions. Finally, we calculated the midwall area subtended by the mutually perpendicular gauges and found the systolic change in midwall area to be similar for the anterior and posterior walls at all end-diastolic pressures. We conclude that midwall fibers demonstrate considerable nonuniformity of contraction at different sites around the minor axis. This finding may be related in part to regional differences in diastolic distensibility or in functional interactions between fiber layers. Despite these complex regional, directional, and volume dependent differences in midwall segment function, the systolic changes in midwall area did not vary regionally. Thus, different midwall sites around the minor axis circumference appear to have similar overall contributions to the ejection of blood.", 
    "65": "Sotalol is a nonselective beta-receptor antagonist that prolongs action potential duration and refractoriness in vitro at higher concentrations than those associated with heart rate slowing. To determine if this additional action can be expressed in humans, 17 patients with chronic stable ventricular premature complexes were studied. Each patient was hospitalized and arrhythmia frequency was quantified during a 48-hour drug-free baseline and during every third day of therapy with increasing incremental sotalol dosages. The dosages were 160, 320, 640 and 960 mg/day, administered in 1 or 2 doses. An index of action potential duration, the rate-corrected QT (QTc), was measured using serial 12-lead electrocardiograms on the third day of each dosage at presumed steady state and the degree of beta-receptor blockade was assessed by the reduction of the maximal exercise-induced heart rate. Of the 17 patients, 11 had an antiarrhythmic response (70 to 100% reduction in VPCs), at a wide range of plasma concentrations (340 to 3,440 ng/ml). The responders to sotalol included 8 patients in whom therapy with conventional beta-receptor antagonists had failed. In the group as a whole, the concentration associated with significant QTc prolongation (2,550 ng/ml) was greater than that associated with 50% reduction of the maximal slowing in heart rate (804 ng/ml). Sotalol was generally well tolerated, but in 1 nonresponder torsades de pointes developed 3 hours after the first 640-mg dose at a plasma sotalol concentration well within the concentration range measured in other patients. Sotalol's repolarization-prolonging actions are seen at higher concentrations than those associated with heart rate slowing and may contribute to its clinical effects.", 
    "66": "Repeat exercise thallium-201 scintigrams were performed 2 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months in 27 patients following their first myocardial infarction. All patients were treated with timolol or matching placebo, administered intravenously starting within 5 hours of onset of chest pain. The extent of transient perfusion defects in 15 timolol-treated patients increased significantly between 2 weeks and 3 months compared to a decrease in 12 placebo-treated patients (p less than 0.05). Between 3 and 6 months the extent of transient defects did not change in the two groups, and there was no difference between the groups. The extent of permanent defects was not significantly different between the timolol- and placebo-treated patients on any occasion. However, patients in the timolol group had a decrease in permanent defects with time in contrast to patients in the placebo group (p less than 0.05). Thus, early intervention with timolol in the acute phase of myocardial infarction may have consequences for the postinfarction phase, as reflected in repeat thallium-201 scintigrams.", 
    "67": "Chronic headache pain has many causes but is generally attributed to one of three mechanisms: muscular contraction, vascular inflammation, or traction or inflammation of pain-sensitive structures. Because of the wide variety of headache types and the often-confusing terminology and classification systems in use, evaluation of headache can be difficult. A step-by-step approach to patient workup, including patient history, physical examination, and appropriate tests, can help the physician pinpoint the underlying problem and determine appropriate therapy. Long-term drug therapy is effective for most patients with vascular headaches. For headaches of psychogenic origin, therapy includes psychotropic drugs, biofeedback training, counseling, and behavior modification. More research in the area of mind-body interactions will lead to improved management of chronic headache of nonorganic origin.", 
    "68": "The effect of superior cervical ganglionectomy (SCGx) on the pituitary-thyroid axis was examined in rats. SCGx decreased serum thyrotropin (TSH) and thyroxine (T4) levels for up to 4 days after surgery, during and immediately after completion of anterograde degeneration of regional sympathetic terminals. At later times TSH levels in control and SCGx rats did not differ, but a significant increase of serum T4 was found two weeks after SCGx. A diurnal rhythm in serum TSH and T4 levels with maxima at 11.00 h (TSH) and at 14.00 and 22.00 h (T4) was found in sham-operated rats 3 days after surgery. At this time SCGx evoked a general depression of TSH levels as well as a shift of 3 h in their maximum. A similar shift of the afternoon peak and abolition of the nocturnal peak in serum T4 were detectable in SCGx rats. In SCGx animals examined during anterograde nerve degeneration, i.e. 14 h after surgery, injection of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocker phenoxybenzamine negated denervation-induced changes of TSH and counteracted partially T4 effects. The beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol did not modify serum TSH levels in SCGx rats but further decreased serum T4 concentration. Treatment with both drugs simultaneously did no affect TSH release compared to SCGx, phenoxybenzamine-treated rats but effectively decreased serum T4. These results further support the involvement of superior cervical ganglion neurons in the control of thyroid function.", 
    "69": "The hypotensive efficacy of labetalol was evaluated in 29 patients with essential hypertension in a single-blind dose ranging study. After a two-week period of placebo treatment, labetalol was given in oral doses of 0.6 g/d, 0.8 g/d, and 0.8 g/d combined with 25-50 mg/d of hydrochlorothiazide. Each regimen lasted four weeks. The decrease in blood pressure was dose dependent: 90% of patients showed a significant reduction in diastolic blood pressure and 75% showed a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure. In 69% of the patients, side effects of the drug were noted, and in five patients (17%), treatment was discontinued because of the side effects. Seven patients received labetalol intravenously before the oral treatment. Their heart rate and blood pressure reductions were similar to those found in patients only taking the medication orally. We conclude that labetalol is an efficient and safe antihypertensive agent in both oral and intravenous administration. However, the high incidence of side effects makes labetalol a drug of second choice in uncomplicated hypertensive patients.", 
    "70": "Vasodilator substances act either directly on vascular smooth muscle (e.g., adenosine) or indirectly (e.g., acetylcholine) on endothelial cells that respond by releasing an unknown powerful, short-lived relaxing factor. To determine whether chronic hypertension or hypercholesterolemia or both would alter the release of the endothelium-derived relaxing factor, experiments were performed in hypertensive rabbits (5-week cellophane wrap perinephritis; mean blood pressure, 134.7 mm Hg) and normotensive rabbits (mean blood pressure, 80 mm Hg) with a Doppler flow transducer and perivascular balloon implanted on the lower abdominal aorta. Rabbits were fed either 1% cholesterol or control diet for 4 weeks before the experiment. On the day of the experiment, resting hindlimb vascular resistance was greatest in hypertensive rabbits fed 1% cholesterol diet, followed (in descending order) by hypertensive rabbits, normotensive rabbits fed 1% cholesterol diet, and normotensive rabbits. Pharmacological autonomic reflex blockade was induced, and steady state intravenous infusion curves to acetylcholine, serotonin, and adenosine were constructed. Sensitivity (location of effective dose, 50%) to the three vasodilator agents was altered less than twofold from the values in normotensive rabbits for any treatment group. The maximum vasodilator response to acetylcholine, but not to adenosine or serotonin, infusion was reduced significantly in the treated rabbits compared with that in normal rabbits. Reactive hyperemic responses to 5 to 80 seconds of ischemia were not significantly different among the treatment groups. These results indicate that hypertension with or without hypercholesterolemia does not greatly alter the responsiveness of the hindlimb resistance vasculature to these three vasodilator agents or to ischemia.", 
    "71": "The tolerance and beta-adrenergic blocking activity of flestolol, a short-acting beta-blocker, was investigated in 30 subjects. Flestolol infused intravenously at doses up to 100 micrograms/kg/min was found to be well tolerated. A dose-dependent attenuation of isoproterenol-induced tachycardia and increase in systolic blood pressure occurred with flestolol at doses ranging from 0.5 to 15.0 micrograms/kg/min. The average percent reduction in isoproterenol-induced tachycardia (beta-blockade) at each dose of flestolol, 0.5, 2.5, 5.0, 15.0, and 50.0 micrograms/kg/min, was 15.1%, 45.9%, 67.0%, 85.9%, and 90.3%, respectively. The onset of beta-blockade occurred within 30 minutes. After the end of flestolol infusion there was a marked reduction in beta-blockade within 6 minutes, with complete recovery from beta-blockade within 30 to 45 minutes. There was a statistically significant (P less than 0.01) positive correlation between flestolol dosage and its blood levels (r = 0.91) as well as between the flestolol-induced beta-blockade and its dosage (r = 0.62).", 
    "72": "Dimension change measures of regional ventricular function, such as absolute or percent wall thickening (delta T or % delta T) or segmental shortening (delta L or % delta L), are highly load dependent. In 16 anesthetized mongrel dogs we assessed use of the end-systolic pressure-thickness and end-systolic pressure-length relationships (ESPTR, ESPLR) as more load-independent measures of regional function. We found that the ESPTR and ESPLR could be measured without detectable baroreceptor-mediated reflex changes in cardiac contractile state. Systemic administration of dobutamine shifted the ESPTR to the right and the ESPLR to the left of control, mainly due to a change in the slope (Ees) of the relationships. Both delta T, % delta T and delta L, % delta L failed to detect the positive inotropic effect of dobutamine because of an associated reduction in preload. With systemic administration of propranolol, ESPTR, ESPLR, delta T, % delta T, and delta L, % delta L detected the negative inotropic effect. Thus systemic propranolol shifted the ESPTR to the left and the ESPLR to the right of control, mainly due to a change in Ees. Regional administration of dobutamine shifted the ESPTR and the ESPLR in the direction of positive contractility in the region receiving the drug, whereas simple dimension change measures of regional function failed to detect the inotropic effect because preload fell and the timing of regional end-systole was altered. With regional propranolol both the ESPTR, ESPLR and simple dimension change measures detected the negative inotropic effect. Thus the ESPTR, ESPLR is a reliable measure of regional ventricular function and may be better than simple dimension change measures of regional function, particularly when loading conditions or the timing of regional systole is altered by an intervention.", 
    "73": "Junctional ectopic tachycardia has been described in infants but not in adults. Five adults with rapid symptomatic paroxysmal junctional tachycardia, distinct from the more common slower nonparoxysmal junctional tachycardia, were recently evaluated. The tachycardia was irregular (rate 120 to 250) and accompanied by periods of atrioventricular dissociation and narrow QRS complexes. A junctional origin was documented during electrophysiologic study in four of the five patients. Analysis of Holter recordings; the response to exercise, isoproterenol, and propranolol; and the effects of atrial and ventricular stimulation appeared to implicate abnormal automaticity of a high junctional focus that was catecholamine sensitive or dependent as the tachycardia mechanism. All patients responded somewhat to beta-blockers, although a combination of procainamide and propranolol proved to be the most effective therapy in one patient and another chose electrode catheter ablation of the atrioventricular junction rather than continued drug therapy. Thus, junctional ectopic tachycardia may occur in adults and its mechanism appears to be related to abnormal automaticity that is catecholamine sensitive or dependent. Initial therapy should include beta-blockers but selected patients may require more aggressive management.", 
    "74": "The effect of propranolol and labetalol on cold stress and isometric exercise induced rise of blood pressure was studied in 7 patients with essential hypertension and 14 normal volunteers in a controlled, double blind, randomized, cross-over trial design. The subjects received either propranolol (40 mg) or labetalol (100 mg) orally after breakfast. In patients of mild to moderate essential hypertension, labetalol reduced significantly both systolic as well as diastolic rise of blood pressure induced by both types of exercises. Propranolol only reduced the rise of systolic blood pressure significantly. In normotensive subjects, labetalol reduced significantly the rise in systolic as well as diastolic blood pressure induced by cold stress, but not by the isometric exercise, while propranolol only reduced significantly the rise in systolic blood pressure induced by both the tests. The rise in heart rate was more with isometric exercise than with cold stress both in hypertensive patients and control subjects. The heart rate rise was significantly reduced by propranolol in all the experiments except for the rise induced by cold stress in hypertensive patients. The changes in heart rate produced by labetalol were not significant.", 
    "75": "The prophylactic effects of the antiprostaglandin agent mefenamic acid on migraine attacks were compared with propranolol or placebo in a double-blind crossover study of 29 patients. In the 17 patients who completed the trial the frequency of attacks and their total duration were significantly reduced during mefenamic acid therapy or propranolol therapy as compared to placebo. There were no significant effects of mefenamic acid or propranolol on average duration or severity of migraine attacks. The study suggests that mefenamic acid and propranolol are equally effective for migraine prophylaxis.", 
    "76": "Sotalol and propranolol were administered both intravenously and orally in conventional equipotent beta-blocking doses to 8 patients with permanent programmable ventricular pacemakers to study their effects on ventricular repolarization. Sotalol prolonged the QT interval by 6.5% (430 to 455 ms) after intravenous administration (p less than 0.01) and by up to 11.5% (430 to 483 ms) after 4 weeks of oral treatment (p less than 0.001). This was entirely due to prolongation of the JT interval, since there was no effect on QRS duration. The magnitude of QT and JT prolongation related to the serum level but the correlation was not statistically significant. QT prolongation was exaggerated after chronic treatment despite lower serum levels of sotalol (2.0 micrograms/ml) compared with levels after acute administration (3.5 micrograms/ml). After propranolol was given, there was no consistent change in QT or JT intervals, and although there was a tendency to slight prolongation of QT interval, by 2.5% after chronic oral administration, this was not statistically significant. This suggests that the prolongation of ventricular repolarization by sotalol is not caused by beta-blockade, but by its class III activity, and that chronic treatment increases the effect. There was no significant effect on chronic ventricular pacing threshold after intravenous or oral administration of either drug.", 
    "77": "In 1981, a large, double-blind, randomized, multicenter trial was started in The Netherlands to evaluate the therapeutic effects of nifedipine or metoprolol in patients with unstable angina. This study, called the Holland Interuniversity Nifedipine Trial (HINT), included several hundred patients to establish potential therapeutic effects. From December 1982 until January 1984 the effects of nifedipine on left ventricular (LV) performance in a subgroup of 37 HINT patients were studied using radionuclide techniques. All patients (18 treated with nifedipine, 19 with placebo) underwent radionuclide angiography and 33 underwent thallium-201 scintigraphy just before and 48 hours after the start of treatment with the experimental medication. Radionuclide angiographic studies were also performed 1 hour (29 patients) and 4 hours (31 patients) after the start of treatment. The thallium-201 images showed defects in 24 (73%) of the baseline images and in 21 (64%) of the 48-hour images. No significant differences were seen between patients receiving nifedipine or placebo in the incidence of new defects or in the disappearance of defects at 48 hours. Changes in thallium-201 images were not related to recurrence of myocardial ischemia or the development of acute myocardial infarction. Nineteen of the 37 patients (51%) with baseline blood pool images had a reduced LV ejection fraction (EF) (38 +/- 10%) and 18 patients (49%) had a normal LVEF of 56 +/- 5%. LVEF improved after 48 hours in 8 patients receiving nifedipine and in only 1 patient receiving placebo (p less than 0.02). This effect was not present at 1 and 4 hours after treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
