    "0": "Cytochrome P450 CYP2D6 metabolizes a wide range of pharmaceutical compounds. A CYP2D6 fusion enzyme (CYP2D6F), containing an amino-terminal human CYP2D6 sequence and a carboxyterminal human NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (CPR) moiety, was constructed. High levels of expression were achieved in Escherichia coli (60-100 nmol/liter) and the enzyme was catalytically active with optimal activities achieved in the presence of the antioxidant, GSH. Turnover values for bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation, metoprolol alpha-hydroxylation, O-desmethylation, and dextromethorphan O-demethylation, using membranes expressing the fusion enzyme, were 5.6, 0.4, 0.72, and 6.19 min(-1), respectively. These values were similar to E. coli membranes which coexpressed human CYP2D6 and CPR (CYP2D6/R). The K(m) and k(cat) values for bufuralol metabolism were estimated to be 10.2 microM and 4.1 min(-1), respectively. The enzyme was purified using ion-exchange chromatography, affinity chromatography (2'-5' ADP-Sepharose), and gel filtration. Estimated turnover rates for bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation, metoprolol alpha-hydroxylation, O-desmethylation, and dextromethorphan O-demethylation were 1.2, 0.52, 0.79, and 0.76 min(-1), respectively. Bufuralol 1'-hydroxylase activity by purified CYP2D6F was enhanced by phospholipids and added CPR. The CYP2D6F enzyme was able to stimulate CYP3A4 testosterone 6beta-hydroxylase activity in a reconstitution system indicating that electron transfer may be largely intermolecular. The catalytically self-sufficient CYP2D6F enzyme will facilitate investigations of P450-CPR interactions and the development of new biocatalysts.", 
    "1": "The efficacy of treating dilated cardiomyopathy with metoprolol was compared with that of carvedilol. Metoprolol was administered to 29 patients, and carvedilol to 62. Patients who could not be dosed with up to 40 mg daily of metoprolol or 20 mg daily of carvedilol were defined as intolerant. As well as the tolerability of these beta-blockers, the effects on left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVDd), fractional shortening (FS), plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) concentrations, the delayed heart and mediastinum (H/M) ratio determined from metaiodobenzylguanidine imaging were compared. Drug intolerance occurred in 24% of patients in the metoprolol group and 19% in the carvedilol group. Among the drug-tolerant patients, LVDd, FS and plasma BNP concentration improved in both groups and to the same degree. Only 25% of drug-tolerant patients in the metoprolol group had a delayed H/M ratio below 1.9 compared with 57% in the carvedilol group. Both metoprolol and carvedilol, when tolerated, improve cardiac function and neurohumoral factors to the same degree. However, carvedilol is preferable to metoprolol for patients with a low delayed H/M ratio.",

The E1 group had higher HR than the E2 group (P < 0.05-0.01). The incidence of tachycardia after intubation was higher in the E0 group (63.8%) than in the E1 group (34.7%) and the E2 group (22.6%) (P < 0.01).

    "10": "In the management of chronic heart failure, polypharmacy is common, necessary, and often overlooked. The increasing costs of care, noncompliance, and frequent adverse drug interactions have led to diminishing benefits by simply adding additional drugs to the already complex regimen. This review outlines a rational pharmacotherapeutic protocol based on establishing overall therapeutic goals and confirming treatment targets, tailoring therapy to individual patients by balancing beneficial and adverse drug effects, and paying particular attention to patient education and other nonpharmacologic support.", 
    "11": "Recent clinical trials indicate that approximately two-thirds of patients in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II and III, who comprise almost 90% of patients with heart failure, die suddenly. Patients in NYHA class IV usually die of progressive heart failure. Implantation of implantable cardioverters defibrillators (ICDs) in this population would represent a huge logistic problem and economic expense. Clinical trials have recently demonstrated that beta-blocker therapy with carvedilol, bisoprolol, and toprol XL decrease the sudden death rate by almost 50%, in addition to impacting significantly on death due to worsening heart failure. This medical approach is beneficial to all patients, and should be our major therapy. However, it is reasonable to attempt to identify that subpopulations of heart failure patients who could benefit from an ICD.", 
    "12": "Chronic heart failure is a complex syndrome involving the activation of multiple cellular, metabolic and neurohumoral pathways following the initial myocardial insult. Because of the complexity of the disease, strategies targeting these multiple systems involved in disease progression are required to maximise the therapeutic benefits of intervention. To this end, there are a number of approaches currently under active evaluation. These include the inhibition of additional neurohormonal vasoconstrictor systems (e.g. endothelin and vasopressin systems), cytokine antagonists (e.g. agents that block tumour necrosis factor-alpha activity), agents that favourably modulate extracellular matrix (e.g. matrix metalloprotease inhibitors) and agents that augment natriuretic peptides.", 
    "13": "Amlodipine increases NO levels in coronary vessels and aorta via bradykinin-dependent mechanisms in vitro. We have previously reported that a long-acting Ca channel blocker, benidipine, increases cardiac NO levels in ischemic canine hearts, suggesting that benidipine may also protect against ischemia and reperfusion injury via bradykinin- and NO-dependent mechanisms. We examined this possibility. In open chest dogs, the left anterior descending coronary artery was perfused with blood through a bypass tube and was occluded for 90 min followed by 6 hours of reperfusion. Infarct size was assessed by TTC staining at 6 hours of reperfusion. When benidipine doses of 50, 100, and 200 ng/kg/min were infused via the bypass tube between 10 min prior to the onset of ischemia and after 60 min of reperfusion, systemic blood pressure did not change significantly. Infarct size decreased with the administration of benidipine (50, 100, and 200 ng/kg/min) when compared to the untreated condition (24.8+/-2.5, 17.3+/-3.1, and 16.5+/-2.0 vs. 43.4+/-5.6%, respectively) associated with the increased release of NO and bradykinin in the coronary venous blood upon reperfusion. Myeloperoxidase activity of the myocardium increased after 6 hours of reperfusion, which was attenuated by benidipine. The limitation of infarct size and the increase in myeloperoxidase activity were completely blunted by either L-NAME or HOE140. There were no significant differences in collateral blood flow assessed by the microsphere method after 45 min of ischemia for any of the groups. Thus, we conclude that the Ca channel blocker, benidipine, limits infarct size via bradykinin- and NO-dependent mechanisms.", 
    "14": "Buspirone is used as a neuroendocrine challenge in which the increase of circulating prolactin is taken as a measure of the sensitivity of central serotonergic (5-HT(1A)) pathways. Interpretation of the test is complicated, however, by the fact that buspirone possesses D(2) antagonist and 5-HT(1A) agonist activity, both of which will result in the release of prolactin. To understand the significance of prolactin secretion in response to buspirone, it is important to measure the differential actions of the two controlling pathways.", 
    "15": "To characterise the dual action of buspirone in stimulating the secretion of prolactin by blocking the 5-HT(1A) action with the 5-HT1A antagonist action of pindolol.", 
    "16": "Healthy male subjects (n=35) received buspirone (0.5 mg x kg bw(-1) orally) with and without pre-treatment with the 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist pindolol (40 mg over 2 days, 0.5 mg x kg bw(-1) on test day). Nine subjects underwent two additional trials in which they received a placebo with and without pre-treatment with pindolol.", 
    "17": "Pindolol alone caused a small but significant reduction (18%) in the tonic release of prolactin. Buspirone alone produced a robust prolactin response which was reduced to approximately half by pindolol pre-treatment. Pindolol pre-treatment also, on average, delayed the onset and peak of the prolactin response. There was wide variation among individuals both in the absolute response to buspirone and in the proportion that could be attributed to the non-serotonergic agonist action of buspirone (22-82% IQ range).", 
    "18": "Our results indicate that while serotonergic pathways play a minor role in the tonic release of prolactin, the response to a buspirone challenge alone cannot be used as a simple index of central serotonergic activity. However, if two challenges are carried out, one with buspirone and the other with buspirone plus pindolol, quantitative measures can be made of the sensitivity of both the 5-HT(1A) and the putative D(2) pathways controlling prolactin release.",

This article focuses on initial treatment group differences related to symptom reporting, as measured by a Symptom and Health Problem Checklist, and changes in daily visual functioning, as measured by the Visual Activities Questionnaire (VAQ).", 
    "24": "Across both treatment groups, there was an overall decline in the percent of participants reporting symptoms over time. Of 43 possible symptoms, 12 symptoms were reported with greater frequency by the surgically treated group and 7 symptoms more frequently by the medically-treated group. The surgical patients reported more total Symptom Impact Glaucoma (P = 0.005) and, in particular, more bother related to local eye symptoms. Very few treatment group differences were noted in visual functioning, although surgical patients reported more problems with activities related to their visual acuity (P = 0.024). The percentage of patients across treatment groups reporting worry about blindness was 50% at baseline but declined to approximately 25% over time.", 
    "25": "Overall, the QOL impact reported by the two treatment groups as measured by instruments used in this study is remarkably similar, with relatively few significant study group differences observed after up to 5 years of follow-up in the CIGTS. When significant differences in visual function have been detected using the VAQ, they are consistent with the clinical outcomes. To date, the most persistent QOL finding is the increased impact of local eye symptoms reported by the surgical group compared with the medical group. Although no changes are recommended in the treatment of newly diagnosed glaucoma patients at the time of this interim report, further follow-up will allow for more definitive answers to the QOL impact of these two treatment approaches.",

After treatment onset and early follow-up, patients were evaluated clinically at 6-month intervals. In addition, quality of life telephone interviews were conducted at similar frequency to the clinical visits. Patients in both arms of CIGTS were treated aggressively in an effort to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) to a level at or below a predetermined target pressure specific for each individual eye.

    "30": "VF loss was the primary outcome variable in CIGTS. Secondary outcomes of visual acuity (VA), IOP, and cataract were also studied.", 
    "31": "On the basis of completed follow-up through 4 years and partially completed through 5 years, VF loss did not differ significantly by initial treatment. Over the entire period of follow-up, surgical patients had a greater risk of substantial VA loss compared with medical patients. However, by 4 years after treatment, the average VA in the two groups was about equal. Over the course of follow-up, IOP in the medicine group has averaged 17 to 18 mmHg, whereas that in the surgery group averaged 14 to 15 mmHg. The rate of cataract requiring removal was greater in the surgically treated group.", 
    "32": "Both initial medical or initial surgical therapy result in about the same VF outcome after up to 5 years of follow-up. VA loss was greater in the surgery group, but the differences between groups seem to be converging as follow-up continues. When aggressive treatment aimed at substantial reduction in IOP from baseline is used, loss of VF can be seen to be minimal in general. Because 4 to 5 years of follow-up in a chronic disease is not adequate to draw treatment conclusions, these interim CIGTS outcomes do not support altering current treatment approaches to open-angle glaucoma.", 
    "33": "In ovarian cancer patients the poor nutritional status and cachexia are caused by the metabolic effects of the enlarging tumor masses and bowel obstruction. These patients may have a high resting energy expenditure due to increase in Cori cycle activity, glucose and triglyceride-fatty acid cycling and gluconeogenesis. Biochemical mediators of cachexia include cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-6, and tumor-produced catabolic factors, such as lipid-mobilizing factor, proteolysis-inducing factor, and anemia-inducing factor. Mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of obstruction may include extrinsic occlusion of the bowel due to pelvic, mesenteric omental masses, or intestinal motility disorders due to infilor tration of the mesentery or bowel muscle and nerves. The relief of malnutrition and cachexia may be attempted through nutritional support, pharmacological approach (megestrol acetate, cyclooxygenase inhibitors) and palliative treatment of bowel obstruction. Very few agents have been demonstrated to have true anticachectic activity, so future research should be addressed to the identification of drugs able to block the activity of tumor-produced catabolic factors. The decision regarding optimum management of bowel obstruction should be individualized. Krebs' and Goplerud's score (based on age, nutritional status, tumor status, ascites, previous chemotherapy and irradiation) seems to offer reliable eligibility criteria for those patients who can benefit from surgery.",

As a result, much will be learned regarding the use of treatment strategies using verapamil SR and atenolol with and without trandolapril and/or hydrochlororthiazide in patients with hypertension and CAD, all of whom are at high risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes. This trial will provide meaningful data on optimal treatment strategies for hypertension, especially among patients who are elderly, have diabetes, have left ventricular hypertrophy, or who are dyslipidemic. This trial will be the first to use Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VI) guidelines as blood pressure goals to determine the relative benefits of a calcium antagonist versus a beta-blocker strategy in reducing morbidity and mortality. In addition, women and Hispanic patients participating in INVEST will provide the largest controlled experience in the management of hypertensive patients with CAD, facilitating the development of future guidelines.", 
    "35": "We experienced an extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infant complicated with pulmonary atresia and necrotizing enterocolitis. She was born at 25 weeks of gestation with a birth weight of 752 g. Five hours after birth, she manifested cyanosis and was diagnosed as having pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (PAIVS). Infusion of lipo-prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) was started to keep the ductus open along with infusion of dopamine and dobutamine. At 8 days of life she developed hypotension and metabolic acidosis, and the diagnosis of intestinal perforation was made by free air in the abdomen. The excessive shunt flow to the pulmonary vasculature via the ductus was suspected to have caused an inadequate systemic flow leading to the intestinal ischemia and necrotizing enterocolitis. Lipo-PGE1 was discontinued to decrease the shunt flow through the ductus. Brock's operation (closed transventricular pulmonary valvotomy) was performed at the age of 8 and 11 days and the ligation of the ductus arteriosus was performed at the age of 13 days. Propranolol was administered to inhibit the pulmonary outflow tract constriction along with catecholamines to stabilize hemodynamics. She recovered slowly and her trachea was extubated at 58 days of life.",

Betaxolol's vasorelaxant effect is thought to involve the inhibition of calcium influx into vascular smooth muscle and is unrelated to its stereoselective beta-adrenergic blocking action. The authors assessed the vasodilatory effect of RS-betaxolol on different diameters of bovine retinal arterioles and venules, and these responses were compared with the responses induced by R- and S-betaxolol isomers in vitro.",

The diameters of all sizes of retinal arterioles and venules were significantly reduced (i.e., vasoconstricted) in the presence of 40 mM KCl (n = 20).

In both eyes, the travoprost vehicle (placebo) was instilled at 9 am and travoprost (0.0015% or 0.004%) was instilled at 9 pm, or timolol 0.5% was instilled at both times. The primary efficacy variable was mean IOP measured at 9 am, 11 am, and 4 pm at baseline and follow-up visits.",

Mean IOP, which was combined across study visits, was lower with travoprost 0.004% than with timolol 0.5% at 9 am (P = 0.0246), 11 am (P = 0.0039), and 4 pm (P = 0.0004). Intraocular pressure was lower with travoprost 0.004% than with travoprost 0.0015% at 11 am (P = 0.0314), the time of peak drug activity. Mean IOP was consistently lower with travoprost 0.0015% than with timolol 0.5%. Mean IOP reductions from baseline were significantly (P less than equal 0.0001) greater with travoprost 0.004% (8.0-8.9 mm Hg) than with timolol 0.5% (6.3-7.9 mm Hg). The most frequent related adverse events were hyperemia, pruritus, discomfort, pain, and iris pigmentation changes.

    "44": "Transforming growth factor-beta1 and its subtype receptor endoglin are key components in angiogenesis. We explored the role of angiotensin (Ang) II in the expression of endoglin and the underlying intracellular signaling mechanism in human coronary artery endothelial cells. Incubation of cells with Ang II upregulated endoglin expression in a concentration- and time-dependent manner (maximal effect with 10(-6) mol/L Ang II at 24 hours). The Ang II type 1 receptor blocker losartan, but not the type 2 receptor blocker PD 123,319, completely blocked the effect of Ang II. In parallel experiments, the mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor PD 098,059 fully inhibited the effect of Ang II on the expression of endoglin. Incubation of endothelial cells with Ang II also increased the expression of transforming growth factor-beta1 and -beta2 receptors and simultaneously decreased the levels of transforming growth factor-beta1. These effects of Ang II were also attenuated by losartan. We propose that Ang II via its type 1 receptor activation modulates the expression of transforming growth factor-beta1 receptors in human coronary endothelial cells. The activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase plays an important role in this process. These observations provide a new clue regarding the regulatory effect of Ang II on vascular remodeling after injury.",

Five trials in adults with cough and with or without airway obstruction had mixed results, but summary statistics did not reveal any significant benefits from beta2-agonists. Studies that enrolled more wheezing patients were more likely to show benefits from beta2-agonists, and in one study only patients with evidence of airflow limitation were more likely to benefit. Patients given beta2-agonists were more likely to report tremor, shakiness, or nervousness than those in the control groups.", 
    "50": "There is no evidence to support using beta2-agonists in children with acute cough and no evidence of airflow obstruction. There is little evidence that the routine use of beta2-agonists for adults with acute cough is helpful. These agents may reduce symptoms, including cough, in patients with evidence of airflow obstruction, but this potential benefit is not well-supported by the available data and must be weighed against the adverse effects associated with beta2-agonists.", 
    "51": "Orthostatic intolerance is occasionally reported by patients with syringomyelia and is usually attributed to vestibular symptoms or neurogenic orthostatic hypotension. Postural tachycardia syndrome has not been previously described in syringomyelia. A patient with long-standing syringomyelia and a Chiari type I anomaly developed disabling \"panic-like\" attacks associated to orthostatic intolerance five years after posterior fossa decompression and shunting of the syrinx. A head-up tilt test showed an early phase of postural orthostatic tachycardia followed by progressive arterial hypotension and bradycardia as seen in neurally mediated syncope. A magnetic resonance imaging scan showed a collapsed syrinx from the 3rd cervical to the 12th thoracic vertebra without syringobulbia. Fludrocortisone and beta-blockers led to resolution of symptoms. Partial sympathetic denervation of the legs in syringomyelia might explain the occasional occurrence of postural tachycardia syndrome. Postural tachycardia syndrome may be included as a possible cause of orthostatic symptoms in syringomyelia patients.", 
    "52": "This review evaluates the current position of calcium channel blockers (CCB) in antihypertensive treatment in the light of three major comparative studies and two extensive meta-analyses. The latter both show that CCB are equivalent to conventional (initial beta-blocker or diuretic therapy) when total and cardiovascular mortality are the end points. Divergent points between the meta-analyses include stroke and myocardial infarction (MI). One meta-analysis compared CCB with conventional therapy, to find a small 13% reduction in stroke and a small, nonsignificant 12% increase in MI. The other meta-analysis found a 26% increase in MI when CCB were compared with all other therapies including the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. This increase was most robust (P < .001) when comparing CCB with ACE inhibitors, consonant with proposed protective effects of ACE inhibitors on cardiovascular risk. At present, only the comparison of CCB with conventional therapy, and not that with ACE inhibitors, rests on secure comparative data. When cost is compelling, conventional therapy is less expensive. For the individual patient, issues of quality of life (for example, impotence with diuretics and beta-blockers) might be decisive. Nonetheless, beta-blockers are preferred in postinfarct patients or in those with heart failure or unstable angina (a contraindication to dihydropyridines in the absence of beta-blockade). In others, the benefits of only a borderline stroke reduction with CCB versus an equally borderline increase in MI should be evaluated for each individual patient, taking into account the age group and the patient's preferences. In conclusion, overall CCB are neither better nor worse than conventional therapy, allowing for possible small differences in stroke and MI. The ACE inhibitors may protect better, although data are incomplete.", 
    "53": "Many therapeutic options are proposed for the treatment of diastolic heart failure although no consensus has been established. In experimental trials, several drugs have demonstrated a potentially beneficial effect on ventricular diastolic dysfunction and could be used for diastolic heart failure: nitrate derivatives, converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists, spirolactones and bradycardia agents. CLINICAL PRACTICE: In everyday clinical practice, low-dose diuretics and treatments aimed at reducing the triggering factor leading to episodes of heart failure are used alone or in combination with treatments aimed at the underlying cause of the diastolic dysfunction: betablockers, calcium inhibitors or nitrate derivatives for ischemic heart disease, drug therapy for hypertension, anti-diabetes agents, anti-arrhythmic agents for atrial fibrillation. Digitalics are not indicated. In experimental trials, converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II antagonists have demonstrated interesting properties for the left ventricle but to date are not warranted for diastolic heart failure. TREATMENT OF THE CAUSE: Due to the lack of consensus on the optimal treatment for diastolic heart failure, most clinicians rely on treating the underlying heart disease and triggering factors.", 
    "54": "To assess the possible contribution of the circulatory and cardiac renin-angiotensin system (RAS) to the cardiac hypertrophy induced by a beta-agonist, the present study evaluated the effects of isoproterenol, alone or combined with an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor or AT(1) receptor blocker, on plasma and LV renin activity, ANG I, and ANG II, as well as left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) weight. Male Wistar rats received isoproterenol by osmotic minipump subcutaneously and quinapril or losartan once daily by gavage. Plasma and LV ANGs were measured by radioimmunoassay after separation by HPLC. Isoproterenol alone decreased blood pressure, more markedly when combined with losartan or quinapril. Isoproterenol significantly increased LV and RV weight and total collagen. Neither losartan nor quinapril inhibited the increases in LV or RV weight. Losartan prevented the increase in RV collagen but enhanced the increase in LV collagen. Isoproterenol increased plasma renin, ANG I, and ANG II three- to fourfold. Isoproterenol combined with losartan or quinapril, caused marked further increases except for a significant decrease in plasma ANG II with quinapril. Isoproterenol alone did not increase LV ANG II and, combined with losartan or quinapril, actually decreased LV ANG II. These results indicate that isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy is associated with clear increases in plasma ANG II, but not in LV ANG II. Both losartan and quinapril lower LV ANG II below control levels, but do not prevent the isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy. These findings do not support a role for the circulatory or cardiac RAS in the cardiac trophic responses to beta-receptor stimulation.", 
    "55": "The role of nitric oxide (NO) in the vagal control of heart rate (HR) is controversial. We investigated the cholinergic regulation of HR in isolated atrial preparations with an intact right vagus nerve from wild-type (nNOS+/+, n = 81) and neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) knockout (nNOS-/-, n = 43) mice. nNOS was immunofluorescently colocalized within choline-acetyltransferase-positive neurons in nNOS+/+ atria. The rate of decline in HR during vagal nerve stimulation (VNS, 3 and 5 Hz) was slower in nNOS-/- compared with nNOS+/+ atria in vitro (P < 0.01). There was no difference between the HR responses to carbamylcholine in nNOS+/+ and nNOS-/- atria. Selective nNOS inhibitors, vinyl-L-niohydrochloride or 1-2-trifluoromethylphenyl imidazole, or the guanylyl cyclase inhibitor, 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one significantly (P < 0.05) attenuated the decrease in HR with VNS at 3 Hz in nNOS+/+ atria. NOS inhibition had no effect in nNOS-/- atria during VNS. In all atria, the NO donor sodium nitroprusside significantly enhanced the magnitude of the vagal-induced bradycardia, showing the downstream intracellular pathways activated by NO were intact. These results suggest that neuronal NO facilitates vagally induced bradycardia via a presynaptic modulation of neurotransmission.", 
    "56": "It has been documented that beta-adrenergic antagonists can influence platelet aggregation by a mechanism independent of their ability to antagonize beta-adrenoceptors. Nebivolol, a selective beta1-adrenergic receptor antagonist with additional hemodynamic effects, is able to vasodilate human forearm vasculature by acting on the L-arginine/nitric oxide pathway. Constitutive nitric oxide synthase is present also in human platelets, resulting in the formation of nitric oxide, an endogenous inhibitor of platelet aggregation. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of nebivolol on platelet aggregation and in particular to determine the involvement of the platelet L-arginine/nitric oxide pathway. Propranolol, a nonselective beta-adrenergic antagonist, and carvedilol, a beta-blocker with vasodilating properties, were compared with nebivolol on platelet activity. Plasma from healthy male subjects was used. Platelet aggregation was achieved with adenosine diphosphate (ADP) (3 microM) and collagen (1 microg/ml), using the Born turbidimetric method to measure platelet aggregation. Our results showed that nebivolol, propranolol, and carvedilol all had an inhibitory effect on both ADP- and collagen-induced platelet aggregation. Nebivolol exhibited the greatest inhibition effect on platelet aggregation. The mechanism responsible for the inhibitory effect of nebivolol appeared to involve a nitric oxide-dependent pathway. Indeed, L-arginine augmented the inhibitory effects of nebivolol on platelet aggregation induced by collagen and ADP. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of nebivolol on platelet aggregation was reduced in the presence of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA). In conclusion, we have demonstrated in this study that nebivolol's mechanism of platelet aggregation inhibition differs from that of other beta-adrenergic antagonists by being partially dependent on nitric oxide production.", 
    "57": "Reptiles, particularly snakes, exhibit large and quantitatively similar increments in metabolic rate during muscular exercise and following a meal, when they are apparently inactive. The cardiovascular responses are similar during these two states, but the underlying autonomic control of the heart remains unknown. We describe both adrenergic and cholinergic tonus on the heart during rest, during enforced activity and during digestion (24-36 h after ingestion of 30 % of their body mass) in the snake Boa constrictor. The snakes were equipped with an arterial catheter for measurements of blood pressure and heart rate, and autonomic tonus was determined following infusion of the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (3 mg kg(-1)) and the muscarinic cholinoceptor antagonist atropine (3 mg kg(-1)). The mean heart rate of fasting animals at rest was 26.4+/-1.4 min(-1), and this increased to 36.1+/-1.4 min(-1) (means +/- S.E.M.; N=8) following double autonomic block (atropine and propranolol). The calculated cholinergic and adrenergic tones were 60.1+/-9.3 % and 19.8+/-2.2 %, respectively. Heart rate increased to 61.4+/-1.5 min(-1) during enforced activity, and this response was significantly reduced by propranolol (maximum values of 35.8+/-1.6 min(-1)), but unaffected by atropine. The cholinergic and adrenergic tones were 2.6+/-2.2 and 41.3+/-1.9 % during activity, respectively. Double autonomic block virtually abolished tachycardia associated with enforced activity (heart rate increased significantly from 36.1+/-1.4 to 37.6+/-1.3 min(-1)), indicating that non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic effectors are not involved in regulating heart rate during activity. Blood pressure also increased during activity. Digestion was accompanied by an increase in heart rate from 25.6+/-1.3 to 47.7+/-2.2 min(-1) (N=8). In these animals, heart rate decreased to 44.2+/-2.7 min(-1) following propranolol infusion and increased to 53.9+/-1.8 min(-1) after infusion of atropine, resulting in small cholinergic and adrenergic tones (6.0+/-3.5 and 11.1+/-1.1 %, respectively). The heart rate of digesting snakes was 47.0+/-1.0 min(-1) after double autonomic blockade, which is significantly higher than the value of 36.1+/-1.4 min(-1) in double-blocked fasting animals at rest. Therefore, it appears that some other factor exerts a positive chronotropic effect during digestion, and we propose that this factor may be a circulating regulatory peptide, possibly liberated from the gastrointestinal system in response to the presence of food.", 
    "58": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a complex and heterogeneous disease. Although most patients experience just a few symptoms, and have a good prognosis, there are others whose symptoms are severe and progressive, determined by different pathophysiological elements such as diastolic dysfunction, myocardial ischemia, arrhythmias and subaortic obstruction. Approximately 20-30% of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients develop an intraventricular dynamic gradient, which in some cases, is responsible for severe symptoms which are ameliorated once the obstruction is reduced. In many cases the symptoms can be controlled with medical treatment which includes betablockers, calcium-channel antagonists and dysopiramide, but some patients will still experience severe and refractory symptoms. This subgroup of patients, which represent approximately 5-10% of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, can be problematic from a management perspective. For many years, septal myectomy and/or mitral valve replacement offered the only effective alternative therapy for these patients. However, the high rates of morbidity and mortality associated with these procedures have necessitated the search for new and less invasive procedures such as ventricular pacing and percutaneous septal ablation. Although the initial results with sequential pacing were encouraging, further studies have suggested a significant placebo effect, which makes its application controversial. In the last 5 years selective embolization of the septal artery precipitating a localized myocardial infarction has been utilized to reduce the subaortic gradient. The potential indications and efficacy of these new forms of treatment, like ventricular pacing and percutaneous septal ablation, are presently under evaluation and are the main subject of this review. Medical treatment, with either beta-blockers, calcium channel antagonists or dysopiramide constitutes the first therapeutic step. Surgery, while alleviating the subaortic obstruction and reducing the intraventicular pressure and mitral insufficiency, produces important and long-lasting symptomatic and functional improvement in most of these patients, and it continues to be an important therapeutic alternative in these cases. If the first results with sequential pacemaker implants were encouraging, today it is alluded to an important placebo effect that causes its application to be controversial. In the last 5 years the path has been made in the creation of a septal infarction located through the embolization of the septal branches to reduce the gradient.",

    "61": "We used the database of the RIGA study (Registry of Infarctions in Galicia) including 655 consecutive patients admitted to any hospital of Galicia for acute myocardial infarction from February to July, 1995. An extensive review of the literature was previously made to establish therapeutic criteria for the use of ss-blockers in patients with acute myocardial infarction. The survey of the RIGA database was compared with the criteria established to determine the definition of appropriate usage.", 
    "62": "210 out of 655 patients (32%) received ss-blockers. Interestingly, treatment (or lack of treatment) with ss-blockers was deemed appropriated in 51.4% of the patients. This inadequacy was related to the use of ACE inhibitors, calcium antagonists and thrombolysis.",

    "64": "The psychostimulants methylphenidate, amphetamine and pemoline are among the most common medications used today in child and adolescent psychiatry for the treatment of patients with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Frequently, these medications are used in combination with other medications on a short or long term basis. The present review examines psychostimulant pharmacology, summarises reported drug-drug interactions and explores underlying pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic considerations for interactions. A computerised search was undertaken using Medline (1966 to 2000) and Current Contents to provide the literature base for reports of drug-drug interactions involving psychostimulants. These leads were further cross-referenced for completeness of the survey. Methylphenidate appears to be more often implicated in pharmacokinetic interactions suggestive of possible metabolic inhibition, although the mechanisms still remain unclear. Amphetamine was more often involved in apparent pharmacodynamic interactions and could potentially be influenced by medications affecting cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6. No published reports of drug interactions involving pemoline were found. The alpha2-adrenergic agonists clonidine and guanfacine have been implicated in several interactions. Perhaps best documented is their antagonism by tricyclic antidepressants and phenothiazines. In additional, concurrent beta-blocker use, or abrupt discontinuation, can lead to hypertensive response. Although there are few published well-controlled interaction studies with psychostimulants and alpha2-adrenergic agonists, it appears that these agents may be safely coadministered. The interactions of monoamine oxidase inhibitors with psychostimulants represent one of the few strict contraindications.", 
    "65": "Differential display-PCR (DDPCR) was used to identify a Streptococcus pneumoniae gene with enhanced transcription during growth in the murine peritoneal cavity. Northern dot blot analysis and comparative densitometry confirmed a 1.8-fold increase in expression of the encoded sequence following murine peritoneal culture (MPC) versus laboratory culture or control culture (CC). Sequencing and basic local alignment search tool analysis identified the DDPCR fragment as pstS, the phosphate-binding protein of a high-affinity phosphate uptake system. PCR amplification of the complete pstS gene followed by restriction analysis and sequencing suggests a high level of conservation between strains and serotypes. Quantitative immunodot blotting using antiserum to recombinant PstS (rPstS) demonstrated an approximately twofold increase in PstS production during MPC from that during CCs, a finding consistent with the low levels of phosphate observed in the peritoneum. Moreover, immunodot blot and Northern analysis demonstrated phosphate-dependent production of PstS in six of seven strains examined. These results identify pstS expression as responsive to the MPC environment and extracellular phosphate concentrations. Presently, it remains unclear if phosphate concentrations in vivo contribute to the regulation of pstS. Finally, polyclonal antiserum to rPstS did not inhibit growth of the pneumococcus in vitro, suggesting that antibodies do not block phosphate uptake; moreover, vaccination of mice with rPstS did not protect against intraperitoneal challenge as assessed by the 50% lethal dose.", 
    "66": "The placenta expresses high levels of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11betaHSD2) that converts cortisol into inactive 11-keto metabolites and effectively protects the developing fetus from maternal cortisol during pregnancy. Impairment of this glucocorticoid barrier has adverse effects on fetal outcomes. A similar spectrum of adverse fetal effects is induced by antenatal stress during pregnancy. To examine the hypothesis that physiological stress may regulate placental 11betaHSD2 gene expression, we examined the effects of the catecholamines norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E) on 11betaHSD2 expression in human trophoblastic cells. With the use of Northern blotting and semiquantitative RT-PCR, we determined that NE and E rapidly downregulate 11betaHSD2 steady-state mRNA levels in early- and late-gestation human trophoblasts and BeWo trophoblastic cells. Experiments using different adrenoceptor subtype-selective agonists and antagonists demonstrated that this catecholamine suppression of 11betaHSD2 mRNA expression is mediated via both alpha(1)- and alpha(2)-adrenoceptors and is independent of beta-adrenergic stimulation. To examine transcriptional regulation, BeWo cells were transiently transfected with a reporter construct in which an 11betaHSD2 human promoter sequence was inserted upstream of the luciferase gene. Treatment with 10(-7) M NE decreased luciferase activity by ~60% (n = 3, P < 0.01). These results suggest the NE/E-mediated decrease in placental 11betaHSD2 gene expression is an instance of alpha-adrenoceptor-specific rapid transcriptional inhibition of an adrenergic target gene. This molecular mechanism may be involved in the deleterious effects of antenatal physiological stress on fetoplacental growth and development.", 
    "67": "We examined the effects of clonidine injected unilaterally into the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) of conscious, unrestrained rats. We also examined whether the local alpha(2)-adrenoceptor mechanism contributed to the action of clonidine injected into the RVLM. Injection of clonidine but not vehicle solution significantly decreased the mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) in conscious, unrestrained rats as well as in propofol-anesthetized rats. The frequency of natural behavior was significantly lower after clonidine injection than after vehicle injection. The depressor and sympathoinhibitory responses were significantly larger in the propofol-anesthetized rats than in the conscious rats. Coinjection of a selective alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist, 2-methoxyidazoxan, with clonidine into the RVLM significantly attenuated the depressor, bradycardiac, sympathoinhibitory, and sedative effects of clonidine injected alone. In conclusion, clonidine injected into the RVLM decreased MAP, HR, and RSNA and caused sedation in conscious, unrestrained rats. The action of clonidine in the RVLM was at least partly mediated by alpha(2)-adrenoceptor mechanisms.", 
    "68": "Hemodynamic responses to cocaine vary greatly between animals, and the variability is related to the incidence of cocaine-induced cardiomyopathies and hypertension. The variability in cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance responses to cocaine in individuals is correlated with the responses to acute startle (air jet). This experiment was designed to determine whether responses to cocaine and to air jet are related to those evoked by a conditioned stimulus (tone preceding foot shock) and to an unconditioned stimulus (cold water). We verified the relationship in hemodynamic response patterns between cocaine and cold stress using selective receptor antagonists. Rats were instrumented with a pulsed Doppler flow probe on the ascending aorta for determination of cardiac output and with an arterial cannula for recording arterial pressure and heart rate. After recovery, some rats were tested multiple times with four different stimuli: air jet (6 trials), 15-s tone preceding 1-s foot shock (12 trials), cold water exposure (1 cm deep for 1 min, 4-12 trials), and cocaine (5 mg/kg iv, 4-6 trials) while hemodynamic parameters were recorded. Each stimulus was capable of eliciting a pressor response that was associated with variable changes in cardiac output. The cardiac output response to cocaine was correlated with the initial responses to each stressor in individual rats. Responses evoked by cold stress were most similar to those elicited by cocaine. Furthermore, nicardipine (25 microg/kg iv) or atropine methylbromide (0.5 mg/kg iv) pretreatment prevented the cardiac output differences to acute cold stress, as noted after cocaine administration. On the other hand, propranolol (1 mg/kg iv) exacerbated both the decrease in cardiac output and the stress-induced increase in systemic vascular resistance as previously reported with cocaine. Therefore, the initial response to cold water exposure is a reliable method of evoking characteristic hemodynamic response patterns that, as seen with cocaine, may provide a suitable model for identifying the causes for predilection to stress-induced cardiovascular disease.",

    "73": "1. The influence of bradykinin (BK) on blood glucose and plasma insulin levels was investigated in anaesthetized rats. 2. Blood glucose level was dose-dependently increased by intravenous infusion of BK. This effect of BK was enhanced by captopril, an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Des-Arg9-bradykinin (DABK), a kinin B1 receptor agonist, did not modify blood glucose levels while the effect of BK was inhibited by Hoe-140, a kinin B2 receptor antagonist. 3. The effect of BK was reduced by the NO-synthase inhibitor, N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), and by the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin. The effect of BK was suppressed by the association of propranolol with phentolamine or phenoxybenzamine. It was also reduced by hexamethonium, a ganglion-blocking drug. In adrenalectomized rats, the infusion of BK slightly decreased blood glucose levels. 4. The hyperglycaemic effect of adrenaline was suppressed by propranolol associated with phentolamine or phenoxybenzamine, but it was not modified by L-NAME. 5. Infusion of BK did not modify plasma insulin levels. However, after phentolamine and propranolol, BK induced a transient 2 fold rise in plasma insulin levels. The release of insulin was dose-dependent and inhibited by Hoe-140. 6. We conclude that infusion of BK induces, via a stimulation of B2 receptors, the release of NO and of prostanoids. The latter agents activate through a reflex pathway the release of catecholamines from the adrenal medulla. This release increases blood glucose levels and reduces plasma insulin levels. After adrenoceptor inhibition, BK induces a secretion of insulin, via the stimulation of B2 receptors.",

Eight fit males (cyclists or triathletes) performed a protocol to determine the intensity corresponding to the individual equilibrium point between lactate entry and removal from the blood (incremental test after exercise induced lactic acidosis), determined from the blood lactate (Lacmin) and glucose (Glucmin) response. This protocol was performed twice in a double-blind randomized order by ingesting either propranolol (80 mg) or a placebo (dextrose), 120 min prior to the test. The blood lactate and glucose concentration obtained 7 minutes after anaerobic exercise (Wingate test) was significantly lower (p < 0.01) with the acute beta-adrenergic blockade (9.1 +/- 1.5 mM; 3.9 +/- 0.1 mM), respectively than in the placebo condition (12.4 +/- 1.8 mM; 5.0 +/- 0.1 mM). There was no difference (p > 0.05) between the exercise intensity determined by Lacmin (212.1 +/- 17.4 W) and Glucmin (218.2 +/- 22.1 W) during exercise performed without acute beta-adrenergic blockade. The exercise intensity at Lacmin was lowered (p < 0.05) from 212.1 +/- 17.4 to 181.0 +/- 15.6 W and heart rate at Lacmin was reduced (p < 0 .01) from 161.2 +/- 8.4 to 129.3 +/- 6.2 beats min(-1) as a result of the blockade. It was not possible to determine the exercise intensity corresponding to Glucmin with beta-adrenergic blockade, since the blood glucose concentration presented a continuous decrease during the incremental test. We concluded that the similar pattern response of blood lactate and glucose during an incremental test after exercise induced lactic acidosis, is not present during beta-adrenergic blockade suggesting that, at least in part, this behavior depends upon adrenergic stimulation.",

    "102": "The severity of neurologic dysfunction after circulatory arrest depends on cerebral reperfusion during and after resuscitation. The objective of current study was to investigate the temporal and spatial patterns of the cerebral perfusion immediately after resuscitation. Precise control of circulatory arrest was achieved in rats by combination of asphyxia and transient blockage of cardiac-specific beta-adrenergic receptors with esmolol, an ultra-short-acting beta-blocker. Animals were randomized into 3 groups with resuscitation starting 0.5 (sham group, no asphyxia, n = 5), 4 (Group 2, n = 5), or 12 minutes (Group 3, n = 8) later by retrograde intraarterial infusion of donor blood along with a resuscitation mixture. Cerebral perfusion was measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using arterial spin labeling. The average perfusion before arrest was 163 +/- 27 mL 100 g(-1) min(-1) under isoflurane anesthesia. Resuscitation led to transient perfusion increase, which started from thalamus and hypothalamus and later shifted to the cortex. Severe hypoperfusion to as low as 6% to 20% of the normal level developed in the first 10 to 20 minutes of reperfusion and lasted for at least 2 hours. On the fifth day after circulatory arrest, all animals showed a normal level of perfusion (159 +/- 57 mL 100 g(-1) min(-1) ) and minimal neurologic deficit. Nevertheless, histologic examination revealed extensive changes in the CA1 region of the hippocampus consistent with global ischemia and reperfusion damage. The combination of an improved circulatory arrest model and noninvasive MRI cerebral perfusion measurements provides a powerful tool for investigations of circulatory arrest and resuscitation, allowing for evaluation of therapies aimed at modulating cerebral reperfusion.", 
    "103": "Alterations in alpha(1)-adrenoceptor (alpha(1)AR) density and related signal transduction proteins were reported in cardiomyopathic hearts in the failing stage. The electromechanical modification of alpha(1)-adrenergic stimulation in the failing heart is unclear. The present study compares the alpha(1)AR-stimulated electromechanical response in failing ventricles of genetically cardiomyopathic BIO 14.6 hamsters (280-320 days old) with that in age-matched normal Syrian hamsters. The action potential was recorded with a conventional microelectrode technique, and twitch force was measured with a transducer. In the presence of propranolol, phenylephrine increased the contraction and prolonged the action potential duration (APD) to similar values in ventricles of both strains, despite a prolonged basal APD in cardiomyopathic ventricles. The positive inotropism stimulated by phenylephrine was inhibited by staurosporine, and was potentiated by 4 beta-phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) in both strains. The maximum positive inotropic effect of phenylephrine in PDBu-treated ventricles of normal hamsters was significantly greater than that in BIO 14.6 hamsters. The effects of phenylephrine on the ventricular force-frequency relationship and on the mechanical restitution in both normal and BIO 14.6 strain hamsters were examined. The uniform negative force-frequency relationship and the altered mechanical restitution reveal a defect of intracellular Ca(2+) handling in cardiomyopathic BIO 14.6 hamsters. alpha(1)-Adrenergic modulation cannot convert the defective properties in the model of the failing heart. Nevertheless, phenylephrine decreased post-rest potentiation in short rest periods, and enhanced post-rest decay after longer resting periods. The results indicate that alpha(1)-adrenergic action enhances a gradual loss of Ca(2+) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, although its action in prolonging the APD can indirectly increase the influx of Ca(2+).", 
    "104": "Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT)-mediated methylation of 2-hydroxyestradiol (endogenous estradiol metabolite) to 2-methoxyestradiol (angiogenesis inhibitor) may be responsible for the antimitogenic effects of 2-hydroxyestradiol on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Catecholamines are also substrates for COMT, and increased levels of catecholamines are associated with vasoocclusive disorders. We hypothesize that catecholamines may abrogate the vasoprotective effects of 2-hydroxyestradiol by competing for COMT and inhibiting 2-methoxyestradiol formation. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the antimitogenic effects of 0.001 to 0.1 micromol/L of 2-hydroxyestradiol on human aortic VSMC proliferation (cell number and DNA synthesis), collagen synthesis, and migration in the presence and absence of catecholamines. Norepinephrine, epinephrine, and isoproterenol concentration-dependently abrogated the inhibitory effects of 2-hydroxyestradiol on cell number, DNA synthesis, collagen synthesis, and cell migration. These modulatory/attenuating effects of catecholamines were not abrogated in the presence of the alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists, phentolamine mesylate and propranolol, respectively. In contrast to 2-hydroxyestradiol, the antimitogenic effects of 2-methoxyestradiol (0.1 micromol/L) were not attenuated by isoproterenol (1 micromol/L) or quercetin (competitive inhibitor of COMT, 10 micromol/L). Norepinephrine, epinephrine, and isoproterenol concentration-dependently (10 to 500 micromol/L) inhibited the metabolism of 2-hydroxyestradiol (0.25 to 2 micromol/L) to 2-methoxyestradiol, and the potency of the catecholamines to reverse 2-hydroxyestradiol-induced inhibition of VSMC proliferation, collagen synthesis, and migration was correlated with their ability to inhibit 2-methoxyestradiol formation. Our findings suggest that catecholamines within the vasculature may abrogate the anti-vaso-occlusive effects of estradiol and 2-hydroxyestradiol by blocking 2-methoxyestradiol formation.", 
    "105": "Elk-1, a member of the ternary complex factor family of Ets domain proteins that bind serum response elements, is activated by phosphorylation in a cell-specific manner in response to growth factors and other agents. The purpose of the current study was to determine whether Elk-1 activation contributes to glucose-/depolarization-induced Ca(2+)-dependent induction of immediate early response genes in pancreatic islet beta-cells. The results of experiments in insulinoma (MIN6) cells demonstrated that Elk-1-binding sites (Ets elements) in the Egr-1 gene promoter contribute to transcriptional activation of the gene. Treatment with either epidermal growth factor (EGF), a known inducer of beta-cell hyperplasia, glucose, or KCl-induced depolarization resulted in Ser(383) phosphorylation and transcriptional activation of Elk-1 (4 +/- 0.3-, P = 0.003, 2.3 +/- 0.19-, P = 0.002, and 2.2 +/- 0.1- fold, P = 0.001 respectively). The depolarization response was inhibited by the Ca(2+) channel blocker verapamil and by the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (53 +/- 6 and 55 +/- 0.5%, respectively). EGF-induced activation of Elk-1 was also inhibited by PD98059 (60 +/- 5%). A dominant negative Ras produced partial inhibition (42%) of the depolarization-induced Elk-1 transcriptional activation. Transfection with a constitutively active Ca(2+)/calmodulin kinase IV plasmid also resulted in Elk-1 transcriptional activation. Experiments with p38, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and protein kinase A inhibitors indicated that these pathways are not involved. We conclude that Elk-1 activation contributes to glucose-/depolarization-induced Ca(2+)-dependent induction of immediate early growth response genes in pancreatic islet beta-cells. Furthermore, the results demonstrated a convergence of nutrient- and growth factor-mediated signaling pathways on Elk-1 activation through induction of Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK-1 and -2. The role of these pathways in the glucose-induced proliferation of islet beta-cells can now be assessed.", 
    "106": "The gut innervation is formed by an intrinsic and an extrinsic component. The former is responsible for the intestinal contractions that occur in the total absence of extrinsic innervation. We hypothesize that the intrinsic plexuses do not produce local contraction, but mediate reflex actions of the gut musculature. This hypothesis was investigated in the rectum of the experimental animal. In 16 anesthetized mongrel dogs, the rectum was exposed, and 3 monopolar silver-silver chloride electrodes were sutured serially to the rectal wall and connected to a rectilinear pen recorder. The rectal electric activity was recorded at rest and on rectal inflation while the anal pressure was synchronously registered. The tests were repeated after separate drug administration using phentolamine, propranolol (adrenoceptor blocking agents), atropine (cholinergic blocking agent), drotaverine (direct smooth muscle relaxant), and nitroglycerine. (NO donor, inhibitory noncholinergic, nonadrenergic mediator). Slow waves or pacesetter potentials (PPs) and action potentials (APs) were recorded from the three electrodes. Rectal balloon distension caused an increase of frequency, amplitude, and conduction velocity of these waves, as well as a decrease of anal pressure. Repetition of the test after administration of phentolamine, propranotol, and atropine effected no change in rectal electromyelographic (EMG) activity or anal pressure, while drotaverine and nitroglycerine administration aborted both the electric activity and the anal pressure response. We conclude that the rectal electric activity, presumably responsible for rectal motility, was not aborted by enteric nervous plexus block but by direct muscle relaxant. This suggests that the enteric plexus has no direct action on the rectal motile activity but mediates the rectal reflex actions. This concept might explain some of the hitherto unknown mechanisms of rectal dyssynergia syndromes.",

    "117": "The temperature-dependence of ATP release and contraction response evoked by different agonists were investigated in superfused guinea-pig vas deferens. Alpha-adrenoceptor agonists, i.e. noradrenaline (300 microM), and alpha-methyl-noradrenaline (300 microM), increased the basal ATP outflow, measured by the luciferin-luciferase assay, and induced biphasic contractile response. Cooling the bath temperature to 12 degrees C almost completely inhibited ATP release and twitch contraction evoked by alpha-adrenoceptor agonists, whereas the phasic contraction remained unaffected. In contrast, twitch contraction and subsequent ATP release induced by beta,gamma-methylene-ATP, a selective P2 receptor agonist (100 microM), was not reduced by low temperature. The ectoATPase activity, measured by HPLC technique was not significantly different at 37 degrees C and 12 degrees C. Nifedipine (1 microM), the voltage sensitive Ca2+ channel blocker eliminated beta,gamma-methylene-ATP evoked twitch contraction but not ATP release. In conclusion, alpha-adrenoceptor and P2 receptor agonists utilize distinct mechanisms to elicit ATP release and contraction: alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated ATP release and contraction is temperature-dependent, indicating the involvement of a carrier-mediated process in it, whereas P2x purinoceptor evoked ATP release and twitch is mediated by a different mechanism.", 
    "118": "The use of molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) microparticles in a partial filling application of capillary electrochromatography (CEC) has previously been shown successful for the enantiomer separation of propranolol. In this investigation, the influence of some important parameters in the preparation protocol, i.e., template to monomer ratio, type of cross-linker and functional monomers, and the effect of separation condition, i.e., organic modifier content, pH and the temperature of the column, on the electrochromatographic behavior of the MIP microparticles were studied. It was found that ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate (EDMA), having two reactive double bonds, was superior in terms CEC performance to trimethylpropane trimethacrylate (TRIM) and pentaerythritol tetraacrylate (PETEA) having three and four double bonds, respectively. The use of weak functional monomers, i.e., monomers lacking a strong interaction with the template, was shown to increase the separation efficiency. It was found that the template to functional monomer ratio had a pronounced influence on the MIP microparticle partial filling CEC performance as well as the size of the obtained microparticles. The use of a partial filling technique realizes the use of a new MIP phase in every new separation as well as the ability of altering the selectivity of the separation column and length of the MIP without the need for column switching.",

At pH* 7.8 and 10.4 the electroosmotic flow was negligible and repeatable. On the other hand, at pH* 3 a weak, unstable electroosmotic flow was observed, due to a change in the conformation of the polymer under acidic conditions.

Ethanol was administered for 1, 2, 3, or 4 wk in a liquid diet containing 8.7% ethanol (v/v), which means that 37% of the total calories were derived from ethanol. Rats treated with ethanol for 1 wk showed an increase in hypothalamic and plasma levels of immunoreactive (IR)-beta-EP, but displayed no significant effect on NK cell activity determined by (51)Cr release assay, as compared with those in pair-fed and ad libitum-fed animals. However, animals treated with ethanol for 2, 3, or 4 wk showed decreased hypothalamic and plasma levels of IR-beta-EP and decreased splenic NK cell activity. No significant decrease in the number of splenocytes and NK cells or in the percentage of NK cells was seen until after 3 and 4 wk of ethanol treatment. Exposure in vitro of splenic lymphocytes obtained from control animals to various concentrations of beta-EP increased NK cell activity. The opiate antagonist naltrexone blocked the beta-EP-stimulated effect. The in vitro NK cell response to beta-EP was reduced in the splenocytes obtained from animals treated with ethanol for 2 wk, but not in those obtained from animals treated with ethanol for 1 wk as compared with those in control animals. Additionally, beta-EP administration into the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus stimulated NK cell cytolytic activity, whereas the opiate blocker administration reduced NK cell activity. The NK cell responses to paraventricular nucleus beta-EP were reduced in the animals treated with ethanol for 2 wk. These data provide evidence for the first time that ethanol inhibits NK cell cytolytic activity, possibly by reducing beta-EP-regulated splenic NK cell function.",

The mechanism of the complementary spermicidal action produced by a combination of benzamil and propranolol on human spermatozoa has been investigated also. When administered alone benzamil and propranolol produced a dose- and time-dependent decrease in motility of sperm in ejaculated semen and spermatozoa separated from semen. A combination of benzamil and propranolol exhibited a complementary spermicidal action, thereby resulting in dose reduction of both drugs for obtaining total immotility within 1 min of administration. An increase in the intracellular Ca2+ level was found to contribute to the spermicidal activity. Inhibition of the Na+-Ca2+ exchange system on sperm membrane by benzamil and membrane stabilization by propranolol resulted in accumulation of Ca2+ inside the sperm cells. When the two drugs were used in combination the time required for the total loss of motility of spermatozoa was significantly reduced due to a similar mechanism of action of both drugs.", 
    "143": "Diabetes mellitus is a major risk factor for the development of congestive heart failure (CHF). Diabetic cardiomyopathy has been acknowledged as a distinct disease entity that is an additional risk for diabetic patients to develop CHF, especially when they are affected by hypertension or epicardial coronary artery disease. Moreover, diabetic cardiomyopathy has been documented to lead to CHF even in the absence of other risk factors. As the combination of hypertension and diabetes has shown to be particularly detrimental, aggressive blood pressure control with a goal of less than 130/85 mm Hg is of critical importance. The first choice for pharmacologic treatment is angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Double- or triple-drug therapy is frequently required for good control. The increased risk of epicardial coronary artery disease in patients with diabetes warrants stringent treatment of dyslipidemia. If dilated cardiomyopathy with low ejection fraction is present, therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, digoxin, diuretics, beta-blockers, and spironolactone (for patients with New York Heart Association class III to IV functional status) is indicated. If cardiac dysfunction consists predominantly of impaired diastolic function, heart rate control with a beta-blocker or a calcium antagonist is of particular importance. Control of blood glucose should be achieved, with hemoglobin A(1c) levels of less than 7%. Hyperinsulinemia should be avoided when possible; therefore, insulin-sensitizing agents are preferred over insulin-secretion-enhancing agents. Symptoms of CHF and acutely decompensated CHF should be treated no differently than nondiabetic patients. Care for patients with diabetes always includes lifestyle changes consisting of smoking cessation, decreasing obesity, regular exercise, and a heart-healthy diabetic diet.", 
    "144": "It is critical that the diagnosis of peripartum cardiomyopathy is limited to women with congestive heart failure and decreased systolic function of the left ventricle in last month of pregnancy or within 5 months after delivery. Patients must have no pre-existing cardiac disease and no other cause for current cardiac dysfunction. The inclusion of patients before the last month of pregnancy or after 5 months postpartum introduces a large number of patients with cardiac disorders due to causes other than peripartum cardiomyopathy. Ventricular performance at rest and with exertion determines the type of management, its intensity, and duration. Patients whose ventricular function is normal at rest and with exercise or dobutamine can have their heart failure therapy tapered and ultimately discontinued after 6 to 12 months of standard treatment. Those with normal resting but abnormal stress cardiac function should continue some form of medical therapy (afterload reduction or beta-blocker) for longer periods of time, if not for life. Those with persistently abnormal ventricular function must receive optimal heart failure therapy forever and face the same relatively poor prognosis as patients with dilated cardiomyopathy from any cause. Options for management include standard heart failure therapy (digoxin, diuretics, afterload reduction, and anticoagulation), Swan-Ganz catheter monitoring and use of inotropic agents, intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation, and left ventricular assist device. Patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy are candidates for heart transplantation, assuming they meet all other criteria.", 
    "145": "Idiopathic giant cell myocarditis (IGCM) is an uncommon disorder that is of general importance because it most commonly affects young individuals, is usually fatal without treatment, and may respond to aggressive medical and surgical therapy. IGCM is most often progressive over days to weeks and frequently requires the concurrent management of congestive heart failure, tachyarrhythmias, and heart block. After common causes of heart disease are excluded, the diagnosis must be confirmed by endomyocardial biopsy. Standard pharmacologic therapy for New York Heart Association functional class II to III congestive heart failure due to left ventricular systolic failure includes an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, a beta-blocker such as carvedilol, and diuretics as needed. We avoid digoxin and reserve inotropic agents for patients whose circulatory requirements cannot be supported with standard oral vasodilators and diuretics. Heart block may require a temporary or permanent pacemaker. Ventricular tachycardia is common and usually is managed chronically with an implantable cardiac defibrillator and antiarrhythmic drugs such as amiodarone. Despite optimal medical management, mechanical support may be required as a temporary bridge to recovery or transplantation. The intra-aortic balloon pump and ventricular assist device have been used successfully for patients with refractory pump failure due to acute IGCM. Heart transplantation is efficacious, with a 71% 5-year survival, despite a 20% to 25% rate of histologic recurrence in surveillance endomyocardial biopsies. The role of aggressive immunosuppression as part of the primary treatment of IGCM is under active investigation. Preliminary data suggest that primary therapy with a regimen that includes muromonab-CD3, cyclosporine, and steroids may significantly improve transplant-free survival.", 
    "146": "We have previously shown in the rat model that acutely or chronically increased peripheral catecholamines lead to suppression of lymphocyte responsiveness via alpha(2)-adrenoceptor activation. Here we investigated the effects of alpha-adrenergic treatment on total leukocyte numbers and proportions of leukocyte subsets in peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues. It was found that a 12-h treatment with subcutaneously implanted tablets, one containing norepinephrine (NE) and one propranolol, leads to an increase in total blood leukocyte counts, due to a pronounced increase in granulocytes. In contrast, the numbers of all classes of lymphocytes other than NK cells were decreased. This decrease in blood lymphocytes is apparently not due to redistribution, since in the thymus, spleen, mesenteric and peripheral lymph nodes, the total numbers of lymphocytes were decreased as well, without any changes in subpopulations. Analogous results were obtained with rats adrenalectomized before the catecholamine treatment. Animals that received the alpha-adrenergic treatment displayed significantly more apoptotic cells in the lymphoid organs, as determined by the TUNEL technique. In the spleen, the enhanced rate of apoptosis was confined to the white pulp; red pulp areas exhibited significantly fewer apoptotic cells. Thus, an increased alpha-adrenergic tone in rats led to a general loss of lymphocytes due to lymphocyte directed apoptosis that was independent of glucocorticoids.",

Pretreatment with the beta1-blocker, metoprolol, did not inhibit the activation of stress-induced MAP kinase, while blockage of the alpha1-adrenoceptor by pretreatment with alpha1-blocker, prazosin or the alpha/beta-blocker, amosulalol, attenuated the activation. Application of the alpha1-agonist, phenylephrine, but not the beta-agonist, isoproterenol, to the perfused rat heart elicited MAP activation.

    "168": "Fat tissue is abundant in the body and preferred in soft tissue augmentation. Since resorption is its greatest disadvantage, many agents have been tried in an attempt to increase fat graft survival in various studies. Yet selective beta1 blocker had not been used before. The effect of selective beta1 blockers on resorption following auto-transplantation of free fat graft was examined in rats. The effect of selective beta1 blockers was compared with those of insulin and saline solution as a control. For this comparison, the weight of fat grafts was measured both during and nine months after operation using the \"liquid overflow method\" in which obtained material was put into 5 cc syringe filled with saline solution and the increase in liquid level was recorded as graft volume. Histological examination of grafts and statistical analyses of the results were also made. Our in vivo study demonstrated that selective beta1 blocker significantly increased free fat graft survival.

    "169": "We examined the effects of mexiletine, a class Ib antiarrhythmic drug, on the changes in tension and adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) content induced by salbutamol and forskolin in bovine tracheal smooth muscle. Salbutamol (0.0001-1 microM) produced concentration-dependent relaxation in bovine tracheal smooth muscle contracted with methacholine (0.3 microM). Mexiletine (5-500 microM) caused the rightward shifts of concentration-response curves for the relaxant responses to salbutamol in a concentration-dependent manner. Mexiletine (5, 50 or 500 microM) did not change basal cAMP levels, whereas it concentration-dependently attenuated the salbutamol (0.1 microM)-induced cAMP accumulation. On the other hand, mexiletine (500 microM) did not change the concentration-response curves for the relaxant responses to forskolin (0.001-10 microM). Mexiletine slightly but significantly (P<0.05) increased forskolin (1 microM)-induced cAMP accumulation. In radioligand binding experiments, mexiletine concentration-dependently displaced the specific binding of [125I]cyanopindolol to beta-adrenoceptors on bovine tracheal smooth muscle membranes. By contrast, lidocaine, another class Ib antiarrhythmic drug, did not change the binding of [125I]cyanopindolol. These results demonstrate that mexiletine prevents the binding of beta2-adrenoceptor agonists to their receptors and thereby suppresses manifestation of subsequent pharmacological responses.", 
    "170": "The contribution of the angiotensin (Ang) II type 2 receptor (AT2R) to cardiac hypertrophy is still controversial. Here we examined the effect of overexpressing the human AT2R in cultured porcine cardiac fibroblasts (pFib) on proliferation, procollagen I mRNA expression, and - as putatively underlying signal-transduction pathways - on mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK1/ERK2 and phosphotyrosine phosphatase activities. As quantitated by 125I-(Sar1,Ile8)-Ang II binding, transduction of cardiac fibroblasts with the adenoviral AT2R expression vector led to a six- to tenfold higher AT2 than endogenous Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R) expression. The overexpressed AT2R had the same apparent molecular mass as the endogenous AT2R in rat PC12W cells. Proliferation was not significantly lower in AT2R expressing pFib than in antisense-transduced controls (TA2) upon stimulation with Ang II (AT2R 110.5+/-4.8% vs. TA2 110.2+/-5.5%), Ang II plus the AT1R blocker Irbesartan (97.1+/-1.4% vs. 108.0+/-5.0; P=0.052) and the partial AT2R antagonist CGP42112 at the agonistic concentration of 50 nM (92.1+/-2.7% vs. 99.8+/-3.1%; P=0.053). Procollagen Ialpha2 (COL1A2) mRNA levels were quantitated by (a) northern blot analysis and (b) reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. COL1A2/GAPDH (a) and COL1A2/beta-actin (b) ratios revealed no differences between AT2R-transduced fibroblasts and antisense controls when stimulated with Ang II (1 microM, 24 h) plus Irbesartan and 10 ng/ml transforming growth factor beta1. Ang II stimulation of the endogenous AT1R increased extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2 activities. This response was reduced by Irbesartan, but PD123319 had no effect. Time course and magnitude of Ang II stimulated ERK1/ERK2 activation was identical in AT2R-transduced and control cells. Also, neither simultaneous nor Ang II pre-stimulation, suggested to induce gene expression of the MAP kinase phosphatase 1, modulated phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated ERK1/ERK2 activation in AT2R-transduced pFib, in AT2R-transduced human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and in PC12W cells. By the use of a tyrosine phosphatase assay we observed an inhibition of phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity by 30.8% (P=0.009, n=5) after 5 min Ang II stimulation of AT2R-expressing pFib. Immunoprecipitation-tyrosine phosphatase assays revealed that inhibition of phosphotyrosine phosphatase 1B, which regulates insulin signaling, contributed to this effect. In conclusion, stimulation of the overexpressed human AT2R in porcine cardiac fibroblasts inhibited tyrosine phosphatase activity but had no significant effect on fibroblast functions related to cardiac fibrosis. It is conceivable that possible antifibrotic AT2R effects are species specific and/or require the interaction between fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes, probably via paracrine factors, or mechanical load.", 
    "171": "1. Basal whole-limb blood flow and vascular conductance decrease with age in men. We determined whether these age-associated changes in limb haemodynamics are mediated by tonically augmented sympathetic alpha-adrenergic vasoconstriction. 2. Seven young (28 +/- 2 years; mean +/- S.E.M.) and eight older (64 +/- 2 years) healthy, normotensive adult men were studied. Baseline femoral artery blood flow (Doppler ultrasound) and calculated vascular conductance were 29 and 31 % lower, respectively, and vascular resistance was 53 % higher in the older men (all P < 0.001). 3. Local (intra-femoral artery) alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade with phentolamine evoked greater increases in femoral blood flow (105 +/- 11 vs. 60 +/- 6 %) and vascular conductance (125 +/- 13 vs. 66 +/- 7 %), and reductions in vascular resistance (55 +/- 2 vs. 39 +/- 3 %) in the experimental limb of the older compared with the young men (all P < 0.001). As a result, alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade eliminated the significance of the age-associated differences in absolute levels of femoral blood flow (500 +/- 51 vs. 551 +/- 35 ml min(-1)), vascular conductance (6.02 +/- 0.73 vs. 6.33 +/- 0.26 U), and vascular resistance (0.17 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.16 +/- 0.01 U; P = 0.4-0.8, n.s.). Femoral haemodynamics in the control limb were unaffected by phentolamine administration in the contralateral (experimental) limb. Complete alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade was demonstrated by the absence of vasoconstriction in the experimental limb in response to the cold pressor test. Local propranolol was administered to control for any beta-adrenergic effects of phentolamine. Propranolol did not affect haemodynamics in the experimental or control limbs. 4. Our results indicate that the age-related reductions in basal limb blood flow and vascular conductance are mediated largely by chronically elevated sympathetic alpha-adrenergic vasoconstriction. This may have important physiological and pathophysiological implications for the ageing human.", 
    "172": "It is increasingly apparent that there is a bidirectional interaction between the maternal immune system and the reproductive system during pregnancy. Pregnancy is associated with a suppression of maternal specific immune responses, which process underlies the protection of fetal tissues expressing paternally inherited alloantigens. However, recent evidence indicates that the suppression of specific, lymphocyte-mediated immune responses during pregnancy is accompanied by activation of the non-specific arm of the maternal immune response. In the present study, we have investigated the effect of pregnancy on the non-specific immune response induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS, endotoxin) in mice. Pregnancy enhanced the LPS-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, and interferon-gamma. On the other hand, LPS-induced levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were suppressed in pregnant mice. These alterations in cytokine production correlated with an increased susceptibility for endotoxemic mortality in the pregnant mice. Although adrenergic receptors are important regulators of cytokine production in non-pregnant mice, the alpha(2)- and the beta-adrenoceptor-mediated modulation of cytokine production ceases to operate during pregnancy associated with severe endotoxemia. These data may explain how excessive activation of the non-specific immune responses during pregnancy can contribute to the increased severity of some maternal diseases, including septic shock, and can be an important pathophysiological factor in disseminated intravascular coagulation or preeclampsia.",

    "187": "Amyloid beta protein (AbetaP) is the major constituent of senile plaques associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, its mechanistic role in AD pathogenesis is poorly understood. Globular and nonfibrillar AbetaPs are continuously released during normal metabolism. Using techniques of atomic force microscopy, laser confocal microscopy, electrical recording, and biochemical assays, we have examined the molecular conformations of reconstituted globular AbetaPs as well as their real-time and acute effects on neuritic degeneration. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) of AbetaP1-42 shows globular structures that do not form fibers in physiological-buffered solution for up to 8 h of continuous imaging. AFM of AbetaP1-42 reconstituted in a planar lipid bilayer reveals multimeric channel-like structures. Consistent with these AFM resolved channel-like structures, biochemical analysis demonstrates that predominantly monomeric AbetaPs in solution form stable tetramers and hexamers after incorporation into lipid membranes. Electrophysiological recordings demonstrate the presence of multiple single channel currents of different sizes. At the cellular level, AbetaP1-42 allows calcium uptake and induces neuritic abnormality in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. At physiological nanomolar concentrations, rapid neuritic degeneration was observed within minutes; at micromolar concentrations, neuronal death was observed within 3-4 h. These effects are prevented by zinc (an AbetaP channel blocker) and by the removal of extracellular calcium, but are not prevented by antagonists of putative AbetaP cell surface receptors. Thus, AbetaP channels may provide a direct pathway for calcium-dependent AbetaP toxicity in AD.", 
    "188": "Until recently, use of beta-blockers was contraindicated in treatment of patients with congestive heart failure. However, empirical evidence suggests that adding beta-blockers to the standard therapy can slow the progression of heart failure and reduce mortality, including sudden cardiac death.", 
    "189": "To analyze the results of major, prospective, randomized controlled trials on the effects of beta-blockers in congestive heart failure and to provide recommendations for clinical practice and patients' education.", 
    "190": "MEDLINE (1989-2001) and biomedical databases (1995-2001) were searched for literature on the use of beta-blockers in patients with congestive heart failure. Information on major randomized controlled trials of at least 6 months' duration with mortality as a major end point were reviewed.", 
    "191": "Both selective and nonselective beta-blockers significantly reduce mortality due to all causes; decrease need for hospitalization due to cardiovascular causes; and improve patients' New York Heart Association functional classification, hemodynamic status, left ventricular ejection fraction, and signs and symptoms of congestive heartfailure. However, clinical use of beta-blockers remains limited.", 
    "192": "Strong empirical evidence supports adding beta-blockers to the standard therapy for congestive heart failure. Future efforts should be directed toward establishing the safety and efficacy of beta-blockers in patients with severe heartfailure.", 
    "193": "The objective of this study was to test bioequivalence and therapeutic equivalence of two oral formulations of pindolol (ViskenR = Vs = Ref.; Nonspi 5R = Np = Test). Twenty one healthy volunteers (11 females; 10 males; aged 18-55 years) participated in the single-dose (10 mg), single-blind, randomised crossover study. Blood samples were taken up to 24 hs after intake and pindolol in serum was determined using HPLC. Key criteria for ratio analysis to assess bioequivalence were log-transformed AUC (0, last) and Cmax. Blood pressure and heart rate vs. time data were subjected to ANOVA according to Friedman. Vital signs did not show significant differences. Ratios of log-transformed data and 90%-confidence intervals were within the predefined limits of 0.8 to 1.25 or 0.7 and 1.43, respectively. We conclude that both formulations of pindolol are equivalent with regard to extent and rate of absorption as well as pharmacodynamic effect.", 
    "194": "Cyclosporin-induced hypertension and endothelial dysfunction have been attributed to the effects of cyclosporin on factors controlling vasomotor tone. Endothelial nitric oxide (NO) regulates basal vasodilation, and an NO-mediated protective mechanism from cyclosporin-induced vasoconstriction has been proposed. In transplanted patients with cyclosporin-induced hypertension, we have recently demonstrated upregulation of the NO system and superoxide and free radical overproduction, which, by increasing NO metabolism, could induce hypertension, vascular remodeling and chronic rejection. In the present work, we have evaluated endothelial constitutive NO synthase (ecNOS), transforming growth factor beta and heme oxygenase-1 (protective against oxidative stress), mRNA production and plasma NO metabolites, peroxynitrite and antioxidant power in 15 kidney transplanted patients before and after 4 months of treatment with carvedilol alpha 1-beta-blocker and potent antioxidant. Our aim was to study the efficacy of the reduction of oxidative stress on complications such as endothelial dysfunction and fibrogenesis. Monocyte ecNOS and plasma NO metabolites remained higher versus those of control subjects and were unchanged by carvedilol, while antioxidant power and heme oxygenase-1 mRNA production increased. Peroxynitrite, as well as transforming growth factor beta mRNA, were reduced by carvedilol. It also normalized blood pressure. In conclusion, carvedilol reduces oxidative stress and normalizes blood pressure; ecNOS remains upregulated while mRNA for transforming growth factor beta, a key fibrogenic cytokine, is reduced by carvedilol, which seems to preserve protective mechanisms such as NO and heme oxygenase-1 against long-term complications of oxidative stress, e.g., endothelial dysfunction, fibrogenesis and chronic rejection.", 
    "195": "Because the number of patients who require hospitalization for heart failure is increasing, their treatment is often entrusted to physicians operating in Departments of General Medicine. Published data on the in-hospital treatment of heart failure in Italy have not been available up to now, as they are limited only to patients admitted to Department of Cardiology. This study concerns the patients who were discharged from our Hospital after a diagnosis of heart failure (International Classification of Disease--9th Edition, code 428) from January 1 to February 28, 1998. Information collected from patient hospital records included: age, sex, department to which the patient was referred (General Medicine or Cardiology), cause of heart failure, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, symptoms and signs of heart failure, therapy, length of hospitalization and in-hospital mortality. Of the 178 patients identified (82 males--46.1%, 96 females--53.9%, mean age 78 +/- 11 years) 163 (91.6%) were referred to Departments of General Medicine. The cause of heart failure was coronary artery disease in 88 (49.4%) patients, arterial hypertension in 40 (22.4%), primary cardiomyopathy in 28 (15.7%), valvular heart disease in 22 (12.3%). NYHA functional class was reported or deducible from the severity of dyspnea in 57 (32%) patients. In 8 (4.6%) patients symptoms or signs of heart failure were not reported. Chest X-ray was performed in 77.6% of cases, echocardiography in 41%, ambulatory electrocardiography in 10% and coronary arteriography in 5%. Left ventricular ejection fraction was known in 90 (51.6%) patients, in 44 (48.9%) of these it was > or = 45%. ACE-inhibitors were used in 99 (55.6%) patients, but this percentage rose to 63% when considering only patients with left ventricular ejection fraction < 45%. Eighty-five patients were treated with captopril or enalapril; in 52 patients (61.4%) the daily dose of captopril was < 75 mg and that of enalapril was < 20 mg. Diuretics were utilized in 155 (87%) patients, digoxin in 123 (69%), beta-blocker agents in 5 (2.8%) and other vasodilators in 95 (53%). The mean length of hospitalization was 13 +/- 9 days and the overall in-hospital mortality was 18%. In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate that the patients who are discharged from our hospital with a diagnosis of heart failure are, on the average, very old. The vast majority of these patients are admitted to the Departments of General Medicine. The advanced age of our patients can explain the limited use of ACE-inhibitors and, especially, of beta-blockers.", 
    "196": "Structure of the myocardium was studied in rabbits with renovascular hypertension during the development of myocardial hypertrophy and its regression under the effect of beta-adrenoceptor antagonist lopressor. Myocardial hypertrophy was associated with ultrastructural changes in cardiomyocytes, while lopressor therapy led to their regression and normalization of cardiomyocyte ultrastructure. Regression of hypertrophic changes was accompanied by a marked increase in the number of extracellular nuclei, which indicated enhanced apoptosis of cardiomyocytes.", 
    "197": "To examine the neuroprotective effect of the alpha(2)-adrenergic agonist brimonidine in a chronic ocular hypertension model.", 
    "198": "Intraocular pressure (IOP) was elevated by laser photocoagulation of episcleral and limbal veins. Retinal ganglion cell loss was evaluated in wholemounted retinas. Brimonidine or timolol was administered, either at the time of or 10 days after IOP elevation and continued for 3 weeks. Drug-related immunohistochemical changes in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were also determined after 3 weeks.", 
    "199": "Laser treatment caused a twofold IOP increase over baseline that was maintained for 2 months. A time-dependent loss of ganglion cells occurred with elevated IOP. Systemic administration of brimonidine or timolol caused little decrease in IOP. After 3 weeks of elevated IOP, ganglion cell loss in control rats was 33% +/- 3%. Brimonidine reduced the progressive loss of ganglion cells to 26% +/- 1% and 15% +/- 2% at doses of 0.5 and 1 mg/kg. d, respectively. Timolol had no effect. Ten days of high IOP resulted in 22% +/- 4% ganglion cell loss. Brimonidine administration initiated 10 days after IOP elevation prevented any further loss of ganglion cells. In vehicle- or timolol-treated rats, ganglion cell loss continued to 33%. The increase in immunoreactivity of GFAP in ocular hypertensive retinas was attenuated by brimonidine.", 
    "200": "Systemic application of brimonidine or timolol had little effect on IOP. Brimonidine, but not timolol, showed significant protection of retinal ganglion cells when applied at the time of IOP elevation and prevented further cell loss when applied after IOP was elevated. This indicates that brimonidine has a neuroprotective activity unrelated to its effect on ocular hypotension."
