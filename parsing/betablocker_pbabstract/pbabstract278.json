In this paper, it is demonstrated that novel in vitro test systems can be developed by using these genetically engineered cell lines for evaluating the potential risks associated with proprietary drugs (especially if their metabolism depends to a high extent on CYP 2D6). Moreover, it is demonstrated that, by the use of these in vitro methods, issues such as polymorphism, for which no animal models are available, can be assessed in such a way that predictions can be made on adverse effects which, up to now, could only be detected during clinical trials. Through the use of these new biotechnological in vitro metabolism models, clinically relevant data can be obtained for a scientifically-based human risk assessment, and animal use can be reduced.", 
    "1": "As QT variability increases and heart rate variability diminishes, the QT variability index (QTVI) - a non-invasive measure of beat-to-beat fluctuations in QT interval on a single ECG lead - shows a trend towards positive values. Increased QT variability is a risk factor for sudden death. Aging lengthens the QT interval and reduces RR-interval variability. In the present study we investigated the influence of aging and the autonomic nervous system on QT-interval variability in healthy subjects. We studied 143 healthy subjects, and divided them into two age ranges (younger and older than 65 years). For each subject we measured two QTVIs: from the q wave to the end of the T wave (QTeVI) and to the apex of the T wave (QTaVI). Both indexes were calculated at baseline and after sympathetic stress. In 10 non-elderly subjects, both QTVIs were determined after beta-adrenoreceptor blockade induced by intravenous infusion of propranolol or sotalol. The QTVI was higher in elderly than in younger subjects (P<0.001). QTVIs obtained during sympathetic stress remained unchanged in the elderly, but became more negative in the younger group (P<0.05). QTeVI and QTaVI at baseline were correlated positively with age (P<0.01) and anxiety scores (P<0.05), but inversely with the low-frequency spectral power of RR-interval variability (P<0.001). QTVIs were higher in subjects with higher anxiety scores. In younger subjects, sotalol infusion increased both QTVIs significantly, whereas propranolol infusion did not. In conclusion, aging increases QT-interval variability. Whether this change is associated with an increased risk of sudden death remains unclear. The association of abnormal QT-interval variability with anxiety and with reduced low-frequency spectral power of heart rate variability merits specific investigation. In healthy non-elderly subjects, acute sympathetic stress (tilt) decreases the QTVI. beta-Adrenoreceptor blockade inhibits this negative trend, thus showing its sympathetic origin. Because a negative trend in QTVI induced by sympathetic stress increases only in younger subjects, it could represent a protective mechanism that is lost with aging.", 
    "2": "This study examines the influence of aging on the neuronal nitric oxide (NO) and noradrenaline (NA) release elicited by electrical field stimulation (EFS; 200 mA, 0.3 ms, 1-16 Hz, 30 s) in endothelium-denuded mesenteric arteries from young and old rats, as well as the influence of the presynaptic beta-adrenoceptors in that release. EFS induced frequency-dependent contractions. N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) only enhanced EFS-elicited contractions in arteries from young rats. Capsaicin did not alter the EFS-induced contractions in either age group. Clenbuterol did not modify the contraction elicited by EFS in arteries from young or old rats either. A subsequent addition of l-NAME also induced an increase in the EFS-induced response in arteries from both age groups. In old rats, the presence of propranolol did not alter the response induced by EFS, and the subsequent addition of clenbuterol or clenbuterol plus l-NAME did not affect this response. In precontracted segments, sodium nitroprusside or clenbuterol induced similar relaxation in both age groups. None of the drugs used altered the response to exogenous NA or basal tone. In arteries preincubated with [(3)H]NA, EFS induced (3)H release, which remained unmodified in the presence of clenbuterol or propranolol in young rats, whereas clenbuterol increased the (3)H overflow in old rats, and this effect was abolished by propranolol. These drugs did not alter the basal (3)H efflux and indicate that in rat mesenteric arteries EFS induces NA release in both age groups, and only NO release in young animals. Activation of presynaptic beta-adrenoceptors increased NA and probably NO release in aged rats.",

    "11": "Each variceal bleed is associated with 20% to 30% risk of dying. Management of portal hypertension after a bleed consists of (1) control of bleeding and (2) prevention of rebleeding. Effective control of bleeding can be achieved either pharmacologically by administering somatostatin or octreotide or endoscopically via sclerotherapy or variceal band ligation. In practice, both pharmacologic and endoscopic therapy are used concomitantly. Rebleeding can be prevented by endoscopic obliteration of varices. In this setting, variceal ligation is the preferred endoscopic modality. B-blockade is as effective as endoscopic therapy and, in combination, the two modalities may be additive.", 
    "12": "Figure 3 shows an algorithm for the primary prevention of variceal hemorrhage. Pharmacologic therapy is the current standard of treatment for the primary prophylaxis of esophageal variceal bleeding. Patients with medium or large varices should be treated with a nonselective beta-blocker with the dose titrated to achieve a 25% decrement in resting heart rate or a heart rate of 55 to 60 bpm. The development of symptoms will, of course, limit the dose used. As discussed previously, these therapeutic endpoints are not well correlated with decreases in portal pressure. Measurement of the HVPG before therapy and after 3 months of therapy provides a rational approach to drug dosing. If the HVPG decreases by 20% or to less than 12 mm Hg, the medication dose will be effective in preventing hemorrhage. If, however, the HVPG is not appropriately lowered, a long-acting nitrate may be added. Patients with small varices should be observed, with endoscopic examinations every 2 years to assess progression of variceal size. Endoscopic therapy is not indicated for the primary prevention of variceal bleeding.",

Colonoscopy revealed multiple angiodysplasia-like lesions and mucosal friability throughout the entire colon (portal hypertensive colopathy, PHC). Haemostasis was immediately achieved with octreotide treatment, although melaena recurred after discontinuation of the infusion. Propranolol treatment before discontinuation of octreotide infusin prevented the recurrence of bleeding from PHC. Octreotide is a safe and effective treatment for severe acute bleeding from PHC, especially if the patient is not a candidate for transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) or treatment with a beta-blocker due to the severity of liver disease or haemodynamic instability. However, a sufficient reduction of portal pressure by propranolol or other medical treatment may be needed in order to discontinue octreotide infusion without the recurrence of bleeding.", 
    "14": "It is known that prolactin (PRL) is produced within the brain and numerous central actions of the hormone have been reported. In anesthetized lactating rats, central administration of PRL, i.e., intracerebroventricular (icv) or intrathecally (it), facilitated milk ejection (ME) by depressing the sympathetically mediated facilitatory tone of the mammary ductal system. However, it is not known whether or not the same effects and similar mechanisms take place in conscious rats after PRL administration. In the present study, the effects of centrally administered PRL, i.e., icv or it, on ME was determined in both conscious and anesthetized rats. In conscious rats, the rate of ME was determined by applying a 15-min period of suckling by the litter, following a 6-h period of isolation. In anesthetized rats, intramammary pressure (IMP) responses of the mammary glands to exogenous oxytocin (OT) were recorded. The results showed that, whereas in anesthetized rats, increased responsiveness of the mammary glands to OT were observed after PRL administration, an intense inhibition of ME occurred in conscious rats. Because, in conscious and anesthetized rats, these effects were prevented by prior administration of the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol (PROP) to the mothers, this suggests that the PRL effects on ME are modulated through sympathomimetic and sympatholytic actions in conscious and anesthetized rats, respectively. Thus, as shown by ductal tone measurements, in conscious, but not in anesthetized rats, the effect of PRL was associated with increased ductal constriction within the mammary glands; an effect that was mimicked by icv administration of the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (ISOP) and that was prevented by PROP. Further, the sympatholytic action of icv-PRL in anesthetized rats prevented the effect on ductal tone of both icv-PRL in conscious rats and of ISOP in anesthetized rats. Taken together, these results clearly suggest that the central effects of PRL on ME are modulated by adrenergic mechanisms.", 
    "15": "Previous work has shown that physiologic activation of the sympathetic system may inhibit milk yield (ME) in rats. Thus, adrenal catecholamines (CAs) are released by suckling, but it is not known whether such inhibition results also from reflex activation by the same stimulus of neural sympathetics upon the mammary gland. The present experiments were designed to determine whether suckling inhibits ME induced by oxytocin (OT) in the urethane-anesthetized lactating rat, and whether such inhibition results from adrenal and/or neurally released CAs. Rats were isolated (6 h) from their pups and then anesthetized. OT (0.8 mU every 2 min) was administered intravenously to the mothers during suckling. Rats were either chronically implanted with cannulae into the lateral cerebral ventricles (intracerebroventricularly), bilaterally adrenalectomized (ADX), hypophysectomized (HX), spinal cord transected (SCT: T3-T4), or had the nipple area (NA) locally anesthetized before suckling. MEs were low in control, sham, ADX and HX rats, but not in rats given the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol (PROP; intravenously or intracerebroventricularly injected), nor in SCT, NA or PROP-HX rats. As revealed by ductal resistance measurements as an indicator of ductal tone, suckling-induced inhibition of ME was due to ductal constriction within the mammary glands. These effects of suckling, however, could be prevented by prior activation of ductal mechanoreceptors. Together, these results indicate that suckling inhibits ME through the reflex activation of neurally mediated central beta-adrenergic mechanisms, and that these effects, in turn, can be regulated by ductal mechanoreceptor activation.", 
    "16": "Glial cell hyperpolarization previously has been reported to be induced by high frequency stimulation or glutamate. We now report that it also is produced by the glutamate-containing dipeptide N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG), by its non-hydrolyzable analog beta-NAAG, and by NAAG in the presence of 2-(phosphonomethyl)-pentanedioic acid (2-PMPA), a potent inhibitor of the NAAG degradative enzyme glutamate carboxypeptidase II. The results indicate that NAAG mimics the effect of nerve fiber stimulation on the glia. Although glutamate has a similar effect, the other presumed product of NAAG hydrolysis, N-acetylaspartate, is without effect on glial cell membrane potential, as is aspartylglutamate (in the presence of 2-PMPA). The hyperpolarization induced by stimulation, glutamate, NAAG, beta-NAAG, or NAAG plus 2-PMPA is completely blocked by the Group II metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonist (S)-alpha-ethylglutamate but is not altered by antagonists of Group I or III metabotropic glutamate receptors. The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist MK801 reduces but does not eliminate the hyperpolarization generated by glutamate, NAAG or stimulation. These results, in combination with those of the preceding paper, are consistent with the premise that NAAG could be the primary axon-to-glia signaling agent. When the unstimulated nerve fiber is treated with cysteate, a glutamate reuptake blocker, there is a small hyperpolarization of the glial cell that can be substantially reduced by pretreatment with 2-PMPA before addition of cysteate. A similar effect of cysteate is seen during a 50 Hz/5 s stimulation. From these results we suggest that glutamate derived from NAAG hydrolysis appears in the periaxonal space under the conditions of these experiments and may contribute to the glial hyperpolarization.", 
    "17": "This study was performed to evaluate, using a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled protocol, the long-term efficacy and safety of propafenone and sotalol in maintaining sinus rhythm after conversion of recurrent symptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF). The maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with recurrent AF has several potential benefits, the most important being a reduced risk of thromboembolic events. Three hundred patients with recurrent AF (> or = 4 episodes in the last year) and AF at enrollment lasting < 48 hours were randomized to receive either propafenone (mean daily dose 13 +/- 1.5 mg/kg; 102 patients), sotalol (mean daily dose 3 +/- 0.4 mg/kg; 106 patients), or placebo (92 patients). After 1-year follow-up, Kaplan-Meier estimates of the proportion of patients remaining in sinus rhythm were comparable between propafenone (63%) and sotalol (73%) and superior to placebo (35%; p = 0.001 vs both drugs). Symptomatic recurrences occurred later with propafenone and sotalol than with placebo. Nine patients (9%) in the propafenone group, 11 (10%) in the sotalol group, and 3 (3%) in the placebo group discontinued therapy due to adverse effects. Malignant nonfatal arrhythmias due to proarrhythmic effects were documented with sotalol only, and occurred < 72 hours from the beginning of therapy in 4 patients (4%). During recurrences, the ventricular rate was significantly reduced in patients taking propafenone and sotalol (p = 0.001 for both drugs vs placebo). The likelihood of remaining in sinus rhythm during follow-up was higher in younger patients with smaller left atrial size and without concomitant heart disease. In patients with recurrent symptomatic AF, propafenone and sotalol are not significantly different from each other and are superior to placebo in maintaining sinus rhythm at 1 year. Recurrences occur later and tend to be less symptomatic with propafenone and sotalol compared with placebo.",

Unfortunately, 2 of the studies were stopped in the interim stage, and so these trials may be somewhat underpowered for the estimation of the secondary endpoint, type of death. This endpoint is important, because if patients die for reasons other than progression of heart failure, e.g. arrhythmias, then alternative antiarrhythmic agents may serve equally well or better than beta-blockers and with fewer side effects.",

However, the risk reduction of death due to progression to heart failure was small (13%) and statistically non-significant, indicating that progression of heart failure, as estimated by numbers of deaths, was not beneficially influenced by the beta-blocker therapy. Finally, the risk of serious adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment with beta-blockers, was not significantly different from that for placebo.",

    "25": "In the present study we investigated the cross talk between the Ca2+ mobilization pathway and the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway and contraction in the cat iris sphincter smooth muscle. Three Ca2+-mobilizing agonists, namely, prostaglandin F2alpha (PGF2alpha), ionomycin, and thapsigargin, and three specific inhibitors, PD98059, a p42/p44 MAP kinase inhibitor; KN-93, a Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) blocker; and isoproterenol, a cAMP-elevating agent, were used. Changes in tension in response to the agonists were recorded isometrically and MAP kinase phosphorylation and activation were monitored by Western blotting and by in situ myelin basic protein phosphorylation, respectively. We found that 1) stimulation of the sphincter muscle with PGF2alpha, ionomycin, or thapsigargin resulted in rapid phosphorylation and activation of p42/p44 MAP kinase and contraction; and 2) treatment of the muscles with PD98059, KN-93, or isoproterenol resulted in inhibition of the Ca2+-mobilizing agonist-induced responses. The contractile responses induced by PGF2alpha, ionomycin, and thapsigargin were (mg of tension/mg of wet weight tissue) 15.2, 15.4, and 16.2, respectively; the increases in MAP kinase phosphorylation by these agonists were 228, 203, and 190%, respectively; and the increases in MAP kinase activation by the agonists were 212, 191, and 162%, respectively. The stimulatory effects of the agonists on contraction and on MAP kinase phosphorylation and activation were blocked by preincubation of the muscle with PD98059, KN-93, or isoproterenol. These data demonstrate that in the iris sphincter phosphorylation and activation of p42/p44 MAP kinases by PGF2alpha, ionomycin, or thapsigargin require intracellular Ca2+ either from extracellular sources or from internal stores, that CaMKII plays an important role in the regulation of contraction, that CaMKII acts upstream of MAP kinase to control its activation, and that the MAP kinase signaling pathway can play a significant role in mediating the cellular effects of these Ca2+-mobilizing agonists.",

    "37": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the commonest arrhythmia. It presents in distinct patterns of paroxysmal, persistent and chronic AF, and patient management aims differ according to the pattern. In paroxysmal AF, drug treatment with beta-blockers, class Ic and class III agents reduce the frequency and duration of episodes. In persistent AF (recent onset, non-paroxysmal), early cardioversion with either pharmacological agents or by direct current (DC) cardioversion should be actively considered, in those patients who are suitable. Patients most likely to cardiovert and remain in sinus rhythm include those with duration of AF of <1 year, an acute reversible cause, left atrial diameter <50 mm and good left ventricular function on echocardiography. Recent data show that maintenance of sinus rhythm after successful cardioversion is enhanced by the use of class III drugs including amiodarone and dofetilide. In chronic or permanent AF, management is aimed at controlling the ventricular rate response with combinations of digoxin, beta-blockers and calcium antagonists with atrio-ventricular nodal activity (diltiazem and verapamil). There is some debate about the prognostic significance of AF. Certainly AF is associated with an excess mortality but this is largely accounted for by its association with serious intrinsic heart disease and the thrombo-embolic complications of the arrhythmia. Atrial fibrillation is a common default arrhythmia for the sick heart.",

Beta-adrenoceptor agonists inhibited ICYP binding with an order of potency: (-)-isoprenaline >(-)-adrenaline >(-)-noradrenaline; the same order of potency was obtained for agonist-induced stimulation of lymphocyte cyclic AMP content. The selective beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118,551 was about 1000 times more potent in inhibiting ICYP binding than was the beta1-selective adrenoceptor antagonist CGP 20712A. It is, therefore, concluded that in intact equine lymphocytes, ICYP labels a class of functional beta-adrenoceptors that belong predominantly (>90%) to the beta2-adrenoceptor subtype; a small (<10%) beta1-adrenoceptor component, however, cannot be ruled out completely. ICYP binding to equine lymphocytes might be a suitable model to study function and regulation of the beta-adrenoceptor system in the horse in vivo. The aim of this study was to characterise the beta-adrenoreceptor subtypes present on equine lymphocytes.", 
    "43": "We have reported that acute restraint stress inhibits small intestinal motility in rats. In order to clarify this inhibitory mechanism, we examined the effects of alpha- and beta-adrenergic antagonists on the inhibition of small intestinal motility induced by restraint stress. This inhibition underwent recovery by propranolol (beta1/beta2-antagonist) or SR59230A (beta3-antagonist), but not by atenolol (beta1-antagonist), ICI-118,551 (beta2-antagonist), prazosin (alpha1-antagonist) or yohimbine (alpha2-antagonist). These results suggest that beta3-adrenoceptors play an important role in the inhibition of small intestinal motility caused by restraint stress.", 
    "44": "Repetitive administration of propranolol (PL) in rats decreases the activities of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D enzyme(s) in hepatic microsomes. We examined the properties of 4-hydroxypropranolol (4-OH-PL) as an inactivator of rat liver microsomal CYP2D enzyme(s) using bunitrolol (BTL) 4-hydroxylation and PL 5- and 7-hydroxylations as indices of CYP2D enzyme activity. Rat microsomal BTL 4-hydroxylase activity was inhibited by the addition of 4-OH-PL to the incubation medium. The inhibition was greater after preincubation of microsomes with 4-OH-PL in the presence of NADPH than in its absence. The type of inhibition kinetics of BTL 4-hydroxylase by 4-OH-PL was changed from a competitive type to a noncompetitive type by the preincubation. The inhibition of rat liver microsomal PL 5- and 7-hydroxylases by 4-OH-PL was blocked efficiently by co-incubation with quinine, a typical inhibitor of rat CYP2D enzyme(s), or to a lesser extent by BTL. However, quinidine, a diastereomer of quinine, did not significantly protect against the enzyme inactivation. The protective capacities of the substrate and inhibitors reflected their affinities for rat CYP2D enzyme(s). BTL hydroxylase was not affected by either 1,4-naphthoquinone or 1,4-dihydroxynaphthalene which are possible metabolites of 4-OH-PL. These results provide further evidence to support the notion that PL is biotransformed by rat CYP2D enzyme(s) to 4-OH-PL, which is further oxidized to a chemically reactive metabolite in the active site. The inactivation of CYP is likely the result of covalent binding of the reactive species to an amino acid residue of the active site.", 
    "45": "The adrenoactivity of the mast cells (MC) in the albino rats mediastinal pleura was studied during the experiment with the use of the pharmacological preparations of adrenergic effect in vivo and in vitro. While injecting adrenolytics and adrenomimetics presence of heparin and biogenic monoamines (catecholamines and serotonin) was observed. Adrenomimetic substances in vivo and in vitro were observed to intensify the synthetic process, decrease degranulation, concentrate the density of heparin granules and increase the number of biogenic monoamines while adrenolytic substances were noticed to produce contrary effect.", 
    "46": "We examined the regulatory role of cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)) and phosphatidylinositol (PI)-specific phospholipase C (PLC) in the degranulation of human eosinophils and leukotriene (LT) C(4) synthesis. Activation with formyl-Met-Leu-Phe + cytochalasin B (fMLP/B) caused a time-dependent release of eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) and LTC(4), which was inhibited by pertussis toxin. By immunoblotting, eosinophil PLC-beta2 and -gamma2 isoforms were identified, and PLC activation was measured as a function of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate concentration. Stimulated release of EPO and intracellular Ca(2+) concentration was inhibited by ET-18-OCH(3), a PI-PLC inhibitor, whereas trifluoromethylketone (TFMK), a cPLA(2) blocker, had no inhibitory effect. Both TFMK and ET-18-OCH(3) attenuated stimulated arachidonate release and LTC(4) secretion, suggesting that activation of both PLC and cPLA(2) is essential for LTC(4) synthesis caused by fMLP/B. The structurally unrelated protein kinase C inhibitors bisindolylmaleimide, Ro-31-8220, and Go-6976 all blocked fMLP/B-induced EPO release but not LTC(4) secretion. 1,2-bis(2-Aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'- tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester, an intracellular Ca(2+) chelator, suppressed both EPO release and LTC(4) secretion. We found that fMLP/B-induced LTC(4) secretion from human eosinophils is regulated by PI-PLC through calcium-mediated activation of cPLA(2). However, cPLA(2) does not regulate eosinophil degranulation.", 
    "47": "This study examined the transduction pathways activated by epinephrine in the pacemaker region of the toad heart. Recordings of membrane potential, force, and intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) were made from arrested toad sinus venosus. Sympathetic nerve stimulation activated non-alpha-, non-beta-adrenoceptors to evoke a membrane depolarization and a transient increase in [Ca(2+)](i). In contrast, the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline (10 microM) caused membrane hyperpolarization and decreased [Ca(2+)](i). The phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (0.5 mM) mimicked the isoprenaline-evoked membrane hyperpolarization. Epinephrine (10-50 microM) caused an initial membrane depolarization and an increase in [Ca(2+)](i) followed by membrane hyperpolarization and decreased [Ca(2+)](i). The membrane depolarizations evoked by sympathetic nerve stimulation or epinephrine were abolished either by the phospholipase C inhibitor U-73122 (20 microM) or by the blocker of D-myo-inositol 1,4,5,-trisphosphate-induced Ca(2+) release, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB, 60 microM). Neither U-73122 nor 2-APB had an affect on the membrane hyperpolarization evoked by beta-adrenoceptor activation. These results suggest that in the toad sinus venosus, two distinct transduction pathways can be activated by epinephrine to cause an increase in heart rate.",

The aim of this study was to examine how carvedilol regulates reactive-oxygen-species-mediated signaling and decreases red blood cell membrane damage in heart perfusion and in a rheological model.", 
    "49": "The ischemia-reperfusion-induced oxidative cell damage, and changes in the intracellular signaling mediated by reactive oxygen species and peroxynitrite were studied on rat hearts in a Langendorff perfusion system (n=15). The effect of carvedilol on red blood cell suspension viscosity (hematocrit: 60%) incubated with free radical generator (phenazine methosulphate) was also investigated (n=10). The measurements were performed on a capillary viscosimeter.", 
    "50": "In both studies a protective effect of carvedilol was found, as the decrease of red blood cell suspension viscosity and K(+) concentration in the supernatant indicated. Carvedilol significantly decreased the ischemia-reperfusion-induced free radical production and the NAD(+) catabolism and reversed the poly- and mono(ADP-ribosyl)ation. Carvedilol also decreased the lipid peroxidation and membrane damages as determined by free malondialdehyde production and the release of intracellular enzymes. The self ADP-ribosylation of isolated poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase was also significantly inhibited by carvedilol.", 
    "51": "Our results show that carvedilol can modulate the reactive-oxygen-species-induced signaling through poly- and mono(ADP-ribosyl)ation reactions, the NAD(+) catabolism in postischemic perfused hearts and has a marked scavenger effect on free radical generator-induced red blood cell membrane damage. All these findings may play an important role in the beneficial effects of carvedilol treatment in different cardiovascular diseases.", 
    "52": "Cytochrome P450 (P450) 2D6 is a polymorphic human enzyme involved in the oxidation of >50 drugs, most of which contain a basic nitrogen. In confirmation of previous work by others, substitutions at Asp301 decreased rates of substrate oxidation by P450 2D6. An anionic residue (Asp, Glu) at this position was found to be important in proper protein folding and heme incorporation, and positively charged residues were particularly disruptive in bacterial and also in baculovirus expression systems. Truncation of 20 N-terminal amino acids had no significant effect on catalytic activity except to attenuate P450 2D6 interaction with membranes and NADPH-P450 reductase. The truncation of the N-terminus increased the level of bacterial expression of wild-type P450 2D6 (Asp301) but markedly reduced expression of all codon 301 mutants, including Glu301. Reduction of ferric P450 2D6 by NADPH-P450 reductase was enhanced in the presence of the prototypic substrate bufuralol. Bacterial flavodoxin, an NADPH-P450 reductase homolog, binds tightly to P450 2D6 but is inefficient in electron transfer to the heme. These results collectively indicate that the acidic residue at position 301 in P450 2D6 has a structural role in addition to any in substrate binding and that the N-terminus of P450 2D6 is relatively unimportant to catalytic activity beyond a role in facilitating binding to NADPH-P450 reductase.", 
    "53": "The aim of this work was to study which genes upregulated by the IFN-gamma/STAT1 system in human muscle might be involved in the process of muscle fiber atrophy in dermatomyositis (DM). These proteins included proteases (cathepsins B and L, calpain), proteins implicated in apoptosis and cell cycle (Bcl-x(l), Fas, p21), structural proteins (beta-actin, utrophin, desmin), and other proteins whose expression is known to be modified by IFN-gamma (neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM), major histocompatibility complex-I (MHC-I)). We performed immunocytochemistry, Western blot, and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using human muscle cultures. We found upregulation of cathepsins B and L, bcl-x(l) and p21 while N-CAM, calpain, utrophin, desmin, beta-actin and Fas remained at basal levels. Immunohistochemistry on frozen sections from biopsies of patients with different muscle diseases showed upregulation of cathepsin L and calpain in perifascicular muscle fibers in DM. In view of these results, the increased expression of cathepsins L and B after IFN-gamma stimulation in muscle cultures and its inhibition using fludarabine, a STAT1 blocker, further support our previous studies and suggest that the increased expression of cathepsins detected in perifascicular muscle fibers in DM is mediated by IFN-gamma/STAT1 and contributes to their atrophy.",

    "55": "Some patients with advanced thyrotoxicosis have occult cardiac dysfunction. The use of long-acting beta-blockers, traditional in the management of thyrotoxicosis, may have disastrous consequences in this setting. The following report documents the cardiovascular collapse and asystolic arrest of a patient with hyperthyroidism when treated with sotolol. Though the patient was successfully resuscitated, the long duration of action of sotolol necessitated prolonged inotropic and vasopressor support. A shorter acting beta-blocker, such as esmolol, theoretically may be a safer option.", 
    "56": "The mode of action of estrogen on beta-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxation was investigated by using isolated ring preparations of thoracic aorta from ovariectomized rats. Administration of 17beta-estradiol to ovariectomized rats significantly suppressed isoprenaline-induced relaxation of aortic rings. There was no alteration in the beta-adrenoceptor binding characteristics. The suppressing action of 17beta-estradiol on the N(G)-nitro-L-arginine and indomethacin-resistant relaxation induced by isoprenaline disappeared after pretreatment with N,N-diethylaminoethyl-2,2-diphenylvalerate hydrochloride (SKF 525A), an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP). The levels of CYP2C11 expression were the highest of the CYP mRNAs examined in rat aorta. 17beta-Estradiol replacement increased the expression of CYP2C11 mRNA in the aorta, compared with that in ovariectomized rats. These results suggest that estrogen suppresses beta-adrenoceptor-mediated vasorelaxation, and that the mechanisms may be associated with alterations in CYP2C11 metabolites.", 
    "57": "1. Thiazolidinedione-derived agents have been reported to act as insulin sensitizers by augmenting insulin-dependent stimulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activity in a specific manner. It has been suggested that alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation mediates glucose uptake through PI3K in the heart. 2. To elucidate whether the thiazolidinedione-derived agent troglitazone (TRO) affects glucose uptake induced by alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation through PI3K, the rate of glucose uptake was quantified from the rate of accumulation of sugar phosphate (d[SP]/dt) using [(31)P] nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy after substitution of glucose with 2-deoxyglucose in rat perfused heart. Hearts were stimulated with 100 micromol/L phenylephrine plus 10 micromol/L propranolol (alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation), or 1 micromol/L isoproterenol plus 10 micromol/L phentolamine (beta-adrenoceptor stimulation). 3. The d[SP]/dt in the alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor-stimulated groups (0.45 +/- 0.06 and 0.42 +/- 0.04 micromol/min per g, respectively) was higher than that of the control group (0.27 +/- 0.02 micromol/min per g; P < 0.01). The addition of 2 microg/mL troglitazone to alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation augmented d[SP]/dt (0.72 +/- 0.08 micromol/min per g; P < 0.05 vs the alpha-adrenoceptor-stimulated group), which was effectively blocked by 3 micromol/L wortmannin (0.35 +/- 0.06 micromol/min per g; P < 0.01 vs troglitazone + alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation group). However, addition of troglitazone to beta-adrenoceptor stimulation did not alter d[SP]/dt (0.33 +/- 0.02 micromol/min per g; P = NS vs the beta-adrenoceptor-stimulated group). 4. These results indicate that troglitazone acutely enhances alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation on glucose uptake through a PI3K-dependent pathway, thus possibly improving glucose utilization in a catecholamine-released state.", 
    "58": "1. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of the metalloendopeptidase (EP) 24.15 and 24.16 inhibitor N-[1-(R,S)-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-Ala-Aib-Tyr-p-aminobenzoate (JA-2) on haemodynamics and renal function in conscious rabbits with two-kidney, two-wrapped hypertension. We have also examined the role of endogenous bradykinin in the maintenance phase of this form of renovascular hypertension and whether inhibition of bradykinin degradation contributes to any potential effects of JA-2. 2. In two preliminary operations, rabbits were equipped with transit-time ultrasound flow probes for measuring cardiac output (CO) and renal blood flow (RBF) and had both kidneys wrapped in cellophane. Starting 4 weeks after the last operation, rabbits underwent four studies (3-5 days apart), during which they were treated with combinations of the bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist icatibant or its vehicle (1 mL/kg bodyweight 0.9% w/v NaCl) and JA-2 or its vehicle (1 mL/kg of a 5% w/v 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin, 2.5% v/v dimethylsulphoxide solution). Renal function was monitored using standard renal clearance methods. 3. Icatibant (10 microg/kg) had no significant effects on systemic haemodynamic variables (mean arterial pressure, heart rate or CO), renal haemodynamic variables (RBF or glomerular filtration rate), urine flow or sodium excretion. At 5 mg/kg plus 3 mg/kg per h, JA-2 also did not affect any of these variables, either after icatibant vehicle treatment or after icatibant treatment. 4. Our data do not support major roles for endogenous bradykinin or bradykinin degradation by EP 24.15/24.16 in the control of systemic and renal haemodynamics or renal excretory function in two-kidney, two-wrapped hypertension in rabbits.", 
    "59": "The highly active chemotherapeutic agents doxorubicin, duanorubicin, idarubicin, epirubicin, and mitoxantrone are also associated with acute, largely reversible cardiotoxic effects and a dose-related cardiomyopathy. This cardiomyopathy is characterized by minimal left ventricular enlargement and global systolic dysfunction, usually with associated mild to moderate mitral insufficiency. Historically, this was characterized by myocardial biopsy and radionuclide angiography. More recently, echocardiography has become the most widely available and cost-efficient tool for diagnosis. The precise mechanism of this toxicity has not been fully defined. However, the maximum tolerated cumulative dose can by increased by reducing peak drug levels and concurrent administration of the iron chelator, dexrazoxane. Because anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy is largely irreversible and cumulative, prevention is the preferred strategy. Monitoring by assessment of left ventricular function by the most reproducible method available as patients approach potentially toxic doses can substantially reduce toxicity. Stress studies before major procedures such as bone marrow or stem cell transplants may be of benefit. This syndrome responds well to conventional therapy for congestive heart failure with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, digoxin, and diuretics. The beta-blocker carvedilol is often associated with significant improvement in ejection fraction and symptoms and spironolactone is well tolerated and often of benefit. The long-term outlook of the syndrome is much better than previously reported because of advances in therapy and prevention.", 
    "60": "A new glucagon-like peptide was isolated from the intestine of the eel Anguilla japonica. The primary structure was determined by sequence analysis after cleavage with lysyl endopeptidase, quantitative amino acid analysis and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry as HSQGTFTNDY(10)SKYLETRRAQ(20)DFVQWLMNSK(30)RSGGPT. Since its structure is similar to that of oxyntomodulins (OXMs) reported in various vertebrates, we named this peptide eel oxyntomodulin (eOXM). We found that eOXM enhanced the contractile force and the beating rate of the eel atrium in a dose-dependent manner. These effects of eOXM were not inhibited by betaxolol, a beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, indicating that the actions of eOXM were independent of those of adrenaline. eOXM enhanced the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration of the myocardium. The contractility of the eel atrium was greatly reduced after omitting Ca(2+) from the bathing medium or after treatment with verapamil, a Ca(2+) channel blocker. After inhibiting Ca(2+) entry under these conditions, the inotropic effect of eOXM was markedly reduced, but the chronotropic effect was not altered significantly. These results indicate that the inotropic effect of eOXM is via a stimulation of Ca(2+) influx but that the chronotropic effect may be independent of extracellular Ca(2+).", 
    "61": "Meta-analysis has become a very popular tool to compare the efficacy of different antihypertensive regimens. Combining results from various outcome studies may provide evidence to guide the therapeutic approach even before results from large prospective studies are available. However, meta-analysis may be misleading if it is not done meticulously. Some meta-analyses that received broad news media coverage in the recent years were misleading. One analysis suggested that the use of short-acting nifedipine in moderate to high doses in patients with coronary disease increased mortality. This claim was refuted later by observational studies. Based on another meta-analysis, it was claimed that diuretics and beta-blockers are equally effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Another more careful meta-analysis, omitting one study in which most patients were on combination therapy and not on beta-blocker monotherapy, showed the superiority of diuretic versus b-blocker treatment in the elderly. Calcium antagonists were recently blamed for increasing the rate of myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure in hypertensive patients, and therefore their use was not recommended as first-line therapy in hypertension. This recommendation was based on a meta-analysis subject to major drawbacks and was misleading. Another notion based on meta-analysis was that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors reduce left ventricular mass more than diuretics. This notion was refuted by three large randomized studies. A recent meta-analysis, which showed a similar blood pressure lowering effect for all angiotensin receptor blockers, was refuted by head-to-head studies. Thus, when performed correctly, meta-analysis can be an important tool, but when uncritically employed, it is prone to be misleading.",

In the present follow-up study we determined the respective effects of age, habitual exercise status, and sex on this regulatory mechanism. Resting metabolic rate (ventilated hood, indirect calorimetry) was determined in 55 healthy sedentary or endurance exercise-trained adults, aged 18-35 or 60-75 yr (29 men and 26 women), before (baseline) and during the infusion of either a nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist (propranolol) or saline (control). Relative to baseline values, during beta-adrenergic receptor antagonism resting metabolic rate adjusted for fat-free mass was reduced to a lesser extent in older (mean +/- SE, -130 +/- 46 kJ/d) compared with young (-297 +/- 46) adults, sedentary (-151 +/- 50) compared with endurance exercise-trained (-268 +/- 46) adults, and women (-105 +/- 33) compared with men (-318 +/- 50; all P < 0.01). Reductions in resting metabolic rate during beta-adrenergic receptor antagonism were positively related to higher baseline resting metabolic rate and plasma catecholamine concentrations and negatively related to adiposity (all P < 0.05). Resting metabolic rate was unchanged in response to saline control in all groups. These results provide experimental support for the hypothesis that aging, sedentary living, and female sex are associated with attenuated sympathetic nervous system support of resting metabolic rate in healthy adult humans.",

Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous inhibitor of NO synthase, is synthesized by many types of cells including vascular endothelial cells. The serum level of ADMA is elevated in patients with essential hypertension, but the mechanism for this increase is unknown. Therefore, the present study examined whether the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is involved. Patients with essential hypertension [systolic blood pressure (BP) > 160 mmHg and/or diastolic BP > 95 mmHg] were randomized to an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment group (perindopril, 4mg/day for 4 weeks, n = 7), an angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist treatment group (losartan, 50 mg/day for 4 weeks, n = 7) or a beta-blocker treatment group (bisoprolol, 5 mg/day for 4 weeks, n = 7). Before and after the treatment, BP, serum concentration of ADMA and plasma concentration of von Willebrand factor (vWF, a biological marker of endothelial injury) were measured. Perindopril, losartan and bisoprolol decreased BP to a similar extent, and either perindopril or losartan, but not bisoprolol, significantly decreased serum ADMA and plasma vWF. These findings suggest that the RAS may contribute to the mechanism of increased serum ADMA as well as to the endothelial injury observed in hypertensive patients. The vasculoprotective actions of ACE inhibitors or AT1 receptor antagonists may be explained at least in part by amelioration of the endothelial injury through a decrease in the serum ADMA concentration.",

The initial dose of nadolol was 80 mg orally once daily, with adjustment according to the resting heart rate; isosorbide mononitrate was given in increasing doses, beginning at 20 mg once a day at bed time and rising over the course of one week to 40 mg orally twice a day, unless side effects occurred. The primary end points were recurrent bleeding, complications, and death.", 
    "81": "The median follow-up period was 21 months. A total of 35 patients in the ligation group and 24 in the medication group had recurrent bleeding. The probability of recurrence was lower in the medication group, both for all episodes related to portal hypertension (P=0.04) and for recurrent variceal bleeding (P=0.04). There were major complications in nine patients treated with ligation (seven had bleeding esophageal ulcers and two had aspiration pneumonia) and two treated with medication (both had bradycardia and dyspnea) (P=0.05). Thirty patients in the ligation group died, as did 23 patients in the medication group (P=0.52). The probability of recurrent bleeding was lower for patients with a hemodynamic response to therapy, defined as a decrease in the hepatic venous pressure gradient of more than 20 percent from the base-line value or to less than 12 mm Hg (18 percent, vs. 54 percent in patients with no hemodynamic response at one year; P<0.001), and the probability of survival was higher (94 percent vs. 78 percent at one year, P=0.02).",

    "83": "Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) is a clinically recognisable contiguous gene syndrome ascribed to interstitial deletions of chromosome 17p11.2. Patients have a phase shift of their circadian rhythm of melatonin with a paradoxical diurnal secretion of the hormone. Serum melatonin levels and day-night behaviour were studied in nine SMS children (aged 4 to 17 years) given acebutolol, a selective beta(1)-adrenergic antagonist (10 mg/kg early in the morning). Cardiac examination, serum melatonin, motor activity recordings, and sleep diaries were monitored before and after drug administration. The present study shows that a single morning dose of acebutolol suppressed the inappropriate secretion of melatonin in SMS. A significant improvement of inappropriate behaviour with increased concentration, delayed sleep onset, increased hours of sleep, and delayed waking were also noted. These results suggest that beta(1)-adrenergic antagonists help to manage hyperactivity, enhance cognitive performance, and reduce sleep disorders in SMS.", 
    "84": "To examine the effect of exercise and adrenergic blockade on lymphocyte cytokine production, six men ingested either a placebo (control) or an alpha- (prazosin hydrochloride) and beta-adrenoceptor antagonist (timolol malate) capsule (blockade, or BLK) 2 h before performing 19 +/- 1 min of supine bicycle exercise at 78 +/- 3% peak pulmonary uptake. Blood was collected before and after exercise, stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin, and surface stained for T (CD3(+)) and natural killer [NK (CD3(-)CD56(+))] lymphocyte surface antigens. Cells were permeabilized, stained for the intracellular cytokines interleukin (IL)-2 and interferon (IFN)-gamma, and analyzed using flow cytometry. BLK had no effect on the resting concentration of stimulated cytokine-positive T and NK lymphocytes or the amount of cytokine they were producing. Exercise resulted in an increase (P < 0.05) in the concentration of stimulated T and NK lymphocytes producing cytokines in the circulation, but these cells produced less (P < 0.05) cytokine post- compared with preexercise. BLK attenuated (P < 0.05) the elevation in the concentration of lymphocytes producing cytokines during exercise; however, BLK did not affect the amount of IL-2 and IFN-gamma produced. These results suggest that adrenergic stimulation contributes to the exercise-induced increase in the concentration of lymphocytes in the circulation; however, it does not appear to be responsible for the exercise-induced suppression in cytokine production.",

In addition, the treatment influenced the cardiac baroreflex by decreasing the bradycardic plateau and increasing both bradycardic and tachycardic range. The baroreflex gain increased in a dose-dependent manner by 41.6 +/- 12.1 and 103.0 +/- 3.9%, respectively. These data indicate that moxonidine can modulate the cardiac autonomic (tonic and reflex) chronotropic control.",

    "90": "Alloxan has been widely used to provoke diabetes mellitus. This compound induces necrosis of the beta-pancreatic cells and the renal tubules. However, the mechanism of this action has not been fully established. There is some evidence that this drug may act by an alteration of several ionic transport mechanisms. Nevertheless, there is scant information on the effect of alloxan on these ionic transport mechanisms of the membrane in epithelial cells. We reported that this drug induces a decrease in sodium transport in the frog skin. In order to obtain information about the mechanism involved in the sodium transport diminution provoked by alloxan, in this study the function of Na+-K+ ATPase enzyme on transepithelial sodium transport altered by alloxan is explored. We measured changes in the short circuit current and in the intracellular content of sodium and potassium under conditions of maximally stimulated enzyme activity. Short circuit current was not modified by the treatment with alloxan during the period of highest activity of the enzyme, suggesting a site of action independent of this ATPase. Cell potassium was reduced in alloxan-treated epithelia, without significant changes in Na+ content. This finding points out the existence of an alteration induced by alloxan of some modulator mechanisms of the intracellular K+ concentration. The treatment of the frog skin with cesium chloride, a K+ channel blocker, prevented the decrease of Na+ transport produced by alloxan. This result suggests an action of this diabetogenic drug on the K+ channels of the frog skin epithelium.",

    "93": "5-HTTLPR short variant was associated with a poor response to fluvoxamine treatment, independently from the recorded clinical variables. More specifically, the diagnosis, the presence of psychotic features, and the severity of depressive symptomatology did not influence this association.

    "95": "n 1987 the results of the Consensus study were published, and showed that enalapril, an angiotensin convertor enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), was able to modify the clinical course of the heart failure syndrome thereby reducing mortality. Other ACEI later demonstrated the same effect on the different degrees of symptomatic heart failure, left ventricular dysfunction, myocardial infarction and more recently in diabetic patients. In 1996 studies on the betablockers carvedilol, bisoprolol and metoprolol showed their efficacy in reducing deaths due to progressive heart impairment and sudden death in chronic heart failure. The RALES study showed that small doses of spironolactone also improved the prognosis on this disease. Digital improves the quality of life but not the survival rate. Only amiodarone (among the antiarrhythmics) reduces sudden death. Other drugs and groups of drugs can not be considered for chronic outpatient treatment of heart failure. Multicenter trials make it possible to obtain scientific evidence for establishing rational treatments. Many groups of patients such as women, elderly people and the more severe cases of the disease are often not included in these trials. Occasionally, multicenter trials are badly designed (CIBIS and MCD), which in the case of betablockers, led to a substantial delay in their administration. Other times, as in the ELITE study, the results were badly interpreted. The knowledge obtained from these studies is slow in reaching patients, with few patients taking betablockers. It is known that most patients do not take the doses found to be effective in multicenter trials.",

After a control exercise test the animals were devided into three groups implanted s.c. with: 1) adrenaline; 2) propranolol and 3) regitine tablets. Twelve hours after the tablet implantation the exercise was repeated. Both before the exercise test and at the end of each 2-min loads blood lactate [LA] was measured to evaluate T(LA).", 
    "98": "Prolonged adrenaline excess resulted in reduced maximal running speed and shifted T(LA) towards lower exercise intensities than in the control test. Both alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade reduced the work load at which T(LA) occurred, without changing the maximum running speed and maximal blood LA concentration. Blood [LA] at the lactate threshold ([LA] at T(LA)) was significantly higher in hyperadrenalinemic than in control rats, whilst under beta-blockade it was lowered in comparison with control values. Alpha-adrenergic blockade had no effect on [LA] at T(LA), but at the higher exercise intensities blood [LA] exceeded the respective control values.",

He subsequently illustrates the effects of ACE-inhibitors, differentiating them from AT1-receptors. The anti-hypertensive actions of new b-blockers, like Carvedilol and Nebivolol are also explained.

Finally, the anti-calcinotic effect and anti-embolic action of calcium-antagonist drugs are also underlined.", 
    "101": "1. Intravenous administration of 20-60 % glucose, 3.2-9.7 % NaCl or 20 % mannitol solutions (1.66 ml kg(-1)) for 5 min increased oxygen consumption in urethane-anaesthetized rats, whereas administration of physiological saline had no effect. Administration of 7.7-18.3 % urea slightly increased the oxygen consumption, but the increase was significantly smaller than that measured after the administration of other hypertonic solutions. The magnitude of the thermogenic effect correlated with the osmolality of the applied solutions. These results suggest that the thermogenesis was caused mainly by changes in osmolality rather than by a specific action of the different solute molecules. 2. Neither pretreatment with the ganglion blocker hexamethonium (20 mg kg(-1), I.P.) or the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (10 mg kg(-1), I.P.), nor bilateral cervical vagotomy or bilateral adrenalectomy had any effect on the osmotically induced thermogenesis. Therefore, the autonomic nervous system and the adrenal gland were not involved in this metabolic response. 3. In response to osmotic stimulation, the temperature of the skeletal muscle increased significantly, whereas that of brown adipose tissue did not change and that of the colon and liver decreased. Accordingly, the site of osmotic thermogenesis is probably in the skeletal muscle, although osmotic stimulation was not accompanied by electromyographic activity and was not blocked by pretreatment with muscle relaxants such as dantrolene sodium or pancuronium bromide, or with the Na(+)-Cl(-) co-transport inhibitor bumetanide. 4. The increases in plasma osmolality observed after the administration of 20 % (1.3 osmol kg(-1)) glucose and 4.1 % (1.3 osmol kg(-1)) NaCl were 4.50 +/- 0.88 and 5.57 +/- 0.71 mosmol kg(-1), respectively. Since the slight increase in osmolality is well within the physiological range of changes that occur after food ingestion, diet-induced thermogenesis may have a component that is mediated by an increase in plasma osmolality, which results from the prandial increase in circulating nutrients.", 
    "102": "1. Measurements of cell capacitance were used to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which somatostatin inhibits Ca(2+)-induced exocytosis in single rat glucagon-secreting pancreatic alpha-cells. 2. Somatostatin decreased the exocytotic responses elicited by voltage-clamp depolarisations by 80 % in the presence of cyclic AMP-elevating agents such as isoprenaline and forskolin. Inhibition was time dependent and half-maximal within 22 s. 3. The inhibitory action of somatostatin was concentration dependent with an IC(50) of 68 nM and prevented by pretreatment of the cells with pertussis toxin. The latter effect was mimicked by intracellular dialysis with specific antibodies to G(i1/2) and by antisense oligonucleotides against G proteins of the subtype G(i2). 4. Somatostatin lacked inhibitory action when applied in the absence of forskolin or in the presence of the L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker nifedipine. The size of the omega-conotoxin-sensitive and forskolin-independent component of exocytosis was limited to 60 fF. By contrast, somatostatin abolished L-type Ca(2+) channel-dependent exocytosis in alpha-cells exposed to forskolin. The magnitude of the latter pool amounted to 230 fF. 5. The inhibitory effect of somatostatin on exocytosis was mediated by activation of the serine/threonine protein phosphatase calcineurin and was prevented by pretreatment with cyclosporin A and deltamethrin or intracellularly applied calcineurin autoinhibitory peptide. Experiments using the stable ATP analogue AMP-PCP indicate that somatostatin acts by depriming of granules. 6. We propose that somatostatin receptors associate with L-type Ca(2+) channels and couple to G(i2) proteins leading to a localised activation of calcineurin and depriming of secretory granules situated close to the L-type Ca(2+) channels.", 
    "103": "Cardiomyocyte development switches from hyperplasmic to hypertrophic growth between postnatal days 3 and 4 in rats. The mechanisms responsible for this transition have been controversial. beta-Adrenergic receptor (betaAR) activation of mitogenic responses in vitro has been reported. We hypothesized that tonic activation of the betaAR signaling regulates cell division in neonatal cardiomyocytes via effects on signaling kinases known to be important in cell cycle regulation. The purpose of the current study was to elucidate the roles of betaAR in rat cardiomyocyte growth in vivo. We demonstrated that betaAR blockade induced a significant reduction in cardiomyocyte proliferation as measured by the BrdU labeling index. Blockade of betaAR did not affect p38 or p44/42 MAPK activities. We further demonstrated that betaAR blockade induced a prompt deactivation of the p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70 S6K). To confirm these results, we measured p70 S6K activity directly. Basal activity of p70 S6K in neonatal cardiomyocytes was fourfold higher than that of insulin-treated adult rat liver. The activity of p70 S6K was reduced by 60% within 1 min after betaAR blockade. We conclude that the betaAR are involved in regulation of neonatal cardiomyocyte proliferation and that this mitogenic control may be mediated via the p70 S6K pathway.", 
    "104": "Noradrenergic inputs modulate hippocampal function via distinct receptors. In hippocampal neuronal cultures, mRNA expression of adrenoceptor subtypes is maintained from 1 day in vitro (DIV) to 22 DIV. Noradrenaline dose-dependently stimulates phosphoinositide (PI) breakdown in both immature and mature cultures through the activation of alpha1 receptors. At 22 DIV, basal PI breakdown depends on excitatory synaptic activity since it is decreased by tetrodotoxin or glutamate receptor antagonists. At 22 DIV, a similar decrease of basal PI breakdown is also observed with alpha1, alpha2 or beta adrenoceptor antagonists. These effects are not additive with that produced by tetrodotoxin. Adrenergic antagonists also strongly reduce spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic currents (sEPSC) as evidenced by whole cell recording. Therefore, in hippocampal cultures, excitatory transmission is modulated by a tonic activation of adrenoceptors probably produced by an endogenous ligand. Indeed, (i) the depletion of catecholamine pools by reserpine also decreases both basal PI metabolism and sEPSC; (ii) hippocampal neurons possess both tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase mRNAs, encoding enzymes required for catecholamine synthesis; and (iii) some hippocampal neurons show TH-immunoreactivity. TH-positive cells are also detected in E18 hippocampal sections. Thus, cultured hippocampal neurons synthesize and release an adrenergic-like ligand, which tonically potentiates excitatory synaptic transmission in mature cultures.",

The findings were: (1) beta(1,2)-AR-mediated tachycardia was similar in sham and AV3V-lesion rats, (2) beta(3)- and/or atypical beta-AR-mediated tachycardia elicited by isoproterenol (10 microg/kg, i.v.; ISO) was diminished in AV3V-lesion rats treated with beta(1,2)-AR antagonists, but was not in similarly-treated sham-lesion rats, and (3) the tachycardia elicited by the membrane permeable cAMP-analogue, 8-(4-chlorophenylthiol)-cAMP (10 micromol/kg, i.v.), was similar in AV3V- and sham-lesion rats. The possibility that increased plasma sodium/osmolality in AV3V-lesion rats down-regulated cardiac beta(3)- and/or atypical beta-ARs, but not beta(1,2)-ARs or intracellular cAMP signaling is discussed.", 
    "106": "The purpose of this study was to investigate in vivo the effects of modulating the adenosine system on endotoxin-induced release of cytokines and changes in heart performance and neurohumoral status in early, profound endotoxemia in rats. Time/pressure variables of heart performance and blood pressure were recorded continuously, and plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), interleukin 1-beta (IL-1beta), plasma renin activity (PRA), and catecholamines were determined before and 90 min after administration of endotoxin (30 mg/kg of lipopolysaccharide, i.v.). Erythro-9[2-hydroxyl-3-nonyl] adenine (EHNA; an adenosine deaminase inhibitor) had no effects on measured time-pressure variables of heart performance under baseline conditions and during endotoxemia, yet significantly attenuated endotoxin-induced release of cytokines and PRA. Pretreatment with the non-selective adenosine receptor antagonist DPSPX not only prevented the effects of EHNA but also increased the basal release of cytokines and augmented PRA. At baseline, caffeine (a non-selective adenosine receptor antagonist) increased HR, +dP/dtmax, heart rate x ventricular pressure product (HR x VPSP) and +dP/dtmax normalized by pressure (+dP/dtmax/VPSP), and these changes persisted during endotoxemia. Caffeine attenuated endotoxin-induced release of cytokines and augmented endotoxin-induced increases in plasma catecholamines and PRA. Pretreatment with propranolol abolished the effects of caffeine on heart performance and neurohumoral activation during the early phase of endotoxemia. 6N-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA; selective A1 adenosine receptor agonist) induced bradicardia and negative inotropic effects, reduced work load (i.e., decreased HR, VPSP, +dP/dtmax, +dP/dtmax/VPSP and HR x VPSP) and inhibited endotoxin-induced tachycardia and renin release. CGS 21680 (selective A2A adenosine receptor agonist) decreased blood pressure under basal condition but did not potentiate decreases in blood pressure during endotoxemia. CGS 21680 completely inhibited endotoxin-induced release of TNFalpha, augmented sympathetic activity and PRA, and increased +dP/dtmax and +dP/dtmax/VPSP in the absence and presence of endotoxin. The present study provides strong evidence that inhibition of adenosine deaminase reduces cytokine release in vivo without producing significant hemodynamic and cardiac effects during the early phase of profound endotoxemia in rats. The augmented neurohumoral activation induced by caffeine is associated with decreased cytokine release induced by endotoxin. Further studies are warranted to determine the impact of these effects on cardiac function and hemodynamics in the late phase of endotoxemia.",

The eventual fate of NO is oxidation to nitrite (NO2) and nitrate (NO3), both of which are end-products of NO metabolism. Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2) is increased in exhaled breath condensate of asthmatic subjects and may be used as a non-invasive marker of oxidative stress. NO has in some cases been shown to attenuate oxidant-induced lung injury. Total NO2/NO3 concentration and H2O2 levels were measured in expired breath condensate in 50 clinically stable asthmatics [all males, all atopics, mean age 22 (3) SD yrs, forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1) 91 (10)% predicted, PD20 to histamine 0.262 (0.16) mg 20 on inhaled steroids, 20 smokers, all steroid-naive] and in 10 normal, non-atopic subjects [all males, age 23 (4) yrs, FEV1 101 (14)% predicted, PD20 to histamine 1.3 (0.55) mg].

Patients who were on inhaled steroids had significantly ower values compared to steroid-naive (0.71, 95% CI 0.55-0.87 microM vs. 133, 95% CI 1-1.65 microM, P < 0.001). Similar results were observed between smokers and non-smokers (1.11, 95% CI 0.74-1.47 microM vs. 1.77, 95% CI 1.1-24 microM, P < 0.0001). There was a significant positive correlation between NO2/NO3 levels and H2O2 concentration in expired breath condensate (r = 0.48, P < 0.0001). No correlation was observed between NO2/NO3 levels, airway obstruction and bronchial hyper-reactivity as assessed by PD20 to histamine. Total NO2/NO3 levels in expired breath condensate are raised in patients with stable asthma and are significantly related to oxidative stress as assessed by H2O2 concentration.

The proportional decrease in basal heart frequency varied from 20 to 33%, with an average of 25.4 +/- 3.9% in the propranolol group, maintaining a mean of 24.3 +/- 3.6% decrease in the postoperative period. Differences on clinical recovery of the postoperative ileus were not found. Significant differences on electromyographic patterns were not observed between the groups, except for the presence of a greater number of short-duration contractions in the second postoperative day in the beta-blocked group.", 
    "124": "The authors suggest that the preoperative beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol does not determine myoelectric activity changes that could contribute to an earlier resolution of postoperative ileus.", 
    "125": "The aim was to determine if the combination of cyclic variation of myocardial integrated backscatter (variation IB) and left ventricular mass measurements can predict the efficacy of beta-blocker treatment in dilated cardiomyopathy. In 32 patients, left ventricular mass and variation IB were measured at baseline and during 6 microg/kg/min dobutamine infusion before the initiation of beta-blocker therapy. Variation IB was measured at left and right ventricular halves in the ventricular septum. The baseline left ventricular mass index and transseptal variation IB gradient during dobutamine were significantly greater in the effective group (1.16 +/- 0.18 g/mL and 1.8 +/- 0.6 dB) than in the ineffective group (0.94 +/- 0.28 g/mL, p = 0.032 and 0.4 +/- 0.6 dB, p < 0.005). When both baseline left ventricular mass index > or = 1.05 g/mL and transseptal variation IB gradient during dobutamine > or = 1.5 dB were defined as predictive criteria for the effective group, the sensitivity was 78% and the specificity was 86%. Analysis of transseptal variation IB during dobutamine may provide useful information predicting the efficacy of beta-blocker therapy in dilated cardiomyopathy.", 
    "126": "The aim of the present study was to test a possible effect of the A218C tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) gene variant on the antidepressant activity of fluvoxamine in a sample of major and bipolar depressives, with or without psychotic features. Two hundred and seventeen inpatients were treated with fluvoxamine 300 mg and either placebo or pindolol in a double blind design for 6 weeks. The severity of depressive symptoms was weekly assessed with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. TPH allelic variants were determined in each subject by using a PCR-based technique. No significant finding was observed in the overall sample as well as in the pindolol group, while TPH*A/A was associated with a slower response to fluvoxamine treatment in subjects not taking pindolol (P = 0.001). This effect was independent from the previously reported influence of 5-HTTLPR polymorphism. If confirmed, these results may shed further light on the genetically determined component of the response to pharmacological treatments, thus helping the clinician to individualize each patient's therapy according to their genetic pattern.", 
    "127": "The purpose of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of beta-blocker therapy with either metoprolol or carvedilol in addition to conventional therapy for patients with heart failure (HF) in Canada.", 
    "128": "A Markov simulation was used to estimate the costs and life expectancy for treating patients with conventional therapy alone and with the addition of metoprolol or carvedilol. Although carvedilol has been marketed in Canada since 1999, metoprolol succinate has yet to be marketed there, so the price is unknown. Therefore we input a Canadian price based on the price ratio of the 2 drugs in the United States.", 
    "129": "For subjects aged 60 years at HF onset, the expected years of life are 4.53 years for those treated with conventional therapy alone, 5.70 years for those who receive conventional therapy plus metoprolol, and 6.21 years for those who receive conventional therapy plus carvedilol. The expected costs (in 1999 Canadian dollars) are $8,989, $13,833, and $18,114, respectively. This yields incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for metoprolol relative to conventional therapy alone of $4,140 per life-year gained, and for carvedilol relative to metoprolol, the ICER is $8,394 per life-year gained.", 
    "130": "In addition to conventional therapy with furosemide and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, treatment with either metoprolol or carvedilol confers a survival benefit that is attractive from a cost-effectiveness point of view. Until better information becomes available, it is not possible to distinguish between the two beta-blockers on the basis of cost-effectiveness. This means that the choice of beta-blockers for HF should be based largely on clinical considerations because both beta-blockers prolong life at relatively low cost.", 
    "131": "Carvedilol has been shown to improve morbidity and mortality in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). There are limited data of carvedilol use in patients on inotrope therapy. We present our experience with carvedilol titration in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IIIb/IV patients stabilized on milrinone therapy, as a nonrandomized study with a parallel control group of patients never on inotropes. These patients achieved volume control and stabilization of their symptoms during the course of milrinone therapy.", 
    "132": "Seventeen patients in class IIIb/IV CHF (group 1) on intermittent intravenous milrinone therapy and 15 patients in class II/IIIa compensated CHF (group 2) on standard triple heart failure therapy were titrated on carvedilol. Success and adverse events during titration were compared between the 2 groups. Fifteen (88%) patients in group 1 and 14 (93%) patients in group 2 were successfully titrated on carvedilol over 8.1 +/- 1.8 weeks and 6.7 +/- 2.8 weeks, respectively. The target dose of carvedilol (25 or 50 mg twice daily) was achieved in 13 (87%) patients (group 1) and 14 (93%) patients (group 2). Seven (47%) patients in group 1 and 4 (28%) patients in group 2 had adverse events during carvedilol titration. Eight (53%) patients in group 1 were weaned off milrinone over a period of 8.4 weeks after carvedilol titration, whereas the rest of the patients had reduction in the frequency of infusion. Ten (63%) patients in group 1 improved by one or more functional classes.", 
    "133": "Patients in NYHA class IIIb/IV who are treated with inotropic therapy can be titrated on carvedilol after reaching a stable state while on milrinone and standard oral drugs. Most of these patients can be successfully weaned off of milrinone or have decreased frequency of infusions and demonstrate improved functional status. Prospective randomized trials are required to evaluate these observations made in a limited number of patients in class IIIb and IV CHF because the combination of milrinone and beta-blockers has never been adequately evaluated.", 
    "134": "International placebo-controlled survival trials (Metoprolol Controlled-Release Randomised Intervention Trial in Heart Failure [MERIT-HF], Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study [CIBIS-II], and Carvedilol Prospective Randomized Cumulative Survival trial [COPERNICUS]) evaluating the effects of b-blockade in patients with heart failure have all demonstrated highly significant positive effects on total mortality as well as total mortality plus all-cause hospitalization. Also, the analysis of the US Carvedilol Program indicated an effect on these end points. Although none of these trials are large enough to provide definitive results in any particular subgroup, it is natural for physicians to examine the consistency of results across various subgroups or risk groups. Our purpose was to examine both predefined and post hoc subgroups in the MERIT-HF trial to provide guidance as to whether any subgroup is at increased risk, despite an overall strongly positive effect, and to discuss the difficulties and limitations in conducting such subgroup analyses.", 
    "135": "The study was conducted at 313 clinical sites in 16 randomization regions across 14 countries, with a total of 3991 patients. Total mortality (first primary end point) and total mortality plus all-cause hospitalization (second primary end point) were analyzed on a time to first event. The first secondary end point was total mortality plus hospitalization for heart failure.", 
    "136": "Overall, MERIT-HF demonstrated a hazard ratio of 0.66 for total mortality and 0.81 for mortality plus all-cause hospitalization. The hazard ratio of the first secondary end point of mortality plus hospitalization for heart failure was 0.69. The results were remarkably consistent for both primary outcomes and the first secondary outcome across all predefined subgroups as well as for nearly all post hoc subgroups. The results of the post hoc US subgroup showed a mortality hazard ratio of 1.05. However, the US results regarding both the second primary combined outcome of total mortality plus all-cause hospitalization and of the first secondary combined outcome of total mortality plus heart failure hospitalization were in concordance with the overall results of MERIT-HF. Tests of country by treatment interaction (14 countries) revealed a nonsignificant P value of.22 for total mortality. The mortality hazard ratio for US patients in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III/IV was 0.80, and it was 2.24 for patients in NYHA class II, which is not consistent with causality by biologic gradient. We have not been able to identify any confounding factor in baseline characteristics, baseline treatment, or treatment during follow-up that could account for any treatment by country interaction. Thus we attribute the US subgroup mortality hazard ratio to be due to chance.", 
    "137": "Just as we must be extremely cautious in overinterpreting positive effects in subgroups, even those that are predefined, we must also be cautious in focusing on subgroups with an apparent neutral or negative trend. We should examine subgroups to obtain a general sense of consistency, which is clearly the case in MERIT-HF. We should expect some variation of the treatment effect around the overall estimate as we examine a large number of subgroups because of small sample size in subgroups and chance. Thus the best estimate of the treatment effect on total mortality for any subgroup is the estimate of the hazard ratio for the overall trial.", 
    "138": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is present in a significant number of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) caused by left ventricular dysfunction and is associated with significant morbidity and increased mortality rates. Thus it is necessary to establish therapy to improve the outcome in this high-risk population.", 
    "139": "We conducted a retrospective analysis of data from the US Carvedilol Heart Failure Trials Program and identified patients with AF at the time of enrollment. In these trials, 1094 patients with at least 3 months of heart failure symptoms and an ejection fraction < or = 0.35 were randomly assigned to receive carvedilol or placebo in a double-blind, stratified program according to performance on an exercise test.", 
    "140": "One hundred thirty-six patients with concomitant AF and CHF were identified during the screening visit (84 assigned to carvedilol and 52 to placebo). Therapy with carvedilol resulted in a significant improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (from 23% to 33% with carvedilol and from 24% to 27% with placebo, P =.001). The physician global assessment improved in a greater number of patients treated with carvedilol than in those treated with placebo (71% vs 48%, P =.025). A trend toward a reduction in the combined end point of death or CHF hospitalization was also observed (19% in patients treated with placebo and 7% in patients on carvedilol; relative risk, 0.35; 95% confidence interval, 0.12, 1.02; P =.055).", 
    "141": "In patients with AF complicating CHF, carvedilol significantly improves left ventricular ejection fraction and physician global assessment and probably reduces the combined end point of CHF hospitalizations or death.", 
    "142": "We compared in vitro relaxant effect of chloride channel modulators, such as 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino) benzoic acid (NPPB) and anthracene-9-carboxylate (9-AC), and beta(2)-adrenergic agonists, such as ritodrine, in pregnant rat myometrium.", 
    "143": "Isolated myometrial strips were obtained from eight pregnant rats, and the strips were mounted in organ baths for recording isometric tension. The effects of 10(-8)-10(-4) M ritodrine, 10(-6)-3 x 10(-4) M NPPB, and 10(-6)-10(-3) M 9-AC on spontaneous contractions were recorded.", 
    "144": "Ritodrine (10(-8)-10(-5) M) completely inhibited the amplitude and frequency of spontaneous contractions in myometrial strips isolated from pregnant rats in a concentration-dependent manner, but the relaxant effect of ritodrine at 10(-4) M concentration resulted in tachyphylaxis. The chloride channel blocker NPPB (10(-6)-3 x 10(-4) M) and the chloride transport inhibitor 9-AC (10(-5)-10(-3) M) decreased the amplitude of spontaneous myometrial contractions in a concentration-dependent manner; the maximum inhibition produced by the highest tested concentration of each drug was 43.8% and 42.1% of the original degree of spontaneous contractions, respectively. The frequency of myometrial contractions was significantly inhibited by NPPB and 9-AC beginning with the concentration of 10(-4) M.", 
    "145": "NPPB and 9-AC appear to be effective relaxants of pregnant rat myometrium. These effects of NPPB and 9-AC might be therapeutically advantageous in clinical management of preterm labor.", 
    "146": "Sciatic nerve damage led to a defective functioning of the renal mineralocorticoid receptors due to the disturbed neurotrophic supply of this organ: the reception of distorted nervous stimuli. The pharmacological blockade of both the neurotransmitter and the humoral pathways of the pathological stimuli from the damaged nerve to the kidney prevented the development of trophic disturbances as tested by the state of the renal mineralocorticoid receptor system. At the same time, the pharmacological stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system leads to an even more defective aldosterone reception by the kidney. Propranolol exerted an antidystrophic effect in the case of local damages of the nervous system and, thereby, prevented the development of neurogenic dystrophies.", 
    "147": "The benefits of continuous treatment of hypertension have been extensively documented in randomized controlled trials. However, clinical trials may not reflect actual drug use in the population.", 
    "148": "To examine the distribution and determinants of patterns of use of antihypertensive agents in the first 5 years of hypertension treatment in Saskatchewan.", 
    "149": "Patterns of use and modifications to therapy were derived from a careful examination of medication use in a cohort of 19 501 subjects aged 40 to 79 years, without recognized cardiac disease and initiating therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, a calcium antagonist, or a beta-blocker in Saskatchewan between 1990 and 1993.", 
    "150": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (37.4%), followed by calcium antagonists (27.5%) and beta-blockers (26.4%), were the most commonly prescribed agents to initiate treatment in our study population. Patients with diabetes were less likely to be dispensed a beta-blocker, as were younger and female patients. Previous visits to a cardiologist decreased the likelihood of receiving combination therapy or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors but increased that of using calcium antagonists. Apart from dose adjustment, 89% of study subjects underwent at least 1 modification to their initial regimen, at a median time of 134 days. After 1 year, only 33.8% of patients were still using their initial drug. An early decrease in the proportion of patients continuing to receive initial therapy was noted, especially among beta-blocker users.", 
    "151": "Erratic drug-taking behaviors were observed in this Saskatchewan population. In addition, initial drug use does not seem to be in accordance with the stepped-care approach to hypertension therapy recommended in the Canadian guidelines.", 
    "152": "Alterations in Ca(2+)-handling proteins are thought to underlie the deranged Ca(2+) transients that contribute to deterioration of cardiac function in congestive heart failure (CHF). Clinical trials in CHF patients have shown that treatment with beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists (betaB) improves cardiac performance. The present study determined whether the abundance of Ca(2+)-handling proteins is different in failing hearts from patients treated or untreated with beta B.", 
    "153": "Ca(2+) regulatory protein abundance was compared in LV myocardium of 10 nonfailing hearts (NF group) and 44 failing hearts (CHF group) removed at transplantation. Analysis was performed in betaB-treated (betaB-CHF) and non-betaB treated (non-betaB-CHF) patients and in 4 subgroups: ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM, n=10), nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM, n=10), ICM with betaB therapy (betaB-ICM, n=12), and DCM with betaB therapy (betaB-DCM, n=12). Sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase, phospholamban, and Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger protein abundance were determined by use of Western blot analysis. Ca(2+) transients were measured with fluo-3. Sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase was significantly less abundant whereas phospholamban and Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger were not significantly altered in non-betaB-CHF versus NF. Sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase in the betaB-ICM and betaB-DCM was greater than in non-betaB-CHF and were not different than in NF. Ca(2+) transients in non-betaB-CHF myocytes had significantly smaller peaks and were prolonged versus NF myocytes. Ca(2+) transients from betaB-CHF myocytes had shorter durations than in betaB-CHF myocytes.", 
    "154": "betaB treatment in CHF patients can normalize the abundance of myocyte Ca(2+) regulatory proteins and improve Ca(2+)-handling.", 
    "155": "Neutrophils play a pivotal role in the antibacterial host defense system. Atenolol, labetalol, esmolol, and landiolol at clinically relevant concentrations failed to change neutrophil functions. Our findings indicate that we may be able to use these beta-antagonists without great caution in clinical settings."
