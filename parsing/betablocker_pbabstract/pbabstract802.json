Considerations of drug concentration requirements, actions of analogues, and time studies all indicate that the adrenergic blockers do not act in this circumstance as conventional blockers of alpha or beta receptor sites. It is suggested that the membrane-stabilizing properties of these agents may be the important determinant for their limited \"antiactivation\" effect. Ethacrynic acid, a potent and more complete inhibitor of connective tissue activation, appears to act via a different mechanism.", 
    "1": "Among the newest beta-blocking agents visken is the one that either produces no or very little adverse inotropic effect. In some groups of patients with organic and neurotic cardiac disorders, screened as a result of a careful clinical examination, changes that occurred on the ECG with 12 leads following an intake of a single visken tablet (5 mg) were studied. Ingestion of visken was not seen to bring any improvement in the ECG findings in 88 per cent of 50 patients with organic disorders, most of whom had sclerosis of the coronary arteries and hypertensive disease attended by a high diastolic pressure. A thorough clinical examination of 70 patients presenting neurotic conditions helped to rule out any organic cardiac lesions, and in them the diastolic pressure did not exceed 95 mm Hg. The visken test showed that in 91 per cent of these cases the ECG returned back to normal and only in 1.5 per cent of them no changes could be observed. In both of the above groups the effect of visken was statistically significant (p less than 0.001). Repolarization derangements in the I and II leads among patients with organic lesions was observed 4 times as often as in the II and III leads. Among neurotic patients changes recorded in the II and III leads were twice as frequent as in the I and II leads.", 
    "2": "For 30 years the thyrotoxic patient has been subjected to a plurality of treatments by surgery, radio-iodine and long term anti-thyroid drugs. These therapies have been accepted as complementary to the needs of the individual patient, without regard for long term results or the economic situation as it affects both patient and hospital services. In the context of surgical treatment which is now available, it is suggested that the advantages of operation over other therapies presage a reversion to surgery as the treatment of choice.", 
    "3": "Proceeding from a dynamic observation of the tolerance of physical exercises in the process of drug therapy of 90 patients with ischaemic heart disease the author concludes that a certain dissociation exists between the subjective effect of the antianginal drugs and the results of bicycle tests in the evaluation of the efficacy of the treatment. While a subjective improvement was declared in 2/3 of the patients, the exercise test indices improved only in 1/3. The bicylce test before and after the therapeutic course seems to facilitate a more precise evaluation of the efficacy of the antianginal drugs.", 
    "4": "The effects of pH variation on ionic exchange and mechanical function were studied in the arterially perfused rat and rabbit septa. The pH and PCO2 of the control perfusate were 7.40 and 39 mmHg, respectively. In the rabbit septum a metabolic acidosis (pH equals 6.82, PCO2 equals 39 mmHg) caused a loss of 16% of control tension in 12 min. Na+ and K+ exchange were unaltered. A comparable respiratory acidosis (pH equals 6.81, PCO2 equals 159 mmHg) caused a 51% loss of tension in 2 min. Na+ exchange was unaltered but K+ efflux fell from 8.9 +/- 0.6 (mean +/- SE) to 4.9 +/- 0.3 mmol/kg dry wt per min (P less than 0.001, n equals 10). A net gain of K+ of 16.9 +/- 1.7 (n equals 14) mmol/kg dry wt occurred and was attributable to a delayed fall in K+ influx relative to efflux over 15 min. The net gain could not be mimicked by epinephrine administration or blocked by propranolol and was absent in the beating rat septum and the quiescent rabbit septum. These results suggest that the net uptake of K+, which appears to be dependent on a period of depolarization, and the changes of contractility are controlled by the H+ ion concentration at a cellular site whose exchange with the extracellular space is characterized by a considerable restriction of diffusion. Changes of contractility are not related to the net uptake of K+.", 
    "5": "Propranolol at a dose (10 mg/kg) which did not alter tail-flick latency by itself, did not alter the ED50 of morphine when given 10 min prior to the narcotic. Propranolol at doses of 10 and 25 mg/kg given 10 min prior to naloxone challenge did not significantly alter the frequency of naloxone induced jumping 72 hr after morphine pellet implantation. The ED50 of naloxone in morphine pelleted mice was not altered by treatment with propranolol at 0, 24, and 48 hr after pellet implantation. Naloxone caused hyperactivity in mice when administered 72 hr after morphine pellet implantation. An injection of 25 mg/kg propranolol 10 min prior to naloxone did not block this hyperactivity. In addition, administration of 10 mg/kg of propranolol every 8 hr to rats during withdrawal from morphine failed to alleviate the withdrawal syndrome as evidenced by changes in either body weight or water intake. These data suggest that the beta-adrenergic blocking agent, propranolol, does not alter the antinociceptive activity or lessen the withdrawal syndrome of morphine in rodents.", 
    "6": "Using microcatheter blood pressure telemetry, the pressure-lowering effect of prindolol (Visken), a beta-blocking drug, was tested at a dose of 10 mg three time daily by mouth in eight patients with essential hypertension (WHO stage II) and low to normal plasma-renin activities. After about ten days of treatment, the hypertensive reaction to everyday physical exercise (walking, climbing stairs, bicycle ergometry) was especially favourably affected. The average blood-pressure reduction at rest was 18.6/12.1 (systolic/diastolic), on stair climbing 41.5/17.2 mm Hg.", 
    "7": "Mild tail pinch reliably and rapidly induced eating, gnawing, or licking behavior in all animals tested. Eating was by far the predominant response. Pharmacological analysis of the involvement of the brain catecholamines in tail-pinch behavior suggests that it is critically dependent on the nigrostriatal dopamine system.", 
    "8": "Effects on anginal symptoms of sudden withdrawal of large doses of propranolol or placebo were evaluated in 20 patients in a double-blind crossover efficacy trial requiring sudden cessation of the agent. With propranolol, 160 to 320 mg per day for six and 12 weeks, no patients had increased angina or nitroglycerin use, and there were no hospitalizations or deaths. However, within two weeks of discontinuance of propranolol, untoward ischemic events developed in 10 patients. Six had serious withdrawal complications: intermediate coronary syndrome in three, and ventricular tachycardia, fatal myocardial infarction, and sudden death in one each. In four patients discontinuance of placebo increased anginal symptoms; in the remaining 10, ischemic symptoms were not provoked. The rebound phenomenon was related to degree of pre-propranolol angina and relief of pain by the agent. Thus, chronically administered propranolol should be gradually reduced, and activity restricted during its withdrawal.", 
    "9": "The clinical features of a 9-year-old boy with an extra-adrenal phaeochromocytoma, complicated by malignant hypertension, are described. The value of urinary and blood catecholamine assays and specialised radiological investigations in the accurate localisation of the tumour, is emphasised. Successful removal of the tumour was facilitated by pre-operative control of the hypertension with a combination of alpha and beta-adrenergic blockade (phenoxybenzamine and practolol). Intra-operative control of fluctuations in blood pressure was simplified by the use of Ethrane (enflurane compound 347) as one of the anaesthetic agents. As a result, sodium nitroprusside was infrequently used.", 
    "10": "Investigations were carried out on the interactions of the hallucinogenic drug, D-lysergic acid diethylamide (D-LSD), and other serotonin antagonists with catecholamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase systems in cell-free preparations from different regions of rat brain. In equimolar concentration, D-LSD, 2-brono-D-lysergic acid diethylamide (BOL), or methysergide (UML) strongly blocked maximal stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity by either norepinephrine or dopamine in particulate preparations from cerebral cortices of young adult rats. D-LSD also eliminated the stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity of equimolar concentrations of norepinephrine or dopamine in particulate preparations from rat hippocampus. The effects of this hallucinogenic agent on adenylate cyclase activity were most striking in particulate preparations from corpus striatum. Thus, in 10 muM concentration, D-LSD not only completely eradicated the response to 10 muM dopamine in these preparations but also consistently stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. L-LSD (80 muM) was without effect. Significant activation of striatal adenylate cyclase was produced by 0.1 muM D-LSD. Activation of striatal adenylate cyclase of either D-LSD or dopamine was strongly blocked by the dopamine-blocking agents trifluoperazine, thioridazine, chlorpromazine, and haloperidol. The stimulatory effects of D-LSD and dopamine were also inhibited by the serotonin-blocking agents, BOL, 1-methyl-D-lysergic acid diethylamide (MLD), and cyproheptadine, but not by the beta-adrenergic-blocking agent, propranolol. However, these serotonin antagonists by themselves were incapable of stimulating adenylate cyclase activity in the striatal preparations. Several other hallucinogens, which were structurally related to serotonin, were also inactive in this regard, e.g., mescaline, N,N-dimethyltryptamine, psilocin and bufotenine. Serotonin itself produced a small stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity in striatal preparations and, in relatively high concentration (100 muM), partially blocked the activation by 10 muM dopamine, but was without effect on the stimulation by 10 muM D-LSD. The present results indicate that serotonin antagonists, in general, are potent inhibitors of catecholamine-induced stimulation of adenylate cyclase systems in brain cell-free preparations. In addition, these results, coupled with earlier findings on the capacity of D-LSD to interact with serotonin-sensitive adenylate cyclase systems from rat brain23,24 and other neural systems16, strongly suggest that this hallucinogenic agent is capable of acting as an agonist at central dopamine and serotonin receptors, as well as functioning as an antagonist at dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin receptors in the brain.", 
    "11": "Afternood lying and standing blood pressure, pulse rate and plasma pindolol levels were measured twice, a month apart, in 16 cases in which hypertension was well controlled either by pindolol alone or by pindolol plus a diuretic. During the month preceding each observation, the daily dose of pindolol was given in either two or three divided doses. Plasma pindolol levels could be measured in only seven cases. In these, 4 p.m. plasma pindolol levels were significantly lower on the twice-daily dosage regimen. Mean afternoon lying and standing blood pressure and lying pulse rate values were slightly but not significantly higher on the twice-daily regimen. Mean standing pulse rates were significantly higher on the twice-daily regimen. It appears that, for the control of hypertension, pindolol can be given in a twice daily regimen in most cases.", 
    "12": "The cardiovascular and respiratory actions of the adrenergic beta adrenoceptive drug sotalol have been studied in an open, short term trial. Fifteen patients with angina performed standardized orthostatic and exercise tests before and after injection of 20 mg sotalol intravenously. Although there was a significant reduction of heart rate and blood pressure at the time of appearance of angina pectoris and ST-segment depression, there was only a slight and statistically insignificant increase in work before the appearance of angina pectoris, and ischaemic changes in the ECG disappeared more rapidly after work. In a different group of patients suffering from obstructive lung disease, sotalol 10 mg intravenously produced a significant increase in airway resistance. It has no such effect on normal subjects.", 
    "13": "The effect of diazoxide on left ventricular performance during rest and isometric exercise (handgrip) was examined in 16 unselected hypertensive patients, 6 of whom had been pretreated with the beta-adrenergic blocking agent pindolol. Diazoxide regularly and promptly produced a fall in left ventricle systolic and end diastolic pressures, and an increase in heart rate and left ventricular dp/dtmax. Haemodynamic changes were maximal 2 minutes after injection of the drug and decreased little over the next 8 minutes. After beta-adrenergic blockade, diazoxide caused a more pronounced reduction in left ventricular systolic pressure and a less marked fall in end-diastolic pressure, whilst the diazoxide-induced rise in heart rate was partially and the increase of dp/dtmax was completly inhibited. The increase in systolic pressure during isometric exercise was not influenced by diazoxide, but the positive inotropic reaction was augmented. The findings appear to show that cardiac stimulation by diazoxide is due to a reflex mechanism transmitted by baroreceptors, and that improvement of cardiac performance is mainly due to a reduction of left ventricular after-load.", 
    "14": "A data bank containing our clinical experience with more than 3,000 patients with suspected and documented ischemic heart disease is being used to expand our ability to care for patients. This report describes how the experience is documented, stored, and retrieved so that it can be used in patient management. Data acquisition is integrated with patient care by means of forms that are part of the patient record. Follow-up information is obtained at six months, one year, and yearly thereafter. All data are stored in a computer information system that allows the doctor to recall the experience of patients like his new patient. Prognostic information is available on each new patient both on-line and in the form of a printed laboratory report. The data bank represents an initial chapter of a computer textbook of medicine.", 
    "15": "The effects of various drugs on the partially obstructed ureter were investigated in a new model experiment which permitted the calculation of peripheral resistance. After the administration of noradrenaline, the local spasm of the ureter in the region of the obstruction was increased and the urinary flow fell. After administration of the alpha-blocker phentolamine and of the beta-receptor stimulant orciprenaline there was a reduction of the peripheral resistance and an increase in urinary flow due to spasmolysis. Because of its lower side-effect rate, phentolamine is worth investigating in further clinical studies.", 
    "16": "1. Plasma levels of propranolol and practolol were measured in groups of elderly and young subjects, after the oral administration of propranolol (40 mg) and practolol (200 mg) on separate occasions. 2. At all sampling times the mean plasma propranolol level in the group of elderly subjects was substantially greater than the corresponding level in the group of young subjects, there being a significant difference between the two, and a fourfold difference in the mean peak levels. 3. After practolol, there was no significant difference between the mean plasma concentrations of the drug in the two groups for the first 2 hours. Subsequently, the mean plasma levels in the group of elderly subjects were somewhat higher than the corresponding levels in the young group, the differences between the two reaching significance. 4. It is suggested that there is a need to substantially reduce the dose of propranolol given to elderly patients. With practolol, however, no reduction is necessary providing renal function is normal for the patient's age.", 
    "17": "In the rat isolated ductus deferens, effects of isadrine, propranolol and phentolamine on contractions following exogenous noradrenaline and transmural stimulation, were studied. Low concentrations of isadrine diminished the responses to these factors. The inhibiting effect of a mimetic was blocked by propranolol which indicates presence of beta-adrenoreceptors in the rat ductus deferens; low concentrations of phentolamine blocked the exogenous adrenaline effect while the response to transmural stimulation increased. As the data show, the adrenoreceptors' sensitivity to noradrenaline is decreased by phentolamine 5-10(-8) M by 2.5 times while the mediator concentration increases by 3.3 times in the receptors vicinity. Alpha-adrenoreceptors are concluded to differ from beta those in that the former do participate in regulation of noradrenaline release in response to neural impulses.", 
    "18": "The question of whether the coronary blood vessels contain an intrinsic adrenergic mechanism for vasodilatation of physiological significance has been examined in the canine heart-lung preparation with a donor by studying the response of the coronary vessels to epinephrine, norepinephrine, isoproterenol and salbutamol in combination with practolol. To differentiate the vasodilatation mediated through adrenoceptors in the coronary vessels from that resulting from an increase in the myocardial O2 consumption, a special method of analysis was developed based on the linear relation between the coronary flow and the myocardial O2 consumption. It was found that all four compounds produced an increase in the coronary flow attributable to an increased myocardial O2 consumption. Epinephrine and norepinephrine produced a decrease in the coronary flow after practolol which completely abolished the increase in the myocardial O2 consumption as well as the positive inotropic and chronotropic effects produced by these compounds, while isoproterenol and salbutamol produced an increase. These results indicate that adrenergic beta-receptor exists in the coronary subserving a vasodilatation. However, the vasodilatation through this mechanism is of minor importance under physiological conditions and becomes completely masked in the presence of an overwhelmingly strong vasodilatation consequent to an increase in the myocardial O2 consumption.", 
    "19": "Results are presented on the treatment with Inderal of 57 patients with essential hypertension and symptomatic renal hypertension in whom the changes in central and renal haemodynamics were carefully traced. In all the patients with renal hypertension (chronic pyelonephritis, chronic glomerulonephritis) the function of the kidneys was adequate. Inderal when used in a daily dose of 120--160 mg produces a hypotensive effect in patients with stage IB and IIA essential hypertension with unstable symptomatic renal hypertension who have a predominantly hyperkinetic type of the circulation. In such cases the haemodynamic changes manifest themselves in a considerable reduction of the cardiac output at the expense of a slower pulse rate and decreased stroke volume; the total peripheral resistance was moderately elevated. In patients with stage IIB of essential hypertension and in those with persistent and severe symptomatic renal hypertension the hypotensive effect of Inderal given in a daily dose of 480 mg and sometimes even higher was accompanied by a statistically significant decrease in the total peripheral resistance and a moderate reduction of the cardiac output and cardiac index at the expense of a slower pulse rate.", 
    "20": "A case of the surdocardiac syndrome of Jervell and Lange-Nielsen, with prolonged QT interval in the electrocardiogram at birth, is described. The affected girl presented 3 1/2 years later with severe iron deficiency anaemia, despite apparently adequate nutrition. At the age of 4 1/2 years she had a sudden attack of unconsciousness. Treatment with the beta-adrenoceptor blocker practolol was started and 3 years after initiation of this treatment she has been free from syncopal attacks. The QT interval remains prolonged. Her brother also had severe iron deficiency anaemia and had several attacks of unconsciousness before he died suddenly at the age of 3 1/2 years.", 
    "21": "Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia in man has been considered to be due to either development of reentry utilizing AV junctional tissue or the presence of an ectopic pacemaker located within the atrium. Most contemporary information suggests that AV junctional reentry is the dominant mechanism for this arrhythmia in man. This present study identifies that the frequence of tachycardia episodes may be correlated with the width of a tachycardia zone as determined by the atrial extrastimulus technique. Moreover, pharmacological therapy directed toward the elimination of this arrhythmia can be assessed utilizing this atrial stimulation technique. Findings in this present study identify that, in patients with widened tachycardia zones, propranolol therapy may not be efficacious. This latter finding is no contrast to the previous observations suggesting that propranolol therapy is the drug of choice for reentrant arrhythmias in man.", 
    "22": "Experiments were conducted on cats; a study was made of the effect of pharmacological block and stimulation of the adrenergic innervation on the toxicity and the cumulative effect of strophanthine. It was found that anapryline premedication and a preliminary reserpinization increased the strophanthine tolerance and reduced its cumulative effect. Isadrine caused a sharp elevation of the sensitivity to cardiac glycoside, but no cumulation was present in this case.", 
    "23": "In order to compare neuro-effector function in different blood vessels, frequency-response relationships were determined for the following preparations: 1)Isolated rings of the proximal saphenous, distal saphenous and ear arteries, the parietal branch of the internal iliac vein and the small saphenous vein from the rabbit, 2) spiral strips of the rabbit pulmonary artery and 3) longitudinal preparations of the rat portal vein. In each rabbit tissue only one low (less than or equal to 4 Hz) and one high (larger than or equal to 8 Hz) transmural nerve stimulation frequency was applied until steady state responses were obtained and these were expressed as a percentage of a maximum response to exogenous noradrenaline (NA) applied in each experiment. The general shape of the frequency-response curves was similar, but differences in steepness and amplitude of the maximum neurogenic response relative to exogenous NA were found. The steepness of the frequency-response relationships of the veins tended to be greater than those of the arteries. It appears that factors such as close neuro-muscular contacts, presence of terminal nerve fibres within the media and the operation of mechanisms for myogenic propagation of activity contribute to the effectiveness of neurogenic vascular control as revealed by frequency-response curves. In vivo, geometrical factors can greatly augment the hemodynamic significance of the observed differences.", 
    "24": "1. The acute reduction of renal blood flow following adrenalectomy in the rat, which had previously been shown to be associated with sequestration of blood volume in the splanchnic area, was further investigated. An attempt was made to define the role of the renal sympathetic nerves in causing the blood flow change. 2. The systemic and renal intra-arterial administration of phenoxybenzamine, isoprenaline and propranolol and denervation of the renal pedicle failed to re-establish normal renal function. 3. Infusion of P113 (sarcosyl1 alanine8), an angiotensin blocker, failed to improve renal function. 4. In contrast, volume replacement with high-molecular weight PVP caused a prompt increase of RPF and GFR without altering arterial pressure and central venous pressure. 5. Angiographic studies demonstrated that the calibre of the aorta of adrenalectomized rats was significantly smaller than that of the sham operated and increased after the administration of this plasma volume expander. 6. It was concluded that after adrenalectomy the major arteries readjusted their calibre to the reduced volume of blood in the arterial tree with maintenance of a constant pressure/volume relationship. Their contracted state in the case of the kidney then led to flow reduction.", 
    "25": "1. Stimulation of left atrial receptors by distension of the junctions between the pulmonary veins and the left atrium is known to cause a reflex increase in heart rate. It was suggested that the efferent path of this reflex was solely in the sympathetic nerves to the heart but more recently the existence of a vagal efferent component has been postulated by Albrook, Bennion & Ledsome (1972). 3. The junctions between the pulmonary veins and the levt atrium were distended before and after the administration of I.C.I. 66082 and bretylium tosylate. The response of an increase in heart rate was significantly decreased after the administration of I.C.I. 66082 (5 mg/kg) and abolished after the administration of bretylium tosylate (10 mg/kg). 3. It is concluded that the efferent pathway of the reflex is solely in the sympathetic nerves to the heart.", 
    "26": "Intrarenal perfusion of dopamine (6 mug/kg/min for 10 min) caused a significant increase of renin secretion, together with a significant increase in renal blood flow. This renin hypersecretion is not accompanied by any significant alteration in renal perfusion pressure, kalemia or natriuresis. The role of intrarenal dopaminergic receptors has been studied: (a) Haloperidol (intrarenal perfusion of 50 mug/kg/min for 20 min) suppresses the renal vasodilation and renin hypersecretion induced by dopamine. (b) Propranolol (intrarenal perfusion of 1 mg/kg in 15 min, then of 4 mg/kg/hr) alters neither the renal vasodilation nor the renin hypersecretion induced by dopamine. These observations support the assumption that the dopaminergic receptors are brought into play in the two renal responses to dopamine studied by us.", 
    "27": "The influence of intravenous injections or infusions of insulin (0-2 i.u./kg), propranolol (150 mg), 3,5-dimethylpyrazole (3 mg/kg), 3,5-dimethylisoxazole (0-08 mg/kg), glucose (0-5 g/kg), nicotinic acid (120 mg/kg), arginine (0-5 g/kg) or butyrate (0-5 mmol/kg) on plasma glucose levels, and on serum concentrations of growth hormone and free fatty acids of lactating cows was investigated. In all of these experiments we noted an increase in the level of growth hormone. This increase was not a direct consequence of alterations in the glucose concentration, since the growth hormone peak occurred both during a decrease (insulin, 3,5-dimethylisoxazole, nicotinic acid and butyrate tests), and during an increase of the glucose level (glucose, arginine and propranolol tests), whereas the glucose concentration remained unchanged during the 3,5-dimethylpyrazole experiments. However, in each instance a precipitous fall of the free fatty acid level was noted. The glucose, growth hormone, and free fatty acid levels of lactating cows were not affected by either i.v. injection or infusion of saline.", 
    "28": "Regulation of lipolysis by the sympathetic nervous system, basal insulin, and glucagon was studied in fasted baboons. Beta-Adrenergic mechanisms were evaluated by blockade with propranolol after 24, 40, and 65 h of fasting. Inhibition of lipolysis decreased with increasing duration of fasting. Insulin concentrations were markedly reduced by propranolol at all stages of fasting, whereas glucose and glucagon concentrations were unchanged. The roles of insulin and glucagon were evaluated by a 2-h infusion of somatostatin after 18 and 65 h of fasting. At both times, insulin and glucagon concentrations were markedly reduced. At 18 h of fasting but not at 65 h, lipolysis doubled. At both times the plasma glucose concentration fell 15-30%. At 18 h, preventing the decrease in glucose with glucose infusion prevented the increase in lipolysis. These data suggest that a beta-adrenergic mechanism is largely responsible for regulation of lipolysis early in fasting and that insulin, glucagon, and beta-adrenergic mechanisms play no major part in the maintenance of the accelerated lipolysis later in fasting.", 
    "29": "In a patient with idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis, syncope developed as a result of a sustained decrease in aortic pressure induced by severe cough paroxysms. Treatment with propranolol was effective in abolishing the syncopal episodes, by reducing the post-tussive gradient and facilitating a more rapid return to normal of aortic pressure. Post-tussive syncope in IHSS may result from both an unusually strong cough paroxysm and augmented left ventricular outflow obstruction consequent to reflex sympathetic stimulation.", 
    "30": "Practolol, a recent and more selective beta-adrenergic receptor blocking drug, was given orally as a single dose of 200 mg to seven healthy volunteers and to six patients suffering from severe renal impairment and submitted to the long-term hemodialysis program. The plasma drug decay was markedly slowed and the plasma half-life was prolonged sixfold in the uremic patients in comparison to healthy volunteers. Hemodialysis (8 hours) starting 48 hours after drug intake lowered plasma practolol significantly but transiently. The shorter half-life during hemodialysis and the detection of equally high values of practolol in the ultrafiltrates as in the plasma demonstrate that this drug is readily removable from the plasma. However, the ascending slope of the plasma drug concentration curve which appeared following hemodialysis is suggestive of an incomplete drug removal from the body.", 
    "31": "Physical exercise in rats provokes an increase in plasma glucagon and free fatty acid concentrations. The persistence of exercise-induced glucagon stimulation in adrenodemedullated animals and conversely, its inhibition by immunosympathectomy, (-)-ropranolol, and pindolol substantiate the conclusion that stimulation of the alpha2 cells in exercise involves sympathetic stimulation of the beta-adrenergic receptors. The reduction of free fatty acid mobilization by immunosympathectomy and (-)-propranolol and its persistence after adrenodemedullation suggest that it is similarly mediated, at least in part, by adipose cell beta-sympathetic receptors.", 
    "32": "Isolated cardiac muscle techniques and studies of the chronically instrumented fetal lamb heart were employed to evaluate the ability of fetal myocardium to exhibit poststimulation potentiation. Isometric tension development and the response to paired electrical stimulation were significantly reduced in isolated fetal ventricular myocardium when compared to the adult (P less than 0.001). As in the adult, increasing stimulation frequency raised fetal isometric tension via an increase in the rate of rise of tension development in the presence of reduction in time-to-peak tension. In seven fetal lambs the left ventricle was chronically instrumented with endocardial ultrasonic crystals and a high-fidelity micromanometer. After a 2-wk recovery period, heart rate was increased by atrial pacing from an average control level of 150 to 300 beats/min. Left ventricular dP/dt increased progressively and then fell beyond a heart rate of 270/min. When comparable pre- and immediate postpacing beats were analyzed, a step-wise increase in the velocity of left ventricular shortening and the mean rate of circumferential fiber shortening was observed in association with an increase in the extent of shortening. Thus, increases in the frequency of contraction exert a significant positive inotropic effect on the fetal heart.", 
    "33": "The sympathomimetic amines isoproterenol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and phenylephrine are structural derivatives of beta-phenylethylamine and have proportionately different effects on alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors. Chick embryos in ovo were each administered a single dose of one of these compounds at concentrations ranging from 0.4 times 10(-9) to 20 times 10(-9) mol/5 mul saline during Hamburger and Hamilton stages 20-27. In other experiments embryos were pretreated with the beta-antagonist propranolol and subsequently administered isoproterenol. 743 cardiovascular anomalies were produced. The production of cardiovascular anomalies was proportional to the degree of beta-adrenergic activity of each drug. The frequency of anomalies was significantly reduced by pretreatment with propranolol. At all concentrations tested the anomaly rate was greater in chick embryos receiving an experimental compound than in controls. The general types of anomalies included aortic arch defects, ventricular septal defect, double outlet right ventricle, aortic hypoplasia, and truncus arteriosus. These results demonstrate that activation of the beta-adrenergic receptor mechanism is directly related to the cardiovascular anomalies produced in the chick embryos.", 
    "34": "The clinical course of a 9 year old black male with Bartter's syndrome who has been followed since age 1 1/2 years is presented. He had been unable to conserve sodium on a low salt diet and has failed to show improvement in serum electrolytes while on a sodium loading regimen. He is now refractory to spironolactone and KCI therapy, even in conjunction with supplemental sodium. On two separate trials his electrolytes have approached normal with the combination of propranolol and spironolactone along with KCI and NaCl supplementation. However, his response to this regimen has been a temporary one with relapse to the pretreatment chemical status despite increasing doses of propranolol and potassium chloride.", 
    "35": "Beta adrenergic blockade has been suggested to improve the myocardial oxygen balance during ischemic conditions. This investigation was undertaken to examine the effects of practolol, a relatively cardiospecific beta adrenergic blocking agent, on regional myocardial dimensions and shortening during acute coronary arterial occlusion in dogs. Local myocardial dimensions were measured ultrasonically in ischemic and nonischemic regions of the left ventricle. Myocardial dilatation and marked reduction in systolic shortening occurred in ischemic regions after occlusion, whereas nonischemic regions were only moderately dilated. Administration of 10 to 20 mg of practolol exerted different effects in the two ventricular regions; myocardial dilatation was reduced and the systolic shortening increased by practolol in ischemic regions, whereas further dilatation and diminished shortening occurred in nonischemic control regions. Similar results were obtained when heart rate was kept constant by atrial pacing during beta adrenergic blockade. Thus, practolol improved the function in ischemic ventricular regions, and restored ventricular stroke volume to preocclusion levels, probably as a result of improved myocardial oxygen balance.", 
    "36": "The cariac response to anesthetic doses of ketamine hydrochloride was studied in dogs, initially in the absence of other drugs and subsequently during beta adrenergic block with propranolol and combined beta adrenergic and cholinergic blockade with propranolol and atropine. Ketamine (4 mg/kg) was injected into the left atrium or the jugular vein. Administration of ketamine alone resulted in increases in heart rate (61 beats/min, P smaller than .001), cardiac output and left ventricular systolic pressure, but left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and dP/dt max (maximum rate of change of left ventricular isovolumic pressure development) were unchanged. After propranolol, the increase in heart rate produced by ketamine was attenuated, and a transient fall in dP/dt max occurred. After propranolol and atropine, heart rate was not changed by ketamine, but dP/dt max fell and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure rose. Systemic vascular resistance was not altered by ketamine. It is concluded that administration of ketamine increases sympathetic discharge and reduces vagal discharge to the heart. In the absence of sympathetic and vegal control over the heart, the drug depresses myocardial contractility.", 
    "37": "The contribution of the intrapulmonary lobar veins to the increase in pulmonary vascular resistance in response to sympathetic stimulation was studied under conditions of controlled blood flow in the anesthetized dog in which vascular pressures were measured simultaneously in the perfused lobar artery, an intrapulmonary lobar vein 2-3 mm in diameter and in the left atrium. Stimulation of the stellate ganglia at 3, 10, and 30 cycles/s increased pressure in the lobar artery and small vein in a stimulus-related manner but decreased pressure in the left atrium. Injection of norepinephrine into the perfused lobar artery also increased pressure in the lobar artery and small vein but decreased pressure in the left atrium. The increase in lobar arterial and venous pressure in response to either injected norepinephrine or to nerve stimulation was antagonized by an alpha receptor blocking agent. The rise in pressure in both labor artery and small vein with nerve stimulation but not administered norepinephrine was inhibited by an adrenergic nerve terminal blocking agent. The results suggest that under conditions of steady flow, sympathetic nerve stimulation increases the resistance to flow in the lung by constricting pulmonary veins and vessels upstream to the small veins, and that at each stimulus-frequency studied approximately 50% of the total increase in resistance may be due to venoconstriction. It is concluded that the increase in resistance to flow in the lung in response to nerve stimulation is thre result of activation of alpha adrenergic receptors by norephinephrine liberated from adrenergic nerve terminals in venous segments and in vessels upstream to samll veins, presumed to be small arteries.", 
    "38": "The influence of acute myocardial depression on ventricular stiffness and on its elastic and viscous components was studied in 19 dogs. After the animals were placed on cardiopulmonary bypass, stiffness was measured by sinusoidally injecting volume changes of 0.5 ml (deltaV) at 22 Hz into paced, isovolumically (deltaP) of the sinusoidal pressure response. Stiffness was linearly related to pressure (P) throughout the cardiac cycle, so that deltaP/delta V = alpha P + beta, where alpha and beta are constants. Myocardial depression was induced in one of three different ways: by coronary artery ligation, by administration of propranolol (Inderal), or by administration of pentobarbital. All three interventions caused significant increases in the slope, alpha, of the stiffness-pressure relationship, while the intercept, beta, remained unchanged. Release of the coronary occlusion or administration of acetylstrophantidin partially reversed depression and the change in alpha; Approximation of the mechanical nature of the left ventricle in terms of a linear second-order mechanical system permitted the division of stiffness into its elastic and viscous components. Like total stiffness, both the elastic and the viscous components were linearly related to ventricular pressure. Elastic stiffness was not changed, but the slope of the line relating viscous stiffness to pressure was significantly increased during ischemic depression, indicating that a change in viscosity was primarily responsible for the increase in total ventricular stiffness.", 
    "39": "The variability of plasma propranolol concentrations has been determined in a large group of patients being treated with the drug. Although the average patient achieved a therapeutic plasma level with 160 mg/day, there was marked interpatient variation. This was found to be primarily the result of differences in effective absorption of the drug, which averaged 46% of the oral dose but ranged from 20 to 80%. Propranolol disappeared from plasma with a half-life of 4.7 hours and its removal appeared to follow dose independent kinetics with no evidence of saturation of hepatic metabolism. The derived pharmacokinetic values of volume of distribution and clearance rate have been used to provide guidelines for initiating propranolol therapy intravenously, and the schedule of 8 mg as a loading dose and 0.02 mg/min as a sustaining dose has been suggested.", 
    "40": "Electrophysiological studies utilizing His bundle recordings and atrial extra-stimulus technique were performed in 17 patients (pts) with documented paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) before and after 0.01 mg/kg, i.v., ouabain. Before ouabaine, echozones(EZ) were demonstrated in 11 patients. After ouabain, EZ were abolished in two, decreased in five, unchanged in three, and increased in one. In one patient, EZ was demonstrated only after ouabain. Eleven patients could sustain PSVT before ouabain; after ouabain, only six patients could sustain PSVT. Analysis of A1-A2, H1-H2 curves revealed 11 patients with discontinous (dual pathway) and six patients with smooth conduction curves. In dual pathway patients, both the fast and slow pathway curves were shifted rightward and upward after ouabain. The changes in EZ were dependent upon the relative rightward shifts of the two pathways. In patients with smooth curves, EZ tended to shift rightward with a critical A-H being achieved at longer A1-A2 intervals after ouabain. In conclusion, the effects of ouabain on PSVT were variable. Beneficial effects included abolition or decrease of EZ and loss of the ability to sustain PSVT. Potentially deleterious effects included widening or new de-elopment of EZ.", 
    "41": "A cardiogenic hypertensive chemoreflex was studied in 38 anesthetized and three unanesthetized dogs. Serotonin (100 mug/ml) injected into either the left atrium or small brancehes of the proximal left coronary artery produced a maximal response, with 96 +/- 18 mm Hg increment in mean aortic pressure within 6 +/- 2 seconds, lasting about 1 min; a later phase of the same hypertension lasted 9 +/- 5 minutes more and could partially be produced with serotonin injected into the thoracic aorta. Injections into the distal left coronary artery produced only the Bezold-Jarisch reflex. Concomitant with the immediate hypertension there were vagal and sympathetic efferent effects in both the sinus node and the atrioventricular (A-V) junction. Either of these effects could be selectively eliminated and the other augmented by direct local perfusion with an appropriate cholinergic (atropine 10 mug/ml) or adrenergic beta-receptor (propranolol 10 mug/ml) blocking agent. Bilateral vagotomy markedly attenuated but did not eliminate the acute hypertension, but it abolished both chronotropic and dromotropic effects. Phentolamine (2 mg/min i.v.) markedly diminished the hypertensive response. Guanethidine or reserpine pretreatment markedly diminished the hypertensive response; reserpine eliminated the electrophsiologic effects but guanethidine did not. Infiltration of serotonin around the main left coronary partially reproduced the reflex, but similar infiltration of xylocaine hydrochloride blocked the reflex. Serial section histologic studies of the region around the main left coronary atery in seven dog hearts and nine human hearts demonstrated the presence of a small structure resembling a chemoreceptor; its blood supply originated from the left coronary artery. Some possible clinical implications are discussed.", 
    "42": "The Bainbridge reflex, i.e., the effect of rapid saline infusion (1.1 +/- 0.1 liters) on heart rate and arterial and atrial blood pressures, was examined in 12 intact conscious dogs; mean arterial blood pressure rose by 33 +/- 3 (SE) mm Hg, mean atrial pressure by 14 +/- 1 mm Hg, and heart rate by 75 +/- 9 beats/min. After beta-receptor blockade, heart rate rose slightly less (+49 +/- 5 beats/min, P = 0.05). Cholinergic blockade, combined cholinergic and beta-receptor, or beta-receptor blockade after vagotomy blocked the heart rate response to the infusion. The rise in heart rate in the face of an increase in arterial blood pressure with volume loading suggested that the arterial baroreceptor reflex was not responding appropriately to the increase in arterial blood pressure. In conscious dogs after denervation of the arterial baroreceptors, the increase in heart rate with volume loading was no greater than that in those dogs with their arterial baroreceptors intact, suggesting that the baroreceptor reflex was not restraining heart rate in the normal response to volume loading. The relationship between the pulse interval (PI) and the systolic arterial blood pressure (SAP) following an intravenous injection of methoxamine was used to evaluate the sensitivity of the baroreceptor reflex in intact conscious dogs. After a mild amount of volume loading, when atrial pressure was 8 +/- 2 mm Hg, the PI/SAP slope was significantly depressed from normal. When atrial pressure was elevated further to 28 +/- 1 mm Hg by volume loading, the slope was further depressed. Thus, arterial baroreflex sensitivity is reduced progressively as atrial pressure is raised by volume loading, an observation that explains how heart rate can rise strikingly in the face of an elevated arterial blood pressure.", 
    "43": "Veratrum alkaloids injected into the coronary circulation stimulate myocardial receptors to produce reflex bradycardia and arterial hypotension (the Bezold-Jarisch reflex). This study investigated the hypothesis that parasympathetic coronary vasodilation occurs as part of the Bezold-Jarisch reflex. Blood flow in the circumflex coronary artery was measured in chloralose-anesthetized, closed-chest dogs with a newly developed cannula-tip flow transducer. Alpha-receptor blockade with Dibozane (2 mg/kg) was used to prevent peripheral vasodilation, and beta-receptor blockade with propranolol (1 mg/kg) was used to prevent adrenergic cardiac effects. Electrical pacing was used to maintain a constant heart rate. Under these conditions, veratridine injected into the anterior descending coronary artery but not into the circumflex coronary artery produced a 63% increase in circumflex coronary blood flow and an 88% increase in diastolic coronary conductance. The effect was abolished when the reflex arc was interrupted by either vagotomy or atropine administration. It is concluded that a cardiocoronary reflex parasympathetic coronary vasodilation can be elicited by stimulating cardiac receptors with veratridine.", 
    "44": "Continous bedrest for 5 to 14 days had no significant effect on resting heart rate, blood pressure or cardiac output in six normal men. Head-up tilt induced greater tachycardia in 5 of 6 patients after bed rest than in the control period. Propranolol diminished both the tachycardia and the incidence of hypotension and faintness in upright posture. Body weight, serum electrolytes and resting renal plasma flow, and glomerular filtration rate were unchanged by bedrest. Plasma volume fell, extracellular fluid volume increased, and plasma renin activity was significantly elevated following bedrest. Unusually large increases in plasma renin followed head-up tilt or administration of isoproterenol during bedrest, and after resuming normal activity. During bedrest, plasma aldosterone was often increased in the early morning. We conclude that after bedrest, upright posture evokes strong beta-adrenergic activity, with exaggerated metabolic and circulatory responses which can be reduced or abolished by the beta-adrenergic blocker, propranolol.", 
    "45": "In a prospective study to evaluate surgery for angina pectoris, 50 patients randomized to surgery and 50 treated medically have completed 8 to 34 months' follow-up (median, 24 months). Anginal symptoms improved in both groups (88%, 72%), but more operated patients are currently asymptomatic (70%, 8%) and using fewer medications (nitrates, 18%, 96%; propranolol, 8%, 72% of patients). Exercise tests with treadmill revealed increased exercise tolerance time in both groups, more so in the operated group (+ 89%, + 42%), and angina could not be provoked in 70% and 20% of patients, respectively. During the follow-up, fewer cardiac complications developed in the operated group (19 vs. 44; P = less than 0.02); there was no difference in mortality. Repeat catheterization in 83 of 84 survivors at 1 year did not reveal any significant differences in the progression of disease. Atrial pacing studies revealed improvement in anginal threshold in 70% of operated and 48% of nonoperated patients. The study suggests that although subjective and objective improvement occurs with surgical as well as nonsurgical treatment, the frequency and magnitude are higher with surgery. The quality of life appears to be better in the operated patients during the first 24 months. Further follow-up is necessary to determine the duration of such improvement and to assess the influence of surgery on the natural life history of this disease.", 
    "46": "Normal dogs were injected i.v. with a single dose of 0.25 mg/kg sodium salt of HB 419 (Glibenclamide). Plasma insulin and glucose concentrations were measured at stated intervals over a period of two hours. The rise in insulin, but not the hypoglycemic response was abolished in peripheral blood when the animals were pretreated with a single i.v. injection of either 0.1 mg/kg or 0.3 mg/kg dl-propranolol, 30 min prior to the administration of HB 419. The d-isomer of propranolol was ineffective in this respect. These results indicate that a) the mechanism by which propranolol inhibits sulphonylurea-stimulated insulin secretion involves beta adrenergic receptors; and b) the hypoglycemia produced by HB 419 in the presence of propranolol could be the result of extrapancreatic effects. Since the possibility of an early rise in the insulin concentration of portal blood was not excluded in our present series of experiments, final proof will have to be provided by studies in totally pancreatectomized dogs.", 
    "47": "Large doses of doxepin given intravenously to animals cause tachyarrhythmias, and still higher doses lead to a progressive and, finally, lethal bradycardia. The effect of pretreatment with five different beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs (propranolol, alprenolol, practolol, metoprolol or tolamolol), p physostigmine, or atropine on these toxic actions of doxepin was investigated. Mice were sedated with diazepam. Doxepin was injected i.v. 0.1 mg every 15 sec until death. ECG was recorded at 10 sec after every injection. All five beta-blockers injected i.p. 30 min before doxepin inhibited the doxepin-induced tachyarrhythmias. None of the drugs prevented or postponed the death of mice. Large doses of beta-blockers dose-dependently enhanced the doxepin-induced bradycardia and accelerated death. The cardioselective beta-blocking drugs practolol and metoprolol proved less active in enhancing bradycardia than the third cardio-selective drug, tolamolol, and non-selective propranolol and alprenolol. This difference may have resulted from properties other than beta-blockade since practolol and metoprolol lack the \"cardiodepressant\" and local anaesthetic properties. Since physostigmine and atropine did not modify the doxepin effects the anticholinergic property may not be important in the severe cardiotoxic effects of doxepin.", 
    "48": "Labour pains associated with fear and anxiety increase the blood level of catecholamines. This in turn causes dysfunctional labour due to the weak uterine contractions which follow stimulation of uterine adrenergic beta receptors. Intravenous propranolol was administered to ten primigravidae with typical dysfunctional labour. This was shortly followed by normal uterine activity and delivery without any significant maternal or fetal complications. To the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt to treat dysfunctional labour by the intravenous administration of a beta-blocking agent, and our preliminary results are encouraging.", 
    "49": "In 21 healthy male persons haemodynamic changes (heart rate, end-diastolic pulmonary artery pressure, training condition of heart, a so-called index of heart sufficiency and arterial blood pressure) at rest and during dynamic exercise were compared respectively before and after i.v. injection of 0.0375 mg/kg of the beta-adrenergic blocking drug K+5Ao 1366 [O-(2-hydroxy-3-(tert. butylamino)-propoxy)-benzonitril-hydrochloride], of 0.3 mg/kg practolol [4-(2-hydroxy-3-isopropylaminopropoxy)-acetanilide] and a placebo. According to the analysed parameters K\u00f6 1366 has an essentially better beta-adrenergic blocking potency than practolol. Neither of the two substances has a negative inotropic effect or influences the arterial blood pressure.", 
    "50": "The myocardial content of 45Ca++ in conscious rats is increased by single s.c. injections of sympathomimetics. A dose dependent inhibition of this effect is achieved by simultaneous administration of calcium antagonists or beta-receptor blocking agents. The myocardial 45Ca++ content of conscious rats is increased by i.v. administration of dibutyrylcycloadenosinemonophosphate (DBcAMP). The effect of the cyclic nucleotide is suppressed only by a calcium antagonist but not by a beta-receptor blocker. The following conclusions may be drawn: 1. Calcium antagonists and beta-sympatholytics have different sites of action in the heart. 2. The lack of DBcAMP-antagonism of the beta-sympatholytics permits a simple discrimination between both types of substances. After pretreatment with sympathomimetics for 7 days (0.3 mg/kg isoprenaline s.c.), neither high doses of isoprenaline nor doses of DBcAMP and aminophylline increased the myocardial 45Ca content in rats. This effect only lasted briefly (for about two weeks); the site of its action is so far unknown.", 
    "51": "The contraction of the rat detrusor muscle caused by electrical stimulation of the hypogastric or pelvic nerves was followed by relaxation when the nerves were stimulated for a short period. The relaxation was more pronounced when the initial contraction was reduced by atropine. It was found to be mediated by adrenergic fibres acting on inhibitory beta2-receptors. Stimulation of the hypogastric or pelvic nerves at high frequencies increased the contractile response probably via adrenergic fibres activating excitatory alpha-receptors.", 
    "52": "To study the relative importance of cardiac and peripheral effector mechanisms in the carotid sinus baro-reflex in man cardiovascular responses to equal changes of the carotid sinus transmural pressure (Ptm) in either direction of the normal were recorded and compared in eight physically well-trained young male volunteers. In both the supine and the 70 degrees head-up position, a decrease in Ptm produced a more potent reflex response of the systemic arterial pressure than did a similar increase in Ptm. Whereas the arterial pressure response to increased Ptm was due solely to a reduction in vascular resistance, a significant increase in cardiac output contributed to the more potent pressor response to a decrease in Ptm and thus to the predominantly antihypotensive properties that characterize the carotid sinus baroreceptor control system in man. However, since combined beta-adrenergic and parasympathetic blockade abolished the effect of reduced Ptm on cardiac output without greatly impairing the blood pressure response, it is concluded that adjustments in cardiac output are not of critical importance in the buffering function of the carotid sinus baroreceptors. Autonomic cardiac blockade exaggerated the fall in cardiac output on head-up tilt, the arterial pressure remaining unaffected due to a compensatory increase in systemic vascular resistance.", 
    "53": "Self-stimulation behavior in rats was facilitated by two adrenergic stimulants, amphetamine (0.5 or 1 mg/kg, intraperitoneal, i.p., or 100 mug, intracerebroventricular, i.c.v.) and cocaine (5 mg/kg, i.p.). Three alpha-adrenergic blockers (phenoxybenzamine, dibenamine, phentolamine) and a beta-adrenergic blocker (propranolol) decreased self-stimulation responding at 100 mug i.c.v. doses, but showed very little effect at small i.p. doses. Pretreatment with alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockers (i.c.v.) also decreased amphetamine-facilitated responding. The effects of amphetamine or cocaine (i.p.) were not significantly altered by these blockers at the doses used. The depressant effects of the alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockers on self-stimulation behavior appear to be nonspecific with respect to the type of adrenergic receptors.", 
    "54": "To study the effects of acute uremia on the inotropic state of the rat heart, we subjected rats to bilateral nephrectomy and studied their hearts in the open chest 24 h later. Uremic rats had significantly higher systolic blood pressure than sham-operated animals. Left ventricular systolic pressure and maximum dP/dt, both during ejection and isovolumic contrations, were higher for any given end-diastolic pressure in hearts of uremic rats than in sham-operated animals. This difference in performance charcteristics was not abolished by doses of propranolol that blocked the heart rate response to isoproterenol. The administration of phenoxybenzamine during the 24 h of uremia abolished the blood pressure rise in uremic rats, but the increased contractile state persisted. Treatment of sham-operated animals with methoxamine to produce the same course of blood pressure as observed in uremic rats was also associated with an increased inotropic state. These results indicate that in the rat, acute uremia is associated with an increased inotropic state that is not mediated by beta-adrenergic mechanisms. The systolic hypertension of acute uremia is not the major cause of the increased contractility, although systolic hypertension without uremia can mimic the performance characteristics found in hearts of uremic rats.", 
    "55": "The effect of norepinephrine (NE) on the intracellular hydrogen ion concentration [H+]i of isolated rat hearts perfused with a modified Krebs-Henseleit solution (SHS) was determined. The [H+]i was calculated with the [14C]-dimethyloxazolidinedione method. Respiratory or metabolic acidosis was produced by equilibrating the KHS with 20% C02 or decreasing the [HC03-] of the KHS, respectively. Three types of experiments were carried out: 1) beta blockade--MJ 1999 (Sotalol) was added to the KHS; 2) control--no pharmacological treatment; and 3) NE-norepinephrine was added to the KHS. The effective CO2 buffer values (delta[HC03-]i/deltapHi) during respiratory acidosis were: beta blockade, 11; control, 35; and NE, 84. The production of metabolic acidosis resulted in the following [H+]i changes: beta blockade, 52 mM; control, 60 nM; and NE 7 nM. These results suggest that NE markedly attenuates the changes in [H+]i accompanying respiratory and metabolic acidosis and may account in part for previous observations that the effective C02 buffer value of cardiac muscle in vivo is greater than that in vitro.", 
    "56": "Inotropic responses to digoxin (0.08 mg/kg) were studied in dogs and compared with responses during hypoxemia and autonomic blockade. Changes in left ventricular contractility (VC) were assessed by constructing function curves relating left ventricular (dP/dt)max and stroke volume to end-diastolic pressure. Augmentation of VC was observed 20 min after digoxin infusion and continued to increase until termination of the experiment after 60 min. In animals subjected to autonomic blockade with practolol, TEAC, and atropine, the increases in VC after digoxin were substantially greater. Equally large increases occurred in blocked dogs during sustained hypoxia (Pao2 = 28 mmHg). However, in animals without blockade there was a progressive fall in VC during hypoxia despite digoxin infusion, although less than in those not given digoxin. Serum digoxin levels were measured by radioimmunoassay and did not differ significantly in blocked compared to unblocked dogs or in hypoxic compared to nonhypoxic animals. These findings indicate that digoxin protects the heart from the decrease in myocardial contractility which occurs during extended hypoxia. This protective effect is more pronounced in animals deprived of autonomic function, possibly reflecting the elimination of reflex sympathetic withdrawal ordinarily induced by digitalis.", 
    "57": "Intravenous infusion of blood (36 ml/kg body wt) elicited tachycardia in artificially ventilated anesthetized dogs with intact autonomic innervation and in dogs with cardiac beta-receptor blockade. In contrast, infusion elicited bradycardia in dogs with section of the spinal cord at C6-C7, and in dogs with combined spinal section and cardiac beta-receptor blockade. The control heart rate was less than or equal to 110 beats/min in all the animals. The presence of infusion-induced tachycardia in dogs with beta-receptor blockade, i.e., dogs in which cardiac sympathetic efferents were blocked, and its absence in dogs with combined spinal section and beta-receptor blockade, i.e., dogs in which spinal autonomic afferents plus cardiac sympathetic efferents were blocked, may be the result of an additional interruption of spinal autonomic afferents by spinal section. It is concluded that tachycardia elicited by infusion may be partly due to a reflex with its afferent pathway in the spinal cord and its efferent pathway in the vagus nerves.", 
    "58": "The influence on thyroid hormone secretion of the nonselective beta-adrenergic stimulant isoproterenol (IPNE), of a selective beta1-adrenergic stimulant, 1-isopropylamino-3-(2-thiazoloxy)-2-propanol (ITP), and of a selective beta2-adrenergic stimulant, terbutaline, was investigated in mice. A combination of light microscopy (colloid droplet formation) and bioassay (blood radioiodine--BRI--measurements) was used. IPNE and terbutaline induced formation of colloid droplets and increased BRI levels, whereas ITP was ineffective. The responses to IPNE and terbutaline were abolished or reduced by pretreatment with L-propranolol, but were not inhibited for pretreatment with D-propranolol or phentolamine. The results indicate that secretion of thyroid hormone can be induced through the mediation of beta2-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "59": "Data published by this laboratory indicated that the beta adrenergic blocking drugs timolol and propranolol exerted equivalent beta blocking and antihypertensive actions in patients with mild essential hypertension, but that whereas cardiac output fell acutely with both drugs, it returned to normal after 5 wk of treatment with timolol, but remained depressed after propranolol. This preliminary observation needed further confirmation in a larger series of patients. In this study, 11 patients with initial diastolic blood pressures between 90 and 125 mm Hg were given timolol for 5 wk. Hemodynamic measurements were made before and at the end of treatment. Mean heart rate fell from 76.8 to 64.3 bpm (p less than 0.001), and blood pressure was reduced from 179.4/99 mm Hg to 167.4/93.3 mm Hg (less than 0.02). Cardiac output averaged 6.29 L/min before timolol, and fell to 5.95 L/min (NS) after treatment. Stroke volume increased significantly, while total peripheral resistance was unchanged. These results confirm our earlier observations that timolol is an effective beta adrenergic blocking drug with antihypertensive action that does not reduce cardiac output significantly when given chronically. This drug merits further evaluation in other cardiovascular disorders since it may have advantages over other beta adrenergic blocking drugs.", 
    "60": "The changes elicited after ephedrine tachyphylaxis in the dog femoral and rabbit aortic strips isolated from the untreated and ephedrine pre-treated animals have been studied. In untreated strips, ephedrine exhibited dose-dependent contractions which were blocked by phenoxybenzamine. These contractile responses to ephedrine were reduced after pre-treatment with ephedrine in vivo. In rabbit aortic strips previously contracted with noradrenaline or KCL, ephedrine induced dose-dependent relaxations at high concentrations, which were not affected by propranolol. These relaxation responses were likewise diminished after ephedrine. Dose-related contractile responses to noradrenaline were potentiated at low concentrations and depressed at high concentrations after ephedrine whereas those to adrenaline were inhibited over the entire agonist range. Responses to KCL were not affected. These reductions in the responses to noradrenaline and adrenaline after treatment with ephedrine in vivo were inhibited by icreased calcium2+ concentration. From the results, it can be presumed that the observed changes in vascular responsiveness may be partially involved in the development of ephedrine tachyphylaxis.", 
    "61": "Two milliliters of a morphine sulfate solution (1 mg/ml) perfused selectively into the sinus node artery of five trained unanesthetized dogs caused an immediate brief sinus tachycardia followed by a delayed but prolonged sinus bradycardia. Beta-receptor blockade was achieved by selective perfusion of propranolol hydrochloride solution (10 mug/ml) into the sinus node artery and did not prevent the initial sinus tachycardia. Selective perfusion of the sinus node with atropine sulfate solution (1 mug/ml), however, did prevent morphine from causing further sinus rate increase. The immediate positive chronotropic action of morphine was thus attributable to a peripherally located vagolytic action. The exact opposite was true with regard to the delayed bradycardia; it was due to a centrally mediated generalized increase in vagal tone regularly elicited by morphine.", 
    "62": "The effects in man of adrenergic blocking agents on plasma insulin, glucagon, growth hormone, and lipid metabolism are reviewed. Whereas basal insulin may be slightly inhibited by beta- and enhanced by alpha-adrenergic blockade, more marked suppression may be achieved under circumstances of high exogenous or endogenous catecholamine stimulation. The relative effects of beta1 or combined beta 1 and beta2 blockers in man are unknown. Glucagon release is probably provoked by beta- and inhibited by alpha-stimulation in man. Muscle glycogenolysis is inhibited by propranolol, and under situations of hepatic glycogen depletion, clinical hypopglycemia may occur. This may also account for the failure of significant hyperglycemia to be observed in short-term experiments on fasting subjects in whom insulin release may be suppressed and glucagon release enhanced. Growth-hormone release is enhanced by beta-adrenergic blockade. Free fatty acid formation in vivo is inhibited by intravenous beta blockade, but the effects of oral administration on triglyceride production and lipoprotein profiles remain uncertain. The inter-relationships between the effects of adrenergic blockade at different sites of hormone and substrate release are unclear but may have important consequences in alteration in carbohydrate tolerance and lipid metabolism. The relative effects of beta-blocking drugs with differing specificity must be determined."
