Both phenoxybenzamine and propranolol significantly attenuated the hyperthermic effect of JTP-2942 on reserpine-induced hypothermia, although neither drug caused complete inhibition. A high dose of hexamethonium also significantly antagonized the hyperthermic effect of JTP-2942. The hyperthermic effect of JTP-2942 was almost abolished by adrenal demedullation. In mice with thiouracil-induced hypothyroidism, both thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and JTP-2942 significantly increased the rectal temperature. However, the increase induced by TRH was smaller in hypothyroid mice than in control mice, while the temperature increase induced by JTP-2942 was similar in both hypothyroid and control mice. These results suggest that the hyperthermic effect of JTP-2942 is mainly mediated by the adrenal gland and the autonomic nervous system. In addition, the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis does not regulate the hyperthermic effect of JTP-2942, unlike that of TRH.", 
    "1": "The effect of catecholamine depletion or blockade of dopaminergic or noradrenergic receptors on the neuropeptide Y immunoreactivity was studied in the rat brain cortex using immunohistochemical methods. Neuropeptide Y immunoreactive neurons were counted and the mean density of stained neurons per microscopic field was calculated. It was found that monoamine depletion by reserpine, the blockade of dopaminergic receptors by haloperidol or the specific D1 receptor blockade by SCH23390 caused a significant increase in the neuropeptide Y immunoreactivity in the cortex studied, after 24 h, evaluated as the density of immunoreactive neurons. No significant changes were observed after the blockade of alpha or beta adrenergic receptors (by phenoxybenzamine or propranolol, respectively). Specific D2 receptor blockade by sulpiride induced an insignificant increase only. The results suggest the existence of an inhibitory dopaminergic control of the neuropeptide Y content, mainly via D1 receptors, in neurons of the rat brain cortex.", 
    "2": "Central corticosteroid receptors play an important role in the regulation of the secretion of corticosterone. Although these receptors are thought to be regulated by circulating levels of corticosterone, there is evidence for direct neural control. For example, it has been shown that noradrenergic lesions can both increase and decrease corticosteroid receptors depending on the brain structure involved. In the present study, we investigated the role of different noradrenergic receptors in the rat, by examining the effect of the acute administration of agonists and antagonists of beta and alpha 1 noradrenergic receptors on hippocampal type I and type II corticosteroid receptor levels. The effects of these drugs were studied in adrenalectomized animals whose plasma levels of corticosterone were maintained in the physiological range by implantation of coritcosterone pellets. Our results show that the beta receptor agonist salbutamol (5 mg/kg) increased the number of type I and type II hippocampal corticosteroid receptors. This effect was blocked by the beta receptor antagonist propranolol (5 mg/kg), which had no effect on its own. In contrast, the alpha 1 receptor agonist phenylephrine (100 micrograms) reduced the number of type I and type II corticosteroid receptors, whereas the alpha 1 receptor antagonist prazosin (0.5 mg/kg) increased type I receptors. The effect of prazosin was attributed to an increase in the relative beta tonus resulting from blockade of alpha 1 receptors. Its effect was reversed by the simultaneous injection of the beta receptor antagonist propranolol. In conclusion, our results show that noradrenergic transmission can have both a facilitatory and an inhibitory action on central corticosteroid receptors by acting respectively on beta and alpha 1 noradrenergic receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "3": "On the basis of a previous report suggesting the effectiveness of the beta-adrenoceptor/5-HT1A antagonist pindolol to accelerate the antidepressant effect of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and to produce a therapeutic effect in drug-resistant depressed patients, these open studies were undertaken to further explore the safety and efficacy of this strategy. In a first study, nine untreated unipolar depressed patients were given the SSRI paroxetine (20 mg/day) together with pindolol (2.5 mg thrice daily). One patient stopped taking pindolol because of increased irritability after 3 days. One week later, seven patients had their Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression Score decreased by more than 50%. In a second study, 19 drug-resistant unipolar depressed patients (9 on paroxetine, 5 on sertraline, 3 on fluoxetine, and 2 on moclobemide) were also given pindolol at the same regimen and were assessed weekly. Two patients (one on sertraline, one on moclobemide) stopped taking pindolol also because of increased irritability after 2 and 3 days, respectively. After 1 week of pindolol addition, 10 patients had a more than 50% decrease of their depression score. By day 14, all of the patients had a score of 10 or less, with the exception of those on sertraline. Improvement was maintained in all patients for at least 28 days on this combination. The results of these studies indicate that pindolol is safe when used in combination with an SSRI or moclobemide. Given the positive results obtained in this second open trial in 28 patients, this treatment strategy should be tested under double-blind conditions to establish its efficacy.",

    "5": "Glucocorticoids (GCs) play a key role in the physiology of the hypothalamic-somatotroph axis, since these steroids enhance growth hormone (GH) gene transcription and increase GHRH receptor synthesis. However, GC excess inhibits normal growth in all species studied. This is mainly due to the impaired GH secretion observed during hypercortisolism, a situation in which GH responses to a number of stimuli, including GHRH, are blunted. The inhibitory effect of GCs on GH secretion seems to be dependent on enhanced hypothalamic SS secretion. Since SS release is stimulated by beta-adrenergic agonism we tested the possibility that GC inhibition of GH secretion would depend on increased beta-adrenoceptor activity in SS-producing neurons. The experimental design consisted in evaluating the GH response to GHRH in normal subjects after having induced hypercortisolism, with DEX, and blocking beta-adrenoceptors with propranolol (PRO). Moreover, to investigate the specificity of this mechanism, GHRH-induced GH release was tested after inducing hypercortisolism and enhancing alpha 2-adrenergic or muscarinic cholinergic tone, by giving clonidine (CLO) or pyridostigmine (PD), respectively. As expected, nocturnal DEX administration inhibited the GH response to GHRH. In this situation of hypercortisolism, both PRO and CLO, but not PD, were able to reverse the inhibitory effect of DEX on GHRH-elicited release. However, the potentiating effect of these drugs on the GHRH-induced GH secretion was only observed for PRO. These data confirm that GC excess inhibits GH release by increasing hypothalamic SS secretion, and that the mechanism is mediated by GC-induced enhanced beta-adrenergic responsiveness. Therefore, the defective GHRH secretion observed in chronic hypercortisolism must be a consequence of the continuous blockade that SS excess exerts on GHRH-producing neurons. Our postulate agrees with other data in the literature showing that GCs modulate the secretion of some hypothalamic peptides by changing the responsiveness of the producing neurons from alpha 2-adrenoceptors to that of beta-adrenoceptors.",

One child had incessant salvos of polymorphic ventricular arrhythmias and intermittent abnormal TU complexes suggestive of repolarisation abnormalities. The other had typical congenital long QT syndrome. Treatment was effective in three patients; two patients took a beta blocker alone and one took a beta blocker and low doses of amiodarone. One patient died suddenly, death being associated with sinus node dysfunction. In one patient with incessant ventricular arrhythmias treatment with a beta blocker, amiodarone, or Ic drugs was ineffective and always associated with proarrhythmia or syncope. He was not given further treatment and was asymptomatic despite having mild cardiomegaly.",

    "11": "We tested the hypothesis that serotonin activates phospholipase D (PLD) in cultured rat mesangial cells. The formation of phosphatidylethanol (PET) in ethanol was used as a measure of PLD activity. Serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] stimulated PET production, with an initial 10-fold increase in PET content within 15-30 s, followed by a decrease in PET to values only sixfold above baseline at 45-60 s. Thereafter, the values increased again at 5 min to a plateau 10-fold above baseline. The decrease in PET values, following the initial increase, was due to metabolism of PET, possibly by a phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase, which led to a 76% decrease in PET within 1 h. Inhibition of phosphohydrolase with propranolol increased the phosphatidic acid and decreased the 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) content of 5-HT-stimulated cells. Finally, exogenous PLD induced mesangial cell proliferation as well as increases in phosphatidic acid, PET, and DAG. We conclude that phosphatidic acid contributes to DAG formation in mesangial cells. Furthermore, we suggest that PLD is involved in 5-HT-mediated mesangial cell proliferation.", 
    "12": "Expression and functional properties of beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-ARs) were studied in rat collecting tubules isolated by microdissection. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction experiments demonstrated that the beta 1- and beta 2-AR mRNAs, but not the beta 3-subtype, are expressed in the cortical collecting duct (CCD). Quantitation of mRNAs, carried out using mutant RNAs as internal standards, further showed that beta 1- and beta 2-ARs transcripts are present at comparable amounts in CCD (3,000-4,000 copies/mm of tubular length), but reach 6-8 times lower levels in the outer medullary collecting duct (OMCD: beta 1, 480 +/- 180; beta 2, 590 +/- 110 copies/mm of tubular length). Functional studies, carried out in CCD, corroborated the expression of these two receptor subtypes. The rank order of potency of beta-agonists for stimulating adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation was isoproterenol > norepinephrine = epinephrine, and similar efficiencies were found for a beta 1- and a beta 2-antagonist to inhibit isoproterenol-dependent cAMP formation. Fura 2 fluorescence measurements revealed that isoproterenol (10 microM) induces a biphasic rise of intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), consisting of an initial fast increase (delta [Ca2+]i = 122 nM) followed by a plateau phase (delta [Ca2+]i = 58 nM). In the absence of basolateral Ca2+, the initial peak was still observed, suggesting intracellular Ca2+ release. Norepinephrine and epinephrine, as well as selective beta 1- and beta 2-agonists, also increased [Ca2+]i in CCD. Only slight [Ca2+]i variations were produced by isoproterenol in the OMCD (delta [Ca2+]i = 21 nM) and the cortical thick ascending limb (delta [Ca2+]i = 25 nM). These results show that both beta 1- and beta 2-ARs are expressed in the collecting tubule and that they predominate in the CCD. The two receptor subtypes contribute to cAMP accumulation induced by beta-agonists. They also trigger [Ca2+]i variations, indicating their possible coupling to several transduction pathways in the rat CCD.", 
    "13": "Although beta-adrenergic agonists are known to stimulate sodium transport in alveolar epithelial cells, the exact cellular mechanism involved in this process is unknown. We determined whether terbutaline, a beta-adrenergic agonist, modulated Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase in cultured rat alveolar type II cells by measuring the enzyme's activity via an adapted radiometric method. The assay conditions were optimized by evaluating permeabilization techniques and substrate concentrations for Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase measurement at maximum velocity enzyme reaction (Vmax). Terbutaline at 10(-2) M increased enzyme activity, with a maximal response at 15 min that was completely inhibited by 10(-2) M propranolol. This effect of terbutaline was dependent on the presence of serum as well as on the time the cells were in culture. The enhancement of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity was reproduced by 10(-3) M dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate and 5 x 10(-5) M forskolin. Neither 10(-4) M amiloride nor a sodium-free solution influenced the effect of terbutaline. Western blotting showed that terbutaline did not change the expression of the alpha 1-subunit of the enzyme, which is the predominant form in this cell type. We conclude that beta-adrenergic agonists can modulate Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity partially through adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate and this process is not secondary to an increase in intracellular sodium concentration.", 
    "14": "We determined the effects of isoproterenol (Iso) on parasympathetic neurotransmission in isolated equine trachealis strips by comparing the effects of Iso on the contractile response to electrical field stimulation (EFS) and acetylcholine (ACh), as well as by measuring EFS-induced ACh release. The interaction of Iso with muscarinic receptors and endogenous nitric oxide was also investigated. ACh release was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Iso (10(-7) M or greater) caused significantly more inhibition of EFS- than of ACh-induced contraction, an observation usually interpreted as evidence of prejunctional inhibition of ACh release. However, the latter conclusion was not supported by measurement of ACh release. Iso concentration dependently augmented ACh release, which was reversed by the beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI-118,551 but not by the beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist CGP-20,712A. Our results indicate that activation of beta 2-adrenoceptors augments ACh release. Moreover, the comparison of inhibitory effects on EFS- and ACh-induced contraction does not provide correct information about the prejunctional actions of beta-agonists. ACh release was increased more by atropine (10(-7) M) than by Iso (10(-6) M), indicating the predominance of prejunctional inhibitory muscarinic autoreceptors over excitatory beta 2-adrenoceptors. Additionally, we found that inhibition of nitric oxide synthase by NG-nitro-L-arginine did not affect either the cholinergic contractile response or ACh release in both the absence and presence of Iso.", 
    "15": "A dysfunction of the nonadrenergic noncholinergic inhibitory (NANCi) system has been invoked as a possible mechanism underlying or contributing to altered airway function. In the present study we assessed whether human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) infection affects the airways' neurally mediated contractile and relaxant (NANCi) responses in vitro. NANCi responses were studied on tracheal smooth muscle (TSM) segments obtained from young adult cotton rats, a well-established model for HRSV infection. To assess NANCi responses, TSM segments were removed and placed in tissue baths containing modified Krebs-Henseleit, atropine (1 x 10(-6) M) and propranolol (5 x 10(-6) M). After contraction with neurokinin A (1 x 10(-5) M), electrical field stimulation (EFS) was applied at stimulation frequencies ranging from 5 to 30 Hz. The NANCi responses were measured and expressed as the mean (+/- SE) percent relaxation. To evaluate neurally mediated contractile responses, full frequency response curves (0.5-30 Hz) to EFS were also performed. We found significantly decreased NANCi responses in TSM segments obtained from infected cotton rats (n = 12) compared with control animals (n = 9) (P < 0.002). Furthermore, the contractile responses to EFS were increased in infected animals compared with the control group (P = 0.0001). These findings demonstrate that HRSV infection leads to an enhanced contractile response to EFS and a significant decrease in NANCi response in cotton rat airways in vitro. This disruption of the neural control of airways may lead to the development of altered airway function.", 
    "16": "The mechanisms underlying catecholamine control of lipolysis were studied in rat white adipocytes from epididymal, retroperitoneal, and subcutaneous fat depots. Sensitivity of subcutaneous adipocytes to selective beta 3-adrenoceptor agonists was lower than that of internal adipocytes. beta 3-Adrenoceptor mRNA levels were lower in subcutaneous adipocytes. A decreased beta 1/beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated lipolysis was also observed in these adipocytes, and the number of beta 1/beta 2-adrenoceptors was lower than in the internal adipocytes. The number of alpha 2-adrenoceptors was higher in subcutaneous adipocytes without a marked difference in alpha 2-adrenoceptor-mediated antilipolysis between the depots. Subcutaneous adipocytes were also characterized by a lower maximal lipolytic response to drugs acting at different levels of the lipolytic cascade, suggesting differences at the postreceptor level. Lower hormone-sensitive lipase activity and mRNA levels in subcutaneous adipocytes were in agreement with the lipolysis data. These results suggest that the pattern of expression of the genes of the lipolytic pathway varies with the anatomic location of the fat depot.", 
    "17": "To determine possible contribution of nitric oxide (NO) to the stimulatory action of beta-adrenoceptor agonist on ciliary motility, we measured ciliary beat frequency (CBF) of rabbit cultured tracheal epithelial cells by photoelectric method and NO release by specific amperometric sensors for this molecule in vitro. Salbutamol increased CBF, an effect that was potentiated by superoxide dismutase. Pretreatment of cells with NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) attenuated the salbutamol-induced increase in CBF, causing a rightward displacement of the concentration-response curve by 2-2.5 log units, whereas NG-nitro-D-arginine methyl ester had no effect. The inhibitory effect of L-NAME was reversed by L-arginine but not by D-arginine. Immersion of the NO-selective electrode in the medium containing epithelial cells detected baseline current of 4.6-14.5 pA, which was abolished by L-NAME. Salbutamol dose-dependently increased the concentration of NO in the medium, the maximal increase being 56.2 +/- 5.3 nM (mean +/- SE; P < 0.001). These results suggest that NO is spontaneously released by airway epithelium and that the enhanced release of this molecule may play a role in the beta-adrenoceptor-mediated stimulation of ciliary motility.", 
    "18": "The effect of topical 0.5% timolol on the microcirculation in albino rabbit optic nerve head (ONH) tissue was examined using a laser speckle microcirculation analyser. In the first experiment, normalized blue (NB) in ONH, a quantitative index of peripheral blood flow in ONH, intraocular pressure (IOP), blood pressure (BP) and pulse rate (PR) were measured under general anesthesia before, and 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after a 20 microliters instillation of timolol in one eye and a placebo in the other eye in a masked randomized manner. In the second experiment, one eye of another group of rabbits received timolol twice daily for 20 days and a placebo in the fellow eye in a randomized masked manner. The NB in ONH and IOP were measured before treatment and 2 hours after the last instillation on the 20th day. After a single instillation of timolol, PR showed a maximum reduction of 11% and the IOP in the timolol-treated eyes showed a maximum decrease of 18%, but the NB in ONH and BP did not show any significant change during the experiment. After the 20-day treatment, IOP showed a maximum decrease of 28% in the timolol-treated eyes and 17% in the placebo-treated eyes. The NB in the timlol-treated eyes increased significantly (p < 0.01), but in the placebo-treated eyes it showed no significant change. Thus, the long-term use of topical timolol may increase peripheral blood flow in ONH tissue in the living rabbit eye.", 
    "19": "Because of uncertainties regarding the complete antihypertensive mechanism of action of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, the present study determined whether vagal afferent neurons of humans and rats possess beta-adrenoceptors. Such a location would provide an appropriate target for beta-blockers to modulate neurotransmission of barosensitive neurons, thereby affecting blood pressure.

Index for vagal tone was calculated as % successive RR interval differences > 6%. Twenty-nine (28%) of the 102 patients developed atrial fibrillation or flutter. Independent predictors (90% confidence interval) of postoperative atrial fibrillation or flutter were identified by logistic regression analysis: the independent predictors were older age, relative risk 1.07.year-1 (1.02-1.12), vagal index < 10%, relative risk 4.50 (1.40-14.5), > or = 10 ectopic supraventricular beats . 24 h-1, relative risk 3.03 (1.05-8.72), and one or more events of non-sustained supraventricular tachycardia, relative risk 3.02 (1.11-8.22). Thus, age of the patient, attenuated pre-operative cardiac vagal modulation, ectopic supraventricular beats, and paroxysmal non-sustained supraventricular tachycardia are independent risk factors for the development of atrial fibrillation or flutter after coronary artery bypass surgery.", 
    "28": "1. We have investigated the mechanism of bradykinin (BK)-induced plasma extravasation into the knee joint of the anaesthetized rat. Accumulation of [125I]-human serum albumin within the synovial cavity was used as a marker of increased vascular permeability. 2. Perfusion with BK (1 microM) produced significant plasma extravasation into the knee which was inhibited by co-perfusion of the selective bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist D-Arg-[Hyp3,Thi5,D-Tic7,Oic8]-bradykinin (Hoe 140, 200 nM). 3. The bradykinin B1 receptor agonist, [des-Arg9]-BK (up to 100 mM), did not induce plasma extravasation into the knee joint, over this time period. 4. Chemical sympathectomy by chronically administered 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) did not inhibit bradykinin-induced plasma extravasation. Acute intra-articular perfusion with 6-OHDA (to stimulate transmitter release from sympathetic nerve terminals) at concentrations up to 50 mM did not induce significant plasma extravasation. Intra-articular perfusion of 100 mM 6-OHDA induced significant plasma extravasation but produced severe systemic toxicity. 5. The selective neurokinin1 (NK1) receptor antagonist, RP67580 (230 nmol kg-1), or receptor antagonists for the mast cell products histamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine did not significantly inhibit BK-induced plasma extravasation. 6. Co-perfusion of the NO synthase inhibitor, NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) (1 mM) did not significantly inhibit the response to BK. 133Xe clearance from L-NAME (1 mM)-injected joints was significantly (P < 0.05) reduced compared to D-NAME injected joints, suggesting a reduction in blood flow as a result of decreased basal NO production. Systemic administration of L-NAME at doses sufficient to produce significant and sustained elevation of blood pressure (5 or 30 mg kg-1, i.v. 15 min prior to BK perfusion) also failed to significantly inhibit the BK-induced response.7 We conclude that, in normal joints, BK induces plasma extravasation by acting on bradykinin B2 receptors and that this response is not dependent on secondary release of mediators from sympathetic nerve terminals, sensory nerves, mast cells or on generation of NO.", 
    "29": "1. We have used the isolated buffer-perfused superior mesenteric arterial bed of the rat to assess the involvement of ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels in the vasorelaxant responses to beta-adrenoceptor agonists. 2. The vasorelaxant potencies of the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor agonist, isoprenaline, the beta 1-adrenoceptor agonist, dobutamine and the beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, terbutaline were all significantly (P < 0.05) reduced (isoprenaline, ED50 = 265 +/- 31 pmol v. 1.05 +/- 0.42 nmol; dobutamine, ED50 = 294 +/- 67 pmol v. 497 +/- 115 pmol; terbutaline, ED50 = 157 +/- 26 nmol v. 452 +/- 120 nmol) in the presence of the KATP-channel blocker, glibenclamide. 3. The presence of glibenclamide only weakly influenced the vasorelaxant properties of salbutamol, a beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, while those of verapamil, a beta-adrenoceptor-independent vasorelaxant, were unaffected. 4. In radioligand binding experiments, glibenclamide (1 nM-100 microM) did not displace any specific [3H]-dihydroalprenolol binding from rat beta-adrenoceptors. Therefore, glibenclamide does not bind to beta-adrenoceptors at the concentration used in the present investigation. 5. Vasorelaxant responses to dibutyryl cyclic AMP, the cell permeable analogue of cyclic AMP, were also unaffected by glibenclamide, indicating that the coupling of beta-adrenoceptors to KATP-channels occurs independently of the elevation of intracellular cyclic AMP. 6. We have shown that a significant element of the vasorelaxant responses to both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor activation involves the opening of KATP-channels. In conclusion, KATP-channels may play a physiological role in beta-adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilatation.", 
    "30": "The effects of MPC-1304, a new calcium channel blocker, on blood pressure, serum lipoproteins, and carbohydrate metabolism were compared with those of atenolol in a group of patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Systolic and diastolic pressures were significantly decreased by both MPC-1304 and atenolol administration. Serum levels of apolipoproteins A-I and A-II were significantly increased after 8-12 weeks of MPC-1304 treatment, but were unchanged during a similar period of atenolol treatment. Neither drug induced any significant change in other lipoprotein parameters, fasting blood sugar, immunoreactive insulin, C-peptide or HbA1c. No serious side-effects or abnormal laboratory values were observed during the course of administration of either drug. These findings indicated that MPC-1304 is as efficacious as an antihypertensive drug and is without adverse effect on lipoprotein or carbohydrate metabolism.", 
    "31": "Cardiac and vascular function is mainly under autonomic nervous control within seconds to minutes, although the control is not mature at birth. We studied sympathovagal control of heart rate and blood pressure in chronically catheterized foetal lambs in the last trimester of gestation. Power spectral analysis was used to quantitate the frequency-specific heart rate variability (HRV) and blood pressure variability. We performed 15 experiments in seven foetal lambs. These preliminary studies showed that parasympathetic blockade by atropine (eight experiments) had no significant effect on the distribution of HRV to different frequencies. Beta-sympathetic blockade by propranolol (seven experiments) decreased the ratio of low and mid to high frequency (0.025-0.13 to 0.13-1.00 Hz) HRV (P = 0.02). The increased high frequency HRV in the absence of a similar increase in blood pressure variability and tracheal pressure variability suggests enhanced baroreflex responsiveness after propranolol administration. The frequency-specific sympathetic control of HRV in foetal lambs, the change in ratio of low and mid to high frequency HRV, might have clinical implications in estimating the level of foetal sympathetic activation in the follow-up of high-risk pregnancies.", 
    "32": "We examined 20 patients undergoing coronary bypass grafting for coronary artery disease with NYHA classifications of II and III who had been treated with beta-blocking agents. Patients were randomised for administration of either adrenaline (0.1 microgram/kg/min) or amrinone (bolus 1 mg/kg, continuous infusion of 5-10 micrograms/kg/min), if following cardiopulmonary bypass their cardiac index was < 2.4 L/min/m2 with normal peripheral resistance and normal or increased right- or left-ventricular filling pressures. Over a period of 1 hour, the hemodynamic parameters mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac index (CI), heart rate (HR), coronary perfusion pressure (CPP), total peripheral resistance (TPR), as well as the pressure-work index (PWI) were registered or calculated. By means of a coronary sinus catheter myocardial arterio-venous oxygen content difference (AVDO2cor), myocardial blood flow (MBF), using the thermodilution method, and myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2) could be measured or calculated. Simultaneously, arterial and myocardial lactate concentrations and, using the arterio-venous lactate ratio, myocardial lactate extraction or production were quantified. Using a transseptal approach, the left-ventricular pressure curve was measured and used to differentiate for myocardial contractility (dp/dtmax). Following induction of anesthesia and after cardiopulmonary bypass, plasma levels of the used beta-blocking agent were determined. Both substances caused a significant increase in myocardial contractility, with adrenaline showing a more potent effect than amrinone. Both substances caused a significant increase in CI with a mild increase in HR. Amrinone caused a significant drop in TPR, while MAP remained practically constant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "33": "Experimens were performed on 36 cats, showing that stimulation of the central end of the left major splanchnic nerve induced an increase of the plasma cortisol level. The centripetal effect was abolished by lesioning the septal nuclei, just as the same as injection of propranolol into the nuclei; but phentolamine had no such preventive action. All the findings show that it is the noradrenergic beta-receptor system of the septal nuclei that exerts a considerable effect on cortisol secretion.", 
    "34": "In cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) of SD rat, it was demonstrated that 10(-6) - 10(-5) mol/L NE and 10(-7) - 10(-5) mol/L isoproterenol stimulated proliferation and 3H-TdR incorporation of the cells in a dose dependent manner. These effects might be significantly inhibited by co-incubation with either alpha-receptor blocker phentolamine (10(-6) mol/L) or beta-receptor blocker propranolol (10(-5) mol/L). It was also found that cell counting and 3H-TdR incorporation were markedly decreased after incubation nifedipine (10(-6) mol/L) or verapamil (10(-6) mol/L) with NE (P < 0.01 as compared to that of NE group). It was further observed that nifedipine and verapamil inhibited DNA synthesis and proliferation of VSMC induced by isoproterenol.", 
    "35": "Effects of \"ischemia\" and adrenergic agonists on pacemaker current I(f) were observed in sheep cardiac Purkinje fibers. After perfusion with ischemia-mimic solution for 15, 30 and 60 min, the amplitude of I(f) current were decreased at all membrane potential levels between Ec-60 mV to -120 mV (n = 7, P < 0.05), activation time and half activation time to a steady state value of I(f) current were prolonged (n = 7, P < 0.05), activation curve of I(f) shifted to a more hyperpolarized position. Isoproterenol 1 x 10(-6) mol/L increased amplitude of I(f) current (n = 10, P < 0.05), shortened the activation time and half activation time (n = 10, P > 0.05), and shifted the activation curve to a more depolarized position; but isoproterenol of 1 x 10(-6) mol/L could not completely reverse the inhibitory effects of \"ischemia\" on I(f) current. In the presence of 5 x 10(-7) mol/L propranolol the effects of phenylephrine 5 x 10(-5) mol/L on I(f) current was variable; but aggravated the inhibitory effects of I(f) current due to \"ischemia\". The above results indicate that normal pacemaker activity of ventricular Purkinje fibers does not increase but rather decrease during myocardial ischemia-mimic condition, an observation suggesting that acute ischemic ventricular arrhythmia may not be due to abnormal strengthening of normal ventricular pacemaker activity.", 
    "36": "The present study utilized in vivo microdialysis to investigate the importance of 5-HT1A autoreceptors and alpha 1-adrenoceptors in the decreased 5-HT release obtained following administration of the mixed 5-HT1A autoreceptor partial agonist/alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist BMY7378, the selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT and the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin. BMY7378 (0.25 mg/kg, s.c.), 8-OH-DPAT (0.025 mg/kg, s.c.) and prazosin (0.1-1.0 mg/kg, s.c.) all suppressed ventral hippocampal 5-HT efflux. The BMY7378- and 8-OH-DPAT-induced inhibition of 5-HT release were reversed by a 40 min pre-treatment with either (+/-)pindolol (8 mg/kg, s.c.) or WAY-100635 (0.3 mg/kg, s.c.), to block 5-HT1A autoreceptors. Neitehr of these antagonists altered the prazosin-induced (0.3 mg/kg, s.c.) 5-HT disease.", 
    "37": "(i) confirm that both an alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist (prazosin) and 5-HT1A autoreceptor stimulants (BMY7378 and 8-OH-DPAT) may reduce cerebral 5-HT release; (ii) support that the BMY7378-induced decrease in 5-HT release results from 5-HT1A autoreceptor agonism, rather than alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade; and (iii) argue against \"physiological\" antagonism (i.e. via blockade of beta-adrenoceptors, 5-HT1B receptors or some other mechanism) as an explanation for the reversal by pindolol of 5-HT1A autoreceptor agonist-induced suppression of 5-HT release. These data support the usefulness of pindolol, as well as the more specific compound WAY-100635, to block 5-HT1A autoreceptors.", 
    "38": "[3H]Purine release from rat striatum astrocyte cultures was studied at 14 days in vitro (DIV). Superfusion of cultures with a Ca(2+)-free medium + 0.5 mM ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethylether)N,N,N',N'-tetracetic acid (EGTA) reduced the electrically evoked [3H]purine release. Nimodipine only at the concentration of 10 microM modified [3H]purine outflow whereas 0.1 microM omega-conotoxin and 0.03-0.1 microM nitrendipine reduced the evoked one. Superfusion of cultures with 0.1 microM omega-conotoxin + 0.1 microM nitrendipine antagonized the evoked [3H]purine release similarly to each drug given alone. Neither nitrendipine nor omega-conotoxin influenced the uptake of 45Ca2+ by the cultures. The treatment of cells with the Ca2+ agonist Bay K 8644 did not affect [3H]purine release or the 45Ca2+ uptake. The drug did not either alter [Ca2+]i, evaluated by loading the cells with 3 microM Fura-2/AM. 10-30 microM 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic acid 8-(diethylamino)octyl ester (TMB-8), a blocker of intracellular Ca2+ discharge, significantly reduced the evoked [3H]purine release. On the other hand, 2 microM thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the ion store Ca2+ ATPase, was able to increase either the culture [3H]purine release or the [Ca2+]i. Together, the findings indicate that voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCCs) of the neuronal N and L-types are not involved in the modulation of [3H]purine release from rat cultured astrocytes whereas Ca2+ coming from intracytoplasmic stores seems to play a prevailing role. Moreover, agents which block VSCC, seem to be able to affect [3H]purine outflow with mechanisms other than VSCC gating.", 
    "39": "Electrophysiological effects of beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs (pindolol and propranolol) on the action potentials (APs) and the membrane currents in spontaneously beating rabbit sino-atrial (SA) node cells were examined by the two-microelectrode voltage-clamp technique. Cumulative administrations of both blocking drugs (10(-7)-10(-6) M) prolonged the AP duration (APD) and caused a negative chronotropic effect in a concentration-dependent manner. Propranolol exhibited stronger responses than pindolol. At 10(-6) M, propranolol depolarized the maximum diastolic potential (MDP) and pindolol decreased the maximum rate of depolarization significantly, but the drugs had little or no effect on the AP amplitude (APA). In voltage-clamp experiments, both blockers (10(-7)-10(-6) M) inhibited the slow inward and the time-dependent outward currents in a concentration-dependent manner. Holding potential was -40 mV. The hyperpolarization-activated inward current was not affected by pindolol, but it was concentration-dependently inhibited by propranolol. The inactivation curve of Isi was not modified by either pindolol or propranolol. The activation curve of IK was unaffected by pindolol, but was shifted by propranolol 10(-6) M by approximately 11 mV in the depolarizing direction. These results indicate that both beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs (pindolol and propranolol) inhibit the slow inward and the time-dependent outward currents, but produce different actions on the hyperpolarization-activated inward current and the activation kinetic of IK due to their pharmacological properties, thereby resulting in difference in decrease in the spontaneous activity of rabbit SA node cells.", 
    "40": "We examined the responses to intraluminally applied acetylcholine (ACh) in isolated and perfused canine basilar arteries by the stainless-steel cannula-inserting method. In control vessels with intact endothelium, ACh produced a slight vasodilatation followed by a long-lasting vasoconstriction in the absence of induced tone. Propranolol, a beta-adrenoceptor blocker, had no effect on the response to ACh. After endothelial removal with intraluminal saponin, the constrictor component of the response to ACh was significantly enhanced, and the constrictions to prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) and potassium chloride (KCl) were significantly potentiated. After exposure to extraluminal oxyhemoglobin, the ACh-induced constriction was significantly augmented, whereas the dilator component of the response to calcium ionophore A23187 was significantly attenuated. The enhanced constriction to ACh after endothelial removal was significantly blocked by OKY-046 (a thromboxane synthetase inhibitor) and nimodipine (a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist), but was slightly though not significantly suppressed by AA-861 (a lipoxygenase inhibitor). The response to PGF2 alpha was not altered by OKY-046 or AA-861. These results suggest that the potentiation of ACh-induced constriction after endothelial removal may be mediated in part by thromboxane A2 (TXA2), linked with extracellular calcium entry in smooth muscle cells (SMC). This mechanism might be involved in the pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).", 
    "41": "CI-959 is an antiallergic/antiinflammatory agent currently in development. In rats, daily bolus intravenous administration of CI-959 at doses > or = 10 mg/kg was associated with development of cardiac hypertrophy. There was no morphologic or biochemical evidence of myocyte injury, and cardiac hypertrophy rapidly reversed after treatment was discontinued. Cardiac hypertrophy was not evident when CI-959 was given orally or by continuous intravenous infusion with ALZA osmotic pumps. Maximum plasma drug concentrations (Cmax) were significantly higher when CI-959 was given by bolus intravenous injection, suggesting that cardiac effects were dependent on high Cmax concentrations. When neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were exposed to CI-959 in vitro, there was no evidence of myocyte enlargement or increased protein content. Cardiac hypertrophy was prevented by pretreatment with nonselective beta- and beta 1-selective adrenoceptor blockers as well as with central sympatholytics. beta 2- and alpha-adrenoceptor blockers were ineffective in preventing cardiac hypertrophy. Bolus intravenous CI-959 administration resulted in prolonged hypotension and associated increase in plasma catecholamine levels, with apparent inhibition of reflex tachycardia. We conclude that CI-959-associated cardiac hypertrophy in rats was not a direct drug effect but instead was probably mediated by endogenous catecholaminergic stimulation of cardiac beta 1-adrenoceptors.", 
    "42": "Using a spectral procedure, we studied the effects of two treatment regimens of bradykinin (BK) on the blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) variabilities in conscious Wistar rats. We performed a second series of experiments with hydralazine, at doses equihypotensive to those used in BK treatments, to discriminate between a specific effect of the peptide and those induced by vasodilation. We assessed the activity of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), using the responses to atenolol and prazosin. First, at a subhypotensive treatment regimen, BK (5 micrograms/min) increased low-frequency (LF, 0.02-0.2 Hz) and mid-frequency (MF, 0.2-0.6 Hz) frequency components of BP variability and also activated the SNS. Lesser enhancements of LF and MF areas were induced by hydralazine (0.15 mg/kg). Second, high-dose treatment regimens of BK (100 micrograms/min) and hydralazine (2 mg/kg), which markedly decreased BP, did not change the areas of the LF and MF components of BP variability, whereas overactivity of the SNS was still assessed with the adrenergic blockers. On the other hand, high-dose BK induced a sixfold increase in the amplitude of the high frequency (HF, respiratory) component of BP. The effect of bradykinin on HF domain was associated with an increase in the depth of respiration in a group of anesthetized rats. Hoe 140 (60 micrograms/kg), a B-2 BK-receptor antagonist, abolished both the effects of BK on HF fluctuations in BP and the effects on breathing pattern. Our results demonstrate that BK induced different effects on LF and MF fluctuations in BP depending on the treatment regimen, whereas the SNS was activated by the two selected treatment regimens. Therefore, the MF component of BP variability should be considered only as a marker of the activity of the SNS when the BP level was not affected. Furthermore, we characterized an amplifying effect of BK on the HF domain of BP variability partly mediated by an increase in the depth of respiration.", 
    "43": "We examined the actions of the isopropyl ester of palmitoyl carnitine (P1Pi), a novel vasodilator compound, on coronary constriction mediated by the calcium channel activator BAY K 8644 and positive inotropic responses mediated by norepinephrine (NE) and low sodium perfusion in perfused rat hearts. Langendorff-perfused hearts were given bolus doses of BAY K 8644 or NE. The effects of P1Pi or atenolol on perfusion pressure, heart rate (HR), and developed tension changes induced by these agents were studied. In other experiments, low-sodium perfusion was used to manipulate sodium-calcium exchange in the presence and absence of P1Pi. P1Pi inhibited the coronary constrictor action of BAY K 8644 and also produced a selective inhibition of the inotropic but not the chronotropic action of NE. These effects of P1Pi were not associated with any depression of basal myocardial contractility. P1Pi did not affect the inotropic or coronary constrictor responses induced by low-sodium perfusion. The effects of P1Pi on the responses induced by BAY K 8644 and NE indicate that P1Pi inhibits activated L-type calcium channels while having no effect on sodium-calcium exchange. These effects may be related to the charged nature of this amphiphilic compound.", 
    "44": "Electrophysiological effects of sematilide, a novel class III antiarrhythmic agent, were examined and compared with those of (+/-)sotalol in guinea pig left atrium by a conventional microelectrode technique. Application of 0.1-1000 microM sematilide or 1-1000 microM (+/-)sotalol concentration-dependently prolonged the duration of action potentials (APD) that were elicited by electrical stimulation at 1 Hz. Other parameters of action potentials such as the maximum upstroke velocity of phase 0 depolarization, action potential amplitude and resting membrane potential were not affected significantly by these drugs in the concentration ranges employed. The prolongation of APD by sematilide or (+/-)sotalol was accompanied by a corresponding increase in the effective refractory period (ERP). Approximately a 30% increase in ERP was obtained by the treatment with 5 microM sematilide or 100 microM (+/-)sotalol, suggesting that sematilide as a class III antiarrhythmic agent is approximately 20 times more potent than (+/-)sotalol on a molecular basis. When the stimulation rate was increased stepwise from 0.2 to 2 Hz, the relative increase in APD at 90% repolarization by the treatment with sematilide and (+/-)sotalol was slightly larger at 2 Hz than at 0.2 Hz, indicating that \"reverse rate-dependence\" was not observed under these conditions. These results may suggest a possibility that sematilide effectively blocks atrial arrhythmia.",

    "46": "The small intestine was prepared for in vivo microcirculatory studies and transferred to an intravital microscope where arteriolar diameter and erythrocyte velocity were continuously monitored. First order arteriolar (1A) blood flow was calculated from the product of mean velocity and microvessel cross-sectional area. In separate experiments, diameter responses of 2A and 3A were monitored. Once steady-state conditions were achieved, the preparation was challenged by topically applied doses of propranolol (0.01-100.00 microM) in the presence and absence of the alpha-receptor antagonist, phentolamine. In a separate group of experiments, the effects of systemically administered propranolol (10 mg/kg body weight) were evaluated before and after local alpha-adrenoceptor blockade.", 
    "47": "Propranolol produced significant vasoconstriction and decreased blood flow in both normal and portal hypertensive rats. Portal hypertensive arterioles exhibited an attenuated response to propranolol. Local administration of phentolamine completely blocked the propranolol-induced diameter changes.

    "50": "We used a 528-channel mapping system to quantify the effects of the beta-antagonist, propranolol, and the beta-agonist, isoproterenol, on activation patterns in ventricular fibrillation. A plaque of 506 (22 x 23) electrodes spaced 1.12 mm apart and covering about 5% of the ventricular epicardium was sewn to the anterior right ventricle in 18 pigs (30 kg). Propranolol (0.25 to 0.4 mg/kg) increased the refractory period at a right ventricular epicardial site while isoproterenol (3 to 5 micrograms/min) shortened it. Ventricular fibrillation was induced by programmed stimulation, and unipolar electrograms were recorded from the 506 plaque electrodes for 2 seconds beginning 1, 15, and 30 seconds after the onset of fibrillation. Active epicardial recording sites were identified from the first derivative of the unipolar potentials (dV/dt) detected at each electrode. Then, neighboring active sites were grouped into activation fronts by computer analysis. In six pigs the effect of repeated inductions of ventricular fibrillation was assessed by comparing ventricular fibrillation after saline with a preceding control episode of fibrillation. Each activation front excited 40% +/- 46% of the mapped region before blocking. No changes were observed with saline and multiple inductions of fibrillation. In another six pigs, ventricular fibrillation after propranolol was compared with a preceding control episode of fibrillation. Ventricular fibrillation after propranolol exhibited a decreased activation rate per epicardial recording site and fewer activation fronts per second. There was no change in the amount of tissue excited by each activation front or the number of reentry cycles per activation front compared with control. In addition, there was no change in the maximum negative dV/dt detected per activation at an epicardial site. In six pigs ventricular fibrillation during isoproterenol was compared with control episodes of ventricular fibrillation before and 45 minutes after washout of the drug. The control episodes of fibrillation were not different from each other. Compared with control, ventricular fibrillation during isoproterenol exhibited an increased activation rate per epicardial site, an increased amount of tissue excited by each activation front, and an increased maximum negative dV/dt for each activation. There was no change in the number of activation fronts per second or the number of reentry cycles per activation front compared with control.", 
    "51": "Quantitative analysis revealed that propranolol and isoproterenol do not have symmetrically opposite effects on ventricular fibrillation. Propranolol decreased the number of activation fronts while isoproterenol increased the amount of tissue excited by each activation front. Thus, drugs that alter ventricular refractoriness or excitability alter ventricular fibrillation.", 
    "52": "The aim of the present study was to investigate whether or not charybdotoxin (CAS 95751-30-7, ChTX), a selective and potent Ca(2+)-dependent K+ channel blocker, inhibits the relaxation of guinea-pig tracheal smooth muscle induced by pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptides with 27 residues (PACAP27) and with 38 residues (PACAP38). Two forms of PACAP were discovered in hypothalamic tissues, and are known to increase the tissues cyclic AMP levels and to be independent of beta-adrenoceptors. The relaxant effects of these polypeptides were evaluated by measuring the isometric tension of tracheal smooth muscle of guinea-pig in vitro. Both forms of PACAP showed dose-dependent relaxant effects. The pD2 of PACAP27 was 7.01 +/- 0.04 and that of PACAP38 was 6.43 +/- 0.05. ChTX (10(-12)-3 x 10(-9) mol/l) did not affect the resting tension of the guinea-pig tracheal smooth muscle. ChTX (10(-8) mol/l) slightly increased the tension, in some experiments being considered as a phasic tension change. ChTX (10(-8) mol/l) caused a small but significant rightward shift in the concentration-response curves of PACAP27 and PACAP38. ChTX decreased the pD2 of PACAP27 to 6.74 +/- 0.03 and that of PACAP38 to 6.25 +/- 0.04. These results suggest that cyclic AMP-mediated activation of Ca(2+)-dependent K+ channels may play an important role in the relaxation of the guinea-pig tracheal smooth muscle induced by both forms of PACAP as well as beta-agonist.", 
    "53": "Several previous studies have shown that dopamine causes amylase secretion from rat parotid tissue. However, the mechanism of this dopamine action is still unclear. The present study was designed to characterize dopamine action in rat parotid gland tissue by examining the effects of dopamine on cyclic AMP accumulation, adenylyl cyclase activity, and amylase release. Dopamine significantly enhanced accumulation of cyclic AMP in parotid slices and stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in parotid membrane preparations. It also significantly stimulated amylase release from parotid slices. The stimulatory effects of dopamine on cyclic AMP accumulation, adenylyl cyclase activity, and amylase release were effectively blocked with propranolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist, but not by either SCH 23390, a preferential D1 antagonist, or butaclamol, a preferential D2 antagonist. No substantial specific binding sites for D1 receptors were detectable by [3H]SCH 23390 binding in parotid membranes. These results suggest that the stimulatory effect of dopamine on amylase secretion in rat parotid tissue is not mediated through specific D1 dopamine receptors but rather through beta-adrenergic receptors.",

The use of amiodarone in treating complex VA should be reserved for life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias in older persons who cannot tolerate or who do not respond to beta blockers. VA associated with congestive heart failure should be treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.

    "60": "During the years 1977-1986, 338 patients at the University Eye Clinic were diagnosed as having congenital glaucoma. This paper presents our experience of the management of 88 of these patients (161 eyes) who had a follow-up of at least 3 years. Medical therapy alone reduced the intraocular pressure to less than 21 mmHg in 17 eyes (11.8%) in the short-term and in 14 eyes (9.7%) in the long-term. Surgical intervention in 127 eyes (goniotomy: 9 eyes; trabeculotomy: 3 eyes; peripheral iridencleisis: 4 eyes; Elliott trephine; 23 eyes; trabeculectomy: 88 eyes), resulted in an immediate normalization of intraocular pressure in 98 eyes (77%, reducing to 66% at the final examination). Trabeculectomy normalized the intraocular pressure in 84% of eyes in the short-term and 76% in the long-term. Trabeculectomy is recommended as the surgical management of choice in congenital glaucoma in societies where presentation is late, or where individual surgeons may not be conversant with goniotomy.",

The control group consisted of 18 age-matched control patients without glaucoma, who had received no topical therapy. These patients underwent cataract surgery or squint surgery. Biopsies were taken from the infero-temporal bulbar quadrant with a biopsy forceps. The specimens were fixed while stabilized on a rubber support to exclude any major shrinkage. Specimens were analyzed by light microscopy for the content of inflammatory cells (plasma cells, lymphocytes, polymorphs, macrophages and mast cells), goblet cells and fibroblasts. No significant difference in the histologic parameters between the two groups could be demonstrated. The study suggests that topical treatment for periods up to 4 years with anti-glaucoma drugs does not induce morphological signs of inflammation and fibrosis of the conjunctiva.", 
    "63": "The levels of hsp27 and alpha B crystallin in various tissues of rats that had been subjected to heat stress were determined by specific immunoassays. When rats were immersed in a water bath at 42 degrees C for 20 min, the levels of hsp27 in most tissues, including central nervous tissue, liver, lung, spleen, adrenal glands, and hypophysis, had increased dramatically 8 to 16 h after the treatment. alpha B crystallin was also induced at high levels in the liver and adrenals, but not much was induced in the central nervous tissue. The increases in the levels of both hsp27 and alpha B crystallin in response to heat stress were markedly inhibited when ethanol or an alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist, prazosin, was administered before, but not after, the stress period. The expression of mRNA for hsp27 was suppressed in the livers of rats that had received ethanol or prazosin. A beta-adrenergic antagonist, propranolol, and an alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist, yohimbine, did not inhibit induction of the synthesis of the two proteins. Accumulation of hsp70 after heat stress, at least in the liver, was inhibited by ethanol or prazosin in a similar manner to that of hsp27, as detected on Western blot analysis. These results suggest that the induction of hsp27 and alpha B crystallin, as well as of hsp70, in tissues of heat-stressed rats is controlled by a physiological process(es) that is sensitive to ethanol and prazosin, and is operative for a short time during the application of heat stress.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the beta-adrenoceptor density, affinity and subtype in rat skeletal muscles with different fibre type composition. beta-Adrenoceptors were determined in cryostat sections to avoid methodological problems with variable recovery, using the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor ligand [3H]CGP-12177 and beta 1- and beta 2-selective cold ligands CGP 20712A and ICI 118,551. In the presence of protease inhibitors [3H]CGP-12177 binding was stable, saturable, reversible, and displaceable. Scatchard analysis of binding saturation data was compatible with a single class of specific binding sites. Binding site density (Bmax) was higher (P < 0.02) in adult soleus (9.38 +/- 1.13 fmol x mg protein-1) than in adult extensor digitorum longus (4.74 +/- 0.39 fmol x mg protein-1), whereas the dissociation constants (Kd), 0.37 +/- 0.05 and 0.31 +/- 0.04 nM for soleus and extensor digitorum longus, respectively, were not significantly different.

[3H]Inositol prelabeled LA-N-2 cells were exposed to varying concentrations of A beta P, from 20 to 125 micrograms/ml, and phospholipase C activation was measured. There was an increased release of inositol phosphates in the presence of amyloid beta protein as a function of incubation time. The effects of adrenergic, metabotropic amino acid and bombesin antagonists on the A beta P mediated stimulation of phospholipase C activity was investigated. Propranolol, a beta adrenergic antagonist, 7-chloro-kynurenic acid, a metabotropic amino acid antagonist, and [Tyr4-D-Phe12]bombesin, a bombesin antagonist, blunted the A beta P stimulation of phospholipase C activity in [3H]inositol prelabeled LA-N-2 cells. This suggests that amyloid beta protein activation of phospholipase C may be receptor mediated. The phospholipase C inhibitor U 71322 prevented the activation of phospholipase C by A beta P. However, this activation was not effected by tocopherol, propylgallate, or vitamin C.", 
    "67": "The effect of ganglioside GM1 on isoproterenol-induced cAMP accumulation was studied in insect Sf9 cells expressing the human beta 1-adrenergic receptor by infection with recombinant baculovirus. When such Sf9 cells were treated with isoproterenol plus IBMX, intracellular cAMP formation increased approximately 10-fold over the basal level. Preincubation of the baculovirus-infected cells with GM1 for 1 h caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of the isoproterenol-induced cAMP accumulation. Phosphatidylserine, GM3, GT1b and a bovine brain ganglioside preparation lacking GM1 did not cause significant inhibition. Forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation was not affected by the GM1 treatment. Inhibition of isoproterenol-induced cAMP formation by GM1 was not observed in Sf9 cells expressing beta 2-adrenergic receptor instead of the beta 1-adrenergic receptor. Binding studies with (-)-[3H]CGP12177 showed that preincubation with GM1 significantly reduced the affinity of antagonist binding to the beta 1-adrenergic receptor. These results suggest that GM1 or related ganglioside structure(s) may function as natural modulator(s) of the beta 1-adrenergic receptor.", 
    "68": "Ocular delivery of alprenolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist, by site-specific bioactivation of its methoxime analogue results in significant and prolonged decrease of the intraocular pressure in rabbits after topical administration. Alprenolone methoxime is stable in isotonic phosphate vehicle but undergoes enzymatic hydrolysis to the corresponding ketone in the eye. The ketone is then converted to alprenolol by a carbonyl reductase present in the iris-ciliary body. The benefit of this chemical delivery system approach includes the facile release of a potential antiglaucoma agent only at the site of the action; thus, unwanted systemic effects of the drug can be avoided.", 
    "69": "The expression of CYP2C12 is liver-specific and regulated at the transcriptional level by growth hormone (GH). In attempts to elucidate the nature of signaling molecules mediating the GH regulation of this gene in rat hepatocytes, a role for phospholipase A2 (PLA2) as a transducer of GH-induced levels of P4502C12 mRNA was investigated. GH was shown to induce tyrosyl-phosphorylation of p42 and p44 microtubule-associated protein (MAP) kinases and to reduce the electrophoretic mobility of a 100-kDa protein, immunologically related to cPLA2. These events were observed in parallel with GH-stimulated release of [3H]arachidonic acid ([3H]AA) from cellular phospholipids of rat hepatocytes labeled with [3H]AA. These rapid effects of GH action, as well as the GH-induced expression of CYP2C12, were inhibited in cells treated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A. Similarly, when the GH-induced liberation of [3H]AA was blocked by the PLA2 inhibitor mepacrine or the Ca2+ channel blocker verapamil, GH-induced accumulation of P4502C12 mRNA was absent. These results suggest a correlation between PLA2 activity and GH regulation of the CYP2C12 gene. The inhibitory effect of mepacrine on GH induction of P4502C12 mRNA was reversed by AA addition, further supporting a role for eicosanoids in the regulation of CYP2C12. Finally, inhibitors of P450-mediated AA metabolism, SKF-525A and ketoconazole as well as eicosatetraynoic acid, blocked the GH-mediated induction of P4502C12 mRNA, whereas more specific inhibitors of cyclooxygenase or lipoxygenase metabolism did not. Based on these results, we suggest that GH signaling in rat hepatocytes, leading to increased expression of CYP2C12, involves PLA2 activation and subsequent P450-catalyzed formation of an active AA metabolite.", 
    "70": "The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of ageing on the alterations in binding characteristics of adrenoceptors and membrane phospholipid fatty acids in rat heart following repeated administration of epinephrine. The maximal number of binding sites (Bmax) and dissociation constant (Kd) of [3H]prazosin and [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding to alpha 1- and beta-adrenoceptors, respectively, changed significantly during ageing. The downregulation of alpha 1- and beta-adrenoceptors after repeated epinephrine administration for one week, did not differ with age, but the response of the affinity (1/Kd) of both alpha 1- and beta-adrenoceptors to epinephrine treatment was age dependent. In 3-month-old rats the affinity of alpha 1-adrenoceptors was decreased after epinephrine treatment but the affinity of beta-adrenoceptors was unchanged. In 10- and 23-month-old rats the affinity of beta-adrenoceptors decreased after epinephrine treatment but the affinity of alpha 1-adrenoceptors did not change. During ageing the linoleic acid (18:2(n-6)) level decreased in phosphatidylcholine and the arachidonic acid (20:4(n-6)) level increased in phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. After epinephrine administration the 18:2(n-6) level decreased and the docosahexaenoic acid (22:6(n-3)) level increased in phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine and those changes were not age dependent. The 20:4(n-6) level increased in phosphatidylcholine after epinephrine administration, but that increase was smaller in old than in young rats. The results show that both ageing and epinephrine administration simultaneously modify the fatty acid composition of membrane phospholipids and the binding properties of alpha 1- and beta-adrenoceptors in rat heart.", 
    "71": "In the present pilot study an attempt was made to evaluate the usefulness of results obtained about the treatment of patients suffering from high blood pressure for a pharmacoepidemiological study of the therapeutic value of antihypertensive agents. Data from 90 hypertensive patients were used in the present retrospective-prospective study. These patients all attended an out-patient clinic located in one of the East-Bohemian districts that are participating in the MONICA programme. Instead of the analysis of the population data, regular blood pressure measurements, plasma glucose levels, and total cholesterol concentrations were measured and analysed. The consumption of various antihypertensive drugs in this study was similar to that found in larger studies performed in other health districts of the Czech Republic. Diuretics were the drugs most frequently prescribed for hypertensive patients. General practitioners rarely prescribed calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in 1990 and 1991. The metabolic effects of antihypertensive drugs, mostly diuretics, were not significantly evident. The most frequent occurrence of non-compensated blood pressure was recorded for the treatments with Trimecryton and methyldopa. However, the validity of these findings should be tested in a larger group of hypertensic patients.", 
    "72": "Impaired left ventricular function after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is associated with an increased risk of death. Despite recent advances in the management of these patients, sudden death accounts for up to 50% of this mortality, and effective treatment strategies have yet to be identified. Preliminary trials with amiodarone have offered promise that drugs that prolong action potential duration by blocking the potassium channel may be useful in reducing this mortality. The Survival With Oral d-Sotalol (SWORD) trial is a multicenter, multinational study which tests the hypothesis that the class III agent d-sotalol will reduce all-cause mortality in high-risk survivors of AMI. The trial will enroll 6,400 patients with left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction < or = 40%) and a recent (6 to 42 days) or a remote (> 42 days) AMI with overt heart failure (New York Heart Association class II or III). In approximately 500 centers throughout the world, men and women aged > or = 18 years will be enrolled and randomized to placebo or d-sotalol (200 mg/day). The minimal follow-up will be 18 months. The trial has a 90% power to detect a 20% reduction in all-cause mortality. The rationale, design, and trial methods are described.",

    "74": "Cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and contraction were measured simultaneously in fura 2-loaded porcine coronary arterial strips stimulated by the thromboxane A2 analogue U46619 and high-K+ depolarization in the presence and absence of 17 beta-estradiol. Pretreatment with 17 beta-estradiol (30 nmol/L to 30 mumol/L) inhibited the sustained elevation of [Ca2+]i and the sustained contraction induced by 300 nmol/L U46619. Higher concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol (1 to 100 mumol/L) also inhibited the U46619-induced transient increase in [Ca2+]i and contraction in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. In the strips precontracted by 90 mmol/L K+, 17 beta-estradiol (30 mumol/L) inhibited the increases in [Ca2+]i and contraction to resting levels. In contrast, 30 mumol/L 17 beta-estradiol only partially inhibited the U46619-induced sustained contraction, despite complete inhibition of the sustained increase in [Ca2+]i. Verapamil (10 mumol/L) also strongly inhibited the sustained increase in [Ca2+]i induced by 300 nmol/L U46619, with a partial inhibition of the U46619-induced sustained contraction. A subsequent addition of 30 mumol/L 17 beta-estradiol did not show an additional inhibitory effect on either the [Ca2+]i or the tension after the addition of verapamil. 17 beta-Estradiol (10 mumol/L) also inhibited the increase in [Ca2+]i and the contraction induced by cumulative addition of Ca2+ in the strips pretreated with 90 mmol/L K+. However, 17 beta-estradiol did not change the slope of the [Ca2+]i-tension curves. 17 beta-Estradiol (10 mumol/L) had no effect on the levels of cAMP and cGMP in the coronary strips.", 
    "75": "17 beta-Estradiol inhibits the contraction of coronary vascular smooth muscle mainly inhibiting Ca2+ influx without changing Ca2+ sensitivity of contractile elements. The Ca2+ channel blocker-like action of 17 beta-estradiol may explain at least a part of the antiatherosclerotic effect of estrogen.", 
    "76": "Neuroblastoma x glioma hybrid, NG108-15, cells appear to express the alpha-subunit of the guanine nucleotide-binding protein Gs in a substantial molar excess over its effector adenylate cyclase [Kim, Adie and Milligan (1994) Eur. J. Biochem. 219, 135-143]. Addition of the IP prostanoid receptor agonist iloprost to intact NG108-15 cells resulted in a dose-dependent increase in formation of the complex between Gs alpha and adenylate cyclase (GSAC) as measured by specific high-affinity binding of [3H]forskolin. NG108-15 cells transfected to express either relatively high (clone beta N22) or low (clone beta N17) levels of beta 2-adrenoceptor both showed dose-dependent increases in specific [3H]forskolin binding in response to the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline, and maximally effective concentrations of isoprenaline resulted in the generation of similar numbers of GSAC complexes in both clones. The dose-effect curve for clone beta N22, however, was some 15-fold to the left of that for clone beta N17, which is similar to that noted for isoprenaline-mediated stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity [Adie and Milligan (1994) Biochem. J. 303, 803-808]. In contrast, dose-effect curves for iloprost stimulation of [3H]forskolin binding were not different in clones beta N22 and beta N17. Basal specific [3H]forskolin binding in the absence of agonist was significantly greater in cells of clone beta N22 than clone beta N17. This was not a reflection of higher immunological levels of adenylate cyclase, indicating that the higher basal formation of GSAC probably reflects empty-receptor activation of Gs. This higher basal specific [3H]forskolin binding was partially reversed by propranolol. The addition of the opioid peptide D-Ala-D-Leu-enkephalin to NG108-15 cells did not reduce iloprost-stimulated [3H]forskolin binding even though this peptide inhibits stimulated adenylate cyclase activity by activation of a delta opioid receptor.",

An electrophoresis buffer of 100 mM borate pH 8.1 containing 50 mM SDS and 15% (v/v) acetone was found to provide the optimum separation with respect to resolution and migration time.",

This effect could be related to a partial collapse of the transmembrane potential which was created by the respiratory chain or the F0F1-ATPase. Sodium and lithium could not replace potassium ion. Atractyloside prevented the opening of this K+ pathway, suggesting that only matricial ATP operated. All these effects were inhibited by increasing phosphate concentration, or by adding propranolol, quinine, Zn2+ or Mg2+.",

    "81": "The role of protein kinase C (PKC) in the regulation of the beta 3-adrenergic receptor (beta 3-AR) gene was examined in murine 3T3-F442A adipocytes, which express this receptor subtype at a high level. We also investigated the involvement of this kinase in the modulation of beta 3-AR gene expression by insulin. Long term exposure of 3T3-F442A adipocytes to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) decreased beta 3-AR mRNA content in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, with maximal changes observed at 6 h (6.5-fold decrease) and at 100 nM PMA. This inhibition was selective for beta 3-AR transcripts, since beta 1- and beta 2-AR mRNA content remained unchanged. Also, (-)-[125I]cyanopindolol saturation and competition binding experiments on adipocyte membranes indicated that PMA induced an approximately 2-fold decrease in beta 3-AR expression, while that of the two other subtypes was not affected. This correlated with a lower efficacy of beta 3-AR agonists to stimulate adenylyl cyclase. Conversely, long term exposure to PMA did not alter adenylyl cyclase activity in response to guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) or forskolin. The inactive phorbol ester 4 alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate did not repress beta 3-AR mRNA levels. Inhibition of beta 3-AR mRNA by PMA was suppressed by the PKC-selective inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide, and was not observed in PKC-depleted cells, indicating that PKC was involved in this response. mRNA turnover experiments showed that the half-life of beta 3-AR transcripts was not affected by long term PMA exposure. When 3T3-F442A adipocytes were pretreated with PMA for 24 h to down-regulate PKC, or with bisindolylmaleimide, the insulin-induced inhibition of beta 3-AR mRNA levels was reduced by 44-67%. These findings demonstrate that sustained PKC activation exerts a specific control of beta 3-AR gene expression and is involved, at least in part, in the modulation by insulin of this adrenergic receptor subtype.", 
    "82": "Immortalized brown adipocyte cell lines derived from a mouse hibernoma express all three beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes, including beta 3-adrenergic receptor (AR). In response to norepinephrine, cAMP production by plasma membranes from four clonal cell lines was stimulated to levels comparable with brown adipocytes isolated from interscapular brown adipose tissue (72.8-89.6 versus 97.8 pmol cAMP/min/mg of protein, respectively). All cell lines responded to the highly selective beta 3-adrenergic receptor agonist CL316,243 by stimulating adenylyl cyclase activity (3-10-fold over basal). beta 1-, beta 2-, and beta 3-adrenergic receptor mRNA was detected by Northern blotting and/or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Competition binding assays with the antagonists CGP20712A and 125I-cyanopindolol showed the proportions of beta 1AR and beta 2AR in immortalized cells to be similar to brown adipocytes from tissue (cells: 35% beta 1AR, 65% beta 2AR; brown adipocytes from tissue: beta 1AR 41%, 59% beta 2AR). Expression of brown fat-specific mitochondrial uncoupling protein (Ucp) was stimulated by beta-adrenergic agonists in two of the four cell lines. The ability of individual beta AR subtypes to regulate Ucp expression was examined with combinations of selective beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists. Expression of Ucp could be induced by any of the beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes. However, the greatest response was obtained by stimulating all three beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes simultaneously (100 microM isoproterenol). Incubation of membranes from cultured cells or brown adipocytes from tissue with CL316,243 at an optimal concentration (5 microM) did not prevent norepinephrine from further stimulating adenylyl cyclase activity, suggesting that the combined activation of beta 1AR/beta 2AR, plus beta 3AR, together produced an additive cAMP response. Multiple forms of adenylyl cyclase were identified in brown and white adipocyte cell lines and tissues. Northern blot analysis detected adenylyl cyclase types 5, 6, and 10. Screening of reverse transcriptase-PCR products by DNA sequencing confirmed the identities of these forms and lower levels of additional isoforms, raising the possibility that beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes in adipocytes couple to distinct adenylyl cyclases. Because these cell lines display functional and phenotypic similarities to interscapular brown adipocytes, they will be a useful model to study the regulation of beta-adrenergic receptor expression and function, and the control of Ucp expression and activity.", 
    "83": "It has been reported that beta-blockade has beneficial effects on the cardiac function and prognosis of patients with congestive heart failure. However, the mechanism for these effects remained unclear. This study compared the use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (enalapril, 2.5 to 5.0 mg/day, or delapril, 15 to 30 mg/day) alone with the effects of beta-blockade therapy (metoprolol, 40 to 60 mg/day) coupled with an ACE inhibitor on global and regional left ventricular (LV) function in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. In 12 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, the global LV ejection fraction (EF), regional EF (rEF), and regional ejection time (rET) were determined by sector analysis of the radionuclide ventriculogram before and after therapy (duration 14 +/- 9 months). The coefficients of variation of rEF and rET were calculated as indexes of the heterogeneity of regional LV systolic wall motion. EF increased significantly from 20% +/- 8% to 30% +/- 8% (p < 0.05) in patients who received beta-blockade and an ACE inhibitor (n = 5). Furthermore, the coefficients of variation of rET decreased from 27% +/- 13% to 16% +/- 7% (p < 0.05). In contrast, patients treated with an ACE inhibitor only (n = 7) showed no significant improvements in any of these parameters. These results suggest that, compared with an ACE inhibitor alone, beta-blockade improves global and regional LV function in dilated cardiomyopathy by synchronizing myocardial contraction.", 
    "84": "The Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a rare condition in which weakness results from a presynaptic abnormality of acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction. It was first described as a paraneoplastic syndrome in patients with lung cancer but we now know about half of the patients with LEMS do not have cancer. The diagnosis is made on the basis of the clinical findings and characteristic electromyographic patterns. Recent evidence indicates that LEMS results from an autoimmune attack directed against the voltage-gated calcium channels on the presynaptic motor nerve terminal. In patients with LEMS who have cancer, effective treatment of the underlying tumor frequently produces marked improvement of weakness as well. Otherwise, treatment involves the use of agents that improve neuromuscular transmission by increasing the release of neurotransmitter, and immunosuppression.", 
    "85": "Our previous studies have shown that the microinjection of interleukin (IL)-2 into the third ventricle of conscious rats evokes the release of adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) and that its incubation with hemipituitaries in vitro was also effective in releasing ACTH. In the present experiments, we evaluated the effect of IL-2 on the release of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) from medial basal hypothalami (MBHs) incubated in vitro and studied the effect of other agents, whose release is altered in stress, on CRF release. IL-2 significantly stimulated CRF release at concentrations of 10(-13) and 10(-14) M, whereas increasing the concentration to 10(-12) to 10(-10) M did not produce significant release of CRF. A high concentration of potassium (55 mM) in the medium also significantly stimulated CRF release and this stimulation was not modified by IL-2. Since high-potassium-induced release of CRF is probably due to opening of voltage-dependent calcium channels, it is likely that IL-2 is releasing CRF by this mechanism. Since the release of luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) is modified by stress, we evaluated the action of LHRH on CRF release and the release induced by IL-2. Although LHRH failed to alter basal CRF release, except for a slight decrease at 10(-7) M, it completely blocked IL-2-induced CRF release at this concentration. To examine a possible role for opioid peptides in CRF release, the opiate receptor blocker, naloxone (NAL), was tested. At concentrations of 5 x 10(-6) and 10(-5) M, it produced a marked increase in CRF release; however, the simultaneous exposure of MBHs to each of these concentrations of NAL plus IL-2 caused a dose-dependent decrease in IL-2-induced CRF release, suggesting that beta-endorphin or other opioid peptides may play a role in IL-2-induced CRF release. As has been previously shown for IL-1 and IL-6, IL-2-induced CRF release was blocked by alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), which at high concentrations also reduced basal CRF release. As in the case of IL-1 and IL-2, dexamethasone (DEX), the highly active synthetic glucocorticoid, although not altering basal CRF release, completely blocked the response to IL-2. The inhibitor of cyclooxygenase, indomethacin (IND), also blocked IL-2-induced CRF release just as it has previously been shown to block IL-1- and IL-6-induced CRF release. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that IL-2 acts on its recently discovered receptors to induce an increase in intracellular calcium. In other experiments, we have shown that this activates nitric oxide (NO) synthase leading to production of NO by a NOergic neuron. NO diffuses to the CRF neuron and activates cyclo-oxygenase leading to generation of prostaglandin E2, which activates adenylate cyclase and increases cyclic AMP release, which then causes extrusion of CRF secretory granules. DEX presumably acts on its receptors on the CRF neuron to inhibit the increase in intracellular calcium and thereby blocks activation of phospholipase A2 necessary for activation of the arachidonic acid cascade. alpha-MSH and LHRH may similarly act on their receptors on these cells to, in some manner, block the pathway. On the other hand, beta-endorphin and/or other opioid peptides inhibit the pathway. Further experiments will be necessary to elucidate the exact points in the pathway at which these compounds are effective.", 
    "86": "The potencies and intrinsic activities on cyclic AMP accumulation and lipolysis of various selective beta 3-adrenoceptor agonists were studied in brown adipocytes and compared to those of the nonselective, (-)-isoprenaline, and conventional beta 1- (dobutamine) and beta 2-adrenoceptor (salbutamol) agonists. (-)-Isoprenaline, dobutamine and salbutamol were more potent stimulants of lipolysis than of cyclic AMP accumulation, while the selective beta 3-adrenoceptor agonists had similar potencies for these two functions. Apparent pA2 values of the selective beta 1-(CGP20712A) and beta 2-adrenoceptor (ICI118551) antagonist for inhibition of adenylyl cyclase stimulation by (-)-isoprenaline and the beta 3-adrenoceptor agonists, BRL37344, SR58611A, and ICI215001, indicated that (-)-isoprenaline can stimulate the enzyme through a relevant beta 1-adrenergic component, while the other drugs activate the enzyme mainly by acting on the beta 3-adrenoceptors. On the contrary, antagonism of the lipolysis yielded apparent pA2 values for CGP20712A and ICI118551, suggesting that (-)-isoprenaline, like all the beta 3-adrenoceptor agonists, stimulated the brown adipose tissue lipid metabolism mainly through an action on beta 3-adrenoceptors.", 
    "87": "In summary, beta-adrenergic receptor blocking medications have numerous metabolic side effects. Recent evidence indicates that this class of drug acutely decreases whole-body metabolic rate and increases protein oxidation in the resting human. The result of this metabolic perturbation may be a deleterious change in body composition and perhaps a creeping increase in body weight, if no subsequent alterations are made in food consumption or activity patterns. Research indicates that long-term treatment with beta-blockade may increase body fat and decrease the fat-free tissue content of the organism. Exercise is known to favorably affect body composition by decreasing percent body fat, while increasing the fat-free body tissue. Beginning a regular, moderate exercise program may help ameliorate these deleterious nutritional side effects of long-term beta-blocker therapy. Additionally, the recommendation to engage in a moderate exercise program is further indicated because of the underlying cardiovascular pathophysiology that originally required long-term beta-adrenergic treatment.", 
    "88": "To investigate a possible role of the central serotonergic system in the central control of pancreatic exocrine secretion, the median raphe nucleus of the anesthetized rat was electrically stimulated. The parameters of the biphasic square wave stimulus were 2 V, 2 ms, and 40 Hz. Electrical stimulation of the median raphe nucleus for 10 min resulted in large increases in pancreatic volume flow and protein output. The pancreatic responses were completely abolished by spinal cord transection at the level between C4 and C5. Cervical vagotomy or adrenalectomy failed to attenuate the pancreatic responses. The median raphe stimulation evoked a remarkable elevation of the blood pressure of the carotid artery as well as the plasma concentrations of noradrenaline and adrenaline. The responses were also completely inhibited by spinal cord transection but unaffected by cervical vagotomy. Adrenalectomy blocked the elevation of the plasma concentration of adrenaline only. Noradrenaline, given intravenously, stimulated the pancreatic volume flow and protein output. The actions of noradrenaline were antagonized by propranolol but not by phentolamine. It is, therefore, concluded from the present study that the median raphe nucleus may play a stimulatory role in pancreatic exocrine secretion of anesthetized rats and that the stimulatory role is mediated via the sympathetic nervous system acting on beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "89": "Phaeochromocytoma is one of the causes of hypertension. Topographic diagnosis is made by CT-scans or scanning with 123I- or 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I- or 131I-MIBG). We describe a patient with recurrent episodes of severe hypertension and increased serum catecholamines. With the suspicion of a phaeochromocytoma labetalol was given. Subsequently the 123I-MIBG scan showed an abnormal distribution of MIBG. After discontinuation of labetalol therapy the biodistribution of 123I-MIBG returned to normal. A list of drugs known and one drug which may be expected to interfere with MIBG scintigraphy are appended. It seems advisable to discontinue labetalol and other medication that may interfere with MIBG for at least several days before administering MIBG.", 
    "90": "The primary drugs utilized in the treatment of angina pectoris include organic nitrates, beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, Ca2+ antagonists, and the antithrombotic agents aspirin and heparin. Not all of these drugs are useful in every form of angina, and treatment is symptomatic rather than curative. In stable effort angina, beta-blockers, Ca2+ antagonists, and organic nitrates provide relief from angina pain and improve exercise tolerance primarily through their ability to decrease oxygen demand. The antiplatelet action of aspirin may decrease the incidence of myocardial infarction in these patients. Ca2+ channel blockers and organic nitrates are the drugs of choice for variant angina. These vasodilators restore blood flow by relieving the coronary vasospasm that triggers the ischemic episode. In unstable angina, aspirin and heparin reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, and aspirin increases survival. Heparin and nitrates alleviate angina pain, and under some circumstances beta-blockers and Ca2+ antagonists have a role in the relief of pain.", 
    "91": "Sotalol is a water-soluble, nonselective, beta-adrenergic blocker that was recently approved in oral form in the United States for the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias that are judged to be life-threatening. As a beta-blocker, sotalol is unique in having additional class-III antiarrhythmic activity. It is still not resolved whether sotalol is more effective than other beta-blockers in managing arrhythmias, but there are suggestions that it might possess greater antiarrhythmic and life-protecting activities than other types of antiarrhythmic drugs. The drug is well tolerated, but, because of its electrophysiologic activity, there is a small risk of proarrhythmia, specifically the development of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and torsade de pointes.", 
    "92": "Microinjection of glutamate into sites within the medullary raphe nuclei (pallidus and obscurus) at levels caudal to the obex resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP), renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA), and heart rate in anesthetized rabbits. The depressor and sympathoinhibitory responses were similar in magnitude to those elicited from the previously described depressor region in the caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVLM) but had a shorter duration, in both intact and barodenervated animals. The bradycardia was not altered by barodenervation but was reduced after administration of propranolol or atropine and abolished after administration of both drugs. The neuroinhibitory compounds gamma-aminobutyric acid or muscimol had no effect on MAP or RSNA when injected into the caudal medullary raphe nuclei but evoked a pressor and sympathoexcitatory response when injected into the CVLM. The results indicate that neurons within the caudal raphe pallidus and obscurus can powerfully inhibit sympathetic activity, but unlike sympathoinhibitory neurons in the CVLM, they are not tonically active and are not capable of producing sustained changes in arterial pressure and sympathetic activity.", 
    "93": "Electrical stimulation of the peripheral cut end of the cervical sympathetic trunk for 3 min at frequencies < 1 Hz with pulses of 2-ms duration at supramaximal intensities did not elicit any salivary secretion, but an increase of stimulus frequency over the range 2-10 Hz produced progressively greater salivary secretion, the maximum volume of salivary secretion being evoked at 10 Hz. Frequency-dependent augmentation of parasympathetic reflex submandibular salivary secretion occurred when the lingual nerve was stimulated during repetitive sympathetic stimulation (at frequencies of 0.1-2 Hz) in our sympathectomized cats. The augmentation was found to be linearly related to sympathetic stimulus frequency (regression line calculated by method of least squares; r = 0.939, P < 0.01). This augmentation was abolished by prior treatment with the beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug propranolol (1 mg/kg, P < 0.01 vs. before propranolol) but not by the alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agent phentolamine (1 mg/kg), indicating that the augmented response was mediated via an activation of beta-adrenoceptors. The reduction of the augmentation caused by propranolol had diminished 1 h after its administration, showing that the effect was reversible.", 
    "94": "This study was designed to define the effects of beta-adrenergic blockade on aortic lysyl oxidase (LO), an enzyme responsible for elastin and collagen cross-linking, and aneurysm formation in the blotchy mouse. It was hypothesized that beta-blockade would inhibit the development of aneurysms because of its hemodynamic effect rather than a direct effect on LO activity.", 
    "95": "Three groups of mice were studied: group I--normal littermates of blotchy mice; group II--untreated blotchy mice; group III--blotchy mice given either propranolol, atenolol, or nadolol. Data from the three different beta blocker-treated animals, group III, were statistically identical and were combined for analysis. The study was concluded when the mice were 4 months of age. At that time systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and aortic diameters were measured, and the entire aorta from each mouse was subjected to a bioassay for LO activity.", 
    "96": "Group I normal mice had an aortic arch diameter of 0.10 +/- 0.02 cm. Group II blotchy mice developed aortic arch aneurysms with a diameter of 0.21 +/- 0.03 cm. In Group III, beta blockade reduced the aortic arch diameter in blotchy mice to 0.11 +/- 0.03 cm. Mean heart rate in group III beta-blocked mice was reduced 25% compared with group I normal mice, and 18% compared with group II untreated blotchy mice. Blood pressures were similar in all three groups. Group II blotchy mice exhibited approximately half of the aortic LO activity (2.43 +/- 0.57 cpm/micrograms protein) noted in group I normal mice (5.82 +/- 1.06 cpm/micrograms protein). Aortic LO activity in group III blotchy mice remained low (2.09 +/- 0.85 cpm/micrograms protein) despite administration of beta-blockers.", 
    "97": "This is the first study to document an actual decrease in the level of aortic LO activity in blotchy mouse. beta-Blockade inhibits development of aortic aneurysms in blotchy mice. This is associated with a reduction in heart rate, but not by alterations in LO activity.", 
    "98": "In vitro studies have shown that, like catecholamines, both propranolol and atenolol are taken up by and released from adrenergic cells. We performed this study to investigate whether this may also play a role in humans and whether stereoselective aspects are important.", 
    "99": "This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of two groups of 12 healthy volunteers. Subjects received single oral doses of 80 mg (R,S)-, 40 mg (R)-, and 40 mg (S)-propranolol; 100 mg (R,S)-, 50 mg (R)-, and 50 mg (S)-atenolol; and placebo at intervals of 1 week. Exercise was performed at 4 and 9 hours after drug intake, and blood samples were taken before and at the end of each exercise period. The plasma concentrations of the (R)- and (S)-enantiomers of propranolol and atenolol, as well as those of epinephrine and norepinephrine, were determined by HPLC.", 
    "100": "Effects of exercise on the plasma levels of the enantiomers of propranolol and atenolol were similar. When the optically pure enantiomers were administered, exercise caused a marked and significant increase of the plasma concentrations of the (S)- but not of the (R)-enantiomers. When the drugs were administered in the racemic form, the plasma levels of both the (R)- and (S)-enantiomers were elevated to the same extent. The increase of norepinephrine levels during exercise was more pronounced than that of epinephrine and paralleled that of the (S)-enantiomers of the beta-blockers.", 
    "101": "Bearing the in vitro data in mind, we conclude that (S)-propranolol and (S)-atenolol are taken up into and released from adrenergic cells together with norepinephrine during exercise. The reason why the plasma concentrations of (R)-propranolol and (R)-atenolol are increased only during exercise in the presence of the corresponding (S)-enantiomers remains to be determined.", 
    "102": "Carvedilol is a mixed alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist that is administered as a racemic mixture. Although the two isomers are equally potent as alpha 1-blockers the S(-)-isomer is principally responsible for the beta blockade of carvedilol. To determine the role of pharmacogenetics in the metabolism of carvedilol we studied nine extensive metabolizers of both debrisoquin and mephenytoin, seven poor metabolizers of debrisoquin but extensive metabolizers of mephenytoin, and three poor metabolizers of mephenytoin but extensive metabolizers of debrisoquin. The clearance of R-carvedilol was significantly lower than S-carvedilol in both debrisoquin phenotypes. Poor metabolizers of debrisoquin had a significantly lower clearance of R-carvedilol than extensive metabolizers of debrisoquin. The partial metabolic clearance of carvedilol to the two ring-hydroxylated metabolites 4- and 5-hydroxyphenyl carvedilol were significantly reduced in poor metabolizers of debrisoquin. No effect of mephenytoin phenotype on carvedilol kinetics was observed. Thus carvedilol is stereoselectively metabolized in humans, and the clearance of S-carvedilol is higher than that of R-carvedilol. In poor metabolizers of debrisoquin the clearance of R-carvedilol is further reduced, resulting in higher plasma concentrations and perhaps greater alpha-blockade.", 
    "103": "Nitrosation of propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocking drug previously found to react with nitrite in HCl solution yielding a genotoxic nitrosamine, was examined under simulated gastric conditions. In the presence of a low concentration of nitrite (2.9 mM) and a therapeutic gastric concentration of the drug (5.4 mM), the yield of N-nitrosopropranolol was higher in simulated gastric juice, which contained both pepsin and thiocyanate, than in distilled water, and at pH 3.5 than at pH 1.0. A 55 microM concentration of N-nitrosopropranolol was reached after 180 min. It is reasonable to assume that the extremely small amounts of N-nitrosopropranolol formed in the human stomach should not represent a significant carcinogenic risk, but co-formulation of propranolol with ascorbic acid, which has been found to minimize the nitrosation reaction, might be useful to avoid a further, even if minimal, contribution to the already existing exposure to genotoxic chemicals.", 
    "104": "Although it is well known that sympathoadrenal activity increases under various adverse circulatory conditions, it is not known whether there are any alterations in hepatic plasma membrane beta-adrenergic receptors after trauma-hemorrhage and crystalloid resuscitation. To study this, rats underwent a 5-cm midline laparotomy (i.e., trauma induced) and were bled to and maintained at a mean arterial pressure of 40 mmHg until 40% of the maximal bleedout (MB) volume was returned in the form of Ringer lactate. The animals were then resuscitated with four times the volume of MB in the form of Ringer lactate over 60 min. Hepatic plasma membranes were isolated using discontinuous Percoll gradient centrifugation. The maximal binding capacity and dissociation constant (i.e., 1/affinity) of [125I]iodopindolol binding to beta-adrenergic receptors were determined using a membrane filtration assay and Scatchard analysis. The results indicate that there was a significant decrease in the maximal binding capacity at the time of MB, which persisted despite crystalloid resuscitation after hemorrhage. However, there were no significant changes in the dissociation constant at any time point during this study. The downregulation of beta-adrenergic receptor binding capacity may be responsible for metabolic abnormalities observed after hemorrhagic shock.", 
    "105": "The purpose of this study was to assess the interaction between beta-blockade and exercise on amino acid kinetics. This was a three-way crossover experiment using beta 1-blockade, beta 1,beta 2-blockade, and a placebo control. Three 6-h L-[1-13C]leucine and L-[alpha-15N]lysine infusions were performed. The first 3 h established an isotopic steady state, and 1 h of exercise (approximately 50% of maximal O2 consumption) and 2 h of recovery followed. Plasma glucose decreased with exercise during all trials (P < 0.0001). During beta 1- and beta 1,beta 2-blockade, plasma free fatty acids were reduced during rest and exercise (P < 0.001). Leucine and lysine rates of appearance were unaffected by beta-blockade during rest but were decreased with placebo exercise. Leucine oxidation increased with beta-blockade (P < 0.01) and exercise (P < 0.001). There was a statistical interaction between both treatments (P < 0.004). In conclusion, leucine oxidation increased with exercise, further increased with beta 1-blockade, and was additionally heightened with beta 1,beta 2-blockade. This cumulative response indicates that leucine oxidation was regulated through beta 1- and beta 2-receptors.", 
    "106": "Substantial advances in the diagnosis and treatment of ischemic heart disease, especially myocardial infarction, have reduced mortality rates during the past several years. This progress is tempered, however, by the continuing large overall incidence of myocardial infarction and cardiac death in persons in their prime years. Preventive measures are important and are usually best applied by primary care physicians. The acute crisis of coronary artery thrombosis demands accurate diagnosis and timely thrombolytic therapy, which has halved the mortality rate of myocardial infarction. Several effective thrombolytic agents are available; on the basis of several large international trials of these drugs, it appears that the benefits of early and appropriate use of any one of these agents outweigh any individual advantages. In addition to thrombolytics, aspirin and heparin are necessary adjunctive drugs for acute myocardial infarction. Nitroglycerin is helpful, but its essential role seems less evident. Earlier use of beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors has been proved effective in reducing mortality. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty is definitely as effective as thrombolytic therapy, but immediate application is logistically challenging in most US hospitals.", 
    "107": "1,2-Dichlorobenzene, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetrachlorobenzene, and pentachlorobenzene were incubated with microsomes derived from cell lines expressing human CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2E1, or CYP2D6. The formation of phenolic metabolites as determined by gas chromatographic analysis revealed that CYP2E1 possessed the highest activity toward all chlorinated benzenes. Furthermore, CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 showed relatively high enzymatic activities toward the lower chlorinated benzenes (1,2-dichlorobenzene, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene) and CYP3A4 toward the higher chlorinated benzenes (1,2,3,5-tetrachlorobenzene, pentachlorobenzene). CYP2D6 only showed low or nondetectable activity toward the investigated chlorobenzenes. The ratio between the activities of CYP2E1 and CYP3A4 with respect to the oxidation of chlorinated benzenes decreased from 150 (1,2-dichlorobenzene) to 1.8 (pentachlorobenzene). In order to estimate the relative contribution of CYP2E1 in hepatic metabolism of 1,2-dichlorobenzene and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene in vitro, the rate of oxidation of these compounds by microsomal preparations from 22 human livers was correlated with activities toward specific substrates for CYP2E1, CYP3A, and CYP1A. The results were supportive for the results obtained with single human P450 enzymes. CYP2E1 is the major, if not the only, enzyme involved in the formation of 2,3-dichlorophenol, 3,4-dichlorophenol, 2,3,5-trichlorophenol, and 2,3,4-trichlorophenol, while CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of 2,3,6-trichlorophenol. The formation of the major metabolite from 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (2,4,5-trichlorophenol) was correlated with both CYP2E1 and CYP3A activity. Because of the decreasing ratio in activity between CYP2E1 and CYP3A4 with respect to the oxidation of chlorinated benzenes, it is concluded that the role of CYP2E1 toward chlorinated benzenes decreases with increasing number of chlorine atoms. The relative amount of CYP3A4 present then becomes an important determinant for metabolism.", 
    "108": "Hepatic resection promotes such a high degree of surgical stress that it induces deterioration of various vital functions, which may involve the breakdown of signal transduction systems. To investigate the influence of surgical stress on signal transduction, we studied ligand-receptor specific binding activity after hepatic resection, focusing on lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptors. The maximum binding capacity (Bmax) and the dissociation constant (KD) were determined by radioligand binding assay using (-)3H-CGP12177 as a ligand. In the hepatectomy group, Bmax significantly decreased from 1380 +/- 109 to 799 +/- 49 receptors/cell on postoperative day (POD) 3 and to 802 +/- 93 receptors/cell on POD 7 (P < 0.05). In the control group, however, it did not significantly change after the operation. No significant changes in KD were found in either of these groups. The Bmax alteration was not due to the redistribution of lymphocyte subsets or receptor down regulation, but to the decrease in the Bmax of the individual subset. The hepatectomy group was divided into two groups according to the postoperative arterial ketone body ratio (AKBR): Group A, AKBR maintained at 0.7 or more; and Group B, AKBR decreased to below 0.7. The Bmax decrease, a percentage of the preoperative value, of Group B was significantly smaller than that of Group A (48.4 +/- 3.9 and 72.3 +/- 7.3%, respectively, P < 0.05). These results suggest that intense surgical stress, produced by hepatic resection, may influence even ligand-receptor binding parameters, and the decrease in AKBR can indicate the magnitude of surgical stress.", 
    "109": "Although it is well established in several mammalian species that beta 3-adrenoceptors play a major role in regulating lipolysis and thermogenesis in adipose tissue, the functional existence and role of this receptor subtype in man has been controversial. We investigated whether the beta 3-adrenoceptor functionally co-exists with beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors in vivo in human adipose tissue. Subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue of healthy non-obese subjects was microdialyzed with equimolar concentrations of dobutamine (selective beta 1-adrenoceptor agonist), terbutaline (selective beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist), or CGP 12177 (selective beta 3-adrenoceptor agonist). All three agents caused a rapid, sustained, concentration-dependent and significant elevation of the glycerol level in the microdialysate (lipolysis index). However, only terbutaline stimulated the nutritive blood flow in adipose tissue, as measured by an ethanol escape technique. Dobutamine and CGP 12177 was equally effective in elevating the glycerol level (maximum effect 150% above baseline). Terbutaline was significantly more effective than the other two beta-agonists (maximum effect 200% above baseline). When adipose tissue was pretreated with the beta 1/beta 2-selective adrenoceptor blocker propranolol the glycerol increasing effect of dobutamine or terbutaline was inhibited by 80-85% but the glycerol response to CGP 12177 was not influenced. It is concluded that a functional beta 3-adrenoceptor is present in vivo in man. It co-exists with beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors in adipose tissue and may therefore play a role in lipolysis regulation. It appears, however, that the beta 2-adrenoceptor is the most important beta-adrenoceptor subtype for the mobilization of lipids from abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue because of its concomitant stimulatory effect on lipolysis and blood flow.", 
    "110": "We compared two methods of assessment of baroreflex sensitivity in eight supine healthy volunteers during repeated baseline measurements and various conditions of cardiac autonomic blockade. The spontaneous baroreflex method involved computer scanning of recordings of continuous finger arterial pressure and electrocardiogram to locate sequences of three or more beats in which pressure spontaneously increased or decreased, with parallel changes in pulse intervals. The mean regression slope of all these sequences during each study condition was considered to represent the mean spontaneous baroreflex slope. In the drug-induced method, sigmoidal curves were constructed from data obtained by bolus injections of phenylephrine and nitroprusside; the tangents taken at the resting pressure of each of these curves were compared with the mean spontaneous baroreflex slopes. The two methods yielded slopes that were highly correlated (r = .96, P < .001), with significant but similar intraindividual baseline variability. Atropine virtually eliminated the baroreflex slope; subsequent addition of propranolol did not alter it further. Propranolol or clonidine alone increased average baroreflex slope to the extent that they increased resting pulse interval (r = .69 to .83). The spontaneous baroreflex method provides a reliable, noninvasive assessment of human vagal cardiac baroreflex sensitivity within its physiological operating range.", 
    "111": "We conducted this study to compare the effects of fosinopril versus atenolol on peripheral blood pressure, central arterial wave reflection, and left ventricular mass in a group of patients with essential hypertension. We conducted a double-blind, randomized trial of fosinopril and atenolol in 79 hypertensive patients (52 men, 27 women; mean age, 45.8 +/- 8.5 years; range, 30 to 68 years). Carotid pressure waveforms were recorded noninvasively by applanation tonometry with a Millar micromanometer-tipped probe. The extent of wave reflection was estimated by the augmentation index defined as the ratio of the amplitude of pressure wave above its systolic shoulder to the pulse pressure. The augmentation index, left ventricular mass index by two-dimensional echocardiography, and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressures were determined before and after 8 weeks of daily treatment with fosinopril (10 to 20 mg) or atenolol (50 to 100 mg) with or without diuretics and compared with those values in 79 normotensive control subjects. After 8 weeks of treatment, both drugs lowered 24-hour ambulatory peripheral systolic and diastolic pressures into the normal range to a similar extent (fosinopril, -18/-13 mm Hg; atenolol, -23/-17 mm Hg, both P = NS). On the other hand, whereas the elevated augmentation index in hypertensive patients compared with normotensive subjects (16 +/- 11% versus 10 +/- 8%) was completely normalized by fosinopril (-9.3 +/- 9.8%, P < or = .002), it was lowered by atenolol (-4.8 +/- 8.9%, P < .002) but to a significantly smaller extent (fosinopril versus atenolol effect, P = .04).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "112": "Although blood flow to the pulmonary airways is known to be largely under sympathetic control, virtually nothing is known about adrenergic regulation of vascular segments within the airway microcirculation. To evaluate the distribution of functional adrenergic receptor subtypes in the microvessels of the large airways, the change in diameter of adventitial vessels in rat trachea was measured following suffusion with selective and nonselective receptor agonists and antagonists. Microvessels were viewed with a video microscope, and vessel diameters were measured using video calipers. Arterioles (11.0 to 40.0 microns, n = 32), small postcapillary venules (11.0 to 26.0 microns, n = 16), medium venules (28.0 to 59.5 microns, n = 40), and large collecting venules (61.0 to 99.0 microns, n = 42) were distinguished. Similar sensitivities to norepinephrine (NE), a mixed alpha 1 and alpha 2 agonist, were observed in arterioles and medium venules with EC50 (agonist concentration needed to produce 50% of the maximal response) for contraction of 2.4 x 10(-7) and 3.3 x 10(-7) M, respectively. Large venules (EC50 of 1.6 x 10(-6) M) were significantly (p < 0.05) less sensitive than arterioles to NE. In the presence of propranolol, a beta receptor antagonist, the EC50 values for NE were not different between the three vessel groups, although the response to low doses of NE was significantly increased in arterioles. When vessels were treated with propranolol and phenylephrine, a selective alpha 1 agonist, arterioles (EC50 of 4.1 x 10(-7) M) were significantly more sensitive than large venules (EC50 of 4.9 x 10(-6) M).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
