The size of the infarct was estimated from analyses of heat stable lactate dehydrogenase (LD) (EC 1.1.1.27.) in serum collected every 12 hr for 48-108 hr. All patients participated in a double-blind comparison of the beta 1-selective blocker metoprolol with placebo in suspected acute myocardial infarction. A correlation was observed between the enzymatically estimated infarct size and the incidence of ventricular fibrillation and treated ventricular tachycardia in patients on placebo (P less than 0.001), while this could not be demonstrated in patients on the beta-blocker (P greater than 0.2). In placebo treated patients there was a correlation between the maximum heat stable LD activity and early ventricular fibrillation (P = 0.034), late ventricular fibrillation (P less than 0.001), primary ventricular fibrillation (P = 0.002) as well as secondary ventricular fibrillation (P = 0.034). It is concluded that there seems to be a relatively strong correlation between the final size of the infarction and the occurrence of severe ventricular arrhythmias. Treatment with beta-blockade appeared to disturb this correlation.", 
    "1": "Microelectrode recordings of multiunit sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity were made in muscle branches of the peroneal nerve in patients with essential hypertension before and during long-term treatment with the cardioselective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist metoprolol. Nerve activity was quantified by counting the number of sympathetic bursts in the mean voltage neurogram. Metoprolol treatment lowered blood pressure and heart rate in all subjects. During long-term treatment, nerve activity was reduced both when compared to the level of activity after the first dose of the drug (p less than 0.01) and when compared to the control level before treatment (p less than 0.05). It is suggested that the reduction of sympathetic vasoconstrictor outflow to muscles contributed to the blood pressure reduction.", 
    "2": "In a placebo-controlled double-blind study 14 hypertensive patients with intermittent claudication were treated with metoprolol (100-200 mg daily) and methyldopa (500-1000 mg daily) for 3 weeks and their effects on heart rate, blood pressure as well as on resting and hyperaemic calf blood flow and vascular resistance were compared. In their antihypertensive effect metoprolol and methyldopa did not differ significantly. In 23 diseased limbs the calf blood flow and vascular resistance remained unchanged at rest during the trial. The active drugs reduced hyperaemic flow (P less than 0.05). The peak flow was reduced by 20% (P greater than 0.01) with metoprolol and by 15% with methyldopa below the initial level and by 17% and by 12% below the level recorded on placebo, respectively. Neither of the drugs influenced vascular resistance during reactive hyperaemia. Thus, in patients with intermittent claudication antihypertensives should be used with care.", 
    "3": "To determine if propranolol given twice daily (b.i.d.) or once daily (q.d.) was as effective as 4 times daily (q.i.d.) for treatment of stable angina pectoris, 78 patients with exercise-induced ST depression of 1.5 mm were randomized to q.i.d., b.i.d., q.d. and placebo groups. All patients received 5 tablets per day, and propranolol groups received 80, 160 and 320 mg/day on successive weeks. At weekly visits, patients underwent treadmill exercise testing before the 8:00 AM dose and at 2 and 9 hours afterward. Exercise duration (seconds) was significantly improved at the final visit compared with baseline by b.i.d. (120 +/- 36 [mean +/-] standard error of the mean p less than 0.001 n = 18) and q.i.d. (100 +/- 37, p less than 0.01; n = 17) regimens, but not by the q.d. (30 +/- 33; n = 18) and placebo regimens (27 +/- 37; n = 17). There was a significant decrease from baseline in the magnitude of ST depression at the final visit, measured at maximal common exercise duration in b.i.d. (-0.96 +/- 0.20 mm, p less than 0.001), q.i.d. (-0.84 +/- 0.20 mm, p less than 0.01) and q.d. (-0.58 +/- 0.18 mm, p less than 0.05) groups, but not in the placebo group (0.03 +/- 0.2 mm). Hourly heart rate by Holter was reduced in all 3 propranolol groups; however, the mean serum propranolol level was significantly lower just before the first dose with q.d. group (56 +/- 20 ng/ml) compared with b.i.d. and q.i.d. groups (146 +/- 22 and 119 +/- 28 ng/ml) with 320 mg/day (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "4": "We report the first comparative study on enalapril maleate, a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, in patients with uncomplicated mild to moderate essential hypertension. Fifty-four patients were randomly assigned to treatment with enalapril or propranolol for 16 weeks following a placebo run-in-phase. The study was double-blind. Enalapril and propranolol both reduced blood pressure, though the changes were significantly treated with enalapril were normotensive at the end of the study. Enalapril treatment was associated with a significant reduction in weight. Both drugs raised plasma potassium and urea. No haematological abnormalities occurred with enalapril and there were no reports of rash, taste disturbance or proteinuria. At the end of the trial the mean daily dose of enalapril was 20 mg and that of propranolol was 180 mg.", 
    "5": "Multiple (100 mg twice daily for 21 days) but not single (100 mg) oral doses of metoprolol significantly reduced the number (Bmax) and the KD of beta-adrenoceptors on intact lymphocytes from nine healthy volunteers. Sulphinpyrazone (400 mg twice daily for 21 days) did not change lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptors and did not modify their reaction to chronic metoprolol. In vitro sulphinpyrazone (10-4M) increased [3H]-DHA specific binding on intact lymphocytes. This effect was not modified by metoprolol, sulphinpyrazone or the two combined. Metoprolol and sulphinpyrazone did not interact in the experimental model of beta-adrenoceptors on intact lymphocytes in conditions mimicking long-term treatment.", 
    "6": "The thermogenic capacity and morphologic characteristics of interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT) were assessed in 3- to 4-mo-old male, lean and obese Zucker rats. Pads from obese rats were threefold heavier and contained similar numbers of cells but an average of 50% fewer multilocular cells than pads from lean rats and 40% less mitochondrial protein per pad. The maximal number of beta-adrenoreceptor binding sites, as assessed by [125I]iodocyanopindolol binding to isolated brown adipocytes from obese rats was 50% of that in lean rats on a per cell and per pad basis. Basal and norepinephrine (NE)-stimulated in vitro oxygen consumption in isolated brown adipocytes from lean rats correlated directly with the proportion of mutilocular cells present. This correlation was not seen in cells from obese rats that had a 50% decrease in their basal respiratory rates and could not be further stimulated by excess NE or fatty acid. Electron micrographs of IBAT from obese rats revealed distorted mitochondrial shapes and cristae patterns and the presence of numerous inclusion bodies. Because NE-stimulated lipolysis had previously been shown to be normal in the obese Zucker rat, these data suggest that defective BAT thermogenesis in the obese rat is due to an inability of mitochondria to utilize free fatty acids for the production of enhanced oxygen consumption.", 
    "7": "The effects of Ca2+, the cyclic nucleotides adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) and guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP), and other parameters of sweat secretion from single equine sweat glands were examined in vitro. Extracellular Ca2+, the Ca2+ ionophore A23187, and the Ca2+ channel antagonist verapamil were all without effect on sweat secretion. Prolonged rinsing of the glands in Ca2+-free Ringer solution with 5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid decreased the secretion to 30% of the control sweat rate in response to the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol; the sweat response was restored upon adding Ca2+ to the Ringer. cAMP but not cGMP analogues were as effective in stimulating sweat rates as isoproterenol, which elicited maximal secretory rates in vitro. cAMP stimulation was not inhibited by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol. Because the equine sweat gland is predominantly stimulated via the beta-adrenergic receptor, we conclude that cAMP is a principal intracellular messenger in coupling this type of stimulus to the fluid secretion response in this tissue.", 
    "8": "The O,O-dibenzyl ether of the 3,4-catechol derivative of propranolol (11) was prepared to determine whether the catechol is a product of metabolic hydroxylation. 4-(Allyloxy)-1,2-naphthoquinone (5) was reduced with sodium dithionite and alkylated with benzyl chloride to produce ether 7. Osmium tetroxide oxidation of 7 afforded glycol 8. Subsequent monotosylation, oxirane formation with KOH, and opening with isopropylamine afforded benzyl ether 11. Although hydrogenolysis was successful, catechol 3 was rapidly oxidized to the corresponding o-quinone (12). Reduction of 12 with sodium bisulfite afforded 3, which was derivatized with N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) to serve as a standard for the metabolic experiments. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of the Me3Si ethers of the products of metabolism of pseudoracemic propranolol (made up of equal molar (2R)-propranolol-d0/(2S)-propranolol-3',3'-d2) in the presence of the rat liver 9000g supernatant fraction showed four dihydroxylated metabolites, of which catechol 3 was in smallest amount, approximately 9% of the sum of dihydroxylated metabolites. Each of the four dihydroxylated propranolols arises stereoselectively from the 2R enantiomer of propranolol (by 1.15- to 2-fold), as determined by parent ion intensities at m/z 507 vs. 509. Quinone 12 was a nonselective competitive beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, being about 16-fold less potent than propranolol in both beta 1 and beta 2 assays.", 
    "9": "We evaluated the effects of the diterpene compound forskolin in human myocardial adenylate cyclase preparations, isolated trabeculae and papillary muscles derived from failing human hearts, and acutely instrumented dogs. Forskolin was a potent, powerful activator of human myocardial adenylate cyclase and produced maximal effects that were 4.82 (normally functioning left ventricle) and 6.13 (failing left ventricle) fold greater than isoproterenol. In contrast to isoproterenol, forskolin retained full activity in membrane preparations derived from failing hearts. In cyclase preparations, forskolin demonstrated unique substrate and Mg2+ kinetic properties that could be distinguished from hormone receptor-coupled agonists or fluoride ion. The adenylate cyclase stimulatory effect of forskolin was synergistic with isoproterenol, apparently due to the location of forskolin activation being beyond the level of hormone receptor-agonist in the receptor-cyclase complex. Forskolin was a potent positive inotrope in failing human myocardium, producing a stimulation of contraction that was similar to isoproterenol. Finally, in open chest dogs forskolin was a positive inotropic agent that reduced preload and afterload. We conclude that forskolin belongs to a class of agents that may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of congestive heart failure.", 
    "10": "Bopindolol has beta-blocking effects for 96 hr despite a 4-hr t1/2. To investigate the concentration-effect relationship after single and repeated doses. 2-mg oral doses were given once and then daily for 13 days to six healthy subjects. In plasma, no unchanged drug, only the hydrolysis product of bopindolol (referred to as bopindolol concentration) was detectable or could be measured up to 24 hr. Chemical assay by HPLC and determination of total active beta-adrenoceptor blocking material by radioreceptor assay gave identical results. The t1/2 was 4 to 5 hr. Effects, measured as reduction in exercise-induced tachycardia (REIT) and as the isoproterenol dose ratio (DR - 1), were followed for 96 hr. The concentration of bopindolol in plasma (predicted with a one-compartment body model) could be related to the measured effects by classic effect models for 20 t1/2s. Parameter estimates for kinetic end effect models did not differ after single and repeated doses. With the parameters from the single-dose experiment, the time course of the plasma concentration and the effects after the multiple-dose experiment could be adequately predicted for 24 and 96 hr. A deep compartment, an active metabolite, or irreversible destruction of the receptor (accounting for the persistence of the effect) could be excluded. The \"dissociation constant\" of 100 pmol/l (from DR -1/concentration) and the minimal effective plasma concentration (from REIT/log concentration) of 1 pmol/l suggest that enough receptors are occupied at chemically unmeasurable levels in plasma to induce an effect. The \"dissociation constant\" determined in vivo is of the same order as that from in vitro radioligand studies.", 
    "11": "The long-term effects of metoprolol monotherapy, 100 mg b.i.d., for 16-18 months, were investigated in 8 previously untreated essentially hypertensive patients (resting blood pressure greater than 155/95 mmHg) and echocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) (left ventricular mass by Penn Cube formula greater than 215 g). Echocardiographic studies, according to the American Society of Echocardiography recording techniques and measurements criteria, were performed before starting treatment and at the end of follow-up. Metoprolol induced a decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate, accompanied by a reduction of interventricular septum and posterior wall thickness (from 1.21 cm to 1.10 cm, and from 1.15 cm to 1.06 cm, respectively), left ventricular mass index and mean wall stress. All these changes were significant (p less than 0.01). Cardiac index decreased from 3017 ml/m2 to 2632 ml/m2 (p less than 0.01), mostly because of the reduction in the heart rate. In fact, stroke index, ejection fraction and fractional shortening all slightly increased during treatment in respect to pre-treatment values. Plasma renin activity fell from 1.45 ng/ml/h to 0.81 ng/ml/h (p less than 0.01), whereas both plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline concentration at rest did not change. Results indicate that in essentially hypertensive patients who have already developed LVH as a consequence of the hypertension, a long-term metoprolol therapy can successfully induce a reversal of LVH together with an effective blood pressure control, without noticeable adverse effects of changes in cardiac performance.", 
    "12": "Activities of alpha-hydroxybutyrate- and lactate dehydrogenases (HBDH, LDH), aspartate- and alanine aminotransferases (AST, ALT), alkaline phosphatase, alpha-amylase as well as content of total proteins, glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides and Ca2+ were estimated sprectrophotometrically in blood serum of rat males within 2 hrs after thermic burns of the III degree involving 15% the body surface. The burns caused about 2-fold increase in activities of LDH, HBDH and AST and in content of triglycerides in blood serum but did not affect the other biochemical patterns. Adrenalectomy, carried out within 3 days before the burns, accelerated and pseudoadrenalectomy decreased the early postburn enzymatic activation. Preadministration of reserpine, phentolamine and obsidane (propranolol) decreased distinctly the hyperenzymic reaction observed after the burn stress.", 
    "13": "The effects of the beta 1-adrenoceptor partial agonists ICI 118,587 (xamoterol) and SL 75.177.10 on the left ventricular inotropic state and relaxation rate were compared with those of digoxin in open-chest dogs. These agents were administered to three separate groups of dogs (5, 6, and 7 dogs, respectively). In each animal, the inotropic effects were assessed at fixed heart rate (atrial pacing) and at similar end-diastolic left ventricular diameter. Under these controlled conditions, ICI 118,587 (200 micrograms/kg) increased peak (+) dP/dt by 3176 +/- 363 mm Hg/s (p less than 0.005) and the slope of the end-systolic pressure/end-systolic diameter relation rose by 190% above the control value (p less than 0.01). These changes were significantly greater than after digoxin (100 micrograms/kg) which increased these indexes, respectively, by 2132 +/- 248 mm Hg/s (p less than 0.003) and by 31 +/- 4% (p less than 0.05). SL 75.177.10 (200 micrograms/kg) also increased dP/dt, but significantly less than did digoxin or ICI 118,587 (+428 +/- 105 mm Hg/s; p less than 0.007); the increase in end-systolic pressure/diameter slope was not different from that observed after digoxin. In contrast to ICI 118,587 which accelerated isovolumic relaxation (-7.6 ms in time constant of isovolumic pressure fall; p less than 0.01), neither SL 75.177.10 nor digoxin modified this phase of the cardiac cycle. Finally, at the dose used in the study, digoxin induced ventricular arrhythmias in all animals, a side effect which was never observed after ICI 118,587 or SL 75.177.10.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "14": "Propranolol (3.6 mg kg-1 day-1) was administered to guinea pigs for 14 days via subcutaneously implanted \"Alzet\" osmotic minipumps. Blockade of cardiac and vascular beta-adrenoceptors was confirmed by a depression of heart rate and blood pressure responses to isoprenaline in anaesthetized animals. After 14 days of propranolol treatment, minipumps were removed and 48 h later beta-adrenoceptor sensitivity was determined in cardiac and lung tissues. Left atrial inotropic responses were unaltered following propranolol withdrawal. However, right atrial chronotropic responses to sympathomimetic amines were supersensitive when compared with tissues from animals implanted with empty minipumps. Relaxation responses of lung strip preparations to beta-adrenoceptor agonists after withdrawal of propranolol were similar to controls. (3H)Dihydroalprenolol binding to ventricular and lung tissue indicated that there was no change in either the dissociation constant (KD) or the maximum number of (3H)DHA binding sites (Bm) in these tissues. These results suggest that following withdrawal from beta-adrenoceptor antagonist treatment there is a selective increase in the chronotropic sensitivity of the heart to sympathomimetic amines.", 
    "15": "beta-Adrenoceptor blocking agents might reduce blood pressure, in part, by blocking presynaptic beta-adrenoceptors. Absence of circulating epinephrine should then reduce the antihypertensive effect of propranolol. Biadrenalectomized Wistar-Kyoto rats were made hypertensive with methylprednisolone (20 mg/kg s.c. weekly), given for 2 weeks, and supplemented with deoxycorticosterone pivalate (10 mg/kg weekly). Sham-operated controls received the same treatment. Baseline weight, mean intraarterial blood pressure, and heart rate of the groups were the same. After propranolol (5 mg/kg s.c.) was administered to the unanesthetized rats, blood pressure fell within 90 min from 151 +/- 4 by 23 +/- 4 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM) in the adrenalectomized animals and from 153 +/- 4 by only 7 +/- 3 mm Hg in the sham-operated controls (p less than 0.001); heart rate fell by 91 +/- 13 beats/min in the adrenalectomized animals and by 40 +/- 11 beats/min in the controls (p less than 0.01). Propranolol's vehicle had no effect. At the end of the experiment, plasma epinephrine levels were less than 40 pg/ml for adrenalectomized rats, and 420 +/- 60 pg/ml for controls. Norepinephrine levels were approximately equal in the two groups. Since blood pressure fell despite virtual absence of circulating epinephrine, these results suggest that propranolol reduces blood pressure, at least in part, by mechanisms other than presynaptic beta-adrenoceptor blockade.", 
    "16": "Prenalterol is a new beta-adrenergic agonist which stimulates mainly beta 1-receptors, in contrast to isoprenaline which stimulates both beta 1- and beta 2-receptors. We studied the hemodynamic effects of prenalterol and isoprenaline in seven patients with complete heart block and idioventricular escape rhythm due to ischemic heart disease. Isoprenaline was given as a continuous infusion at two increasing doses (1.7 micrograms/min and 3.4 micrograms/min each given for 30 min). After the second dose of isoprenaline the cardiac index was increased from 2.27 +/- 0.06 to 3.61 +/- 0.60 1/min/m2, heart rate was increased from 34.1 +/- 1.2 to 50.4 +/- 3.1 beats/min and mean blood pressure was decreased by 12.4 mm Hg. Mean pulmonary artery pressure was increased by 2 mm Hg. Prenalterol was given as two i.v. bolus injections of 3.5 mg and 7.0 mg at 15-min intervals. The first dose of prenalterol increased the cardiac index from 2.22 +/- 0.10 to 2.42 +/- 0.12 and heart rate from 37.0 +/- 1.8 to 40.1 +/- 1.7. Mean blood pressure and mean pulmonary artery pressure were unchanged. The second dose of prenalterol did not change the hemodynamic variables significantly compared to the changes after the first dose. We conclude that isoprenaline is preferable to prenalterol for treatment of complete heart block.", 
    "17": "We analyzed the role of the renin-angiotensin system following alpha 2-, alpha 1-, or nonselective alpha-blockade in an intact organism in which both postsynaptic alpha-adrenoceptor types contribute to adrenergic vasoconstriction. In conscious dogs, alpha 2-blockade (0.3 mg/kg rauwolscine, n = 10) increased mean arterial pressure by 40 mm Hg, while hypotension by 8 mm Hg occurred following nonselective alpha-blockade (1.5 mg/kg phentolamine, n = 9) and by 20 mm Hg following alpha 1-blockade (1.2 mg/kg prazosin, n = 10). Plasma angiotensin II (pg/ml) rose by 103 +/- 28 (SEM), 143 +/- 48, and 58 +/- 15 following alpha 2-, nonselective alpha-, or alpha 1-blockade, respectively. While alpha 2- or nonselective alpha-blockade induced tachycardia and substantial elevations of plasma catecholamines, alpha 1-blockade did not. Beta-Blockade (2 mg/kg nadolol) attenuated the elevations of angiotensin following alpha 2- or nonselective alpha-blockade by 100 and 88%, respectively, without affecting the alpha 1-blockade-induced elevation, which is mainly mediated by the hypotension. Pretreatment with 3 mg/kg captopril reduced the pressure increase induced by alpha 2-blockade from 40 to 13 +/- 10 mm Hg and aggravated the decline in blood pressure induced by nonselective alpha-blockade from 8 to greater than 50 mm Hg. In anesthetized, spinalized dogs, both types of alpha-blockade competitively antagonized the pressor effect of the alpha 2-agonist azepexole by the same degree. It is concluded that, in the intact animal, the central and peripheral presynaptic augmentation of sympathoexcitation induced by alpha 2- or nonselective alpha-blockade leads to a strong beta-adrenergic activation of the renin-angiotensin system, independent of the concomitant changes in blood pressure. The constrictive action of the activation contributes substantially to the compensation of the vascular adrenoceptor blockade induced by nonselective or alpha 2-selective blockade in the intact organism.", 
    "18": "In 41 normotensive volunteers (diastolic pressure, less than 90 mm Hg) the beta 2-adrenoceptor density in lymphocytes was determined by (+/-)-125 iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) binding and compared with that in nine patients with borderline hypertension (diastolic pressure, 90-95 mm Hg) and 45 patients with established essential hypertension (diastolic pressure, greater than 95 mm Hg). The mean number of beta 2-adrenoceptors for controls was 774 +/- 49 (range, 300-1,500) ICYP binding sites/cell. In borderline hypertension it was significantly higher, with 1,037 +/- 22 (range, 950-1,150) sites/cell, and increased further in patients with essential hypertension to 1,424 +/- 72 (range, 700-2,700) sites/cell. The KD values for ICYP, however, were nearly the same in all groups (approximately 50 pM). Calculation of the data of all 95 subjects resulted in a significant positive correlation between beta 2-adrenoceptor density and mean arterial blood pressure (r = 0.637; p less than 0.001). Since the properties of beta 2-adrenoceptors in human lymphocytes resemble those in other tissues, the hypothesis is presented that the increased density of beta 2-adrenoceptors may reflect sympathetic hyperactivity in essential hypertension, which might contribute (perhaps via enhanced release of endogenous noradrenaline through stimulation of presynaptic beta 2-adrenoceptors by adrenaline) to the elevation of blood pressure.", 
    "19": "Isoprenaline bitartrate (0.5 microgram/kg/min i.v.) increased the rate of noradrenaline release into the circulation of pentobarbitone-anesthetized rabbits. This increase was much greater than that produced by an equi-hypotensive dose of the vasodilator hydralazine (0.2 mg/kg i.v.), suggesting that it was only partly due to baro-reflex activation of sympathetic nerves. This facilitatory effect of isoprenaline was also observed in the nephrectomized, pithed rabbit, with electrically stimulated sympathetic outflow, ruling out central nervous system and renin-angiotensin effects. ICI 118,551 HCl (0.3 mg/kg + 0.1 mg/kg/h i.v.) blocked the isoprenaline-induced hypotension, but did not affect the isoprenaline-induced tachycardia, suggesting that it selectively blocked beta 2-adrenoceptors. ICI 118,551 totally abolished the isoprenaline-induced increase in noradrenaline release, suggesting a beta 2-effect. Atenolol (0.3 mg/kg + 0.1 mg/kg/h) blocked the isoprenaline-induced tachycardia, a beta 1-effect, but only slightly attenuated the isoprenaline-induced increase in noradrenaline release. Atenolol by itself decreased heart rate and arterial pressure, but there was no reflex rise in the noradrenaline release rate, which suggests that atenolol impairs baroreceptor activation of sympathetic nerves. In another series of experiments, also in the pentobarbitone-anesthetized rabbit, adrenaline was released into the circulation by splanchnic nerve stimulation. This resulted in prolonged increases of adrenaline levels in heart tissue. After the plasma adrenaline levels had returned to prestimulation values, the rate of noradrenaline release into the plasma was enhanced. This increase was not observed in rabbits treated with either desipramine HCl (1 mg/kg i.v.) or propranolol HCl (2 mg/kg i.p.).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "20": "Experiments were conducted to examine the effects of prenalterol on renal function and renin secretion in anesthetized dogs. Specifically, we tested whether prenalterol alters renal function directly, or only indirectly as a consequence of a systemic action of the drug. Accordingly, prenalterol was infused into one renal artery for five consecutive 15-min periods, at incremental rates of 0.1, 0.3, 0.9, 2.7, and 8.1 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1. Heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure were recorded, and renal functions and renin secretion rates were measured bilaterally. Direct intrarenal prenalterol infusion caused a 60 bpm increase in heart rate and resulted in marked increases in renin secretion rates from both kidneys. Intrarenal prenalterol infusion also reduced urinary sodium and potassium excretions bilaterally and equally. There were no consistent changes in mean arterial blood pressure, or in glomerular filtration rate or renal blood flow, during prenalterol infusion. We conclude that although prenalterol increases renin secretion rate markedly and may alter renal electrolyte excretion, these effects are not mediated by a direct intrarenal action of the drug.", 
    "21": "In animals and man, the selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist indoramin reduces arterial pressure without increasing heart rate. We studied this mechanism of absence of reflex tachycardia in anaesthetised dogs. Indoramin reduced (p less than 0.05) arterial pressure with no reflex increase in heart rate, whereas phenoxybenzamine reduced (p less than 0.05) pressure but increased (p less than 0.05) heart rate. Atropine and propranolol pretreatment, vagotomy and division of the cardio-accelerator nerve did not prevent the reduction (p less than 0.05) in arterial pressure and heart rate seen with indoramin. Mexiletine, a drug which has membrane-stabilising activity, had no effect on heart rate or arterial pressure. Mexiletine and indoramin did not affect the increases in heart rate produced by stimulation of the cardio-accelerator nerve. Indoramin reduced (p less than 0.05) the increases in heart rate and arterial pressure produced by bilateral carotid occlusion, and potentiated the arterial pressure reduction but attenuated the heart rate response to intravenous isoprenaline. It also reduced (nonsignificantly) the responses to intravenous noradrenaline and phenylethylamine but had no effect on the arterial pressure and heart rate responses to bilateral central vagal stimulation. We conclude that the absence of the reflex tachycardia with hypotensive doses of indoramin does not result from the myocardial membrane-stabilising action of indoramin or from alteration in sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, but may occur partly from a reduction in baroreceptor sensitivity.", 
    "22": "The beta-adrenergic receptor blocking properties of ACC-9089 were studied in isolated cardiac and tracheal tissues from guinea pigs and in anesthetized dogs. The compound was a potent, nonselective beta-blocker in isolated tissues (atrial pA2 8.01; tracheal pA2 8.16). ACC-9089 was without intrinsic sympathomimetic action and caused direct cardiac depression only at concentrations that were four orders of magnitude higher than its pA2. In anesthetized dogs, ACC-9089 produced steady-state beta-blockade within 20 min of initiation of 3-h intravenous infusions. Recovery from beta-blockade occurred rapidly following termination of infusion (80% recovery in 17 +/- 2 min after 1.2 microgram/kg/min). Intravenous infusion of ACC-9089 caused dose-dependent inhibition of heart rate responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation and inhibition of isoproterenol-induced decreases in perfusion pressure in a perfused hindlimb preparation. The compound (a) did not produce alpha-blockade; (b) had no direct effect on hindlimb vascular resistance; and (c) did not alter hemodynamic variables in catecholamine-depleted dogs. The results indicate that ACC-9089 is a novel, ultra-short-acting beta-blocker that does not possess direct cardiovascular effects beyond those expected as a result of beta-blockade.", 
    "23": "Large doses (960 to 3200 mg/day) of propranolol were taken by eight patients with chronic schizophrenia in a double-blind therapeutic trial. To investigate the effects of such treatment on central monoaminergic processes, samples of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were drawn before starting the study and after 31 to 63 days (means = 49 days) on propranolol. Concentrations in CSF of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), and homovanillic acid (HVA), the principal metabolites of norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine, were determined by HPLC with electrochemical detection. The level of HVA did not change. CSF 5-HIAA levels decreased an average of 34%, which indicates reduced turnover of serotonin in the central nervous system (CNS). There was a strong correlation between duration of treatment with propranolol and change in CSF 5-HIAA levels. The concentration of MHPG in CSF increased an average of 39%; this could have resulted from increased turnover of CNS norepinephrine as a consequence of the blockade of central beta-adrenoceptors or of altered metabolism and clearance of peripheral MHPG. Psychotic symptoms of the patients, as indicated by the 3-day average score on the Bunney-Hamburg scale, were not affected by treatment.", 
    "24": "Quinidine coadministered with propranolol produces antiarrhythmic potentiation. The mechanism is uncertain although some in vitro electrophysiologic studies have suggested that it may be due to propranolol-induced cardiac beta receptor blockade. Other effects of propranolol, however, including a decrease in cardiac sympathetic nerve activity as well as some direct cardiac membrane effects might also contribute. The possible contributions of these effects were studied indirectly by coadministering quinidine with several compounds (d-propranolol, l-propranolol, d-practolol, practolol, pronethalol, and phenytoin) which have varying effects on these parameters. Antiarrhythmic activity was determined as protection against chloroform-induced ventricular arrhythmias and beta blockade as inhibition of isoproterenol-induced tachycardia. Only d- and l-propranolol and phenytoin potentiated quinidine. The d-isomer was only approximately 1/8th as potent as the l-isomer for inhibiting isoproterenol tachycardia, and the lowest dose of the d-isomer coadministered with quinidine produced antiarrhythmic potentiation but little if any inhibition of isoproterenol tachycardia. The results suggest that cardiac beta blockade alone does not adequately explain the potentiation of quinidine by propranolol in the mouse. Perhaps a decrease in cardiac sympathetic nerve activity and the direct membrane effects as occur with d-, l-, and d,l-propranolol and phenytoin may also contribute to the potentiation.", 
    "25": "The aim of the first part of this work is to present the theory of the radioreceptor assay and to compare it to the other techniques of radioanalysis (radioimmunoassay, competitive protein binding assays). The technology of the radioreceptor assay is then presented and its components (preparation of the receptors, radioligand, incubation medium) are described. The analytical characteristics of the radioreceptor assay (specificity, sensitivity, reproducibility, accuracy) and the pharmacological significance of the results are discussed. The second part is devoted to the description of the radioreceptor assays of some pharmacological classes (neuroleptics, tricyclic antidepressants, benzodiazepines, beta-blockers, anticholinergic drugs) and to their use in therapeutic drug monitoring. In conclusion, by their nature, radioreceptor assays are highly sensitive, reliable, precise, accurate and simple to perform. Their chief disadvantage relates to specificity, since any substance having an appreciable affinity to the receptor site will displace the specifically bound radioligand. Paradoxically in some cases, this lack of specificity may be advantageous in that it allows for the detection of not only the apparent compound but of active metabolites and endogenous receptor agonists as well and in that radioreceptors assays can be devised for a whole pharmacological class and not only for one drug as it is the case for classical physico-chemical techniques. For all these reasons future of radioreceptor assay in pharmacology appears promising.", 
    "26": "beta-Endorphin (0.03 to 1.00 microgram/kg, ip) impaired retention of a one-trial inhibitory avoidance task in a dose-dependent manner when injected into male Swiss mice immediately post-training, as indicated by retention performance 48 h later. The doses of 0.03 and 0.10 microgram/kg significantly impaired retention while the two higher doses (0.30 and 1.00 microgram/kg) did not significantly affect retention as compared with the control group, but tended to increase retention as compared with the dose of 0.10 microgram/kg. Thus, the dose-response curve shows an U-shaped form. The simultaneous injection of naloxone (0.1 mg/kg, ip) not only shifted the dose-response curve to the right but also prevented the tendency to increase retention latencies of the two higher doses. The two lower doses of beta-endorphin did not lengthen latencies to step-through of mice that had not received a footshock during the training while, under these conditions, the two higher doses of the peptide significantly increased latencies to step-through. This effect was prevented by naloxone (0.1 mg/kg). Taken together these results suggest that the effects of beta-endorphin on retention are the consequence of an interaction with opioid receptors and indicate that the right ascending arm of the dose-response curve would probably be due to a punitive effect of beta-endorphin which was also prevented by naloxone. The impairing effect of post-training administration of beta-endorphin (0.10 microgram/kg) on memory was time-dependent, since it was decreased as the training-treatment interval was increased. These results rule out a pharmacological proactive effect of beta-endorphin on retention performance and suggest that beta-endorphin affects memory consolidation. The simultaneous administration of beta-endorphin (0.10 microgram/kg) with the central muscarinic agonist oxotremorine (12.5 or 50.0 micrograms/kg) completely prevented the impairment of retention induced by beta-endorphin, while the simultaneous administration of the central-acting anticholinesterase physostigmine (17 or 68 micrograms/kg) only partially but significantly attenuated the effect of beta-endorphin on retention. Further, the peripheral-acting anticholinesterase neostigmine (68 micrograms/kg) and the nicotinic blocker hexamethonium (5 mg/kg) modified neither retention nor the behavioral effects of beta-endorphin. These results suggest that the impairment of retention induced by beta-endorphin is probably due to an inhibition of acetylcholine release at central cholinergic synapses which are critical for memory formation.", 
    "27": "After reversible causes have been excluded and precipitating factors eliminated therapy of chronic heart failure is performed to achieve the following goals: A reduction of cardiac work by physical restriction; the increased risk of thromboembolic complications should be met by special physical exercises, elastic stockings and a low-dose heparin therapy in hospitalized patients. To improve the contractility of the heart muscle by digitalis. The efficacy of digitalis has been demonstrated by a double-blind study. It cannot be excluded, however, that digitalis therapy may be associated with an increased mortality in patients with coronary artery disease and complex ventricular arrhythmias. To eliminate symptoms of congestion. To reduce pre- and afterload by vasodilators. The application of vasodilators has become an established therapy in patients who do not respond to conventional therapy with digitalis and diuretics. By activation of the adrenergic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system-an initially useful compensatory mechanism to sustain blood pressure and stroke volume-peripheral vascular resistance and end-diastolic volume increase in patients with chronic heart failure. Both factors contribute to an increase in afterload, thereby further diminishing left ventricular function. In this situation vasodilators are particularly effective. According to their main mode of action they alter venous capacity and/or systemic vascular resistance to a different degree. Knowledge of their effects is necessary for a successful application in individual patients.", 
    "28": "Bevantolol hydrochloride, a new beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, has been shown to be cardioselective in animals. To evaluate its selectivity in humans, a double-blind, crossover study was conducted in 8 asthmatics. Following a single oral dose of placebo, bevantolol 75 or 150 mg or propranolol hydrochloride 40 mg, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), heart rate, blood pressure and skeletal muscle tremor were measured before and after 4 increasing intravenous doses of terbutaline sulfate to establish terbutaline dose-response curves. The FEV1 decreased after all active treatments. During terbutaline infusions there was an increase in FEV1 after both bevantolol doses and placebo. The terbutaline dose-response curve after bevantolol shifted to the right, however. After propranolol, there was no increase in FEV1 during terbutaline stimulation. Heart rate and skeletal muscle tremor showed a similar pattern during the experiment. In dosages that have previously been shown to produce at least the same degree of blockade of exercise-induced tachycardia, bevantolol has less influence on terbutaline-induced bronchodilation, heart rate increase and skeletal muscle tremor than did propranolol. Thus bevantolol has relative beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist selectivity. Drawing upon the results of a previous study in the same patients, we believe bevantolol, atenolol and metoprolol have similar beta 1-selectivity.", 
    "29": "This study was performed to record the occurrence of clinically important supraventricular tachyarrhythmias (SVA) during the first eight days following coronary bypass surgery after preoperative withdrawal of various betablockers and to investigate whether low dose propranolol medication postoperatively could reduce the occurrence of such arrhythmias. Forty patients with stable angina pectoris were postoperatively randomly assigned to either a group (B) receiving low doses of propranolol or to a group (A) not receiving this medication. The number of patients having episodes of clinically important SVA was recorded. Two out of sixteen patients in the propranolol group had such episodes compared with nine out of twenty without postoperative betablockade (p = 0.07). Thus among patients treated with various betablockers which were withdrawn prior to coronary surgery, the occurrence of postoperative clinically important SVA could not be significantly reduced by postoperative low dose propranolol administration.", 
    "30": "The paper discusses the data on the effect of adrenergic innervation on the cerebral circulation and possible approaches to the pharmacological action on cerebral blood vessels constriction. Attention is also paid to the effect of alpha-adrenoblockers (dihydroergotoxin, phenoxybenzamine, phentolamine, etc) on adrenoreactive structures and of that of sympatholytics (reserpine, octadin, ornid) on the presynaptic membrane of the adrenoreceptor. Relaxation or elimination of cerebral vessels spasms was observed under the influence of the drugs capable of affecting the central component of cerebral circulation control. Drugs with central adrenergic (nialamide, nitroglycerin) and GABA-ergic (GABA, sodium hydroxybutyrate, depaquin, diazepam, phenazepam, etc) activity exerted the same effect.", 
    "31": "The hemodynamic effects of butofilolol, a new beta-blocking agent, were studied in hypertensive patients. Results were compared to those obtained under the same experimental conditions with propranolol and atenolol. The beta-blocking activities of the three substances were assessed using the beta-adrenergic stimulation test described by Fitzgerald. The evaluation of hemodynamic effects was based on changes in the following parameters: systemic blood pressures, pulmonary blood pressures, cardiac output (systemic and pulmonary) arterial resistance (right and left) ventricular work and ejection rate. Results on butofilolol were as follows: early decrease in the cardiac index without significant change in the systolic index; later on, significant fall in systemic BP while pulmonary BP did not rise, indicating a mild repercussion on the left ventricular function; significant decrease in the right and left ventricular work. As compared with propranolol and atenolol, systemic BP was decreased more significantly on butofilolol. Moreover, the influence of butofilolol on the left ventricular function as assessed by the systolic index and pulmonary BP was less strongly marked than that of the other two substances.", 
    "32": "Since up to 90% of a theophylline dose is biotransformed, drugs influencing microsomal enzyme systems in the liver may affect the elimination of theophylline. Other integrated mechanisms (e.g. hepatic uptake) may also be altered by concurrent administration of other drugs. Whatever the mechanism, the interaction may be sufficient to necessitate adjustment of the theophylline dosage, preferably guided by plasma theophylline determinations. Comedication with phenobarbitone may require an increase of the theophylline dose by about 30% due to increased clearance resulting from enzyme induction. Similarly, with phenytoin and carbamazepine a dose increase of about 40 to 50% may be required. In the case of rifampicin, isoniazid or sulphinpyrazone comedication, an increase of the theophylline dose by about 20 to 25% may be needed. On the other hand, other drugs decrease theophylline clearance, making a reduction in the dose of concurrent theophylline advisable: with usual doses of erythromycin, propranolol and isoprenaline (isoproterenol), a reduction of about 25% is needed; with cimetidine and oral contraceptives by about 30% or more; and with triacetyloleandomycin (troleandomycin) by about 50%. In high doses, the xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinol can also retard theophylline elimination, and a reduction of the theophylline dose by about 20% may be advisable. Conflicting results have been reported on the influence of frusemide (furosemide) and influenza vaccines, while data regarding the effect of corticosteroids, benzodiazepines and verapamil on theophylline kinetics are not yet conclusive.

Some are from the same therapeutic group as the drugs mentioned above and offer clinical alternatives for coadministration with theophylline. Examples of drugs not found to have a significant effect on theophylline pharmacokinetics are ranitidine, josamycin, midecamycin, amoxycillin, tetracycline, cephalexin, cefaclor, orciprenaline, metoprolol, antacids, medroxyprogesterone acetate, metoclopramide and metronidazole. Most of the drugs discussed in this review appear not to affect the volume of distribution of theophylline significantly.",

    "34": "Catecholamines (adrenaline, isoproterenol) and L-DOPA decreased the mitotic index of L-cells in culture. The action of catecholamines was blocked by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, but was not abolished by the alpha-adrenoblocker phenoxybezamine. The L-DOPA-induced decrease in the mitotic index did not depend on the pretreatment with the adrenoblockers. Catecholamines inhibited the incorporation of 3H-thymidine and 3H-leucine into DNA and total protein of the cells, respectively. Preincubation of the culture with propranolol for 10-20 minutes before catecholamine administration prevented the action of catecholamines. Phenoxybenzamine, an alpha-adrenoreceptor blocker, did not produce such an effect. The data obtained point to the leading role of beta-adrenoreceptors in the mechanism of the effects of catecholamines on proliferative processes. The action of L-DOPA on cell proliferation does not seem to be linked with adrenoreceptor activation.", 
    "35": "It has been demonstrated in rat experiments that the beta-adrenoblockers propranolol and pindolol differ in the influence on the therapeutic and toxic effects of voltaren and acetylsalicylic acid. Propranolol has an analgetic action of its own, reducing the analgetic and antiinflammatory effects of voltaren and acetylsalicylic acid. It potentiates the antipyretic effect of voltaren and ulcerogenic action of both nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Pindolol exerts both analgetic and antiinflammatory action and does not affect the antipyretic effect of voltaren and ulcerogenic action of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. The difference in the action of the beta-adrenoblockers under study is likely to be linked with the characteristics of their pharmacological action spectrum.", 
    "36": "Both betaxolol and propranolol, beta blockers with different pharmacological properties, increase the reliability of somatotropic testing with glucagon. The combination of glucagon and betaxolol, however, is much better tolerated than that of glucagon and propranolol. The use of a beta 1 cardioselective adrenoceptor block for growth hormone testing is recommended.", 
    "37": "Intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) describes the partial beta-adrenergic agonist responses elicited by a series of beta-adrenergic antagonists. The dual effect on the beta-adrenergic receptor appears to be related to structural specificity of the drugs allowing competitive binding to the receptor (antagonist activity) and partial interaction at the receptor's activation site (agonist activity). The clinical effects of a beta-adrenergic antagonist with ISA depend on the relative balance of the drug's inherent antagonist and agonist activity and on the degree of underlying sympathetic tone in the patient. Theoretically, the agonist activity may be beneficial in the patient in whom beta-adrenergic antagonists are indicated, but who has concomitant bradycardia and/or mild to moderate congestive heart failure or compromised pulmonary function, or in the patient being withdrawn from beta-adrenergic antagonist therapy. There is positive evidence from clinical trials that in select patient populations a few of these benefits of ISA are afforded without compromise to beta-adrenergic antagonist activity. However, predisposing factors such as acute illness and individual idiosyncrasies may interfere with the manifestations of the agonist effects. Further, maximal response to full beta-adrenergic agonists will be diminished by concurrent therapy with beta-adrenergic antagonists regardless of ISA presence. In summary, ISA does have a physiological basis and increased experience in larger patient populations will help to place it in proper clinical perspective.", 
    "38": "We have studied the recovery of receptor binding and of isoprenaline-stimulated cyclic AMP responses after chronic (2-5 days) exposure of tissue-cultured living rat heart cells to several beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. Most experiments were performed with [3H]- (+/-)-carazolol and [3H]-(+/-)-CGP 12177, as prototypes of high affinity lipophilic and hydrophilic ligands respectively. Chronic antagonist treatment did not alter the total number of receptors nor did it cause intracellular accumulation of the ligands. At the end of the treatment, radiolabelled antagonists were displaced either by 'infinite' dilution of the incubation medium or by competitive displacement with the non-labelled ligand (-)-timolol. In dilution assays dissociation of carazolol from specific sites was biphasic with t 1/2 values of 41 +/- 14 and 219 +/- 15 min. Dissociation of CGP 12177 was monophasic with t 1/2 of 102 +/- 2 min. Timolol enhanced the dissociation rates of both radioligands and suppressed the slow phase of carazolol dissociation. Isoprenaline-stimulated cyclic AMP formation did not recover in parallel with the release of the two antagonists from receptor binding sites. To reach about 80% of control values for receptor availability or cyclic AMP response required 3 h and 24 h washout periods, respectively, after carazolol (0.2 nM) treatment, or 1.5 and 12 h washout periods after CGP 12177 (4 nM) treatment. Such a 'decoupling' effect was not observed during recovery from chronic exposure to the antagonists, timolol and propranolol. We conclude that some antagonists cause a novel form of desensitization that is not linked to their partial agonistic potency. Moreover, carazolol-type drugs seem to induce an additional isomeric form of the beta-receptor that is not recognized by other antagonists. These observations could explain the well known discrepancy between long duration of action and rapid removal from the circulation of several antagonists in current therapeutic use.",

Another well established drug, propranolol, may have found a further useful therapeutic role in preventing bleeding from these vessels. However, before widespread use of these drugs can be endorsed further evidence of their efficacy and safety must be produced.", 
    "40": "The acute haemodynamic effects of oral prenalterol were studied in 14 patients with severe heart failure (NYHA class III) due to ischaemic heart disease. All had received treatment with digoxin, diuretics, and in most cases vasodilators. Prenalterol was administered at two hourly intervals to give cumulative doses of 20, 50, and 100 mg and mean plasma concentrations of 53, 97, and 175 nmol/l. Haemodynamic measurements were made two hours after each dose with Swan-Ganz catheterisation; cardiac output was measured by thermodilution. There were no significant changes in heart rate, mean arterial pressure, or pulmonary artery diastolic pressure after the drug. Cardiac index rose significantly after 50 mg and 100 mg prenalterol. Oral prenalterol has a beneficial short term haemodynamic effect in patients with severe heart failure. If this effect is sustained prenalterol may be of value in the long term management of patients with this disabling condition.", 
    "41": "Severe anaphylaxis is reported in a bee venom-sensitive 31-year-old male while receiving propranolol. His anaphylactic reaction was mainly respiratory and was refractory to emergency treatment. We believe that his use of beta-blockers contributed to the severity of his anaphylaxis and refractoriness to treatment. We suggest that beta-blockers should be contraindicated or alternate medications used in hymenoptera allergic patients.", 
    "42": "Three groups of anesthetized puppies 16.4 +/- 1.2 (group I), 29.6 +/- 1.6 (group II), and 49.8 +/- 2.5 (group III) days of age were used to assess the renal response to graded doses of dopamine infusion into the renal artery. Dopamine infusion at 1 microgram X kg-1 X min-1 increased renal blood flow (RBF) from 3.61 +/- 0.31 to 4.22 +/- 0.43 ml X min-1 X g kidney wet wt-1 (P less than 0.05) only in the older puppies (group III). Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) increased in groups II and III from control values of 0.69 +/- 0.14 and 0.61 +/- 0.08 to 1.08 +/- 0.19 and 0.83 +/- 0.05 ml X min-1 X g kidney wet wt-1, respectively (P less than 0.05). However, urinary flow rate and sodium excretion were variably affected. Because dopamine is known to stimulate both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors in addition to dopamine receptors, two additional groups of puppies 11.2 +/- 1.2 (group IV) and 72.8 +/- 2.4 (group V) days of age were studied to evaluate the renal effects of dopamine during the continuous intrarenal infusion of phentolamine and nadolol (an alpha- and a beta-adrenergic blocker, respectively). Dopamine elicited increases in RBF only in the older puppies (P less than 0.05). GFR, urinary flow rate, and sodium excretion increased in both groups; however, the magnitude of the change was greater for each parameter in the older group (P less than 0.05). These experiments suggest a maturational process for specific dopamine receptors and/or effector response, which may affect the observed age-dependent increases in RBF, GFR, and renal sodium handling.", 
    "43": "Activation and inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity is mediated via two distinct GTP-binding proteins. In both stimulatory and inhibitory systems, receptor occupancy by a hormone or agonist drug stabilizes receptor interactions with its functionally associated GTP-binding protein and, as a consequence, facilitates GTP occupancy of the regulatory protein. Activation of cyclase proceeds until GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP. Although hormonal inhibition of cyclase is elicited by a sequence of molecular events seemingly parallel to those for activation of cyclase, it is not known whether hormonal inhibition of cyclase involves the direct interaction of the GTP-occupied inhibitory regulatory protein with the catalytic subunit or results indirectly from destabilization of the interaction of the stimulatory GTP-binding protein with the catalytic moiety. Sodium ion also modulates receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase, although apparently via a component distinct from the GTP-binding subunit of the inhibitory GTP-binding protein. Sodium also influences the physiological functions elicited by receptors that mediate inhibition of cyclase, at least for alpha 2-adrenergic-promoted platelet secretion. The relationship between sodium effects on hormonal attenuation of cAMP accumulation and elicited physiological effects is discussed.", 
    "44": "The synthesis of a group of potential beta-blockers bearing a new 5-ethoxysalicylamide substituent on nitrogen is described. These compounds were tested for beta-adrenergic blocking potency in vitro and compared with analogous compounds bearing a tert-butyl group on nitrogen. The new N-substituent increased the beta-blocking potency substantially. In a series of five homologous compounds of the type Ar(CH2)nCHOHCH2NHR (R = 5-ethoxysalicylamide; n = 0-4), two maxima of beta-blocking potency were found for n = 0 and 2. Moreover, the carbon isostere of the corresponding (aryloxy)propanolamine still proved to be a very potent beta-blocker. The ether oxygen in the side chain is therefore not an absolute requirement for activity. Structure-activity relationships are discussed.", 
    "45": "In order to define the alteration of the function of the adrenergic system in hypertension, we studied directly the receptor-cyclase coupling protein (N protein), which is one of the components of the enzyme adenylate cyclase. N protein was determined in erythrocyte membranes of patients with essential hypertension and normal subjects, with a complementation assay in vitro. Fifteen normal subjects and 18 patients with essential hypertension (eight untreated and ten treated with beta-adrenoreceptor blocking drugs alone or in combination with other antihypertensive drugs), and two patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ia (known to have deficient N protein activity), were studied. Erythrocyte N protein activities in the various groups expressed as percentages of the means +/- SD of normals were: normal subjects 100 + 13.7, untreated hypertensive 108.9 +/- 20.4, treated hypertensive 104.3 +/- 11.3 and pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ia 43%. The difference between N protein activity in the hypertensive patients and normals was not statistically significant. We suggest that the molecular basis for the altered sympathetic responsiveness in essential hypertension may reside in other components of the cyclic AMP protein kinase effector system.",

    "47": "In view of clinical interest in the efficacy of beta-adrenergic blockade during acute myocardial infarction (AMI), we have determined the long-term effect of therapy on scar formation after experimental myocardial ischemia. Intact anesthetized dogs underwent acute occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery, by means of a balloon catheter, which permitted monitoring of the aortic-peripheral coronary artery pressure gradient during the 4-hour period of balloon inflation. Practolol administration was begun 15 minutes after the onset of ischemia in group A. Control animals (group B) received procainamide to approximate the antiarrhythmic action of beta blockade. Only group A exhibited significant reduction in the ST segments during acute ischemia. Chronic therapy was maintained for 1 month and the mature scar formed in the myocardium was assessed after 4 months. The extent of subendocardial scar was similar in both groups but subepicardial scar formation was significantly less in group A. There was also a significant decrease in the percentage of total myocardium involved with scar in this treatment group. Although thinning of the left ventricular wall was similar for both groups in the central scar region, this process was significantly reduced at the lateral margin in group A. Thus, specific beta-receptor blockade during acute myocardial ischemia and sustained during the repair process can result in a reduced quantity and altered distribution of mature scar.", 
    "48": "In relation to decreased metabolic sensitivity to catecholamines observed, in vitro, in brown fat of cold-acclimated rats, beta-adrenergic receptors were studied in isolated cells and in a crude membrane preparation from rat interscapular brown adipose tissue. [3H] dihydroalprenolol binding had the same characteristics in both types of preparation; competition studies of [3H] dihydroalprenolol binding led to the characterization of beta 1 subtype adrenergic receptors with a lower affinity of beta-adrenergic agonists for [3H] dihydroalprenolol binding sites in membranes than that found in isolated cells. Cold acclimation produced, in isolated cells only, a decrease of 41% in the [3H] dihydroalprenolol binding sites and a beta-adrenergic agonist affinity increase. It is concluded that beta-adrenergic receptor decrease could be a factor, at the hormone receptor interaction level, in the regulation of the transmission of biological action responsible for the cold-induced decrease in catecholamine responsiveness in brown adipose tissue. For a study of the desensitization process in brown fat, isolated cells seem to offer certain advantages over a crude membrane preparation.", 
    "49": "We used intracellular microelectrodes to study the effect of alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation on automaticity of sheep cardiac Purkinje fibers exposed to low (10(-5) - 4 X 10(-5) M) barium concentrations. Concentrations of norepinephrine (NE) (3 X 10(-8) - 3 X 10(-7) M), which did not induce spontaneous activity in the absence of barium, consistently induced or enhanced it (if already present) in the presence of barium. Similar results were obtained in the presence of practolol (10(-6) M), which in 13 out of 17 experiments did not counteract the effect of NE. However, phentolamine (3 X 10(-7) M) caused a slowing or blocking of the spontaneous activity induced by NE in barium-treated preparations either in the presence or in the absence of practolol. We conclude that alpha-adrenergic responsiveness is enhanced in barium-treated Purkinje fibers and that under these experimental conditions, alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation may influence automaticity. The possible mechanisms underlying such effects are discussed.", 
    "50": "The effects of physical training on beta-adrenergic receptors were evaluated in heart ventricular tissue of diabetic rats. Mild diabetes mellitus was induced in rats with streptozotocin (45 mg/kg, iv). They were then submitted to a progressive 10-week running programme on a treadmill. Binding studies were done at six different concentrations of (-) [3H]dihydroalprenolol (0.5 to 14.4 nM) with ventricular membrane preparations from control (n = 13), sedentary diabetic (n = 9) and trained diabetic rats (n = 10). Direct linear plot analysis of the data revealed that the total number of beta-adrenoceptors was reduced in sedentary diabetic rats as compared to control (2231 +/- 207 vs 2922 +/- 211 fmol/ventricles; P less than 0.05); however, there was no significant change in the receptor density expressed as fmol/mg of membrane protein (40 +/- 3 vs 43 +/- 3; P greater than 0.05). On the other hand, the beta-adrenergic binding sites were decreased in training diabetic rats, either expressed as the total number of receptors (1920 +/- 179 vs 2922 +/- 211; P less than 0.01), or as fmol/mg of membrane protein (30 +/- 3 vs 43 +/- 3; P less than 0.01). There was no significant change in the dissociation constant (KD) of these receptors between groups (KD = 4.08 +/- 0.51, 4.69 +/- 0.93 and 2.88 +/- 0.39 nM respectively for control, sedentary diabetic and diabetic trained animals). The basal epinephrine concentration was significantly increased in trained diabetic rats (102 +/- 21 pg/ml vs 47 +/- 7 for control (P less than 0.05) and vs 49 +/- 9 for sedentary diabetic (P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Binding was reduced to less than half of control values in cell lines from 4 out of 6 manic-depressives and only 1 out of 18 unaffected relatives or controls. All the cell lines with reduced beta-adrenoceptor binding came from 3 families; members of the remaining 2 families showed normal binding. These findings suggest that genetic heterogeneity is present in manic-depressive disorder and that a beta-adrenoceptor defect may influence genetic susceptibility to the disorder.", 
    "52": "In mice, injected subcutaneously with nitroglycerin (GTN) for 12 days, adrenaline exhibited an increased toxicity. The LD50 value for adrenaline in control animals was 11.1 mg/kg b.wt. In GTN-treated animals the LD50 value for adrenaline, measured 3 days after the last injection of GTN, was 9.1 mg/kg b.wt. (P = 0.05). In the animals sensitized with GTN, the adrenergic alpha-receptor blocker phentolamine (1 or 10 mg/kg b.wt.) protected from the lethal action of adrenaline (P = 0.06 and P = 0.001, respectively). A low dose (1 mg/kg b.wt.) of the adrenergic beta receptor blocker propranolol, was without effect while a higher dose (10 mg/kg b.wt.) potentiated the toxicity of adrenaline (P = 0.007). The alpha 1 adrenoreceptor antagonist, prazosin, (1 or 10 mg/kg b.wt.) was found to be highly effective in protecting the GTN-sensitized mice towards adrenaline (P = 0.003 and P = 0.001, respectively). By contrast, the alpha 2 adrenoreceptor antagonist, yohimbine, (1 or 10 mg/kg b.wt.) was much less effective (P = 0.988 and P = 0.111, respectively). It is concluded that the lethal action of adrenaline was caused by stimulation of alpha 1 adrenoreceptors, and that long term treatment with GTN caused a sensitization of these receptors in mice. The possible relevance of this finding for the reported withdrawal symptoms and sudden death phenomenon in nitroglycerin-exposed industrial workers is discussed.", 
    "53": "The present study was undertaken to study the effects of long-term streptozotocin-induced diabetes on ventricular autonomic receptors. Left ventricle and lungs were removed from animals sacrificed either 3 or 6 months after streptozotocin administration (65 mg/kg). Diabetic rats were significantly smaller and had elevated serum glucose and reduced serum insulin values as compared with their age-matched controls. The alpha-1, beta adrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic receptors were identified and characterized utilizing [3H]prazosin, [3H]dihydroalprenolol and [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate, respectively. Saturation studies showed that in the 3-month study, ventricular alpha-1 receptor density was significantly decreased in diabetic rats while beta and muscarinic receptor numbers exhibited only a slight reduction in their number. Equilibrium, dissociation constants or (KD), however, were similar for all three classes of receptors in 3 month diabetic and control rats. The advancement of diabetes from 3 to 6 months produced a further decrease in alpha receptor number. Furthermore, ventricular beta and muscarinic receptors from 6 month diabetic rats demonstrated a large reduction in their densities as compared with their age-matched controls. As in the 3-month study, the KD values were not affected by the induction of diabetes in any of the receptor systems studied. Inhibition (competition) studies performed in ventricular membranes from the 6-month study demonstrated inhibitory constants (Ki) consistent with labeling alpha-1, beta and muscarinic receptors. Ki values were similar in control and diabetic tissues with one exception: ventricular alpha-1 receptors were found to have a higher affinity for phenylephrine in the diabetic tissue.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "54": "The beta adrenoceptor has been identified in this study to be the receptor responsible for the enhanced immunoglobulin M antibody response produced by norepinephrine in mouse spleen cells immunized with sheep erythrocytes in vitro. The magnitude and kinetics of the enhanced antibody response to norepinephrine alone, or to norepinephrine in the presence of phentolamine, were more closely mimicked with a beta-2 adrenoceptor agonist (terbutaline) than with a beta-1 adrenoceptor agonist (dobutamine). Norepinephrine alone, norepinephrine in the presence of phentolamine, or terbutaline exposure produced a number of spleen cells secreting immunoglobulin M antibody that is equal to control on day 4 after immunization and which is enhanced above control on days 5, 6 and 7. Dobutamine causes no change when compared to control on days 4 and 5, but causes a delayed decline in the response on days 6 and 7. All drug responses were concentration-dependent and propranolol antagonized the enhanced response observed in the presence of terbutaline or dobutamine alone. When norepinephrine was added to immunized spleen cell cultures in the presence of propranolol, an alpha adrenoceptor-mediated component was unmasked which produced an enhanced response on day 4 after immunization and returned to control levels on days 5, 6 and 7. These results suggest that antibody responses can be modulated positively by a sympathetic neurotransmitter. This up-modulation by norepinephrine is beta adrenoceptor-mediated at the time of, and after, peak control response and alpha adrenoceptor-mediated 1 day before peak control response.", 
    "55": "Synthetic bovine parathyroid hormone containing the 1-34 NH2 terminal amino acids [bPTH-(1-34)] is capable of inhibiting stimulated uterine contraction. The purpose of the present investigation is to determine whether the inhibitory action of bPTH-(1-34) is a direct action of the hormone fragment. The effect of different synthetic preparations of bPTH-(1-34), salmon calcitonin, corticotropin-inhibiting peptide and bovine serum albumin on oxytocin-stimulated uterine contraction was determined. In addition, the effects of atropine, propranolol, phentolamine, pyrilamine, cimetidine and the prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor indomethacin on the inhibitory action of bPTH-(1-34) on uterine contraction was determined. Both synthetic preparations of bPTH-(1-34) inhibited oxytocin-initiated contractions similarly. Salmon calcitonin, corticotropin-inhibiting peptide, and bovine serum albumin did not alter oxytocin-stimulated uterine contractions. The salmon calcitonin also did not alter the ability of bPTH-(1-34) to exert its inhibitory effect on uterine contraction. Cholinergic, alpha and beta adrenergic, histaminergic (H1 and H2) and prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors did not alter the action of bPTH-(1-34). These results suggest that the action of bPTH-(1-34) is 1) not due to the presence of a contaminant in the synthetic hormone preparation and 2) that the effect could be due to a direct action effect of the hormone fragment on uterine tissue.", 
    "56": "Peripheral alpha- and beta-adrenergic control of uterine blood flow (UBF) during acute heat stress of the gravid ewe was investigated. An electromagnetic blood flow probe was surgically implanted around the left miduterine artery and catheters inserted in the left carotid artery and right jugular vein in ewes between d 120 and 130 of gestation. Four or more days postsurgery, ewes were fitted with instruments to measure rectal temperature (Tr), heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), blood pressure (BP) and UBF. One-half hour after instrument calibration, a 15-min thermoneutral control period was initiated with carotid artery blood samples taken at 5-min intervals for pH and PCO2 determinations. Ewes were then subjected to a heat challenge that reached 40 C at 2 h. All physiological data were recorded every 5 min as 1-min mean values. In seven experiments on five ewes, an alpha-adrenergic blocking drug, phenoxybenzamine (PB) was infused at 1 mg/min for 15 min subsequent to maximum depression of UBF. A beta-adrenergic blocking drug, propranolol (PR) was infused at .35 mg/min for 15 min in eight experiments on five ewes. Analysis of variance comparisons were made between the control period and heat stress infusion periods within the PB and PR experiments. Further comparisons were made between the start and 5, 10 or 15 min of PB or PR infusion in order to test drug effects during an acute heat stress. Rectal temperature HR, RR and arterial pH were higher (P less than .05) at the start of PR and PB infusions than during the thermoneutral control period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "57": "Ehrlich ascites tumor cells lose KCl and shrink after swelling in hypotonic media and in response to the addition of 2-deoxyglucose, propranolol, or the Ca2+ ionophore, A23187, plus Ca2+ in isotonic media. All of these treatments activate cell shrinkage via a pathway with the following characteristics: (1) the KCl loss responsible for cell shrinkage does not alter the membrane potential; (2) NO3(-) does not substitute for Cl-; (3) the net KCl movements are not inhibited by quinine or DIDS; and (4) early in this study furosemide was effective in inhibiting cell shrinkage but this sensitivity was subsequently lost. This evidence suggests that the KCl loss in these cells occurs via a cotransport mechanism. In addition, hypotonic media and the other agents used here stimulate a Cl(-) - Cl(-) exchange, a net loss of K+ and a net gain of Na+ which are not responsible for cell shrinkage. The Ehrlich cell also appears to have a Ca2+-activated, quinine-sensitive K+ conductive pathway but this pathway is not part of the mechanism by which these cells regulate their volume following swelling or shrink in isotonic media in response to 2-deoxyglucose or propranolol. Shrinkage by the loss of K+ through the Ca2+ stimulated pathway appears to be limited by Cl- conductive movements; for when NO3(-), an anion demonstrated here to have a higher conductive movement than Cl-, is substituted for Cl-, the cells will shrink when the Ca2+-stimulated K+ pathway is activated.", 
    "58": "During the 3-month blind treatment period there were 40 deaths in the metoprolol group compared with 62 deaths in the placebo group (p = 0.024). During the first year (after 3 months the 2 groups were treated similarly) there were 64 deaths in the metoprolol group vs 93 in the placebo group (p = 0.017) and during 2 years 92 patients died in the metoprolol group vs 120 in the placebo group (p = 0.043). The relative incidence of different causes of death did not differ significantly between the 2 treatment groups, indicating that metoprolol reduced all causes of death to the same extent as its effect on overall mortality.", 
    "59": "During a 3-month follow-up, 131 patients (19.1%) withdrew from blind treatment in both metoprolol- and placebo-treated groups. More metoprolol-treated than placebo-treated patients withdrew because of cardiovascular adverse experience mainly during the very early phase. In all, 45 (6.5%) metoprolol-treated vs 14 (2.0%) placebo-treated patients were not given either a full intravenous dose or a full oral dose 15 minutes later. Bradycardia and hypotension were more common in the metoprolol group, whereas severe atrioventricular block did occur in a similar number of patients in both groups and severe congestive heart failure was more common in the placebo group. Results indicate that tolerance is generally good after intravenous and oral treatment with metoprolol in patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "60": "Heart rate, systolic blood pressure and rate-pressure product were analyzed during the first 18 hours and 4 days after intravenous metoprolol or placebo. On injection of metoprolol there was an immediate decrease in mean heart rate from 72.9 +/- 0.6 to 62.7 +/- 0.4 beats/min, but no change was found in the placebo group. The difference in heart rate remained during the first 4 days. Systolic blood pressure was reduced from 144.1 +/- 0.9 to 134.6 +/- 0.9 mm Hg after intravenous metoprolol and was lower than that in the placebo group during 4 days of follow-up. Indirect signs of congestive heart failure tended to be less severe in patients given metoprolol within 12 hours of the onset of symptoms than in those given placebo. The duration of hospitalization also tended to be shorter in patients given early metoprolol treatment than in those given placebo early.", 
    "61": "The effect of metoprolol on chest pain was compared with that of placebo in all randomized patients. The pain score before and 15 minutes after the injection of trial medication was registered and a reduction in chest pain was observed in the metoprolol group. Increasing chest pain after blind injection was observed in only 16 and 9 patients from the placebo and metoprolol groups, respectively. Comparison with the placebo as well as detailed analysis of clinical data revealed that in these patients the increasing pain could not be explained by coronary spasm evoked by beta-blockade. Similarly, metoprolol did not exhibit any unfavorable effect on the 14 patients who were withdrawn (together with the 28 patients given placebo) from blind treatment due to angina pectoris. Either metoprolol does not induce coronary vasospasm or spasm does not play a role in these patients with definite and suspected acute myocardial infarction as well as unstable angina pectoris. Metoprolol reduced the need for analgesics during the first 4 days and shortened the duration of pain. The effects were similar in patients with early and late treatment, but may depend on initial heart rate, blood pressure and site of infarction.", 
    "62": "The G\u00f6teborg Metoprolol Trial was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, stratified trial aimed at evaluating the effect of the beta 1-selective blocker, metoprolol, in suspected acute myocardial infarction and during 2 years of follow-up. The primary end-point was 3-month mortality (blind treatment period). Secondary end-points were 2-year mortality, indirect signs of infarct size, chest pain, arrhythmias and tolerability. The entry criteria were fulfilled in 2,802 patients, 1,395 of whom were included in the trial. Treatment started as soon as possible after arrival in hospital with intravenous administration followed by oral treatment for 3 months. All patients were randomized 48 hours or less after estimated onset of infarction and 69% were randomized at 12 hours or less. The blind treatment had to be withdrawn in 19% of all randomized patients before the end of the 3-month follow-up.", 
    "63": "During the initial hospitalization, ventricular fibrillation (VF) developed in 6 metoprolol-treated patients (0.9%) vs 17 placebo-treated patients (2.4%) after inclusion in the study (p = 0.035). There were 6 episodes of VF in the metoprolol group compared with 41 episodes in the placebo group (p less than 0.001). During the same period, 14 metoprolol-treated patients had treated ventricular tachycardia vs 26 placebo-treated patients (p = 0.076). Similar favorable results were found when the incidence of severe ventricular arrhythmias during the first rehospitalization within the 3-month double-blind treatment period was analyzed.",

In 254 patients with inferior MI, the final R- and Q-wave amplitude was evaluated in leads II, III and aVF. Electrocardiographic signs of a smaller MI were observed in anterior MI in the metoprolol group compared with the placebo group when treatment was started 12 hours or less after the onset of pain, but no difference was found when treatment was started later. There was no sign of an effect of metoprolol in inferior MI. An immediate reduction in ST-segment elevation was observed after metoprolol treatment regardless of infarct localization or delay between the onset of pain and treatment.",

    "66": "During treatment of primary cultured hepatocytes with either glucagon or isoproterenol for several hours, the stimulations of cAMP formation by these hormones decreased time dependently. Glucagon treatment also reduced the response to isoproterenol, but isoproterenol treatment did not decrease the response to glucagon. Treatment with isoproterenol caused more rapid desensitization than treatment with glucagon. Assays of glucagon and beta-adrenergic receptors showed that the receptor number of only the hormone with which the cells were treated decreased and that dissociation constants of the receptors did not change. Moreover, in glucagon-desensitized cells, the effect of GTP on competition of the bindings of antagonist and agonist for the beta-adrenergic receptor did not change. After treatment with isoproterenol, stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity by the agonist was decreased without any decrease in the stimulations of activity by other effectors. In contrast, glucagon treatment greatly decreased the stimulations of activity by glucagon, isoproterenol, and guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate and slightly decreased that by fluoride. However, after glucagon treatment, the cells showed normal responses to cholera toxin of activation of adenylate cyclase and ADP-ribosylation of guanine nucleotide binding regulatory protein (Ns). The maximal response of glucagon-treated cells to forskolin was about two-thirds that of untreated cells and this treatment also impaired the shift toward a low Kact value for forskolin observed in the presence of either glucagon or isoproterenol. These results indicate that isoproterenol caused homologous desensitization consisting of only a \"down regulation\" of the beta-adrenergic receptor, whereas glucagon caused heterologous desensitization, mainly by alteration of the Ns component, as well as \"down regulation\" of glucagon receptor. This altered Ns seems to be coupled normally to the beta-adrenergic receptor, but to have impaired coupling to the catalytic component of adenylate cyclase.", 
    "67": "Survivors of the acute phase of a myocardial infarction still have an increased risk of dying, primarily due to causes directly attributable to their coronary heart disease. This review of randomized clinical trials of various interventions with the potential to prolong life in these patients is an attempt to answer a vitally important question. What, if anything, can be done to improve the long-term prognosis in patients who have survived the initial one or two weeks after suffering an acute myocardial infarction? Seven classes of intervention are considered: anticoagulants, platelet-active drugs, lipid-lowering regimens, antiarrhythmic agents, physical exercise, calcium antagonists and beta-blockers. So far only beta-blockers have been shown to have a favorable effect on long-term survival. Many of the trials reviewed had design limitations; in particular, the sample size was often too small for the results to be conclusive.", 
    "68": "Unstable angina can be defined by the development of chest pain at rest, usually with reversible S-T segment changes. It has been found in patients in whom angina developed at rest in the cardiac catheterization laboratory that a decrease in coronary sinus oxygen saturation preceded changes in left ventricular relaxation and contractility that preceded the development of chest pain and/or electrocardiographic changes. Increases in heart rate and/or blood pressure followed, rather than preceded, these ischemic episodes. These findings suggest that a decrease in oxygen supply, rather than an increase in oxygen demand, is the cause of episodes of angina at rest. Although principles of treatment of effort angina have emphasized the reduction of myocardial oxygen demand, treatment of rest angina should logically emphasize therapies that improve oxygen supply. A stepwise approach to the treatment of patients admitted to the Coronary Care Unit with unstable angina is proposed. The initial step consists of replacing oral and/or transcutaneous nitrates with an intravenous infusion of nitroglycerin while maintaining beta-blockers and calcium blockers at their previous doses. Nitroglycerin dilates coronary arteries and intercoronary collateral channels in addition to reducing preload and afterload. Intravenous administration allows faster titration to an effective dose and also more rapid reversal of hemodynamic effects, if the patient's status changes. The second step would consist of maintaining the nitroglycerin infusion and beta-blockers and adding or increasing the dose of calcium channel blockers. Slow channel calcium blockers dilate coronary arteries and prevent or reverse coronary spasm in addition to reducing afterload. The third step consists of adding or increasing the dose of beta-blockers in subgroups of patients with resting tachycardia and/or arterial hypertension. The fourth and final step would be to employ intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation therapy and/or to perform urgent coronary angiography. In patients with suitable coronary anatomy, angiography could be followed by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery.", 
    "69": "During a randomised placebo controlled trial of the effects of nadolol in hypertensive patients serum lipid profiles were obtained while the patients were fasting and during and after a meal and an exercise test. Treatment with nadolol was associated with a significant reduction in high density lipoprotein cholesterol at all time points. Serum triglyceride concentrations during treatment with nadolol were higher in the fasting state, though not significantly so, increased further postprandially, and were significantly higher during and after exercise. The changes in high density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations during beta adrenoceptor blockade may be secondary to a reduction in lipoprotein lipase activity.", 
    "70": "The biochemical and physiological aspects of isoprenaline sensitivity in normotensive rats were examined during and after abrupt withdrawal of chronic propranolol treatment. Serum propranolol concentrations in rats chronically treated for one month (0.125% propranolol in drinking water: 75-100 mg/kg/day) ranged from 7 to 23 ng/ml. At the height of the blockade, rats showed a decreased responsiveness in vivo to isoprenaline-induced increase in heart rate and fall in blood pressure; the ED50 values for isoprenaline being increased some 20- and 4-fold respectively. There was a 180% increase in beta-receptor number in sarcolemmal membranes isolated from ventricular muscle of these animals, together with increased basal (290%), fluoride- (100%), forskolin- (80%) and isoprenaline-stimulated (125%) adenylate cyclase activity. Twenty-four hours after propranolol withdrawal, serum propranolol concentrations were reduced by over 95%. At this time rats exhibited increased chronotropic and blood pressure responses to i.v. isoprenaline, indicated by the reduced ED50 values (2-fold and 12-fold respectively compared to controls). In addition, cardiac sarcolemmal beta-receptor number and adenylate cyclase activities were still significantly elevated above those of controls; 35% increase in beta-receptor number and increases of 96, 26, 13 and 37% in basal, fluoride-, forskolin- and isoprenaline-stimulated adenylate cyclase activities respectively. Forty-eight hours after drug withdrawal serum propranolol concentrations were only just detectable at 0.5 +/- 0.1 ng/ml. Although sarcolemmal beta-receptor numbers were still elevated (23%) isoprenaline-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity had returned to control values. However, both the fluoride- and forskolin-stimulated enzyme activities were decreased below control values by 12 and 23% respectively, suggestive of a reduction in the catalytic capacity of the adenylate cyclase complex. In parallel with the reduction in beta-receptor number and adenylate cyclase activity, the chronotropic response to i.v. isoprenaline had also returned to control values. In contrast, the blood pressure response to i.v. isoprenaline was still elevated in these animals indicated by the 5-fold reduction in the ED50 value compared with control animals.", 
    "71": "The characteristics of alpha-adrenoceptors in rat myocardium were investigated by specific binding of [3H]prazosin to cells isolated from adult rat heart by perfusion with collagenase and hyaluronidase. The cells were incubated in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer gassed with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 at 31 degrees with the appropriate concentrations of the different ligands. Non-specific binding was defined by the addition of 10(-5) mole/l. phentolamine. The binding of [3H]prazosin was saturable and reached equilibrium within 15 min. Scatchard analysis showed a straight line giving an apparent dissociation constant, Kd, equal to 155.9 +/- 8.0 pmole/l. and a maximal number of binding sites equal to 76.7 +/- 11.1 fmole/mg protein. Inhibition of specific [3H]prazosin binding by different adrenergic blockers showed the order of potency characteristic of alpha 1-adrenoceptors: prazosin much greater than phentolamine greater than yohimbine much greater than propranolol. Inhibition by adrenergic agonists showed the order of potency: adrenaline greater than noradrenaline = phenylephrine greater than isoprenaline. The same orders of potency were observed in the presence of propranolol. However, propranolol slightly decreased the affinity for noradrenaline and phenylephrine. Hofstee analyses of the inhibition curves showed two binding components for all ordinary alpha-adrenoceptor blockers and agonists including unlabelled prazosin. In contrast, [3H]prazosin showed only one binding component. Both binding components were of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor subtype according to the order of potency of blockers. The different ligands had different affinity ratios for the two binding components giving them different profiles. Trifluoperazine, a phenothiazine compound, also had high affinity for the [3H]prazosin binding sites. This drug, however, apparently detected one class of binding sites only, as interpreted from the Hofstee analysis. Hill analyses of the inhibition data consistently yielded Hill constants, nH, in the range 0.75-0.85 except for [3H]prazosin, where nH = 1.02 and for trifluoperazine, where nH = 1.07. Although the two binding components may serve different functions, it seems impossible at present to relate the negative and the positive inotropic components, respectively, of the alpha-adrenergic inotropic response observed in functional studies only to one or the other binding component.", 
    "72": "The characteristics of the beta-adrenergic receptors in homogenates of fresh tissue and cultured bovine corneal epithelium were compared using [3H]dihydroalprenolol. High affinity, specific binding sites were observed in both preparations. Fresh tissue exhibited a higher binding site density (165 fmol/mg protein) than did cells in culture (57 fmol/mg protein). Studies with various beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists indicated that binding characteristics were typical of beta-adrenergic receptors, predominantly of the beta 2 subtype. These results demonstrate that beta-adrenergic receptors exist in both fresh and cultured bovine corneal epithelium and that these receptors are qualitatively and quantitatively similar.", 
    "73": "The cardiovascular effects of ethylketocyclazocine were studied in rats anaesthetized with pentobarbital and artificially ventilated. Ethylketocyclazocine (1 mg X kg-1 i.v.) induced a fall in heart rate and blood pressure. The bradycardia and the hypotension were not altered by bilateral vagotomy and atropine, but were inhibited by naloxone and Mr 2266 BS. Ethylketocyclazocine always induced bradycardia in beta-adrenoreceptor-blocked and pithed animals. This bradycardia was prevented by Mr 2266 BS. These results would suggest that a direct peripheral action may occur at kappa-sites, located on the heart after intravenous injection of ethylketocyclazocine in the rat.", 
    "74": "The variations of plasma cyclic AMP concentration caused by propranolol and isoproterenol were studied in order to investigate endogenous stimulation and responsiveness of the beta-adrenoceptor-cyclic AMP system in vivo, in 7 and 18 week old unanaesthetized male SHR and WKY. In both age groups, the basal cyclic AMP level was higher in SHR than in controls but was significantly reduced to a comparable value in the two strains after intraperitoneal injection of 2.5 mg X kg-1 propranolol, a dose which markedly depressed or even abolished the effect of isoproterenol. Cumulative dose-response curves of plasma cyclic AMP concentration obtained in another group of rats after successive subcutaneous injections of isoproterenol showed that the ED50 value of this drug was higher in SHR than in WKY and increased in a parallel manner in the two strains between 7 and 18 weeks of age (respectively from 0.21 +/- 0.01 to 0.34 +/- 0.02 mumol X kg-1 in WKY and from 0.32 +/- 0.02 to 0.52 +/- 0.03 mumol X kg-1 in SHR). At the same time blood pressure increased much less markedly in WKY (from 115 +/- 4 to 119 +/- 2 mm Hg) than in SHR (from 134 +/- 3 to 179 +/- 3 mm Hg). Altogether these results show that endogenous beta-adrenergic stimulation of the cyclic AMP system was higher in SHR of both ages in spite of a diminished responsiveness of this system to exogenous isoproterenol."
