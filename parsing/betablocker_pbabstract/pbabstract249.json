Inflammatory processes have an important role in atherogenesis. In this paper, the effects of carvedilol on GM-CSF-induced IL-10 production were examined on human monocytic cell line, U937, and purified human monocytes. First, we showed that one-time carvedilol pretreatment at concentrations 0.3-10 microM dose-dependently inhibited GM-CSF-induced IL-10 production in U937 cells. In addition, we found carvedilol to be non-cytotoxic at concentrations equal to or less than 10 microM. However, at concentrations higher than 10 microM, carvedilol induced programmed cell death in U937 cells. The inhibition of GM-CSF-induced IL-10 production by carvedilol was also observed at the expression of mRNA. Furthermore, the inhibition of IL-10 production was demonstrated in GM-CSF-activated purified human peripheral blood monocytes. Finally, long-term carvedilol pretreatment of U937 cells up to 2 months at concentrations of 1.0 microM mildly enhanced the IL-10 production. Our observations that carvedilol modulated GM-CSF-induced IL-10 production may have some implication in understanding the broad-spectrum effects of carvedilol in regulating inflammatory reactions.", 
    "1": "During the past few years, several randomised trials have compared the effects of older blood-pressure lowering drugs (diuretics, beta-blockers) with those of newer ones (angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium entry blockers) on the long-term prognosis. In general, no significant differences were found between these regimes. Recently, the ALLHAT trial, which was the largest hypertension trial ever and in which over 40,000 patients with hypertension participated, was completed. The initial treatment consisted of either the diuretic chlorthalidone, the calcium entry blocker amlodipine, the ACE inhibitor lisinopril, or the alpha-blocker doxazosin. The latter arm was prematurely discontinued because of a higher incidence of the secondary endpoint heart failure and stroke. Based on an intention-to-treat analysis, the other types of treatment proved to be equivalent in terms of the primary endpoint, a composite of fatal coronary heart disease and non-fatal myocardial infarction. Although the investigators conclude that ALLHAT suggests that thiazide diuretics should be first choice in the treatment of hypertension, there are several caveats that tend to lessen the strength of this conclusion.", 
    "2": "The mechanism of receptor-induced activation of the ubiquitously expressed family of mammalian canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) channels has been the focus of intense study. Primarily responding to phospholipase C (PLC)-coupled receptors, the channels are reported to receive modulatory input from diacylglycerol, endoplasmic reticulum inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors and Ca2+ stores. Analysis of TRPC5 channels transfected within DT40 B cells and deletion mutants thereof revealed efficient activation in response to PLC-beta or PLC-gamma activation, which was independent of inositol 1,4,5-trisphoshate receptors or the content of stores. In both HEK293 cells and DT40 cells, TRPC5 and TRPC3 channel responses to PLC activation were highly analogous, but only TRPC3 and not TRPC5 channels responded to the addition of the permeant diacylglycerol (DAG) analogue, 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG). However, OAG application or elevated endogenous DAG, resulting from either DAG lipase or DAG kinase inhibition, completely prevented TRPC5 or TRPC4 activation. This inhibitory action of DAG on TRPC5 and TRPC4 channels was clearly mediated by protein kinase C (PKC), in distinction to the stimulatory action of DAG on TRPC3, which is established to be PKC-independent. PKC activation totally blocked TRPC3 channel activation in response to OAG, and the activation was restored by PKC-blockade. PKC inhibition resulted in decreased TRPC3 channel deactivation. Store-operated Ca2+ entry in response to PLC-coupled receptor activation was substantially reduced by OAG or DAG-lipase inhibition in a PKC-dependent manner. However, store-operated Ca2+ entry in response to the pump blocker, thapsigargin, was unaffected by PKC. The results reveal that each TRPC subtype is strongly inhibited by DAG-induced PKC activation, reflecting a likely universal feedback control on TRPCs, and that DAG-mediated PKC-independent activation of TRPC channels is highly subtype-specific. The profound yet distinct control by PKC and DAG of the activation of TRPC channel subtypes is likely the basis of a spectrum of regulatory phenotypes of expressed TRPC channels.", 
    "3": "1. We have studied the effects of three betaAR ligands (carvedilol, alprenolol, and ICI-118551) with different pharmacological profiles and negative efficacy at the beta2AR on cardiac in vivo, in vitro, biochemical and gene expression parameters in mice with permanent occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. 2. Cardiac in vivo parameters were determined using Doppler studies. Mitral-wave E peak velocity (EPV) and aortic peak velocity (AoPV) decreased in the first 2 weeks postocclusion. After 3 weeks of drug treatment, EPV was improved in the carvedilol group to preocclusion values; however, a further reduction in EPV in the alprenolol and control permanent occlusion group was measured and there was no change after ICI-118551 treatment. AoPV was unchanged between weeks 2 and 5 in all groups. 3. The left atria were isolated to record isometric tension responses to isoprenaline. Permanent occlusion significantly reduced the maximum isoprenaline response to 30% of control and carvedilol increased the maximum response to isoprenaline significantly to 60%. 4. The biochemical and gene expression studies revealed different effects of the three betaAR ligands. Most notably, carvedilol reduced gene expression of myosin heavy chain beta. 5. These results indicate that chronic treatment with carvedilol is beneficial in a mouse model of myocardial damage resulting from ischaemia. We hypothesise that these beneficial effects of the drug may be because of the negative efficacy at the beta2AR, combined with beta1AR antagonism.", 
    "4": "The recent Losartan Intervention For Endpoint Reduction in Hypertension (LIFE) study was conducted in patients with essential hypertension with electrocardiogram evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy. This showed that losartan compared to atenolol resulted in a significant reduction in the primary endpoint of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, as well as a greater reduction in electrocardiographically-defined left ventricular hypertrophy. Importantly, this was despite a mean blood pressure reduction which was similar in both groups. Furthermore, the atenolol arm was associated with higher incidence of newly diagnosed diabetics. The LIFE study has firmly confirmed a place for losartan (and other angiotensin receptor blockers) in the management of hypertension. Losartan has also been shown to be effective in diabetics and in patients with atrial fibrillation, as well as in left ventricular hypertrophy regression. This trial also raises the possibility that beta-blockers should perhaps not be used as first-line monotherapy.", 
    "5": "High factor VIII (FVIII) is a risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE). The pathomechanism by which high FVIII leads to an increased risk of VTE is unknown. Physical activity and infusion of adrenalin provoke a rise in FVIII, which can be blocked by a nonselective beta-blockade. We tested the hypothesis that in patients with a VTE beta-blockade decreases FVIII and inhibits coagulation activation. 17 male patients with high FVIII (> 170 IU/dL, n = 7) or low FVIII (<150 IU/dL, n = 10) and a history of VTE received 40 mg of propranolol thrice daily for 14 days. FVIII and vasopressin levels were measured before and during propranolol intake and 28 days thereafter. At the same time points, haemostatic system activation was investigated by measuring prothrombin fragment f1.2 (f1.2) and thrombin antithrombin complexes (TAT) in venous blood and in blood emerging from a skin incision (shed blood). The mean FVIII level before propranolol was 192 IU/dL and 115 IU/dL in patients with high and low FVIII, respectively. During and 28 days after propranolol, no significant change in FVIII was seen in both groups. Changes in f1.2 and TAT were not detectable in either venous blood or in shed blood. beta-receptor blockade did not lower FVIII or inhibit haemostatic system activation in patients with VTE and persistently high FVIII. Administration of propranolol cannot be recommended as secondary thromboprophylaxis in patients with high FVIII.", 
    "6": "To compare the effect of antihypertensive drugs on endothelium-dependent vasodilation in the peripheral conduit arteries of patients with essential hypertension, in a prospective, randomized, parallel group study, endothelial function was assessed in 168 hypertensive patients before and after 6-month treatment with randomly assigned nifedipine GITS (30 to 60 mg, n=28), amlodipine (5 to 10 mg, n=28), atenolol (50 to 100 mg, n=29), nebivolol (5 to 10 mg, n=28), telmisartan (80 to 160 mg, n=29), and perindopril (2 to 4 mg, n=28). If necessary, hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg) was added to each compound. We evaluated brachial artery flow-mediated, endothelium-dependent dilation (high-resolution ultrasound) compared with endothelium-independent response to glyceryl trinitrate (25 microg/s). Brachial artery diameter was measured by automatic computerized analysis. Forty healthy subjects were evaluated as a control group. Oxidative stress production was evaluated by measuring plasma malondialdehyde and plasma lipoperoxides; plasma antioxidant capacity was assessed as ferric-reducing antioxidant power. Hypertensive patients showed a significantly (P<0.01) lower flow-mediated dilation (5.2+/-1.9%) as compared with healthy control subjects (7.1+/-2.6%). Response to glyceryl trinitrate was similar in control subjects and patients. At baseline, blood pressure, diameter, flow-mediated dilation, and response to glyceryl trinitrate were similar in the different treatment groups. All treatments similarly reduced blood pressure, but only perindopril increased flow mediated dilation (from 5.1+/-2 to 6.4+/-2.4%; P<0.01) without modifying the response to glyceryl trinitrate. Perindopril but also telmisartan nifedipine and amlodipine reduced oxidative stress and increased plasma antioxidant capacity. In patients with essential hypertension, ACE inhibitors appear to be the only compounds able to improve conduit artery endothelium-dependent vasodilation.", 
    "7": "Pasteurella multocida produces a 146-kDa protein toxin (PMT), which activates multiple cellular signal-transduction pathways, resulting in the activation of PLCbeta, Rho, JNK, and ERK. In addition to an essential cysteine residue at position 1165, PMT contains several histidine residues in the catalytically important C-terminal part of the protein. To elucidate the role of the histidine residues, we treated PMT with the histidine-modifying substance diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC). DEPC inhibited PMT in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that one or several histidine residues are essential for the biological activity of PMT. In experiments in which PMT was directly delivered into the cytosol of EBL cells by electroporation, we show that DEPC treatment inhibits the catalytically important histidine residues. Leucine substitutions of eight individual histidine residues in the C-terminal catalytic domain of PMT were constructed, and the effect on the biological activity of PMT was analyzed by determining PLCbeta, Rho, and ERK activation. Substitution of two histidine residues, H1205 and H1223, led to inactivation of the resulting PMT proteins, indicating that H1205 and H1223 play an important role in biological activity of the toxin. In addition, we show that the mutant toxins appear to be correctly folded, as judged by protease digestion. The precise function of H1205 and H1223 is not yet known. However, treatment of PMT with the cation chelating substance 1,10-phenantroline led to inactivation of the toxin, indicating that the essential histidine residues and cysteine 1165 might be involved in metal ion binding.", 
    "8": "An experimental model of conduction velocity (CV) and refractory period dispersion was established to determine which variable is a determinant of myocardial vulnerability. Anesthetized swine were instrumented with a left anterior descending coronary artery catheter for regional infusion of lidocaine (n = 6), low-dose d-sotalol (n = 4), high-dose d-sotalol (n = 6), or saline (n = 6), to create dispersion in CV (lidocaine), refractoriness (d-sotalol), or neither (saline). Ventricular fibrillation thresholds (VFTs) and refractory periods were determined at five sites (one drug perfused, four non-drug perfused). CV was determined in one drug-perfused area (left ventricular epicardial apex) and one non-drug perfused area (right ventricular epicardial base). Lidocaine and low- and high-dose d-sotalol increased VFT when stimuli were delivered in the drug-perfused area. However, lidocaine decreased VFT when stimuli were delivered at non-drug perfused areas by an average of 52%. Neither d-sotalol dose affected VFT when stimuli were delivered in non-drug perfused areas. Lidocaine increased CV dispersion by 18-26 cm/s but did not alter refractoriness. Both d-sotalol doses increased dispersion in refractoriness by 15-27 ms but did not alter CV. Saline did not affect either variable. Regional lidocaine had profibrillatory effects when stimuli were delivered in non-drug perfused areas, whereas regional d-sotalol did not. Hence, CV dispersion is a more likely determinant of myocardial vulnerability than refractoriness.", 
    "9": "dl-Nebivolol has a beta(1)-adrenergic blocking property and l-nebivolol has an endothelial-dependent vasodilating property, sp that a racemic mixture, deltal-nebivolol, shows both properties. This study examined the effect of dl-nebivolol on ischemic myocardium in anesthetized open chest dogs. Ischemia was induced for 3 min by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery 10 min after IV injection of vehicle, dl-nebivolol (0.03, 0.1, and 0.3 mg/kg), or d- or l-nebivolol (0.15 mg/kg). Ischemia significantly decreased the levels of ATP, creatine phosphate, and fructose-1,6-diphosphate and increased those of ADP, AMP, hexose monophosphates, and ratio of [lactate]/[pyruvate]. dl-Nebivolol at higher doses significantly attenuated some metabolic changes caused by ischemia. Although neither enantiomers significantly affected these ischemia-induced metabolic changes, d-nebivolol appeared to attenuate adenine nucleotide reduction due to ischemia. Pretreatment with Nw-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester did not abolish the restoration of ischemia-induced myocardial metabolic changes by dl-nebivolol. In conclusion, dl-nebivolol lessens ischemic derangement of myocardial metabolism, and the effects may be due mainly to its beta-adrenergic blocking property but not to endothelium-dependent vasorelaxing property.", 
    "10": "Adenylyl cyclase (AC) messenger RNA (mRNA) expression is decreased in failing hearts. Diminished expressions are accompanied by desensitization of beta-adrenergic signal transduction. Factors contributing to such changes in mRNA expression for the major myocardial isoform AC V are not well established. To assess the contributions of hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS), and the sympathetic nervous system to these changes, ventricular expression of AC V mRNA was measured at different ages in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). In addition, the effects on them of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists were determined. Prior to quantitative Northern blotting at ages 5, 9, or 12 weeks, hemodynamic and morphologic variables were measured in SHRs and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKYs). The SHRs and WKYs were treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril (10 mg/kg/d), or a beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, atenolol (100 mg/kg/d), for 8 weeks preceding Northern analysis. Myocardial AC V mRNA expression increased from 5-12 weeks in both SHRs and WKYs. Expression of AC V mRNA in SHRs increased somewhat less than in WKYs at 9 weeks and significantly less at 12 weeks. This was accompanied by development of LVH and hypertension in SHRs. Blood pressure and left ventricular weight relative to body weight were markedly decreased by enalapril and were moderately decreased by atenolol. Expression of AC V mRNA in SHRs at 12 weeks was normalized equally by enalapril and atenolol to the level of WKYs. Thus AC V mRNA expression increases are blunted in the early stages of LVH in SHRs under the influences of beta(1)-adrenergic signal transduction and the RAS.", 
    "11": "The functional role of beta(3)-adrenergic receptors in the heart is still not clear. The actions of two widely used beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonists, such as BRL 37344 and CGP 12177, were studied in the isolated guinea pig heart, perfused at constant pressure according to the Langendorff technique. Heart contractility (dP/dt, first derivative of pressure measured over time) and coronary flow (CF) were assessed simultaneously. BRL 37344 and CGP 12177A at a concentration range of 10-8-10-5 M increased dP/dt and CF. The selective beta(3)-antagonist L-748337 (10-6 M) did not significantly influence either BRL 37344 or CGP 12177A-induced responses. However, both dP/dt and CF responses to BRL 37344 and CGP 12177A at a concentration of 10-7 M were abolished in the presence of the beta(1)/beta(2)-antagonist nadolol (10-5 M). In contrast, cardiovascular responses to CGP 12177A at a higher concentration of 10-5 M were hardly inhibited by nadolol (10-5 M). In addition, BRL 37344 and CGP 12177A at concentrations as low as 10-8 M almost completely abolished an isoprenaline-induced increase in contractility, suggesting that both BRL 37344 and CGP 12177A display beta(1)-antagonistic properties. These data suggest that the stimulatory cardiovascular responses to BRL 37344 at a full range of concentrations, and CGP 12177A at a low concentration of 10-7 M, are not mediated by beta(3)-adrenergic receptors, but rather by activation of beta(1)- or beta(2)-adrenergic receptors. Cardiovascular effects of CGP 12177A at a high concentration of 10-5 M are independent of beta(1)/beta(2)/beta(3)-adrenergic receptors. Summing up, it seems that in the isolated guinea pig heart the functional role of beta(3)-adrenoceptors is not significant. Nonetheless, BRL 37344 and CGP 12177A are not ideal tools for investigation of beta(3)-adrenergic receptor-dependent effects, because these compounds interact with other types of beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "12": "Experimental and clinical evidence documents the beneficial effects of blocking sympathetic activity and modulating heart rate to reduce risk for lethal events in ischemic heart disease. Beside beta-adrenergic receptor blockade, vagal activation is a meaningful approach but not yet easily attainable. Promising results were shown with low-dose atropine and scopolamine, but no follow-up was done because of significant adverse side effects. Pirenzepine is an atropine analogue approved to treat peptic ulcer disease in Europe that is devoid of central actions, which are mostly responsible for anti-muscarinic agents side effects. The vagomimetic action of IV low-dose pirenzepine was studied at rest under control conditions, at rest during acute coronary artery occlusion, and during exercise in conscious dogs with a healed anterior myocardial infarction (MI). The effects of pirenzepine were then compared, by internal control analysis, with those of atenolol (1 mg/kg). Increasing doses of pirenzepine (from 0.01 to 1 mg/kg) were tested in 11 dogs at rest by measuring time and frequency domain heart rate variability (HRV). The most effective dose (0.1 mg/kg) was used in the study. At the most effective dose, pirenzepine increased all measures of time domain HRV by 40-50%. However, the vagomimetic action of pirenzepine was lost during exercise and brief ischemia and no anti-arrhythmic action was observed. Conversely, pirenzepine effectively modulated the heart rate increase during acute ischemia at rest with an effect comparable to that of atenolol. The vagomimetic action of pirenzepine in the acutely ischemic heart supports the possibility that this intervention may be helpful for chronic autonomic modulation in post-MI patients.", 
    "13": "Anti-arrhythmic compounds with multiple actions reduce arrhythmic death risk in post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients. Sudden death prevention, however, may rely more on implantable defibrillators than anti-arrhythmic drugs due to ineffective pharmacologic intervention. Widespread use of implantable defibrillators should not obscure the need for development of new anti-arrhythmic drugs. This study tested the hypothesis that combined blockade of I(Na) and I(Ca(L)) prevents ischemia-dependent ventricular fibrillation (VF) in conscious dogs after MI. I(Na) and I(Ca(L)) blockade was accomplished with levosemotiadil in 11 dogs known to be at high risk for VF during 2 min of coronary occlusion during submaximal treadmill exercise 30 days after MI. Negative chronotropic effect of levosemotiadil was examined using the heart rate response to isoproterenol and comparing it with response to propranolol. Levosemotiadil prevented VF in 64% (7 of 11) of the high-risk animals. Heart rate responses to myocardial ischemia and to graded doses of isoproterenol were blunted by the high dose of levosemotiadil. Propranolol prevented VF in 73% (8 of 11) of the dogs. Levosemotiadil had approximately one half the beta-blocking activity of propranolol. The combination of I(Na) and I(Ca(L)) channel blockade coupled with partial beta-adrenergic blockade was equally effective in preventing VF as propranolol.", 
    "14": "Inhibitors of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase or statins have been shown to alleviate endothelial dysfunction. Their effects on constitutive nitric oxide synthase in the central nervous system may hypothetically affect the autonomic balance in sympathoexcitatory states, such as chronic heart failure (CHF). To address this issue, simvastatin (SIM) (0.3, 1.5, or 3 mg. kg-1. day-1 po) was given to rabbits with pacing-induced CHF over a 3-wk period. Normal and CHF vehicle-treated rabbits served as controls. Autonomic balance was assessed by measuring heart rate variability, including power spectral analysis (PSA). In addition, changes in resting heart rate were assessed before and after vagal and sympathetic autonomic blockade by atropine and metoprolol, respectively. The SD for all intervals was 8.9 +/- 0.7 ms in normal, 4.9 +/- 0.6 ms in CHF (P < 0.01), 3.8 +/- 0.6 ms in CHF with 0.3 mg. kg-1. day-1 SIM (P < 0.001), 5.7 +/- 0.9 in CHF with 1.5 mg. kg-1. day-1 SIM (P < 0.05), and 7.2 +/- 0.5 in CHF with 3.0 mg. kg-1. day-1 SIM. Similarly, total power was 40.5 +/- 6.3 ms2 in normal, 10.1 +/- 3.0 ms2 in CHF (P < 0.01), 6.0 +/- 1.6 ms2 in CHF with 0.3 mg. kg-1. day-1 SIM (P < 0.01), 13.2 +/- 3.9 ms2 in CHF with 1.5 mg. kg-1. day-1 SIM (P < 0.05), and 22.0 +/- 3.0 ms2 in CHF with 3.0 mg. kg-1. day-1 SIM. Both PSA data for low (0.625-0.1875 Hz) and high frequencies (0.1875-0.5625 Hz) showed recovery in CHF animals on medium and high SIM doses without changes in the low-to-high-frequency ratio. SIM beneficially affects autonomic tone in CHF as seen by the reversal of depressed HRV and total power of PSA. These data have important implications for the treatment of patients with autonomic imbalance.", 
    "15": "This study aims to investigate usage patterns of specific migraine prophylactic medications in ergotamine and triptan patients commencing this treatment for the first time during 1 January 1992 until 31 December 1998. Usage patterns of specific migraine prophylactic drugs were evaluated for each patient by accessing data from a large prescription database and were characterized as continued, switch or stop use during the patient observation period. Several patient and medication-related factors were explored in order to identify a possible relationship with the specific usage pattern defined. Approximately 75% of the study population (n = 729) had terminated (stop or switch) prophylactic treatment after 1 year. Age < 40 years (relative risk (RR) 1.9; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-3.2) and the concomitant use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (RR 3.2; 95% CI 1.2-5.5) or specific abortive migraine drugs resulted in a faster onset of treatment modification (switch). Overall, migraine prophylactic treatment is used for a relatively short period, probably attributable to the common limitations associated with migraine prophylaxis, such as poor compliance and/or limited therapeutic efficacy. Patterns of use can be influenced by a variety of factors, including age, type of prescriber and certain co-medication. Patient interview studies are required to clarify these issues further.", 
    "16": "A wide variety of pharmacologic agents are currently used for the prevention of recurrent neurocardiogenic syncope in children and adolescents. Significant advances in the understanding of this syncopal disorder have occurred in the past decade, and the list of medications recommended has changed, reflecting the evolving understanding of the pathophysiology and development of agents with enhanced efficacy and fewer adverse effects. Clinicians have few randomized controlled trials available to guide their decisions about treating neurocardiogenic syncope, and even fewer when it comes to medications targeting the pediatric population. At the present time, beta-adrenergic receptor blockers, fludrocortisone, and also specific serotonin reuptake inhibitors and midodrine, appear to be favored treatment options. Ideally, specific therapy would be tailored to specific pathophysiologic mechanisms. Unfortunately, at present, specific treatments based on those abnormalities have not been identified.", 
    "17": "Elevated production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the central nervous system has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease, ischemic reperfusion, stroke, and Alzheimer's disease. Pyruvic acid has a critical role in energy metabolism and a capability to nonenzymatically decarboxylate H2O2 into H2O. This study examined the effects of glycolytic regulation of pyruvic acid on H2O2 toxicity in murine neuroblastoma cells. Glycolytic energy substrates including D-(+)-glucose, D-(-) fructose and the adenosine transport blocker dipyridamole, were not effective in providing protection against H2O2 toxicity, negating energy as a factor. On the other hand, pyruvic acid completely prevented H2O2 toxicity, restoring the loss of ATP and cell viability. H2O2 toxicity was also attenuated by D-fructose 1,6 diphosphate (FBP), phospho (enol) pyruvate (PEP), niacinamide, beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (beta-NAD+), and reduced form (beta-NADH). Both FBP and PEP exerted positive kinetic effects on pyruvate kinase (PK) activity. Interestingly, only pyruvic acid and beta-NADH exhibited powerful stoichiometric H2O2 antioxidant properties. Further, beta-NADH may exert positive effects on PK activity. Subsequent pyruvic acid accumulation can lead to the recycling of beta-NAD+ through lactate dehydrogenase and beta-NADH through glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. It was concluded from these studies that intracellular pyruvic acid and beta-NADH appear to act in concert through glycolysis, to enhance H2O2 intracellular antioxidant capacity in neuroblastoma cells. Future research will be required to examine whether similar effects are observed in primary neuronal culture or intact tissue.", 
    "18": "Congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a group of ion channel disorders of ventricular myocytes due to genetic mutations. The main symptoms of LQTS are pre-syncopal or syncopal attacks and cardiac arrest. Anti-adrenergic therapy with beta-blockers has been the mainstay of treatment. Left cardiac sympathectomy has also been used as an alternative in those in whom beta-blockers failed. ICDs are highly effective in preventing mortality and should be the first choice of therapy for those with cardiac arrest as the first symptom or those with LQT3 genotype not responding to anti-adrenergic therapy alone. Research on new therapeutic options, specifically those targeting at defective genes or mutant ion channels, may provide more effective treatment for this rare but potentially fatal electrophysiological disorder.", 
    "19": "The aim of this study was to determine the effect of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), initiated within 24 hours of an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), on the QT dispersion (QTd). ACEIs have proven beneficial in improving left ventricular remodeling, following an AMI while contributing to a reduction in sudden cardiac death (SCD). A prolonged QTd is a marker of electrical instability predisposing to ventricular arrhythmias and SCD. No one has looked at the effects on the QTd of ACEI therapy initiated within 24 hours of an AMI. The study included 239 consecutive patients who presented with an AMI between January 1, 1998 and December 31, 1998. A total of 105 patients had never been treated with an ACEI, and 51 patients were started on enalapril within 24 hours of presentation. Patient demographics were similar in both groups. All patients were treated with aspirin and beta-blocker therapy. A baseline QTd was determined and recalculated on days 3-4 and 6-7 following the AMI. There was no significant difference in the baseline QTd, heart rate, QTc(min), and QTc(max) between the two groups. On days 3-4 the QTd in the treatment group (A) was 39.2 +/- 19.4 ms, as opposed to 84.4 +/- 31.2 ms in the control group (B) (P = 1.0E-06). This reduction in QTd was accounted for by a significant difference in the QTc(max). The QTd shortened in both groups on days 6-7 with a QTd of 30.0 +/- 17.5 in group A and a QTd of 54.1 +/- 26.3 in group B (P = 1.0E-05). There was a significant difference in ejection fraction (EF) between the two groups with the ACEI treated group exhibiting a lower EF, (0.403 (A), 0.494 (B), P < 0.043). The mean dose of enalapril was 6.45 mg daily in the treatment group. ACEIs have been previously shown to reduce the QTd after two months of therapy following an AMI. This study shows that the beneficial effects of ACEI occur early following administration of the drug. The authors speculate that the reduction in SCD conferred by ACEI therapy may be attributed to its effect on reducing the degree of ventricular dispersion of repolarization following a myocardial infarction.", 
    "20": "Controversy exists whether the development of left-ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a mechanism able to prevent cardiac dysfunction under conditions of pressure overload. In the present study we re-assessed the long-term effects of attenuating LVH by using L- and D-propranolol, which are equally able to inhibit the development of LVH induced by aortic banding. The aortic arch was banded proximal to the left common carotid artery in 71 CD-1 mice that were then assigned randomly to receive L-propranolol, D-propranolol (both 80 mg/kg per day) or vehicle. Concurrently, sham-operated mice were given L-propranolol, D-propranolol or vehicle. LV dimension and performance were evaluated under isoflurane anaesthesia by cine-magnetic resonance imaging, echocardiography and cardiac catheterization up to 8 weeks after surgery. After 2 weeks of pressure overload, the vehicle-treated banded mice had enhanced LV weight, normal chamber size and increased relative wall thickness (concentric hypertrophy), whereas L-propranolol- or D-propranolol-banded mice showed a markedly blunted hypertrophic response, i.e. normal chamber size and normal relative wall thickness, as well as preserved systolic LV chamber function. After 4 weeks, the vehicle-treated banded mice showed LV enlargement with a reduced relative wall thickness (eccentric remodelling) and a clear-cut deterioration in LV systolic function. In contrast, L-propranolol- or D-propranolol-treated banded mice showed normal chamber size with a normal relative wall thickness and preserved systolic function. A distinct histological feature was that in banded mice, L-or D-propranolol attenuated the development of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy but not the attendant myocardial fibrosis. At the 8-week stage, LV dysfunction was present in propranolol-treated banded mice although it was much less severe than in vehicle-treated banded mice. It is concluded that (i) deterioration of LV systolic performance is delayed if LV hypertrophy is inhibited, (ii) banding-induced deterioration of LV systolic function is associated with LV eccentric remodelling and (iii) the antihypertrophic effect of propranolol is due to a selective action on cardiomyocytes rather than on collagen accumulation", 
    "21": "The cardiovascular continuum describes the way from risk factors to atherosclerosis, acute cardiovascular events (unstable angina and myocardial infarction), and development of terminal heart failure and its complications. Following this way, advances are reported in the prevention of cardiovascular disease, in noninvasive diagnostics and revascularization of coronary artery disease, and in new therapeutic options of acute myocardial infarction. The following issues are reported in detail: (1) significance of statins, inhibition of platelet aggregation and vitamins in primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, (2) comparison of the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan and the beta-blocker atenolol in hypertension (LIFE study), (3) magnetic resonance angiography for the detection of coronary stenoses, (4) advantages and disadvantages of operative and interventional coronary revascularization considering elderly patients and sirolimus-eluting stents, and (5) efficacy of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibition and low molecular weight heparin in acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "22": "There is evidence that the myocytes produce dynorphin and dynorphin-like peptides, which are kappa opioid receptor (kappa-OR) agonists. Activation of kappa-OR, a dominant opioid receptor in the heart, alters the cardiac function in vivo and in vitro. The observations suggest that the endogenous kappa-opioid peptides may act as autocrines or paracrine in regulation of cardiac functions. Myocardial ischemia is a common cause of heart disorders, which is manifested in decreased myocardial performance, arrhythmia and infarct. When myocardial ischemia occurs, the sympathetic discharge increases, which in turn increases the work-load and oxygen consumption. This exacerbates the situation induced by ischemia. One of the mechanisms with which the body protects against ischemia-induced injury/arrhythmia is inhibition of stimulation of beta-adrenoceptor (beta-AR), the receptor mediating the actions of sympathetic stimulation. kappa-Opioids inhibit the beta-AR activation. The inhibition of the beta-AR activation is due to inhibition of Gs-protein and to a lesser extent the adenylyl cyclase of the signaling pathway mediating beta-AR stimulation by a pertussis sensitive G-protein that mediates kappa-OR activation. Another mechanism against ischemia-induced injury is preconditioning, which is defined as prior exposures to ischemia or other insults make the heart more tolerant to subsequent and more severe insults. Protection occurs immediately or 1-3 days after preconditioning. kappa-OR mediates protection of preconditioning with ischemia or metabolic inhibition, one of the consequences of ischemia, in the heart. Activation of kappa-OR by U50488H, a selective kappa-OR agonist (pharmacological preconditioning with U50488H, UP), activates protein kinase C (PKC), opens K(ATP) channels and increases the production of heat shock proteins. Blockade of PKC, or closing of the K(ATP) channels or inhibition of the synthesis of the heat shock protein abolishes the cardioprotection of UP. The findings indicate the important roles of PKC, the K(ATP) channels and the heat shock protein in cardioprotection of UP. In addition, UP also attenuates the Ca(2+) overload, a precipitating cause of cardiac injury, induced by ischemic insults, indicating that UP may confer cardioprotection via at least partly attenuating the Ca(2+) overload. Most interestingly, blockade of the K(ATP) channels with channel blockers, that abolishes the delayed cardioprotection of UP, also attenuates the inhibitory effect of UP on Ca(2+) overload, suggesting that the cardioprotective effect of opening of the K(ATP) channels may be due at least partly to the prevention/attenuation of Ca(2+) overload.", 
    "23": "The current prescription patterns for essential hypertension and the efficacy, safety, tolerability and cost-effectiveness of the newer antihypertensive drugs were evaluated in Nigerian patients. The findings were compared with that of a previous study conducted in the same tertiary hospital 10 years earlier. A cross-sectional evaluation of blood pressure (BP) control in a hypertension clinic was undertaken among 150 Nigerian patients aged 61 +/- 12 years (55% females), with a duration of treatment on a particular drug class or combination of 9 +/- 3 months. The initial blood pressure was 176 +/- 20/108 +/- 11 mmHg and 22% of the patient had concurrent diabetes mellitus. Thiazide diuretics (D) alone or in combination remained the most commonly prescribed drugs in 56% of all patients. There were significant increases in the prescriptions of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) (51%), P < 0.0001, and ACE-inhibitors (ACEIs) (24%), P < 0.0001, but a slight reduction in the use of methyldopa, and fixed drug combinations (P < 0.01) compared to the previous study. The fall in systolic blood pressure on D (r = 0.65, P < 0.001) or CCB (r = 0.48, P < 0.02) was significantly correlated with the initial systolic blood pressure, but not age. More patients achieved normotension BP < 140/90 mmHg on CCB monotherapy (71%), than D monotherapy (56%). Combination therapy with ACEIs + D or methyldopa+thiazides normalized BP in 63 and 68%, respectively. Pulse pressure, a surrogate marker for cardiovascular complications and mortality in essential hypertension, was significantly reduced (P < 0.01) equally by all treatments, with 95% confidence intervals ranging from -28 to -1 mmHg. However, hypertensive-diabetic (HT-DM) patients (n = 33) exhibited no significant change in pulse pressure in response to treatment. Adverse drug reactions that occurred in 11% were impotence or postural dizziness with D, headache and pitting oedema with CCB, and dry cough with ACEI. Pharmaco-economic comparison of the drug classes revealed that for every US dollar (dollar) spent per month, the percentage of treated patients attaining normotension was 18.6 for D, 4.73 for CCB, 3.5 for ACEI + D and 13.6 for methyldopa + thiazides. A combination of ACEI + CCB or D was the preferred treatment for hypertensive-diabetic Nigerians, but only 24% attained a BP < 130/85 mmHg. These results demonstrate a shift in trend to a more rational and efficacious treatment of hypertension over a 10 year period. This may be associated, at least in part, with the intensive and continuous education of the prescribers in rational drug use and the introduction of a hospital formulary. Methyldopa is still a highly efficacious and cost-effective drug in this population. Black HT-DM Africans still constitute a subgroup who not only require more and costlier antihypertensive drugs, but whose BP control is suboptimal, and exhibit a poor therapeutic response to other risk factors (pulse pressure) that constitute a continuing risk for cardiovascular mortality.", 
    "24": "The current study assessed the olfactory sensitivity of the goldfish (Carassius auratus L.) to the catecholamines, their immediate precursors and metabolites by use of the electro-olfactogram (EOG). The olfactory system of the goldfish was found to be sensitive to both adrenaline and dopamine with thresholds of detection of 10(-7.8) and 10(-7.9) M respectively, but less so to noradrenaline (threshold of detection 10(-6.3) M). The 3-O-methoxy metabolites (metadrenaline, normetadrenaline and 3-O-methoxytyramine) evoked larger amplitude EOGs than the non-metabolized form with lower thresholds of detection. However, the olfactory system was less sensitive to the amino acid precursors L-tyrosine and L-DOPA, and markedly less so to the alpha-deaminated metabolites (3,4-dihydroxyphenyl glycol, 3,4-dihydroxy mandelic acid and dihydroxyphenyacetic acid). Sensitivity to metabolites, both alpha-deaminated and 3-O-methoxylated, was similar to the alpha-deaminated forms. Cross-adaptation studies suggested that, while there is some degree of commonality of the receptor mechanisms with L-tyrosine and L-serine, a proportion of the response to the catecholamines is due to distinct receptor subtypes. Similarly, the 3-O-methoxy metabolites also had (a) separate receptor mechanism(s), although, again, there was overlap with the adrenaline/dopamine receptor site(s). Presence of the alpha-adrenoreceptor antagonist prazosin or the peripheral DA(2) dopamine receptor antagonist domperidone caused partial attenuation of the EOG responses to adrenaline and dopamine, but had much less effect on the responses to their 3-O-methoxy metabolites. The beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist sotalol had no such effect. This suggests that the olfactory catecholamine receptors are structurally and functionally distinct from systemic adreno- and dopamine receptors. The current study raises the possibility that release of catecholamines or their 3-O-methoxy metabolites to the water may play a role in chemical communication.",

After using timolol maleate 0.5% monotherapy twice a day for 2 weeks, patients (n = 146) with an early morning intraocular pressure (IOP) between 22 and 28 mm Hg, inclusively, received unoprostone isopropyl 0.15% (n = 50), brimonidine tartrate 0.2% (n = 48), or dorzolamide hydrochloride 2.0% (n = 48) twice daily as adjunctive therapy to timolol maleate 0.5% for another 12 weeks. Safety was based on comprehensive ophthalmic examinations, adverse events, and vital signs. Efficacy was based on mean change from baseline in the 8 hour diurnal IOP at week 12. Baseline was defined as values obtained after 2 weeks of timolol monotherapy.", 
    "27": "Each drug was safe and well tolerated. Burning/stinging was the most common treatment emergent adverse event. No clinically relevant changes from baseline were observed for any ophthalmic examination or vital signs. At week 12, each adjunctive therapy produced statistically significant (p<0.001) reductions from timolol treated baseline in the mean 8 hour diurnal IOP (-2.7 mm Hg, unoprostone; -2.8 mm Hg, brimonidine; -3.1 mm Hg, dorzolamide). The extent of IOP reduction did not differ significantly between unoprostone and either brimonidine (p = 0.154) or dorzolamide (p = 0.101).",

In men, angioplasty increased steadily, whereas thrombolysis showed an increase followed by a slight decrease after 1991. After multivariate analysis adjusting for age, year, blood pressure, smoking status and personal history of coronary heart disease, women received significantly less beta-blockers and angioplasty and more calcium channel blockers and diuretics than men, while no differences were found for thrombolysis.",

    "33": "Pregnancy can precipitate cardiac arrhythmias not previously present in seemingly well individuals. Risk of arrhythmias is relatively higher during labor and delivery. Potential factors that can promote arrhythmias in pregnancy and during labor and delivery include the direct cardiac electrophysiological effects of hormones, changes in autonomic tone, hemodynamic perturbations, hypokalemia of pregnancy, and underlying heart disease. Paroxysmal supraventricular and ventricular tachycardia may cause hemodynamic compromise with consequences to the fetus. Management of arrhythmias in pregnant women is similar to that in non-pregnant but a special consideration must be given to avoid adverse fetal effects. No drug therapy is usually needed for the management of supraventricular or ventricular premature beats, but potential stimulants, such as smoking, caffeine, and alcohol should be eliminated. In paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, vagal stimulation maneuvers should be tried first. Adenosine or a cardioselective beta-blocker could be used if vagal maneuvers are ineffective. Alternatively, verapamil or diltiazem may be given. In pregnant women with atrial fibrillation, the goal of treatment is conversion to sinus rhythm or to control ventricular rate by a cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocker drug or digoxin. Ventricular arrhythmias may occur in the pregnant women with cardiomyopathy, congenital heart disease, valvular heart disease, or mitral valve prolapse. Termination of ventricular arrhythmias can usually be achieved by intravenous lidocaine or procainamide or by electrical cardioversion. Amiodarone is not safe for the fetus. Beta-blocker therapy must be continued during pregnancy and postpartum period in women with long QT syndrome and torsade de pointes.", 
    "34": "Experimental extinction is the decline in the frequency or intensity of a conditioned behaviour resulting from repetitive performance of the behaviour in the absence of the unconditioned stimulus or reinforcer (Pavlov, 1927). Ample behavioural evidence indicates that experimental extinction does not reflect unlearning of the original trace, but rather a relearning process, in which the new association of the conditioned stimulus with the absence of the original reinforcer comes to control behaviour (Rescorla, 1996). If experimental extinction is indeed learning rather than forgetting, are the neuronal circuits that subserve learning and extinction identical? We address this question by double dissociation analysis of the role of the central (CeA) and the basolateral (BLA) nuclei of the rat's amygdala in the acquisition and extinction, respectively, of conditioned taste aversion (CTA). Whereas local blockade of protein synthesis or beta-adrenergic receptors in the CeA blocks acquisition but not extinction of CTA, a similar intervention in the BLA blocks extinction but not acquisition. Hence, the amygdalar circuit that acquires taste aversion memory differs functionally from the circuit that extinguishes it.", 
    "35": "The mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) is an event related to severe oxidative stress (for example, during myocardial ischemia and reperfusion) and excessive mitochondrial calcium accumulation, also being implicated in cell death. In this study, we compared the effect of carvedilol on the cardiac MPT induced by calcium and phosphate (Ca/Pi) and calcium/carboxyatractyloside (Ca/Catr). Oxidative stress plays a major role in MPT induction by Ca/Pi, leading to the oxidation of protein thiol groups, in contrast with Ca/Catr, where such oxidation is secondary to MPT induction and is not caused by oxidative stress.", 
    "36": "Mitochondria were isolated from rat hearts and parameters related to MPT induction were evaluated (n = 5 for each inducer): mitochondrial swelling and oxidation of protein thiol groups (both measured by spectrophotometry).", 
    "37": "Using Ca/Pi, carvedilol protected mitochondria from MPT induction, particularly in its high conductance form. Its effect was demonstrated by analyzing the decrease in mitochondrial swelling amplitude. Simultaneously, we observed inhibition of protein thiol group oxidation (p < 0.001). By contrast, carvedilol did not show any protective effect with Ca/Catr.", 
    "38": "Carvedilol was only effective against the MPT when the oxidation of protein thiol groups was the cause and not the consequence of the MPT phenomenon. The results clearly show that during myocardial aggressions (ischemia and reperfusion, for example), the protective effect of carvedilol is primarily due to an antioxidant mechanism, inhibiting the production and effects of reactive oxygen species.", 
    "39": "Atrial fibrillation is a frequent cardiac arrhythmia in the elderly, which can be treated either by rate control, or by rhythm control through chemical or electrical cardioversion. Rate control is easily achieved, but leaves the arrhythmia with its inherent risk of heart failure and stroke intact. Although rhythm control is logistically more complex to obtain, it does restore normal sinus rhythm. However, dangerous antiarrhythmics are then needed to maintain this. Recently, two randomised trials showed that rate control is not inferior to rhythm control. Restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm was accompanied by a higher incidence of death, ventricular arrhythmias, heart failure, stroke and the need for permanent pacemaker implantation. Recurrent atrial fibrillation can be treated optimally by rate control through digitalis, beta-blockers or calcium antagonists, accompanied by oral anticoagulation. Once the sinus rhythm has been restored, oral anticoagulation should be continued.", 
    "40": "Inflammatory conditions reduce clearance, hence increase plasma concentration of drugs such as propranolol that are efficiently cleared by the liver. The therapeutic consequences of this increased plasma drug concentration is mainly unknown. However, for sotalol, another beta-adrenergic antagonist, inflammation causes reduced potency. Sotalol, however, is renally cleared; hence, its clearance is unaffected by inflammation. We examined if the inflammation-induced increased plasma propranolol concentration compensates for the reduced responsiveness. A modified lead I ECG was used to record PR interval and heart rate (HR). ECG was monitored following oral administration of 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 mg/kg propranolol to both control and adjuvant arthritis (AA) rats. To confirm altered pharmacokinetics, single 25 mg/kg doses of propranolol were administered to both AA and control rats, with an inserted cannula in their right jugular vein for serial blood sampling. As expected, AA caused a significant reduction in the propranolol oral clearance and subsequently substantial increases in plasma total and unbound drug concentration. Interestingly, however, despite the elevated propranolol concentrations, the effect on HR remained unchanged and the prolongation of PR interval was significantly reduced in AA compared with control rats. The reduced sensitivity to propranolol in AA rats is suggestive of altered beta-adrenergic receptors function.", 
    "41": "The in vitro passive and iontophoretic (applied current density: 0.5 mA/cm(2)) timolol (TM) permeability from a liquid solution through pig stratum corneum (SC) is found to be 0.9 +/- 0.5 x 10(-6) and 3.9 +/- 0.9 x 10(-6) cm/s, respectively. The in vitro iontophoretic TM delivery through the combination of artificial porous membranes with pig SC is investigated as well. When the meso-porous PES-30 membrane is applied, the SC mainly controls the TM delivery. When the microporous NF-PES-10 membrane is applied, both the membrane and the SC contribute to controlling the delivery of TM. When the microporous LFC 1 membrane is applied, the TM delivery is membrane controlled. In all cases, however, the efficiency of the TM delivery is low and would need to be improved for the development of a commercially viable product.",

The mean follow-up was 73 +/- 19 months. Mortality rate was 13%, and 20 patients (12%) had major cardiac event, 8 patients (5%) had stroke and 10 patients (6%) underwent revascularization. Multivariate analysis matched for age and ejection factor showed that moderate disease (stenosis 40-59%) (OR = 2.713, p < 0.024) was an independent predictive factor of major cardiac event.", 
    "43": "Of 54 patients with long-standing atrial fibrillation (mean duration 8.3 months), 27 patients were randomised to transvenous low-energy intracardiac biphasic direct-current (DC) cardioversion (ICV) using a single-lead balloon-tipped catheter, and 27 patents were randomised to conventional high-energy transthoracic monophasic DC cardioversion (TCV). ICV was performed with increasing energy levels (7.5-10-12.5-15 J) during mild sedation. TCV was performed with 200-360-360 J during general anaesthesia. Cardioversion to sinus rhythm occurred in 93% (25/27) following ICV and in 67% (18/27) following TCV (p = 0.04). Due to the higher cardioversion rate following ICV, more patients were in sinus rhythm during 180 days of follow-up (log rank test, p = 0.04). Low-energy intracardiac cardioversion represents a highly efficacious alternative to high-energy transthoracic cardioversion.", 
    "44": "1. Left atrial strips from transgenic (TG4) mice with cardiac-specific overexpression ( approximately 200-fold) of the beta(2) adrenoceptor (beta(2)AR) were isolated, and their isometric force of contraction (F(c)) in response to electrical stimulation was measured. 2. The betaAR agonist isoprenaline elicited negative inotropic responses in all left atrial strips; in 6/11 preparations, it also had a small positive inotropic effect. This 'up-phase' was observed from 0.1 to 10 nM, with the 'down-phase' occurring at higher concentrations. Both phases were mediated by beta(2)AR, as shown by their sensitivity to the beta(2)AR antagonist ICI-118,551 (100 nM; pA(2) 8.60+/-0.07, 8.45+/-0.19, for 'up-phase' and 'down-phase,' respectively), but not the beta(1)AR antagonist CGP-20712A (100 nM). Conversely, nontransgenic littermate preparations responded to isoprenaline treatment solely by an increase in F(c), which was beta(1)AR-mediated. 3. Pretreatment of left atrial strips with either 10 nM isoprenaline or 1 mM 8-bromo-cAMP significantly attenuated the TG4 'up-phase', while having no effect on either the TG4 'down-phase' or the littermate controls' responses. B. pertussis toxin treatment of the animals prevented isoprenaline's negative inotropic effects in TG4 preparations, but had no effect in littermate controls. 4. The findings imply that the responses of TG4 left atrium to isoprenaline are because of beta(2)AR coupling to G(s) and G(i) proteins, consistent with the model of Daaka et al., in which protein kinase A phosphorylation of the beta(2)AR causes a switch from G(s) to G(i) protein coupling.", 
    "45": "1. Extracellular nucleotides are the focus of increasing attention for their role as extracellular mediators since they are released into the extracellular environment in a regulated manner and/or as a consequence of cell damage. 2. Here, we show that human eosinophils stimulated with different nucleotides release eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) and the chemokine interleukin 8 (IL-8), and that release of these two proteins has a different nucleotide requirement. 3. Release of ECP was triggered in a dose-dependent manner by ATP, UTP and UDP, but not by 2'-&3'-o-(4-benzoyl-benzoyl)adenosine 5'-triphosphate (BzATP), ADP and alpha,beta-methylene adenosine 5' triphosphate (alpha,beta-meATP). Release of IL-8 was triggered by UDP, ATP, alpha,beta-meATP and BzATP, but not by UTP or ADP. Pretreatment with pertussis toxin abrogated nucleotide-stimulated ECP but not IL-8 release. 4. Release of IL-8 stimulated by BzATP was fully blocked by the P2X(7) blocker KN-62, while release triggered by ATP was only partially inhibited. IL-8 secretion due to UDP was fully insensitive to KN-62 inhibition. 5. Priming of eosinophils with GM-CSF increased IL-8 secretion irrespectively of the nucleotide used as a stimulant. 6. It is concluded that extracellular nucleotides trigger secretion of ECP by stimulating a receptor of the P2Y subfamily (possibly P2Y(2)), while, on the contrary, nucleotide-stimulated secretion of IL-8 can be due to activation of both P2Y (P2Y(6)) and P2X (P2X(1) and P2X(7)) receptors.", 
    "46": "The elderly population is expanding rapidly throughout the world. Hypertension, heart disease and other cardiovascular disorders are prevalent conditions among this age group. Consequently, clinicians will spend a large proportion of their practices managing older adults with cardiovascular disorders. A large proportion of this time will be devoted to using pharmacotherapeutic strategies for the long-term management of chronic conditions. The physiological changes that accompany aging affect cardiovascular function, and the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of many cardiovascular medications are altered by these physiological changes. The interactions of these changes can have a profound effect on the agents used to treat cardiovascular disorders and may alter their therapeutic outcomes. Several classes of medications are used to treat chronic cardiovascular disorders in older adults. These include the ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists, calcium channel antagonists, beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers), oral antiarrhythmic agents and warfarin. Drugs such as beta-blockers may aggravate decreased cardiac output and increase peripheral resistance, but are valuable adjuncts in many patients with congestive heart failure. Agents that reduce angiotensin II activity may have several benefits for treating heart failure and hypertension. Successful treatment of cardiovascular disorders in older adults requires the choice of the most appropriate agent, taking into consideration the complex interactions of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and disease effects.", 
    "47": "In the last few years, significant experimental evidence has accumulated showing that many G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are structurally and perhaps functionally homodimers. Recently, a number of studies have demonstrated that many GPCRs, notably GABA(B), somatostatin, and delta and kappa opioid receptors form heterodimers, as well. Based on these observations, we undertook a pharmacological and functional analysis of HEK 293 cells transiently transfected with the beta1AR or beta2AR or with both subtypes together. High-affinity binding for subtype-specific ligands (betaxolol and xamoterol for the beta1AR, and ICI 118,551 and procaterol for the beta2AR) was detected in cells expressing the cognate receptors alone with values similar to those reported in the literature. However, a significant portion of these high-affinity interactions were lost when both receptors were expressed together while nonspecific ligands (propranolol and isoproterenol) retained their normal affinities. When competition assays were performed with each subtype-specific ligand in the presence of a constant concentration of the other subtype-specific ligand, the high-affinity binding site was rescued, suggesting that the two receptor subtypes were interacting in a fashion consistent with positive cooperativity. Our data suggest that the beta1AR and beta2AR can form heterodimers and that these receptors have altered pharmacological properties from the receptor homodimers.", 
    "48": "Blood vessels are remodeled in hypertension both structurally and functionally. The changes that occur in their structure, mechanical properties, and function contribute to blood pressure elevation and to complications of hypertension. We studied the remodeling of small arteries in experimental animals and humans. Smooth muscle cells of small arteries are restructured around a smaller lumen, with significant remodeling of the extracellular matrix and collagen and fibronectin deposition. Interestingly, there is no evidence of net growth of the vascular wall (which results in so-called eutrophic remodeling), particularly in the milder forms of human essential hypertension. Hypertrophic remodeling and increased small artery stiffness may be found in more severe forms of hypertension. Almost all hypertensive patients have vascular structural remodeling. However, only some exhibit endothelial dysfunction. This is particularly true in mild hypertension, in which endothelial dysfunction is less common. A 1-year treatment of hypertensive patients with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonists, and long acting calcium channel blockers corrected small artery structure and, to variable degrees depending on the agents used, impaired endothelial function. In contrast, beta blockers did not improve structure, function, or mechanics of vessels. When beta-blocker-treated patients were switched to an AT1 receptor antagonist, small artery structure and impaired endothelial function were corrected. The vascular protective action of some antihypertensive agents may contribute to improve outcome for hypertensive patients, although this is presently unproven.", 
    "49": "From March to July 1999, 940 private cardiologists in France recruited 100,429 patients of whom 30,430 (30%) had a previous history of atherothrombotic disease. The prevalence of patients with a previous history of Myocardial Infarction (MI), Ischemic Stroke (IS) or Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) was 19.7%, 7.2% and 10.7% respectively. Among patients with a history of atherothrombotic disease, myocardial infarction was the most frequent diagnosis responsible for 65% of all consultations. Each cardiologist described the secondary prevention treatment for 3 consecutive patients among whom 1 corresponded to each of the 3 atherothrombotic territories. The most frequent cardiovascular risk factors were hypercholesterolemia for myocardial infarction (77.9%), smoking for PAD (32.5%) and hypertension for IS (73.2%). Diabetes mellitus (1/4 patients), obesity (1/3) and sedentary way of life (1/3) were equally prevalent for each of the atherothrombotic territories. More than 90% of the patients received an antithrombotic drug. Antiplatelet agents were largely prescribed, anticoagulants being more frequently used for patients with atrial fibrillation, symptomatic cardiac heart failure or stroke of embolic origin. Thienopyridines represent 17.9% of the prescriptions. The prescription rate of statins after MI (58.9%) is lower than in published studies in secondary prevention. The lack of lipid measurement and the delay since last measurement are non-prescription factors. The rates of prescription are even lower in case of PAD (44.6%) or IS history (33.3%). More than half of the patients (56.6%) are treated with beta-blockers and 40.1% with ACE inhibitors. These rates are similar to what has been published. Atherothrombotic disease represents a large part of the daily activity of private cardiologists and is not limited to coronary heart disease. Despite their proven efficacy, drugs for secondary prevention for MI, except antithrombotic drugs, are insufficiently prescribed. This under-prescription is even higher in patients with PAD or IS history and may be related to the lack of clinical trials in these specific territories.",

The Usik 1995 and Usic 2000 surveys included patients admitted for acute myocardial infarction, while the 2 Prevenir surveys (1998 and 1999) assessed the medications prescribed in patients with acute coronary syndromes. Antiplatelet agents were prescribed in 91% of the patients in 1995, 93% in 1998 and 1999 and 96% in 2000; for beta-blockers, the respective figures were: 64%, 68%, 75% and 76%. For ACE-Inhibitors, the figures were: 46%, 41%, 41% and 50%. For statins, the prescription increased from 10% to 36%, 59% and 64%. In 1995, 8% of the patients received both antiplatelet agents, beta-blockers and statins (4% of them also had an ACE-Inhibitor); in 2000, the respective figures were 53% and 27%. The results of the recent trials of secondary prevention medications have had a considerable impact on real-life practice in France during the late 1990s.", 
    "51": "The role of brain epinephrine (EPI) in the regulation of motor activity and movement in mice was examined. Blockade of EPI synthesis with i.p. 2,3-dichloro-alpha-methylbenzylamine (DCMB) or LY134046 was found to produce marked behavioral inactivity which could be significantly reversed by intraventricular injection of EPI and by three other alpha(1)-adrenoceptor agonists, norepinephrine (NE), 6-fluoronorepinephrine (6FNE), and phenylephrine (PE), as well as by serotonin (5HT). EPI had the largest effect of these agonists and also was the only one that reversed nondrug-induced inactivity of mice in their home cages during the light phase. The effects of EPI were blocked by coinfusion of an alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist (terazosin) but not of an alpha(2)-(atipamezole) or beta(1) (betaxolol)-blocker. The rank order of maximal behavioral responses to EPI, 6FNE, and PE in DCMB-treated mice was the same as the rank order of their maximal stimulation of hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol at cloned alpha(1B)-adrenoceptors in cell culture. On the basis of the above findings and of the central distributions of adrenergic neurons and alpha(1)-adrenoceptors, the existence of a central EPI-innervated alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor system is postulated which serves to coexcite or enhance signaling in several monoaminergic brain regions involved in movement and motor activity.",

Demographic characteristics and atenolol concentrations were similar in the two genotypic groups. Genotype had a marked effect on resting hemodynamic responses to atenolol, with Arg389-homozygous subjects having a larger decrease in resting systolic blood pressure (8.7 +/- 1.3 mm Hg versus 0.2 +/- 1.7 mm Hg, P < .001) and mean arterial blood pressure (7.2 +/- 1.0 mm Hg versus 2.0 +/- 1.7 mm Hg, P = .009).

The MERIT-HF (Metoprolol CR/XL Randomized Intervention Trial in Congestive Heart Failure) study, the largest of these trials and the largest randomized mortality trial with beta-blockers in heart failure to date, demonstrated that ER metoprolol succinate reduced the relative risk of all-cause mortality by 34% versus placebo. Furthermore, the relative risk of the combined endpoint of mortality plus all-cause hospitalizations was reduced by 19% and sudden death was reduced by 41%. The benefits of therapy were evident in various patient subgroups, including elderly patients and those with diabetes mellitus.

    "72": "The increased peripheral resistance in hypertension results from arteriolar vasoconstriction, increased media-to-lumen (M/L) ratio of small resistance arteries, and rarefaction (reduction in density) of microvessels. Numerous neurohumoral and hormonal factors are involved in causing structural and functional changes in the microcirculation in hypertension, including the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, remodelling of the extracellular matrix, increased growth of the smooth muscle cells of the media, and elevated collagen and fibronectin deposition. Although a wide variety of pharmacological agents can decrease blood pressure (BP) in hypertension, they vary in their ability to reverse structural and functional changes in the microcirculation. ACE inhibitors have consistently been shown to regress microvascular changes but findings with calcium antagonists have been variable and beta-adrenoceptor blockers appear to have no effect. In studies with ACE inhibitors, improvements in the M/L ratio and endothelial function of small resistance arteries have been recorded in both animal models of hypertension and human subcutaneous arteries obtained by biopsy of gluteal tissue from patients with essential hypertension. Recent studies with the very low-dose combination of perindopril and indapamide have indicated that these agents act synergistically to restore normal microvascularisation and reverse capillary rarefaction in the coronary circulation of hypertensive rats, and normalise coronary blood flow reserve in humans with hypertension. The additional benefit accruing from regression of structural and functional abnormalities in critical vascular beds such as coronary or renal circulations of patients with chronic hypertension may well become an important factor in selection of antihypertensive therapy, as complications such as ischaemic episodes and other target organ damage may be prevented and the BP-lowering effect of treatment may be extended such that it continues even after withdrawal. However, whether improvements in microcirculatory structure and function will be associated with improved morbidity and mortality outcomes in patients with chronic hypertension has yet to be firmly established.", 
    "73": "Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and systolic-diastolic pulse pressure (PP) may be superior predictors of cardiovascular risk than diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Treatments that selectively reduce SBP and PP may therefore be of particular interest. The REASON project was a randomised, double-blind study comparing the very low-dose combination perindopril 2mg/indapamide 0.625 mg (Per/Ind) versus atenolol 50mg for 12 months in 471 hypertensive patients. Both treatments produced similar reductions in brachial DBP, but Per/Ind produced greater reductions than atenolol in SBP (-23.1 +/- 15.6mm Hg vs -16.2 +/- 16.0mm Hg; p < 0.001) and PP (-9.9 +/- 12.4mm Hg vs -3.3 +/- 13.5mm Hg; p < 0.001). Patients with echocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy at baseline (n = 124) showed greater reduction of left ventricular mass index with Per/Ind (-11.3 +/- 15.4 g/m(2)) than atenolol (-5.3 +/- 15.1 g/m(2); p = 0.031). Relative to atenolol, Per/Ind selectively targets SBP and PP, which could be important in reducing cardiovascular risk.", 
    "74": "The reversing effects of carvedilol and other beta-adrenoceptor antagonists on multidrug resistance (MDR) were assessed in HeLa cells and the MDR1-overexpressing derivative Hvr100-6 cells, established by stepwise increases of vinblastine concentration in the culture medium. The inhibitory effects on the transcellular transport and intracellular accumulation of [3H]vinblastine and [3H]daunorubicin were also assessed using LLC-GA5-COL150 cell monolayers, established by transfection of human MDR1 cDNA into porcine kidney epithelial LLC-PK1 cells. The cytotoxic effects of vinblastine, paclitaxel, doxorubicin and daunorubicin in Hvr100-6 were reversed 1.4- to 7.1-fold by carvedilol at the realistic clinical concentration of 1 microM, whereas other beta-adrenoceptor antagonists had weaker or no such effects. Transport experiments using LLC-GA5-COL150 cell monolayers demonstrated that this effect of carvedilol was due to the inhibition of MDR1-mediated transport of vinblastine, paclitaxel, doxorubicin and daunorubicin. These MDR1-mediated reversing effects of carvedilol were similar to those of 1 microM verapamil, suggesting that carvedilol could be a candidate modulator of MDR in clinical use. Since other beta-adrenoceptor antagonists had no inhibitory effect on transport, the effects of carvedilol were not related to beta-adrenoceptors and might have been due to antioxidant activity.", 
    "75": "In the heart, striking functional differences exist after stimulation of the beta1- and beta2-adrenergic receptor (AR) subtypes. These may be linked to differences in metabolic response during beta1- and beta2-AR stimulation.", 
    "76": "The relation between work and metabolism was examined during selective beta1- and beta2-AR stimulation (beta1 and beta2 groups, respectively) in the isolated perfused rat heart. Measurements were made of rate-pressure product (RPP=LV developed pressure x heart rate), phosphorus-containing metabolites, and pH by 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and of O2 consumption by fiber-optic oximetry. Experiments were performed under high constant flow (HCF) and under flow-limiting conditions (constant pressure, CP). Despite substantially greater RPP increases relative to baseline during beta1-AR (HCF, 475%; CP, 150%) than beta2-AR (HCF, 90%; CP, 72%) stimulation, the relative decrease in the intracellular energy charge relative to baseline was similar for the beta1 (HCF, 49%; CP, 64%) and beta2 (HCF, 59%; CP, 55%) groups. For each group, an increase in oxygen consumption (MVO2) occurred commensurate with workload during HCF (beta1, 141%; beta2, 30%). During CP, however, the MVO2 increase was similar (beta1, 39%; beta2, 34%), despite the large RPP difference between the groups. During both protocols, there was greater acidosis during beta1-AR than during beta2-AR stimulation. Thus, at a given workload, intracellular energy charge decreased, and MVO2 (CP) increased to a greater extent during beta2 than beta1-AR stimulation.",

In particular, the direct action of this agent on human myocardial contractility is not known. Therefore, we investigated the effects of bupropion on human cardiac tissue in vitro. Our results suggest that bupropion exerts indirect sympathomimetic activity producing positive inotropic effects in human myocardium most probably by catecholamine release.", 
    "81": "We examined the role of norepinephrine in the morphine-induced potentiation in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in chronically implanted freely moving rats. The population spikes of the field potentials in the dentate gyrus following perforant path stimulation were recorded before and after morphine injection. We found that a single dose of morphine sulfate (5 mg/kg, i.v.) resulted in a long-lasting augmentation in the amplitudes of population spikes. When pretreated with propranolol (5 mg/kg, i.v.), a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, the morphine-induced potentiation was significantly attenuated. These results suggested that an increase in norepinephrine release in the hippocampus contributed to the morphine-induced potentiation.", 
    "82": "We investigated the contribution of alpha- and beta-adrenergic pathways to catecholamine-induced pulmonary edema and the role of pleural effusion in preventing alveolar edema. Female Sprague-Dawley rats received continuous intravenous infusion of norepinephrine and of separate alpha- or beta-adrenergic stimulation over 6-24 h. We performed heart catheterization in vivo and excised post mortem lung tissue for histological analysis. Interleukin (IL)-6 and total protein concentrations were determined in serum, pleural fluid (PF) and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. alpha-Adrenergic treatment increased right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) and total peripheral resistance (TPR) and caused severe alveolar edema associated with IL-6 activation in serum and diffuse pulmonary inflammation. PF amounts were moderate (0.9+/-0.2 ml). beta-Adrenergic stimulation also increased RVSP but decreased TPR. Interstitial but not alveolar edema and focal inflammation without IL-6 activation developed. Large PF amounts (6.2+/-1.5 ml) occurred which were considered to prevent alveolar edema. We conclude that both alpha- and beta-adrenergic stimulation contribute to pulmonary fluid shifts in rats, but alpha-adrenergic pathways cause more acute and more severe lung injury than beta-adrenergic mechanisms.", 
    "83": "An automated online sample extraction method for rat plasma was developed and validated for the quantification of (R)- and (S)-propranolol following the intravenous administration of either the racemate or the individual enantiomers at 5 mg/kg. A dual-column extraction system coupled to a chiral stationary phase (CSP) was used in conjunction with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. In this method, two Oasis HLB extraction columns (50x1.0 mm) in parallel were used for online plasma sample purification and teicoplanin CSP (Chirobiotic T) was used for the enantiomeric separation. This method allowed the use of one of the extraction columns for purification while the other was being equilibrated. Hence, the time required for re-conditioning the extraction columns did not contribute to the total analysis time per sample, which resulted in a relatively shorter run time and higher throughput. The lower limit of detection was 0.5 ng/ml and the lower limit of quantification was 2 ng/ml for each enantiomer using 25 microl of rat plasma. The method was validated with a linear calibration curve between 2 and 2000 ng/ml for (R)- and (S)-propranolol, respectively. The intra- and inter-day precision (C.V.) was no more than 7.6% and the accuracy of the assay was between 92 and 103%. The teicoplanin CSP proved to be rugged with excellent reproducibility of chromatographic parameters.", 
    "84": "One of the many functions of liver peroxisomes is the beta-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids. It is essential for the continuation of peroxisomal beta-oxidation that a redox shuttle system exist across the peroxisomal membrane to reoxidize NADH. We propose that this redox shuttle system consists of a substrate cycle between lactate and pyruvate. Here we present evidence that purified peroxisomal membranes contain both monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT 1) and MCT 2 and that along with peroxisomal lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) form a Peroxisomal Lactate Shuttle. Peroxisomal beta-oxidation was greatly stimulated by the addition of pyruvate and this increase was partially inhibited by the addition of the MCT blocker alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate (CINN). We also found that peroxisomes generated lactate in the presence of pyruvate. Together these data provide compelling that the Peroxisome Lactate Shuttle helps maintain organelle redox and the proper functioning of peroxisomal beta-oxidation.",

Fifty-four percent of respondents reported launching one or more quality of care initiatives at their hospital in response to the atlas.

The CARD group documented ejection fraction in 90% of cases versus 54% in the IM group (P<0.05). There was no difference in angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor usage (68% versus 63%, P=0.48) or optimal ACE dosage (CARD 50% versus IM 42%, P=0.44).

To study the mechanisms of implantation, an effective assay for monitoring adhesiveness between embryos and endometrial epithelium is essential. In this study, we describe a simple and reliable method to quantify embryo-endometrium adhesion in vitro. Murine blastocysts or BeWo trophoblast spheroids were cocultured with monolayers of RL95-2 endometrial epithelial cells (EEC) grown in 96-well plates. At the end of coculture, the wells were filled with medium, and the plate was sealed with an adhesive film, inverted, and centrifuged at 25 x g for 5 min. After centrifugation, the plate was kept inverted and directly examined microscopically to determine whether the blastocysts or spheroids were attached to EEC monolayers. Our assay demonstrated that blastocysts recovered at 1200-1400 h on d 4 were more adherent to EEC than those recovered earlier, consistent with the timing of intrauterine embryo activation. Serum also enhanced blastocyst-EEC adhesion. Spheroid-EEC adhesion was inhibited by blocking Ca(2+) influx with extracellular Ca(2+) chelators (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid) or a Ca(2+) channel blocker (verapamil) but not by interfering with Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores using chelating (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester) or depleting (thapsigargin) agents. Using 96-well plates for coculture, centrifugation, and examination to minimize transfer procedures, our assay system is readily applicable to investigate implantation mechanisms.",

Rather, heart failure is seen as a complex pathophysiological process with activation of various neuroendocrine systems. The goals of treatment have changed towards modifying these counterproductive neuroendocrine systems and slowing myocardial maladaptation. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are the only licensed drugs in veterinary practice that have a direct effect on neurohormones in heart failure. The range of drug options in human medicine is greater and some of these drugs are also increasingly being used in veterinary cardiology practice.

The pathophysiology of neurocardiogenic syncope is complex and not completely elucidated. Individuals susceptible to neurocardiogenic syncope are unable to maintain the adaptive neurocardiovascular responses to upright posture for prolonged periods. These patients tend to have a modest reduction in central blood volume, which is aggravated by upright posture. It is often noted in individuals receiving sympathetic blocking agents and vasodilator drugs for hypertension, elderly patients receiving tranquilizers, patients with anemia, and individuals with tran- sient reductions in blood volume such as those that occur after a brisk diuresis or blood donation. The classic syncopal episode often is preceded by a constellation of prodromal symptoms several seconds before the event that may include nausea, headache, diaphoresis, dizziness, chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea, and paresthesia.",

    "103": "The purpose of defibrillation is to rapidly restore blood flow and tissue perfusion following ventricular fibrillation (VF) and shock delivery. We tested the hypotheses that 1) a series of 1-ms pulses of various amplitudes delivered before the defibrillation shock can improve hemodynamics following the shock, and 2) this hemodynamic improvement is due to stimulation of cardiac or thoracic sympathetic nerves. Ten anesthetized pigs received a burst of either 15 or 30 1-ms pulses (0.1-10 A in strength) during VF, after which defibrillation was performed. ECG, arterial blood pressure, and left ventricular (LV) pressure were recorded. Defibrillation shocks and burst pulses were delivered from a right ventricular coil electrode to superior vena cava coil and left chest wall electrodes. Sympathetic blockade was induced with 1 mg/kg timolol and trials were repeated. The first half of this protocol was repeated in two animals that were pretreated with reserpine. Heart rate (HR) after 1-, 2-, 5-, and 10-A pulses was significantly higher than after control shocks without preceding pulse therapy. Mean and peak LV pressure measurements increased 38 and 72%, respectively, following shocks preceded by 5- and 10-A pulses compared with shocks preceded by no burst pulses. Mean and peak arterial pressures increased 36 and 43%, respectively, following shocks preceded by 5- and 10-A pulses compared with shocks preceded by no burst pulses. After beta-blockade, HR, mean and peak arterial pressures, and mean LV pressure were not significantly different after pulses of any strength compared with control shocks. LV peak pressure following the 10-A pulses was significantly higher than with no burst pulses but was significantly lower than the response to the 10-A pulses delivered without beta-blockade. HR, mean and peak arterial pressures, and mean and peak LV pressure responses after 15 or 30 5- or 10-A pulses were similar to the responses to the same pulses after beta-blockade. We conclude that a burst of 15-30 1-ms pulses delivered during VF can increase HR, arterial pressure, and LV pressure following defibrillation. beta-Blockade or reserpine pretreatment prevents most of this postshock increase in HR, arterial pressure, and LV pressure.",

No significant difference was found between the two groups when considering preoperative NYHA functional class and left ventricular function. In-hospital mortality was significant higher in MVR than in MRr patients (6.4% versus 0%; p <0.01). QoL was significantly impaired in patients with MVR in physical function (PF), role function (RF) and general health (GH) compared with patients undergoing MRr.

    "108": "When stimulated by glucose the pancreatic beta-cell displays large oscillations of the intracellular free Ca2+concentration, resulting from intermittent Ca2+ entry from the outside and outflow from the inside, the latter process being mediated by the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA) and the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX). To understand the respective role of these two mechanisms, we studied the effect of glucose on PMCA and NCX transcription, expression, and activity in rat pancreatic islet cells. Glucose (11.1 and 22.2 mm) induced a parallel decrease in PMCA transcription, expression, and activity. In contrast the sugar induced a parallel increase in NCX transcription, expression, and activity. The effects of the sugar were mimicked by the metabolizable insulin secretagogue alpha-ketoisocaproate and persisted in the presence of the Ca2+-channel blocker nifedipine. The above results are compatible with the view that, when stimulated, the beta-cell switches from a low efficiency Ca2+-extruding mechanism, the PMCA, to a high capacity system, the Na/Ca exchanger, to better face the increase in Ca2+ inflow. These effects of glucose do not result from a direct effect of the sugar itself and are not mediated by the increase in intracellular free Ca2+ concentration induced by the sugar.", 
    "109": "This study examined the effects of beta-adrenergic and muscarinic blockade on spatial learning and strategy use in the water maze. Male Long-Evans rats received systemic injections of propranolol (PRO; 10 or 20 mg/kg) or scopolamine (SCO; 0.3 or 1.0 mg/kg) either singly or in combination. To separate strategies learning from spatial learning approximately half of the rats underwent water maze strategies pretraining prior to drug administration and spatial training. PRO did not impair performance in any group. SCO impaired naive but not pretrained rats. PRO and SCO given together in high doses impaired all aspects of behavior in both naive and pretrained rats, and caused sensorimotor disturbances in some groups. PRO (10 mg/kg) and SCO (0.3 mg/kg) together caused a specific spatial reversal learning impairment in pretrained rats without causing strategies impairments or sensorimotor disturbances. Nadolol administered with SCO failed to produce the same impairments as PRO, suggesting that PRO produced its effects by acting on central nervous system sites. These results point to a greater than additive impairing effect of PRO and SCO on adaptive behavior, and a specific role for beta-adrenergic and cholinergic systems working in conjunction in spatial learning. They also suggest that some of the behavioral and cognitive impairments seen in Alzheimer patients or patients receiving pharmacotherapy with beta-adrenergic antagonists in which cholinergic activity is also compromised may result from the combined impairment of beta-adrenergic and cholinergic systems.",

Pharmacologically active residues in edible tissues led to intoxication outbreaks in several countries. Pressure of official controls pulsed synthesis of new compounds to escape analytical procedures. We report two new compounds named 'A' and 'G4', found in feeding stuffs. Chemical structure was studied through nuclear magnetic resonance-imaging and infrared spectroscopy, and beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenergic activity was evaluated on isolated guinea-pig atrium and trachea in comparison with clenbuterol. Both compounds share with clenbuterol an halogenated aromatic ring with a primary amino group. Main modifications consisted of substitution of secondary amino group with an alkyl chain in compound A and substitution of the ter-butyl group with a benzene ring in compound G4. In guinea-pig trachea these compounds showed myorelaxant potency lower than clenbuterol (EC(50) was 43.8 nM for clenbuterol, 11700 nM for compound A, 2140 nM for G4). On the contrary, in the guinea-pig atrium (heart-beat rate stimulant effect) the compounds were more potent than clenbuterol (EC(50) was 15.2 nM for clenbuterol, 3.4 nM for compound A, 2.8 nM for G4).

The potential value of these drugs when hypertensive patients suffer an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has, however, not been fully elucidated. The objective of the present observational study was to investigate whether prior use of different antihypertensive drugs could modify or influence in-hospital death in hypertensives suffering an AMI. A total of 299 hypertensive patients with the diagnosis of AMI were included. The demographic data were obtained from medical records. Variables were entered into a logistic regression model. The main predictors of death were age (adjusted odds ratio (ORa) 1.07, p = 0.002 (per each year), and the use of diuretics (ORa 2.54, p = 0.018) and calcium blockers (ORa 2.54, p = 0.010). On the other hand, the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a marked reduction of in-hospital death (ORa 0.44, p = 0.045). The present study indicates that while the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a reduced risk of in-hospital death in hypertensive patients suffering an AMI, the use of diuretics and calcium blockers was associated with increased risks.",

    "124": "Autonomic control of blood pressure appears to decline with age giving rise to an increased risk of orthostatic hypotension and major hypotensive reactions to antihypertensive drugs. In the past few years, many workers have assessed autonomic function in the elderly and sometimes found controversial results. Baroreflex sensitivity, as measured by the steepness of the heart rate/mean pressure curve, decreases with age. However, this phenomenon does not correlate well with orthostatic impairment. Sympathetic dysfunction might be more responsible for syncopal symptoms in the elderly, a finding supported by the fact that elderly with orthostatic symptoms never collapse within a few seconds, but do so after 1 or more minutes of standing. However, the results of sympathetic function testing in the elderly indicate that sympathetic function in most elderly is not impaired and that sympathetic activity, as measured by circulating levels of catecholamines, is usually increased rather than decreased. In various populations with increased sympathetic activity, but not in the elderly, beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers) have been demonstrated to cause pressor effects, presumably due to alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstriction unopposed by beta-receptor-mediated vasodilation. In the past year, large studies have been completed indicating that the same is true for the elderly, and that the depressor effect on pulse pressure upon standing in this category of patients can be offset and turned into a pressor effect by long-term beta-blocker treatment. This phenomenon could not be demonstrated with non-beta-blocker antihypertensive drugs, including ACE inhibitors, calcium channel antagonists, diuretics and angiotensin II receptor antagonists. In elderly patients beta-blockers may, therefore, be the most appropriate antihypertensive agents as they protect the elderly from orthostatic impairment.",

POAG: Latanoprost persistently improves the pulsatile ocular blood flow in primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). Recent trials confirmed the greater IOP-lowering efficacy of latanoprost vs. timolol, dorzolamide, brimonidine and unoprostone. Trials lasting up to 24 months showed that latanoprost is effective in long-term treatment of POAG and ocular hypertension (OH), with no signs of loss of efficacy when compared to timolol or dorzolamide. Latanoprost provides better control of circadian IOP. Non-responders to beta-blockers should preferably be switched to latanoprost monotherapy before a combination therapy is started. The possibility of a fixed combination of latanoprost and timolol has been explored, with promising results. NTG: Latanoprost is effective in normal tension glaucoma (NTG), lowering IOP, improving pulsatile ocular blood flow and increasing ocular perfusion pressure. OTHER GLAUCOMAS: Latanoprost may provide effective IOP control in angle-closure glaucoma after iridectomy, in pigmentary glaucoma, glaucoma after cataract extraction and steroid-induced glaucoma.

    "142": "We analysed the influence of aging on the acute effect of clenbuterol, a beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonist, on the vasoconstrictor response induced by electrical field stimulation in mesenteric arteries from young and old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Clenbuterol increased the contraction elicited by electrical field stimulation in arteries from both groups, and this was prevented by propranolol. N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) also increased the electrical field stimulation-elicited contractions in arteries from both age groups. However, pretreatment with capsaicin increased the electrical field stimulation-induced contractions in young SHRs, but did not modify it in old SHRs. In segments from young SHRs, the treatment with the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist, CGRP-(8-37), induced an increase in the electrical field stimulation-induced vasoconstrictor response that was not modified by the subsequent addition of capsaicin. Addition of clenbuterol to L-NAME-treated segments from both groups further increased the response to electrical field stimulation. In segments from young SHRs, clenbuterol failed to increase the electrical field stimulation-induced response in the capsaicin-treated segments, but the response was increased by the subsequent addition of L-NAME. The addition of L-NAME to the clenbuterol-treated segments from old SHRs did not modify the enhanced electrical field stimulation response. Electrical field stimulation induced a similar tritium release in arteries from young and old SHRs preincubated with [3H]noradrenaline. In arteries from young SHRs, isoproterenol increased this release and the increase was abolished by propranolol. Clenbuterol increased the stimulated tritium overflow and exogenous noradrenaline response only in segments from old SHRs, and both effects were abolished by propranolol. To summarize and conclude, clenbuterol increased the electrical field stimulation-induced contraction in segments from both age groups. In young SHRs, clenbuterol seems to inhibit CGRP release, while in old SHRs, it increases the release of and response to noradrenaline and decreases neuronal nitric oxide (NO) release.", 
    "143": "We investigated the role played by catecholamine-dependent pathways in modulating the ability of the nitric oxide (NO) donor 3-morpholino-sydnonimine (SIN-1) to release adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) following its intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) or intravenous (i.v.) injection. We first showed that the nonspecific adrenergic agonist noradrenaline, the alpha- or beta-adrenergic agonists phenylephrine or dobutamine, or the noradrenergic uptake inhibitor desipramine, all significantly stimulated ACTH secretion by freely moving, nonanaesthetized rats. We then observed that destruction of noradrenergic nerve endings with the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine, respectively abolished and significantly decreased the ACTH response to the i.c.v. or i.v. administration of SIN-1. Finally, we sought to identify the type of adrenergic receptor(s) mediating the influence of catecholamines. beta-Adrenergic receptors did not appear to be involved in the stimulatory effect of SIN-1 regardless of its route of injection. By contrast, alpha 2-adrenergic receptors played an important role in the ACTH response to i.v. or i.c.v. administered SIN-1. Collectively, these results indicate that while hypothalamic alpha 1- and beta-adrenergic receptors are important for hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity, only alpha 2-adrenergic receptors are involved in modulating the ability of NO to release ACTH. Our laboratory and others have previously reported that NO increased hypothalamic noradrenaline levels, while conversely noradrenaline up-regulated levels of NO synthase, the enzyme responsible for NO formation; and that injection of corticotropin-releasing factor into the brain ventricles releases catecholamines and stimulates NO formation. Taken together with these observations, our results point to complex functional relationships between NO, catecholamines and the HPA axis.",

    "148": "Nonglycosidic inotropic agents have been used for the short-term management of low output states and hypotension complicating acute myocardial infarction for several years. Without adequate reperfusion of the ischemic myocardium, inotropic agents are seldom effective in producing sustained hemodynamic responses. Furthermore, the potential exists for enhancement of ischemia and extension of myocardial necrosis. Thus, inotropic and vasopressors therapy should be regarded as temporary supportive treatment in patients with acute coronary syndrome and should be discontinued as soon as feasible. Parenteral sympathomimetic agents, usually dobutamine, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors, usually milrinone, are used for the management of exacerbations of chronic systolic heart failure. Although hemodynamics, and occasionally clinical status, improve, such therapy is associated with increased mortality and can potentially hasten a patient's demise. Nonparenteral sympathomimetics, such as ibopamine, phosphodiesterase-III inhibitors, such as milrinone and enoximone, calcium-sensitizing agents, such as pimobendan, and other novel inotropic agents, such as vesnarinone, all increase mortality of patients with chronic heart failure. Furthermore, newer noninotropic agents, such as B-natriuretic peptide, have been introduced for treatment of decompensated heart failure. New nonpharmacologic devices, such as biventricular pacing, are available for the treatment of advanced heart failure. Thus, indications for the use of presently available nonglycosidic inotropic agents are limited and should be considered only for short-term therapy or when no other treatment is available.",

The evidence is overwhelming. There are some subgroups of patients, such as the very elderly and those with a normal ejection fraction, where uncertainty still exists. The combination of a diuretic and an ACE inhibitor is currently the proper treatment of congestive heart failure; a beta-blocker should be added in selected patients. The evidence for the efficacy of ARB is less persuasive and, for the present, this class of drug should be prescribed only when an ACE inhibitor cannot be tolerated. The results of the trials emphasize an emerging problem in medicine, namely how to evaluate a new treatment that may be as efficacious as current therapy but with fewer side-effects. Proving equivalence in efficacy will be difficult, requiring large studies comparing new drugs with the best current treatment. The most common etiology of heart failure is coronary heart disease. If further studies provide more support for the idea that ACE inhibitors prevent ischemic episodes and delay the onset of heart failure, then a new indication for ACE inhibitors will be the prevention of heart failure.",

Beta-blockers are best deployed as a form of tertiary prevention in heart failure but have a very limited role for the treatment of a heart failure crisis. Physicians and patients need to understand the time course of the effects of beta-blocker therapy. The initial effects are often neutral or adverse, though the benefits, at least of carvedilol, may be apparent within days in patients with severe heart failure. Benefits accumulate gradually over a period of weeks to months. Some patience, perseverance, and education are required in order to allow patients to reap the full benefits of beta-blocker therapy for this malignant disease. Initiation of treatment early in the course of the disease maximizes the effectiveness and acceptance of therapy. Trials are under way to determine whether the benefits of beta-blockers extend to patients over 80 years of age and to those with preserved LV systolic function. It is likely that important differences exist between beta-blockers in terms of their clinical benefit, though whether differences exist between the agents that have been reported to be effective so far awaits the outcome of a large clinical trial. It is unclear whether the target doses of beta-blockers currently recommended are optimal.", 
    "151": "Despite the introduction of a variety of new classes of drugs for the management of heart failure, digoxin continues to have an important role in long-term outpatient management. A wide variety of placebo-controlled clinical trials have unequivocally shown that treatment with digoxin can improve symptoms, quality of life, and exercise tolerance in patients with mild, moderate, or severe heart failure. These benefits are evident regardless of the underlying rhythm (normal sinus rhythm or atrial fibrillation), etiology of the heart failure, or concomitant therapy (eg. ACE inhibitors). Unlike other agents with positive inotropic properties, digoxin does not increase all-cause mortality and has a substantial benefit in reducing heart failure hospitalizations. Consensus guidelines have recently been published by the Heart Failure Society of America and the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, and they contain the following recommendations for digoxin treatment: 1. Digoxin should be considered for the outpatient treatment of all patients who have persistent symptoms of heart failure (NYHA class II-IV) despite conventional pharmacologic therapy with diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and a beta-blocker when the heart failure is caused by systolic dysfunction (the strength of evidence = A for NYHA class II and III; strength of evidence = C for NYHA class IV). 2. Digoxin is not indicated as primary treatment for the stabilization of patients with acutely decompensated heart failure. (Strength of evidence = B). Digoxin may be initiated after emergent treatment of heart failure has been completed in an effort to establish a long-term treatment strategy. 3. Digoxin should not be administered to patients who have significant sinus or atrioventricular block, unless the block has been treated with a permanent pacemaker (strength of evidence = B). The drug should be used cautiously in patients who receive other agents known to depress sinus or atrioventricular nodal function (such as amiodarone or a beta-blocker) (strength of evidence = B). 4. The dosage of digoxin should be 0.125-0.25 mg daily in the majority of patients (strength of evidence = C). The lower dose should be used in patients over 70 years of age, those with impaired renal function, or those with a low lean body mass. Higher doses (eg, digoxin 0.375-0.50 mg daily) are rarely needed. Loading doses of digoxin are not necessary during initiation of therapy for patients with chronic heart failure. 5. Serial assessment of serum digoxin levels is unnecessary in most patients. The radioimmunoassay was developed to assist in the evaluation of toxicity, not the efficacy of the drug. There appears to be little relationship between serum digoxin concentration and the drug's therapeutic effects. 6. Digoxin toxicity is commonly associated with serum levels >2 ng/mL but may occur with lower digoxin levels if hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or hypothyroidism coexist. Likewise, the concomitant use of agents such as quinidine, verapamil, spironolactone, flecainide, and amiodarone can increase serum digoxin levels and increase the likelihood of digoxin toxicity. 7. For patients with heart failure and atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, the administration of high doses of digoxin (>0.25 mg daily) for the purpose of rate control is not recommended. When necessary, additional rate control should be achieved by the addition of beta-blocker therapy or amiodarone (strength of evidence = C). If amiodarone is added, the dose of digoxin should be reduced. Digitalis preparations are now entering their fourth century of clinical use for the treatment of chronic heart failure symptoms. Its clinical efficacy can no longer be doubted and its safety has been verified by the multicenter DIG trial. Future advances in pharmacogenetics should facilitate identification of those patients most likely to benefit from its pharmacologic effects."
