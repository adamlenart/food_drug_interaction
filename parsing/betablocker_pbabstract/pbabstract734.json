Marked increase in the presystolic length and size of active shortening of the remote areas was noted by the 20th second. In the ischemic zone these values decreased. Due to the effect of a therapeutic dose of inderal, the intensifying reaction of the remote areas diminished markedly and the unfavourable effect of ischemia on the stretching and shortening functions of the ischemic zone became somewhat weaker. Metacin caused no such effect.", 
    "1": "An accurate, rapid, and sensitive GLC determination of alprenolol and oxprenolol in serum is described. This method combines an electron-capture detector with a wall-coated open tubular column. The lowest detectable amount of the halogenated (heptafluoroacyl) derivatives of alprenolol and oxprenolol is 2 pg. The high resolving power and the rapid elution time of the wall-coated open tubular column dramatically improve the performance (accuracy and sensitivity) of the conventional electron-capture detector and packed column system in these determinations. This method allows the use of small volumes of sample (100-200 microliter), does not require redistilled reagents, and has a simplified extraction procedure.", 
    "2": "The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of direct stimulation of the sympathetic nerves on the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) in the anesthetized cat. Neither unilateral nor bilateral cervical sympathectomy, or splanchnicectomy significantly modified basal LES pressure in animals with intact vagi, or animals having undergone bilateral cervical vagotomy. Electrical stimulation of the cut, peripheral, cervical sympathetic trunk increased mean arterial blood pressure, but had no effect on LES pressure or LES relaxation as induced by vagal stimulation. Stimulation of the central end of the cervical sympathetic trunk had no effect on LES pressure. Stimulation of the central end of the cut splanchnic nerve produced a decrease in LES pressure with a maximal response of 69.1+/-16.0% (mean+/-SEM). This inhibitory response was not modified by either propranolol or bilateral cervical vagotomy. Stimulation of the peripheral end of the cut, greater splanchnic nerve gave an increase in LES pressure with a maximal response of 38.2+/-7.19 mm Hg. Guanethidine, in the presence or absence of the adrenal glands, significantly augmented this excitatory response. This response was also slightly increased by phentolamine alone at 10 V, 1 Hz, but was not altered by propranolol. The excitatory response was completely antagonized by atropine or by trimethaphan camsylate. Stimulation of the peripheral end of the splanchnic nerve inhibited LES relaxation as induced by vagal stimulation. The results of this study suggest that: (a) the LES in the cat is not affected by either central or peripheral stimulation of the cervical sympathetic trunk; (b) the central portion of the splanchnic nerve carries an afferent inhibitory response to the LES through yet unknown pathways; (c) the peripheral splanchnic nerve carries an atropine-sensitive excitatory response to the LES; and (d) the splanchnic nerves may modulate LES relaxation as induced by vagal stimulation.", 
    "3": "In lactating rats, vasoactive prostaglandin (PG) doses of F2 alpha (4 and 8 microgram/kg), E1, and E2 (2 and 4 microgram/kg each) reduced the intramammary pressure response to standard iv doses of 300 microU oxytocin by 50--80%. Adrenergic blockers, phenoxybenzamine and/or propranolol (1 mg/kg each sc) did not influence the blood pressure response to PGF2 alpha, PGE1, or PGE2. The oxytocin-antagonistic action of a single iv PGF2 alpha dose (4 microgram/kg) could not be altered by adrenergic blockers. In contrast, the oxytocin-antagonistic effects of PGE1 and PGE2 (2 microgram/kg each) were completely eliminated after alpha-receptor blockade, while the activity of oxytocin was augmented. Under beta-receptor or alpha- and beta-receptor blockade, the oxytocin-antagonistic effects of PGE1 and PGE2 were almost abolished. alpha-Receptor blockade reduced the oxytocin-antagonistic action of infused PGF2 alpha (8 microgram/kg.min for 15 min) by 38%. beta- or alpha- and beta-receptor blockade had no effect. The oxytocin-antagonistic actions of PGE1 and PGE2 (4 microgram/kg.min for 15 min each) were greatly reduced under alpha-receptor blockade. beta-Receptor blockade had no influence on the oxytocin-antagonistic activities of PGE1 or PGE2; under alpha- and beta-receptor blockade, the inhibitory actions of PGE1 and PGE2 were reduced by 60--70%. Mechanisms of PG-induced inhibition of the oxytocin response may involve mammary vasoconstriction and/or alterations in myoepithelial activity of cAMP and cGMP.", 
    "4": "Using 3H-adrenalin the quantity and characteristics of the adrenalin receptors on human platelets were evaluated. Maximum adrenalin binding by intact platelets from eight normal subjects averaged 3.2 ng adrenalin/10(8) platelets, equivalent to 105 000 binding sites per platelet. Bound 3H-adrenalin could be dissociated or binding could be inhibited by an excess of unlabelled adrenalin, noradrenalin, isoproterenol or dopamine; phentolamine or propanalol had no effect on 3h-adrenalin binding, even in concentrations 10 000-fold greater. These studies show that the epinephrine binding site can be detected and quantitiated on human platelets and that its characteristics differ from those classically attributed to either alpha or beta adrenergic receptors.", 
    "5": "beta-Phenylethylamine increased mean aortic blood pressure, total peripheral vascular resistance, left ventricular dP/dt, and (dP/dt)/P in chloralose-anesthetized dogs. Pretreatment with phentolamine reduced the increases in aortic blood pressure and total peripheral vascular resistance produced by beta-phenylethylamine, whereas, the effects of beta-phenylethylamine on left ventricular dP/dt and (dP/dt)/P were abolished by propranolol. beta-Phenylethylamine pretreatment, but increased both after phentolamine pretreatment. Furthermore, both the cardiac and vascular effects of beta-phenylethylamine were abolished by desipramine. These results indicate that beta-phenylethylamine exerts both positive inotropic and vasoconstrictory effects, probably by releasing endogenous norepinephrine from the adrenergic nerve endings.", 
    "6": "An HPLC method for the quantitative determination of propranolol, 4-hydroxypropranolol, and propranolol glycol in human plasma is described. The limits of sensitivity for the method were: 1 ng/ml propranolol; 5 ng/ml 4-hydroxypropranolol; and 1 ng/ml propranolol glycol. Data obtained from 6 healthy volunteers given a single 160 mg oral dose of propranolol revealed mean (+/- SEM) peak plasma levels of 31 +/- 10 ng/ml for 4-hydroxypropranolol and 9 +/- 2 ng/ml for propranolol glycol. These plasma levels were less than the peak concentrations recorded for propranolol (123 +/- 34 ng/ml. The rates of plasma decay of these two metabolites were greater than that observed for propranolol.", 
    "7": "The contribution of autonomic nervous system activity to the cardiovascular effects of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) was evaluated in 4 normal subjects. The peak heart rate rise after THC was attenuated by atropine and by propranolol, and nearly abolished by atropine-propranolol pretreatment. Blocking drugs also attenuated THC-induced changes in forearm blood flow and vascular resistance but did not affect changes in fingertip temperature. The data suggest that THC acts to induce sympathetic stimulation and parasympathetic inhibition of cardiovascular control pathways. Cardiovascular responses in an additional subject who developed hypertension after either intravenous or smoked marijuana are described.", 
    "8": "Six healthy subjects were given placebo and a single oral 0.2-gm dose of alprenolol (Aptin) before and after 0.1 gm pentobarbital at bedtime for 10 days. The plasma concentrations of alprenolol and its metabolite 4-hydroxy-alprenolol and the inhibition of exercise tachycardia were studied for 7 hr after the alprenolol. Alprenolol and 4-hydroxy-alprenolol plasma levels were decreased by about 40% by pentobarbital but plasma half-lives were unchanged. The inhibition of exercise tachycardia during a 7-hr period was reduced from 14.0% to 10.7% by pentobarbital. The reduction was proportional to the decreased drug plasma levels. There was a significant contribution of the metabolite to alprenolol effect. The estimation of relative potency of metabolite against parent compound was 0.9 before pentobarbital and 1.9 after pentobarbital.", 
    "9": "Twelve healthy volunteers received four single doses of atenolol (25-, 50-, and 100-mg oral solutions and a 50-mg intravenous infusion), each dose separated by at least one week. Blood and urine assayed for atenolol by a high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. Kinetic analysis of the intravenous data indicates a three-compartment model with elimination from the central compartment. The mean (+/- SD) terminal elimination half-life is 6.06 +/- 2.02 hr, the mean volume of the central compartment is 0.173 L/kg, and 94.1 +/- 8.0% of the intravenous dose is excreted in the urine. The mean value of the plasma clearance is 10.7 +/- 1.27 L/hr and of the renal plasma clearance, 10.4 +/- 1.14 L/hr. The mean absolute bioavailability for the 25-, 50-, and 100-mg oral doses is 0.52 +/- 0.18, 0.54 +/- 0.12, and 0.58 +/- 0.16, respectively. The maximum plasma concentration varies as a linear function of dose. Time to mean maximum plasma concentration (3.0 hr) and the time for half of the bioavailable dose to be absorbed (2.0 hr) do not differ significantly with dose. The mean renal plasma clearance after oral doses (9.49 +/- 1.6 L/hr) is in the same range as renal clearance after intravenous doses.", 
    "10": "The ocular effects in rabbits of topically applied labetalol hydrochloride, a new alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent, were studied. A dose-related reduction in intraocular pressure (IOP) followed treatment with 0.01% to 1% solutions. Labetalol at a 1% concentration had no effect on pupil diameter. The same dose blocked an increase in IOP after water loading but did not significantly alter the coefficient of aqueous outflow facility. Mydriasis induced by phenylephrine hydrochloride was competitively inhibited.", 
    "11": "To assess the problem of continuing propranolol therapy in a breast-feeding mother, studies were performed to determine simultaneously plasma and breast milk concentrations of propranolol after single dose (40 mg) and continuous dose (40 mg 4 times daily) treatment with this drug. Breast milk and plasma concentrations of propranolol peaked between 2 and 3 hours after dosing. Propranolol concentrations in breast milk were less than 40 and 64 percent, respectively, of peak plasma propranolol concentrations after single dose and continuous dose administration. It was estimated that the maximal cumulative propranolol load to this breast-feeding infant, consuming 500 ml of whole milk, when the mother received 40 mg of propranolol 4 times daily would be 21 microgram/24 hours. This dose is considerably less than the usual therapeutic dose of propranolol for infants.", 
    "12": "In this study, we evaluated the effect of sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a vascular smooth-muscle relaxant, on lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure in the opossum. Resting LES pressure was monitored with a perfused sleeve sensor which allows accurate recording of LES pressure irrespective of axial LES motion. Intravenous pulse doses and infusion doses of SNP both caused significant decreases in both blood pressure and LES pressure. Les tone, however, was more sensitive to SNP than blood pressure. For example, an SNP pulse dose of 20 microgram/kg which lowered blood pressure only about 30% virtually abolished LES tone. A similar result was obtained for an SNP infusion dose of 10 microgram/kg/min. Tachyphylaxis to SNP did not occur for repeated pulse doses to 10 microgram/kg, but did develop during a 20-min infusion of 10 microgram/kg/min. The effect of SNP on LES pressure was not antagonized by propranolol, metiamide, haloperidol, atropine, phentolamine, or tetrodotoxin. We conclude that the potent depressant effect of SNP on LES tone is due to a direct action of the drug on sphincter smooth muscle.", 
    "13": "Studies were made on the effects of long-term beta-blockade on the QT interval in patients discharged alive from hospital after myocardial infarction. The patients (n = 230) in this study constituted all those who participated in the alprenolol study on postmyocardial patients in G\u00f6teborg, Sweden. The study was double-blind (alprenolol 200 mg b.i.d. or placebo) and randomised. The patients were divided into 4 risk groups (1-4) with different predicted mortality. The electrocardiograms before and after 8 weeks of treatment were analysed with respect to heart rate and QT time. There was a decrease in heart rate of about 10% in the alprenolol treated patients. The QT time was not significantly influenced by alprenolol. The rate corrected QT time (QTc) decreased in the subgroup of the most severely diseased patients (subgroup 4) treated with alprenolol.", 
    "14": "The antihypertensive effect of Inderectic, a new combination capsule of propranolol 80 mg and bendrofluazide 2.5 mg, given twice daily was investigated in 21 hypertensive patients using a double-blind randomized crossover method. Inderectic was compared with either agent used alone and with the same combination given as separate tablets. It gave a greater fall in mean lying and standing systolic and diastolic blood pressure than either agent alone. There was no statistically significant difference for the effect on these variables between the free combination and combined formulation. Only minor side-effects were recorded, no patient having to be withdrawn from the study and no biochemical changes were observed.", 
    "15": "1 The antihypertensive effects at rest and during physical exercise of the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blocker propranolol and the cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor blocker metoprolol were compared in a double-blind cross-over study. 2 Eighteen patients with mild hypertension entered the trial. One patient was withdrawn from the study due to side effects on both drugs. 3 The two beta-adrenoceptor blockers were compared using doses earlier shown to have the same beta-adrenoceptor blocking potency, as measured by their effect on exercise tachycardia in healthy men. 4 Arterial blood pressure was reduced to the same extent by propranolol and metoprolol at rest as well as during submaximal work. 5 It is concluded that the antihypertensive effect of beta-adrenoceptor blockers is mainly mediated through blockade of the beta 1-adrenoceptors.", 
    "16": "1 The hypotensive effect of single daily dosing with atenolol 100 mg and chlorthalidone 25 mg given alone or in combination has been assessed in a double-blind, crossover, placebo controlled trial in fifteen hypertensive patients. 2 Average lying blood pressures were: Placebo 155.4/103.9 mm Hg, atenolol 134.6/85.8 mm Hg, chlorthalidone 139.5/90.1 mm Hg, combination 127.7/82.5 mm Hg. 3 The effect of the combination therapy in reducing lying diastolic pressure compared with placebo (a fall of 21.4 mm Hg) was significantly less than the 31.9 mm Hg fall predicted from the sum of the individual effects (P = 0.01). 4 Observations on blood pressure at rest and under mental, isometric and bicycle ergometer stress were made pre-dose and post-dose for a 12 h period at the end of the last treatment period. 5 Lying blood pressure declined from the zero hour (pre-dose) reading on all treatments to a low at 15.00--18.00 h and then rose again. 6 The rise in systolic blood pressure after isometric exercise and mental stress was of a similar magnitude with all four treatment regimes. 7 Atenolol, alone and in combination with chlorthalidone, reduced the blood pressure and the pulse rate increase on exercise 2 h post-dose when compared with readings 24 h post-dose. 8 Once daily dosing with a combination of atenolol and chlorthalidone produced a fall in supine blood pressure over a 24 h period but the effect on exercise induced changes was not uniform over this period.", 
    "17": "The antihypertensive effect of the selective beta-1-adrenoceptor blocker, metoprolol, administered once daily was evaluated in 32 patients with primary hypertension. After a 4-wk placebo period, the patients were treated with either 150 mg or 300 mg of metoprolol, once daily, for 8 wk. Initially and during the treatment periods blood was drawn for analysis of metoprolol in plasma, plasma renin activity (PRA), and electrolytes, and urine was collected for determination of the urinary aldosterone excretion. Metoprolol reduced the blood pressure measured up to 26 hr after the last dose. The percentage of responders to metoprolol (decrease of mean arterial pressure greater than or equal to 10% over placebo) was 40% for patients on 150 mg and 71% for patients on 300 mg. Except in the standing position, heart rates were reduced for 26 hr after a 150-mg dose. There was a correlation between pretreatment PRA levels and antihypertensive effect of metoprolol in patients on 300 mg metoprolol but not in patients on 150 mg. Urinary aldosterone decreased equally during treatment in responders and nonresponders. Antihypertensive effects and side effects did not correlate with plasma metoprolol concentrations.", 
    "18": "A randomized, double-masked trial of various concentrations of timolol maleate ophthalmic solution (0.1%, 0.25%, 0.5%, and 1.0%) vs placebo demonstrated that all concentrations of timolol effectively lowered intraocular pressure (IOP). A 0.5% solution of timolol was as effective in reducing IOP as the 1.0% concentration. Blood pressure, visual acuity, and pupillary diameter were not altered significantly by any concentration of timolol tested during this study. There was a dose-dependent decrease in resting pulse rate with increasing concentrations of timolol. No objective signs of drug intolerance were found on external ocular examination, nor were any subjective symptoms elicited on questioning the subjects. Timolol applied topically twice daily in concentrations of 0.1% to 0.5% appeared to be an effective and safe ocular hypotensive agent.", 
    "19": "The safety and beneficial effect of continuation of propranolol (Pr) through coronary bypass surgery (CBS) was studied in two groups of patients. In the control group (50 patients) Pr was discontinued 24 h before CBS without reinstitution afterwards. In the propranolol group the drug was maintained up to 4 to 10 h before surgery and was restarted within 24 h afterwards. The incidence of subendocardial myocardial infarction was significantly lower in the Pr group (1 out of 30 vs 10 out of 50, p less than 0.05) while the incidence of transmural infarction was the same in both groups (3 out of 30, 10%, vs 5 out of 50, 10%). The incidence of supraventricular tachycardias during the first three postoperative days was significantly lower in the propranolol group compared to control (5% vs 30%, p less than 0.01). The 24 h urinary epinephrine and norepinephrine excretion was significantly greater than normal the day before surgery (136 +/- 12 vs 39 +/- 4 micrograms/24 h, p less than 0.01), and was still high two weeks after surgery (115.1 +/- 14 micrograms/24 h). There were no complications related to propranolol. The left ventricular function as measured from the systolic time intervals was the same pre- and postoperatively in both groups. The results of this study show that administration of propranolol up to 4 h before coronary bypass and reinstitution immediately afterwards is safe and beneficial.", 
    "20": "In anesthetized dogs, with the aid of catheterization and perfusion of the coronary arteries roith heporinesed blood, catheterization of the heart cavities, and synchronous recording of the hemodynamics in unopened thorax, the mechanisms of neural regulation of the coronary circulation were analysed. Tonic effects of the nervous system on the coronary vessels are insignificant, coronary resistance being maintained by the high basal tonus. The cholinergic and adrenergic mechaniseins interact with the more powerful metabolic mechanisms. The concrete interrelationships between the cholinergic and the adrenergic mechanisms in the heart adrenergic responses as well as their probable physiological significance, are discussed.", 
    "21": "Exogenous cyclic 3',5'-AMP (cAMP) and substances known to increase the intracellular concentration of this nucleotide (isoproterenol, theophylline, noradrenaline, lactate) were shown to inhibit the transport of fluorescein (a weak organic acid) into the rat renal proximal tubules at 20 degrees C. Carbacholine decreasing intracellular cAMP concentration stimulated the transport. Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blockator, diminished significantly the inhibitory effect of noradrenaline on the transport. Lactate and carbacholine when added simultaneously, neutralize their action. The inhibitory action of intracellular cAMP on the transport is supposed to be a result of the diminition of a pool of endogenous weak organic acids which may take part in the exchange of diffusion with the marker anion across basal plasma membrane.", 
    "22": "In anesthetized vagotomized dogs with renal arterial pressure constant, carotid sinus hypotension (BCO) caused a reflex rise in systemic arterial pressure, a fall in renal blood flow, and a similar increase in renin release from both kidneys. Unilateral alpha-adrenoceptor blockade with phenoxybenzamine resulted in an increase in basal renal blood flow, a depression of basal renin release, and an abolition of the responses to BCO in the treated kidney. The untreated kidney responsed to BCO as before. Nonblocked and alpha-blocked kidneys released similar amounts of renin when renal blood flow was mechanically reduced by aortic constriction. Administration of propranolol to the nonblocked kidney prevented the release of renin but not the hemodynamic changes resulting from BCO. The experiments demonstrated that under certain conditions carotid sinus hypotension produced alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated changes in the kidney sufficient to cause increased renin release. A step in the renin release mechanism subsequent to the alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated changes in sensitive to propranolol.", 
    "23": "Electrical stimulation of perivascular nerve bundles of mouse liver perfused in situ at constant flow resulted in an increase of glucose production that was maximal at 20 Hz. The neurally induced glucose output was inhibited significantly by the beta-blocker propranolol, and to a considerably greater extent by the alpha-blockers, phenoxybenzamine and phentolamine. The effect of 20-Hz electrical stimulation could be matched by an infusion of norepinephrine at a concentration of 5 X 10(-7) M. It is suggested that the carbohydrate metabolism of the liver is controlled by its own nerve supply rather than by circulating catecholamines and that alpha-adrenergic receptors have a greater effect than beta-receptors on hepatic glucose production resulting from electrical and catecholamine stimulation.", 
    "24": "The effects of dibutyryl-cyclic AMP (DBcAMP), propranolol, and theophylline on endotoxin (LPS) challenged pregnant mice was determined by comparing the patterns of termination and times of fetal expulsion. Endotoxin isolated from wild type (WT) and Re chemotype mutant cells of Salmonella typhimurium was used. Wild type LPS caused the expulsion of the fetuses, while Re LPS primarily caused the resorption of the fetuses. The major change in pattern occurred in the propranolol treated Re LPS challenged group with a trend toward more expulsions and a decrease in uterine cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels to that approaching the group challenged with wild type LPS. The time of expulsion was also affected in the wild type LPS treated group, with propranolol hastening and DBcAMP and theophylline delaying the expulsion. These results support the hypothesis that uterine cAMP is involved in the expulsion of the fetuses.", 
    "25": "Both atenolol 50 mg daily (A-50) and atenolol 100 mg daily (A-100) significantly reduced the angina attacks per week compared with placebo (p less than 0.05). Nitroglycerine consumption was less on A-50 (p less than 0.05) and on A-100 (p less than 0.025) than on placebo. There was no difference between the atenolol dosages in these respects. In comparison with placebo, atenolol gave a significant increase in total work performed until the appearance of 1 mm ST segment depression in bicycle exercise tests made between 3--4 p.m. (A-50: p less than 0.05; A-100: p less than 0.0017). The rate-pressure products (systolic BP X heart rate X 10(-2) at 6' at 30 W) was 163.5 +/- 12.5 (S.E.) on placebo. It diminished to 129.8 +/- 7.9 on A-50 (p less than 0.01) and to 113.9 +/- 6.6 on A-100 (p less than 0.001). The effect of A-100 on the rate-pressure product was stronger than that of A-50 (p less than 0.05). Relative heart volume did not change on A-50 compared with placebo but A-100 resulted in a slight enlargement of 22 ml/m2 BSA when compared to placebo (p less than 0.01). Side effects were minimal.", 
    "26": "Exercise tolerance was repeatedly determined over a 2-year period in a series of 100 patients with coronary heart disease randomly allocated for medical therapy and coronary bypass surgery. The surgical group had a consistently better exercise tolerance than the medical group during the whole follow-up. Completeness of the revascularization, assessed by repeated graft and native vessel angiography, resulted in a marked improvement whereas incompletely revascularized patients exhibited only a marginal improvement which, nevertheless, to some degree exceeded the result of medical management alone. It is concluded that coronary bypass surgery and medical therapy, when indicated, result in markedly better exercise tolerance than medical management alone. This improvement persists up two years after the operation and is largely dependent on the completeness of the revascularization.", 
    "27": "The effect of catecholamine in vivo was studied on purine catabolism in rats and chickens. Catecholamine, administered intraperitoneally in a high dose, markedly increased plasma uric acid and allantoin in rats, and an increase was also observed with intravenous infusion of a lower dose of catecholamine. The effects of catecholamine were characterized by inhibition with alpha and beta adrenoceptor antagonists. Regarding the mechanism of this catecholamine action on purine catabolism, it was shown that catecholamine stimulated degradation of tissue ATP into the end-product. Plasma allantoin, the final purine catabolite in rats, elicited by catecholamine could be maintained under conditions of renal failure, although the action of catecholamine in intact rat was short lasting. The effect of catecholamine was potentiated and/or prolonged by angiotensin-II and aminophylline, and a hyperuricemic state could be induced by catecholamine treatment in chickens. In addition, increase of plasma purine catabolite by immobilization stress in rats suggested the involvement of endogenous catecholamine. From these experimental results, it is considered that catecholamines probably play a important role in the pathogenesis of hyperuricemia.", 
    "28": "Antihypertensive effects of chronic oral administration of adrenergic beta-blocking agents were assessed in SHR. Propranolol, pindolol, oxprenolol, atenolol and labetalol were used as beta-blockers and the effects of these compounds on the blood pressure and the heart rate were compared with those of hydralazine, a representative vasodilating antihypertensive agent. Propranolol, oxprenolol and atenolol produced a definite decrease in the heart rate; the development of hypertension was retarded. Pindolol produced antihypertensive effects only after a longer period of administration and such were associated with insignificant decrease in heart rate. With a shorter period of administration the drug produced only an insignificant fall of blood pressure with practically no change in the heart rate. With labetalol, a beta-blocker with alpha-blocking action, a fall of blood pressure appeared earlier and was of greater magnitude. Hydralazine produced a definite antihypertensive effect, which appeared immediately after administration and was associated with a tachycardia. In pithed rats, only pindolol produced a definite fall of blood pressure. On the basis of these findings, possible mechanisms of antihypertensive effects of beta-blockers were discussed.", 
    "29": "Nine healthy male volunteers were studied at rest and during exercise before and after acute local beta-blockade in one leg. Oxygen uptake, arterial pressure, heart rate, leg blood flow and arterial-femoral venous differences for oxygen and lactate were determined. In addition, five subjects were studied at rest during adrenaline infusion to test the blockade; in this situation the increase in leg blood flow and decrease in resistance seen in the control leg were prevented in the blocked leg. During exercise, the beta-blockade did not influence leg blood flow. At rest, lactate release was abolished from the blocked leg, and during exercise the release was reduced by 50%. These findings demonstrate that acute betareceptor blockade does not interfere with the exercise-induced vasadilation but has metabolic consequences reflected by a reduction in the release of lactate from the leg.", 
    "30": "Pheochromocytoma is an infrequent cause of hypertension. In spite of its rarity, pheochromocytoma has assumed notorious importance because or a wide variety of clinical features associated with this syndrome. Hypertension remains the most important clinical lead. The presence of other features, such as severe headache, perspiration, palpitations or orthostatic hypotension, makes the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma likely. The diagnosis of this condition can be made with greater certainty than that of any other form of secondary hypertension. Pharmacologic tests are no longer used for evaluation purposes. Biochemical tests are the most important aids to diagnosis, provided highly specific methods are used to determine the levels of urinary catecholamines or their metabolites. Interference by various drugs should be avoided. Most of the pheochromocytomas are found in the abdomen, predominantly in the adrenals. Successful outcome of surgery depends critically on adequate preoperative preparation of the patient with adrenergic blocking drugs and proper intraoperative care. Surgery should only be performed in an institution with experience in treating these tumors. Invasive localizing procedures could be dangerous in patients with pheochromocytoma and are best avoided. Medical therapy proves to be quite successful for those patients who are unable or unwilling to undergo surgery and for those with demonstrated malignant tumor. The postoperative course in most instances is uneventful. The physician should be aware of familial forms of pheochromocytomas and screen all the hypertensive members of the patient's family for the presence of this condition. Pheochromocytoma, with its multiple facets, presents a challenge to the clinician; however, with prompt diagnosis and proper treatment, pheochromocytoma can often be cured. The improved management of patients with this potentially lethal condition is the result of better knowledge of biochemical pharmacology, improved preoperative, surgical and postoperative care.", 
    "31": "The authors studied 43 cases of arterial hypertension in pregnancy in an attempt to determine the efficiency and safety of different anti-hypertensive drugs. The patients were divided into two major groups: arterial hypertension which revealed itself during pregnancy (true toxaemias of pregnancy and relapsing toxaemias), and arterial hypertensions which were added on to a pre-existing pathology (arterial hypertension, diabetes, chronic nephritis). The cases in these different classes were then divided into two definite groups according to the need for therapy: the first group was treated by rest and hydrallazine as a single therapeutic agent. In the second group multiple agents were needed because of the arterial hypertension, and one was a beta-blocker. Complications were found particularly in the second group of true toxaemias of pregnancy where unfortunately 5 fetal deaths occurred that were attributable to the severity of the hypertension more than to the beta-blockers, which were administered for longer and in higher doses without major complications in recurrent toxaemias and pre-existing arterial hypertension cases.", 
    "32": "224 patients with coronary heart disease, hypertension, disturbances of cardiac rhythm or hyperkinetic heart syndrome were treated with the cardioselective beta-blocker Talinolol (Cordanum) for a period up to 3 years. In 239 examinations in intravenous or peroral application of this medicament we controlled among others the appearance of side effects. This test was carried out with the help of standardised questionings and clinical controls. Apart from registrations of ECG and blood pressure clinico-chemical investigations were included and in the long-term experiment also tests by dermatologists, otorhinolaryngologists and ophthalmologists. In the total number of patients the proportion of side appearances was 17,6%, in the long-term experiment (100 patients with on an average 12.9 months) 7%. The symptoms most frequently cited in the initial phase, such as fatigue, weakness, insomnia and nausea receded within 4 weeks apart from few exceptions. There did not appear any essential bradycardic disturbances of the cardiac rhythm, just as little were references to disadvantageous reactions in the sense of a practolol syndrome.", 
    "33": "Repeated continuous ambulatory electrocardiography by Holter monitoring was performed after early mobilisation post-myocardial infarction in 100 patients, without ventricular extrasystoles on classical ECG. Frequent ventricular arrhythmias were recorded in 58 p. 100 cases, unrelated to the localisation of the infarct. The observation of ventricular arrhythmias in the Coronary Care Unit (CCU) was not related to the occurrence of VEs during Holter monitoring. On the other hand, VEs were less frequent (38 p. 100 compared to 68 p. 100) in patients taking amiodarone or betablockers on transfer from the CCU. The reduced activity of patients during Holter monitoring minimises the frequency of arrhythmias, and 10 p. 100 patients were observed to have VEs only after exercise tolerance testing. These VEs seem to be a bad prognostic factor; the 9 patients who died in this series all presented VEs on ambulatory monitoring (7) or during exercise tolerance testing (2). However the number of patients with triple vessel disease was greater in the group with VEs on ambulatory monitoring (57 p. 100 compared with 13 p. 100). It is difficult to assess the precise role of the VEs amongst the other risk factors of sudden death. This is not a randomised study, but it would appear that long=term amiodarone or betablockers therapy may influence the medium-term prognosis.", 
    "34": "Characteristic echocardiographic features of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy were recorded in 24 patients, all of whom had asymmetric septal hypertrophy and systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve (SAM) at rest or after pharmacodynamic stimulation. The relationship between outflow tract obstruction and SAM was assessed by comparison with data obtained at cardiac catheterisation and external mechanography: SAM seems to be a non-specific phenomenon and may be recorded in cases of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy without obstruction during pharmacodynamic stimulation. In forms with obstruction, SAM and the severity of obstruction increase with the degree of spetal hypertrophy. The increased contractility of the left ventricular posterior wall appears to be an important factor in the mechanism of SAM which can be prevented by betablockade in moderate or labile forms. When SAM is permanent, whatever the gradient recorded, it is a sign of anatomical deformation of the left ventricle and may be an additional indication for cardiac surgery.", 
    "35": "The cardiovascular changes induced by 15% total body surface area 3 degrees burn have been studied in dogs anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital. The responses observed were a decrease in plasma volume, a decrease in cardiac output, and a slight but insignificant fall in mean arterial blood pressure. Beta adrenergic blockage with propranolol prior to thermal trauma reduced the plasma volume loss, increased the depression of cardiac output, and caused a rise in mean arterial blood pressure. From these results it has been postulated that beta adrenergic stimulation contributes to the plasma volume loss and the slight fall in mean arterial pressure observed following thermal trauma.", 
    "36": "The results of a previous study on protection by propranolol and dicyclohexylamine of alpha-blockade suggested that these compounds potentiated the response of the isolated rat vas deferens to noradrenaline. A number of structural analogues of dicyclohexylamine (DCHA) have now been investigated for their effects on noradrenaline responses and some of them have been shown to potentiate these responses. At concentrations approaching those necessary to achieve maximum potentiation they also brought about the spiked contraction of the vas deferens. The potentiating effects of these amines are discussed together with their relevance to the protection of alpha-blockade.", 
    "37": "The effects of adrenergic beta-stimulating and beta-blocking compounds on tear flow were studied in conscious rabbits with a modified Schirmer technique. The tear flow was significantly increased by the unselective beta-adrenergic agonist isoprenaline and by the selective beta1-agonist H 80/62 (racemic Prenalterol, H\u00e4ssle, Sweden). The effects of the agonists were blocked by the unselective beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (Inderal) and by the selective beta1-antagonist metoprolol (Seloken, Lopressor). The experimental data favoured the hypothesis that the beta-receptors involved in the regulation of the tear flow were of the beta1-type. The anatomical location of these beta-receptors is at present unclear but in vitro experiments performed on the rabbit lacrimal glands indicated that the receptors were probably not located on cholinergic nerve-endings as the release of acetylcholine was not influenced by isoprenaline.", 
    "38": "Studies in normal volunteers documented the positive inotropic effects of Etilefrin-HCL, a direct sympathomimetic drug, with increases of systolic blood pressure, renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. Sodium and potassium excretion as well as serum potassium decreased. After an additional injection of Metoprolol, a beta 1-sympatholytic drug, blood pressure, renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate normalized, whereas electrolyte excretion decreased further. Renin release was decreased during administration of Etilefrin as well as during combined Etilefrin and Metoprolol application. Reziprocal to changes of blood pressure, plasma norepinephrine concentration decreased during Etilefrin and increased during combined administration of Etilefrin and Metoprolol. The results lead to the following interpretation: Changes of blood pressure and renal hemodynamics are mediated by beta 1-adrenergic effects of Etilefrin, whereas the electrolyte excretion is influenced by beta 2-adrenergic effects. Renin release seems to be influenced by beta 1 as well as beta 2-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "39": "The article discusses the results of dynamic echocardiographic examination of 46 patients with chronic ischemic heart disease before and after 15-day treatment with agents capable of blocking beta-receptors: propranolol (anaprilin), pindolol (visken), talinolol (cordan) which were prescribed in mean therapeutical doses. It is shown that agents blocking beta-adrenergic receptors lead to regular decrease in the indices of myocardial contractility. The character of changes in the volumetric characteristics of the left ventricle depends on the initial levels of arterial pressure and the degree of its dynamics during treatment with beta-adrenergic blocking agents. In patients with chronic ischemic heart disease developing against the background of hypertensive disease the dynamics of changes in the volumetric indices depends on the degree of arterial pressure reduction.", 
    "40": "The acute electrophysiologic effects of intravenous Tenormine (0.1 mg/kg body weight), a new cardioselective beta-adrenoreceptor blocking drug, were studied in 18 subjects with estimated normal impulse formation and conduction. The most significant (P less than 0.01) effects were sinus cycle lengthening, depression of intranodal conduction and prolongation of AV node refractory periods. Sinus node recovery time, sinoatrial conduction time and atrial refractory periods were only slightly prolonged (P less than 0.05). Intraatrial conduction and infra-His conduction were unchanged. These properties are compared with those of the most commonly employed beta-blocking agents. The clinical implications are discussed.", 
    "41": "Propanolol use can result in a severe toxic psychosis. In this case, mild perceptual errors progressed eventually to a severe confusional state over a period of 6 months. Life threatening cardiac symptoms forced the continuation of propanolol until the bundle of His was surgically severed. Despite the prolonged delirium, the patient showed complete clearing of sensorium within 2 weeks after cessation of the drug. The differential diagnosis of delirium in the cardiac patient needs to include consideration of propanolol use.", 
    "42": "Sixteen patients with moderate essential hypertension completed a double-blind crossover trial with four treatment periods each of 6 weeks. They received in random order: placebo; tienilic acid 250 mg/day; propranolol 80 mg twice daily; and tienilic acid 250 mg/day combined with propranolol 80 mg twice daily. Average blood-pressure in the lying position was 22.6/13.1 kPa (169/98 mm Hg) on placebo; 21.0/12.5 (157/94) on tienilic aicd; 21.2/12.0 (159/90) on propranolol, and 18.9/11.5 (142/86) on tienilic acid combined with propranolol. The effects of tienilic acid and propranolol on blood-pressure were additive and there were no statistically significant interactions. Tienilic acid significantly reduced serum-urate from 0.33 to 0.18 mmol/l and induced hypokalaemia which was corrected by propranolol. Basophil count and haemoglobin were lower after tienilic acid treatment than they had been at the start of the study.", 
    "43": "Acute administration of 4 mg/kg d-amphetamine in the marmoset results in a large increase in small head movements (checking), an almost total suppression of purposeful activities and social interaction, but little change in the amount of locomotion. Checking behaviour is blocked in a dose dependent manner by 0.03--0.18 mg/kg haloperidol but not by propranolol, aceperone or diazepam, suggesting dopaminergic mediation of this behaviour. The loss of activities and social interaction after amphetamine is not antagonized by any of the drugs used in this study. Locomotion is decreased by haloperidol, propranolol and diazepam in amphetamine treated animals and by haloperidol and aceperone in normal animals.", 
    "44": "Injection of L-Dopa (0.8--200 nmoles) into the perifornical hypothalamus produced a dose-dependent suppression of feeding in hungry rats. This effect was positively correlated in magnitude with the same effect produced by the catecholamine agonists dopamine and epinephrine, and by the catecholamine-releasing drug amphetamine. L-Dopa's action was partially antagonized by separate injections of the dopaminergic blocker haloperidol (58% blockade) and the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol (38% blockade). Combined injections of these two antagonists produced a 90% blockade of L-Dopa's effect. Perifornical administration of the dopa decarboxylase inhibitors Ro 4-4602 and MK-486 was also shown to reverse L-Dopas feeding suppression, at doses that enhanced the effect of injected dopamine and epinephrine. On the basis of these findings, L-Dopa appears to suppress food consumption in part through increased catecholamine synthesis, specifically within dopaminergic and adrenergic neurons of the perifornical hypothalamic region.", 
    "45": "Plasma levels and associated reduction in exercise-induced tachycardia have been examined following the administration of single doses of metoprolol in conventional and slow-release tablets at different times to six healthy male subjects. The study was carried out in two parts. Initially, the tablets were given at 9 a.m. and the subjects were studied up to 14 h and then at 24 h. Subsequently, the same doses were given at 9 p.m. and the subjects were studied 12-24 h after drug administration (i.e. 9 a.m.-9 p.m. the next day). After giving the slow-release tablets the peak plasma levels were significantly lower but the drug persisted in the plasma at higher levels than after the conventional tablet. However, the beta-blocking effect was comparable from the two dosages. The results obtained for the period 12-24 h after the evening dose differed from the corresponding values after morning administration in that the plasma levels were higher and the beta-blocking effects more marked. Furthermore, the half-life values calculated from these data were significantly longer.", 
    "46": "A double-blind, balanced and randomised study in 8 healthy volunteers examined the effects of relatively high versus low single doses of practolol on heart rate and ventilation at rest and during standardised exercise. Practolol 1 and 4 mg/kg, a typically non-selective drug propranolol 0.2 mg/kg, and placebo were given intravenously at weekly intervals. Cardiac beta-adrenoceptor blockade was measured by the reduction in exercise heart rate greater than 160 beats/min, and bronchial beta-adrenoceptor blockade by the reduction in exercise peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) up to 4 h after each treatment. Results were assessed by analysis of co-variance. All three active treatments reduced exercise heart rate markedly, practolol 4 mg/kg causing most reduction. Exercise PEFR was significantly reduced by propranolol 0.2 mg/kg compared with both practolol 1 mg/kg and placebo at all times of measurement, and by practolol 4 mg/kg compared with practolol 1 mg/kg and placebo at most times. Mean plasma concentrations after practolol 4 mg/kg were 3.5 to 4.5 times higher than after 1 mg/kg. Practolol may lose its 'cardioselectivity' and cause airflow obstruction at relatively high plasma concentrations above about 2 microgram/ml.", 
    "47": "Acute coronary bypass surgery was performed in four patients with early anterior myocardial infarction due to severe proximal stenosis of the left anterior descending artery. Improvemnet of left ventricular anteroapical wall contraction was detected at the completion of the operation, in the early postoperative phase, and six to 18 months after surgery. It is concluded that critically ischaemic myocardium was salvaged by revascularization.", 
    "48": "Implantation of a stone in the ureter of the dog by ureterotomy results in focal hyperperistalsis which is accentuated by administration of norepinephrine, and reduced by administration of phenoxybenzamine or isoproterenol. Administration of dipyrone reduces the hyperperistalsis, but this action does not appear to be that of either a beta-agonist of an alpha-antagonist.", 
    "49": "Because alpha-adrenergic stimulation causes bronchoconstriction, the alpha-adrenergic responsiveness of 21 subjects with allergic asthma was compared with that of 16 subjects with allergic rhinitis and 38 normal control subjects. None of the patients had taken medications for at least 30 days before study. Alpha-adrenergic responsiveness was measured by the capacity of phenylephrine to constrict the cutaneous vascular bed and to dilate the pupillary sphincter muscle. Asthmatic subjects required 4.0 +/- 0.6 ng to reduce their cutaneous blood flow by 50 per cent, whereas normal controls required 32.0 +/- 7.5 ng (P less than 0.005) and subjects with allergic rhinitis required 23.7 +/- 9.4 ng (P less than 0.02). The pupils of asthmatic subjects dilated by greater than 0.5 mm in response to 1.8 +/- 0.14 per cent phenylephrine, patients with allergic rhinitis required 2.4 +/- 0.16 (P less than 0.01), and normal controls needed 2.7 +/- 0.07 (P less than 0.00001). Therefore, the patients with allergic asthma had significantly enhanced alpha-adrenergic responses when compared both to normal subjects and patients with allergic rhinitis; the possibility that increased alpha-adrenergic activity contributes to the asthmatic diathesis warrants further exploration.", 
    "50": "It has been shown in male rats of two albino strains, Wistar and Sprague-Dawley, that differences in emotional reactivity were related to physiological differences (Bernet and Denimal, 1978). Particularly the resting heart rate was slower in the more emotionally reactive rats. It has been suggested that emotional reactivity is linked with a certain neurovegetative balance. This possibility was investigated in twelve rats of each strain by means of differential blockade of the autonomic nervous system by atropine and propranolol. The heart rate response of the emotionally reactive strain to propranolol was statistically smaller than that of the non reactive strain. On the other hand, the heart rate increase resulting from atropine treatment was more elevated in the same rats. The calculated sympathetic and parasympathetic tones (as % of intrinsic heart rate) were 8% and 30% respectively in the reactive rats. However, both of the tones were 14% in the non reactive rats. In conclusion, the high defecating rats in the open-field exhibit a lower sympathetic tone linked with a higher parasympathetic tone.", 
    "51": "Intravenous THC, 30--44.8 microgram/kg, was administered to four subjects. Each received THC on four occasions preceded by either i.v. saline, 0.04 mg/kg atropine sulfate, 0.2 mg/kg propranolol, or both drugs together. Heart rates, subjective intoxication and symptom ratings, time productions, and EEG activity were measured. In the absence of autonomic blocking drugs, THC produced characteristic tachycardia, subjective intoxication, and EEG effects. After combined autonomic blockade, THC had no effect on heart rate, while subjective and EEG changes remained as intense. These findings argue against the hypothesis that the subjective and EEG effects of THC are mediated by autonomic receptors or by interoception of peripheral autonomic actions of THC.", 
    "52": "Activation of adenylate cyclase by guanine nucleotide and catecholamines was examined in plasma membranes prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle. The GTP analog, 5'-guanylyl imidodiphosphate caused a time and temperature-dependent activation of the enzyme which was persistent, the Ka was 0.05 microM. 5'-Guanylyl imidodiphosphate binding to the membranes was time and temperature dependent, KD 0.07 microM. Beta adrenergic amines accelerated the rate of 5'-guanylyl imidodiphosphate activation of the enzyme with an order of potency isoproterenol approximately soterenol approximately salbutamol greater than epinephrine greater than norephrine. Catecholamine activation was antagonized by propranolol and the beta2 antagonist butoxamine; the beta1 antagonist practolol was inactive. [3H]Dihydroalprenolol bound to the membranes and binding was antagonized by beta adrenergic agonists with an order of potency similar to the activation of adenylate cyclase and was antagonized by butoxamine but not by practolol. The data are consistent with the idea that adenylate cyclase in skeletal muscle plasma membranes is coupled to adrenergic receptors of the beta2 type.", 
    "53": "4 patients with hypertensive crisis (glomerulonephritis [n = 2], phaeochromocytoma [n = 1], reno-vascular hypertension [n = 1] combined with encephalopathy, showed a normalisation of blood-pressure up to 18 days during angiotensin-II-blockade with saralasin. Prior, blood pressure was treated insufficiently by intravenous diazoxide and Na-nitroprusside. Increased plasma-renin-activity and plasma levels of catecholamines pointed to an activation of the renin-angiotensin- and sympathico-adrenergic system. A trial of therapy with saralasin--especially, if blood-pressure response to diazoxide and sodium-nitroprusside is insufficient--could be indicated. Side-effects like pressor-reactions are excluded by very low priming doses (0,1 microgram/kg/min); rebound-hypertension at the end of the therapy is avoided by an overlapping therapy with renin suppressing drugs (beta-receptor blockers, clonidine, guanfacinum).", 
    "54": "In hypertensive patients physical exercise can induce considerable increases of blood pressure. This means particularly for elder patients a high risk of cardiovascular complications. Therefore we investigated in 13 elder patients suffering from arterial hypertension the effect of a hypotensive combined therapy with a diuretic and a beta-receptorblocker on elevated blood pressures during and after ergometric work. Apart from the reduction of the blood pressure at rest, especially the systolic and diastolic blood pressure during exercise was lowered significantly. In addition to a diuretic hypotensive therapy a beta-receptorblocker can be of great benefit also for elder patients particularly in order to reduce elevated exercise blood pressures."
