    "1": "A young woman with complete heart block died suddenly. Her mother had serological but no clinical evidence of antiphospholipid syndrome. Five brothers of another family had arrhythmia and heart block. Three died suddenly; the other two have automatic defibrillators and are alive. The hearts from the young woman and two of the three brothers who died were available for our histological examination of their cardiac conduction systems. In two of the three hearts, the AV node was absent; in the third heart, only fragments of the AV node remained. In all three hearts, the sinus node was nearly destroyed by a noninflammatory degeneration with no abnormal fibrosis or infiltrate. In each heart, the interatrial and internodal pathways were similarly involved, and in the young woman, there were no myocardial cells in which these pathways normally exist.", 
    "2": "In these three subjects with progressive development of complete heart block and various arrhythmias, all of whom died suddenly, the histological abnormalities of their cardiac conduction systems are best interpreted as resulting from apoptosis. Programmed cell death is a logical explanation for the pathogenesis of this puzzling clinical picture.", 
    "3": "Insulin modulates sympathetic vasoconstriction, but the mechanisms underlying this effect are not completely elucidated. We have recently investigated the insulin effect on the alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenergic vasoconstriction pathway, where it is still conflicting with the possible insulin influence on the beta-adrenergic vasodilator pathway. The aim of the present study was to investigate this issue.", 
    "4": "The study was performed on the forearm of healthy humans, and all test substances were infused into the brachial artery at systemically ineffective rates. In five subjects, we evaluated isoproterenol-induced vasodilation (1, 3, 6, and 9 ng. kg-1. min-1) both under control conditions and during insulin infusion (0.05 mU. kg-1. min-1). In another group of five subjects, we tested whether the vasorelaxant effect of sodium nitroprusside (1, 2, 4, and 8 ng . kg-1 . min-1) was modified by insulin. Moreover, to explore whether the interaction between insulin and forearm beta-adrenergic pathway participates in insulin modulation of sympathetic-evoked vasoconstriction, we measured in six normal subjects the forearm vascular response to lower-body negative pressure under control conditions and during intrabrachial infusion of insulin alone and in combination with a selective beta-adrenergic blocking agent (propranolol 10 micrograms/100 mL per minute). Finally, to verify whether insulin interaction with the beta-adrenergic pathway may also account for insulin modulation of alpha 2-adrenergic vasoconstriction, we assessed the vascular response to a selective alpha 2-adrenergic agonist before and after propranolol administration. Insulin exposure potentiated the vascular responsiveness to isoproterenol but did not affect the vasodilator response to sodium nitroprusside. Furthermore, the insulin-induced attenuation of sympathetic vasoconstriction was partially corrected by propranolol. In contrast, the insulin modulation of alpha 2-adrenergic vasoconstriction was not influenced by beta-adrenergic blockade.", 
    "5": "Taken together, our results suggest that insulin modulation of sympathetic-induced vasoconstriction is carried out through an interaction of the hormone with the pathways of both alpha 2-and beta -adrenergic receptors.", 
    "6": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 plays a central role in the metabolism of many widely used therapeutic drugs including beta-adrenergic antagonists, antiarrhythmics, and tricyclic antidepressants. Recombinant baculoviruses have been constructed containing the full-length human CYP2D6 cDNA and used to express CYP2D6 in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells. High levels of recombinant protein have been produced using either polyhedrin or basic protein promoters (0.05-0.20 nmol/mg cell protein; 0.05-0.15 nmol/liter). The enzyme is catalytically active toward CYP2D6 substrates such as bufuralol and metoprolol. In order to optimize catalytic activity human reductase was coexpressed with CYP2D6 in Sf9 cells; reductase activity was in the region of 1000-1500 units per mg cell protein, while spectrally active CY2D6 was in the range 10-20 pmol/mg cell protein. The K(m) and K(cat) values for bufuralol metabolism were estimated as 4.7 microM and 12.23 min-1, respectively. The use of the conventional very late promoters such as the polyhedrin promoter generate a large proportion of inactive CYP2D6. The problem was to a degree circumvented using the \"late\" basic promoter which is active earlier in the baculovirus infection cycle. The yield of functional CYP2D6 was at least as high as with very late promoters, but the proportion of inactive protein was reduced. Bufuralol hydroxylase activity could be measured directly by HPLC analysis of cell culture media supplemented with bufuralol, and we have developed a plate assay system which provides a simple method for the analysis of drug metabolism reactions using Sf9 cells. Expression using baculovirus provides a valuable source of functional CYP2D6 for work aimed at elucidating the structure and function of the enzyme.", 
    "7": "The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship of four postanesthesia care unit (PACU) cardiovascular events to long-term outcomes (unplanned critical care admission or mortality) and to evaluate the contribution of anesthetic management compared with other perioperative factors in predicting these events.", 
    "8": "For patients admitted to the PACU after receiving general anesthesia (n = 18,380), the risk of long-term outcomes was examined for patients in the PACU with hypertension, tachycardia, bradycardia, or hypotension. Using logistic regression (P < 0.05), risk factors (grouped as patients, surgical, anesthetic, operating room observations, and other PACU observations) for each cardiovascular event were determined. For each factor grouping, the relative contributions to each cardiovascular event were compared using maximum likelihood chi-square analysis.", 
    "9": "Patients in the PACU with hypertension or tachycardia had more unplanned critical care admissions (2.6% and 4.0% vs. 0.2% for patients with no events) and greater mortality (1.9% and 2.3% vs. 0.3% and 0.4%) (P < 0.01). For PACU hypertension (rate 2.0%), age, smoking, renal disease, female gender, and angina were significant risk factors. For PACU tachycardia (0.9%), intraoperative tachycardia and dysrhythmia were the major contributors. Patient factors also increased the risk of bradycardia (2.5%); namely age, ASA physical status 1 or 2, and preoperative beta blocker therapy. For hypotension (2.2%), duration of surgery > 2 h, completion after 6 PM, and gynecologic intraabdominal procedures were significant risk factors. Compared to patient, surgical, intraoperative, or PACU observations, anesthetic factors studied (premedication, induction agent, ventilation, use of opioids) provided only a small contribution in predicting these events.", 
    "10": "Hypertension and tachycardia in the PACU, although infrequent, are associated with increased risk of unplanned critical care admission and mortality.

    "11": "Although a high prevalence of hypertension has been observed in snorers, whether there is a direct link between hypertension and snoring remains controversial. It has recently been demonstrated that an abnormal amount of breathing effort during snoring is responsible for sleep fragmentation even in the absence of sleep apnea syndrome criteria. We hypothesized that sleep fragmentation during snoring may be a direct risk factor for the development of hypertension. On the basis of polysomnographic data, 105 nonapneic patients between 40 and 65 years of age referred for snoring with social impairment were selected and categorized as snorers with (n=55) or without sleep fragmentation (n=50) based on whether the arousals index was 10 or greater or less than 10/h of sleep, respectively. Sleep distribution did not differ between the two groups, except for a longer duration of wake after sleep onset (58 +/- 43 min vs 42 +/- 38 min) and a shorter duration of slow-wave sleep in the group with sleep fragmentation (72 +/- 34 min vs 97 +/- 34 min). Although there were no statistically significant differences between the snorers with and without sleep disruption in terms of age (51.3 +/- 7.7 vs 48.6 +/- 6.0 years), body mass index (26.9 +/- 4.0 vs 27.2 +/- 5.5 kg/m2), sex ratio, respiratory indexes during sleep, daytime sleepiness, and daytime tiredness, prevalence of systemic hypertension was significantly higher in the sleep-fragmented group (20/55 vs 7/50). This significant difference persisted (16/51 vs 6/49) when patients using antihypertensive drugs with possible effects on the CNS were excluded. Our data suggest that sleep fragmentation is common in patients who seek medical help for snoring with social impairment and may play a role in the development of hypertension.", 
    "12": "Some epidemiological aspects of drug-treated intraocular hypertension in Belgium were established in 1992 from questionnaires filled in by 1513 patients who attended a sample of 209 pharmacies open to the public. The mean age of the patients was 67 years (range: 3-95). After standardization for age, the prevalence of diabetes mellitus among patients was found to be 1.7 times higher than in the general population. Family history of glaucoma and/or blindness was reported by 28% of the patients. Beta-blocker eye drops were used by 96% of the sample. An ophthalmologist was consulted more than four times a year by 24% of the patients who had been drug-treated for less than one year; the proportion, however, decreases to 11% for those treated for at least five years. The annual consumed dose of eye drops containing parasympathomimetics, beta-blockers, and epinephrine or dipivefrine was 12.4, 13.6, and 12.3 bottles, respectively, and that of ointments containing parasympathomimetics was 9.9 tubes. From these results and using sales figures, the prevalence of drug-treated intraocular hypertension was found to be 77 per 10,000 inhabitants (95% CI: 31-123).", 
    "13": "Randomized controlled trials are conducted with heterogeneous groups of patients, and the trial results represent an estimate of the average difference in the responses of the treatment groups. Clinicians, however, engage in a process of clinical inquiry, assembling data that will allow an assessment of the appropriate choice of treatment according to more narrowly defined clinical features. We describe a method of clinical inquiry within RCTs that can enhance the applicability of results to clinical decision making. Our methods included the use of data from the Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial, which enrolled 3837 subjects in 31 clinical centers. The 31 centers were divided into 21 dominant centers (mortality rates higher for placebo than propranolol) and 10 divergent centers (higher mortality rates for patients randomized to propranolol). Overall, compared to placebo, propranolol reduced the risk of dying for the \"average\" patient from 9.8 to 7.2%. Results for patients in dominant centers (RR = 0.50) were significantly different from those in divergent centers (RR = 1.33). We identified two cotherapies--aspirin use and coronary artery surgery--that subsequently affected the benefits of propranolol in divergent centers. For patients in divergent centers, propranolol reduced the risk of dying for patients treated with aspirin and/or coronary surgery (RR = 0.39), but not for patients not receiving these therapies (RR = 1.42). We conclude that differences in results across centers of a multicenter RCT may reflect important distinctions in the clinical conditions of enrolled subjects. These distinctions help to identify subgroups of patients in which treatment that has an average overall benefit may be harmful for some patients.", 
    "14": "The beta(3)-adrenergic-stimulated thermogenic response in brown adipose tissue (BAT) is impaired in senescent rats, whereas cold-induced thermogenesis is not. To determine if cold exposure can restore beta(3)-adrenergic receptor responsiveness in senescent rats, we examined BAT mitochondrial GDP binding in young and old rats, and UCP mRNA levels in young rats following stimulation by the beta(3)-adrenergic agonist CGP-12177 with and without prior cold exposure. F-344 male rats were maintained at thermoneutrality or exposed to 8 degrees C for 48 hr, followed by a 24-hr period of rewarming before administration of 0.75 mg/kg CGP-12177 or vehicle solution. During the rewarming period, GDP binding remained elevated but UCP mRNA levels with a half-life of 11 hr returned to levels observed in the thermoneutral controls. In young rats, both cold exposure and administration of the beta(3)-adrenergic agonist to thermoneutral controls increased GDP binding 2-fold and UCP mRNA levels 4-fold. However, in cold-exposed young rats, there was no further increase with beta(3)-agonist treatment. In senescent control rats, CGP-12177 did not increase GDP binding, but cold exposure did. However, in cold-exposed old rats, the beta(3)-agonist was now able to increase GDP binding. The induction of UCP mRNA by CGP-12177 was also investigated and found to be 25% less in senescent compared with young rats. These observations indicate that cold exposure restores the impaired beta(3)-adrenergic signal transduction in BAT from senescent rats. One possibility is that cold exposure induces the synthesis of one or more components in the beta(3)-adrenergic pathway in senescent rats.", 
    "15": "During the last several years, there has been intense worldwide interest concerning the use of skeletal muscle as a form of cardiac assistance. For over 10,000 people in the United States diagnosed each year with irreversible heart failure, the 1-year mortality approaches 50%. This comes despite recent advances in medical therapy, heart transplantation, and the artificial heart program. Because of the limitations of these treatments in terms of effectiveness, cost, and availability, we have used a different approach for cardiac augmentation. Skeletal muscle is shaped into the form of a pumping chamber and then used to aid the function of the failing myocardium. Another approach is cardiomyoplasty, where the latissimus dorsi muscle is wrapped around the heart and stimulated to contract in synchrony with the patient's failing myocardium. More than 500 patients have undergone cardiomyoplasty worldwide. These two areas of investigation represent the principle methods for skeletal muscle cardiac assistance.", 
    "16": "Hemodilution tolerance is not well defined in patients with coronary artery disease receiving beta-adrenergic blockers chronically. Ninety patients scheduled for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery were randomized to a hemodilution (n = 60) and a control group (n = 30). During midazolam-fentanyl anesthesia, hemodynamic variables, ST segment deviation, and O2 consumption were determined prior to and after 6 and 12 mL/kg isovolemic exchange of blood for 6% hydroxyethyl starch. Hemoglobin decreased from 12.6 +/- 0.2 to 9.9 +/- 0.2 g/dL (mean +/- SEM, P < 0.05). With stable filling pressures, cardiac index increased from 2.05 +/- 0.05 to 2.27 +/- 0.05 L.min-1.m-2(P < 0.05) and O2 extraction from 27.4% +/- 0.6% to 31.2% +/- 0.7% (P < 0.05), resulting in stable O2 consumption. No alterations in ST segments were observed in leads II and V5 during hemodilution. Individual increases in cardiac index and O2 extraction were not linearly related to age and left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (P = 0.841, P = 0.799). We conclude that isovolemic hemodilution to a hemoglobin value of 9.9 +/- 0.2 g/dL is well tolerated and fully compensated in patients with coronary artery disease receiving beta-adrenergic blockers chronically. Within the investigated ranges, the compensatory mechanisms during hemodilution are largely independent of age (35-81 yr) and LV ejection fraction (26%-83%).", 
    "17": "We studied the effects of dilazep, K-7259 (a novel derivative of dilazep) and d-propranolol on the change in cell shape and accumulation of nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in isolated rat cardiac myocytes. Myocytes were incubated in a Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing 2 mM diethyltriamine pentaacetic acid (DETAPAC) and 2mM FeSO4 for 10 min, and then treated with 2mM H2O2 for 50 min. Before the treatment with H2O2, the percentage of the number of rod-shaped cells to that of total cells was 66 +/- 2%, and decreased to 35 +/- 3%, 25 +/- 4% and 14 +/- 2%, after 30, 40 and 50 min of the H2O2 treatment, respectively. The levels of NEFA (lauric, myristic, palmitoleic, arachidonic, linoleic, palmitic, oleic and stearic acids) increased after the treatment with H2O2. In the absence of FeSO4 and DETAPAC, however, H2O2 did not have these effects, and therefore all the experiments with drugs were performed in the presence of Fe2SO4 and DETAPAC. K-7259 (30 microM) and d-propranolol (50 microM) attenuated both the changes in cell shape and accumulation of NEFA induced by H2O2, whereas dilazep (30 or 50 microM) did not. N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)glycine (2 mM), an .OH scavenger, inhibited the H2O2-induced changes completely. These results suggest that K-7259 and d-propranolol attenuate the H2O2-induced changes in cell shape and accumulation of NEFA, probably because of their .OH-scavenging effect.", 
    "18": "We used eight adjustable preparations in which the canine atrial tricuspid rings were cut and reconnected electronically by sensing activation on one side of the cut and pacing the other after an adjustable delay. A long delay resulted in a long cycle length (CL) and excitable gap (EG) during reentry. Decreasing delay decreased CL and EG. d-Sotalol (4 mg/l) significantly increased effective refractory period (ERP) and action potential duration with no effects on conduction time during constant 400-msec pacing. During reentry, d-sotalol increased action potential durations more than CLs, so it decreased diastolic intervals. It decreased EG by increasing ERP more than CL. Although d-sotalol increased action potential duration more at longer delays with longer CLs, showing reverse use-dependence, it terminated sustained tachycardias by increasing ERP only for the short delays when the initial EG was short. In 5 of 8 experiments, longer equilibration with d-sotalol produced fixed block at a vulnerable site, so reentry could not be induced at any delays. Fixed block could be transiently reversed by ACh and resolved after washout of d-sotalol. We conclude that d-sotalol terminated reentry by two mechanisms: 1) It terminated sustained reentry by increasing ERP when the initial EG was sufficiently short. 2) In some preparations, it caused fixed block at a vulnerable site, which prevented reentry regardless of the initial EG.", 
    "19": "Oxygen-derived free radicals play a critical role in atherogenesis and reperfusion injury. The present experiment evaluated the effects of carvedilol, a new beta adrenoreceptor blocker with potent free radical-scavenging activity, on myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury in a hypercholesterolemic rabbit model. New Zealand rabbits were fed a normal diet, a high-cholesterol diet, or a high-cholesterol diet supplemented with 1200 ppm carvedilol or propranolol. Eight weeks later, the rabbits were subjected to 60 min of myocardial ischemia followed by 60 min of reperfusion. The nontreated cholesterol-fed animals experienced greater cardiac damage after ischemia and reperfusion than rabbits fed a normal diet (necrosis 51% +/- 4% vs. 28% +/- 3% in the normal-diet group, P < .01). In addition, nontreated cholesterol-fed rabbits showed a significantly decreased vasorelaxant response to ACh in U-46619-precontracted aortic rings (56% +/- 5% vs 90% +/- 3% in the control group, P < .001). Treatment with propranolol neither preserved endothelial function after cholesterol feeding nor reduced neutrophil accumulation in ischemic-reperfused myocardial tissue. Propranolol treatment did significantly decrease HR, pressure-rate index and infarct size (necrosis 33% +/- 4%). Despite their having essentially identical effects on HR and pressure-rate index, carvedilol exerted more profound cardiac protective effects than propranolol (necrosis 19% +/- 3%). Moreover, carvedilol treatment significantly preserved aortic endothelial function and markedly reduced neutrophil accumulation in ischemic-reperfused myocardial tissue. These results indicate that in addition to its beta blocking activity, the antioxidant and endothelial protective activities of carvedilol contributed significantly to its cardiac protective effects after ischemia and reperfusion.",

Serum concentrations of timolol were assayed. Subjects exercised maximally on an upright cycle ergometer four times with ten-day intervals. After baseline testing, subjects were randomly assigned and crossed over in a double-masked manner to two and a half days of treatment with placebo, 0.5% timolol solution, and 0.5% timolol gellan.",

The change from baseline in peak heart rate was -0.1 +/- 7.3 beats/min (P = .92) for placebo, -15.6 +/- 5.6 beats/min (P < .001) for timolol solution, and -11.9 +/- 8.0 beats/min (P < .001) for timolol solution, and -8.5 +/- 7. 5 beats/min (P<.001) for timolol gellan. Pair-wise comparison demonstrated significantly less reduction in both resting (P < .05) and peak heart rate (P < .01) for timolol gellan vs timolol solution.", 
    "23": "Although both treatments caused reductions in testing and peak heart rate, timolol gellan was associated with significantly less reductions. The significant difference in serum concentrations of timolol between the two treatments is strong evidence that the difference in heart rate response was caused by reduced systemic absorption with timolol gellan.", 
    "24": "Cost containment is an important force in medicine today, and there is ample reason to believe that it will soon target the No. 1 health problem for which Americans visit physicians--hypertension. The greatly streamlined (and cost-limited) initial evaluation of hypertensive patients suggested by the latest report of the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure is but one example. Acquisition cost is certainly an important factor in choice of a drug, but it is only one aspect of total cost of care. Limiting pharmacy benefits may produce short-term cost savings but may lead to unanticipated long-term increases in the healthcare budget. Prescribing large numbers of pills or an increased strength to allow pill-splitting and dispensing free medications provided by many pharmaceutical companies are ways some physicians are limiting the cost of antihypertensive drug therapy for patients. More research and sharing of information are necessary before easily generalizable conclusions can be drawn about the long-term pharmacoeconomics of hypertension therapy.", 
    "25": "Prajmaline is not a relatively well known and frequently used antiarrhythmic belonging to Class IA group of antiarrhythmics, which was administered to a young male with metoprolol for the treatment of parasystole. The patient took in 120 mgs prajmaline and 600 mgs metoprolol during the day of the case, which leads to cardiogenic shock, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. The patient's parameters were normalized after successful resuscitation, temporary pacemaker and two days long Dopamin therapy. Therapy was not regarded to be necessary for a few ventricular premature beats detected during a week observation period. The patient is without complaints now, and significant ventricular arrhythmias, or malignant ventricular ectopy hasn't been proved with ECG tests and Holter monitoring for more than three months. Due to adverse effect profile of prajmaline, even at commonly used doses it should be administered carefully and other agents should probably be considered first before beginning long term treatment with prajmaline.",

Electrocoagulation of the rostral arcuate nucleus and median eminence (Arc-ME) of medial basal hypothalamus abolished the rhythmic EEG changes in the PH.

The effects of the separation conditions (pH, concentration and DS of CMBCD) were studied and compared using CE and HPLC.

    "36": "We examined the intracellular mechanisms of substance P-induced superoxide anion (O2-) production in human neutrophils. Addition of substance P (30 microM) caused O2- production and biphasic increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i) (early transient and subsequent sustained components) associated with the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). O2- and [Ca2+]i were assayed by using ferricytochrome C and fura 2-AM, respectively. These responses were abolished by tachykinin NK1 receptor antagonists, [D- Pro9[spiro-gamma-lactam],Leu10,Trp11]physalaemin-(1-11) (GR82334) or [D-Arg1,D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P (spantide), and an intracellular Ca2+ chelator, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA-AM). Inhibition of IP3 formation by GTP-binding protein (G-protein) inactivators such as guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDP beta S) and islet-activating protein (IAP), or a phospholipase C inhibitor, 1-[6-[[17 beta-3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)- trien-17-yl]amino]hexyl]1 H-pyrrole-2,5-dione (U-73122), blocked the substance P-induced O2- production and biphasic increases in [Ca2+]i. An IP3 receptor antagonist, heparin, reduced both the substance P-induced O2- production and the transient increase in [Ca2+]i without any significant effects on the sustained increase in [Ca2+]i. Protein kinase C inhibitors, 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride (H-7) and calphostin C, only slightly suppressed O2- production, and abolished the sustained increase in [Ca2+]i without any significant effects on the transient increase in [Ca2+]i. A Ca2+ entry blocker, nicardipine, completely inhibited the sustained increase in [Ca2+]i without affecting O2- production and the transient increase in [Ca2+]i. These results suggest that the tachykinin NK1 receptor/G-protein-linked IP3 formation with the resulting IP3-induced transient increase in [Ca2+]i is the main signal transduction pathway for substance P-stimulated O2- production in neutrophils.", 
    "37": "Arguments are presented in this commentary to show that the model of temperature-nearly-independent binding that we proposed to rationalize the binding characteristics of beta-adrenergic antagonists (Miklavc et al., Biochem Pharmacol 40: 663-669, 1990) in fact provides a consistent interpretation of the temperature-nearly-independent binding constant in all other systems that have been reported in the literature: in the binding of coenzyme NADH to horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase and to octopine dehydrogenase and in the binding of an inhibitor to acetylcholinesterase No such consistent interpretation has been given thus far for any of these systems. It is characteristic of them that the binding takes place in a hydrophobic, sterically constrained environment. One can assume, therefore, that the underlying entropy-driven binding mechanism would reflect the existence and the properties of the steric bottleneck surrounding the binding pocket. We also explain why the temperature effects characteristic of hydrophobic interactions are not found experimentally in these systems, whereas in other, sometimes even structurally similar, systems such temperature effects are clearly present. Further work in necessary to establish more firmly the key features of the temperature-nearly-independent binding mechanism that has been disclosed through our analysis. The binding mechanism in question not only appears in important biochemical systems, but also has the interesting property of being relative unaffected by smaller structural changes.",

CL 316243 induced a marked increase in both islet blood flow and plasma insulin concentration without changes in whole pancreatic blood flow. This increase was totally prevented when the rats were pretreated with bupranolol, a beta 1, beta 2, beta 3-adrenoceptor antagonist, but not with nadolol, a beta 1, beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist. We conclude that beta 3-adrenoceptor stimulation provokes a marked vasodilatation of microvessels in the islets of Langerhans, which in turn could contribute to the increase in insulin secretion.", 
    "39": "1. The effects of intracoronary bolus infusion of hypertonic saline solution on left circumflex coronary blood flow were examined in sixteen anaesthetized and artificially ventilated pigs whilst preventing changes in heart rate and arterial blood pressure. 2. In fourteen pigs, bolus infusion of 7.5% hypertonic saline solution (2 ml within 30 s) caused a steady-state increase in coronary blood flow without significantly affecting right atrial or left ventricular pressure and its rate of rise (dP/dtmax). Infusing normal saline solution (0.9%) at the same rate and volume in seven pigs did not have this effect. 3. In five pigs, the magnitude and the duration of the response of increase in coronary blood flow were increased in a graded manner by graded increases in the concentration of the hypertonic saline solution between 2.5, 5 and 7.5%. 4. In nine pigs, the response of increase in coronary blood flow to the bolus infusion of hypertonic saline solution was not affected by the blocking agents atropine, propranolol and phentolamine, but it was completely abolished in the same nine pigs by the subsequent intracoronary administration of N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) which blocks the synthesis of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) and in seven pigs by solely giving L-NAME. 5. These results showed that the intracoronary bolus infusion of hypertonic saline solution in anaesthetized pigs caused a coronary vasodilatation which involved mechanisms dependent on the release of EDRF.", 
    "40": "1. To characterize [Ca2+]i signalling in salivary duct cells a procedure was developed for the rapid preparation and isolation of intralobular ducts, some of which had attached intercalated ducts. The isolated ducts retained agonist-induced Ca2+ signalling after permeabilization with streptolysin O (SLO). 2. The improved cell preparation technique was reflected in the repertoire and intensity of agonist responsiveness of the cells. Measurements of [Ca2+]i in intact cells showed that all agonists previously reported to affect electrolyte transport by the submandibular salivary gland (adrenaline, carbachol, isoprenaline and forskolin) mobilized Ca2+ from internal stores and increased Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane. 3. The use of the SLO-permeabilized ducts showed that all agonists, including isoprenaline and forskolin, mobilized Ca2+ exclusively from the inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate (IP3)-sensitive pool. However, in granular ducts only adrenaline mobilized the entire IP3-sensitive pool whereas all other agonists mobilized only part of the pool. 4. All regions of the duct responded to substance P and the luminally secreted agonist ATP. Interestingly, the intercalated duct was most responsive to ATP and demonstrated only a minimal response to all other agonists. The granular region of the same duct and the extralobular duct always responded best to stimulation by adrenaline. 5. The perfused extralobular duct was used to show that adrenaline and carbachol stimulated the duct through the basolateral membrane whereas the receptors for ATP were localized in the luminal membrane of the duct. This suggests the presence of an ATP-dependent positive feedback loop in salivary duct with decreased activity along the ductal tree.", 
    "41": "A murine haematopoietic stem-cell line, B6SUt.EP, responsive to erythropoietin (EPO), has been found to exhibit both early and late changes in diacylglycerol (DAG) and phosphatidic acid (PA) as measured by HPLC and TLC. DAG levels peaked at 5 s with a 28.1% increase compared with control levels (from 17.3 to 22.2 pmol/10(6) cells) with a later peak at 30 min (84.2% increase from 17.3 to 31.9 pmol). These changes were concentration-dependent from 0.025 to 10 units/ml EPO (5 s, EC50=0.82 unit/ml; 30 min, EC50 = 0.10 unit/ml). In addition, PA levels increased 752.3% compared with control levels (from 8.6 to 64.7 micrograms/10(6) cells) with an early peak at 20 s, as measured by both HPLC and TLC (5 s, EC(50)=0.07 unit/ml). G-protein regulation was investigated by studying the effects of the non-hydrolysable GTP analogue guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (GTP[S]) on PA synthesis. The addition of GTP[S] (10 microM) in permeabilized cells increased PA content from 6.3 micrograms to 48.6 micrograms per 10(6) cells. In the presence of EPO and GTP[S], PA levels increased to 64.8 micrograms. An antagonist of G-proteins, guanosine 5'[beta-thio]diphosphate (GDP[S]), had no effect on control levels of PA (5.9 micrograms/10(6) cells) but blocked the effect of EPO on PA (30.6 micrograms/10(6) cells). Thus, EPO stimulated both lipid second messengers, DAG and PA. Our results demonstrate DAG kinetics to be biphasic, as observed with a high concentration of EPO, or monophasic, as observed with low concentrations of EPO. The PA accumulation preceding that of DAG in the slower and sustaining phase suggests that PA was not derived from DAG. This was confirmed by the stimulation of PA (without ATP) by GTP[S], effectively excluding phosphorylation of DAG by DAG kinase in the formation of PA. In addition, phospholipase D (PLD) activation was demonstrated with a maximal increase in phosphatidylethanol at 5 min, suggesting the EPO increases PA via a guanine nucleotide-binding protein coupled to PLD. The temporal relationship of the evolution of PA and DAG is further strengthened by experiments with ethanol and propranolol as inhibitors of the DAG/PA phosphohydrolase reaction and R59022 as an inhibitor of the DAG kinase reaction.", 
    "42": "Analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) provides a non-invasive index of autonomic nervous system activity. HRV has been shown to be reduced in heart failure. Preliminary data indicate that beta blockers improve clinical status in patients with heart failure, but HRV improvement remains to be demonstrated. Fifty-four patients from the randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study were included in the HRV study. The bisoprolol daily dose was 5 mg once daily. We assessed HRV during 24-hour Holter recordings before randomization and after 2 months of treatment. HRV as measured in the time domain by root-mean-square successive differences (rMSSD), the percentage of adjacent RR differences >50 ms (pNN50), and the SD of RR intervals (SDNN), and in the frequency domain by high-frequency (0.16 to 0.40 Hz) and low-frequency (0.04 to 0.15 Hz) power. Most patients were in New York Heart Association functional class III. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 27 +/- 7%, and heart failure was idiopathic or ischemic. After 2 months, the patients receiving bisoprolol had a reduced mean heart rate compared with that in placebo patients (p=0.0004). Bisoprolol increased 24-hour rMSSD (p=0.04) and 24-hour pNN50 (p=0.04), daytime SDNN (p=0.05), and daytime high-frequency power (p=0.03) power. Bisoprolol induced a significant increase in HRV parameters related to parasympathetic activity in heart failure. Increased vagal tone may contribute to the protective effect of beta blockers and may have prognostic implications.", 
    "43": "We assessed the influence of metoprolol on heart rate variability in survivors of remote myocardial infarction. In 43 survivors of myocardial infarction 12 to 18 months previously (26 men and 17 women, aged 38 to 69 years), two 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms were recorded 2 weeks apart. In patients in group A (n=28), who had taken metoprolol for the previous year, the drug was discontinued for 2 weeks, after which the first recording was done. The second recording was done 2 weeks after metoprolol was resumed. In patients in group B (n=15), who had not taken metoprolol for the previous year, it continued to be withheld, and two 24-hour recordings were done 2 weeks apart. In group A, metoprolol increased the time domain variables indicative of enhanced vagal tone; root-mean-square successive difference in normal RR (NN) intervals was 20 +/- 11 ms (mean +/- SD) without and 24 +/- 9 ms with metoprolol (p<0.05), and the proportion of NN that differ by >50 ms (pNN50%) was 3.6 +/- 6.0 without and 5.5 +/- 6.0 with metoprolol (p<0.05). In the frequency domain, the logarithms of the 24-hour very low frequency and the 24-hour high-frequency power (reflecting parasympathetic activity) were increased (5.12 +/- 1.03 and 4.48 +/- 1.51, respectively, without metoprolol; 5.32 +/- 0.99 and 4.83 +/- 1.24, respectively, with metoprolol, p <0.05 for both). Thus, in survivors of remote myocardial infarction, metoprolol enhances parasympathetic cardiac activity in the time and frequency domain measures of heart rate variability.", 
    "44": "The pancreatic beta-cell displays an electrical activity consisting of spike bursts and silent phases at glucose concentrations of about 10 mM. The mechanism of initial depolarization induced by glucose is well defined. However, the mechanism inducing the silent phase has not been fully elucidated. In the present study, the possibility of involvement of ATP-sensitive K+ channels in repolarization was examined using the patch-clamp technique in the cell-attached recording configuration. Ouabain (0.1 mM), an inhibitor of Na+/K+-ATPase, caused a complete suppression of ATP-sensitive K+ channel activity followed by typical biphasic current deflections, which were due to action potentials. The channel activity was also inhibited by removal of K+ from a perifusion solution. Furthermore, the activity of ATP-sensitive K+ channels was markedly inhibited either by replacement of external NaCl with LiCl or by addition of amiloride (0.2 mM), a blocker of Na+/H+ antiport. Addition of L-type Ca2+ channel blockers such as Nifedipine for Mn2+ induced the complete suppression of K+ channel activity. These findings strongly suggest that a fall in ATP consumption results in sustained depolarization, and that the repolarizations interposed between spike-bursts under normal ionic conditions are due to the periodical fall of ATP concentration brought about by periodical acceleration of ATP consumption at Na+/K+-pumps. It is concluded that the elevation of intracellular Na+ concentration as a consequence of accelerated Na+/Ca2+-countertransport during the period of spike-burst enhances ATP consumption, leading to a fall in ATP concentration which is responsible for termination of spike-burst and initiation of repolarization.", 
    "45": "Intracellular free Ca2+ concentration has been shown to be elevated in platelets of patients with essential hypertension. This study was designed to characterize Ca(2+)-pump activity of the platelet membranes (surface and intracellular) in these patients A double-blind study was carried out. Untreated and treated (on beta-blockers) essential hypertensives were studied in comparison with normotensive control subjects. First degree blood relatives of essential hypertensives were also studied. The Ca2+ activation kinetics of the enzyme showed a significant decrease in the Vmax (for the plasma- and intracellular membranes) and Km (for the intracellular membranes) in the essential hypertensive patients. Increased platelet membrane cholesterol content was observed in these patients. Lowered Ca2(+)-efflux by Ca2(+)-ATPase may lead to elevated intracellular free Ca2(+)-levels in platelet of essential hypertensives. A lowered Ca2(+) -ATPase activity may emerge as a marker for essential hypertension.", 
    "46": "An increasing number of studies, both experimental and epidemiologic, have shown that filtering glaucoma surgery has progressively become less effective than initially described. Of a number of risk factors for failure, duration and number of antiglaucoma drugs before surgery seem to play a critical role, and high accumulated antiglaucoma topical treatments significantly reduce success rates. Histopathologic studies have confirmed that topically applied drugs may exert toxic effects to the corneoconjunctival surface and induce chronic infraclinical inflammation, as shown by the presence of immunologic changes and inflammatory infiltrates in multitreated eyes. The origin of topical inflammation has not yet been clearly determined, but benzalkonium chloride, which is used as a preservative in almost all antiglaucoma preparations, has shown strong evidence of toxicity to the ocular surface. A number of questions remain to be investigated, but suppression of preservatives from chronically applied drugs should be a critical issue in the near future.", 
    "47": "Although great progress has been made in defining the spectrum of diseases known as glaucoma, its pathogenesis is still poorly understood. One common element seems to be the rise of intraocular pressure (IOP) beyond physiologic limits. The lowering of the existing IOP is accomplished either pharmacologically or surgically by decreasing the production of aqueous humor or by increasing aqueous humor outflow facility. Quite a number of pharmacologic agents are available to decrease IOP through distinctly different mechanisms. Since these drugs have their own mechanisms of action, some are used in combination in attempts to reduce the IOP to acceptable levels that will stabilize the optic nerve head excavation or the visual fields. In most patients with glaucoma beta-blockers are the treatment of initial choice. However, in almost 50% of these individuals therapy with beta-blockers alone does not reduce IOP adequately. Therefore, there is a need for new classes of topical IOP-lowering agents that can be used alone or in a combination with beta-blockers. This review summarizes the possible perspectives of some of the antiglaucomatous drugs that have been introduced in 1995 as well as those still under clinical investigation.", 
    "48": "Astrocytes possess steroid receptors as well as several enzymes typical of steroid target cells, such as 5 alpha-reductase, which converts testosterone (T) and progesterone (P) into their respective 5 alpha-reduced metabolites, and the 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 alpha-HSD). Because of this, it was deemed of interest to analyze whether the original hormones P and T, and their 5 alpha-reduced metabolites dihydrotestosterone (DHT), 5 alpha-androstan-3 alpha, 17 beta-diol (3 alpha-diol), dihydroprogesterone (DHP) and 5 alpha-pregnan-3 alpha-ol-20-one (THP), might exert some effects on the expression of the most typical astrocytic marker, i.e. the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Cultures of rat type 1 astrocytes were exposed to the various steroids for 2, 6, and 24 h, and the variations of GFAP mRNA were measured by Northern blot analysis. A significant elevation of GFAP mRNA levels was observed after exposure to either P or DHP; the effect of DHP appeared more promptly (at 2 h) than that of P (at 6 h). This result suggests that the effect of P might be linked to its conversion into DHP; this hypothesis has been confirmed by showing that the addition of finasteride (a specific blocker of the 5 alpha-reductase) is able to completely abolish the effect of P. After exposure to DHP or THP, a decrease of GFAP gene expression was observed at later intervals (24 h). In the case of androgens, T and 3 alpha-diol did not change GFAP expression at any time of exposure, while DHT produced a significant decrease of GFAP mRNA only after 24 h of exposure. Taken together, the data indicate that the 5 alpha-reduced metabolites of P and T may modulate the expression of GFAP in type 1 rat astrocytes.",

    "53": "The addictive effects of smoking are only partly known, but it is likely that hemodynamic effects of tobacco smoking may contribute to the habituation. It has since long been known that blood pressure and heart rate increase during smoking. These effects are specifically associated with nicotine while the other components of which more than a thousand have been isolated seem to be of minor importance. The rise in blood pressure is due both to an increase in cardiac output and total peripheral vascular resistance. The blood pressure rise appears immediately and occurs before any increase in circulating catecholamines. In hypertensive patients the blood pressure lowering effect of beta-blockers may be partly abolished by tobacco smoking whereas alpha-receptor blockers seem to maintain the antihypertensive efficacy in smokers. It is a paradox that while smoking acutely increases blood pressure, a slightly lower blood pressure level has been found among smokers than nonsmokers in larger epidemiological studies. Because blood pressure may increase after cessation of smoking, a smoke quitting program should not postpone initiation of antihypertensive treatment in patients otherwise in need of such treatment.", 
    "54": "The purpose of this study was to elucidate likely signal transduction pathways in activated bovine neutrophils, by comparing the effects of various inhibitors on the bovine neutrophil respiratory burst and degranulation in vitro. The protein kinase C(PKC) inhibitors staurosporine, and chelerythine, and the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist DL-propranolol, markedly inhibited opsonized zymosan (OZ) stimulated luminol-dependent chemiluminescence (LDCL). The G-protein inhibitor pertussis toxin (PT), the protein tyrosine inhibitor genistein, and the calcium channel blocker verapamil also reduced LDCL in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, the lipoxygenase inhibitor zileuton had only a slight effect, and the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin had no effect on LDCL. The effects of these inhibitors on degranulation was also examined. Staurosporine, propranolol, and pertussis toxin significantly decreased primary granule (beta-glucosaminidase) release in response to OZ. These inhibitors also significantly reduced both phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-induced primary and secondary granule (lactoferrin) release. Regulation of secondary granule (lactoferrin) release was complex, as it was significantly depressed by propranolol, enhanced by PT and unaffected by staurosporine. These findings suggest that PKC, beta-adrenergic receptors, G-proteins, protein tyrosine kinase(s) and Ca(2+) uptake, may all be involved in some part of the process of bovine neutrophil activation. Moreover, stimulation of LDCL and degranulation may be mediated through distinct signal transduction pathways.",

Pregnancies complicated by this syndrome are associated with poor maternal and fetal outcome. This poses a considerable challenge to the anesthesiologists as many of these patients require emergent Cesarean section. We reported a 30-year-old woman with gestation of 32 wk who sustained Cesarean section under the impression of pregnancy with HELLP syndrome. General anesthesia was performed for this patient. The preoperative evaluation, general management, and intraoperative monitoring system were described. The individual role and use of labetalol and propofol were also discussed in this report.", 
    "56": "The whole-cell patch-clamp method was used to investigate the role of Na/Ca exchange current (INa,Ca) in the shortening action of raised extracellular calcium on the ventricular action potential. Experiments were performed either using BAPTA to buffer intracellular calcium, or by replacing extracellular Na+ with Li- to abolish INa,Ca. A blocker of Ik, compound II. was used to investigate whether changes in this current may also play a role. Raising extracellular calcium from 1.8 mM to 5.0 mM increased the amplitude of the action potential by 8% and decreased its duration (at 90% repolarization, APD90) by 23%. Compound II increased APD90 by 40% and resulted in the appearance of early afterdepolarizations but did not affect the response to raised extracellular calcium. Intracellular BAPTA (20 mM) did not prevent the calcium-induced shortening but did abolish the initial rapid phase of repolarization and increase the inactivation time constant of Icsl recorded under voltage clamp. Replacement of extracellular Na+ with Li+ dramatically shortened the action potential and under these conditions raising extracellular calcium lengthened the action potential. Using a voltage-clamp protocol to mimic an action potential, whole-cell current in the absence and in the presence of Li(+)-replacement was recorded in normal and raised extracellular calcium. The lithium-sensitive current was inward during the \"plateau\" and was reduced by raising extracellular calcium. The results do not support a role for Ik in mediating action potential shortening in raised extracellular calcium. It is suggested that a decrease in inward INa,Ca may be largely responsible, with a role for increased Icsl inactivation in the early part of the action potential.", 
    "57": "Vinylogous (Groups III and V) and acetylenologous (Group IV) analogs of the classical beta-adrenergic agents--stimulants and blockers--were prepared in order to evaluate the effect of degree of saturation, position of unsaturation and rigidity of the chain linking the aromatic ring and the amino containing functional group on biological activity. Derivatives from Group III, which represent 4-aryl-3-butenyl-2-ol-amine analogs of Group II, retained beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist activity albeit substantially less potent (50-200-fold) than that possessed by their aryloxy counterparts. Consistent with the SAR for Group II compounds, substitution at position 2 of the aromatic ring yielded the most potent antagonists (5a, 5d, 5g), with KB's ranging from 73-93 nM while 3,4-dichloro substitution (5e) markedly reduced antagonist potency (KB = 2,400 nM). Agonist activity was also noted for 5b and 5d, suggesting that these compounds may be best classified as partial agonists. Representatives from Groups IV and V were inactive as antagonists at the beta 1-adrenoceptor confirming the importance of the spatial relationship between the hydroxyl and the amino nitrogen.",

    "60": "Previously, we have shown that novel mononuclear-cell-derived factor(s) [molecular weight (MW) < 3,000] stimulate the release of epinephrine (EPI) from adrenal medullary chromaffin cells to levels comparable to that of maximal cholinergic stimulation. The present study provides evidence that the observed bioactivity is due to the action of a single peptide of 627 Da apparent MW. The peptide nature of the bioactive component was suggested by a decreased bioactivity after acid hydrolysis as well as altered bioactivity subsequent to peptidase (carboxypeptidase Y, leucine aminopeptidase) treatment. The bioactive conditioned-medium (CM) peptide(s) were isolated and further characterized using SDS-PAGE analysis. SDS-PAGE separation of G-25 Sephadex purified CM shows that bioactivity resides in a single peptide band. Additional studies revealed that CM also mediates norepinephrine release from sympathetic ganglia cells. Regulation of peptide production was shown to involve negative feedback in that incubation with mononuclear cells with EPI prevented further bioactive peptide release. This feedback inhibition was partially blocked by the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol. These findings suggest a novel and potentially important mechanism by which the immune system can alter neuroendocrine function.", 
    "61": "We analyzed the displacement activity of sarpogrelate and its active metabolite (M-1) in the radiolabeled ligand binding to various 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor subtypes using rat brain cortical membranes. Sarpogrelate was shown to have the same affinity as ritanserin for 5-HT2A receptors, with a Ki value of 8.39 nM. The active metabolite of sarpogrelate, M-1, was more active than sarpogrelate itself and of ritanserin, with a Ki value of 1.70 nM. Both sarpogrelate and M-1 had no affinity for 5-HT1A receptors, but these substances, at a concentration of 10 microM, displaced the specific binding to the 5-HT1B receptors of [125I]iodocyanopindolol, resulting in Ki values of 0.881 and 0.859 microM, respectively. The Ki values of sarpogrelate and M-1 are almost the same as that of ritanserin, a specific 5-HT2 receptor antagonist. Sarpogrelate and M-1, as well as ritanserin, are shown to have very low affinity for 5-HT1B receptors. Both sarpogrelate and M-1 had no affinity for 5-HT3 receptor subtypes. In the 5-HT4 receptor binding experiments, sarpogrelate exhibited almost no affinity, while M-1, at the concentration of 10 microM, displaced the binding activity, resulting in a Ki value of 0.838 microM. Both drugs had a weak antagonistic effect on a 5-HT4 receptor-mediated function, i.e., the 5-HT-induced relaxation of rat isolated esophageal tunica muscularis mucosae. In conclusion, sarpogrelate and M-1 have high affinity for 5-HT2A receptors with a relatively high selectivity.", 
    "62": "The aim of this study was to assess the pharmacokinetics and subsequent pharmacodynamic interaction of MPC-1304, a dihydropyridine Ca2+ antagonist, with other drugs in animal experiments. We measured the systolic blood pressure and heart rate of conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats implanted with battery-operated biotelemetry devices after combined administration of various drugs. Cimetidine (10 mg/kg) did not affect the reduction in systolic blood pressure and the increase in heart rate induced by MPC-1304, whereas it significantly increased the plasma concentration of a metabolite of MPC-1304 (M-1) compared to that detected when MPC-1304 was administered alone. When MPC-1304 was consecutively administered in combination with rifampicin (400 mg/kg) for 9 days, the plasma concentrations of MPC-1304 and of M-1 significantly decreased compared to those found when MPC-1304 alone was given. In spite of these reductions in plasma concentrations, rifampicin did not attenuate the hypotensive action induced by MPC-1304. When prazosin, reserpine, or methyldopa was administered in combination with MPC-1304, the hypotensive action was enhanced as compared to that by MPC-1304 alone or to that by the co-administered drug used alone (prazosin, reserpine, or methyldopa). Quinidine (10 mg/kg) affected neither the hypotensive action induced by MPC-1304 nor the plasma concentrations of MPC-1304 and M-1. These results indicate that cimetidine and rifampicin interact with MPC-1304 pharmacokinetically, without apparently changing the hypotensive action of MPC-1304, whereas quinidine does not affect the metabolism of MPC-1304, and that other hypotensive drugs, such as prazosin, reserpine, and methyldopa, potentiate the hypotensive action of MPC-1304.", 
    "63": "We investigated the influence of hyperthyroidism on relaxant responses of small mesenteric resistance arteries to beta-adrenoceptor agonists and to compounds stimulating the corresponding second-messenger system. Hyperthyroidism was induced by feeding rats for 28 days with 5 mg/kg L-thyroxine (T4)-containing rat chow. This treatment produced a stable hyperthyroid state, as indicated by several biochemical/metabolic and haemodynamic parameters. Preparations of small mesenteric arteries were mounted in an isometric wire myograph. Subsequently, concentration-effect curves were determined for isoproterenol, noradrenaline and salbutamol as well as for forskolin, dibutyryl-cAMP and theophylline. We also determined concentration-effect curves to the beta-adrenoceptor agonists in the presence of ICI 118,551 and CGP 20712A (i.e., in the presence of a selective beta 2- and beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, respectively). Apparent pA2-values were calculated to determine which beta-adrenoceptor subtype causes vasodilation. These experiments indicate that beta-adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilation involves both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors in mesenteric resistance vessels of both hyperthyroid and control rats. In our experiments hyperthyroidism has a sensitizing influence on vascular responses induced by the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol and the selective beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist salbutamol. Sensitization to isoproterenol was abolished in the presence of ICI 118,551, whereas it was emphasized in the presence of CGP 20712A. Although this was not fully supported by the results obtained with noradrenaline, these results indicate that the sensitization to beta-adrenoceptor agonists is probably limited to the beta 2-adrenoceptor/G-protein complex and not associated with alterations of the corresponding second messenger system.",

We assumed that the pair (X, Log Y) has a bivariate normal distribution. The work was motivated by a recent draft from the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the treatment of high blood pressure (FDA, 1990, Draft of the Proposed Guidelines for the Clinical Evaluation of Antihypertensive Drugs). The effect of antihypertensive drugs on blood pressure usually achieves a peak level and then decreases to a trough level before the next dose. The FDA recommended that the ratio of trough-to-peak effects should be at least 0.5. It is well known that trough and peak effects are correlated.",

We defined the following criteria as pathological ST segment changes and as ischaemic episodes [7]: horizontal or down-sloping ST depression of at least 1 mm or elevation of 2 mm of at least 1 min duration measured at the J-point plus 60 ms. To quantify individual levels of ischaemia we used the definition \"ischaemic load\" [3]: ischaemic min/h monitored per patient. The statistic evaluation did not differ from that used in part I.", 
    "67": "Out of 160 patients, 100 could be examined by Holter monitoring. Because of technical problems we could not record a Holter ECG in 2 of 6 patients with reinfarction. We found one or more perioperative episodes of ST-segment depression in 25 patients (25%). Ischaemic episodes were detected in 15 patients preoperatively, in 12 intraoperatively, and in 10 postoperatively. Three patients had ischaemic episodes during all periods. Patients with pathological ST segments suffered significantly more reinfarctions (3 of 25 vs. 1 of 75 patients) and were older (mean age difference 7 years, P < 0.05). Patients with ischaemic episodes and a clinical diagnosis of reinfarction (n = 3) demonstrated a dramatic postoperative increase in ischaemic load. Preoperative use of beta-blocking agents did not influence the incidence of ischaemic events. The sensitivity of postoperative Holter ECG monitoring in the diagnosis of reinfarction was 50%, the specificity 92%.",

    "69": "Patients with a prior myocardial infarction (MI) have a high risk of perioperative reinfarction compared with the normal population (5%-8% vs. 0.1%-0.7%) [10]. According to Rao [13], a reduction of this risk is possible when patients are monitored invasively and all haemodynamic parameters are kept within the physiological range. In most institutions it is not feasible to treat patients as Rao recommended: this would overstrain both hospital structure and financial resources. We studied the incidence of perioperative MI and other cardiac events in patients with prior MI. During the study period the anaesthesia and intensive care methods of our institution were neither changed nor influenced. In addition to this clinical evaluation, we performed perioperative Holter electrocardiographic monitoring and measured serum levels of the recently introduced marker troponin T (parts II and III).", 
    "70": "Institutional informed consent was obtained. The study was planned prospectively. All patients with prior MI (156) and/or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) (4) who were scheduled for elective noncardiac surgery between April 1992 and March 1993 were included. The following information was acquired and tabulated: age, sex, body weight, preoperative risk factors, ASA classification, preoperative blood pressure, pulse rate, and ECG (interpreted by an independent cardiologist), serum electrolytes, haemoglobin, creatine kinase (CK), CKMB faction, creatinine. Preoperative regular medications, type of anaesthesia, type, site, and duration of surgery, and intraoperative haemodynamic changes were documented. The patients were divided into four groups depending on the time interval between MI and surgery (group I: 0-3 months, group II: 3-6 months, group III: > 6 months, group IV silent MI and prior CABG without infarction). We then studied the number of patients who developed a perioperative MI or died of cardiac causes within 7 postoperative days (n = 160). Because of early discharge of 21 patients, we could study the occurrence of cardiac events within 7 postoperative days in 139 patients only. Definitions of perioperative MI included [3]: changes of ST pattern (horizontal ST depression > 0.1 mV or elevation > 0.2 mV) during 30 s and longer; new T-negativation or Q-wave; pathological CKMB fraction (> or = 6% of total CK); and angina pectoris; two of these criteria were required to be positive (WHO). Definitions of cardiac events included: ischaemia: any reversible horizontal depression of the ST segment of more than 0.1 mV or any ST segment rise of more than 0.2 mV. Patients with bundle branch block (BBB) were excluded; angina pectoris: any chest pain that disappered after application of nitroglycerine; arrhythmia: any change from preoperative rhythm or appearence of ventricular premature beats; and left ventricular failure: clinical and radiological signs of ventricular failure. Statistical evaluation of the demographic data was performed by the Kruskall-Wallis test; categoric variables were examined using the chi 2 test and Fisher's exact test. P values of less than 0.05 were considered significant.", 
    "71": "Six of the 160 patients with prior MI developed a perioperative MI (3.8%); 2 of them (33%) died of cardiac causes (3rd and 6th postoperative day). All of these patients were in groups III or IV (interval > 6 months). Forty-two patients had one or more other cardiac events; arrhythmias (22) and ischaemia (14) were most common. Intraoperative hypotension was associated with postoperative MI (5 of 58 vs. 1 of 102). Preoperative congestive heart failure (4 of 18 vs. 3 of 121) and major surgery (7 of 68 vs. 0 of 71) led more often to postoperative left ventricular failure. Patients who received beta-blocking agents preoperatively had significantly fewer ischaemic cardiac events (0 of 28 vs. 14 of 90, 21 patients excluded with BBB) but differed in mean age (67 vs. 71 years).

    "72": "1. The effects of several potassium channel blockers on the action potentials and contractile force of the electrically driven rat right ventricle have been determined. 2. Glibenclamide, which blocks the ATP-sensitive potassium channels, had no effect on the ventricular action potentials or contractile force responses. 3. 4-Aminopyridine, which blocks the Na(+)-activated potassium channels in ventricles, at 0.3-3 mM increased the amplitude and prolonged the action potentials, and also augmented the force responses to cardiac stimulation and to isoprenaline. 4. Clofilium, a selective blocker of the delayed outward rectifying potassium channel, at 0.1 and 0.3 microM prolonged the action potentials. At 0.1 microM, clofilium augmented the cardiac stimulation responses and, at 0.3 microM, clofilium augmented the maximal responses to isoprenaline. At 1 and 3 microM, clofilium had a lesser ability to prolong action potentials and did not alter force responses. 5. Procaine blocks the Na(+)-activated and the delayed outward rectifying potassium channels and, at higher concentrations, sodium channels. Procaine, at 30 microM, prolonged the action potentials and augmented the force responses to isoprenaline, presumably by blocking potassium channels. Procaine, at 1 mM, had no effect on action potentials but reduced the maximal force responses to isoprenaline, probably by blocking sodium channels. 6. Tetraethylammonium blocks the inward rectifying and delayed outward rectifying potassium channels. Tetraethylammonium, at 1 and 3 mM, prolonged the action potentials and augmented all of the force responses; these effects are likely to be predominantly due to blocking the outward rectifying potassium channel. Thus, in the presence of procaine, the effects of tetraethylammonium are predominantly due to the additional blockade of the inward rectifying potassium channel and there were no effects. 7. None of the potassium channel blockers at any of the concentrations tested had arrhythmogenic effects alone or in the presence of isoprenaline. 8. In summary, this study has shown that blockade of the Na(+)-activated and the delayed outward rectifying, but not the ATP-sensitive or inward rectifying, potassium channel is associated with prolongation of the action potentials, augments the contractile force responses, and is not arrhythmogenic on the rat right ventricle. New drugs that block the Na(+)-activated or delayed outward rectifying potassium channel may have potential as positive inotropes in the treatment of heart failure.", 
    "73": "In this study, we quantitate and compare the ability of the 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A (5-HT1A) receptor to modulate the activities of phospholipase C and adenylyl cyclase as a function of receptor concentration. We used a single clonal cell line permanently expressing the human 5-HT1A receptor, and progressively depleted the receptor concentration using an alkylating antagonist (N8-bromoacetyl-N1-3'-(4-indolyloxy)-2'-hydroxypropyl-Z-1,8-diamin o-p-methane, (+-) Pindobind). For serotonin-induced phospholipase C stimulation, reductions in receptor number result in dose-response curves that shift downward and rightward, reflecting both a decreasing maximal effect as well as an increasing ED50. In contrast, depletion of more than 95% of the receptors has no effect on the maximal inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity. Moreover, at all receptor concentrations, the amount of serotonin required to produce half-maximal phospholipase C stimulation is several-fold more than that required to produce half-maximal inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity. We conclude that the 5-HT1A receptor modulates these two pathways differently, and that the overall response to challenge with serotonin, in terms of both phosphatidyl inositol hydrolysis and cyclic AMP production, is dependent upon receptor number.",

Rats were given the compounds for 7 days and clotting activity measured. 3. Propranolol induced changes in coagulation, both alone and in conjunction with ethanol. 4. The data suggest that propranolol plus ethanol induce changes that could be detrimental to hemostasis to a greater degree than propranolol alone.", 
    "75": "The primary objective of this study was to determine the effect of esmolol, administered alone and in combination with lidocaine, on ventricular fibrillation threshold (VFT) in pigs. A secondary objective was to determine the relationship between blood esmolol concentrations and VFT. We determined VFT using a train of electrical stimuli delivered to the right ventricle after eight paced beats at a basic cycle length of 285 ms. Current was increased in 2-mA increments until VF occurred. VFT determinations were performed during administration of esmolol 1,000 mu g/kg/min, during a continuous infusion of lidocaine, and during infusion of esmolol and lidocaine in combination. Mean increases in VFT from baseline during infusion of esmolol and lidocaine alone were 32.3 +/- 12.9 and 8.5 +/- 7.2 mA, respectively (p < 0.05, each drug compared with baseline; p < 0.05, esmolol vs. lidocaine). Mean increase in VFT from baseline during infusion of the combination was 52.0 +/- 22.0 mA (p < 0.05 as compared with baseline and with esmolol or lidocaine alone). The relationship between blood esmolol concentrations and VFT was described by a counterclockwise hysteresis curve, suggesting delay in equilibration of esmolol between blood and site of effect. The antifibrillatory efficacy of esmolol is significantly greater than that of lidocaine in this model. Administration of the two agents in combination resulted in significantly greater antifibrillatory efficacy than that associated with either drug administered alone.", 
    "76": "1. The effects of the selective beta 3-adrenoceptor agonist, BRL 37344 (BRL) on glucose uptake and phosphorylation (i.e. glucose utilization; GU) and glycogen synthesis in rat isolated soleus and extensor digitorium longus (EDL) muscle preparations in vitro were investigated by use of 2-deoxy-[3H]-glucose (GU) and [U-14C]-glucose (glycogen synthesis). 2. Low concentrations of BRL (10(-11)-10(-9) M) significantly increased GU, with maximal increases of 30% in soleus and 24% in EDL at 10(-11) M. Neither the selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, atenolol (10(-8)-10(-6) M), nor the selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, ICI 118551 (10(-8)-10(-6) M) had any effect on the stimulation of GU induced by 10(-11) M BRL. 3. High concentrations of BRL (10(-6)-10(-5) M) caused significant inhibition (up to 30%) of GU in both soleus and EDL muscles. The inhibition of 10(-6) M BRL was blocked completely by 10(-6) and 10(-7) M ICI 118551 in soleus, and by 10(-6)-10(-8) M ICI 118551 in EDL; atenolol (10(-8)-10(6) M) had no effect. 4. Another selective beta 3-adrenoceptor agonist, CL 316,243, also caused a significant stimulation of muscle GU, with maximal increases of 43% at 10(-9) M in soleus and 45% at 10(-10) M in EDL. The stimulation of GU declined with further increases in the concentration of CL 316,243, but no inhibition of GU was seen, even at the highest concentration (10(-5) M) tested. 5. BRL at 10(-5) M inhibited completely insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis in both soleus and EDL, but this inhibitory effect of BRL was abolished by 10(-6) M ICI 118551. BRL at 10(-11) M (with or without 10(-6) M ICI 118551) had no effect on insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis. 6. It is concluded that: (i) low (< nM) concentrations of BRL stimulate GU via an atypical beta-adrenoceptor that is resistant to conventional beta 1-adrenoceptor and beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonists; (ii) the stimulation of GU is negated by the activation of beta 2-adrenoceptors that occurs at higher (> nM) concentrations of BRL; (iii) inhibition of GU via beta 2-adrenoceptor activation is associated with inhibition of glycogen synthesis, possibly due to activation of glycogenolysis; (iv) the opposing effects of beta 2-adrenoceptor and atypical beta-adrenoceptor activation on GU suggest that in skeletal muscle these adrenoceptors are linked to different post-receptor pathways.", 
    "77": "1. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells have been reported to be devoid of 5-HT receptors and have frequently been used as hosts for the expression of cloned 5-HT receptors. Unexpectedly, 5-HT was found to induce profound inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP production in these cells and the aim of this study was to classify the 5-HT receptor involved. 2. In CHO(dhfr-) cells 5-HT was a potent agonist and caused 80-100% inhibition of forskolin stimulated cyclic AMP production. A study using several 5-HT1 receptor agonists revealed the following potencies (p[A50]): RU24969 (9.09 +/- 0.17) > 5-carboxamidotryptamine (8.86 +/- 0.20) > 5-HT (8.07 +/- 0.05) > CP-93,129 (7.74 +/- 0.10) > sumatriptan (5.93 +/- 0.04). All five agonists achieved a similar maximum effect. Irreversible receptor alkylation studies yielded a pKA estimate of 7.04 +/- 0.34 for 5-HT. 3. The 5-HT1A/1B antagonist, (+/-)-cyanopindolol (4-100 nM), caused parallel rightward shifts of the 5-HT concentration-effect curve with no change in asymptote. Schild analysis yielded a pKB estimate of 8.69 +/- 0.09 (Schild slope 1.13 +/- 0.10). (+/-)-Cyanopindolol actually behaved as a partial agonist with an intrinsic activity of 0.2-0.5 and a p[A50] of 8.55. 4. 5-HT (0.01-10 microM) also elicited a concentration-dependent increase in intracellular [Ca2+] in CHO(dhfr-) cells thus demonstrating that dual coupling is not a phenomenon restricted to systems in which there is overexpression of transfected receptors. 5. This agonist and antagonist profile is consistent with the presence of a 5-HT1B receptor. 8-OH-DPAT (1 microM) and renzapride (3 microM) were without effect on forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP production and ketanserin (0.3 microM) did not antagonize the inhibition produced by 5-HT, thus excluding the involvement of 5-HT1A, 5-HT4, and 5-HT2 receptors. 6. The possibility that expression of a 5-HT1B receptor was associated with the dhfr- mutation was excluded since RU24969, 5-HT and CP-93,129 were also potent agonists in unmutated, CHO-K1 cells: p[A50] 9.03 +/- 0.03, 8.34 +/- 0.05, 7.69 +/- 0.07 respectively, and (+/-)-cyanopindolol (0.1 microM) shifted the 5-HT curve to the right and yielded a pA2 estimate of 8.70 +/- 0.06. 7. Little or no specific binding of [3H]-5-HT (0.1-200 nM) or of the high affinity ligand [125I]-iodocyanopindolol (0.01-3 nM) to CHO(dhfr-) cell membranes could be detected. 5-HT also failed to elicit any increase in the binding of [35S]-GTP gamma S to CHO membranes. 8. In conclusion, cultured CHO cells express 5-HT1B receptors which are negatively coupled to adenylyl cyclase and positively coupled to increases in intracellular calcium. The absence of radioligand binding was unexpected in view of the high potency of 5-HT and the partial agonist activity of the normally 'silent' competitive antagonist, (+/-)-cyanopindolol. This implies very efficient receptor-effector coupling of a low density of 5-HT1B receptors. Clearly, the absence of detectable radioligand binding cannot be assumed to mean the absence of receptors capable of eliciting a significant functional response.", 
    "78": "1. Salmeterol is a potent, selective and long acting beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist. In vitro, salmeterol exerts 'reassertion' relaxation of airways smooth muscle. Reassertion relaxation refers to the capacity of salmeterol to cause repeated functional antagonism of induced contraction when airway smooth muscle is intermittently exposed to, then washed free from, beta-adrenoceptor antagonists such as sotalol. The mechanism(s) underlying reassertion relaxation are unknown but may relate to high affinity binding of the long aliphatic side chain of salmeterol to an accessory site, distinct from the agonist recognition site, in or near the beta 2-adrenoceptor (exosite binding hypothesis). 2. In order to test the exosite hypothesis, three pure analogues of salmeterol, each exactly preserving the molecular structure of the aliphatic side chain but with zero or low efficacy at the beta 2-adrenoceptor were synthesized. The effect of pre-incubating guinea-pig tracheal smooth muscle with these analogues on salmeterol-induced reassertion relaxation was determined. 3. Computer Assisted Molecular Modelling of these molecules revealed that each of them exactly preserved the low energy linear conformation of the aliphatic side chain of salmeterol. Measurement of lipophilicity (octanol:water partition coefficient; log P) and direct partition into synthetic membranes (membrane partition coefficient; Kpmem) showed that all compounds had high affinity for lipids and membranes. In particular the biophysical properties of CGP 59162 (log P 1.89, Kpmem 16500) were very similar to salmeterol (log P 1.73, Kpmem 16800). 4. Two of the analogues, CGP 54103 and D 2543 (1 microM), which are structural mimics of the side chain of salmeterol, differing slightly in their length, did not prevent either the initial relaxation induced by salmeterol (0.1 microM) or the reassertion relaxation; however, it was not possible to determine whether either of these molecules occupied the beta 2-adrenoceptor. 5. The third analogue, CGP 59162, which has the substituents on the active saligenin head group of salmeterol in transposed positions, itself exerted a weak beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxation antagonized by ICI 118551 (beta 2-selective antagonist) but not CGP 20712 (beta 1-selective antagonist) and, at higher concentrations CGP 59162 caused reassertion relaxation suggesting that it may occupy and activate the beta 2-adrenoceptor in a manner analogous to salmeterol. 6. CGP 59162, at concentrations up to ten fold molar excess, did not prevent or reduce salmeterol-induced reassertion relaxation. 7. In conclusion these data are not consistent with the existence of a distinct 'exosite' recognising the aliphatic side chain of salmeterol mediating reassertion.", 
    "79": "Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker, is found to induce polyspermy in sea urchin eggs. Unfertilized sea urchin eggs treated for 10 min with 50 microM of propranolol, and then inseminated, become polyspermic and show a fertilization envelope which is barely visible to the light microscope. Examination of treated eggs by transmission and scanning electron microscopy shows that the drug does not alter the cortex of the unfertilized egg. However, after insemination an incomplete cortical reaction occurs. This might well account for both polyspermy and the defective elevation of the fertilization envelope. Since the effects of the drug are reversed by simultaneous treatment with adrenalin, perhaps propranolol interferes with the monoaminergic system that has been proposed to be active. The involvement of the monoaminergic system in the fertilization process is present in the sea urchin egg.", 
    "80": "Dogs with an inherited predisposition to sudden death display ventricular arrhythmias having certain characteristics, such as pause dependence, that are suggestive of early afterdepolarization-induced triggered activity. We hypothesized that alpha-adrenergic stimulation may facilitate the development of these arrhythmias by inducing a reflex bradycardia and by exerting a direct myocardial effect.", 
    "81": "Twenty affected dogs and 7 unaffected dogs were studied. The incidence and severity of ventricular arrhythmias were determined after administration of phenylephrine (0.01 mg/kg IV), with or without pretreatment with propranolol (0.1 to 0.3 mg/kg IV), atropine (0.04 mg/kg IV), or prazosin (0.5 mg/kg IV). Third-degree heart block was induced by AV nodal ablation in 4 affected dogs. Phenylephrine increased ventricular arrhythmias in affected dogs, with or without pretreatment with propranolol, but did not induce ventricular arrhythmias in unaffected dogs. In dogs with intact AV nodal conduction, atropine increased sinus rate, which suppressed baseline and phenylephrine-induced arrhythmias. In dogs with heart block, arrhythmias were increased during baseline and after phenylephrine, with or without pretreatment with atropine. Prazosin and overdrive ventricular pacing suppressed phenylephrine-induced arrhythmias.",

    "83": "The effects of the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol on the locomotor stimulating, neurochemical, and reinforcing effects of cocaine were examined in rats. In Experiment 1, propranolol (1, 3 and 10 mg/kg, IP) produced a dose-dependent increase in the motor stimulant effects of cocaine without affecting basal motor activity. Atenolol, a peripherally restricted beta 1 antagonist, and (+) propranolol, the inactive isomer of propranolol, did not alter cocaine-induced locomotion. In Experiment 2, propranolol was shown to augment significantly the increase in extracellular dopamine content in the nucleus accumbens that accompanies a cocaine challenge. Experiment 3 demonstrated that propranolol produced a dose-dependent decrease in cocaine self-administration. Atenolol (10 mg/kg, IP) reduced cocaine self-administration but to a much lesser extent than propranolol. Experiment 4 demonstrated that coadministration of propranolol and cocaine did not alter the levels of cocaine in the brain and plasma achieved by cocaine administration alone. These data suggest that the blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors potentiates cocaine-induced elevation of dopamine transmission in the nucleus accumbens, which is associated with an increase in cocaine-induced motor activity and a decrease in cocaine self-administration.", 
    "84": "Increasing pathophysiologic evidence indicates that exfoliation syndrome, a systemic process involving various visceral organs, frequently manifests itself first in the eyes as exfoliation of the lens and glaucoma. Exfoliation syndrome occurs when several tissues synthesize an abnormal basement membrane protein. This protein may obstruct the trabecular meshwork in the eye and cause glaucoma. We present a case of exfoliation syndrome associated with angle-closure glaucoma in a 57-year-old male patient from Taiwan. After peripheral iridectomy and topical antiglaucoma medications, intraocular pressure in both eyes was well controlled in the range of 15 to 20 mmHg. The mechanism of the glaucomatous optic neuropathy in this patient was probably caused by chronic angle-closure glaucoma superimposed with the exfoliation syndrome.", 
    "85": "1. The influence of beta 1-, beta 2-, and beta 3-adrenoceptor agonists and of CGP 12177 and cyanopindolol on heart rate and diastolic blood pressure was studied in the pithed rat. 2. The beta 1-adrenoceptor agonist, prenalterol, increased heart rate and the beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, fenoterol, caused a fall in blood pressure. The effect of prenalterol was antagonized by the beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, CGP 20712 0.1 mumol kg-1 and the action of fenoterol was attenuated by the beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, ICI 118551 0.1 mumol kg-1. Both effects were markedly diminished by the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, bupranolol 0.1 mumol kg-1. 3. The non-selective beta-adrenoceptor agonist, isoprenaline, three beta 3-agonists as well as CGP 12177 and cyanopindolol elicited a positive chronotropic effect, exhibiting the following pED delta 60 values (negative log values of the doses increasing heart rate by 60 beats min-1): isoprenaline 10.4, CGP 12177 8.3, cyanopindolol 7.2, BRL 37344 6.9, ZD 2079 5.2 and CL 316243 < 5. 4. CGP 20712 0.1 mumol kg-1, given together with ICI 118551 0.1 mumol kg-1, markedly attenuated the positive chronotropic effect of isoprenaline, BRL 37344, ZD 2079 and CL 316243 without affecting the increase in heart rate produced by CGP 12177 and cyanopindolol. 5. The positive chronotropic effect of CGP 12177 and cyanopindolol was attenuated by CGP 20712, 1 and 10 mumol kg-1 and bupranolol, 10 mumol kg-1 but was not affected by ICI 118551, 10 mumol kg-1. The effect of CGP 12177 was also not changed by BRL 37344 1 mumol kg-1, ZD 2079 10 mumol kg-1, CL 316243 10 mumol kg-1, the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin 1 mumol kg-1 and the 5-hydroxytryptamine 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, ketanserin 3 mumol kg-1. 6. CGP 12177 0.002 mumol kg-1 and cyanopindolol 0.003 mumol kg-1 shifted to the right the dose-response curve of prenalterol for its positive chronotropic effect. The -log values of the doses causing a twofold shift to the right were 9.6 and 9.5, respectively. 7. Isoprenaline 0.00001-0.001 mumol kg-1, BRL 37344 0.01-1 mumol kg-1 and CGP 12177 0.1 mumol kg-1 caused a fall in diastolic blood pressure which was markedly attenuated by combined administration of CGP 20712 and ICI 118551, 0.1 mumol kg-1 each. 8. CGP 12177 0.01 and 0.1 mumol kg-1 and cyanopindolol 1 mumol kg-1 elicited an increase in diastolic blood pressure. CGP 20712, ICI 118551, bupranolol and, in the case of CGP 12177, also BRL 37344, ZD 2079, CL 316243, prazosin and ketanserin did not influence this effect. 9. In conclusion, the positive chronotropic effect of CGP 12177 and cyanopindolol is not mediated via beta 1-, beta 2-, beta 3-, alpha 1-adrenoceptors or 5-HT2A receptors. This effect may involve atypical beta-adrenoceptors, similar or identical to those described by Kaumann (1989) in isolated heart preparations.", 
    "86": "1. The involvement of beta 1-, beta 2- and beta 3-adrenoceptors in the control of lipolysis and nutritive blood flow was investigated in abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue of healthy young adults by use of an in situ microdialysis technique. 2. Dialysis probes were infused either with isoprenaline (non-selective beta-adrenoceptor agonist), CGP 12,177 (selective beta 3-adrenoceptor agonist having beta 1-/beta 2-antagonist properties), dobutamine (selective beta 1-adrenoceptor agonist) or terbutaline (selective beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist). The recovery of each probe used for perfusion was calculated by an in vivo calibration method. The local blood flow was estimated through the measurement of the escape of ethanol infused simultaneously with the drugs included in the probe. 3. Isoprenaline infusion at 0.01 microM had a weak effect while higher concentrations of isoprenaline (0.1 and 1 microM) caused a rapid, sustained and concentration-dependent increase of glycerol outflow; the maximum increase was 306 +/- 34% with 1 microM. Isoprenaline also increased the nutritive blood flow in adipose tissue; a significant effect appeared at 0.1 microM isoprenaline and was greater at 1 microM. 4. CGP 12,177 (10 and 100 microM) increased the glycerol concentration in the dialysate (128 +/- 8 and 149 +/- 12%, respectively) and nutritive blood flow. Terbutaline and dobutamine (100 microM) both provoked rapid and similar increases in glycerol outflow (252 +/- 18 and 249 +/- 18%, respectively). Both, terbutaline and dobutamine increased nutritive blood flow. 5. It is concluded that beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor subtypes are both mainly involved in the mobilization of lipids and in the control of nutritive blood flow. beta 3-Adrenoceptors play a weaker role in the control of lipolysis and nutritive blood flow in human subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue.", 
    "87": "Rats previously starved for 30 h were offered hard chow over a period of 80 min, and the effect of eating on the parotid gland content of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), substance P and neuropeptide Y (NPY) was examined. In rats pretreated with I.P. atropine and alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents, the total amounts of VIP and substance P were reduced after feeding by 23 and 42%, respectively; in contrast the NPY content was not significantly affected. Similarly, in animals given atropine alone the VIP content was reduced by 25% and substance P by 40% after feeding. In the absence of autonomic receptor blockade, there was no loss of parotid neuropeptide content in response to feeding. Neither an intact sympathetic innervation nor a capsaicin-sensitive sensory innervation was a prerequisite for depletion of parotid neuropeptides in the presence of atropine and adrenoceptor blockers. The observed decrease in neuropeptide content is thought to reflect an imbalance between peptide release from nerve terminals and their replenishment by axonal transport, this imbalance resulting from the unusually high demands on the parasympathetic non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic (NANC) mechanism. Under normal conditions salivary peptidergic mechanisms are spared as seen in the absence of autonomic receptor blockade.", 
    "88": "Hypertension poses serious health risks for blacks because this population presents with earlier onset and more severe forms of the disease than do nonblacks. Although diuretics are the cornerstone of antihypertensive therapy In the black population, investigators have expressed concern about adverse metabolic effects, such as hypokalemia, produced by the high doses of diuretics traditionally prescribed for blacks. Recent evidence suggests that black patients may respond equally well to the new generation of cardioselective beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, particularly when these agents are used together with a diuretic. A new low-dose multimechanism agent that combines the cardioselective beta-blocker bisoprolol fumarate with hydrochlorothiazide, a benzothiazine diuretic, is now available for first-line therapy for hypertension. Results of two US multicenter trials--including a subset analysis of black patients--indicate that the once-daily agent is highly effective in reducing diastolic and systolic blood pressure throughout a 24-hour period in both black and nonblack patients. The agent is well tolerated in blacks and non-blacks and has a side-effect profile comparable to placebo. Because of its efficacy and safety in black patients, bisoprolol fumarate/-hydrochlorothiazide is an appropriate therapeutic option for first-line therapy of hypertension in the black population.",

Propranolol and propafenone successfully controlled the ventricular arrhythmias. Follow-up electrocardiograms and Holter records show persistent QT prolongation, bizarre T waves, and intermittent episodes of T wave alternans. On propranolol monotherapy the boy is thriving and completely free of ventricular arrhythmias. In the rare case of long QT syndrome in the neonate, early detection and therapy are mandatory to prevent ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death.", 
    "90": "Effects of clonidine on the elevated arterial diastolic blood pressure induced by infusion of alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonists were studied in pithed rats. Intravenous injection of clonidine resulted in a dose-dependent pressor response at a resting state and a further increase in the moderately elevated diastolic blood pressure induced by infusion of lower doses of phenylephrine and methoxamine. However, clonidine produced a depressor response when diastolic blood pressure was elevated by around 100 mmHg during infusion of higher doses of alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonists. The depressor response to clonidine was dose-dependent at a dose range of 10 to 1000 micrograms/kg. On the other hand, clonidine failed to cause the depressor response while diastolic pressure was elevated by infusion of vasopressin by around 100 mmHg. NG-methyl-L-arginine, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, and propranolol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, did not affect the depressor response to clonidine. After pretreatment with yohimbine, an alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, the depressor response to clonidine was inhibited, but prazosin, an alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, did not suppress the depressor response. These results demonstrate that clonidine specifically depresses the pressor response to alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonists in pithed rats via a mechanism which is not mediated by beta-adrenoceptors and independent of endothelium-dependent relaxing factor, and suggest that a yohimbine-sensitive mechanism may be related to the clonidine effect.",

In both study phases, subjects received oral rac-metoprolol tartrate (200 mg); during one phase, subjects also took quinidine sulfate (100 mg) daily beginning 3 days before the dose of metoprolol. Plasma samples were collected for 12 and 24 hr after the dose in the metoprolol and metoprolol plus quinidine phases, respectively. Metoprolol enantiomer concentrations were determined by chiral HPLC with fluorescence detection.",

During inhibition of CYP2D6-mediated metabolism with quinidine, S-metoprolol areas under the concentration vs. time curves were 2515 +/- 749 and 2719 +/- 742 in White and Black subjects, respectively. Metoprolol elimination half-lives in both groups were approximately doubled by quinidine. Mean S-metoprolol/R-metoprolol ratios were 1.39 in both racial groups during the metoprolol phase, and during the metoprolol plus quinidine phase were 0.89 and 1.03 in White subjects and Black subjects, respectively (p < 0.05, Blacks vs. Whites). The percentage of metoprolol metabolism inhibited by quinidine was similar between Blacks and Whites (e.g., 66 +/- 15% and 64 +/- 25% of S-metoprolol apparent oral clearance in Blacks and Whites, respectively).",

    "95": "Previous studies have shown that bupranolol, a beta-adrenoceptor blocker, is a substrate of cytochrome P4502D6 (CYP2D6). A sensitive in vitro assay was developed to quantify the formation of hydroxybupranolol using HPLC. A TLC method, using radiolabeled bupranolol, was also developed to test the reproducibility of the two methods. Both of them gave virtually identical results; however, the HPLC method was sensitive to 20 pmol and the TLC with radiolabeled substrate to <1 pmol of hydroxybupranolol. The KM value for bupranolol was lower than that reported for any other substrate of CYP2D6. The KM value in microsomes of a typical human liver (L-1) was 0.272 +/- 0.02 (SE) mu M and the Vmax was 360 +/- 10 (SE) pmol/mg/min (0.83 +/- 0.02 pmol/pmol cytochrome P450/min). The KM value for the CYP2D6 expressed in yeast was 0.076 +/- 0.003 (SE) mu M, and the Vmax was 43 +/- 1 (SE) pmol/mg/min (0.64 +/- 0.01 pmol/pmol cytochrome P450/min). Quinidine competitively inhibited the formation of hydroxybupranolol, with Ki values of 5 nM in expressed CYP2D6 and 14.05 nM in human liver (L-1).", 
    "96": "Both stress response and antidepressant drug action may be mediated by beta-adrenergic receptors (beta AR). Since learned helplessness is a stress-induced animal model of depression, beta AR are relevant to investigate in this model. To date, studies have measured changes in total receptor density (RT), but have not examined more detailed aspects of signal transduction mechanisms such as coupling of the receptor to GS protein. We have investigated brain beta AR coupling in the frontal cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus of rats exposed to inescapable shock and then tested for learned helplessness, and in both tested and naive controls using [125I]-iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) as the ligand. Both antagonist-saturation and agonist-displacement experiments were conducted, and the specificity for the beta AR was optimized by excluding ICYP binding to 5HT1B receptors. The percentage receptor density in the high-conformational state (%RH) and the ratio of agonist (isoproterenol) dissociation constant from the receptor in the low-/high-conformational states (KL/KH) were used as indices of coupling to GS protein. No significant differences were found between rats developing learned helplessness and non-helpless rats after inescapable stress in any parameter measured in any brain region. In the frontal cortex, exposure to inescapable shock induced beta AR uncoupling from GS protein as suggested by a low KL/KH ratio both in helpless and non-helpless rats but not in either control group. In the hypothalamus, there were trends for higher RL, RT and KL/KH ratio in helpless rats and stressed controls compared to naive controls. These findings suggest that beta AR binding parameters in frontal cortex, hippocampus or hypothalamus did not differentiate between helpless and non-helpless rats. Changes in beta AR coupling observed in these brain regions may reflect effects of stress, which appeared to be region-specific, rather than stress-induced behavioral depression.",

During 8963 h of continuous ST segment monitoring (mean 42.3 h/patient), 132 episodes of transient myocardial ischaemia (104 silent) were recorded in 32 patients (15%). Forty patients (19%) had an adverse event (cardiac deaths (n = 3), non-fatal myocardial infarction (n = 6) and, emergency revascularisation (n = 31)). Both admission ECG ST depression (P = 0.02), and transient ischaemia (P < 0.001) predicted an increased risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction or death, while no patients with a normal ECG died or had a myocardial infarction. Adverse outcome was predicted by admission ECG ST depression (regardless of severity) (odds ratio (OR) 3.41) (P < 0.001), and maintenance beta blocker treatment (OR 2.95) (P < 0.01). A normal ECG predicted a favourable outcome (OR 0.38) (P = 0.04), while T wave or other ECG changes were not predictive of outcome. Transient ischaemia was the strongest predictor of adverse prognosis (OR 4.61) (P < 0.001), retaining independent predictive value in multivariate analysis (OR 2.94) (P = 0.03), as did maintenance beta blocker treatment (OR 2.85) (P = 0.01) and admission ECG ST depression, which showed a trend towards independent predictive value (OR 2.11) (P = 0.076).",

    "102": "The aim of this study was to compare the effects on left ventricular function and exercise tolerance of a selective beta-antagonist (atenolol) with those of another selective beta 1-antagonist with vasodilator properties (nebivolol) in patients with ischemic left ventricular dysfunction but no overt congestive heart failure. Beta blockers are widely used in ischemic heart disease, but their effects on left ventricular mechanics and exercise tolerance are poorly defined in the subgroup of patients with significant systolic dysfunction but without clinical evidence of ischemia or congestive heart failure. Angiographic and symptom-limited exercise data were obtained at baseline and after an 8-10-week double-blind treatment with placebo (n = 10), 50 mg atenolol daily (n = 10), or 2.5 mg (n = 10) or 5 mg (n = 10) nebivolol daily. When compared to placebo, both atenolol and nebivolol reduced resting heart rate and improved left ventricular ejection fraction (from 33.9 to 39.2% with atenolol and from 36.5 to 40.8% with nebivolol, both P < .05) while lowering mean systolic wall stress. Only nebivolol, however, produced a parallel downward shift of the pressure-volume relationship during early diastolic filling and improved the early peak filling rate when compared to placebo (+ 10%, P < .05). When compared to baseline, maximal exercise duration increased by 7 and 13 seconds with placebo and atenolol, respectively (both NS vs baseline), and increased by 44 seconds with nebivolol (P = .0077 vs baseline). Both atenolol and nebivolol decreased maximal exercise heart rate; the reduction was more pronounced with atenolol. Prolonged beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade leads to a significant increase in left ventricular ejection fraction in patients with ischemic left ventricular dysfunction. The dissociation between the changes in resting left ventricular function and the changes in exercise duration suggests that in this clinical setting, the changes in systolic function may have less impact on functional capacity than an improvement in diastolic distensibility during the rapid filling phase.", 
    "103": "We studied the mechanism of the positive inotropic action of cocaine in isolated guinea pig atria superfused with Tyrode's solution at 31 degrees C while attached to a force transducer to measure peak tension developed, maximum velocity of development of tension, and time to peak tension. Cocaine 2.9 microM enhanced peak tension developed and velocity of development of tension, and prolonged time to peak tension. The increase in peak tension developed produced by cocaine was not affected by propranolol. On the other hand, the cocaine-induced increase in velocity of development of tension was reduced, but not abolished. In the presence of propranolol and phentolamine combined, the cocaine-induced prolongation of time to peak tension was abolished and the increases of both peak tension developed and velocity of development of tension were significantly smaller than those observed in the absence of the two adrenergic blockers. For all practical purposes, nifedipine completely abolished the increase in peak tension developed induced by cocaine. It is concluded that the positive inotropic effect of cocaine in the guinea pig atrial muscle is predominantly the result of adrenergic-dependent, both alpha- and beta- receptor mediated, as well as adrenergic-independent increases in calcium influx through the L-type calcium channels in the sarcolemma.", 
    "104": "Although 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) is known to be involved in the mediation of antinociception from the periaqueductal gray (PAG), its mode of action remains obscure. This investigation uses selective 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist and antagonist drugs in both behavioral and electrophysiological studies on antinociceptive mechanisms of the PAG of rats. Intraspinal administration of 8-hydroxy-dipropylaminotetralin hydrobromide (8-OH-DPAT), a selective 5-HT(1A) agonist, by microdialysis produced a dose-dependent antinociception in the radiant-heat paw withdrawal test. Dorsal horn neuronal activity was recorded extracellularly to test responses to noxious cutaneous stimuli when 8-OH-DPAT was administered iontophoretically, and it was observed that the noxious-evoked responses were inhibited in a current-related manner in all cells examined. The inhibitory effects elicited by 8-OH-DPAT could be selectively blocked by perfusion of the spinal cord with S-(--)-propranolol, a selective 5-HT(1A) antagonist. The antinociception produced by microinjection of morphine into the PAG was significantly attenuated in a dose-related manner by S-(--)-propranolol administered into the spinal cord. Similarly, the inhibition of dorsal horn neuronal responses to cutaneous mechanical stimuli produced by electrical stimulation in the PAG was reduced by S-(--)-propranolol administered into the spinal cord in the majority of cells tested. These data suggest that the release of 5-HT in the dorsal horn by stimulation in the PAG may act directly on spinal 5-HT(1A) receptors, resulting in inhibition of dorsal horn neurons. This is presumably one of the antinociceptive mechanisms of the descending serotonergic inhibitory pathway.", 
    "105": "cAMP and the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) are required in the mossy fiber pathway for both the early and the late phase of long-term potentiation (LTP). Since the CA3 region, which is the target of the mossy fibers, receives extensive noradrenergic innervation, we examined the role of beta-adrenergic receptors in mossy fiber LTP. We found that we could induce an early phase of LTP by pairing isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic receptor agonist, with a weak train, subthreshold for LTP. This LTP was specific to the mossy fiber pathway, was blocked by inhibitors of PKA, and occluded paired-pulse facilitation, suggesting that isoproterenol was acting presynaptically. When isoproterenol was paired with a train that induced only the early phase of LTP, it gave rise to a protein synthesis-dependent late phase. Consistent with these findings, beta-adrenergic antagonists blocked both the late and the early phase of LTP induced by mossy fiber stimulation. Thus, beta-adrenergic receptor modulation is important for both phases of mossy fiber LTP.", 
    "106": "We have previously shown in sheep that pulmonary vascular resistance decreases rapidly after the onset of constant exercise, followed by a slower and smaller second vasodilation. The second phase is partly regulated by alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor activation. We examined the effect of inhaled nitric oxide (NO; 40 ppm) and intravenous nitroglycerin on beta-adrenergic blockade-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction during exercise. In paired studies, we exercised eight sheep at a constant rate of 4 miles per hour for 4 min on a treadmill and measured the hemodynamic response during beta-blockade (propranolol, 1 mg i.v.) with and without 40 ppm inhaled NO or continuous infusion of nitroglycerin (3.2-4.0 micrograms.kg-1.min-1). beta-Blockade resulted in a higher pulmonary vascular resistance during steady-state exercise (40-240 s) than in the unblocked state; reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance during the second phase of exercise was smaller with beta-blockade (13-16%) than with control exercise (26-30%). Inhaled NO and nitroglycerin reversed the beta-blockade-related pulmonary vasoconstriction to the levels of control exercise. Inhaled NO and intravenous nitroglycerin also reversed the pulmonary vasoconstriction produced by intravenous phenylephrine at rest. We conclude that exogenous NO, delivered by gas inhalation or via nitroso compounds, opposes and fully reverses alpha-receptor-activated pulmonary vasoconstriction during exercise in sheep.", 
    "107": "Mechanical responses to noradrenaline (NA) were recorded in longitudinal muscle strips from the terminal and intermediate regions (3-10 cm and 30-40 cm from the ileo-caecal junction, respectively) of the guinea-pig ileum. NA(0.16-1,600 microM) produced a concentration-dependent contraction in the terminal ileum with the EC50 value of 11.9 +/- 4.3 microM (n = 5). In the intermediate ileum, NA produced relaxation at concentrations ranging from 0.016 microM to 1.6 microM. Responses to NA at 16 microM varied among preparations: no noticeable change in tension, a moderate relaxation and a small contraction. At higher concentrations, NA produced contractile responses and their peak tension increased in a concentration-dependent manner. The contractile effect of NA in the terminal ileum remained unaltered after treatment with propranolol (1.4 microM) or yohimbine (1.1 microM), or a combination of these drugs. In the intermediate ileum, the relaxant effect of NA was markedly reduced or abolished by propranolol (1.4 microM). Yohimbine (1.1 microM) had little effect on NA-induced relaxation. The contractile effect of NA in both the terminal ileum and intermediate ileum was inhibited by prazosin (1.1 microM), so that the contractions were converted to relaxation or markedly reduced. Propranolol abolished the relaxant response induced by NA at 0.16 microM, but did not inhibit those induced by NA at 1.6 microM. Methoxamine (0.16-1,600 microM) produced a concentration-dependent contraction in both the terminal ileum and the intermediate ileum. The EC50 was 93.5 +/- 28.5 microM (n = 8) in the terminal ileum and 83.3 +/- 27.7 microM (n = 10) in the intermediate ileum. There was no significant difference between the values. The results showed that NA is capable of producing contraction or relaxation in the longitudinal muscle layer of the terminal and intermediate regions of the guinea-pig ileum. The contraction, which is mediated by alpha 1-adrenoceptors, predominates in the terminal ileum, but relaxation, which is mediated by beta-adrenoceptors and uncharacterized adrenoceptors, predominates in the intermediate ileum.", 
    "108": "The ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) scale has received widespread acceptance for gaining a subjective estimate of work intensity and as a means of monitoring and regulating exercise intensity across a variety of populations. The original premise for the use of the scale was its high correlation with heart rate (HR). Although individual correlations between HR and RPE in individuals on beta-blocker therapy are probably as high as in untreated individuals, there is evidence to suggest that the RPE response is mediated at a given work rate, particularly at higher absolute work rates. The variation in the RPE response appears to be mediated by the type of beta-blocker therapy administered. In the interests of safety it is necessary for the exercise specialist to develop at least a basic understanding of the mechanism and effects of beta-blocker therapy as they relate to exercise prescription. beta-Blocking drugs cause a decrease in HR and cardiac output at rest and during exercise, a decrease in myocardial contractility and a decrease in coronary and muscle blood flow. These effects can initiate premature fatigue and apprehension in the exercising patient. In the light of these responses, the RPE scale provides important information and may be used to increase the accuracy of monitoring and the prescription of exercise intensity in the cardiac population. While results regarding the use and accuracy of the scale during beta-blocker treatment are equivocal, this appears to be due mainly to variations in dosage of the drug, the mode, intensity and duration of exercise and the health status of the individuals used. Overall, the RPE scale appears to be an appropriate monitoring tool, particularly when it is used after a learning period. It is concluded that nonselective beta-blockade therapy increases RPE, particularly localised RPE. This could be attributed to a decreased blood flow and oxygen delivery to the muscle and altered glycolytic metabolism, which increases local muscle fatigue. There is no evidence to suggest a decrease in the total level of oxygen consumption at given work rates. However, as beta-blocker therapy reduces the maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) attainable, this serves to increase the exercise intensity at all work rates. Thus, for a given absolute work rate, the RPE response is higher. However, when the work rate is expressed as a proportion of the VO2max attainable during beta-blockade, the differences in RPE are minimised or disappear. Although the evidence is not conclusive, it appears that cardioselective beta-blocker therapy does not have such profound effects on the RPE response, compared with nonselective beta-blocker therapy, when this is expressed as a proportion of VO2max. However, localised RPE tends to be higher for nonselective beta-blocker therapy. Thus, the evidence indicates that RPE can be used to estimate exercise intensity, provided the specific effects of the type of beta-blocker therapy on local and central fatigue (and local and central RPE) are taken into account. Studies which have examined the effects of an endurance training programme during beta-blocker therapy have shown that RPE are decreased at given work rates after training. This has been observed for cardioselective and nonselective beta-blocker therapy, and local and central RPE. There is also some evidence to suggest that the RPE can be used as the controlling variable to regulate the exercise response. Patients on cardioselective beta-blocker therapy produce similar exercise intensities to other cardiac patients who are not receiving beta-blocker treatment.", 
    "109": "The existence of a functional beta 3-adrenoceptor in conscious 24 h fasted rabbits was investigated by studying the effect of BRL 37344 (a beta 3-adrenoceptor agonist) in comparison with CGP 12177 (a beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, which also acts as a partial beta 3 agonist) and isoproterenol (a nonselective beta 1-, beta 2-, and beta 3-adrenoceptor agonist) on plasma nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) and its possible relation with glucose metabolism. All drugs were intravenously infused at the same dose, 0.3 microgram.kg-1.min-1 (30 min), BRL 37344, CGP 12177, and isoproterenol significantly elevated plasma NEFA levels without increasing plasma glucose levels. Isoproterenol elevated plasma insulin and lactate levels, but BRL 37344 and CGP 12177 did not. Bupranolol (0.1 mg/kg, subcutaneously) blocked the BRL 37344 mediated effect on plasma NEFA levels. In the presence of CGP 20712A (1 mg/kg, subcutaneously), ICI 118551 (30 micrograms/kg, subcutaneously), or the mixture of both selective beta-antagonists, BRL 37344 also evoked an increase in plasma NEFA levels, but the response was less pronounced when compared with BRL 37344 alone. These data suggest that in conscious rabbits deprived of food for 24 h (i) BRL 37344 induces lipomobilization through beta 3-adrenoceptor stimuli, but the effect is less than by beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor stimuli, and (ii) an excess of plasma NEFA evoked by BRL 37344 may not necessarily contribute to plasma glucose increases.",

Unfortunately, in fact, most of data in the field comes from experiments on rats. Thus, we examined DNA synthesis of hepatocytes from mice cultivated in presence of neonatal calf serum only, or after the addition of the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol or the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol. DNA synthesis in hepatocytes from young Balb/c-nu mice shows a peak between 36 and 48 h even in the absence of any specific stimulation other than newborn calf serum.

Three drugs with class III antiarrhythmic activity, almokalant, dofetilide and d-sotalol, were compared in vitro using rat embryo culture. Each of these drugs caused a concentration-dependent bradycardia in 11- or 13-day rat embryos. For each drug the effective concentration was considerably greater than the human therapeutic plasma concentration. The reproductive outcome was also compared in vivo in Sprague-Dawley rats by oral administration of almokalant or dofetilide on single days during the organogenic period. Both drugs caused increased resorptions and the same stage-dependent malformations. Dosing on gestational day (GD) 11 was associated with right-sided oblique cleft lip and short tail, while dosing on day 13 caused digital hypoplasia and/or amputation. Susceptibility to these drugs started on GD 9 when the embryonic heart starts beating and ended on GD 15. The malformations were preceded by hemorrhage; which is consistent with the proposed pathogenesis that the drug-induced bradycardia caused embryonic hypoxia/ischemia. This study indicates that the induction of malformations/embryonic death by class III antiarrhythmic drugs which inhibit Ikr is a class effect secondary to a common pharmacological action on the embryonic heart.", 
    "124": "The cellular mechanisms of cardiac hypertrophy are still largely unknown. In-vivo studies have demonstrated that antihypertensive drugs can regress hypertrophy independently of reductions in blood pressure. The antihypertrophic effects of metoprolol, propranolol, felodipine, verapamil and captopril were studied in neonatal cardiac myocyte culture. Prazosin was used as a positive control. Hypertrophy was defined as an increase in protein content measured by [3H]leucine incorporation. Noradrenaline induced a 1.5-fold increase in protein synthesis over 48 h. Prazosin prevented the hypertrophic effect of noradrenaline. Adrenergic beta-receptor blocking agents and calcium antagonists reduced myocyte hypertrophy in a dose-dependent manner. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril was ineffective. These results indicate that adrenergic beta-receptor blockers and calcium antagonists may have direct nonhaemodynamic effects on the growth of cultured cardiac myocytes.", 
    "125": "The effects of bromadryl, dithiaden, chloroquine and propranolol on thrombin-stimulated rat platelet aggregation (measured turbidimetrically) and thromboxane B2 generation (detected by an RIA method) were compared with four selected physico-chemical parameters of these drugs. Platelet aggregation was inhibited in the rank order of potency: bromadryl > dithiaden > propranolol > chloroquine, which corresponded with the decrease in the net charge of the terminal methyl-(or ethyl-) groups in the side chain and with the increase of the dipole moment of drug molecules. On the other hand, the rank order of potency in which the drugs tested inhibited thromboxane B2 formation (chloroquine > dithiaden > bromadryl > propranolol) correlated well with the decline in molar refractivity of the drugs. No relationship was found between inhibitory effects of drugs and their partition coefficients. The results presented indicate that inhibition of platelet functions might consist of several types of drug-cell interactions, depend on the structure and physico-chemical properties of the drugs and cannot be estimated simply on the basis of partition coefficients.", 
    "126": "Haloperidol (HPD) is a dopamine receptor blocker and a major causative agent of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. To investigate the influence of HPD on immune responsiveness, the natural killer (NK) cell activity of mice was examined after intraperitoneal administration of HPD for 5 days. NK cell activity was markedly decreased without a depletion of NK cells. Bromocriptine (BROMO), which is used for the treatment of neuroleptic malignant syndrome, also decreased NK cell activity. The suppressive effect on NK cell activity was inhibited by injecting both HPD and BROMO simultaneously. Serum levels of prolactin (PRL) decreased after BROMO injection, although serum PRL level was not decreased after the combined administration of HPD and BROMO agents. The reduction of NK cell activity caused by BROMO and by HPD was prevented by the co-injection of PRL and by a beta-adrenergic blocker, respectively. These results indicate that HPD decreases NK cell activity in a PRL-independent manner and that BROMO decreases it via PRL reduction. It seems that the PRL-independent suppressive effect of HPD on NK cells, which is neutralized by BROMO, is mediated by splenic sympathetic function via the beta-adrenergic receptor system. Therefore, BROMO helps to alleviate the depressed NK cell activity caused by HPD therapy.", 
    "127": "The increased viscosity of blood of hypertensive patients can be assumed to be a risk factor for the development of cardiovascular diseases. The aim of the present study was to elucidate whether anti-hypertensive treatment has any impact on blood rheology. Twenty patients with previously untreated hypertension who consecutively attended our outpatient hypertension clinic were included in this prospective, open, cross-over study. The patients were randomly selected to treatment with amlodipine or metoprolol. The anti-hypertensive therapy was switched after 4 months. Haemorheological and haemodynamic variables were measured with rotational viscometry and impedance cardiography, respectively. Fifteen and 16 patients could be evaluated after amlodipine or metoprolol treatment respectively. The mean blood pressure (BP) decreased from 159 +/- 22/105 +/- 7 to 139 +/- 21/91 +/- 6 mm Hg on amlodipine and from 162 +/- 22/104 +/- 5 to 145 +/- 24/90 +/- 8 mm Hg on metoprolol therapy. After amlodipine treatment, the total peripheral resistance index decreased whereas metoprolol treatment was accompanied by a decrease in the cardiac index. Decreases in whole blood viscosity, haematocrit and serum erythropoietin were found after amlodipine as well as metoprolol treatment. After amlodipine the plasma viscosity decreased and the erythrocyte deformability increased in the majority of patients. Plasma fibrinogen decreased after metoprolol treatment. Despite the differences in haemodynamic mechanisms underlying the decrease in BP, amlodipine and metoprolol exert beneficial effects on blood viscosity. Haemodilution and a decrease in serum erythropoietin may be factors underlying this decrease in blood viscosity.", 
    "128": "This study examines the effects of antihypertensive therapy on platelet cytosolic calcium [Ca2+]i responses to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) and vasopressin (AVP) in 15 patients (50-80 years) participating in the Hypertension Optimal Treatment International Study. All patients (diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > or = 100 mm Hg and < or = 115 mm Hg) were treated with the calcium antagonist felodipine (10 mg p.o.) with or without addition of enalapril (up to 20 mg daily as needed) to lower diastolic pressures to < 85 mm Hg. This antihypertensive therapy lowered DBP (104 +/- 0.8 to 78 +/- 1.6 mm Hg, P < 0.0001), but had no effect on basal [Ca2+]i or AVP-stimulated [Ca2+]i responses. Basal platelet [Ca2+]i following antihypertensive therapy (49 +/- 3.4 ng/ml) were not different from those prior to therapy (52 +/- 4.7 ng/ml). Additionally, [Ca2+]i responses to AVP following therapy (554 +/- 74 units) were not different from those prior to treatment (595 +/- 49 units). Following antihypertensive therapy, [Ca2+]i responses to 200 micrograms/ml of LDL were decreased fourfold (P < 0.05). These results suggest that antihypertensive therapy with a calcium channel blocker may potentially impact the atherogenic process by reducing the platelet [Ca2+]i rise, and potentially the aggregatory response, to LDL.", 
    "129": "Given that an important proportion of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) fail to respond adequately to serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SRI), augmentation strategies aimed at enhancing further 5-HT transmission by different mechanisms were attempted sequentially in 13 SRI-resistant patients. Addition of the 5-HT1A l beta-adrenergic antagonist pindolol did not alter OCD symptomatology but produced a rapid improvement of depressive symptoms. The 5-HT1A agonist buspirone as well as 5-hydroxytryptophan, the immediate precursor of 5-HT, added to the SRI-pindolol regimen, were not effective in attenuating the intensity of OCD. Tryptophan, added to the SRI-pindolol regimen, produced a significant improvement after 4 weeks, with further amelioration after 6 weeks (36% decrease of the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Score), which was maintained with treatment prolongation.", 
    "130": "We report the case of a patient who developed jaundice, encephalopathy, a marked increase in serum aminotransferase activity and a decrease in prothrombin and proaccelerin levels, after 6 weeks' treatment with carbimazole and propranolol for hyperthyroidism. The patient ultimately underwent orthotopic liver transplantation. This case strongly suggests that carbimazole may occasionally induce fulminant hepatitis and that careful monitoring of liver enzymes may be useful during the treatment of hyperthyroidism with this drug.", 
    "131": "Previous reports, based on clinical trials and animal experiments, suggest that beta-blockers may be useful in the prevention of atherosclerosis. Betaxolol, a new beta1-selective blocker, was shown to decrease plasma total and LDL cholesterol levels or to have no adverse effect on those [1-4]. While many reports deal with metabolism of triglyceride and high density lipoprotein, fewer publications about cholesterol metabolism are currently available. To clarify the mechanism by which beta-blockers affect lipid metabolism, we examined the effects of beta-blockers on HMG CoA reductase and LDL receptor activity in cultured human skin fibroblasts. L-propranolol, a nonselective beta-blocker, increased HMG CoA reductase activity and decreased LDL receptor activity. However, d-propranolol had no major effects on HMG CoA reductase activity. These results suggest that beta-blockers act on HMG CoA reductase through the beta receptors. Beta1-blocking action should decrease HMG CoA reductase activity and increase LDL receptor activity. In fact, betaxolol, a beta1-selective blocker, decreased HMG CoA reductase activity and increased LDL receptor activity, but metoprolol had no major effect. We speculate that the discrepancy between betaxolol and metoprolol in the effect on HMG CoA reductase and the LDL receptor might be due to the difference of the extent of beta1-selectivity. We conclude that beta1-selective blockers are antihypertensive agents potentially valuable in the prevention of atherosclerosis.", 
    "132": "Tilisolol is a beta-blocking agent with vasodilatory properties that was recently shown to possess a potassium (K+) channel opening activity. We investigated whether tilisolol has vasodilatory effects on coronary circulation in dogs. Mongrel dogs were chronically instrumented for measurements of circumflex coronary artery diameter (CoD) and coronary blood flow (CBF). We compared the effects of tilisolol on dog coronary arteries with those of two beta-blockers, propranolol and arotinolol. Both propranolol (1 mg/kg, intravenously, i.v.) and arotinolol (0.25 mg/kg, i.v.) decreased CoD and increased coronary vascular resistance (CVR). Tilisolol (2 mg/kg, i.v.) decreased CVR but had no significant effect on CoD. To investigate the mechanism of the coronary action of tilisolol, we examined differences in the response to tilisolol in the absence and presence of glibenclamide, an ATP-sensitive K+ channel blocker. Tilisolol (1,2,4, and 8 mg/kg, i.v.) produced a dose-dependent decrease in CVR without glibenclamide, whereas pretreatment with glibenclamide significantly suppressed this effect. Without glibenclamide, tilisolol had no significant effect on CoD at doses of 1-4 mg/kg (i.v.). However, at the higher dose of 8 mg/kg (i.v.), tilisolol significantly increased CoD (1.00 +/- 0.15%, p < 0.01). After pretreatment with glibenclamide, tilisolol (1-8 mg/kg, i.v.) produced a significant decrease in CoD. Therefore, we concluded that tilisolol exerts its vasodilatory effect on the coronary circulation through an ATP-sensitive K+ channel opening mechanism, and that its vasodilatory action is more prominent in coronary resistance vessels than in large coronary arteries.", 
    "133": "A 73-year-old woman with cardiac dysfunction had several episodes of severe bradycardia and pulmonary oedema when waiting for peripheral vascular surgery. She used timolol eye drops for primary open-angle glaucoma. The first episode of pulmonary oedema occurred two weeks prior to and the second on the day before the planned surgery. There were another two episodes of pulmonary oedema before she was transferred to the Department of Internal Medicine where she had a further two episodes of cardiac failure. After changing timolol to pilocarpine eye drops, the patient's condition was stabilized, and two weeks later surgery and postoperative recovery were uneventful.", 
    "134": "Depression of myocardial contractility by muscarinic stimulation is dependent on the underlying beta-adrenergic tone. Prior beta-adrenergic stimulation enhances muscarinic negative inotropic responses, an effect that has been termed accentuated antagonism. The purpose of this study was to determine whether accentuated antagonism occurs with myocardial depression caused by thiopental or ketamine.", 
    "135": "Using an isolated, electrically stimulated rat left afrium model, the dose-response curves to the muscarinic agonist carbachol and the anesthetics ketamine and thiopental were compared under conditions of high (10(-6)M isoproterenol bath concentration) or low (10(-6)M propranolol) beta-adrenergic tone.", 
    "136": "As expected, depression by carbachol was accentuated in preparations stimulated with isoproterenol compared with atria treated with propranolol. The decrease in tension by high doses (> 400 muM thiopental, > 200 muM ketamine) of thiopental or ketamine was attenuated in isoproterenol-stimulated tissue when compared with beta-adrenergic blocked muscle. Low concentrations (200 muM thiopental, 100 muM ketamine) of anesthetic caused either no change in contractility (thiopental) or small positive inotropic responses (ketamine) in pro-pranolol-treated but not isoproterenol-stimulated tissue. CONCLUSIONS. In contrast to muscarinic agonists, myocardial depression by high concentrations of ketamine or thiopental is attenuated by prior beta-adrenergic stimulation. Positive inotropic responses may be seen with low concentrations of ketamine in muscle with low beta-adrenergic tone. The results of this study demonstrate that the underlying beta-adrenergic tone greatly influences the in vitro response of cardiac tissue to ketamine or thiopental.", 
    "137": "Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the lower respiratory tract which is triggered by exposure to allergens or other airway irritants, and is commonly encountered in otolaryngologic practice. This three-part review is designed to assist otolaryngologists in effectively managing their asthmatic patients. In Part I, current information on the pathophysiology and increasing prevalence of asthma, its clinical variability, the assessment of asthma severity and methods for diagnosis of asthma were summarized. Part II discusses a tripartite strategy for asthma management, based on environmental controls, the use of anti-inflammatory therapies and patient education. In addition, pharmacologic treatments which are not primarily anti-inflammatory are reviewed in detail. The uses, effectiveness, side effects and suitability for drug combination therapy for mucolytic, anticholinergic, antihistamine, theophylline and beta agonist drugs are compared, and the disadvantages of beta antagonists are summarized. Part III concludes with an overview of anti-inflammatory therapies for asthma control."
