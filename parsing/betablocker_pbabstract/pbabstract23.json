Claims data (2008 to 2012) were analyzed using a commercial database. Patients with CSA receiving a \u03b2 blocker (BB), calcium channel blocker (CCB), long-acting nitrate (LAN), or ranolazine were identified and followed for 12 months after a change in AA therapy. Patients on traditional AA medications were required to have concurrent sublingual nitroglycerin. Therapy change was defined as adding or switching to another traditional AA medication or ranolazine to identify patients whose angina was inadequately controlled with previous therapy. Four groups were identified (BB, CCB, LAN, or ranolazine users) and matched on relevant characteristics. A DM subset was identified. Logistic regression compared revascularization at 30, 60, 90, 180, and 360 days. Negative binomial regression compared all-cause, CV-, and DM-related (in the DM cohort) health care utilization. A total of 8,008 patients were identified with 2,002 patients in each matched group. Majority were men (mean age 66 years). A subset of 3,724 patients with DM (BB, n = 933; CCB, n = 940; LAN, n = 937; and ranolazine, n = 914) resulted from this cohort. Compared to ranolazine in the overall cohort, traditional AA medication exhibited greater odds for revascularization and higher rates in all-cause outpatient, emergency room visits, inpatient length of stay, and CV-related emergency room visits. In the DM cohort, ranolazine demonstrated similar benefits over traditional AA medication. In conclusion, ranolazine use in patients with inadequately controlled chronic angina is associated with less revascularization and all-cause and CV-related health care utilization compared to traditional AA medication.",

The aim of the present study was to further develop existing models of migraine making them more suitable for testing the effects of compounds with presumed antimigraine activity in anaesthetised rats. Simultaneous recording of ongoing activity of spontaneously active neurons in the trigeminocervical complex as well as their discharges evoked by electrical stimulation of the dura mater via activation of A- and C-sensory fibres were carried out. Effects of sumatriptan, propranolol and topiramate were evaluated prior to and after application of a mixture containing inflammatory mediators on the dura. Propranolol (10 mg/kg s.c) and topiramate (30 mg/kg s.c.) resulted in a tendency to decrease the level of both spontaneous and evoked activity, while sumatriptan (1 mg/kg s.c.) did not exhibit any effect on recorded parameters. Application of an inflammatory soup to the dura mater boosted up spontaneous activity, which could be significantly attenuated by propranolol and topiramate but not by sumatriptan. In addition, all compounds prevented the delayed increase of spontaneous firing. In contrast to the ongoing activity, evoked responses were not augmented by inflammatory mediators. Nevertheless, inhibitory effect of propranolol and topiramate was evident when considering A- or C-fibre responses. Findings do not support the view that electrically evoked responses are useful for the measurement of trigeminal sensitization. It is proposed however, that inhibition of enhanced firing (immediate and/or delayed) evoked by inflammatory mediators as an endpoint have higher predictive validity regarding the clinical effectiveness of compounds.",

The purpose of this study is to investigate the association between usage of different antihypertensive drugs and the development of NOD in female patients with hypertension and CAD.Data in this retrospective cohort study were obtained from claim forms submitted to the Taiwan Bureau of National Health Insurance in central Taiwan during the period 2006-2011. We estimated the odds ratios (OR) to approximate the relative risk of NOD development associated with antihypertensive drug use.Of the 20,108 female patients with CAD at baseline, 2288 patients developed NOD during the 6-year follow-up. Subjects treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (OR, 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84-1.00), angiotensin receptor blockers (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.82-0.99), and alpha-blockers (OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.79-0.98) in the adjusted analyses had greater reductions of the risk than among nonusers. Patients who took diuretics (OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.01-1.20), beta-blockers (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.04-1.21), and calcium channel blockers (OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.02-1.18) were at high risk of developing NOD than nonusers. Vasodilators were not associated with risk of NOD.We conclude that women with hypertension who take ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and alpha-blockers are at lower risk of NOD and that use of diuretics, beta-blockers, and calcium channel blockers was associated with a significantly increased risk of developing NOD during the 6-year follow-up.",

Available therapies, which decrease the common causal risk factor of elevated intraocular pressure, delay, but cannot prevent, RGC death and blindness. Notably, it is changes in the anterior segment of the eye, particularly in the drainage of aqueous humor fluid, which are believed to bring about changes in pressure. Thus, it is primarily this region whose properties are manipulated in current and emerging therapies for glaucoma. Here, we focus on the challenges associated with developing treatments, review the available experimental methods to evaluate the therapeutic potential of new drugs, describe the development and evaluation of emerging Rho-kinase inhibitors and adenosine receptor ligands that offer the potential to improve aqueous humor outflow and protect RGCs simultaneously, and present new targets and approaches on the horizon.", 
    "12": "UV light and some medications are known to trigger lupus erythematosus (LE). A common mechanism underlying the immunopathologic effect, resulting from exposure to these two seemingly unrelated factors, remains unknown. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) plays a key role in the regulation of IL-22 production in humans and can be activated by both xenobiotics and naturally occurring photoproducts. A significant expansion of Th17 and Th22 cells was observed in the peripheral blood of active systemic LE (SLE) patients, compared to inactive patients and controls. We also show that propranolol, a potential lupus-inducing drug, induced stronger AhR activation in PBMCs of SLE patients than in those of controls. AhR agonist activity of propranolol was enhanced by UV light exposure. MS analysis of irradiated propranolol revealed the generation of a proinflammatory photoproduct. This compound behaves like the prototypic AhR ligand 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole, a cutaneous UV light-induced tryptophan metabolite, both promoting IL-22, IL-8, and CCL2 secretion by T-cells and macrophages. Finally, LE patients exhibit signs of cutaneous AhR activation that correlate with lesional expression of the same proinflammatory cytokines, suggesting a role for photometabolites in the induction of skin inflammation. The AhR might therefore represent a target for therapeutic intervention in LE.",

    "18": "Elevated eye pressure is the main risk factor for glaucoma; intraocular pressure rises when the ratio between aqueous humor formation (inflow) and its outflow is unbalanced. Currently, the main goal of medical treatment is the reduction of intraocular pressure. Five main classes of topical drugs are available; they include betablockers, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, prostaglandin derivatives, sympathomimetics and miotics. Beta-blockers and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors slow the formation of aqueous humor and may be considered as \"inflow\" drugs; the other three classes reduce the resistance to the drainage of aqueous humor and may be considered as \"outflow\" drugs. Despite the variety of drugs accessible in the market, there is a real need for ophthalmologists to have more potent medications for this disease. This review focuses on medical treatment of glaucoma with particular attention to novel molecules in pre-clinical or clinical development.", 
    "19": "This study evaluates the ability of polyethylenimine-modified and non-modified polymeric micelles to enhance permeation through the nasal mucosa for a highly hydrophobic model drug. Carvedilol was loaded into polyethylenimine-modified and non-modified micelles by direct dissolution. Formulations were characterised by critical micelle concentration, micelle particle size and distribution, zeta potential, morphological structure and entrapment efficiency. The drug entrapment efficiency was determined to be as high as 77.14%, while micelle particle sizes and zeta potentials were within the range of 140.0-279.9 nm and (- 40.6)-(+ 25.9) mV, respectively. In vitro studies showed 100% release of carvedilol from micelles in 120 hours. Ex vivo permeation studies showed that the drug in polyethylenimine non-modified micelles passed more efficiently than the drug in polyethylenimine modified micelles. These results demonstrated that polyethylenimine modified micelles did not significantly affect the permeation of the drug when compared to polyethylenimine non-modified micelles. On the contrary, the drug in poly(L-lactide)-block-methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)5000 micelles, the polyethylenimine non-modified micelles, showed the highest permeation rate through bovine nasal mucosa. In conclusion, poly(L-lactide)-block- methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)5000 polymeric micelles maybe useful as novel drug carriers that increase the permeation through the nasal mucosa.", 
    "20": "Carvedilol is the current \u03b2-blocker of choice for suppressing ventricular tachyarrhythmia (VT). However, carvedilol's benefits are dose-limited, attributable to its potent \u03b2-blocking activity that can lead to bradycardia and hypotension. The clinically used carvedilol is a racemic mixture of \u03b2-blocking S-carvedilol and non-\u03b2-blocking R-carvedilol. We recently reported that novel non-\u03b2-blocking carvedilol analogues are effective in suppressing arrhythmogenic Ca(2+) waves and stress-induced VT without causing bradycardia. Thus, the non-\u03b2-blocking R-carvedilol enantiomer may also possess this favourable anti-arrhythmic property. To test this possibility, we synthesized R-carvedilol and assessed its effect on Ca(2+) release and VT. Like racemic carvedilol, R-carvedilol directly reduces the open duration of the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2), suppresses spontaneous Ca(2+) oscillations in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, Ca(2+) waves in cardiomyocytes in intact hearts and stress-induced VT in mice harbouring a catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT)-causing RyR2 mutation. Importantly, R-carvedilol did not significantly alter heart rate or blood pressure. Therefore, the non-\u03b2-blocking R-carvedilol enantiomer represents a very promising prophylactic treatment for Ca(2+)- triggered arrhythmia without the bradycardia and hypotension often associated with racemic carvedilol. Systematic clinical assessments of R-carvedilol as a new anti-arrhythmic agent may be warranted.", 
    "21": "Endothelial microparticles (EMPs) are complex vesicular structures with great significance in vascular pathophysiology. Here, we aimed to determine the impact of therapeutic drugs for infantile hemangioma, a common vascular tumor of infancy, on the biochemical features of EMPs. We exposed human umbilical vein endothelial cells to propranolol (Pro), dexamethasone (Dex), or rapamycin (Rap). Compared with controls, Pro and Rap dramatically augmented EMP release, whereas Dex significantly suppressed EMP generation. Drug-stimulated EMPs could inherit but tended to lose specific endothelial surface antigens from their parental cells. On the one hand, markedly distinct messenger RNA expression patterns were observed within and between drug-stimulated endothelial cells and derived EMPs. On the other hand, Rap-treated endothelial cells and Pro-induced EMPs displayed downregulation of multiple angiogenesis-related molecules at messenger RNA level compared with corresponding controls. Meanwhile, among tested angiogenesis-associated microRNAs, twelve microRNAs were downregulated in drug-induced EMPs, whereas only let-7b and miR-133a were markedly upregulated. Collectively, these data may indicate selective and distinctive package of biomolecules into EMPs depending on specific drugs. Our findings may provide novel insights into the underlying mechanisms of pharmacological therapy for infantile hemangioma.", 
    "22": "This study was designed to investigate the effects of cilostazol on the pharmacokinetics of carvedilol following oral or intravenous administration of carvedilol in rats. Clinically carvedilol and cilostazol can be prescribed for treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Carvedilol and cilostazol are all substrates of CYP2C9 enzymes. Carvedilol was administered orally or intravenously without or with oral administration of cilostazol to rats. The effects of cilostazol on cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 activity and P-gp activity were also evaluated. Cilostazol inhibited CYP2C9 activity in a concentration-dependent manner with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of 8.7 \u03bcM. Compared with the control group, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of carvedilol was significantly (P < 0.05) increased by 38.0%. The peak concentration (C(max)) was significantly (P < 0.05) increased by 49.2% in the presence of cilostazol after oral administration of carvedilol. Consequently, the relative bioavailability (R.B.) of carvedilol was increased by 1.15 - 1.38-fold, and the absolute bioavailability (A.B.) of carvedilol in the presence of cilostazol was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than that of the control. After intravenous administration, the AUC of carvedilol was significantly (P < 0.05) increased by 19.2% compared to that in the control by cilostazol. These results suggest that cilostazol effectively inhibited the metabolism of carvedilol. The increased oral bioavailability of carvedilol might be due to the inhibition of CYP2C9-mediated metabolism of carvedilol in the liver by cilostazol.",

    "24": "Timolol Maleate (also called Timolol) is a nonselective beta-adrenergic blocker and a class II antiarrhythmic drug, which is used to treat intraocular hypertension. It has been reported to cause systemic side effects especially in elderly patients with other comorbidities. These side effects are due to systemic absorption of the drug and it is known that Timolol is measurable in the serum following ophthalmic use. Chances of life threatening side effects increase if these are coprescribed with other cardiodepressant drugs like calcium channel or systemic beta blockers. We report a case where an elderly patient was admitted with three side effects of Timolol and his condition required ICU admission with mechanical ventilation and temporary transvenous pacing. The case emphasizes the need of raising awareness among physicians of such medications about the potential side effects and drug interactions. A close liaison among patient's physicians is suggested.",

However, we hesitate to use landiolol in patients with low cardiac output. We would like to emphasize that careful use of landiolol should be considered in patients with refractory ES after myocardial infarction, although cardiac output is severely reduced.", 
    "26": "Aim Most long QT syndrome patients are associated with genetic mutations. We aimed to investigate the clinical and biochemical characteristics and look for genotype-based preventive implications in Chinese long QT syndrome patients. Methods and results We identified two missense mutations of the KCNQ1 gene in two independent Chinese families, including a previously reported mutation R380S in the C-terminus and a novel mutation W305L in the P-loop domain of the Kv7.1 channel, respectively. The proband with R380S was an 11-year-old girl who suffered a prolonged corrected QT interval of 660 ms, recurrent syncope, and sudden cardiac death, whose father was an asymptomatic carrier. The mutation W305L was detected in a 36-year-old woman with long QT syndrome and her immediate family members including the proband's younger sister with an unexplained syncope, her son, and her elder daughter without symptoms. Metoprolol appeared to be effective in preventing arrhythmias and syncope in long QT syndrome patients with mutation W305L. Both R380S and W305L mutations led to \"loss-of-function\" of the Kv7.1 channel accounting for the clinical phenotypes.",

Mutation W305L in the P-loop domain of the Kv7.1 may derive a pronounced benefit from \u03b2-blocker therapy in symptomatic long QT syndrome patients, whereas mutation R380S located in the C-terminus may be associated with a high risk of sudden cardiac death.", 
    "28": "Hypertension is the most commonly encountered medical condition in pregnancy, contributing significantly to maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Mild to moderate hypertension in pregnancy is defined as systolic blood pressure of 140-159 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of 90-109 mmHg (7-9% of pregnancies). When treating hypertension in pregnancy, not only do physiologic changes of pregnancy have an effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drugs used, but the pathophysiology of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy also have an effect. To date, evidence is lacking on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of commonly used antihypertensive drugs, which often times leads to suboptimal treatment of hypertensive pregnant women. When considering which agents to use for treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, specifically in gestational and chronic hypertension, oral labetalol and nifedipine are valid options. An overview of the profile for use, safety, and current pharmacokinetic data for each agent is presented here.", 
    "29": "Genetic variation in the pharmacokinetics of metoprolol and torsemide due to polymorphisms in CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and OATP1B1 has been extensively studied. However, it is still unknown how much of the variation in pharmacokinetics of these two clinically important drugs in total is due to genetic factors. Metoprolol and torsemide were intravenously administered to 44 monozygotic and 14 dizygotic twin pairs. Metoprolol area under the curve (AUC) varied 4.7-fold and torsemide AUC 3.5-fold. A very high fraction of AUC variations, 91% of metoprolol and 86% of torsemide, were found to be due to additive genetic effects. However, known genetic variants of CYP2D6, -2C9, and OATP1B1 explained only 39%, 2%, and 39% of that variation, respectively. Comparable results for genetically explained variation in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics have been found for other substrates of these enzymes earlier. These findings indicate that a substantial fraction of the heritable variability in the pharmacokinetics of metoprolol and torsemide remains to be elucidated.", 
    "30": "Management of cardiovascular instability resulting from calcium channel antagonist (CCB) or beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist (BB) poisoning follows similar principles. Significant myocardial depression, bradycardia and hypotension result in both cases. CCBs can also produce vasodilatory shock. Additionally, CCBs, such as verapamil and diltiazem, are commonly ingested in sustained-release formulations. This can also be the case for some BBs. Peak toxicity can be delayed by several hours. Provision of early gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal and whole-bowel irrigation might mitigate this. Treatment of shock requires a multimodal approach to inotropic therapy that can be guided by echocardiographic or invasive haemodynamic assessment of myocardial function. High-dose insulin euglycaemia is commonly recommended as a first-line treatment in these poisonings, to improve myocardial contractility, and should be instituted early when myocardial dysfunction is suspected. Catecholamine infusions are complementary to this therapy for both inotropic and chronotropic support. Catecholamine vasopressors and vasopressin are used in the treatment of vasodilatory shock. Optimizing serum calcium concentration can confer some benefit to improving myocardial function and vascular tone after CCB poisoning. High-dose glucagon infusions have provided moderate chronotropic and inotropic benefits in BB poisoning. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors and levosimendan have positive inotropic effects but also produce peripheral vasodilation, which can limit blood pressure improvement. In cases of severe cardiogenic shock and/or cardiac arrest post-poisoning, extracorporeal cardiac assist devices have resulted in successful recovery. Other treatments used in refractory hypotension include intravenous lipid emulsion for lipophilic CCB and BB poisoning and methylene blue for refractory vasodilatory shock.",

    "32": "The existence of \u03b2-adrenoceptors (ARs) in the hippocampus and the importance of \u03b2-ARs in regulating synaptic plasticity and learning/memory function are well documented. As known, \u03b2-ARs in area cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) are involved in regulating memory consolidation. However, little is known about the functional roles of the \u03b2-ARs subtypes, \u03b21- and \u03b22-ARs, in the hippocampal cornu ammonis 3 (CA3) region. To address this question, we firstly locally infused the \u03b21- or \u03b22-ARs antagonist into the CA3 region and observed that blockage of either \u03b21-AR or \u03b22-AR impaired long-term contextual fear memory and water-maze spatial memory. We also found that, following the contextual fear conditioning, the expression of \u03b21-AR in the CA3 region significantly increased, whereas \u03b22-AR was unchanged. Then intra-CA3 infusion of recombinant lentiviral RNAi vectors for \u03b21 or \u03b22-ARs also produced deficit in contextual memory consolidation. Taken together, the results suggested that the \u03b21- and \u03b22-ARs in the CA3 region were involved in hippocampus dependent memory consolidation.", 
    "33": "The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of neat chitosan (CS) and its derivatives with succinic anhydride (CSUC) and 2-carboxybenzaldehyde (CBCS) as appropriate nanocarriers for ocular release of timolol maleate (Tim). Drug nanoencapsulation was performed via ionic crosslinking gelation of the used carriers and sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP). Nanoparticles with size ranged from about 190 to 525 nm were prepared and it was found that the formed size was directly depended on the used carrier and their ratios with TPP. For CS derivatives it was found that as the amount of TPP increased, the particle size increased too, while both derivatives proceeded to nanoparticles with smaller size than that of neat CS. The interactions between carriers and TPP were studied theoretically using all-electron calculations within the framework of density functional theory (DFT). In most of nanoparticles formulations, Tim was entrapped in amorphous form, while the drug entrapment efficiency was higher in CBCS derivative.It was indicated that Tim release rate depended mainly on the used carrier, particle size of prepared nanocarriers and drug loading. From the theoretical release data analysis, it was found that the Tim release was a stagewise procedure with drug diffusion being the dominant release mechanism for each stage.",

However, a significant proportion of patients still experience AVB while on treatment with NSBB, and its impact on prognosis of AVB is unknown. The present study was aimed at assessing the effect of being on prophylactic therapy with NSBB on 5-day failure and 6-week mortality of patients with cirrhosis admitted with AVB. Included were 142 patients: 49 were receiving prophylactic therapy with NSBB (NSBB group) and 93 were not (control group). There were some differences in the baseline characteristics between the groups: higher proportion of alcoholic etiology and active alcoholism (37% versus 10%), higher platelet count, and lower hematocrit at admission in the control group. However, the severity of AVB and initial treatment were similar. Five-day failure occurred in 20% of patients (14% in NSBB versus 24% in controls, P\u2009=\u20090.27). The adjusted odds ratio for 5-day failure under NSBB was 2.46 (95% confidence interval 0.53-11.37, P\u2009=\u20090.25). Nineteen patients (13%) died, and two had liver transplantation within 6 weeks. The probability of survival at 6 weeks was 96% in the NSBB group and 82% in the control group (P\u2009=\u20090.02). After adjusting by propensity score and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score, the NSBB adjusted odds ratio for 6-week mortality was 0.38 (95% confidence interval 0.05-2.63, P\u2009=\u20090.32). The estimated association between NSBB with both 5-day failure and 6-week mortality was homogenous across all Model for End-Stage Liver Disease spectrums.",

A meta-analysis was carried out to derive a more precise estimation. Relevant studies were identified by searching PubMed and EMBASE to May 2015. We calculated the summary hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using random-effects models. Twenty cohort studies and four case-control studies involving 76\u2009538 participants were included. The overall results showed that patients who used \u03b2 blockers after diagnosis had an HR of 0.89 (95% CI 0.81-0.98) for all-cause mortality compared with nonusers. Those who used \u03b2 blockers after diagnosis (vs. nonusers) had an HR of 0.89 (95% CI 0.79-0.99) for cancer-specific mortality. Prediagnostic use of \u03b2 blockers showed no beneficial effect on all-cause mortality or cancer-specific mortality. Stratifying by cancer type, only breast cancer patients who used \u03b2 blockers after diagnosis had a prolonged overall survival. A linear but nonsignificant trend was found between postdiagnostic \u03b2-blocker use and mortality of cancer patients. In conclusion, the average effect of \u03b2-blocker use after diagnosis but not before diagnosis is beneficial for the survival of cancer patients.",

    "41": "Ambulatory ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy (UGFS) for refluxing saphenous veins is considered a safe therapy. Venous thromboembolic complications after UGFS as well as after all other ambulatory ablative venous interventions are rarely reported. This paper reports a fatal pulmonary embolism (PE) following UGFS in combination with an extended phlebectomy, and questions what measures should be taken to minimize the risk for thromboembolic complications after these procedures. In the reported case (unsuspected), extensive non-occluding atherosclerosis as well as obesity in combination with use of an oral contraceptive might have contributed to the development of the PE while the use of a \u03b2-blocker might have increased its fatal course considerably. Routine measurement of the ankle-brachial pressure index reduces the risk for undetected atherosclerosis. It appears that 'in the real world' of ambulatory phlebological treatments thromboembolic complications are more common (2.4-4.7%) and appear accompanied by post-procedural mortality. It is concluded therefore that pharmacological thromboprophylaxis appears warranted in selected cases, perhaps even routine application could be considered. Attention is drawn to the highly thrombogenic but not uncommon combination of overweight and use of oral contraceptive. Apart from applying some form of pharmacological thromboprophylaxis, technical adaptations that might prevent or reduce spill over of foam into the deep venous system should be considered. Firstly, next to adherence to the generally accepted maximum of 10\u2009mL of foam per session, it seems prudent to maximize the injected volume of foam per site. Secondly, it seems best to inject the foam in an elevated leg without groin compression. The concentration of the sclerosant does not appear decisive in this respect, although higher concentrations appear more effective and therefore might be injected in lower volumes without compromising efficacy.",

Carvedilol is a weak base that is substantially insoluble in water, acidic solutions, and gastric and intestinal fluids; it is classified as a Class II drug in the Biopharmaceutical Classification System. The solubility of carvedilol varies according to the solvent pH. This study aimed to evaluate and correlate the physicochemical and processability properties of carvedilol. Samples of the active ingredient from three different manufacturers were characterized according to their flowability, particle size and apparent density and using microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, intrinsic dissolution and powder dissolution tests. It was determined that the tested samples presented the same polymorphic form, did not present good flowability, and presented different particle size distributions.

The drug layered pellets were coated with Eudragit NE 30D to obtain a sustained release (SR) property. The mechanical properties and permeability of the coating film were tailored by adjusting the proportion of talc in the coating dispersion and the weight gain of the coating film. Pellets with different MS release rates were tested and then mixed together by different ratios to optimize drug release rate. The mixed pellets were compressed into tablets with cushioning excipients. The results showed that when the ratio of talc and coating material was 1:4, the coating operation could be conducted successfully without pellet conglutination and the mechanical property of the coating film was enhanced to withstand the compress force during tableting. Blending SR-coated pellets of 20% weight gain with SR-coated pellets of 40% weight gain at the ratio of 1:5 could produce a constant and desired drug release rate.

Herein, we report the first application of label-free deep UV fluorescence detection in non-UV transparent full-body polymer microfluidic devices. This was achieved by means of two-photon excitation in the visible range (\u03bbex = 532 nm). Issues associated with the low optical transmittance of plastics in the UV range were successfully circumvented in this way. The technique was investigated by application to microchip electrophoresis of small aromatic compounds.

At the end of the 12-month follow-up, there was no significant difference in mortality between COPD and no-COPD patients (10.9% vs. 11.1%, p = 0.66).", 
    "94": "The findings from the Polish part of the ESC-HF registry indicate that COPD in patients with HF is associated with older age, smoker status, hypertension and higher NYHA class. The use of \u03b2-blockers was significantly lower in patients with than without COPD. There were no significant differences in mortality between groups.", 
    "95": "The increasing use of beta and calcium channel blockers for management of cardiac comorbidities has led to more frequent complications in the postoperative period. Anesthetic interaction with these drugs can lead to delayed manifestations of features of toxicity, even when administered in therapeutic doses. We report a case with an uneventful intraoperative period but profound bradycardia and hypotension postoperatively, only relieved with high-dose insulin therapy.", 
    "96": "Alternating current electrospinning (ACES) was compared to direct current electrospinning (DCES) for the preparation of drug-loaded nanofibrous mats. It is generally considered that DCES is the solely technique to produce nanofibers using the electrostatic force from polymer solutions, however, less studied and also capable ACES provides further advantages such as increased specific productivities. A poorly water-soluble drug (carvedilol) was incorporated into the fibers based on three different polymeric matrices (an acid-soluble terpolymer (Eudragit(\u00ae) E), a base-soluble copolymer (Eudragit(\u00ae) L 100-55) and a nonionic homopolymer (polyvinylpyrrolidone K90)) to improve the dissolution of the weak base drug under different pH conditions. Morphology and fiber diameter evaluation showed similar electrospun fibers regardless the type of the high voltage and the major differences in feeding rates. The amorphous ACES and DCES fibers provided fast and total drug dissolutions in all cases. The presented results show that ACES can be a more feasible novel alternative to formulate fibers for drug delivery purposes.",

Modification of pharmacotherapy were most often referred to B-blocker and cardiac glycosides. Patients with AF had more often parameters of bradycardia pacing changed (p=0,016). There was a significant correlation between number of interventions and total number of reprogramming (r=0,3 p<0,05). A negative correlation was found between LVEF and number of reprogramming of detection of ventricular tachyarrhythmia (r=-0,18 p<0,05) and between LVEF and number of interventions (r=-0,2, p<0,05). Patients with interventions and patients AF had more pharmacotherapy changes (82 vs 29, p<0,001 and 59 vs 52, p<0,01 respectively).

    "102": "Drug seeking is maintained by encounters with drug-associated cues, and disrupting retrieval of these drug-cue associations would reduce the risk of relapse. Retrieval of cocaine-associated memories is dependent on \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2-AR) activation, and blockade of these receptors induces a persistent retrieval deficit. Whether retrieval of cocaine-associated memory is mediated by a specific \u03b2-AR subtype, however, remains unclear. Using a cocaine conditioned place preference (CPP) procedure, we examined whether retrieval of a cocaine CPP memory is mediated collectively by \u03b21- and \u03b22-ARs, or by one of these \u03b2-AR subtypes alone. We show that co-blockade of \u03b21- and \u03b22-ARs abolished CPP expression on that and subsequent drug-free CPP tests, resulting in a long-lasting retrieval deficit that prevented subsequent cocaine-induced reinstatement. To dissociate the necessity of either \u03b21- or \u03b22-ARs alone, we administered subtype-specific antagonists prior to retrieval. Administration of a \u03b21-AR antagonist before the initial CPP trial dose-dependently reduced expression of a CPP on that and subsequent drug-free trials as compared to vehicle administration. In contrast, administration of a \u03b22-AR antagonist had no effect on initial CPP expression, although the highest dose reduced subsequent CPP expression. Importantly, either \u03b21- or \u03b22-AR blockade prior to an initial retrieval trial prevented subsequent cocaine-induced reinstatement. Our findings indicate that the \u03b21-AR subtype mediates retrieval of a cocaine CPP, and that acutely blocking either \u03b21- or \u03b22-ARs can prevent subsequent cocaine-induced reinstatement. Thus, \u03b2-AR antagonists, particularly \u03b21-ARs antagonists, could serve as adjuncts for addiction therapies to prevent retrieval of drug-associated memories and provide protection against relapse.",

Inflammation-induced myocardial apoptosis is key to the development of sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction. Increasing evidence suggests the anti-inflammatory role of \u03b21-adrenergic blocker, esmolol, during lethal endotoxemia. However, the direct protective effect of esmolol on cardiomyocyte viability during sepsis is still not clear. Here, we aimed to study whether infusion of esmolol can directly inhibit myocardial apoptosis during lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-triggered inflammatory insult.",

    "111": "Breast cancer is the most frequent neoplasia in women and is responsible for approximately 13.8% of deaths per year for this gender. It has been suggested that JAK2, STAT3, and NF-\u03baB gene expression is involved in this type of cancer. The objective of the present study was to determine the effect of bistriazole in these signaling pathways in patients with breast cancer and benign mammary lesions. The inhibitory concentration 50 of bistriazole was calculated in cell cultures of patients with benign lesions, Probit\u00a0=\u00a04.6\u00a0\u03bcM with IC\u00a0=\u00a095%. The study was performed by examining 63 women who submitted to mammary biopsies. Biopsies of the mammary lesions were performed, gene expression was determined, and cells were cultured in the presence of 4.6\u00a0\u03bcM bistriazole. We found that breast cancer is related to age greater than 50 (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.01), being overweight (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.023) and having a waist circumference larger than 80\u00a0cm (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.01). The gene expression of JAK2, STAT3, and NF-\u03baB was higher in groups of patients with breast cancer, while SOCS3 expression was lower. After being exposed to bistriazole, the expression of JAK2 and STAT3 decreased, and the expression of SOCS3 and NF-\u03baB increased. In conclusion, this molecule in development has an effect on the gene expression of JAK3 and STAT3; nevertheless, the lack of change in NF-\u03baB indicates that it is not a regulator of inflammation, and therefore, more studies should be performed.",

Erythromelalgia occurs either as a primary, idiopathic form, or secondary to a number of diseases and conditions. Although fairly well studied in adults, the characteristics, pathogenesis, and natural history are poorly characterized in the pediatric age group. Different therapeutic options have been tried, but no optimal treatment has been suggested for erythromelalgia. We report a rare case of linear erythromelalgia in a 12-year-old girl involving her central body from the peripheral extremities, which seemed to be secondary due to vasculitis.

    "113": "Cardiomyocyte death is one major factor in the development of heart dysfunction, thus, understanding its mechanism may help with the prevention and treatment of this disease. Previously, we reported that anti-\u03b21-adrenergic receptor autoantibodies (\u03b21-AABs) decreased myocardial autophagy, but the role of these in cardiac function and cardiomyocyte death is unclear. We report that rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, restored cardiac function in a passively \u03b21-AAB-immunized rat model with decreased cardiac function and myocardial autophagic flux. Next, after upregulating or inhibiting autophagy with Beclin-1 overexpression/rapamycin or RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated expression of Beclin-1/3-methyladenine, \u03b21-AAB-induced autophagy was an initial protective stress response before apoptosis. Then, decreased autophagy contributed to cardiomyocyte death followed by decreases in cardiac function. In conclusion, proper regulation of autophagy may be important for treating patients with \u03b21-AAB-positive heart dysfunction.",

We herein present the case of a 42-year-old male, who developed bilateral gynecomastia following nebivolol use and complete regression after discontinuation of nebivolol. Other reasons causing gynecomastia were excluded.

Among these variants, we recently identified 22 novel variants in the Chinese population. The aim of this study was to functionally characterize the enzymatic activity of these variants in vitro. A baculovirus-mediated expression system was used to express wild-type CYP2D6.1 and other variants (CYP2D6.2, CYP2D6.10 and 22 novel CYP2D6 variants) at high levels. Then, the insect microsomes containing expressed CYP2D6 proteins were incubated with bufuralol or dextromethorphan at 37\u00b0C for 20 or 25 min., respectively. After termination, the metabolites were extracted and used for the detection with high-performance liquid chromatography. Among the 24 CYP2D6 variants tested, two variants (CYP2D6.92 and CYP2D6.96) were found to be catalytically inactive. The remaining 22 variants exhibited significantly decreased intrinsic clearance values for bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation and 20 variants showed significantly lower intrinsic clearance values for dextromethorphan O-demethylation than those of the wild-type CYP2D6.1. Our in vitro results suggest that most of the variants exhibit significantly reduced catalytic activities compared with the wild-type, and these data provide valuable information for personalized medicine in Chinese and other Asian populations.",

A set of 65 adrenergic ligands including 40 agonists and 25 antagonists in either racemic or enantiopure forms was used for \u03b2arr recruitment experiments based on a split-luciferase assay in a cellular system expressing \u03b22AR.

I commend the authors for implicitly recognizing that it is no longer appropriate to take the laissez faire approach to hemangiomas of infancy. Whilst hemangiomas will eventually improve, they will not necessarily \"disappear,\" as parents are often erroneously counseled. In fact, the larger a hemangioma becomes, the less likely one will be pleased with the ultimate result, whether treated medically or not. The natural process of proliferation followed by involution often produces saggy anetoderma, which, in certain anatomic locations is obvious and draws negative attention.",

Five of the included studies were parallel design; three were cross-over design. The two largest included studies were unpublished carvedilol studies. The estimates of BP lowering effect (systolic BP/diastolic BP millimeters of mercury; SPB/DBP mm Hg) were -4 mm Hg (95% confidence intervals (CI) -6 to -2)/-3 mm Hg (95% CI -4 to -2) for carvedilol (>1000 subjects) and -10 mm Hg (95% CI -14 to -7)/-7 mm Hg (95% CI -9 to -5) for labetalol (110 subjects). The effect of labetalol is likely to be exaggerated due to high risk of bias. Carvedilol, within the recommended dose range, did not show a significant dose response effect for SBP or DBP. Carvedilol had little or no effect on pulse pressure (-1 mm Hg) and did not change BP variability. Overall, once and twice the starting dose of carvedilol and labetalol lowered BP by -6 mm Hg (95% CI -7 to -4) /-4 mm Hg (95% CI -4 to -3) (low quality evidence) and lowered heart rate by five beats per minute (95% CI -6 to -4) (low quality evidence). Five studies (N = 1412) reported withdrawal due to adverse effects; the risk ratio was 0.88 (95% CI 0.54 to 1.42) (moderate quality evidence).", 
    "144": "This review provides low quality evidence that in patients with mild to moderate hypertension, dual receptor blockers lowered trough BP by an average of -6/-4 mm Hg and reduced heart rate by five beats per minute. Due to the larger sample size from the two unpublished studies, carvedilol provided a better estimate of BP lowering effect than labetalol. The BP lowering estimate from combining carvedilol once and twice the starting doses is -4/-3 mm Hg. Doses higher than the recommended starting dose did not provide additional BP reduction. Higher doses of dual receptor blockers caused more bradycardia than lower doses. Based on indirect comparison with other classes of drugs, the blood pressure lowering effect of dual alpha- and beta-receptor blockers is less than non-selective, beta1 selective and partial agonist beta blockers, as well as thiazides and drugs inhibiting the renin angiotensin system. Dual blockers also had little or no effect on reducing pulse pressure, which is similar to the other beta-blocker classes, but less than the average reduction of pulse pressure seen with thiazides and drugs inhibiting the renin angiotensin system. Patients taking dual receptor blockers were not more likely to withdraw from the study compared to patients taking placebo.", 
    "145": "Recent studies revealed that sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) has a relation to the mechanism of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) mediated apoptosis in glomerular mesangial cells and plays an important role in blood pressure regulation. It has been suggested that SIRT1 contributes to the renoprotective effect of angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), but this has not yet become clearly recognized. In this study, we examined the relationship between SIRT1 and the therapeutic effect of olmesartan on renal injury in nephrectomized spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs).",

The drugs were administered for 12 weeks. Blood pressure and urinary protein excretion were measured every 4 weeks. Serum creatinine, glomerular sclerosis, SIRT1 mRNA level, TGF-beta mRNA level and klotho mRNA level were measured at the end of the examination.", 
    "147": "Systolic blood pressure, urinary protein excretion, serum creatinine and glomerular sclerosis in Wistar rats were significantly lower than that of 5/6Nx SHRs. Among 5/6Nx SHRs, high doses of olmesartan significantly decreased urinary protein excretion, serum creatinine and glomerular sclerosis compared to the non-treated and low-dose olmesartan groups. Expression of SIRT1 and klotho mRNA were significantly downregulated in 5/6Nx SHRs; however, olmesartan did not attribute to any change in gene expression. Expression of TGF-beta mRNA was significantly increased in 5/6Nx SHRs, and olmesartan did not affect the level of TGF-beta mRNA expression.", 
    "148": "Expression of SIRT1 is decreased in 5/6Nx SHRs compared to Wistar rats. Olmesartan suppressed glomerular sclerosis, but did not increase the expression of SIRT1, suggesting that the renoprotective effect of olmesartan is independent of the SIRT1 pathway.", 
    "149": "Recently a new risk marker for drug-induced arrhythmias called index of cardio-electrophysiological balance (iCEB), measured as QT interval divided by QRS duration, was evaluated in an animal model.

Then the effect of administration of sotalol and flecainide on iCEB was measured in 40 patients with supraventricular tachycardias. Finally iCEB was assessed in carriers of a long QT syndrome (LQTS, N = 70) or Brugada syndrome (BrS, N = 57) mutation and compared them with genotype negative family members (N = 65).",

    "153": "Angiofibromas are the most recognized cutaneous manifestations of tuberous sclerosis complex. Angiofibromas can be associated with disfigurement, bleeding, pruritus, and erythema and may lead to significant psychosocial consequences for affected patients. Histopathologically, angiofibromas consist of a mixture of vascular and interstitial cells. Traditional treatment options include cryotherapy, electrocoagulation, radiofrequency ablation, dermabrasion, laser treatment, and topical agents such as podophyllotoxin. However, complications such as pain, postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, scarring, and the frequent recurrence rate reduce the utility of these treatment options. The introduction of topical rapamycin marked a turning point for treatment of facial angiofibromas; however, the lack of a standardized formulation, limited insurance coverage, and significant financial cost restrict universal access for patients and their caregivers. Both oral and topical \u03b2-blockers have proven extremely effective treatments for superficial vascular tumors such as hemangiomas and pyogenic granulomas. Topical \u03b2-blockers may potentially be useful for treatment of angiofibromas considering these lesions also contain a vascular component. Here we present an exploratory case report of a patient with tuberous sclerosis complex who had significant clinical improvement of her facial angiofibromas utilizing a \"split-face\" comparison protocol of topical timolol 0.5% gel after full-field treatment with ablative fractional laser resurfacing and pulsed-dye laser.",

Although this article focuses on the role of device therapy for the treatment of LQTS, it also discusses the role of \u03b2-blockers and LCSD because they are concomitant with device therapy.

    "159": "In view of the reliability of the serial-shock method of measuring ventricular fibrillation threshold (VFT) in quantitatively assessing the antifibrillatory potency of many anti-arrhythmic drugs and the alarming reports of the proarrhythmic effects of several anti-arrhythmic agents, it was decided to use the above technique to study the possible interactions that may occur when anti-arrhythmic drugs from different classes are combined. Hearts isolated from New Zealand white rabbits of either sex weighing 1.5-2\u00a0kg were perfused by the Langendorff method with McEwen's solution. In six hearts, measurement of VFT was made in the absence of any drug throughout the experiments. Perfusion with either amiodarone or ibutilide produced significant, dose-dependent increase in VFT. In addition, there was no significant difference in the increase in VFT produced by the combined infusion of 1\u00a0\u03bcmol of amiodarone and 0.01\u00a0\u03bcmol of ibutilide and the summation of the increases produced by the separate infusion of these two concentrations. This is in contrast to a significant synergistic antifibrillatory effect of the combined use of lidocaine and propranolol that was reported previously. The lack of antifibrillatory interactions between amiodarone and Ibutilide may suggest the safety of combining the two drugs in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. However, further studies are required to establish this in the clinical setup.",

    "187": "Worldwide, contamination of aquatic systems with micropollutants, including pharmaceuticals, is one of the challenges for sustainable management of water resources. Although micropollutants are present at low concentrations, many of them raise considerable toxicological concerns, particularly when present as components of complex mixtures. Recent research has shown that this problem cannot be sustainably solved with advanced effluent treatment. Therefore, an alternative that might overcome these environmental problems is the design of new pharmaceutical molecules or the redesign of existing pharmaceutical molecules that present the functionality needed for their application and have improved environmental biodegradability. Such redesigning can be performed by small molecular changes in the drug molecule with intact drug moiety which could incorporate the additional attribute such as biodegradability while retaining its pharmacological potency. This proof of concept study provides an approach for the rational redesign of a given pharmaceutical (Propranolol as an example). New derivatives with small molecular changes as compared to propranolol molecule were generated by a nontargeted photolysis process. Generated derivatives with intact drug moieties (an aromatic ring and a \u03b2-ethanolamine moiety) were further screened for aerobic biodegradability and pharmacological potency. The feasibility of the approach of redesigning an existing pharmaceutical through nontargeted generation of new derivatives with intact drug moiety and through subsequent screening was demonstrated in this study. Application of such approaches in turn might contribute to the protection of water resources in a truly sustainable manner.",

Antihypertensive drugs were applied to these animal models to address the physiological mechanism but not to revert established hypertension. We aimed to investigate the efficacy of carvedilol (CVDL), an unselective beta-blocker that exhibits intrinsic anti-\u03b11-adrenergic and antioxidant activities in a rat model of CIH-induced hypertension. The variability of CVDL enantiomers in plasma concentrations was also evaluated. Wistar rats with indwelling blood pressure telemeters were exposed during their sleep period to 5.6 CIH cycles/h, 10.5 h/day, for 60 days. CVDL was administered by gavage beginning on Day 36 of the CIH period and was continued for 25 days. R-(+)-CVDL and S-(-)-CVDL plasma concentrations were monitored by HPLC. CIH significantly increased diastolic and systolic blood pressure by 25.7 and 21.6 mm Hg respectively, while no effect was observed on the heart rate (HR). CVDL administration at 10, 30 and 50 mg/kg/day promoted a significant reduction in HR but did not affect arterial pressure. The S/(R+S) ratio of CVDL enantiomers was lower in rats exposed to CIH. The blockade of the sympathetic nervous system together with the putative pleiotropic effects of CVDL did not alter the CIH-induced hypertension. Although CIH induced pharmacokinetic changes in the R/(R+S) ratio, these effects do not appear to be responsible for the inability of CVDL to reverse this particular type of hypertension.",
