    "0": "Autonomic nervous alterations have generally been held responsible for the bradycardia of the endurance athlete. In order to determine whether there is also a non-autonomic component in the bradycardia of long-term training, we compared the intrinsic heart rate (HR) of highly trained bicyclists (heart volume: 995 +/- 155 ml) with that of untrained men (heart volume: 805 +/- 195 ml) at rest and during bicycle ergometer exercise at 50, 75 and 100% of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max.) Intrinsic HR was achieved by combined vagal and beta-adrenergic blockade with atropine and propranolol or metoprolol (cardioselective) injected intravenously. Intrinsic HR was significantly lower in trained (T) than in untrained (UT) at rest and at all levels of exercise. The chronotropic reserve from resting HR to maximal HR was identical in the two groups. Nearly identical intrinsic HRs were achieved with atropine and either beta-adrenergic antagonist. HR differences between T and UT were very similar in magnitude--approximately 13 beats/min--at rest and during exercise at a given percentage of VO2 max, with and without autonomic blockade. Evidence is thus provided for a non-autonomic component in the bradycardia of well-trained men which may be responsible for a parallel downward shift in the relationship between HR and percentage of VO2 max. The lower intrinsic HR in well-trained men might be explained by, i.a. the cardiac enlargement.", 
    "1": "1. The beta-action of catecholamines on the smooth muscle of guinea-pig taenia coli was investigated by observing the effects of isoprenaline (2 X 10(-8)-7.2 X 10(-6) M) in the presence of an alpha-blocker, phentolamine (6.3 X 10(-6) M). Electrical and mechanical activity were recorded with the double sucrose gap method. Calcium and potassium fluxes were determined using the 45Ca and 42K isotopes. 2. Isoprenaline suppressed spontaneous spike generation, reduced the size of evoked phasic contractions, and caused a small hyperpolarization of the membrane without change in membrane resistance. These effects were abolished by a beta-blocker, propranolol (6.8 X 10(-6) M). 3. The hyperpolarization induced by isoprenaline was smaller in quiescent, nonstimulated muscle than in active, frequently stimulated preparations. It occurred with the same time course as the reduction in the size of evoked phasic contractions. Both effects were dose dependent and reached a maximum at 7.2 X 10(-7) M-isoprenaline. 4. Hyperpolarization by direct current application did not reduce the size of evoked phasic contractions until excitation threshold was reached. In the presence of isoprenaline, repolarization of the membrane to its original level by depolarizing current application did not restore the reduced phasic contractions to their original size. 5. The slopes of the current-voltage relation in the absence and presence of isoprenaline were parallel, confirming the absence of a change in membrane resistance. Isoprenaline also did not affect membrane resistance when applied in the modified ionic environments used. 6. In different external K concentrations (0.60-29.5 mM) the relationship between the size of the electrotonic potential and the magnitude of the isoprenaline-induced hyperpolarization was linear. A similar, direct relation was seen between isoprenaline hyperpolarization and membrane resistance when the latter was increased by lowering external chloride to 13.3 mM. 7. Excess Cao (7.5 mM) hyperpolarized the membrane and reduced membrane resistance, but the hyperpolarization by isoprenaline was larger than in normal solution, being inversely related to the membrane resistance. The hyperpolarization was directly related to the external Ca concentration, suggesting that the magnitude of the response to the beta-action might depend on the cytoplasmic Ca concentration. 8. In low external Na (18 mM-Nao) the beta-action was scarcely affected. Complete replacement of Na with choline increased membrane resistance, muscle tone and phasic contractions; in this condition the effects of isoprenaline were abolished. 9. When the Na pump was blocked by exposure to zero K, to ouabain, or to both simultaneously, isoprenaline remained highly effective. However, prolonged exposure to ouabain abolished the beta-action. 10. Isoprenaline (1.4 X 10(-6) M) increased 45Ca efflux by about 20%, while 45Ca influx was not changed, and 42K efflux remained constant. 11...", 
    "2": "Behavioral reactions induced in white rats by propylnorantifein were studied by the tests of an open field, passive avoidance and self-stimulation from the medial bundle of the fore brain and Raffe suture. Biochemical analysis was done on the content of corticosteroids in blood plasma and that of glycogen and creatine phosphate in brain tissue. Propylantifein in a dose of 5 mg/kg was shown to decrease the self-stimulation, to change the emotional memory in response to pain stimulation, to increase the concentration of corticosteroids in blood plasma. During 3 hr after the drug administration brain tissue demonstrated the decreased glycogen content and particular, drastically reduced the drug action. It is suggested that propylantifein may activate the adenylcyclase system in brain tissue.", 
    "3": "Glucose and free fatty acid (FFA) turnover (RT) were measured by isotopic methods in groups of patients with thyrotoxicosis and hypothyroidism and compared with normal subjects. Patients with thyrotoxicosis were then studied after treatment with oral propranolol and again after treatment with carbimazole. Patients with hypothyroidism were studied again after treatment with thyroxine. Glucose RT was increased by about a third in thyrotoxicosis (12.7 mumol. min.-1 kg-1 +/- 1.0 SEM compared to 9.5 +/- 0.5 in normal subjects) while FFA RT was doubled (12.5 mumol. min.-1 kg-1 +/- 1.2 compared to 6.3 +/- 0.9 in normals). Propranolol was without effect, but carbimazole normalized these variables. In hypothyroidism both glucose and FFA RT were normal (9.1 +/- 0.7 and 6.7 +/- 0.9 respectively). Mean glucose and FFA RT both rose following thyroxine treatment, but not significantly; the post-treatment values remaining within the normal range (10.3 +/- 0.7 and 7.0 +/- 1.3 respectively). Oxidation of FFA, as estimated by 14CO2 excretion, was increased in thyrotoxicosis (42.8% +/- 2.9 SEM compared to 34.8 +/- 2.3 in normal subjects) and fell with carbimazole treatment (34.7 +/- 4.1). In hypothyroid subjects FFA oxidation increased following thyroxine treatment (from 34.4 +/- 4.1). In hypothyroid subjects FFA oxidation increased following thyroxine treatment (from 34.4 +/- 3.3 to 46.2 +/- 3.6).", 
    "4": "Blood thyroid hormone levels were measured during, and for 6 days after, treatment with propranolol (160 mg/day, 4-8 weeks) in five hyperthyroid patients and six normal volunteers. In hyperthyroid patients triiodothyronine (T3) and free triiodothyronine index (FT3I) rose to peak levels 60 h after propranolol withdrawal without significant change in thyroxine (T4) or Thyopac-3 test. In normal subjects no significant change in thyroid hormone levels was seen during propranolol treatment or withdrawal. The rise in T3 and FT3I coincides with, and may contribute to, the rebound increase in adrenergic activity after propranolol withdrawal in hyperthyroidism.", 
    "5": "Alterations in propranolol absorption secondary to concomitant ethanol administration was investigated in five normal adults. With alcohol administration, there was an increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration (CPmax). Ethanol caused a decrease in the rate of absorption and an increase in the rate of elimination of propranolol. It appears that the acute, concomitant administration of alcohol with propranolol will alter the bioavailability of propranolol.", 
    "6": "In 35 pregnant women threatening premature labour and cervic dilatation indicated therapy by a beta-mimetic compound (fenoterol) for tocolysis. 17 patients (group I) got fenoterol-monotherapy; in 18 patients (group II) fenoterol was combined with the cardioselective beta-1-blocking agent metoprolol. There were no differences in age, bodyweight and time of gestation in both groups before therapy; also the obstetric states--as compared by pelvic score (Bishop) and tocolysis index (Baumgarten)--were nearly identical. Efficiency of tocolytic therapy was evaluated by prolongation index (Richter) and tocolysis-success-score (Weidinger). Statistical analysis comparing these parameters in both groups showed no significant differences. Heartrate, however, was significantly (p > 0,005) lower in patients treated by fenoterol and metoprolol, thus indicating less cardial stress induced by fenoterol. In conclusion the combination of the semiselective beta-2-stimulating compound fenoterol with the beta-1-blocking agent metoprolol is proposed for tocolytic therapy because of less cardial stress but identical tocolytic efficiency as compared with fenoterol-monotherapy.", 
    "7": "Chronotropic effects on the cod heart in case of the parasympathetic stimulation alone were initially negative and rather small; the joint stimulation of parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves or the vagus stimulation after noradrenaline administration augmented the initial bradycardia. In case of initial marked parasympathetic negative chronotropic effect, catecholamines diminished the parasympathetic inhibition. The sympathetic innervation and its transmitter seem to be able to increase the cholinergic effect.", 
    "8": "The interaction of dl-propranolol with narcosis induced by ethanol was studied in mice. dl-propranolol reduced significantly the duration of ethanol-induced narcosis. This antagonism was also present in animals pre-treated with pyrazole. The d-isomer of propranolol, devoid of beta-blocking action, did not decrease the duration of ethanol-induced narcosis. The blood levels of ethanol at the end of narcosis were similar in animals with or without dl-propranolol pre-treatment. These results support the hypothesis that this action of dl-propranolol could be mediated by central adrenergic beta receptors.", 
    "9": "The possible effect of practolol (ICI 50,172) on mitochondrial metabolism was studied. The drug inhibited the oxidation of glutamate, alpha-ketoglutarate and succinate by heart mitochondria. The polarographic determinations showed that practolol is an inhibitor of the oxidative phosphorylation. The activity of NADH-oxidase, NADH-ferricyanide reductase, NADH-cytochrome c redutase was inhibit by the drug; no effect was observed on the succinate dehydrogenase. The electron microscopy of isolated mitochondria treated with practolol showed that the drug promote conformational changes of the mitochondrial membrane, probably concerning with the detergent characteristics of the drug.", 
    "10": "The cardiovascular effects of opioid peptides have been studied. Leucine-enkephalin (Leu-ENK) produced blood pressure (BP) increases following administration into the lateral brain ventricles (i.v.t.), into the cisterna magna (i.c.i.), and following intravenous (i.v.) administration. Heart rate (HR) increases were observed following all routes of administration (threshold for BP and HR effects at 0.3 nmole, maximum at 360 nmoles). The cardiovascular effects were independent of generalized seizures, which may occur at higher doses of enkephalins (ENK). D-alanine-enkephalin (D-Ala-ENK) attenuated the vagal component of the baroreceptor reflex in cats. This was indicated by the findings that HR did not decrease following D-Ala-ENK-induced BP increases and that the compensatory decreases in HR following i.v. pressor doses of angiotensin II (ANG II) were markedly attenuated in cats treated with i.v.t. D-Ala-ENK. Naloxone inhibited the BP and HR effects following i.c.i. and i.v., but not following i.v.t., administration of Leu-ENK. The i.v.t. Leu-ENK effect were inhibited by beta-adrenergic receptor blockade. Bratteboro rats homozygous for hereditary diabetes insipidus with total absence of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) synthesis responded with BP decreases following i.v.t. Leu-ENK, while BP increases were observed in control Long-Evans rats. Blood pressure increases to i.v.t. Leu-ENK were markedly greater in spontaneously hypertensive rats of the stroke-prone strain (SHR-sp) than in normotensive control rats; SHR-sp exhibit a humoral pattern of increased ADH, ACTH, and catecholamines, presumably due to central peptidergic stimulation. The known effects of opioid peptides on these hormones and the observed cardiovascular responses suggest a possible participation of this peptide system in the maintenance of high BP in the SHR-sp.", 
    "11": "In the pithed rat, following beta-adrenoceptor blockade, the pressor effect of adrenaline can be blocked by phentolamine or by prazosin plus yohimbine but not by prazosin or yohimbine given alone. It is concluded that adrenaline produces its pressor effect by acting on two sets of post-junctional alpha-adrenoceptors, each of which is sensitive to phentolamine, one of which is sensitive to prazosin but resistant to yohimbine and the other of which is sensitive to yohimbine but resistant to prazosin.", 
    "12": "1 Buccal absorption of propranolol in two volunteers was followed by repeated rinsing of the mouth with buffer solutions for twelve 2 min periods. Values for absorption, recovery and asymptotic recovery were calculated. 2 Large amounts of propranolol were recoverable from the buccal mucosa; recovery was biexponential and the amount recovered depended on the time allowed for absorption and on the pH of buffers used for recovery. 3 In the case of the drug studied, the buccal absorption test was not an adequate model of passive drug transfer through lipid membranes, and more clearly reflected partitioning into the buccal mucosa. 4 It does not follow from disappearance of drug from the buccal cavity that it has entered the circulation. Unabsorbed drug clearly cannot enter the circulation, but other conclusions about systemic absorption cannot be drawn with certainty from the buccal absorption model. 5 Partitioning back into the saliva after absorption also needs to be taken into account for a true model of systemic absorption of orally administered drugs, and a revised schematic representation of the kinetics of oral drug absorption is presented.", 
    "13": "1 The possibility of pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions of prazosin with indomethacin and with propranolol have been studied in healthy subjects. 2 In four out of nine individuals indomethacin considerably attenuated prazosin-induced hypotension, but noradrenaline concentrations were unchanged from the day when blood pressure fell greatly. The effect of prazosin in the other five subjects was not influenced by indomethacin. 3 Indomethacin prevented the rise in plasma renin activity seen following administration of prazosin alone. 4 Propranolol did not prevent the syncope associated with the first dose of prazosin. 5 Propranolol affected neither the absorption nor elimination of prazosin. 6 It is concluded that in certain subjects indomethacin can largely prevent the hypotensive effect of parazosin, possible by increasing adrenergic receptor sensitivity. The theoretical possibility that propranolol could influence prazosin disposition or syncope was not substantiated.", 
    "14": "The hemodynamic determinants of the time constant of left ventricular (LV) isovolumic pressure (P) decline were studied in 32 anesthetized dogs. The time constant, tau (an index of LV relaxation), was determined from the best exponential fit of the equation P = Poe-t/r, to LVP measured at 5-ms intervals during isovolumic relaxation; Po = LVP at maximum negative dP/dt and t = time. At a constant heart rate of 120 beats/min, tau was determined during steady-state increases in preload (volume expansion), increases in afterload (methoxamine infusion), reductions in afterload (nitroprusside infusion), and in variably afterloaded beats at a constant preload (single-beat interventions). tau was directly related to LV systolic pressure and length during the alterations in LV loading conditions, but tau was not closely related to the extent of fiber shortening. During isoproterenol infusion, relaxation was more rapid (tau), and following the administration of propranolol, relaxation was prolonged (tau). While data from the variably afterloaded contractions indicate the presence of systolic load-dependent LV relaxation velocity, the steady-state studies do not exclude the possibility that altered contractility through reflex or other mechanisms contributes to the observed changes in tau.", 
    "15": "The effect of exercise training on metabolic abnormalities and psychological function was assessed in seven hemodialysis patients. Their initial work capacity was low and improved after 8 months of training. Exercise was associated with a reduction in the dose of antihypertensive medications in four patients and a decrease in phosphate binder therapy in three patients. There was also a rise in hematocrit levels (% delta = 34 +/- 20%, P less than 0.03) and the hemoglobin concentration (% delta = 37 +/- 23%, P less than 0.05) of five males. Plasma glucose levels fell (-5 +/- 2%, P less than 0.05, n = 5) and the glucose disappearance rate improved (20 +/- 7%, P less than 0.02), while hyperinsulinism decreased (-36 +/- 20%, P less than 0.02, n = 5) during training. There was no change in body weight or diet. Exercise lowered plasma triglyceride levels (-41 +/- 28%, P less than 0.02, n = 6) and raised the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration (20 +/- 21%, P less than 0.05, n = 6). Psychological testing (n = 4) demonstrated that exercise training was associated with an improvement in depression, hostility, anxiety, social interaction, and outlook for the future. These results suggest that exercise can improve some of metabolic abnormalities and psychological dysfunction which exists in some dialysis patients.", 
    "16": "A model, employing open-chested, anesthetized dogs, was developed to facilitate the study of myocardial drug disposition. Propranolol was employed as a model compound for initial investigation. Propranolol was administered as either a single i.v. bolus of 0.5 mg/kg or by a stepwise infusion protocol employing three rates: 2.6, 6.5 and 12.0 micrograms/kg/min. Blood and myocardial biopsy samples were obtained at specified times and the concentration of propranolol in tissue homogenates and plasma was determined by a high-pressure liquid chromotographic procedure. The concentration-time data obtained from the i.v. bolus studies were fitted to a three-compartment model where one of the compartments represented the myocardium. The model predicts that plasma and myocardial concentrations achieve distribution equilibrium within 2 min after administration. The myocardial-to-plasma concentration ratios ranged from 6.2 to 20.3 and were constant with time for each dog. The myocardial-to-plasma concentration ratios also remained constant during the infusion protocol, indicating linear accumulation up to myocardial concentrations of 6.7 micrograms/ml. To assess regional myocardial concentration differences, the concentration of drug in the right atrium was compared with the concentration of drug in the right atrium was compared with the concentration in the left ventricle at the end of the infusion protocol. The concentrations were not significantly different. The model developed will be used to study the myocardial disposition of several antiarrhythmic drugs and the factors which affect their rate and extent of accumulation.", 
    "17": "Propranolol and other basic amines are concentrated by the lung. To test the possibility that the alveolar macrophage might participate in this process, the uptake of dl-[3H]propranolol was studied in macrophages isolated from healthy male rabbits. Uptake was time, temperature, and pH dependent and was reduced in the presence of inhibitors of cellular energy metabolism, such as sodium azide, iodoacetate, sodium cyanide and 2,4-dinitrophenol. It was abolished by sonication of the cell suspension. Scatchard plots suggested at least three uptake processes, one of which appeared to be partition. Uptake of dl-[3H]propranolol was inhibited equally by increasing concentrations of both the dextro- and the levo-isomers, as well as the racemate. It was also markedly inhibited by the lysomotropic agents, ammonium chloride and chloroquine, and by a number of tertiary amines including imipramine, chlorpromazine and methadone. Endogenous amines, including noreprinephrine, epinephrine and histamine had no effect on uptake. These observations suggest that uptake processes in the lung for exogenous basic amines may differ from those for endogenous amines. Although uptake of endogenous amines has been localized to the vascular endothelium, the lysosome may be one intracellular site of accumulation for exogenous amines.", 
    "18": "Topically applied dipivalyl epinephrine (DPE) and related compounds have been found to inhibit passive anaphylactic reaction in rat conjunctiva. The order of activity is as follows: isoproterenol greater than DPE greater than epinephrine greater than norepinephrine. The antianaphylactic effect of DPE was antagonized by propranolol but was not affected by phentolamine. The effects of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and isoproterenol were also antagonized by propranolol but potentiated by pentolamine. From these findings, it was suggested that DPE not only exerts its antianaphylactic action through activation of beta-adrenergic receptor but also itself has a little different action from epinephrine.", 
    "19": "Twenty-five thyrotoxic patients were treated with propranolol (160 mg/day) for 1 to 2 wk. Although the response to therapy varied there was a reduction (p less than 0.001) in supine and exercise heart rates and in sitting pulse rate. Serum triiodothyronine (T3) fell (p less than 0.001) and serum thyroxine did not change during propranolol therapy. Plasma propranolol levels before assessment varied from 5 to 121 ng/ml, and there were positive correlations between them and percentage reduction in exercise (r = 0.78, p less than 0.001) and resting (r = 0.61, n = 14, p less than 0.05) heart rates, percentage reduction in sitting pulse rate (r = 0.73, p less than 0.001), and the percentage reduction in serum T3 (r = 0.59, n = 23, p less than 0.01). Although weight loss ceased in the group as a whole the degree of continued weight loss or weight gain in individual patients was also related to plasma propranolol concentration (r = 0.61, p less than 0.01). The plasma propranolol level correlated (r = 0.62, p less than 0.01) with thyrotoxicosis therapeutic index. There was no correlation between degress of subjective improvement and plasma propranolol level.", 
    "20": "Three hundred fifty-eight of 429 (83%) consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) and a normal PR interval received various antiarrhythmic drugs (AD), including lidocaine and/or procainamide, quinidine, digoxin, propranolol or disopyramide. There was no significant difference in the incidence of progression to any degree of atrioventricular (AV) block or to higher degrees of AV block (Mobitz II or third-degree AV block) between those treated and not treated with AD: 38 of 358 (11%) and six of 358 (1.7%) with AD vs 11 of 71 (15%) and two of 71 (2.8%) in the untreated group, respectively. Similarly, there was no significant difference in progression between treated and untreated patients with anterior MI, 14 of 144 (10%) vs five of 32 (16%); inferior MI, 21 of 111 (19%) vs five of 26 (19%), or subendocardial MI, three of 103 (3%) vs one of 12 (8%). Bundle branch block (BBB) (without AV block) was initially present in 89 of 249 (21%). The incidence of AV block (seven of 24, 30%) was higher in treated patients with newly acquired BBB (27 patients) than in the untreated patients (none of three, p less than 0.05). The commonly used ADs did not adversely affect AV conduction in patients with acute MI with narrow QRS and either normal, first-degree, or Mobitz I AV block. Moreover, no subset of patients grouped by infarct location, specific AD used, or BBB (except perhaps for those with newly acquired BBB) appeared to be at risk of development of AV block during AD therapy.", 
    "21": "In order to assess the hemodynamic effects of medical (propranolol) and surgical (transaortal subvalvular myectomy) therapy, we determined in 20 patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy the following circulatory parameters at rest and during maximal exercise before and after therapy: heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, and pulmonary artery pressure. 9 patients were re-investigated after medical therapy of 3.5 weeks to 7 months (averaging 3 months) with a daily dose of 120 to 360 mg (mean 198 +/- 80 mg) propranolol, 11 patients 1 week to 28 months (averaging 7.5 months) after operation. Propranolol induced a significant reduction of heart rate and cardiac output averaging 20.9% and 20.3%, respectively (p in both cases < 0.0001) at equal exercise levels, no change in stroke volume, and a slight increase in the pathologically elevated exercise mean pulmonary artery pressure, with the pulmonary vascular resistance remaining unchanged. Although 3 of the 9 patients reported a slight subjective improvement, exercise capacity did not change significantly from a mean of 66.7 to 69.4 watts. Myectomy, on the other hand, induced no change in heart rate, but a significant increase in exercise stroke volume by 14.9% (p < 0.025) and a distinct increase in cardiac output by an average of 11.2% (not significant), whereas the pathologically elevated exercise mean pulmonary artery pressure fell significantly by 23.8% from a mean of 45.0 to 34.3 mm Hg (p < 0.025). 10 of the 11 surgically treated patients reported a usually marked subjective improvement, and the exercise capacity increased from an average of 61.4 to 81.8 watts (p < 0.01). Thus, the clinical and functional result of surgical therapy was significantly better than that of medical therapy and included, in contrast to medical therapy, a significant hemodynamic improvement and increase in exercise capacity.", 
    "22": "The short-term effects of bilateral electrical stimulation of the lateral component of the lateral hypothalamic/medial forebrain bundle area (LHA) on peripheral plasma levels of glucose (G), immunoreactive insulin (IRI) and glucagon (IRG) were measured in food-derived, anesthetized rats in the presence of continuous low i.v. glucose infusion. In normal rats LHA stimulation induced a rapid but moderate rise in IRI in the presence of a simultaneous rapid rise in G. At the end of the 5 min stimulation period the glucose-induced IRI response was clearly attenuated. In rats receiving a continuous phentolamine (i.v.) infusion, the rapid IRI response was much larger in spite of only marginal rises of G. These findings suggest that electrical LHA stimulation activates two opposing mechanisms on IRI secretion, an excitatory component which is masked in normal animal by a sympathetic alpha-adrenergic inhibitory component. In an attempt to define the mediating pathway of this LHA stimulation-induced IRI excitatory component, both the parasympathetic and sympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system were pharmacologically and surgically manipulated, all in the presence of phentolamine infusion. Neither bilateral subdiaphragmatic vagotomy, atropine, propranolol infusion, nor spinal cord transection at T1 were able to block the IRI response. The findings are consistent with a humoral mediation of this IRI stimulatory response and support the existence of a lateral hypothalamic or hypophyseal factor which is released by LHA stimulation. The implications and physiological role of the LHA in the neural control of insulin secretion and ingestive behavior are discussed.", 
    "23": "The effects of digoxin have been studied on PRA of 11 hypertensive patients treated with a single oral administration of the glycoside or submitted to a prolonged treatment. The experiments performed with a single oral administration (0,5 mg) showed that digoxin induces a significant decrease of the hyperreninemic response induced by furosemide. This effect of digoxin develops very quickly and is well evident when plasma levels of the glycoside are still low. However, in the patients pretreated with a beta blocker, digoxin was completely ineffective in preventing the response to furosemide. In view of the results, the hypothesis is put forward that digoxin mainly acts at renal level through an antiadrenergic activity.", 
    "24": "The bioavailability, plasma levels and pharmacological effect of a daily dose of 0.2 g of metoprolol in Durules and in regular 0.1 g tablets have been studied in eight healthy volunteers during steady state conditions. Durules and two 0.1 g metoprolol tablets were given once daily, and one 0.1 g metoprolol tablet was given every 12th hour. The maximum concentration of metoprolol in plasma after Durules was about half of that after two regular tablets. When one metoprolol 0.1 g tablet was administered every 12th hour, an average maximum concentration slightly higher than for the Durules was recorded about one hour after the administration. The minimum concentration of metoprolol during the day was about twice as high after Durules as after the same dose in regular tablets. The dose-corrected area under the plasma concentration vs time curve of Durules was 87 per cent of the b.i.d. regimen of metoprolol in regular tablets and about 75 per cent of two metoprolol 0.1 g tablets once daily. Metoprolol Durules maintained a more even effect on heart rate and systolic blood pressure during exercise during the day than the corresponding daily dose of metoprolol given as two metoprolol 0.1 g tablets once daily or as one metoprolol 0.1 g tablet every 12th hour. After maximum beta-blockade the effect declined by, on average, 0.60 per cent/hour for the Durules and 0.96 per cent for the regular tablet. The exercise heart rate before the morning dose was significantly lower during treatment with Durules and one metoprolol 0.1 g tablet b.i.d. than during the placebo period. The interaction of metoprolol with the effect of adrenaline (0.09 microgram x kg-1 x min-1, infused at 2, 3.5 and 5 hrs after metoprolol administration) on the diastolic blood pressure was more pronounced when two ordinary 0.1 g metoprolol tablets were administered once daily than for the corresponding dose in Durules, this probably reflecting a difference in degree of action of metoprolol on the vascular bed for Durules and regular metoprolol tablets in identical doses.", 
    "25": "A multicentre study of survivors of an anterior myocardial infarction is reported. The trial consisted of 720 patients and was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study with propranolol 40 mg three times a day. Trial entry was at two to 14 days (mean 8.5 days) and follow-up at one, three, and in most centres, six and nine months. The trial was designed to detect a 50 per cent reduction in mortality and this was not shown. The non-fatal reinfarction rate was similar in both groups. Subgroup analysis identified several prognostic risk factors for death, none of which interacted with treatment.", 
    "26": "Glucose, lactate, non-esterified fatty acid and insulin levels in plasma were measured in two groups of 12 patients undergoing gastrectomy under general anaesthesia. Propranolol in a dose of 0.3 mg/kg body weight was intraoperatively infused in one of the two groups. Surgery under general anaesthesia elicited a significant rise in blood glucose, lactate and NEFA concentrations. These metabolic responses were significantly inhibited by intraoperative infusion of propranolol without producing any undesirable side effect. Plasma insulin levels showed a slight decrease during the operation and no significant difference was noted between the two groups. The results suggest that beta-adrenergic activity is playing a major role in these metabolic responses, promoting the mobilization of substrates. Possible benefits of inhibiting beta-adrenergic activation in surgical stress are discussed.", 
    "27": "To investigate the role of the renin-angiotensin (R-A) system in the release of renal prostaglandin E (PGE), urinary excretion of PGE, plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) were measured before and after the manipulation of the R-A system in hypertensive patients. After 7 days of the control sodium diet, the R-A system was stimulated by a combination of low sodium diet and oral administration of furosemide for 7 days. From the 4th day of sodium restriction, 40 mg/day of propranolol was administered per os for 2 days, and the dose was doubled for the following 2 days. PRA and PAC were significantly increased after the sodium restriction, but no change in urinary excretion of PGE was observed. Additional administration of propranolol for the following 4 days suppressed PRA significantly and PAC moderately, but it also failed to change urinary excretion of PGE. These results may suggest that renal medullary PGE synthesis, as reflected in urinary excretion of PGE, is not strongly dependent on the R-A system in these hypertensive patients.", 
    "28": "The effect of advanced age on drug disposition and response is the subject of an increasing number of research studies. Cigarette smoking and other environmental factors have been shown to influence the metabolism of some drugs. Studies of the effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of antipyrine, indocyanine green and propranolol indicate that the association of increased drug metabolism and smoking occurs predominantly in the young and that apparent liver blood flow declines with age regardless of smoking habits. This age related effect of smoking on drug metabolism may reflect a reduced capacity for hepatic enzyme induction in the elderly. The relative importance of age related alterations in the intrinsic drug metabolising ability of the liver and in liver blood flow depend on the pharmacokinetic characteristics of the drug being investigated.", 
    "29": "1 The effects of propranolol and atenolol given in random order in a cross-over study to fifteen patients with essential hypertension have been studied. 2 Both drugs were effective in lowering blood pressure and side effects were not markedly different. 3 There was no change in exchangeable sodium or potassium or in total body potassium during treatment with either drug. 4 Ambulant plasma renin activity was reduced by both drugs but the fall in blood pressure was not related to initial plasma renin. 5 Despite equal mean reduction in blood pressure with the two drugs, creatinine clearance fell significantly only during treatment with propranolol. 6 These observations suggest that intra-renal beta 2-adrenoceptors may be of importance in the regulation of renal function.", 
    "30": "A double-blind, randomized study comparing the efficacy of intravenous acebutolol with propranolol on frequent premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) in 24 patients is reported. Frequent PVCs were abolished or reduced by 75% or more in 10 of 12 patients (83%) given acebutolol and in 10 of 12 patients (83%) given propranolol. The therapeutic effect of acebutolol lasted for at least 1 hr in 4 of 12 patients (33%), for at least 3.5 hr in 3 of 12 patients (25%), and for at least 4 hr in 2 of 12 patients (17%). The effect of propranolol lasted for at least 1 hr in 6 of 12 patients (50%), for at least 3.5 hr in 4 of 12 patients (33%), and for at least 4 hr in 4 of 12 patients (33%). Hence, intravenous acebutolol and propranolol were equally effective.", 
    "31": "We studied the control of renin release and renal hemodynamic function by administering prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors to conscious sodium-depleted dogs with blockade of the adrenergic nervous system induced by bilateral renal denervation and propranolol administration. Indomethacin (10 mg/kg) reduced plasma renin activity (PRA) by 59% from a high sodium-depleted value, but PRA was still 3 times the normal sodium-repleted level. Arterial pressure, CCr, CPAH, urine flow, and potassium excretion fell strikingly. Similar results were obtained with meclofenamate. When SQ 14,225 was given to another group of conscious, sodium-depleted dogs with adrenergic nervous system blockade, PRA increased from the high sodium-depleted level of 5.7 to 29.3 ng of Angiotensin I (AI)/ml per hour; indomethacin (10 mg/kg) appeared to reduce PRA (0.05 less than P less than 0.1) but to only 12.1 ng of AI/ ml per hour, which is 17 times the normal level. This high level of PRA after blockade of the adrenergic nervous system and injection of indomethacin suggests that important mechanisms other than norepinephrine and renal prostaglandins control renin release; it is proposed that both the renal vascular receptor and the macula densa are involved. The marked decreases in CCr and CPAH in response to indomethacin emphasize the important role of renal prostaglandins in the control of renal hemodynamic function during sodium depletion.",

The authors offer criteria for monitoring the severity of the process, for designing medical therapy, and for making critical decisions with respect to turning from medical management to surgical intervention, either on an elective or an emergency basis.", 
    "33": "The duration of the analgesic effect of levomepromazine was prolonged in mice when associated with propranolol. The administration of morphine to animals treated with propranolol resulted in an increase of morphine toxicity with death of some animals.", 
    "34": "The authors report on ten patients with unstabilized open-angle glaucoma who were treated for up to six months with Timolol eye drops. A significant lowering of intraocular pressure was recorded throughout the treatment period. There was no evidence of deterioration of visual field or acuity. Subjective tolerance was good except in one patient who suffered temporarily from slight tachycardia.", 
    "35": "Spasm of a large coronary artery occurs most often from midnight to early morning and least often in the afternoon, due to the circadian variation of the tone of the large coronary artery in most patients with variant angina. Alpha adrenergic stimulation induces coronary spasm most easily in the early morning and least easily in the afternoon. Coronary spasm is due to strong contraction of coronary vascular smooth muscle cells which is triggered by an increase of intracellular calcium ions; hyperventilation plus TRIS-buffer infusion induces coronary spasm by decreasing hydrogen ions which antagonize the action of calcium ions. Administration of nitroglycerin promptly relieves the acute attack of coronary spasm, and calcium antagonists such as diltiazem, nifedipine and verapamil, which block the entry of calcium ions into coronary vascular smooth muscle cells and dilate large coronary arteries, prevent the occurrence of coronary spasm.", 
    "36": "Experiments were conducted to investigate the bronchodilating action of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) using normal human lung tissue obtained post mortem. Isolated rings of human bronchioles contracted to histamine, carbachol, and prostaglandin F(2a)(PGF(2a)) and relaxed to isoproterenol. THC (5 X 10(-4)M) did not alter the responses of the bronchial rings to histamine, whereas methapyrilene (10(-6)M) antagonized these responses. Atropine (2 X 10(-6)M) had a highly significant effect on the responses of the bronchioles to carbachol: there was also a significant effect of THC (5 X 10(-4)M), but to a much lesser extent than atropine. Propranolol (10(-6)M) pretreatment significantly antagonized the relaxant responses of the bronchioles to isoproternol: THC antagonized these responses to a smaller degree. Incubation with THC did not cause relaxation of resting tissues or tissues in which a spasm had been induced. These data suggest that THC does not have significant direct effects in human bronchial smooth muscle and that bronchoactivity observed in vivo is likely to be of a nondirect or central origin.", 
    "37": "Pharmacodynamical analysis of alpha-adrenergic and beta-adrenergic reactions of sheep rumen was performed in vivo after administration of agonists and antagonists of alpha-adrenergic and beta-adrenergic receptors. It was found that phenylephrine, and in a lower degree propranolol, stimulated the motor activity of sheep rumen, while adrenaline, noradrenaline, isoprenaline, phenoxybenzamine and regitine depressed this activity. Propranolol abolished atonia produced by catecholamines in sheep rumen, and previous blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors with propranolol reversed the relaxing action of catecholamines on the muscular elements in the rumen. The experiments in vivo confirmed the adrenergic effects on the motor activity of the rumen of sheep obtained in earlier investigations on isolated muscles of the rumen. It is suggested that noradrenaline exerts an ambireceptro effect (similar to that of adrenaline) on the motor activity in sheep rumen.", 
    "38": "The alpha and beta-adrenergic responses of the isolated muscle of sheep rumen were analysed by pharmacodynamic methods after administration of alpha and beta-adrenergic agonists and alpha and beta-adrenergic antagonists. It was found that phenylephrine, and in a lower degree propranolol, stimulated contractions of isolated muscle of sheep rumen while adrenaline, noradrenaline, isoprenaline, phenoxybenzamine and regitine inhibited these contractions. Propranolol abolished the dilating (atonic) effect of catecholamines on the isolated muscles of sheep rumen and previous blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors with propranolol reversed the dilating effects of catecholamines. It is concluded that noradrenaline has an ambiceptor effect (similar to that of adrenaline) on the isolated muscle of the rumen.", 
    "39": "In anesthetized dogs and rabbits, the increasing doses of mesaton raise the cardiac output and diminish overall peripheral vascular resistance. The cardiostimulant effect is prevented by obsidan, whilst the negative chronotropic by atropine. The effect of mesaton on alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptors is discussed.", 
    "40": "We have developed kinetic methods with which we have demonstrated that the negatively cooperative hormone-binding model is untenable for the insulin receptor system. These methods have led others to the same conclusion for the thyrotropin and nerve growth factor receptors. We report here the application of these methods to the study of (l)-[propyl-2,3-3H]dihydroalprenolol [(l)-[3H]DHA] binding at 15 degrees C to the beta-adrenergic receptor of the frog erythrocyte--the remaining and most extensively characterized hormone receptor-cyclase system in which negatively cooperative site-site interactions have been reported. Scatchard analysis of the equilibrium binding data for (l)-[3H]DHA in this system is linear. In addition, increasing concentrations of (l)-[3H]DHA during the binding reactions resulted in increasing receptor occupancy but no enhancement of the subsequent dilution-induced dissociation of bound hormone, demonstrating directly that the dissociation rate is independent of occupancy. Furthermore, analysis of the time course of the approach-to-equilibrium for this system at different hormone concentrations was consistent with reversible hormone binding to a homogeneous class of noncooperative receptors, and the analysis yielded a kinetically estimated equilibrium constant consistent with that derived from the linear equilibrium data. The above data indicate that negatively cooperative site-site interactions are not a significant factor for the beta-adrenergic receptor of the frog erythrocyte. These results complete the demonstration that for all known hormone receptor systems, the hormone binds noncooperatively to one or more classes of independent receptor sites. The need for critical reinterpretation of detailed thermodynamic, clinical, and hormone analogue studies based on the negative cooperativity model is discussed.", 
    "41": "The binding of 3H-dihydroalprenolol, a beta-antagonist, with the fat cell plasma membrane was studied in spontaneously hypertensive rats and in patients with essential hypertension. It was found that, as compared to control rats, hypertensive animals had an increased maximum number of 3H-DHA binding sites in the membranes and diminished affinity of beta-adrenoreceptors. It is suggested that these differences may play an essential role in the latered sensitivity to adrenalin in hypertensive rats. Removal of the adrenal, i. e. deprivation of the stabilizing corticosteroid effect, leads to marked changes in the state of the beta-adrenoreceptors in hypertensive animals. Thus, the maximum number of binding sites reduces in hypertensive rats but remains unaltered in the controls; following adrenalectomy the affinity of beta-adrenoreceptors increases in rats with hypertension, but in normal rats, on the contrary, does not change or rather has a tendency to decrease.", 
    "42": "The effects of beta-adrenergic blockade upon myocardial blood flow and oxygen balance during exercise were evaluated in eight conscious dogs, instrumented for chronic measurements of coronary blood flow, left ventricular pressure, aortic blood pressure, heart rate, and sampling of arterial and coronary sinus venous blood. The administration of propranolol (1.5 mg/kg iv) produced a decrease in heart rate, peak left ventricular (LV) dP/dt, LV (dP/dt/P, and an increase in LV end-diastolic pressure during exercise. Mean coronary blood flow and myocardial oxygen consumption were lower after propranolol than at the same exercise intensity in control conditions. The oxygen delivery-to-oxygen consumption ratio and the coronary sinus oxygen content were also significantly lower. It is concluded that the relationship between myocardial oxygen supply and demand is modified during exercise after propranolol, so that a given level of myocardial oxygen consumption is achieved with a proportionally lower myocardial blood flow and a higher oxygen extraction.", 
    "43": "The acute effects of acetaldehyde upon the performance of isolated rat papillary muscle were studied. At high concentrations (50 and 100 mg/100 ml), acetaldehyde demonstrated a negative inotropic effect and abbreviated relaxation time. Pretreatment with either propranolol or reserpine unmasked a direct negative inotropic effect of acetaldehyde at concentrations as low as 5 mg/100 ml. The shortening of relaxation was also blocked by propranolol and reserpine. These findings are compatible with both a direct myocardial depressant effect and an indirect beta-stimulatory effect of acetaldehyde. In the range of concentrations encountered clinically, however, acetaldehyde is not likely to have a significant acute effect upon cardiac muscle performance.", 
    "44": "A radioreceptor assay for the measurement of propranolol and 4-hydroxypropranolol levels in plasma is described. Maximum sensitivity for propranolol was 1.2 +/- 0.15 ng/ml and for 4-hydroxypropranolol 4.2 +/- 0.4 ng/ml. Interassay and intra-assay variations for both were under 10%. Modifications in the radioreceptor assay permitted the measurements of total beta-adrenergic blocking activity and the separate contributions of parent drug and metabolite. When 4-hydroxypropranolol was stabilized, a composite level of total beta-adrenergic blocking activity in plasma was obtained. When the 4-hydroxy metabolite was oxidized, only the stable parent drug was detected. The difference in values between measurements made under these conditions was equivalent to the amount of 4-hydroxypropranolol in the sample. The radioreceptor assay was also used to measure the amount of free propranolol and 4-hydroxypropranolol. Under identical experimental conditions, more 4-hydroxypropranolol than propranolol circulated in the free form. These observations establish the feasibility of adapting the radioreceptor assay for propranolol to the measurement of total beta-adrenergic blocking activity and its components in plasma as well as to the measurement of free drug and metabolite levels.", 
    "45": "The binding of (-)-3H-dihydroalprenolol (3H-DHA) and 125I-hydroxybenzylpindolol (125I-HYP) to the beta-adrenergic receptors in homogenized granulocyte preparations from control subjects and patients with atopic eczema was characterized. No difference was found for the affinity (KD=2 X 10(-9) M) or the total number of high-affinity binding sites (1,200 to 1,600 per cell) with 3H-DHA or 125I-HYP (KD 1.6 X 10(-10) M) in granulocytes from the two study populations. Scatchard plots of the data obtained from DHA binding isotherms suggested that negative cooperativity may exist as a property of the beta 2-receptor. Granulocyte preparations from control subjects and patients with atopic eczema also showed propranolol protectable 3H-DHA binding with a KD of 10(-7) M. It is not clear whether these 3H-DHA binding sites represent physiologically significant beta-adrenergic receptors at these concentrations of radioligand. It was found that 15,000 to 20,000 binding sites of this lower affinity for DHA exist per cell in granulocytes from the two populations of subjects. These data suggest that the reduced isoproterenol responsiveness of granulocytes from patients with atopic eczema is not the result of abnormal or reduced numbers of beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "46": "Modifications in characteristics and activities of beta-adrenergic receptors and certain parameters of the cyclic nucleotide systems were observed in the hypertrophied heart of the rat chronically treated with T4. These include: 1) an increased number of beta-adrenergic receptors without a change in their affinity, as determined by binding of (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol to the membrane; 2) increased sensitivity and magnitude of stimulation of adenylate cyclase in homogenates by isoproterenol, without a change in the basal or NaF-stimulated (total) enzyme activity; 3) decreased formation of cAMP and decreased activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase in the minced heart stimulated by isoproterenol, probably due to decreased myocardial ATP concentration; 4) decreased activity of cAMP phosphodiesterase in the particulate fraction; 5) decreased activity of cGMP-dependent protein kinase in both the soluble and particulate fractions, accompanied by decreased activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase in the particulate fraction; 6) decreased activity of the stimulatory modulator of cGMP-dependent protein kinase and, conversely, increased activity of the inhibitory modulator of cAMP-dependent protein kinase; and 7) increased sensitivity accompanied by decreased maximum tension development of the ventricular strip to contract in response to isoproterenol. These alterations largely disappeared upon regression of the hyperthyroid state. It is suggested that the above changes, many of which were the opposite of those reported earlier for the desensitized and hypertrophied rat heart caused by isoproterenol, may in part consitute the molecular basis for the reputed catecholamine supersensitivity of the heart in the hyperthyroid state.", 
    "47": "ICI 89,406, a new cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist possessing marked intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, was administered (0.04 mg/kg, i.v.) to 10 patients with stable, uncomplicated, exercise-induced angina pectoris and angiographically proven coronary artery disease. The drug resulted in a significant reduction in heart rate (from 125 +/- 5 to 110 +/- 4/min, p less than 0.001), mean systemic arterial pressure (from 147 +/- 4 to 137 +/- 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.01), and electrocardiographic ST-segment depression (from 1.9 +/- 0.5 to 0.8 +/- 0.3 mm, p less than 0.01) without any change in pulmonary arterial or wedge pressure during submaximal supine leg exercise on a bicycle ergometer. These changes were accompanied by a reduction of cardiac output in 6/10 patients and of the duration of pain in 8/10 patients. At rest, all the hemodynamic parameters remained essentially unchanged in comparison with the control study. These studies indicate that ICI 89,406 produces effective beta-adrenoceptor blockade during exercise in patients with angina pectoris. The partial agonist activity of the drug may be responsible for the minimal circulatory response at rest.", 
    "48": "beta-Adrenoceptor stimulating agents possess anti-allergic effects in vitro and in vivo. To study the mechanism of action further we compared in 10 atopic subjects the effects on allergen-induced cutaneous reactions of intradermally (i.d.) injected prenalterol (1-10 microgram) terbutaline (2.5-250 ng) and KWD 2131 (100 ng-2.5 microgram), i.e. compounds with preferential actions on beta 1-, beta 2-adrenoceptors and on beta-adrenoceptors not fitting this classification. All injections were given according to a double-blind design. Terbutaline and KWD 2131 produced a dose-dependent inhibition of the skin reactions induced by injecting horse dander allergen 5 min later. Terbutaline was about 20 times as potent as KWD 2131 whereas prenalterol was inactive. Propranolol fully blocked the anti-allergic effect produced by terbutaline. The results suggest that the cutaneous anti-allergic effect of beta-adrenoceptor-stimulating drugs is mediated via activation of beta 2-adrenoceptors, possibly on the mast cell, resulting in inhibition of mediator release.", 
    "49": "Propranolol (160--240 mg/24 h) and Oxprenolol (80--240 mg/24 h) were given for different periods of time to 13 and, respectively, 7 patients with essential arterial hypertension stage II. Both these beta-blocking drugs induced a significant fall in plasma renin activity : after ten days of treatment, platelet adhesiveness decreased in the patients with a basal level over 50% and increased in those with basal level below 30% (p < 0.01). When this treatment was given for 30 consecutive days, platelet adhesiveness decreased even in the latter patients. The drugs were also found to accelerate dilute blood clot lysis time in patients who presented a delayed lysis time before therapy. Thus, it is inferred that both propranolol and oxprenolol eliminate, at least partly, several factors involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, a frequent complication of essential arterial hypertension.", 
    "50": "The electrical activity of the sinoatrial node was recorded simultaneously from the epicardial and endocardial surfaces of the sinoatrial node in 73 dogs. The electrical activity of sinoatrial node had the form of a slow deflection and a rapid preatrial deflection, the duration of the former being 81 +/- 28 msec and reflecting slow propagation of excitation within the sinus node. Duration of the rapid preatrial deflection was 17 +/- 11 msec. It reflects the rapid propagation of the sinus impulse (probably, the rapid spread of the excitation in corona of the sinus node and invasion in crista terminals). The form and duration of the slow and rapid deflections changed under the influence of drugs.", 
    "51": "This report reviews a number of significant developments in the fields of noradrenergic transmission and adrenergic receptors which suggest that, in addition to the classical postsynaptic adrenoceptors, there are also presynaptic adrenoceptors that help modulate the release of norepinephrine (NE) from peripheral as well as central noradrenergic nerve endings during nerve stimulation. In particular, stimulation of presynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors reduces this release of transmitter and the reverse is observed after blockade of these receptors. Clearcut pharmacological differences exist between the postsynaptic alpha 1-adrenoceptors that mediate the responses of certain organs and the presynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors that modulate the NE release during nerve stimulation. Therefore, subclassification of alpha-adrenoceptors into alpha 1 and alpha 2 subtypes is warranted but must be considered to be independent of the anatomical location of these receptors. Some noradrenergic nerve endings have also been shown to possess beta-adrenergic receptors, the stimulation of which increases the quantity of transmitter released by nerve impulses. Physiologically, these receptors could be activated by circulating epinephrine (E) and be involved in essential hypertension. A third type of catecholamine receptor found at the noradrenergic nerve ending is the inhibitory dopamine (DA) receptor, which might be of significance in the development of new antihypertensive agents. Application of these new concepts of noradrenergic neurotransmission and the subclassification of alpha-adrenoceptors to the treatment of hypertension is presented. Clonidine, for example, appears to be a potent alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist; the central receptor involved in its antihypertensive action is pharmacologically an alpha 2-type but located postsynaptically. Clonidine also induces activation of peripheral presynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors, which might contribute to its cardiovascular action. The antihypertensive effects of alpha-methyldopa are related to the formation of alpha-methylnorepinephrine, a preferential alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, which can stimulate peripheral presynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors leading to a decrease of NE release and a reduction in sympathetic tone. Prazosin is a new antihypertensive agent the mechanism of action of which involves a selective blockade of postsynaptic alpha 1-adrenoceptors. This drug does not antagonize several effects of clonidine that are mediated via alpha 2-adrenoceptors. The mechanisms presently considered to account for the antihypertensive activity of beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents are numerous. It is proposed that blockade of peripheral presynaptic facilitatory beta-adrenoceptors could be of significance in the antihypertensive action of these drugs."
