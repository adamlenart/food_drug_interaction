The use of beta-adrenergic receptor blockers in patients with heart failure is counterintuitive, however, because they are known to decrease contractility in normal hearts. The ryanodine receptor (RyR2) on cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum is the key calcium release channel required for excitation-contraction coupling. In failing hearts, the stoichiometry and function of the RyR2 macromolecular complex is altered. Decreased levels of phosphatases (PP1 and PP2A) and hyperphosphorylation by protein kinase A result in dissociation of the regulatory protein FKBP12.6 and channels with increased open probability.",

Stereoselective resolution of the arotinolol enantiomers was achieved using 5 mM sodium taurocholate in 10 mM sodium dihydrogen phosphate buffer of pH 2.5. A 72-cm uncoated fused-silica capillary at a constant voltage of 15 kV was used for the analysis. The analytes of interest were extracted from serum using solid phase extraction. An octadecyl cartridge gave good recoveries in excess of 87% for both +S and -R arotinolol without any interference. The calibration curves were linear over the range of 50-500 ng ml(-1) with +S propranolol as the internal standard and the coefficient of determination was greater than 0.999 (n = 3). The limit of quantitation was 50 ng ml(-1) for each enantiomer and the detection limit using 1 ml serum and a UV detection set et 220 nm was 25 ng ml(-1) (S/N = 2). Precision and accuracy of the method were in the range 0.8-2.7% and 1.2-6.4%, respectively, for +S arotinolol and 1.1-3.9% and 2.2-6.5%, respectively, for -R arotinolol.",

Six women taking oral contraceptives underwent whole-body cooling during high-hormone (HH) and low-hormone (LH) phases of oral contraceptive use. SkBF was monitored by laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) at sites treated by intradermal injection of yohimbine-propranolol (5 mM and 1 mM; YOPR) to block the effects of norepinephrine (NE) or at saline (Sal) control sites. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was measured with the use of the Penaz method. Cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC = LDF/mean arterial pressure) was expressed as a percentage of baseline. Whole body skin temperature was decreased from 34 to 31 degrees C in HH and LH. In both HH and LH, CVC at Sal-treated sites was reduced during cooling (CVC = 53.1 +/- 8.6% and 54.4 +/- 4.2%, both P < 0.05). In HH, CVC at YOPR sites was reduced during cooling (78.8 +/- 3.6%, P < 0.05). In contrast, CVC at YOPR sites was not reduced significantly during cooling in LH (CVC = 95.9 +/- 2.8%, P > 0.05). Across phases, CVC at YOPR sites during cooling was significantly different (P < 0.05). After cooling, the effects of NE at YOPR sites were completely blocked. These data indicate that a nonnoradrenergic mechanism of reflex cutaneous vasoconstriction is present in women and is associated with reproductive hormone status.", 
    "13": "Hypertension and diabetes are becoming increasingly common. Most patients with both disorders have a markedly worsened risk for premature microvascular and macrovascular complications. The appropriate management of the hypertension seen in almost 70% of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus remains controversial. However, over the past few years, many randomized, controlled trials have provided guidance for more effective therapy. These trials have established the need for a lower goal blood pressure (<130/80 mm Hg) than has previously been recommended. In addition, they have proven the efficacy of drugs from three major classes of antihypertensive agents; however, comparative trials have failed to show definite superiority of any particular class in either lowering blood pressure or reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. To achieve therapy goals, multiple antihypertensive drugs are usually needed. On the basis of their apparent superiority in slowing diabetic nephropathy, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors should probably be the first choice. Second and third choices should be a long-acting diuretic and a calcium-channel blocker or a beta-blocker, respectively. Attention should also be directed toward nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic control of hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia.",

Postoperative atrial fibrillation is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and longer, more expensive hospital stays. Prophylactic use of beta-adrenergic blockers reduces the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation and should be administered before and after cardiac surgery to all patients without contraindication. Prophylactic amiodarone and atrial overdrive pacing should be considered in patients at high risk for postoperative atrial fibrillation (for example, patients with previous atrial fibrillation or mitral valve surgery). For patients who develop atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery, a strategy of rhythm management or rate management should be selected. For patients who are hemodynamically unstable or highly symptomatic or who have a contraindication to anticoagulation, rhythm management with electrical cardioversion, amiodarone, or both is preferred. Treatment of the remaining patients should focus on rate control because most will spontaneously revert to sinus rhythm within 6 weeks after discharge.

A micellar solution of O-palmitoyl tilisolol (PalTL), an amphiphilic prodrug, was prepared. After instillation of tilisolol (TL) and PalTL, the drug concentrations in the tear fluid, cornea, aqueous humor, iris-ciliary body, vitreous body, and blood were measured. In addition, in situ ocular absorption behavior was also evaluated. After instillation of TL, the concentration of TL in the tear fluid quickly decreased. After instillation of PalTL, prolonged retention and high concentrations of PalTL in tear fluid and the cornea were observed. In addition, more prolonged retention of the TL concentration after instillation of PalTL than after instillation of TL was observed in the cornea, aqueous humor, and iris-ciliary body. In situ experiments demonstrated that PalTL was mainly absorbed by the corneal route and the improvement effects of PalTL under in vivo conditions was due to an enhanced transit time of PalTL in ocular tissues. PalTL, an amphiphilic prodrug, exhibited increased retention in the precorneal area compared with the parent drug, TL, resulted in improved ocular absorption of the parent drug.", 
    "21": "There has been a tendency to treat paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) in a similar way to sustained AF, but treatment objectives may be very different. We discuss current definitions, epidemiology, pathophysiology and natural history of PAF, and review evidence for its treatment and management. PAF comprises between 25% and 62% of cases of AF, with similar underlying causes to those in sustained AF. The main objective of management is prevention of paroxysms and long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm, and Class 1c drugs are highly effective, although beta-blockers are useful alternatives. If patients have severe coronary artery disease or poor ventricular function, amiodarone is probably the drug of choice. Although randomized controlled trials of thromboprophylaxis in patients with paroxysmal AF per se are lacking, the approach to patients with paroxysmal AF should be similar to that in patients with sustained AF, with warfarin for 'high risk' patients and aspirin for those at 'low risk'. Non-pharmacological therapeutic options, including pacemakers, electrophysiological techniques and the implantable atrial defibrillator, show great promise. Despite paroxysmal AF being a common condition, management strategies are limited by evidence from small randomized trials, with inconsistencies over the definition of the arrhythmia and the inclusion of only symptomatic subjects. Evidence for antithrombotic therapy is also based on epidemiological studies and subgroup analyses of the large randomized trials.", 
    "22": "1. Intracellular in vitro recordings were made from 771 cells from the spiral modiolar artery (SMA). The initial resting potentials (RPs) displayed a bimodal distribution that was well modelled as a mixture of two Gaussian distributions. About half of the cells had an average RP of -74 mV, and were termed high-RP cells, whereas the other half had an average RP around -41 mV, and were termed low-RP cells. Preparations that were incubated for longer than 24 h contained significantly more high-RP cells than those incubated for less than 8 h. 2. When labelled with the fluorescent dye propidium iodide, 68 and 36 cells were identified as smooth muscle cells (SMC) and endothelial cells (EC), respectively. The RP and input resistance were not significantly different between these two types of cell. Dye coupling was observed only in ECs. Dual cell recordings with 0.2-1.0 mm separation demonstrated the simultaneous existence of high- and low-RP cells and a heterogeneous low-strength electrical coupling. 3. The high-RP cells were depolarized by ACh and by high extracellular potassium concentration (high K(+)). The low-RP cells were usually hyperpolarized by moderately high K(+) (7.5-20 mM) and by ACh. The high K(+)-induced hyperpolarization was suppressed by barium (Ba(2+), 10-50 microM). The putative gap junction blocker 18 beta-glycyrrhetinic acid suppressed the ACh-induced responses in SMCs, but not in ECs. 4. Low-RP cells could rapidly shift the membrane potential to a permanent high-RP state spontaneously or, more often, after a brief application of hyperpolarizing agents including high K(+), ACh, nitric oxide and pinacidil. Once shifted to a high-RP state, the responses of these cells to high K(+) and ACh became similar to those of the original high-RP cells. 5. High-RP cells occasionally shifted their potentials to a low-RP state either spontaneously or after a brief application of 10-50 microM Ba(2+) or 100 microM ouabain. Once shifted to the low-RP state, the response of these cells to high K(+) and ACh became a hyperpolarization. The shift between high- and low-RP states was largely mimicked by wash-in and wash-out of low concentrations of Ba(2+). The shift often showed a regenerative process as a fast phase in its middle course. 6. It is concluded that the cochlear SMA in vitro is composed of poorly and heterogeneously coupled SMCs and ECs, simultaneously resting in one of two distinct states, one a high-RP state and the other a low-RP state. The two RP states are exchangeable mainly due to all-or-none-like conductance changes of the inward-rectifier K(+) channel.",

The need for accurate evaluation will increase further as other new antipsychotic medications are developed.

Criteria for treatment-resistance are presented to help in standardizing treatment and clinical trials. As clinicians face the decision of when to change or augment antipsychotic medications, a clear understanding of the appropriate length of a treatment trial and which target symptoms respond to antipsychotic therapy is critical for maximizing response in patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia.", 
    "29": "Carvedilol (20 mg/kg, bid) or vehicle was given to rats surviving a myocardial infarction (MI) 24 h (n = 409). In rats with large MI, carvedilol partially preserved left ventricular (LV) function and intrinsic myocardial contractility and reactivity to beta-adrenergic stimulation. Carvedilol led to scar thickening, increased LV hypertrophy, and decreased cardiac fibrosis but did not prevent LV dilatation. Carvedilol reduced cardiac expression of interleukin-1beta but did not prevent cardiac fetal gene re-expression or modify cardiac oxidative stress. Despite these beneficial effects, carvedilol decreased survival (38.8%, versus vehicle, 50.6%) due to excessive early mortality. Thus, post-MI carvedilol has many beneficial effects, however, in this study it increased post-MI mortality, perhaps due to excessive hypotension.", 
    "30": "In vitro studies have shown that beta-blockers are taken up into and released from adrenergic cells together with epinephrine and norepinephrine. Consequently, studies in humans revealed an increase in plasma concentrations of propranolol and atenolol during physical exercise. However, carvedilol has not been investigated in a similar fashion. Eleven hypertensive patients on long-term treatment (4 months) with carvedilol followed an exercise regimen. Plasma concentrations of carvedilol were determined at rest (9.7 +/- 3.4 ng/ml), during exercise (9.0 +/- 3.2 ng/ml), and after 15 min of recovery (9.1 +/- 2.7 ng/ml). Contrary to predictions, exercise had no effect on plasma concentrations of carvedilol, a finding that is in contrast to other beta-blockers. We conclude that carvedilol is not taken up into and released from adrenergic nerves during exercise, a feature that clearly distinguishes carvedilol from all other beta-adrenergic antagonists so far investigated.",

Cox regression analysis adjusted for cardiovascular risks revealed that increased postural change (supine to upright) in the power of low-frequency component (LF) power predicted an increased risk for cardiac death (relative risk [per 1-ln ms(2) increment], 4.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.64 to 11.6), while neither the high-frequency component nor its response to HUTT predicted any form of death.

Electrophysiologic studies have revealed that these drugs cause a moderate prolongation of action potential duration (APD) of ventricular muscles with minimal \"reverse frequency-dependence\" through different ionic mechanisms. Carvedilol blocks L-type Ca2+ current (ICa), transient outward K+ current (Ito), and delayed rectifier K+ current (IK) preferentially for the rapidly activating component (IKr). Vesnarinone is a selective blocker of IK with a unique drug-channel interaction. From the voltage- and time-dependence of IK inhibition, vesnarinone is considered to bind the IK (mainly IKr) channel during the activated state and unbind during the closed state. These electropharmacologic profiles provide a new approach for the development of an ideal antiarrhythmic drugs in patients with structural heart diseases.",

Our lab developed proniosomes, a dry formulation using a sorbitol carrier coated with nonionic surfactant, which can be used to produce niosomes within minutes by the addition of hot water followed by agitation. The sorbitol carrier in the original proniosomes was soluble in the solvent used to deposit surfactant, so preparation was tedious and the dissolved sorbitol interfered with the encapsulation of one model drug. A novel method is reported here for rapid preparation of proniosomes with a wide range of surfactant loading. A slurry method has been developed to produce proniosomes using maltodextrin as the carrier. The time required to produce proniosomes by this simple method is independent of the ratio of surfactant solution to carrier material and appears to be scalable. The flexibility of the proniosome preparation method would allow for the optimization of drug encapsulation in the final formulation based on the type and amount of maltodextrin. This formulation of proniosomes is a practical and simple method of producing niosomes at the point of use for drug delivery.", 
    "37": "The objectives were 1) to design a continuous dissolution/Caco-2 system to predict the dissolution-absorption relationships for fast and slow dissolving formulations of piroxicam, metoprolol tartrate, and ranitidine HCl, and compare the predicted relationships with observed relationships from clinical studies; 2) to estimate the effect of croscarmellose sodium on ranitidine dissolution-absorption relationships; and 3) to estimate the effect of solubilizing agents on piroxicam dissolution-absorption relationships. A continuous dissolution/Caco-2 system was constructed from a dissolution apparatus and a diffusion cell, such that drug dissolution and permeation across a Caco-2 monolayer would occur sequentially and simultaneously. The continuous system generally matched observed dissolution-absorption relationships from clinical studies. For example, the system successfully predicted the slow metoprolol and slow ranitidiine formulations to be permeation-rate-limited. The system predicted the slow piroxicam formulation to be dissolution-rate-limited, and the fast piroxicam formulation to be permeation-rate-limited, in spite of piroxicam's high permeability and low solubility. Additionally, the system indicated croscarmellose sodium enhanced ranitidine permeability and predicted solubilizing agents to not modulate permeability. These results suggest a dissolution/Caco-2 system to be an experimentally based tool that may predict dissolution-absorption relationships from oral solid dosage forms, and hence the relative contributions of dissolution and permeation to oral drug absorption kinetics.", 
    "38": "Whereas there is some degree of coronary artery disease (CAD) in most patients undergoing vascular surgery, there is no consensus regarding how to avoid perioperative cardiac ischemic events. Although this edition of Seminars in Vascular Surgery is devoted to aortic surgery, it must be remembered that the incidence of adverse cardiac outcomes after infrainguinal operations is at least as great as after aortic procedures. Thus, much of the information discussed herein will be applicable to patients undergoing all varieties of vascular surgery. Numerous strategies exist for preoperative cardiac testing before vascular operations. These strategies range from routine evaluation before surgery to a \"minimalist\" approach, treating all patients as though CAD was present. Although advocates of various algorithms often are unwavering in their convictions, there are no randomized, prospective studies comparing different strategies for evaluation and management of patients with CAD undergoing vascular surgery. Potential adverse effects of evaluation and cardiac intervention should be considered before undertaking screening studies. The authors analyzed the adverse outcomes of preoperative cardiac evaluation and intervention before vascular operations in patients treated at the Denver Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Of 153 patients undergoing vascular procedures, 42 had extended cardiac evaluations. Sixteen (38%) patients had untoward events related to this evaluation. Extensive cardiac evaluation before vascular operations can result in morbidity, delays, and refusal to undergo vascular surgery. The underlying indication for vascular operations and the local iatrogenic cardiac complication rates should be considered before ordering special studies. Several recent randomized, prospective studies have established that perioperative beta-adrenergic blockade is beneficial in vascular patients with CAD. Beta-Blocker therapy can reduce the risk of perioperative adverse cardiac outcomes by 55%. The Coronary Artery Revascularization Prophylaxis (CARP) trial currently underway is a multicenter, prospective comparison of invasive intervention for CAD versus best medical care in patients undergoing aortic and lower extremity vascular surgery funded by the Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program.",

A number of trials have widely shown that it is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This review focuses the prevalence of isolated systolic hypertension, its pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment. The optimal treatment strategy is to maximize reduction in systolic blood pressure and to minimize reduction in diastolic blood pressure. All classes of antihypertensive agents can be used, but calcium antagonists, ACE-inhibitors and, more recently, the angiotensin II antagonists appear to be more successful in improving large artery stiffness and therefore are especially useful in treating isolated systolic hypertension in the elderly. A careful evaluation and treatment has to be made in particular in those patients with more risk factors, in order to choose the most appropriate drug and to avoid dangerous drug-drug interactions where polypharmacy occurs.",

In prepubertal female pigs anesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone, changes in the superior mesenteric, left renal and left external iliac flow caused by intravenous infusion of progesterone were assessed using electromagnetic flow meters. Changes in heart rate and arterial blood pressure were prevented by atrial pacing and by connecting the arterial system to a pressurized reservoir containing Ringer solution. In 20 pigs, infusion of 1 mg/kg of progesterone increased mesenteric, renal and iliac flow. In a further 4 pigs, the vasodilatory effects of the hormone were enhanced by graded increases in the dose between 1, 2 and 3 mg/kg. The mechanisms of these responses were studied in the 20 pigs by repeating the experiment after hemodynamic variables had returned to the control values before infusion. In 5 pigs, blockade of adrenergic receptors with propranolol and phentolamine did not affect the responses elicited by progesterone. The increases in mesenteric, renal and iliac flow to progesterone were prevented, respectively, by the injection of N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester into the mesenteric (5 pigs), the renal (5 pigs) or the iliac artery (5 pigs). The present study shows that intravenous infusion of progesterone dilated mesenteric, renal and iliac circulations. The mechanism of this response involved the release of nitric oxide.",

Homologues of human NAT are present in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium smegmatis, where they can acetylate, and hence inactivate, INH. The in vivo role of mycobacterial NAT is not known but heterologous expression of the M. tuberculosis gene increases the INH resistance. The 0.85 kb nat gene is part of a gene cluster in M. smegmatis. The gene is transcribed as a large, 7.5 kb mRNA as demonstrated by Northern analysis. A nat knockout strain of M. smegmatis was generated by targeted disruption. The new strain was confirmed to be devoid of NAT activity. The growth of the knockout strain is considerably delayed compared with the wild-type, due to an extended lag phase. The knockout mutant has an increased sensitivity to INH as would be predicted. The NATs from M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis have a high degree of homology, except in the region of the C terminus. A specific polyclonal antiserum raised against recombinant NAT protein from M. tuberculosis is described that recognizes a stretch of about twenty residues within the C terminus of M. tuberculosis NAT. This highly specific antiserum will enable comparison of nat expression between isolates of M. tuberculosis.",

Twenty-four-hour catecholamine excretion was used as a measure of activity of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the plasma [Trp]/[NAA] ratio was measured to estimate (rate limiting) precursor availability for brain 5-hydroxytryptamine synthesis. All measurements were repeated after the subjects had been treated to establish euthyroidism. In addition, the effects of nonselective beta-adrenoceptor blockade upon these parameters were studied to evaluate the influence of beta-adrenergic hyperactivity on food intake. Hyperthyroidism was marked by increased SNS activity and reduced plasma [Trp]/[NAA] ratio. Accordingly, energy intake was considerably and significantly increased in hyper vs. euthyroidism, which was fully attributable to enhanced carbohydrate consumption, as protein and fat intake were not affected. These results suggest that hyperthyroidism alters the neurophysiology of food intake regulation. Increased SNS activity and reduced Trp precursor availability for 5-hydroxytryptamine synthesis in the brain may drive the marked hyperphagia and craving for carbohydrates that appears to characterize hyperthyroid patients. Because propranolol did not affect food intake in hyperthyroidism, the potential effect of catecholamines on food intake might be mediated by alpha-adrenoceptors.",

    "50": "1. The effects of tachykinin NK(1), NK(2) and NK(3) receptor agonists and antagonists were measured on blood pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) after bilateral microinjection into the substantia nigra (SN) of awake, unrestrained rats. 2. Increasing doses (25 pmol - 1 nmol) of selective agonists at NK(1) ([Sar(9),Met(O(2))(11)]SP), NK(2) ([beta-Ala(8)]NKA(4 - 10)) and NK(3) (senktide) receptors into the SN produced tachycardia which was selectively and reversibly blocked by the prior injection of tachykinin antagonists at NK(1) (RP67580, 250 pmol), NK(2) (SR48968, 250 pmol) and NK(3) (R-820, 500 pmol) receptor. A rapid fall in MAP followed by a pressor response was seen with 1 nmol of [Sar(9),Met(O(2))(11)]SP. Behavioural activity was elicited by 1 nmol of [Sar(9),Met(O(2)(11)]SP (sniffing > face washing = grooming) and senktide (sniffing > wet dog shake > rearing = locomotion). Tachykinin antagonists had no direct cardiovascular or behavioural effects. 3. The tachycardia produced by 100 pmol of [beta-Ala(8)]NKA(4 - 10) or senktide was abolished by an i.v. treatment with atenolol (beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, 5 mg kg(-1)) while that evoked by [Sar(9),Met(O(2))(11)]SP was reduced. A combination of atenolol (5 mg kg(-1)) and atropine (muscarinic antagonist, 1 mg kg(-1)) blocked the response evoked by [Sar(9),Met(O(2))(11)]SP. 4. These data suggest that the SN is a potential site of modulation of cardiac activity by tachykinins. In addition to the withdrawal of the cardiovagal activity by NK(1) receptor, the three tachykinin receptors appear to increase the sympatho/adrenal drive to the heart. This occurs independently of changes in MAP and behaviour. Hence, this study highlights a new central regulatory mechanism of cardiac autonomic activity.", 
    "51": "1. Cibenzoline, (+/-)-2-(2,2-diphenylcyclopropyl-2-imidazoline succinate, has been clinically used as one of the Class I type antiarrhythmic agents and also reported to block ATP-sensitive K(+) channels in excised membranes from heart and pancreatic beta cells. In the present study, we investigated if this drug inhibited gastric H(+),K(+)-ATPase activity in vitro. 2. Cibenzoline inhibited H(+),K(+)-ATPase activity of permeabilized leaky hog gastric vesicles in a concentration-dependent manner (IC(50): 201 microM), whereas no effect was shown on Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity of dog kidney (IC(50): >1000 microM). Similarly, cibenzoline inhibited H(+),K(+)-ATPase activity of HEK-293 cells (human embryonic kidney cell line) co-transfected with rabbit gastric H(+),K(+)-ATPase alpha- and beta-subunit cDNAs (IC(50): 183 microM). 3. In leaky gastric vesicles, inhibition of H(+),K(+)-ATPase activity by cibenzoline was attenuated by the addition of K(+) (0.5 - 5 mM) in a concentration-dependent manner. The Lineweaver-Burk plot of the H(+),K(+)-ATPase activity shows that cibenzoline increases K(m) value for K(+) without affecting V(max), indicating that this drug inhibits H(+),K(+)-ATPase activity competitively with respect to K(+). 4. The inhibitory effect of H(+),K(+)-ATPase activity by cibenzoline with normal tight gastric vesicles did not significantly differ from that with permeabilized leaky gastric vesicles, indicating that this drug reacted to the ATPase from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. 5. These findings suggest that cibenzoline is an inhibitor of gastric H(+),K(+)-ATPase with a novel inhibition mechanism, which inhibits gastric H(+),K(+)-ATPase by binding its K(+)-recognition site from the cytoplasmic side.", 
    "52": "The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of oestrogen receptor (ER) beta activation on vascular protein synthesis and protein expression. Nuclear immunoreactivity towards ER beta was observed abundantly in vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells of mouse aorta. No ER alpha-positive cell nuclei were observed. In aorta from ovariectomized mice, treatment with the selective ER beta agonist genistein (100 nM) for 24 h increased [(3)H]leucine incorporation by about 30%. This effect was prevented by the ER blocker ICI 182780 (10 microM). Although genistein treatment stimulated protein synthesis, it caused no change in total protein determined either by the Lowry method on tissue homogenate or by densitometric scanning of protein bands (10-220 kDa) separated by SDS-PAGE. Separation of [(35)S]methionine-labelled proteins by SDS-PAGE did not reveal the protein(s) stimulated by genistein. DNA synthesis was not affected by 100 nM genistein, suggesting that genistein-induced stimulation of protein synthesis is not part of a growth response. Protein expression, determined by SDS-PAGE, was similar in aorta from ER beta-knockout and wild-type mice, suggesting that expression of vascular proteins does not depend solely on a functional ER beta gene. We suggest that activation of vascular ER beta stimulates synthesis of proteins and that this response is not associated with vascular growth.", 
    "53": "Cadmium-induced stress adversely affects testicular activity and causes sympathetic stimulation. To investigate the effect of atenolol, a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker, on testicular androgen synthesis after cadmium treatment, adult Sprague-Dawley strain male rats were given a single sc dose of cadmium chloride 0.45 mg/kg BW. Animals were killed on day 3 after treatment. Adrenal weight, adrenal delta 5-3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (delta 5-3 beta-HSD) activity, serum corticosterone, and brain noradrenaline were increased significantly while testicular delta 5-3 beta-HSD and 17 beta-HSD activities, serum testosterone, and accessory sex organs weight were decreased. Oral coadministration of atenolol at a dose of 2.0 mg/kg body weight for 3 days resulted in complete protection of adrenal delta 5-3 beta-HSD, testicular delta 5-3 beta-HSD, and 17 beta-HSD activities, adrenal weight, serum corticosterone, and serum testosterone when compared with cadmium-only group and there were no significant differences in these parameters from the vehicle control values. Simultaneous administration of cadmium and atenolol also protected brain noradrenaline content and reduced the rise of testicular cadmium concentration. All the parameters were similar to control levels in rats treated with atenolol alone. We conclude that atenolol may protect testicular androgen synthesis by inhibiting the action of noradrenaline on testicular Leydig cells and adrenocortical hyperactivity in cadmium-treated rats.",

The standard radioligand for autoradiography of beta-adrenoceptors, [125I]-iodocyanopindolol, was also included in this survey. All compounds showed either very low uptake in rat brain or a regional distribution that was not related to beta-adrenoceptors, whereas some ligands did display specific binding in heart and lungs.

    "69": "The presence of an altered renal function in essential hypertension, advanced heart failure (HF) and after a myocardial infarction (MI) is associated with higher cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Indices of altered renal function (e.g., microalbuminuria, increased serum creatinine concentrations, decrease in estimated creatinine clearance or overt proteinuria) are independent predictors of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in any of the three clinical situations. These parameters should then be routinely evaluated in clinical practice. These facts have several therapeutic implications. First, although there is no evidence-based information on the level of blood pressure that confers optimal renal protection, levels substantially lower than past recommendations are advisable. Second, hypertensive kidney damage should be prevented by early treatment of hypertensive patients, particularly those with microalbuminuria. Finally, to avoid further aggravation of high cardiovascular risk, antihypertensive agents devoid of unwanted metabolic side effects should be used for the treatment of hypertensive vascular damage. In HF, the combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and a beta-blocker seem to be the most renoprotective. Renal outcome is also improved by ACE inhibition after an MI. Finally, renal and cardiovascular outcome seem to run in parallel in all these situations.",

Relatively little attention, however, has focused on adrenoceptors from early branching vertebrates such as fish. Using an RT-PCR approach we have cloned a rainbow trout beta2-adrenoceptor gene that codes for a 409-amino-acid protein with the same seven transmembrane domain structure as its mammalian counterparts. This rainbow trout beta2-adrenoceptor shares a high degree of amino-acid sequence conservation with other vertebrate beta2-adrenoceptors. The conclusion that this sequence is a rainbow trout beta2-adrenoceptor is further supported by phylogenetic analysis of vertebrate beta-adrenoceptor sequences and competitive pharmacological binding data. RNase protection assays demonstrate that the rainbow trout beta2-adrenoceptor gene is highly expressed in the liver and red and white muscle, with lower levels of expression in the gills, heart, kidney and spleen of the rainbow trout. The lack of regulatory phosphorylation sites within the G-protein-binding domain of the rainbow trout beta2-adrenoceptor sequence suggests that the in vivo control of trout beta2-adrenoceptor signaling differs substantially from that of mammals.",

Since transient beta-adrenergic stimulation (5 min) stimulates p38 MAPK activation and mimics the cardioprotection of ischaemic preconditioning, it was used as a tool to further evaluate the role of this kinase in cardioprotection. The isolated perfused working rat heart, subjected to 25 min ischaemia and 30 min reperfusion was used as experimental model. p38 MAPK and ATF2 activation was determined using Western blots. The results showed that isoproterenol stimulated p38 MAPK in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Ischaemia-induced activation of p38 MAPK could be partially abolished by beta- and alpha1-adrenergic receptor blockade. Isoproterenol activation of the kinase could be abolished by alprenolol and verapamil, but not by 8-cyclopentyladenosine. p38 MAPK activation induced by either a multi-episode preconditioning protocol or isoproterenol (10(-7) M for 5 min) was associated with a significant reduction in p38 MAPK activation at all time intervals studied during 25 min global ischaemia and at 20 and 30 min of reperfusion, compared with the marked activation observed in untreated non-preconditioned hearts. In each case attenuation of p38 MAPK activation during ischaemia and during reperfusion was associated with improved functional recovery during reperfusion. Cyclic elevations in tissue cAMP during an ischaemic preconditioning protocol acted as trigger of cardioprotection, since pretreatment of such hearts with alprenolol abolished cardioprotection. Mechanical failure in such hearts was characterized by a significant stimulation of p38 MAPK activity during ischaemia and reperfusion. However, p38 MAPK activation during an ischaemic preconditioning protocol did not act as trigger: inhibition of p38 MAPK activation by SB 203580 during the preconditioning phase did not abolish cardioprotection. In fact, functional recovery was significantly better than that of untreated preconditioned hearts. On the other hand, SB 203580, when administered before and during the isoproterenol-preconditioning protocol abolished cardioprotection, suggesting that p38 MAPK activation by a beta -adrenergic-induced preconditioning protocol does act as trigger of cardioprotection. In addition, attenuation of p38 MAPK activity during sustained ischaemia and reperfusion as occurs in ischaemic- or isoproterenol-preconditioned hearts, is beneficial.",

We examined whether the extent of myocardial injury, as assessed by iodine-123 15-( p-iodophenyl)-3- R, S-methylpentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) myocardial scintigraphy, is related to the response of patients with DCM to beta-blockade therapy. Thirty-seven patients with DCM were examined using BMIPP myocardial scintigraphy before and after 6 months of treatment with metoprolol. Myocardial BMIPP uptake (%BM uptake) was estimated quantitatively as a percentage of the total injected count ratio. The left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions (LVDd, LVDs) and ejection fraction (LVEF) were also evaluated. The patients were divided into two groups according to their functional improvement (>10% elevation of LVEF) after 6 months of metoprolol therapy. Twenty-eight patients responded to the therapy, while nine did not. Prior to the therapy, no significant differences in LVDd, LVDs or LVEF were observed between the responders and non-responders. However, the %BM uptake was significantly lower in the non-responders than in the responders (1.0%+/-0.2% vs 2.1%+/-0.5%, P<0.001). The %BM uptake could be used to distinguish the responders from the non-responders with a sensitivity of 0.93 and a specificity of 1.00 at a threshold value of 1.4. After the metoprolol therapy, the %BM uptake improved significantly in the responders (2.5%+/-0.5%, P<0.01) but did not change in the non-responders. These results indicate that myocardial BMIPP uptake could predict the response of DCM patients to beta-blockade therapy.", 
    "88": "Angiogenesis and microvascular remodeling are known features of chronic inflammatory diseases such as asthma and chronic bronchitis, but the mechanisms and consequences of the changes are just beginning to be elucidated. In a model of chronic airway inflammation produced by Mycoplasma pulmonis infection of the airways of mice or rats, angiogenesis and microvascular remodeling create vessels that mediate leukocyte influx and leak plasma proteins into the airway mucosa. These vascular changes are driven by the immune response to the organisms. Plasma leakage results from gaps between endothelial cells, as well as from increased vascular surface area and probably other changes in the newly formed and remodeled blood vessels. Treatment with long-acting beta2 agonists can reduce but not eliminate the plasma occurring after infection. In addition to the elevated baseline leakage, the remodeled vessels in the airway mucosa are abnormally sensitive to substance P, but not to platelet-activating factor or serotonin, suggesting that the infection leads to a selective upregulation of NK1 receptors on the vasculature. The formation of new vessels and the remodeling of existing vessels are likely to be induced by multiple growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin 1 (Ang1). VEGF increases vascular permeability, but Ang1 has the opposite effect. This feature is consistent with evidence that VEGF and Ang1 play complementary and coordinated roles in vascular growth and remodeling and have powerful effects on vascular function. Regulation of vascular permeability by VEGF and Ang1 may be their most rapid and potent actions in the adult, as these effects can occur independent of their effects on angiogenesis and vascular remodeling. The ability of Ang1 to block plasma leakage without producing angiogenesis may be therapeutically advantageous. Furthermore, because VEGF and Ang1 have additive effects in promoting angiogenesis but opposite effects on vascular permeability, they could be used together to avoid the formation of leaky vessels in therapeutic angiogenesis. Finally, the elucidation of the protective effect of Ang1 on blood vessel leakiness to plasma proteins raises the possibility of a new strategy for reducing airway edema in inflammatory airway diseases such as asthma and chronic bronchitis.", 
    "89": "The present study was designed to investigate which subtype of spinal 5-HT receptors were involved in acetaminophen-induced antinociception using the paw-pressure test. Propacetamol (prodrug of acetaminophen, 400 mg/kg, injected intravenously, corresponding to 200 mg/kg of acetaminophen) produced a significant antinociceptive effect in this test. This effect was at least partially inhibited by intrathecal (i.t.) pretreatment with the 5-HT(1B) (penbutolol), 5-HT(2A) (ketanserin), 5-HT(2C) (mesulergine) receptor antagonists, but not by the 5-HT(1A) (N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide trihydrochloride, WAY 100635) and 5-HT(3) (granisetron) receptor antagonists. This profile was very close to that obtained recently with 5-HT, which suggests an implication of 5-HT in the spinal antinociceptive effect of acetaminophen. These results, the lack of binding of acetaminophen to 5-HT receptors and the increase of central 5-HT levels induced by this drug suggest that acetaminophen-induced antinociception could be indirectly mediated by 5-HT.", 
    "90": "Hypertension is often poorly controlled despite its importance and despite the availability of very effective treatments. Many factors contribute to poor control, including failure of patients to attend physicians, failure of physicians to detect and adequately treat hypertension to goal levels, and failure of patients to persist with prescribed therapy. An under-recognized problem is the failure, both in writing and in the application by third party payers, of consensus guidelines to recognize the important difference between efficacy in clinical trials and effectiveness in clinical practice. The issue of applicability of guidelines to actual practice was studied in the context of a Canadian Family Medicine teaching practice. At the time of the study, consensus guidelines for management of hypertension recommended that drug therapy be initiated with a beta-blocker or diuretic, except for patients with complicated hypertension for whom these drug classes are relatively contraindicated. It was generally assumed that widespread use of other classes of drugs represented inappropriate and wasteful use of resources. By a retrospective chart audit, we determined the proportion of patients in a family practice for whom therapy with a beta-blocker or diuretic was contraindicated, and examined the compliance of the physicians in the practice with guidelines. We found that about half of hypertensives had conditions for which recommended therapy is not a beta-blocker or diuretic. Thus, failure of physicians to follow guidelines is apparently less inappropriate than is widely perceived.",

    "94": "Although beta blockers have had significant impact in the treatment of portal hypertension, the question of how long they should be continued for prevention of variceal hemorrhage remains unknown. Prospective studies on beta blockers to prevent variceal hemorrhage lack long-term follow-up, and indefinite administration of beta blockers for primary prevention of variceal bleeding has become standard practice. The aim of this study was to determine the outcomes of patients in whom beta blocker therapy was discontinued. Patients completing a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of propranolol for the primary prevention of variceal hemorrhage were tapered off of propranolol and placebo and followed prospectively for subsequent events. Of the 49 patients in the follow-up study (25 former propranolol, 24 former placebo), 9 experienced variceal hemorrhage (6 former propranolol, 3 former placebo). Following withdrawal of propranolol, the freedom from variceal bleeding was not significantly different between these 2 groups of patients, suggesting that the protective effect of propranolol against variceal hemorrhage, noted previously, was no longer present. Seventeen patients died (12 former propranolol, 5 former placebo) during the follow-up study. Cumulative survival was longer in the placebo group. These trends for EVH and survival were opposite to those observed in the original study population while patients were taking medication. When propranolol is withdrawn, the risk of variceal hemorrhage returns to what would be expected in an untreated population. Patients who discontinue beta blockers experience increased mortality compared with an untreated population. These observations support the current practice of indefinite prophylactic therapy.", 
    "95": "Urapidil, a postsynaptic alpha 1 -adrenergic antagonist, has been reported to improve intraoperative hemodynamic stability, although it has never been used to prevent the hemodynamic response of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This study was designed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of urapidil, as an alternative to labetalol, in preventing the hemodynamic response of ECT. Twenty-seven patients undergoing a series of six consecutive ECT treatments were studied. Each patient received all three pretreatments twice: no drug, labetalol 0.2 mg/kg, or urapidil 25 mg. Systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure and heart rate (HR) were recorded during the awake state, after anesthesia induction, and 1, 2, 5, 10 and 30 minutes after electroencephalographic (EEG) seizure ended. The duration of the EEG convulsion was also recorded. After induction, the HR increased for no drug and urapidil pretreatments, whereas it decreased when labetalol was given. Labetalol and urapidil attenuated the peak increase of blood pressure and returned it to earlier baseline values. There were no differences in the duration of EEG convulsion between the three pretreatments. Urapidil seems to be a good alternative to labetalol for attenuating the hypertensive response to ECT in cases where there is a contraindication to beta-antagonists.", 
    "96": "1. Limb vascular beds exhibit a graded dilatation in response to hypoxia despite increased sympathetic vasoconstrictor nerve activity. We investigated the extent to which sympathetic vasoconstriction can mask hypoxic vasodilatation and assessed the relative contributions of beta-adrenergic and nitric oxide (NO) pathways to hypoxic vasodilatation. 2. We measured forearm blood flow responses (plethysmography) to isocapnic hypoxia (arterial saturation approximately 85%) in eight healthy men and women (18-26 years) after selective alpha-adrenergic blockade (phentolamine) of one forearm. Subsequently, we measured hypoxic responses after combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade (phentolamine and propranolol) and after combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade coupled with NO synthase inhibition (N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine, L-NMMA). 3. Hypoxia increased forearm vascular conductance by 49.0 +/- 13.5% after phentolamine (compared to +16.8 +/- 7.0% in the control arm without phentolamine, P < 0.05). After addition of propranolol, the forearm vascular conductance response to hypoxia was reduced by approximately 50%, but dilatation was still present (+24.7 +/- 7.0%, P < 0.05 vs. normoxia). When L-NMMA was added, there was no further reduction in the forearm vascular conductance response to hypoxia (+28.2 +/- 4.0%, P < 0.05 vs. normoxia). 4. Thus, selective regional alpha-adrenergic blockade unmasked a greater hypoxic vasodilatation than occurs in the presence of functional sympathetic nervous system responses to hypoxia. Furthermore, approximately half of the hypoxic vasodilatation in the forearm appears to be mediated by beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated pathways. Finally, since considerable dilatation persists in the presence of both beta-adrenergic blockade and NO synthase inhibition, it is likely that an additional vasodilator mechanism is activated by hypoxia in humans.", 
    "97": "Little is known about the role of centrally applied peptides in the regulation of bile secretion. We previously reported that the intravenous injection of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) reduces bile acid dependent flow without affecting portal venous pressure in the rat. In the present work, we studied the effects of centrally applied ANF on bile secretion and the possible pathways involved. Rats were cannulated in the brain lateral ventricle for the administration of 1, 10 and 100 ng/microl ANF. After 1 week, the common bile duct was cannulated and bile samples were collected every 15 min for 60 min after the administration of ANF. The excretion rate of various biliary components was assessed. Bile secretion experiments were also performed after bilateral truncal vagotomy or atropine administration to evaluate the participation of a vagal pathway. In addition, the role of the sympathetic system was addressed by combined administration of propranolol and phentolamine. Centrally applied ANF did not modify blood pressure but diminished bile flow and bile acid output. It also reduced sodium and potassium secretion but did not modify protein or phospholipid excretion. Neither bilateral truncal vagotomy nor atropine administration abolished ANF response. Furthermore, combined administration of adrenergic antagonists did not alter ANF inhibitory effect on bile flow. In conclusion, centrally applied ANF reduced bile acid dependent flow not through a vagal or adrenergic pathway in the rat, suggesting the involvement of a peptidergic pathway.", 
    "98": "In the present study, we investigated the effect of fenoterol-induced constitutive beta(2)-adrenoceptor activity on muscarinic receptor agonist- and histamine-induced bovine tracheal smooth muscle contractions. Bovine tracheal smooth muscle strips were incubated with 10 microM fenoterol or vehicle for various periods of time (5, 30 min, 18 h) at 37 degrees C. After extensive washout (3 h, 37 degrees C), isometric contractions were measured to the full muscarinic receptor agonist methacholine, the partial muscarinic receptor agonist 4-(m-chlorophenyl-carbamoyloxy)-2-butynyltrimethylammonium (McN-A-343) and histamine. Fenoterol treatment significantly reduced the sensitivity (pEC(50)) to methacholine in a time-dependent manner, without affecting maximal contraction (E(max)). Fenoterol treatment similarly reduced the pEC(50) of McN-A-343 and histamine; however, E(max) values were also reduced, to approximately 70% of control after 18-h treatment. The inverse agonist timolol, having no effect on control preparations, consistently restored the reduced pEC(50) and E(max) values of the contractile agonists. Remarkably, in the presence of timolol the pEC(50) values of McN-A-343 and histamine in fenoterol-treated airways were significantly enhanced compared to controls. In conclusion, fenoterol-induced constitutive beta(2)-adrenoceptor activity reduces muscarinic receptor agonist- and histamine-induced contractions of bovine tracheal smooth muscle, which can be reversed by the inverse agonist timolol. Moreover, after beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonist treatment, inverse agonism by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists may cause enhanced airway reactivity to contractile mediators.",

(+/-)-Pindolol induced concentration-dependent relaxation in this tissue. However, the relaxant responses of (+/-)-pindolol were not antagonized by a combination of the selective beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol (10(-4) mol/l) and the selective beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist butoxamine (10(-4) mol/l). In the presence of both atenolol and butoxamine, the nonselective beta(1)-, beta(2)- and beta(3)-adrenoceptor antagonist (+/-)-bupranolol (10(-5)-10(-4) mol/l) caused a concentration-dependent rightward shift of the concentration-response curves for (+/-)-pindolol. Schild plot analyses of (+/-)-bupranolol against (+/-)-pindolol gave the pA(2) value of 5.46 +/- 0.03 and Schild slope was not significantly different from unity.

Propranolol, acebutolol, metoprolol and atenolol were used in doses that did not alter the electroconvulsive threshold. Propranolol potentiated the anticonvulsant activity of MK-801 and GYKI 52466, significantly lowering their ED(50) values from 0.38 and 15.0 to 0.15 (P<0.001) and 8.4 mg/kg (P<0.001), respectively. Similarly, metoprolol lowered the ED(50) of MK-801 and GYKI 52466 from 0.38 and 15.0 to 0.17 (P<0.05) and 11.2 mg/kg (P<0.05). Acebutolol enhanced the protective action of GYKI 52466, lowering its ED(50) value from 15.0 to 12.2 mg/kg (P<0.05), but not that of MK-801. Atenolol, not penetrating the blood-brain barrier, did not affect the anticonvulsive efficacy of MK-801 and GYKI 52466. In conclusion, beta-adrenoceptor antagonists may act synergistically with excitatory amino acid receptor antagonists to inhibit generalised tonic-clonic seizures.", 
    "110": "In its simplest and most succinct definition, heart failure can be defined as an inability of the heart to meet the metabolic demands of the body. Despite the diverse etiologies of heart failure in the pediatric population, the presentation of heart failure represents a common constellation of symptoms, signs, and physical findings. In infants, an inability to maintain growth either secondary to decreased nutritional intake or an increased catabolic state is a hallmark of heart failure. Infants exhibit increased sympathetic tone with excessive diaphoresis and increased heart rate. Physical findings in the infants with congestive heart failure (CHF) include increased work of breathing, tachypnea and hepatomegaly. In older children, in contrast, new onset heart failure may be less overtly symptomatic. Malaise, decrease in the level of daily activity, and weight loss may be present. Symptoms of abdominal pain and nausea and anorexia can be present and sometimes divert attention from the real etiology. Physical findings include rales and peripheral edema. If there is hepatomegaly, there will likely be hepatic tenderness as well. A gallop rhythm and tachycardia are commonly present. The long-term treatment of CHF in children includes digoxin, diuretics and afterload reduction with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Digoxin decreases sympathetic tone and improves growth in infants. Diuretics should be used to relieve symptoms but may not be necessary in all children. ACE inhibitors are increasingly valuable in maintaining cardiac function long term. New uses of medications include the addition of spironalactone (Aldactone, G. D. Searle & Co., Chicago, IL) which, in adults, has been shown to significantly decrease both the death rate from CHF and the need for hospitalization. Beta-Blockers have been used in children in limited studies and may have a role in the treatment of patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Surgical treatment, such as partial vectriculectomy, has shown short-term benefit and has been used sparingly in infants.", 
    "111": "Tremendous strides have been made in recent years in the treatment and prevention of sudden cardiac death. Large-scale trials have identified several strategies that may be implemented to improve survival in patients susceptible to sudden cardiac death. In patients who have had a sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia, the current therapy of choice is an implantable cardioverter defibrillator. For prophylaxis of sudden cardiac death in patients without a previous event, several approaches should be considered. Beta-blockers are an effective pharmacologic therapy in patients after myocardial infarction, and their efficacy has also been demonstrated in patients with congestive heart failure. Antiarrhythmic drugs are not efficacious as prophylactic agents to reduce mortality in these populations. The best therapeutic approach for prophylactic therapy to prevent sudden cardiac death appears to be the implantable cardioverter defibrillator; however, its use can be justified only in patients at high risk for developing sudden cardiac death. Further work is needed to identify the high-risk populations in which this therapy is warranted.", 
    "112": "Esprolol is a new, potent, beta adrenergic receptor antagonist that is differentiated from available drugs of this class by its rapid onset, short time to peak effect, and relatively short duration of action after sublingual and oral administration. The drug has potential for short-term use in patients with exertional angina and in patients with other diseases in which rapid-onset beta blocking action would be beneficial. The unique properties of esprolol are determined by the presence in its chemical structure of an ester group, which undergoes rapid metabolism by blood and tissue esterases to form an active metabolite, amoxolol. Preclinical testing and clinical trials in healthy volunteers have demonstrated the tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and beta adrenergic blocking properties of both esprolol and amoxolol. An ongoing trial to evaluate its usefulness in improving exercise performance in patients with exertional angina pectoris is nearing completion.", 
    "113": "Models to predict binding affinities to human serum albumin (HSA) should be very useful in the pharmaceutical industry to speed up the design of new compounds, especially as far as pharmacokinetics is concerned. We have experimentally determined through high-performance affinity chromatography the binding affinities to HSA of 95 diverse drugs and druglike compounds. These data have allowed us the derivation of quantitative structure-activity relationship models to predict binding affinities to HSA of new compounds on the basis of their structure. Simple linear, one-variable models have been derived for specific families of compounds (r(2) > or = 0.80; q(2) > or = 0.62): beta-adrenergic antagonists, steroids, COX inhibitors, and tricyclic antidepressants. Also, global models have been derived to be applicable to the whole medicinal chemical space by using the full database of HSA binding constants described above. For this aim, a genetic algorithm has been used to exhaustively search and select for multivariate and nonlinear equations, starting from a large pool of molecular descriptors. The resulting models display good fits to the experimental data (r(2) > or = 0.78; LOF < or = 0.12). In addition, both internal (cross validation and randomization) and external validation tests have demonstrated that these models have good predictive power (q(2) > or = 0.73; PRESS/SSY < or = 0.23; r(2) > or = 0.82 for the external set). Statistical analysis of the equation populations indicates that hydrophobicity (as measured by the ClogP) is the most important variable determining the binding extent to HSA. In addition, structural factors (especially the topological (6)chi(ring) index and some Jurs descriptors) also frequently appear as descriptors in the best equations. Therefore, binding to HSA turns out to be determined by a combination of hydrophobic forces together with some modulating shape factors. This agrees with X-ray structures of HSA alone or bound to ligands, where the binding pockets of both sites I and II are composed mainly of hydrophobic residues.",

    "122": "Decreased albumin expression is a frequent feature of cachexia patients afflicted with chronic diseases, including cancer, and a major contributor to their morbidity. Here we show that tumor necrosis-alpha (TNF-alpha) treatment of primary mouse hepatocytes or TNF-alpha overexpression in a mouse model of cachexia induces oxidative stress, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression and phosphorylation of C/EBPbeta on Ser239, within the nuclear localization signal, thus inducing its nuclear export, which inhibits transcription from the albumin gene. SIN-1, a NO donor, duplicated the TNF-alpha effects on hepatocytes. We found similar molecular abnormalities in the liver of patients with cancer-cachexia. The cytoplasmic localization and association of C/EBPbeta-PSer239 with CRM1 (exportin-1) in TNF-alpha-treated hepatocytes was inhibited by leptomycin B, a blocker of CRM1 activity. Hepatic cells expressing the non-phosphorylatable C/EBPbeta alanine mutant were refractory to the inhibitory effects of TNF-alpha on albumin transcription since the mutant remained localized to the nucleus. Treatment of TNF-alpha mice with antioxidants or NOS inhibitors prevented phosphorylation of C/EBPbeta on Ser239 and its nuclear export, and rescued the abnormal albumin gene expression.",

Bispectral index (BIS), burst suppression ratio (SR), and physiologic variables were continuously monitored. A 30-min blinded infusion of saline or esmolol was started after establishing a stable baseline and followed by a washout period.

Discontinuation of esmolol reversed the response. BIS and SR were unaffected by placebo infusion. Twelve-minute to 16-min hysteresis between esmolol administration and the onset of half-maximal cortical suppression was observed. Physiologic variables and serum propofol and alfentanil concentrations were not significantly altered by esmolol.

Cox regression analysis showed that higher systolic and diastolic BP measurements were significantly associated with a shorter time to next visit, after adjustment for age and sex. Total estimated costs during the study period were $170 per patient for medications and $283 per patient for office visits.",

    "130": "The problem of heart failure (HF) has become a topic of great interest. Until recently, the use of beta-blockers in patients with HF was considered as one of the contraindications which were taught to medical students as realities with a strict policy to avoid them in HF patients. Times have changed and the contraindicated drug is now an advised and preferred one to be used in HF patients with certain advised recommendations for its use in a safe and beneficial way. Even though the use of beta-blockers in HF patients is an important and necessary step towards an optimal treatment of these patients as most of the big studies have proved, still we need to emphasize these benefits in order to achieve more application of these agents in HF patients. Here we analyse the major studies which used beta-blockers in HF patients. It seems that beta-blockers have to be used in all patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction unless a real contraindication exists as they bring up a great benefit towards decreasing mortality and morbidity.", 
    "131": "Our hypothesis is that leptin release is controlled neurohormonally. Conscious, male rats bearing indwelling, external, jugular catheters were injected with the test drug or 0.9% NaCl (saline), and blood samples were drawn thereafter to measure plasma leptin. Anesthesia decreased plasma leptin concentrations within 10 min to a minimum at 120 min, followed by a rebound at 360 min. Administration (i.v.) of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) increased plasma leptin to almost twice baseline by 120 min, and it remained on a plateau for 360 min, accompanied by increased adipocyte leptin mRNA. Anesthesia largely blunted the LPS-induced leptin release at 120 min. Isoproterenol (beta-adrenergic agonist) failed to alter plasma leptin but reduced LPS-induced leptin release significantly. Propranolol (beta-receptor antagonist) produced a significant increase in plasma leptin but had no effect on the response to LPS. Phentolamine (alpha-adrenergic receptor blocker) not only increased plasma leptin (P < 0.001), but also augmented the LPS-induced increase (P < 0.001). alpha-Bromoergocryptine (dopaminergic-2 receptor agonist) decreased plasma leptin (P < 0.01) and blunted the LPS-induced rise in plasma leptin release (P < 0.001). We conclude that leptin is at least in part controlled neurally because anesthesia decreased plasma leptin and blocked its response to LPS. The findings that phentolamine and propranolol increased plasma leptin concentrations suggest that leptin release is inhibited by the sympathetic nervous system mediated principally by alpha-adrenergic receptors because phentolamine, but not propranolol, augmented the response to LPS. Because alpha-bromoergocryptine decreased basal and LPS-induced leptin release, dopaminergic neurons may inhibit basal and LPS-induced leptin release by suppression of release of prolactin from the adenohypophysis.",

As combinations, sulfonylureas plus metformin was most popular, followed by metformin plus insulin, and sulfonylureas plus insulin. Sulfonylurea and metformin with insulin was rarely used. There was no significant difference in prescribing of glyburide and metformin between the elderly and young middle-aged diabetic patients; many patients older than 65 years were treated with a beta-blocker along with a long-acting sulfonylurea. Both as monotherapy and in overall use, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and calcium-channel blockers were most often prescribed. Among 35.5% patients treated with antihypertensive combinations, various two- and three-drug combinations of beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, calcium-channel blockers, and diuretics were often used.

    "143": "Over the past 21 years since the birth of SP into the diagnostic nomenclature, there have been significant gains in knowledge about effective pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic treatments. The SSRIs have emerged as the first-line pharmacologic treatment, although good evidence shows efficacy of benzodiazepines; MAOIs; and anticonvulsant agents, such as gabapentin and pregabalin. There is also emerging evidence about the efficacy of the novel antidepressant venlafaxine and also optimism for the potential utility of nefazodone and possibly bupropion. However, there are many areas requiring further investigation. There has been a great deal of excitement about the publication of the RUPP Anxiety Study, demonstrating efficacy for fluvoxamine in socially phobic youth. Given that SP starts in childhood and adolescence, more data are needed to support the use of pharmacotherapy in this age group because early intervention may prevent the sequelae of chronic SP. There needs to be more investigation into what is required for social phobic individuals who obtain a good response to pharmacotherapy to move into full-remission status. Additional research is needed regarding the evaluation of the comparative efficacy of different drug classes and to develop an improved capability of predicting treatment response to a particular type of treatment. In addition, more research is needed regarding treatment resistance. In most of the anxiety disorders that have been studied, combining CBT with psychopharmacologic treatment has shown little advantage over either treatment alone. These findings may be due to methodologic problems. Research is needed on how to sequence treatments to maximize the benefits of combining the two types of effective treatments together. Finally, many clinicians are seeing an emerging trend of individuals who have had untreated SP all of their lives and are now presenting for treatment in their \"golden years.\" The current established treatments need to be evaluated further in this geriatric population.", 
    "144": "In order to assess a role of 5-HT(1B) receptors for regulation of GABA transmission in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), VTA slices from the rat were incubated with [(3)H]GABA and beta-alanine, and superfused in the presence of nipecotic acid and aminooxyacetic acid. [(3)H]GABA release was induced by exposures to the medium containing 30 mM potassium for 2 min. The results showed that high potassium-evoked [(3)H]GABA release was sensitive to calcium withdrawal or blockade of sodium channels by tetrodotoxin, suggesting that tritium overflow induced by high potassium derived largely from neuronal stores. Administration of CP 93129 (0.15 and 0.45 microM), a 5-HT(1B) receptor agonist, or RU 24969 (0.15 and 0.45 microM), a 5-HT(1B/1A) receptor agonist, but not 8-OH-DPAT (0.45 microM), a 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist, inhibited high potassium-evoked [(3)H]GABA release in a concentration-related manner. The RU 24969-induced inhibition of [(3)H]GABA release was antagonized by either SB 216641, a 5-H(1B) receptor antagonist, or cyanopindolol, a 5-HT(1B/1A) receptor antagonist, but not by WAY 100635, a 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist. Pre-treatment with SB 216641 also antagonized CP 93129-induced inhibition of [(3)H]GABA release.

Most studies on antiarrhythmic drug-ICD interactions have been performed in experimental animals. Antiarrhythmic drugs can influence the effectiveness of ICD to terminate arrhythmias through their effects on defibrillation threshold (DFT). Studies have demonstrated a rise in DFTs with class Ib agent lidocaine and class Ic agents encainide and flecainide. Class Ia agents, as well as amiodarone, bretylium and propafenone may have more variable effects on DFT probably because of the difference between acute and chronic drug dosing, dose-related changes, active metabolites, and reproducibility in determining DFT. Class III agents, with the exception of amiodarone, consistently decrease DFT. These drugs can be used as front-line agents in ICD patients.",

In a double blind study, 34 essential hypertensive patients were treated for 3 months with either ramipril 2.5-5.0 mg daily (n = 17, age 57 +/- 7 y, 11 males) or atenolol 50-100 mg daily (n = 17, age 53 +/- 8 y, 11 males). Blood pressure (BP), brachial artery diameter (D), brachial-radial pulse wave velocity (PWV) and effective compliance (Ceff), were measured before and at the end of the study. Isobaric evaluation (Ciso) was performed in the entire population studied at an average mean BP of 110 mmHg. Ramipril significantly reduced BP from 155 +/- 16/94 +/- 6 mmHg to 140 +/- 15/85 +/- 7 mmHg (p < 0.001) without affecting heart rate (HR; 74 +/- 10 vs. 75 +/- 12 bpm). In addition, it significantly improved both PWV (18%; p < 0.001) and arterial compliance (45%; p < 0.001), from which 35% was related to a pressure independent effect (p < 0.01). Atenolol also induced a reduction in both BP (159 +/- 17/96 +/- 10 to 133 +/- 13/81 +/- 8 mmHg; p < 0.001) and HR (76 +/- 10 to 57 +/- 7 bpm; p < 0.001). In a similar way, PWV (11%; p < 0.05) and Ceff (30%; p < 0.05) were significantly improved without significant change in Ciso. This suggests that blood pressure reduction was responsible for compliance improvement. In conclusion, it is suggested that atenolol induces only hemodynamic changes, mediated mainly by BP reduction. In contrast, the improved brachial buffering function observed after ramipril involves not only hemodynamic changes, but also changes mediated by other mechanisms, such as modification of wall structures.", 
    "162": "Nisoldipine, a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, has greater vascular selectivity than other calcium channel antagonists and does not depress the intact myocardium in vivo. It should be taken on an empty stomach. Both rapid-release and coat-core formulations are available for clinical use, but only the coat-core formulation extends antihypertensive, antiischemic, and antianginal effects throughout the dosing interval when given once daily. The coat-core formulation in daily doses of 10 to 40 mg does not cause the proischemic effects reported with the rapid-release formulation. When given as monotherapy, the coat-core formulation is highly effective in lowering blood pressure to a similar extent as other long-acting calcium channel blockers, diuretics, beta-blockers, or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The antihypertensive effects are potentiated when the coat-core formulation of nisoldipine is given in combination with lisinopril. In patients with stable angina pectoris nisoldipine coat-core increases exercise duration, reduces anginal frequency and myocardial ischemia, and is effective as monotherapy or in combination with a beta-blockers. In monotherapy the drug is as effective as other long-acting calcium channel blockers or a beta-blocker. The effects of nisoldipine coat-core in patients with heart failure are unclear at present.",

Biologically significant levels of both norepinephrine and dopamine were found in human ovarian biopsies. [3H]norepinephrine incorporated in vitro was readily released by electrical stimulation in a Ca2+-dependent process. Ovarian membrane preparations exhibited specific binding sites for the beta-adrenergic antagonist [3H]dihydroalprenolol. Displacement of [3H]dihydroalprenolol with zinterol (a specific beta2-agonist) indicated that 72% of these sites were type beta2-receptors. beta-receptors were also present on granulosa cells. Stimulation of granulosa cells with luteinizing hormone or the beta-agonist isoproterenol increased the release of progesterone after 4 d in culture. These results suggest that the sympathetic nerves present in human ovary are coupled to beta-adrenergic receptors present in endocrine cells and, as in nonprimate mammals, appear to participate in the regulation of ovarian function.",

Infusion of La(-)/lactic acid (pH 3.5) established a mean arterial blood La(-) concentration of ~10 mM while normal blood-gas and pH status were maintained as the gastrocnemius-plantaris was stimulated with tetanic trains at a rate of one contraction every 4 s. After steady-state control measures, epinephrine was infused for 35 min at rates that produced a high physiological concentration with (Pro; n = 6) and without (Epi; n = 6) beta-adrenergic-receptor blockade via propranolol. Net La(-) uptake values during the control conditions were not significantly different between trials (Epi: 0.756 +/- 0.043; Pro: 0.703 +/- 0.061 mmol. kg(-1). min(-1)). Steady level O(2) uptake averaged approximately 69.5 ml. kg(-1). min(-1) for both control conditions and did not significantly change over the course of the experiments in either set of trials. Epi experiments resulted in a significantly reduced net La(-) uptake (0.346 +/- 0.088 mmol. kg(-1). min(-1) after 5 min of infusion) compared with control value at all sample times measured. However, net La(-) uptake was not significantly different from control at any time during Pro (0.609 +/- 0.052 mmol. kg(-1). min(-1) after 5 min of infusion). When the change from the respective control values for net La(-) uptake was compared across time for both series of experiments, Epi resulted in a significantly greater change from control than did Pro.

Recordings of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) showed that basal MAP and HR were significantly higher in both anesthetized and conscious, unrestrained alphaCGRP-null mice than in corresponding wild-type mice. The elevated MAP in alphaCGRP-null mice was shown to be the result of elevated peripheral vascular resistance by alpha-adrenergic blockade with prazosin and by transthoracic echocardiogram, which revealed no significant differences between alphaCGRP-null and wild-type mice in the stroke volume, fractional shortening, and ejection fraction. Moreover, evaluation of autonomic nervous activity by measuring HR after pretreatment of atropine and/or atenolol and by analyzing arterial baroreceptor reflexes showed sympathetic nervous activity to be significantly elevated in alphaCGRP-null mice; elevated levels of urinary catecholamine metabolites and decreased HR variability in mutant mice were also consistent with that finding.

Inhibition of electrical field stimulation-induced contractions by isoprenaline was attenuated by propranolol (1 microM). The selective beta1-adrenoceptor agonist (-)-1-(3,4-dimethoxy-phenethylamino)-3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenoxy)-2-propanol)oxalate (RO363) and the selective beta2-adrenoceptor agonist salbutamol (1 nM(-100) x microM) were approximately equipotent in inhibiting electrical field stimulation-induced contractions but the selective beta3-adrenoceptor agonist sodium 4-(2-[2-hydroxy-[3-chlorophenyl]ethylamino]propyl)phenoxyacetate (BRL 37344, 1 nM(-100) x microM) did not inhibit electrical field stimulation-induced contractions. The selective beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist, (+/-)-1-[2,3-(dihydro-7-methyl-1H-inden-4-yl)oxy]-3-[(1-methylethyl)amino]-2-butanol (ICI 118 551, 0.1 microM) attenuated inhibitory responses to isoprenaline and salbutamol, while the selective beta1-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol (3 microM) did not. Contractions induced by electrical field stimulation were also inhibited by forskolin (10 nM(-3) x mM) but unaffected by sodium nitroprusside (10 nM(-1) x mM) indicating the presence of an inhibitory cAMP mechanism. These data suggest that stimulation of beta2-adrenoceptors can inhibit contractions of the rat prostate induced by electrical field stimulation."
