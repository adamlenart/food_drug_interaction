In this study, we examined the potential cardiac toxicity and hypertensive effects of CA4P, and defined the most effective pharmacological inhibition of CA4P-induced hypertension in rats. There was a significant, concentration dependent increase in mean arterial blood pressure with a maximum increase of about 60% of the baseline MAP at 30 mg/kg of CA4P compared to the saline control. However, there was no significant increase in the cardiac troponin I level after CA4P injection. Nitroglycerin and the calcium channel blocker diltiazem effectively blocked the hypertensive effects of CA4P while the beta blocker metoprolol was ineffective. Furthermore, sublingual nitroglycerin administration demonstrated an additional anti-hypertensive effect in a setting of a low dose diltiazem infusion (10 microg/kg/min). We conclude that CA4P treatment resulted in a concentration dependent increase in blood pressure without significant myocardial damage in healthy rats. The hypertensive effect of CA4P was effectively blocked by both nitroglycerin and diltiazem, but not metoprolol.", 
    "1": "Hypertension is very common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD); it causes early loss of kidney function and accelerated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. African American patients with hypertension and genetic disposition are at an even higher risk for renal disease and ultimately renal failure. Hypertensive patients with CKD should aim for stringent blood pressure (BP) control (target < 130/80 mm Hg) requiring more than one drug with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade as a component of therapy targeting both hyper-tension and proteinuria. Management of hypertension in the dialysis population should focus on ambulatory measurements of BP and the use of longer-acting antihypertensive drugs, with their dosage and timing adjusted according to their dialytic clearances. Hypertension is also common among kidney transplant recipients and contributes to graft loss and premature death. The target BP in transplant recipients is the same as in the CKD population, with no preference for one drug group over another. Unless contraindicated, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors remain the drugs of choice for hypertension in patients with autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease, in whom diastolic cardiac dysfunction is a prominent feature.", 
    "2": "Hypertension remains uncontrolled in more than 50% of treated patients. Barriers to hypertension control include those that are patient-related, physician-related, and related to the health system. Identification of uncontrolled hypertension, pseudoresistant hyper-tension, and resistant hypertension require thoughtful attention to accurate blood pressure measurement, lifestyle factors, evaluation for secondary causes of hypertension, and proper treatment. Recent guidelines emphasize the importance of aggressive treatment and referral to hypertension specialists for patients with resistant hypertension, defined as blood pressure that remains above goal despite the use of three appropriate anti-hypertensive agents.", 
    "3": "Although primary (essential) hypertension is detectable in childhood, secondary causes of hypertension must be considered in evaluating and managing hypertension in children and adolescents. Very young children and children with severe hypertension may have an underlying cause of the hypertension. Interventions to control elevated blood pressure (BP) are clinically important for all children with high BP. Nonpharmacologic approaches are recommended for all asymptomatic children with hypertension and prehypertension. Some children and adolescents will require pharmacologic therapy to control BP and to optimize organ protection. Recent advancements in pediatric clinical trials of antihypertensive agents have provided data on BP-lowering effects and safety in children. Little has been published on the choice and use of various classes of antihypertensive drugs for management of secondary hypertension in children and adolescents. This review focuses on the clinical management of specific types of secondary hypertension in pediatric patients.", 
    "4": "Although systemic hypertension is a common clinical condition, hypertensive emergencies are unusual in clinical practice. There are some situations, however, that qualify as hypertensive emergencies or urgencies. It is important, therefore, to diagnose these acute conditions, in which immediate treatment of hypertension is indicated. The diagnosis of hypertensive emergencies depends on consideration of the clinical manifestations as well as the absolute level of blood pressure. Manifestations of hypertensive emergencies can be quite profound, but they vary depending on the target organ that is affected. Thus, an accurate clinical diagnosis is necessary to render appropriate therapy. Fortunately, effective drug therapy is available to lower the blood pressure quickly in hypertensive emergencies. Physicians should be familiar with the pharmacologic and clinical actions of drugs in treating hypertensive emergencies. With proper clinical diagnosis, hypertensive emergencies can be successfully treated, and complications can be largely prevented with timely intervention.", 
    "5": "Vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) is a major substrate for cyclic nucleotide-dependent kinases that has been implicated in cardiac pathology, yet many aspects of VASP's molecular regulation in cardiomyocytes are incompletely understood. In these studies, we explored the role of VASP, both in signaling pathways in isolated murine myocytes, as well as in a model of cardiac hypertrophy in VASP(null) mice. We found that the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol promotes the rapid and reversible phosphorylation of VASP at Ser157 and Ser239. Forskolin and the cAMP analog 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP promote a similar pattern of VASP phosphorylation at both sites. The effects of isoproterenol are blocked by atenolol and by compound H-89, an inhibitor of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. By contrast, phosphorylation of VASP only at Ser239 is seen following activation of particulate guanylate cyclase by atrial natriuretic peptide, or following activation of soluble guanylate cyclase by sodium nitroprusside, or following treatment of myocytes with cGMP analog. We found that basal and isoproterenol-induced VASP phosphorylation is entirely unchanged in cardiomyocytes isolated from either endothelial or neuronal nitric oxide synthase knockout mice. In cardiomyocytes isolated from diabetic mice, only basal VASP phosphorylation is increased, whereas, in cells isolated from mice subjected to ascending aortic constriction (AAC), we found a significant increase in basal VASP expression, along with an increase in VASP phosphorylation, compared with cardiac myocytes isolated from sham-operated mice. Moreover, there is further increase in VASP phosphorylation in cells isolated from hypertrophic hearts following isoproterenol treatment. Finally, we found that VASP(null) mice subjected to transverse aortic constriction develop cardiac hypertrophy with a pattern similar to VASP(+/+) mice. Our findings establish differential receptor-modulated regulation of VASP phosphorylation in cardiomyocytes by cyclic nucleotides. Furthermore, these studies demonstrate for the first time that VASP expression is upregulated in hypertrophied heart.", 
    "6": "The optimal role of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade in the perioperative period remains unclear in patients at risk for cardiovascular events. Cardiovascular complications continue to be the most common cause of perioperative morbidity and mortality, and cardioprotective properties of beta-blockers are widely recognized, yet the results of the clinical trials investigating the use of different beta-blockers in the perioperative period are controversial. The discrepancy might be related to differences in the design of studies, use of different agents, administration by different routes, and continuation for different time intervals. Evidently, perioperative mortality and morbidity seem to be related to heart rate, and the majority of complications are related to beta-blockers' side effects. Based on the observations from different studies, we propose an algorithm for perioperative beta blockade.",

    "8": "This study included 27 patients with CSF and 27 subjects with normal coronary arteries. Segmental functions of the left ventricle (LV) were assessed using myocardial tissue Doppler velocities before and 3 months after treatment with nebivolol 5 mg/day.", 
    "9": "Compared with the control group, mitral deceleration time (DT) was significantly longer, and E/A ratio, systolic velocity of lateral mitral annulus (S(m)) and regional myocardial peak systolic and early diastolic velocities (V( s), V(d)) were significantly lower in patients with CSF. The reason for coronary angiography was typical angina in 21 (77.8%) and positive treadmill test in six (22.2%) CSF patients. There were significant correlations between presence of CSF in left anterior descending artery (LAD) with S( m) (r =-0.404, p =0.002) and V(s) in anterior (r =-0.531, p < 0.001 ) and lateral (r =-0.495, p < 0.001 ) segments and between presence of CSF in RCA and V(s) in posterior segments (r =-0.501, p < 0.001). Treatment with nebivolol significantly decreased blood pressures (128.5+/-12.5/82.5+/-8.8 to 119.8+/- 12.6/76.4+/- 7.4 mmHg, p < 0.001), DT (252.3+/-53.6 to 222.0+/-41.0 ms, p < 0.001 ) and IVRT (115.7+/-19.9 to 103.3+/-17.0 ms, p <0.001), and increased exercise capacity (8.7+/-1.3 to 10.4+/-0.9 METs, p < 0.001), E/A ratio (0.87+/-0.26 to 1.08+/-0.23, p <0.001) and myocardial velocities (p < 0.001). All the patients were free of angina after treatment. Patients with CSF had impaired diastolic and regional LV functions.",

    "11": "The determination of propranolol enantiomers in human plasma and urine by spectrofluorimetry and a second-order standard addition method is described. The methodology is based on chiral recognition of propranolol by formation of an inclusion complex with beta-cyclodextrin, a chiral auxiliary, in the presence of 1-butanol. The adopted strategy combines the use of PARAFAC, for extraction of the pure analyte signal, with the standard addition method, for determinations in the presence of an individual matrix effect caused by the quenching action of the proteins present in the plasma and urine. A specific PARAFAC model was built for each sample, in triplicate, and the scores were related to (R)-propranolol mole fraction using a linear regression in the standard addition method. Using a propranolol with concentration of 260 ng mL(-1), good results were obtained for determinations in the mole fraction range from 50 to 80% of (R)-propranolol, providing absolute errors between 0.4 and 3.6% for plasma and between 0.9 and 6.0% for urine.", 
    "12": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the human nasal epithelial cell line RPMI 2650 regarding its usefulness as in vitro model for drug permeation studies. Particularly, the influence of the air-liquid interface in culture and coculture with human nasal fibroblasts (HNF) on the differentiation and permeation barrier properties of the cell layer was examined. In addition to a non-contact coculture, we developed a three-dimensional construct of the human nasal mucosa composed of a collagen matrix with embedded HNF, covered by a RPMI 2650 epithelial cell layer. Microscopic examination as well as measurement of the transepithelial electrical resistance and permeation experiments showed the importance of cultivation at the air-liquid interface. Permeation studies were performed using a paracellular marker (sodium fluorescein), a transcellular marker (propranolol-HCl) and a model substance with high molecular weight (FITC-dextran, MW 4000). The epithelial model showed an organotypic permeation barrier for paracellular, transcellular and high MW permeation. Three-dimensional reconstructed human nasal mucosa showed four- to fivefold higher permeation coefficients. Regardless of the limits of these models, both offer promise to evaluate passive drug permeation through the nasal mucosa.", 
    "13": "Glaucoma, the most common optic neuropathy (GON) is characterised by the loss of retinal ganglion cells and their axons, as well as tissue remodelling of both the retina and the optic nerve head with corresponding visual field defects. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is generally regarded as the major risk factor for glaucoma and its reduction is the most common target for therapy of GON. There are indications that the greater the IOP reduction, the better is the visual field prognosis. This article investigates, on the basis of two beta-blockers, betaxolol and timolol, whether the amount of IOP reduction is truly a good surrogate for successful glaucoma therapy with respect to visual field outcome. Contrary to what is generally expected, our analysis of the literature exemplifies that despite a smaller IOP reduction, patients treated with betaxolol had a smaller rate of visual field deterioration than patients treated with timolol. Based on the dissociation of IOP reduction and visual field prognosis, we postulate that for successful treatment in glaucoma not only the amount of IOP reduction is relevant but also the drug by which the reduction is achieved. This seeming paradox phenomenon highlights that ocular hypotensive drugs have relevant effects on GON other than IOP-related. Some of these effects on retinal ganglion cells (neuroprotection) or on ocular blood flow are mediated by calcium- and sodium channels. Future studies on glaucoma treatment should focus on their effect on visual field function, and not just on IOP. This should particularly be considered when comparing drugs from different classes.", 
    "14": "In the gut, dopamine is released by enteric neurons and modulates motility of small intestine smooth muscle cells. Here, we systematically analyzed the dopamine-induced effects on the longitudinal smooth muscle of different sections of the rat isolated small intestine. We found that exogenous dopamine had biphasic effects and could lead to both an early contraction and a late relaxation, depending on the region of small intestine. Thus, dopamine-induced early contractions were commonly observed in the duodenum, but less frequently in the jejunum, and rarely in the ileum. The amplitudes of these early contractions showed a striking regional dependence (duodenum>jejunum>ileum) and were significantly blocked by SCH23390 and raclopride. Conversely, dopamine-induced late relaxations were regularly obtained in the ileum and in the jejunum, but less frequently in the duodenum. Interestingly, the amplitudes of these relaxations showed an inverse regional dependence (ileum>jejunum>duodenum), and were insensitive to dopamine receptor antagonists. Rather, they were significantly inhibited by propranolol and prazosin. We conclude that dopamine exerts differential effects on smooth muscle motility in different regions within the rat small intestine. In proximal parts, dopamine predominantly causes D(1) and D(2) dopamine receptor-dependent contraction, whereas it leads to alpha and beta adrenoceptor-dependent relaxation in more distal parts.",

    "19": "The basal HF oscillatory component of vaginal blood flow was primarily vagally mediated, although could be modulated pharmacologically with p-chloroamphetamine in the absence of vagal innervation. The LF component could be modulated by antagonists of noradrenergic receptors but did not appear to be dependent upon tonic activation of sympathetic circuitry. The non-selective dopamine receptor agonist apomorphine induced changes in vaginal blood flow oscillations consistent with sexual arousal during metestrus in the presence of the peripheral antagonist domperidone but not in the presence of the centrally acting antagonist haloperidol. Electrical stimulation of the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus induced an anti-arousal response in vaginal blood flow oscillations. These data demonstrated that manipulation of the central nervous system alone (via centrally acting apomorphine or electrical stimulation of the PVN) could produce either a pro-arousal or an anti-arousal response in vaginal blood flow oscillations. Alterations in the LF/HF ratio measured from vaginal laser Doppler flowmetry were independently regulated from vasculature in the trunk, the tongue, and electrocardiogram-derived heart rate variability, and were independent of overall vasocongestion of the vagina as measured by mean blood flow.",

    "22": "Using a retail pharmacy claims database, three glaucoma patient cohorts were defined and followed for 12 months (January 2004 through December 2004). Patients in cohort 1 had a prescription for a single fixed-combination therapy during the month of January 2004. Cohort 2 consisted of patients with prescriptions for a beta-blocker and one other glaucoma product in the same month. Cohort 3 comprised patients with prescriptions filled for three different glaucoma therapies during the first month. A fixed-combination formulation may have been included in cohorts 2 and 3 as well, but was counted as a single bottle. Persistence rate, defined as the percentage of patients who did not discontinue their medication over the 12-month period, was calculated.",

In aortic ECs isolated from diabetic SH rats, NO production decreased by 20% whereas ONOO(-) increased by 16%, an effect linked to NAD(P)H oxidase and endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) uncoupling. Nebivolol treatment reduced glucose and BP levels and restored aortic EC function in diabetic SH rats, as indicated by a 30% increase and 23% decrease in NO and ONOO(-) levels, respectively. The NO/ONOO(-) ratio increased by more than twofold with nebivolol treatment in aortic and glomerular ECs. Despite similar reductions in glucose and mean BP levels, metoprolol had a smaller effect on the NO/ONOO(-) ratio in glomerular ECs but no effect in aortic ECs.",

Losartan (100 micromol/l) also increased adiponectin by 65% (P < 0.05). Conversely, hydrochlorothiazide, 0.1 micromol/l, reduced adiponectin by 37% (P < 0.01). Captopril, atenolol, and nifedipine had no effect on adiponectin.

Monocytes were studied in vitro after incubation with LPS (50 ng/ml) with and without 1 mumol/l candesartan, an AT1 receptor blocker. Angiotensin II receptor mRNA expression was determined by reverse transcriptase-PCR and receptor binding by autoradiography; inflammatory factor mRNA expression was studied by reverse transcriptase-PCR and cytokine release by ELISA.", 
    "35": "Human monocytes did not express detectable AT1 receptors, and angiotensin II did not induce inflammatory factor mRNA expression or cytokine release. However, candesartan substantially reduced the LPS-induced expression of the mRNAs for the LPS recognition protein cluster of differentiation 14, the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1 beta and interleukin-6 and the lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor. In addition, candesartan reduced the activation of the nuclear factor kappa B pathway, the tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6 secretion, and the ROS formation induced by LPS, without affecting the secretion of interleukin-10.", 
    "36": "We hypothesize that the anti-inflammatory effects of candesartan in these cells are likely mediated by mechanisms unrelated to AT1 receptor blockade. Our results demonstrate that candesartan significantly reduces the innate immune response to LPS in human circulating monocytes. The anti-inflammatory effects of candesartan may be of importance not only in hypertension but also in other inflammatory disorders.", 
    "37": "To analyze the effects of endothelin-1 on the b-adrenergic response of the coronary circulation, 2-mm-long segments of coronary arteries from rats were prepared for isometric tension recording in organ baths. The relaxation to isoproterenol (3 x 10(-8) M), field electrical stimulation (4 Hz, 0.1-millisecond duration, 10 seconds), acetylcholine (3 x 10(-8) M), and sodium nitroprusside (10(-9) M) was recorded in arteries precontracted with U46619 (10(-7) to 5 x 10(-7) M) before and after treatment with endothelin-1 (3 3 10210 and 1029 M). The relaxation to isoproterenol was increased by treatment with endothelin-1 and with the endothelin ET(B) antagonist BQ788 (10(-6) M) but not with the endothelin ET(A) antagonist BQ123 (10(-6) M) or with the blocker of protein kinase C chelerythrine (10(-5) M). In the presence of BQ788, BQ123, or chelerythrine, endothelin-1 did not modify the relaxation to isoproterenol. Treatment with endothelin-1 did not modify the relaxation to electrical stimulation, acetylcholine, or sodium nitroprusside. These results suggest that endothelin-1 may potentiate coronary beta-adrenergic vasodilatation, at least in part due to stimulation of endothelin ET(A) receptors and activation of protein kinase C.",

This method allows for the electrochemical detection of ionic analytes that cannot be easily oxidized or reduced. Method development revealed that the optimal separation conditions for three model ions (tetraethylammonium, tetrabutylammonium, and benzensulfonate) were found to be 5 mM sodium tetraborate buffer pH 9.2 with a separation voltage of 20 kV using a 40 cm, 50 microm id fused silica capillary. Constant potential amperometry and pulsed amperometric detection were applied at the ITIES in which the organic phase was gelled. A miniaturized ITIES within a pipette tip was investigated, which resulted in improved separation efficiency and LOD. To demonstrate the ability of the system to detect substances of bioanalytical interest, the beta-adrenergic receptor blockers timolol and propranolol were detected. The simplicity of the detection platform means that it may be useful for analytical situations not requiring trace or ultratrace detection capabilities.", 
    "48": "A novel method to detect beta-antagonists in rat blood was developed by combining heart-cutting 2-D CE in a single capillary with on-column electrochemical (EC) detection. The blood sample was purified in first dimension by non-micellar CZE separation. Then only a desirable fraction of the first dimension separation was transferred into the second dimension of the capillary by pressure. Finally, the purified sample was separated by MEKC. On-line dual concentration method, field amplified sample stacking and sweeping, was employed to accumulate the purified components that effectively counteracted the sample zone diffusion during the mobilization pressure step. A field decoupler joint and an EC detection cell were employed for on-column EC detection. After optimizing the analytical conditions, the RSD of peak height, peak area and migration time were 2.1-4.3%, 1.5-3.9% and 0.7-1.8% (n=10), respectively. This method has been successfully applied to determine beta-antagonists in postdosing rat blood sample. The pharmacokinetic study also demonstrated that the proposed heart-cutting 2-D CE with on-column EC detection was convenient, sensitive and would become an attractively alternative method for on-line sample cleanup and separation in complex samples.", 
    "49": "Genetic variation in drug targets (e.g. receptors) can have pronounced effects on clinical responses to endogenous and exogenous agonists. Polymorphisms in the gene encoding the \u03b2(2)-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2(2)-AR) have been associated with altered expression, down-regulation, and altered cell signaling in vitro. Because \u03b2(2)-ARs play a crucial role in the regulation of the cardiovascular system, the functional importance of genetic variation in the \u03b2(2)-AR on cardiovascular responses to physiological or pharmacological stimuli has gained widespread attention. The objective of this review is to characterize these intermediate cardiovascular phenotypes and their influence on cardiovascular disease and adrenergic drug responses.Two common single nucleotide polymorphisms, encoded at codon 46 (Gly(16)Arg) and 79 (Gln(27)Glu) of the \u03b2(2)-AR gene, have been studied intensively. They have been shown to be associated with altered vasodilator responses to regional and systemic administration of \u03b2(2)-agonists, altered cardiovascular responses to sympathoexcitatory maneuvers, and altered myocardial function. Importantly, these intermediate physiological patterns may influence the development of and the outcomes associated with hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases. As recently reported, \u03b2(2)-AR gene variation can risk-stratify patients receiving \u03b2-blocker therapy and may predict \u03b2-blocker efficacy in patients post acute coronary syndrome or in patients with heart failure.Further studies will advance our understanding of the link between \u03b2(2)-AR genotypes, intermediate cardiovascular phenotypes, and clinical phenotypes. In the long term, reassessment of the benefits of \u03b2-blocker-therapy within genotype groups should be carried out with the ultimate goal to design the optimal therapeutic regimen for the individual patient.",

There is, however, little published regarding ET in the pediatric population, and no prospective studies targeted specifically to children. Retrospective studies from subspecialty movement disorder clinics indicate that childhood-onset ET is usually hereditary, begins at a mean age of 6 years, and affects boys three times as often as girls.

Recent studies have shown that neurotransmitters are involved in the regulation of cancer cell invasion via beta-adrenoceptors (beta-ARs). However, little is known regarding the effect of neurotransmitters on pancreatic cancer cells. The aim of our study was to examine the regulative effect of norepinephrine (NE), which belongs to the group of classical neurotransmitters, on the invasiveness of pancreatic cancer cells and the therapeutic effect of the beta-blocker, propranolol, on them. The human pancreatic cancer cell lines, Miapaca-2 and Bxpc-3, were selected for this study, and in both cell lines, beta1-AR and beta2-AR expression was determined by RT-PCR and Western blotting. The invasiveness of pancreatic cancer cells was examined using the Matrigel invasion assay. The concentrations of MMP-2, MMP-9, and VEGF in the culture medium and in the cancer cells were examined by ELISA and RT-PCR, respectively. We observed that NE promoted the invasiveness of Miapaca-2 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, and NE increased the expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, and VEGF. However, these effects could be inhibited by the beta-blocker, propranolol. In conclusion, the development of metastases is not only genetically determined, but is also influenced by NE, which is one of the signal substances present in the tumor environment. This study also provides experimental evidence for the use of beta-blockers in the chemoprevention of pancreatic cancer metastasis.",

In skeletal muscle, we hypothesized that GLUT4 expression might be maintained in a beta-adrenergic-dependent way to ensure energy disposal for contractile function. Herein we investigate beta-blockade or beta-stimulation effects on GLUT4 expression in oxidative (soleus) and glycolytic [extensor digitorum longus (EDL)] muscles of fasted rats. Fasting increased GLUT4 mRNA in soleus (24%) and EDL (40%), but the protein content increased only in soleus (30%). beta1-beta2-, and beta1-beta2-beta3-blockade decreased (20-30%) GLUT4 mRNA content in both muscles, although GLUT4 protein decreased only in EDL. When mRNA and GLUT4 protein regulations were discrepant, changes in the mRNA poly(A) tail length were detected, indicating a posttranscriptional modulation of gene expression. These results show that beta-adrenergic activity regulates GLUT4 gene expression in skeletal muscle during fasting, highlighting its participation in preservation of GLUT4 protein in glycolytic muscle.",

We investigated a possible contribution of chymase to AngII formation and to renal fibrosis in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). Eight-week-old Syrian hamsters were subjected to UUO and treated with vehicle, the specific chymase inhibitor (CI) 4-[1-(4-methyl-benzo[b]thiophen-3-ylmethyl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-ylsulfanyl]-butyric acid (50 mg/kg, twice a day, p.o.), or the selective AT(1)-receptor blocker olmesartan (10 mg/kg per day, p.o.) for 14 days. UUO-induced renal interstitial fibrosis was associated with increases in renal mRNA levels of alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA), type I collagen, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta. The UUO hamsters showed markedly higher AngII contents and increased AT(1)-receptor mRNA level in the obstructed kidney than sham-operated ones. In contrast, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) protein expression was significantly lower in UUO hamsters. In UUO hamsters, treatment with CI or olmesartan significantly decreased AngII levels in renal tissue and mRNA levels of alpha-SMA, type I collagen, and TGF-beta and ameliorated tubulointerstitial injury. On the other hand, neither CI nor olmesartan changed systolic blood pressure, renal ACE, and AT(1)-receptor protein levels. These data suggest that chymase-dependent intrarenal AngII formation contributes to the pathogenesis of interstitial fibrosis in obstructed kidneys of hamsters.",

    "73": "Transdermal drug delivery offers an attractive alternative to the conventional drug delivery methods of oral administration and injection. However, the stratum corneum acts as a barrier that limits the penetration of substances through the skin. Application of high-voltage pulses to the skin increases its permeability (electroporation) and enables the delivery of various substances into and through the skin. The application of electroporation to the skin has been shown to increase transdermal drug delivery. Moreover, electroporation, used alone or in combination with other enhancement methods, expands the range of drugs (small to macromolecules, lipophilic or hydrophilic, charged or neutral molecules) that can be delivered transdermally. The efficacy of transport depends on the electrical parameters and the physicochemical properties of drugs. The in vivo application of high-voltage pulses is well tolerated, but muscle contractions are usually induced. The electrode and patch design is an important issue to reduce the discomfort of the electrical treatment in humans. This review presents the main findings in the field of electroporation-namely, transdermal drug delivery. Particular attention is paid to proposed enhancement mechanisms and trends in the field of topical and transdermal delivery.",

Twelve female hound-mix dogs were used in this study. A total of six pairs of electrodes were implanted on the stomach, duodenum, and ascending colon. Bilateral truncal vagotomy was performed in six of the dogs. One experiment was designed to study the effects of the pacing frequency on the entrainment of gut slow waves. Another experiment was designed to study the modulatory effects of the vagal and sympathetic pathways on gastrointestinal pacing. The frequency of slow waves was 4.88 +/- 0.23 cpm (range, 4-6 cpm) in the stomach and 19.68 +/- 0.31 cpm (range, 18-22 cpm) in the duodenum. There were no consistent or dominant frequencies of the slow waves in the colon. The optimal parameters to entrain slow waves were: frequency of 1.1 intrinsic frequency (IF; 10% higher than IF) and pulse width of 150-450 ms (mean, 320.0 +/- 85.4 ms) for the stomach, and 1.1 IF and 10-20 ms for the small intestine.

Experiments carried out at pH 3 and 8 showed the formation of different OPs, depending on pH. The analysis of samples with and without tertiary butanol (t-BuOH) revealed the influence of OH radical reactions. The OH radical exposure was measured by adding a probe compound (para-chlorobenzoic acid, pCBA). Elucidation of chemical structures confirmed the formation of aldehyde moieties as well as the occurrence of hydroxylation reactions. Several reaction pathways for the formation of the oxidation products are proposed. Analysis of ozonated raw wastewater and the effluent of a municipal wastewater treatment plant spiked with 10 microM metoprolol exhibited a similar OP formation pattern as detected in the reaction system at pH 8 without a radical scavenger. This indicates a significant impact of OH radical exposure on the formation of OPs in real wastewater matrices.",

    "119": "Hypertension is an important contributor to the risk of cardiovascular disease and death, yet success in achieving blood pressure (BP) control has been limited. Most patients will require 2 or more medications to control their BP. Nurse practitioners play a vital role in treating patients with hypertension and can help overcome barriers to reaching BP goals. Measures to improve therapeutic adherence include educating the patient and simplifying the medication regimen. Use of single-pill combination therapy, which reduces the pill burden, can contribute to improved medication persistence and compliance. Rational combination therapy combines medications with complementary mechanisms of action, such as a calcium channel blocker (CCB) and a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitor; it is often more efficacious than monotherapy and allows the use of lower doses of the individual components, which usually results in improved tolerability. Current guidelines support the first-line use of combination therapy in many patients. Initiating therapy with a RAAS inhibitor-based combination can reduce BP and cardiovascular risk and may be more effective for some patients than traditional combinations such as a beta-blocker with a diuretic. Adverse events associated with any medication can compromise its therapeutic usefulness. Peripheral edema is a common and dose-dependent adverse event seen with dihydropyridine CCBs, which can cause marked patient distress, reduce adherence to therapy, and result in dose reduction or even discontinuation of therapy. In most cases, CCB-induced peripheral edema can be managed successfully, and CCB therapy need not be abandoned. Management strategies include nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic measures. Several clinical trials have shown a lower incidence of peripheral edema in patients receiving combination therapy with a CCB and a RAAS blocker compared with CCB monotherapy.",

    "129": "Antihypertensive agents may differ in their effects on central systolic blood pressure, and this may contribute to treatment-related differences in cardiovascular outcomes. In a substudy of the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcome Trial, we investigated whether directly measured carotid systolic blood pressure differed between people randomized to amlodipine- and atenolol-based therapies and whether this is accounted for by differences in wave reflection patterns. Additional analysis was undertaken to establish whether differences in carotid systolic blood pressure predicted left ventricular mass, accounting for between-treatment differences in left ventricular mass index. Blood pressure and flow velocity were measured in the right carotid artery of 259 patients. Wave intensity analysis was used to separate and quantify forward and backward waves. Brachial blood pressure did not differ significantly between groups, but carotid systolic blood pressure (127 [12] versus 133 [15] mm Hg; P<0.001), the ratio of backward:forward pressure (0.48 [0.17] versus 0.53 [0.19]; P=0.01), and wave reflection index (19.8% [10.9%] versus 23.3% [13.3%]; P=0.02) were significantly lower in patients randomized to amlodipine-based therapy. Left ventricular mass index was also lower in this group, and adjustment for carotid blood pressure attenuated treatment differences to a greater extent than brachial blood pressure. Carotid systolic blood pressure was also a significant independent predictor of left ventricular mass index in a multivariate model. Carotid systolic blood pressure is lower in people randomized to amlodipine-based compared with atenolol-based treatment despite there being no significant difference in brachial blood pressure. This difference is attributable to a lesser magnitude of wave reflection in patients randomized to the amlodipine-based regimen.", 
    "130": "Neuronal activity in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), as well as sympathetic outflow from the PVN, is basally restrained by a GABAergic inhibitory tone. We recently showed that two complementary GABA(A) receptor-mediated modalities underlie inhibition of PVN neuronal activity: a synaptic, quantal inhibitory modality (IPSCs, I(phasic)) and a sustained, non-inactivating modality (I(tonic)). Here, we investigated the role of neuronal and/or glial GABA transporters (GATs) in modulating these inhibitory modalities, and assessed their impact on the activity of RVLM-projecting PVN neurons (PVN-RVLM neurons), and on PVN influence of renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA). Patch-clamp recordings were obtained from retrogradely labelled PVN-RVLM neurons in a slice preparation. The non-selective GAT blocker nipecotic acid (100-300 microM) caused a large increase in GABA(A)I(tonic), and reduced IPSC frequency. These effects were replicated by beta-alanine (100 microM), but not by SKF 89976A (30 microM), relatively selective blockers of GAT3 and GAT1 isoforms, respectively. Similar effects were evoked by the gliotoxin L-alpha-aminodipic acid (2 mM). GAT blockade attenuated the firing activity of PVN-RVLM neurons. Moreover, PVN microinjections of nipecotic acid in the whole animal diminished ongoing RSNA. A robust GAT3 immunoreactivity was observed in the PVN, which partially colocalized with the glial marker GFAP. Altogether, our results indicate that by modulating ambient GABA levels and the efficacy of GABA(A)I(tonic), PVN GATs, of a likely glial location, contribute to setting a basal tone of PVN-RVLM firing activity, and PVN-driven RSNA.",

However, despite lowering blood pressure, beta-blockers have never shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in uncomplicated hypertension. Also, beta-blockers do not prevent heart failure in hypertension any better than any other antihypertensive drug class. Beta-blockers have been shown to increase the risk on new onset diabetes. When compared with nondiuretic antihypertensive drugs, beta-blockers increase all-cause mortality by 8% and stroke by 30% in patients with new onset diabetes. Beta-blockers are useful for rate control in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation but do not help restore sinus rhythm or have antifibrillatory effects in the atria. Beta-blockers provide symptomatic relief in patients with chronic stable angina but do not reduce the risk of myocardial infarction. Adverse effects of beta-blockers are common including fatigue, dizziness, depression and sexual dysfunction. However, beta-blockers remain a cornerstone in the management of patients having suffered a myocardial infarction and for patients with heart failure. Thus, recent evidence argues against universal cardioprotective properties of beta-blockers but attest to their usefulness for specific cardiovascular indications.", 
    "136": "1. The spleen contains approximately one-third of all the body's platelets. These platelets are relatively larger and haemostatically more active than platelets in the systemic circulation and can be released into the systemic circulation by stimulation of alpha-adrenoceptors or inhibition of beta-adrenoceptors. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of selective (bisoprol) and non-selective (carvedilol) beta-blockers agents on mean platelet volume (MPV) and spleen size in hypertensive patients at rest and after exercise. 2. Blood pressure, heart rate, platelet count, MPV and spleen volume were measured in 18 newly diagnosed hypertensive patients, as well as in nine healthy control subjects, subjected to treadmill exercise test at their first visit and, for the hypertensive group, after 15 and 30 days of treatment with the selective beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist bisoprolol 5 mg/day (n = 9) or the non-selective alpha(1)-, beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist carvedilol 25 mg/day (n = 9). 3. Increases in resting MPV values with concomitant decreases in spleen volume were found after 15 and 30 days treatment with either bisoprolol or carvedilol. The pronounced decrease in splenic volume after exercise and the increased MPV and platelet counts seen at first visit were halved after 15 and 30 days of treatment with either drug. 4. We conclude that in hypertensive patients treated with either selective or non-selective beta-blockers, the spleen contracts and MPV increases, which may increase the risk of atherothrombosis.", 
    "137": "Although women account for a significant proportion of the growing heart failure epidemic, they have been poorly represented in clinical trials. As emerging epidemiologic data reveal a growing prevalence and burden of disease among women, it is increasingly important that treating physicians and researchers recognize sex-based differences. Despite the overall incidence of heart failure being lower in women compared with men, the magnitude of improvement in survival over the last several decades has been less apparent in women. Women with heart failure are more likely to be older, have preserved systolic function and nonischemic cardiomyopathy. While clinical trials have demonstrated improved outcomes among heart failure patients, they have predominantly included men, yielding results that are sometimes inadequately powered to detect a benefit for women. Without adequate representation of women in clinical trials, one cannot assume that the same level of therapeutic evidence also applies to women. Nonetheless, it appears that beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors provide the same survival benefits in women with systolic dysfunction as in men. In addition, some studies suggest that angiotensin-receptor blockers may lead to a better survival in women when compared with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Focused research is needed to understand and guide the management of women with heart failure.",

Their results, namely the risk associated with the combination of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), the benefits of an initial therapy with a fixed-dose combination of calcium channel blocker and ACE inhibitor, the effectiveness of blood pressure reduction in patients > 80 years, and the introduction of oral renin inhibitors in the market will enormously impact clinical practice.", 
    "139": "Amiodarone and sotalol are frequently used in the treatment of atrial fibrillation. However, oral and intravenous (IV) therapy with these drugs has suboptimal efficacy and is associated with serious extracardiac side effects.

Goats (n = 27) were randomised into 5 groups receiving either IPC vehicle, amiodarone (IV or IPC) or dl-sotalol (IV or IPC). Epicardial and endocardial atrial effective refractory period and atrial response to burst pacing (rapid atrial response, RAR) were assessed before and after 3 hours of drug infusion at 2 mg.kg.h. IPC delivery produced steeply decreasing drug concentrations from epicardium to endocardium in both atria and ventricles. Plasma drug concentrations were significantly lower in IPC than in IV groups. IPC amiodarone and sotalol reduced epicardial RAR inducibility (-74% +/- 20% and -66% +/- 30%, respectively) compared with IV delivery (-11% +/- 17% and -17% +/- 28%, respectively; P < 0.05). Endocardial RAR inducibility was only reduced in the IPC amiodarone group (-70% +/- 17%, P < 0.05). In conclusion, IPC delivery of amiodarone and sotalol increases atrial drug concentration and antiarrhythmic effects at reduced plasma drug concentrations. These potential benefits are particularly prominent for IPC delivered amiodarone.",

On ECG measurement part, the study was focused on some new morphology-related features including T-peak to T-end (TpTe) interval, T wave flatness, T wave symmetric, and T wave notch. Two types of transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR) were created: global and localized heterogeneities. Vector magnitude and principal component-based composite leads were formed from multiple chest leads for robustness against large variation of individual lead due to placement and noise issues.

Demographic and infarct characteristics were comparable between both groups. The median follow-up was 3.33 years for cases and 3.69 for controls (P = .02). The left ventricular ejection fraction post-STEMI was 45.1% versus 46.5% (P = .342). During follow-up, 19 cases died versus 24 controls. Cox regression analysis showed no significant difference in survival between cases and controls (relative risk 0.59, 95% CI 0.15-2.30). Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators were implanted in 22 cases and 2 controls (P < .001), but only 2 cases and 1 control patient received appropriate ICD shocks. beta-Blocker use during follow-up was 84.4% in cases versus 76.2% in controls (P = .049). Of cases, 2.5% were rehospitalized for acute MI versus 10.1% of controls (P < .001). The numbers of admissions for acute coronary syndromes and chest pain were not different between groups.",

Although beta-blockers are recommended for all patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) without contraindications, a target heart rate (HR) is recommended only for patients with unstable angina/non ST-elevation myocardial infarction. A contemporary series documenting trends in beta-blocker usage and achieved HR and blood pressures (BP) is not available. The study objectives were to monitor trends in HR and BP in relation to beta-blocker use in a contemporary series of patients with ACS.", 
    "162": "In this observational study, 300 consecutive patients with proven ACS had HR and BP values collected hourly from admission until hospital discharge and averaged at multiple intervals throughout hospital stay. Data on baseline demographic characteristics, beta-blocker doses, and titration schedules, procedures performed, cardiac regimens, concurrent medical issues, and contraindications to therapy were collected.", 
    "163": "Only 5.3% achieved an average HR of 50 to 60 beat/min throughout the hospital stay. Overall, the average HR was 74 beat/min and average BP was 115/64 mm Hg.

    "165": "Increases in firing rate induced in secondary vestibular neurons by microiontophoretic application of glutamate were studied during long-lasting applications of noradrenaline (NA) and/or its antagonists and agonists. Sixty-nine percent of the tested neurons, scattered through all nuclei of the vestibular complex, modified their responsiveness to glutamate in the presence of NA. The effects were depressive in a majority (40%) and enhancing in a minority (29%) of cases. NA application depressed responses to glutamate more often than it increased them in lateral, medial and superior vestibular nuclei, while the reverse was true for the spinal nucleus. The mean intensities of NA-evoked effects were comparable in the various nuclei. The enhancing effects of NA were antagonized by application of the alpha2 receptor antagonist yohimbine, and their depressive effects were enhanced by the beta receptor antagonist timolol. It is concluded that NA exerts a control on the processing of vestibular information and that this modulation is exerted by at least two mechanisms involving alpha2 and beta noradrenergic receptors.", 
    "166": "Central leptin action requires PI3K activity to modulate glucose homeostasis and peripheral metabolism. However, the mechanism behind this phenomenon is not clearly understood. We hypothesize that hypothalamic PI3K activity is important for the modulation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) pathway, PGC1 alpha, and AKT in skeletal muscle (SM). To address this issue, we injected leptin into the lateral ventricle of rats. Hypothalamic JAK2 and AKT were activated by intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of leptin in a time-dependent manner. Central leptin improved tolerance to glucose (GTT), increased PGC1 alpha expression, and AKT, AMPK, ACC and JAK2 phosphorylation in the soleus muscle. Previous ICV administration of either LY294002 or propranolol (IP) blocked these effects. We concluded that the activation of the hypothalamic PI3K pathway is important for leptin-induced AKT phosphorylation, as well as for active catabolic pathway through AMPK and PGC1 alpha in SM. Thus, a defective leptin signalling PI3K pathway in the hypothalamus may contribute to peripheral resistance to insulin associated to diet-induced obesity.",

Data from October 1, 2001-September 30, 2002, were used to define the patients' baseline characteristics. Primary outcome measures were all-cause mortality, COPD exacerbations, and COPD-related hospitalizations. Two approaches were used: first, treatment assignment was based on drug therapy at baseline, and second, exposure was measured as a time-varying covariate. Treatment groups were stratified based on propensity to receive theophylline. Mortality was compared by using Cox proportional hazards models, and other outcomes were compared with use of negative binomial models. Comparisons were conducted within individual treatment regimens that were the same with the exception of theophylline. Patients treated with ipratropium plus theophylline (largest group) compared with those treated with ipratropium alone had a 1.11-fold increase in the risk of death (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.18). For each of the other regimens, the risk of mortality associated with theophylline was greater than that in the regimens without theophylline (hazard ratios [HRs] 1.17-1.31). In the time-varying exposure analysis, theophylline (HR 1.23, 95% CI 1.09-1.39) was associated with an increased mortality risk.",

The most common appropriate indications were exclusion of coronary artery disease (91 %, 41 / 45), coronary anomalies (80 %, 36 / 45), and follow-up after coronary artery bypass grafting (53 %, 24 / 45). Each center examined on average 243 +/- 310 patients in 2007 and the number of centers performing cardiac CT increased significantly in 2007 (p = 0.035) compared with the preceding year.

However, its effects on the coronary circulation and the heart have not been examined in vivo. The present study was therefore planned to determine the primary in vivo effect of IMD1-47 on coronary blood flow and cardiac function and the involvement of the autonomic nervous system and nitric oxide (NO). In 35 anesthetized pigs, IMD1-47, infused into the left anterior descending coronary artery at doses of 87.2 pmol/min, at constant heart rate and arterial blood pressure, augmented coronary blood flow and cardiac function. These responses were graded in a further five pigs by increasing the infused dose of IMD1-47 between 0.81 and 204.1 pmol/min. In the 35 pigs, the blockade of cholinergic receptors (intravenous atropine, 5 pigs), alpha-adrenoceptors (intravenous phentolamine, 5 pigs), and beta1-adrenoceptors (intravenous atenolol, 5 pigs) did not abolish the cardiac response to IMD1-47, the effects of which were prevented by blockade of beta2-adrenoceptors (intravenous butoxamine, 5 pigs), NO synthase (intracoronary N(omega)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester, 5 pigs), and calcitonin-related receptors (intracoronary CGRP8-37/AM22-52, 10 pigs). In porcine coronary endothelial cells, IMD1-47 induced the phosphorylation of endothelial NO synthase and NO production through cAMP signaling leading to ERK, Akt, and p38 activation, which was prevented by the inhibition of beta2-adrenoceptors, calcitonin-related receptor complexes, and K+ channels. In conclusion, IMD1-47 primarily augmented coronary blood flow and cardiac function through the involvement of calcitonin-related receptor complexes and beta2-adrenoreceptor-mediated NO release. The intracellular signaling involved cAMP-dependent activation of kinases and the opening of K+ channels.", 
    "190": "Spontaneous neuronal activity plays an important role in the development of the brain. Developmental changes in the spontaneous activity pattern of neuronal networks in vitro have been extensively studied by using the microelectrode array (MEA) recording system. However, little is known about the transition of spontaneous intracellular calcium dynamics, and the relationship between calcium transients and electrical activity during development. In the present paper, we carry out simultaneous recording of spontaneous electrical activity and intracellular calcium transients of rat cortical networks cultured on MEA. In one-week cultures, periodic synchronized bursts are observed and are followed by synchronized calcium transients. In three-week cultures, synchronized calcium transients are rarely observed despite the presence of highly complicated synchronized activity. Between these two states, in two-week cultures, slow, radial propagation of calcium waves independent of electrical activity is observed. Pharmacological treatments with the purinergic receptor antagonist suramin and gap junction blocker 18- beta glycyrrhetinic acid reveal that the spontaneous radial calcium waves are mediated by the astrocytic network, and suggest that the astrocytic calcium waves can influence the electrical firing patterns of networks by locally affecting neuronal signaling. These results indicate that the various dynamics of intracellular calcium transients regulate the network maturation processes.",
