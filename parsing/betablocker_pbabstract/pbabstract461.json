    "0": "The role beta-adrenoceptors in the control of venous tone is not clear. This study examines the dose-response effects of isoprenaline, a non-selective beta-adrenoceptor agonist, on mean circulatory filling pressure (MCFP), an index of body venous tone, in conscious and unrestrained rats. Dose-response curves of isoprenaline were constructed in three groups of rats, namely, I, intact; III, pretreated with the ganglionic blocker hexamethonium; and V, pretreated with noradrenaline. Three additional groups, Groups II, IV and VI, served as time controls and were treated similar to I, III and V, respectively, except that they were given normal saline in place of isoprenaline. The infusion of isoprenaline in intact rats dose dependently decreased mean arterial pressure (MAP) and increased heart rate (HR) and MCFP while in the ganglionic-blocked rat, it caused similar effects on MAP and HR but had no significant effects on MCFP. In rats given noradrenaline, isoprenaline again decreased MAP and increased HR and, in contrast to the other two groups, it decreased MCFP. The results show that isoprenaline has variable venous effects depending on existing venous tone. It causes reflex-mediated venoconstriction under normal conditions due to its hypotensive effects and direct venodilatation when venous tone is elevated by the infusion of noradrenaline.", 
    "1": "Brown adipocytes differentiated in primary cell culture were found to contain a type II iodothyronine 5'-deiodinase (5'D). Incubation of confluent cells with norepinephrine or dibutyryl-cAMP caused up to 17-fold increase in 5'D activity with a maximum after 8 h. Activation of 5'D required mRNA and protein synthesis and was accompanied by parallel, up to 5.8-fold increase in the amount of mitochondrial uncoupling protein with a maximum after 24 h. Analysis of adrenergic stimulation of 5'D suggested predominant involvement of the beta-receptors and increased intracellular cAMP levels, while the contribution of alpha 1-receptors was small.", 
    "2": "Incubation of cardiac sarcolemma in the presence of dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH), a catecholamine biosynthetic enzyme, increased beta-adrenergic receptor density by 68% as measured by [3H]dihydroalprenolol (DHA) binding. The addition of DBH to plasma membranes isolated from brain, kidney, skeletal muscle, liver and intestine did not alter [3H]DHA binding. Cardiac alpha-receptors were unaffected under similar conditions. Since DBH is coreleased with norepinephrine, these results indicate that a functional coupling of the putative beta-adrenergic receptor with DBH may exist in cardiac muscle.", 
    "3": "Clinical evidence implicates the cerebral cortex in the genesis of ECG changes and cardiac arrhythmias. Such findings are not infrequent following acute cortical stroke and during partial seizures. Electrical stimulation of the cerebral cortex, however, only rarely and inconsistently results in cardiac changes. When encountered, attendant alterations in blood pressure and respiration occur; consequently, it is unclear whether the cardiac effects are primary or secondary to these. Phasic insular cortex microstimulation linked to the ECG cycle, a new technique, elicits only heart rate effects, eliminating confounding variables. The insular cortex was chosen for study because of its profuse autonomic and limbic connectivity. Cardiac chronotropic sites were demonstrated in 37 chloralose-anesthetized rats, with tachycardia represented in the rostral posterior insula, and bradycardia in the caudal posterior insula. Both effects were abolished by atenolol but not by atropine, implying their mediation by respective increases or decreases in sympathetic activity. This is the first report of the demonstration of a cortical region wherein stimulation affects heart rate and no other parameter.", 
    "4": "Fetal heart rate was monitored during the administration of esmolol 100 micrograms/kg/min to a 36-year-old, 29-week pregnant woman who was undergoing craniotomy for surgical treatment of six cerebral aneurysms. During stable general anesthesia, sodium nitroprusside was administered to induce moderate hypotension; at the same time, esmolol was infused to control maternal tachycardia. Within minutes after starting the esmolol infusion, maternal heart rate decreased from 100 beats/minute to 65 beats/minute, and fetal heart rate decreased from 160 beats/minute to 130 beats/minute. Upon termination of the infusion 3 hours later, both maternal and fetal heart rate returned to preinfusion values. No adverse effects of esmolol infusion were noted in the mother or fetus.", 
    "5": "This study examined the relations among beta-adrenergic blocker use, various correlates of left ventricular function and the chance of developing congestive heart failure in patients after myocardial infarction. The study was performed with the placebo group of the Multicenter Diltiazem Post-Infarction Trial. Ejection fraction data were available in 1,084 patients; of these, 557 were receiving a beta-blocker and 527 were not. In addition to ejection fraction, other correlates of left ventricular function included the presence or absence of pulmonary rales, chest X-ray film evidence of pulmonary congestion and the presence of an S3 gallop. Beta-blocker use was less frequent in patients with an ejection fraction less than 30%, rales, an S3 gallop and pulmonary congestion on chest X-ray film. Twenty-one percent of patients with an ejection fraction less than 30%, 42% of patients with rales, 28% of patients with an S3 gallop and 28% of patients with pulmonary congestion were receiving beta-blocker therapy. For every correlate of left ventricular function, the chance of developing congestive heart failure was greater in patients with diminished left ventricular function than in those without. For each level of left ventricular function, the chance of developing congestive heart failure requiring treatment was greater in patients not taking a beta-blocker.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "6": "The presence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is of poor prognosis in essential arterial hypertension, but it may regress under antihypertensive treatment. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium antagonists, centrally acting antihypertensive agents and beta-blockers with low intrinsic sympathomimetic activity constantly reduce the left ventricular mass. This stands in contrast with diuretics and vasodilators which induce stimulation of the sympathetic and/or renin-angiotensin systems and usually have no effect on LVH. Animal experiments have shown that regression of LHV has no adverse effect on the myocardial changes aimed at correcting the LVH-associated abnormalities (collagen content, changes in isomyosins, density of beta-adrenergic receptors, etc.) and that it improves the coronary haemodynamics disturbed by LVH. In clinical practice, reducing the ventricular mass does not modify the left ventricular systolic function, usually improves the diastolic function precociously altered by LVH and seems to reduce the LVH-induced ventricular hyperexcitability. The regression of LVH under antihypertensive treatment should result in a lesser cardiovascular risk in hypertensive patients.", 
    "7": "To provide insight into the protective effect of propranolol on mortality after myocardial infarction observed in the beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial, the time of occurrence of sudden cardiac death was examined in this population. Between 5 A.M. and 11 A.M., 25 of the 56 total deaths (38%) occurred in the placebo patients compared with 11 of 45 (24%) in the propranolol patients. Excluding this period, there were nearly equal numbers of sudden cardiac deaths in the propranolol and placebo groups. This retrospective analysis suggests that beta blockade is protective during the morning hours when a surge of sympathetic activity may increase the risk of sudden cardiac death.", 
    "8": "Circadian variations of transient myocardial ischemia and heart rate have been identified, but the rhythms and their response to beta blockade have not been fully characterized. Time-series analysis, a mathematical technique to describe oscillatory activity occurring within a continuous data set was used, to address these issues. Nine men with coronary artery disease underwent 72 hours of ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring during therapy with placebo or metoprolol. During administration of placebo, ischemic time and heart rate showed a primary peak with a periodicity of approximately 24 hours with a tight coupling between the 2 variables and a secondary peak with a periodicity of 5 to 8 hours. During metoprolol therapy, heart rate and ischemic variation were reduced and the 24-hour periodicity for heart rate only remained. The 24-hour periodicity for ischemia was eliminated, but the data with 5- to 8-hour periodicity became the major component of the signal.", 
    "9": "Beta-adrenergic blockers have been shown definitely to reduce the incidence of total mortality, cardiovascular mortality, sudden death and nonfatal reinfarction in survivors of an acute myocardial infarction. The mechanisms to explain this protective action of beta blockers have never been elucidated conclusively, and include the antiarrhythmic and myocardial oxygen demand-reducing effects of the drugs. An antithrombotic mechanism has also been suggested. However, beta blockers have relatively weak antiplatelet activity, suggesting that their antithrombotic effects may be related to prevention of coronary artery plaque rupture and the subsequent propagation of an occlusive arterial thrombus rather than direct anticoagulant action. The therapeutic ability of beta blockers to attenuate the hemodynamic consequences of catecholamine surges, may protect a vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque from fracture, thereby reducing risk of coronary thrombosis, myocardial infarction and death.", 
    "10": "Clinical observations suggest that beta-adrenergic blocking agents can modify the circadian occurrence of a variety of ischemic events. Morning awakening is associated with a rapid increase in blood pressure and pulse, serum catecholamine content and platelet activation, at a time of decreased blood thrombolytic activity. Beta-adrenergic blocking agents have the potential to modify many of these events. Current data indicate that these agents modify blood pressure and pulse, but do not prevent their early morning increase. In addition, beta-adrenergic blocking agents decrease ventricular ectopy and its circadian variation. Recent studies in humans indicate, however, that metoprolol does not affect the circadian increase in platelet activity or serum catecholamines. The specific mechanism by which beta blockers affect the circadian occurrence of ischemic events remains uncertain.", 
    "11": "Two studies were conducted to measure the effect of serum half-life on beta-blocker-related heart rate reduction throughout the 24-hour period. In the first study, nadolol, atenolol and pindolol were associated with significant (p less than 0.01) heart rate reduction even at 24 hours after dose. Nadolol, with a plasma half-life of 15.5 hours, had the most pronounced heart rate-lowering effect 24 hours after the daily dose compared to pindolol, which had a half-life of 5.5 hours. In a randomized, double-blind, crossover study, nadolol and atenolol had similar effects 3 to 4 hours after the daily dose. Nadolol, however, produced greater suppression of heart rate and double product (blood pressure x heart rate) than atenolol (compared to placebo) 24 hours after ingestion of the daily dose. On ambulatory electrocardiography 24 hours after medication administration, 80 to 100% of the heart rate-attenuating effect of nadolol was maintained versus only 20 to 45% of atenolol's effect. Statistically significant (p less than 0.05) reductions in heart rate were produced by nadolol, but not by atenolol, between 4 and 5 A.M., 6 and 7 A.M., 8 and 9 A.M. and 9 and 10 A.M. Furthermore, nadolol remained at 52% of peak blood level at 24 hours, whereas atenolol was at 20%. The data from these 2 studies indicate that significant differences in duration of action exist between beta blockers.", 
    "12": "A population-based, case-control study was conducted to determine whether beta blockers, used for the treatment of high blood pressure, prevent first events of coronary heart disease. All study subjects were health-maintenance organization enrollees with pharmacologically treated hypertension. Patients presented in 1982 to 1984 with new coronary heart disease, and control subjects were a probability sample of eligible hypertensive enrollees free of coronary heart disease. With the investigators blind to case-control status, the subjects' medical records were reviewed for other coronary risk factors, and the health-maintenance organization's computerized pharmacy database was used to ascertain the use of beta blockers. A larger proportion of controls than cases were using beta blockers. This difference was confined to the subgroup with nonfatal myocardial infarctions. For current use, the estimated relative risk for nonfatal myocardial infarction was 0.62 (95% confidence interval, 0.39 to 0.99). Among current users of beta blockers, higher doses conferred greater protection. Past use and total lifetime intake of beta blockers were only weakly associated with case-control status. The current use of beta blockers may prevent first events of nonfatal myocardial infarction in patients with high blood pressure.", 
    "13": "The effect of the immobilization procedure on the conformation of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) was investigated by recording the fluorescence spectra of native and immobilized AGP. A 20-nm red shift was obtained for the immobilized form of AGP compared with the emission maximum of 338 nm obtained for native AGP. This demonstrates that the tryptophan residues are exposed on the protein surface after immobilization, indicating that the immobilized form of AGP has a more unfolded structure than the native AGP. The effect of N,N-dimethyloctylamine on the enantioselectivity for some fentiazine derivatives, observed with immobilized AGP, was equal to that obtained with AGP as a chiral complexing agent in the mobile phase. This demonstrates that even though the immobilization procedure affects the conformation of the protein there still exist large similarities between native and immobilized AGP concerning chiral recognition. The adsorption isotherm of (-)-terodiline was studied by use of the breakthrough technique. The adsorption isotherm indicates that (-)-terodiline is adsorbed to one site with high affinity and at least one more site with lower affinity. It was also observed that the enantiomers of amines, acids and non-protolytic compounds compete with the cationic compound, (-)-terodiline, for binding to the same sites. The beta-receptor blocking agents atenolol, metoprolol, pindolol, alprenolol, oxprenolol and propranolol were resolved on a CHIRAL-AGP column. The retention and enantioselectivity are highly influenced by the structure of the solute and the nature of the uncharged mobile phase additives. Separation factors of 1.2-1.8 were obtained for the beta-blockers under the studied conditions.", 
    "14": "The finite dose in vitro percutaneous absorption kinetics of timolol, a beta-blocker, was studied. The flux of timolol across excised human abdominal cadaver skin was measured over a period of 72 h following application of a 40-microns thickness patch containing 5, 10, or 20% (w/v) timolol free base. Amounts of timolol in the patch and skin were also determined at 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after the application of the 20% (w/v) patch. The mean diffusion and partition parameters were estimated to be 0.018 h-1 and 125.9 microns, respectively, using a newly developed theory. Diffusion and partition parameters were estimated using the values for amounts of a drug eventually partitioning into the perfusing water, as well as two newly proposed conceptual parameter values, AUCAv and AUCAs which are the AUCs of drug amounts in vehicle and skin, respectively. The dose-dependent skin-timolol interaction is also discussed.", 
    "15": "The efficacy and the clinical and biological safety of labetalol were assessed, in primary care, in an ambulatory hypertensive elderly population, with systolo-diastolic hypertension (mean 175 +/- 14/100 +/- 7 mmHg) monitored during a 6 month period by general practitioners. Two hundred and sixty six of the 309 patients recruited (86%) completed the study, with satisfactory compliance. Mean blood pressure reduction after six months treatment was 27.6/17.7 mmHg and 25.9/17.4 mmHg (p less than 0.001) supine and standing respectively; and 75 p. cent of the patients who tolerated the treatment had their blood pressure normalized (BP less than 160/95 mmHg) with monotherapy by labetalol, posology ranging from 100 to 200 mg b.i.d. in 9/10th of them. Maximal antihypertensive effect, almost obtained within 4 months of treatment, was equivalent in smokers and non smokers (blood pressure normalization 84% vs 74.4%, p = 0.29) and less in obese patients compared to non obese (68% vs 80%, p less than 0.05). Drug withdrawal rate for side effects was only 7.4 p. cent and clinical and biological tolerance to labetalol was satisfactory in most patients. This 6 month survey in primary care confirmed the efficacy of monotherapy by labetalol in elderly hypertensive patients, and good compliance to treatment with a drug well tolerated in this population.", 
    "16": "The effect of propranolol administration on regional coronary haemodynamics were investigated in 14 patients with stable exertional angina and isolated left anterior descending artery disease. Thermodilution was used to measure great cardiac vein flow (GCVF) and anterior regional coronary resistance (ARCR) under control conditions, at peak atrial pacing, after i.v. propranolol administration (0.1 mg kg-1) and at the peak of repeated atrial pacing. Propranolol did not change peak pacing heart rate, systolic blood pressure or double product. Peak pacing GCVF decreased slightly but non-significantly after drug administration from 84 +/- 20 to 79 +/- 24 ml min-1, while ARCR increased, but again non-significantly, from 1.36 +/- 0.44 to 1.45 +/- 0.45. Analysis of individual patient responses revealed that propranolol prolonged peak pacing time and hence peak pacing heart rate (from 126 +/- 24 to 140 +/- 23 beats min-1, P less than 0.05) in five patients. In such patients, peak pacing systolic blood pressure was lower than the pre-propranolol atrial pacing (145 +/- 35 vs 165 +/- 33, P less than 0.001) so that double product remained unchanged. Moreover, peak pacing ARCR did not change after propranolol (pre-propranolol 1.47 +/- 0.46, after propranolol 1.40 +/- 0.56 mmHg.ml-1.min, P = ns) while it increased significantly in the nine patients who did not improve after the drug (before propranolol 1.30 +/- 0.44, after propranolol 1.48 +/- 0.41 mmHg.ml-1.min, P less than 0.02). These data suggest that the response to atrial pacing after i.v. propranolol administration is variable as some patients tolerate higher heart rates while others do not.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "17": "To investigate the antianginal efficacy and tolerability of felodipine, a new dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, 20 patients with stable exertional angina, not completely controlled by beta-blocker monotherapy, entered a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Patients on standard beta-blocker therapy, who had at least 3 weekly anginal episodes and a reproducible exercise test (stopped for angina and ECG signs of ischaemia) at the end of 2 weeks placebo treatment, were eligible for the study. They were randomized to one sequence of treatment: felodipine 5 mg twice daily for 2 weeks followed by placebo for a further 2 weeks, or vice versa. Beta-blocker treatment was unchanged throughout the study. A treadmill test was carried out at the end of each crossover period, 2-4 h after drug administration. The number of anginal attacks and nitroglycerin consumption was recorded on a diary card. At rest, felodipine significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced standing systolic but not diastolic blood pressure. Heart rate was not modified by the active treatment. At ischaemic threshold and at peak exercise, heart rate, systolic blood pressure and rate-pressure product remained unchanged. Exercise duration was increased by felodipine (P less than 0.01) and maximal ST change was reduced (P less than 0.01). Time to 1 mm ST depression was prolonged non-significantly by felodipine (basal 5.7 +/- 1.5, felodipine 7.4 +/- 2.0, placebo 6.6 +/- 1.5 min). The number of patients who stopped exercise due to angina and ST change was 20/20 at baseline, 16/20 with placebo and 10/20 with felodipine. Felodipine significantly reduced weekly anginal episodes (P less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "18": "The effect of clonidine on the dose requirements of labetalol and isoflurane for hypotension was studied in 20 adult patients undergoing middle-ear surgery. Group I (10 patients) received as premedication only pethidine 1 mg.kg-1 i.m., and Group II (10 patients) clonidine 4-5 micrograms.kg-1 p.o. in addition to pethidine. Fentanyl was used for analgesia and d-tubocurarine for muscle relaxation. The dose of labetalol required to induce hypotension to the mean arterial pressure (MAP) 50 mmHg (6.7 kPa) was 0.85 +/- 0.08 mg.kg-1 in Group I, and 0.56 +/- 0.08 mg.kg-1 in Group II (P less than 0.05). The mean isoflurane concentration in inspiratory gas for the maintenance of hypotension was 0.8 +/- 0.1 vol% in Group I, and 0.6 +/- 0.1 vol% in Group II (P less than 0.05). Before hypotension, MAP decreased significantly in Group II, and the heart rate (HR) decreased in both groups. There were no significant differences in MAP and HR between the groups during any phase. Urine flow rates (UF) were lower in Group II (0.23 +/- 0.04 ml.min-1) than in Group I (0.68 +/- 0.16 ml.min-1) before hypotension (P less than 0.05) and during hypotension (0.08 +/- 0.02 ml.min-1 vs. 0.68 +/- 0.32 ml.min-1, P less than 0.05). After anaesthesia, there was no difference in UF between the groups. The results indicate that clonidine can be used for deliberate hypotension to decrease the dose requirements of labetalol and isoflurane.", 
    "19": "1. Three oxidations of the enantiomers of propranolol were studied in human liver microsomes under two reaction conditions. Previous in vitro studies had established that two of the livers were from poor metaboliser (PM) phenotypes for the debrisoquine 4-hydroxylase (cytochrome P-450IID6) and the remaining seven were from extensive metaboliser (EM) phenotypes. 2. In the presence of NADPH and oxygen 4- and 5-hydroxylation of propranolol occurred in microsomes from all nine livers, as did propranolol N-desisopropylation. R(+)-propranolol was oxidized preferentially along the three pathways, although enantioselectivity observed for N-desisopropylation may have arisen not only from stereoselectivity in formation rates, but also from stereoselectivity in subsequent microsomal metabolism, possibly by monoamine oxidase. The involvement of monoamine oxidase in the further microsomal metabolism of N-desisopropylpropranolol was indicated by inhibition of the metabolism of this compound when incubated with phenelzine. 3. Cumene hydroperoxide has been proposed to support only the activity of cytochrome P450IID6. This is consistent with the observations that a) propranolol 4- and 5-hydroxylation occurred in microsomes from the EM livers only and b) side-chain oxidation was not observed under these conditions in either PM or EM livers. 4. Using cumene hydroperoxide to support the reactions, the 4-hydroxylation of propranolol showed little enantioselectivity, whereas S(-)-propranolol was 5-hydroxylated about twice as fast as the R(+)-enantiomer. There were highly significant correlations between the rates of 4- and 5-hydroxylation of R(+)-propranolol (r = 0.96, P less than 0.001, n = 7 livers) and of S(-)-propranolol (r = 0.98, P less than 0.001). Both oxidations were described by single-site Michaelis-Menten kinetics. 5. The findings suggest that P450IID6 is involved in both the 4- and 5-hydroxylations of propranolol, but that these metabolites can also be formed by other P450 isoenzymes. It is confirmed that P450IID6 does not contribute to the N-desisopropylation of propranolol. Furthermore, the finding that mephenytoin did not inhibit the appearance of this metabolite is not consistent with the results of in vivo studies suggesting the involvement of the same enzyme in the side-chain oxidation of propranolol and the 4-hydroxylation of mephenytoin.", 
    "20": "1. The antihypertensive effect of dilevalol, a compound which combines beta-adrenoceptor blocking and vasodilating properties due to beta 2-adrenoceptor agonism, was studied in nineteen patients with isolated systolic hypertension (ISH). A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial with two 4 week treatment periods was used to compare the efficacy of once daily dosing with dilevalol (in the range of 100-400 mg daily) against placebo. Assessment of response involved both casual blood pressure readings (amongst all patients) and 24 h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (in ten of the nineteen patients). 2. A mean fall of 12/5 mm Hg (s.e. mean 3/2, P less than 0.05) and 9/3 mm Hg (s.e. mean 3/2, P less than 0.05) in supine and standing blood pressure respectively was observed with dilevalol. Mean heart rate was unchanged. The ambulatory monitoring profile demonstrated a smaller reduction in mean blood pressure (7/8 mm Hg) over the 24 h period and a reduction of 10/11 mm Hg over the daytime period. A blunting of the early morning increase in systolic pressure was observed with dilevalol. 3. The drug was well tolerated with light headedness and lethargy being reported more commonly than with placebo. Biochemical parameters were unaffected. 4. It is concluded that dilevalol in the doses used has a small but measurable antihypertensive effect as monotherapy in the treatment of ISH.", 
    "21": "In the present study different heart rate patterns were demonstrated to accompany flight-fight behaviour, orienting behaviour and passive avoidance in rabbits. Flight-fight behaviour was characterized by markedly increased heart rate and diminished overall heart rate variability. The effect was mediated by vagal inhibition and beta-adrenergic activation in a type-specific relation. Orienting behaviour was accompanied by a smaller heart rate increase and the exaggeration of slow heart rate fluctuations. The latter effect was absent during beta-adrenergic blockade suggesting a behaviourally provoked beta-adrenergic activation. Single beta-adrenergic blockade did not change the characteristics of the heart rate fluctuations at rest. During passive avoidance a vagally mediated heart rate deceleration was followed by a slow heart rate return toward the initial heart rate level. This level was not reached during beta-adrenergic blockade. The enhanced overall heart rate variability during passive avoidance was mainly caused by strengthened respiratory-induced heart rate fluctuations and, furthermore, by exaggerated slow rhythmical heart rate fluctuations. The latter effect was not observed during beta-adrenergic blockade and is referred to as an orienting component within passive avoidance. Three individual behavioural types may be differentiated in rabbits 'Weisses Gross-Silber' by stable behavioural characteristics i.e. spontaneous motor activities, preferred postures at rest and coping behaviour. The results of the present study suggest that different neurovegetative reaction types, i.e. dominating beta-adrenergic or vagal activation are correlated with stable behavioural characteristics, especially in terms of preferring active or passive coping behaviour, respectively.", 
    "22": "Slit ventricle syndrome is characterized by chronic or recurring headaches associated with subnormal ventricular volume in patients who have undergone shunt treatment for hydrocephalus. There appear to be at least three pathophysiological mechanisms that cause this syndrome: 1) intermittent shunt malfunction; 2) intracranial hypotension; and 3) paroxysms of increased intracranial pressure in the presence of normal shunt function. To treat seven patients with slit ventricle syndrome caused by paroxysms of elevated intracranial pressure, we successfully used antimigraine therapy rather than standard calvarial expansion procedures. None of these patients has required shunt revision or calvarial expansion during a mean follow-up period of 2 years. The symptoms of slit ventricle syndrome may be a form of \"acquired\" migraine in shunt patients. We suggest that, in clinically stable patients with normal shunt function, treatment against migraine may stabilize symptoms resulting from paroxysms of increased intracranial pressure. Such treatment may prevent unnecessary shunt revisions and/or calvarial expansion procedures.", 
    "23": "Conjunctival fibroblastic proliferation with contracting scar formation has been implicated as a possible cause of glaucoma filtering surgery failure. The effects of glaucoma medications on bulbar conjunctiva were evaluated in both eyes of 20 pigmented rabbits, with 5 rabbits per group each receiving singular topically applied daily doses of either 0.5% timolol, 1% epinephrine, 4% pilocarpine, or artificial tears in a masked fashion for 4 months. Posterior lip sclerectomies were performed in 16 rabbits--4 from each treatment group. The remaining four rabbits served as nonsurgical controls. Four additional rabbits, which had not received eye drops, were included as a nonmedicated control group, with one rabbit serving as a nonsurgical control. Immunostaining was performed to identify the presence of myofibroblasts in fistulized conjunctiva. Treated surgical eyes, regardless of medication, had higher myofibroblastic cell proliferation than treated nonsurgical eyes. Among fistulized eyes, all medications increased cell proliferation, with pilocarpine eliciting the most dramatic increase compared with all other groups.", 
    "24": "The Glaucoma Laser Trial, a multicenter, randomized clinical trial involving 271 patients, was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) as an alternative treatment with topical medication for controlling intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with newly diagnosed, previously, untreated primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Each patient had one eye randomly assigned to ALT (the laser first [LF] eye) and the other eye assigned to timolol maleate 0.5% (the medication first [MF] eye). Medication was initiated or changed for either eye according to the same stepped regimen if the IOP was not controlled. Throughout the 2-year follow-up, LF eyes had lower mean IOPs than MF eyes (1-2 mmHg), and fewer LF eyes than MF eyes required simultaneous prescription of two or more medications to control IOP (P less than 0.001). After 2 years of follow-up, 44% of LF eyes were controlled by ALT, 70% were controlled by ALT or ALT and timolol, and 89% were controlled within the stepped medication regimen. After 2 years, 30% of MF eyes remained controlled by timolol, and 66% were controlled within the stepped regimen. There were no major differences between the two treatment approaches with respect to changes in visual acuity or visual field over the 2 years of follow-up.", 
    "25": "The effects of acetylcholine on glucose and lactate balance and on perfusion flow were studied in isolated rat livers perfused simultaneously via the hepatic artery (100 mmHg, 25-35% of flow) and the portal vein (10 mmHg, 75-65% of flow) with a Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer containing 5 mM-glucose, 2 mM-lactate and 0.2 mM-pyruvate. Arterial acetylcholine (10 microM sinusoidal concentration) caused an increase in glucose and lactate output and a slight decrease in arterial and portal flow. These effects were accompanied by an output of noradrenaline and adrenaline into the hepatic vein. Portal acetylcholine elicited only minor increases in glucose and lactate output, a slight decrease in portal flow and a small increase in arterial flow, and no noradrenaline and adrenaline release. The metabolic and haemodynamic effects of arterial acetylcholine and the output of noradrenaline and adrenaline were strongly inhibited by the muscarinic antagonist atropine (10 microM). The acetylcholine-dependent alterations of metabolism and the output of noradrenaline were not influenced by the alpha 1-blocker prazosin (5 microM), whereas the output of adrenaline was increased. The acetylcholine-dependent metabolic alterations were not inhibited by the beta 2-antagonist butoxamine (10 microM), although the overflow of noradrenaline was nearly completely blocked and the output of adrenaline was slightly decreased. These results allow the conclusion that arterial, but not portal, acetylcholine caused sympathomimetic metabolic effects, without noradrenaline or adrenaline being involved in signal transduction.", 
    "26": "Eighteen patients (14 men and 4 women, aged 36-74 years) treated with metoprolol for a month were included in the study. Twelve had impaired renal function (IRF) with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 7.5-77.1 mL/min and six having normal renal function (NRF) with a GFR of 84.9-113.0 mL/min. Plasma and urine concentrations of felodipine and metabolites, heart rate, and blood pressure were recorded over 24 hours on day 1 after an oral dose of 10 mg felodipine and 0.04 mg 3H-felodipine IV and repeated on day 29 during continuous treatment with felodipine, 10 mg bid. The bioavailability of the oral dose on day 1 and day 29 was 13% and 12.5%, respectively. The terminal plasma half-life (t1/2) on day 29 was 22 hours and systemic clearance was 490 mL/min on day 1 and 434 mL/min on day 29 (NS). There were no differences in these parameters between NRF and IRF. The protein binding determined by equilibrium dialysis in the six patients with the lowest GFR was 99.74% on day 1 and 99.73% on day 29 and did not differ significantly from previously reported values in healthy subjects. The mean supine blood pressure before the acute dose of felodipine was 164/96 mm Hg in the IRF patients and 145/95 mm Hg in the NRF patients. A maximum decrease of 37/22 mm Hg and 32/19 mm Hg, respectively, was seen within 1.5 hours after dose and at 12 hours the reduction was 12/9 and 15/10 mm Hg, respectively, compared to baseline values. At steady state the morning blood pressure before dose was 152/87 mm Hg in the IRF patients and 129/86 mm Hg in the NRF patients. Similar maximum decreases and effects at 12 hours were seen after dose on day 29 as on day 1. Data on the effect on diastolic blood pressure and plasma felodipine concentrations were well fitted to the Emax model. The maximum reduction in diastolic blood pressure using this model was 27% and the plasma concentration leading to 50% of the maximum effect was 6.2 nmol/L. In conclusion, renal disease does not affect the pharmacokinetics of felodipine. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of felodipine are not altered during steady state. The renal excretion of inactive metabolites is reduced in IRF. However, the accumulation of metabolites in the blood does not affect the protein binding or the clearance of felodipine. No dosage adjustment of felodipine seems to be necessary in patients with hypertension and renal impairment.", 
    "27": "Whole-body lipolytic rates and the rate of triglyceride-fatty acid cycling (reesterification of fatty acids released during lipolysis) were measured with stable isotopic tracers in the basal state and during beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol infusion in five cachectic patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, five cachectic cancer-free, nutritionally-matched control patients, and 10 healthy volunteers. Resting energy expenditure and plasma catecholamines were normal in all three groups. The basal rate of glycerol appearance in blood in the patients with cancer (2.96 +/- 0.45 mumol.kg-1.min-1) was similar to that in the nutritionally matched controls (3.07 +/- 0.28 mumol.kg-1.min-1), but 48% greater than in the normal-weight volunteers (2.00 +/- 0.16 mumol.kg-1.min-1) (P = 0.028). The antilipolytic effect of propranolol and the rate of triglyceride-fatty acid cycling in the patients with cancer were also similar in the cachectic control group and approximately 50% greater than in the normal-weight volunteers, but the differences were not statistically significant because of the variability in the data. We conclude that the increase in lipolysis and triglyceride-fatty acid cycling in \"unstressed\" cachectic patients with esophageal cancer is due to alterations in their nutritional status rather than the presence of tumor itself. Increased beta-adrenergic activity may be an important contributor to the stimulation of lipolysis.", 
    "28": "The effect of phospholipase A2 (Naja naja) PLA2) on mean arterial blood pressure and intratracheal pressure was examined in anesthetized guinea pigs. Intracheally administered PLA2 (1 to 10 U) produced acute, dose-dependent increases in mean arterial blood pressure and intracheal pressure. However, Intravenously administered PLA2 (doses as large as 1,000 U) did not alter monitored variables. Acute PLA2-induced morphologic alterations were characterized by airway constriction, airway/alveolar cell damage, and pulmonary sequestration of both leukocytes and platelets. PLA2-induced increases in both mean arterial blood pressure and intratracheal pressure were attenuated to varying degrees by pretreating intravenously with indomethacin (10 mg/kg), a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, and WEB 2086 (0.1 mg/kg), a platelet-activating factor antagonist. Both ICI 198,615 (1 mg/kg), a leukotriene D4, receptor antagonist given intravenously, and dexamethasone (50 mg/kg), a steroidal anti-inflammatory agent given intraperitoneally as a 2-day pretreatment, reduced PLA2-induced increases in intratracheal pressure. Pyrilamine (2 mg/kg), a histamine1-receptor antagonist given intravenously, did not modify PLA2-induced pathophysiologic responses. Guinea pigs exposed to aerosolized PLA2 (100 U/ml) exhibited evidence of increased bronchoalveolar lavage macrophage, leukocyte, and lymphocyte accumulation at 24 h post-PLA2. These studies suggest that in vivo PLA2-induced pathophysiologic changes in the guinea pig involve alterations in resident airway cell populations as well as sequestration and infiltration of inflammatory cells. Both eicosanoids and platelet-activating factor appear to contribute to these PLA2-induced pathophysiologic effects.", 
    "29": "We determined the pulmonary obstructive response to aerosolized antigen challenge, and its sensitivity to antagonists of specific lipid mediators, in IgG, passively sensitized (IgG1-PS) guinea pigs. Antiovalbumin (OA)-IgG1 was isolated by affinity chromatography from serum derived from actively immunized Hartley guinea pigs. Propranolol and pyrilamine pretreated, IgG1-PS guinea pigs were challenged with aerosolized antigen and pulmonary obstruction was quantified by measurements of excised lung gas volume (ELGV). ELGV increased between 150 and 1,035% in a dose-proportional fashion with increasing antigen exposure (0.001 to 0.1% nebulizer concentration). The leukotriene antagonists ICI-204,219 and SKF-104,353 exhibited dose-proportional inhibitions in antigen-induced elevations in ELGV, inhibiting up to 65 and 87% at the maximal concentrations examined. Similarly, the platelet-activating factor (PAF) antagonists WEB-2086 and L-659,989 inhibited antigen-induced elevations in ELGV, inhibiting up to 94 and 59% at the maximal concentrations examined. In contrast, the cyclooxygenase (CO) inhibitor piroxicam significantly enhanced (p less than 0.05) the OA-induced elevations in ELGV. Aerosolized PAF challenge produced dose-proportional elevations in ELGV that were significantly inhibited by the LTD, antagonist ICI-204,219 (38 and 43% inhibition) and the CO inhibitor piroxicam (62 and 48% inhibition) in sensitized and nonsensitized animals, respectively. We hypothesize that IgG1-dependent airway obstruction is mediated in part by LTD, produced in response to PAF generation.", 
    "30": "This article describes a young women in whom orthostatic intolerance developed as a result of protracted postpartum vaginal bleeding. The cardiovascular abnormalities were unresponsive to usual treatment measures, and she required combination therapy directed at increasing plasma volume and decreasing sympathetic nervous system activity. After resolution of her symptoms, the patient required no long-term therapy. Chronic blood loss has not been reported as a cause of this syndrome.", 
    "31": "Two patients with complaints of hypoglycemia came for evaluation, and both complained of intermittent episodes of mental dullness, disorientation, confusion, and palpitations relieved by eating. Plasma glucose levels at the time of symptoms were always above 70 mg/dL. Initial onset of symptoms was within 1 to 2 years after cessation of repeated incest, and on recognition of this, both patients associated the onset of episodes of similar feelings with the acts of incest. Recognition of this connection did not decrease the frequency of episodes. Both persistently refer to the episodes as \"hypoglycemia\" despite recognition that no glucose level below 70 mg/dL has been recorded during an episode. Recurrent episodes of derealization and depersonalization in both patients appear to be sequelae of adolescent incest experiences, but these patients cling to the label \"hypoglycemia,\" perhaps in part because they are unwilling to accept a psychiatric diagnosis for their episodes.", 
    "32": "Unheparinized, ureter-ligated control dogs that are potassium loaded, i.e., infused with 2 mEq of KCl/kg until prelethal electrocardiographic changes of hyperkalemic cardiotoxicity appear (end point), transfer 57 +/- 4% (1.7 +/- 0.1 mEq/kg) of administered potassium to intracellular fluid. Heparinized controls transfer 73 +/- 1% (3.2 +/- 0.2 mEq/kg); with simultaneous alpha-adrenoreceptor blockade, that proportion increases to 81 +/- 2% (4.80 +/- 0.7 mEq/kg) and with simultaneous beta-receptor blockade it is 58 +/- 3% (1.1 +/- 0.1 mEq/kg). In potassium loaded, ureter-ligated dogs, heparin increases transmembrane potassium transfer as effectively as does a dosage of atropine large enough to cross the blood-brain barrier and its influence on potassium transfer, like that of atropine, is suppressed by beta-adrenoreceptor blockade.", 
    "33": "This study investigated the effect of intravenous cocaine (0.5 to 2 mg/kg body weight) on the coronary circulation and systemic hemodynamics in closed chest sedated dogs. The role of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor stimulation in mediating these effects was also investigated. Cocaine produced dose-dependent increases in mean arterial pressure and rate-pressure product. Although the lower doses of cocaine had no significant effect on the coronary circulation, the 2 mg/kg dose produced a 55 +/- 14% increase in coronary vascular resistance (p less than 0.05 versus baseline) and a 19 +/- 3% reduction in diameter of the left anterior descending coronary artery (p less than 0.05 versus baseline). Despite these potentially deleterious effects on the coronary circulation (occurring at a time of markedly increased myocardial oxygen demand), the electrocardiogram did not demonstrate ischemic changes and there was no myocardial lactate production. Cocaine-induced coronary vasoconstriction was abolished by pretreatment with the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine, but not by pretreatment with the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol. The findings that cocaine did not change systemic vascular resistance in dogs without adrenergic blockade, reduced systemic vascular resistance in dogs after alpha-blockade (p less than 0.05) and increased systemic vascular resistance in dogs after beta-blockade (p = 0.06) suggest that epinephrine (rather than norepinephrine) is primarily responsible for the peripheral vascular actions of cocaine. Thus, in this canine preparation with normal coronary arteries, cocaine produced vasoconstriction of both epicardial and coronary resistance vessels that was not associated with evidence of myocardial ischemia. The pharmacologic mechanism for the effect of cocaine on the coronary circulation is alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation, whereas systemic hemodynamic effects are mediated by combined alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor stimulation.", 
    "34": "Prostaglandins inhibit efferent cardiac sympathetic nerve effects by acting at presynaptic sites and may act to suppress some arrhythmias. In the present study, the effects of intravenous administration of prostacyclin (PGI2) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) on early afterdepolarizations and ventricular tachycardia induced by cesium chloride (0.5 mmol/liter per kg body weight intravenously) combined with stimulation of bilateral ansae subclaviae in anesthetized dogs were examined. The right atrium was paced at a constant cycle length of 600 ms. A left ventricular endocardial monophasic action potential catheter was used to detect early afterdepolarizations. Prostacyclin (0.2 microgram/kg per min) reduced the amplitude of the early afterdepolarizations (39.2 +/- 8.4% of the monophasic action potential amplitude during control study to 28.7 +/- 5.5%, n = 10; p less than 0.001) as well as the prevalence of ventricular tachycardia (11 of 14 dogs during control study to 5 of 14 dogs; p = 0.031). Prostaglandin E2 (0.2 to 0.6 microgram/kg per min) did not significantly reduce the early afterdepolarization amplitude (34.7 +/- 8.9% to 25.1 +/- 10.7%, n = 8; p = 0.085) or the prevalence of ventricular tachycardia (8 of 10 versus 6 of 10 dogs; p = 0.50). Alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockade with combined intravenous administration of propranolol (0.5 mg/kg) and phentolamine (0.3 mg/kg) decreased the amplitude of the early afterdepolarizations induced by cesium chloride and bilateral ansae subclaviae stimulation from 38.6 +/- 11.2% to 18.8 +/- 3.3% (n = 6; p = 0.005). Additional administration of PGI2 further reduced the early afterdepolarization amplitude from 18.8 +/- 3.3% to 9.8 +/- 4.8% (n = 6; p = 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "35": "Plasma homocyst(e)ine (that is, the sum of free and bound homocysteine and its oxidized forms, homocystine and homocysteine-cysteine mixed disulfide) levels were determined in 170 men (mean age +/- SD 50 +/- 7 years) with premature coronary artery disease diagnosed at coronary angiography and in 255 control subjects clinically free of coronary artery disease (mean age 49 +/- 6 years). Patients with coronary artery disease had a higher homocyst(e)ine level than control subjects (13.66 +/- 6.44 versus 10.93 +/- 4.92 nmol/ml, p less than 0.001). High density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels were lower (32 +/- 10 versus 46 +/- 13 mg/dl, p less than 0.001) and triglycerides levels were higher (193 +/- 103 versus 136 +/- 106 mg/dl, p less than 0.001) in the coronary disease group. Plasma total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels were not significantly different between patients with coronary disease and control subjects. The presence of hypertension, smoking or diabetes mellitus did not significantly alter homocyst(e)ine levels in the patient or the control group. Patients who were not taking a beta-adrenergic blocking drug (n = 70) had a nonsignificantly higher homocyst(e)ine level than did patients taking this class of drugs (n = 100) (14.67 +/- 8.92 versus 12.95 +/- 3.77 nmol/ml, p = 0.087). By design, none of the control subjects were taking a beta-blocker. No significant correlations were observed between homocyst(e)ine and age, serum cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol or triglyceride levels. It is concluded that an elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine level is an independent risk factor for the development of premature coronary atherosclerosis in men.", 
    "36": "Marfan syndrome is a hereditable disorder of connective tissue that causes several distinct cardiovascular abnormalities, including aortic regurgitation, dissection, and aneurysm. These cardiac manifestations can be identified with echocardiography, computer tomography, and angiography. Standard treatment of an acute hypertensive crisis in Marfan syndrome uses propranolol and sodium nitroprusside. This patient with Marfan syndrome whose case is reported herein presented with chest pain, hypertensive crisis, and aortic insufficiency; labetalol was used successfully to treat the acute hypertensive crisis and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to differentiate between aortic dissection and an expanding aortic aneurysm. This report is unique in that labetalol was used to control the hypertensive crisis in Marfan syndrome and MRI was used as the initial diagnostic modality in an emergency setting.", 
    "37": "Labetalol pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were evaluated in nine subjects before and during enzyme inhibition with cimetidine. Pharmacologic response was assessed by use of standardized treadmill tests during 24 hours after administration of oral labetalol. Oral clearance of labetalol decreased with cimetidine administration (58.7 +/- 23.3 to 32.9 +/- 13.2 ml/min/kg; p less than 0.05), thereby causing a 79% increase in area under the curve. Labetalol systemic clearance also decreased (23.2 +/- 5.3 to 17.7 +/- 3.7 ml/min/kg; p less than 0.05), but the volume of distribution was unchanged. Labetalol caused significant beta-blockade for 8 hours after the last oral dose, but cimetidine did not alter pharmacologic response. The Emax model provided a good description of the concentration-effect relationship. At peak labetalol concentrations after oral administration, (R,R)-labetalol concentrations were significantly lower than those of the other three stereoisomers (p less than 0.05). Cimetidine caused an increase in the concentrations of each stereoisomer, but the difference was significant (p less than 0.05) for only the (S,R)-, (S,S)-, and (R,S)-isomers. This first evidence of labetalol stereoselective disposition is consistent with the findings of previous (R,R)-labetalol pharmacokinetic studies and with previous pharmacodynamic investigations of labetalol and (R,R)-labetalol.", 
    "38": "Topical application of the serotonin2 agonist, 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane or DOI, in a dose of 30 micrograms/side to the intermediate area of the ventrolateral surface of the medulla produced a significant increase in mean arterial pressure with no significant change in heart rate both in intact animals (n = 8) and in cervically vagotomized animals (n = 3). The pressor response of DOI was blocked by pretreatment of the intermediate area with ketanserin, a serotonin2 antagonist (n = 7). Pretreatment with intravenous phentolamine did not block the pressor response of DOI (n = 3). However, this pressor response could be counteracted by intravenous propranolol (n = 5) or by bilateral stellate ganglionectomy (n = 3). These data suggest that sympathoexcitation by centrally applied DOI selectively increased cardiac inotropy but not chronotropy. Further studies indicate that DOI increased contractile force without increasing heart rate and that the positive inotropic effect of DOI could be counteracted by bilateral stellate ganglionectomy. Bilateral microinjections of DOI into the subretrofacial nucleus in a dose of 100 ng (n = 3) and a dose of 300 ng (n = 3) increased mean arterial blood pressure by 23 +/- 2 and 44 +/- 6 mm Hg, respectively, without producing any changes in heart rate. These data suggest that DOI has a central site of action in the ventrolateral medulla, presumably at the subretrofacial nucleus, which leads to selective sympathoexcitation of the cardiac ventricles.", 
    "39": "Oral timolol taken for the treatment of systemic hypertension has been shown to affect adversely serum lipoprotein levels. In a 15-week study on 19 patients topical timolol therapy for raised intraocular pressure was found to have no significant adverse effect on serum lipoprotein levels. This is reassuring in view of the large number of patients on this form of long term therapy, and selection of the type of beta blocker to use should not be influenced by lipid changes associated with the oral form of the drug.", 
    "40": "This study examined heart rate (HR) variability in patients surviving acute myocardial infarction (AMI) to find the optimum time and duration of recording of the ambulatory electrocardiogram for the prediction of the risk of sudden cardiac death, or serious arrhythmic events, or both. Twenty patients (group I) who initially survived an AMI but later experienced serious events (death or symptomatic sustained ventricular tachycardia) during a 6-month follow-up were compared with 20 patients (group II) who remained free of complications for greater than 6 months after discharge. Groups I and II were matched with regard to age, gender, infarct site, ejection fraction, and beta-blocker treatment. HR variability was assessed in the 24-hour electrocardiograms recorded during the first 2 weeks after an AMI and in various portions of the complete 24-hour recording, with both the beginning and the length of the analyzed portion varied by 20 minutes (a total of 5,113 possibilities). The maximum reduction of HR variability in group I patients was systematically found when assessing HR variability in recordings starting approximately at 6 A.M. and lasting for approximately 8 hours. In the low-risk patient, the diurnal rhythm of HR variability is more marked than in the high-risk patient and the long-term components of HR variability due to the diurnal variation must be included in the measurement of HR variability when using it as a long-term predictor of risk from arrhythmic events after an AMI.", 
    "41": "In a double-blind randomized trial, the hemodynamic events following the administration of propranolol (n = 51) or a placebo (n = 51) were prospectively studied in cirrhotic patients with esophageal varices. The hepatic venous pressure gradient, heart rate, and variceal size were determined at the baseline and 3, 12, and 24 months after the beginning of therapy. Baseline values were similar in both groups. At 3 months, the hepatic venous pressure gradient decreased significantly in propranolol-treated patients (from 18.1 +/- 4.2 to 15.7 +/- 3.4 mm Hg; P less than 0.05) but not in patients receiving the placebo (19.6 +/- 6.8 to 17.5 +/- 5.3 mm Hg; NS). At subsequent time intervals this gradient decreased significantly from the baseline value in both groups. Heart rate decreased significantly in the propranolol-treated group at all times (P less than 0.001). Variceal hemorrhage occurred in 13 patients (11 placebo-, 2 propranolol-treated; P less than 0.01), all of whom had a hepatic venous pressure gradient greater than 12 mm Hg. In 21 patients (14 propranolol-, 7 placebo-treated) the hepatic venous pressure gradient decreased to less than or equal to 12 mm Hg; none of them bled from esophageal varices, and their mortality rate also decreased. Because most of the bleeding events occurred during the first year (10 placebo-, 1 propranolol-treated; P less than 0.01), propranolol seems to have its protective effect during the period associated with the largest reduction in the hepatic venous pressure gradient. Because a reduction in the hepatic venous pressure gradient to less than 12 mm Hg protects from variceal bleeding and increases the rate of survival, this should be the aim of the pharmacological therapy of portal hypertension.", 
    "42": "Using standard microelectrode techniques, the authors compared the effects of 15 to 125 microM concentrations of mexiletine, 31 to 500 microM concentrations of sotalol and 15 to 125 microM of mexiletine combined with 125 microM sotalol, on the beat-to-beat action potential duration and refractoriness of porcine papillary muscles and Purkinje fibres stimulated by 30 beat trains at a frequency of 1 Hz. Sotalol alone prolonged action potential duration and effective refractory period without altering their ratio. Mexiletine shortened action potential duration while prolonging refractoriness. When the two drugs were combined, action potential duration was shortened to the same extent as with mexiletine alone, but refractoriness, particularly in papillary muscle, was further prolonged. These changes suggest additive inhibition of the sodium window current by both drugs. Purkinje action potential duration was longest in the first beat of the train, while in papillary muscle, this beat was shortest. Exposure to either or both drugs eliminated the prolongation of duration of the first beat of the train in Purkinje fibre. Thus, the phenomenon of restitution, which prolongs the duration of the first beat after a long diastolic interval, appears also to be related to the sodium window current.", 
    "43": "Using standard microelectrode techniques, the authors compared the effects of 15 to 125 microM concentrations of mexiletine, 31 to 500 microM concentrations of sotalol and 15 to 125 microM of mexiletine combined with 125 microM sotalol, on the beat-to-beat maximum rate of depolarization of phase 0 of the action potential (Vmax) of porcine papillary muscles and Purkinje fibres stimulated by 30 beat trains at a frequency of 1 Hz. Sotalol alone had no effect on Vmax. Mexiletine caused both tonic and use-dependent depression of Vmax in papillary muscle. In the presence of sotalol, tonic Vmax depression was exaggerated, while use-dependent depression was attenuated. In Purkinje fibres, mexiletine exposure resulted in tonic Vmax depression, but no use-dependence could be demonstrated at this frequency. These results are best explained in the context of the modulated receptor hypothesis with the added consideration of two receptors--one within and one external to the sodium channel.", 
    "44": "We determined beta-adrenoceptor concentrations in sympathetic ganglia from adult Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) control rats by quantitative autoradiography. Adjacent tissue sections were incubated with [125I]iodocyanopindolol, with or without excess of unlabeled (-)-propranolol, the beta 1-antagonist CGP 20712A or the beta 2-antagonist ICI 118,551. Most beta-adrenoceptors were of the beta 2-type. Their concentration was higher in the superior cervical and stellate ganglia of SHR when compared to normotensive WKY. Our results indicate that beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation may be enhanced in sympathetic ganglia of SHR, and could play a role in the maintenance of their increased sympathetic activity.", 
    "45": "The pharmacological and gene expressions of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor subtypes (BAR1 and BAR2) were investigated in human liver by radioligand binding assays, adenylate cyclase experiments, and RNA excess solution hybridization. [125I]Cyanopinodolol, nonlabeled adrenergic agents, and BAR1/BAR2 cRNA were used as probes. The relationship between binding sites for BAR1 and BAR2 was markedly different from that between the basal mRNA expression for the two receptor subtypes. Plasma membranes as well as a microsomel-enriched fraction contained binding sites only for BAR2. The potency of BAR agonists and antagonists in stimulating adenylate cyclase activity of plasma membranes was typical of a BAR2 response. Northern blot analysis of total cellular RNA isolated from liver tissue showed hybridization of the BAR1 probe to a mRNA species of 2.5-2.6 kilobases and of the BAR2 probe to a mRNA species of 2.2-2.3 kilobases. The basal level of BAR1 mRNA was 5-fold higher than of BAR2 mRNA, as assayed by solution hybridization. No difference in BAR subtype mRNA stability was observed, as indicated by a mRNA half-life of approximately 5.5 h for both receptor subtypes. It is concluded that specific factors are involved in the steady state regulation of BAR subtype expression in human liver. This tissue contains solely BAR2 owing to a posttranscriptional block of basal BAR1 expression.", 
    "46": "The pathogenesis of the myopathy occurring in the heart of the cardiomyopathic strain of the Syrian hamster is not well understood but is believed to be associated with abnormal calcium handling by myopathic cells. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the cardiomyopathy occurring in strain BIO 14.6 animals is associated with an enhanced alpha 1-adrenergic receptor-mediated rise in cytosolic calcium, whether a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein is involved in coupling the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor to changes in intracellular calcium and whether enhanced alpha 1 responsiveness is associated with an increase in the level of expression of the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor or in the pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein or proteins. To test the hypothesis that the cardiomyopathic state is associated with a greater alpha 1-receptor-mediated rise in cytosolic calcium, we studied the effect of phenylephrine (in the presence of propranolol) on time-averaged cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in isolated cardiac myocytes from cardiomyopathic and age-matched control hamsters. Phenylephrine caused a greater increase both in time-averaged [Ca2+]i (an increase of 48 +/- 8% versus 12 +/- 3%, p less than 0.01) and in contractility (+181 +/- 22% versus +35 +/- 9%, p less than 0.01) in cardiomyopathic than in normal cardiac myocytes. Exposure to pertussis toxin (200 ng/ml for 3 hours) attenuated the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor-mediated increase in contractility and time-averaged [Ca2+]i in both cardiomyopathic and normal cells. The level of pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein, as determined by pertussis toxin-mediated [32P]ADP-ribosylation, was 1.6-fold higher in cardiomyopathic versus normal hamster hearts. The density of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, as measured by the antagonist radioligand [3H]prazosin and the affinity of the receptor for agonist and antagonist were similar in myopathic and normal heart membranes. Thus, in cardiac myocytes from hamsters, the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor-mediated effects on [Ca2+]i and contractility appear to be mediated by a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein or proteins. In myocytes from cardiomyopathic hamsters, these alpha 1-adrenergic effects were increased in magnitude, as was the level of pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein, but there was no measurable alteration in the density or ligand binding properties of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "47": "This study evaluated the effect of long-term antihypertensive therapy with indenolol, a beta blocking agent with beta 2 stimulating activity, its antihypertensive hemodynamic mechanism and its effect on hypertensive left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy. Fourteen hypertensive patients, mean age of 48 years, were serially studied during 12- month therapy with indenolol (60-120 mg daily), by recording blood pressure, electrocardiogram and echocardiogram. Blood pressure, heart rate and cardiac output significantly decreased after 1 months of therapy, LV posterior wall thickness decreased after 6 months, interventricular septum thickness and LV mass decreased after 12 months. LV fractional shortening did not change throughout the study. Blood pressure normalized (less than or equal to 140/90 mmHg) in 50% of the patients; LV mass normalized in 40% of the patients. In conclusion, indenolol was an effective antihypertensive agent, also in the long-term treatment. Its antihypertensive hemodynamic effect seems to be due mainly to a reduction in cardiac output. Indenolol caused a regression of LV hypertensive hypertrophy without impairment of LV systolic function.", 
    "48": "Changes in plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and albumin, and blood hematocrit (Hct) during treadmill exercise were studied in 6 healthy men before and after beta-adrenergic blockade. Plasma ANP levels increased during exercise and then gradually decreased. There was a concomitant increase in both Hct and plasma albumin concentrations. Prior administration of a long-acting propranolol, 160 mg daily for 3 consecutive days, markedly elevated plasma ANP levels before, during and after exercise. In addition, the mean basal Hct increased significantly and further rose during exercise after propranolol administration. When increments in plasma ANP concentrations during exercise in individual subjects were compared with those in Hct, there was a significant positive correlation between the two variables before and after propranolol administration. The results indicate a close relationship between the changes in plasma ANP and those in Hct during exercise at different ANP levels, and suggest that ANP may be at least one of the factors involved in the hemoconcentration associated with exercise.", 
    "49": "Guan-fu base A (GFA) is a new alkaloid isolated from the tuber of Aconitum coreanum in our institute. Its effects on spontaneous electrical discharge rate of intact sinoatrial node preparations were investigated. Unipolar Ag-AgCl2 electrodes and DC-amplification were used to record unipolar electrograms from the endocardial surface of the isolated right guinea pig atria. GFA (4.29-214.5 micrograms/ml) decreased the spontaneous electrical discharge rate of sinoatrial node in a dose-dependent manner. The most effective concentration (214.5 micrograms/ml) of GFA resulted in sinus rate of 115 +/- 8 bpm (n = 7, control rate 208 +/- 13 bpm) within 30 min. Low external Ca2+ (0.18 mmol/L) enhanced the rate in lowering effect of GFA, in contrast with high external K+ (10.8 mmol/L) diminishing the effect of GFA. The ratios of IC30 of negative inotropic effects over IC30 of negative chronotropic effects were 9.38 for GFA and 1.73 for verapamil. GFA antagonized the positive chronotropic effect of isoproperenol but did not antagonize the positive inotropic effect of isoproterenol. The consequence of lowering sinus rate by GFA was not interfered by propranolol (0.15 micrograms/ml) or atropine (0.05 micrograms/ml). These results suggest that the bradycardia by GFA is a direct effect on sinoatrial node, but not due to the calcium channel block or beta adrenoceptor block.", 
    "50": "The influence of propranolol on cerebral blood flow (CBF) was tested in streptozotocin diabetic rats and in control animals. Resting CBF values were 40% lower in the diabetic rats compared with controls. Intravenous injection of propranolol (2 mg kg-1) decreased CBF significantly in the control group; the CBF decreased for 15 min after propranolol injection and returned to baseline values after 90 min. In the diabetic rats, the CBF declined steadily but this decrease did not reach significance, even after 90 min. Impaired beta-adrenergic mechanisms may be an important factor in the CBF alterations which occur in diabetes mellitus. Further, it is suggested that an impaired CBF response may play a role in CNS lesions in diabetic patients treated with beta antagonists.", 
    "51": "1. The discharge of single afferent chemoreceptor fibres was recorded from the cut sinus nerve over periods of 60 or 90 min of constant, isocapnic hypoxia (arterial O2 pressure, Pa,O2, 3.13-5.25 kPa), in twenty anaesthetized rabbits, after dividing the sympathetic supply to the carotid body. 2. Under control conditions, discharge after 60 min of hypoxia adapted to a mean (S.E.M.) of 71.95 (2.75)% of that attained at 5 min of hypoxia in twenty-three hypoxic experiments. This adaptation was more pronounced when Pa,O2 was lower than 4 kPa (30 Torr). 3. Domperidone (1 mg kg-1 bolus + 1 mg kg-1 h-1 infusion I.V.), increased normoxic afferent discharge by a mean of 142%. In ten experiments, discharge after 60 min of hypoxia adapted to a mean (S.E.M.) of 56.22 (+/- 3.40)% of that attained at 5 min of hypoxia which was significantly different from control hypoxic runs (P = 0.006). 4. In seven experiments propranolol (1 mg kg-1 bolus + 1 mg kg-1 h-1 infusion I.V.) did not affect the normoxic discharge. The mean adaptation of discharge after 60 min of hypoxia was to 77.43 (3.97)% of discharge attained at 5 min of hypoxia, which was not significantly different from control hypoxic runs (P = 0.34). 5. Under control conditions plasma [K+] increased steadily during 60 min of hypoxia, in fourteen experiments, from a mean of 2.76 (0.14) to 2.85 (0.12) mmol l-1 but this was not significant (P = 0.21). Domperidone (n = 6) did not affect plasma [K+] at any time, but after propranolol (n = 6) it increased by a mean (S.E.M.) of 0.39 (0.09) mmol l-1 (P = 0.01) in normoxia and by a further 0.62 (0.28) mmol l-1 (P = 0.08) at 60 min of hypoxia. 6. The results suggest that the adaptation of chemoreceptor discharge to hypoxia in the rabbit is not mediated by changes in plasma [K+]; in addition, endogenous dopamine, but not noradrenaline, contributes to the maintenance of chemoreceptor discharge in prolonged hypoxia.", 
    "52": "1. The potential interaction between selective beta 1-adrenoceptor blockers and sulphonylureas or biguanides was studied by comparing the beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist betaxolol with placebo in 12 normal subjects taking glibenclamide or metformin in a single-blind crossover group study. 2. After a 4 day run-in period on no treatment, six subjects took glibenclamide 2.5 mg twice daily, and six subjects took metformin 850 mg twice daily from day 5 to day 19. All subjects took betaxolol 20 mg daily from day 10 to day 13, and placebo from day 5 to day 10 and from day 13 to day 19. 3. Plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were measured fasting and 60 min after a standard breakfast for 3 successive days during each study treatment; plasma potassium, sodium and betaxolol concentrations were also measured. 4. Fasting glucose, insulin and potassium concentrations did not differ significantly between betaxolol and placebo treatment periods in either glibenclamide- or metformin-treated groups. Post-prandial glucose and insulin concentrations were lower and higher, respectively, relative to fasting concentrations but there was no significant difference between any of the treatment periods. Glibenclamide produced significant increases in insulin concentrations compared with drug-free periods (P less than 0.01). Plasma potassium and sodium concentrations were not affected by any of the treatments. 5. Plasma betaxolol concentrations were adequate for beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade. 6. This study suggests that selective beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade with betaxolol does not change fasting or post-prandial glucose-insulin relationships during simultaneous treatment with either the sulphonylurea glibenclamide or the biguanide metformin.", 
    "53": "The Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) has led to serious reconsideration of both the benefit-risk ratio of antiarrhythmic drug therapy and the appropriate therapeutic approach to various cardiac arrhythmias. Class IC drugs, such as encainide and flecainide, should not be used to treat asymptomatic postinfarction arrhythmias. Furthermore, because the CAST raises serious questions about the concept of treating asymptomatic but \"potentially malignant\" (prognostically important) arrhythmias guided by ambulatory monitoring, the prophylactic use of any of the antiarrhythmic agents (except beta blockers) must be considered inappropriate and potentially harmful until otherwise established by specific clinical trials. For prophylaxis of malignant ventricular arrhythmias (sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation), treatment may still begin with standard agents in classes IA, IB, or both, preferably guided by electrophysiologic testing alone or in combination with noninvasive testing. Class IC therapy may be most useful in those patients in this group who do not have such high-risk characteristics for proarrhythmia as a history of multiple myocardial infarctions (MIs), congestive heart failure, or low ejection fraction. Amiodarone is moderately effective for treating these arrhythmias but is reserved as second- or third-line therapy because of its potential organ toxicity. Sotalol, a beta blocker with class III activity, is often effective and relatively well tolerated in these patients and may become a preferred drug when approved. For symptomatic but nonmalignant ventricular arrhythmias, a more conservative approach is more appropriate than in the past, with therapy reversed for those with debilitating symptoms. An initial trial of beta blockade is often appropriate before class I agents are considered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "54": "42 mild and moderate hypertensive patients treated with Verapamil, Atenolol and Xipamide were studied. Exercise tests (ET) were performed at the onset and after a month of therapy, in order to detect arrhythmias and repolarization change prevalence of ventricular arrhythmias (VA) was 23.7% and 11.9% for supraventricular arrhythmias (SVA). 45.2% of the exercise tests were considered positive, with a significant correlation with maximum pressure peak. Patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) showed a significant increase in VA and +ET prevalence (42.1% and 63.2%). After treatment, the prevalence for VA registered a slight decrease and an increase for SVA; these differences not being considered significant. +ET showed a significant decrease in all patients, as well as in those with previous LVH (21.4%, 26.3%). Only atenolol produced a significant decrease in the +ET of patients with previous LVH (75% to 12.5%).", 
    "55": "The clinical and haemodynamic effects of oral metoprolol therapy were assessed in thirty patients of dilated cardiomyopathy, aged 14-58 (33 +/- 10.9) years. After baseline haemodynamic study, metoprolol was administered in a dose of 25-100 mg/day (mean 87.0 +/- 25.1 mg/day). Before start of therapy, 13 patients were in NYHA symptom class IV, 14 were in NYHA class III and 3 were in NYHA class II. Symptomatic improvement was seen on oral metoprolol therapy in all patients except one. Six months after therapy 13 patients were asymptomatic, 16 were in NYHA class II, while 1 patient continued to be in NYHA class III. Repeat haemodynamic study in 15 patients done at a mean of 5.7 months showed a significant fall in the right ventricular end diastolic pressure (from 9.1 +/- 4.4 to 5.7 +/- 2.9 mm Hg, p less than 0.01), mean pulmonary artery pressure (from 32.3 +/- 13 to 24.5 +/- 10.3 mmHg, P less than 0.01) and mean pulmonary capillary pressure (from 23.3 +/- 10.3 mmHg to 14.7 +/- 7.4 mmHg, P less than 0.01). The left ventricular ejection fraction increased from 18.8 +/- 6.3 to 24.0 +/- 7.3 per cent, (P less than 0.05), while no significant change was observed in the cardiac index (2.43 +/- 0.47 to 2.66 +/- 0.83 L/min/m2, p = NS). These data suggest improvement in diastolic and systolic left ventricular function after metoprolol therapy.", 
    "56": "The effects of quinidine on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of propranolol were investigated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Healthy subjects of group A (n = 5) and group B (n = 11) were given oral propranolol (dose: group A 10 mg, group B 20 mg) with placebo or propranolol with quinidine (dose: group A 100 mg, group B 200 mg) on separate occasions. Quinidine induced a significant rise in the plasma concentrations of propranolol, and the area under the propranolol concentration-time curves (AUC) was also increased about 3-fold in both groups, indicative of an alteration of propranolol pharmacokinetics. In order to estimate the pharmacodynamic action of the pharmacokinetic interaction, the change in the heart rate during treadmill exercise testing was studied in group A. A significant inhibition of exercise-induced tachycardia was observed after administration of propranolol alone, but in combination with quinidine an even greater suppression was evident. These results indicate that the coadministration of propranolol and quinidine provides not only the potentiation of quinidine action by propranolol, which has been reported, but also the enhancement of propranolol action by quinidine, due to an increased plasma concentration of propranolol.", 
    "57": "The effects of famotidine (Gaster; CAS 76824-35-6) and cimetidine on cardiovascular and bronchial functions were investigated in anesthetized dogs. Famotidine did not affect heart rate, blood pressure, left ventricular pressure (LVP), max. dLVP/dt, cardiac output or coronary blood flow at i.v. doses of 1 to 30 mg/kg in open-chest dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital or a combination of nitrous oxide, oxygen and halothane (GOF). No hemodynamic changes were either observed after famotidine in pentobarbital anesthetized dogs whose cardiac function was depressed by propranolol (1 mg/kg i.v.). On the contrary, cimetidine dose-dependently decreased heart rate and blood pressure at doses greater than 3 mg/kg, and left ventricular pressure, cardiac output and coronary blood flow at the dose of 30 mg/kg. Regarding the electrocardiogram (ECG), famotidine did not produce any remarkable change at doses up to 30 mg/kg with the exception of a transient increase or decrease in the T-wave amplitude at a dose of 30 mg/kg. Cimetidine prolonged Q-T intervals of ECG in addition to changing the T-wave at a dose of 30 mg/kg. Neither famotidine nor cimetidine showed any effect on resting and histamine-increased bronchoresistance at doses up to 30 mg/kg. It is concluded that famotidine is superior to cimetidine with regard to safety because famotidine has no significant effects on cardiovascular functions in anesthetized dogs.",

The subjects did not change their habitual level of physical activity between the two test occasions. Maximal voluntary isokinetic knee extensor muscle strength was determined during various concentric, eccentric and isometric conditions. Average increases in strength from before to termination of treatment ranged from 25 to 41% for the concentric and isometric tests (P less than 0.01, n = 10), and from 19 to 35% for the eccentric tests (P less than 0.01, n = 6). The present study demonstrates that medical treatment of hyperthyroid patients results in a marked increase in muscle strength.", 
    "59": "We developed a simple new endotoxin-specific assay method that uses Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) containing a sufficient amount of a water-soluble (1----3)-beta-D-glucan derivative as a blocker of the (1----3)-beta-D-glucan-mediated coagulation pathway. The addition of 0.1 mg/ml or more of carboxymethylated (1----3)-beta-D-glucan completely blocked the activation of LAL by (1----3)-beta-D-glucan itself. The assay of endotoxin was unaffected by the presence of 1 mg/ml carboxymethylated (1----3)-beta-D-glucan. Spiked endotoxin was recovered well from beta-glucans by the turbidimetric kinetic method with LAL containing 1 mg/ml of carboxymethylated (1----3)-beta-D-glucan. Besides, this new LAL formulation was applied for an endotoxin-specific assay by the conventional gel-clot method or the chromogenic method. Gram-negative bacteria were specifically detected by the turbidimetric kinetic method with the LAL formulation. This LAL formulation may be used for an endotoxin-specific assay not only in pharmacology but also in clinical microbiology.", 
    "60": "The effect of chronic administration of propranolol on the rat brain and heart acetylcholinesterase was studied by administering propranolol (5mg/kg body weight) for 14 days. This treatment was found to substantially inhibit the enzyme activity. Levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine were measured in the brain and heart; in brain the levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine increased with propranolol administration, while in the heart there was no change. Effect of different concentrations of propranolol on acetylcholinesterase activity was also studied in vitro and a decreased activity of the enzyme was found in brain and heart homogenates. The significance of these results is discussed in terms of the therapeautic effects of the drug in the control of hypertension.", 
    "61": "The relative role of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonism in the management of anxiety symptoms is not clear. We studied the effect of ICI 118,551, a selective beta 2-antagonist, in 51 patients presenting with acute anxiety symptoms and fulfilling DSM-III criteria for anxiety disorder. All patients received placebo during the first week of treatment followed by thrice daily diazepam (2 mg) or ICI 118,551 (50 mg) or placebo for 4 weeks with double-blind, random allocation. Hamilton anxiety scale scores improved on all treatments but there was no significant difference between treatments. Beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonism does not appear to be effective in acute anxiety neurosis. Some earlier literature suggests that beta 1-antagonism may be more important.", 
    "62": "The basic relationship between the chemical structure and pharmacological activities of new alkylesters of 4-[(2-hydroxy-3-alkylamino)propoxy]phenylcarbamic acids were evaluated. The efficiency of compounds was compared with those of metipranolol and practolol, respectively. The majority of 4-substituted derivatives of aryloxypropanolamines have shown antiisoprenaline (beta-adrenolytic) and local anesthetic (membrane stabilizing) activities. The values of LD50 and/or partition coefficients have not differed significantly when compared with those of standard metipranolol.", 
    "63": "The inhibitory effects of 5-HT on the response of the rat isolated rat vas deferens preparation to electrical stimulation (0.1 Hz) has been investigated. A number of compounds, previously shown to possess antagonist activity at the rat central nervous system 5-HT autoreceptor, including methiothepin and the beta-blockers propranolol, alprenolol and cyanopindolol, have been found to possess virtually identical activity in the rat vas deferens. Cyanopindolol (Ke versus 5-HT = 4.9 nM) was the most potent antagonist tested, but was even more effective as a beta 2-antagonist (Ke = 0.14 nM) in this preparation. Prizidilol (Ke versus 5-HT = 30.2 nM, Ke versus isoprenaline = 75 nM) and acebutolol (Ke versus 5-HT = 297 nM, Ke versus isoprenaline = 3300 nM) have been identified as beta-blocking compounds that possess higher activity at the 5-HT receptor than at the beta 2-receptor. Several compounds, previously shown to possess 5-HT agonist activity, have been tested in this preparation and their potencies relative to 5-HT were as follows: 5-carboxyamidotryptamine (x 7), TFMPP (x 0.1) and LSD (x 0.04). RU24969 was found to behave as a low intrinsic activity partial agonist. All the evidence is consistent with the inhibitory 5-HT receptor present in this preparation being identical to the 5-HT autoreceptor found in the rat central nervous system which has been identified as the receptor with which the 5-HT1B binding site is associated.", 
    "64": "The mechanisms responsible for the positive inotropic, positive chronotropic and vasoconstrictor responses to dopamine in isolated guinea-pig cardiovascular tissues have been investigated in the present study. Since dopamine is the immediate precursor of noradrenaline, the role of noradrenaline in the pharmacological responses after addition of dopamine has been assessed. In isolated, contracting right ventricular papillary muscles, dopamine-induced positive inotropy (-log EC50, 4.77 +/- 0.06) was unaltered by incubation with dopamine antagonists (SCH 23390, domperidone), alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists (prazosin, yohimbine), or an inhibitor of uptake1 (cocaine). Practolol (selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist) and ICI 118,551 (selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist) were noncompetitive antagonists to dopamine. Block of vesicular uptake by reserpine antagonized the positive inotropic responses to dopamine (-log EC50, 4.03 +/- 0.05) but not to noradrenaline; these responses were antagonized by both practolol and ICI 118,551. Chemical sympathectomy by 6-hydroxydopamine antagonized the responses to dopamine (-log EC50, 3.76 +/- 0.11) but potentiated the responses to noradrenaline (-log EC50, 7.35 +/- 0.07). Inhibition of monoamine oxidase with pargyline potentiated the responses to dopamine (-log EC50, 6.05 +/- 0.04) and noradrenaline; the potentiation of dopamine responses was unaffected by chemical sympathectomy. Inhibition of dopamine beta-hydroxylase with sodium diethyldithiocarbamate antagonized the inotropic responses to dopamine (-log EC50, 4.36 +/- 0.05) but not to noradrenaline. Similar results were obtained in guinea-pig left atria (positive inotropy) and right atria (positive chronotropy), except that chemical sympathectomy failed to affect the chronotropic responses. In thoracic aortic rings, dopamine contracted vascular smooth muscle by direct partial agonism of alpha 1-adrenoceptors, without involvement of dopamine beta-hydroxylase. Thus, there is antagonism of the cardiac, but not the vascular responses to dopamine by inhibition of dopamine beta-hydroxylase. This shows that the conversion of dopamine to noradrenaline is important in the inotropic and chronotropic responses, but not the vascular responses to dopamine.", 
    "65": "The authors studied 67 patients with ischemic heart disease associated with hypertensive disease and revealed that the use of beta-adrenoblockaders and calcium antagonists resulted in a reduction of the manifestations of the disease, increase of physical load tolerance, optimization of its hemodynamic and oxygen provision. In patients under 60 years of age of beta-adrenoblockaders resulted in an increase of the myocardial contractility. This was not observed in those over 60 years of age. It is concluded that in patients combining IHD with hypertensive disease under 60 it is more preferable to use beta-adrenoblockers, in those over 60--calcium antagonists.", 
    "66": "This study was designed to investigate the haemodynamic effects of d-sotalol at plasma concentrations producing class III antiarrhythmic effects. d-Sotalol 1, 4 and 10 mg/kg intravenously was given after beta-blockade (propranolol 0.25 mg/kg intravenously) to seven pentobarbital anaesthetized dogs. Left ventricular (LV) systolic and end-diastolic pressures, LV dP/dtmax, mean aortic pressure, stroke volume, cardiac output and total peripheral resistance were not significantly changed by d-sotalol. There was a linear correlation between the dose of d-sotalol infused and the plasma concentration of d-sotalol obtained. Heart rate decreased and QT-time increased with increasing plasma concentrations of d-sotalol, whereas the QRS-width did not change. There was a linear correlation between the decrease in heart rate and the increase in QT-time, and between the plasma concentration of d-sotalol and increase in QT-time. In conclusion, the study indicates that after beta-blockade, d-sotalol has no cardiodepressive effects at concentrations that prolong repolarization.", 
    "67": "Within the framework of the study of the structure-effect relationship, a series of novel potential beta-adrenolytic agents derived from p-hydroxyacetophenone and p-hydroxypropiophenone with an alyloxymethyl and a cycloalkyloxymethyl group in the lipophilic part of the molecule and an isopropyl and a tert-butyl group in the hydrophilic part on the basic nitrogen were prepared by means of a well-tried method. The structure of the prepared drugs was confirmed on the basis of interpretation of the IR, UV, 1H-NMR and mass spectra. The results of pharmacological evaluation of selected drugs show that the agents poses beta-adrenolytic and antiarrhythmic activity. From the viewpoint of comparison of the individual drugs subjected to testing the presence of an alyl seems more advantageous than that of a cyclohexyl. The characteristic of the prepared drugs was supplemented by the determination of their partition coefficients, surface tension and acute toxicity.", 
    "68": "Transmural stimulation of non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic sensory nerves in guinea-pig atria, isolated from reserpine-pretreated animals, in the presence of atropine and the beta-adrenoceptor-blocking drug CGP 20712A, induced a positive inotropic effect. Adenosine (0.1-10 microM) concentration-dependently reduced the cardiac response to transmural nerve stimulation, without modifying the response to exogenous calcitonin gene-related peptide; the inhibitory effect of adenosine was antagonized by 1 microM 8-phenyltheophylline. Moreover, the cardiac response to field stimulation was enhanced by 8-phenyltheophylline (0.1, 1 microM) and by adenosine deaminase (1 microgram/ml), but was reduced by dipyridamole (1 microM). These findings indicate the presence of inhibitory adenosine receptors on cardiac sensory nerves and suggest a modulatory effect of endogenous adenosine on cardiac non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic neurotransmission.", 
    "69": "The renal vasodilatory response to beta-2 adrenoceptor stimulation is greater in fetal than adult sheep. Since this phenomenon could not be explained by differences in cAMP-mediated events, we examined the ontogeny of renal beta adrenoceptor subtypes by radioligand binding using the beta adrenergic antagonist 125I-pindolol. The specific binding of 125I-pindolol was saturable, reversible, and stereoselective. Competition studies using the selective beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic antagonists (ICI 89406 and ICI 118551, respectively) revealed two beta adrenoceptor subtypes in adult kidneys but only the beta-2 subtype in fetal kidneys. Preincubation of renal cortical membranes with either the beta-1 or the beta-2 adrenergic antagonist prior to competition studies in adult kidneys decreased specific binding and resulted in the detection of only one beta adrenoceptor subtype. Preincubation of fetal kidneys with the beta-1 adrenergic antagonist did not affect binding characteristics; preincubation of fetal kidneys with the beta-2 adrenergic antagonist markedly decreased specific binding from 64 +/- 2% (n = 4) to 29 +/- 2% (n = 3) (P less than 0.05). Analysis of Rosenthal plots revealed similar beta adrenoceptor densities and affinities between fetal and adult kidneys.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "70": "Effect of a new beta receptor blocking agent, an aryl oxybutanolamine derivative, the Chinoin--103 on K(+)-activated pNPP-ase activity has been studied. Propranolol and practolol were used as reference substances. It has been established that Chinoin-103 in concentration of 10(-4) M significantly hindered total pNPP-ase activity. On the other hand base pNPP-ase activity did not significantly change on the effect of the highest investigable concentration. Study of enzyme kinetic parameters has shown that decrease of base pNPP-ase activity can be attributed to decrease of reaction rate (Vmax decreases) at the same time enzyme affinity to pNPP substrate significantly increases (Km decreases). Taking into consideration the structural similarity of propranolol and Chinoin--103 it is presumable that Chinoin--103 can interact with components of membrane like propanolol and impediment of pNPP-ase activity can be attributed to the interaction.", 
    "71": "The synthesis of alpha,alpha' (iminobis(methylene]-bis-(3,4-dihydro-2H-1benzopyran-2-metha nol) derivatives and the stereochemistry and pharmacological profile of this new class of antihypertensive compounds are described.

    "72": "Human growth hormone (hGH) administered alone revealed itself as a useful drug to prevent ventricular aneurysm formation in experimental myocardial infarctions in rats and is also able to diminish and change the usually expected pattern of wall necrosis. A protective action on the collagen framework of myocytes has been confirmed as one of the main causes responsible for the above mentioned findings. There are other positive metabolic actions on the myocardial cell although not completely known yet. These actions are revealed by an atypical picture of infarction which appears regionally reduced and with a patchy intracellular distribution. In an opposite fashion, when hGH was administered together with beta blockers, a rapid and extensive deleterious action occurred at the ventricular wall, a very high incidence of ventricular aneurysms and an increased extension of myocardial infarcts were the most outstanding features. The histologic picture in this series resembles that of a rapidly evolving diabetic cardiomyopathy.", 
    "73": "1. Experiments were carried out to characterize the adrenoceptors mediating relaxant responses in the rat distal colon. Three agonists were used: noradrenaline, isoprenaline and the beta 3-adrenoceptor agonist BRL 37344. Phentolamine, propranolol and (+/- )-cyanopindolol were tested as antagonists. Tone in the rat distal colon was induced with KCl (30-40 mM) as a spasmogen, and relaxations of this KCl-induced tone produced by the agonists were measured. 2. Relaxant responses to noradrenaline that were obtained in the presence of propranolol (1 microM) were not antagonized by phentolamine (0.01 to 1 microM). Relaxant responses to isoprenaline that were obtained in the presence of phentolamine (1 microM) were antagonized in a concentration-dependent manner by propranolol (0.01 to 3 microM), although this antagonism was weak and non-competitive. Relaxant responses to BRL 37344 that were obtained in the presence of phentolamine (1 microM) were only weakly antagonized by high (1 microM) concentrations of propranolol. 3. Tachyphylaxis to BRL 37344 was observed, a second concentration-response curve being shifted to the right by 15 fold. Exposure of the tissues to BRL 37344 (1 microM) between concentration-response curves also caused rightward shifts in the responses to noradrenaline (18 fold) and isoprenaline (19 fold) but not to papaverine. 4. In the presence of phentolamine (1 microM) and propranolol (1 microM), the rank order of potency of the agonists was: (-)-isoprenaline (1.0) greater than or equal to BRL 37344 (0.93) greater than (-)-noradrenaline (0.3). 5. Responses to BRL 37344 in the presence of phentolamine (1 microM) and propranolol (1 microM) were antagonized by (+/-)-cyanopindolol (I microM), with an apparent pA2 value of 6.67. Responses to isoprenaline, under the same conditions, were antagonized in a competitive manner by (+/-)-cyanopindolol (0.1 to 10 microM), with the slope of the Schild plot close to unity and a pA2 value of 7.12. 6. The resistance of the relaxant responses to antagonism by phentolamine and propranolol, along with the relatively high potency of the beta 3-adrenoceptor agonist BRL 37344 and the antagonism of 'resistant' responses by (+/-)-cyanopindolol would suggest that 'atypical' beta 6-adrenoceptors, similar to the beta 3-adrenoceptors of rat adipocytes and other tissues, exist in the rat distal colon.", 
    "74": "A reduction of breathing control in palmitoylcarnitine oxidation without changes in phosphorylation efficacy coefficient have been noted upon intraabdominal injections of ketamine to rats at a dose of 50 mg/kg. The morphological signs noted were: mitochondrial matrix induration and insignificant focal disturbances of cardiac apparatus (myofibril) contractility. In beta-adrenergic stimulation of the heart by novodrine during ketamine anesthesia a sharp reduction in breathing control and phosphorylation efficacy coefficient are observed with the oxidation of succinate, caprylic acids and palmitoylcarnitine by myocardial mitochondria. Morphologically the disturbance of mitochondrial cysts, appearance of mitochondrial myelinic structures and partial destruction of mitochondrial membranes have been observed. In beta-adrenergic heart blockade by adrenoblockers obsidan and cordanum during ketamine anesthesia, obsidan induces an increase in phosphorylation efficacy coefficient, with morphologically normal energy and contractility apparatus. Cordanum is not so effective when used during ketamine anesthesia.", 
    "75": "The Captopril Prevention Project (CAPPP) is a prospective, randomized, multi-centre intervention trial designed to investigate whether antihypertensive treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril may reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity more than a therapeutic regimen which does not include an ACE inhibitor. Secondary objectives are to compare total mortality, the development or deterioration of ischaemic heart disease, left ventricular failure, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus and possible differences in renal function in the two groups. Male and female patients with essential hypertension, aged 25-66 years, will be randomly allocated to antihypertensive treatment which will comprise either the use of the ACE inhibitor captopril or will exclude all types of ACE inhibitors. Some 275 hypertension centres and health care centres in Sweden and Finland will take part in this multi-centre trial. A total of 7000 patients will be recruited and studied for an average period of 5 years, the assumption being that a 20% difference in cardiovascular mortality between the two groups can be detected with a power of 80% at the 5% significance level (two-sided test).", 
    "76": "Previous electrophysiological studies in aged rats have revealed a number of deficits in noradrenergic neurotransmission in the central nervous system. Such deficits include subsensitivity to the depressant effects of norepinephrine on cerebellar Purkinje neurons, which has been attributed specifically to altered beta adrenergic receptor-mediated processes. The objective of this study was to determine which beta adrenergic receptor subtype, beta 1 or beta 2, is responsible for this age-related subsensitivity. The effects of beta 1 and beta 2 agonists on spontaneous activity of Purkinje neurons was first examined in young rats and the selectivity of these agents was validated using selective beta 1 and beta 2 antagonists. The effects of the selective beta 1 and beta 2 agonists were then compared in young (3-month-old) and aged (18- and 26-month-old) Fischer 344 rats. These agents were applied to Purkinje neurons by pressure microejection from multibarreled micropipettes and the change in neuronal action potential discharge rate was recorded. Both dobutamine, a beta 1-selective agonist, and zinterol, a beta 2-selective agonist, induced dose-dependent inhibitions of Purkinje cell firing rate. Dobutamine-induced inhibitions were blocked by the selective beta 1 antagonist, ICI 89406 and not by the beta 2-selective antagonist, ICI 118551; conversely, zinterol-induced inhibitions were not blocked by ICI 89406 but were blocked by the presence of ICI 118551. Purkinje neurons of both groups of aged rats were significantly less sensitive to locally applied dobutamine than Purkinje cells of young rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "77": "beta-Adrenergic blockers are less efficacious as monotherapy for the treatment of hypertension in blacks as compared with whites. Because beta-adrenergic stimulation and blockade differ between racial groups, biochemical differences in the beta-adrenergic pathway may exist. It is the intent of this report to show underlying similarities and differences, at least in part, in the beta-adrenergic pathway (e.g., baseline cAMP and protein concentrations) using the T-lymphocyte as the model system. A total of 20 (n = 10 black, n = 10 white) normotensive male volunteers were recruited, begun on a low-sodium diet to normalize serum catecholamines, and blood was collected for lymphocyte beta-receptor isotherm binding experiments and cAMP determination. There were no differences in Bmax, sites per cell, or kd. Basal cAMP concentrations were significantly higher in the black group (16.0 +/- 9.8 pmol/10(6) cells) compared with the white group (7.0 +/- 1.8 pmol/10(6) cells) (p less than 0.05). Protein levels from the lymphocyte suspension were also higher in the black group (1,081.0 +/- 367.7 micrograms/ml) compared with the white group (766.8 +/- 220.4 micrograms/ml) (p less than 0.05). Normalization of cAMP for protein yielded 83.2 +/- 55.4 fmol/micrograms protein in the black group and 56.6 +/- 29.8 fmol/micrograms protein in the white group (p = 0.11). Altered protein levels may be a confounding variable in studies of this type. Further work is necessary to identify the nature and significance of this protein elevation, its relationship to the adenylate cyclase system in lymphocytes, and the source of the cAMP elevation noted herein.", 
    "78": "Topically administered ophthalmic medications are capable of attaining clinically important serum concentrations, as evidenced by the variety of systemic side effects they can produce. These drugs are therefore also capable of interacting with other drugs administered orally and intravenously. This is especially important when medications are administered to an elderly population, who are often receiving multiple medications. The Physician's Desk Reference and the United States Pharmacopeia Drug Information directory contain numerous warnings of potential interactions between topical glaucoma medications and systemically administered drugs. Unfortunately, literature supporting such interactions is limited, both in quantity and quality, being anecdotal in many cases. This report summarizes available information regarding the nonocular interactions between topical ophthalmic glaucoma medications and other systemically administered medications. Clinical evidence of these interactions is lacking in many cases.", 
    "79": "The use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) is reviewed. The sympathetic nervous system plays an important compensatory role in maintaining inotropic support of the failing heart; therefore, beta blockers have long been considered contraindicated in CHF patients. However, prolonged excessive activation of the sympathetic nervous system may be detrimental. Several clinical trials have shown improved functional status and hemodynamic indices in some patients with dilated cardiomyopathy who received beta blockers. The maximum effect required up to 12 months. Two studies also showed trends toward improved survival. Aspects of study design that appear to be associated with the observation of a favorable response to beta blockade in CHF patients are a low initial dosage, gradual adjustment of the dosage, and a sufficient duration of therapy. Trials with unfavorable results lacked one or more of those design characteristics. Mechanisms proposed to underlie the beneficial effects of beta blockers in CHF patients include up-regulation of beta-receptors, reduction in cardiac energy requirements, protection of the myocardium against norepinephrine toxicity, and anti-arrhythmic effects. Most studies were conducted in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy; it is unknown whether beta-blocker therapy is equally beneficial in patients with CHF arising from other causes. Metoprolol is the agent for which there is the most experience; comparative efficacy trials have not been conducted. Beta-adrenergic blockers appear to be beneficial in some patients with CHF. Further trials are needed to identify the patients most likely to respond and the drugs most likely to work.", 
    "80": "1. The effects of selective beta-adrenoceptor partial agonist activity on plasma creatine kinase (CK) and skeletal muscle symptoms were studied in normal volunteers. 2. A drug with beta 1-selective partial agonist activity (xamoterol) and one with partial agonist activity acting mainly through beta 2-adrenoceptors (pindolol) were each given for 3 weeks in a randomised double-blind crossover study in 10 subjects. Five additional subjects received only one drug. Plasma CK levels were monitored during a baseline placebo run-in phase, the active treatment period and a placebo washout phase which continued until CK levels returned to baseline. 3. The degree of beta-adrenoceptor antagonism was determined by the inhibition of exercise-induced tachycardia and was similar for the two drug doses used. 4. During pindolol administration plasma CK levels rose compared with pretreatment baseline levels and with levels during xamoterol administration which did not rise. After pindolol was withdrawn CK levels reached higher peaks in some subjects after 1-5 days. 5. Muscle cramps were reported by five subjects during pindolol administration and by one of these subjects but to a lesser extent during xamoterol administration. 6. Pindolol may produce this effect, which was not seen with xamoterol, because of its specific beta 2-adrenoceptor partial agonist activity. Elevations in plasma CK produced by this type of drug or its withdrawal may cause confusion in the diagnosis of muscle disease or myocardial infarction unless the myocardial isoenzyme is measured.", 
    "81": "Arrhythmias are frequent and associated with a poor prognosis, especially when they arise from the ventricle. Although the correction of predisposing factors and improvement of hemodynamic conditions are essential, the use of antiarrhythmic drugs in this context poses problems. The treatment of even complex ventricular extrasystoles has not been shown to effectively prevent the serious arrhythmias responsible for sudden death. Depression of left ventricular function and: Or proarrhythmic effects of antiarrhythmic therapy in some patients, probably offset the benefits observed in others. The treatment of atrial arrhythmias remains traditional: reduction by drugs or electrotherapy and prevention of recurrences, or simply slowing the ventricular response. Sustained ventricular tachycardia and resuscitated ventricular fibrillation should be managed more aggressively, not by empirical antiarrhythmic treatment but by medical therapy guided by the results of electrophysiological studies, and, when this fails, by non-medical treatment: fulguration, implantable defibrillator, antiarrhythmic surgery, or even cardiac transplantation.", 
    "82": "Noradrenergic sympathetic tone is always increased in chronic left ventricular failure of which it is one of the main compensatory mechanisms. Beta-1-adrenergic stimulation increases the heart rate and left ventricular contractility. However, the efficacy of this \"compensatory\" mechanism is limited on the one hand by the energetic cost of inotropic stimulation and, on the other hand, by the phenomenon of desensitisation and down-regulation of myocardial beta-1-receptors during intense and prolonged noradrenergic stimulation as observed in chronic cardiac failure. These physiopathological concepts raise the question of the indications of drugs affecting betareceptors in cardiac failure. Positive inotropic beta-mimetics can only be used during short periods of acute decompensation: low dose betablocker therapy protects the betareceptors from the phenomenon of desensitisation and seem to exert a beneficial action in this way in some cases of cardiac failure; these preliminary results require confirmation by large scale controlled therapeutic trials. Finally, a new pharmacological class of drugs, the beta-1 adrenergic partial agonists, seems to be useful in the management of moderate degrees of cardiac failure due to ischemic heart disease.", 
    "83": "An enquiry into the prescribing behaviour in patients discharged from hospital after myocardial infarction was performed in 36 hospital departments in France and included 528 patients. Each patient was prescribed an average of 3.6 drugs. The most commonly prescribed drug was Aspirin (63.3%) followed by the calcium antagonists (61.7%) long acting nitrate derivatives (49.5%) and betablockers (41.5%). These results suggest that many post-infarction prescriptions disregard recently acquired scientific knowledge.",
