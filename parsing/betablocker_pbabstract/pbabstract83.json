    "0": "Despite significant advances in pharmacological and clinical treatment, heart failure remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. G-protein coupled receptors are a wide superfamily of plasma membrane receptors which represent an important target of heart failure drug therapy. Since heart failure is characterized by the overactivity of different neurohormones, such as catecholamines and angiotensin II, responsible for several detrimental effects on the cardiovascular system, over the last decade therapeutic strategies targeting beta-adrenergic and angiotensin receptors have been developed. Despite the introduction of successful drug classes, such as beta-adrenergic receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and sartans, heart failure still poses an enormous challenge, thus indicating the urgent need to develop innovative treatments that might counteract mechanisms involved in heart failure onset and progression. It is now established that a single receptor, activated by the same agonist, can elicit several different signaling pathways often resulting in opposite cellular responses, some beneficial and some detrimental. However, drugs currently used in heart failure target receptors on their extracellular domain by competing with the endogenous agonists. Thus, they can inhibit non-specifically all the receptor-related signaling pathways including those with beneficial activity whose blockade would not be desirable in heart failure. These observations stress the need for the generation of new therapeutic molecules able to target specific signaling pathways which might result in innovative therapies for cardiovascular disease.", 
    "1": "Skin wound healing is a complex process requiring the coordinated, temporal orchestration of numerous cell types and biological processes to regenerate damaged tissue. Previous work has demonstrated that a functional \u03b2-adrenergic receptor autocrine/paracrine network exists in skin, but the role of \u03b22-adrenergic receptor (\u03b22AR) in wound healing is unknown. A range of in vitro (single-cell migration, immunoblotting, ELISA, enzyme immunoassay), ex vivo (rat aortic ring assay), and in vivo (chick chorioallantoic membrane assay, zebrafish, murine wild-type, and \u03b22AR knockout excisional skin wound models) models were used to demonstrate that blockade or loss of \u03b22AR gene deletion promoted wound repair, a finding that is, to our knowledge, previously unreported. Compared with vehicle-only controls, \u03b22AR antagonism increased angiogenesis, dermal fibroblast function, and re-epithelialization, but had no effect on wound inflammation in vivo. Skin wounds in \u03b22AR knockout mice contracted and re-epithelialized faster in the first few days of wound repair in vivo. \u03b22AR antagonism enhanced cell motility through distinct intracellular signalling mechanisms and increased vascular endothelial growth factor secretion from keratinocytes. \u03b22AR antagonism promoted wound repair processes in the early stages of wound repair, revealing a possible new avenue for therapeutic intervention.", 
    "2": "The photodegradation of the widely used \u03b2-blockers atenolol and metoprolol were investigated in the presence of fulvic acid (FA) under simulated sunlight. Both atenolol and metoprolol undergo indirect photodegradation in the FA solutions. The triplet excited state of FA ((3)FA(\u2217)) was verified to be main reactive species responsible for the photosensitized degradation of \u03b2-blockers. An electron transfer mechanism for the interaction between \u03b2-blockers and (3)FA(\u2217) was proposed on the basis of a series of experiments. Magnetic property of metal ions exhibited significant impact on photosensitized degradation. Diamagnetic metal ions such as Mg(2+), Ca(2+), Zn(2+), and Al(3+) negligibly affected the degradation. In contrast, paramagnetic metal ions including Mn(2+), Cu(2+), Fe(3+), and Cr(3+) markedly inhibited the reactions in the order of Cr(3+) < Fe(3+) < Cu(2+) < Mn(2+). The inhibition was related to the complexation ability with FA. By LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis, deisopropyl-atenolol (metoprolol) was identified as the main photosensitized product. The degradation pathways of \u03b2-blockers involving electron transfer processes were proposed. This finding strongly suggests that (3)FA(\u2217) was important reactive species for the degradation of \u03b2-blockers in natural waters.", 
    "3": "Inflammation is a significant player in the progression of heart failure and has detrimental effects on cardiac function. Prostaglandin (PG)E2, a major proinflammatory prostanoid in the cardiovascular system, is a potent stimulus in inducing intracellular cAMP but minimally affects cardiac contractile function. Here, we show that the PGE2 stimulation attenuates the adrenergic-induced cardiac contractile response in animal hearts. Stimulation with PGE2 leads to stimulatory G protein (Gs)-dependent production of cAMP. However, the induced cAMP is spatially restricted because of its degradation by phosphodiesterase (PDE)4 and cannot access the intracellular sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) for increasing calcium signaling and myocyte contraction. Moreover, pretreatment with PGE2 significantly inhibits PKA activities at the SR induced by a \u03b2-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol, and subsequently blocks isoproterenol-induced PKA phosphorylation of phospholamban and contractile responses in myocytes. Further analysis reveals that the PGE2-induced cAMP/PKA is sufficient to phosphorylate and activate PDE4D isoforms, which, in turn, spatially inhibits the diffusion of adrenergic-induced cAMP from the plasma membrane to the SR. Inhibition of PDE4 rescues the adrenergic-induced increase in cAMP/PKA activities at the SR, PKA phosphorylation of phospholamban, and contractile responses in PGE2-pretreated myocytes. Thus, this offers an example that one Gs-coupled receptor is able to inhibit the intracellular signaling transduction initiated by another Gs-coupled receptor via controlling the diffusion of cAMP, presenting a paradigm for G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signal transduction. It also provides a mechanism for the integration of signaling initiated by different neurohormonal stimuli, as well as long-term effects of chronically circulating proinflammatory factors in myocardium.", 
    "4": "Hypertension guidelines advise limiting the dose of thiazide diuretics and avoiding combination with \u03b2-blockade, because of increased risk of diabetes mellitus. We tested whether changes in the 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test could be detected after 4 weeks of treatment with a thiazide and could be avoided by switching to amiloride. Two double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover studies were performed. In study 1 (41 patients), we found that changes in glucose during a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test could be detected after 4 weeks of treatment with bendroflumethiazide. In study 2, 37 patients with essential hypertension received, in random order, 4 weeks of once-daily treatment with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25 to 50 mg, nebivolol 5 to 10 mg, combination (HCTZ 25-50 mg+nebivolol 5-10 mg), amiloride (10-20 mg), and placebo. Each drug was force titrated at 2 weeks and separated by a 4-week placebo washout. At each visit, we recorded blood pressure and performed a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. Primary outcome was the difference in glucose (over the 2 hours of the oral glucose tolerance test) between 0 and 4 weeks, when HCTZ and amiloride were compared by repeated-measures analysis. For similar blood pressure reductions, there were opposite changes in glucose between the 2 diuretics (P<0.0001). Nebivolol did not impair glucose tolerance, either alone or in combination. There was a negative correlation between \u0394potassium and \u03942-hour glucose (r=-0.28; P<0.0001). In 2 crossover studies, 4 weeks of treatment with a thiazide diuretic impaired glucose tolerance. No impairment was seen with K(+)-sparing diuretic or \u03b2(1)-selective blockade. Substitution or addition of amiloride may be the solution to preventing thiazide-induced diabetes mellitus.", 
    "5": "To investigate whether heart rate reduction via I(f)-channel blockade and \u03b2-receptor blockade prevents left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, we studied ivabradine and metoprolol in angiotensin II-induced heart failure. Cardiac dysfunction in C57BL/6J mice was induced by implantation of osmotic pumps for continuous subcutaneous dosing of angiotensin II (1.8 mg/kg per day SC) over a period of 3 weeks. Ivabradine (10 mg/kg per day) and metoprolol (90 mg/kg per day), which resulted in similar heart rate reduction, or placebo treatments were simultaneously started with infusion of angiotensin II. After 3 weeks, LV function was estimated by conductance catheter technique, cardiac remodeling assessed by estimation of cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and inflammatory stress response by immunohistochemistry or PCR, respectively. Compared with controls, angiotensin II infusion resulted in hypertension in impaired systolic (LV contractility, stroke volume, end systolic elastance, afterload, index of arterial-ventricular coupling, and cardiac output; P<0.05) and diastolic (LV relaxation, LV end diastolic pressure, \u03c4, and stiffness constant \u03b2; P<0.05) LV function. This was associated with a significant increase in cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. Increased cardiac stress was also indicated by an increase in cardiac inflammation and apoptosis. Both ivabradine and metoprolol led to a similar reduction in heart rate. Metoprolol also reduced systolic blood pressure. Ivabradine led to a significant improvement in systolic and diastolic LV function (P<0.05). This was associated with less cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, inflammation, and cardiac apoptosis (P<0.05). Metoprolol treatment did not prevent the reduction in cardiac function and adverse remodeling, despite a reduction of the inflammatory stress response. Behind heart rate reduction, additional beneficial cardiac effects contribute to heart failure prevention with I(f)-channel inhibition.", 
    "6": "Insulin resistance (IR) is involved in the pathogenesis of endothelial dysfunction and is also present in patients with cirrhosis. Intrahepatic endothelial dysfunction plays a major role, increasing hepatic vascular resistance and promoting portal hypertension (PH). In addition, \u03b2-adrenergic agonists and insulin share several intracellular signaling pathways. Thus IR may influence the response to \u03b2-blockers. This study aimed at evaluating the relationship between IR and hepatic hemodynamics in patients with cirrhosis and with the portal pressure response to acute \u03b2-blockade. Forty-nine patients with cirrhosis and PH were included. Hepatic and systemic hemodynamics were measured, and IR was estimated by using the updated homeostasis model assessment (HOMA)-2 index. Patients with HOMA-2 > 2.4 were considered IR. In patients with hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) \u2265 10 mmHg) [clinically significant PH (CSPH)], hemodynamic measurements were performed again 20 min after intravenous propranolol. Mean HOMA-2 index was 3 \u00b1 1.4. Fifty-seven percent of patients had IR. A weak correlation between HOMA-2 index and HVPG was observed. Eighty-six percent of patients had CSPH. HOMA-2 index was an independent predictor of CSPH. However, in patients with CSPH, the correlation between HOMA-2 index and HVPG was lost. HVPG, but not IR, predicted the presence of esophageal varices. Response to propranolol was not different between patients with or without IR. In nondiabetic patients with cirrhosis, HOMA-2 index is directly associated with the presence of CSPH and indirectly with varices, but does not allow either grading HVPG or predicting its response to propranolol.",

    "8": "The trauma registry and the surgical intensive care unit (ICU) databases of an academic Level I trauma center were used to identify all patients sustaining blunt head injury requiring ICU admission from July 1998 to December 2009. Patients sustaining major associated extracranial injuries (Abbreviated Injury Scale [AIS] score \u2265 3 in any body region) were excluded. Patient demographics, injury profile, Injury Severity Score, and beta-blocker exposure were abstracted. The primary outcome evaluated was in-hospital mortality stratified by ethnicity.",

The diabetic and control non-diabetic rats were assigned randomly to receive no anti-hypertension treatment, or to be treated with the angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), valsartan (40 mg/kg/d) or the beta-blocker, metoprolol (50 mg/kg/day). Eight weeks later, retinas were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and Western blot to detect changes in the expression of AQP1, AQP4, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP).",

Valsartan and metoprolol decreased GFAP, AQP1, and AQP4 expression in diabetic SHR rats (P < 0.01). Valsartan decreased GFAP and AQP1 expression in diabetic WKY rats (P < 0.01), while metoprolol did not.",

    "15": "Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a leading cause of blindness in children and is, in its most severe form, characterized by uncontrolled growth of vision-threatening pathologic vessels. Propranolol, a nonselective \u03b2-adrenergic receptor blocker, was reported to protect against pathologic retinal neovascularization in a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR). Based on this single animal study using nonstandard evaluation of retinopathy, clinical trials are currently ongoing to evaluate propranolol treatment in stage 2 ROP patients who tend to experience spontaneous disease regression and are at low risk of blindness. Because these ROP patients are vulnerable premature infants who are still in a fragile state of incomplete development, the efficacy of propranolol treatment in retinopathy needs to be evaluated thoroughly in preclinical animal models of retinopathy and potential benefits weighed against potential adverse effects.",

Three routes of propranolol treatment were assessed from P12 to P16: oral gavage, intraperitoneal injection, or subcutaneous injection, with doses varying between 2 and 60 mg/kg/day. At P17, retinal flatmounts were stained with isolectin and quantified with a standard protocol to measure vasoobliteration and pathologic neovascularization. Retinal gene expression was analyzed with qRT-PCR using RNA isolated from retinas of control and propranolol-treated pups.",

Two cases of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy related to tracheal manipulation are presented. Both the patients had all the typical symptoms and signs of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, and both of them recovered completely within weeks. Tracheal manipulation is a well-known stress factor during the perioperative period, and experience from these two cases stresses the crucial role of measures aimed to stress reduction. Proper premedication and calm environment are recommended to produce anxiolysis before intubation. The administration of \u03b1- and \u03b2-blockers is also recommended to inhibit sympathetic stress caused by tracheal manipulation.", 
    "20": "Infectious complications, predominantly pneumonia, are the most common cause of death in the postacute phase of stroke, although the mechanisms underlying the corresponding immunosuppression are not fully understood. We tested the hypothesis that activation of the \u03b17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (\u03b17nAChR) pathway is important in the stroke-induced increase in lung injury caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia in mice. Prior stroke increased lung vascular permeability caused by P. aeruginosa pneumonia and was associated with decreased lung neutrophil recruitment and bacterial clearance in mice. Pharmacologic inhibition (methyllycaconitine IC(50): 0.2-0.6 nM) or genetic deletion of the \u03b17nAChR significantly (P<0.05) attenuates the effect of prior stroke on lung injury and mortality caused by P. aeruginosa pneumonia in mice. Finally, pretreatment with PNU-282987, a pharmacologic activator of the \u03b17nAChR (EC(50): 0.2 \u03bcM), significantly (P<0.05) increased lung injury caused by P. aeruginosa pneumonia, significantly (P<0.05) decreased the release of KC, a major neutrophil chemokine, and significantly (P<0.05) decreased intracellular bacterial killing by a mouse alveolar macrophage cell line and primary mouse neutrophils. In summary, the \u03b17 nicotinic cholinergic pathway plays an important role in mediating the systemic immunosuppression observed after stroke and directly contributes to more severe lung damage induced by P. aeruginosa.", 
    "21": "Studies have shown that \u03b2-blockers can improve cardiac performance in heart failure (HF) by reversing protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ leak. However, it is being strongly questioned as to whether the PKA-mediated ryanodine receptor (RyR2) hyper-phosphorylation is a critical regulator of SR Ca2+ leak. In this study, we used a rabbit HF model to investigate whether \u03b2-blockers affect SR Ca2+ leak by other potential mechanisms.", 
    "22": "New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided in three groups (n=7 in each group): normal group, metoprolol-untreated group and metoprolol-treated group.

    "25": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is a common mediator of disease and organ injury. Although recent studies show that inducing mitochondrial biogenesis (MB) stimulates cell repair and regeneration, only a limited number of chemicals are known to induce MB. To examine the impact of the \u03b2-adrenoceptor (\u03b2-AR) signaling pathway on MB, primary renal proximal tubule cells (RPTC) and adult feline cardiomyocytes were exposed for 24 h to multiple \u03b2-AR agonists: isoproterenol (nonselective \u03b2-AR agonist), (\u00b1)-(R*,R*)-[4-[2-[[2-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl]amino]propyl]phenoxy] acetic acid sodium hydrate (BRL 37344) (selective \u03b2(3)-AR agonist), and formoterol (selective \u03b2(2)-AR agonist). The Seahorse Biosciences (North Billerica, MA) extracellular flux analyzer was used to quantify carbonylcyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP)-uncoupled oxygen consumption rate (OCR), a marker of maximal electron transport chain activity. Isoproterenol and BRL 37244 did not alter mitochondrial respiration at any of the concentrations examined. Formoterol exposure resulted in increases in both FCCP-uncoupled OCR and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number. The effect of formoterol on OCR in RPTC was inhibited by the \u03b2-AR antagonist propranolol and the \u03b2(2)-AR inverse agonist 3-(isopropylamino)-1-[(7-methyl-4-indanyl)oxy]butan-2-ol hydrochloride (ICI-118,551). Mice exposed to formoterol for 24 or 72 h exhibited increases in kidney and heart mtDNA copy number, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 coactivator 1\u03b1, and multiple genes involved in the mitochondrial electron transport chain (F0 subunit 6 of transmembrane F-type ATP synthase, NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1, NADH dehydrogenase subunit 6, and NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1\u03b2 subcomplex subunit 8). Cheminformatic modeling, virtual chemical library screening, and experimental validation identified nisoxetine from the Sigma Library of Pharmacologically Active Compounds and two compounds from the ChemBridge DIVERSet that increased mitochondrial respiratory capacity.

However, few clinical data are available to prove a toxic effect at the level of the anterior chamber. The laser flare meter is a reliable tool to detect low levels of inflammation in the anterior chamber. We wanted to know whether instillation of BAK-preserved timolol in one eye would result in higher laser flare values than the instillation of preservative-free timolol in the fellow eye.", 
    "27": "Randomized prospective, single-masked clinical trial. Twenty-eight untreated patients with ocular hypertension were recruited.

    "30": "A heart-pump interaction model has been developed based on animal experimental measurements obtained with a rotary blood pump in situ. Five canine experiments were performed to investigate the interaction between the cardiovascular system and the implantable rotary blood pump over a wide range of operating conditions, including variations in cardiac contractility and heart rate, systemic vascular resistance (SVR), and total blood volume (V(total) ). It was observed in our experiments that SVR decreased with increasing mean pump speed under the healthy condition, but was relatively constant during the speed ramp study under reduced cardiac contractility conditions. Furthermore, we also found a significant increase in pulmonary vascular resistance with increasing mean pump speed and decreasing total blood volume, despite a relatively constant SVR. Least squares parameter estimation methods were utilized to fit a subset of model parameters in order to achieve better agreement with the experimental data and to evaluate the robustness and validity of the model under various operating conditions. The fitted model produced reasonable agreement with the experimental measurements, both in terms of mean values and steady-state waveforms. In addition, all the optimized parameters were within physiological limits.", 
    "31": "The circadian timing system (CTS) governs the 24-h rhythm of the organism and, hence, also main pathways responsible for drug pharmacokinetics. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a drug transporter that plays a pivotal role in drug absorption, distribution, and elimination, and temporal changes in its activity may affect input, output, activity, and toxicity profile of drugs. In the current study, the influence of different circadian stages on the overall intestinal permeability (P(eff)) of the P-gp substrates talinolol and losartan was evaluated in in situ intestinal perfusion studies in rats. Additionally, in vivo studies in rats were performed by employing the P-gp probe talinolol during the day (nonactive) and night (active) period in rats. Effective intestinal permeabilities of talinolol and losartan were smaller in studies performed during the night (p < .05), indicating that P-gp-dependent intestinal secretion is greater during the nighttime activity span than daytime rest span of the animals. P-gp modulators vinblastine and PSC833 led to a significant decrease of talinolol and losartan exsorption in the intestinal segments as compared with control groups. Strikingly, the permeability-enhancing effect of vinblastine and PSC833 was higher with night perfusions, for both talinolol and losartan. In vivo studies performed with talinolol revealed-consistent with the in situ studies (P(eff) day > night)-a day vs. night difference in the oral availability of talinolol in the group of male rats in terms of the area under the curve (AUC) data (AUC(day) > AUC(night)). The P-gp modulator vinblastine significantly increased talinolol AUC(day) (p < .05), whereas only a weak vinblastine effect was seen in night. According to the in situ data, the functional activity of P-gp was regulated by the CTS in jejunum and ileum, which are major intestinal segments for energy-dependent efflux. In conclusion, circadian rhythms may affect carrier-mediated active efflux and play a role in the absorption process. In addition to daily rhythms in P-gp activity in rat intestine, the in vivo studies indicate that absorption-, distribution-, metabolism-, and elimination-relevant rhythms may be involved in the circadian kinetics of the drug, besides transporter-dependent efflux, such well-known aspects as metabolic or renal clearance or motility. Since this also holds true for a potentially interacting second compound (modulator), modulator effects should be evaluated carefully in transporter related drug-drug interactions.", 
    "32": "New series of acids and hydroxamic acids linked to five-membered heterocycles including furan, oxazole, 1,2,4- or 1,3,4-oxadiazole, and imidazole were synthesized and tested as inhibitors against the Fe(II) , Co(II) , and Mn(II) forms of E. coli methionine aminopeptidase (MetAP) and as antibacterial agents against wild-type and acrAB E. coli strains. 2-Aryloxazol-4-ylcarboxylic acids appeared as potent and selective inhibitors of the Co(II) MetAP form, with IC(50) values in the micromolar range, whereas 5-aryloxazol-2-ylcarboxylic acid regioisomers and 5-aryl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-ylcarboxylic acids were shown to be inefficient against all forms of EcMetAP. Regardless of the heterocycle, all the hydroxamic acids are highly potent inhibitors and are selective for the Mn(II) and Fe(II) forms, with IC(50) values between 1 and 2 \u03bcM. One indole hydroxamic acid that we previously reported as a potent inhibitor of E. coli peptide deformylase also demonstrated efficiency against EcMetAP. To gain insight into the positioning of the oxazole heterocycle with reversed substitutions at positions 2 and 5, X-ray crystal structures of EcMetAP-Mn complexed with two such oxazole hydroxamic acids were solved. Irrespective of the [metal]/[apo-MetAP] ratio, the active site consistently contains a dinuclear manganese center, with the hydroxamate as bridging ligand. Asp 97, which adopts a bidentate binding mode to the Mn2 site in the holoenzyme, is twisted in both structures toward the hydroxamate bridging ligand to favor the formation of a strong hydrogen bond. Most of the compounds show weak antibacterial activity against a wild-type E. coli strain. However, increased antibacterial activity was observed mainly for compounds with a 2-substituted phenyl group in the presence of the nonapeptide polymyxin B and phenylalanine-arginine-\u03b2-naphthylamide as permeabilizer and efflux pump blocker, respectively, which boost the intracellular uptake of the inhibitors.", 
    "33": "Cancer and cardiovascular disease are the leading causes of death worldwide. Cardiovascular medications have recently been found to have favorable effects also for the treatment of noncardiovascular diseases, including cancer. In this review, we use a reverse bedside-to-bench approach to investigate the effects of common cardiovascular medications on tumor angiogenesis and vascular angiogenesis. Aspirin seems to reduce the risk of developing cancer, particularly colon cancer. However, whether the protective influence of aspirin is due to antiangiogenesis effect is still unclear. \u03b2-Blockers, which are normally used to reduce heart rate and prolong diastole, trigger an increase in stretch-associated release of proangiogenic growth factors thereby inducing angiogenesis. However, according to other studies \u03b2-blockers are able to inhibit angiogenesis via multiplicate mechanisms. Similarly, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker have controversial effects for the regulation of cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Statins can augment collateral vascular growth in ischemic tissues and restrict the development of cancer. So this topical anti-inflammatory drug seems to be of high value for further therapy. Finally, suggestions on how this pilot experience may guide the conduct of future preclinical investigations, and clinical trials are discussed.",

    "37": "Twenty-eighty trials with 14,829 patients were included. The b-blockers significantly reduced all cause mortality by 29.6%, cardiac death by 29.8%, sudden death by 49.4%, respectively. The magnitude of benefits of b-blockers in HF patients was increased with the increased male proportion. A similar magnitude of reduction in all cause mortality was observed among the three b blockers. A trend toward to reduced cardiac death was observed among the three b blockers, but only in bisoprolol was this statistically different (RR, 0.72; 95%CI, [0.59-0.87]). Metoprolol was significantly superior to carvedilol (P = 0.008) or bisoprolol (P = 0.034) in reduced sudden death.", 
    "38": "In patients with HF, the 3 commonly used b-blockers significantly reduced mortality. Greater benefits of b-blockers were observed in the higher male proportion studies. The metoprolol was significantly superior to carvedilol or bisoprolol in reduced sudden death. Additional trials are required to determine whether the benefits of b-blockers will be observed in female HF patients.", 
    "39": "Our previous studies in rats with ablation nephrectomy have shown similar cardiorenal protective effects of renin-angiotensin system (RAS)-dependent treatment (combination of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin II receptor blocker) and RAS-independent treatment (combination of \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenoreceptor antagonist and diuretics). Moreover, selective blockade of endothelin (ET) receptor type A (ET(A)) improved survival rate and attenuated hypertension and organ damage in Ren-2 transgenic rats. Therefore, we were interested in whether ET(A) receptor blockade could have additive effects to the classical blockade of the RAS. Transgenic rats underwent 5/6 renal ablation at the age of 2 months and were treated for 20 weeks with RAS blockers alone (angiotensin II receptor blocker - losartan, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor - trandolapril), ET(A) receptor blocker alone (atrasentan) or with the combination of RAS and ET(A) receptor blockade. RAS blockade normalized blood pressure and improved survival. It decreased cardiac hypertrophy and proteinuria as well as tissue angiotensin II and ET-1 levels. In contrast, ET(A) receptor blockade only partially improved survival rate, reduced blood pressure, attenuated the development of cardiac hypertrophy and transiently reduced proteinuria. However, no additive cardio- and renoprotective effects of ET(A) and RAS blockade were noted at the end of the study.", 
    "40": "The understanding of signaling cascades involved in the induction, promotion, and progression of cancer, although advanced in recent years, is still incomplete. Tracing the imbalance of the impaired, physiologically-essential cellular signaling that drives the neoplastic process is a complex issue. This review discusses the role of the regulator of the fight or flight response, the beta-adrenergic signaling cascade, as a mediator of cancer growth and progression in in vitro and in vivo cancer models. We review a series of experiments from our own laboratory and those of others examining the contribution of this signaling network to lung and other human malignancies and thereby identifying potential targets for chemotherapeutic interventions. The stimulation of the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor by lifestyle and environmental factors, as well as a preexisting risk for neoplasm, activates downstream effector molecules (adenylyl cyclase/cAMP/PKA/CREB) concomitant to the transactivation of related pathways (EGFR) that lead to pro-oncogenic signaling; this \u03b2-adrenergic pathway thereby encourages cancer growth by evasion of apoptosis, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis. GABAergic signaling acts as an antagonist to the \u03b2-adrenergic cascade by intercepting adenylyl cyclase activation, and thereby neutralizing the pro-oncogenic effects of \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation. The regulation of cancer cell growth by neurobiological signals expands the possibilities for pharmacological interventions in cancer therapy.",

    "43": "Conjunctival venous diameters ranged from 9 to 34 \u03bcm and blood velocities ranged from 0.08 to 0.95 mm/s. Coefficients of variation of venous diameter and blood velocity measurements were, on average, 6% and 14%, respectively. Automated and manual measurements of venous diameter and velocity were highly correlated (R = 0.97; p < 0.001; n = 16). With phenylephrine administration, diameter and velocity were reduced by 21% and 69%, respectively. Following esmolol administration, blood pressure was reduced with a concomitant decrease in velocity, followed by recovery to baseline.

    "45": "The purpose of this study was to prepare and characterize granulated carvedilol by melt-in and spray-on melt granulation in a fluid bed and a high shear granulator. Granulates having comparable particle size distribution and good flow properties were obtained with proper adjustment of process parameters for each binder (poloxamer 188, polyethylene glycol 4000, and gliceryl monosterate), procedure (spray-on and melt-in) and equipment (fluid bed and high shear granulator). In-line probes for particle size measurements proved to be a useful tool for determining the end point of melt granulation. The product temperature during melt granulation was found to be the critical process parameter for achieving appropriate granulate particle size distribution. The results showed that melt granulation using hydrophilic binders is an effective method to improve the dissolution rate of carvedilol. The method of binder addition to the powders (melt-in or spray-on procedure) was found to strongly influence the dissolution rate of carvedilol. The highest dissolution rates were obtained when the spray-on procedure is used, independently from the type of granulator used. The results also suggest that the most probable explanation for the increase in the dissolution rate of granulated carvedilol is improvement of the wettability through intimate contact between hydrophilic binder and hydrophobic drug.",

    "59": "Trans-scleral delivery is nowadays considered as a possible way to deliver drugs to the posterior segment of the eye. Despite the potentiality of this administration route, there is a lack of fundamental knowledge on the role of the numerous barriers involved. The aim of this work was to develop an easy and cheap ex vivo method to evaluate the barrier properties of the choroid-Bruch's layer and in particular to estimate the role of melanin in drug diffusion through ocular tissues. In vitro binding studies were performed to estimate drug affinity for melanin; model molecules used were methylene blue, propranolol, levofloxacin and methylprednisolone sodium succinate. The ex vivo model set up is based on porcine eye bulbs with light blue iris or brown iris. While the choroid of brown eyes is dark, the choroid of blue eyes is transparent, due to the absence of melanin. Permeation experiments using pigmented and not-pigmented porcine tissues gave the opportunity to discriminate between the barrier role of choroid-Bruch's membrane as such and the barrier role of melanin. Ex vivo permeation experiments can be performed using isolated choroid-Bruch's or the sclera-choroid-Bruch's layer. In this last case, it is possible to take into account also the barrier role of the sclera that tends to decrease the drug concentration at the sclera/choroid interface, thus amplifying the effect of melanin. The data obtained in this paper indicate that for some drugs melanin can really represent a barrier and the effect can imply a lower drug flux or simply a longer lag time depending on the kind of drug and the concentration applied. However, it is a saturable barrier, thus its effect can probably be overtaken by high doses or multiple administrations. The ex vivo model set up can help to refine computational models, to better evaluate the interplay among static, dynamic and metabolic barriers. Additionally, since human eyes display a full range of pigmentation, the model could also be useful to investigate the possible influence of pigmentation phenotype on trans-scleral delivery.",

We firstly reported myocardial benefits of TPGs previously, and the present study is to further investigate the underlying mechanisms for preventing oxidative damage in cardiomyopathy. We measured the capacity of TPGs to scavenge free radicals in vitro. Then 60 SD rats were randomly divided into five groups: (1) a normal control group, (2) an isoprenaline (ISO)-induced myocardial ischemic model group, (3) a TPG treatment group (TPGs 269.4 mg/kg delivered by intragastric administration for 3 days before ISO administration and TPGs 449 mg/kg delivered for 3 days after ISO administration), (4) a TPG therapy group (TPGs 449 mg/kg delivered for 3 days after ISO administration), and (5) a positive control group (propranolol 15 mg/kg for 3 days after ISO administration). The ISO-induced myocardial ischemic model was established by subcutaneous injection of 1mg/kg/8h ISO (2 times). The activities of myocardial enzymes, including glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) as well as the content of lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde (MDA) were detected. We found that TPGs potently eliminated hydroxyl radicals and superoxide in vitro using ESR assays. Compared with model rats, TPG treatment, TPG therapy and the positive control treatment exhibited significantly reduced activities of GOT, LDH, and CK (p < 0.01), increased activity of SOD (p < 0.01) and lower levels of MDA (p < 0.05). More interestingly, the protective effect of TPG treatment was even better than that of propranolol. These results suggest that TPGs significantly ameliorate ISO-induced myocardial ischemia and their action might be through reducing oxidative stress in ischemic myocardium.",

However, to date, combination treatments have been limited to approved drugs and a small number of emerging agents. Using a systematic approach to identify synergistic drug combinations, combination high-throughput screening (cHTS) technology, adenosine A2A and \u03b2-2 adrenergic receptor (\u03b22AR) agonists were shown to be highly synergistic, selective, and novel agents that enhance glucocorticoid activity in B-cell malignancies. Unexpectedly, A2A and \u03b22AR agonists also synergize with melphalan, lenalidomide, bortezomib, and doxorubicin. An analysis of agonists, in combination with dexamethasone or melphalan in 83 cell lines, reveals substantial activity in multiple myeloma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cell lines. Combination effects are also observed with dexamethasone as well as bortezomib, using multiple myeloma patient samples and mouse multiple myeloma xenograft assays. Our results provide compelling evidence in support of development of A2A and \u03b22AR agonists for use in multi-drug combination therapy for multiple myeloma. Furthermore, use of cHTS for the discovery and evaluation of new targets and combination therapies has the potential to improve cancer treatment paradigms and patient outcomes.",

Here we show that topical use of the beta-blocker timolol can also inhibit the growth and promote regression of infantile hemangiomas. In this case series we treated 11 infantile hemangiomas in nine children including six preterm babies with the nonselective betablocker timolol. A timolol containing gel was manufactured from an ophthalmic formulation of timolol 0.5% eyedrops. This gel was applied using a standardized occlusive dressing (Finn-Chambers) containing approximately 0.25\u2003mg of timolol. In all infants topical timolol was associated with growth arrest, a reduction in redness and thickness within the first 2\u2003weeks. Seven hemangiomas showed almost complete resolution, and four became much paler and thinner. No data are available on the transdermal absorption of timolol. Even supposing complete absorption of timolol from the occlusive dressing, a maximum dose of 0.25\u2003mg of timolol would result per day and hemangioma. Regression of infantile hemangiomas treated using 0.5% timolol gel in this case series occurred earlier than spontaneous regression which is generally not observed before the age of 9-12\u2003months.

Most human studies used acute infusion of \u03b2-blockers as a model to eliminate sympathetic stimulation and to examine the contribution of the sympathetic nervous system to energy metabolism and balance. Clinically, however, it is also important to assess the effect of chronic sympathetic attenuation on energy metabolism. In this context, we hypothesized that resting energy expenditure is decreased in patients with autonomic failure who, by definition, have low sympathetic tone. We measured 24-hour energy expenditure using whole-room indirect calorimeter in 10 adults with chronic autonomic failure (6 women; age, 64.9\u00b19.1 years; body mass index, 25.2\u00b14.4 kg/m(2)) and 15 sedentary healthy controls of similar age and body composition (8 women; age, 63.1\u00b14.0 years; body mass index, 24.4\u00b13.9 kg/m(2)). In 4 patients, we eliminated residual sympathetic activity with the ganglionic blocker trimethaphan. We found that, after adjusting for body composition, resting energy expenditure did not differ between patients with autonomic failure and healthy controls.

Clinically significant portal hypertension is defined as HVPG of 10 mmHg or more. Development of gastroesophageal varices and variceal hemorrhage are the most direct consequence of portal hypertension. Over the last decades significant advancements in the field have led to standard treatment options. These clinical recommendations have evolved mostly as a result of randomized controlled trials and consensus conferences among experts where existing evidence has been reviewed and future goals for research and practice guidelines have been proposed. Management of varices/variceal hemorrhage is based on the clinical stage of portal hypertension. No specific treatment has shown to prevent the formation of varices. Prevention of first variceal hemorrhage depends on the size/characteristics of varices. In patients with small varices and high risk of bleeding, non-selective \u03b2-blockers are recommended, while patients with medium/large varices can be treated with either \u03b2-blockers or esophageal band ligation.

In mammals, there is evidence that \u03b2-blockers can cause sexual dysfunction, and alter serotonergic pathways which may impact reproductive behavior but little is known about the effects on fish behavior. The present study tested the effects of propranolol on fecundity, on brain gene expression and on reproductive behavior of the fathead minnow, Pimephales promelas, a fish that exhibits male parental care. Sexually mature fathead minnows were housed at a ratio of one male and two females per tank and exposed to nominal concentrations of 0, 0.1, 1, 10 \u03bcg/l for 21 days.

Propranolol exposure was not associated with a change in nest rubbing behavior, time spent in the nest or approaching the females. There was a significant difference in the number of visits to the nest with males receiving low and medium propranolol treatments. The microarray analysis showed that there were 335 genes up-regulated and 400 genes down-regulated in the brain after exposure to the highest dose of propranolol. Among those genes, myoglobin and calsequestrin transcripts (fold change=10.84 and 5.49, respectively) were highly up-regulated. Ontological analyses indicated changes in genes involved in calcium ion transport, transcription, proteolysis and apoptosis/anti-apoptosis. Pathway analysis indicated that the reduced expression of caspases may lead to impaired neurite outgrowth, neurotransmitter secretion and brain function in developing organisms. The results showed that exposure to propranolol at concentrations as high as 4.11 \u03bcg/l did not significantly impact reproductive behavior or spawning abilities of fathead minnow but did alter the regulation of genes within the brain of fish.",

Hence, we prepared N-carboxymethyl chitosan (MCC) coated carvedilol loaded SLN to protect the rapid release of carvedilol in acidic environment. Positively charged carvedilol loaded SLN were developed using monoglyceride as lipid and soya lecithin and poloxamer 188 as surfactants and stearylamine as charge modifier.

The diagnosis of Brugada syndrome was made by Brugada-type 1 electrocardiogram and the family history of sudden death <45 years. The patient was considered as a high risk, because of pre-syncope and palpitations. He underwent ICD implantation (Medtronic MaximoVR7232Cx) using the standard procedure. After implantation, noninvasive electrophysiology study was done and demonstrated inducible VF that was interrupted with the second 35 JDC shock.

In the present study, we examined the effects of a novel imidazoline agonist S43126 on calcium fluxes and insulin secretion from Min6 \u03b2-cells. We also examined the effects of S43126 on the induction of IRAS, and phosphorylation of components in the I1-imidazoline signaling pathways, namely ERK and PKB. Min6 \u03b2-cells were treated with varying doses of S43126 [10(-8)M to 10(-5)M] for various time (5-60mins). S43126 at higher dose [10(-5)M] stimulated insulin secretion under elevated glucose concentration compared to basal. In addition, insulin secretion and Ca(2+) influx mediated by S43126 [10(-5)M] were decreased following co-treatment with efaroxan (I1-antagonist) and nifedipine (L-type voltage-gated Ca(2+)-channel blocker) at various times (5-60mins). Furthermore, S43126 at [10(-5)M] increased Ca(2+) oscillation, [Ca(2+)] and (45)Ca(2+) uptake in a time and dose-dependent manner. Moreover, Western blot analysis of treated samples showed that S43126 caused an increased protein expression of IRAS as well as phosphorylation of both ERK1/2 and PKB in a concentration-dependent manner. We conclude that S43126 exerts its insulinotropic effect in a glucose dependent manner by a mechanism involving L-type calcium channels and imidazoline I1-receptors.",

    "166": "Positive and negative emotional experiences induced by addictive drugs play an important role in the development of dysfunctional drug-related memory, which becomes resistant to extinction and contributes to high rate of relapse. Those memories may undergo a process called reconsolidation that in some cases can be disrupted by pharmacological treatment. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) has been shown to mediate the reconsolidation of drug-related appetitive memory, but its role in withdrawal-related aversive memory remains elusive. The present study used conditioned place preference (CPP) and conditioned place aversion (CPA) paradigms to investigate the role of BLA and its noradrenergic receptors in reconsolidation of morphine-associated emotional memory in rats. We found that inhibition of protein synthesis in BLA disrupted the reconsolidation of morphine CPP (m-CPP) and CPA related to morphine withdrawal (m-CPA). A high dose of the \u03b2-noradrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol (3 \u00b5g) in BLA-impaired reconsolidation of m-CPA but not m-CPP, whereas a low dose (0.3 \u00b5g) was ineffective. In contrast, neither low nor high doses of the \u03b1-noradrenergic receptor antagonist phentolamine (1 or 10 \u00b5g) blocked the reconsolidation of m-CPP and m-CPA. In addition, infusion of propranolol (3 \u00b5g) into nucleus accumbens after retrieval of either m-CPP or m-CPA did not affect its reconsolidation. The findings indicate that appetitive and aversive addictive memories share common neural substrates in BLA, but the specific neurotransmitter mechanism on reconsolidation of morphine-associated negative and positive memories can be dissociable.", 
    "167": "Excessive fat accumulation in liver (hepatic steatosis) predisposes to hepatic functional and structural impairment and overall metabolic risk. Previous studies noted an association between hepatic steatosis and age in humans and rodents. However, the mechanisms leading to age-associated hepatic fat accumulation remain unknown. Earlier work from our group showed that \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2-AR) levels and \u03b2-AR-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity increase in rat liver during aging. Here we investigated whether age-associated increases in \u03b2-AR signaling play a role in augmenting hepatic lipid accumulation. We demonstrate an increase in hepatic lipid content during senescence and a significant correlation between hepatic fat content and stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity by the \u03b2-AR agonist isoproterenol in rat liver. Isoproterenol administration to young and old rodents in vivo increased hepatic lipid accumulation. Furthermore, in vitro overexpression of \u03b21- and \u03b22-AR subtypes in hepatocytes from young rodents increased cellular lipid content, whereas inhibition of \u03b2-ARs by receptor subtype-specific inhibitors reduced lipid levels in hepatocytes from senescent animals. Isoproterenol-induced hepatic lipid accumulation in vivo was prevented by the \u03b2-AR nonselective blocker propranolol, suggesting a novel therapeutic effect of this class of drugs in hepatic steatosis. Acipimox, which inhibits adipose tissue lipolysis, did not alter isoproterenol-mediated hepatic fat accumulation; thus \u03b2-AR responsive hepatic lipid accumulation does not appear to be related primarily to altered lipolysis. These findings suggest that augmented hepatic \u03b2-AR signaling during aging may increase lipid accumulation in liver and advocate a possible role for \u03b2-adrenergic blockers in preventing or retarding the development of hepatic steatosis.",

    "176": "Endothelial dysfunction is a systemic pathological state of the endothelium characterized by a reduction in the bioavailability of vasodilators, essentially nitric oxide, leading to impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation, as well as disarrangement in vascular wall metabolism and function. One of the key factors in endothelial dysfunction is overproduction of reactive oxygen species which participate in the development of hypertension, atherosclerosis, diabetes, cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and stroke. Because impaired endothelial activity is believed to have a major causal role in the pathophysiology of vascular disease, hypertension, and heart failure, therapeutic agents which modify this condition are of clinical interest. Nebivolol is a third-generation \u03b2-blocker with high selectivity for \u03b21-adrenergic receptors and causes vasodilation by interaction with the endothelial L-arginine/ nitric oxide pathway. This dual mechanism of action underscores several hemodynamic qualities of nebivolol, which include reductions in heart rate and blood pressure and improvements in systolic and diastolic function. Although nebivolol reduces blood pressure to a degree similar to that of conventional \u03b2-blockers and other types of antihypertensive drugs, it may have advantages in populations with difficult-to-treat hypertension, such as patients with heart failure along with other comorbidities, like diabetes and obesity, and elderly patients in whom nitric oxide-mediated endothelial dysfunction may be more pronounced. Furthermore, recent data indicate that nebivolol appears to be a cost-effective treatment for elderly patients with heart failure compared with standard care. Thus, nebivolol is an effective and well tolerated agent with benefits above those of traditional \u03b2-blockers due to its influence on nitric oxide release, which give it singular hemodynamic effects, cardioprotective activity, and a good tolerability profile. This paper reviews the pharmacology structure and properties of nebivolol, focusing on endothelial dysfunction, clinical utility, comparative efficacy, side effects, and quality of life in general with respect to the other antihypertensive agents.",

The aloe gel materials exhibited the ability to statistically significantly reduce the transepithelial electrical resistance of excised rat intestinal tissue but did not significantly increase the transport of atenolol across this in vitro tissue model at the concentrations tested. At least one concentration of each aloe gel material enhanced the transport of FITC-dextran statistically significantly across Caco-2 cell monolayers.

In this study, we propose that bidirectional regulation (BR) on the contractility of jejunal smooth muscle (CJSM) is inducible by emodin in the absence of control by the central nervous system. The results indicated that emodin-induced BR had the following characteristics. A stimulatory effect on CJSM was induced by emodin at 7 low contractile states, and an inhibitory effect was induced on CJSM at 7 high contractile states. Emodin-induced BR on myosin phosphorylation was also observed. BR was not observed in the presence of tetrodotoxin, suggesting that enteric nervous system is required for producing BR. The stimulatory effect of emodin on CJSM was abolished by atropine and diphenhydramine, respectively, suggesting that BR was correlated with cholinergic and histamine system while jejunal smooth muscle was at low contractile state. The inhibitory effect of emodin on CJSM was abolished by phentolamine, propranolol, and L-NG-nitroarginine (L-NNA), respectively, suggesting that BR was related to adrenergic hyperactivity and with a nitric oxide relaxing mechanism while jejunal smooth muscle was in a high contractile state.

In the mammalian heart, \u03b2(1)-AR can exist in 2 distinct activated configurations (the so-called high- and low-affinity states). The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the action of \u03b2(1)-AAB is dependent on the affinity state of \u03b2(1)AR in isolated ventricular cardiomyocytes of adult Wistar rats. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) containing \u03b2(1)-AAB obtained from animals immunized with a peptide corresponding to the EL-2 of human \u03b2(1)-AR, caused a dose-dependent increase in cell shortening. Isoproterenol-induced inotropy was significantly reduced in cardiomyocytes that had been preincubated with IgG containing \u03b2(1)-AAB and in cardiomyocytes isolated from immunized rats. The negative effects of preincubation with IgG containing \u03b2(1)-AAB on the response to isoproterenol was inhibited in the presence of bisoprolol. CGP 12177A and pindolol-induced inotropy was not affected by IgG preincubation or immunization. No detectable inotropic effect of cell shortening was obtained with IgG containing \u03b2(1)-AAB in the presence of propranolol and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. The present study demonstrates that \u03b2(1)-AABs have no agonist/antagonist-like effects upon low-affinity state \u03b2(1)-ARs. This result indicates that \u03b2(1)-AABs recognize and stabilize the high-affinity state, but are unable to stabilize and (or) induce the low-affinity state receptor.",

We sought to determine if targeting NO would improve diastolic function in a model of tissue renin-angiotensin system overactivation. We used the transgenic (TG) (mRen2)27 rat, which overexpresses the murine renin transgene and manifests insulin resistance and left ventricular dysfunction. We treated 6- to 7-wk-old TG (mRen2)27 rats and age-matched Sprague-Dawley control rats with nebivolol (10 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7day(-1)) or placebo via osmotic minipumps for a period of 21 days. Compared with Sprague-Dawley control rats, TG (mRen2)27 rats displayed a prolonged diastolic relaxation time and reduced initial filling rate associated with increased interstitial fibrosis and left ventricular hypertrophy. These findings were temporally related to increased NADPH oxidase activity and subunits p47(phox) and Rac1 and increased total ROS and peroxynitrite formation in parallel with reductions in the antioxidant heme oxygenase as well as the phosphorylation/activation of endothelial NO synthase and PKB/Akt. Treatment with nebivolol restored diastolic function and interstitial fibrosis through increases in the phosphorylation of 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase, Akt, and endothelial NO synthase and reductions in oxidant stress. These results support that targeting NO with nebivolol treatment improves diastolic dysfunction through reducing myocardial oxidative stress by enhancing 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase and Akt activation of NO biosynthesis.",

We then compared the severity of myocardial dysfunction or damage (cardiac enzymes, left ventricular end diastolic pressure, and left ventricular ejection fraction) between patients taking outpatient \u03b2-adrenergic antagonist therapy upon admission vs those who were not. Arrival and peak values for cardiac enzymes were analyzed when available.

However, it has recently been found that \u03b2-arrestins can activate signaling pathways independent of G protein activation. The diversity of these signaling pathways has also been recognized. This leads to an appreciation of \u03b2-arrestin-biased agonists, which is a new class of drugs that selectively activate \u03b2-arrestin-mediated signaling without G protein activation. In this review, we will discuss the recent advance of \u03b2-arrestin-mediated signaling pathways, including a brief account of different biased agonists, their pharmacological applications, and novel \u03b2-arrestin research.",

    "201": "The hypothesis that angiotensin II (Ang II) might have a stroke-protective role was first proposed by Brown and Brown about 25\u00a0years ago. Their hypothesis was generated from the results of the first Medical Research Council trial in patients with mild to moderate hypertension, which showed that patients treated with the diuretic bendrofluazide had a 70% decrease in strokes compared with those treated with the \u03b2-blocker propranolol for similar blood pressure reduction. This hypothesis, which remained dormant for many years, was recently resurrected by several experimental studies that showed that the brain possesses its own renin-angiotensin system (RAS) similar to the one existing in the systemic circulation. These studies also showed that the brain RAS plays an important role in stroke prevention and neuronal protection through its active peptide Ang II. In addition, these studies demonstrated that the beneficial effects of Ang II are mediated through stimulation of its subtype 2 receptors, and possibly through stimulation of the subtype 4 receptors by Ang IV, a metabolite of Ang II. Drugs that selectively block the Ang II subtype 1 receptors, such as the angiotensin receptor blockers, have shown superior protection against strokes and neuronal damage than drugs that decrease the generation of Ang II, such as the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and \u03b2-blockers. In this review, the role of the Ang II receptors and their mechanism of action regarding stroke prevention are discussed in view of the evidence from experimental and clinical studies.",

The effect of these agents on ghrelin production and secretion were examined by comparing vehicle-treated controls (WKY-Intact, SHR-Intact). Treatment with the 4 antihypertensive drugs all yielded a significant decline in systolic BP in both SHR and WKY. Under these conditions, significantly lower levels of stomach and plasma ghrelin were detected in WKY treated with ARB (P<0.05), DZN (P<0.05), MP (P<0.05) and RES (P<0.05) compared with WKY-Intact, whereas no significant change in the ghrelin levels in the stomach and plasma were detected in SHR under the same treatments.",

Males treated with propranolol, fenofibric acid and with mixtures, showed an increase of vitellogenin immunostaining, compared with the control. Males also evidenced a tendency for an increased hepatic mass, after individual and mixture exposures. The volume-weighted nuclear volume of hepatocytes was high in males after exposures to either mixture, which together with the greater cytoplasmic eosinophilia and changes in cytochrome P450 1A immunoreactivity, point to an increase in metabolic/detoxification activity.
