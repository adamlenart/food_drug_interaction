    "0": "Epinephrine increases the oxidation of glucose in adipose tissue even when its lipolytic effects are markedly reduced or abolished by propranolol, nicotinic acid, ouabain, or thyroidectomy. In order to locate the site(s) at which epinephrine stimulates glucose utilization, we studied the effects of epinephrine on the oxidation of various metabolites of glucose. Epinephrine neither increased the production of (14)CO(2) from 1- or 3-(14)C-pyruvate nor affected pyruvate conversion to glyceride-glycerol. To assess the possibility that epinephrine might accelerate the entry of glucose into adipocytes, we studied the accumulation of the nonmetabolized sugar l-arabinose in the intracellular water of adipose tissue. Epinephrine increased arabinose penetration into adipocytes to a degree comparable with that caused by 0.1 mU/ml of insulin. Virtually identical results were obtained in tissues from thyroidectomized rats in which the lipolytic effects of epinephrine were significantly reduced. It is concluded that epinephrine increases glucose oxidation by promoting its entry into adipose tissue and that the effect is independent of lipolysis.", 
    "1": "In isolated thyroid cells I-epinephrine (0.1 and 10.0 micrograms per milliliter), norepinephrine and isoproterenol consistently stimulated the accumulation and organic binding of iodine. The effect was partially inhibited by phentolamine, but not propranolol, and hence may be mediated by alpha receptors. Theophylline did not mimic or enhance the epinephrine effect, suggesting that the latter may not result from activation of adenyl cyclase.", 
    "2": "1. The pattern and control of sweating in one breed of goat and six breeds of sheep have been studied.2. Heat exposure of both sheep and goats resulted in periodic discharges of moisture on to the surface of the skin of the shorn mid-side. The frequency of discharge showed considerable variation between individual animals, varying from less than 1/hr to 14/hr. Approximate counts of the number of active sweat glands suggested that the same glands were involved at each discharge.3. The amount of moisture produced at each discharge declined upon continued heat exposure. The rate of decline was independent of the frequency of discharge.4. Adreno-medullary denervation had no effect on the pattern of sweating in either the sheep or the goat.5. Intravenous adrenaline administration (5 mug/kg body wt.) caused the sweat glands to discharge, but noradrenaline had no effect at the same dose.6. Thermal sweating was inhibited by bethanidine and phenoxybenzamine but not by propranolol. Sweating induced by intravenous adrenaline administration was blocked by phenoxybenzamine but not by bethanidine or propranolol.7. It is concluded that sweating on the mid-side of the sheep and goat is controlled by an adrenergic mechanism, that secretion from the adrenal medulla under conditions of mild heat stress does not stimulate the glands and that sweating is mediated by adrenergic alpha-receptors.", 
    "3": "1. Intramuscular or subcutaneous injections of isoprenaline and dichloroisoprenaline and subcutaneous injection of pronethalol reduced the rates of excretion of water, sodium, potassium and chloride in the urine of conscious, hydrated rats. Inulin excretion usually fell at high, but not at low, dose levels. These changes were attributed to direct stimulant actions on beta-adrenoceptors in the kidney.2. A reduction in perfusion pressure to the kidney may also have contributed to these urinary changes, because isoprenaline produced a transient fall in mean arterial blood pressure when given subcutaneously to anaesthetized rats.3. Intramuscular injection of pronethalol and subcutaneous injection of antidiuretic hormone both reduced the rate of urine flow without modifying other parameters of urinary function (excretion of inulin and electrolytes were not diminished).4. This latter action of pronethalol could not be ascribed to an increased secretion of antidiuretic hormone, for it also occurred in hypophysectomized rats.5. Propranolol increased the renal excretion of sodium and chloride. A small rise in urinary potassium levels also occurred but urine volume and inulin excretion were not modified. Some possible modes of action of propranolol are discussed.", 
    "4": "1. Exposure to cold increased the plasma levels of glucose and lactate in young lambs (< 1-63 days old). Free fatty acid concentrations also increased, the increase being much greater in lambs older than 20 days.2. Intravenous infusions of adrenaline and noradrenaline into lambs under a neutral thermal environment caused large increases in plasma glucose, lactate and free fatty acids.3. Adrenaline and noradrenaline infusions increased the concentration of palmitic, stearic and oleic acids in the plasma of young lambs.4. Treatment of lambs in summit metabolism with either alpha- or beta-adrenergic blocking agents (phentolamine or propranolol, respectively) caused the plasma levels of free fatty acids to fall. Phentolamine hydrochloride decreased the concentration of plasma glucose, but did not change the lactate level. In contrast, propranolol decreased the concentration of both of these metabolites in a significant proportion of the experiments.5. Induction of muscular paralysis by suxamethonium chloride, in lambs exposed to cold, resulted in a rise in plasma free fatty acids, and a fall in glucose and lactate levels.6. These observations suggest that the circulating level of plasma metabolites in young lambs is not the limiting factor in the metabolic response to cold exposure.", 
    "5": "1. Summit metabolism of lambs declined steadily from about 3.5 l. O(2)/kg.hr during the first day of life, to about 2.0 l. O(2)/kg.hr at 2 months of age.2. The contributions of shivering and non-shivering thermogenesis to these changes were estimated by three independent methods; non-shivering thermogenesis was stimulated by catecholamines in a thermoneutral environment, shivering was suppressed by curariform drugs during summit metabolism, and an attempt was made to suppress non-shivering thermogenesis during summit metabolism by use of the sympatholytic drugs phentolamine and propranolol. Drugs were given by intravenous infusion during measurement of oxygen consumption in a closed circuit respiration chamber.3. ;Resting' metabolic rate of lambs during the first day of life was increased two to three-fold, from 1 l. O(2)/kg.hr, by either adrenaline or noradrenaline infused at 1-10 mug/kg.min. The increase declined with increasing age of lamb and was virtually absent by 3 weeks. The response to catecholamines appeared maximal at the dose levels used.4. Muscular paralysis induced by suxamethonium or gallamine reduced summit metabolism by about 2 l. O(2)/kg.hr in all lambs examined within the first 2 months of life. The residual metabolic rate, and the metabolic response to catecholamines under thermoneutral conditions, declined with age in the same manner, and their magnitudes were similar.5. Summit metabolism in lambs aged up to 2 months was depressed to varying degrees by the sympathetic inhibitors phentolamine, propranolol and hexamethonium. The depression with propranolol was greater, and the decline with age clearer, than with phentolamine. Hexamethonium and phentolamine depressed blood pressure, propranolol decreased heart rate and phentolamine and propranolol each suppressed shivering in some experiments.6. In 1 day-old lambs estimates of non-shivering thermogenesis, by the various methods, ranged from 0.8 to 1.4 l. O(2)/kg.hr (mean 1.1 l. or 31% of summit metabolism), and the estimates of shivering ranged from 1.3 to 1.9 l. O(2)/kg.hr (mean 1.6 l. or 46% of summit metabolism). However, in lambs 1-month old, estimates of non-shivering thermogenesis from sympathetic inhibition (0.6 and 0.8 l. O(2)/kg.hr) were considerably higher than estimates from muscular paralysis or stimulation by catecholamines (0.2 and 0.1 l. O(2)/kg.hr). It is suggested that the depression of summit metabolism by the sympathetic inhibitors is not solely due to specific inhibition of non-shivering thermogenesis, at least in the older lambs.7. The possession of a non-shivering thermogenic mechanism in addition to shivering is of clear survival value to new-born lambs.", 
    "6": "1. Nine non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were tested for antagonism of bradykinin-induced bronchoconstriction in guinea-pig lungs in vivo. Only one, benzydamine, was inactive.2. The descending order of potency of the active anti-inflammatory drugs was meclofenamate = Scha 306>Scha 87/2>indoxole>Mi85>indomethacin>glafenine>ibufenac.3. Of eight other drugs tested, chlorpromazine, phenoxybenzamine and four others were inactive, whereas phenelzine and mebanazine possessed activity.4. In tests at two dose-levels of meclofenamate, the dose-ratio of bradykinin increased proportionately with the dose of meclofenamate.5. The anti-bradykinin effect of meclofenamate was still observed after destruction of the brain and spinal cord, after bilateral adrenalectomy or after blockade of beta-receptors for adrenaline.6. Meclofenamate did not release catecholamines from the adrenal medulla or prevent such a release by bradykinin given intra-arterially.7. The fenamates and like-acting drugs reduced the intensity of anaphylactic bronchoconstriction in guinea-pigs treated with mepyramine or propranolol. The descending order of potency was meclofenamate>flufenamate>mefenamate.8. Dose / response curves for the antagonism of anaphylactic bronchoconstriction by the fenamates, in the presence of propranolol, turned downwards at high doses.9. These findings suggest that the fenamates may find a useful place in the treatment of bronchial asthma or other conditions involving allergic ventilatory impairment.", 
    "7": "1. A comparison of some cardiovascular effects of propranolol, MJ 1999 and quinidine has been made in rats and dogs.2. After intravenous, subcutaneous or oral administration to rats and dogs, propranolol was found to be 2-4 times more potent than MJ 1999 in blocking the chronotropic and vasodepressor responses to intravenously administered isoprenaline.3. Propranolol and quinidine affected the e.c.g. of rats and dogs in a similar manner.4. At dose-levels causing effective blockade of beta-receptors propranolol and MJ 1999 had no hypotensive effect after short- or long-term administration to conscious hypertensive rats and dogs.5. At very high dose-levels propranolol and quinidine, but not MJ 1999, lowered blood pressure in the hypertensive rat. This effect of propranolol is probably related to one or more of the properties that propranolol and quinidine have in common rather than to a blockade of beta-receptors.6. The possible relevance of these results to the use of propranolol as a hypotensive agent in man is discussed.", 
    "8": "1. The intravenous infusion of I.C.I. 50172 in doses up to 20 mg reduced, although not significantly, the increase in heart rate produced by the infusion of isoprenaline in healthy volunteers; the response to adrenaline was significantly reduced. The infusion of 1 mg propranolol abolished these responses2. After the pre-treatment of subjects with atropine or hexamethonium, I.C.I. 50172 produced a significant reduction in an isoprenaline tachycardia. This reduction was not competitive and did not exceed 50%.3. The intravenous injection of 4 mg I.C.I. 50172 reduced an exercise tachycardia; its effect was less than that of 4 mg propranolol. This difference became greater as the doses of the two drugs were increased. The dextro isomer of propranolol had no effect on the exercise tachycardia; I.C.I. 45763 reduced it to the same extent as propranolol.4. The intravenous injection of I.C.I. 50172 reduced the increase in heart rate produced by tilting a normal subject from the supine to 80 degrees head-up position. After the administration of atropine, I.C.I. 50172 almost abolished the response. In the presence of atropine, I.C.I. 50172 was as active as propranolol in reducing the increase in heart rate on tilting.5. The reason for the differences in the effects of I.C.I. 50172 on the increases in heart rate brought about by the three procedures is not clear.6. The increase in forearm blood flow produced by the infusion of isoprenaline into the brachial artery was not reduced by the intra-arterial administration of I.C.I. 50172.", 
    "9": "1. The effect on coronary vascular resistance of selective stimulation of the Adelta, B and sC fibre groups of the post-ganglionic cardiac sympathetic nerves was studied. The main left coronary artery was perfused at constant flow. The oxygen saturation of coronary sinus blood was measured continuously.2. Stimulation of the peripheral ends of the cut Adelta afferent fibres, normally excited by myocardial ischaemia, had no effect on coronary vascular resistance; these fibres do not evoke an axon reflex in the heart.3. Stimulation of the preganglionic B fibres that run without synapse through the stellate ganglion also had no measurable effect on coronary resistance.4. Stimulation of the post-ganglionic sC fibres of the cardiac sympathetic nerves caused coronary vasodilatation which occurred earlier than, and was initially independent of the decrease in coronary sinus oxygen saturation.5. The injection of noradrenaline into the perfusion system had the same effect as stimulation of the sC fibres. In the K(+)-arrested heart, both noradrenaline and stimulation of the post-ganglionic nerves elicited coronary vasodilatation without changing the oxygen saturation of coronary sinus blood.6. The intracoronary injection of acetylcholine caused coronary vasodilatation followed by an increase of coronary sinus oxygen saturation.7. Vagal stimulation caused brady cardia and a fall in coronary resistance.8. Propranolol blocked coronary vasodilatation elicited by sympathetic stimulation or noradrenaline without affecting the vasodilatation due to myocardial ischaemia or acetylcholine. Atropine blocked coronary vasodilatation evoked by acetylcholine without affecting that due to ischaemia or noradrenaline. Therefore smooth muscle of the coronary arteries has at least three different receptor sites from which vasodilatation can be elicited.9. Hypertensin caused coronary vasoconstriction.10. The presence of sympathetic cholinergic vasodilator fibres innervating the coronary arteries could not be demonstrated."
