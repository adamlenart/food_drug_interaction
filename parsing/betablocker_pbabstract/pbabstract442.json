    "0": "Raynaud's phenomenon is a common, paroxysmal acrosyndrome, affecting about 4% of the general population. Most of the time it is a purely functional condition: Raynaud's disease. However, in rare cases, there is an organic cause and it is then known as Raynaud's phenomenon. In view of its prevalence, a simple, atraumatic, low cost and reliable work-up should be performed to guide diagnosis. This is based on the findings of clinical examination, capillaroscopy, antinuclear factor antibody tests and X ray of chest and hands. Only a few cases will require more specialised investigation with arteriography and autoimmune studies. The commonest causes are arterial and connective tissue diseases, especially scleroderma. However, occupational hazards, toxic and iatrogenic drug-induced aetiologies should not be overlooked. With the exception of patients who have a curable underlying disease, most cases require vasodilator therapy, the keystone of which over the last decade has been the calcium channel blockers. Only patients who are severely handicapped by their acrosyndrome should be given drug therapy.", 
    "1": "In the present study, four doses (50, 100, 200 or 500 ng per animal) of rat atrial natriuretic peptide (rANP1-28) were tested on the open-field activity of rats following i.c.v. application of the peptide. ANP in doses of 200 ng or 500 ng/rat significantly increased the ambulation activity 15 min after the treatment. However, the effect was transitory; 30 min after application it was no longer observed. When the experimental animals were pretreated with different receptor blockers in doses which per se could not affect the behavioral paradigm, the effect of ANP was completely blocked by haloperidol (a dopaminergic blocking agent), phenoxybenzamine (an alpha-adrenergic blocker) and propranolol (a beta-adrenergic blocker). Atropine, naloxone, bicuculline and methysergide were ineffective. These results suggest that dopaminergic and adrenergic transmitter systems are involved in the ANP-induced locomotor activity of rats.", 
    "2": "Clinical usefulness of the alpha 1-blocker and beta-stimulant combined therapy for idiopathic male infertility has already been reported by Yamamoto et al. But the same trial followed by us revealed only a slight effectiveness and substantial adverse effects due to beta-stimulation. The mechanism of the alpha 1-blocker and beta-stimulant combined therapy is not yet established. In order to investigate its mechanism, fundamental study of alpha 1-receptor assay in the specimens of testis and various parts of male accessory sex organs obtained at the time of operation was done in this study. In addition the usefulness of alpha 1-blocker therapy for idiopathic male infertility was also examined clinically. The tissues used in this study were obtained from patients with prostatic cancer (23 cases), benign prostatic hyperplasia (24 cases), bladder cancer (6 cases), chronic epididymitis (3 cases), azoospermia due to disorders of vas deferens (5 cases) and a vasectomized man. Tritium labeled bunazosin was used as the ligand. The crude membrane fraction was extracted from the sample, with or without phentolamine incubated for 20 min at 37 degrees C. Maximal binding sites (Bmax) and the dissociation constant (Kd) were obtained by Scatchard plot analysis. Twenty-two infertile men were treated by oral administration of alpha 1-blocker (bunazosin, 3 mg/day) for 24 weeks. The results were as follows: 1) Bmax in the testis, epididymis, vas deferens and prostate, expressed as fmol, per mg. protein, was 2.27 +/- 1.74, 16.62 +/- 6.19, 29.44 +/- 17.81, 27.77 +/- 12.0, respectively (mean +/- S.D.). 2) Bmax in the rete testis was relatively high among various parts of the testis and seminiferous tubules. 3) Overall effective rates of sperm density and the sperm motility were noted in 36% at 12 weeks and 60% at 24 weeks after the therapy. 4) There was no clinical effect in patients with azoospermia and a slight effectiveness in patients with elevated plasma gonadotropin levels. 5) Adverse effect was reduced to 9.1%. These results suggest that the alpha 1-blocker therapy for idiopathic male infertility is clinically useful and that the mechanism of the therapy is through the action on male accessory sex organs behind the testis.", 
    "3": "Serum TSH and free T4 were determined by chemiluminometric assays in 601 women and 285 men aged 85 years from the population study \"70-year-old people in Gothenburg, Sweden\". For individuals with serum TSH concentration above 6.0 mU/l, \"antimicrosomal\" antibodies were determined, to assess the etiology of the elevated TSH concentration. Clinical follow-up was done of survivors until the age of 88, and records were inspected also for individuals who died before that age. On the basis of these evaluations the prevalence of previously undetected hypothyroidism was estimated to 4.0% in women and 2.5% in men. Previously undetected hyperthyroidism was found in 2, at the most 4, out of 601 women; in one out of 285 men the diagnosis could not be excluded. Possible confounding factors for the evaluation of TSH and/or free T4 concentrations were analysed by permutation t-test followed by multiple regression analysis, which revealed correlations of log TSH concentration to body mass index (p less than 0.05), serum creatinine concentration (p less than 0.05), and diabetes mellitus (inverse relationship, p less than 0.01). Correlation was found of free T4 concentration to treatment with non-selective beta-blocking agents (p less than 0.001) and digitalis glycosides (p less than 0.01). However, none of the factors influencing TSH and/or free T4 concentrations had any major influence on reference limits, nor could they account for individuals with \"out-lier\" values.", 
    "4": "This study was undertaken to investigate the correlation between hypoxic cell injury and protease activity, as well as the effects of alpha 1-, and beta-adrenergic blocking agents and calcium antagonists during hypoxia. Cell death during hypoxia rose to 80% after 6h. Calpain activity increased to 4 units during hypoxia, much higher than the 0.7 units seen in aerobic condition at 6h. This activity was markedly inhibited by calpain-specific inhibitor I (n-acetyl-leucyle-leucyle-norleucinal). alpha 1-adrenergic blocking agents did not affect calpain activity and cell death under hypoxia. On the other hand, beta-adrenergic blocking agents and calcium antagonists suppressed the calpain activity and decreased cell death during hypoxia. These beta-adrenergic blocking agents and calcium antagonists also inhibited intracellular calcium-influx during hypoxia. These results suggest the beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation activates adenylate cyclase activity and enhances calcium-influx during hypoxia. The elevated intracellular calcium concentration then stimulates calpain activity under hypoxia. These results prove that beta-adrenergic blocking agents and calcium antagonists prevent protein degradation during hypoxic cell injury.", 
    "5": "1. Abanoquil (UK 52,046) is a novel, quinoline-derivative, alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist which, on the basis of animal studies, possesses antiarrhythmic activity at doses which have little or no effect on blood pressure. 2. In two placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover studies the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist activity (phenylephrine pressor responses) and the effects on blood pressure and heart rate (in the presence and absence of concomitant beta-adrenoceptor blockade) have been investigated in healthy, normotensive subjects following the intravenous administration (i.v.) of abanoquil. 3. In the first study, abanoquil at a dose of 0.4 micrograms kg-1 i.v. (as a bolus or by increments) produced significant alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonism (with rightward shifts of more than two-fold in the phenylephrine pressor dose-response curves) but no significant effects on supine or erect blood pressure and heart rate. 4. In the second study, a dose of 0.5 micrograms kg-1 i.v. had no significant effect on supine or erect blood pressure but pre-treatment with atenolol promoted a small fall in erect blood pressure without causing significant orthostatic hypotension. 5. In conclusion, significant alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonism without marked reflex tachycardia or profound postural hypotension suggest that abanoquil has a different haemodynamic profile from that of 'classical' peripheral alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists.", 
    "6": "Calcium antagonists are now recommended as monotherapy for the treatment of mild to moderate essential hypertension by the Joint National Committee (JNC) on the Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure. Based on a statement in the 1988 JNC report that black and elderly patients tend to respond better to calcium antagonists, we reviewed the literature to examine the predictive value of age and race to the antihypertensive response of calcium antagonists. The majority of studies we reviewed failed to substantiate the JNC statement and well-promulgated reports in the literature suggesting preferential action of calcium antagonists in the elderly, or their superiority when compared with diuretics, beta-adrenergic blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Although not noted by the JNC, pretreatment blood pressure appeared to be an important predictor of the antihypertensive response to calcium antagonists. The literature reviewed indicates that calcium antagonists have comparable efficacy in black and white hypertensive patients. However, the limited comparative studies reviewed support the JNC statement that, as with diuretics, blacks have a greater antihypertensive response with calcium antagonists than with beta-adrenergic blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "7": "Thirty-four patients with essential hypertension at WHO stage I or II were divided into three groups. Group I consisted of 22 cases who displayed normal renin activity (NR) or low renin activity (LR) and who received a single administration of captopril. Group II consisted of 6 cases given beta-blockers after administration of captopril. Group III consisted of 6 cases in whom beta-blocker was replaced with thiazide diuretics after administration of captopril alone. Blood pressure decreased significantly by captopril treatment alone in group I of the NR and LR subgroups (except for the diastolic blood pressure [DBP] of the NR subgroup) and fell below the target blood pressure (SBP of 165 mmHg and DBP of 95 mmHg) in 86% of the NR subgroup and 73% of the LR subgroup. Combined treatment with captopril and beta-blocker in Group II did not decrease blood pressure any lower than with captopril alone treatment and achieved the target blood pressure in only 50% of the patients. In group III, combined treatment with captopril and thiazide achieved the target blood pressure in 100% of the patients. Plasma renin activity (PRA) was increased by captopril but reduced by captopril in combination with beta-blocker. However, when beta-blocker was replaced with thiazide, PRA increased. The serum sodium concentration was significantly reduced in the LR subgroup after a single administration of captopril, but there was no other variation.", 
    "8": "To assess the influence of adrenergic modulation on preoperative anxiety, we used a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to compare temazepam, clonidine, and timolol as preanesthetic medications in patients undergoing minor orthopedic surgery. All the active treatments resulted in less preoperative anxiety than the placebo (control) did. Induction of anesthesia was smoother in all the treated patients compared with the control group. Recovery was slowest in the temazepam and clonidine groups, but there were no significant differences between the groups after 90 min. Cardiovascular changes were most marked in the timolol group. Pain scores were lower in the temazepam and clonidine series in the early postoperative period. Neither clonidine nor timolol offers any major advantage over temazepam for premedication in these patients.", 
    "9": "In 97 outpatients undergoing ambulatory arthroscopic procedures, we compared esmolol with alfentanil when used to supplement propofol-N2O-atracurium anesthesia according to a randomized, double-blind protocol. After an initial intravenous dose of 16 micrograms/kg alfentanil, or 2 mg/kg of esmolol, a variable-rate infusion of alfentanil or esmolol was administered to maintain a stable heart rate. After induction of anesthesia with 2.5 mg/kg of propofol, mean arterial pressure decreased to a larger extent in the alfentanil-treated patients. Although heart rate and mean arterial pressure increased in both groups after tracheal intubation, alfentanil more effectively blunted the hemodynamic response to this stimulus. Maintenance of anesthesia was adequate in both treatment groups. After discontinuation of anesthesia, patients in the esmolol group opened their eyes earlier (7.2 +/- 2.4 min vs 9.8 +/- 4.6 min) than those in the alfentanil group. Esmolol-treated patients also reported less sedation in the first 15 min of recovery than those receiving alfentanil. However, there were no differences in times to ambulation and discharge between the groups. Esmolol-treated patients reported more postoperative pain for the first 15 min of recovery and more esmolol-treated patients required postoperative opioid analgesia than those treated with alfentanil. There were no significant differences in the incidences of nausea and vomiting between the two groups. The authors conclude that esmolol may be used in place of alfentanil to supplement propofol-N2O-atracurium anesthesia in outpatients undergoing arthroscopic procedures. However, hemodynamic responses to tracheal intubation were larger with esmolol, and avoidance of alfentanil did not decrease the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting in this outpatient population.", 
    "10": "The augmentation of cardiac inotropism induced by electrical stimulation of acutely decentralized efferent preganglionic sympathetic axons is reduced after the administration of timolol into the major ipsilateral intrathoracic ganglia. Thus it has been proposed that, in addition to nicotinic synapses, beta-adrenergic ones exist in intrathoracic ganglia that are involved in the efferent sympathetic regulation of the mammalian heart. Whether these are beta 1- as opposed to beta 2-adrenoceptor subtypes is unknown. In the present series of experiments, acutely decentralized canine efferent preganglionic sympathetic axons were stimulated before and after the administration of beta 1 (atenolol)- or beta 2 (ICI 118551)-selective adrenoceptor antagonists into the ipsilateral stellate and middle cervical ganglia to determine whether beta 1- or beta 2-adrenoceptors exist in intrathoracic ganglia that are involved in cardiac regulation. Augmentations of right and left ventricular inotropism induced by efferent preganglionic sympathetic axon stimulation were attenuated when either agent was administered into the major ipsilateral intrathoracic sympathetic ganglia. Myocardial liberation of norepinephrine evoked by these stimulations was also reduced after intraganglionic administration of either agent. These data indicate that canine intrathoracic neurons contain beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors that are involved in the efferent sympathetic regulation of the heart.", 
    "11": "The effect of beta-adrenergic agonists on splanchnic intravascular volume (SIV), measured with radionuclide imaging, and the subsequent influence of such volume changes on cardiac output (CO) were examined in 40 anesthetized dogs. Isoproterenol (6 micrograms/min) caused a decrease in total SIV of 12 +/- 1% (P less than 0.001). The decrease was due entirely to a decrease in splenic volume of 24 +/- 3% (P less than 0.001), since volume increased in the remainder of the splanchnic vasculature [hepatic and mesenteric volume increased 12 +/- 2% (P less than 0.001) and 11 +/- 3% (P less than 0.02), respectively]. CO increased from 1,724 +/- 187 to 3,138 +/- 321 ml/min (P less than 0.001); after subsequent splenectomy, isoproterenol caused a similar increment. Isoproterenol-associated SIV changes were not altered by carotid denervation and vagotomy or by beta 1-adrenergic inhibition with metoprolol but were abolished by nonselective beta-adrenergic inhibition with propranolol. With a larger dose of metoprolol and smaller dose of isoproterenol to minimize beta 1-adrenergic effects, the isoproterenol-associated CO increment was attenuated (P less than 0.01) by splenectomy. With the beta 2-agonist terbutaline (41 micrograms/min) after metoprolol, total SIV decreased 15 +/- 4% (P less than 0.001). After subsequent alpha-adrenergic inhibition with phenoxybenzamine, terbutaline caused no change in SIV and an attenuated (P less than 0.05) increase in CO. Thus beta-adrenergic agonist administration causes a decrease in total SIV due entirely to a decrease in splenic volume. The SIV decrement is dependent on beta 2- and alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation and appears to enhance CO only if beta 1-adrenergic effects are minimized.", 
    "12": "Therapy for acute myocardial infarction has its most compelling effect when the patient is seen early in the course of illness. In this article, the authors discuss the status of nonlytic medications during the acute phase of Q-wave infarction and also examine the role of risk modification and stratification in long-term survival of the patient.", 
    "13": "In rat ventricular myocytes, the effects of alpha adrenoceptor stimulation on outward currents were studied by means of the whole cell voltage-clamp technique. Phenylephrine (30 microM) in the presence of propranolol (1 microM) to block beta adrenoceptors reduced voltage-activated transient outward current. Both components of transient outward current were affected, i.e., peak current (Ipeak) was reduced by 25.3 +/- 1.8%, the outward current at the end of a clamp step (Ilate) was reduced by 39.1 +/- 3.5% (n = 5; holding potential -40 mV, clamp step to +20 mV). In order to describe the alpha-1 adrenoceptor subtypes involved in this action, the effect of phenylephrine was also investigated after pretreatment of the cells with various antagonists. Pretreatment with prazosin (0.3 microM) abolished completely the phenylephrine effect. The alpha-1A adrenoceptor subtype-selective antagonists 5-methylurapidil and (+)-niguldipine (0.1 microM each) and the irreversible alpha-1B adrenoceptor subtype antagonist chloroethyl-clonidine (100 microM) blocked the phenylephrine effect on Ipeak, but merely attenuated the effect on Ilate, whereas pretreatment with a combination of chloroethylclonidine and (+)-niguldipine suppressed the phenylephrine-induced effect on both outward current components just like prazosin did. In conclusion, stimulation of both adrenoceptor subtypes is required for reduction of Ipeak, but stimulation of either alpha-1A or alpha-1B subtype is sufficient for reduction of Ilate. Therefore, stimulation of both alpha-1 adrenoceptor subtypes contributes to the phenylephrine-induced reduction in transient outward currents of isolated rat myocytes.", 
    "14": "To evaluate consequences of cardiac beta-2 adrenoceptor stimulation on coronary hemodynamics and regional myocardial function assessed by sonomicrometry in the normal and regionally ischemic heart, the effects of administration of procaterol, a selective beta-2 adrenoceptor agonist, into the left circumflex coronary artery (LCX) were examined in the absence and presence of a stenosis of the LCX in anesthetized open-chest dogs. The stenosis of the LCX was made sufficient to decrease percent segment shortening in the LCX-perfused region to around 2 to 3%. When coronary stenosis was absent, intracoronary infusion of procaterol (6.7 ng/min for 15 min) produced significant increases in LCX flow and myocardial segment shortening in the infused region without changes in global hemodynamics. During coronary stenosis, on the contrary, intracoronary procaterol at the same dose significantly deteriorated regional myocardial dysfunction without changing LCX flow, global hemodynamics and cardiac lactate metabolism. These changes induced by procaterol were not observed in the dogs treated with a selective beta-2 antagonist, erythro-(+/-)-1-(7-methylindan-4-yloxy)-3-isopropylaminob utan-2-ol. These results suggest the presence of functional beta-2 adrenoceptors in the canine heart both with and without myocardial ischemia.", 
    "15": "Depression is a potential side effect of antihypertensive drug therapy. Consideration of this side effect is a reason often cited by physicians for not choosing certain drugs.", 
    "16": "In this prospective study the relative rates of depression were measured by the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) in patients from four hypertension treatment groups. Treatment groups consisted of 466 patients receiving: (1) no drug therapy, (2) diuretics only, (3) diuretics plus reserpine, and (4) diuretics plus beta-blockers. Demographic data including age, sex, and race were collected. Analysis of variance was used to compare the rate of depression among the treatment groups, as well as among age, sex, and racial groups.", 
    "17": "Using a Zung SDS index of greater than or equal to 50, 35.4% of the hypertensive population was depressed. Age and sex were not significant factors in the frequency of depression. Blacks scored higher than whites in all drug treatment groups except those treated with high lipophilic beta-blockers, but the rate of depression was not higher. Whites on the lowest dose of reserpine had the lowest rate of depression. The rate of depression among those taking reserpine or beta-blockers was no different than that among those receiving either no treatment or diuretics.", 
    "18": "Reserpine or beta-blocker therapy did not cause any more depression than any other antihypertensive treatment.", 
    "19": "Spontaneously diabetic BB/W rats were compared with age-matched regular Wistar and nondiabetic BB/W rats to determine whether the presence of diabetes would alter cardiovascular regulation appreciably. Systolic and mean blood pressures measured with the tail-cuff method from 12 to 26 wk of age tended to be slightly higher in diabetic than nondiabetic BB/W rats, but the differences were not significant. Mean pressures recorded from indwelling catheters in the same rats at 28 wk of age also did not differ significantly, thereby verifying that the diabetic rats were not hypertensive. To measure baroreflex sensitivity, heart-rate responses were elicited reflexly by elevating blood pressure with phenylephrine or lowering it with sodium nitroprusside. Although reflex bradycardia elicited with phenylephrine was the same, reflex tachycardia elicited with sodium nitroprusside was more pronounced in diabetic BB/W than other rats. Underlying autonomic mechanisms were then assessed by repeating the baroreflex tests after either cholinergic blockade with methylatropine or beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol. Magnitude of reflex bradycardia after inhibition by either cholinergic or beta-adrenergic blockade still did not differ between rat groups but that of reflex tachycardia remained significantly stronger in diabetic BB/W than other rats. These results collectively show that, although diabetic BB/W rats remained normotensive, they had enhanced reflex tachycardia that persisted even after efferent autonomic blockade. The failure to develop higher pressures with time further indicates that without additional manipulation, these rats cannot be used experimentally to simulate the simultaneous presence of hypertension in diabetic patients.", 
    "20": "In diabetic rats, intestinal mucin secretion is unusually high compared with that in normal rats. These studies demonstrate that mucin synthesis is also increased in the diabetic intestine. alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonists or antagonists did not affect mucin output in either normal or diabetic animals, suggesting that altered release in diabetes was not due to goblet cells responding abnormally to adrenergic agents. The cholinergic agonist bethanechol caused a dose-dependent and atropine-sensitive increase in mucin secretion from the normal intestine but had no effect on mucin release from diabetic tissue. Atropine alone did not reduce mucin secretion from the diabetic intestine to levels found in normal tissue. Cholera toxin caused an approximately fivefold increase in mucin output from normal rats but had no effect on mucin secretion from diabetic animals. Thus, goblet cell responses to cholinergic stimulation and cholera toxin in the diabetic intestine are markedly impaired. However, loss of cholinergic control does not appear to be responsible for altered baseline mucin secretion in diabetes.", 
    "21": "To assess the effects of acute cardioselective beta blockade on ventilatory function in patients with COPD and active cardiac disorders, 50 patients were studied during intravenous infusion of esmolol. All patients had an obstructive ventilatory component on baseline pulmonary function testing, and 58 percent had a significant bronchodilator response to inhaled albuterol. Esmolol infusion (8 to 24 mg/min) produced large decreases in heart rate (84 +/- 2 to 69 +/- 2 beats/min, p less than 0.01) and SBP (124 +/- 3 to 106 +/- 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.01). Despite this marked hemodynamic response, there was no significant group effect of beta blockade on pulmonary function. No patient experienced dyspnea or wheezing with acute esmolol infusion; however, three patients (6 percent) developed asymptomatic decreases of FEV1. It is concluded that acute beta blockade with esmolol can be achieved in patients with COPD and cardiac disorders with little risk of bronchospasm.", 
    "22": "This meta-analysis was performed to determine the efficacy of digoxin, verapamil, and beta-adrenoceptor blockers as prophylaxis against supraventricular arrhythmias (SVAs) after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). Randomized control trials were included if the electrocardiographic monitoring technique was clearly defined and extended through at least the first 3 postoperative days. Twenty-four of 69 identified studies were included in the final analysis. A summary odds ratio (OR) of the likelihood of developing SVAs after CABG in the treatment versus control groups was calculated. The pooled mean ventricular rate during SVA in patients who developed such an arrhythmia was also calculated. Neither digoxin nor verapamil reduced the likelihood of SVAs after CABG (digoxin: OR = 0.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.62-1.49; verapamil: OR = 0.91, CI = 0.57-1.46). The likelihood of developing an SVA in patients treated with beta-blockers was markedly decreased compared with controls (OR = 0.28, CI = 0.21-0.36). The pooled ventricular rate when SVAs did occur was significantly lower in each of the treatment groups. Prophylactic beta-adrenoceptor blockers had a protective effect against the development of SVAs in a select population of patients undergoing CABG. No such beneficial effect was demonstrated for digoxin or verapamil. All three classes of agents reduced the ventricular rate in patients who developed the arrhythmia, although the ventricular rate reduction was not clinically optimal.", 
    "23": "Repeated administration of electroconvulsive shock (ECS) increases [3H]prazosin binding to alpha 1-adrenoceptors in rat cerebral cortex. In contrast, [3H]WB4101 binding in cortex has been reported to be unchanged after ECS. [3H]Prazosin labels two alpha 1-adrenoceptor subtypes, termed alpha 1a and alpha 1b, whereas [3H]WB4101 labels the alpha 1a subtype preferentially. The purpose of this study was to determine whether ECS increases one or both alpha 1-adrenoceptor subtypes in rat cerebral cortex. We found that treatment of rats with ECS once daily for 10-12 days increased [3H]prazosin binding in cortex by about 25% but did not significantly alter [3H]WB4101 binding to alpha 1-adrenoceptors. Measurement of alpha 1a and alpha 1b receptors by competition analysis of the selective alpha 1a antagonist 5-methylurapidil against [3H]prazosin and measurement of [3H]prazosin binding in homogenates preincubated with chlorethylclonidine, which alkylates alpha 1b binding sites, also indicated that the ECS-induced increase in alpha 1-adrenoceptors is confined to the alpha 1b subtype. In contrast to its effect on [3H]prazosin binding, ECS did not increase phosphoinositide hydrolysis as measured by [3H]inositol 1-phosphate accumulation in slices of rat cerebral cortex stimulated by either norepinephrine or phenylephrine. The failure of ECS to increase [3H]inositol 1-phosphate accumulation stimulated by phenylephrine, which is a partial agonist for this response, suggests that spare receptors do not account for the apparent absence of effect of ECS on alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis.", 
    "24": "The influence of cardioselective beta-blockers, practolol and atenolol, on acid phosphatase, acid deoxyribonuclease, cathepsin D, beta-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase activities was studied in homogenates of intact rat ventricular myocardium. In the presence of drugs (1 x 10(-9)-1 x 10(-5) M) the activities of acid phosphatase, cathepsin D, beta-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase tended to diminish but the activity of acid deoxyribonuclease tended to increase. Some differences in the influence of drugs on the enzyme activities were removed by prolongation of preincubation of homogenates with drugs. It is supposed that the mechanism of influence of beta-blockers on lysosomes of the intact rat ventricular myocardium in conditions of this study includes the specific drug binding to beta-adrenergic receptors situated on lysosomes.", 
    "25": "Ontogenesis of alpha 2- and beta-adrenoreceptors in brain cortex of rats after corticosterone injections to their mothers on days 16 and 18 days of gestation was studied using 3H-clonidine and 3H-dihydroaoprenolol binding. After corticosterone treatment the level of beta-adrenoreceptors was decreased on day 7 but increased on day 16 after birth; On the contrary, catecholamine levels and biosynthesis determined previously were increased in the first and decreased in the second age group. beta-adrenoreceptors' density and noradrenaline level during other periods of pre- and postnatal development remained unchanged. Corticosterone treatment inhibited the increase of alpha 2-adrenoreceptor density during ontogenesis. The decrease of the alpha 2-adrenoreceptors was most significant in 35- and 70-day old rates. The hormone had no effect on the adrenoreceptors' affinity to ligands. Injections of the solvent to the pregnant females which is weak stressor increasing corticosteroids levels in the blood, had a similar but less prominent effect on the ontogenesis of adrenoreceptors in the offspring brain. Thus, the effect of corticosterone on the ontogenesis of the beta-adrenoreceptors is probably associated with changes of the neurotransmitter level, and its effect on alpha 2-adrenoreceptors involves some unknown specific hormone-dependent regulator.", 
    "26": "The role of the autonomic nervous system in the glucagon response to hypoglycemia has not been fully clarified. We have studied the effect of total pharmacological blockade of the autonomic nervous system (concomitant alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade with simultaneous atropine injection) and of isolated alpha-adrenergic blockade on hormonal responses to hypoglycemia and on blood glucose recovery after hypoglycemia in healthy subjects. Neither of the pharmacological blockades had any significant effects on plasma glucagon responses to hypoglycemia nor had they any effect on the rate of blood glucose recovery after hypoglycemia. We conclude that the autonomic nervous system has no major influence on the glucagon response to hypoglycemia in healthy man. Changes in autonomic nervous activity are not essential for blood glucose recovery after hypoglycemia in healthy man.", 
    "27": "Beta-adrenoceptor blockade can influence exercise capacity negatively, but data on the effect of converting enzyme inhibition and of calcium entry blockade on exercise capacity in hypertensive sportsmen are scarce. This report deals with the effect of the various types of antihypertensive medication on endurance exercise capacity in 14 hypertensive sportsmen, aged 39 +/- 3 years and weighing 73 +/- 2 kg (mean +/- s.e.m.). The patients were treated for 3 weeks with either placebo, atenolol (50 mg/day) enalapril (10 mg/day) or verapamil (240 mg/day) following a double-blind randomized cross-over design. At the end of each treatment period, they performed an endurance exercise test on the bicycle until exhaustion at 70% of their previously determined exercise capacity. Venous blood was sampled before and after exercise. In comparison with placebo, total exercise duration was not affected by enalapril (-3 +/- 7%) or verapamil (-7 +/- 11%). During treatment with atenolol, two patients had to interrupt their intake of the beta-blocker because of side effects. In the 12 remaining subjects, exercise duration was significantly decreased by 38 +/- 12% (P less than 0.01). Atenolol also induced decreases in plasma-free fatty acid concentration before and after exercise and an increase in potassium concentration after exercise, whereas enalapril and verapamil did not induce metabolic changes. During exercise, systolic blood pressure was decreased by atenolol (P less than 0.001) and enalapril (P less than 0.01) and diastolic blood pressure by enalapril (P less than 0.001), verapamil (P less than 0.05) and atenolol(P = 0.06).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "28": "Various beta-blockers possessing similar antihypertensive potency have been found to differ widely with regard to their influence on blood pressure-regulating factors such as cardiac output and plasma levels of renin or norepinephrine. Recently, beta-blocker-induced stimulation of circulating atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) was reported. Blood pressure is determined not only by levels of vasoconstrictive factors but also by tissue reactivity. To investigate these aspects, we assessed the cardiovascular responsiveness to norepinephrine and angiotensin II, plasma levels of catecholamines, angiotensin II, ANF and aldosterone and the body sodium-blood volume state of 15 patients with essential hypertension (mean age +/- s.e.m., 42 +/- 3 years) and 12 normal control subjects (41 +/- 5 years), first on placebo and then after 4 weeks of intervention with carteolol, a non-selective beta-adrenergic antagonist with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Compared with placebo, carteolol decreased resting plasma norepinephrine in both groups while plasma norepinephrine-blood pressure response curves were shifted to the left, their slopes increased and norepinephrine pressor doses decreased (P less than 0.05 to less than 0.001). Chronotropic responses to isoproterenol were abolished but negative chronotropic responses to a norepinephrine-induced 20 mmHg rise in diastolic blood pressure were unaltered. Plasma norepinephrine clearance in the supine position was slightly decreased in hypertensive and unchanged in normal subjects. Supine and upright blood pressure was lowered (P less than 0.05 to 0.001) in the hypertensive while upright systolic blood pressure only decreased in the normal group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "29": "The pharmacological profile and the anatomical localization of beta-adrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic receptors of the vasa nervorum were studied in sections of sciatic nerve using radioreceptor binding and light microscope autoradiography techniques. Sprague-Dawley rats of 4 and 24 months of age were used. [3H]Dihydroalprenolol (DHA) and [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) were used to label beta-adrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic receptors, respectively. The ligands were bound to sections of rat sciatic nerve in a manner consistent with the labelling of beta-adrenergic or muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the 2 age groups investigated. The dissociation constant (Kd) values (about 1.37 nM for [3H]DHA and 0.75 nM for [3H]QNB) did not significantly change between 4- and 24-month-old rats. The maximum concentration of binding sites (Bmax) for [3H]DHA was decreased by about 35% in 24 in comparison with 4-month-old rats. The Bmax value for [3H]QNB was reduced by about 50% in the aged rats. Light microscope autoradiography revealed the development of specific silver grains in the medial layer of epineurial and perineurial arteries in sections of sciatic nerve exposed either to [3H]DHA or [3H]QNB. The number of silver grains developed in epineurial and perineurial arteries of rats of 24 months is significantly lower than in animals of 4 months. The above results suggest the occurrence of an age-dependent loss in the density of beta-adrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic receptors of vasa nervorum. Vasa nervorum are the blood vessels which supply peripheral nerve trunks. They are constituted by outer (epineurial) and inner (perineurial) arteries and veins as well as by a capillary (endoneurial) plexus. Vasa nervorum are innervated by both sympathetic and non-sympathetic nerves which probably play a role in the pathogenesis of some neuropathies. Several different neurotransmitter containing nerve fibres have been identified in the vasa nervorum perivascular plexuses. However, no information is so far available concerning the neurotransmitter receptors of vasa nervorum. Moreover, although the occurrence of age-dependent changes in peripheral nerve morphology and function is well documented, very few reports were centered on the age-dependent changes of the vasa nervorum. The aims of the present study were to characterize pharmacologically and to localize anatomically the beta-adrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the rat vasa nervorum. Moreover, the effect of ageing on the density and pattern of these receptors was investigated.", 
    "30": "The effect of adrenaline on the accumulation of mRNA encoding cholesterol side-chain cleavage cytochrome P450 (P450scc) and cortisol secretion was studied in bovine adrenocortical cells in primary culture. Treatment of cultured cells with adrenaline resulted in a 2-fold increase in mRNA encoding P-450scc, as revealed by Northern blot analysis. Under these conditions the maximal stimulation with ACTH resulted in a 6-fold accumulation of mRNA encoding P450scc. The effect of adrenaline on the expression of P450scc was abolished by the beta-blocker propranolol, while propranolol had no effect on ACTH-induced P450scc mRNA accumulation. Adrenaline stimulated the secretion of cortisol in a dose-dependent manner with a median effective dose of 0.5 mumol/l. The adrenaline-stimulated cortisol secretion amounted to 42% of the effect of ACTH (0.1 nmol/l). Upon adrenaline treatment, cAMP concentration in the culture medium increased about 50-fold over the basal value. It is concluded that the stimulatory action of adrenaline upon cortisol formation requires beta-adrenergic receptors and is due, at least in part, to a cAMP-mediated increases in the accumulation of mRNA encoding P450scc.", 
    "31": "1. The effect of twice-daily dosing with propranolol on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a single oral dose of sumatriptan was investigated in 10 healthy male subjects. 2. Each subject received 7 days dosing with propranolol (80 mg twice daily) plus a single dose of sumatriptan (300 mg orally) on day 7; on another separate occasion, placebo was administered for 7 days plus a single dose of sumatriptan on day 7. There was at least a 7 day washout interval between the two periods of dosing. Pulse and blood pressure were measured up to 10 h after dosing with sumatriptan and blood samples were taken up to 26 h post-dose. 3. Propranolol had no significant effect on any of the derived pharmacokinetic parameters of sumatriptan. The appropriate average parameter values in the presence of propranolol were, respectively: Cmax (120 ng ml-1 vs 126 ng ml-1), tmax (4.5 h vs 3.0 h), AUC (580 ng ml-1 h vs 566 ng ml-1 h), t 1/2,z (1.9 h vs 1.8 h). 4. Propranolol had no significant effect on the pharmacodynamics of sumatriptan, as measured by pulse rate and blood pressure. 5. The results of this study would suggest that no alteration in the sumatriptan dosage will be necessary for migraine patients taking propranolol prophylactic therapy.", 
    "32": "The neuroendocrine response to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) was assessed in four patients after pretreatment with esmolol (1.0 mg/kg), fentanyl (1.5 micrograms/kg), labetalol (0.3 mg/kg), and saline solution (control). Each patient received each drug pretreatment using a double-blind, randomized study block-design. During each of the five studies, blood samples were obtained from each patient before anesthetic induction, before ECT shock, and at 1, 5, 10, and 30 min after seizure. Samples were subsequently analyzed for epinephrine, norepinephrine, adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), arginine vasopressin (AVP), and cortisol. Electroconvulsive therapy after saline pretreatment resulted in a 3-fold and 15-fold increase in norepinephrine and epinephrine levels, respectively (P less than 0.05). The ACTH and cortisol levels gradually increased over 30 min, peaking at values that were two to three times the control values (P less than 0.05). The AVP levels increased significantly after induction of ECT (P less than 0.005) and remained higher than control levels at 5, 10, and 30 min. The effect of pretreatments varied. Pretreatment with esmolol and fentanyl resulted in significant attenuation of the norepinephrine peak after seizure (P less than 0.05). Only esmolol significantly attenuated ECT-induced epinephrine secretion, whereas fentanyl pretreatment significantly reduced release of ACTH after ECT. No pretreatment significantly affected the elevated AVP or cortisol levels seen on emergence or up to 30 min after treatment. The ability of esmolol pretreatment to attenuate serum catecholamine release after ECT is consistent with its ability to block the cardiovascular responses to ECT.", 
    "33": "There is evidence in the rat that stimulation of renal alpha 2-adrenoceptors modulates vasopressin antidiuretic action and vasopressin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. In the present study, we tested the ability of various alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists to antagonize vasopressin-induced antidiuresis in the conscious hydrated dog and to inhibit vasopressin-induced adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) generation in rat and dog cortical collecting tubules. Vasopressin infusion (0.01 ng.kg-1.min-1) in five dogs resulted in a decrease in free water clearance from 2.90 +/- 0.42 to -0.34 +/- 0.08 ml/min. The vasopressin receptor antagonist SKF 105494 inhibited this response. Administration of norepinephrine (0.5 microgram.kg-1.min-1) or clonidine (20 micrograms/kg), however, failed to alter the vasopressin-induced antidiuresis. In vitro studies demonstrated that epinephrine caused a dose-dependent reduction in vasopressin-stimulated cAMP levels in cortical collecting tubules from the rat (50% effective concentration 32 nM) but not from the dog. The data indicate that there is a species difference in alpha 2-adrenoceptor modulation of vasopressin action.", 
    "34": "Dopamine and norepinephrine are involved in regulation of melatonin synthesis in the pineal gland. In bovine pineal gland, D1- and D2-dopaminergic and alpha 1-adrenergic receptors have been characterized pharmacologically in several laboratories, while beta 1-adrenergic receptors have been studied using physiological technique. The current study presents a quantitative autoradiographic analysis of these four dopaminergic and noradrenergic receptors in bovine pineal gland. The density order of the receptors is D1 greater than alpha 1 greater than D2 greater than or equal to beta 1. The Bmax of dopamine D1 receptors is about 5 to 6 times higher than the Bmax for alpha 1-adrenergic receptors and about 20 times higher than the Bmax values for beta 1-adrenergic and D2-dopaminergic receptors. Dopamine D1 receptors are significantly denser in the pineal cortex than in the medulla. Both dopamine receptors are more concentrated in the distal area than in the proximal area (close to the habenula), whereas both noradrenergic receptors are homogeneously distributed along the longitudinal axis. Only D1-dopaminergic receptors display a heterogeneous distribution between the superior and the inferior areas, being denser in the inferior area. The observation of a much higher concentration of D1-dopaminergic receptors relative to the other receptors suggests an important role for dopamine in the regulation of bovine pineal physiology.", 
    "35": "Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion is associated with the appearance of electrical activity in the pancreatic beta-cell. At intermediate glucose concentrations, beta-cell electrical activity follows a characteristic pattern of slow oscillations in membrane potential on which bursts of action potentials are superimposed. The electrophysiological background of the bursting pattern remains unestablished. Activation of Ca(2+)-activated large-conductance K+ channels (KCa channel) has been implicated in this process but seems unlikely in view of recent evidence demonstrating that the beta-cell electrical activity is unaffected by the specific KCa channel blocker charybdotoxin. Another hypothesis postulates that the bursting arises as a consequence of two components of Ca(2+)-current inactivation. Here we show that activation of a novel Ca(2+)-dependent K+ current in glucose-stimulated beta-cells produces a transient membrane repolarization. This interrupts action potential firing so that action potentials appear in bursts. Spontaneous activity of this current was seen only rarely but could be induced by addition of compounds functionally related to hormones and neurotransmitters present in the intact pancreatic islet. K+ currents of the same type could be evoked by intracellular application of GTP, the effect of which was mediated by mobilization of Ca2+ from inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ stores. These observations suggest that oscillatory glucose-stimulated electrical activity, which is correlated with pulsatile release of insulin, results from the interaction between the beta-cell and intraislet hormones and neurotransmitters. Our data also provide evidence for a close interplay between ion channels in the plasma membrane and InsP3-induced mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ in an excitable cell.", 
    "36": "The efficacy of 5-hydroxytryptophan and propranolol has been studied in the interval treatment of migraine. 39 migraine patients have participated in a double-blind trial. After a placebo run-in of one month, the patients received either 5-hydroxytryptophan or propranolol for 4 months. The treatment with both substances resulted in a statistically significant reduction in frequency of migraine attacks. Furthermore, in the propranolol group the duration of the attacks and the number of analgesics used for treatment of the attacks were significantly reduced. Although propranolol, which is considered a reference for the interval treatment of migraine, is more effective, 5-hydroxytryptophan is a possible alternative for many patients.", 
    "37": "Many patients with angina pectoris whose symptoms are not completely controlled by beta-blockers are treated with several types of drugs, but it is not clear whether addition of a calcium-channel antagonist and/or a nitrate confers any advantage over beta-blockade alone. 18 patients receiving atenolol for stable angina pectoris completed a double-blind, randomised, crossover trial of atenolol treatment plus placebo, isosorbide mononitrate, nifedipine, and mononitrate and nifedipine (triple therapy). The patients were assessed subjectively and by treadmill exercise testing and 24 h ambulatory electrocardiographic recordings at the end of each 4-week treatment period. There were no significant differences among the treatment periods in angina attack rates, glyceryl trinitrate consumption, exercise duration to onset of angina or 1 mm ST depression, or duration of symptomless ischaemia. Total exercise duration was longer on atenolol plus mononitrate than on atenolol alone (mean difference 46 [95% confidence interval 18-88] s; p = 0.005), atenolol plus nifedipine (36 [2-71] s; p = 0.04), or triple therapy (28 [6-61] s; not significant). In 12 patients the exercise time was shorter on triple therapy than on atenolol plus mononitrate alone. Although \"maximum\" antianginal treatment with two or three drugs is commonly accepted, this approach confers no substantial advantage over optimum beta-blockade as monotherapy. If a second drug is needed, there is a slight advantage in favour of isosorbide mononitrate, but if this is not effective, treatment should be changed rather than added. Many patients with angina pectoris seem to be pharmacologically overtreated.", 
    "38": "12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) stimulated the release of [3H]ethanolamine from HeLa cells prelabeled with [3H]ethanolamine within 2 min, and of [3H]choline from cells prelabeled with [3H]choline after a lag of 10-20 min. This result suggests that TPA activates phospholipase D. Propranolol alone or propranolol plus TPA stimulated phosphatidic acid (PA) labeling in cells prelabeled with [3H]hexadecanol. In the presence of ethanol, TPA stimulated the accumulation of labeled phosphatidylethanol (PEth); no PEth was formed in the absence of TPA. TPA-dependent PEth accumulation was not observed in cells pretreated with TPA to down-regulate protein kinase C, whereas propranolol-induced accumulation of PA was unaffected by TPA pretreatment. Incubation of prelabeled cells with propranolol alone caused a rapid loss of label and phospholipid mass from both phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine (PC) together with an accumulation of PA and phosphatidylinositol plus phosphatidylserine. When [3H]hexadecanol-prelabeled cells were pulse labeled with 32P to label nucleotide pools, propranolol induced the accumulation of both 3H- and 32P-labeled PA. When cells were prelabeled with lyso-PC double labeled with 3H and 32P, and incubated with propranolol, only 3H-labeled PA accumulated, indicating that the pathways involved in the basal turnover of PC resulted in the loss of 32P from the lipid. These results suggest that the basal turnover of phosphatidylethanolamine and PC involves the sequential actions of phospholipase C, diglyceride kinase, and PA phosphohydrolase.", 
    "39": "Expression of ligand binding properties for an atypical beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) subtype was studied during the adipose differentiation of murine 3T3-F442A cells and compared with that of the human beta 3-AR expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with the human beta 3-AR gene (CHO-beta 3 cells) Emorine, L. J., Marullo, S., Briend-Sutren, M. M., Patey, G., Tate, K., Delavier-Klutchko, C., and Strosberg, A. D. (1989) Science 245, 1118-1121). 3T3-F442A adipocytes exhibited high and low affinity binding sites for (-)-4-(3-t-butylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy) [5,7-3H]benzimidazole-2-one ((-)-[3H]CGP-12177) (KD = 1.2 and 38.3 nM) and (-)-[125I]iodocyanopindolol ([125I]CYP) (KD = 47 and 1,510 pM). The high affinity sites corresponded to the classical beta 1- and beta 2-AR subtypes whereas the KD values of the low affinity sites for the radioligands were similar to those measured in CHO-beta 3 cells (KD = 28 nM and 1,890 pM for (-)-[3H]CGP12177 and [125I]CYP, respectively). These low affinity sites were undetectable in preadipocytes but represented about 90% of total beta-ARs in adipocytes. The atypical beta-AR and the human beta 3-AR add similarly low affinities (Ki = 3-5 microM) for (+/-)-(2-(3-carbamoyl-4-hydroxyphenoxy)ethylamino-3)-(4-(1-methyl- 4- trifluormethyl-2-imidazolyl)-phenoxy)-2-propanol methane sulfonate (CGP20712A) or erythro-(+/-)-1-(7-methylindan-4-yloxy)-3-isopropylaminob utan-2-ol (ICI118551), highly selective beta 1- and beta 2-AR antagonists, respectively, in agreement with the poor inhibitory effect of the compounds on (-)-isoproterenol (IPR)-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. Atypical beta-AR and beta 3-AR had an affinity about 10-50 times higher for sodium-4-(2-[2-hydroxy-2-(3-chlorophenyl)ethylamino]propyl)phenoxyace tate sesquihydrate (BRL37344) than the beta 1-AR subtype. This correlates with the potent lipolytic effect of BRL37344 in adipocytes. The rank order of potency of agonists in functional and binding studies was BRL37344 greater than IPR less than (-)-norepinephrine greater than (-)-epinephrine both in 3T3 adipocytes and CHO-beta 3 cells. As in CHO-beta 3 cells, the classical beta 1- and beta 2-antagonists CGP12177, oxprenolol, and pindolol were partial agonists in adipocytes. Although undetectable in preadipocytes, a major mRNA species of 2.3 kilobases (kb) and a minor one of 2.8 kb were observed in adipocytes by hybridization to a human beta 3-AR specific probe.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "40": "Norepinephrine (NE) in the preoptic/anterior hypothalamic area (PO/AH) is known to be involved in the regulation of luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion. The effects of selective and complete depletion of NE in the PO/AH of ovariectomized (ovx) rats on LH secretion were studied. PO/AH concentrations of NE were reduced by 90% within 6 h and were undetectable (more than 98% depletion) 52 h after bilateral stereotaxic microinjections of 50 micrograms of 5-amino-2,4-dihydroxy-alpha-methylphenylethylamine (5-ADMP). LH levels in the blood were significantly reduced within 60 min after NE depletion but remained low only for several hours. Despite continuously low preoptic NE concentrations episodic LH secretion reoccurred within 4-6 h such that normal blood LH levels were present 6 and 52 h after selective NE depletion. While the alpha 1-adrenoreceptor antagonist prazosin was inhibitory to LH secretion in control rats the drug was totally ineffective in the NE depleted animals. NE may be inhibitory to LH secretion via a beta-adrenergic receptor mechanism. It was therefore also tested whether 5-ADMP causes a massive NE release which might be inhibitory to LH secretion. Propranolol (PROP), a beta-adrenoreceptor blocking drug, was given 30 min prior to preoptic injection of 5-ADMP. Blockade of beta-receptors did not prevent the transient inhibition of LH release. These results indicate that under physiologic conditions the GnRH pulse generator functions only properly when NE is present in the PO/AH and that the stimulatory effect of NE is mediated via an alpha 1-adrenoreceptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "41": "Survival rates and antiarrhythmic drug use were determined in 941 consecutive patients resuscitated from prehospital cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation between March 7, 1970, and March 6, 1985. Of these patients, 18.7% were treated for at least a portion of the period with quinidine, 17.5% with procainamide, and 39.4% received no antiarrhythmic agent. Beta blockers were prescribed for 28.3% of the patients. Unadjusted comparisons of survival estimates showed dramatically lower survival rates for patients who received antiarrhythmic drugs independent of beta-blocker therapy and significantly improved survival for patients receiving beta-blocker therapy independent of antiarrhythmic use. Patients for whom antiarrhythmic therapy was prescribed also had more adverse baseline risk factors, whereas patients taking beta blockers had fewer such risk factors. After adjustment for these baseline risk factors, the use of antiarrhythmics was weakly (p less than 0.09) associated with worsened survival; 2-year survival for procainamide-treated patients was 30% and quinidine-treated patients 55% (p = 0.003). Beta-blocker therapy was associated with improved (p less than 0.001) survival. Thus, although neither procainamide nor quinidine appear to have had a benefit on mortality, the effect of procainamide appears to be significantly worse than that of quinidine. The use of antiarrhythmic drug therapy in patients resuscitated from prehospital ventricular fibrillation should be regarded as not only unproved, but potentially hazardous, and should probably be restricted to testing in randomized clinical trials.", 
    "42": "The novel, naphthylpiperazine 5-HT1A agonist, S 14671 (4-[(thenoyl-2)aminoethyl]-1-(7-methoxynaphtylpiperazine], displayed very high affinity for 5-HT1A binding sites (pKi = 9.3) as compared to the serotonin (5-HT)1A agonists, 8-OH-DPAT (9.2) and (+)-flesinoxan (8.7) and the 5-HT1A partial agonists, buspirone (7.9) and BMY 7378 (8.8). In vivo, S 14671 induced the typical 5-HT1A agonist-induced responses of hypothermia and spontaneous tail-flicks at doses as low as greater than or equal to 5 micrograms/kg s.c. and greater than or equal to 40 micrograms/kg s.c., respectively. In each test, it was about 10-fold more potent than 8-OH-DPAT and 100-fold more potent than (+)-flesinoxan and buspirone. The actions of S 14671 could be blocked by BMY 7378 and the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, (-)-alprenolol, but not by the 5-HT1C/2 receptor antagonist, ritanserin, nor the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, ICS 205930.

This effect of 5-HT was reduced by pre-exposure of the tissue to 10 microM ketanserin and methysergide, which both have 5-HT2 antagonistic activity. A 5-HT1 agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (10 microM), reduced the release of TRH. These results imply that 5-HT released from the terminals of descending fibers modulates the release of TRH, a cotransmitter contained in 5-HT fibers.",

For 128 measurements, the mean difference +/- SD between TTD-TDL and TTD-EFM measurements was -0.037 +/- 0.24 L/min and -0.055 +/- 0.23 L/min, respectively. TDL-EFM mean difference +/- SD was -0.017 +/- 0.15 L/min. The limits of the agreement between TTD and the reference methods were 0.4 to -0.5 L/min. The limits of agreement between the reference methods were 0.3 to -0.3 L/min. Regression analysis yielded TTD = 0.383 + 0.779 TDL (r = 0.86); TTD = 0.351 + 0.788 EFM (r = 0.87); TDL = 0.077 + 0.95 EFM (r = 0.95). Only a change greater than 0.6 L/min in TTD CO could predict with 95% confidence a change in TDL or EFM CO.

    "46": "Afterdischarge (AD) triggered by brief, daily stimulation of the amygdala progressively increases in complexity and duration and, over days, develops into generalized convulsions. This progression, called kindling, is delayed by noradrenaline (NA). When brief stimulation of the amygdala occurs too frequently (massed), there is a suppression of AD growth and little evidence of kindling. Previously we showed that depletion of NA before massed amygdala stimulation prevented the suppression of AD growth described above, and readily precipitated generalized seizures. In the present report, we examined the role of NA in maintaining this suppression of AD growth, after it was well established. We showed that suppression of AD development during the first 15 massed stimulations (interstimulus interval of 5 min) was reduced by subsequent injection of the NA alpha 2 antagonist, yohimbine, with most rats exhibiting occasional generalized convulsions. Conversely, rats exposed to the beta antagonist, propranolol, like controls, not only showed suppressed AD growth, but also elevated AD thresholds. Three weeks later, only a small positive transfer to daily kindling was observed in all groups. We conclude that alpha 2 NA receptors help maintain suppression of AD growth induced by massed stimulation of the amygdala, while beta receptors provide only a small proepileptic influence. These results and those from the 'rapid' kindling model (Lothman et al., Brain Research, 360 (1985) 83-91) are compared, and related to NA receptor subtype variations in the amygdala and hippocampus.", 
    "47": "Binding studies with (-)-[125I]cyanopindolol (ICYP) were conducted to characterize beta-adrenoceptors in plantaris and soleus muscles of rats (male, 250-300 g). The distribution of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors in different muscle fiber types, identified in serial sections by succinic dehydrogenase (SDH) staining, was studied by autoradiography. The densities of binding sites (Bmax, fmol/mg protein) were 5.4 +/- 0.9 (mean +/- SEM) in plantaris and 11.5 +/- 2.0 in soleus muscle. In plantaris muscle, monophasic competition curves were observed when binding experiments were performed using CGP20712A (50 pM to 0.5 mM), a beta 1-adrenoceptor selective antagonist, or ICI 118,551 (50 pM to 20 microM), a beta 2-adrenoceptor selective antagonist, to compete for ICYP binding. Analysis with LIGAND revealed a single binding site with a KD value of 2.41 +/- 0.56 nM (mean +/- SEM) for ICI 118,551 and 8.93 +/- 3.00 microM for CGP 20712A, indicating the presence of a homogeneous population of beta 2-adrenoceptors. In soleus muscle, competition curves were biphasic with 16-21% beta 1-adrenoceptors. Autoradiographic studies supported the findings from binding studies with membrane homogenates. The ICYP binding pattern was associated closely with the muscle fiber types identified by SDH staining. Propranolol-resistant binding sites were observed, and these sites were associated with muscle fibers positive to SDH staining.",

The beta-adrenergic antagonists CGP 20712-A, ICI 118-551 and propranolol showed the same binding properties as beta-adrenergic receptors in previously described tissues or cells. The potencies of these compounds in inhibiting beta-adrenergic receptor mediated accumulation of cAMP corresponded well with their binding affinities. d-Nebivolol (SRRR) and nebivolol showed combined high affinity and selectivity for inhibition of beta 1-adrenergic receptor coupled accumulation of cAMP in CHO-Hu beta 1 cells (0.41 and 0.42 nM for d-nebivolol and nebivolol, respectively). l-Nebivolol (RSSS) was 1460 times less potent than d-nebivolol in CHO-Hu beta 1 cells. The binding affinities of d-nebivolol and nebivolol for human beta 1-adrenergic binding sites correlated well with their potencies in inhibiting beta 1-adrenergic receptor coupled accumulation of cAMP. CHO cells transfected with human beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors are a valid model system for studying the interaction of compounds with human beta-adrenergic receptors.",

After extraction with heptane-isopentanol and derivatization with (+)-1-(9-fluorenyl)ethyl chloroformate, excess reagent was removed using solid-phase extraction. The enantiomers were separated on an achiral, reversed-phase, radially compressed column, and detected by fluorescence with excitation and emission wavelengths of 260 and 340 nm, respectively. The limit of quantification was 0.5 ng/ml. This method was used for pharmacokinetic analysis of propranolol enantiomers after administration of immediate-release (80 mg) or sustained-release (160 mg) racemic propranolol.", 
    "58": "Positron emission tomography (PET) requires the use of compounds labelled with short-lived, positron-emitting isotopes (e.g., t1/2 of 11C approximately 120 min). As the concentration of unbound, non-metabolised drug is required as the input function for modeling, this presents particular problems for the study of the kinetics and metabolism of such compounds. We have now developed a rapid extraction procedure, followed by high-performance liquid chromatography using a short analytical column coupled to an on-line gamma-detector to determine the metabolism and kinetics of a non-selective beta-adrenergic antagonist of high affinity, S-4-(tert.-butylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy)benzimidazol-2-one. This antagonist is potentially well suited to the non-invasive localisation of beta-receptors in vivo. The ligand was rapidly taken up into the beta-receptor pool or excreted in urine, with less than 5% of the drug converted to metabolites. Plasma protein binding was only 16%. No significant metabolism of the ligand was observed in the anaesthetised dog, and, therefore, no correction for blood metabolite concentration is required for kinetic analysis of the 11C-labelled ligand during PET studies in this species. The analytical method reported here should be widely applicable: quantification of metabolites enables accurate estimation of the input function and is critical to the interpretation of PET data.", 
    "59": "The specific binding of broxaterol, a potent new orally active antiasthmatic drug, to beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors was characterized by receptor binding studies with rat heart and lung membrane preparations. Broxaterol showed high affinity and selectivity for the beta 2-component of [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding in both lung (58% beta 2-sites, Ki = 130 nM) and heart membranes (19% beta 2-sites, Ki = 98 nM), whereas the binding to the beta 1-component was at lower affinity (42% beta 1-sites, Ki = 4100 nM in the lung and 81% beta 1-sites, Ki = 3460 mM in the heart). The influence of temperature changes on the binding properties of broxaterol towards beta-adrenoceptors was also investigated. A marked increase in the affinity of broxaterol for lung beta-receptors was observed on lowering the assay temperature, whereas the affinity for heart beta-receptors was little affected by temperature changes. Thermodynamic analysis of the binding data showed that the binding of broxaterol as well as isoproterenol to lung beta-receptors was associated with a large decrease in enthalpy, which correlates well with the full agonistic properties of this compound at beta 2-receptors.", 
    "60": "The aim of this study was to determine the likely mediator(s) involved in the hypoxic-induced contraction in sheep pulmonary artery rings in vitro by studying the effects of selective receptor antagonists and enzyme inhibitors. Hypoxia caused a contraction in arteries under resting force and when precontracted with 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). Flurbiprofen, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, reduced the hypoxic contraction in 5-HT-precontracted rings but augmented the first part of the hypoxic contraction under baseline force. Inhibition of nitric oxide by haemolysate increased the hypoxic contraction under resting force. Superoxide dismutase and N-t-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone (PBN), free radical scavenging agents, and trypsin, a proteolytic enzyme, did not produce any significant effect on hypoxia-induced constriction. Propranolol plus phentolamine, beta- and alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists respectively, did not produce any effect on hypoxic contraction under resting force, whereas these antagonists augmented hypoxic contraction in the presence of 5-HT. This combination of antagonists also caused a reduction of 5-HT contraction which was the result of alpha 2-adrenoceptor blockade. Verapamil, a calcium channel blocking drug, significantly reduced the 5-HT contraction, but did not reduce that caused by hypoxia either under resting force or in precontracted rings. These results suggest that hypoxic constriction in sheep isolated intrapulmonary artery is in part caused by reduced release of vasodilator prostanoids. This contraction does not involve voltage-operated calcium channels and is limited by release of endothelium-derived nitric oxide.", 
    "61": "In urethane-anesthetized rats, xylene applied locally to the skin of the hind paws was shown to induce reflex increases of blood pressure (33%) and heart rate (37%). The blood pressure elevation was dose dependently inhibited by the NMDA antagonist, MK-801 (0.3-1.0 mg/kg i.v.), and by the AMPA (D,L-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxalonepropionic acid) antagonist, NBQX (2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo(F)quinoxaline 0.1-1.0 mg/kg per min). In contrast, only the latter compound was shown to block dose dependently the observed increase in heart rate. The results suggest that the two glutamate antagonists inhibit nociceptive impulse traffic at distinct anatomical sites and/or by different modes of actions.", 
    "62": "Salivary electrolyte secretion is under the control of the autonomic nervous system. In this paper we report that HSY, an epithelial cell line derived from the acinar-intercalated duct region of the human parotid gland, responds to muscarinic-cholinergic (generation of Ca2+ signal) and beta-adrenergic (generation of cAMP signal), but not to alpha-adrenergic (lack of Ca2+ signal), receptor stimulation. The muscarinic response was studied in detail. Carbachol (10(-4) M, muscarinic agonist) or A23187 (5 microM, calcium ionophore) stimulation of HSY cells increases both 86Rb (K+) influx and efflux, resulting in no change in net equilibrium 86Rb content. Atropine (10(-5) M, muscarinic antagonist) blocks both the carbachol-generated Ca2+ signal and carbachol-stimulated 86Rb fluxes, but has no effect on either the A23187-generated Ca2+ signal or A23187-stimulated 86Rb fluxes. Carbachol- and A23187-stimulated 86Rb fluxes are substantially inhibited by two K+ channel blockers, quinine (0.3 mM) and scorpion venom containing charybdotoxin (33 micrograms/ml). The inhibition of these stimulated fluxes by another K+ channel blocker, tetraethylammonium chloride (5 mM), is less pronounced. Protein kinase C (PKC) seems to be involved in the regulation of the 86Rb fluxes as 10(-7) M PMA (phorbol ester, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate) substantially inhibits the muscarinic-stimulated 86Rb efflux and influx. Because this concentration of PMA totally inhibits the carbachol-generated Ca2+ signal and only 80% of the muscarinic-stimulated 86Rb influx, it seems that a portion of the carbachol-stimulated 86Rb flux (i.e. that portion not inhibited by PMA) might occur independently of the Ca2+ signal. PMA fails to inhibit the A23187-stimulated 86Rb fluxes, however, suggesting that PKC regulates Ca(2+)-sensitive K+ channel activity by regulating the Ca2+ signal, and not steps distal to this event. 4-alpha-Phorbol-12,13-didecanoate, a phorbol ester which fails to activate PKC, fails to inhibit either the carbachol-stimulated increase in intracellular free Ca2+, or carbachol-stimulated 86Rb fluxes.", 
    "63": "We examined metoprolol oxidation capacity in 218 unrelated, healthy Korean subjects using the 8 h urinary metabolic ratio (MR) of metoprolol to alpha-hydroxymetoprolol after an oral dose of 100 mg metoprolol tartrate. The results were compared with those from 295 Japanese and 107 mainland Chinese whose metoprolol oxidation capacities were assessed in a similar manner. The frequency of occurrence of poor metabolisers (PMs) was 0.5% (1/218) in the Korean, 0.7% (2/295) in the Japanese and 0% in the Chinese population. However, the respective mean (+/- s.d.) MRs (0.84 +/- 1.14 and 0.87 +/- 0.90) in the Korean and Japanese extensive metabolisers (EMs) were significantly (P less than 0.001) less than that in the Chinese EMs (2.81 +/- 2.35), and the mode of the distribution histogram and the probit plot of data for Chinese EMs were shifted to the right compared with those for Korean and Japanese EMs. The results indicate that Koreans, like Japanese and mainland Chinese, have a much lower frequency of the PM phenotype of debrisoquine/sparteine-type oxidation compared with that reported for Caucasian populations. Chinese EMs appear to have a lower capacity to metabolise metoprolol to alpha-hydroxymetoprolol compared with Korean or Japanese EMs.", 
    "64": "We investigated the influence of quantitative changes in myocardial contractile state, reflected by changes in the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship (its slope and volume intercept) and by changes in the slope of the relationship between change in pressure per unit time and end-diastolic volume induced by beta-adrenergic stimulation or inhibition, on the Doppler derived blood flow velocity wave form of the carotid artery, using a newborn lamb model. Acceleration time of the velocity wave form was investigated during control state I, during 4 and 8 micrograms/kg/min dobutamine infusion, during control state II, and during 0.5 mg/kg propranolol infusion, respectively. Using multiple linear regression analysis with dummy variables, confounding effects such as interanimal variability were removed. Acceleration time showed a strong relationship to both the slope and the volume intercept of the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship and to the change in pressure per unit time-end-diastolic volume relationship. The relations appeared to be independent of aortic pressure and relative resistance in the vascular bed of the carotid artery. These results indicate that acceleration of cerebral blood velocity may prove to be useful in assessing changes in myocardial contractile state of the newborn.", 
    "65": "Sixty-two patients with mild hypertension were randomly assigned to receive no treatment, or 160 mg propranolol, or 200 mg metoprolol daily starting one week before elective surgery under anesthesia. The last dose was given two hours before anesthesia. Anesthesia consisted of induction with midazolam (2.5-5 mg) followed by thiopental (250-500 mg) and was maintained with 60% inspired N2O in oxygen and 0.4% enflurane inspired. Airway carbon dioxide was monitored continuously by a CO2 analyzer. Preoperative blood pressures were equally reduced by the two beta blockers. During anesthesia, however, blood pressure further decreased in the metoprolol group but not in the propranolol group. The authors conclude that propranolol is less effective than metoprolol in mildly hypertensive patients during surgery under anesthesia, owing probably to a pressor response from propranolol during the stress of surgery. They also conclude, however, that the amount of blood pressure reduction by cardioselective beta blockade (metoprolol) may not be needed and that anesthesia itself is an effective means of reducing the blood pressure.", 
    "66": "Multiple oral doses of diltiazem (DTZ) and propranolol (PPL, 60 mg every 8 h daily for 13 doses) were administered to 14 healthy volunteers alone and in combination on three separate occasions. Serial blood samples were collected up to 24 h after dose 13 on day 5 to determine possible pharmacokinetic interactions between the two drugs. When administered alone, DTZ concentration peaked at 161.4 ng ml-1 3 h following the final dose with an elimination half-life of 6.1 h. DTZ oral clearance was 65.1 l h-1. PPL did not affect DTZ oral clearance and half-life during the combination treatment. However, DTZ tmax was extended from 2.9 h to 3.5 h (p less than 0.05) and Cmax was 144.7 ng ml-1. Unlike the parent drug DTZ, desacetyldiltiazem (DAD) plasma profile was elevated during the combination treatment. DAD Cmax and AUC both increased approximately 20 per cent (p less than 0.05). PPL pharmacokinetics were altered as well. Oral clearance of PPL decreased from 80.4 l h-1 to 61.0 l h-1 while the half-life increased from 5.9 h to 8.0 h (p less than 0.05). PPL Cmax increased from 155.1 ng ml-1 to 167.5 ng ml-1.", 
    "67": "The relative bioavailability of a test sustained-release (SR) oxprenolol tablet against an approved regular-release (RR) tablet has been investigated at steady-state. In a randomized two-way crossover study, one tablet of 160 mg SR oxprenolol once every 24 h and one tablet of 80 mg RR oxprenolol once every 12 h were given to 12 healthy volunteers for 5 days. Blood samples were collected from each subject just prior to each dose-administration on days 1 through 4, and at scheduled time points on day 5 and analysed for oxprenolol concentration using HPLC. The SR tablet resulted in 42 per cent reduction in mean peak drug levels (p = 0.0341) and a statistically non-significant 14 per cent increase in mean trough levels (p = 0.8357) than the RR tablet. However it required 160 per cent longer time to reach average steady-state concentrations (Css) on day 5 (1.38 h for SR versus 0.53 h for RR; p = 0.0205). The mean area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve at steady state (AUC96-120) with the SR tablet was approximately 18 per cent lower than that observed with the RR tablet, and the degree of fluctuation (DF) was reduced by 30 per cent (2.81 for SR versus 4.11 for RR; p = 0.0069). On average, a single dose of SR tablet and two doses of RR tablets maintained the drug levels above a constant Css of 204.6 ng ml-1 for 7.88 and 7.65 h, respectively (p = 0.3513).", 
    "68": "Laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation often cause hypertension, tachycardia and arrhythmias, which may be exaggerated during rapid-sequence induction of anaesthesia. We have studied the efficacy of pindolol in attenuating the cardiovascular responses to laryngoscopy and intubation in patients receiving pindolol 2 micrograms kg-1 or 4 micrograms kg-1 3 min before induction of anaesthesia in a double-blind design. The data were compared with those in a control group receiving saline. Each group consisted of 10 patients undergoing elective surgery. Anaesthesia was induced with thiopentone 5 mg kg-1 i.v. and tracheal intubation was facilitated with vecuronium 0.2 mg kg-1. Patients receiving saline showed a significant increase in mean arterial pressure and heart rate associated with tracheal intubation. These increases after tracheal intubation were reduced in pindolol 4 micrograms kg-1 treated patients compared with those in the control group (P less than 0.05). Pindolol 2 micrograms kg-1 attenuated tachycardia in response to intubation but did not affect hypertension. These data suggest that a bolus injection of pindolol 4 micrograms kg-1 is a simple, practical and effective method for attenuating cardiovascular responses to laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation.", 
    "69": "We have demonstrated previously that transfer function analysis can be used to precisely characterize the respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) in normal humans. To further investigate the role of the autonomic nervous system in RSA and to understand the complex links between respiratory activity and arterial pressure, we determined the transfer functions between respiration, heart rate (HR), and phasic, systolic, diastolic, and pulse arterial pressures in 14 healthy subjects during 6-min periods in which the respiratory rate was controlled in a predetermined but erratic fashion. Pharmacological autonomic blockade with atropine, propranolol, and both, in combination with changes in posture, was used to characterize the sympathetic and vagal contributions to these relationships, as well as to dissect the direct mechanical links between respiration and arterial pressure from the effects of the RSA on arterial pressure. We found that 1) the pure sympathetic (standing + atropine) HR response is characterized by markedly reduced magnitude at frequencies greater than 0.1 Hz and a phase delay, whereas pure vagal (supine + propranolol) modulation of HR is characterized by higher magnitude at all frequencies and no phase delay; 2) both the mechanical links between respiration and arterial pressure and the RSA contribute significantly to the effects of respiration on arterial pressure; 3) the RSA contribution to arterial pressure fluctuations is significant for vagal but not for sympathetic modulation of HR; 4) the mechanical effects of respiration on arterial pressure are related to the negative rate of change of instantaneous lung volume; 5) the mechanical effects have a higher magnitude during systole than during diastole; and 6) the mechanical effects are larger in teh standing than the supine position. Most of these findings can be explained by a simple model of circulatory control based on previously published experimental transfer functions from our laboratory.", 
    "70": "We treated 28 patients (16 women and 12 men) who had essential tremor with methazolamide. Their median age was 69 years (range, 34 to 89 years), and the median duration of tremor was 16 years (range, less than 1 to 69 years). Fifteen cases were familial and 13 were sporadic. Improvement in 10 patients who continued taking the drug ranged from moderate to complete relief. In addition, four patients had marked improvement and two had moderate improvement but discontinued use of the drug because of side effects. Five patients with a mild response and seven with no response also discontinued methazolamide therapy. The maximal mean daily dose was 203 mg for all patients and 129 mg (maintenance dose) for the patients who continued taking the drug. Side effects consisted primarily of somnolence, nausea, epigastric discomfort, anorexia, paresthesias, and numbness. No aplastic anemia was noted in any of the patients. The median duration of follow-up was 6 months (range, 10 weeks to 29 months). The therapeutic effect seemed unrelated to a family history of tremor, the effect of alcohol, or the responsiveness to propranolol or primidone. Methazolamide may be an effective drug in the treatment of some patients with essential tremor, particularly those with head and voice tremor.", 
    "71": "Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a potent mediator of inflammation and is a mediator which is known to cause airway hyperresponsiveness in human and experimental animals. However, the mechanism of action of PAF is not clear. In this study we examined the effect of methacholine upon specific airway resistance (SRaw) in guinea pigs and the ability of either isoproterenol or prostaglandin E2 to reverse this effect both before and after PAF administration at sub-bronchoactive doses in conscious guinea pigs as well as in isolated airway tissues. SRaw in conscious guinea pigs was monitored using a whole-body plethysmograph. In nonsensitized guinea pigs, a concentration of PAF (0.1 micrograms/ml), which by itself did not affect SRaw, potentiated the methacholine-induced increase in SRaw. In ovalbumin-sensitized animals, the response to methacholine was significantly greater as compared to the nonsensitized group. Prior administration of PAF did not potentiate the response to methacholine in ovalbumin-sensitized animals. In isolated tracheal rings and lung parenchymal strips of nonsensitized guinea pigs, preincubation of the tissue with 0.1 microM PAF decreased the sensitivity of isoproterenol to induce relaxation. However, in the ovalbumin-sensitized group of guinea pig tracheas or lung parenchymas, PAF did not reduce further the effect of isoproterenol to elicit relaxation. Furthermore, PAF did not alter the affinity or the density of beta adrenoceptors in guinea pig lung membranes. These data suggest that PAF may potentiate the responses to bronchoconstrictors and desensitize the responses to bronchodilators in a nonspecific manner. This may be a mechanism underlying PAF-induced airway hyperresponsiveness in asthma.", 
    "72": "The authors determined whether the ocular absorption of topically applied timolol in the pigmented rabbit was affected significantly by coadministration with either pilocarpine or epinephrine in the same drop to explain the nonadditivity in intraocular pressure lowering (IOP) seen clinically. They instilled 25 microliters of 0.65% timolol maleate solution (equivalent to 0.5% timolol), both in the presence and absence of 2.6% pilocarpine nitrate or 1% epinephrine bitartrate, into pigmented rabbit eyes. The time course of timolol concentration in the conjunctiva, anterior sclera, corneal epithelium, corneal stroma, aqueous humor, iris-ciliary body, and lens was monitored for 360 min by using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The area under the timolol concentration-time curve in all but one of the anterior segment tissues was reduced by 20-50% (mean, 40%) when timolol was coadministered with pilocarpine and by 20-70% (mean, 42%) when timolol was coadministered with epinephrine. Such an effect was not a result of alterations in corneal permeability or aqueous humor turnover rate, nor was it related to the extent of systemic absorption caused by pilocarpine and epinephrine. Rather, the reduction in ocular timolol absorption may have been caused by the accelerated washout of timolol by tears stimulated by the coadministered drugs and, to a lesser extent, by the loss of timolol through binding to the increased amount of tear proteins induced by the coadministered drugs. Thus, the nonadditivity in IOP lowering from timolol-pilocarpine and timolol-epinephrine combinations is probably caused by changes in precorneal timolol clearance.", 
    "73": "Effects of AF-DX 116, a cardioselective antagonist, on M cholinergic receptors (M-ChR) were studied in healthy volunteers. Occupancy of M-ChR subtypes by drug present in plasma samples (radioreceptor assay) was compared with these effects. After an intravenous dose of AF-DX 116 saturating greater than 90% of cardiac M2-ChR, an increase in heart rate by 25 beats/min was observed. This cardiac receptor occupancy and effect wore off with a parallel time course within 10 hours. No inhibition of salivary flow was observed, coinciding with a lack of M3-ChR blockade in the radioreceptor assay. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade by propranolol did not affect either of the effects. No indication for active metabolites or stereoselective drug metabolism was found comparing HPLC and receptor assay for drug concentrations in plasma. We conclude that AF-DX 116 may be a useful drug for the treatment of bradycardia. Its lack of troublesome side effects is the result of its selectivity for cardiac M-ChR.", 
    "74": "A variant CYP2D6(C) P450 protein was found in a liver characterized by deficient microsomal metabolism of bufuralol and sparteine, prototypical substrates for the debrisoquine-sparteine drug oxidation polymorphism. This protein was present at decreased levels in liver and had a slightly different relative mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The cDNA cloning and sequencing of the variant, designated CYP2D6(C), revealed that its mRNA lacked a single codon resulting in deletion of Lys281. This was the result of a three base pair deletion at the 3' end of CYP2D6 exon 5. The CYP2D6(C) P450, produced in HepG2 cells using vaccinia virus mediated cDNA expression displayed Km values toward bufuralol, debrisoquine and sparteine that were not significantly different from wild type CYP2D6. These data suggest that the poor metabolizer phenotype in livers expressing CYP2D6(C) is not due to a catalytically defective enzyme but perhaps due to decreased levels of the P450 protein in microsomal membranes. Low microsomal CYP2D6(C) contents could result from deficient membrane insertion or decreased stability of the P450 protein. A polymerase chain reaction-based procedure, developed to detect CYP2D6(C) alleles, indicates that this variant probably represents less than 1.5% of all CYP2D6 alleles.", 
    "75": "To assess the mechanisms whereby arginine vasopressin (AVP) increases atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) release and to examine whether AVP-mediated ANP release affects the effect of AVP on the cardiovascular and renal function, AVP was infused continuously at a rate of 20 ng.kg-1.min-1 for 75 min following 200 ng/kg bolus injection under stepwise increases in plasma volume in anesthetized dogs. Moreover, the effect of an AVP antagonist, a V1 blocker, 1-(beta-mercapto-beta, beta-cyclopentamethylenepropionic acid)-2-(o-methyl)tyrosine AVP (TMeAVP), on these parameters was also investigated. In the control study, saline alone was infused. AVP infusion increased total peripheral resistance (TPR), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), and plasma ANP, but decreased cardiac index (CI) and heart rate (HR) without increases in mean arterial blood pressure (MABP). Stepwise rises in plasma volume further increased plasma ANP, CVP, CI and PCWP, but gradually decreased TPR. TMeAVP curtailed AVP-induced increases in TPR and plasma ANP as well as decreases in CI and HR. The replacement of ANP to prevent a fall in plasma ANP following TMeAVP never affected cardiovascular function. AVP infusion increased plasma volume accompanied by a fall in urinary Na excretion (UNaV) and urine flow (UF) under the stepwise plasma volume expansion compared to the control group, but did not affect mean circulatory filling pressure (MCFP). ANP administration enhanced UNaV and UF and decreased MCFP. These results indicate that AVP may preferentially increases ANP release via the increased cardiac afterload, not preload, but increased plasma ANP per se may not be involved directly in the AVP-induced cardiac suppression.", 
    "76": "The author studied the characteristics of ACE inhibitor-induced cough in 41 non-smoking hypertensive patients. For at least 6 months, 20 patients (10 males and 10 females) were treated with enalapril, and 21 (11 males and 10 females) with aracepril. The results were as follows. 1) ACE inhibitor-induced cough was induced in 7 cases (1 male and 6 females). The incident rate of cough was 17.1%. ACE inhibitor-induced cough was not significantly related to past allergic history or to the beta-adrenergic blocker therapy. The laboratory findings of the cough sufferers--such as eosinophil percent in venous blood, serum GOT and GPT, urea nitrogen, creatinine, renal function (PSP excretion test and creatinine clearance), and pulmonary function (%FVC, FEV1.0% and %V25)--were not significantly different from those of the non-coughers. 2) Inhibitory effects of ipratropium bromide inhalation of ACE inhibitor-induced cough were noted in 83.3% of the patients, but their coughs did not completely disappear. From these findings, the pathogenesis of this cough may be related to be as follows. The cough seems to be related to the release of acetylcholine from vagal nerve terminals or to the stimulation of irritant receptors and vagal reflex. 3) Chronic persistent cough or bronchial asthma did not occur after stopping the treatment with ACE inhibitors. The mean follow-up period was 15.6 months.", 
    "77": "The characteristics of ECG changes with representative antiarrhythmic drugs; procainamide (PA) (class Ia), lidocaine (LC) (class Ib), propranolol (PN) (class II), and verapamil (VP) (class IV) were investigated in adult rats. Action potential (AP) was also recorded from myocardial cells during electrical stimuli with frequencies of 1-5 Hz. All the four drugs produced ECG abnormalities which contained AV and SA blocks at middle and high dose levels. Three drugs except VP induced a prolongation of QRS complex and notched QRS at low or middle dose level. As compared such effects with those in dogs and humans, some differences were noted as follows: (1) a dose-dependent prolongation of QT interval by LC and PN, and (2) a shortening of RR interval by VP at the dose of 0.6 mg/kg or less. LC and PN elongated the QT interval in the unipolar precordial chest lead ECGs at right anterior chest positions. These two drugs did not affect the duration of AP (APD90), whereas maximum upstroke velocity (Vmax) decreased. These results suggest that the prolongation of QT interval with LC and PN was due to a delay in local ventricular conduction time, especially on the right ventricle. The shortening of RR interval by VP was clearly blocked by the pretreatment with PN, indicating that this shortening reflected the sympathetic nervous reflex presumably due to the peripheral vasodilation effect of VP.",

The AP was measured with an aneroid sphygmomanometer, in mmHg, in orthostatic position, before and after 10, 20, 30 and 60 minutes of treatment. The heart rate in one minute was also measured at the same intervals. The patients were divided randomly into four groups and treated, respectively, with 10 mg of diazepam, 10 mg of nifedipine, 40 mg of propranolol and 10 mg of nifedipine associated with 40 mg of propranolol.", 
    "80": "A significant and gradual reduction of SAP and DAP were observed in all groups of patients. The percentage of reduction, after 60 minutes, for SAP was, respectively, 10.1%, 12.9%, 15.4% and 16%, and for DAP 7.7%, 11.3%, 13.6% and 13% in groups I to IV. The heart rate did not change in groups I and II, but significative reduction was observed in groups III (p = 0.002) and IV (p = 0.009).",

    "82": "The metabolism of carvedilol was investigated in plasma and urine of 3 healthy male volunteers after administration of 50 mg of [14C]-labelled drug. Rapid and extensive biotransformation occurred. After 1.5 h 9% of total radioactivity in plasma consisted of unchanged drug, 22% of carvedilol-glucuronide and another 20% of oxidative cleavage products of the beta-blocking side chain. Urinary excretion of radioactivity amounted to 16% of which 2% represented unchanged drug, 32% carvedilol-glucuronide and about 25% side chain oxidation products. Ring-hydroxylated metabolites of carvedilol accounted for 18% of the radioactive compounds in the urine.", 
    "83": "The diode array multichannel detector is used to acquire spectral information at specified intervals in the elution profile of atenolol and its related impurities for post-chromatographic data analysis. The applicability of a number of peak homogeneity testing methods, including spectral normalization, absorbance ratio, chromatographic derivatives, and spectral suppression (SS), are assessed for suitability in simultaneous determinations of the coeluting atenolol-related synthetic impurities, PPA-Diol. Spectral suppression displays a superior performance in comparison to all the other techniques in that both qualitative and quantitative information are acquired on the system.", 
    "84": "Using the cannula insertion method, we investigated vascular effects of 7-O-ethyl-fangchinoline (TJN-220) derived from tetrandrine in isolated and perfused common carotid arteries of Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). A single dose of TJN-220 caused a vasodilation in a dose-related manner in arteries preconstricted by phenylephrine. The vasodilation was not inhibited by propranolol, a potent beta-adrenoceptor antagonist. A potent alpha-antagonist bunazosin inhibited the vasoconstriction to norepinephrine while TJN-220 did not modify the norepinephrine-induced constriction, indicating TJN-220 had no alpha-blocking activity. A potent calcium entry blocker, diltiazem, markedly attenuated the KCl-induced vasoconstriction, and TJN-220 slightly but significantly attenuated the KCl-induced one in large doses. The vasodilation of TJN-220 was not abolished after removing the endothelium by an intraluminal administration of saponin, although the ACh-induced dilation was completely abolished by it. A comparison of vascular responses in WKY and SHR revealed no significant differences. From these results, it is concluded that 1) a new tetrandrine derivative, TJN-220 has relatively long-lasting vasorelaxant properties, 2) the dilatory effects might not be related to adrenergic, muscarinic or endothelium-dependent mechanisms, and 3) the effects might partially be due to calcium entry antagonistic properties.", 
    "85": "The effect of propranolol (PPL), phenoxybenzamine (PBZ) or bicuculline (BCL) on the diazepam (DZP)-induced changes of pineal melatonin synthesis in male rats was examined in vivo and in vitro. Administration of PBZ did not affect the inhibitory action of DZP on pineal melatonin synthesis in vivo. A single injection of PPL inhibited the pineal melatonin synthesis similarly to the administration of DZP alone, but the two drugs together did not exhibit additive or synergistic effects on the melatonin synthesis. Significant decreases in the N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity and the N-acetylserotonin (NAS) and melatonin contents were observed in the BCL-injected group, being greater than those in the DZP-treated group. Unexpectedly, however, the combination treatment of DZP and BCL causes an increase in the NAT activity and melatonin content compared with the BCL-alone group. Incubation with DZP at higher concentrations resulted in an increase of pineal NAT activity in vitro, but this increase was inhibited by preincubation with PPL, PBZ or BCL. DZP treatment thus appeared to have different effects on pineal NAT activity in vivo and in vitro. These results suggest that both a GABAergic mechanism and peripheral benzodiazepine (BZP) receptors in rat pineal gland may be involved in the modulation of melatonin synthesis by DZP.", 
    "86": "Plasma protein binding of weakly basic drugs such as propranolol and quinidine was determined in rats with carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced hepatic disease. Free fractions of propranolol and quinidine in the plasma of rats at 24 h after CCl4-intoxication were decreased by 41 and 30%, respectively, compared to those of control rats. An addition of Tris (butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBEP), a specific displacer for basic drugs from alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), to the plasma increased the free fractions of the basic drugs, resulting in no difference in the extent of the plasma free fraction of each drug between control and CCl4-intoxicated rats. Plasma concentration of AGP in CCl4-intoxicated rats was elevated 2.7-fold of that in control rats at 24 h after the CCl4 intoxication and reached a peak of 4.8-fold elevation at 48 h. A regression analysis revealed a high degree of positive correlation between ratios of bound to free fraction of propranolol and plasma concentrations of AGP. These results suggest that the plasma protein binding of the basic drugs was increased mainly due to the rise in the plasma AGP concentration in CCl4-intoxicated rats.", 
    "87": "In a previous paper, we have demonstrated that medium chain fatty acids significantly enhance the in vitro rectal absorption of propranolol (PL) and that the enhancement may be partly due to the formation of a complex with a fatty acid at a 1:1 molar ratio. To confirm in vivo the enhancement effect of lauric acid on PL absorption, PL suppositories with lauric acid at various molar ratios were administered to rat rectum. PL absorption from Witepsol and macrogol suppositories with lauric acid at a 1:1 molar ratio was much larger than that after PL alone and the 1:2 or 1:3 molar ratio ones. The bioavailability (BA) after administration of the 1:1 molar ratio suppository (PL, 4 mg/kg) was 1.6- and 2.1-fold for the Witepsol and macrogol formulations respectively, compared with that after PL alone. A similar result was obtained with the PL solid dispersion suppository with lauric acid at a 1:1 molar ratio, showing a 1.7-fold higher BA compared with PL alone. The release of PL from the macrogol suppository was significantly faster at a 1:1 molar ratio than that of other preparations, but not so in the solid dispersion suppository. There was not good agreement between the release rates of PL from the suppositories and the plasma levels after dosing. These results supported the concept that a portion of PL, by forming a 1:1 complex with lauric acid, would penetrate across the rectal mucosa more easily than PL alone.", 
    "88": "The underlying mechanisms of ketamine-induced hyperlocomotion were examined in mice. An intraperitoneal (IP) injection of ketamine (3-150 mg/kg) increased locomotor activity in a dose-dependent fashion. A low dose of ketamine (30 mg/kg) produced peak locomotion within the first 10 min followed by a rapid decline. In contrast, a high dose (150 mg/kg) inhibited locomotor activity to the control level during the first 30 min. Thereafter the activity gradually increased and reached a peak at approximately 2 h followed by a gradual decline. The hyperactivities induced by both low and high doses of ketamine were inhibited by a low dose of haloperidol (0.10 mg/kg, IP), a dopamine (DA) receptor antagonist. However, neither a high dose of phenoxybenzamine (10 mg/kg, IP), an alpha-blocker nor a high dose of propranolol (20 mg/kg, IP), a beta-blocker inhibited the hyperactivities. Destruction of catecholaminergic terminals by 6-hydroxydopamine suppressed ketamine-induced hyperlocomotion. Regional brain monoamine assays revealed that, at peak locomotion, a low dose of ketamine (30 mg/kg) selectively increased DA turnover in the nucleus accumbens which is a forebrain region believed to be involved in the initiation and regulation of locomotor activity, while a high dose (150 mg/kg) increased not only DA but also norepinephrine and serotonin turnover in many regions of the brain. In vitro, ketamine slightly provoked [3H]DA release from nucleus accumbens and striatal slices to a similar extent, but inhibited synaptosomal uptake of [3H]DA in the nucleus accumbens to a greater degree than in the striatum.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "89": "Labetalol and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) were compared for their efficacy in controlling hypertension of blacks in a prospective, double-blind study. Sixty-one adult patients with mild to moderate hypertension (standing diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 95 mm Hg and less than or equal to 114 mm Hg) were randomly selected to receive either labetalol 100 mg twice daily (n = 30) or HCTZ 25 mg twice daily (n = 31). The study was divided into two phases: a 4-week placebo run-in phase, during which all previous antihypertensive medication was discontinued, and a 12-week drug treatment phase. Labetalol and HCTZ doses were titrated to 400 mg twice and 50 mg twice daily, respectively, during the first 6 weeks of the drug treatment phase for those patients not achieving blood pressure control (standing diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg and a decrease of 10 mm Hg from baseline) on initial dosages. By the end of the 12 weeks of drug administration, patients on labetalol experienced a mean decrease of 10 mm Hg in standing diastolic blood pressure compared to a mean decrease of 10.1 mm Hg in patients on HCTZ. No differences were observed between the two treatment groups in reductions of either standing blood pressure or heart rate. While 19 of 30 patients on labetalol (63%) achieved blood pressure control at some point during the study with a mean daily dose of 568 mg, 18 of 31 (58%) HCTZ-treated patients achieved control with a mean daily dose of 72 mg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "90": "The present study was undertaken to elucidate beta-adrenoceptor blocking effects of befunolol (BFE 60, CAS 39543-79-8) on changes in the myocardial metabolites induced by hypoxic respiration. When rats were subjected to hypoxic respiration, a significant increase in heart rate (about 13% increase) and a slight decline in mean aortic blood pressure (about 12% decrease) were observed at 1 min and 6 min after the onset of hypoxic respiration. The hypoxic respiration also elicited decreases in the myocardial ATP and creatine phosphate levels (each 18% decrease) and increases in the myocardial lactate (13% increase) and cyclic-AMP (20% increase) levels. In contrast, these changes were never observed throughout hypoxic respiration when rats had been treated with both reserpine and alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine methylester 20 to 22 h before experiment, suggesting that these metabolic alterations are mediated through beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. These hypoxic respiration-induced hemodynamic and metabolic changes were found to be suppressed by treatment with 1 and 10 micrograms/kg befunolol or 10 micrograms/kg propranolol to an appreciable degree. The results demonstrate protective action of befunolol, like propranolol, on hypoxia-induced changes in the myocardial energy metabolism.", 
    "91": "1. The effects of microinjections (100 nl) into the dorsal motor vagal nucleus of the 5-HT1A receptor agonists 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) and flesinoxan, the 5-HT2 receptor agonist (+-)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane hydrochloride (DOI), the 5-HT3 receptor agonist phenylbiguanide (PBG), the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine and the excitatory amino acid glutamate on heart rate, blood pressure, tracheal pressure and phrenic nerve activity were investigated in atenolol-pretreated rats anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone. 2. Microinjections of glutamate (2.5 nmol) caused decreases in blood pressure, heart rate and phrenic nerve activity. In contrast, microinjections of 5-HT (1.2 nmol), 8-OH-DPAT (1.2 nmol) and flesinoxan (1.3 nmol) all caused a bradycardia but had no effect on blood pressure. In addition, 8-OH-DPAT and flesinoxan caused an increase in phrenic nerve activity. 3. Microinjections of DOI, PBG and clonidine had no significant effect on any of the variables recorded. None of the drugs used had any significant effect on tracheal pressure. 4. These results support the hypothesis that activation of 5-HT1A receptors causes excitation of cardiac vagal motoneurones and suggest that these receptors are also important in the control of central respiratory drive.", 
    "92": "Thirty-five non-selected, consenting patients were studied during induction of anesthesia before coronary artery bypass grafting. Anesthesia was induced with diazepam, thiopentone and fentanyl, followed by pancuronium. Before induction, 200 MBq Tc 99 m - HSA was given i.v. and ejection fraction (EF) of the left ventricle was measured with a collimated single-crystal probe. The patients were allocated to five groups (seven patients in each) treated with: Group A: nitroglycerin i.v. bolus 4 micrograms x kg-1 given 30-60 s before laryngoscopy; Group B: nitroglycerin i.v. in continuous infusion, 1 micrograms x kg-1 x min-1 started before induction; Group C: two-stage topical anesthesia of the vallecula region and larynx with lidocain; Group D: a combination of nitroglycerin and topical anesthesia (as in Group B and C); and Group E: propranolol i.v. 0.01 mg x kg-1 given 5 min before intubation. All groups reacted in the same way during induction of anesthesia up to the point of laryngoscopy. End-diastolic volume and systemic arterial pressure decreased while cardiac index remained unchanged and EF increased. During laryngoscopy and intubation, however, differences between the groups were evident. Nitroglycerin i.v. as a bolus effectively prevented a reduction in EF and an increase in left ventricular volume. In addition to these beneficial hemodynamic effects, there was a moderate increase in heart rate and a reduction of stroke index. Continuous infusion of nitroglycerin and propranolol i.v. had no effect, since EF fell and left ventricular volume increased. Patients receiving topical anesthesia demonstrated a blunted response to endotracheal intubation with a moderate decrease in EF and an unchanged (Group C) or slightly increased (Group D) left ventricular volume.", 
    "93": "Systolic left ventricular flow was studied by pulsed and continuous wave Doppler in 41 patients following aortic valve replacement for severe stenosis (mean valvular area: 0.58 cm2; range 0.3-0.75 cm2). Maximal left ventricular velocities by continuous wave Doppler study, were higher than 2.5 m.s-1 with a sharp peak at end-systole in five patients in basal condition and in four others after amyl nitrite inhalation. Pulsed Doppler study showed that the high velocities started from the apex or mitral papillary muscle level with a marked chamber narrowing at two-dimensional echography. Only one patient had a systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the anterior mitral leaflet with mitral-septal contact. The left ventricular dimensions, as measured by M-mode echography were compared in the various patient groups. High velocities seemed statistically associated with the smaller systolic and diastolic diameters of the left ventricle and outflow tract and the larger relative thickness of the posterior wall. The highest pressure gradients disappeared after correction of hypovolaemia (one patient), clearance of pericardial effusion (one patient), or beta-blocker treatment (three patients). The present study confirms that left intra-ventricular dynamic gradients can occur after clearance of fixed outflow obstruction, for which Doppler examination is a reliable and innocuous diagnostic means. Haemodynamically, this syndrome resembles hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, but the scarcity of the systolic anterior motion of the mitral leaflets is suggestive of a different mechanism that could be cavity obliteration or mid-ventricular obstruction.", 
    "94": "The effect of the beta-blocker atenolol on experimental infarct size was studied in a non-human primate model. In 12 baboons thrombosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) was induced and atenolol (0.1 to 0.2 mg.kg-1 intravenously, sufficient to lower the heart rate by 20%) was administered 10 min after the onset of ischaemia in six animals, whereas the others received placebo. Thrombolysis was induced 60 min after the onset of ischaemia by intravenous injection of rtPA (12 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) in all animals. Heart rate dropped significantly after atenolol injection (128 +/- 9 beats.min-1 versus 163 +/- 15 beats.min-1, P less than 0.001) and was also lower than in the control group (128 +/- 9 beats.min-1 versus 158 +/- 22 beats.min-1, P less than 0.05). Blood pressure remained unchanged after atenolol treatment. As compared to the control group, atenolol limited infarct size, expressed as a percentage of left ventricular mass (4.6 +/- 1.9% versus 7.9 +/- 1.3%, P less than 0.05) or as a percentage of the perfusion area (26 +/- 8% versus 43 +/- 8%, P less than 0.05)."
