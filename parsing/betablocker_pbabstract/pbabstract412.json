    "2": "Of 42 patients diagnosed with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome, evidence of glaucoma requiring either medical or surgical intervention occurred in 16 patients (38.1%). Of these, nine (56.3%) had open-angle glaucoma and seven (43.7%) had angle-closure secondary to pupillary block. In 5 (31.3%) of the 16 patients, medical therapy alone was sufficient to control intraocular pressure. Eleven patients (68.7%) required surgical intervention, consisting of laser iridotomy, surgical iridectomy, trabeculectomy with or without 5-fluorouracil, and/or Molteno implantation.", 
    "3": "The relative success of each of these procedures in this group of patients is discussed. Glaucoma is a common complication in the Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome, and one that is often difficult to control.", 
    "4": "The behavioral effects of two beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists, selected to represent differing lipophilicity, were evaluated in a double-blind, single-dose, parallel-group study. A group of 55 healthy volunteers (mean age, 28 years) received single oral doses of placebo, atenolol (50 mg), propranolol (40 mg), or lorazepam (2 mg). Plasma drug concentrations, self-ratings of sedation and mood, observer ratings of sedation, and performance on the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) were assessed at multiple times during 24 hours after drug administration. Information acquisition and recall were tested at 3 and 24 hours after drug administration. Lorazepam significantly increased sedation and fatigue, impaired DSST performance, and impaired memory. The time course of these changes was highly consistent with plasma lorazepam concentrations. In contrast, atenolol and propranolol produced at most small changes in self-ratings and observer ratings and did not alter DSST performance or memory. Under experimental conditions that are sensitive to the depressant effects of a typical benzodiazepine, single doses of atenolol and propranolol produced no meaningful changes, compared with placebo.", 
    "5": "dl-nebivolol is a new, chemically unique, selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, without sympathomimetic activity. In the present study, the antihypertensive and negative chronotropic effects of 5 and 10 mg once-daily nebivolol were compared to those of 50 and 100 mg once-daily atenolol in 25 white, male subjects with essential hypertension, using a double-blind, crossover design, and a parallel placebo-treated group of subjects (N = 7). 24 hours after dosing, sitting and standing diastolic and systolic blood pressures and heart rates (at rest and during submaximal exercise) were reduced to the same extent by nebivolol and atenolol. On a weight-for-weight basis, nebivolol is ten times more potent than atenolol. Nebivolol and atenolol also reduced 1-hour ambulatory plasma renin activity. Once-daily nebivolol is an effective antihypertensive beta-adrenoceptor antagonist.", 
    "6": "Elevation of cAMP changes the morphology of C6 rat glioma cells from a fibroblast to an astrocyte type of appearance. This change is prevented by the presence of serum from different species (chicken, mouse, rat, horse, adult bovine, fetal bovine, and human) in the cell culture medium. In this communication the component in serum responsible for this effect is identified as lysophosphatidic acid for the following reasons: First, lysophosphatidic acid alone at concentrations which are present in serum reverts the morphological response. Second, both lysophosphatidic acid and the component in serum no longer revert the morphological response after treatment with phospholipase B (E.C.3.1.1.5). Third, lysophosphatidic acid and serum produce an analogous intracellular Cai2+ signal in rat glioma C6 cells as measured by fluorescence spectrophotometry with the Ca2+ ion indicator Fura 2. Fourth, both the morphological response and the Cai2+ increase are prevented by pretreatment of the cells with 100 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Finally, a maximal Cai2+ increase induced by FCS prevents the subsequent Cai2+ signal by lysophosphatidic acid. Interestingly, the morphological response is also reverted by Al3+ together with F- ions and also by lower n-alkanols such as ethanol and n-propanol suggesting that a regulatory GTP-binding protein is involved in the reversion. It is further shown that activation of the phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate cleavage signal system is not responsible for the reversion of the morphological response.", 
    "7": "Patients (n = 314) with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) were divided into three groups according to the time elapsed from onset of chest pain to when the first sample for determination of magnesium (s-Mg1) and potassium (s-K1) was drawn (A: hours 0-6; B: hours 6-10, and C: hours 10-24). Potassium and Mg were also measured in a second sample drawn three to twelve days (mean 6.3 days) later (s-Mg2, s-K2). Whereas s-Mg1 was lower than s-Mg2 in all three groups, s-K1 was reduced only in group A. Ten patients in group A receiving nonselective beta-blockers had an attenuated drop in s-Mg1, whereas the drop in s-K1 was completely inhibited. The differences between s-Mg2 and s-Mg1 (delta s-Mg) in all groups, and between s-K2 and s-K1 (delta s-K) in group A, increased with increasing mean peak creatine kinase (CKmax) levels to approximately 1300-1800 U/L. In conclusion, these observations suggest that the initial drop in s-Mg and s-K in the early phase of AMI is due to increased stimulation of beta 2-adrenergic receptors; these changes can be prevented partly or completely by the use of nonselective beta-blockers.", 
    "8": "Performance of the linear regression-based ST/HR (heart rate) slope, the simple ST/HR index, and ST segment depression alone for the identification of anatomically severe coronary obstruction was examined in relation to the definition of the extent of disease and the presence or absence of beta-blockade during treadmill exercise using the Cornell protocol in 172 catheterized patients. Whether severe disease was defined by three-vessel obstruction, by Gensini scores partitioned at 35 or at 48, or by Duke jeopardy scores exceeding 6, the 83% to 100% sensitivities of an ST/HR slope criterion of 6.0 microV/beat/min were each significantly higher than the corresponding 65% to 80% sensitivities of 150 microV of ST segment depression closely matched specificities. The ST/HR slope was significantly more sensitive than a simple ST/HR index criterion of 3.4 microV/beat/min for detection of high Gensini scores, but despite consistently intermediate performance trends, in no case did sensitivity of the simple ST/HR index criterion significantly exceed that of ST depression alone. Each method performed better and with comparable sensitivity in patients not receiving beta-blockers. In contrast, the 82% to 100% sensitivities of the ST/HR slope for identification of severe disease were significantly higher than the 63% to 77% sensitivities of ST depression in patients taking beta-blocking drugs; however, simple heart rate adjustment using the ST/HR index had intermediate performance that in no case was significantly more sensitive than ST segment depression alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "10": "We have studied types of hemodynamics and results of arterial hypertension intensive care in 136 pregnant women in 32-38 weeks of gestation. Stroke and cardiac indexes, general peripheral vascular resistance, mean arterial pressure, cardiac work and other hemodynamic parameters were investigated by echocardiographic method. We worked out regression equations for each type of hemodynamics. Rational regimens of arterial hypertension therapy were selected according to hemodynamics types. In the hyperkinetic type a combination of propranolol with nifedipine was used, in eukinetic type--methyldopa with nifedipine and in hypokinetic type--clonidine with nifedipine. Using individualized therapy of arterial hypertension in women with gestoses we succeeded in improving the results of intensive care as a component of preparation for anesthesia in delivery ahead of time by cesarean section as well as in normal delivery at term.", 
    "11": "The effect of a novel ultrashort acting beta-adrenoblocker esmolol on systemic and pulmonary hemodynamics has been studied intraoperatively in 81 cardiosurgical patients. All the patients were operated under ataralgesia. Esmolol is an effective controlled agent for the treatment and prevention of supraventricular tachycardia and hyperdynamic reaction developing in cardiothoracic patients during anesthesia and surgery. Bolus injection of 100 mg esmolol exerts a negative chronotropic effect with maximum heart rate decrease by 23.3% by minute 5 and a gradual attenuation of the effect by minute 20. A parallel drop in the cardiac output by 18.5% is caused predominantly by a decrease in the heart rate and accounts for BP reduction. The above esmolol dose does not have a considerable effect on pulmonary hemodynamics and does not enhance intrapulmonary venous shunting.", 
    "12": "In the present research the effects that the beta-blockers may express on the development of foetal myocardium have been studied \"in vivo\" and \"in vitro\". On the basis of previous researches (7), the beta-blocker effects have been observed by utilizing low doses in comparison with the therapeutic levels. Wistar rats affected by a surgically elicited renal hypertension and \"in vitro\" cultivated human heart buds, represent the two models utilized for our research. In the first model the low dose of beta-blocker, able to reduce the plasmatic renin activity (PRA) but unable to determine normal conditions of blood pressure, evokes an eccentric dilation of ventricular room and severe alterations of the myofilament pattern. Also in human heart buds cultivated in presence of beta-blocker at low levels of concentration in the cultural media, deep changes in the structural and ultrastructural pictures of the myocardium can be observed; the major changes consist in a particular and constant accumulation of glycogen in the cytoplasm of the myoblasts whose organules are pushed to the periphery of the cells. At electron microscopic level, disorders affecting the myofilaments and their genesis are present, while the intercellular junctions seem to be blocked in their ability to transfer into functional contacts; in fact, they appear only as mechanical junctions. Utilizing an autoradiographic technique the above described alterations seem to derive from a different degree of captation of thimidine-methyl-3H that appears to be higher in the specimens exposed to high dose of beta-blocker. Finally, all the results obtained seem to indicate the negative influence that the studied drugs can express on the histogenesis and the metabolism of myocardial cells.", 
    "13": "Since the first report in 1977, many studies have reported the efficacy of beta blockers for the treatment of violent and aggressive behavior. Propranolol had mainly been reported to be effective in aggressive patients with organic brain syndromes of diverse etiologies. Doses of propranolol had varied ranging from 60 to 1,440 mg per day with means also varying from 250 to 400 mg per day. Propranolol was in most cases added to existing neuroleptic treatment but sometimes it had been the only medication used. Treatment response required 4 to 6 weeks of maintenance therapeutic doses. The utility of propranolol in aggressive patients with other diagnoses and the efficacy of other beta blockers remain unclear and require further studies.", 
    "14": "The beta-blocking activity of bopindolol, a new nonselective beta-blocker, and of its active metabolites (18-502 and 20-785) was compared with that of propranolol and atenolol in anesthetized open chest dogs. No remarkable changes in basal cardio-hemodynamic parameters were observed in all groups, except for dp/dtmax which was decreased in the bopindolol-, propranolol-and atenolol-treated groups. All beta-blockers used inhibited the isoproterenol (0.1 microgram/kg, i.v.)-induced tachycardia and the increase in myocardial oxygen consumption dose-dependently. The active metabolite 18-502 was the most potent; it was 19 times as potent as propranolol with respect to the antitachycardic action and 34 times as potent as propranolol in inhibiting the increase in oxygen consumption induced by isoproterenol (0.1 microgram/kg). The potency of bopindolol was nearly equal to that of propranolol, while the potency of atenolol and the metabolite 20-785 was weaker than that of propranolol. As 18-502 was found as a metabolite also in man, it is suggested that 18-502 is a more important active metabolite of bopindolol than 20-785 in in vivo conditions, though the metabolite 20-785 is also a potent beta-blocker.", 
    "15": "Bevantolol (Bev, 5, 10 mg.kg-1) was injected i.v. to rabbits. A measure the lag time of heart rate (HR) response behind the changes in plasma Bev concentration (K(eo)), and the sensitivity of the site of action of Bev (EC50) were determined. The K(eo) were 0.03 +/- 0.02 and 0.029 +/- 0.009 min-1 and the EC50 were 0.2 +/- 0.1 and 0.27 +/- 0.14 microgram.ml-1 respectively for the 2 dosages. The peak changes in HR lagged behind the changes in plasma Bev concentration. There were no significant changes in both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters between the dosages.", 
    "16": "1. Vasodilator responses were elicited by field stimulation in isolated perfused segments of rabbit jejunal arteries when noradrenergic and purinergic vasoconstrictor responses had been abolished and the smooth muscle partly contracted by endothelin. 2. The stimulation-induced vasodilator responses were abolished by tetrodotoxin, but were not affected by atropine, propranolol or a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor. 3. After recovery from the vasodilator action of capsaicin, the stimulation-induced vasodilator responses were greatly reduced or abolished. 4. A competitive antagonist of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) blocked vasodilator responses elicited by field stimulation and exogenously administered CGRP. 5. The findings indicated that the mediator of the stimulation-induced vasodilator responses is neurogenic in origin, and it is not acetylcholine, noradrenaline acting on beta-adrenoceptors, nitric oxide or an endothelium-dependent vasodilator. It appears to be CGRP, presumably released from sensory nerves in the periarterial plexus.", 
    "17": "The potential 5-HT1A antagonist properties of the beta-antagonist tertatolol were assessed using biochemical and electrophysiological assays in the rat. (+/-) Tertatolol bound with high affinity (Ki = 38 nM) to 5-HT1A sites labelled by [3H]8-OH-DPAT in hippocampal membranes. The (-)stereoisomer (Ki = 18 nM) was about 50-fold more potent than the (+)stereoisomer (Ki = 864 nM) to inhibit the specific binding of [3H]-8-OH-DPAT. As expected of a 5-HT1A antagonist, (-)tertatolol prevented in a concentration-dependent manner (Ki = 24 nM) the inhibitory effect of 8-OH-DPAT on forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in rat hippocampal homogenates. Furthermore in vivo pretreatment with (-)tertatolol (5 mg/kg s.c.) significantly reduced the inhibitory influence of 8-OH-DPAT (0.3 mg/kg s.c.) on the accumulation of 5-hydroxytryptophan in various brain areas after the blockade of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase by NSD-1015 (100 mg/kg i.p.). In vitro (in brainstem slices; Ki approximately 50 nM) and in vivo (in chloral hydrate anaesthetized rats; ID50 approximately 0.40 mg/kg i.v.), (-)tertatolol prevented the inhibitory effects of the 5-HT1A receptor agonists 8-OH-DPAT, ipsapirone and lesopitron on the firing rate of serotoninergic neurones within the dorsal raphe nucleus. In about 25% of these neurones, the basal firing rate was significantly increased by (-)tertatolol (up to +47% in vitro, and +30% in vivo). These data indicate that (-)tertatolol is a potent competitive antagonist at both pre (in the dorsal raphe nucleus)-and post (in the hippocampus)-synaptic 5-HT1A receptors in the rat brain.", 
    "18": "Intensified aggregability of red blood cells (RBC) was produced in adult white rats by the step-by-step intravascular administration of a high-molecular-weight dextran, with a molecular weight approximating that of blood fibrinogen. As a result, the systemic arterial pressure was elevated by more than one-third of the initial level, whereas the diameter of arterioles in the intestinal mesentery remained practically unchanged. This provided sufficient grounds for the conclusion that the increase in the total peripheral resistance was due to disturbances in blood rheological properties. Despite the elevated arterial pressure, the blood flow velocity in mesenteric arterioles displayed a clear-cut tendency to slow down. Simultaneously, a large number of RBC aggregates appeared in the mesenteric microvessels. In patients with a stable form of arterial hypertension the RBC aggregability index was found to be significantly increased as compared with that of the healthy control group. Following treatment with Ca(2+)- and beta-adrenergic blockers the index decreased significantly in parallel with the lowering of arterial pressure. The obtained results suggest that the intensified RBC aggregation in microvessels causing a disturbance of normal blood flow structure, and hence of blood rheological properties, might be an important factor responsible for the elevation of systemic arterial pressure in humans with arterial hypertension.", 
    "19": "In other studies, we noted decreased reactivity of resistance arteries to endothelin-1 (ET-1) in hypertensive rats and humans. To determine whether these changes are reversible with antihypertensive treatment, we examined a hypertensive model exquisitely sensitive to angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, the two-kidney, one-clip (2K, 1C) Goldblatt hypertensive rat. Rats were allowed to become hypertensive for 6 weeks. At this point, either the clip was removed, or rats were treated with 5-10 mg/kg/day cilazapril, 100-150 mg/kg/day metoprolol, or 25 mg/kg/day hydralazine, or were left untreated. After 8 weeks more, mesenteric resistance arteries were examined after mounting on a wire-myograph. Blood pressure (BP) and heart/body weight ratio were normalized in unclipped and cilazapril-treated rats. Plasma renin activity (PRA) was normalized only in the unclipped group. Media width, media/lumen ratio, and media cross-sectional area were similar in control normotensive, unclipped, and cilazapril-treated rats and increased in untreated hypertensive, metoprolol, and hydralazine groups. Dose-response curves of resistance arteries to ET-1 were significantly blunted in untreated hypertensive rats (maximum active tension = 2.3 +/- 0.3 vs 3.4 +/- 0.1 N/m in control, p < 0.01), metoprolol-treated (2.2 +/- 0.4 N/m), and hydralazine-treated rats (2.1 +/- 0.5 N/m), and were normalized in cilazapril (3.3 +/- 0.1 N/m) and unclipped rats (3.2 +/- 0.1 N/m). Similar effects were noted in response to norepinephrine (NE) and arginine vasopressin (AVP).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "20": "The antianginal effects of YM-16151-4, a combined calcium entry blocking and beta 1-adrenoceptor blocking agent, were evaluated in various experimental angina models and compared with those of nifedipine and propranolol. In anesthetized dogs, YM-16151-4 (0.3 and 1 mg/kg intravenously, i.v.) increased coronary blood flow and reduced myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2). In isolated dog coronary arteries, YM-16151-4 concentration-dependently inhibited 3,4-diaminopyridine-induced rhythmic contractions with an IC50 value of 91 nM. In anesthetized rats, YM-16151-4 also inhibited the ST-segment depression induced by vasopressin (0.5 U/kg i.v.) with an ED50 value of 29 mg/kg orally, (p.o.). Nifedipine was also effective in these models, but propranolol was not. In addition, YM-16151-4 (0.3 mg/kg i.v.) inhibited the ST-segment elevation in the epicardial ECG induced by coronary artery occlusion in anesthetized dogs. Propranolol (1 mg/kg i.v.) also inhibited this elevation, but nifedipine (0.003 mg/kg i.v.) did not. In anesthetized dogs, furthermore, the prolongation of PQ-interval induced by YM-16151-4 was almost the same as that induced by propranolol. These results demonstrate that YM-16151-4, in contrast to nifedipine and propranolol, is fully effective in these various types of angina models. Thus, YM-16151-4 is expected to prove a valuable antianginal agent in treatment of various types of angina pectoris, with these antianginal effects resulting from the sum of its calcium entry blocking and beta 1-adrenoceptor blocking activities.", 
    "21": "Electrical stimulation of the parasympathetic innervation to parotid or submandibular gland for 30 or 60 min resulted in increased [3H]thymidine uptake of both glands when measurements were made 18 h later. With 30 min of stimulation, the mean increase in parotid was 30% compared with unstimulated mates, and after 60 min of stimulation, the increase was 76%. Stimulation for 30 min with the adrenergic antagonists propranolol and phenoxybenzamine present showed an increase in [3H]thymidine of 76%. Stimulation of the chorda tympani for 30 min resulted in a mean increase of 59% in thymidine uptake of the sympathectomized submandibular gland compared with the unstimulated sympathectomized mate. beta-1,4-Galactosyltransferase activity of both stimulated parotid and submandibular glands also showed an increase of 71%. On the basis of the composition of the saliva in the oral cavity, we confirmed the identity of the stimulated nerve to parotid gland as the parasympathetic (auriculotemporal). Na, K, and amylase concentrations resembled closely the composition of saliva obtained directly from the duct with electrical stimulation of the parasympathetic nerve. These data provide the first evidence that electrical stimulation of the parasympathetic nerve to parotid and submandibular glands causes a mitogenic response in each of these organs; the data also provide the first evidence that electrical stimulation of the parasympathetic nerve causes an increase in levels of the enzyme beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase, known to be implicated in hyperplastic responses.", 
    "22": "1. Electrophysiological effects of MS-551, a new class III antiarrhythmic drug, were examined and compared with those of (+)-sotalol in rabbit ventricular cells. 2. In rabbit ventricular muscles stimulated at 1.0 Hz, MS-551 (0.1-10 microM) and (+)-sotalol (3-100 microM) prolonged action potential duration (APD) and effective refractory period without affecting the maximum upstroke velocity of phase 0 depolarization (Vmax). The class III effect of MS-551 was approximately 30 times more potent than that of (+)-sotalol. 3. Class III effects of MS-551 and (+)-sotalol showed reverse use-dependence, i.e., a greater prolongation of APD at a longer cycle length. 4. In rabbit isolated ventricular cells, 3 microM MS-551 and 100 microM sotalol inhibited the delayed rectifier potassium current (IK) which was activated at more positive potentials than -50 mV and saturated around +20 mV. 5. MS-551 at a higher concentration of 10 microM decreased the transient outward current (Ito) and the inward rectifier potassium current (IK1) although 100 microM sotalol failed to inhibit these currents. 6. MS-551 is a non-specific class III drug which can inhibit three voltage-gated K+ channels in rabbit ventricular cells.", 
    "23": "To gain insight into the specificity of cytochrome P-450 2D6 toward inhibitors, a preliminary pharmacophore model was built up using strong competitive inhibitors. Ajmalicine (1), the strongest inhibitor known (Ki = 3 nM) was selected as template because of its rigid structure. The preliminary pharmacophore model was validated by performing inhibition studies with derivatives of ajmalicine (1) and quinidine (9). Bufuralol (18) was chosen as substrate and the metabolite 1'-hydroxybufuralol (19) was separated by high performance liquid chromatography. All incubations were carried out using human liver microsomes after demonstration that the Ki values obtained with microsomes were in accordance with those obtained with a reconstituted monooxygenase system containing purified cytochrome P-450 2D6. Large differences of Ki values ranging between 0.005 and 100 microM were observed. Low-energy conformers of tested compounds were fit within the preliminary pharmacophore model. The analysis of steric and electronic properties of these compounds led to the definition of a final pharmacophore model. Characteristic properties are a positive charge on a nitrogen atom and a flat hydrophobic region, the plane of which is almost perpendicular to the N-H axis and maximally extends up to a distance of 7.5 A from the nitrogen atom. Compounds with high inhibitory potency had additional functional groups with negative molecular electrostatic potential and hydrogen bond acceptor properties on the opposite side at respective distances of 4.8-5.5 A and 6.6-7.5 A from the nitrogen atom. The superposition of strong and weak inhibitors led to the definition of an excluded volume map. Compounds that required additional space were not inhibitors. This is apparently the first pharmacophore model for inhibitors of a cytochrome P-450 enzyme and offers the opportunity to classify compounds according to their potency of inhibition. Adverse drug interactions which occur when both substrates and inhibitors of cytochrome P-450 2D6 are applied may be predicted.", 
    "24": "The perfluorochemical emulsion Fluosol-DA plus carbogen breathing has been shown to increase the effectiveness of radiation therapy in preclinical solid tumors when the emulsion was administered by i.v. bolus injection. Much of the enhancement in tumor radiation response was lost when the emulsion was administered slowly.", 
    "25": "We hypothesized that an increase in tumor perfusion resulted when Fluosol-DA was administered rapidly.", 
    "26": "In the present study, the alpha/beta agonist ephedrine, the Ca2+ channel blocker flunarizine and the nitric oxide producing vasodilating drug nitroprusside have been tested.", 
    "27": "Ephedrine administration resulted in a decrease in the radiation plus Fluosol-DA +/- carbogen antitumor effects in both the Lewis lung carcinoma and FSaIIC tumor systems. In contrast, flunarizine administration resulted in an increase in the efficacy of the radiation plus carbogen and the radiation plus Fluosol-DA/carbogen in both tumor systems. Even with flunarizine administration Fluosol-DA delivered slowly was less effective than when the emulsion was given rapidly. Flunarizine with Fluosol-DA infused i.v. over 30 min followed by carbogen breathing prior to and during radiation therapy resulted in a 1.7-1.6-fold increase in response compared with 2.4-2.2-fold with Fluosol-DA administered by injection i.v. and carbogen breathing prior to and during radiation therapy using growth delay of the Lewis lung carcinoma. The effects of nitroprusside were complex. This drug had considerably more effect at 10 Gy than at higher radiation doses.", 
    "28": "These studies suggest that Fluosol-DA given by i.v. injection may increase tumor perfusion and that a drug like flunarizine may be beneficial if the Fluosol-DA is administered slowly followed by carbogen breathing and radiation therapy.", 
    "29": "L-Methionine-D,L-sulfoximine (MSO) (25 micrograms) infused locally into the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) induced a progressive decrease in body temperature in conscious restrained rats kept at an ambient temperature of 23 degrees C. Pretreatment with (+/-)-pindolol (3 mg/kg s.c.) significantly attenuated MSO-induced hypothermia, but pretreatment with ketanserin (0.5 mg/kg i.p.) did not alter either the magnitude or the time course of the decrease in body temperature after intra-DRN infusion of MSO. Local accumulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) after infusion of gamma-vinylGABA (10 micrograms) and (+/-)-nipecotic acid (6 micrograms) inhibited MSO-induced hypothermia. Blockade of GABAA receptors by infusion of (-)-bicuculline (25 ng) had no effect on the decrease in body temperature elicited by MSO, but blockade of GABAB receptors by infusion of 2-OH-saclofen (13.3 ng) significantly attenuated MSO-induced hypothermia. In conclusion, local infusion of MSO into the DRN must have slowed down the rate of 5-HT turnover in serotonergic neurons and decreased the release and synthesis of GABA. 5-HT1A somato-dendritic autoreceptors and GABAB postsynaptic receptors both appear to be involved in these neurocytochemical processes leading to hypothermia.", 
    "30": "Given the same level of arterial pressure control, studies in diabetic animal models have demonstrated certain classes of antihypertensive medication to confer better overall preservation of renal histologic features and function as well as reduced albuminuria when compared with other agents.

All subjects received a low-salt, low-protein diet.

Reductions in albuminuria were not different between groups 1 and 2, but both were significantly reduced compared with group 3.", 
    "33": "Given a similar level of arterial pressure control, both lisinopril and diltiazem slow progression of diabetic renal disease and reduce albuminuria to a greater extent than does the combination of a loop diuretic and beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist.

The indomethacin-treated group showed significantly decreased levels of substance P. The indomethacin effect is due to inhibition of the synthesis of arachidonic acid metabolites or involves non-specific mechanisms. It is suggested that suppression of substance P release may contribute to therapeutic effects of indomethacin in the human eye in conditions such as surgical miosis.",

Left ventricular muscle mass was measured echocardiographically, before and after the treatment. All these patients were known to have hypertension, with exercise-related angina and ischaemic signs in the resting ECG, but normal coronary angiograms. After the treatment period both maximal coronary perfusion and coronary reserve had increased by 22%. At the same time, left ventricular muscle mass had decreased from 161 +/- 18 to 146 +/- 21 g/m2. These results demonstrate that blood pressure reducing treatment can bring about not only a regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, but also an improvement in coronary reserve.", 
    "37": "Rabies virus infection in man induces a series of clinical symptoms, some suggesting involvement of the central serotonergic system. The results of the present study show that, 5 days after rabies virus infection in rat, the total reversible high-affinity binding of [3H]5-HT in the hippocampus is not affected, suggesting that 5-HT1A binding is not altered. 5-HT1B sites identified by [125I]cyanopindolol binding are not affected in the cortex 3 and 5 days after the infection. Accordingly, the cellular inhibitory effect of trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP) on the [3H]acetylcholine-evoked release, presumably related to 5-HT1B receptor activity, is not modified 3 days after infection. In contrast, [3H]5-HT binding determined in the presence of drugs masking 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B and 5-HT1C receptors, is markedly (50%) reduced 3 days after the viral infection. These results suggest that 5-HT1D-like receptor subtypes may be affected specifically and at an early stage after rabies viral infection.", 
    "38": "The rate of aqueous humor flow was studied in 17 human subjects with neurogenic diabetes insipidus. Flow was measured by fluorophotometry on two consecutive afternoons. The first day, subjects used desmopressin to control their diuresis; on the second day, subjects did not use desmopressin and had uncontrolled diuresis. On both days, one eye was treated with the beta-adrenergic antagonist, timolol. With desmopressin, the rate of aqueous humor flow in the untreated eye was 2.53 +/- 0.79 microliters/min (mean +/- standard deviation) and in the timolol-treated eye was 1.69 +/- 0.40 microliters/min. Without desmopressin, the rate of aqueous humor flow in the untreated eye was 2.34 +/- 0.69 microliters/min and in the timolol-treated eye was 1.53 +/- 0.43 microliters/min. Thus, the use of desmopressin was associated with a slightly higher rate of aqueous humor flow in both the normal and the beta-adrenergically inhibited eye (P = .05), and the suppression of aqueous humor flow associated with beta-adrenergic inhibition occurred with and without antidiuretic hormone (P < .001). The observed differences in aqueous humor flow on the two days could have been caused by a direct effect on the eye or to indirect effects, such as the change in plasma osmolality, which changed from 291 +/- 6 mOsm on the desmopressin day to 299 +/- 8 mOsm on the desmopressin-abstention day (P < .001).", 
    "39": "We have shown previously that GTP-binding regulatory protein (G protein) beta gamma subunits stimulate the agonist- or light-dependent phosphorylation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) and rhodopsin by a protein kinase partially purified from porcine brain (mAChR kinase) but not the phosphorylation of rhodopsin by rhodopsin kinase (Haga, K., and Haga, T. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 2222-2227). We report here that the mAChR kinase phosphorylates beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-ARs) purified from bovine lung in an agonist-dependent manner, and the phosphorylation is also stimulated by G protein beta gamma subunits. We also report that recombinant beta-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 (beta-ARK1) expressed in COS-7 cells phosphorylates mAChRs (human m2 subtype) and rhodopsin in an agonist- or light-dependent manner, respectively, and that this phosphorylation is stimulated by G protein beta gamma subunits. By contrast, the beta gamma subunits do not stimulate the phosphorylation of mAChRs or rhodopsin by a beta-ARK1 mutant lacking a part of the carboxyl-terminal region which is present in beta-ARKs but not in rhodopsin kinase. These results indicate that the beta-ARK1 is the same as or very similar to the mAChR kinase but is distinguished from the rhodopsin kinase with respect to activation by the beta gamma subunits and that the extra carboxyl-terminal sequence in beta-ARKs is required for the stimulation by the beta gamma subunits.", 
    "40": "The efficacy of permanent cardiac pacing in patients with neurocardiogenic (or vasovagal) syncope associated with bradycardia or asystole is not clear. We compared the efficacy of cardiac pacing with that of oral drug therapy in the prevention of hypotension and syncope during head-up tilt testing.", 
    "41": "Among 70 patients with a history of syncope in whom hypotension and syncope could be provoked during head-up tilt testing, 22 had bradycardia (a heart rate < 60 beats per minute, with a decline in the rate by at least 20 beats per minute) or asystole along with hypotension during testing. There were 9 men and 13 women, with a mean (+/- SD) age of 41 +/- 17 years. Head-up tilt testing was repeated during atrioventricular sequential pacing (in 20 patients with sinus rhythm) or ventricular pacing (in 2 patients with atrial fibrillation). Regardless of the results obtained during artificial pacing, all the patients subsequently had upright-tilt testing repeated during therapy with oral metoprolol, theophylline, or disopyramide.", 
    "42": "During the initial tilt test, 6 patients had asystole and 16 had bradycardia along with hypotension. Despite artificial pacing, the mean arterial pressure during head-up tilt testing still fell significantly, from 97 +/- 19 to 57 +/- 19 mm Hg (P < 0.001); 5 patients had syncope, and 15 had presyncope. By contrast, 19 patients who later received only medical therapy (metoprolol in 10, theophylline in 3, and disopyramide in 6), 2 patients who received both metoprolol and atrioventricular sequential pacing, and 1 patient who received only atrioventricular sequential pacing had negative head-up tilt tests. After a median follow-up of 16 months, 18 of the 19 patients who were treated with drugs alone (94 percent) remained free of recurrent syncope or presyncope, whereas the patient treated only with permanent dual-chamber pacemaker had recurrent syncope.",

    "44": "The physiological significance of multiple G-protein-coupled receptor subtypes, such as the beta-adrenergic receptors (beta ARs), remains obscure, since in many cases several subtypes activate the same effector and utilize the same physiological agonists. We inspected the deduced amino acid sequences of the beta AR subtypes for variations in the determinants for agonist regulation as a potential basis for subtype differentiation. Whereas the beta 2AR has a C terminus containing 11 serine and threonine residues representing potential sites for beta AR kinase phosphorylation, which mediates rapid agonist-promoted desensitization, only 3 serines are present in the comparable region of the beta 3AR, and they are in a nonfavorable context. The beta 3AR also lacks sequence homology in regions which are important for agonist-mediated sequestration and down-regulation of the beta 2AR, although such determinants are less well defined. We therefore tested the idea that the agonist-induced regulatory properties of the two receptors might differ by expressing both subtypes in CHW cells and exposing them to the agonist isoproterenol. The beta 3AR did not display short-term agonist-promoted functional desensitization or sequestration, or long-term down-regulation. To assign a structural basis for these subtype-specific differences in agonist regulation, we constructed a chimeric beta 3/beta 2AR which comprised the beta 3AR up to proline-365 of the cytoplasmic tail and the C terminus of the beta 2AR. When cells expressing this chimeric beta 3/beta 2AR were exposed to isoproterenol, functional desensitization was observed. Whole-cell phosphorylation studies showed that the beta 2AR displayed agonist-dependent phosphorylation, but no such phosphorylation could be demonstrated with the beta 3AR, even when beta AR kinase was overexpressed. In contrast, the chimeric beta 3/beta 2AR did display agonist-dependent phosphorylation, consistent with its functional desensitization. In addition to conferring functional desensitization and phosphorylation to the beta 3AR, the C-terminal tail of the beta 2AR also conferred agonist-promoted sequestration and long-term receptor down-regulation.", 
    "45": "To determine the relative efficacy of nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) and diltiazem, 20 patients with angina pectoris and coronary artery disease were studied in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized crossover trial. All patients were taking concomitant beta blockers. Efficacy was assessed by symptoms, exercise treadmill testing, and ambulatory ST-segment monitoring at baseline and after 6 weeks on each medication. Mean daily dose was titrated to 119 +/- 7 mg (nifedipine GITS) and 342 +/- 59 mg (diltiazem). The addition of either nifedipine GITS or diltiazem resulted in a significant reduction in angina frequency, improvement in exercise treadmill duration (7 vs 7 and 8 minutes; baseline vs nifedipine GITS and diltiazem), time to angina onset (4 vs 7 and 7 minutes; baseline vs nifedipine GITS and diltiazem), and time to ST-segment depression (5 vs 6 and 7 minutes; baseline vs nifedipine GITS and diltiazem). There was no significant difference between nifedipine GITS and diltiazem with respect to the magnitude of improvement in anginal symptoms or exercise test parameters. Both nifedipine GITS and diltiazem reduced the overall frequency and duration of ischemic episodes on ambulatory monitoring, but this reduction was not statistically different. Thus, nifedipine GITS and diltiazem at maximally tolerated doses were equally effective at reducing angina and increasing exercise tolerance as beta blockers alone.",

    "47": "In general, it is recognized that prolonged exposure to catecholamine leads to a reduction in the beta-adrenoceptor density (downregulation). However, it has been previously reported that the myocardial beta-adrenoceptor densities and norepinephrine levels significantly increase in the hearts of BIO 14.6 cardiomyopathic hamsters in the early stage. The mechanism of the increased beta-adrenoceptor density is not clearly elucidated, and it can not be excluded that this phenomenon may be a secondary effect. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of verapamil on the density of beta-adrenoceptors in the heart of BIO 14.6 cardiomyopathic hamsters. The total number of beta-adrenoceptors in untreated BIO 14.6 hamsters was significantly higher at 90 days of age (30.4 +/- 2.2 v.s. 25.9 +/- 1.4 fmol/mg protein, p < 0.05). BIO 14.6 hamsters received daily intraperitoneal injections of 5 mg/kg verapamil for 70 days, from an age of 20 days. Verapamil protected against progressive myocardial damage (total damage; 8.2 +/- 0.7 v.s. 0.4 +/- 0.2%/area, p < 0.05) and the myocardial beta-adrenoceptor density returned to that of the normal control group (26.9 +/- 3.0 fmol/mg protein). Conversely, verapamil did not have an effect on the number of myocardial beta-adrenoceptors in normal golden hamsters. This study showed that verapamil protected against progressive myocardial damage and myocardial beta-adrenoceptor density returned to those of normal hamsters. These results suggest that an increased number of beta-adrenoceptors in the early stage of BIO 14.6 cardiomyopathic hamsters may be involved in the secondary pathogenesis of cardiomyopathy.", 
    "48": "The metabolic interaction between lidocaine (LD) and propranolol (PL) was analysed kinetically in rat liver microsomes. Employing a very short incubation time of 30 sec, we demonstrated that PL competitively inhibited liver microsomal 3-hydroxylation of LD, but did not affect either the formation of monoethylglycinexylidide or methylhydroxylidocaine from LD in PL concentrations up to 1 microM. On the other hand, LD competitively inhibited PL 4-, 5- and 7-hydroxylations, but the inhibition type of LD for PL N-desisopropylation could not be clarified. Comparison of the kinetic data for liver microsomes from Wistar and Dark Agouti rats indicated that among the primary metabolic pathways of LD, the Vmax value for 3-hydroxylation was markedly less in female Dark Agouti rats. The results suggest that LD 3-hydroxylation and PL ring hydroxylations are mediated by the same isozyme(s) belonging to the CYP2D subfamily.", 
    "49": "Adrenergic regulation of RNA synthesis by in vivo stimulated parotid glands and dispersed parotid lobules was studied by a combination of in vivo and in vitro methods. Following a single intraperitoneal injection of isoproterenol, [3H]uridine incorporation into RNA was increased by 50% after the first hour. Amylase mRNA content was also elevated within 1 hr and was 2-3-fold higher than control values at 4 hr. An increase in the rate of total protein synthesis was detectable after 2 hr, and maximal rates were achieved 6 hr after isoproterenol administration. In dispersed parotid lobules, both isoproterenol and epinephrine stimulated [3H]uridine incorporation and at optimal concentrations increased incorporation by almost 200%. Phenylephrine (10 microM) caused a slight increase of about 20% whereas methoxamine (10 microM) had no effect. Stimulation by epinephrine was reversed by propranolol, but not by either phentolamine or prazosin. The increase in RNA synthesis induced by isoproterenol or epinephrine was dose dependent and half-maximal stimulation required 5.0 x 10(-8) M isoproterenol and 7.9 x 10(-7) M epinephrine. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP also stimulated [3H]uridine incorporation, whereas 8-bromo cyclic GMP, A23187 and phorbol myristate acetate had no effect. The importance of protein phosphorylation in mediating the observed stimulation was evaluated using protein kinase and phosphatase inhibitors. N-[2-(Methylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulphonamide, an inhibitor of cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases, substantially diminished the isoproterenol-induced stimulation. Okadaic acid treatment of lobules increased [3H]uridine incorporation. Furthermore, okadaic acid synergistically potentiated the stimulatory effect of a suboptimal concentration of isoproterenol. The results demonstrate that activation of the beta-adrenergic receptor induces the synthesis of certain RNA species in the parotid gland and that protein phosphorylation by a cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase is a key event in the signal transduction pathway.", 
    "50": "Ritanserin (0.5 and 1 mg/kg) and ketanserin (2.5 mg/kg), two antagonists with high affinity for 5-HT2 receptors, attenuated restraint stress-induced hypophagia in rats. Two injections of the 5-HT2 receptor antagonist cinanserin (30 nmol/0.5 microliter) in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus completely reversed the effect of stress on food intake. (+/-)Cyanopindolol (3 and 8 mg/kg), an antagonist at 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors, had no effect whereas 8-hydroxy-2-di-n-propylamino)tetralin (30-300 micrograms/kg), an agonist at 5-HT1A receptors, significantly attenuated the hypophagia. The results suggest that restraint stress-induced hypophagia is mediated by 5-HT2 receptors in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. The potential utility of this model in anorexia nervosa is discussed.", 
    "51": "Although A1 noradrenaline (NA) neurons of the caudal medulla provide a direct, excitatory input to supraoptic vasopressin cells, they do not use NA as their primary transmitter. We have now tested the possibility that adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) may fulfill this role. Extracellular recordings from rat supraoptic nucleus demonstrated that locally applied ATP excites neurosecretory vasopressin cells and that this effect is mimicked by the ATP receptor-agonist alpha,beta-methylene ATP and blocked by the ATP receptor-blocker suramin. Suramin did not block the excitatory effect of locally applied NA on vasopressin cells but did block excitations produced by vagus nerve stimulation, such excitations having previously been shown to involve a pathway in which the final relay is an input from the A1 cell group. These results indicate that certain central NA neurons use ATP as a transmitter and also provide the first demonstration of a specific physiological role for central purinergic neurons, i.e. regulation of secretion of the neurohormone vasopressin.", 
    "52": "Ischemia in active skeletal muscle induces reflex increases in systemic arterial pressure (SAP) and heart rate (HR), termed the muscle metaboreflex. When metaboreflex activation is maintained during postexercise muscle ischemia, SAP remains elevated; however, HR decreases. Why the HR responses differ with metaboreflex activation during exercise vs. during postexercise ischemia while the SAP responses are similar in each setting remains unclear. Two hypotheses were tested: 1) the increase in HR with muscle ischemia occurs predominantly via an increase in sympathetic activity, and 2) sympathetic activity to the heart remains elevated during post-exercise ischemia; however, HR decreases because of an increase in parasympathetic outflow. The muscle metaboreflex was activated in conscious dogs during treadmill exercise (3.2 kph, 0% grade) by progressively decreasing perfusion to the hindlimbs. Experiments were performed before and after muscarinic (atropine) or beta- (atenolol or propranolol) receptor blockade. In control experiments, once beyond the threshold for the reflex, the HR sensitivity of the muscle metaboreflex averaged -2.4 +/- 0.3 beats.min-1.mmHg-1 and the reflex open-loop gain averaged -3.2 +/- 0.3 (calculated as the ratio of the increase in HR or SAP to the decrease in hindlimb perfusion pressure beyond threshold). Atropine had no effect on either HR sensitivity (-2.7 +/- 0.4 beats.min-1.mmHg-1) or open-loop gain (-3.3 +/- 0.5, both P > 0.05 vs. control). However, pretreatment with beta-receptor antagonist significantly decreased both HR sensitivity (-0.7 +/- 0.1 beats.min-1.mmHg-1, P < 0.001) and open-loop gain (-1.9 +/- 0.3, P < 0.01). During postexercise ischemia, HR decreased while SAP remained elevated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "53": "The actions of pure ciguatoxin-1, ciguatoxin-2 and ciguatoxin-3 were assessed on the contractile activity of isolated guinea-pig left atria and ilea. Low concentrations of each ciguatoxin caused transient positive inotropy, whereas moderate concentrations induced transient and sustained positive inotropic phases. The transient positive inotropic phase was inhibited by tetrodotoxin or atenolol, indicating this phase stems from indirect effects of the ciguatoxins via the stimulation of intrinsic adrenergic nerves. On atria pretreated with atropine and alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists to block neural actions of the ciguatoxins, moderate concentrations of each ciguatoxin induced only slowly developing, sustained positive inotropy. ED50s for the indirect positive inotropic phase were 2.7 x 10(-11), 1.6 x 10(-10) and 1.4 x 10(-11) M and for the direct positive inotropic phase were 1.6 x 10(-10), 1.4 x 10(-9) and 1.5 x 10(-9) M for ciguatoxin-1, -2 and -3, respectively, indicating that their effects on neurons are 10-fold (ciguatoxin-1 and -2) to 100-fold (ciguatoxin-3) more potent than those directly on the myocardium. High concentrations of each ciguatoxin additionally induced sustained negative inotropy which could be reversed by lidocaine. On guinea-pig ilea, each ciguatoxin induced a transient contracture which could be abolished by atropine. Each ciguatoxin significantly reduced the contractile response of ilea to nicotine, without affecting the contractile response to acetylcholine. We conclude that ciguatoxin-1, -2 and -3 activate similarly the voltage-dependent Na+ channels in neuronal and myocardial tissues, but vary in their relative affinity for the Na+ channels in these tissues.", 
    "54": "The effects of acute and chronic administration of propranolol and verapamil on heart rate and systolic time intervals were studied in 10 hyperthyroid patients and 10 normal subjects, both groups without signs of cardiovascular or pulmonary disease. In normal subjects iv propranolol reduced heart rate significantly, and both drugs increased the total electromechanical systole significantly without difference between the drugs. This effect was insignificant when the drugs were given orally. In hyperthyroid patients both drugs reduced heart rate significantly in acute and chronic administration, and no difference between the two drugs was found. Neither drug altered cardiac contractility as assessed by systolic time intervals. These results indicate that the metabolic effects of thyroid hormone on contractility were unaltered and unblocked by the drugs. None of the participants developed signs of heart failure. Verapamil can thus be used as an alternative to propranolol in the treatment of tachycardia in hyperthyroidism.",

Each treatment was given for two months. There were no significant differences between the three treatment periods in headache frequency, headache severity, nausea frequency or severity. There was a non-significant trend for reduced duration of headache with the two doses of propranolol. The possible reasons for this negative effect are discussed. The safety of propranolol and its lack of serious side effects were demonstrated.", 
    "56": "A high wavelength fluorescent probe, Nile Red, was added to four proteins, viz., bovine albumin, alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, beta-lactoglobulin and ovomucoid. Nile Red showed an enhancement in fluorescence and a shift in emission wavelength, suggesting it was bonding hydrophobically to these proteins. Drug displacement of Nile Red from alpha 1-acid glycoprotein was achieved with both D,L-propranolol and flufenamic acid, showing that the binding site is less electrostatic and more hydrophobic in nature. In order to monitor these interactions, a simple spectrofluorimeter was constructed from solid-state components; the sensitivity of this instrument compared well with that of standard laboratory spectrofluorimeters.", 
    "57": "Several research groups have reported that in man the oral administration of propranolol with food leads to a marked increase (about 50 per cent) in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUCpo) of this well absorbed and highly metabolized drug. An acute change in hepatic metabolic enzyme activity has been postulated as one of the mechanisms which could be responsible for this observed 'food effect'. The administration of simple carbohydrates such as glucose and fructose has been documented to influence hepatic drug metabolism. Therefore, in the present study, the effect of oral glucose (4 g kg-1 as a 50 per cent aqueous solution) on the disposition kinetics of d-propranolol was examined in male Sprague-Dawley rats (8 to 9 per group). Oral glucose treatment caused a statistically significant decrease (50.4 +/- 12.3 vs 36.6 +/- 15.2 min micrograms ml-1; p < 0.05) in the AUCpo of propranolol when this drug was given by oral intubation (10 mg kg-1). This glucose treatment also caused the apparent mean residence time of propranolol after an oral dose to increase from 0.70 +/- 0.08 h to 1.79 +/- 0.29 h (p < 0.05), but did not change its rate of elimination (suggesting collectively a decreased apparent intrinsic clearance and prolonged drug absorption). In a second study, the same oral glucose treatment was demonstrated to have little impact on the steady state concentrations of propranolol when this drug was infused intraarterially at a constant rate. This confirms that the systemic clearance of propranolol is influenced minimally by the glucose treatment. In a third study, propranolol was infused at a constant rate into the portal vein (pyloric vein infusion) bypassing the processes of intestinal metabolism and absorption (i.e. to remove these sources of variability associated with oral administration). Under these conditions, no significant changes in AUC or apparent mean residence time were observed for the two propranolol doses studied (10 mg kg-1 and 5 mg kg-1). We conclude that the oral glucose and oral propranolol interaction appears to be due to an alteration in the input process before drug enters the liver. Furthermore, this experimental series suggests that studies combining accurate assessments of systemic clearance (constant rate intra-arterial infusion studies), intrinsic hepatic clearance (pyloric vein infusion studies), and oral administration supplemented with necessary protein binding studies may be used together to characterize the mechanism responsible for drug-nutrient and drug-drug interactions.", 
    "58": "Hypertensive patients treated with nonselective beta adrenergic blocking agents may show remarkable hemodynamic changes with administration of epinephrine clinically. We have attempted to investigate the effects of the interaction between beta blockers (a nonselective beta blocker, pindolol, and a cardioselective beta blocker, acebutolol) and a solution of 2% lidocaine containing 1:80,000 epinephrine on the hemodynamics of conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY), as compared with the normotensive rats. The blood pressures (systolic and diastolic) and heart rate were measured indirectly by the photoplethysmographic tail cuff method. All drugs were administered intraperitoneally. We found that: (1) epinephrine with pindolol or acebutolol pretreatment did not cause significant hemodynamic changes in WKY; (2) in SHR, epinephrine in combination with pindolol induced remarkable hemodynamic changes (in particular, increase in diastolic blood pressure), which were prevented by phentolamine pretreatment, whereas epinephrine with acebutolol pretreatment induced no significant hemodynamic changes in these animals; (3) epinephrine in combination with pindolol caused pulmonary congestion or edema in SHR; this was confirmed by both quantitative analysis and histological investigations. These results suggest that pindolol blocked both beta 1 and beta 2 receptors, and therefore, this resulted in exaggerated alpha effects of epinephrine, a remarkable systemic vasoconstriction, and pulmonary congestion. In a clinical setting, great caution should be paid to the hypertensive patients, who are being treated with nonselective beta blockers, if epinephrine-containing local anesthetics are administered.", 
    "59": "We have examined direct effects of catecholamines on testicular testosterone production in a seasonally breeding species, the Siberian hamster, Phodopus sungorus. Testicular parenchyma from gonadally active long photoperiod (LD)-exposed and gonadally regressed short photoperiod (SD)-exposed animals was incubated for 6 h with norepinephrine, epinephrine, beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol, or alpha-adrenoreceptor agonist phenylephrine (all at 10 microM), as well as with various concentrations of norepinephrine (10 nM-10 microM), and 10 microM norepinephrine with or without hCG (0.7, 3.1, and 12.5 mIU/ml). In addition, effects of alpha-adrenoreceptor antagonist prazosin and beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist propranolol (50 microM) were tested in the incubations containing 10 microM norepinephrine. In the incubations of testes from both LD and SD Siberian hamsters, norepinephrine was most effective in stimulating testosterone production, followed by epinephrine and phenylephrine, while isoproterenol failed to increase testosterone accumulation. The stimulatory effects of norepinephrine were dose-dependent and were prevented by coincubation with prazosin, but not affected by coincubation with propranolol. In combination with various doses of hCG, norepinephrine failed to stimulate testosterone production above the levels obtained with hCG alone. These data indicate that the testicular receptors mediating the action of catecholamines on testicular steroidogenesis in Phodopus sungorus are of the alpha 1-subtype, a result in accordance with a previous study in the golden hamster. However, the results of the present study are strikingly different from the findings obtained in the golden hamster in terms of the effects of photoperiod on the responsiveness of testicular steroidogenesis to catecholamines.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "60": "1. A method for reproducing relaxation of human isolated detrusor smooth muscle in vitro in response to electrical field stimulation is described. 2. The parameters of stimulation associated with relaxation were those which would be expected to give a largely nerve-mediated response: the relaxations were not reduced by tetrodotoxin (3 x 10(-7) M) and were therefore not dependent on voltage sensitive sodium channels. 3. The relaxations were decreased (mean 74.1%) by nitro L-arginine (NOARG, 10(-5) M). 4. Methylene blue (10(-5) M), an inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase, abolished the relaxations. 5. These results indicate that there may be a relaxation mechanism in the human bladder which is at least partly mediated via the production of nitric oxide.", 
    "61": "Subject acceptance of a single dose of timolol and levobunolol was compared in a three-center, double-masked, randomized, crossover study in healthy normal subjects. We tested 115 subjects who received the medications OU, in a random order, separated by a washout period of three to seven days. At the end of the administration, the subjects were asked to report any symptoms and were monitored by ophthalmologic examination. Those receiving levobunolol reported a two- to threefold higher frequency of symptoms than did those receiving timolol (P = .0002, by Mainland-Gart chi-square test). Thirty-five subjects (30.4%) treated with levobunolol complained of burning versus 14 (12.2%) receiving timolol (P = .0021). Similar results were obtained in regard to stinging (31 versus 10 subjects; P = .0011). The duration of these symptoms did not differ between the two groups (P > .05). Timolol induced considerably less burning and stinging on day 1 compared with levobunolol, using a visual analog scale over time (P = .0004). Seventy-nine percent of those stating a preference chose timolol (P < 3 x 10(-9).", 
    "62": "Both the selection of doses of pharmaceutical agents and comparisons between pharmaceutical agents have long been based on the nonquantified concept of the risk-benefit ratio. Though useful, this concept implies a data comparison that is difficult to make: the toxicity versus the efficacy of a drug compound. This research demonstrates an approach for weighing risks and benefits by combining utility functions for human efficacy and toxicity with animal and laboratory toxicity information to develop an overall multiattribute utility function for an ophthalmic pharmaceutical agent, I-bunolol, intended for the treatment of glaucoma. With this multiattribute function and a small portion of the published data available for this drug, the expected utilities for six doses (including a control) could be compared and the value of this approach in drug-dosage selection demonstrated.", 
    "63": "The study investigates the change in angiotensinogen (Aogen), angiotensin I (AngI) and renin plasma concentration after nephrectomy and adrenalectomy. The aim of the study was to elucidate the mechanisms that are involved in the up regulation of the Aogen plasma levels after nephrectomy and the contribution of the adrenals. Rats were treated with the beta 1-selective adrenoceptor blocker, atenolol, and with the angiotensin antagonist, DuP 753 in order to inhibit renal renin release and to check whether the increase in plasma Aogen after nephrectomy is mediated by angiotensin (AngII), respectively. The plasma Aogen levels increase approx. 5-fold 24 h after nephrectomy. This increase is significantly reduced in the presence of atenolol. After nephrectomy plus adrenalectomy there is a maximal increase of 60% in plasma Aogen levels 8 h after surgery and a subsequent decline. In the presence of atenolol this increase is even smaller. In contrast after adrenalectomy the plasma Aogen levels continuously declined. In the presence of atenolol the plasma Aogen levels were approx. 20% higher at time 0 but declined with the same slope as after adrenalectomy without atenolol treatment. Treatment with DuP 753 caused an almost complete inhibition of the increase in Aogen plasma levels after nephrectomy. Significantly higher Aogen levels were found only after 24 h. At time 0, immediately after nephrectomy the plasma AngI levels were increased compared to the respective control rats. Significantly higher AngI values (P < 0.05) could also be observed in nephrectomized rats and in nephrectomized plus adrenalectomized rats at time 0 in the presence and absence of atenolol and DuP 753, respectively. In contrast after adrenalectomy alone the AngI levels at time 0, were not different from those of the controls. Subsequently the AngI levels increased at a similar rate as after adrenalectomy in the presence of atenolol. These findings suggest that the increase in plasma Aogen after nephrectomy is essentially mediated by AngII via an adrenal mechanism. It seems likely that this process is triggered by renin released during surgery. The increased renin release after adrenalectomy that is responsible for the increased degradation of Aogen seems not to be mediated by a sympathetic stimulation of the renal beta 1-adrenoceptors.", 
    "64": "Investigated the adverse sexual effects of two antihypertensive drugs, atenolol and slow-release nifedipine, in a placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover study. Subjects were 16 older men (mean age = 66.6 years, SEM = 1.4) with mild to moderate hypertension. Subjects completed daily self-reports on 13 measures of sexuality: frequency of desire, coitus, noncoital partner sex, masturbation, morning erections, spontaneous erections, orgasms in coitus and masturbation, firmness of morning, masturbatory and coital erections, and subjective pleasure in coitus and masturbation. Except for a significant decrease in masturbatory erectile firmness with nifedipine therapy, variables did not differ between the two drug treatments or between either drug and placebo. Although the sample was relatively small, small differences between treatment means suggest that these antihypertensive agents are fairly benign relative to sexual function in men.", 
    "65": "The regional transport properties of the porcine gallbladder epithelium were studied using Ussing chambers in which tissues were bathed in porcine Ringer solution. Under basal conditions, tissues from the neck absorbed Na and Cl. Fundic tissues also absorbed Na, but net Cl transport was not different from zero. Serosal norepinephrine (NE; 0.1 microM) stimulated Na and Cl absorption in the neck but only Cl absorption in the fundus. The effects of NE on Na and Cl transport were blocked by pretreatment with yohimbine, suggesting that alpha 2-adrenoceptors mediate the transport-related actions of this neurotransmitter. Serosal isoproterenol (0.1 microM) produced a tetrodotoxin-insensitive, propranolol-sensitive increase in the short-circuit current (Isc) in fundic tissues but not in tissues from the neck. The beta 2-adrenergic agonist salbutamol produced a response similar to that of isoproterenol. However, the beta 1-adrenergic agonist dobutamine had no effect. Isoproterenol was 5.8-fold more potent than salbutamol in increasing the Isc. A possible explanation for the regional effects of beta-agonists is that beta-adrenoceptors are localized to epithelial cells in the fundic region. These results and results obtained previously suggest regional differences in basal Na and Cl transport across the porcine gallbladder epithelium and that both alpha 2- and beta 2-adrenoceptors act to regulate ion transport in this tissue.", 
    "66": "We investigated effects of bolus administration of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) on parameters of cardiac activity in isolated working rat hearts. Effects at a dose of 5 micrograms of CRF were compared in hearts perfused with Krebs-Henseleit solution, norepinephrine (NE, 10(-9) M), propranolol (3 x 10(-6) M), NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA, 3 x 10(-5) M), or indomethacin (3 x 10(-5) M). CRF increased coronary flow for > 30 min (P < 0.01) with maximum increases of 31.7%, suggesting a prolonged vasodilatory action of the peptide. CRF, in addition, induced transient (lasting < 10 min) increases in maximum aortic pressure and oxygen consumption (P < 0.01), suggesting an inotropic action of the peptide. Perfusions of NE and propranolol did not change the cardiac response to CRF. L-NNA, inhibiting release of endothelium-derived relaxant factor (EDRF), and indomethacin diminished the vasodilatory response to CRF, as indicated by significantly shortened increases in coronary flow after CRF (P < 0.05). Indomethacin also enhanced peak increases in maximum aortic pressure after CRF (P < 0.01). The data confirm direct effects of CRF on cardiac activity. They also suggest that the mediation of coronary vasodilation by CRF involves the endothelial release of prostacyclin and EDRF.", 
    "67": "Administration of the autonomic antagonists atropine (1 mg/kg body wt), propranolol (2 mg/kg body wt), and phenoxybenzamine (2 mg/kg body wt) before the dietary change from all liquid to solid chow prevented an increase in uptake of [3H]thymidine into DNA of rat parotid gland associated with this dietary change. Administration of either the cholinergic antagonist alone or the adrenergic antagonists alone produced partial inhibition. The effects of complete autonomic blockade were not reversed when nerve growth factor (NGF) or epidermal growth factor (EGF) was given immediately after administration of antagonists. The effects of complete autonomic blockade were similar to those seen with surgical removal of the autonomic nerves to the parotid. The increased levels of beta 1-4-galactosyltransferase seen with the dietary change were not evident in rats given both muscarinic and adrenergic antagonists before the change to solid food nor did NGF or EGF reverse these inhibitory effects. Histological observation showed that the surgically denervated gland was morphologically less homogenous than the gland of rats given the antagonists and had infiltrating connective tissue. Nonetheless, with the reduced acinar cell pool, the [3H]thymidine uptake of the denervated parotid and that of antagonist-injected animals was similar.",

    "72": "The effects of the addition of slow-release nifedipine 20 mg twice daily and nisoldipine 10 mg twice daily to atenolol monotherapy were compared in a double-blind placebo-controlled study of 24 patients with chronic stable angina pectoris. Neither nisoldipine nor nifedipine was associated with significant subjective benefit at these doses. Two hours post-dosing, exercise capacity improved after both nisoldipine (duration + 37 s, P < 0.01; time to angina + 67 s, P < 0.01; time to significant ST depression + 60 s, P < 0.01) and nifedipine (duration + 21 s, ns; time to angina + 56 s, P < 0.05; time to significant ST depression + 49 s P < 0.05). However, this improvement was not maintained 12 h post-dosing. Ambulatory monitoring did not demonstrate a significant reduction in the amount of silent or total ischaemia following the addition of either nifedipine or nisoldipine to atenolol monotherapy. There was no significant difference between nifedipine and nisoldipine in any parameter tested. In conclusion, like slow-release nifedipine 20 mg, the effective duration of anti-ischaemic action of nisoldipine 10 mg is less than 12 h. Since several patients experienced vasodilatory unwanted effects, more frequent administration rather than larger individual doses may be desirable to achieve a clinical response.",

Cocaine, 2.5 mg/kg, abruptly increased the time constant of isovolumic ventricular relaxation from 22.9 +/- 1.2 to 29 +/- 2.2 msecs at 1 min (p < .05) and to 35.3 +/- 2 msec at 40 mins (p < .01) but did not significantly change the mean arterial pressure, left atrial pressure, heart rate, coronary blood flow, or the maximum rate of left ventricular pressure increase [(dP/dt)max]. Cocaine also progressively displaced the electrocardiographic ST segments by 3.2 +/- 0.6 mm (p < .01) over 40 mins.

Cocaine did not significantly change either the mean arterial or left atrial pressures. However, this dose of cocaine did decrease, over 40 mins, the heart rate from 184 +/- 11 to 139 +/- 11 beats/min (p < .01) and reduced coronary blood flow by 20% (p < .01). Cocaine also displaced the electrocardiographic ST segments by 3.3 mm over 40 mins (p < .05).

When the rats were injected with the adrenergic blocking agents, timolol or phenoxybenzamine, 1 h before the burn, the activities of the succinate respiratory chain was partly inhibited 30 min postburn.

(co-amiloride) in 100 men with mild to moderate hypertension. Data from 48 subjects controlled adequately on drug monotherapy and completing 12 months treatment are reported (31 randomized to atenolol and 17 to co-amiloride). Left ventricular mass was measured with the Penn convention at the R and P wave respectively. A significant reduction of LVM was noted after one year in both groups (p < 0.05) when measured at the R, but not at the P wave. Measurements according to American Society of Echocardiography (ASE method) at the Q wave revealed a significant reduction of LV wall thickness (p < 0.01) and an increase of LV internal diameter (p < 0.01) with atenolol. In the co-amiloride group non-significant reductions of LV dimensions were observed. Principally similar changes were observed with measurements at the P wave (National Institute of Heart method) in both groups, but LV wall thickness was greater and LV internal diameter smaller than at the Q wave. With similar effect on LVM, the mechanisms in reducing LVM were different between the two drugs. Left ventricular dimensions differed when assessed with the two methods applied, stressing the need for careful standardization in relation to the cardiac cycle in serial echocardiographic measurements.", 
    "81": "The cohesion parameters of diclofenac and propranolol were determined experimentally. The theoretical partition coefficient (Ps,v) was calculated from the activity coefficient (gamma) and the cohesion parameters of the solvent (delta 1 = delta v), solute (delta 2), and skin (delta s). By using the extended Hildebrand solubility equation, the potential energy of solute-solvent interaction in a given solution was considered to have the gamma value derived from solubility data of diclofenac and propranolol in ethanol-aqueous buffer. Values for experimental permeability coefficients (Kp), which were determined from flux and solubility, were compared with values for the respective Ps,v. For a solvent that consists of ethanol-aqueous buffer exhibiting cohesion parameters in the range of delta v = 18-24 (cal/cm3)1/2, the fluxes increased and the Kp decreased because of the similarity in cohesion parameters of these solvents to the solute. The difference between Ps,v and experimental Kp suggests that ethanol in the solvent affects the membrane and diclofenac and propranolol penetrate through the membrane, possibly solvated by ethanol.",

This article reports 6-month dietary changes and the effect of dietary change on blood pressure. Six-month mean weight change was -4.7 kg in the weight reduction group, -0.3 kg in the Na/K group, and -0.5 kg in the usual-diet group. At 6 months, daily electrolyte excretion had changed in the Na/K intervention group.

Daily potassium output increased from 58.7 to 71.4 mmol in the Na/K group, from 57.0 to 60.5 mmol in the weight reduction group, and from 55.3 to 59.1 mmol in the usual diet group. Analysis of 3-day food records indicated that sodium intake decreased from 141.1 to 85.8 mmol and potassium intake increased from 76.4 to 90.5 mmol.

Following the treatment, the mean atherogenic index was increased from 2.72 to 3.38 (p = 0.012).

    "94": "In order to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the stimulatory effect of perchlorate (ClO4-) on insulin secretion, we have investigated the interaction between this chaotropic anion and the organic calcium antagonist nifedipine. This drug, known as a blocker of L-type calcium channels, was chosen as a tool to test the idea that ClO4- acts on insulin secretion by stimulating the gating of voltage-controlled Ca2+ channels. ClO4- amplified the stimulatory effect of D-glucose on insulin release from perfused pancreas (first and second phases) as well as from isolated islets incubated in static incubations for 60 min. This indicates that ClO4- amplifies physiologically regulated insulin secretion. Nifedipine reduced D-glucose-induced (20 mM) insulin release in a dose-dependent manner with half-maximum effect at about 0.8 microM and apparent maximum effect at 5 microM nifedipine. In the presence of 20 mM D-glucose, the inhibitory effects of 0.5, 1 or 5 microM nifedipine were only slightly, if at all, counteracted by perchlorate. When 12 mM ClO4- and 20 mM D-glucose were combined, calculation of the specific effect of ClO4- revealed that nifedipine produced almost maximum inhibition already at 0.05 microM. Thus, the perchlorate-induced amplification of D-glucose-stimulated insulin release shows higher sensitivity to nifedipine than the D-glucose-effect as such. This supports the hypothesis that perchlorate primarily affects the voltage-sensitive L-type calcium channel in the beta-cell.", 
    "95": "Prolactin release from primary cultured pituitary cells was investigated using a dynamic perifusion system. Although epinephrine (1 mumol/l) produced an elevation in the mean value of the prolactin concentration at the onset of the perifusion, the elevation was not statistically significant, and the overall effect of the epinephrine was to produce an inhibition of prolactin release. The alpha- and D2-receptors of the primary cultured cells were functionally removed by a pretreatment with phenoxybenzamine (0.1 or 1 mumol/l). Since phenoxybenzamine irreversibly inactivates both the adrenergic alpha- and the D2-receptors but does not block the beta-receptors, the enhanced stimulatory action of the epinephrine (1 mumol/l) on the phenoxybenzamine pretreated cells suggests the involvement of adrenergic beta-receptors in prolactin release. Perifusion of isoproterenol (1 mumol/l), a beta-receptor agonist, stimulated prolactin release. This stimulation was blocked by beta-receptor antagonism with propranolol (1 mumol/l) supporting the implication of the beta-receptor in prolactin release. In order to differentiate between beta 1- and beta 2-receptor involvement, we investigated the effects of ICI 118,551 (1 mumol/l) on isoproterenol-induced prolactin release. ICI 118,551, a selective beta 2-receptor antagonist, blocked the stimulatory action of isoproterenol on prolactin release indicating that the beta-receptor responsible for the stimulation of prolactin release belongs to the beta 2-receptor family. Moreover, the demonstration that salbutamol, a selective beta 2-receptor agonist, stimulated prolactin secretion offers further evidence in support of the role of the beta 2-receptor in the stimulation of prolactin release.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "96": "Hypertension is due to disturbance of the complex interplay between numerous known and unknown mechanisms that normally control blood pressure. Antihypertensive agents may, therefore, reduce blood pressure through widely different actions and, at the same time, elicit counterregulatory responses. This is a review of the long-term hemodynamic effects at rest as well as during exercise of nine relatively new antihypertensive compounds: a beta-blocker (epanolol), an alpha-receptor blocker (doxazosin), two double-acting compounds (dilevalol and carvedilol), three calcium antagonists (amlodipine, felodipine, and diltiazem), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (lisinopril), a serotonin antagonist (ketanserin), and low-salt diet as a nonpharmacological treatment in 171 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. The results in the treatment groups are compared to the hemodynamic changes seen in 28 hypertensive patients left untreated for 10 years. The patient populations of the different groups were comparable. The invasive hemodynamic technique, including intraarterial blood pressure recording and measurements of cardiac output by Cardigreen, was the same in all studies. While blood pressure remained nearly unchanged in the untreated group, all antihypertensive compounds induced significant and sustained blood pressure reduction both at rest and during exercise. The modest reduction (3-5%) in blood pressure during a low-salt diet was also statistically significant. This review shows the multiplicity of the long-term hemodynamic changes, ranging from a reduction in cardiac output to peripheral vasodilatation, during chronic antihypertensive therapy. In untreated hypertensives, the cardiac output is reduced by 1-2% per year and total peripheral resistance is increased by 2-3% per year. The review also focuses on counterregulatory responses and modify the initial reduction in blood pressure after drug treatment for hypertension. It is concluded that proper understanding of the hemodynamic effects of antihypertensive agents is useful in the selection of the right treatment for specific groups of hypertensive patients.", 
    "97": "The effect of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine (PE, 1-10 microM) and the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline (ISO, 1-10 microM) on protein synthesis and ultrastructure of ventricular cardiomyocytes from adult rat in culture (6 days in medium 199 plus 20% fetal calf serum) was studied. In these cultures cardiomyocytes were spread, but not spontaneously contractile. ISO and PE significantly increased total cell protein and incorporation of (14C)-phenylalanine within 24 h of exposure. These effects were inhibited by the antagonists propranolol and prazosin, respectively. The incorporation of (14C)-uridine was stimulated only by PE but not ISO. Induction of fetal BB-isoform of cytosolic creatine kinase was also caused only by PE but not ISO. The ultrastructure of PE-treated cardiomyocytes was altered as compared to controls, by a greater number of Golgi complexes, denser myofibrillar structures and the appearance of paracrystalline bands in mitochondrial matrices. In conclusion, in this culture model the protein synthesis of cardiomyocytes can be stimulated, independently of the contractility, by either alpha 1- or beta-adrenoceptor agonists. Catecholamines differ, however, in their effects on specific cellular proteins and structures. Only alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation leads to a \"fetal shift\" in the expression of CK-isoforms.", 
    "98": "The purpose of the present study was to investigate the presence of putative cardiac beta 3-adrenoceptors mediating chronotropic and inotropic responses in normal subjects. Isoprenaline (a known beta 1, beta 2 and beta 3-agonist) was infused to stimulate cardiac beta-adrenoceptors in the presence of antagonists at beta 1 (atenolol 25 mg) and beta 1/beta 2 (nadolol 5 mg, 20 mg and 80 mg) adrenoceptor subtypes. Dose-ranging with nadolol was performed to evaluate the lowest dose required to produce significant beta 2-blockade, since the higher doses might conceivably cause beta 3-blockade. Doppler echocardiography was used to evaluate stroke distance and minute distance, which are the linear analogues of stroke volume and cardiac output respectively. Nadolol 5 mg produced almost complete blunting of finger tremor (beta 2-blockade) whilst atenolol 25 mg had no significant effect. Chronotropic and Doppler minute distance responses to isoprenaline were consistent with stimulation of both beta 1 and beta 2-adrenoceptors with no evidence of a beta 3-mediated effect. However, isoprenaline produced an increase in systolic blood pressure and left ventricular stroke distance that was not attenuated by a dose of nadolol (20 mg) which produced complete blunting of beta 1 and beta 2-mediated responses. This infers the possibility of functional inotropic or lusitropic beta 3-adrenoceptors in the human heart. This study also brings into question possible differences in the validity of using stroke distance and systolic blood pressure as measures of inotropic response to beta-adrenoceptor stimulation and advocates the use of Doppler echocardiography as an additional tool for this purpose.",

Competition curves of [125I]-pindolol in the presence of ICI 118,551, a selective beta 2 antagonist, or CGP 20712A, a selective beta 1 antagonist, were best explained by a two-site binding model (48 +/- 5% beta 1 and 52 +/- 4% beta 2 receptors). In isolated coronary strips, isoproterenol induced a dose-dependent vasorelaxant effect which was blocked by either ICI 118,551 (100 nM) or CGP 20712A (100 nM). Dilevalol produced about 30-40% of vasodilating activity starting at a concentration of 100 nM. The response was antagonized selectively by ICI 118,551 suggesting that dilevalol produces vasodilation through the stimulation of beta 2 receptors. These findings show that in the human coronary artery both beta 1 and beta 2 receptor subtypes are present and mediate vasodilation. This suggests that the human coronary artery could be used for the evaluation of the vasodilating component of new beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents.", 
    "100": "If postpartum rats are separated from pups following cesarean delivery, their maternal responsiveness declines such that in tests on day 10 they show maternal onset latencies that do not differ from those shown by virgin rats. If, however, dams are permitted a 1-h experience with pups within 36 h of cesarean delivery, rats exhibit a high level of responsiveness to foster pups on day 10 after c-section. The present research investigates the effect of the noradrenergic system in the long-term consolidation of a brief maternal experience in new mother rats. Groups of dams were cesarean delivered and were either given pups for a brief period 36 h after section (experienced) or received no experience (inexperienced). Immediately following the experience phase, dams were injected with different concentrations of the beta-adrenergic antagonist, propranolol (0, 0.5, 1.0, 5.0 mg/kg), or the adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol (0, 0.25 or 0.5 mg/kg). Ten days after cesarean delivery rats were given maternal induction tests. Rats receiving 60 min of experience and injected with propranolol exhibited significantly longer maternal onset latencies than did saline-injected rats, although their latencies were not as long as shown by the maternally inexperienced groups. In contrast, rats receiving 15 min of experience and injected with isoproterenol exhibited significantly shorter onset latencies than did saline-injected rats, whether or not they exhibited maternal behavior during the initial 15 min exposure period. These results suggest that the noradrenergic system is involved in the consolidation of a maternal experience.", 
    "101": "Several laboratories have shown that isoproterenol induces or accelerates cell process formation in primary astrocyte cultures. These observations, together with the demonstration of beta-adrenergic receptors in astrocytes isolated from adult rat brain, led us to test the hypothesis that beta-antagonists prevent astrocyte hypertrophy in the injured spinal cord. Since blood-borne macrophages express beta-adrenergic receptors and release cytokines acting on glial cells, we avoided physical trauma and induced glial scar formation indirectly by injecting the cytotoxic ligand Ricinus communis into the sciatic nerve. Seven days later sections of the lumbar spinal cord in regions of motor neuron degeneration were processed for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunocytochemistry. Astrocyte hypertrophy was evaluated by optical density measurements of immunolabeled GFAP. Seven days after ricin treatment there is a mean increase of GFAP in the ventral horn of 11.8 +/- 4.4% (P < 0.0001) compared to the intact side. When L-propranolol is continuously infused from a subcutaneously implanted osmotic pump at a concentration calculated to produce a free plasma level of 4.4 nM, the GFAP increase is only 3.2 +/- 3%, reflecting a 73% reduction in astrocyte hypertrophy (P < 0.001). Receptor autoradiography with the ligand [125I]iodocyanopindolol showed a 26% increase in beta-adrenergic receptor density on the gliotic side. After propranolol treatment, there was only a 3.5% increase in ventral horn beta-adrenergic receptor density in the region of the glial scar.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "102": "1. In order to elucidate the mechanism underlying the positive inotropic effect (PIE) of angiotensin II (AII), we measured changes in phosphoinositide hydrolysis and contractile force induced by AII in the rabbit ventricular myocardium. 2. AII (1.0 nM-3 microM) produced a PIE in a concentration-dependent manner in the presence of bupranolol (0.3 microM) and prazosin (0.1 microM), the maximal response being about 40% of that to isoprenaline and the EC50 30 nM. 3. The PIE of AII was associated with a concentration-dependent increase in the total duration of contraction; the time to peak force and the relaxation time were prolonged. 4. AII (10 nM-30 microM) elicited an accumulation of [3H]-inositol monophosphate in a concentration-dependent manner in rabbit ventricular slices prelabelled with myo-[3H]-inositol. 5. The PIE and the accumulation of [3H]-inositol monophosphate induced by AII were inhibited by a non-selective AII receptor antagonist, saralasin (10 nM-1 microM) and by a selective AT1 receptor antagonist, losartan (10 nM-1 microM), but not a selective AT2 receptor antagonist, PD 123319 (1 microM). 6. A tumour-promoting phorbol ester, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu, 10-100 nM), inhibited the AII-induced PIE and [3H]-inositol monophosphate accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner. 7. These results suggest that AII exerts a PIE through activation of AT1 receptors and subsequent acceleration of phosphoinositide hydrolysis. Activation of protein kinase C by PDBu may inhibit the AII-induced stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis and thereby the PIE of AII in the rabbit ventricular myocardium.", 
    "103": "d-Sotalol was developed as an antiarrhythmic agent with a relative lack of antagonist activity at beta-adrenergic receptors. Exercise heart rate reduction has been observed after administration to humans. The purpose of this study was to determine directly whether this effect of d-sotalol was attributable to beta-blockade. Plasma samples from normal volunteers who randomly received either atenolol, d-sotalol, or placebo were used in an in vitro radioreceptor assay to determine occupancy of beta 1-adrenergic receptors by antagonist present in the plasma. Occupancy was compared with the observed pharmacologic effects. A reduction in exercise heart rate of 7.7% +/- 3.8% for d-sotalol and 15.9% +/- 3.0% for atenolol occurred with beta 1-adrenergic receptor occupancy of 0% and 33.9% +/- 21.4%, respectively. Absence of antagonist effect in the radioreceptor assay eliminates the potential role of beta 1-blockade in d-sotalol-induced heart rate reduction. This effect is most likely a result of prolongation of the sinus node action potential duration.", 
    "104": "Hepatocytes from chronically endotoxemic rats, or appropriate saline controls, were maintained in primary culture for 3 or 20 h. The ability of a variety of hormones to stimulate glycogen phosphorylase a was examined. At 3 h in culture, hepatocytes from endotoxemic rats had lower basal activities and exhibited impaired response to vasopressin, angiotensin II, and, to a lesser extent, norepinephrine and glucagon. The norepinephrine response was predominantly of the alpha-type in the saline rats but mixed alpha- and beta-type in the endotoxic cells. After 20 h in culture, vasopressin and angiotensin II responses were still impaired, while norepinephrine and glucagon responses were similar to those seen in the saline cells. The response to norepinephrine was predominantly of the beta-type in the endotoxic cells but still of the alpha-type in the saline cells. The results show that multiple mechanisms are involved in endotoxin-mediated inhibition of glycogen phosphorylase a activity and that alterations in intracellular calcium homeostasis play more of a significant role than adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate-mediated processes in diminished responsiveness of the liver seen in endotoxemia.", 
    "105": "The chronotropic responsiveness to norepinephrine (NE) and isoproterenol (ISO) was determined in right atria isolated from rats submitted to repeated escapable or inescapable foot-shock. Significant postjunctional supersensitivity to ISO, but not to NE, was observed in both groups. No significant change in the pA2 value of metoprolol (a selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist) was detected. However, a decrease of the maximum response to soterenol, a partial agonist at beta 1-adrenoceptors, occurred only after inescapable foot-shock. The enhanced sensitivity to ISO was abolished by butoxamine (a selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist) and accompanied by a marked increase in the pA2 value of this antagonist. We conclude that the ability to control the shock prevented the down-regulation of the pacemaker beta 1-adrenoceptors but not the increased participation of beta 2-adrenoceptors in the response of the rat sinoatrial node to catecholamines after repeated foot-shock.", 
    "106": "Stimulus control was established in rats using either 8-hydroxy-2-[di-n-propylamino]tetralin (DPAT) (0.2 mg/kg) or yohimbine (3 mg/kg). Tests were then conducted with purported antagonists at 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A) receptors. Drugs studied were NAN-190, [+/-]-pindolol, and [-]-alprenolol. In addition, each drug was characterized in terms of its affinity for 5-HT1A and alpha 2-adrenoceptors by means of radioligand binding techniques. None of the antagonists tested provided complete blockade of the stimulus effects of either DPAT or yohimbine. However, [+/-]-pindolol produced a statistically significant intermediate degree of antagonism of both DPAT and yohimbine. The affinities of DPAT, yohimbine, and NAN-190 for the 5-HT1A and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors, respectively, were sufficiently high to lead to some ambiguity of interpretation of the behavioral data. However, the results with [+/-]-pindolol, which has high affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor (34 nM) and negligible affinity for the alpha 2-adrenoceptor (24,600 nM), indicate that a significant component of yohimbine-induced stimulus control is mediated by the 5-HT1A receptor.", 
    "107": "The number of beta 1-adrenergic receptor (beta 1AR) binding sites is decreased by chronic antidepressant treatments, including electroconvulsive seizure (ECS) and imipramine, whereas administration of agents that deplete norepinephrine (NE) increases the number of beta 1AR binding sites in cerebral cortex. The present study was carried out to examine the influence of these treatments on levels of beta 1AR mRNA in frontal cortex to study the molecular mechanisms that underlie the regulation of beta 1ARs in brain. Levels of beta 1AR mRNA were measured by RNase protection analysis using a riboprobe derived from rat beta 1AR cDNA, and the levels of beta AR binding were measured using the nonselective ligand [3H]CGP-12177. Studies to verify the specificity of the RNase protection assay revealed that the distribution of beta 1AR mRNA was in agreement with the reported distribution of beta 1AR ligand binding: Levels of beta 1AR mRNA were highest in cerebral cortex or frontal cortex, intermediate in neostriatum, hippocampus, lung, and heart, and lowest in cerebellum, kidney, and liver. Chronic ECS treatment (once daily for 10 days) significantly decreased levels of beta AR ligand binding and resulted in a corresponding, time-dependent down-regulation of beta 1AR mRNA levels in frontal cortex. However, imipramine administration regulated levels of beta 1AR mRNA in a biphasic manner, with treatments for 7-14 days increasing and treatments for 18-21 days decreasing levels of beta 1AR mRNA in frontal cortex. In contrast, levels of [3H]CGP-12177 ligand binding were decreased at all time points examined (3-21 days).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "108": "beta-Adrenergic modulation is one of the most important regulatory mechanisms of ion channel function. Only recently, however, have beta-adrenergic effects on cardiac Na+ channel activity been recognized, and some diversity of effects has been reported in different preparations. We report studies of protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation effects on cardiac Na+ current using the macropatch on-cell mode voltage-clamp technique to maintain cytoplasmic composition intact. During the first 5 minutes after addition of 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)cAMP to the bath, the midpoints of both voltage-dependent availability and conductance shifted in the hyperpolarizing direction an average of -7.5 +/- 2.8 mV (n = 31). Moreover, these effects were not species specific; similar results were obtained in canine, rabbit, and guinea pig myocytes, and a similar shift occurred after exposure to 5 microM isoproterenol. Maximum conductance did not change, nor did single-channel conductance. The shifts of conductance and voltage-dependent availability that were induced by protein phosphorylation were distinct from and independent of the slow background shift in kinetics. We measured the background shift to be less than 0.3 mV/min and to be restricted to the channels within the patch. Pretreatment of cells with a blocker of protein kinase, N-[2-(p-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinoline sulfonamide (H-89), prevented the effect of 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)cAMP while not affecting the background shift in kinetics. Although clearly not the result of addition of a negatively charged phosphate to the inside face of the channel, cAMP-dependent phosphorylation affects the voltage-dependent kinetics, as expected, by an electrostatic interaction with the voltage sensor.", 
    "109": "Considering the high lipophilicity of propranolol (log P = 3.56), its interactions with the cell membrane lipids of goat blood have been investigated. It is observed that lipid loss after incubation of blood cells with propranolol hydrochloride in salt glucose medium for varying periods of time was accompanied with significant increases in PUFAs. Amongst the PUFAs studied the omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids, the two important precursors of eicosenoids, have shown increase in varying amounts. This phenomenon is presumably responsible for the significant cardiovascular activity of this drug.", 
    "110": "The effects of atenolol (100 mg/day) and nifedipine (60 mg/day) on angina symptoms and exercise tolerance were compared in an open, randomized study. Twelve-week treatment period was compared with two weeks of placebo treatment in 51 patients with chronic stable angina pectoris. Mean frequency of angina attacks decreased significantly from 8.3 to 1.6 attacks per week after atenolol treatment (p < or = 0.05). Both drugs increased exercise tolerance to development of signs of ischemia on electrocardiogram (p < or = 0.05) and increased maximal exercise tolerance as well (p < or = 0.05). Mean ST segment depressions at peak exercise were significantly decreased after treatment with atenolol and nifedipine (p < or = 0.05). Both drugs also increased total exercise capacity in comparison with placebo period, stated as 100%:192% after atenolol and to 191% after nifedipine. No significant changes of heart rate and blood pressure were noted during treatment period. Twelve patients did not finished study, two of them suffered myocardial infarction with death in one of them (atenolol group, other one nifedipine group). Thus, atenolol in one daily dose is as effective as nifedipine in chronic stable angina patients when administered as single therapy.", 
    "111": "Plasma and aqueous humour concentrations and systemic effects of timolol and betaxolol were studied after ocular administration in 45 patients scheduled for extracapsular cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation. The patients were divided randomly into three groups and received 40 microliters of either 0.5% betaxolol, 0.25% timolol or placebo into the lower cul-de-sacs of both eyes. Blood samples were collected over a period of 4 h and blood pressure and heart rate were monitored during the study. Aqueous humour samples were aspirated at the beginning of the operation. Plasma and aqueous humour concentrations of timolol and betaxolol were analyzed using a sensitive radioreceptor assay. The mean plasma concentrations of betaxolol were lower than those of timolol. The concentration of betaxolol in the aqueous humour was twice as high as the concentration of timolol. Both drugs produced a significant decrease in heart rate. In the timolol group a decrease in heart rate was found 15 min after drug administration, and in the betaxolol group after one hour.", 
    "112": "Calcium-antagonist and B-blockers are effective in improving exercise tolerance in patients with effort angina. We studied the short effects of oral administration of nifedipine (10 mg) and propranolol (80 mg) alone and in combination in 15 elderly patients with chronic exertional angina pectoris in a double-blind, randomized, cross-over study. The 15 patients (13 men and 2 women, mean age 69 years) performed symptoms-limits bicycle exercise stress test 3 h after placebo or active substance administration. Maximal work load, exercise duration, real time to 1 mm ST segment depression were significantly increased and ST depression at peak exercise was significantly decreased by drug alone and in combination. Propranolol and nifedipine improved exercise duration in combination; however, a different response to the three pharmacologic interventions was found in patients treated with single drug. The improvement in exercises tolerance was associated with rate-pressure product values at peak exercise tolerance was associated with rate-pressure product values at peak exercise, unchanged after placebo and significantly reduced after both propranolol alone and in combination. After placebo all patients had exercise-induced angina, in 50% and in 40% after propranolol and the combination of the two drugs, respectively. In aging patients nifedipine and propranolol are effective in the treatment of effort angina and they are superior in patients who show poor response to mono therapy, although this combination will be conditioned by different patient sensibility to the three pharmacologic interventions and then therapeutic choice would be evaluated and verified individually.", 
    "113": "The effect of changes of airway inflammation on airway nonspecific reactivity were studied in 29 patients with chronic asthma. Detailed examinations of bronchial lavage (BAL) fluid and airway responses to histamine, propranolol and exercise were performed before and after treatment. The patients treated with steroids had significant improvements in parameters of BAL fluid cells and mediators with consistent changes of decreasing airway reactivities to propranolol and exercise after treatment. Whereas no significant changes occurred in the patients treated with B2-agonist either in inflammatory parameters or airway responses. On the other hand, airway response to histamine changed little in all asthmatic patients. Our study implied that inhibiting the airway inflammation in asthmatics may lead to marked decrease of airway response to non-mediator stimuli but fail to attenuate bronchial hyperresponse to mediator stimuli like histamine.", 
    "114": "We investigated the effects of class III antiarrhythmic agents, d-sotalol, E-4031 and MS-551, on the currents of two cloned K channels, Kv1.2 (IKv1.2) and Kv1.4(IKv1.4), by using the Xenopus oocyte expression system. Both IKv1.2 and IKv1.4 were sensitive to 4-aminopyridine and quinidine, but insensitive to tetraethylammonium, d-sotalol, E-4031 and MS-551. The results suggest that some types of structural proteins may be necessary for class III agents to inhibit the cardiac cloned K channels."
