    "0": "Heart failure affects \u22485.7 million people in the United States alone. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, \u03b2-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists have improved mortality in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction, but mortality remains high. In July 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the first of a new class of drugs for the treatment of heart failure: Valsartan/sacubitril (formerly known as LCZ696 and currently marketed by Novartis as Entresto) combines the angiotensin receptor blocker valsartan and the neprilysin inhibitor prodrug sacubitril in a 1:1 ratio in a sodium supramolecular complex. Sacubitril is converted by esterases to LBQ657, which inhibits neprilysin, the enzyme responsible for the degradation of the natriuretic peptides and many other vasoactive peptides. Thus, this combined angiotensin receptor antagonist and neprilysin inhibitor addresses 2 of the pathophysiological mechanisms of heart failure: activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and decreased sensitivity to natriuretic peptides. In the Prospective Comparison of ARNI With ACEI to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and Morbidity in Heart Failure (PARADIGM-HF) trial, valsartan/sacubitril significantly reduced mortality and hospitalization for heart failure, as well as blood pressure, compared with enalapril in patients with heart failure, reduced ejection fraction, and an elevated circulating level of brain natriuretic peptide or N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide. Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating the role of valsartan/sacubitril in the treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and hypertension. We review here the mechanisms of action of valsartan/sacubitril, the pharmacological properties of the drug, and its efficacy and safety in the treatment of heart failure and hypertension.", 
    "1": "A 57-year-old man with iron deficiency anaemia developed general malaise, exertional dyspnoea and features of cardiac failure out of proportion to his anaemia (haemoglobin 120 g/L). Investigations showed a severely dilated left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 15%, due to dilated cardiomyopathy. He was treated with high-dose diuretics, ACE inhibitors and \u03b2-blocker therapy. Subsequent investigation into his iron deficiency anaemia revealed a new diagnosis of coeliac disease. After starting a gluten-free diet, his cardiac function improved markedly, with ejection fraction reaching 70%, allowing his cardiac medications to be withdrawn. This case suggests a link between coeliac disease and cardiomyopathy.", 
    "2": "In order to evaluate whether cardiologists follow guidelines, we studied patients who were seen for a preoperative cardiologic consultation prior to surgery.", 
    "3": "This retrospective study took place in two surgical units (Vascular and Orthopaedic) in two different university hospitals in 2013. The patient eligibility criteria were: planned elective surgery, cardiologic consultation prior to anaesthesiology consultation and lack of any unstable cardiac condition. The primary endpoint was determination of appropriate use of preoperative cardiac stress exams (CSE).", 
    "4": "The study included 238\u00a0patients who were seen by 131\u00a0different cardiologists. Of 238\u00a0patients, 60 had a CSE before surgery, but only 7/60 (12%) were deemed to be necessary. Seven out 15 (47%) patients with an indication for a CSE actually underwent said exam. Sixty-six percent of patients (156/238) had a resting trans-thoracic echocardiography before surgery, while only 27/156 (17%) were considered of appropriate use. Among patients with known coronary arterial disease, 59/73 (81%) received a statin, 60/73 (82%) received an antiplatelet agent, and 38/73 (52%) received a beta-blocker. Among patients with planned arterial surgery, 86/137 (63%) received a statin and 100/137 (73%) patients received an antiplatelet agent. Of the 159\u00a0consultation reports that were examined, only 5 (3%) mentioned the Lee score and 117 (74%) were concluded with \"no contraindication\" or a similar phrase.", 
    "5": "In this study, we found that guidelines were generally not used when cardiologists evaluated patients for non-cardiac surgery. This is evidenced by the number of inappropriate exams performed, the lack of true perioperative risk stratification, and incomplete optimization of long-term treatment regimens.", 
    "6": "Acute decompensated heart failure (HF) is one of most common reasons for hospitalization among individuals older than 65 years. A thorough evaluation, including history, physical examination, and laboratory assessment, is required to optimize care of these patients. In uncertain cases, serum brain-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal proBNP level, stress testing, and/or invasive coronary angiography may be helpful in establishing the diagnosis. The hospital setting provides an opportunity to identify etiologies and stabilize the patient. The primary goal of inpatient HF therapy is systemic and pulmonary decongestion, achieved most effectively using intravenous diuretic therapy. Rate and rhythm control may be needed for patients with concurrent atrial fibrillation and, in American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association stage D HF, intravenous inotropes may become necessary. New pharmacologic or device therapies also are considered as a means of transitioning patients, especially those with severe disease, to the outpatient setting. Patients hospitalized for acute decompensated HF have high postdischarge mortality and rehospitalization rates and, thus, should be monitored carefully.", 
    "7": "Outpatient management of heart failure (HF) is aimed at treating symptoms and preventing hospitalizations and readmissions. Management is initiated in a stepwise approach. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system is a cornerstone of therapy and should be started, along with beta blockers, as soon as the diagnosis of HF is made. Other drugs, including diuretics, aldosterone antagonists, hydralazine, and nitrates, may be added based on symptoms and American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association stage. Despite a great interest in and theoretical benefit of naturoceutical products in the mitigation of oxidative stress and HF progression, none has been proven to be beneficial, and concerns exist regarding their interactions with standard HF drugs. Other nonpharmacologic interventions, including sodium restriction, regular exercise, and/or cardiac rehabilitation, should be initiated at diagnosis. HF often is progressive, and clinicians should be aware of late stage management options, including implantable devices, cardiac transplantation, and hospice care.", 
    "8": "The time rate of blood pressure (BP) variation indicates the speed of BP fluctuations. Previous studies have demonstrated that the time rate of BP variation was associated with target organ damage. However, the association between time rate of BP variation and endothelial function has not been evaluated.24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) was performed in 61 patients with metabolic syndrome. Time rate of BP variation was calculated from BP recordings of ABPM. Endothelial function was assessed using reactive hyperemia-peripheral arterial tonometry index (RHI) by EndoPat2000. Multiple linear regression models were used to detect the association between time rate of BP variation and RHI.Among all the subjects (n = 61), the multiple linear regression models revealed that the daytime rate of systolic blood pressure (SBP) variation was independently associated with RHI (\u03b2 = -0.334, P = 0.008). A 0.1 mmHg/minute increase in the daytime rate of SBP variation correlated with a decline of 0.20 in RHI. The same effect was also found in the subjects with eGFR \u2265 60 mL/ (minute*1.73 m(2)). A greater association was found in those who were not taking a statin, \u03b2-blocker, ACEI/ARB, or diuretic and those without diabetes compared with those with any antihypertensive medication or with diabetes. Other ambulatory blood pressure parameters and central hemodynamics were not found to be associated with RHI.Our findings have shown that the daytime rate of SBP variation was associated with endothelial function in patients with metabolic syndrome, independent of other BP parameters and central hemodynamics.", 
    "9": "This study analyzed the luminance and color emmetropization response in chicks treated with the nonselective parasympathetic antagonist atropine and the sympathetic \u03b2-receptor blocker timolol. Chicks were binocularly exposed (8h/day) for 4days to one of three illumination conditions: 2Hz sinusoidal luminance flicker, 2Hz sinusoidal blue/yellow color flicker, or steady light (mean 680lux). Atropine experiments involved monocular daily injections of either 20\u03bcl of atropine (18nmol) or 20\u03bcl of phosphate-buffered saline. Timolol experiments involved monocular daily applications of 2 drops of 0.5% timolol or 2 drops of distilled H2O. Changes in the experimental eye were compared with those in the fellow eye after correction for the effects of saline/water treatments. Atropine caused a reduction in axial length with both luminance flicker (-0.078\u00b10.021mm) and color flicker (-0.054\u00b10.017mm), and a reduction in vitreous chamber depth with luminance flicker (-0.095\u00b10.023mm), evoking a hyperopic shift in refraction (3.40\u00b11.77D). Timolol produced an increase in axial length with luminance flicker (0.045\u00b10.030mm) and a myopic shift in refraction (-4.07\u00b10.92D), while color flicker caused a significant decrease in axial length (-0.046\u00b10.017mm) that was associated with choroidal thinning (-0.046\u00b10.015mm). The opposing effects on growth and refraction seen with atropine and timolol suggest a balancing mechanism between the parasympathetic and \u03b2-receptor mediated sympathetic system through stimulation of the retina with luminance and color contrast.",

SDB severity was categorized using percent of total sleep time with oxygen saturation <90\u00a0% (%TST\u2009<\u200990) and apnea hypopnea index (AHI). Cardiac conduction parameters were assessed by resting 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG). All analyses were adjusted for age, site, \u03b2-blocker use, coronary heart disease, calcium channel blocker use, and use of antiarrhythmic medications.",

Men with greater nocturnal hypoxemia (%TST\u2009<\u200990\u2009\u2265\u20093.5\u00a0%) compared with those without hypoxemia (%TST\u2009<\u200990\u2009<\u20091.0\u00a0%) had a lower odds of bradycardia (OR 0.55 [0.32-0.94]) and right bundle branch block (RBBB) (OR 0.24 [0.08-0.75]) but a higher odds of ventricular paced rhythm (OR 4.42 [1.29-15.19]). Heart rate (HR) increased in a graded manner with increasing %TST\u2009<\u200990 (p-trend 0.01) and increasing AHI (p-trend 0.006), but these gradients were small in absolute magnitude. There were no associations of SDB measures with other ECG conduction parameters.",

The presented assay enables quantitative determination of acebutolol, atenolol, fenoterol, nadolol, pindolol, procaterol, sotalol, and timolol. In this work, samples were prepared on a high-throughput platform using the 96-well plate format of the thin film solid phase microextraction (TFME) system, and a biocompatible extraction phase made of hydrophilic-lipophilic balance particles. Analytes were separated on a pentafluorophenyl column (100mm\u00d72.1mm, 3\u03bcm) by gradient elution using an UPLC Nexera coupled with an LCMS-8060 mass spectrometer. The mobile phase consisted of water-acetonitrile (0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 0.4mLmin(-1). The linearity of the method was checked within therapeutic blood-plasma concentrations, and shown to adequately reflect typically expected concentrations of future study samples. Post-extraction addition experiments showed that the matrix effect ranged in plasma from 98% for procaterol to 115% for nadolol, and in urine, from 85% for nadolol and pindolol to 119% for atenolol. The method was successfully validated using Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines, and met all acceptance criteria for bioanalytical assays at five concentration levels for all selected drugs. The final protocol can be successfully applied for monitoring concentrations of the selected drugs in both plasma and urine matrices obtained from patients or athletes.",

    "16": "Patients (123: 11 with vascular malformations and 112 with infantile hemangiomas (IH)) were enrolled in the study. They were initially treated with: systemic Pr therapy (2-2.5mg/kg/day) for 6-8months. Following completion of Pr therapy, patients with significant residual lesions (n-61) were treated with photothermolysis (laser therapy).", 
    "17": "Pr therapy had no effect on the color and volume of the vascular malformations. Pr therapy alone demonstrated a reduction in both volume and color of the IH. Laser therapy resulted in a continued improvement in the appearance of the IH with 84% of patients experiencing a residual volume of 0% compared to the original and 89% experiencing a decrease to between 0 and 20% of original color.

On multivariate analysis, gait speed was associated with a lower risk for all-cause death (hazard ratio: 0.62; 95% confidence interval: 0.43 to 0.88) independently of age, ejection fraction <20%, systolic blood pressure, anemia, and absence of beta-blocker therapy. Gait speed was also associated with a lower risk for hospitalization for HF and all-cause hospitalization. When gait speed was added to the multiparametric Cardiac and Comorbid Conditions Heart Failure risk score, it improved the accuracy of risk stratification for all-cause death (net reclassification improvement 0.49; 95% confidence interval: 0.26 to 0.73, p < 0.001) and HF admissions (net reclassification improvement 0.37; 95% confidence interval: 0.15 to 0.58; p < 0.001).",

    "24": "Surgical stress and inflammatory response induce the release of catecholamines and PGs, which may be key factors in facilitating cancer recurrence through immunosuppression. Animal studies have suggested the efficacy of perioperative blockades of catecholamines and PGs in reducing immunosuppression. In this study, to our knowledge, we present the first report of the effects of perioperative propranolol and/or parecoxib on peripheral regulatory T cells (Tregs) in breast cancer patients. Patients were randomly assigned to control, propranolol, parecoxib, and propranolol plus parecoxib groups. We demonstrated that levels of circulating epinephrine, norepinephrine, and PGE2increased in response to surgery. Meanwhile, peripheral FOXP3 mRNA level and Treg frequencies were elevated on postoperative day 7. Propranolol administration, rather than parecoxib, attenuated such elevation of Tregs, indicating the critical roles for catecholamines in surgery-induced promotion of Tregs. Besides, propranolol plus parecoxib treatment demonstrated no additive or synergistic effects. Furthermore, a study of Treg activity on CD4(+)T cell responses to specific tumor Ags was performed in the control and propranolol groups. Propranolol abrogated the increased Treg activity and accompanying suppression of CD4(+)T cell responses after surgery. Finally, we conducted ex vivo experiments on the effects of varying concentrations of epinephrine and/or propranolol on Treg proliferation over PBMCs from breast cancer patients, to provide further direct evidence strengthening our clinical observations. Epinephrine markedly promoted Treg proliferation, whereas propranolol prevented such enhancement effect. In conclusion, our study highlights beneficial roles for propranolol in inhibiting Treg responses in vivo and in vitro, and demonstrates that propranolol could alleviate surgical stress-induced elevation of Tregs in breast cancer patients.",

Out of the total unselected study population we identified 28.0% of patients with symptomatic heart failure (NYHA class II-IV), sinus rhythm, and suboptimal heart rate \u2265 70 bpm. The prevalence of heart rate \u2265 70 bpm was significantly higher in patients with beta-blocker dose < 50% of the target dose according to ESC compared with patients receiving \u2265 50% of the target dose (58.0% vs 52.4%, p < 0.001). Heart rate \u2265 70 bpm was significantly more common in patients with history of hospitalization for heart failure compared with patients who have not been hospitalized (56.8% vs 53.7%, p < 0.05).

The proportion of patients with intended up-titration of the beta-blocker dose was low. Therefore it is necessary to reduce heart rate by alternative or complementary pharmacotherapy.", 
    "36": "Several studies have underlined the beneficial effects of a lower heart rate on mortality in patients with chronic heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. In clinical practice, achieving a heart rate \u226470\u00a0bpm with beta-blockers is not always possible. In this context, the more recent guidelines added ivabradine to the management of those patients if heart rate remains \u226570\u00a0bpm in sinus rhythm and symptoms persist despite treatment with an evidence-based or maximum tolerated dose of a beta-blocker, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blocker, and a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. Ivabradine is a well-tolerated, safe and effective treatment option with the objective to improve prognosis, left ventricular structure and function, exercise tolerance and quality of life.

Among the included trials, 26 RCTs were parallel studies and 30 RCTs were cross-over studies, examining eight beta-1 blockers. Overall, the majority of beta-1 blockers studied significantly lowered systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). In people with mild to moderate hypertension, beta-1 selective blockers lowered BP by an average of -10/-8 mmHg and reduced heart rate by 11 beats per minute. The maximum BP reduction of beta-1 blockers occurred at twice the starting dose. Individual beta-1 blockers did not exhibit a graded dose-response effect on SBP and DBP over the recommended dose range.Most beta-1 blockers tested significantly lowered heart rate. A graded dose-response of beta-1 blockers on heart rate was evident. Higher dose beta-1 blockers lowered heart rate more than lower doses.

The effect of beta-1 blockers at peak hours, -12/-9 mmHg, was greater than the reduction at trough hours, -8/-7 mmHg. Beta-1 selective blockers lowered BP by a greater magnitude than dual receptor beta-blockers and partial agonist beta-blockers, lowered BP similarly to nonselective beta-blockers. Beta-1 selective blockers lowered SBP by a similar degree and lowered DBP by a greater degree than diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. Because DBP is lowered by a similar extent to SBP, beta-1 selective blockers do not reduce pulse pressure.",

The main-stay in the management of pheochromocytoma surgeries is Preoperative preparation which has improved perioperative outcome. Modern anesthetic drugs with advanced monitoring have contributed to intraoperative stability. Resection of the tumor results in acute withdrawal of catecholamines, which may lead to severe hypotension. In perioperative period, adequate hydration should be maintained.

Constructed wetlands have been successfully utilized to remove contaminants from wastewater effluent, including pharmacologically active compounds. However, relatively little is known about the transformation products formed during wetland treatment. In this study, three different wetland microcosm treatments were used to determine the biotransformation products of the \u03b2-adrenoreceptor antagonists atenolol, metoprolol and propranolol. LC/ESI-Q-ToF run in the MS(E) and MS/MS modes was used to identify and characterize the degradation products through the accurate masses of precursor and product ions. The results were compared with those of a reference standard when available. Several compounds not previously described as biotransformation products produced in wetlands were identified, including propranolol-O-sulfate, 1-naphthol and the human metabolite N-deaminated metoprolol. Transformation pathways were significantly affected by microcosm conditions and differed between compounds, despite the compounds' structural similarities. Altogether, a diverse range of transformation products in wetland microcosms were identified and elucidated using high resolving MS. This work shows that transformation products are not always easily predicted, nor formed via the same pathways even for structurally similar compounds.", 
    "58": "The kidney has numerous complex interactions with the heart, including shared risk factors (e.g., hypertension, dyslipidemia, etc.) and mutual amplification of morbidity and mortality. Both cardiovascular diseases and chronic kidney disease (CKD) may cause various alterations in cardiovascular system, metabolic homeostasis and autonomic nervous system that may facilitate the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias. Also, pre-existent or incident cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation (AF) may accelerate the progression of CKD. Patients with CKD may experience various cardiac rhythm disturbances including sudden cardiac death. Contemporary management of cardiac arrhythmias includes the use of antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs), catheter ablation and cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs). Importantly, AADs are not used only as the principal treatment strategy, but also as an adjunct therapy in combination with CIEDs, to facilitate their effects or to minimize inappropriate device activation in selected patients. Along with their principal antiarrhythmic effect, AADs may also induce cardiac arrhythmias and the risk for such proarrhythmic effect(s) is particularly increased in patients with reduced left ventricular systolic function or in the setting of electrolyte imbalance. Moreover, CKD itself can induce profound alterations in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of many drugs including AADs, thus facilitating the drug accumulation and increased exposure. Hence, the use of AADs in patients with CKD may be challenging. In this review article, we provide an overview of the characteristics of arrhythmogenesis in patients with CKD with special emphasis on the complexity of pharmacokinetics and risk for proarrhythmias when using AADs in patients with cardiac arrhythmias and CKD.",

Although important steps forward have been made in the comprehension and treatment of this disease, several aspects remain unclear. Firstly, from an epidemiological standpoint the actual prevalence of CPVT is still unknown and possibly underestimated. In addition, the diagnostic process remains very challenging and can be supported by genetic analysis in only about half of the cases. Finally, up to one third of CPVT patients continue to present complex arrhythmias despite beta blocker treatment; the role of newer therapeutic options, such as flecainide and left cardiac sympathetic denervation, needs to be further elucidated. All these points constitute challenges for the cardiologist in the management of CPVT patients and fuel research into new diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic approaches.",

In electrically stimulated left guinea pig atria, positive inotropy induced by KMUP-3 (0.1-100\u03bcM) was inhibited by the endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) inhibitors N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) and 7-nitroindazole, cyclic AMP antagonist SQ22536 [9-(terahydro-2-furanyl)-9H-purin-6-amine], soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) antagonist ODQ (1H-[1,2,4] oxadiazolo[4,3-a] quinoxalin-1-one), RhoA inhibitor C3 exoenzyme, \u03b2-blocker propranolol, 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A antagonist ketanserin, ROCK inhibitor Y27632 and KMUP-1 (7-{2-[4-(2-chlorobenzene) piperazinyl]ethyl}-1, 3-dimethylxanthine) at 10\u03bcM. Western blotting assays indicated that KMUP-3 (0.1-10\u03bcM) increased PKA, RhoA/ROCKII, and PKC translocation and CIP-17 (an endogenous 17-kDa inhibitory protein) activation. In spontaneous right atria, KMUP-3 induced negative chronotropy that was blunted by 7-nitroindazole and atropine. In neonatal myocytes, L-NAME inhibited KMUP-3-induced eNOS phosphorylation and RhoA/ROCK activation. In H9c2 cells, Y-27632 (50\u03bcM) and PKG antagonist KT5823 [2,3,9,10,11,12-hexahydro-10R- methoxy-2,9-dimethyl-1-oxo-9S,12R-epoxy-1H-diindolo(1,2,3-fg:3',2',1'-kl) pyrrolo(3,4-i)(1,6)benzodiazocine-10-carboxylic acid, methyl ester] (3\u03bcM) reversed KMUP-3 (1-100\u03bcM)-induced Ca(2+)-entry blockade. GPCR agonist activity of KMUP-3 appeared opposed to KMUP-1, and increased cardiac output via Ca(2+) sensitization, and displayed cardioprotection via cyclic GMP/PKG-mediated myocardial preconditioning in animal studies.", 
    "112": "A Food and Drug Administration-approved antiviral agent, known as vidarabine or adenine 9-\u03b2-D-arabinofuranoside (AraA), has features of inhibiting adenylyl cyclase type 5 (AC5) and protects against chronic coronary artery occlusion (CAO). The goal of this investigation was to determine whether AraA protects against myocardial ischemia, even when delivered after coronary artery reperfusion (CAR). AraA, delivered after CAR in wild-type mice, reduced infarct size by 55% compared with vehicle-treated controls, whereas an equal dose of adenosine reduced infarct size only when administered before CAR. A 5-fold greater dose of adenosine was required to reduce infarct size when delivered after CAR, which also reduced arterial pressure by 15%, whereas AraA did not affect pressure. The reduction in infarct size with AraA was prevented by a MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase blocker, a pathway also involved in the mechanism of protection of the AC5 knockout (KO) model. Infarct size was also reduced in cardiac-specific AC5 KO mice similarly in the presence and absence of AraA, further suggesting that AraA protection involves the AC5 pathway. AraA reduced infarct size in chronically instrumented conscious pigs when delivered after CAR, and in this model, it also reduced post-CAR coronary hyperemia, which could be another mechanism for cardioprotection (i.e., by reducing oxidative stress during CAR). Thus, AraA inhibits AC5 and exhibits unique cardioprotection when delivered after CAR, which is critical for clinical translation.",

Both QT time and heart rate (HR) variability (HRV) are considered to be markers of arrhythmic risk and autonomous dysregulation. In this study, we investigated the associations between aldosterone, QT time, and HRV in patients with arterial hypertension.We recruited 477 hypertensive patients (age: 60.2\u200a\u00b1\u200a10.2 years; 52.3% females) with a mean systolic/diastolic 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) value of 128\u200a\u00b1\u200a12.8/77.1\u200a\u00b1\u200a9.2\u200ammHg and with a median of 2 (IQR: 1-3) antihypertensive agents. Patients were recruited from the outpatient clinic at the Department of Internal Medicine of the Medical University of Graz, Austria. Blood samples, 24-hour HRV derived from 24-hour blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) and ECG's were obtained. Plasma aldosterone and plasma renin concentrations were measured by means of a radioimmunoassay. Twenty-four-hour urine specimens were collected in parallel with ABPM.Mean QTc was 423.3\u200a\u00b1\u200a42.0\u200amilliseconds for males and 434.7\u200a\u00b1\u200a38.3\u200amilliseconds for females.

    "133": "Nowadays, it is assumed that therapeutic efficacy of antidepressants depends, at least partly, on their anti-inflammatory properties. The present study investigated for the first time the effect of 21-day oral administration of desipramine on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated IL-1\u03b2 concentration in the olfactory bulb, hypothalamus, frontal cortex, hippocampus and plasma of rats, and on the LPS-induced IL-1\u03b2 mRNA level in the olfactory bulb. Desipramine (15mg/kg/day) reduced significantly the LPS (250 \u03bcg/kg i.p.)-induced IL-1\u03b2 concentration in the olfactory bulb, hypothalamus and in plasma, and diminished the LPS effect on IL-1\u03b2 mRNA in the olfactory bulb. Plasma concentration of desipramine was comparable to its therapeutic range. By using the \u03b11/\u03b12-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin and the unspecific \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol given prior to LPS, we found that the effect of desipramine on LPS-induced IL-1\u03b2 production was partially mediated by both adrenoceptors in the olfactory bulb and plasma, and that \u03b2-adrenoceptors contributed also to its effect on the stimulated IL-1\u03b2 concentration in the hypothalamus. The effect of LPS on the cerebral IL-1\u03b2 levels was, in part, mediated by \u03b2-adrenoceptors and, in a region-specific manner, by \u03b11/\u03b12-adrenoceptors. The findings provide evidence for central and peripheral anti-inflammatory activity of desipramine and confirm the impact of the noradrenergic system on IL-1\u03b2 production induced by an immunostimulatory challenge.",

Activation of the BG receptor induces an increase in intracellular Ca(2+), which may induce exocytosis. However, little is known about the precise mechanisms underlying BG activation of immune cells and the possible role of mitochondria in this process. The present study examined whether BG induced mast cell degranulation, and evaluated the role of calcium transients during mast cell activation. Our investigation focused on the role of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) in BG-induced degranulation. Black mouse (C57) bone marrow-derived mast cells were stimulated with 0.5 \u00b5g/ml BG, 100 \u00b5g/ml peptidoglycan (PGN), or 10 \u00b5M A23187 (calcium ionophore), and dynamic changes in cytosolic and mitochondrial calcium and membrane potential were monitored. BG-induced mast cell degranulation occurred in a time-dependent manner, and was significantly reduced under calcium-free conditions. Ruthenium red, a mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter blocker, significantly reduced mast cell degranulation induced by BG, PGN, and A23187. These results suggest that the mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter has an important regulatory role in BG-induced mast cell degranulation.", 
    "139": "Beige adipocytes emerge postnatally within the white adipose tissue in response to certain environmental cues, such as chronic cold exposure. Because of its highly recruitable nature and relevance to adult humans, beige adipocytes have gained much attention as an attractive cellular target for antiobesity therapy. However, molecular circuits that preferentially promote beige adipocyte biogenesis remain poorly understood. We report that a combination of mild cold exposure at 17\u00b0C and capsinoids, a nonpungent analog of capsaicin, synergistically and preferentially promotes beige adipocyte biogenesis and ameliorates diet-induced obesity. Gain- and loss-of-function studies show that the combination of capsinoids and cold exposure synergistically promotes beige adipocyte development through the \u03b22-adrenoceptor signaling pathway. This synergistic effect on beige adipocyte biogenesis occurs through an increased half-life of PRDM16, a dominant transcriptional regulator of brown/beige adipocyte development. We document a previously unappreciated molecular circuit that controls beige adipocyte biogenesis and suggest a plausible approach to increase whole-body energy expenditure by combining dietary components and environmental cues.",

In recent decades, it has become apparent that HF is divisible into two equally lethal but pathophysiologically different sub-classes, the first comprising patients with LV systolic dysfunction [heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)] and the other, approximately equal in size, involving patients with \"preserved\" systolic function [heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)]. Evidence-based event reducing therapy currently is available only for HFrEF. With the completion of seminal trials of beta blockers, now part of standard therapy for HFrEF, it was apparent that heart rate slowing is an underlying basis of clinical effectiveness of HFrEF therapy. With the discovery of the \"f current\" that modulates the slope of spontaneous diastolic depolarization of the sino-atrial node, a non-beta blockade approach to heart rate slowing became available. Ivabradine, the first FDA-approved f-current blocker for HFrEF, markedly reduces hospitalizations for worsening heart failure, while also progressively reducing mortality as pre-therapy heart rate increases, and also promotes beneficial left ventricular remodeling, improves health-related quality of life and is effective despite a wide range of comorbidities.

Initially, we used Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy coupled with multivariate analysis to discriminate between cell cultures exposed to different pharmaceuticals. This suggested that on exposure to propranolol there were significant changes in the lipid complement of P. putida. Metabolic profiling with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), coupled with univariate statistical analyses, was used to identify endogenous metabolites contributing to discrimination between cells exposed to the six drugs. This approach suggested that the energy reserves of exposed cells were being expended and was particularly evident on exposure to propranolol. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentrations were raised in P. putida exposed to propranolol. Increased energy requirements may be due to energy dependent efflux pumps being used to remove propranolol from the cell.",

However, the effect of physical-chemical properties on drug permeation via this route has not been systemically investigated. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of two key physicochemical properties, lipophilicity and ionization, on the transport of drugs across porcine sublingual mucosa. A series of \u03b2-blockers were used to study the effect of lipophilicity on drug permeation across the sublingual mucosa, while nimesulide (pKa 6.5) was used as a model drug to study the effect of degree of ionization on sublingual mucosa permeation of ionized and unionized species. Permeation of \u03b2-blockers increased linearly with an increase in the lipophilicity for the range of compounds studied. The permeability of nimesulide across sublingual mucosa decreased with an increase of pH. The flux of ionized and unionized forms of nimesulide was determined to delineate the contribution of ionized and unionized species to the total flux. At low pH, the apparent flux was primarily contributed by unionized species; however, when the pH is increased beyond its pKa, the primary contributor to the apparent flux, nimesulide, is ionized species. The contribution of each species to the apparent flux was shown to be determined by the thermodynamic activity of ionized or unionized species. This study identified the roles of lipophilicity and thermodynamic activity in drug permeation across the sublingual mucosa. The findings can help guide the design of sublingual drug delivery systems with optimal pH and solubility.",

The method was linear in the range of 0.05-100, 0.05-10 and 0.02-10 ng/mL for the carvedilol, OHC and DMC enantiomers, respectively. Application of the method to the investigation of a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with a single oral dose of 25mg racemic carvedilol showed plasma accumulation of the (R)-(+)-carvedilol, (R)-(+)-DMC and (R)-(+)-OHC enantiomers.

Uncarboxylated osteocalcin, a bone-derived protein, has been reported to regulate glucose metabolism by increasing insulin secretion, stimulating \u03b2 cell proliferation and improving insulin sensitivity. But the underlying mechanisms of uncarboxylated osteocalcin-modulated insulin secretion remain unclear. In the present study, we investigated the relationship of uncarboxylated osteocalcin-regulated insulin secretion and voltage-gated potassium (KV) channels, voltage-gated calcium channels in rat \u03b2 cells. Insulin secretion was measured by radioimmunoassay. Channel currents and membrane action potentials were recorded using the conventional whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Calcium imaging system was used to analyze intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i). The data show that under 16.7mmol/l glucose conditions uncarboxylated osteocalcin alone increased insulin secretion and [Ca(2+)]i, but with no such effects on insulin secretion and [Ca(2+)]i in the presence of a KV channel blocker, tetraethylammonium chloride. In the patch-clamp experiments, uncarboxylated osteocalcin lengthened action potential duration and significantly inhibited KV currents, but had no influence on the characteristics of voltage-gated calcium channels. These results indicate that KV channels are involved in uncarboxylated osteocalcin-regulated insulin secretion in rat pancreatic \u03b2 cells. By inhibiting KV channels, uncarboxylated osteocalcin prolongs action potential duration, increases intracellular Ca(2+) concentration and finally promotes insulin secretion. This finding provides new insight into the mechanisms of osteocalcin-modulated insulin secretion.", 
    "187": "Four simple and accurate spectrophotometric methods were proposed for the simultaneous determination of three \u03b2-adrenergic blockade, e.g. atenolol, metoprolol and propranolol. The methods were based on the reaction of the three drugs with erythrosine B (EB) in a Britton-Robinson buffer solution at pH4.6. EB could combine with the drugs to form three ion-association complexes, which resulted in the resonance Rayleigh scattering (RRS) intensity that is enhanced significantly with new RRS peaks that appeared at 337 nm and 370 nm, respectively. In addition, the fluorescence intensity of EB was also quenched. The enhanced scattering intensities of the two peaks and the fluorescence quenched intensity of EB were proportional to the concentrations of the drugs, respectively. What is more, the RRS intensity overlapped with the double-wavelength of 337 nm and 370 nm (so short for DW-RRS) was also proportional to the drugs concentrations. So, a new method with highly sensitive for simultaneous determination of three bisoprolol drugs was established. Finally, the optimum reaction conditions, influencing factors and spectral enhanced mechanism were investigated. The new DW-RRS method has been applied to simultaneously detect the three \u03b2-blockers in fresh serum with satisfactory results.",

    "223": "An exploratory, prospective single-arm interventional study at a tertiary referral academic private practice. Patients with neovascular AMD and persistent macular edema despite fixed-interval intravitreous anti-VEGF therapy were enrolled. Baseline spectral-domain optical coherence tomography and clinical data, including visual acuity and intraocular pressure, were obtained at enrollment and from one visit before enrollment. The study was performed at the Retina Service of Wills Eye Hospital and the offices of Mid Atlantic Retina from February 1, 2015, through September 30, 2015. Patients were followed up for at least 2 visits after enrollment. Central subfield thickness, maximum subretinal fluid height, and maximum pigment epithelial detachment height from spectral-domain optical coherence tomography were recorded at each visit.",

    "226": "Ten patients (10 eyes) completed the study. The mean age of the patients was 78.2 years (age range, 65-91 years), and 6 were male. Eight eyes received intravitreous aflibercept, and 2 eyes received intravitreous ranibizumab. All study eyes had been receiving long-term anti-VEGF therapy with the same medication before study enrollment for a mean of 21.9 injections. The mean central subfield thickness decreased from 419.7 \u03bcm at enrollment to 334.1 \u03bcm at the final visit (P\u2009=\u2009.01). The mean maximum subretinal fluid height decreased from 126.6 \u03bcm at enrollment to 49.5 \u03bcm at the final visit (P\u2009=\u2009.02). The mean maximum pigment epithelial detachment height decreased from 277.4 \u03bcm at enrollment to 239.9 \u03bcm at the final visit (P\u2009=\u2009.12).

    "232": "Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) use in poisoned patients is increasing, but is rare post cardiac arrest. We report a case of ECMO use with complete recovery in a patient who arrested twice after a cardiotoxicant overdose. A 17-year-old male presented after an unknown overdose. He rapidly became hypotensive and bradycardic and received aggressive supportive care without improvement. He was transferred to our institution and suffered a cardiac arrest shortly after arrival. Six minutes of advanced cardiac life support resulted in return of spontaneous circulation. High-dose insulin, lipid emulsion, and ECMO were initiated. While awaiting ECMO deployment, he again became pulseless. Compressions resumed, and after 30\u00a0min, ROSC was achieved, and he was cannulated for veno-arterial ECMO. Within 48\u00a0h, he was decannulated, and then weaned off epinephrine 2\u00a0days later. Upon extubation, he was neurologically intact. Amlodipine and metoprolol were later confirmed in serum. Adolescent poisoned patients represent an ideal population for ECMO due to lack of comorbidities. As experience with ECMO in overdose increases, additional research is needed to determine appropriate indications and timing for its use. ECMO is an option for patients poisoned with a cardiotoxicant drug, even following witnessed cardiac arrest.", 
    "233": "We wanted to assess whether \u03b2-adrenoceptors mediate proliferation in the normal and malignant urothelial cell lines UROtsa and T24, respectively. Urothelial cells were cultured for 24\u00a0h in the presence of the \u03b2-adrenoceptor agonists isoprenaline (\u03b21/2/3 ), dobutamine (\u03b21 ), salbutamol (\u03b22 ), BRL 37344 (\u03b23 ), CGP 12177 (a partial \u03b2-agonist) or \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonists (metoprolol; \u03b21 , propranolol; \u03b21/2 ). Phosphorylation of kinases was screened with a Human Phospho-Kinase Array Kit (R&D systems). Intracellular pathways activated by proliferation of urothelial cells were characterized by incubating cells with the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD 98,059, the p38 kinase inhibitor losmapimod or with the Akt 1/2 kinase inhibitor. Proliferation was assessed with the MTT proliferation assay (ATCC). Western blot and immunocytochemistry were used for detection of the \u03b21 -adrenoceptor. Isoprenaline and dobutamine induced proliferation, while salbutamol and BRL 37344 did not. Dobutamine-induced proliferation was not affected by metoprolol or propranolol but was instead antagonized by CGP 12177 in T24 but not in UROtsa. In response to stimulation with dobutamine, Akt1/2/3 was phosphorylated in UROtsa, while ERK1/2 and p38 were phosphorylated in T24. MEK1/2 inhibition blocked basal and dobutamine-induced proliferation in T24 but only basal proliferation in UROtsa. Losmapimod slightly inhibited basal proliferation in T24 but not dobutamine-induced proliferation. Akt 1/2 inhibitor blocked basal and dobutamine-induced proliferation in UROtsa. Immunocytochemistry and Western blot revealed expression of \u03b21 -adrenoceptors in both urothelial cell lines. The present data show that the urothelium expresses atypical \u03b21-adrenoceptors that activate intracellular kinases inducing urothelial proliferation.", 
    "234": "In this study, direct effects of the P2X purinoceptor agonist \u03b1\u03b2-methylene ATP (\u03b1\u03b2-meATP) and effects on the cholinergic twitch response of the electrically stimulated longitudinal muscle-myenteric plexus (LMMP) strip of the guinea-pig ileum, were investigated. \u03b1\u03b2-meATP (1, 3, and 10 \u00b5mol/l) induced short-lasting contractions on its own, followed by an inhibition of the twitch response during its presence in the organ bath. The inhibitor of small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (SK) channels, apamin (100 nmol/l), prevented the inhibitory effect of \u03b1\u03b2-meATP on the twitch response, whereas tetraethylammonium (300 \u00b5mol/l), a blocker of voltage-gated K+ channels and an inhibitor at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, augmented the inhibitory effect of \u03b1\u03b2-meATP on the twitch response. It is concluded, that there is a functional interaction between P2X receptors and nicotinic receptors in the LMMP strip, and that a major part of the excitatory input to the cholinergic motor neuron evoking the twitch response is purinergic and not nicotinergic.", 
    "235": "Prescription drug products abuse/misuse is epidemic in United States. Opioids drug forms major portion of prescription drug product abuse. Abuse deterrence formulation (ADF) is one of the many approaches taken by sponsors to tackle this problem. It involves formulating opioids into dosage forms that will be difficult to abuse/misuse. Current investigation focused on evaluating the abuse deterrent properties (ADP) of ADF manufactured by direct compression method. Effect of process and formulation variables on ADP was investigated by statistical design of experiment (fractional factorial design). Independent factors studied were molecular weight of polyethylene oxide (Polyox\u2122), curing time, temperature and method, and antioxidant type. Sotalol hydrochloride was selected as a model drug. ADP investigated were hardness/crush resistance, syringeability and injectability, physical manipulation (reduction into powder) and drug extraction in water and alcohol. Hardness and syringeability are evaluated by newly developed quantitative procedure. Other properties were also investigated such as morphology, crystallinity, assay and dissolution. The hardness and drug extraction was significantly (p<0.05) affected by curing temperature. Formulations could be powdered in 3 min irrespective of their hardness. Syringeability and injectability were intrinsic properties of the polymer used in the formulation, and were not affected by the investigated factors. Crystallinity of the polymer and drug changed, and was dependent upon curing temperature and time. The dissolution and assay were independent of formulation and process parameters studied. In conclusion, the study indicated some advantages of ADF product compared to non-ADF prepared by direct compression. However, the ADF should not be viewed as abuse proof product rather as incrementally improved product.", 
    "236": "Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and outcomes in women, and antihypertensive therapy is not always successful in achieving control over the blood pressure (BP). Nonoptimal control of BP remains a crucial risk factor for cardiovascular mortality, and in women, it could be related to sex-specific factors. Historically, women have been under-represented in clinical trials; therefore, the benefits of clinical outcomes and the safety profiles of antihypertensive therapies have been studied less extensively in women. The reasons for the sex differences in BP levels are multifactorial, implying different roles of the sex hormones, the renin-angiotensin system, sympathetic activity, and arterial stiffness. A complete understanding of the pathophysiological features of these differences requires further investigation.Nevertheless, the prevalence of the use of antihypertensive agents is higher among middle-aged women than among men. Notably, in the United States, hypertensive women use more diuretics and angiotensin receptor blockers than men, whereas hypertensive men more often receive beta-blockers, calcium channel antagonists, or inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme. To date, the explanations for these sex differences in the consumption of antihypertensive drugs remain unknown.",

    "238": "Blood pressure and FHT categories were assessed one hour before and after medication administration. Hypotension was defined as \u226530% reduction in baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) or SBP <90 mmHg. Changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP) were also compared. The National Institute for Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) three-tier category system was used to describe the FHT. For all category II tracings, Parer and Ikeda's system was also used.", 
    "239": "Sixty-nine women received hydralazine and 31 women received labetalol during the study period. The incidence of hypotension (\u226530% reduction in SBP) was similar between the labetalol (10%) and hydralazine (11%) groups (p = 0.98). No women experienced post-treatment SBP <90 mmHg. No association was observed between fetal heart rate category change and drug used. No women required emergent delivery for fetal indications.", 
    "240": "The incidence of maternal hypotension was low and did not differ following antepartum IV labetalol versus hydralazine use. These data should reassure providers about the use of parenteral labetalol and hydralazine for the treatment of severe hypertension.", 
    "241": "Beta3 adrenergic receptor (ADRB3) mediates vessel relaxation in the endothelium while it modulates lipolysis in the adipose tissue. However, the function and regulation mechanism of ADRB3 in the perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), especially in hypertension, is still unclear. We show that ADRB3 protein is upregulated in the PVAT of deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt (DOCA-salt) hypertensive mice, with the characteristics of PVAT browning and increased uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) expression. Inhibition of ADRB3 with selective antagonist SR59230A caused serious vascular injury in vivo, even though UCP1 expression was downregulated. ADRB3 protein was regulated by let-7b, which was decreased in the PVAT of the DOCA-salt group. These data reveal that ADRB3 in PVAT contributes to vascular function in the progression of hypertension.", 
    "242": "Severe bronchospasm refractory to \u03b2-agonists is a challenging aspect of asthma therapy, and novel therapeutics are needed. \u03b2-agonist-induced airway smooth muscle (ASM) relaxation is associated with increases in the phosphorylation of the small heat shock-related protein (HSP) 20. We hypothesized that a transducible phosphopeptide mimetic of HSP20 (P20 peptide) causes relaxation of human ASM (HASM) by interacting with target(s) downstream of the \u03b22-adrenergic receptor (\u03b22AR) pathway. The effect of the P20 peptide on ASM contractility was determined in human and porcine ASM using a muscle bath. The effect of the P20 peptide on filamentous actin dynamics and migration was examined in intact porcine ASM and cultured primary HASM cells. The efficacy of the P20 peptide in vivo on airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) was determined in an ovalbumin (OVA) sensitization and challenge murine model of allergic airway inflammation. P20 peptide caused dose-dependent relaxation of carbachol-precontracted ASM and blocked carbachol-induced contraction. The \u03b22AR inhibitor, (\u00b1)-1-[2,3-(dihydro-7-methyl-1H-inden-4-yl)oxy]-3-[(1-methylethyl)amino]-2-butanol hydrochloride (ICI 118,551), abrogated isoproterenol but not P20 peptide-mediated relaxation. The P20 peptide decreased filamentous actin levels in intact ASM, disrupted stress fibers, and inhibited platelet-derived growth factor-induced migration of HASM cells. The P20 peptide treatment reduced methacholine-induced AHR in OVA mice without affecting the inflammatory response. These results suggest that the P20 peptide decreased airway constriction and disrupted stress fibers through regulation of the actin cytoskeleton downstream of \u03b22AR. Thus, the P20 peptide may be a potential therapeutic for asthma refractory to \u03b2-agonists.", 
    "243": "A number of drugs prescribed for the treatment of various diseases can induce urological symptoms as side effects. Antihypertensive drugs (particularly alpha blockers) can result in stress incontinence, whereas selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) can cause urge incontinence and estrogen promotes both forms. A wide range of drugs with anticholinergic activity, among them neuroleptics, tricyclic antidepressants and certain drugs used in airway disorders are associated with urinary retention. Only very few drugs bear a relevant risk for urolithiasis, i. e. the diuretic triamterene and protease inhibitors, such as indinavir; however, the widely used combination of calcium and vitamin D supplementation for prevention of osteoporosis may be an underdiagnosed cause of renal calculi. Drug-induced sexual dysfunction is a frequent side effect of antihypertensive treatment, particularly with beta adrenoceptor blockers and diuretics. The SSRI and some neuroleptics can also impair sexual function.",

Procedural success was 88% in the radiation group versus 100% in controls (p<0.001) and 30-day survival was 92% in both groups. Five-year survival was 33%\u00b110% in the radiation group and 42%\u00b111% in controls (p=0.26). In radiation patients, the main cause of death was respiratory insufficiency in 40%. We identified four independent predictive factors of death in the radiation group: extracardiac arteriopathy (p=0.002) and the absence of \u03b2-blocker therapy (p=0.005) as preprocedural variables, and infectious complications (p=0.009) and a higher peak creatinine level (p=0.009) as postprocedural variables. In the radiation group, 89% of survivors were in New York Heart Association class I-II at last follow-up.", 
    "247": "Patients in the radiation group displayed high mortality rates although not significantly different from the controls. Respiratory failure was the main cause of death, emphasising the need for a careful pulmonary evaluation.

Currently, the cellular origin of these distinct tumors is unclear. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that propranolol-responsive vascular tumors are derived from common vessel-forming CD15 + progenitor cells which occur in early gestation. The aim of this study was to identify the tumor-relevant CD15 + progenitors at the early stages of embryo-placental development.",

In embryonic tissue, a discontinuous CD15+/CD31+/CD34 + progenitors was detected in immature vessels of the skin, neural tube, spinal and cerebral meninges. Similarly, vessels in IH and chorioangioma exhibited a co-expression of CD15, CD31, and CD34. In contrast, the majority of embryonic vessels presented a CD31+/CD34+, but CD15-negative immunophenotypic pattern.",

    "252": "Hence, site- and stage-specific CD15 + progenitors of vascular wall could be considered as propronalol-sensitive targets and source of pre- and postnatal vascular tumors. We propose, that the CD15+ \"vasculogenic zones\" are a site-specific reserve of multi-lineage progenitors that could be recruited in pre- and postnatal emergency situations.", 
    "253": "Interest in chronic conditions reflects their role as the first cause of death and disability in developed countries; improving the management of these conditions is a priority for health care services. The aim of this study was to establish which sociodemographic factors influence adherence to standards of care for chronic heart failure (CHF). A generalized multilevel structural equation model was developed and applied to a sample of patients with CHF obtained from administrative data flows in six Italian regions to ascertain any associations between adherence to standards of care for CHF and sociodemographic variables. Indicators of compliance were adherence to beta-blocker therapy (BB-A) and Angiotensin Convertin Enzime inhibitor/Angiotensin Receptor Blocker therapy (ACE-A), and creatinine and electrolyte testing (CNK-T). All indicators were computed over a one-year follow-up. Among a cohort of 24,997 patients, the BB-A rate was 40.4%, the ACE-A rate 61.1%, and the CNK-T rate 57.0%. Factors found associated with adherence were gender, age, and citizenship. Our study shows an inadequate adherence to standards of care for CHF, particularly associated with certain sociodemographic characteristics. This suggests the need to improve the role of primary care in managing this chronic condition. The measures considered only apply to patients with a reduced Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction, hence a limitation of this analysis is the lack of information on left ventricular ejection.",

In this study, a new polymorph of metoprolol succinate (here named as Form II) was discovered and investigated by X-ray diffraction, thermoanalysis and infrared spectroscopy. The results show its crystal structure and thermal properties are significantly different with Form I. Compared with Form I, Form II exhibits specific diffraction pattern, lower melting temperature and weaker hydrogen bond effect. The thermostability testing suggests Form II is a metastable crystal form and will gradually transform into Form I undergoing treatment of high temperature and humidity. Metastable crystal form generally has better dissolubility than its corresponding stable form. Subsequent measurement also verified that Form II can dissolve in the water more quickly than Form I.",
