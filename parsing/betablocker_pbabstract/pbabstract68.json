We aimed to assess the incidence and extent of myocardial injury after TAVR performed using transfemoral and transapical approaches. The clinical data from patients with aortic stenosis who underwent TAVR were retrospectively analyzed. The myocardial necrosis markers cardiac troponin I and creatine kinase (CK)-MB were assessed during hospitalization. Of the 150 TAVR patients, 95% and 50% had an abnormally elevated cardiac troponin I and CK-MB level, respectively. The transapical patients had significantly greater elevations of both cardiac troponin I (13.8 \u00b1 14.0 vs 2.5 \u00b1 5.8 ng/ml, p <0.001) and CK-MB (28.4 \u00b1 24.2 vs 7.4 \u00b1 8.6 ng/ml, p \u22640.001). On receiver operating curve analysis, postprocedural CK-MB (twofold increase) had high predictive power for 30-day mortality (area under the curve 0.85, p <0.001). Patients with high CK-MB levels had greater rates of postprocedural kidney injury (22% vs 6%, p = 0.026), in-hospital (22% vs 0%, p <0.001), 30-day (27% vs 1.5%, p <0.001), and 1-year mortality (41% vs 18%, p = 0.01). Baseline renal failure and no \u03b2-blocker treatment on admission were independent predictors of an elevated postprocedural CK-MB level. In conclusion, a cardiac biomarker increase after TAVR was common and more frequent among transapical access patients. A twofold increase (>7 ng/ml) in CK-MB after transfemoral TAVR was a surrogate for poor long-term outcomes.",

    "2": "A new, simple, precise and efficient method was developed for the determination of carvedilol in human plasma using a dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction based on solidification of floating organic droplet, followed by spectrofluorimetry method. Some important parameters such as types and volumes of extraction and disperser solvents, pH, salt effect and sample volume were optimized. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the method provided a linear range of 40 to 300 ng ml(-1), with a correlation coefficient of 0.996. The limit of detection, lower limit of quantification and upper limit of quantification were 18, 40 and 300 ng ml(-1), respectively. The found recovery was from 98.2 to 102.2%, the mean intra- and inter-day precisions were 8.3 and 6.4%, respectively. The relative error for accuracy varied from 0.4 to 2.2%.

Many poison control centers (PCC) now recommend use. Healthcare providers may be unfamiliar with these treatments and may not institute them despite recommendations. We sought to determine how often HIE and IFE are recommended by a statewide PCC in CCB and BB toxicity, how often those recommendations are implemented, and whether a faxable information sheet increased adherence. All cases of CCB and BB exposure from January 2005-July 2011 where insulin or \"other therapy\" was coded were reviewed. Exclusion criteria included an incomplete PCC record, miscoding, and insulin administration as other than cardiovascular drug antidotal therapy. There were 215 CCB or BB exposures initially identified using the search criteria. HIE was recommended in 71 cases and started in one case prior to PCC recommendation. HIE was subsequently used in 30 cases after PCC recommendation (42 %). IFE was recommended by the PCC in 30 cases and implemented 10 times (33 %). In six cases, both HIE and IFE were implemented after recommendation. There was no statistical difference when recommendation was made via telephone or by faxable information sheet for HIE or IFE. HIE and IFE are two therapies that are potentially beneficial in the treatment of BB and CCB toxicity. Current national organization guidelines for use are limited. Exploration of reasons for not following recommendations and additional efforts to improve clinician education regarding HIE and IFE may be required to increase the utilization of these potentially lifesaving antidotes.", 
    "13": "Perioperative tachycardia and hypertension are often treated with esmolol, a short-acting \u03b21-adrenoceptor antagonist. Besides its cardiac effect, esmolol is reported to exert antinociceptive effects. This study examined the efficacy of intrathecal (IT) esmolol on pain responses in a postoperative pain model. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 g) were anesthetized with sevoflurane and an IT catheter was implanted. Six days after catheter implantation, a postoperative pain model was established by plantar incision under sevoflurane anesthesia. Withdrawal latencies were assessed by applying a focused radiant heat source before plantar incision; 1 day after the incision (before esmolol administration); and 5, 10, and 15 minutes after bolus administration of IT esmolol. Plantar incision produced hypersensitivity in the postoperative pain model expressed as decreased withdrawal latency to heat stimulation (before incision: 13.9 \u00b1 0.29 seconds and 1 day after incision: 6.3 \u00b1 0.26 seconds). These decreased latencies caused by incision were significantly increased by esmolol administration (40 \u03bcg, 80 \u03bcg) at 5 minutes (10.7 \u00b1 1.16 seconds, 10.5 \u00b1 1.16 seconds). No postoperative antinociceptive effects of esmolol were observed at 10 or 15 minutes. IT administration of esmolol produced antinociceptive effects of short duration in a rat postoperative pain model. These results suggest that IT esmolol could offer a new strategy for managing perioperative pain, although an alternative approach is necessary to lengthen the duration of the analgesia.",

The present study involved design of mucoadhesive nanoparticulate carrier system containing betaxolol hydrochloride for ocular delivery to improve its corneal permeability and precorneal residence time. Nanoparticles were prepared by spontaneous emulsification method and had a particle size of 168-260 nm with zeta potential of 25.2-26.4 mV. The in vitro release studies in simulated tear fluid exhibited biphasic release pattern with an initial burst followed by sustained release upto 12 h. The sterility tests confirmed that formulation was free from viable microorganisms and suitable for ocular delivery. The ocular tolerance of nanoparticles was evaluated using Hen Egg-Chorion Allantoic Membrane (HE-CAM) method and was found to be non-irritant. Stability studies of nanoparticles revealed that there was no significant change in particle size and drug content after storage at 25 \u00b1 2\u00b0C/60 \u00b1 5% RH over a period of 3 months.

    "16": "Cirrhosis recurrence is frequent after orthotopic liver transplantation for hepatitis C virus (HCV). Because transplantation causes liver denervation, we hypothesized that the response to propranolol might differ in transplant patients versus nontransplant patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Twenty-one patients with cirrhosis recurrence after orthotopic liver transplantation with portal hypertension were compared to 20 nontransplant patients with cirrhosis, HCV, and portal hypertension, and they were matched by sex, age, presence of varices, and Child-Pugh score. The patients underwent systemic and hepatic hemodynamic measurements at the baseline and 20 minutes after intravenous propranolol (0.15 mg/kg). At the baseline, the transplant patients with cirrhosis had a lower hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) than the nontransplant patients with cirrhosis (14.8\u2009\u00b1\u20092.9 versus 17.3\u2009\u00b1\u20094.4 mm Hg, P\u2009=\u20090.03) but a higher mean arterial pressure (MAP; 100.3\u2009\u00b1\u200912.3 versus 91.8\u2009\u00b1\u200911.6 mm Hg, P\u2009=\u20090.04) and higher systemic vascular resistance (2253\u2009\u00b1\u2009573 versus 1883\u2009\u00b1\u2009525 dyn/second/cm(-5) , P\u2009=\u20090.03). There were no differences in the cardiac index (CI). Propranolol significantly decreased HVPG to similar extents in transplant patients and nontransplant patients with cirrhosis (-14.1%\u2009\u00b1\u20098.0% versus -16.9%\u2009\u00b1\u20099.5%, P\u2009>\u20090.99). MAP tended to increase in transplant patients with cirrhosis, whereas it slightly decreased in nontransplant patients (5.1%\u2009\u00b1\u200914.2% versus -4.8%\u2009\u00b1\u20096.4%, P\u2009=\u20090.007); however, the reduction in CI was less marked in transplant patients with cirrhosis (-18.6%\u2009\u00b1\u20097.6% versus -26.9%\u2009\u00b1\u20099.0%, P\u2009=\u20090.005). In conclusion, patients with HCV-related cirrhosis and portal hypertension after orthotopic liver transplantation have lower baseline HVPG values but similar HVPG responses to propranolol infusions in comparison with nontransplant patients with cirrhosis. In contrast to nontransplant patients, propranolol increases the systemic vascular resistance and arterial pressure in transplant patients with cirrhosis and attenuates the fall in CI.", 
    "17": "Dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) plays a key role in integrating cardiovascular responses to stress. We have recently reported greater heart rate responses following disinhibition of the right side of the DMH (R-DMH) in anesthetized rats and greater suppression of stress-induced tachycardia following inhibition of the R-DMH in conscious rats [both compared with similar intervention in the left DMH (L-DMH)], suggesting existence of right/left side asymmetry in controlling cardiac chronotropic responses by the DMH. The aim of the present study was to determine whether similar asymmetry is present for controlling cardiac contractility. In anesthetized rats, microinjections of the GABAA antagonist bicuculline methiodide (BMI; 40 pmol/100 nl) into the DMH-evoked increases in heart rate (HR), left ventricular pressure (LVP), myocardial contractility (LVdP/dt), arterial pressure, and respiratory rate. DMH disinhibition also precipitated multiple ventricular and supraventricular ectopic beats. DMH-induced increases in HR, LVP, LVdP/dt, and in the number of ectopic beats dependent on the side of stimulation, with R-DMH provoking larger responses. In contrast, pressor and respiratory responses did not depend on the side of stimulation. Newly described DMH-induced inotropic responses were rate-, preload- and (largely) afterload-independent; they were mediated by sympathetic cardiac pathway, as revealed by their sensitivity to \u03b2-adrenergic blockade. We conclude that recruitment of DMH neurons causes sympathetically mediated positive chronotropic and inotropic effects, and that there is an asymmetry, at the level of the DMH, in the potency to elicit these effects, with R-DMH > L-DMH.",

    "23": "The neuropeptide vasopressin is crucial to mammalian osmotic regulation. Local hypoosmotic challenge transiently decreases and then increases vasopressin secretion. To investigate mechanisms underlying this transient response, we examined the effects of hypoosmotic challenge on the electrical activity of rat hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus (SON) vasopressin neurons using patch-clamp recordings. We found that 5 min exposure of hypothalamic slices to hypoosmotic solution transiently increased inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC) frequency and reduced the firing rate of vasopressin neurons. Recovery occurred by 10 min of exposure, even though the osmolality remained low. The \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor blocker, gabazine, blocked the IPSCs and the hypoosmotic suppression of firing. The gliotoxin l-aminoadipic acid blocked the increase in IPSC frequency at 5 min and the recovery of firing at 10 min, indicating astrocytic involvement in hypoosmotic modulation of vasopressin neuronal activity. Moreover, \u03b2-alanine, an osmolyte of astrocytes and GABA transporter (GAT) inhibitor, blocked the increase in IPSC frequency at 5 min of hypoosmotic challenge. Confocal microscopy of immunostained SON sections revealed that astrocytes and magnocellular neurons both showed positive staining of vesicular GATs (VGAT). Hypoosmotic stimulation in vivo reduced the number of VGAT-expressing neurons, and increased co-localisation and molecular association of VGAT with glial fibrillary acidic protein that increased significantly by 10 min. By 30 min, neuronal VGAT labelling was partially restored, and astrocytic VGAT was relocated to the ventral portion while it decreased in the somatic zone of the SON. Thus, synergistic astrocytic and neuronal GABAergic inhibition could ensure that vasopressin neuron firing is only transiently suppressed under hypoosmotic conditions.",

Forty-one studies with 1,264 patients were included; 74% of patients were female and approximately 30% had received other treatments before propranolol. Propranolol was initiated at a mean age of 6.6\u00a0months at a mean dose of 2.1\u00a0mg/kg/day and for a mean treatment duration of 6.4\u00a0months. The response rate for patients with IHs treated with propranolol was 98% (range 82%-100%), with response rate defined as any improvement with propranolol. Treatment response rates were comparable for studies evaluating IHs at specific sites, such as periorbital IHs. Studies that followed patients after treatment completion reported IH rebound growth in 17% of patients. There were 371 adverse events reported in 1,189 patients. The most common adverse events were changes in sleep (n\u00a0=\u00a0136) and acrocyanosis (n\u00a0=\u00a061). Serious adverse events were rare, with reports of symptomatic hypotension in five patients, hypoglycemia in four, and symptomatic bradycardia in one.

Formulations contained either microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) or dicalcium phosphate (DCP) as diluent, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), lactose, and water. Extrudates were characterized for their tensile strength, Young's modulus of elasticity, water absorption, gel forming capacity, and release of two model drugs, coumarin (COU) and propranolol hydrochloride (PRO). Cohesive extrudates could be produced with both filling materials (MCC and DCP) when HPMC was included as a binder at low amounts (3.3-4.5% w/w dry weight). Employing more HPMC, the elasticity of the wet masses increased which resulted in distinct surface defects. For MCC, the maximum HPMC amount that could be included in the formulations (15% w/w dry weight) did not affect the mechanical properties or decrease the drug release significantly. For DCP extrudates, the maximally effective HPMC amount was 30% (w/w dry weight) with influence on both the mechanical properties and drug release. This study suggests that laminar extrusion of wet masses is a feasible technique for the production of dosage forms for oral drug delivery.",

Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (JLNS) is a recessively inherited form of long QT syndrome characterized by profound sensorineural deafness and prolongation of the QT interval. Findings have shown that JLNS occurs due to homozygous and compound heterozygous pathogenic variants in KCNQ1 or KCNE1. A 3.5-year-old girl presented to the hospital with recurrent syncope, seizures, and congenital sensorineural deafness. Her electrocardiogram showed a markedly prolonged QT interval, and she had a diagnosis of JLNS. The sequence analysis of the proband showed the presence of a pathogenic homozygous missense variant (c.728G>A, p.Arg243His). Heterozygous mutations of KCNQ1 were identified in her mother, father, and sister, demonstrating true homozygosity. Even with high-dose beta-blocker therapy, the patient had two VT attacks, so an implantable cardioverter defibrillator was fitted. The authors suggest early genetic diagnosis for proper management of the disease in the proband and genetic counseling for both the proband and the girl's extended family.",

The objective of this study was to examine long-term adherence to and dosages of evidence-based pharmacotherapy during and after participation in specialized HFCs.", 
    "38": "Initiation, dosages, and adherence were studied in patients with systolic HF attending HFCs in Denmark from 2002 to 2009. Information was obtained from an electronic patient file and research database used in the HFCs combined with prescription data from the Danish Registry of Medicinal Product Statistics. A total of 8792 patients were included in the study. The mean age was 68 years; with a mean LVEF of 30%, and 72% were males. Long-term adherence to treatment was high for the patients who initiated renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors and beta-blockers. Adherence after 1 year was 93% for RAS inhibitors, 92% for beta-blockers, and 86% for spironolactone. After 3 years, it was 90% for RAS inhibitors, 88% for beta-blockers, and 74% for spironolactone. For patients referred back to their general practitioner (GP), adherence 1 year after they left the HFC was 89% for RAS inhibitors, 89% for beta-blockers, and 72% for spironolactone.",

    "40": "In several cross-sectional analyses, circulating baseline levels of galectin-3, a protein involved in myocardial fibrosis and remodeling, have been associated with increased risk for morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure (HF). The importance and clinical use of repeated measurements of galectin-3 have not yet been reported.", 
    "41": "Plasma galectin-3 was measured at baseline and at 3 months in patients enrolled in the Controlled Rosuvastatin Multinational Trial in Heart Failure (CORONA) trial (n=1329), and at baseline and at 6 months in patients enrolled in the Coordinating Study Evaluating Outcomes of Advising and Counseling Failure (COACH) trial (n=324). Patient results were analyzed by categorical and percentage changes in galectin-3 level. A threshold value of 17.8 ng/mL or 15% change from baseline was used to categorize patients. Increasing galectin-3 levels over time, from a low to high galectin-3 category, were associated with significantly more HF hospitalization and mortality compared with stable or decreasing galectin-3 levels (hazard ratio in CORONA, 1.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-2.25; P=0.007; hazard ratio in COACH, 2.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-5.55; P=0.046). In addition, patients whose galectin-3 increased by >15% between measurements had a 50% higher relative hazard of adverse event than those whose galectin-3 stayed within \u00b115% of the baseline value, independent of age, sex, diabetes mellitus, left ventricular ejection fraction, renal function, medication (\u03b2-blocker, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, and angiotensin receptor blocker), and N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide (hazard ratio in CORONA, 1.50; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-1.92; P=0.001). The impact of changing galectin-3 levels on other secondary end points was comparable.",

    "43": "The authors describe two cases of takotsubo cardiomyopathy developing after an abrupt withdrawal of carvedilol and bisoprolol. Takotsubo or stress cardiomyopathy is characterized by acute and reversible cardiac dysfunction without coronary artery disease. It is triggered by acute emotional or physical stress, drugs or drug withdrawal. The immediate discontinuation of the long acting vasodilator beta-blocker, carvedilol has not yet been described to cause takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The authors recommend cautious withdrawal of beta-blockers.", 
    "44": "Daily rhythms are regulated by a master clock-system in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and by a peripheral clock-system in each organ. Because norepinephrine is one of the timekeepers for the myocardial circadian clock that influences cardiac metabolism, it is speculated that a beta-blocker may affect the circadian clock and metabolism in heart tissue. In this study, thirty mg/kg/day of propranolol (a lipophilic beta-blocker) or atenolol (a hydrophilic beta-blocker) was given orally to Wistar rats for 4 weeks. The mRNA expressions of Bmal1 and E4BP4 in heart tissue were suppressed by the beta-blockers. However, the mRNA expressions of these clock genes in the suprachiasmatic nucleus were unchanged. Myocardial mRNA expressions of lactate dehydrogenase a and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 were also suppressed by the beta-blockers. In addition, ATP content in heart tissue was significantly elevated by the beta-blockers throughout 24 hours. The effects of propranolol and atenolol did not differ significantly. This study showed for the first time that a beta-blocker affects myocardial clock gene expression. Propranolol and atenolol increased ATP content in heart tissue throughout 24 hours. The influences of beta-blockers may be negligible on the SCN, and may be independent of lipid solubility on heart tissue. It is well known that these drugs exert a protective effect against myocardial ischemia, which may be mediated by an increase in the preservation of myocardial ATP.", 
    "45": "Background: Atrial fibrillation/flutter (AF) is the most common arrhythmia following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and it increases morbidity and mortality associated with this procedure. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the predictability of this arrhythmia using previously identified risk factors and to assess the efficacy of recommended prophylactic beta blocker (BB) therapy in the prevention of post CABG AF. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart analysis of consecutive patients undergoing elective CABG during 1 year period. Patients who developed new onset AF after the surgery were designated as cases and those who did not, as controls. 41 different variables were analyzed using Chi-square test and independent sample t-test. Multivariate analysis was carried out using logistic regression model. Results: 23% patients undergoing CABG developed AF during post-operative period. Statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of age, use of peri-operative Aspirin (ASA), current smoking, previous history of AF, left atrial size, history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels. In terms of prophylactic therapy, preoperative BB did not independently protect against post CABG AF. On multivariate analysis, only age, use of ASA and previous history of AF remained as independent predictors of post CABG AF. Conclusion: In our study population, the use of preoperative BB did not independently decrease the risk of post-CABGAF. Age, peri-operative ASA use and previous history of AF remained strong independent predictors of post- operative AF.",

    "51": "Thyrotoxicosis is mainly caused by autonomous adenomas of the thyroid gland and by Graves' disease. A less frequent cause for thyrotoxicosis is Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Thyrotoxicosis in autonomous adenomas and Graves' disease is caused by an increased thyroid hormone production whereas hyperthyroidism in Hashimoto's thyroiditis results from destruction of the thyroid gland. Drug therapy depends on the cause of the disease. Autonomous adenomas and Graves' disease are treated with methimazole and potentially with \u03b2-blockers. Regarding thyroid ablative therapy, radioiodine is mostly preferred compared to thyroidectomy. Drug therapy of Hashimoto's thyroiditis is purely symptomatic using \u03b2-blockers and rarely corticosteroids. Hyperthyroidism in pregnancy is a major issue and pregnant women in the first trimester are treated with propylthiouracil (PTU) whereas women in the second and third trimesters are treated with methimazole. The aim is to maintain the serum fT4 levels within the upper normal range.", 
    "52": "Rosacea is a chronic skin disease of unknown etiology, affecting the central areas of the face skin (cheeks, chin, nose, forehead) and is characterized by periods of remission and exacerbation. Currently, about 10% of the world's population suffered from rosacea. Significant role in the pathogenesis of Rosacea, most researchers reffered to vascular disorders. Pathology of the skin capillaries can be attributed with several factors, which are united by a single result - a persistent vasodilation of the skin vessels and the subsequent blood stasis. Clinically the Rosacea manifested by erythema and telangiectasia. According to Morrison (2012) in the study of the autonomic nervous system (using the vegetative index of Kerdo) the prevalence of parasympathetic tone of the autonomic nervous system has been found in Rosacea patients. The urgency of Rosacea correction in its initial stage of development is primarily due to the state of the skin blood vessels' walls, which has not only the outward manifestation, but also influencing the trophic, morphology and function of the skin in general, the progression of the disease and its transition to a more severe stage, up to rhinophym. Thus, it is advisable to carry out remedial measures in the early stages of Rosacea in order to correct the clinical manifestations of pre-rosacea and prevent development of more severe forms of the disease. Based on foregoing, objective of the study was to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of beta-blockers and drug Rozaliak in treatment of patients with Rosacea. We observed 25 patients (15 women and 10 men) aged 25 to 49 years with erythematous stage of Rrosacea. Depending on the treatment, all patients were divided into 2 groups. 13 patients (8 women and 5 men) were included in the control group who received a full comprehensive treatment complex, including short courses of antibiotics, systemic metronidazole, antihistamines, desensitizing agents, traditional external therapy (Rosamet, 0.75% metronidazole cream). 12 patients (7 women and 5 men) were included in the study group, which additionally, after the main course (up to the revealing of clinical effects), obtained Inderal (10 mg a day for 10-20 minutes before meals) and externally - Rozaliak cream (2 times a day). Patents of this group were under the close supervision of a cardiologist. The period of observation after treatment was 12 months. During this period the relapses in the group of study were not observed, while in the control group - relapses were detected already in the third month of observation. At the same time, a substantial reduction of erythema in patients with rosacea were not revealed. Thus, this study suggests that beta-blockers and Rozaliak are effective choice for the treatment of torpid relapsing forms of Rosacea on erythematous stage of disease, as well as for stable and long-term clinical remission.",

    "54": "One hundred and sixty PVC patients and 31 controls were enrolled. Holter ECG was used to evaluate PVC occurrence, and spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) was calculated to represent cardiac autonomic control. PVCs were divided into fast rate-dependent (F-PVC), slow rate-dependent (S-PVC), and HR-independent PVC (I-PVC) based on the relationship between hourly PVC density and hourly HR. HRV among different types of PVCs were compared, and the association between PVC density with HR and HRV were analyzed. Furthermore, autonomic changes assessed by consecutive 5-min HRV in 30 min before PVC episodes were investigated.", 
    "55": "In 160 subjects, there were 73 F-PVC, 56 S-PVC, and 31 I-PVC. Hourly PVC density was positively associated with sympathetic indice (LF/HF) and negatively related to vagal indices (HF and HFnu) in F-PVC, and this trend was reversed in S-PVC. During 30 min before PVC onset, RR interval and HFnu decreased significantly with LF/HF showing an increasing trend in F-PVC, while in S-PVC both RR interval and HF increased significantly. It was noted that those changes were most evident during the last 5 min before PVC onset. In addition, PVC density in F-PVC was significantly decreased by \u03b2-blocker treatment.",

As an increasing number of fluorescent transgenic zebrafish lines with specific fluorescent protein expression specifically expressed in different organs and tissues, we envision that the fluorescent markers may provide more sensitive endpoints for monitoring chemical induced phenotypical changes. Here we employed Tg(nkx2.2a:mEGFP) transgenic zebrafish which have GFP expression in the central nervous system to investigate its potential for screening neurotoxic chemicals. Five potential neurotoxins (acetaminophen, atenolol, atrazine, ethanol and lindane) and one neuroprotectant (mefenamic acid) were tested. We found that the GFP-labeled ventral axons from trunk motoneurons, which were easily observed in live fry and measured for quantification, were a highly sensitive to all of the five neurotoxins and the length of axons was significantly reduced in fry which looked normal based on DarT endpoints at low concentrations of neurotoxins. Compared to the most sensitive endpoints of DarT, ventral axon marker could improve the detection limit of these neurotoxins by about 10 fold. In contrast, there was no improvement for detection of the mefenamic acid compared to all DarT endpoints. Thus, ventral axon lengths provide a convenient and measureable marker specifically for neurotoxins. Our study may open a new avenue to use other fluorescent transgenic zebrafish embryos/fry to develop sensitive and specific toxicological tests for different categories of chemicals.",

Binding of antagonists causes dissociation of a preformed complex between \u03b21ARs and Type-4 cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDE4s). This reduces the local concentration of cAMP-hydrolytic activity, thereby increasing submembrane cAMP and PKA activity. Our study identifies receptor/PDE4 complex dissociation as a novel mechanism of antagonist action that contributes to the pharmacological properties of \u03b21AR antagonists and might be shared by other receptor subtypes.", 
    "91": "Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease causing muscle weakness due to impaired transmission at the neuromuscular junction. MG or a MG-like condition may be triggered or exacerbated by several drugs used for treatment of other diseases. Drugs may interfere with the neuromuscular transmission through several mechanisms, either by affecting pre- or postsynaptic ion channels or by affecting acetylcholinesterase. Based on a literature search in PubMed and the authors' own clinical experiences, we provide an overview focusing on the most frequently used drugs that may exacerbate weakness in patients with MG. In our experience, symptomatic MG-patients who have a generalised disease are especially vulnerable to drug-induced exacerbations, while stable MG patients with few symptoms more seldom are. Nevertheless, patients with MG must receive treatment for co-existing conditions. It is important to be aware of a possible increase in muscle weakness when introducing a new drug. If the patient deteriorates, the new treatment must be withdrawn or the dose reduced.",

In this work, we asked whether the prognostic value of the 3-month transcript level could be improved by combining the 3- and 6-month results. We classified patients treated with imatinib and patients treated with dasatinib according to their transcript levels at 3 months and 6 months. The patients who met the 3-month landmark but failed the 6-month one had outcomes identical to those of patients who met both landmarks, whereas the patients who failed the first landmark but met the second one had prognoses similar to those who failed both landmarks. In summary, early intervention strategies can be based robustly just on the transcript level at 3 months. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as # NCT01460693.",

The sample pretreatment consisted of liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) using ethylacetate:n-heptane (80:20, v/v). Six deuterated analogues were used as internal standards (IS). The compounds were separated using a reversed phase C18-column (2.1mm\u00d7100mm, 1.7\u03bcm), a flow rate of 0.5mL/min, and gradient elution with 5mM ammonium formate pH 10.2 and acetonitrile. Quantification was done by MS/MS using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) in positive mode, using two transitions for the compounds and one transition for the IS. The run time of the method was 8min including equilibration time. The calibration curves had R(2) values above 0.995 for all the compounds. The intermediate precision had a relative standard deviation (RSD, %) ranging between 2.0 and 16%. Recoveries of the compounds were \u226581%. The lower limits of quantifications (LLOQs) for the compounds varied from 5.0nmol/L to 0.10\u03bcmol/L (1.3-26ng/mL) and the limits of detections (LODs) from 1.0 to 20nmol/L (0.24-5.3ng/mL). LLOQ corresponds to 0.28-5.5pg injected on column. Matrix effects (ME) were between 91 and 113% when calculated against an IS. A comparison with former confirmation LC-MS methods at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Division of Forensic Medicine and Drug Abuse Research (NIPH) was performed during method validation. Good correlation was seen for all compounds except sertraline, where the old LC-MS method was showing 33% higher results.

Also, the French national reference centre for angioedema (CREAK) decided to establish recommendations, developed by an expert group and proposed at a national meeting. A scientific committee conducted a comprehensive literature review and worked out with proposals. These proposals were submitted to a vote to the expert panel of CREAK at a national meeting. Proposals that had received the majority were retained. Diagnosis of ACE inhibitor-related AE is based on clinical events. Regarding the severity of the disease, this diagnosis has to be put forward in any patient currently treated with or who has been treated with ACE inhibitors in the previous 6 months. The diagnosis is important because AE does not respond to usual treatment of histamine-induced AE (antihistamines, corticosteroids, and epinephrine), but only to specific treatment of bradykinin-induced AE, as antagonists of bradykinin or concentrates of C1 inhibitor. The subsequent use of ACE is strictly contra-indicated. A report to pharmacovigilance centres of every case is essential.

    "104": "Lipophilic (logP > 1) and amphiphilic drugs (also known as cationic amphiphilic drugs) with ionizable amines (pKa > 6) can accumulate in lysosomes, a process known as lysosomal trapping. This process contributes to presystemic extraction by lysosome-rich organs (such as liver and lung), which, together with the binding of lipophilic amines to phospholipids, contributes to the large volume of distribution characteristic of numerous cardiovascular and central nervous system drugs. Accumulation of lipophilic amines in lysosomes has been implicated as a cause of phospholipidosis. Furthermore, elevated levels of lipophilic amines in lysosomes can lead to high organ-to-blood ratios of drugs that can be mistaken for active drug transport. In the present study, we describe an in vitro fluorescence-based method (using the lysosome-specific probe LysoTracker Red) to identify lysosomotropic agents in immortalized hepatocytes (Fa2N-4 cells). A diverse set of compounds with various physicochemical properties were tested, such as acids, bases, and zwitterions. In addition, the partitioning of the nonlysosomotropic atorvastatin (an anion) and the lysosomotropics propranolol and imipramine (cations) were quantified in Fa2N-4 cells in the presence or absence of various lysosomotropic or nonlysosomotropic agents and inhibitors of lysosomal sequestration (NH4Cl, nigericin, and monensin). Cellular partitioning of propranolol and imipramine was markedly reduced (by at least 40%) by NH4Cl, nigericin, or monensin. Lysosomotropic drugs also inhibited the partitioning of propranolol by at least 50%, with imipramine partitioning affected to a lesser degree.

Application of sotalol, but not RAN or flecainide increased the atrial action potential duration at 90% repolarization (aAPD90); however, both RAN (+8 ms) and flecainide (+13 ms) increased interatrial conduction time. All three drugs caused a significant increase in atrial effective refractory period (aERP) and, thus, an increase in atrial post-repolarization refractoriness (aPRR: +11 ms each, P < 0.05). Acute dilatation of the left atrium reduced aAPD90 and aERP. The described drug effects were preserved in the setting of acute atrial dilatation.

To assess the incidence and extent of stress-induced histologic myocardial alterations in septic shock, a prospective, observational, combined clinical and postmortem study was conducted, and 20 patients dying from septic shock were included. Exclusion criteria were younger than 18 years, pregnancy, open heart surgery or cardiopulmonary resuscitation, acute neurologic diseases, pheochromocytoma, and forensic autopsy. A systematic macropathologic evaluation was performed. Nine predefined heart sections were histologically screened for myocytolysis, interstitial fibrosis, contraction band necrosis, mononuclear infiltrates, interstitial edema, and tissue hemorrhage. Stress-induced pathologies were found in 90% to 100% of patients in all heart sections (myocytolysis, 100%; interstitial fibrosis, 100%; contraction band necrosis, 95%; mononuclear infiltrates, 90%; interstitial edema, 90%; tissue hemorrhage, 30%). The incidence and extent of contraction band necrosis, mononuclear infiltrates, and myocytolysis did not differ between sexes; patients with or without chronic \u03b2-blocker, calcium antagonist, and/or statin premedication; or between the binary use of different catecholamine agents (all comparisons P > 0.05). The maximum epinephrine dose correlated with the overall extent of mononuclear infiltrates (Spearman-Rho, r = 0.704; P = 0.05) and myocytolysis (Spearman-Rho, r = 0.933; P = 0.001). Maximum norepinephrine doses correlated with the extent of mononuclear infiltrates in the left ventricular anterior wall (Spearman-Rho, r = 0.519; P = 0.02).

    "113": "Cardiac ventricular myocytes exhibit a protein kinase A-dependent Cl(-) current (ICl.PKA) mediated by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). There is conflicting evidence regarding the ability of the divalent cation nickel (Ni(2+)), which has been used widely in vitro in the study of other cardiac ionic conductances, to inhibit ICl.PKA. Here the action of Ni(2+) on ICl.PKA activated by \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation has been elucidated. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made from rabbit isolated ventricular myocytes. Externally applied Ni(2+) blocked ICl.PKA activated by 1 \u03bcM isoprenaline with a log IC50 (M) of -4.107 \u00b1 0.075 (IC50=78.1 \u03bcM) at +100 mV and -4.322 \u00b1 0.107 (IC50=47.6 \u03bcM) at -100 mV. Thus, the block of ICl.PKA by Ni(2+) was not strongly voltage dependent. Ni(2+) applied internally via the patch-pipette was ineffective at inhibiting isoprenaline-activated ICl,PKA, but in the same experiments the current was suppressed by external Ni(2+) application, indicative of an external site of Ni(2+) action. In the presence of 1 \u03bcM atenolol isoprenaline was ineffective at activating ICl.PKA, but in the presence of the \u03b22-adrenoceptor inhibitor ICI 118,551 isoprenaline still activated Ni(2+)-sensitive ICl.PKA. Collectively, these data demonstrate that Ni(2+) ions produce marked inhibition of \u03b21-adrenoceptor activated ventricular ICl.PKA at submillimolar [Ni(2+)]: an action that is likely to involve an interaction between Ni(2+) and \u03b21-adrenoceptors. The concentration-dependence for ICl.PKA inhibition seen here indicates the potential for confounding effects on ICl,PKA to occur even at comparatively low Ni(2+) concentrations, when Ni(2+) is used to study other cardiac ionic currents under conditions of \u03b2-adrenergic agonism.",

Consequently, not only the prevalence of obesity but also the prevalence of obesity hypertension is increasing worldwide. In the context of antihypertensive treatment, data from clinical trials indicate that all first-line antihypertensive drugs possess a similar efficacy in reducing systemic blood pressure and hypertension-related end-organ damage in obese hypertensive subjects. Nevertheless, some antihypertensive agents, such as \u03b2-blockers or thiazide diuretics, may have unwanted side effects on the metabolic and hemodynamic abnormalities that occur in both obesity and hypertension. However, current guidelines still do not include recommendations for state-of-the-art treatment of obese patients with hypertension. Hence, the aim of this article is to provide recommendations for the appropriate use of antihypertensive agents in obese patients mostly based on personal expertise and pathophysiologic assumptions. For instance, thiazide diuretics and \u03b2-blockers are reported to reduce insulin sensitivity and (at least transiently) increase triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, whereas calcium channel blockers are metabolically neutral and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, and renin inhibition may increase insulin sensitivity. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in the adipose tissue has been implicated in the development of arterial hypertension and sodium retention plays a central role in the development of obesity-related hypertension. Therefore, treatment with a blocker of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system and a thiazide diuretic should be considered as first-line antihypertensive drug therapy in obesity hypertension.",

Treatment with conventional \u03b2-blockers, such as atenolol, has been associated with an increase in BPV; however, the extrapolation of these results to third generation \u03b2-blockers with pleiotropic effects seems to be inappropriate. The cardiovascular effects of third generation \u03b2-blockers, carvedilol and nebivolol, were assessed in sinoaortic-denervated rats (SAD) and compared with the second generation \u03b2-blocker atenolol and the calcium channel blocker verapamil, with a special focus on short-term BPV. Male SAD rats were acutely treated with carvedilol, nebivolol, atenolol or verapamil at two different doses, and the effects on blood pressure and BPV were recorded. Short-term BPV was assessed by the s.d. of BP recordings. Beat-to-beat BPV was studied using spectral analysis to assess the vascular sympatholytic activity of carvedilol and nebivolol by estimating the effects of these drugs on the ratio of low frequency (LF) to high frequency (HF) BPV (LF/HF ratio). Nebivolol, carvedilol and the calcium channel blocker verapamil significantly attenuated short-term BPV at both doses in SAD animals, and there were no differences between the drugs. Conversely, atenolol did not modify baseline s.d. values at either dose. Carvedilol and nebivolol significantly reduced the LF/HF ratio in SAD rats compared with the effects of atenolol and verapamil, suggesting the ability of the third generation \u03b2-blockers to reduce vascular sympathetic activity. In conclusion, third generation \u03b2-blockers induce a marked reduction in short-term BPV in SAD rats compared to atenolol. Moreover, the ability of carvedilol and nebivolol to reduce short-term BPV in SAD rats is equivalent to that of verapamil, suggesting that these \u03b2-blockers may have an additional beneficial effect through their control of short-term variability to a similar extent to calcium channel blockers.",

However, early regression of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) has not been reported, following short-term administration of these drugs. We tested the hypothesis that short-term administration of the cardioselective \u03b2-blocker esmolol induces early regression of LVH in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Fourteen-month-old male SHRs were treated i.v. with vehicle (SHR) or esmolol (SHR-E) (300\u2009\u03bcg\u2009kg(-1)\u2009min(-1)). Age-matched vehicle-treated male Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats served as controls.

The standardized uptake value (SUV) was applied to evaluate FDG (2-deoxy-2[18F]fluoro-D-glucose) uptake by the heart using PET/CT. Left ventricular subendocardial and subepicardial biopsies were taken to analyze changes in cross-sectional area (CSA) of left ventricular cardiomyocytes and the fibrosis was expressed as collagen volume fraction (CVF). LVMI was lower in SHR-E with respect to SHR (P=0.009). There were no significant differences in EF, E/A ratio or Edec time in SHR-E compared with SHR (P=0.17, 0.55 and P=0.80, respectively). PET acquisitions in SHR-E showed lower (18)F-FDG uptake than SHR (P=0.003). Interestingly, there were no significant differences in SUV in either SHR-E or WKY (P=0.63). CSA in subendocardial and subepicardial regions was minor in SHR-E with respect to SHR (P<0.001), and there were no significant differences in CVF between both groups.

The QT intervals obtained were corrected for the RR interval by applying individual probabilistic QT-rate correction formulae. Power spectral analysis of heart rate variability was performed to quantify each autonomic nervous function. Changes in QTc intervals and autonomic nervous tones were associated with the light-dark cycle. Parasympathetic nervous activity and QTc intervals significantly increased by approximately 10 ms during the dark period.Atropine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist, suppressed the increased parasympathetic tone and QTc prolongation during the dark period. In contrast, propranolol, a \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist, decreased the sympathetic activity and increased QTc intervals during the light period.

Short-term intravenous angiotensin II (AngII) receptor blocker therapy with candesartan (CN) attenuates increased SLPI and markers of early matrix/left ventricular (LV) in acute RMI. To determine whether reducing effects of AngII with CN or the vasopeptidase inhibitor omapatrilat (OMA) during the healing phase after RMI attenuates SLPI and other mediators of healing and matrix/LV remodeling, we measured these in Sprague-Dawley rats randomized to oral placebo, CN (30 mg/kg/day) or OMA (10 mg/kg/day) therapy during healing between days 2 and 23 after RMI and sham. On day-25, RMI-placebo showed significant LV remodeling, systolic/diastolic dysfunction and impaired passive compliance, and ischemic zone increases in SLPI, secreted-protein-acidic-and-rich-in-cysteine (SPARC) and osteopontin (OPN) mRNA and protein.

Carvedilol is an adrenergic antagonist which has been safely used in treatment of several cardiovascular disorders. Given that carvedilol has powerful antioxidant/anti-inflammatory properties, we aimed to investigate its protective potential against arthritis that may add further benefits for its clinical usefulness especially in RA patients with concomitant cardiovascular disorders. Two models were studied in the same rat; adjuvant arthritis and subcutaneous air pouch edema. Carvedilol (10mg/kg/day p.o. for 21days) effectively suppressed inflammation in both models with comparable efficacy to the standard anti-inflammatory diclofenac (5mg/kg/day p.o.). Notably, carvedilol inhibited paw edema and abrogated the leukocyte invasion to air pouch exudates. The latter observation was confirmed by the histopathological assessment of the pouch lining that revealed mitigation of immuno-inflammatory cell influx. Carvedilol reduced/normalized oxidative stress markers (lipid peroxides, nitric oxide and protein thiols) and lowered the release of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 & IL-6), and eicosanoids (PGE2 & LTB4) in sera and exudates of arthritic rats. Interestingly, carvedilol, per se, didn't present any effect on assessed biochemical parameters in normal rats. Together, the current study highlights evidences for the promising anti-arthritic effects of carvedilol that could be mediated through attenuation of leukocyte migration, alleviation of oxidative stress and suppression of proinflammatory cytokines and eicosanoids.",

STUDY SELECTION Randomized trials of headache treatment among children and adolescents (&lt;18 years old). INTERVENTION Any placebo-controlled trial or comparisons between 2 or more active medications. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Number of headaches per month. RESULTS Among 21 included trials, there were 13 placebo-controlled and 10 active comparator trials (2 also included placebo). Twenty trials focused on episodic migraines and 1 on chronic daily headaches. Drugs more effective than placebo for episodic migraines (&lt;15 headaches per month) included topiramate (difference in headaches per month, -0.71; 95% CI, -1.19 to -0.24) and trazodone (-0.60; 95% CI, -1.09 to -0.11). Ineffective drugs included clonidine, flunarizine, pizotifen, propranolol, and valproate. A single trial of fluoxetine for chronic daily headaches found it ineffective. Patients given placebo experienced a significant (P\u00a0=\u00a0.03) decline in headaches, from 5.6 (95% CI, 4.52-6.77; Q\u00a0=\u00a08.14 [Cochran Q is a measure of the heterogeneity of the included studies]) to 2.9 headaches per month (95% CI, 1.66-4.08; Q\u00a0=\u00a04.72). Among the 10 active comparator trials, flunarizine was more effective than piracetam (difference in headaches per month, -2.20; 95% CI, -3.93 to -0.47) but no better than aspirin, dihydroergotamine, or propranolol. Propranolol was compared with valproate as well as behavioral treatment, and 2 studies compared different doses of topiramate; none of these trials showed significant differences.

Patients with PE were more likely to suffer cardiovascular death (1-year estimated event-free survival: 86 \u00b1 5 vs. 95 \u00b1 1%; P = 0.01) and to require heart transplantation (1-year estimated event-free survival: 88 \u00b1 4 vs. 95 \u00b1 1%; P = 0.009). A multivariate Cox proportional hazard model revealed the following independent predictors of mortality: (a) PE (P = 0.04, hazard ratio (HR): 1.95, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.0-3.7), (b) age (P = 0.04, HR: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.0-1.04) and (c) LVEF <35% (P = 0.03, HR: 1.7, 95% CI: 1.1-2.8).",

They were first described by Krause in 1865. We report two cases of fistulous connexions between the circumflex coronary artery and the coronary sinus.", 
    "174": "Remarkable advancements have been made in understanding the pathophysiology of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), since the first implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) was placed in a human, more than 25 years ago to prevent sudden cardiac death (SCD). ICD has become the cornerstone in the management of HCM, with an ability to change the natural course of this complex disease. American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines have been charted out to help risk stratify asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic adults with HCM, in order to prevent SCD in such individuals. Our patient with left ventricular outflow tract gradient <30 mm Hg, left ventricular wall thickness < 30 mm, negative medical history of syncope and no family history of SCD, would have been at low risk for SCD.",

There is need to enhance the dissolution rate of carvedilol. The objective of our present investigation was to compare chitosan and chitosan chlorhydrate based various approaches for enhancement of dissolution rate of carvedilol.", 
    "176": "The different formulations were prepared by different methods like solvent change approach to prepare hydrosols, solvent evaporation technique to form solid dispersions and cogrind mixtures. The prepared formulations were characterized in terms of saturation solubility, drug content, infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), electron microscopy, in vitro dissolution studies and stability studies.", 
    "177": "The practical yield in case of hydrosols was ranged from 59.76 to 92.32%. The drug content was found to uniform among the different batches of hydrosols, cogrind mixture and solid dispersions ranged from 98.24 to 99.89%. There was significant improvement in dissolution rate of carvedilol with chitosan chlorhdyrate as compare to chitosan and explanation to this behavior was found in the differences in the wetting, solubilities and swelling capacity of the chitosan and chitosan salts, chitosan chlorhydrate rapidly wet and dissolve upon its incorporation into the dissolution medium, whereas the chitosan base, less water soluble, would take more time to dissolve.",

We examined clinical characteristics and outcomes (mortality/hospitalization, mortality, cardiovascular [CV] mortality/CV hospitalization, and CV mortality/HF hospitalization) by physician-reported COPD status using adjusted Cox models and explored an interaction with exercise training. The interaction between \u03b2-blocker cardioselectivity and outcomes was investigated.",

At baseline, patients with COPD had lower peak oxygen consumption and higher V(E)/V(CO)(2) slope. During a median follow-up of 2.5 years, COPD was associated with increased mortality/hospitalization, mortality, and CV mortality/HF hospitalization. After multivariable adjustment, the risk of CV mortality/HF hospitalization remained increased (hazard ratio [HR] 1.46, 95% CI 1.14-1.87), whereas mortality/hospitalization (HR 1.15, 95% CI 0.96-1.37) and mortality (HR 1.33, 95% CI 0.99-1.76) were not significantly increased. There was no interaction between COPD and exercise training on outcomes or between COPD and \u03b2-blocker selectivity on mortality/hospitalization (all P > .1).",

The mean rank of total perfusion scores for whole myocardium (irrespective of reversibility or irreversibility) in group B was not significantly different from that of group A, (65.75 vs. 55.25, P=0.096). Regarding the only irreversible perfusion defects, the mean rank of perfusion score in group B was higher than that of group A for whole myocardium (72 vs. 49, P=0.0001); however, no difference was noted between two groups for only reversible perfusion defects (61.0 vs. 60.0, P=0.898).

The objective of our investigation was to characterize the PKPD relationships and identify translational gaps across species following the administration of three compounds known to cause QTc interval prolongation, namely cisapride, d, l-sotalol and moxifloxacin.", 
    "195": "Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data from experiments in conscious dogs and clinical trials were included in this analysis. First, pharmacokinetic modelling and deconvolution methods were applied to derive drug concentrations at the time of each QT measurement. A Bayesian PKPD model was then used to describe QT prolongation, allowing discrimination of drug-specific effects from other physiological factors known to alter QT interval duration. A threshold of \u226510\u2009ms was used to explore the probability of prolongation after drug administration.", 
    "196": "A linear relationship was found to best describe the pro-arrhythmic effects of cisapride, d,l-sotalol and moxifloxacin both in dogs and in humans. The drug-specific parameter (slope) in dogs was statistically significantly different from humans. Despite such differences, our results show that the probability of QTc prolongation \u226510\u2009ms in dogs nears 100% for all three compounds at the therapeutic exposure range in humans.", 
    "197": "Our findings indicate that the slope of PKPD relationship in conscious dogs may be used as the basis for the prediction of drug-induced QTc prolongation in humans. Furthermore, the risk of QTc prolongation can be expressed in terms of the probability associated with an increase \u226510\u2009ms, allowing direct inferences about the clinical relevance of the pro-arrhythmic potential of a molecule.", 
    "198": "Prostate cancer patients have increased levels of stress and anxiety. Conversely, men who take beta blockers, which interfere with signaling from the stress hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline, have a lower incidence of prostate cancer; however, the mechanisms underlying stress-prostate cancer interactions are unknown. Here, we report that stress promotes prostate carcinogenesis in mice in an adrenaline-dependent manner. Behavioral stress inhibited apoptosis and delayed prostate tumor involution both in phosphatase and tensin homolog-deficient (PTEN-deficient) prostate cancer xenografts treated with PI3K inhibitor and in prostate tumors of mice with prostate-restricted expression of c-MYC (Hi-Myc mice) subjected to androgen ablation therapy with bicalutamide. Additionally, stress accelerated prostate cancer development in Hi-Myc mice. The effects of stress were prevented by treatment with the selective \u03b22-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) antagonist ICI118,551 or by inducible expression of PKA inhibitor (PKI) or of BCL2-associated death promoter (BAD) with a mutated PKA phosphorylation site (BADS112A) in xenograft tumors. Effects of stress were also blocked in Hi-Myc mice expressing phosphorylation-deficient BAD (BAD3SA). These results demonstrate interactions between prostate tumors and the psychosocial environment mediated by activation of an adrenaline/ADRB2/PKA/BAD antiapoptotic signaling pathway. Our findings could be used to identify prostate cancer patients who could benefit from stress reduction or from pharmacological inhibition of stress-induced signaling."
