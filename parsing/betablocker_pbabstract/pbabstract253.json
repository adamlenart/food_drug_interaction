On basis of experience, efficacy and costs beta-blockers and diuretics are first choice. However, the importance of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system in the pathophysiology of hypertensive end-organ damage is increasingly recognised nowadays, and modulation of this system may therefore exert favourable effects on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications. In the LIFE study, a recently published double-blinded, randomised trial, the angiotensin-II receptor (A-II) antagonist losartan was compared with the beta-blocker atenolol in patients with essential hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Patients randomised to the A-II antagonist suffered statistically significantly fewer clinical end-points, specifically fewer cerebrovascular accidents, whereas both treatments resulted in a similar decrease in blood pressure. In the subset of diabetic patients, the use of the A-II antagonist yielded an even more favourable outcome. In our opinion, it should now also be permitted to prescribe A-II antagonists as initial pharmacotherapy for patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension. It might be considered to prescribe A-II antagonists as preferred treatment for patients with essential hypertension and known LVH, especially in diabetic patients.",

In addition, NYHA class IV heart failure patients have been shown to benefit from carvedilol therapy, if tolerated. The conflicting results of GESICA and CHF-STAT studies do not support a strategy of \"prophylactic\" amiodarone therapy in patients with DCM in order to prevent sudden cardiac death.

It is believed that extinction establishes a new hierarchy of responses rather than an actual forgetting of the original response, which can usually reappear spontaneously after interruption of the extinction process. In this study, our aim was to analyze how profound extinction can be. Rats were trained in a one-trial, step-down inhibitory avoidance paradigm and then were exposed to several extinction sessions in which they were allowed to freely explore the apparatus for 30 sec after having stepped down. Extinction was complete enough so that there was no spontaneous recovery, and test session performance could not be enhanced by pharmacological agents with well known facilitative actions on retrieval. After being submitted to a new training session, control animals reacquired the avoidance response; however, animals failed to do so after receiving bilateral intra-CA1 infusions of either the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin or the mRNA synthesis blocker 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-d-ribofuranosyl benzimidazole 15 min before the retraining session. Our results indicate that extinction can be carried to a point at which reinstallment of the conditioned response requires, like the original learning, de novo gene expression and protein synthesis in the CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus.", 
    "48": "We have reported that glucose infusion in L-NAME-treated rats increased arterial pressure more than the additive responses to glucose and L-NAME alone. This suggested that nitric oxide synthesis inhibition potentiated the hypertensive response to chronic glucose infusion, and the heart rate data suggested an important role for the sympathetic nervous system. This study tested the role of the sympathetic nervous system by infusing glucose for 7 days in 4 groups of rats: L-NAME (L), L-NAME plus alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor blockade (LB), vehicle, or vehicle plus adrenergic receptor blockade (blockers). Mean arterial pressure (MAP, 24 hours per day) increased significantly in both the vehicle and blockers groups, confirming our previous reports. Likewise, MAP increased significantly more during glucose infusion in the L rats, from 120+/-3 mm Hg to 158+/-4 mm Hg by day 7, which was >3 times the increase in the vehicle rats. Heart rate also increased significantly in the L rats, from 391+/-4 to 426+/-8 bpm, and that increase was prevented completely in the LB rats. However, although the increase in MAP in the LB rats was significantly less than in the L rats, the hypertension was not prevented completely. The explanation for that partial inhibition is not clear, but the overall effectiveness of adrenergic receptor blockade to attenuate the potentiated hypertensive and tachycardic responses to glucose infusion in the L-NAME-treated rats versus the normal rats suggests that nitric oxide may help protect against hypertension during glucose infusion through suppression of sympathetic activity.", 
    "49": "We previously demonstrated that the overexpression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) decreases blood pressure, heart rate (HR), and sympathetic nerve activity and that these effects are enhanced in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). The aim of this study was to determine if an increase in NO production in the RVLM caused by the overexpression of eNOS improves the impaired baroreflex control of HR in SHRSP. We transfected adenovirus vectors encoding eNOS (AdeNOS) into the RVLM of SHRSP or Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). Mean arterial pressure and HR were measured by a radio-telemetry system in the conscious state. Reflex changes in HR were elicited by intravenous infusion of either phenylephrine, sodium nitroprusside, or hydralazine at day 7 after the gene transfer. The maximum gain of the baroreflex control of HR was significantly decreased in SHRSP compared with WKY. Overexpression of eNOS in the RVLM of SHRSP improved the impaired maximum gain of the baroreflex control of HR. After treatment with atropine, the maximum gain was still significantly greater in SHRSP in the AdeNOS-transfected group than in the nontransfected group, although it was decreased in both groups. In contrast, after treatment with metoprolol, the maximum gain did not differ between the two groups. These results indicate that an increase in NO production in the RVLM improves the impaired baroreflex control of HR in SHRSP and that these effects may have resulted from a cardiac sympathoinhibitory effect of NO in the RVLM of SHRSP.", 
    "50": "Mice lacking catecholamines die before birth, some with cardiovascular abnormalities. To investigate the role of catecholamines in development, embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) fetuses were cultured and heart rate monitored. Under optimal oxygenation, wild-type and catecholamine-deficient fetuses had the same initial heart rate (200-220 beats/min), which decreased by 15% in wild-type fetuses during 50 min of culture. During the same culture period, catecholamine-deficient fetuses dropped their heart rate by 35%. Hypoxia reduced heart rate of wild-type fetuses by 35-40% in culture and by 20% in utero, assessed by echocardiography. However, catecholamine-deficient fetuses exhibited greater hypoxia-induced bradycardia, reducing their heart rate by 70-75% in culture. Isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) agonist, reversed this extreme bradycardia, restoring the rate of catecholamine-deficient fetuses to that of nonmutant siblings. Moreover, isoproterenol rescued 100% of catecholamine-deficient pups to birth in a dose-dependent, stereo-specific manner when administered in the dam's drinking water. An alpha-AR agonist was without effect. When wild-type fetuses were cultured with adrenoreceptor antagonists to create pharmacological nulls, blockade of alpha-ARs with 10 microM phentolamine or beta-ARs with 10 microM bupranolol alone or in combination did not reduce heart rate under optimal oxygenation. However, when combined with hypoxia, beta-AR blockade reduced heart rate by 35%. In contrast, the muscarinic blocker atropine and the alpha-AR antagonist phentolamine had no effect. These data suggest that beta-ARs mediate survival in vivo and regulate heart rate in culture. We hypothesize that norepinephrine, acting through beta-ARs, maintains fetal heart rate during periods of transient hypoxia that occur throughout gestation, and that catecholamine-deficient fetuses die because they cannot withstand hypoxia-induced bradycardia.", 
    "51": "Studies were done to investigate the actions of ACTH on the expression of CYP2D16 in the guinea pig adrenal cortex. Guinea pigs were treated with ACTH for 1, 3, or 7 days. In addition, some animals received ACTH for 7 days and were then untreated for an additional 3 or 7 days to test for reversibility of ACTH actions. ACTH treatment caused a time-dependent decrease in the rates of adrenal microsomal bufuralol metabolism, a CYP2D-catalyzed reaction; hepatic bufuralol metabolism was unaffected by ACTH. Adrenal enzyme activity was significantly reduced by ACTH within 1 day and decreased by 80% after 7 days. Western blotting and in situ hybridization analyses revealed corresponding declines in adrenal CYP2D16 protein and mRNA concentrations. Nuclear runoff assays indicated that ACTH treatment inhibited CYP2D16 expression at the transcriptional level. Adrenal 17 alpha-hydroxylase activities were increased by ACTH treatment, but CYP17 protein concentrations were not affected. Following cessation of ACTH administration, the rates of adrenal bufuralol metabolism and CYP2D16 protein and mRNA concentrations returned to control levels within 7 days. The results demonstrate that ACTH has a relatively rapid and reversible effect to inhibit adrenal CYP2D16 transcription, thereby decreasing adrenal xenobiotic metabolism. Thus, the actions of ACTH on CYP2D16 expression are opposite to those on other adrenal p450 isozymes, indicating unique regulatory mechanisms.",

DESIGN Monkeys fed a high-cholesterol diet for 6 months were divided into two groups: one group was given an ARB, CS-866 (10 mg/kg per day), and the other group was not. The control group was fed a normal diet. RESULTS Blood pressure and the plasma cholesterol level were not affected by CS-866. Plasma levels of angiotensin II, renin, angiotensin converting enzyme and chymase were not changed by the high-cholesterol diet, whereas vascular angiotensin converting enzyme, but not chymase, was significantly increased. Serum levels of macrophage-colony stimulating factor, transforming growth factor-beta1 and intracellular adhesion molecule-1 were significantly increased in monkeys fed a high-cholesterol diet but they were suppressed by CS-866. The relaxation response of isolated carotid arteries to acetylcholine was suppressed in the high-cholesterol group, whereas it was improved by CS-866. CONCLUSIONS CS-866 reduced lipid deposition along with the suppression of serum macrophage-colony stimulating factor, transforming growth factor-beta 1 and intracellular adhesion molecule-1, and the improvement of vascular functions, suggesting that ARB has multiple mechanisms for reducing lipid deposition in primates.", 
    "58": "1 The present study investigated the effects of the preferential beta(3)-AR agonist BRL 37344 (BRL) on force of contraction (FOC), Ca(2+)-transient and eNOS-activity in human right atrial myocardium. 2 BRL concentration-dependently caused an increase in FOC that was paralleled by an increase in Ca(2+)-transient and a shortening of time to half peak relaxation (T0.5T). These effects were abolished in the presence of propranolol (0.3 micro M). 3 BRL acted as a competitive antagonist towards isoprenaline and in binding experiments it was shown to have a distinct affinity towards beta(1/2)-AR. 4 In immunohistochemical experiments BRL (10 micro M) increased detection of activated eNOS. This effect remained constant in the presence of propranolol (0.3 micro M). 5 BRL increased directly detected NO in DAF-staining experiments. This increase was significantly smaller in the presence of the NO-inhibitor L-NAME. 6 The inotropic effects of BRL were not changed in the presence of L-NMA. 7 These results suggest that the inotropic effects of BRL in human atrium are mediated via beta(1/2)-AR, whereas the increase of atrial eNOS-activity is due to beta(3)- adrenergic stimulation. This increase in eNOS-activity did not influence atrial myocardial contractility. In conclusion, this study shows that beta(3)-adrenergic stimulation is present in human atrium, but may not be functionally as significant as in the left ventricle.",

Cardiol., 96, 290]--correlated inversely with the sTNF-R2 data (Pearson, r = -0.46; P = 0.041; Spearman, r = -0.64, P = 0.002). 5 The present data indicate an interaction of the neurohumoral and the cytokine system in CHF patients at the cAMP level. Thus, measurement and correlation of sTNF-R2 and cAMP may provide a tool useful during investigation of beta-blocker therapy.",

    "64": "Insulin can influence the vasculature by a sympathetically mediated vasoconstriction and a vasodilatation; the latter effect predominates in the renal circulation of anesthetized pigs. We determined the effect of intravenous infusion of insulin on coronary blood flow in pentobarbitone-anesthetized pigs at constant heart rate, arterial pressure and blood levels of glucose and potassium. In 6 pigs, infusion of 0.004 IU kg(-1) min(-1) of insulin decreased coronary flow despite increasing left ventricular dP dT(max)(-1); when the latter was abolished by propranolol, the coronary flow response was augmented. The mechanisms of this response were examined in 22 pigs given propranolol. Phentolamine changed coronary flow response to an increase (6 pigs) and this was abolished by intracoronary injection of N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 5 pigs). L-NAME augmented coronary flow response (6 pigs) and this was abolished by phentolamine (5 pigs). In 18 pigs given propranolol, three incremental doses of insulin caused graded coronary flow decreases whether L-NAME was given (6 pigs) or not (6 pigs) beforehand, and caused graded coronary flow increases after phentolamine (6 pigs). Thus insulin caused a coronary vasoconstriction mediated by sympathetic alpha-adrenergic effects and a vasodilatation related to the release of nitric oxide. The net effect was a coronary vasoconstriction.",

    "70": "Variceal hemorrhage accounts for one third of all deaths related to cirrhosis. To date, many modalities of treating variceal bleeding have been devised, including pharmacological therapy. Treatment of variceal hemorrhage includes resuscitation, initial hemostasis, and prevention of complications and recurrent bleeding. Intravenous vasoactive agents such as terlipressin, somatostatin, octreotide, or vapreotide should be administered in patients with suspected variceal bleeding. Endoscopic treatment remains the mainstay of treatment. Endoscopic variceal ligation is safer and more efficacious than sclerotherapy as initial treatment of bleeding esophageal varices, whereas cyanoacrylate injection is the endoscopic treatment of choice for gastric varices. An adjuvant vasoactive agent is useful for the prevention of early rebleeding. Prophylactic antibiotics are increasingly used for prevention of infection, notably spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Follow-up endoscopic treatment is necessary in order to obliterate residual varices. The combination of a beta blocker and nitrate is an essential component of secondary prophylaxis for recurrent variceal bleeding. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt or surgery offers the best salvage therapy in patients with failed hemostasis or breakthrough recurrent bleeding despite medical and endoscopic therapy. Endoscopic ultrasonography is useful in the prediction of recurrence of varices and facilitates visualization and guidance of further treatment of gastric varices. Despite advances in the treatment of variceal bleeding, liver function remains the determining factor of patient survival. Liver transplantation is the only definitive treatment that can alter the course of the disease.",

Recently, intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which caused the inflammatory stimuli in the brain, was demonstrated to increase the outflow of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system. In this study, to clarify the physiological role of sympathetic nerves to bone metabolism in vivo, we examined the effect of LPS (i.c.v.) on the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) mRNA in mouse calvaria, using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis. The expression of COX-2 mRNA was increased by LPS (i.c.v.) in mouse calvaria. The treatment with the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine or beta-blocker inhibited the central LPS-induced COX-2 mRNA in mouse calvaria. In addition, the treatment of calvaria with isoprenaline, beta-agonist, or noradrenaline increased PGE(2) synthesis in the organ culture system. These findings show that central LPS-induced COX-2 mRNA was mediated by the activation of postganglionic sympathetic nerve fibers and beta-adrenoceptor in mouse calvaria and suggest that in vivo activation of the sympathetic nervous system modulates bone metabolism.",

Asp301 has generally been considered to be involved in electrostatic docking with the basic substrates, on the basis of previous modeling studies and site-directed mutagenesis. Substitution of Glu216 with a residue other than Asp strongly attenuated the binding of quinidine, bufuralol, and several other P450 2D6 ligands. Catalytic activity with the substrates bufuralol and 4-methoxyphenethylamine was strongly inhibited by neutral or basic mutations at Glu216 (>95%), to the same extent as the substitution of Asn at Asp301. Unlike the Asp301 mutants, the Gln216 mutant (E216Q) retained 40% enzyme efficiency with the substrate spirosulfonamide, devoid of basic nitrogen, suggesting that the substitutions at Glu216 affect binding of amine substrates more than other catalytic steps. Attempts to induce catalytic specificity toward new substrates by substitutions at Asp301 and Glu216 were unsuccessful. Collectively, the results provide evidence for electrostatic interaction of amine substrates with Glu216, and we propose that both of these acidic residues plus at least another residue(s) is (are) involved in binding the repertoire of P450 2D6 ligands.",

Parameters of glucose metabolism were not adversely affected by both drugs. Stable pharmacokinetics were observed over the 12-week administration, and steady state conditions were achieved after a 1-week treatment with both active compounds in the target population. Data indicate that once-a-day dosing can be performed with less fluctuation between peak and trough for talinolol in comparison to atenolol. Both treatments were well tolerated.",

Item scores are summed to yield a total score. Secondary analysis of data were from two multinational trials (n = 629; 765). The BCSS item and total scores exhibited evidence of internal consistency (alpha = 0.70 daily; 0.95 to 0.99 over time) and reproducibility (ICC = 0.77 to 0.88). Correlations (r) with pulmonary function (FEV1 % predicted, PEF) were -0.01 (n.s.) to -0.36 (P < 0.001).

The laboratory findings were suggestive of an adrenal genesis. Abdominal computed tomography revealed macronodular hyperplasia of both adrenal glands. Specific endocrinological tests demonstrated an increased secretion of cortisol during adrenergic stimulation which, however, was absent following beta-blocker medication. This would seem to point to an aberrant, beta-receptor-mediated regulation of cortisol secretion as being the cause of increased cortisol production. ACTH-independent bilateral macronodular adrenocortical hyperplasia was also noted in the patient's mother. Neither the father nor the brother were affected by the disease. Apart from one case of familial appearance involving mother and daughter previously reported in the literature, this is the second description of a familial appearance and the first case involving mother and son. The patient underwent a left-sided adrenalectomy. Quick postoperative normalization of S-cortisol day profile and excretion of free dU-cortisol were noted under supportive temporary blockade of beta-receptors.

    "85": "5-Hydroxydecanoate (5-HD) inhibits ischaemic and pharmacological preconditioning of the heart. Since 5-HD is thought to inhibit specifically the putative mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channel, this channel has been inferred to be a mediator of preconditioning. However, it has recently been shown that 5-HD is a substrate for acyl-CoA synthetase, the mitochondrial enzyme which 'activates' fatty acids. Here, we tested whether activated 5-HD, 5-hydroxydecanoyl-CoA (5-HD-CoA), is a substrate for medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD), the committed step of the mitochondrial beta-oxidation pathway. Using a molecular model, we predicted that the hydroxyl group on the acyl tail of 5-HD-CoA would not sterically hinder the active site of MCAD. Indeed, we found that 5-HD-CoA was a substrate for purified human liver MCAD with a Km of 12.8 +/- 0.6 microM and a kcat of 14.1 s-1. For comparison, with decanoyl-CoA (Km approximately 3 microM) as substrate, kcat was 6.4 s-1. 5-HD-CoA was also a substrate for purified pig kidney MCAD. We next tested whether the reaction product, 5-hydroxydecenoyl-CoA (5-HD-enoyl-CoA), was a substrate for enoyl-CoA hydratase, the second enzyme of the beta-oxidation pathway. Similar to decenoyl-CoA, purified 5-HD-enoyl-CoA was also a substrate for the hydratase reaction. In conclusion, we have shown that 5-HD is metabolised at least as far as the third enzyme of the beta-oxidation pathway. Our results open the possibility that beta-oxidation of 5-HD or metabolic intermediates of 5-HD may be responsible for the inhibitory effects of 5-HD on preconditioning of the heart.",

Twenty-one patients on amiodarone for at least 30 days were referred to our hospital for internal EC of a persistent AF refractory to external EC. They were randomized to receive only amiodarone (group AMI, n=7), or amiodarone and verapamil 240 mg/day (group VER, n=7), or amiodarone and metoprolol 100 mg/day (group MET, n=7). Left AERP was measured 10 min and 24 h after EC. AERP was also determined in 13 controls. The AERP after 10 min was significantly shorter in group AMI (201 (31) ms, P<0.02) and group MET (203 (34) ms, P<0.03) than in controls (249 (45) ms), but not in group VER (237 (51) ms, P=NS).

Dobutamine administration (10 microg/kg/min) during the reperfusion period resulted in deterioration of functional recovery, which was abolished by propranolol administration. Long-term thyroxine pretreatment (12.5 microg 100 g(-1) body weight, b.i.d., s.c., for 2 weeks) reversed the detrimental effect of dobutamine and increased postischaemic recovery of function.

Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) directly block the effect of angiotensin II, derived from any source, at the receptor level and have the potential to be as effective or even more effective than ACE inhibitors. The results of a number of clinical studies have demonstrated ARBs are effective and well tolerated.

Administration of norepinephrine has been shown to impair exercise responses in those with congestive heart failure, and the recent effort to incorporate beta blocker therapy into the standard management of heart failure patients addresses this abnormal neurohormonal process. Studies with central-acting sympatholytics have shown mixed results. The use of drugs such as clonidine has been suggested as potentially useful therapy in the long-term management of patients with heart failure, but definitive conclusions await further study. Regular exercise has been shown to reduce resting norepinephrine levels in heart failure subjects. This may serve as an additional rationale to recommend chronic exercise for these patients.",

Levobunolol, known to inhibit aqueous humor inflow in humans, slowed decay. Dimethylamiloride, an inhibitor of the Na(+),H(+) exchanger that is known to act on cultured cells of both the ciliary epithelium and trabecular meshwork and to lower mouse intraocular pressure (IOP), enhanced decay.

The European Cardiology Association task-force has recently recalled that the treatment for heart failure should be considered differently according to the regions within Europe. However, most studies have involved North American or Australasian subjects. The results of these studies have shown that carvedilol improves the symptomatic status of patients with mild to moderate chronic heart failure, but their extrapolation to the situation in Europe is questionable. In the present study, the authors have reported on the use of this beta-blocker over a 6-month period in 48 European subjects (an older patient population, and more frequently given digitalis treatment) with mild to moderate stage II and III chronic heart failure (mean NYHA functional stage = 2.75 +/- 0.2; mean left ventricular ejection fraction = 32.4 +/- 3.4). Six patients (12.5%) were obliged to withdraw from the study due to adverse reactions to carvedilol, i.e., 2 subjects during the test-dose (4.2%) and 4 others who were subsequently unable to withstand the progressive stepping up of drug dosage (8.3%). In the remaining 42 patients, the mean NYHA scores dropped significantly from 2.75 +/- 0.2 to 1.8 +/- 0.1 (p < 0.05) at the end of the study period, indicating an increase in symptomatic improvement with a favorable hemodynamic tolerance profile, even in cases of combined therapy with digitalis. This study confirms the positive action of carvedilol on functional symptomatology in southern European patients presenting with mild to moderate chronic heart failure. However, it should be emphasized that this beta-blocker should only be administered under strict and specialized medical surveillance as its effect of significantly slowing down the heart rate could also result in cardiac insufficiency.", 
    "105": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the short-term benefit of a beta-blocker (atenolol) on clinical and echocardiographic parameters of patients presenting isolated or predominant mitral stenosis in sinus rhythm. It is a prospective study performed on 26 patients who have had a clinical and echocardiographic assessment before and 15 days after treatment by atenolol. After 15 days of beta-blocker treatment, there is a significant improvement of dyspnea (57.6% in class III or IV before beta-blockade versus 15.3% with atenolol; P = 0.001) and a significant decrease of the heart rate (83.3 +/- 15.2 versus 68.9 +/- 13.9; P = 0.001) and the diastolic blood pressure (8 mmHg +/- 1.3 versus 7.2 mmHg +/- 0.9; P = 0.01). The Doppler echocardiography shows a significant increase of the stroke volume calculated by the Doppler method (28.7 +/- 6.2 versus 38.6 +/- 9.7 mL; P = 0.04). There is an insignificant trend to an improvement of the left ventricular systolic function, an increase of cardiac output and the decrease of the mean transmitral gradient. The factors associated with the failure of beta-blocker treatment are: the right heart failure (P = 0.04) and the low diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.01). The beta-blockers could be a logical and effective treatment of patients with mitral stenosis waiting for balloon commissurotomy or surgery.", 
    "106": "Studies conducted over recent years have definitively confirmed beta-blockers as the major treatment for heart failure. However, they are difficult to use and, to date, only carvedilol has been granted a Marketing Authorisation for this indication. The practical aspects of treatment with carvedilol in these patients are reviewed.", 
    "107": "The risk of interference with anaesthesia and the risk of decompensation of the disease must be considered for each drug. Beta-blockers reduce the body's capacity to react to hypovolaemia, but they are beneficial by limiting the response to nociceptive stimuli and by reducing the incidence of myocardial ischaemia. Treatment should therefore be continued. Interferences with the dihydropyridine class of calcium channel blockers on peripheral vasomotor activity are moderate and additive. These agents are well tolerated and can be continued until the operation. Verapamil and diltiazem have a chronotropic and negative inotropic effect which is additive with that of anaesthetics. Administration of these drugs before the operation does not raise any major problems, nor does their discontinuation. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, used in hypertension and heart failure, considerably reduce the tolerance of factors modifying the blood pressure equilibrium, especially hypovolaemia or haemorrhage. In practice, ACE inhibitors carry a risk of intraoperative hypotension, requiring the use of vasopressor amines to maintain blood pressure. Continuation of treatment has only minimal advantages, regardless of the indication and there is no risk of rebound effect after stopping treatment. The treatment washout period depends on the duration of action of the product. However, discontinuation of treatment is never imperative, regardless of the context.", 
    "108": "Due to their electrophysiological characteristics, class 1 antiarrhythmic drugs can induce an auricular flutter with a 1/1 response. In addition to antiarrhythmic treatment, several authors have therefore considered using drugs capable of slowing auriculoventricular nodal conduction and preventing the 1/1 response. Beta-blockers have been proposed as candidate drugs. In this study, two patients were treated with an association of class 1 antiarrhythmic drugs (cibenzoline in one case, flecainide in the other) and beta-blockers. The administration of these drugs resulted in an atrial proarrhythmic response, and wide QRS tachycardia. Although both subjects had underlying heart disease, the tachycardia was relatively well tolerated in both instances. It was concluded that although beta-blockers may not suppress the risk of atrial proarrhythmia, they at least permit an improved tolerance to this complication.", 
    "109": "The drug treatment of chronic coronary insufficiency in diabetic patients is now well defined. Platelet antiaggregants, especially aspirin, must be prescribed in the long-term or even indefinitely. Other drugs (beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, etc.) can be used in the same way as in the absence of diabetes. Angioplasty gives immediate favourable results in diabetics, very similar to those obtained in the absence of diabetes. In contrast, the longer term prognosis is less favourable, as the mortability, myocardial infarction, restenosis and bypass graft rates are significantly higher. First-line stenting lowers the restenosis rate to a level comparable to that observed in non-diabetics. However, instrumental revascularization is less complete than surgical revascularization and the number of redilatations and/or secondary bypass grafts remains high. The indications, mortality and early complications of coronary surgery are now identical to those observed in the absence of diabetes. Its long-term results are significantly more favourable than those of medical treatment or even angioplasty, although this issue is still controversial. The improved prognosis observed in operated diabetic coronary patients is due to the more frequent use of arterial bypass grafts. The maintenance of blood glucose control and correction of the frequently associated cardiovascular risk factors (obesity, sedentary lifestyle, smoking, HT, dyslipidaemia) increase the efficacy of treatment of coronary insufficiency in diabetic patients. This goal can only be achieved by permanent, unfailing collaboration between cardiologists and diabetologists.", 
    "110": "The benefits of treatment of hypertension in the elderly have been demonstrated by the results of therapeutic trials conducted in subjects over the age of 60. In 1985, the EWPHE trial, which demonstrated that thiazide diuretics decreased the main cardiovascular complications observed in elderly hypertensives, opened the way to the demonstration of the preventive efficacy of other classes of antihypertensives. The high level of cardiovascular risk observed in the elderly explains why prescription of antihypertensives provides a greater benefit in elderly hypertensives than in younger hypertensives. In hypertensive patients over the age of 80, the benefits of drug-induced blood pressure reduction have been demonstrated in terms of prevention of nonfatal complications.", 
    "111": "The authors report the case of a 60-year-old man admitted for uncomplicated acute myocardial infarction. The history of persistent fronto-occipital headaches and palpation of bilateral tortuous temporal arteries with a decreased pulse suggested the diagnosis of temporal arteritis, particularly in the presence of marked laboratory signs of inflammation and the coronary angiograph findings. The diagnosis was confirmed by temporal artery biopsy. Treatment consisted of corticosteroid therapy, with a satisfactory outcome at three months. The diagnosis of temporal arteritis should be systematically suggested in patients over the age of 50 years, presenting with a marked inflammatory syndrome and recent-onset arterial disease. Similarly, any form of arterial disease occurring during treated temporal arteritis should initially be considered to be a secondary site of the arteritis, requiring intensification of corticosteroid therapy.", 
    "112": "Due to its vascular and platelet 5-HT2 receptor antagonist properties and its metabolic properties, naftidrofuryl specifically counteracts local ischaemic phenomena. One of its major indications is the treatment of intermittent claudication, but it is well known that peripheral arterial disease is the sign of diffuse arterial disease, associated with particularly lethal coronary disease. Recent studies increasingly implicate serotonin (5-HT) in coronary ischaemic processes. In view of the similarities between these pathophysiological data and the characteristics of this molecule, we decide to evaluate the coronary protection afforded by naftidrofuryl and its safety. This multicentre double-blind placebo-controlled study was conducted in 51 patients over a period of one month. Inclusion criteria were stable angina with an electrically positive stress test, despite antianginal treatment either by beta-blocker or by calcium channel blocker. Follow-up comprised clinical assessment and a stress test on inclusion and at 1 month. The groups were comparable on inclusion. Overall, the results showed a greater improvement with naftidrofuryl than with reference treatment for all parameters studied. Significant differences were observed in favour of the verum group for time to onset of ST depression, the maximum level reached, the number of stress tests which became negative and the patient's global assessment. No problems of interaction with concomitant treatments, particularly beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers or antiarrhythmics was observed. This study shows that naftidrofuryl allows improvement of ergometric parameters and especially elevation of the ischaemic threshold on exertion.", 
    "113": "Treatment of acute coronary insufficiency in diabetics--recent myocardial infarction (MI--unstable angina--uses the same modalities as in the absence of diabetes. Thrombolytics improve the prognosis of MI, although the hospital mortality remains about two fold in the presence of diabetes. Primary angioplasty has an identical success rate, but restenoses are significantly more frequent in diabetics. Systematic use of stents allows a reduction of the restenosis rate to the level observed in the absence of diabetes. In unstable angina, low molecular weight heparins have an efficacy and a safety identical to those observed in non-diabetic patients. There is therefore no limitation to their use. Diabetics present permanent activation of blood platelets which promotes their adhesion and aggregation. Aspirin must therefore be systematically prescribed to diabetic patients, except in the presence of a contraindication, especially gastrointestinal, in which case, ticlopidine can be used. Platelet glycoprotein IIB-IIIA receptor inhibitors have the same indications and provide the same results as in the absence of diabetes. Contrary to a widely held belief, beta-blockers, especially cardioselective, can be widely used in diabetics. The same applies to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Finally, during the acute phase of coronary insufficiency, continuous insulin infusion via a pump ensures better control of diabetes and also decreases the mortality of MI. Permanent collaboration between cardiologists and diabetologists is therefore essential to increase the efficacy of treatment and to improve the prognosis of acute coronary insufficiency in diabetic patients.", 
    "114": "A major advance in understanding the pathophysiology of the heart failure syndrome has been an understanding of the process of left ventricular (LV) remodeling. After any insult to the left ventricle resulting in diminished systolic performance and stroke volume, a series of histopathologic changes in the myocardium and structural changes in the LV chamber occurs over time.", 
    "115": "Early work on understanding this process of LV remodeling emerged from the studies of Pfeffer and colleagues, who used a rat model of myocardial infarction (MI). Compared to those with smaller MIs, rats with larger induced MIs underwent a substantially greater degree of chamber remodeling over time, and importantly, these structural changes were associated with significantly higher morality. These studies established for the first time the relation between the structural changes now widely known as LV remodeling and a natural history outcome in the setting of LV systolic dysfunction. Subsequently, these investigators demonstrated that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with captopril, when initiated soon after the induced MI, attenuated the remodeling process. Also observed was an improvement in survival among rats in whom the remodeling process has been attenuated. These important data paved the way for human studies that have subsequently provided substantial evidence to support two important concepts: (1) that LV remodeling is related to clinical outcomes that represent the natural history of the heart failure syndrome such as mortality and surrogate markers of the progression of heart failure, and (2) that therapeutic interventions in humans that slow or reverse the process of LV remodeling, such as ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers, appear to have a favorable effect on that natural history.", 
    "116": "This review will examine the issue of the relation between LV remodeling and clinical outcomes in the human heart failure syndrome from several interrelated aspects: (1) the relation between LV volume at one time point and subsequent oucome, (2) the relation between changes in LV volumes over time (LV remodeling) and clinical outcomes, and (3) the relation between the effect of medical therapeutic interventions on the LV remodeling process and the effect of those same medical interventions on natural history outcomes in human heart failure.", 
    "117": "Bioadhesive sodium alginate microspheres of Metoprolol tartrate (MT) for intranasal systemic delivery were prepared to avoid the first-pass effect, as an alternative therapy to injection, and to obtain improved therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of hypertension and angina pectoris. The microspheres (Ms) were prepared using emulsification--cross-linking method. The formulation variables were drug loading, polymer concentration, cross-linking agent concentration, and cross-linking time. The Ms were evaluated for characteristics, like particle size, incorporation efficiency, swelling ability, in vitro bioadhesion, in vitro drug release, and in vivo pharmacodynamic performance in rabbits against isoprenaline-induced tachycardia. Treatment of in vitro data to different kinetic equations indicated matrix-diffusion controlled drug delivery from sodium alginate Ms. Polymer concentration, cross-linking agent concentration, and cross-linking time influenced the drug release profiles significantly. In vivo studies indicated significantly improved therapeutic efficacy of MT from Ms with sustained and controlled inhibition of isoprenaline-induced tachycardia as compared with oral and nasal administration of drug solution.", 
    "118": "Acute myocardial infarction is the leading cause of death in the industrialized world and the paramount goal is establishing early, complete, and sustained reperfusion at the myocardial tissue level. For hospitals without the capacity to perform emergent percutaneous coronary intervention, fibrinolytic therapy plays a critical role although it is limited by a 67% success rate. Despite promising pilot studies, reduced-dose fibrinolytic therapy with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa therapy (GUSTO-V) and full-dose fibrinolytic therapy with enoxaparin (ASSENT-3) or bivalirudin (HERO-2) provide only marginally improved clinical outcomes. Adjunctive in-hospital and secondary preventive measures should include an aspirin, a beta-blocker, an ACE inhibitor, and a statin, based on the Heart Protection Study, unless contraindicated. Patients should be risk stratified, participate in a cardiac rehabilitation program, cease smoking tobacco, and have an intracardiac defibrillator (ICD) implanted if their LV systolic function is < or = 30% at one month based on the MADIT-2 trial.",

The main epidemiological and clinical variables were recorded at admission, and the complications, treatments, and clinical status were recorded at release.Results. HF patients had a mean age of 75.5 12 years (women 78.5 years and men 72.6 years). The average hospitalization time was 11 8 days and 50.8% were first admissions. Total hospital mortality was 6.8%. Fifty-nine percent (58.9%) of patients had arterial hypertension, 31.9% ischemic heart disease, 27.6% cardiac valve disease, 28.5% diabetes mellitus, and 32.5% chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patients admitted to cardiology ward were younger (72.5 13 vs 77.4 11 years; p < 0.005), more frequently men (51.9 vs 43.7%; p < 0.005), more often first hospitalizations (54.8 vs 48.4%; p < 0.005), and acute pulmonary edema was more common (22.8 vs 9.2%; p < 0.005). The odds ratio (and 95% CI) for therapeutic and diagnostic procedures in relation to admission ward (reference group internal medicine-geriatrics), adjusted for age, sex, systolic function, number of hospitalizations, and history of dementia, hypertension, COPD, AMI, valve disease and ischemic heart disease, are: echocardiogram, 3.49 (2.58-4.73); catheterization, 6.42 (3.29-12.55), admission to intensive care, 3.94 (2.15-7.25), revascularization, 2.15 (0.57-8.08), and beta-blocker treatment, 3.39 (1.93-5.97).

All developments were carried out at lower temperature (2-4 degrees C, in a refrigerator) in small glass jars of 250 mL volume. These two drugs were not resolved at room temperature (15-30 degrees C). Analytical reagent grade methanol and dichloromethane can be directly used as mobile phase without further drying. The chiral separation occured over a range from 40% to 70% (optimum 67%) dichloromethane in the mobile phase volume ratio and 55% to 80% (optimum 60%) dichloromethane in the mobile phase volume ratio.

Moderate selectivities were observed for aromatic compounds having a second substituent in the ortho-position. The overall retention was influenced by the aromaticity of the analytes as well as the presence of free electron pairs in the molecule. Increased concentrations of CMPA gave higher retention and also increased the enantioselectivity. The practical utility of this present enantioselective system was demonstrated on one batch of (S)-metoprolol that was N-methylated with methyl iodide. The enantiomeric separation was accomplished within 10 min."
