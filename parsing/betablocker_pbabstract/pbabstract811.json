    "0": "1. On guinea-pig papillary muscle we investigated whether a prolonging effect of noradrenaline on the duration of the cardiac ventricular action potential (AP) is attributable to an action on beta-adrenoceptors. 2. Propranolol (5 X 10(-6) M), which itself shortens AP (at 90% repolarization level), inhibits both effects of noradrenaline on the AP, i.e. the sustained prolongation by low concentrations (10(-7)--10(-6)M) and the steady-state shortening which follows an initial prolongation by a high concentration (10(-5)M). In the presence of propranolol, the prlonging effect of noradrenaline is shifted to higher concentrations (10(-6)--10(-5)M). This prolongation of AP duration does not exceed the prior shortening effect by propranolol; it is not prevented by 10(-5)M phentolamine. 3. Phentolamine, which itself prolongs AP duration, inhibits neither the initial prolongation nor the steady-state shortening of the AP by 10(-5)M noradrenaline. Instead, the biphasic change in AP duration as well as the positive inotropic effect of 10(-5)M noradrenaline are enhanced in the presence of 3Z10(-6)M phentolamine. 4. The effect of isoprenaline on the duration of AP qualitatively resembles that of noradrenaline. In a concentration of 10(-8)M, isoprenaline produces a sustained prolongation of the AP; concentrations of 10(-7)M and 10(-6)M cause an initial prolongation which is followed by a steady-state shortening. These effects are inhibited by propranolol. 5. It is concluded that not only the steady-state shortening effect on AP duration by 10(-5)M noradrenaline but also the prolongation of AP, induced by lower noradrenaline concentrations (10(-7)--10(-6)M), are mediated solely by an action on beta-adrenoceptors.",

His bundle recordings and atrial stimulation studies suggest atrioventricular nodal reentry precipitated by three different mechanisms. Therapy required permanent coronary vein pacing and drugs.",

    "3": "Effects of sympathomimetics and sympatholitics were studied on the biliary system of guinea-pigs (in vitro) and rabbits (in vitro and in vivo). Contractions and relaxations produced by sympathomimetic amines are mediated by alpha-excitatory and beta-inhibitoray adrenoceptors in the biliary system (gallbladder, common bile duct and sphinctor of oddi) of guinea-pigs. Sympathomimetic amines caused relaxations in the sphincter of oddi in rabbits (in vitro and in vivo) and responses were antagonized by alpha- and beta-blockade or a combination of both. Sympathomimetic amines caused contraction and relaxation on the common bile duct of rabbits. Transmural stimulation to guinea-pig gallbladder and rabbit common bile duct is mediated by cholinergic and adrenergic nerves, alpha-inhibitory adrenoceptor would thus be involved in the postanglionic cholinergic nerve endings in the gallbladder of guinea-pig. No difference was observed in mechanical responses to transmural stimulation in either the isolated sphincter of oddi or the duodenum of rabbits. It is concluded that the guinea-pig biliary system is functionally independent of the gastro-intestinal system and that the rabbit sphincter of oddi is functionally similar to the duodenal wall.", 
    "4": "We studied the biochemical and pharmacologic modes of action of piribedil and apomorphine in the rat. Although both drugs have many points in common, they are also different in many of their manifestations. Apomorphine causes high-intensity, short-duration stereotyped behavior; it is distributed within the brain in uneven fashion, the striatum being the area of lowest concentration as measured by fluorometry. Direct stereotactic injection within the dopaminergic mesolimbic system, and particularly the tuberculum olfactorium, produced constant intense responses. All effects of apomorphine can be blocked by pimozide, but propanolol, a beta blocker, only reduces aggression and ferocity, leaving stereotyped behaviors intact. Finally, L-5-HTP tends to reduce aggression, ferocity, and to a lesser extent stereotypy; MIF or piribedil, as well as reserpine, potentiates the stereotyped behaviors induced by apomorphine, whereas L-DOPA usually decreases them. Piribedil, on the other hand, causes low-intensity, long-duration stereotyped behavior. It is distributed within the brain almost uniformly. Most effects of piribedil can be blocked by pimozide, but propanolol blocks only aggression and ferocity, leaving stereotyped behaviors intact. On the other hand, clonidine, an alpha-receptor agonist, blocks stereotyped behaviors induced by piribedil but markedly increases aggression, ferocity, and motor activity. L-5-HTP and L-DOPA have little effect on piribedil-induced manifestations. Reserpine decreases piribedil stereotypy. The main metabolite of piribedil, S 584, had no clear-cut pharmacologic action in our hands at the dosage used. It is concluded that both apomorphine and piribedil produce stereotyped behavior by modifying the physiologic balance between mesolimbic and nigrostriatal dopaminergic systems. The other actions of apomorphine and piribedil upon aggression, ferocity, and motor activity are not always in parallel and depend probably on the fact that piribedil is less specific, affecting also noradrenergic, serotonergic, histaminergic, and/or cholinergic circuits. The usefulness of piribedil against some forms of human tremor and its low-intensity antiakinetic action probably result from this pattern of pharmacologic activity.", 
    "5": "1. Isolated rabbit hearts were perfused with a modified Tyrode solution containing noradrenaline in concentrations increasing stepwise from 5.9 nM to 5.9 muM at 5 min intervals. This dose regime was applied twice before and once 20 min after starting perfusion with one of 9 tricyclic drugs. Ventricular rate and right atrial and ventricular tensions were recorded using the transverse method. 2. Infusions of noradrenaline evoked ventricular arrhythmias in hearts perfused with amitriptyline 4.8 muM, chlorpromazine 5.0 muM, desipramine 5.0 muM, dibenzepine 34.7 muM, doxepin 4.7 muM, imipramine 4.7 muM, noxiptiline 9.1 muM and opipramole 9.2 muM. The incidence of arrhythmias increased with the concentration of noradrenaline applied and the dose of tricyclic drug administered. Whenever arrhythmias had started they continued as long as noradrenaline was infused. Noradrenaline failed to produce arrhythmias in hearts not exposed to drugs and after iprindole 4.7 muM or cocaine 2.9-18 muM. 3. Propranolol 0.1 muM inhibited the incidence of arrhythmias after doxepin 4.7 muM plus noradrenaline 5.9-190 nM. 4. Neuronal uptake of exogenous noradrenaline in the rabbit heart was inhibited by the tricyclic drugs in the following order of declining p potency: doxepin, noxiptiline, amitriptyline, desipramine, chlorpromazine, imipramine, dibenzepine, opipramole and iprindole. 5. Among tricyclic drugs the potency to inhibit amine uptake is related to the incidence of arrhythmias evoked by a submaximal concentration of noradrenaline. It appears, however, that these two parameters are not causally linked. 6. The isolated rabbit heart perfused with noradrenaline might be used as a model for testing the arrhythmogenic actions of tricyclic drugs and the treatment of such arrhythmias.", 
    "6": "Intraventricular administration of aconitine nitrate (10 mug) consistently produced hypertension and tachycardia. Peripheral vaso-constriction due to increase in central vasomomotor tone mainly responsible for hypertension whereas stimulation of central beta-receptors with sympathoadr renal discharge responsible for tachycardia.", 
    "7": "Aconitine, 10 mug, administered intraventricularly in cats produced cardiae arrhythmias. Intraventricular administration of phenoxybenzamine, propranolol and practolol abolishes the centrally induced cardiac arrhythmias. Intraventricular reserpinization also abolished these cardiac arrhythmias whereas intraventricular administration of 6-hydroxydopamine and tetrabenazine had no effect. Brain stem noradrenaline probably plays a role in these centrally induced cardiac arrhythmias by aconitine.", 
    "8": "If the antiarrhythmic agents mentioned above are administered in combinations of their respective isoeffective doses, following the \"principle of isoeffectivity\", a potentiation of their effects takes place. The authors describe methods for the preparation of combined solutions and for the toxicity testing of combined antiarrhythmic agents. When combinations are administered, the toxicity does not increase but on the contrary tends to decrease. If antiarrhythmic agents are combined without regard to the principle of isoeffectivity, the antiarrhythmic effect of the combination deteriorates, and adverse effects may be produced. The basic prerequisite of the potentiation of antiarrhythmic effects in combinations is, in the authors' opinion, the use of drugs differing in both chemical structures and mechanisms of antiarrhythmic actions.", 
    "9": "Development of improved techniques for assessing infarct size in intact experimental animals and in patients has made it possible to evaluate the effectiveness of selected interventions more objectively. It is becoming increasingly apparent that infarct size is an important determinant of prognosis. Experimentally, infarct size can be modified favorably under specified conditions by interventions designed to reduce myocardial oxygen requirements or increase myocardial energy supply during the early evolution of infarction. Preliminary clinical applications of these concepts have been encouraging. The time seems to be right for carefully controlled clinical investigations to determine whether techniques designed to protect ischemic myocardium will be effective in improving survival and reducing morbidity from acute myocardial infarction. On the basis of available evidence, it seems clear that appropriate management of patients with this disorder should include careful attention to the impact of any therapeutic modality on the heart itself. It does not suffice to treat patients with beta-adrenergic agonists simply because they may elevate systemic arterial blood pressure. Hemodynamics can not be the sole criteria in guiding the physician charged with the responsibility for patient management. Rather, he must consider the potential effects of any contemplated therapeutic modality on myocardial viability as well. The ultimate place if interventions designed to protect ischemic myocardium in the therapeutic armamentarium remains to be determined. However, judicious therapy should be designed to minimize myocardial oxygen requirements and maximize myocardial energy supply as well as to prevent criti l impairment of peripheral perfusion.", 
    "10": "The effect of bradykinin on gastric and colonic motility was studied in anaesthetized cats with volume recording devices and compared with the effects of vagal nerve stimulation. When administered intrarterially bradykinin caused a profound and prolonged gastric relaxation. Stimultaneously there was a marked and likewise prolonged colonic contraction. The gastric relaxation closely mimicked the atropine resistant relaxation elicited by vagal nerve stimulation. These effects could not be blocked by antiadrenergic drugs and it is suggested that bradykinin and the unknown transmittor substance(s) released on vagal stimulation act in a similar way on the gastric smooth muscles and that a kinin mechanism may be involved in the vagal response. As regards the colonic motor response it was shown that bradykinin does not reproduce the vagal motility effects on colon smooth muscle but mimicks closely the atropine resistant expulsive contraction elicited by activation of the pelvic nerves.", 
    "11": "The administration of egg albumin to rabbits sensitized to this antigen caused marked increases in the arterial concentration of lactate, glucose and glycerol, but no change in the arterial FFA level. Antigen administration had no effect in non-sensitized rabbits. Phentolamine (3 mg/kg) or propranolol (1 mg/kg) did not significantly alter the responses to egg albumin in sensitized rabbits. Noradrenaline or sympathetic nerve stimulation decreased blood flow but caused no significant change in lipolysis in rabbit epigastric adipose tissue in situ. It is therefore questionable if catecholamines are the major cause of the observed metabolic consequences of the anaphylactic reaction in the rabbit. These metabolic events, i.e. increased lactate levels, lipolysis, and reesterification of fatty acids, are similar to those reported during hemorrhagic or endotoxin shock in dogs, in spite of specied-differences and the difference in the genesis of the shock.", 
    "12": "The effects of moderate arterial hyperosmolality (+20 mOsm/kg H2O), produced by short term intravenous hypertonic infusion, on vascular resistance in skin, skeletal muscle, intestine, and kidney were analyzed in the anesthetized cat. Vascular resistance decreased in all four regions in response to the hypertonicity both before and after regional sympathectomy and the effects were not significantly altered by beta-adreno-ceptor blockade. Arterial blood pressure rose during the hypertonic infusion despite the decreased vascular resistance and an unchanged heart rate, indicating an increased stroke volume and cardiac output. Similar increases of arterial osmolality are known to occur in heavy exercise and in hemorrhage. The present results may therefore suggest that blood borne hyperosmolality is a factor which can contribute to the overall cardiovascular adjustments in these situations.", 
    "13": "The effects of injections of monoamines, alone and in combination with different antagonists, bilaterally into the nucleus accumbens of nialamide-pretreated rats were investigated. Dopamine was found to produce a stronger stimulation of locomotor activity than noradrenaline, whereas serotonin was effective only in a small number of animals, in which the duration of locomotor stimulation was shorter than after dopamine or noradrenaline. The effects of both dopamine and noradrenaline were completely antagonized by administration of a small dose of the dopamine antagonist haloperidol, administered bilaterally 15 min after the catecholamines. The alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine did not inhibit the effect of noradrenaline but, on the contrary potentiated and considerably prolonged the duration of locomotor stimulation. Aslo, the effect of dopamine was potentiated and prolonged by phentolamine. Bilateral injection of phentolamine alone had no influence upon locomotor activity. The effect of noradrenaline was not clearly inhibited nor potentiated by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol. It is suggested that the stimulation of locomotor activity induced by injection of noradrenaline into the uncleus accumbens of nialamide-pretreated rats is brought about via dopaminergic mechanisms.", 
    "14": "In anesthetized rats the glucose release of the kidneys was estimated from the glucose concentrations in the arterial and renal venous plasma, urinary glucose excretion and the total renal plasma flow. Net renal glucose release was found in control experiments. The glucose release of the kidneys decreased with rising arterial plasma glucose values. Epinephrine (220 mug/kg s.c.) and isoprenaline (10 mu/kg s.c.) enhanced arterial plasma glucose levels and increased mean renal glucose production significantly. The enhanced arterial plasma glucose levels and increased mean renal glucose production significantly. The enhanced glucose release after isoprenaline could be abolished by propranolol (1 mg/kg s.c.). The glycogen content of the kidney was found to be too small to account for the observed renal glucose release by glycogenolysis. Therefore, these in vivo data indicate enhanced renal gluconeogenesis after adrenergic stimulation. This effect is thought to be mediated by the beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "15": "Dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) the enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of noradrenaline from dopamine, was assayed in the blood plasma of 19 cases with hypertension before and during beta-receptor blockade. Propranolol was given to 15 patients and I.C.I. 66,082 (a new cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocker without intrinsic sympathomimetic properties) to 4 patients. - There was no effect by the drugs on the level of plasma DBH activity in spite of a good reduction of the blood pressure.", 
    "16": "Effects of various drugs, such as Isuprel, Neo-synephrine, aminophylline and quinidine, have been evaluated and compared in both control and TAH calves. In the control calves, the cardiac effects of these drugs were overlapped by vascular effects. But in the TAH calves, pure vascular effects have been clearly shown. 1) The peripheral effects of Dibenzyline and Inderal were evaluated in the TAH calves. 2) From these results, it has been concluded that the TAH animal is a useful model for the study of the peripheral vascular response to drugs in awake, unanesthetized subjects.",

    "18": "1. Angiotensin I, II and hog renin, infused into the lateral cerebral ventricles (I.C.V.) of water replete cats, each induced water drinking behaviour. 2. Intravenous infusion of high doses of angiotensin I or II also elicited a drinking response. The dipsogenic effect of I.V. renin was not marked. 3. Drinking in response to I.C.V. angiotensin II was abolished after autonomic ganglion blockade with I.V. hexamethonium or pempidine and was significantly reduced after I.V. atropine methonitrate. 4. The dipsogenic response to I.C.V. angiotensin II was unaffected by either peripheral adrenergic neurone blockade with I.V. bethanidine, alpha-adrenoceptor blockade with phentolamine or beta-adrenoceptor blockade with sotalol. 5. Atropine, atropine methonitrate, hexamethonium and pempidine given I.C.V did not inhibit the diposgenic response to I.C.V. angiotensin II. 6. Bethanidine I.C.V. produced a dose related reduction in the dipsogenic response to I.C.V. angiotensin II. 7. The alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agents tolazoline and phenoxybenzamine given I.C.V did not affect angiotensin induced drinking but the response was regularly inhibited by phentolamine I.C.V. 8. The beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents propranolol and practolol given I.C.V. each inhibited angiotensin induced drinking. The L-isomer of propranolol was a more effective blocker than the D-isomer. 9. Isoprenaline given I.C.V induced drinking in ten of sixteen cats. Subcutaneous administration of isoprenaline also elicited drinking but the onset of the response was delayed and the amount consumed slightly less than after I.C.V infusion.", 
    "19": "The effects of norepinephrine in interaction with adrenergic blocking compounds were studied on membrane adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activities of human lymphocytes and lymphoblasts. Sodium-potassium ion exchange pump activity was assayed by 86-Rb uptake and ATPase activity of membrane fractions was assayed by ADP and inorganic phosphate generation. The results of these studies indicate that norepinephrine acts by an alpha adrenergic mechanism to enhance membrane sodium-potassium ion exchange pump activity and ATPase activity. The pharmacologic and ionic dissection of the adrenergic sensitivity of ATPase activity indicates that this alpha adrenergic mechanism is related to membrane ATPase activities in addition to that associated with the ion exchange pump. Analysis of fractions obtained by sucrose gradients indicates that the action of norepinephrine is localized in the plasma membrane. Beta adrenergic stimulation was observed to inhibit ATPase activity. The complexity of adrenergic effects on membrane ATPase suggests interactions of hormone modulation of membrane nucleotide cyclases and transport-related ATPase enzymes.", 
    "20": "Using the D\u00fcrrer electrode needle to record the intramural electrogram and a standard peripheral electrocardiogram (ECG) lead as reference, the authors studied the action of 9 different drugs in the conduction system of dogs. The authors concluded that diphenylhydantoin and lignocaine would be useful in dysrhythmias related to increased excitability and perhaps increased automatism. Ajmaline and quinidine may be some of some interest in dysrhythmias due to conduction disturbances; and, finally, ajmaline, diphenylhydantoin, di-isopyramide and quinidine may be useful in dysrhythmias due to focal re-entry.", 
    "21": "Electrical stimulation of the heart, using the single test stimulus method, gives the opportunity to study the mechanisms of tachycardias and the effect of drugs on these mechanisms directly in the heart of the patient with the WPW syndrome. Using these methods the effect of digitalis, procainamide, quinidine, ajmaline, lidocaine, propranolol and verapamil has been studied. Understanding of the mechanisms responsible for initiation and maintenance of tachycardias and the way in which they can be influenced by drugs should be of help in the treatment of the symptomatic patient with the WPW syndrome.", 
    "22": "The effects of the selective beta-2-receptor stimulator terbutaline on the activity of gravid, human myometrium were investigated in vitro and in vivo, before and after administration of different beta-receptor blockers. Terbutaline, 0.2-1.0 mu-g/ml, inhibited the spontaneous contractile activity of isolated strips of myometrium. This effect was unaffected by the selective beta-a-receptor blockers practolol, 1 mu-g/ml, and H 93/26, 1 mu-g/ml. However, the non-selective blocker propranolol, 0.1 mu-g/ml, completely inhibited the terbutaline effects. The in vitro effects of terbutaline could be correlated with findings in vivo. Intra-uterine pressure was recorded in 4 pregnant women at term. Infusion of terbutaline, 10-15 mu-g/min, for 20-40 min, effectively inhibited both spontaneous and oxytocin-stimulated uterine activity. There was a moderate increase in maternal heart rate, but no consistent effect on maternal blood pressure. Fetal heart rate was little affected. The uterine effects of terbuline were not influenced by practolol, 5-20 mg i.v., but completely inhibited by propranolol, 1-2 mg i.v. The results suggest that terbutaline inhibits uterine motility by effects on uterine beta-2-receptors and that it can be given in clinically effective doses without adverse circulatory effects on mother or fetus.", 
    "23": "It has previously been shown that stimulation of an adrenergic system in the central nervous system (CNS) will depress the increase in plasma corticosterone (B) following surgical stress. Two aspects of hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal function, namely adrenal compensatory hypertrophy (ACH) and plasma B response to ether stress, were studied to determine the influence of this adrenergic component. Phenoxybenzamine, an gamma-adrenergic blocking agent, chronically implanted into the lateral ventricle produced an augmented response to ether stress, whereas norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA), and propranolol did not. The augmented response was similar to that observed following the daily administration of reserpine (0.25 mg/kg, s.c.). The response to this dose of reserpine was blocked by the simultaneous administration of a low dose of dexamethasone (14 mu-g/kg, s.c.). Augmentation of the stress response was not produced by larger doses of reserpine but did occur with lower doses. The effects of the treatments on ACH were not consistent with those observed on the stress response, suggesting that different mechanisms are involved. The data support the concept of an gamma-adrenergic component in the CNS which serves to inhibit the plasma B stress response.", 
    "24": "The frog erythrocyte adenylate cyclase system was inhibited by addition of acidic phospholipids. The ratio of activity produced by isoproterenol to that produced by norepinephrine was not significantly changed by addition of various phospholipids and lipid extracts. Addition of isoproterenol plus Gpp(NH)p to the frog erythrocyte membranes produced an adenylate cyclase activity much higher than the sum of activities produced by these reagents when tested separately. The same high rate was still obtained after preincubation of the enzyme with isoproterenol plus Gpp(NH)p followed by exhaustive washing of the preparation. ATP and Mg++ were not required for the preincubation. When isoproterenol alone was preincubated with the enzyme, a persistent active state was not produced; dilution or washing readily reduced the activity to the low basal level. Formation of the persistent active state by preincubation with Gpp(NH)p plus isoproterenol was prevented by the beta-receptor blocking agent propranolol which reduced the activity to that obtained by Gpp(NH)p alone. However, propranolol completely failed to inhibit the activity if added after the enzyme had been preincubated with the catecholamine plus the nucleotide. Propranolol readily blocked the activity when added to enzyme which had been preincubated with isoproterenol alone. The findings lead to the tentative conclusion that the hormone acts by facilitating the action of Gpp(NH)p and that, having done so, the hormone perhaps plays no further role. It is further suggested that in the case of the natural nucleotide GTP, the hormone is required continuously for activation in order to maintain GTP at a regulatory site.", 
    "25": "The effect of amphetamine and l-dopa was compared in 22-hr food- and water-deprived rats. Amphetamine produced marked anorexia, and l-dopa significantly reduced food intake at 200 mg/kg. Following pretreatment with RO 4-4602, a decarboxylase inhibitor, 100 mg/kg of l-dopa, a dose that did not significantly affect eating, produced marked anorexia. The anorectic effect of both amphetamine and l-dopa was antagonized by propranolol, a beta adrenergic antagonist. Phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, potentiated the anorectic effect of amphetamine and l-dopa. Haloperidol (0.1 mg/kg), a dopamine antagonist, failed to prevent the anorexia due to amphetamine but accentuated that due to l-dopa. Methysergide, a serotonin antagonist, also failed to prevent the anorexigenic effect of amphetamine. Finally, the administration of l-dopa with or without peripheral decarboxylase inhibition resulted in more than twice the increase in hypothalamic dopamine levels without significant changes in 5-HT or norepinephrine levels. The data show that the anorexigenic effect of amphetamine and l-dopa are similar and indicate a functional role for both norepinephrine and dopamine neurons in feeding behaviour in the rat.", 
    "26": "1. The influence of practolol (a proposed beta1-adrenoreceptor antagonist) upon the pressure-flow relationships in the peripheral circulation was studied in eight anaesthetized dogs during right heart by-pass procedures. 2. Practool (1 mg/kg) produced a significant increase in the resistance to venous return which resulted in a significant fall in venous return. 3. There was no significant change in arterial resistance. 4. This study suggests that practolol should not be classified as an exclusive cardioselective beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist.", 
    "27": "I.v. administration of McN-2378 appeared to preferentially increase cerebral blood flow as opposed to systemic (femoral) blood flow in two strains of monkeys. This cerebral vasodilation was not affected by theta-adrenergic blockade. In the anesthetized dog, the compound transiently lowered systemic arterial pressure with an associated transient decrease in femoral vascular resistance and increased heart rate. Cardiac output in the anesthetized dog was also transiently elevated. Although the compound contains a nitrile group, there is no evidence to suggest that cyanide release is mediating the cerebral vasodilation.", 
    "28": "Forearm blood flow was measured by venous occlusion plethysmography in normotensive subjects of various ages and in patients with treated or untreated hypertension. Brief exposure of one forearm to pressures below atmospheric was used to study the transient local changes in arterial inflow which occurred with changes in transmural pressure induced in this way. The increase in initial arterial inflow with such an exposure to suction in a group of young normotensive women was only slightly reduced in two groups of older women. However, a group of subjects with untreated hypertension showed a significantly smaller initial inflow during the suction. There was some indication that adequate treatment of high blood pressure might reverse this effect.", 
    "29": "Injection of a single bolus of acetylcholine into the sinus node artery of the isolated atrium of the dog produces a triphasic response similar to that previously observed after a single stimulus to the vagus nerves. There is an initial, brief but pronounced, cardiac deceleration followed by a brief, slight acceleration, which is then followed by a more prolonged deceleration which is of lesser magnitude than the initial deceleration. The most likely cause of the intermediate phase of cardiac acceleration is a direct effect of acetylcholine on the pacemaker cells, as it is also with the primary and tertiary phases of cardiac deceleration.", 
    "30": "Feeding responses of sheep and steers were compared following intraventricular injection of alpha-adrenergic agonists and antagonists in 2-hr. tests. In sheep, injection of the alpha-agonist 1-norepinephrine (1-NE) (140-1,120 nmoles) increased feed intakes 288% and 388% compared with intakes following synthetic cerebrospinal fluid. This response was blocked by the alpha-antagonist phenoxybenzamine, whereas the antagonist alone decreased feed intake. The beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol did not modify the 1-NE response. A purer but weaker alpha-agonist, 1-phenylephrine, also resulted in increased feed intake that was blocked by phenoxybenzamine. In contrast to the feeding responses of sheep, 1-NE caused hypophagia in steers, reducing intakes as much as 58% in 2-hr. tests over doses ranging 42-27,800 nmoles. Phenoxybenzamine blocked the 1-NE-induced hypophagia in steers; when injected alone, it increased feed intakes 181% of control values. Changes in feeding following 1-NE injections are probably not attributable to changes in temperature, fat mobilization, or stupor. The data support the hypothesis of an alpha-adrenergic-coded system for feeding in sheep and for satiety in steers.", 
    "31": "On the isolated rabbit papillary muscle experiments were carried out to determine whether the positive inotropic effects mediated by alpha- and by beta- adrenoceptors are brought about by different mechanisms or not.--For this reason the influence of temperature and the effect of the calcium antagonist D600 on the responses to phenylephrine and to isoprenaline were compared. 1. The maximal inotropic effects of phenylephrine, isoprenaline and calcium were not affected by raising the temperature of the organ bath from 37 degrees to 42 degrees C, wheras the basal developed tension of the muscle was significantly decreased. 2. The dose-response curve for phenylephrine was markedly shifted to the right by raising the temperature (pD2=0.89), while that for isoprenaline was also shifted to the right, but to a lesser extent (pD2=0.23). 3. In the presence of 1.5 times 10-8 M pindolol the shift of the dose-response curve for phenylephrine induced by elevation of temperature was more prominent (pD2=1,91), whereas phentolamine (3 times 10-6 M) inhibited the temperature-induced shift. 4. The positive inotropic effect of phenylephrine--mediated by alpha-adrenoceptors under blockade of beta-adrenoceptors by 1.5 times 10-8 M pindolol--was markedly depressed by D600 (10-7 and 3 times 10-7 M): the dose-response curve was shifted to the right ant the maximal response was depressed. On the other hand, the positive inotropic effect of isoprenaline--mediated by beta-adrenoceptors--was affected to a lesser extent by D600 and the maximal response was not changed. It indicates that the stimulation of alpha- adrenoceptors in the rabbit papillary muscle induces a positive inotropic response through a biochemical process different from that caused via beta- adrenoceptors, i. e., stimulation of alpha- adrenoceptors may increase the intracellular calcium level mainly by changing the transmembrane calcium flux.",

Left ventricular ejection period is only slightly shortened by the influence of both ingested substances. Ethanol as well as Inderal prolong the interval of isovolumic relaxation, but at the some time they increase the percentual relation of the left ventricular presystolic filling \"a\" wave to the ejection relaxation wave V-O.

    "33": "The effect of propranolol on the hypermetabolism of thyrotoxicosis was investigated in eight subjects with diffuse toxic goiter. After equilibration on a constant nitrogen, calcium, and hydroxproline intake, nitrogen balance was determined before and during propranolol therapy prior to subtotal thyroidectomy and compared to similar data obtained in seven of the patients following surgically induced euthyroidism. Propranolol administration was associated with clinical amelioration and a rapid, statistically significant, improvement in nitrogen retention. A slight additional improvement in retention was noted in the postoperative euthyroid state. Oxygen consumption, measured serially in four patients, was not significantly changed by propranolol. Urinary loss of calcium, phosphorus, and hydroxyproline was unaffected by propranolol, but excretion of these substances was sharply reduced in the subjects restudied postoperatively. These data offer a evidence of a previously unreported nitrogen sparing effect of oral propranolol during its short-term administration in thyrotoxic man.", 
    "34": "The successful simultaneous closure of a persistent ductus arteriosus and mitral valve replacement in a 65-year-old woman with pulmonary hypertension is reported. The approach through a left thoracotomy gave good exposure and momentary cessation of cardiopulmonary bypass made ligation of the calcified ductus possible. Although this seems to be a rare association, when mitral valve disease is significant the simultaneous closure of the duct and mitral valve surgery is the treatment of choice.",

Atrial flutter rates increased during exercise testing in four patients. Improved A-V conduction with consequent higher ventricular rates occurred during exercise in thirteen subjects. One patient, with 4:1 conduction at rest, continued with 4:1 block throughout exercise testing, was believed to be over-digitalized. During the recovery period after exercise, ten patients transiently developed periods of Wenckebach A-V block. Walking exercise induced 1:1 conduction in six patients and was promoted by the following circumstances: 1) atrial rates of 250/min or less; 2) inadequate dosage of digitalis; and 3) the administration of quinidine. For the patient with chronic atrial flutter, treadmill testing provides a simple method for demonstrating the range of changes of A-V conduction and for deriving implications for appropriate drug therapy.", 
    "36": "Graded vagal stimulation was applied to the distal vago-sympathetic trunk in anesthetized dogs. The effects of vagal stimulation were expressed as cardiac delay time, which is specifically measured as the R-R interval of the asystolic period or bradycardial beat, minus the control R-R interval. Graded vagal effects were best obtained by stimulation with varying pulse duration at fixed voltage and frequency. As pulse duration was increased, progressive bradycardia and brief cardiac arrest occurred. With further increase in pulse duration, cardiac delay time increased markedly and remained essentially unchanged over a wide range of still greater pulse durations. ECG's recorded stimultaneously showed initial sinus bradycardia, atrial pacemakers and A-V junctional beats during brief cardiac delays. The initial escape beat following prolonged cardiac delay was always A-V junctional or ventricular ectopic in origin. It is concluded that the initial escape beat following prolonged cardiac delay arises from latent ventricular pacemakers not subject to vagal influence.", 
    "37": "In order to study the role of the sympathetic nerves in the regulation of glucagon and insulin secretion, the distal stump of the left splanchnic nerve was electrically stimulated at the diaphragmatic level in the anesthetized dog under bilateral ligation of the adrenal veins. During stimulation, plasma glucose concentration rose rapidly, and pancreatic vein plasma concentration of glucagon increased along with pancreatic vein blood flow, indicating a greater output of glucagon. Insulin output in pancreatic vein plasma was slowly elevated despite continued stimulation. Pretreatment with propranolol resulted in a decline of the basal output of both glucagon and insulin and in their marked initial fall at the onset of the stimulus. However, glucagon output still showed a vigorous increase during neural stimulation whereas insulin output remained totally suppressed, but showed a rebound rise after cessation of stimulation. Pretreatment with phentolamine evoked an enhancement in both basal output of insulin and its response to splanchnic stimulation, but did not exert any marked effect on glucagon output. Pretreatment with atropine inhibited the basal output of glucagon and insulin, but the response of insulin output to splanchnic stimulation was not suppressed, thus excluding the possibility that activation of aberrant parasympathetic nerve fibers located in the splanchnic nerve would be responsible for the delayed increase in insulin release. The present results indicate that glucagon secretion may be regulated by different receptor mechanisms from those involved in insulin release following sympathetic activation.", 
    "38": "Isometric performance at 29degreesC was measured in left ventricular trabeculae carneae from young adult (6-mo) and aged (25-mo) rats (n equals 18 in each group). Active tension and maximal rate of tension development did not differ with age, but contraction duration was 255plus or minus6 ms in the young adult and 283plus or minus6 ms in the aged group (P less than0.001). Although catecholamine content per gram heart weight was less in the aged myocardium, additional experiments showed that neither 1 times 10-6 M propranolol nor pretreatment with 6-hydroxydopamine eliminated the age difference in contraction duration. To determine if this age difference resulted from a prolonged active state, electromechanical dissociation and the overshoot of contraction duration during recovery from hypoxia were measured. During paired stimulation greater mechanical refractoriness was found in aged muscles (P less than0.01), but intracellular action potential recordings showed no age difference in the electrical refractory period. On recovery from hypoxia, contraction duration overshoot was 117plus or minus 4percent of control in the young and 138plus or minus 4percent of control in the aged muscles (P less than0.01). The greater electromechanical dissociation and greater overshoot in contraction duration following hypoxia in aged myocardium suggests that prolonged contraction duration in aged myocardium results from a prolonged active state rather than changes in passive properties or myocardial catecholamine content.", 
    "39": "The classic view that the resting bradycardia of exercise training is due to an increase in the tonic discharge of the vagi is no longer tenable; If it were true, full doses of atropine would accelerate the heart to a greater extent in the athletic animal. All investigators agree that the reverse is the case. Some workers report a decrease in cardiac sympathetic influence after training. This would cause a preponderance of vagal influence which may decrease to a lesser extent than the sympathetics or may not change at all. Several studies have demonstrated that training causes a distinct slowing of the intrinsic rate of the pacemaker. It is concluded that two factors operate to lower the resting heart rate after athletic training: 1) slowing of the intrinsic rate of the pacemaker, 2) Increase in cholinergic predominance on the pacemaker frequency as a result of a decrease in adrenergic influence. Vagal influence per se seems either to remain the same or to decrease slightly in the athlete compared to the nonathelete. It appears that slowing of the intrinsic rate plays a more important role, a factor that has been hitherto overlooked. The mechanisms underlying these changes remain obscure.", 
    "40": "The effect of phentolamine and/or propranolol (alpha- and beta-receptor blocking compounds respectively) on the survival of skin flaps was studied in rats. Phentolamine and/or propranolol were injected intraperitoneally every 12 hours, starting one day before the flap operation, and continued for 5 consecutive days. One week after the operation the survival of the flaps was judged. Systemic treatment with either compound alone or in combination resulted in statistically significant increased survival of the flaps. The results demonstrate that both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors influence the survival of skin flaps in rats.", 
    "41": "The effect of intracerebral administraton of antagonists of dopamine and noradrenaline upon the locomotor stimulation induced by intraperitoneal injection of d-amphetamine sulfate in rats was investigated. Inj ection of low doses of the dopamine antagonist haloperidol (2.5 mug and 5 mug) bilaterally into the nucleus accumbens antagonized the locomotor stimulation following d-amphetamine. No significant inhibition was observed following administration of the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine or thhe beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol into the nucleus accumbens. Injection of the dame doses of haloperidol into the caudate nucleus did not inhibit the d-amphetamine induced locomotor activity in contrast to the effects seen following injection into the nucleus accumbens. The results confirm the significance of dopaminergic mechanisms for the locomotor stimulant effect of d-amphetamine and indicate that the mesolimbic dopamine system plays an important role in this respect.", 
    "42": "Cardiac: Cardiac protein synthesis is influenced by the state of nutrition with reduction of cardiac size in starvation. Ethanol per se may not affect this synthesis directly, but the metabolite of ethanol, acetaldehyde, profoundly decreases normal protein synthesis in the heart in vitro. The interference with the synthetic process may play a role in the ultimate cardiomyopathies of malnutrition and alcoholism. Hepatic: In vivo albumin synthesis is sensitive to environment, oncotic pressure, normal balance, nutrition, as well as toxins and state of health. Thus, to study the acute effects of alcohol alone, it was necessary to employ the isolated perfused liver. Fasting reduced albumin synthesis 50%, with loss of RNA and a disaggregation of the endoplasmic membrane bound polysome. Tryptophan, arginine and ornithine added to the perfusate at a final concentration of 10 mM reversed these findings. Alcohol likewise reduced albumin synthesis; disaggregates the bound polysome without a marked loss of RNA. Ornithine, arginine and tryptophan are able to reverse this loss in albumin synthesizing capacity. The combination of fasting and alcohol, while not lowering albumin synthesis below that seen with either stress alone, prevents the recovery from either stress.", 
    "43": "The effect of renal denervation on the reactivity of the renin release mechanism to circulating norepinephrine was studied in six dogs with renal autografts. The renin release was determined simultaneously in the transplanted and the untouched kidney. Both kidneys showed an increased release of renin when norepinephrine was given. A slight reduction in renal blood flow and increase in arterial blood pressure was recorded. Propranolol blocked the release of renin induced by norepinephrine without affecting either the reduced blood flow thorugh the autograft or the elevated blood pressure. The denervation of the autotransplanted kidney was histochemically verified. The findings indicate that the renin release induced by circulating norepinephrine is independent of the intrarenal adrenergic nerves, and rather suggest that it is the result of an action of norepinephrine directly on the renin-producing juxtaglomerular cells. In this mechanism a beta-adrenergic receptor system appears to be involved.", 
    "44": "Twenty hypertensive patients were treated for 15 weeks with pindolol, a new anti-hypertensive agent. Blood pressure while resting and after standing was reduced in all patients whether previously treated with an antihypertensive agent or not. All patients completed the study and no side-effects were reported. Laboratory tests showed no abnormalities and pindolol was very well tolerated in all patients. The dose of other antihypertensive agents was reduced in 7 patients.", 
    "45": "Two doublebling placebo controlled experiments designed to elucidate the alleged narcotic blocking effect of propranolol wer performed. In the first experiment, propranolol 40 mg or 20 mg was given together with methadone during the acute withdrawal phase of opiate addiction. The second experiment assessed whether 10 mg of propranolol, given 2 hrs before 30 mg of morphine i.v., reduced the euphoric effects of the latter drug. In none of the experiments could narcotic blocking effects be detected. The group receiving 40 mg propranolol during detoxification exhibited the highest proportion of patients staying for the whole prescribed detoxification period.", 
    "46": "We have examined some of the factors involved in the control of food intake and integrated the data using methods of systems analysis from biomedical engineering. The central hypothesis is that energy stored in the body is a regulated variable. Alterations in the quantity of stored calories initiates changes designed to restore the store of calories to its original level. These responses are both short-term and long-term in nature. They involve integrating data on the quantities of protein, carbohydrate, and lipid stores in the body, probably through such feedback signals as amino acids, glucose, glycerol, and free fatty acids.", 
    "47": "Transplant renal artery stenosis occurred in 12 of 101 consecutive kidney transplants. Stenoses were all located in the renal artery distal to the anastomosis. Two separate forms of stenosis are recognized: angulation and segmental. All transplant patients with severe diastolic hypertension, refractory to medical management, and an audible abdominal bruit should undergo angiography. Surgical correction of the stenosis was accomplished in nine of 12 patients with cure of their hypertension.", 
    "48": "A 57 year old man developed recurrent tachycardia with QRS complexes of 0.13 second in duration at a rate of 140 beats per minute. Inverted P waves appeared to follow each QRS complex in the electrocardiographic leads II, III and aVF. The differentiation between ventricular tachycardia with1 : 1 V-A conduction and supraventricular tachycardia with aberrant ventricular conduction was difficult to make from the surface electrocardiogram. This differentiation is important for selection of appropriate therapy. The diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia with 1 : 1 V-A conduction was clearly established in this case on simultaneous recording of surface electrocardiogram, His bundle electrogram and high right atrial electrogram.", 
    "49": "Ischemic myocardial damage produced by temporary coronary artery occlusion of 60 min duration is diminished by beta-sympathicolytic acting TrasicorR (3 mg per kg) and osmotically cell-dehydrating Manitol (1 g per kg). Trasylol, a proteinases inhibiting substance, caused a favourable effect at very high doses (100 000 DIE per kg) only. The extent and irreversibility of myocardial ischemic damage was determined by experiments of 180 min duration by intravital fluorochromatisation with acrine orange, determination of hydrogen ion concentration at frozen section of heart muscle with pH-indicatorpaper and enzymehistochemical and histochemical methods.", 
    "50": "Of 123 patients with identical clinical criteria for preinfarction angina, 35 were treated medically and 88 surgically in a nonrandomized manner. There was no statistical difference between these two therapeutic groups in regard to age range, average age, sex distribution, number and distribution of prior myocardial infarction, and duration of chronic and acute anginal symptoms. With medical therapy, 32 sustained a myocardial infarction, and 14 (40 per cent) of these died within 1 month of hospital admission. Thirteen of 21 survivors or 37 per cent of the original group are asmptomatic on continuing medical therapy an average of 15 months after discharge. The surgical patients were studied by catherization and anigiography and underwent an early operation. Eight (9.4 per cent) demonstrated evidence of postoperative infarction, and 3 (3.4 per cent) died after the operation. Seventy-one (84 per cent) are completely asymptomatic and 6 are less symptomatic an average of 17 months after the operation. Actuarial analysis of the follow-up data reveals that the initial significant difference in survival between the two groups is maintained through the first 36 months. On the basis of this experience, we suggest that surgical intervention is the therapy of choice in patients with preinfarction angina.", 
    "51": "To test the validity of the hypothesis that irritation of the cervical sympathetic nerves is a cause of hypertonicity of the cervical soft supporting tissues, especially the deep nuchal muscles, and that this hypertonicity is a cause of traumatic vertigo of cervical origin, we examined 44 vertigo cases with whiplash injury by testing equilibrium function and EMG discharges from the neck before and after administration of drugs affecting the sympathetic receptors. The results obtained were as follows: 1. Administration of iso-proterenol (beta-receptor stimulant) caused a significant increase in the EMG's from the injured neck muscles, in parallel with increased impairment of the righting reflex. The blindfolded vertical writing test showed the appearance or intensification of ataxia or deviation in writing when this drug was given. In contrast, administration of propranolol (beta-receptor depressor) had the opposite effects on the EMG's, the righting reflex and blindfolded vertical writing. Furthermore, the resulting changes in the EMG's and equilibrium functions were parallel with alterations in subjects' complaints, i.e., increase or decrease in neck pain and vertigo. 2. Administration of drugs affecting the alpha receptors, such as noradrenaline (alpha-receptor stimulant) and phentolamine (alpha-receptor depressor) had no appreciable effect on the EMG's, equilibrium function or the subjects' complaints. These results show that in vertigo due to whiplash injury hypertonicity of the cervical erector muscles can be induced sympathetically, and that this hypertonicity is based on over-excitement of beta receptors in the injured neck muscles, which results in vertigo of cervical origin.", 
    "52": "The effect of catecholamines, represented by epinephrine and norepinephrine, on the activity of phospholipase A2 from bee venom was studied. It was shown that the hydrolysis of l-alpha-lecithin to lysolecithin and a fatty acid was considerably activated by preincubation of the lecithin with the biogenic amine. On the other hand, addition of nitroglycerin or propranolol to the enzyme solution considerably curtailed activation by the catecholamines. The pharmacological effect of the split products of l-alpha-lecithin, free fatty acids (FFA), and lysolecithin in the nascent state on the myocardial cell membrane might be more plausible than the commonly accepted theory that the FFA derive from lipolysis of remote fat deposits. Certain arrhythmias and ion imbalances might be caused by catecholamine activation of phospholipase A2. Of great pharmacological interest is the observation that this activation is inhibited by a beta-adrenergic blocking agent without the presence of cyclic adenosine monophosphate as a messenger. The reaction may serve as a model for the study of the pharmacological influence of nitroglycerin and propranolol on angina pectoris.", 
    "53": "The persistent high mortality from power failure resulting from myocardial infarction has stimulated an intensive search for methods of reducing infarct size, which has been shown to relate directly to the occurrence of power failure. By analyzing the time course of myocardial injury during ischemia, the reversibility of lesions with reperfusion, and the characteristics of reversibly injured tissues along the border zone of ischemic areas, concepts have been formulated regarding the possibility of salvaging marginally injured cells. Measures designed to diminish myocardial oxygen consumption, to increase blood flow or oxygen supply to ischemic areas, to increase substrate availability, or to change the degree of swelling and autolysis of injured cells have all been tested in experimental animals with some success. These methods are just beginning to be tested in the clinical setting, and, if successful, will no doubt usher in a new era in medical therapy for acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "54": "Ephedrine and propranolol shorten hexobarbital sleeping time and increase amidopyrine-N-demethylation activity. Pholedrine only scarcely acts on these parameters, dihydroergotamine is effective. In vitro, ephedrine, pholedrine, propranolol and above all dihydroergotamine proved to be inhibitors of amidopyrine-N-demethylation. Noradrenaline, cAMP and dibutyryli cAMP were ineffective. An influence of the sympathetic nervous system on biotransformation activity cannot be recognized.", 
    "55": "1. The inotropic effect of glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) was studied in guinea-pig papillary muscles and atrial strips by analysing the isometric contraction curve and the monophasic action potential (AP). 2. GTN, 7X10(-5)M in papillary muscles and at 1.4x10(-4)M in atrial strips. The maximum of the contractile force was reached in both preparations at 2x10(-4)M GTN. Positive inotropic effects were transitory (3--5 min) and were followed by marked negative inotropic effects. 3. In the presence of GTN, only 15 of 26 papillary muscles showed a positive inotropic response and there was a great variance in its intensity. Prior exposure of papillary muscles to a low GTN concentration, which by itself reduced force of contraction (like every single GTN application), was the prereqch by itself reduced force of contraction (like every single GTN application), was the prerequisite for the positive inotropic effect of a subsequent higher GTN concentration. In atrial strips the positive inotropic action was consistent and uniform. The maximum force of contraction in response to single applications of GTN was only about 50% of that in response to cumulatively increased GTN concentrations. 4. In the presence of 5x10(-4)M GTN, the tyramine concentration-effect curve was shifted to the left (by one log unit at the ED50 level). 5. Beta-Adrenoceptor blockade by(+/-)-propranolol (5x10(-6)M) or noradrenaline depletion by pretreatment of the animals with reserpine (5 mg/kg, 18--22 hrs prior to the experiment)prevented the positive inotropic effects of GTN in both preparations. Hence, the GTN-induced increase in contractile force is induced by the liberation of noradrenaline and an inhibitory effect on the monoamine oxidase (MAO) of sympathetic nerve endings might be involved. 6. In atrial preparations exposed to 5x10(-4)M GTN, time to peak force (tu) and relaxation time(t2) were shortened by 12% and 33%, respectively. Pretreatment of the animals with reserpine prevented the shortening og t1 and changed the shortening of t2 from 33% to 19%. 7. In papillary muscles, 5x10(-4) M GTN shortened t1 by 10%, while t2 was prolonged by 17% in noradrenaline-depleted, and by 36% in control muscles. Prolongation of t2 at 5x10(-4)M GTN was accompanied by an increase in the duration of the monophasic action patential (AP) in reserpine-pretreated as well as in control muscles by 12% and 26%, respectively (measured at 90% repolarization). The same GTN concentration slowed the maximum rate of depolarisiation by 32%. After 35 min the AP returned to approximately the control value. In the presence of 5x10(-4) M GTN, noradrenalin (1x10(-5)M) lengthened the AP by 38% in both, control muscles and noradrenaline-depleted preparations.", 
    "56": "TRH antagonized the GH releasing effect of pentobarbital anesthesia as well in normal as in thyroidectomized rats, and significantly increased plasma B levels in normal animals. This effect was also observed when TRH was administered into a lateral ventricle of the brain in ug amounts, and was suppressed by the beta-adrenergic receptor blocker propranolol. T3 also antagonized the pentobarbital-induced release of GH; however, plasma B levels were not modified, and the effect on plasma GH levels was not suppressed by propranolol.", 
    "57": "A preliminary report of the use of methylphenidate and oxprenolo in 24 apathetic physically disabled elderly people is presented. The study was not psychometrically or statistically assessed but was judged by the ability to be discharged from hospital, achieved in 50% of cases, of patients who probably would require to remain in long-stay geriatric beds for the rest of their lives.", 
    "58": "Stroke volume was determined from the pulmonary artery pressure record by application of the pulse contour method. Pulmonary artery pressure records were obtained in 17 patients using a high fidelity catheter-tip pressure transducer and simultaneous measurements of cardiac output were obtained from indicator dilution curves. The formula used was SV = KP sa (i plus T s/Td) where Psa is the planimetered area beneath the systolic portion of the pulmonary artery pressure curve. Ts and Td are the durations of systole and diastole, and K is a constant. Stroke volume was altered by isometric handgrip exercise and/or pharmacological agents in 15 patients. Serial measurementswere made in 2 patients in acute pulmonary oedema after myocardial infarction. Comparison of a wide range of values of stroke volume by the pulse contour method with those obtained from dye dilution curves showed a good correlation (r plus 0.97, P smaller than 0.001) regression line y = 1.01 times - 0.47. Measurement of stroke volume from the pulmonary artery pressure contour is a technique of potential value in serial haemodynamic monitoring."
