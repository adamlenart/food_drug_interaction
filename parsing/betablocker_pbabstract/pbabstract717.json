    "0": "The role of the alveolar macrophage in the uptake of 3H-propranolol by the isolated perfused rabbit lung and displacement of 3H-propranolol from this site has been investigated. Removal of 3H-propranolol (100 microgram) by the lung was characterized by a rapid distribution phase (t1/2 min) and a slower elimination phase with a clearance of 22.4 ml/min (t1/2 = 47 min). Addition of chlorpromazine (1 mg) at 30 min was followed by a twofold increase in perfusate concentrations of 3H-propranolol which was also associated with a reduction of 3H-propranolol in macrophages recovered from lungs at the end of perfusion experiments. Experiments using isolated alveolar macrophages demonstrated uptake of propranolol and marked inhibition by 100-fold higher concentrations of chlorpromazine and imipramine. In the intact dog, injection of imipramine (1 mg/kg) 60-70 min after bolus injection of 3H-propranolol (0.3 mg/kg) was associated with an immediate increase in blood levels of 3H-propranolol consistent with tissue redistribution. It is concluded that chlorpromazine and imipramine can displace propranolol from the lung,and that the alveolar macrophage is involved in this process.", 
    "1": "The usefulness of labetalol, a combined alpha and beta adrenoceptor antagonist, as a moderate hypotensive agent during combination anaesthesia in otological operations was studied. These preliminary results show that an intravenous dose of 2.0 mg/kg of body weight of labetalol causes a moderate decrease in blood pressure without a concomitant increase in heart rate or excessive hypotension. The half-life of the elimination phase of labetalol in plasma varied between 3.9 and 6.3 hours. A direct relationship between the intravenous dose of the drug (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg i.v.) and the increase in the AUC value was observed. No correlation was found between the decrease in either the systolic or diastolic blood pressure and the plasma level of labetalol. This new type of antagonist may possess advantages over other current hypotensive drugs, i.e lack of tachycardia and excessive hypotension.", 
    "2": "An open study was carried out in general practice on 678 hypertensive patients being treated with a beta-blocker but who still had resting diastolic blood pressures greater than 100 mmHg. Previous treatment was stopped and substituted with 1 or 2 tablets daily of a fixed combination product containing 160 mg oxprenolol hydrochloride in a sustained-release formulation plus 0.25 mg cyclopenthiazide per tablet. After 4-weeks' treatment on this regimen, blood pressure levels fell significantly, from 179/108 mmHg to 155/93 mmHg, without any increase in the reporting of unpleasant side-effects.", 
    "3": "In the treatment of refractory ventricular tachyarrhythmias antiarrhythmic drugs must sometimes be combined. An electrophysiologically appropriate combination is lignocaine and procainamide and, when needed, a beta-blocking agent. The hemodynamic effects of this treatment were studied in 6 patients in the acute phase of myocardial infarction. After a control period, an infusion of lignocaine was started and 1 h later procainamide/placebo was added in a double-blind system and finally also practolol/placebo. The drugs were given intravenously in ordinary doses. Hemodynamics were studied by bedside catheterization. During triple treatment heart rate and aortic pressures fell significantly whereas right atrial mean pressure increased compared to the control period. Stroke volume, cardiac output and pulmonary artery pressures were unchanged. Most of the changes appeared when practolol was added. Following the procainamide injection a transient fall in aortic pressures was noted. Lignocaine gave no hemodynamic effects. The number of ventricular premature beats was reduced in all patients and no patient had ventricular tachycardia during treatment. In these patients it was possible to combine lignocaine, procainamide and practolol in the acute phase of myocardial infarction. However, 3 patients developed hypotension, 1 sinus bradycardia and 1 had a short run of nodal tachycardia. It is concluded that this kind of combined treatment, because of its potential risks, should be restricted to critical clinical situations and then it ought to be hemodynamically controlled.", 
    "4": "The cardiovascular responses of 11 fetal lambs in utero to hypoxemia were evaluated before and after autonomic blockade. Hypoxemia was produced by lowering the maternally inspired oxygen or by progressive constriction of the umbilical cord by a cuff occluder. The animals were studied serially from 112 days' gestation to term. Fetal carotid arterial pO2 fell from 24 to 12 torr and was accompanied by a 35% decline in heart rate and 32% rise in blood pressure. Parasympathetic blockade with atropine produced a 114% increase in heart rate in the hypoxemic fetuses compared to 26% in the normoxemic controls. Pretreatment with atropine prevented the hypoxemia-induced bradycardia without altering the hypertensive response. alpha-Adrenergic blockade resulted in a 22% decrease in blood pressure in the hypoxemic group, three times greater than the controls. Pre-hypoxemia alpha-blockade prevented the hypertension without affecting the fall in fetal heart rate. It is concluded that fetal bradycardia in response to hypoxemia is due to a direct increase in parasympathetic activity rather than secondary to a hypertension-induced baroreflex. The alpha-mediated increase in systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure may be a compensatory mechanism to maintain placental blood flow despite the decline in combined ventricular output.", 
    "5": "The ADP-induced primary aggregation of human thrombocytes in vitro was inhibited by 1.5X10(-4) mol/l (+/-)bupranolol. At this concentration a strong desaggregation was obtained. The stereoisomers of bupranolol did not differ in effectiveness. Fractional addition was just as effective as a single dose. Not beta-receptor blocking but a membrane stabilizing effect is, therefore, the probable mechanism -- as in the case of propranolol. The less lipophilic metabolites hydroxybupranolol and carboxybupranolol were one-fourth and one-fifth as effective, respectively, as bupranolol. 5X10(-4) mol/l ASA (final concentration) showed the same inhibition of primary aggregation as did 1.5X10(-4) mol/l bupranolol but elicited less desaggregation. Doubling this dose of ASA resulted in a weaker inhibition than the subsequent addition of the aforementioned doses of bupranolol and ASA or vice versa, while this combination, in turn, inhibited less than a double dose of bupranolol. 1.5X10(-4) mol/l bupranolol inhibited the formation of pseudopodia by thrombocytes not stimulated with ADP. At 3X10(-4) mol/l this inhibition was drastic but no morphological damage was seen.", 
    "6": "The dose-response and time-action parameters for the prototype antiarrhythmic drugs lidocaine, propranolol and quinidine were established using a cardiac antiarrhythmic screening procedure in the rat. This simple screening procedure produces severe cardiac arrhythmias, primarily ventricular fibrillation, in young post-weaning rats which have been pretreated with a single intramuscular injection of theophylline (20 mg/kg) 15 to 45 min prior to their inhalation of chloroform vapors.", 
    "7": "The cardiovascular effects of intracisternally administered butoxamine, a beta 2-adrenoceptor blocking drug, were studied in both normotensive and acute hypertensive anaesthetized dogs. Acute hypertension was elicited by sino-aortic denervation (deafferentation). Intracisternal butoxamine (25-400 microgram/kg) failed to decrease blood pressure and reduce heart rate in the two groups of animals. These results show that the decrease in blood pressure elicited by central administration of dl-propranolol is probably not related to central beta 2-adrenoceptor blockade.", 
    "8": "The effects of d-, l-, dl-propranolol HCl and isoproterenol HCl on mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate and respiration were examined in 83 urethane-anesthetized, spontaneously hypertensive rats with carotid arterial and femoral venous catheters and stereotaxically positioned hypothalamic-thalamic cannulae. All three propranolol compounds produced a significant decrease in both blood pressure and respiratory rate when they were instilled into the posterior hypothalamic region and/or the pars magnocellularis region of the ventral medial thalamus. Isoproterenol produced an immediate (8 to 20 sec) depressor response following instillation in the hypothalamic-thalamic region but had no immediate effect when it was instilled in the reticular formation. Isoproterenol also did not produce any significant change in mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate or respiratory rate when it was administered centrally 15 min after instillation of either l- or dl-propranolol. The central antihypertensive activity of isoproterenol was not blocked following central administration of d-propranolol. The results suggest that cells located in the posterior hypothalamic-ventral medial thalamic region send projection fibers directly or indirectly to the cardiovascular and respiratory centers located in the brain stem. The results also suggest that the central antihypertensive activity of d-propranolol is probably due to local anesthetic activity while the activity of l-propranolol may be a reflection of central adrenoceptor blockade which may or may not include a local anesthetic component.", 
    "9": "Propranolol and verapamil are cardioactive drugs which may be useful during surgical procedures involving hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass. Previous in vivo studies have shown that the pharmacokinetics of propranolol are altered by hypothermia, and that clearance of the drug is significantly reduced by lowered body temperature. Since both propranolol and verapamil are eliminated largely by hepatic metabolic activity, the effect of hypothermia on the ability of the liver to metabolize both drugs was studied in vitro with rat hepatic microsome preparations. Known quantities of the drugs were added after preincubation of microsomes at 37 degrees C (normothermia) or 26 degrees C (hypothermia), and the amount of drug substrate remaining after an additional incubation period was measured. Hypothermic microsomes metabolized significantly less of each drug at all substrate concentrations studies (p less than 0.001). Double-reciprocal plots showed similar results for experiments with both propranolol and verapamil: the extrapolated Vmax was the same for both temperature conditions, but the Km values were significantly increased by hypothermia (p less than 0.001), indicating reduced affinity for drug substrate by the microsomal enzymes. These in vitro studies show that hepatic metabolic elimination of both propranolol and verapamil is decreased by hypothermia.", 
    "10": "Effects of noradrenaline (NA) on the membrane potential and the membrane resistance were studied in the guinea pig liver slices. The slices (2 x 2 x 6 mm) were prepared from the left lobe of the liver and superfused with Krebs solution. The mean membrane potential was -53.1 mV. Electrotonic potentials were recorded in an extrapolar region of liver cells when current pulses were applied between two extracellular electrodes. It was shown that a liver slice had cable-like properties. The space constant was estimated to be 0.38 mm and the time constant 5.2 msec. Administration of NA (10(-5) M) caused initial depolarization followed by hyperpolarization and an reduction in the size of the electrotonic potentials, suggesting a reduction in the membrane resistance. The response to NA depended on the membrane potential, i.e., the depolarizing component of the biphasic response was larger with higher membrane potential, while the hyperpolarizing component was larger with lower membrane potential. Both components of the response were blocked by an alpha-blocker, phentolamine (1.5 x 10(-5) M), but not by a beta-blocker, propranolol. The depolarizing component became smaller in a Na+-deficient and in a Cl-deficient solution, and was abolished in a solution lacking both Na+ and Cl-. These results may indicate that increases in Na+ and Cl- conductances may be responsible for the depolarizing component. The hyperpolarizing component was increased when the external K+ concentration was reduced, and the change in the peak potential with the external K+ concentration was larger in the presence of NA. In addition to these, the dependence of the response on the membrane potential and the reduction of the membrane resistance may suggest that the hyperpolarizing component of NA response is produced mainly by an increase in K+ conductance.", 
    "11": "The unique physical properties of the short-lived inert and freely diffusing isotope 81mkrypton allow a continuous observation to be made of regional myocardial perfusion. Eighteen dogs were anaesthetised and a reversible snare placed on the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). 81mKrypton was used to study regional myocardial perfusion, and myocardial metabolism was assessed using the epicardial ECG and release of creatine kinase activity (CK). Six dogs did not undergo LAD occlusion (\"sham operated\"); in six other dogs the LAD was occluded (controls), and another six dogs were given propranolol, 0.5 mg/kg, 20 min after LAD occlusion. All the parameters were measured before and for 5 h after LAD occlusion. When compared to controls, dogs treated with propranolol showed significant improvement (p less than 0.01) in regional myocardial perfusion; smaller loss of electrically active myocardium for any given degree of early ST-segment elevation; and a delay in the release of CK activity from a local coronary vein. These results suggest that propranolol exerts a beneficial effect following the development of acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "12": "The effect of the cardioselective beta-adrenoreceptor blocking compound, metoprolol, was compared with methyldopa in the long-term management of hypertension. Thirty patients given metoprolol and twenty-six given methyldopa were treated for 2 years. The maximum dose of metoprolol was 200 mg twice daily (average 308 mg) and of methyldopa 1,000 mg twice daily (average 1,120 mg). Blood pressure was similar at entry to the study (metoprolol 177/110 mmHg and methyldopa 181/111 mmHg). After 2 years of treatment the blood pressure levels were again similar (metoprolol 149/91 mmHg and methyldopa 148/91 mmHg). Erect pressures were lower in the methyldopa group, but there was no difference between supine and erect blood pressure levels in those on metoprolol. At an exercise load of 300 and 600 kpm the increase in systolic pressure was significantly less in the metoprolol group. The proportional increase in systolic and diastolic pressure in response to a standardized stress situation was reduced by treatment with metroprolol but not by methyldopa. Tolerance to therapy did not develop in either group. The main difference between metoprolol and methyldopa was in the incidence and severity of side effects. Four patients were withdrawn from the metoprolol group. Seventeen were withdrawn from the methyldopa mainly because of side effects including drowsiness, depression, skin rash, and impotence. Six patients on metoprolol and seventeen on methyldopa continued on therapy although side effects were present. It is concluded that metoprolol and methyldopa lower blood pressure to the same extent, but metoprolol is advantageous because of a lower incidence of side effects.", 
    "13": "It has been established that the protective or adrenaline heart injury enhancing effect of pharmacological agents manifests by regular shortening or prolongation of the time required for eosinophilia appearance as compared with the time it appears during administration of adrenalipe alone. This regularity lies at the basis of the quantitative evaluation of the efficacy of pharmacological agents in heart injury.", 
    "14": "Twenty-five patients undergoing microlaryngoscopy were anaesthetized with thiopentone and nitrous oxide with suxamethonium as a muscle relaxant. Thirteen received practolol 0.4 mg kg-1 and atropine 1.5 mg i.v. shortly before anaesthesia. During anaesthesia practolol 0.2 mg kg-1 was given. Twelve (control) received atropine 0.5 mg before anaesthesia. Practolol reduced the frequency of tachycardia and arrhythmia. The treatment group had a greater reduction in systolic arterial pressure during induction. The hypertensive response to laryngoscopy was not significantly attenuated by practolol. A weak hyperglycaemic response to microlaryngoscopy was not affected, nor was the plasma concentration of glycerol.", 
    "15": "The hemodynamic effects of prenalterol, a new inotropic agent, were investigated in 10 patients with gram negative septic shock. In four of the patients, coronary sinus blood flow (CSF) and myocardial oxygen and lactate extraction were also determined. After baseline hemodynamic measurements, prenalterol was infused intravenously over a 10-min period to a total dose of 150 micrograms/kg. All patients responded within 15 min after completion of prenalterol infusion by increasing mean arterial pressure from 57 +/- 11 to 75 +/- 20 mmHg (7.58 +/- 46 to 9.97 +/- 2.66 kPa), (+32%), (P less than 0.01) and cardiac index from 2.65 +/- 0.40 to 3.80 +/- 0.47 1.min-1.m-2, (+44%) (P less than 0.001). There was no change in heart rate or systemic vascular resistance, nor were any arrhythmias recorded. The urinary output increased significantly. After prenalterol, CSF increased from 185 +/- 14 to 246 +/- 14 ml.min-1, (+33%), (P less than 0.001) and myocardial oxygen and lactate extraction rose from 19.8 +/- 2.1 to 26.6 +/- 2.1 ml O2.min-1, (+34%) (P less than 0.001) and from 33.2 +/- 2.3 to 44.7 +/- 2.1 mumol.min-1, (+35%), (P less than 0.001), respectively. The total body oxygen consumption increased from 287 +/- 13 to 348 +/- 23 ml O2.min-1, (+21%), (P less than 0.01) and the arterial lactate concentration decreased from 5.61+/- 0.55 to 3.94 +/- 0.16 mmol.l-1, (-30%), (P less than 0.01), suggesting improved tissue perfusion. The results demonstrate that prenalterol is a potent, highly selective inotropic agent inducing the same magnitude of increase in blood pressure and cardiac output as reported for dopamine in septic shock.", 
    "16": "A relatively uncommon but unique and life threatening iatrogenic condition is described. There are few aids to diagnosis but once it is known that the patient has been on practolol the surgical and pathological findings are pathognomonic. Other practolol related side effects are usually present in the patient. The conditions may develop months or possibly years after cessation of intake of the drug and further cases may occur, although practolol has been withdrawn from use. Awareness of the condition is therefore of continuing importance.", 
    "17": "About syncopal attacks caused by cardial arrhythmias had been frequently reported. In one family we found female members of three generations affected by characteristical prolongation and alteration of the QT-interval in ECG. All patients suffered from attacks with loss of consciousness which could not be defined as epileptic fits. Ventricular arrhythmias have to be considered as reason for the attacks. This combination of symptoms without additional malformations (i.e. congenital deafness) is well known in literature as Romano Ward Syndrome. Mode of inheritance, pathogenetic mechanisms and possibilities of therapy are discussed. Therapy witha beta blocking medication (propranolol) made our younger patient free of attacks, the other two patients have no complaints since two years without any therapy.", 
    "18": "Cut splanchnic nerves were stimulated electrically at the preganglionic level in efferent direction in anesthetized cats with the adrenals ligated bilaterally. A significant decrease of the intracellular serotonin (5-HT) levels in populations (n = 20) of individual enterochromaffin cells (EC) in the mucosa from three different levels of the small intestine (distal duodenum, mid-jejunum and terminal ileum) was obtained. The intracellular 5-HT levels before and after stimulation were studied cytofluorimetrically in biopsies treated according to the Falck-Hillarp technique. One group of cats was pretreated with propranolol prior to stimulation. This prevented the decrease in fluorescence intensity effectively. Two other groups of cats were pretreated with phenoxybenzamine or phentolamine. These drugs also blocked the expected decrease in fluorescence intensity in 7 of 8 cats. In some biopsies there was an increased fluorescence intensity after nerve stimulation in cats given propranolol or phentolamine even though the drugs themselves had no intrinsic effects on the fluorescence intensity in control animals. It is concluded that efferent electrical stimulation of the splanchnic nerves can cause a release of 5-HT from gut EC by an adrenergic mechanism.", 
    "19": "Systolic time intervals (STI) were recorded serially before and during 1 year of treatment in 367 hypertensive men. The patients were randomly assigned, double-blind, to one of the following regimens: propranolol alone (P), propranolol plus hydrochlorothiazide (P + T), propranolol plus hydralazine (P + H), propranolol plus hydrochlorothiazide plus hydralazine (P + T + H), or reserpine plus hydrochlorothiazide (R + T). Systolic time intervals were calculated by a computer pattern-recognition and measurement program. Diastolic blood pressure and heart rate (HR) decreased with each treatment regimen. The preejection period (PEP) was prolonged following P alone. The left ventricular ejection time (LVET), after correction for HR, was shortened with P + T and R + T and prolonged after P + H. The PEP/LVET was reduced with P + H. The prolongation of PEP during long-term administration of P is comparable with previous studies of its acute effects and suggests a moderate decrease in left ventricular performance. Calculation of STI also appears to be a useful method for showing the effects of adding other antihypertensive agents.", 
    "20": "Blood pressure variability was studied in 8 \"labile\" and in 8 \"established\" hypertensive patients by means of continuous unrestricted blood pressure recording for 24 hours. In 7 of the former and 5 of the latter the effect of atenolol (200 mg/day) was also investigated. Blood pressure variability as judged by circadian rhythm, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, indexes of skewness and kurtosis was similar in the two groups. The only significant difference consisted in the mean arterial pressure which was higher in the established than in the labile hypertensives. Atenolol produced in all subjects a fall in blood pressure but no significant changes in the standard deviation, coefficient of variation and index of skewness. On the contrary the index of kurtosis significantly increased suggesting a more stable blood pressure after treatment.", 
    "21": "Rats dehydrated up to 12 days were given intraperitoneally propranolol hydrochloride in daily dose of 1.0 mg/100 g of initial body weight. In not dehydrated animals the only dose of propranolol increased significantly the vasopressin and oxytocin release from the neurohypophysis. In dehydrated animals propranolol restrained somewhat the decrease of vasopressin in the neurohypophysis, but intensified the vasopressin depletion in the hypothalamus. The oxytocic potency of both the neurohypophysis and hypothalamus decreased progressively in animals deprived of water. Propranolol potentiated this effect of osmoreceptor stimulation.", 
    "22": "Sotalol [4-(2-isopropylamino-1-hydroxyethyl)-methane-sulfonanilide hydrochloride] is a beta-adrenergic blocking agent. Despite the widespread use of these drugs, poisonings are not frequent. In this report the authors describe the first recorded case of fatal sotalol overdosage to their knowledge. The results of toxicological analysis, performed by a specially developed method, are presented, and compared with findings in fatal intoxications with other beta-adrenergic blocking agents.", 
    "23": "A case of alprenolol-induced thrombocytopenia in a 65-year-old woman is reported. She was admitted to the hospital twice with platelet counts below 10X10(9)/l. The platelet count rapidly returned to normal after discontinuation of alprenolol. The reason for the thrombocytopenia was increased platelet destruction.", 
    "24": "Eighty-seven patients with an acute myocardial infarction and a pulse rate of greater than or equal to 80/min on admission were randomly allotted to one group given cardioselective beta-blockade, a second group given diazepam, and a third group given placebo. The three groups were comparable in age, sex distribution, previous history of ischemic heart disease, initial pulse rate, blood pressure, pain index, enzyme values, and degree of ST elevation. The acute mortality (within 10 days) did not differ between the groups. The drug treatment elicited no reduction of infarct size, as judged from enzyme levels, degree of reduction of ST elevation, or physical exercise capacity. The reasons for this negative result are discussed. One possibility is that in routine clinical practice the therapeutic intervention starts too late after onset of symptoms. A beneficial effect on mortality among the patients whose treatment started early after onset of symptoms supports this conclusion.", 
    "25": "A study was carried out in 73 patients with mild or moderate hypertension to assess the effectiveness of treatment with labetalol. After a 2 to 4-week period on placebo, patients received 200 mg labetalol daily for 4 weeks, after which time dosage was doubled if the blood pressure was not satisfactorily controlled. Treatment was continued for a further 4 weeks and was followed by another period on placebo. Pre-treatment levels of 157/99 mmHg were significantly reduced after 2 weeks, and after 4 weeks the mean reduction was 14/8 mmHg. Half the patients had their dosage increased to 400 mg daily. At the end of the 8-week active treatment period, 80% were adequately controlled, the mean reduction in blood pressure being 22/12 mmHg compared with placebo values. Heart rate was significantly reduced from 78 to 69 beats per min during labetalol therapy. The reduction in blood pressure was similar whether or not patients had been previously treated or untreated, but heart rate was reduced more in the previously treated group. Four weeks after the end of labetalol therapy blood pressure and heart rate had increased but were less than during the initial placebo period and did not give rise to any severe problems.", 
    "26": "The absorption of timolol after topical administration to the eye was studied in 11 healthy volunteers and in 5 patients with bilateral open angle glaucoma. The volunteers received 2 drops of 0.5% timolol ophthalmic solution in each eye, equivalent to 0.8 mg of timolol maleate. Overflow was absorbed by paper tissue. The patients received the same dose twice daily for 2 weeks and were then investigated. In the paper tissue, 12 to 88% of the dose administered was recovered. Plasma concentrations were never above 5 ng/ml and not always detectable (detection limit 1 to 2 ng/ml). However, timolol was absorbed as the drug was found in the urine samples from all volunteers and glaucomatous patients.", 
    "27": "Review of a longitudinal study of the effects of 40 mg of propranolol orally in 14 patients with coronary heart disease demonstrated a minor but not statistically significant change in the relationship of percentage of maximal oxygen uptake to percentage of maximal heart rate. In a cross-sectional comparison of several hundred patients who showed no other significant difference in initial findings in relation to propranolol, significant differences were present with respect to resting heart rate and responses to symptom-limited exercise, nevertheless the relationship of percentage of maximal oxygen uptake to the percentage of maximal heart rate was similar. Accordingly, we recommend maximal exercise testing in all patients prior to undertaking an exercise program so that their maximal heart rate can be determined accurately and rational training heart rates advised. The exercise test should be performed with the patients taking medications they anticipate continuing during the period of physical training, and if a change in medications is subsequently made then the exercise test should be repeated.", 
    "28": "1. A method is described for altering the pressure across the wall of the carotid sinus in conscious rabbits by enclosing the carotid bifurcation in a rigid, fluid-filled capsule. The extracapsular arterial baroreceptors were denervated. 2. The baroreceptor--heart rate reflex, elicited by injecting vasoactive drugs or inflating aortic and vena caval cuffs, was used to test the new method. The function of the carotid sinus was shown to be unaffected by enclosure in the capsule. Denervation of the extracapsular baroreceptors reduced the gain of the baroreceptor--heart rate reflex two- to threefold. 3. The characteristics of the carotid baroreceptor reflex were studied in sixteen animals by the capsule method. Median estimates of maximum gain, and the range over which blood pressure changed, were 1.1 mmHg/mmHg and 57 mmHg respectively. There was good agreement between duplicate estimates made 1--20 days apart. 4. There was only a weak association between the effects on blood pressure and heart rate of altering carotid sinus transmural pressure. Autonomic blockade of the heart, so that its rate was fixed, did not reduce the gain or range of blood pressure change.", 
    "29": "1. The effects of efferent electric pelvic nerve stimulation on colorectal motility and blood flow with emphasis on the motor responses in consecutive colonic and rectal segments were studied in anaesthetized cats. It was considered of particular interest to explore whether selective pharmacological blockade and graded nerve stimulations might reveal the presence of functionally differentiated efferent fibres controlling colonic motility.2. Pelvic nerve stimulation induced immediate and sustained colorectal contractions and a simultaneous increase of the over-all colonic blood flow. The excitatory responses declined immediately on cessation of a shortlasting stimulation (< 2 min); after a longlasting one, however, the rectal contraction was maintained for several min.3. The colonic contraction on pelvic nerve stimulation remained unchanged after atropine but was delayed in onset. Moreover, in the transverse and distal colon it was preceded by a relaxation which was most pronounced in the distal part. The vasodilator response was unchanged.4. After atropine the rectal segment showed a purely relaxatory response. Despite continuous pelvic nerve stimulation the relaxation vanished, however, and rectal volume returned to resting level with 3-5 min. On cessation of such a prolonged stimulation there was a marked rectal ;after-contraction'.5. The excitation thresholds for the efferent nerve fibres eliciting these different responses could not be separated. The motility and the vasodilator responses were not influenced by adrenergic or by serotoninergic blockade.6. The results indicate that direct preganglionic stimulation of the cat pelvic nerves activates intramural cholinergic excitatory neurones as well as non-cholinergic excitatory neurones and furthermore, non-adrenergic non-cholinergic inhibitory neurones, which together result in most complex colonic and rectal motor responses. From a functional point of view these centrally controlled responses may well be independently controlled by separate preganglionic neurones though they do not differ concerning excitation thresholds.7. The effects are consistent with a dual function of the distal colon and rectum. Such a dual parasympathetic influence on the large bowel simulates the vagal control of the stomach, where specific vagal relaxatory fibres convey a reflex widening of the corpus-fundus reservoir during food intake.", 
    "30": "This study was designed to determine whether or not verapamil and propranolol affect the lowering of the ventricular multiple response threshold (VMRT) that is seen following release of a previously ligated coronary artery. In mongrel dogs, the left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded for 15 min and then the ligation was released. The dogs were divided into three groups: in the control group, saline was administrated immediately before the release of ligation; in the two other groups, verapamil or propranolol were administrated immediately before the release of ligation. In the control group, VMRT was decreased during coronary occlusion and did not recover immediately after coronary recirculation. That is, significantly lowered values were observed at 5 and 10 min after reperfusion. The administration of verapamil prevented the lowering of VMRT after reperfusion, whereas propranolol had no effect. In all three groups, an increase in the difference of the concentration of K+ between the great cardiac vein and the femoral vein (delta K+) was observed soon after occlusion; however, delta K+ returned to normal soon after reperfusion. These results and the known anti-arrhythmic mechanism of verapamil suggests that Ca++-dependent action potentials might play an important role in lowering VMRT after release of a previously occluded coronary artery, whereas the effects of K+ and catecholamine do not play a role in causing the lowering of VMRT.", 
    "31": "The antihypertensive effect and the tolerability of metoprolol Durules have been studied in fifty-five patients with mild to moderate hypertension. The patients' diastolic blood pressure was greater than or equal to 95 mm Hg in order to qualify for entry. Thirty-seven out of fifty-three patients completing the study (70%) were treated with metoprolol Durules monotherapy throughout the study. The mean blood pressure was reduced from 153/101 to 138/92 mm Hg after metoprolol Durules compared to placebo (p less than 0.001). Twenty-seven patients received one Durules daily and ten patients received two Durules daily as the final dose. Of the sixteen patients not responding on metoprolol Durules, six patients achieved satisfactory control, i.e. a diastolic blood pressure below 95 mm Hg, when given 200 mg metoprolol + 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide (HCT). The results indicate that most patients with mild or moderate hypertension can be controlled with metoprolol Durules monotherapy given one daily. The addition of HCT gives a significant benefit in moderate hypertension, where metoprolol monotherapy is not sufficient.", 
    "32": "The effect of conventional propranolol and bendrofluazide tablets given twice daily has been compared with an equivalent dosage combined in a single capsule given twice daily in fourteen patients with essential hypertension. Good blood pressure control was achieved on both regimes in the majority of patients and there was no significant difference in treatment response between the two regimes. Use of the combined capsule is convenient and may improve patient compliance.",

Chronic beta-adrenoceptor blockade with oxprenolol causes elevation of plasma noradrenaline levels, as compared with placebo, despite a significant fall in blood pressure and pulse rate. 2. The plasma noradrenaline concentration is not influenced by the frequency of administration or the formulation of the drug. 3. Plasma noradrenaline levels are not correlated with the plasma concentration of the drug. 4. The changes in plasma noradrenaline concentrations support a peripheral rather than central mechanism of action of beta-adrenoceptor blockers in man.", 
    "34": "Changes in the QT and QTc intervals were studied in 16 patients by atrial pacing at rates of 100, 130, and 150 beats/minute. In all patients the measured QT shortened when the atrial paced rate was increased, but when corrected for heart rate the QTc lengthened. Intravenously administered propranolol produced a bradycardia and a lengthening of the QT interval in 15 of the 16 patients studied. When the QT interval was corrected for heart rate using Bazett's formula the QTc was shortened in 13 patients, unchanged in one, and lengthened in two. However, when the QT interval was measured at identical atrial paced rates the QT of the 15 patients studied was lengthened in 10 and unchanged in five. In none was the QT interval shortened. These results show firstly that Bazett's formula is unsuitable for correction of QT interval changes induced by atrial pacing, and secondly that, though intravenously administered propranolol usally produces a shortening of the QTc, when its effect is assessed directly by using an identical atrial paced rate the QT interval usually lengthens, or may remain unchanged, but never shortens. It is suggested that the formal assessment of drug induced QT interval changes should be made at identical atrial paced rates.", 
    "35": "This is a report of a patient who survived a large propranolol overdose, as documented by toxic blood levels. The signs and symptoms were those of profound inotropic and moderate chronotropic cardiotoxicity which failed to respond to parasympatholytics or catecholamines, but subsequently reversed coincident with the administration of glucagon. We report this case because of the sudden development of shock in a patient who looked deceptively well, and because of the improvement apparently brought about by glucagon.", 
    "36": "The effects of constant intravenous infusion of propranolol, 1 mg/kg/h, on acute renal failure produced by 1 h occlusion of the left renal artery in the rat were investigated by clearance and micropuncture techniques. Propranolol infusion resulted in a significantly smaller rise in proximal intratubular pressure than that observed following renal ischemia in the saline-infused group. When compared with saline-infused animals, this effectwas accompanied by a significant improvement in inulin clearance without commensurate increase in renal blood flow or stop flow pressure and suggests attenuation of intratubular obstruction by the drug. A complex metabolic effect may be involved.", 
    "37": "Two siblings are described with hypertension, hyperreninism, hyperaldosteronism and hypokalemia. Propranolol therapy lowered blood pressure markedly, but failed to normalize serum potassium. Indomethacin orally decreased blood pressure and normalized all biochemical abnormalities. We suggest that in these patients there exists a renin-dependent hypertension in combination with a state of hyperprostaglandinism. It is likely from our studies in these 2 patients, that the state of hyperprostaglandinism is secondary to a hypertension with increased sympathetic tone.", 
    "38": "In 26 patients with essential hypertension who were on continuous chlorthalidone therapy, 1 and 3 daily doses of propranolol were compared in a crossover study. Plasma propranolol levels and heart rates had larger daily fluctuations on single-dose therapy than on 3 times daily; plasma renin activity was more constant. There was no significant difference in blood pressures. Once-daily propranolol dosage was well tolerated and possibly gave less rise to the troublesome side effect of vivid dreaming.", 
    "39": "The disposition of the pharmacologically active 4-hydroxypropranolol (HO-P), its glucuronic acid conjugate (HO-P-G), and propranolol were compared after single intravenous and oral doses of propranolol in 6 normal subjects and after long-term therapy in 32 patients with hypertension or coronary artery disease. The areas under the plasma concentration/time curves (AUCoo, ng . hr/ml) after 4-mg intravenous doses of propranolol were 6.6 +/- 2.2 (mean +/- SEM) for HO-P and 55 +/- 11 for propranolol. After 20- and 80-mg oral doses the AUCoo for HO-P were 59 +/- 9 and 162 +/- 21 and for propranolol were 72 +/- 9 and 306 +/- 46. Peak HO-P concentrations were reached at 1 to 1.5 hr after the oral doses. Although there was a rapid decline in plasma HO-P between 1.5 and 3 hr when HO-P-G was still rising to levels above HO-P levels 3.5- to 5-fold, the apparent half-lifes (t1/2s) after 3 hr were in the same range for HO-P, HO-P-G, and propranolol (3.0 to 4.2 hr). While during long-term therapy plasma HO-P rose over the whole dose range (40 to 960 mg daily) in an apparently linear fashion, the HO-P/propranol plasma level ratio fell from 1.07 +/- 0.13 at 40 mg daily to only 0.09 +/- 0.01 at 640 mg daily. Plasma HO-P-G rose exponentially with dose and demonstrated significant cumulation. HO-P and HO-P-G in urine accounted for about 9% of long-term propranolol doses. This study suggests a significant contribution of HO-P to pharmacologic effects, in particular at low single and long-term oral doses of propranolol and saturation of naphthalene ring oxidation as a main determinant of propranolol bioavailability.", 
    "40": "In an attempt to prevent recurrent reentrant supraventricular tachycardia, an experimentally designed new pacemaker has been developed. The pacemaker, when connected to both atrial and ventricular electrodes, is capable of sensing either an atrial or ventricular signal and, in turn, triggers simultaneous atrioventricular A-V) stimulation. Efficacy of this pacemake was tested in four patients with recurrent paroxysmal A-V nodal reentrant tachycardia during electrophysiologic studies. After connection of the electrodes to the new pacemaker, all atrial or ventricular premature stimuli elicited simultaneous A-V stimulation with resultant impulse collision in the A-V junction. Consequently, the reentrant tachycardia zone was completely abolished in all patients. This study has thus demonstrated the clinical feasibility of simultaneous A-V pacing to abolish the supraventricular tachycardia zone in man.", 
    "41": "A double-blind comparison between BS 100-141 and placebo in 36 hypertensive patients of Thai or Thai-Chinese origin revealed that the preparation lowers the elevated blood pressure within the first week of treatment in most patients. The drug was relatively well tolerated and caused mild side effects only. After a sudden discontinuation of the drug, the blood pressure in four of the 19 patients increased within a few days to pretreatment values or slightly above. The occurrence of rebound hypertension cannot be excluded. Interruption of treatment, therefore, should be made gradually.", 
    "42": "Mitral valve prolapse is a common cardiac anomaly in which diagnosis is generally made by auscultation. In a typical case, a midsystolic click followed by a late systolic murmur is heard, although this pattern can vary. Selected pharmacologic agents (vasopressors and vasodilators) may be useful in diagnosis, and echocardiography can be helpful in cases without auscultatory signs. In the majority of cases, mitral valve prolapse is benign and no specific treatment is needed except reassurance and perhaps endocarditis prophylaxis. Patients with chest pain and symptomatic arrhythmias may benefit from propranolol, those with ventricular tachycardia should receive antiarrhythmic therapy, and those with abnormal resting ECGs or frequent ventricular premature beats should be further tested because of increased risk of sudden death or possibility of associated ischemic heart disease.", 
    "43": "The effect of adrenergic receptor-blocking agents upon plasma levels of human pancreatic polypeptide (hPP), human GH (hGH), immunoreactive insulin, and glucose during graded submaximal exercise was ascertained in six healthy nonobese males. Subjects exercised from 0--27 min on a motor-driven treadmill and received infusions from -10 to 40 min of either 1) saline, 2) saline plus phentolamine (0.5 mg/min; alpha-adrenergic blockade), or 3) propranolol (3 mg) from -10 to -5 min, followed by saline plus propranolol (0.08 mg/min; beta-adrenergic blockade). During saline-exercise, mean plasma hPP rose from a mean (+/-SE) basal level of 45 +/- 11 to 149 +/- 51 pg/ml at 27 min, whereas with phentolamine-exercise, the maximal level reached by mean plasma hPP (305 +/- 28 pg/ml) was significantly greater than that with saline (P less than 0.05). During propranolol-exercise, mean plasma hPP did not rise significantly above the basal level. The incremental area under the hPP curve for phentolamine-exercise also was significantly greater than that for saline-exercise or propranolol-exercise. The changes in plasma hGH during and after saline-exercise correlated with those of hPP, but the effects of phentolamine and propranolol upon exercise-induced increases in hGH were opposite to the effects upon hPP. The exercise-induced fall in immunoreactive insulin was accentuated with propranolol and abolished with phentolamine. It is concluded that 1) submaximal exercise stimulates secretion of hPP and hGH, 2) adrnergic mechanisms participate in exercise-induced increased secretion of hPP (beta-adrenergic stimulation augments secretion and alpha-adrenergic stimulation inhibits secretion), and 3) adrenergic effects which modulate exercise-induced secretion of hPP and insulin are in parallel but are opposite to those that modulate the secretion of hGH.", 
    "44": "To evaluate the diagnostic potential and hemodynamic significance of exercise-induced multiple-lead QRS changes, we studied exercise test responses in 230 patients with chest pain syndromes undergoing Bruce protocol exercise tests. When increases in the R waves of multiple ECG leads (epsilon R) plus ST segment change greater than 1 mm were present, 74 of 75 patients (99%) had coronary disease; this was a higher percentage than that achieved with either measurement alone or when ST change was combined with increase in R in a single lead. Sixty-four of the 75 patients (85%) had multivessel disease, the most severe form of coronary artery disease. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (both at rest and after left ventriculography), presence and degree of resting ventricular asynergy, and ejection fraction were all significantly more abnormal in patients whose epsilon R increased, regardless of ST-segment change. Further, in patients who stopped exercise because of cardiac symptoms, exercise duration and the product of heart rate times blood pressure were significantly lower when epsilon R increased. Thus, the mechanism for the increase in epsilon R with exercise in patients with coronary artery disease appears to be related to abnormalities in left ventricular function.", 
    "45": "The effect of beta-adrenergic blockade achieved by propranolol (0.5-1.0 mg/kg) on the inotropic alterations induced by adrenergic hyperactivity resulting from bilateral carotid occlusion (BCO) was analysed in 25 dogs anesthetized with morphine (2 mg/kg) and sodium pentobarbital (20 mg/kg). The heart rate was kept unchanged by means of a pace-maker. The first derivative of ventricular pressure (dp/dt) was considered as contractility index. Because BCO is followed by increase of left ventricle end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and of blood pressure (BP), to avoid the influence of these variables on dp/dt, we have reduced preload and afterload by means of hemorrhage (group A) and alpha-adrenergic blocker administration--phentolamine (group B). The carotid occlusion promoted similar variations in hemodynamic parameters in the two groups--there was a significant increase of blood pressure and LVEDP. BCO did not produce alteration in dp/dt values in both groups; when BP and LVEDP in group A were reduced, there was a significant reduction of dp/dt (2 927 +/- 139 to 2 066 +/- 95 mmHg/s; p less than 0.01). However there was no dp/dt alteration in group B (2 559 +/- 239 to 2 512 +/- 285 mmHg/s). These results suggest that during increase of sympathetic activity, anesthetized dogs under beta-adrenergic blockade show contractility depression. This could be related to secondary myocardic hypoxia and coronary vasoconstriction due to coronary alpha-adrenergic hyperactivity, once cardiac inotropism response can be alleviated by alpha-adrenergic blockers.", 
    "46": "Practolol (15 mg/kg i.c.) and atenolol (3 mg/kg i.v.) induced in rats hypotensive effects different from one group to another. However these hypotensive effects were always more important in hypertensive than in normotensive animals. IN Okamoto rats, hypotensive effect of atenolol increased with the age of the animals. In normotensive rats, atenolol had no effect whatever the animal age. Evans blue injected by intracarotid route in normotensive and hypertensive rats showed an increased permeability in Okamoto rats blood-brain barrier. After lesion of blood-brain barrier by intracarotid injected cetrimonium, hypotensive effect of the two beta-blocking drugs appeared in both normotensive and hypertensive rats, with a greater degree than in control rats.", 
    "47": "Under isometric conditions simultaneous recordings are made of the contractile activity of smooth-muscle strips (2/20 mm) isolated from the terminal ileum (T1), the ileo-caecal sphincter (ICS) and the caecum (C) of cats. Transmural electrical stimulation is applied (0.1-0.5 ms. 2-15 Hz at supramaximal current) for 20-60 s. ICS manifests tonic changes (1st type of activity) and sometimes phasic contractions (second type of activity); phasic contractions are recorded in T1 and C. Switching on of the stimulation causes relaxation (on-response) of ICS, with maximum values in the 5-9 Hz interval. Two types of off-response are observed when the stimulation is switched off: in the strips of the first type of off-response is characterized by tonic contraction only, while in the strips of the second type there is high-amplitude contraction followed by a rise in the tone on which phasic contractions are superimposed. Inhibition of the phasic contraction and a slight decrease of the tone characterize the on-response resembles that of the ICS strips of the second type. In the C strips there is an evoked high-amplitude phasic contraction when the stimulation is switched on. The responses of ICS, T1 and C to transmural electrical stimulation are nerve-transmitted, because they are blocked by TTX (10-6 g/l). On the basis of the analysis with atropine (10-6 M), phentolamine (10-5M) and propranolol (10-5M) it is assumed that nonadrenergic inhibitory mechanisms are involved in the on-response of ICS to transmural electrical stimulation, while predominantly cholinergic and adrenergic mechanisms of regulation are manifested in the off-response of ICS and in the responses of T1 and C.", 
    "48": "Effect of isoproterenol and propranolol on the production of hemocytotropic antibodies and degranulation of peritoneal mast cells from sensitized mice was studied. It was demonstrated that stimulation with large doses of the antigen caused degranulation of peritoneal mast cells and that additional administration of a beta antagonist propranolol failed to increase the degranulation phenomenon. Marked inhibition in degranulation of mast cells was seen in mice sensitized with large and small doses of antigen after isoproterenol. In 2h PCA test in animals immunized with large doses of the antigen a higher activity of PCA reaction illustrating the concentration of IgG1 antibodies was noted. With higher doses of the antigen and propranolol the titers of the antibodies were markedly higher. The inhibiting effect of isoprenaline on the passive cutaneous anaphylaxis was observed only in the 72 h-test, mostly in the group of mice immunized with small doses of the antigen.", 
    "49": "This article presents an experimental method using cats for investigation of the local ulcerogenic properties of oral drugs in the esophagus. 15 drugs in current clinical use were tested. The drugs were placed in esophagus and the animals were sacrificed after 5--8 h, 4--7 or 21 days. The esophagus was cut open, photographed macroscopically and sectioned for light microscopy. Several drugs, e.g. doxycycline, alprenolol, propranolol, ferrosuccinate, ferrosulfate, and emepronium bromide showed marked ulcerogenic properties, whereas indomethacin and betamethasone did not cause any lesions in the cat esophagus. The results seem to be in accordance with the local effect these same drugs exert on the human esophageal mucosa. In order to predict and prevent drug-induced esophageal lesions in man we suggest that oral drugs should be tested concerning their local ulcerogenic properties in the esophagus.", 
    "50": "In a retrospective survey of 134 patients undergoing bilateral nephrectomy from 1969 to 1980 it was found that the commonest indications were hypertension (60%) and infection/reflux (22%). Operation in hypertensive dialysis patients was followed by a fall in blood pressure in 70% (SE 9%) at one and 3 months while normotensive patients having their kidneys out for other reasons had a 47% (SE 11%) incidence of hypertension at one month and 7 out of 10 were still hypertensive at 3 months. When operation was performed in transplanted patients, 7 of 10 hypertensives had a fall in pressure, one of 6 normotensive persons had an increase, an use of antihypertensive drugs fell from 13/16 to 4 of 16 patients. The mortality was 10.4% (SE 2.6%) overall, the mortality of operations which included an unplanned splenectomy was significantly higher. There were 34 other complications in 25 patients. Complications, but not deaths, were more frequent in operations performed in dialysis patients rather than at the same time as, or after, a transplant. Over 12 years the ratio of bilateral nephrectomy to renal transplant operations has fallen from 8% (1969-1971) to 18% (1978 to present). The decrease is partly due to a fall in the number of operations for hypertension in dialysis patients and may be related to the appearance of beta-blocker and new vasodilator drugs.", 
    "51": "A preselected population of 96 patients (67 glaucomas, 29 ocular hypertensions) were followed for an average period of 30 months. Timolol eye drops were administered either alone, in dosage strengths of 0.25 or 0.5% or in combination with other antiglaucoma drugs. 9 patients were lost to follow-up after a mean treatment duration of 15.3 months; glaucoma had been stabilized in all of them. 10 patients had unsatisfactory intraocular pressure control and 7 had to undergo trabeculectomy (9 of these 10 patients had campimetric glaucoma at the beginning of the study), whereas 76 patients had satisfactory intraocular pressure control and, in the majority, stabilization of glaucoma had been obtained. In 77% of this preselected population glaucoma was stabilized over a period of 3 years (i.e. close to two thirds of those starting treatment, 70% of which had campimetric glaucoma).", 
    "52": "The role of peripheral catecholamines in mediating the pressor and tremorigenic effects of oxotremorine were investigated in conscious rats. At time of peak tremor intensity induced by oxotremorine, plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline were increased 3--4-fold. Tremor intensity was substantially reduced by either adrenal medullectomy, chemical sympathectomy with 6-hydroxydopamine, or injection of 2.5 mg/kg L-propranolol. The pressor response to oxotremorine was not reduced by adrenal denervation, which however prevented the usual rise in plasma adrenaline but not that of noradrenaline. It is concluded that central cholinergic receptor stimulation activates the sympatho-adrenal system. While both adrenaline and intact sympathetic nerves are necessary for the mediation of the full tremorigenic effect, the pressor response to oxotremorine is mainly due to the effect of noradrenaline on vascular alpha-receptors.", 
    "53": "Fifty one patients undergoing fiberoptic bronchoscopy were premedicated with atropine and anesthetised with thiopental, nitrous oxide and succinylcholine as a muscle relaxant. Twenty-six patients consisted the control group while twenty-five were given alcohol orally for three consecutive days before the procedure. The treatment group had no cardiac arrhythmias during bronchoscopy while six of the control subjects developed arrhythmias. Heart rate and mean arterial pressure were maintained significantly lower in the treatment group, thus the hypertensive response to tracheal intubation and bronchoscopy was significantly attenuated by atenolol.", 
    "54": "In programs where therapeutic drug monitoring is accompanied by interpretation of the data, unusual and unanticipated values may mean more than just a laboratory error. Many times such spurious results will be due to unusual circumstances that result in the drug never reaching the bloodstream. In 3 case reports, we show that purposeful inhospital noncompliance and failure to recognize simple drug absorption interactions can be added to the evergrowing list of factors influencing serum concentrations of therapeutic agents.", 
    "55": "Beta-adrenergic binding sites have been identified and characterized on murine lymphocytes. The binding sites are of two distinct classes, a high affinity class which has an apparent dissociation constant of about 1 x 10(-9)M and numbers about 500 sites per cell, and a higher capacity binding class that appears to be more characteristic of a non-specific binding site. The binding of a beta-adrenergic radioligand at concentrations about equal to the Kd (dissociation constant) for the high affinity site can be competed for with classical adrenergic ligands, is reversible and does not display cooperative interactions.", 
    "56": "The antihypertensive effect and the tolerability of the cardioselective beta-blocking drug metoprolol, in comparison to methyldopa, were assessed in 119 hypertensive patients (73 WHO stage 1 and 46 WHO stage 2). After 2 weeks of placebo wash-out, the patients were randomly allocated to treatment with either of the two drugs: metoprolol up to 200 mg bid, and methyldopa up to 500 mg bid, for 6 weeks. Periodical clinical, biochemical, haematological, radiological and electrocardiographical measurements were performed. In respect to pre-treatment values, heart rate, both in lying and standing position, was significantly reduced (P less than 0.01) only in the metoprolol group, while systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly reduced (P less than 0.01) with both drugs in both positions. Asymptotic regression analysis showed that velocity of blood pressure reduction was comparable with both drugs. In the lying position, the diastolic blood pressure reduction obtained with metoprolol was significantly greater (P less than 0.05) in respect to that obtained with methyldopa. In general, side effects were few and of mild severity: mainly bradycardia in the metoprolol group and dizziness and fatigue in the methyldopa group. After the formal end of the double-blind trial, 36 patients, 14 in the metoprolol group and 22 in the methyldopa group, were treated in open conditions with metoprolol alone; after an average period of 6.5 weeks, diastolic blood pressure was significantly reduced (P less than 0.05) only in the group previously treated with methyldopa. In conclusion, metoprolol is a well tolerated and effective antihypertensive agent, which may be safely used in patients with mild to moderate hypertension.", 
    "57": "Effects of phenoxybenzamine (1 mg per 100 g i.v.), propranolol (0.2 mg per 100 g i.v.), phenylephrine (0.1--0.3--1.0--3.0 micrograms per 100 g per min) and isoproterenol (0.01--0.03--0.1--0.3 micrograms per 100 g per min) were studied on cardiac output (Evans-blue dilution), organ and tumour blood flows (Sapirstein's isotope indicator dilution technique) in rats bearing Gu\u00e9rin carcinoma. In agreement with our earlier results data for haematocrit, blood pressure, TPR and organ vascular resistance were lower whereas cardiac index and organ blood flow were higher in control untreated tumour-bearing animals than in untreated normal rats. Phenoxybenzamine, depending on tumour size, decreased blood pressure, TPR and vascular resistance of organs, while it was found ineffective in rats with tumours of very large size (60--80 g). Propranolol treatment produced slight and similar effects in both normal and tumour-bearing rats. Phenylephrine enhanced peripheral resistance as a function of log dose in both normal and tumour bearing animals, nevertheless in the latter group it elicited more marked responses in the vascular bed of the kidneys, intestines and skin. The vasodilatory log dose dependent effect of isoproterenol was not present in tumour-bearing rats. In addition to the anaemia, the continuous decrease of alpha adrenergic activity in the systemic circulation parallel with tumour growth appears to be the most reasonable explanation for the \"hyperkinesis\" observed in tumour-bearing rats. Resistance of tumour vascular bed was increased by both phenoxybenzamine and propranolol. During the course of phenylephrine infusion (1.0 or 3.0 micrograms per min) the resistance of tumour vessels was more increased than that of other organs. Isoproterenol infusion resulted in a vasoconstriction of the tumour vessel. It appears that with maximally dilated vessels, vasoconstriction remains the only possible vascular response in Gu\u00e9rin carcinoma. In the vascular bed of the tumour a preponderance of beta adrenergic receptors also seems to be feasible.", 
    "58": "Previous studies in man have shown that during beta-adrenoceptor blockade physical exercise caused a significantly greater elevation of plasma catecholamines than without blockade. After blockade of beta-adrenoceptors, increased levels of circulating catecholamines should have an unopposed effect on adrenergic alpha-receptors. In order to elucidate such an effect, experiments were performed with 7 trained dogs before and after acute beta-adrenoceptor blockade (0.1 mg/kg (-)-propranolol i. v.). Exercise was performed on a conveyor (10 min, 10 km/h, slope 10%). Besides catecholamine concentrations in plasma, as an index of alpha-receptor-stimulation potassium concentrations in plasma were determined. Immediately after exercise, plasma noradrenaline was increased from 310 to 579 pg/ml, plasma adrenaline from 136 to 222 pg/ml and plasma potassium from 4.23 to 4.6 mmol/l. After beta-adrenoceptor blockade exercise caused a significantly higher increase in plasma noradrenaline from 352 to 755 pg/ml and plasma adrenaline from 172 to 260 pg/ml. Also plasma potassium concentrations were significantly elevated from 4.03 to 5.05 mmol/l. The results indicate an enhanced reflex activation of sympatho-neuronal and sympatho-adrenal mechanisms during exercise after beta-adrenoceptor blockade; the increased concentrations of noradrenaline at the adrenoceptors might reduce the efficiency of beta-blockade. Concomitantly, increased stimulation of alpha-adrenoceptors is elicited, which becomes obvious by an increase of potassium concentration in plasma."
