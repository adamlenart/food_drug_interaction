    "0": "The relative importance of neural and humoral components in the pathogenesis of migraine has yet to be determined, but there is circumstantial evidence that implicates noradrenaline and serotonin as neural or humoral mediators in the recurrent headache, neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms that comprise the migraine syndrome. The treatment of migraine includes the avoidance of precipitating factors when possible, psychological counselling and relaxation training. Pharmacotherapy can be considered rationally in terms of agents acting on receptors that may possibly play a part in the mechanism of migraine.", 
    "1": "The reduction of food intake in hungry rats induced by salbutamol (10 mg/kg/i.p.) was prevented by IPS 339 (5 mg/kg, i.p.) a selective beta 2 adrenergic antagonist, but not by metoprolol (10 mg/kg i.p.), a blocker of beta 1 adrenergic receptors. Similarly, bilateral injections of IPS 339 (32 micrograms/1 microliter) but not metoprolol (80 micrograms/1 microliter) in the perifornical hypothalamic area completely antagonized the anorectic effect of intraperitoneal salbutamol, suggesting an involvement of beta 2 adrenergic receptors in this brain area. Clenbuterol, a beta 2 adrenergic agonist which readily crosses the blood-brain barrier, was 10-100 times more potent than salbutamol in inhibiting feeding consumption of deprived rats when injected intraperitoneally and this effect was also selectively antagonized by pretreatment with IPS 339. Neither IPS 339 nor metoprolol injected in the perifornical hypothalamus significantly modified the anorectic effect of diethylpropion (5 mg/kg i.p.) whereas it was partially prevented by intraperifornical injection of 1-propranolol (52 micrograms/2 microliter), a non-selective beta antagonist, suggesting that both beta 1 and beta 2 adrenergic receptors in the hypothalamus contribute to the mechanism by which diethylpropion causes anorexia.", 
    "2": "Ten healthy adult male volunteers were studied to assess the urinary effects of a single dose of a combination of hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg and acebutolol 200 mg (HZAL). The formation induced a significant increase in the 24-hour urinary output of sodium. Outputs of fluid, chloride, potassium, calcium, magnesium, zinc, total inorganic phosphate and creatinine were unaffected. With the exception of Mg2+ flow, times to maximal urinary flows of fluid and solutes were shortened by HZAL. These qualitative changes resemble those induced by hydrochlorothiazide but did not achieve quantitative significance, either because the constituent diuretic dose was too small or because acebutolol compensated for some of its effects.", 
    "3": "Little information exists on the epidemiology of central nervous system side effects in patients taking antihypertensive medications. We examined prevalence rates of tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) use among a random sample (N = 143,253) of Medicaid recipients. The TCA use was compared for patients taking any of seven antihypertensive agents and for those prescribed insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents. Use of TCA was significantly higher in patients taking beta-blockers (23% over two years) than for patients taking hydralazine or hypoglycemics (both 15%) or methyldopa or reserpine (both 10%). Prevalence rate ratios revealed a risk of being prescribed a TCA of 1.5 (95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 1.7) for patients receiving beta-blockers relative to patients receiving hydralazine or hypoglycemics. beta-Blocker use may be an important cause of iatrogenic depression among hypertensive patients.", 
    "4": "The intra-ocular pressure in 76 patients, undergoing Neodymium: YAG laser surgery was measured just before treatment, and one and two hours afterwards. The fellow eye served as a control. Serious elevation of the intra-ocular pressure was demonstrated, especially in capsulotomy in the aphakic eye, to a lesser extent in pseudophakic eyes. Intra-ocular pressure elevation of more than 20 mm was seen in iridectomies. Timolol 1/2% eyedrops given before Neodymium: YAG laser treatment minimized the elevation of the intra-ocular pressure. Prolonged follow-up of the intra-ocular pressure is recommended.", 
    "5": "This study was done to delineate the role of alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors and cyclic AMP in the mechanism of ethanol effects on insulin release from isolated islets. Rats were given an alpha-adrenergic blocker, phentolamine, or a beta-adrenergic blocker, propranolol. In addition, ethanol 1 g/kg was given intragastrically 1 h prior to sacrifice. Glucose mediated insulin release from isolated islets was enhanced by phentolamine and decreased by propranolol. Ethanol treatment inhibited glucose-induced insulin release from isolated islets of control rats as well as those given phentolamine and/or propranolol. Insulin release from isolated islets in response to dibutyryl-cyclic AMP was attenuated by ethanol. Theophylline enhanced glucose mediated insulin release from control islets but ethanol treatment produced a significant inhibition of insulin response. The data suggest that the site of action of the deleterious effects of ethanol on insulin release from isolated islets in rat does not involve adrenergic system and cyclic AMP.", 
    "6": "Incubation of purified bovine photoreceptor rod outer segments with [gamma-32P]ATP resulted in the labeling of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PIP) and phosphatidic acid (PA) with little labeling of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). Propranolol inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the labeling of PA and enhanced that of PIP. Various cationic amphiphilic drugs also were tested for these effects. Propranolol had the same effects on high-speed rat brain particulate material. While this particular preparation displayed more labeling of PIP2, propranolol was ineffective, as it was on retinal PIP-kinase. Ca2+-activated polyphosphoinositide phosphodiesterase activity in nerve-ending membranes also was inhibited by propranolol. It is concluded that cationic amphiphilic drugs can inhibit diacylglycerol kinase and the polyphosphoinositide phosphodiesterase and stimulate the phosphatidylinositol-kinase (but not PIP-kinase).", 
    "7": "The release of [3H]5-HT from superfused rat frontal cortex slices was elicited by continuous exposure to either Krebs or Krebs buffer containing excess K+ ions (25 mmol/l). The basal release of [3H]5-HT was augmented by 1 mumol/l of the (+)-isomers of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists alprenolol, oxprenolol and pindolol. Neither the (-)-isomers of these drugs nor (+/-)-atenolol (10 mumol/l), (+/-)-ICI 118551 (0.3 mumol/l) or (+/-)-cyanopindolol (0.008-0.1 mumol/l) increased basal release. At these concentrations, however, the stimulation-evoked overflow was enhanced by (-)-alprenolol, (-)-oxprenolol and (+/-)-cyanopindolol but not by (-)-pindolol. The inhibitory effects of 5-HT at the 5-HT autoreceptor were antagonised by (+/-)-cyanopindolol (pA2 8.32), (-)-alprenolol (6.82), (-)-pindolol (6.66) and (-)-oxprenolol (6.28) whereas the beta 1- and beta 2-selective antagonists, atenolol and ICI 118551 respectively, were inactive. These studies utilising beta-adrenoceptor antagonists have defined a new class of 5-HT autoreceptor antagonists and, in addition, have identified (+/-)-cyanopindolol as the most potent blocker of this receptor thus far identified.", 
    "8": "Beta-adrenoceptor binding characteristics were determined in different fractions of rat kidney tubules using a [125Iodo]-(-)-cyanopindolol (ICYP) binding assay. The highest amount of binding sites was found in a fraction containing predominantly distal tubular fragments. In a separate series of experiments the ICYP binding characteristics were compared in whole tubular fractions from spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) of different ages. The maximum number of binding sites was significantly higher both in young (3 weeks) and adult (14 weeks) SHR when compared to age-matched WKY. These studies showed the presence of beta-adrenoceptor binding sites in rat kidney tubules and support the potential importance of tubular beta-adrenoceptors in the development of spontaneous hypertension and in the mechanism of antihypertensive action of beta-blockers.", 
    "9": "The long-term follow up in 48 patients with unstable angina pectoris was analyzed retrospectively. All patients were hospitalized in a coronary care unit during the acute phase and responded favourably to a medical regimen consisting of nitrates in 45 patients, betablockers in 23, calcium channel blocking agents in 22 and i.v. nitroglycerin in 12. 30 patients (group 1) responded promptly to oral medication with one or a combination of two drugs, whereas in 18 patients a combination of at least three drugs or intravenous nitroglycerin were necessary. After 42 +/- 6 months 21 patients remained asymptomatic, with 8 still on antianginal therapy. In 27 patients (56%) complications had occurred. These complications were severe limiting angina pectoris in 16, of whom 11 were treated surgically after 3.5 +/- 3 months, and myocardial infarction in 11 patients after 16 +/- 9 months, of whom 4 patients died. Complications occurred in 10 of the 30 patients in group 1 and in 16 of the 18 patients in group 2 (33% vs. 89%, p less than 0.01). This study confirms that the long-term course in patients with unstable angina is often complicated by severe angina pectoris or myocardial infarction. The late response to initial therapy and the need for the combination of more than two antianginal drugs or of i.v. medications identifies a subgroup of patients with a high complication rate.", 
    "10": "The contribution of resuscitation before admission to hospital, coronary care units, treatment with beta blockers after myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass surgery, and the treatment of hypertension to the decline in mortality from coronary heart disease in Auckland between 1974 and 1981 was assessed by using data from several population based studies. There were 126 fewer deaths from coronary heart disease in Auckland in 1981 than expected from the 1974 rates among people less than 70 years. The specific medical interventions probably accounted for about 51 (40%) of the 126 fewer deaths. Local data indicate that resuscitation before admission to hospital was responsible for 20 (16%) of the 126 fewer deaths. Projections based on local data and trials carried out overseas suggest that up to 15 (12%) of the 126 fewer deaths were due to the treatment of hypertension. Coronary care units and the use of beta blockers after myocardial infarction were estimated to be responsible for six (5%) and three (2%) of the 126 fewer deaths, respectively. The impact of coronary surgery was especially difficult to determine in the absence of appropriate randomised controlled trial data. Estimates of its contribution ranged from seven to 23 (5% to 18%) of the 126 fewer deaths.", 
    "11": "The effect of total drug concentration on the free fraction was studied in vitro using sera of uremic and nonuremic subjects. Both therapeutic and toxic concentrations of radiolabeled phenytoin, diazepam, and propranolol were used. The free fraction was separated by a pressure ultrafiltration method at 37 degrees C and determined from 200-microliters aliquots of serum and the ultrafiltrate. Sera from 11 acutely uremic and 10 chronically uremic patients and from 10 healthy control subjects were used. Only slight increases in the free fraction were found over the concentration range studied in both nonuremic and uremic subjects. The concentration-dependent increases in the unbound fraction of phenytoin and diazepam were quite negligible compared with the two- to threefold increases caused by uremia itself. Thus, variation in total concentrations of phenytoin, diazepam, and propranolol does not change the free fractions to a clinically significant degree even in uremic patients with a compromised binding capacity.", 
    "12": "The paper is concerned with evidence of the time course of blood sugar, lipoprotein spectrum and some values of the blood coagulation system in patients with CHD on prolonged propranolol therapy in comparison with their natural time course in a similar group of patients with CHD receiving no therapy. Propranolol therapy for 2 yrs. produced no changes in the lipoprotein spectrum and blood fibrinogen. The level of blood sugar on an empty stomach rose 6 and 12 mos after treatment and did not differ from the control one in 24 mos, and the coagulation index significantly exceeded the control one in 24 mos. The results obtained are suggestive of a necessity of control over the level of blood sugar and hemocoagulation during a prolonged and continuous intake of propranolol.", 
    "13": "Some aspects of chronodiagnosis and chronotherapy of cardiovascular diseases were described. To reveal circadian cycles each examined person was observed for 3-5 days, the indices studied being measured every 4 h. The evaluation of a rhythm period was done using the dispersion analysis for the detection of non-sinusiodal rhythms and the approximation method for the detection of sinusoidal rhythms with a preset period (the cosignor analysis) and an unknown period (the least square method combined with the iteration method). Opportunities for the detection of changes or disorders of the time structure of examined function and approaches to chronotherapy were studied on clinical material.", 
    "14": "A simple, sensitive, and rapid fluorometric-high-performance liquid chromatographic method for quantitating human and animal plasma and blood levels of propranolol has been developed. The procedure, which requires microliter volumes of triethylamine in the mobile phase mixture and microliter volumes of plasma or blood (50-100 microL), may be applied in routine clinical analysis as well as in pharmacokinetic studies using small laboratory animals. A single, selective extraction step precedes the analysis. The limiting concentration that can be detected is 1 ng/mL.", 
    "15": "Removal of the pineal gland produces stereotyped tonic convulsions in parathyroidectomized rats. Inasmuch as central levels of norepinephrine (NE) are decreased in these animals, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of alterations in central catecholamine function on convulsions produced by pinealectomy in parathyroidectomized rats. The treatment of rats with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine or FLA-63 produced large reductions in forebrain levels of both NE and dopamine or NE alone, respectively, which were not associated with facilitation of convulsions. However, the incidence of convulsions was increased by FLA-63 in rats pretreated with the catecholamine precursor L-dihydroxyphenylalanine. Reserpine, a monoamine depleter, had no effect on either the incidence or severity of convulsions. An acute injection of desipramine, an inhibitor of the reuptake of NE, however, significantly lowered the incidence of convulsions. Timolol, a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, reduced, in a dose-dependent manner, the average latency to onset of convulsions and increased the average number of convulsions each rat experienced. Clonidine, an alpha 2-adrenergic agonist, did not significantly alter convulsions. Thus presynaptic mechanisms such as synthesis and storage of both NE and DA appear to have little, if any, effect on pinealectomy-induced convulsions, whereas enhancing synaptic levels of NE by blocking its reuptake into adrenergic axons had an anticonvulsant effect. Further evidence suggesting a role for NE in modulating these convulsions is provided by the proconvulsant effect of blocking central beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "16": "A possible interaction of penbutolol and cimetidine was investigated in healthy volunteers treated orally for 7 days. The plasma levels of unmetabolized penbutolol showed a slight but non-significant increase. The biphasic elimination kinetics of penbutolol (half-lives 0.8 and 17 h) was not affected by coadministration of cimetidine. Plasma levels of penbutolol were not significantly altered by chronic treatment with cimetidine, whereas the levels of 4-hydroxypenbutolol and 4-hydroxypenbutolol glucuronide were significantly reduced.", 
    "17": "Many tests for measuring compliance have been proposed, but in most cases compliance rates have been determined without taking into account the factors influencing the interval during which a drug can be detected by a qualitative test after having been taken by the patient. The drug half-life, often used for determining the time at which the sample is collected, is inadequate for obtaining conclusive test results. A procedure is described for the determination of urine collection intervals during which reliable information on compliance can be obtained, using oxprenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, and pindolol as examples.", 
    "18": "The effects of sotalol, aprindine and the combination aprindine-sotalol in the intact dog heart were evaluated during constant atrial pacing with the use of monophasic action potential (MAP) recording. A first group of five dogs was given 1.5 mg kg-1 body weight of sotalol, followed by a second infusion of 1.5 mg kg-1 30 min later. Both doses of sotalol produced a statistically significant increase in right atrial MAP duration at 50% of repolarization (RAMAP50) and right ventricular MAP duration at 90% of repolarization (RVMAP90). To a second group of six dogs aprindine 1 mg kg-1 and aprindine 2 mg kg-1 were administered intravenously. The infusion of aprindine did not alter right atrial and right ventricular MAP duration. The addition of 1.5 mg kg-1 of sotalol to the dogs pretreated with aprindine 2 mg kg-1 resulted in a 25% increase in RAMAP50 and a 21% prolongation of RVMAP90. In summary, sotalol lengthens atrial and ventricular monophasic action potential duration and still prolongs repolarization of monophasic action potentials after previous administration of aprindine. A combination of sotalol, a beta-adrenergic blocker possessing class III efficacy, with a class I antiarrhythmic agent may be useful with respect to their electro-physiological action.", 
    "19": "The effects of pindolol treatment on mean heart rate (MHR) and the number of paced heart beats were investigated in a group of 12 patients, with frequency programmable pacemakers implanted to control symptomatic bradyarrhythmias resulting from sinus node dysfunction. In a randomized double blind cross over experiment the patients were treated with pindolol (5 mg t.i.d.) or with placebo. Before the study the pacemaker was programmed to its lowest frequency in the demand mode. In the pretreatment period and after 2 weeks treatment with either pindolol or placebo a 24-hour ambulatory ECG was recorded. MHR during the night (24.00-8.00) was slightly but significantly increased by pindolol treatment by 6.0% when compared to placebo (P less than 0.05). There was no difference in the daytime MHR during either treatment period. During pindolol treatment the number of paced beats was reduced in 8/12 patients and in 4 of these the reduction exceeded 98%. In 2 patients the number of paced beats increased. The results indicate that in some patients with sinus node dysfunction pindolol can effectively reduce the number of paced beats thereby preserving the atrial contribution to pump function.", 
    "20": "In order to examine a potential interaction between isoxicam and propranolol, single 200 mg doses of isoxicam were administered to ten healthy male volunteers before and during treatment with propranolol, gradually attaining a dose of 80 mg t.i.d. for 11 days. The pharmacokinetic profiles of the isoxicam plasma concentration/time data obtained over 96 h following the doses of isoxicam before and during propranolol administration were compared. No significant change was found in any of the pharmacokinetic parameters determined. These results suggest that propranolol has no effect on the metabolic disposition of isoxicam.", 
    "21": "The pharmacokinetics of prenalterol in healthy young volunteers after i.v. and oral dosing has been studied. There is evidence of non-linearity following the i.v. dosing. Evidence of dose-dependent pharmacokinetics following i.v. dosing has been obtained. The sustained-release formulation is very effective: almost 12 h were needed to achieve 50 per cent of the total AUC.", 
    "22": "The ulcerogenic effect of five different salts of alprenolol were tested against placebo in a porcine oesophageal test model. The salts with high water solubility, such as the hydrochloride and the fumarate, gave rise to the highest plasma concentrations of alprenolol and evoked serious oesophageal lesions, while the salts with low solubility-the benzoate, maleate and sebacate-had no irritative effect on the oesophagus. The plasma levels of alprenolol were much higher following administration of alprenolol hydrochloride in the oesophagus than after an identical intraduodenal dose of the same salt possibly because of the avoidance of the first-pass degradation during oesophageal absorption.", 
    "23": "The immediate haemodynamic and electrophysiologic effects of intravenous prenalterol 2.5-75 micrograms/kg in patients with coronary heart disease without clinical heart failure were investigated during fixed rate atrial pacing. Right ventricular peak dP/dt increased pronounced and serum concentration dependent after prenalterol concomitant with an increase in stroke volume and a moderate decrease in peripheral vascular resistance. The effects on haemodynamics after prenalterol were thus serum concentration dependent but with marked interindividual variation. AV nodal conduction velocity increased significantly. It is concluded that prenalterol possess pronounced inotropic properties. The haemodynamic response to prenalterol intravenously is to a lesser degree dependent on the chronotropic effects of the drug and it is often unpredictable.", 
    "24": "Two out of three normal eyes tested with frequent instillation of 30 microliters of drops of 0.5% bupranolol, a beta 1 + beta 2 blocking drug with some intrinsic sympathomimetic and local anesthetic activity, showed a miotic effect of the order of a 25% reduction of pupil area, as estimated by an open-loop iris-videorecorder. A slight contralateral effect was also observed. Blocking by the drug of tonic inhibitory beta-adrenergic activity on the sphincter muscle of the pupil is postulated.", 
    "25": "The transition temperature of phosphatidylglycerol (PG) was reduced to lower temperatures in presence of propranolol, imipramine, amitriptyline and chlorpromazine. This effect was dependent on drug concentration and was smallest with propranolol. The fluidizing effect, however, increased from propranolol to chlorpromazine according to the octanol/H2O partition coefficients. When the two phospholipids PG and phosphatidylcholine (PC) were compared, the presence of drug lead to a more pronounced reduction of the transition temperature in the case of the acidic phospholipid than in the case of the neutral one.", 
    "26": "Recent evidence has linked alpha-receptor and beta-receptor activations with ventricular arrhythmia genesis. In order to assess the relative contribution of specific adrenoceptors (alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 1) on ventricular arrhythmogenic activity during xylazine (1.1 mg X kg-1 X hr-1)-halothane (1.35%) anesthesia, the arrhythmogenic dose of epinephrine (ADE) was repeatedly determined before and after prazosin (alpha 1 antagonist; 0.1 mg X kg-1), metoprolol (beta 1 antagonist; 0.5 mg X kg-1), and yohimbine (alpha 2 antagonist; 0.125 mg X kg-1) administration in 6 dogs. The ADE was expressed as infusion rate and total dose. The ADE was defined as the dose which produced 4 or more intermittent premature ventricular contractions within 15 s during a 3-minute infusion period or within 1 minute from end of infusion. Control ADE was 2.69 +/- 0.372 (micrograms X kg-1 X min-1) and 4.17 +/- 0.544 (micrograms X kg X -1) for infusion rate and total dose, respectively. The ADE significantly increased after prazosin (P less than 0.005), metoprolol (P less than 0.005), and yohimbine (P less than 0.05) administration. The ADE values increased to 5.42 +/- 1.22 (rate) and 8.10 +/- 1.95 (dose) after alpha 2 blockade, but were significantly less than the alpha 1 and beta 1 blockade ADE values. In conclusion, although both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockade depressed ventricular arrhythmia genesis in xylazine-halothane-anesthetized dogs, alpha 2 blockade, which was achieved with the recommended dose of yohimbine for reversal of anesthetic-induced CNS depression, was not as protective as alpha 1 (prazosin) or beta 1 (metoprolol) blockade.", 
    "27": "In the search for any deleterious hemodynamic effects of the acute administration of intravenous diltiazem (0.25 mg/kg), in patients on beta blockers, studies were performed in two comparable groups of eight patients with chronic coronary heart disease without clinical signs of heart failure. In the first group, with no previous treatment, the only significant variations observed were a decrease in systemic vascular resistance (p less than 0.01) and an increase in cardiac index (p less than 0.01), which were noted only at 5 minutes. In the second group, receiving long-term oral doses of 120 to 240 mg/day of propranolol, at 5 minutes, despite a slight decrease in peak positive first derivative of left ventricular pressure (p less than 0.05), cardiac index and systolic index increased (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01) with decreases in systemic vascular resistance (p less than 0.01) and mean blood pressure (p less than 0.05); at 15 minutes, systemic vascular resistance was still decreased (p less than 0.05) and cardiac index and systolic index were still increased (p less than 0.05). In conclusion, intravenous administration of diltiazem (0.25 mg/kg) to patients with chronic coronary heart disease and no evidence of congestive heart failure, who were receiving propranolol, was safe and prevented, in these patients, the potential deleterious effects of beta blockers, that is, increased peripheral vascular resistance and decreased cardiac output.", 
    "28": "Adrenergic antagonists were administered to rats by intratesticular injection at the time of unilateral orchidectomy and 5 h before autopsy, 24 h after surgery. Injections of the beta-receptor antagonist DL-propranolol (0.5 or 1.0 mg/injection) significantly inhibited the increase in the concentration of androgens in testicular vein plasma or interstitial fluid that occurred in unilaterally orchidectomized animals injected with vehicle. DL-Propranolol injections in animals with both testes did not reduce testicular or peripheral androgen concentrations or their increase after hCG administration. Injections of the less potent isomer (+)-propranolol or the alpha-receptor antagonist phentolamine did not inhibit the response to unilateral orchidectomy. It is concluded that the compensatory increase in androgen secretion induced by unilateral orchidectomy is, at least in part, the result of beta-adrenergic stimulation of steroidogenesis.", 
    "29": "The addition of acetylcholine or histamine (10(-7) to 10(-4) M), gamma-aminobutyric acid, a dopamine agonist, and melatonin (10(-7) to 10(-5) M) did not alter basal or LH-stimulated progesterone production (P greater than 0.05). The addition of the specific beta 2-adrenergic agonist terbutaline and salbutamol did not significantly elevate progesterone production. Treatment of luteal cells with serotonin (5-HT), 10(-6) to 10(-4) M, increased the production of progesterone (P less than 0.05). This stimulated production was inhibited by the addition of mianserin (10(-5) M, a 5-HT antagonist; P less than 0.05). Isoproterenol (10(-7) to 10(-4) M) also resulted in significant increases in progesterone production (P less than 0.05). The combined treatments of 5-HT + LH, isoproterenol + LH, or isoproterenol + 5-HT did not result in a further increase in progesterone above that observed in response to LH or isoproterenol alone (P greater than 0.05). The isoproterenol-induced progesterone production could not be blocked by butoxamine (10(-5) M, a beta 2-antagonist), or practolol (10(-5) M, a beta 1-antagonist), but was inhibited by propranolol (10(-5) M, a general beta-antagonist; P less than 0.05). The response to isoproterenol was unaffected by mianserin (10(-5) M). These results demonstrate a possible role for 5-HT in the regulation of steroidogenesis by the corpus luteum of the cow. Furthermore, these results suggest that serotonin-induced progesterone production is a receptor-mediated event.", 
    "30": "The influence of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade on the impulse activity of 21 cardiovascular sympathetic afferent nerve fibers (11 from the thoracic aorta, 10 from the pulmonary veins), isolated from the left sympathetic rami communicantes T-3 and T-4 was studied in anesthetized, vagotomized cats. Aortic pressure, heart rate, and neural discharge were recorded during control conditions and during brief aortic occlusions of comparable amplitude and duration. Administration of dl-propranolol (0.2-0-4 mg/kg) did not modify aortic pressure or neural discharge of the fibers during control conditions, although, as expected, heart rate was diminished. dl-Propranolol administration did change the response of cardiovascular sympathetic afferents to similar aortic pressure increases. Before drug administration, aortic occlusion caused a significant increase in neural discharge of both aortic and pulmonary vein sympathetic afferent fibers, from 0.52 +/- 0.12 to 1.64 +/- 0.31 and from 0.67 +/- 0.10 to 2.08 +/- 0.25 impulses/sec, respectively (p less than 0.05). After dl-propranolol administration, comparable increases in aortic pressure resulted in slight but not significant increases in neural discharge of aortic and pulmonary vein fibers. Administration of d-propranolol (0.4-0.6 mg/kg), which possesses only membrane-stabilizing properties, did not modify the firing rate of four pulmonary sympathetic afferents, which subsequently decreased their response to pressure rises after administration of dl-propranolol. These results indicate that beta-adrenergic receptor blockade reduces the responsiveness to hemodynamic stimuli of sympathetic cardiovascular afferent fibers that are capable of mediating excitatory pressor reflexes.", 
    "31": "The present study was designed to investigate the effect of propranolol on portal pressure of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and portal hypertension and to correlate these effects with clinical and laboratory parameters. The mean baseline hepatic venous pressure gradient in the 50 patients studied was of 18.2 +/- 4.1 mm Hg. It decreased significantly 2 hr after the oral administration of 40 mg of propranolol to 15.7 +/- 4.2 mm Hg (a mean reduction of 13.4 +/- 17%). This reduction in hepatic venous pressure gradient resulted mainly from a decrease in mean wedged hepatic venous pressure. There was no correlation between the decrease in hepatic venous pressure gradient and the decrease in heart rate. When results were analyzed individually, only 15 (30%) showed a large decrease in hepatic venous pressure gradient (greater than 20%), 15 (30%) showed a moderate decrease (10 to 19%), and in 20 patients (40%) there was no reduction or an increase in hepatic venous pressure gradient. Comparison of \"responders\" (those that reduced hepatic venous pressure gradient greater than 10%) and \"nonresponders\" (hepatic venous pressure gradient reduction less than 10%) showed no significant differences in baseline laboratory and hemodynamic parameters, in the severity of the liver disease, in the heart rate and blood pressure response to propranolol, nor in the propranolol plasma levels achieved 2 hr after propranolol administration. Propranolol plasma levels correlated with the reduction in heart rate but not with the reduction in hepatic venous pressure gradient. Of 14 nonresponders to 40 mg of propranolol who received additional doses, six showed a reduction in hepatic venous pressure gradient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "32": "The effects on standing heart rate and respiratory function of two relatively selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonists, metoprolol and bevantolol, were compared in a double-blind, randomized, crossover study of 16 patients with asthma. After control observations on 2 separate days, the patients received approximately equivalent cardiac beta-adrenoceptor antagonist doses of metoprolol, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 mg, and bevantolol, 18.75, 37.5, 75 and 150 mg, at intervals of 2 hours. Dosing was stopped if symptoms warranted or if there was a fall of greater than or equal to 20% in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second. In general, the cumulative dosing regimen proved a safe and effective means of assessing bronchial responsiveness to these beta-blockers in asthma, but one patient had to be dropped from the study because of severe bronchoconstriction after the first dose. Of the 15 patients studied who were taking both drugs, seven patients were withdrawn prematurely. In these seven patients, the average maximum tolerated cumulative doses were 45.5 mg bevantolol and 26.8 mg metoprolol, doses that are much lower than those usually required for therapeutic activity. The respiratory response to either drug could not be predicted.", 
    "33": "The in vitro binding and distribution of drugs to human serum and rat liver cytosol was examined in a three-compartment distribution dialysis system where the free drug concentration could be determined. The effects of high concentrations of volatile anaesthetics and their metabolites on distribution and binding were also investigated. Restrictively eliminated drugs (warfarin, phenytoin, diazepam) distributed more slowly and demonstrated lower cytosol:serum binding ratios (0.09, 0.11 and 0.11, respectively) as compared with the non-restrictively eliminated drugs propranolol and prazosin with distribution ratios of 0.62 and 1.1, respectively. The rapid distribution in favour of liver cytosol may partly explain the high hepatic extraction ratio of non-restrictively eliminated drugs in vivo. Enflurane showed the most significant influence on drug binding as it was the only compound to displace propranolol and prazosin from serum. Furthermore, enflurane displaced phenytoin and diazepam from both serum and cytosol simultaneously, creating marked increases in the free drug concentrations of 60 and 113%, respectively. Halothane was shown to be a weaker agent than enflurane with respect to the ability to displace drugs from serum proteins and liver cytosol. Neither enflurane nor halothane influenced significantly the binding or distribution of warfarin. In contrast, trifluoroacetic acid did not displace any drugs from cytosol, but displaced restrictively eliminated drugs from serum. It is suggested that the ability of enflurane to displace specific drugs from both serum proteins and liver cytosol may be of clinical relevance.", 
    "34": "The effect of doses of propranolol hydrochloride, 80 to 800 mg/day, was investigated in 15 patients with essential tremor. The dose was increased by 80 mg weekly. Tremor was recorded by an accelerometer and its amplitude and frequency was determined by spectral analysis. Serum propranolol level was measured by radioreceptor assay. Tremor control varied greatly from complete suppression at 80 mg/day to no reduction at 800 mg/day. Mean serum propranolol levels increased with increasing dosage, but they did not correlate with tremor suppression. Five patients did not tolerate doses higher than 640 mg/day. Maximum tremor suppression occurred within a dose range between 160 and 320 mg/day. Higher doses did not cause additional tremor reduction.", 
    "35": "In muscularis mucosae from the opossum distal colon, both tone and spontaneous contractions were highly dependent on the available oxygen. Acetylcholine and histamine caused, respectively, atropine- and pyrilamine-sensitive contractions. Norepinephrine relaxed the tissue, an effect abolished by propranolol. Under these conditions norepinephrine failed to elicit contractions and at higher concentrations again caused relaxations. The tissue gave concentration-dependent relaxations to ATP but not to ADP, AMP, or adenosine. Electrical field stimulation (20-30 Hz, 1-2 ms, 120 mA) revealed a cholinergic excitatory innervation and a nonadrenergic, noncholinergic neural inhibition. Cholecystokinin, gastrin, substance P, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide were without effect on this tissue. In these respects, colonic muscularis mucosae differs considerably from that of other gastrointestinal viscera.", 
    "36": "A case of thyrotoxic periodic paralysis is reported in a Hispanic man with an unusual recurrence six weeks after radioactive iodine treatment. Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis has now been well characterized in the literature: it occurs primarily in Orientals with an overwhelming male preponderance and a higher association of specific HLA antigens. Clinical manifestations include onset after high carbohydrate ingestion or heavy exertion, with progressive symmetric weakness leading to flaccid paralysis of the extremities and other muscle groups, lasting several hours. If hypokalemia is present, potassium administration may help abort the attack. Although propranolol can be efficacious in preventing further episodes, the only definitive treatment is establishing a euthyroid state. The pathophysiology is still controversial, but reflects altered potassium and calcium dynamics as well as certain morphologic characteristics within the muscle unit itself.", 
    "37": "Migraine is among the most common disorders seen in office practice. Some epidemiologists believe it may occur in up to 25 percent of the general population. Pharmacologic treatment and behavior therapy, as well as a stable physician-patient relationship, are important factors in reducing the frequency and severity of recurrent head pain. Benefits of migraine therapy include improvements in the patient's overall health and sense of well-being.", 
    "38": "Primidone, 50 to 1,000 mg/d, reduced the amplitude of essential tremor in both untreated and propranolol-treated patients. Low doses were as effective as high doses. Primidone decreased tremor more than propranolol. There was no correlation between therapeutic response and serum levels. Acute reactions to the initial dose and side effects of higher doses caused drug intolerance. A single oral dose (250 mg) decreased tremor by 60% 1 to 7 hours after ingestion, with stable serum primidone levels but no detectable phenobarbital levels. Tremor control was lost when phenobarbital was substituted for primidone. Primidone is an effective agent for the treatment of essential tremor.", 
    "39": "Dl-sotalol is a specific beta-adrenergic blocking agent that markedly lengthens cardiac action potential duration. To determine whether d-sotalol, with little or no beta-blocking effect, also lengthens repolarization, standard microelectrode studies were used to determine the electrophysiologic properties of dl-sotalol and its stereoisomers in isolated rabbit and canine myocardial fibers. D- and l-sotalol produced concentration-dependent increases in action potential duration to 50% (APD50) and 90% (APD90) repolarization, respectively, and in the effective refractory period without changes in the maximal rate of rise of action potential. In rabbit sinoatrial node, d- and l-sotalol produced concentration-dependent increases in spontaneous sinus cycle length (29 and 35%, respectively) by lengthening the action potential duration (by 58 and 55%) without effect on phase 4 depolarization. At the highest concentration (27.2 micrograms/ml), d- and l-sotalol prolonged APD90 (by 38 and 54%, respectively, in Purkinje fibers and by 32 and 34% in ventricular muscle) and effective refractory period (by 49 and 49% in Purkinje fibers and 29 and 40% in ventricular muscle). The effects of the two isomers were not significantly different. At the middle concentration (2.7 micrograms/ml), d-sotalol, unlike l-sotalol, had no beta-adrenergic blocking effect, but the electrophysiologic effects of dl-, d- and l-sotalol were indistinguishable. The data indicate that d-sotalol is equipotent with l-sotalol in lengthening the action potential duration and effective refractory period in cardiac muscle, an action unrelated to adrenergic antagonism or pharmacokinetic differences between the stereoisomers.", 
    "40": "After 20% total body surface scalding inducing 3d degree burn in rats the following parameters were studied in ebb and flow phases, as well as in burn disease, 2 hours, 2 and 7 days postburn: atomic absorption spectrophotometric study of the serum and myocardial Ni levels; the effect of Ni ions (10(-8)-10(-4) M/l) in vitro on total coronary resistance in the isolated perfused rat heart; the effect of alpha and beta adrenergic blocking agents (phenoxibenzamine, oxprenolol) on Ni-induced coronary vasoconstriction; electron cytochemical study of the ultrastructural changes of the myocardium 7 days after scalding. It was found that: During the first 2-3 hours after scalding or bleeding there was a significant elevation of serum Ni level which levelled off by the end of the first week. Total coronary resistance (TCR) increasing effect of Ni ions was significantly augmented during the first 2-3 hours after burn and bleeding (ebb phase). In the scalded group it decreased to the control value by the 2-3d day (flow phase) and increased again a week later (burn disease). In the scalded groups in vivo pretreatment with oxprenolol (10(-4) g/kg) completely inhibited the Ni induced coronary spasm. PBZ treatment in vitro (10(-5) M/l) had similar effect in the three postburn periods tested. Ultrastructural changes and intracellular Ni-dimetilglyoxim complexes could be detected. Oxprenolol treatment continuously applied from the 4th day postburn (2 X 0.5 mg/kg) prevented the development of myocardial damage, while the electron dense complexes containing Ni were still detectable. In view of our previous data we assume that the endogenous Ni increase in the serum after burn may be cardiopathogenic. The phasic changes of the sensitivity of the coronary vessels to Ni ion and the similarity of the effects of alpha and beta adrenergic blocking agents may be explained by the alterations in the neuroendocrine system and metabolic disturbances.", 
    "41": "The analysis of sotalol by a simple and sensitive liquid chromatographic assay is described. Sample preparation involves an extraction by chloroform and isoamyl alcohol (3:1, vol/vol) at pH 9.0 followed by back extraction into 0.05 M sulfuric acid. Analyses are carried out on a reversed-phase chromatographic system using an octadecylsilane stationary phase and a water-methanol-acetic acid-methanesulfonic acid (91.00:8.50:0.50:0.025, vol/vol/vol/vol) mobile phase adjusted at pH 3.3. Sotalol is quantified on the basis of ultraviolet absorption at 235 nm. The precision of the method ranged from 6.3% at 0.16 microM (50 ng/ml) to 3.3% at 5.18 microM (1,600 ng/ml). The limit of quantification was established 0.08 microM (25 ng/ml). This assay provides a suitable method for pharmacokinetic studies.", 
    "42": "A study of the effect of propranolol on the central hemodynamics using the polycardiographic method in 90 patients with essential hypertension showed that in 83% of them, disregarding the type of hemodynamics, beta-blocker made a negative chronotropic effect, and in 17% of the patients it increased the heart rate. In the patients with the hyperkinetic circulation the negative inotropic effect of propranolol was noted in 42% of the cases, and in the patients with the eu- and hypokinetic circulation 37.5%. However, the improvement of myocardial contractility expressed in an increase in the cardiac and stroke blood volume, the stroke and cardiac indices, and a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance were found in 24.4% of the total number of patients.", 
    "43": "The effect of propranolol on the baroreceptor reflex and the main indices of the central hemodynamics in single (i. v.) and prolonged (per os) administration of the drug were studied in patients with essential hypertension. The hemodynamic effect of propranolol depended, to a large extent, on the initial value of the baroreflex and its time course during treatment. Possible mechanisms of the effect of propranolol on the baroreflex were discussed.", 
    "44": "Acute granulomatous interstitial nephritis and acute granulomatous hepatitis were simultaneously observed in the same patient. Clinical and anamnestic arguments suggest that allopurinol could be responsible for this double localization, but a possible part played by furosemide cannot be excluded. The patient spontaneously recovered without corticosteroid therapy. Such an acute drug induced association did not have been proved so far.", 
    "45": "Iodinated bivalent ligands 3 and 4 and a monovalent ligand 5 were prepared from the cardioselective beta-antagonist, practolol. 125I-labeled 3, 4 and 5 were prepared by solid phase isotopic exchange reaction with carrier-free Na125I and examined in rats as potential receptor-site-directed myocardial imaging agents. Biodistribution of these agents in rats indicated that 125I-3 and 125I-4 were localized in the heart similarly to 125I-5 and the [125I]iodobenzoyl (6) that was previously reported. Localization of 125I-3 and 125I-4, was more persistent in the heart than that of 125I-monovalent ligands 5 and 6. Heart-to-blood ratios of 125I-3 and 125I-4 were significantly lower than those of 125I-5 and 125I-6, due mainly to slow blood clearance rates of 125I-3 and 125I-4.", 
    "46": "Seven healthy subjects immersed a hand in random order in either warm water or in cold water at 5 degrees C for 2 min, after taking orally a single dose of 120 mg of propranolol or a placebo in a double blind fashion. The cold stress resulted in a significant increase in blood pressure and the rate pressure product without a change in heart rate. Beta-adrenoceptor blockade did not affect the pressor response the cold. The changes induced by the cold stress in the cardiovascular variables in the placebo and propranolol experiments were not statistically different. The highest rate pressure product during the cold pressor test was about 109 units. This was well below the pain threshold value of about 200 found during exercise in patients with ischaemic heart disease. In the recovery phase, the cardiovascular variables reverted to pre-immersion values within 1 min inspite of continued low hand skin temperature.", 
    "47": "We used standard microelectrode techniques to investigate the developmental changes in the effects of the beta-blocker propranolol on canine Purkinje fibers. The effects of propranolol on the transmembrane action potential were similar in neonatal and adult Purkinje fibers. In automatic Purkinje fibers we obtained concentration-response (increase in rate) curves for isoproterenol alone and with an increasing concentration of propranolol. The curve for isoproterenol in neonatal Purkinje fibers had an EC50 of 1.0 X 10(-9) M, about 5-fold lower than in adult Purkinje fibers (EC50 = 5.03 X 10(-9) M, p less than 0.05). At both ages, propranolol caused a parallel, concentration-dependent shift of the response curves for isoproterenol, with no change in the maximum effect. Equiactive dose ratios in presence and absence of 3 concentrations of propranolol were compared by the Schild plot. The pA2 values for adult and neonate Purkinje fibers were 8.32 (8.14-8.46; 95% confidence level) and 8.86 (8.69-9.03; 95% confidence level), respectively. Our results indicate significant (p less than 0.05) developmental changes in the beta-blocking effects of propranolol in canine Purkinje fibers.", 
    "48": "The effect of propranolol on protein synthesis by polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes was assessed in subjects from four age categories: elderly individuals, grown-up children, small children and newborn babies. This function was inhibited in PMN cells from individuals of all age groups, but inversely proportional to the age of the individual, i.e. the younger the subject, the more inhibited was the protein synthesis by his PMN leukocytes. The phagocytic capacity of the PMN cells of elderly subjects was decreased in comparison with that of individuals from the younger age groups. Propranolol inhibited this cell function in cells from subjects of all categories, although the inhibition was more pronounced in the cells of the younger groups. The difference in the degree of inhibition of the cell function observed in the various age groups may indicate different functional properties of the cell membrane.", 
    "49": "Self-poisoning with beta-blockers is uncommon but often life-threatening. A 59 year old man was admitted to the ICU after having ingested an estimated dose of 2 g of oxprenolol. Circulatory collapse occurred without pre-existing cardiac failure. Right ventricular haemodynamic data showed adiastole which responded to massive doses of isoprenaline and dopamine. Subsequently the patient recovered normal haemodynamic parameters. This report suggests that right ventricular dysfunction may complicate beta-blocker overdose.", 
    "50": "Although it is essential that intraocular pressure (IOP) be reduced in glaucoma treatment, it is also vitally important to provide sufficient blood flow to eye tissues so that healthy visual field is maintained. It is possible for an agent to reduce IOP and blood supply to the eye. In that case, glaucoma appears to be under control since IOP has been reduced to within normal range, yet the disease is actually progressing, causing damage to the retina, optic nerve, and other tissues. The 85Sr-microsphere technique was used to study the effects of several antiglaucoma drugs on blood supply to various eye tissues. It was found that pilocarpine, L-timolol, D-timolol and haloperidol are good drugs to use in treating glaucoma because they do not reduce ocular blood flow. D-timolol is particularly good because it does not cause side effects through beta-adrenergic blockade or cholinergic stimulation. On the other hand, trifluperidol and moperone reduce IOP effectively, but also decrease blood supply.", 
    "51": "In the prophylaxis of migraine beta-blockers are commonly used. In the therapy of tension headache (TH) the use of tricyclic antidepressives is widespread. Therefore, from a rational point of view, one should combine an antidepressive and a beta-blocker in the treatment of combination headache (CH), in which patients have both migraine and TH. In an open uncontrolled study, 61 patients with CH received a combination of an antidepressive (amitriptyline) or amitriptyline-N-oxide and a beta-blocker (propranolol or metoprolol) for at least 3 months. The 61 patients kept a diary in which they recorded frequency and duration of migraine attacks and tension headaches. The median migraine attack frequency decreased in the 3 months from four to two and the mean attack duration per month from 2 to 0.7 days. TH frequency was reduced from a median of 21 days to 6 days; TH duration fell from a median of 21 days to 2.7 days. At first sight, this treatment appears to be highly effective, at least when judged by the results at the group level. Nevertheless, in an open uncontrolled study like this, one must be aware of many problems, which are discussed in detail.", 
    "52": "There is a wide variability in the measured O2 saturations (SvO2) of small myocardial veins (20-100 microns). The purpose of the present study was to examine several factors that contributed to this variability. Studies were conducted on anesthetized open-chest dogs. The role of beta-adrenoceptors and flow in the control of the heterogeneity of SvO2 was assessed. The hearts were quick-frozen in liquid N2 and the SvO2 in the subepicardial and subendocardial (ENDO) regions of the left ventricule was determined by microspectrophotometry. Under control conditions, ENDO SvO2 averaged 35% with a variance of 337. The control variance was much more than that of the methodological errors. With propranolol or practolol, variance was reduced by about half, e.g. ENDO SvO2 variance was 145 with propranolol. This reduction in SvO2 variance could be prevented by isoproterenol. When flow is reduced by partial occlusion the SvO2 values were skewed toward lower saturations. When nitroglycerin is administered during this partial occlusion, the SvO2 distribution is restored toward normal. It can be concluded that some of the variability of SvO2 in the heart is control by beta 1-adrenoceptors. There also appears to be an inverse relationship between coronary blood flow and SvO2 heterogeneity. Further work is necessary to determine what other factors control the variability of SvO2.", 
    "53": "72 male and 72 female rats of the strain Can-Hoe-Wiga received standard diet in a long-term study (24 months). A group of equal size received the beta-blocker BM 51.052 administered at a dose of 900 ppm in the feed. The animals in the drug group showed a 20 to 30% delay in body weight gain in comparison with the control animals. These drug-treated animals showed, similarly to experiments with a restrictive diet, a lower death rate, fewer glomerulopathies, and lower creatinine and protein levels in the serum. In addition, there were fewer tumour bearers, the total number of tumours was less, and the malignancy and formation of metastases was reduced. This experiment shows the importance which should be attached to the course of body weight gain during a long-term study. Only if these parameters are taken into consideration, an interpretation of the experimental results is possible.", 
    "54": "The pharmacokinetics of propranolol after oral and intravenous administration was studied at rest and on an exercise day in 8 healthy subjects. On the exercise day the subjects performed physical exercise for 7 h, consisting of bicycle ergometer exercise at 50% of maximal work capacity and outdoor walking. Propranolol (80 mg p.o., or 0.2 mg/kg body weight i.v.) was administered 30 min before the start of the exercise. After oral administration the terminal phase halflife, (t1/2 beta) and area under the curve (AUC) were both significantly reduced on the exercise day compared to the rest day. The bioavailability of propranolol was reduced by prolonged physical exercise and plasma levels of propranolol were about 30% lower at the end of the exercise day than at the end of the rest day. After intravenous administration, t1/2 beta was also reduced on the exercise day as compared to the rest day. AUC, clearance and volume of distribution did not differ on the two days. On the other hand, indocyanine green (ICG) clearance was significantly reduced during the bicycle ergometry periods on the exercise day. The combination of reduced ICG clearance, suggesting a reduction in hepatic blood flow, and a decreased t1/2 beta and unchanged clearance of propranolol on the exercise day was unexpected.", 
    "55": "A combined i.v. and oral dosage regimen of metoprolol early in acute myocardial infarction has been evaluated. Metoprolol 15 mg i.v. in three divided doses followed by 200 mg orally in divided doses was administered to 20 patients. The median delay from onset of pain to start of treatment was 7.5 h. Following the i.v. dose absorption of the first oral dose was prolonged in several patients, but the plasma metoprolol concentration rapidly stabilized at a mean of about 200 nmol/l. A significant correlation was found between the change in resting heart rate and the plasma concentration of metoprolol 15 min after the start of treatment. Blood pressure was not correlated with metoprolol concentration. Nine patients were restudied after 16-19 days of chronic therapy. The time to maximal plasma concentration of metoprolol on chronic treatment was reduced compared to that observed after the first oral dose. The median minimum plasma concentration during steady state averaged around 200 nmol/l and was comparable to the mean trough levels 24 and 48 h after the start of therapy. In the majority of patients, the dosage regimen rapidly produced and maintained plasma levels of metoprolol which should induce a significant degree of beta-blockade.", 
    "56": "A survey was conducted to compare the safety and effectiveness of labetalol and propranolol under routine conditions of clinical use. Patients received either labetalol (n = 805) or propranolol (n = 135) twice daily, according to package insert instructions, for six weeks. Every two weeks the patients were evaluated and weight, heart rate, blood pressure, dose, and adverse symptoms were recorded. Both treatment groups experienced a significant decline in blood pressure at six weeks; blood pressure decreased by 24/15 mmHg in the labetalol patients and by 20/14 mmHg in the propranolol patients. Heart rate decreased significantly in both groups, but the drop in the propranolol group was greater than in the labetalol group. Significantly more propranolol-treated patients reported fatigue (15.2% versus 6.3%), impotence (9.0% versus 3.2%), bad dreams (2.3% versus 0.3%), and cold extremities (2.3% versus 0%). Dizziness was reported more frequently by the labetalol group (9.1% versus 3.8%). Overall, both drugs were safe and effective in treating hypertension, but complaints of beta-blocker-associated side effects were more frequent with propranolol.", 
    "57": "Using two balloon-tipped flotation catheters introduced through the jugular vein, systemic and hepatic hemodynamic measurements were made in nine cirrhotic patients before and 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes after intravenous injection of 1.5 mg/kg of sotalol. At 30 minutes, the occluded sus-hepatic pressure fell from 23.6 +/- 6.4 mm Hg to 16.7 +/- 5.7 mm Hg (P less than 0.025); the sus-hepatic pressure gradient decreased from 16.2 +/- 3.8 mm Hg to 8.1 +/- 2.7 mm Hg (P less than 0.0005) whereas cardiac output failed to show any significant change (6.8 +/- 2.4 l/minute prior to drug versus 5.7 +/- 2.1 l/minute). These results suggest that sotalol, a non selective beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug with weaker negative inotropic effects than propranolol is effective in lowering portal pressure. The decrease of the sus-hepatic pressure gradient induced by the dose we used (50.2 +/- 20.0%) is statistically greater than that observed by Westaby et al. with intravenous propranolol (31.0 +/- 8.2%). The absence of hepatic metabolism of the drug which is excreted untransformed by the kidney should facilitate the selection of the optimal oral dose. The rather long half-life should also allow administration of one single daily dose which improves patients' compliance. The long term oral efficacy remains to be demonstrated in further studies, but in view of the advantages that sotalol possesses over propranolol, these studies are deemed justified.", 
    "58": "Investigations were performed in a modified heart-lung preparation of the rat in situ to ascertain to what extent the myosin isoenzyme pattern affects the catecholamine-induced increase in myocardial oxygen consumption. Accordingly, the myocardial oxygen consumption was measured in young Wistar rats with mostly VM-1 myosin and older spontaneously hypertensive rats with mostly VM-3 myosin, both under control conditions and after 0.05 mg/kg orciprenaline. In the controls (73.7 +/- 3.35% VM-1) the oxygen consumption related to TTI increased from 0.098 +/- 0.003 to 0.129 +/- 0.004 microM O2/g X beat under orciprenaline (+32%, p less than 0.005). In the SHR (27.8 +/- 0.58% VM-1) there was no significant increase in O2-consumption related to TTI (control conditions 0.093 +/- 0.003; orciprenaline 0.095 +/- 0.004 microM O2/g X beat; +2%, n.s.). Our investigations demonstrate that the degree of catecholamine-induced increase in myocardial O2-consumption depends on the isoenzyme pattern of myosin.", 
    "59": "In this study, bladder muscle strips from the detrusor of man and cat were used to evaluate the modulating effects of adrenergic agonist and antagonists on the field stimulation induced contractile response. Noradrenaline (NA) inhibited and phentolamine enhanced the contraction in a dose-dependent manner. Propranolol did not influence the field stimulation response. When a study of the combined effect of adrenergic drug influence was performed, the NA-induced inhibition was partly reversed by propranolol but a further increase of the contractile response compared to the control was seen, when phentolamine was added. No species differences were found. The conclusion drawn from these results is, that the inhibiting effect of NA on the contractile response is mediated via alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors. The former could be located on the short parasympathetic intramural neurons while the latter probably are located on muscle cells.", 
    "60": "The effects of alpha and beta adrenoreceptors blockade and surgical kidney denervation on ultradian rhythmicity in urine excretion were investigated in four dogs. Pharmacological treatments and surgical denervation of the kidneys suppressed the ultradian rhythmicity in urine flow but did not completely eliminate the ultradian rhythms in urinary osmolality and in electrolyte concentrations. These findings suggest that the autonomic nervous system plays a major role in the regulation of the ultradian rhythms in water excretion in dogs. The partial persistence of ultradian rhythms in urine osmolality and electrolyte concentrations after autonomic denervation supports the assertion that the ultradian rhythms in solute concentrations are regulated by different mechanisms to those of water excretion, suggesting the possible involvement of a multioscillatory system.", 
    "61": "In summary, relatively few solvents have been examined for developmental neurotoxicology. Although most of the studies have not been replicated, the majority of the solvents tested have produced significant differences from controls. Many used inhalation, which is often the most likely route of occupational or environmental exposure. The majority have extended the exposure for much of gestation of rats. The extensive usage of solvents and the proportion of those tested which have produced positive effects (although admittedly some not at environmentally-relevant exposure concentrations), make a strong case for additional testing of industrial solvents for developmental neurotoxicology.", 
    "62": "The autoradiographic distribution of [3H]arginine vasopressin, [3H]spiperone, [3H]GABA, [3H]dihydroalprenolol and the peripheral-type benzodiazepine ligand [3H]Ro5-4864 were examined in the rat pituitary before and after pituitary stalk transection. Stalk transection produced dramatic changes in the cellular architecture of the pars nervosa. Glial fibrillary acidic protein, an astrocyte marker reported in pituicytes, increased after stalk transection, whereas neurofilament, a marker for neuronal innervation, was lost. These structural changes demonstrated a successful stalk transection, permitting interpretation of changes in the densities of several [3H]-ligands over the three lobes. [3H]Ro5-4864 binding was markedly increased, suggesting that this site was located on the pituicytes. Conversely [3H]spiperone and [3H]arginine vasopressin binding density over the pars nervosa decreased. In the mutant diabetes insipidus rat (Brattleboro), which lacks pituitary vasopressin, [3H]arginine vasopressin binding was undetectable in the pars nervosa. [3H]dihydroalprenolol and [3H]GABA binding sites were unchanged by the lesion. These results are discussed in terms of the occurrence of functional acceptors on pituicytes and their possible role in neurohydrophyseal secretions.", 
    "63": "This study investigated whether short photoperiod or melatonin-treatment could alter the thermogenic capacity of Syrian hamsters. Exposure of hamsters to short photoperiod and to exogenous melatonin treatment induced gonadal regression and hypertrophy of brown adipose tissue (BAT). Short photoperiod and melatonin-induced BAT hypertrophy was not accompanied by any change in noradrenaline (NA) turnover in this tissue. The concentration of NA was significantly decreased in hypertrophied BAT, indicating that sympathetic innervation in BAT did not effect its hypertrophy. No improvement in nonshivering thermogenic capacity was noticed in hamsters with increased BAT mass. However, capability for shivering thermogenesis seemed to be enhanced in melatonin-treated hamsters. These observations suggest that melatonin, in addition to mediating short photoperiod-induced gonadal regression in the Syrian hamster, also brings about thermoregulatory adjustments necessary for hibernation.", 
    "64": "Four obese and four lean women were studied for 4 or 5 weeks in a metabolic unit to assess their short-term responses to carbohydrate- and protein-containing meals and the effects of beta-adrenergic blockade during both weight maintenance and semistarvation. The study was divided into four periods: a period of weight maintenance; a maintenance diet with propranolol; semistarvation; semistarvation plus propranolol. The low-energy diets contained half the amount of carbohydrate and fat but the protein intake was maintained. The metabolic rate was measured in the fasting state by indirect calorimetry prior to a test meal and then for prolonged periods up to 5.5 h after carbohydrate and 7.5 h after protein test meals. Three lean subjects also spent 23 h in a whole-body calorimeter in each period, when BMR and metabolic rate at different activity levels were measured. Propranolol causes a fall in BMR in both groups on a maintenance diet, but had little further effect on the lower BMR during semistarvation. The protein meal caused a peak increase of 30 percent in oxygen consumption (321 kJ in obese, 257 kJ in lean), two to three times that of the carbohydrate meal (91 kJ) despite the energy intake being 25 percent less in the protein meal. There was no consistent difference in postprandial thermogenesis in obese and lean subjects and the effect was not modified by propranolol or semistarvation. Propranolol caused reduced thermogenesis after a mixed meal in lean subjects.", 
    "65": "The proliferative response of secretory cells of parotid glands to isoproterenol could not be observed in tumour-bearing mice, while in normal mice a ten-fold increase was usually observed. Mice with subcutaneous allografts of normal tissue (tail fragments) demonstrated sensitivity similar to normal mice. Apparently, a lack of sensitivity in tumour-bearing mice is characteristic of the tumour-host interaction. According to electron microscopic cytochemical data the adenylate cyclase activity is not changed in the mentioned cells of the tumour-bearing mice. It is supposed that lack of sensitivity is due to an alteration of certain properties of some other components of the beta-adrenergic system.", 
    "66": "Twenty patients with mild to severe essential hypertension completed a 12-week open crossover study to compare the effectiveness and tolerance of two beta-blocker/diuretic combinations. Patients were allocated at random to receive treatment for 6 weeks with either 40 mg propranolol plus 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide twice daily or 400 mg acebutolol plus 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide once daily. They were then crossed over to the alternative medication for a further 6 weeks. Blood pressures and pulse rate were monitored in the supine and erect positions at regular intervals, as were side-effects, laboratory variables and ECG. The results showed that both combinations produced significant reductions from baseline in systolic and diastolic blood pressures but that the acebutolol combination produced a significantly greater reduction in diastolic blood pressure. There was no evidence of a treatment sequence effect. The two drug treatments were reasonably well tolerated, with a trend in favour of the acebutolol combination. No clinically significant changes were observed in any of the laboratory parameters investigated and there were no ECG abnormalities.", 
    "67": "The comparative anti-arrhythmic effect of equivalent daily doses of conventional propranolol ('Inderal') and long-acting propranolol ('Inderal' LA) was assessed in a double-blind, crossover study lasting 6 weeks in 13 patients with cardiac arrhythmias. Patients were investigated using 24-hour ambulatory monitoring. Both formulations of propranolol significantly reduced the heart rate, together with the number of ventricular premature beats and ventricular couplets, with no significant difference between treatments. The two formulations also produced similar plasma concentrations of propranolol. The long-acting formulation of propranolol proved an effective anti-arrhythmic treatment which, with once-daily dosage, may improve patient compliance with treatment.", 
    "68": "It was observed in experiments on mice that the central action of phenibut (beta-phenyl-gamma-aminobutyric acid) diminished after destruction of brain dopaminergic neurons by 6-hydroxydopamine and after pretreatment with the dopamine receptor blocker haloperidol which suggests the dopaminergic component in the action of phenibut. In 13 of 16 patients receiving long-term treatment with antiparkinsonic drugs, addition of phenibut (0.25 g thrice daily for 10 days) resulted in marked clinical improvement with a significant increase of motor activity, as well as diminution of both rigidity and tremor. Follow-up showed a significant lowering of muscle tone of rigid muscles, augmentation of their strength and amplitude of movements. In 8 patients receiving phenibut without antiparkinsonic drugs the results were negligible.", 
    "69": "The effects of labetalol, metoprolol, and placebo on pulmonary function and their interaction with isoproterenol were evaluated in 18 patients with reversible bronchial asthma [isoproterenol-induced increase in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of greater than or equal to 15%]. Two dose levels of each medication were studied (on consecutive days), with the lower doses of these drugs given randomly. When the lowest values during the 2-hour postdrug evaluation period were considered, FEV1 significantly increased (10.9%; 15.4%) following labetalol (200 and 400 mg, respectively), significantly decreased (-11.2%; -5.4%) after metoprolol (100 and 200 mg, respectively), and was unchanged after placebo. The effects of the three treatments on forced vital capacity (FVC) and maximal midexpiratory flow (MMEF) were qualitatively similar to those observed in FEV1. When isoproterenol was administered following labetalol (200 and 400 mg), FEV1 further increased with a resulting combined increase of 18.9 and 19.7%, respectively, indicating an additive interaction. The effect of isoproterenol was blunted by metoprolol (100 and 200 mg) (p less than 0.01, difference from the effect observed after labetalol and isoproterenol), indicating antagonistic interaction between these two drugs. Labetalol may be a safer antihypertensive than metoprolol in patients with concomitant bronchial asthma.", 
    "70": "The concentrations of acebutolol and of its main active metabolite diacetolol in milk and plasma were studied in 7 hypertensive mothers treated with acebutolol, a cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent. Clinical monitoring on their newborn babies was also done, as well as measurement of plasma level of the drug in them. The ratio between milk and plasma concentrations ranged from 1.9 to 9.2 for acebutolol and from 2.3 to 24.7 for diacetolol, and in any given milk sample, the diacetolol concentration was always higher than that of acebutolol. In a newborn infant, plasma concentrations of the two transplacentally acquired substances was raised when breast feeding started and remained high. Clinical signs of pharmacological beta-blockade were observed. Evaluation of the iatrogenic risk shows that pharmacologically active amounts of acebutolol might be received by a neonate if the daily maternal dosage exceeds 400 mg/day and/or renal function in the mother is impaired."
