    "0": "The effects of cold exposure on calcitonin (CT) secretion were evaluated in young rats. Acute cold exposure (5 h to 5 degrees C) induced a rise in plasma CT concentrations and a decrease in thyroidal CT stores without change in total and ionized plasma calcium levels. The cold activation of sympathico-adrenomedullary axis and the inhibition of CT response to cold after beta-antagonist treatment might suggest that endogenous catecholamines can enhance CT secretion in young rats. Cold adaptation (3 weeks to 5 degrees C) induced a fall in plasma calcium concentration and a rise in thyroidal CT stores without change in plasma CT levels. The high plasma glucocorticoid levels which are known to occur during chronic cold exposure could be involved in the rise of thyroidal CT content in cold adapted rats.", 
    "1": "Trauma may induce disturbance in the homeostasis and metabolism of phosphate. Serum phosphate decreases rapidly after trauma, and this rapid fall is followed by more slowly progressing hypophosphataemia, reaching minimum values on post-trauma days 2-5. The effect of propranolol on post-traumatic hypophosphataemia was studied in an experimental model, using anaesthetized pigs. Propranolol prevented the initial rapid decrease in serum phosphate. Twelve hours after the trauma, however, both the propranolol-treated and the untreated pigs showed significant serum phosphate depletion, with progression during the 48-hour observation period. The urinary phosphate excretion did not differ between the two groups, and after 48 hours the cumulative loss was the same in both groups. The adrenergic response to trauma was significantly greater in the propranolol-treated than in the untreated group. The results suggested that the rapid serum phosphate fall immediately after trauma was caused by adrenaline release. The second, slower phase was not related to adrenaline or noradrenaline release, but showed correlation with the urinary loss of phosphate.", 
    "2": "The effects of therapeutic doses of antiarrhythmic drugs (12 mg/Kg of procainamide, 2 mg/Kg of disopyramide and 0.2 mg/Kg of propranolol) on sinus cycle length (SCL), sinoatrial conduction time (SACT) estimated by a constant atrial pacing technique, and atrial developed tension (DT) were measured in isolated canine atria cross-perfused with heparinized arterial blood from donor dogs as well as on mean systemic blood pressure (SBP) and on heart rate (HR) in those dogs. Procainamide, which produced hypotension and bradycardia in the donor dog, did not change SACT significantly, although it increased SCL and decreased DT in the isolated atrium. However, disopyramide raising SBP slightly (but not significantly) and decreasing HR in the donor dog produced a significant prolongation of SACT and SCL and reduction of DT in the isolated atrium. Propranolol caused slight but insignificant hypotension and long-lasting bradycardia in the donor dog, accompanied by a significant increase in SCL and SACT, and decrease in DT in the isolated canine atrium. We concluded that SACT was significantly increased by a therapeutic dose of propranolol and disopyramide but was not altered by that of procainamide.", 
    "3": "The effects of nadolol on experimental arrhythmias were investigated and compared with those of propranolol and alprenolol. The arrhythmias were induced by either ouabain, holothane plus adrenaline or acute coronary occlusion in anesthetized dogs. All three beta-blocking drugs in a dose range of 10 to 200 micrograms/kg inhibited halothane plus adrenaline-induced arrhythmias. These drugs also attenuated coronary occlusion-induced ventricular arrhythmias as well as other electrical abnormalities such as electrical alternation and conduction delay. Among the three drugs, nadolol was the most potent in suppressing both types of arrhythmias. Contrary to the potent effects on these arrhythmias, nadolol was ineffective against ouabain-induced arrhythmias even in a dose of 3 mg kg, while propranolol and alprenolol were significantly effective in a dose of 100 micrograms/kg. It is probable that the anti-arrhythmic effect of nadolol is exclusively due to its beta-blocking activity.", 
    "4": "The purpose of the work is to evaluate in clinical setting the effects of autonomic nervous system on the refractory periods of atrio-ventricular (A-V) conduction. Electrophysiological study was carried out, both during basal state and after autonomic blockade induced by i.v. administration of propranolol 0.2 mg/Kg and atropine 0.04 mg/Kg, in 21 subjects with normal atrio-ventricular node conduction (A-H less than or equal to 120 msec) and normal sinus rate (mean age: 54.3 +/- 16.3 years). Following autonomic blockade the sinus cycle length decreased significantly (P less than 0.01), whereas A-H interval, A1-H1 interval at cycle length of 460 msec and the longest atrial pacing cycle length inducing Wenckebach block did not change significantly. Effective and functional refractory periods of the A-V node did not show significant variations after autonomic blockade (342.2 +/- 41 versus 337.2 +/- 54.2 msec and 435.9 +/- 58.9 versus 430 +/- 60.9 msec, respectively); however, these refractory periods changed variably from subject to subject; in some patients they increased and in others there was a marked decrease. There were no significant variations of atrial effective and functional refractory periods after autonomic blockade (249.5 +/- 29.6 versus 256.6 +/- 31.9 msec and 276.4 +/- 27.1 versus 287.7 +/- 33.4 msec, respectively); they too showed a variable response from subject to subject. The relative refractory period of His-Purkinje system, evaluated in 3 patients, increased in all after autonomic blockade (420 +/- 20 versus 463.3 +/- 15.2 msec).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "5": "Fifty-two patients with cirrhosis receiving continuous administration of propranolol in doses reducing the heart rate by 25% were studied. The doses and plasma levels varied widely - 185 +/- 98 mg/day (mean +/- SD) and 208 +/- 153 ng/ml, respectively. These values were significantly correlated. No significant correlation was found between the dose of the drug or plasma level and the liver function tests. Although propranolol significantly decreased cardiac output and the hepatic venous pressure gradient, no correlation was found between drug dose or plasma level and these haemodynamic effects.", 
    "6": "After screening a local population in the northern part of The Netherlands for hypertension, 59 patients with a diastolic pressure (DP) between 95 and 130 mmHg were randomized and treated either with 50 mg atenolol (n = 29) or 100 mg atenolol (n = 30) for 1 month. There was no significant difference between the two treatments, neither in the fall in systolic and diastolic pressures nor in the number of complaints reported. It is concluded that in the initial treatment of uncomplicated mild to moderate hypertension, 100 mg atenolol has no advantage over a 50 mg dose.", 
    "7": "In a prospective study of 10 patients with chronic ventricular arrhythmias, flecainide 50mg tid and propranolol 20mg tid were administered, alone and in combination, in a crossover design. Before and after each treatment phase, routine ECG and 24-hour ECG were recorded, morning plasma concentrations of the drugs were measured, and side effects recorded. Treatment with flecainide alone resulted in a 38% mean reduction (p less than 0.05) of ventricular premature complexes, a 75% (p less than 0.01) mean reduction of couplets, and elimination of ventricular tachycardia. At the dosage administered, propranolol alone had no antiarrhythmic effect. The combination of flecainide and propranolol showed no additional therapeutic benefit although there was a small, but not significant, increase in ventricular premature complexes and couplets. Use of flecainide resulted in a 12% widening of the QRS complex, with no significant change in PQ time, QTc and heart rate. Combined therapy with propranolol and flecainide resulted in a 12% decrease of average heart rate. The same effect was achieved when propranolol was given alone. The average plasma concentration of flecainide increased by 25% during combined therapy with propranolol. There were few side effects related to flecainide at the dosage administered and no additional side effects were recorded during the combined treatment.", 
    "8": "Dose-response curves to dopamine were obtained on guinea-pig, dog and human tracheal smooth muscle. Dopamine produced a relaxation of the guinea-pig tracheal chain, and this relaxation was completely blocked by propranolol. The potency of dopamine as a beta-agonist was 1/10 000 that of isoprenaline, 1/250 that of adrenaline and 1/50 that of noradrenaline. In human and dog tracheal smooth muscle, dopamine induced a contraction which could be entirely abolished by alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists. As an alpha-agonist, the potency of dopamine was 1/20 that of adrenaline and noradrenaline. Our data also show that a dopamine induced contraction is greatly potentiated if the smooth muscle specimen has been previously slightly contracted with histamine. We conclude that there are few, if any, specific dopaminergic receptors in the airways. Dopamine acts on both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors, but in humans and dogs, its effect is predominantly on alpha-adrenoceptors.", 
    "9": "Ambulatory monitoring of BP was performed in 11 patients whose 6 suffering from systo-diastolic (group 1) and 5 from systolic hypertension only (group 2) by Pressurometer III Del Mar Avionics after placebo (P), slow release Nifedipine (srN) 20 mg b.d. and srN plus Acebutolol (A) 400 mg in the morning, administered in 3 different days according to a randomized scheme. In both group we observed a significant decrease of BP after srN during 24 hrs, but in pts. of the group 2 the reduction of systolic BP was prevalent. After administration of srN+A the decrease of BP was more consistent in both groups of pts. HR showed a reflex increase in both groups of pts. after srN, antagonized by A, especially in pts. of group 2. Variability of BP considered as difference between the min and max levels of BP during 24 hrs decreased significantly with both treatments, while variability calculated as mean of the standard deviations and as coefficient of variability did not show significant changes in both groups of pts.", 
    "10": "Non-invasive ambulatory monitoring of blood pressure and ECG was employed to assess the 24-hour profile of blood pressure and arrhythmias in 20 out-patients aged 31-69 years. The technique was further used to measure the therapeutic response to 100 mg once daily of the cardioselective beta-blocker metoprolol. The basal ambulatory examinations revealed that all 20 patients had a mean 24-hour blood pressure of greater than 160/90 mm Hg, corresponding to a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of greater than 113 mm Hg. In 16 of the 20 patients (80%) the mean 24-hour MAP was reduced to below 113 mm Hg. Addition of diuretics in the remaining four patients further decreased the mean 24-hour MAP to less than 113 mm Hg, which confirmed by a third ambulatory examination. The ECG recordings in the initial ambulatory study revealed severe degrees of ventricular arrhythmias in 7 patients. After treatment with metoprolol, all of them presented an improved ECG picture.", 
    "11": "The antihypertensive effect of different agents was investigated in patients with essential hypertension both at the clinic and in the ambulatory state using the semi-automatic Remler M2000 blood pressure recorder. In 7 patients treated for 4 weeks with a transdermal therapeutic system delivering clonidine, blood pressures measured at the physician's office were not significantly decreased whereas blood pressures recorded during patients' customary daily activities were markedly reduced. In an additional study performed in double-blind fashion, the blood pressure lowering effect of timolol (10-20 mg/d, n = 14) and of methyldopa (250-500 mg/d, n = 16) were compared. These agents were given for 6 weeks in association with a baseline diuretic therapy of hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride. When assessed at the clinic, the antihypertensive effect of timolol and methyldopa was similar. During ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, however, pressure levels were lower (p less than 0.05 for the diastolic) in the patients given timolol. These data indicate that blood pressure monitoring outside the clinic makes it possible to detect important differences in the response to antihypertensive therapy even though, based on office blood pressure readings, no significant change occurs. It appears therefore desirable to include ambulatory blood pressure recordings in the design of drug trials.", 
    "12": "Gastrointestinal (GI) absorption of the beta-adrenoceptor blocker metoprolol was investigated in five healthy subjects by means of an intubation method, employing a triple-lumen tube introduced into the intestine, and a twin-lumen tube in the stomach. Metoprolol was introduced into the stomach with a homogenized meal containing a nonabsorbable marker, [14C]-PEG 4000, and another marker, PEG 4000, was perfused continuously into the duodenum just below the pylorus. Samples of GI contents were collected at regular intervals over 4 h in the stomach and at two different levels in the upper small intestine. Metoprolol was not absorbed from the stomach. Approximately 60% of the amount of drug emptied from the stomach was absorbed from the duodenum; about 50% of that leaving the duodenum was absorbed from the first part of the jejunum. The delivery process was the rate-limiting factor of metoprolol absorption in these segments of the gut. Plasma concentrations reflected drug loss from the lumen and were higher in subjects exhibiting faster gastric emptying and higher absorption rates in the duodenum and jejunum. The intubation technique appeared to be a suitable method for investigating drug absorption from the GI tract in man.", 
    "13": "The performance of oxprenolol and metoprolol Oros systems has been evaluated in the dog. One study compared in vivo and in vitro release from both systems over 2-14 h. The other compared the systemic availabilities of both drugs after 3 h infusion at a constant rate into the cephalic and hepatic portal veins, and into the lumen of the duodenum and colon. In the in vivo release studies, Oros systems were recovered throughout the gut from the stomach to the colon. The amounts of drug remaining in the systems corresponded closely to those measured in a parallel in vitro release experiment. In vitro testing is thus a reliable indicator of in vivo system performance. In the absorption studies, both metoprolol and oxprenolol were shown to be subject to substantial first-pass metabolism. Additionally, for metoprolol the data indicated a significant loss during transport from the gut lumen into the portal circulation. For both drugs the availability from the colon was equal to that from the duodenum. These results provide some justification for the development of oral dosage forms with extended durations of release even for drugs which undergo significant first-pass metabolism.", 
    "14": "The absorption of metoprolol from the stomach, small intestine and colon of anaesthetized rats has been evaluated using an in situ technique. Absorption rates were measured in terms of the rate of disappearance of metoprolol fumarate from the lumen between 5 and 30 min after dosing. Adsorption was estimated from the initial rapid fall in luminal content within the first 5 min after drug administration. The rate of drug absorption from the stomach was low or negligible. In the small intestine, the absorption rate constants, ka, at pH 6.2 and 7.5 were 0.66 and 0.81 h-1, respectively. In the colon, the rate of drug absorption at pH 7.5 was faster (ka = 1.21 h-1) than in other segments of the gut. Drug adsorption in the stomach amounted to 11% of the administered dose. In the small intestine adsorption was greater (16-22%), presumably because of the larger surface area in this segment of the gut, but in the colon adsorption was negligible.", 
    "15": "The essential features and mode of action of oral osmotic drug delivery systems (Oros) for metoprolol fumarate and oxprenolol succinate are described. Critical aspects in the development of systems for once-daily administration of both drugs are discussed, and methods for evaluating in vitro release characteristics are presented. In vitro testing confirmed that drug delivery corresponded closely to the theoretical release behaviour predicted from the physicochemical and membrane permeability characteristics for both oxprenolol and metoprolol systems. In vitro release rates were also shown to be unaffected by pH, in vitro test procedures, dissolution media and long-term storage at different temperatures.", 
    "16": "The influence of food on the release, absorption and metabolism of metoprolol has been studied after single administration of a 19/190 Oros system to eight healthy volunteers on four occasions, once after an overnight fast, and just before each of three daily meals (breakfast, lunch and dinner). The plasma concentration-time profiles under the four test conditions were virtually identical, and no statistically significant differences in mean areas under the curves between 0 and 32 h, peak concentrations, or times to peak, were detected. The absorption of metoprolol was unaffected by food intake, with 80-90% of the amount absorbed reaching the systemic circulation within 10 h. The ratios of areas under the curve for alpha-hydroxymetoprolol to its parent drug were in the same range for the four treatments, and similar to those reported after conventional tablets. The in vivo release and absorption of drug from the Oros system and its systemic availability, were not influenced by concomitant ingestion of food.", 
    "17": "Plasma metoprolol concentrations and haemodynamic effects have been measured in six healthy male volunteers during once daily dosing with a 19/285 Oros system and twice daily dosing with 100 mg conventional tablets, on two separate occasions. Plasma drug concentrations throughout the day varied less with the Oros than with the conventional tablet regimen. Predosing concentrations were also higher with Oros but areas under the curve, after correcting for the differences in dose, were similar for the two preparations. Inhibition of exercise tachycardia was drug concentration dependent and was smoothly controlled through the day only with the Oros preparation. Predosing effects at steady-state were also greater for the Oros regimen. The decline in mean blood pressure, however, showed the same daily pattern for both regimens, and no significant differences were detected between Oros and conventional tablet treatments. The smoothness of the plasma profiles after Oros confirmed the controlled-release performance of the system in vivo and indicates its potential in the treatment of angina, cardiac arrhythmias and wherever it is important not to jeopardize steady selective beta-adrenoceptor blockade.", 
    "18": "A combined biopharmaceutical and haemodynamic approach to the development of a metoprolol Oros controlled-release delivery system for once daily administration is reported. Two studies, each involving 18 healthy volunteers, were performed in which twice daily administration of 100 mg conventional metoprolol tartrate tablets was compared with once daily administration of Oros systems containing 190 mg metoprolol fumarate but with different drug release rates. Plasma drug concentrations and beta-adrenoceptor blocking effects were measured over 24 h on days 1 and 5 of each treatment, and pre-dose in the interval between the main study days. The results of the first study with a 19 mg/h Oros system indicated that this rate was too rapid to provide the required response under steady-state dosing conditions. Theoretical calculations based on a one-compartment pharmacokinetic model and input functions for hypothetical Oros systems were then performed to define the optimal release rate for a once daily preparation. The results of the second study confirmed that a 14 mg/h system possessed the required characteristics in that it maintained more uniform beta-adrenoceptor blockade throughout 24 h, and produced pre-dosing plasma concentrations and haemodynamic effects which were identical to those for the conventional tablet twice daily regimen.", 
    "19": "Plasma concentrations and haemodynamic effects at rest and during exercise have been measured in six healthy volunteers after single oral dosing with two Oros drug delivery systems containing 190 mg metoprolol fumarate but with initial release rates of 14 and 19 mg/h, respectively. Sub-maximal exercise heart rates were attenuated by both Oros systems throughout most of the 30 h study period but no significant differences were detected between the 14/190 and 19/190 forms. Resting pulse rates and blood pressure were similarly affected by the Oros preparations. Approximately the same amount of drug reached the circulation from the Oros systems, but the 19/190 form produced higher peak concentrations at earlier times after dosing. At 24 h higher plasma concentrations were observed for the 14/190 preparation, reflecting its longer duration of drug release. There was no apparent advantage of one form over the other as regards haemodynamic response. The reduced peak plasma concentration with 14/190 Oros may, however, be an advantage in terms of tolerability.", 
    "20": "The influence of the site of drug delivery on the systemic availability of metoprolol has been evaluated by measuring plasma drug concentrations in six healthy volunteers after administration of a continuous 13.5 h intragastric infusion and a 14/190 Oros controlled-release dosage form, on two separate occasions. The same total amount of drug was administered at the same rate on both occasions but the Oros system moved through the gut whereas the site of the infusion was constant. The differences between treatments were confined largely to the period 6-15 h after dosing when lower plasma concentrations were obtained after administration of the Oros system. The levels after 20 h were higher for Oros, however, reflecting its longer duration of drug release. The amount of drug reaching the circulation was 19.8% less for the Oros preparation compared with intragastric infusion but this was not due to incomplete release since the residual amounts of drug in three systems recovered from faeces corresponded to less than 12% of the administered dose. Analysis of the plasma profiles by the Wagner-Nelson method indicated a reasonable agreement between in vitro release and in vivo absorption. The appearance of drug in plasma was delayed for both treatments, and for Oros the apparent absorption rate slowed 6 h after dosing. Plasma profiles after 14/190 metoprolol Oros were consistent with prolonged in vivo delivery and absorption from the gut. The absorption process, however, was associated with some reduction both in the rate, after 6 h, and in the total amount reaching the circulation.", 
    "21": "In vivo absorption from 19/190 and 19/285 metoprolol Oros drug delivery systems has been assessed by measuring plasma drug concentrations after single administration of the systems to six healthy volunteers. The initial in vitro release rate for both Oros preparations was 19 mg/h but they contained 190 or 285 mg of metoprolol fumarate. The plasma concentration-time profiles for both Oros dosage forms were consistent with an extended duration of release and absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Analysis of the plasma level data indicated that the rate and duration of in vivo absorption closely mirrored the in vitro release behaviour of the 19/190 and 19/285 systems, but the in vivo profiles showed a 1-2 h initial delay. The administration of the 19/190 system on two occasions to the same six volunteers indicated that in vivo release of drug from this Oros preparation was reproducible.", 
    "22": "Nineteen patients receiving oxprenolol slow-release (SR) 160 mg (three patients) or 320 mg (16 patients) once daily for mild to moderate hypertension were treated with oxprenolol Oros 16/260 once daily for 3 weeks following a 2 week placebo wash-out period. Repeated dosing with both Oros and SR oxprenolol preparations, in comparison with placebo, significantly reduced supine systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and pulse rate at 24 h after dosing. Single Oros doses also significantly reduced pulse rate and diastolic, but not systolic, blood pressure at 24 h. The reduction in supine systolic blood pressure was greater during repeated dosing with oxprenolol SR than after a single dose of the Oros preparation. Control of supine diastolic blood pressure (less than or equal to 90 mm Hg) at 24 h after dosing was achieved in 13 out of 18 patients with oxprenolol SR (two out of three patients given 160 mg, and 11 out of 15 given 320 mg). Similar control was achieved in 11 out of 18 patients after a single dose of oxprenolol Oros, and in 13 out of 17 patients treated for 3 weeks. The mean percentage reduction in exercise heart rate (EHR) compared to placebo, at 24 h after dosing, was 16% following Oros treatment for 3 weeks, and 12% following SR administration. After a single dose of oxprenolol Oros EHR, was reduced by 9% at 24 h compared to placebo. At 3 weeks the Oros formulation was significantly better than the SR tablet at reducing EHR. Oxprenolol Oros 16/260 was effective over 24 h and well tolerated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "23": "Transit times for oxprenolol and metoprolol Oros drug delivery systems through the gastrointestinal tract have been measured in 35 individuals in six separate studies. A total of 45 systems were recovered in a median time of 27.4 h; individual transit times varied from 5.1 to 58.3 h. The residual amount of drug in recovered systems was inversely related to transit time and corresponded closely with the amount estimated from in vitro dissolution profiles.", 
    "24": "Plasma concentrations of oxprenolol have been measured in six healthy volunteers following single-dose oral administration of the drug in conventional and Oros dosage forms in fasting and postprandial states. After the Oros system, plasma concentrations reached peaks in most subjects at 3-8 h after dosing and were approximately 25% of those achieved with the conventional tablet. Plasma concentrations were well sustained for at least 24 h. A secondary peak occurred consistently at 12 h, possibly reflecting a transient change in clearance and/or distribution of the drug following the evening meal. With each formulation, plasma drug concentration profiles following administration in the fasting state did not differ significantly from those obtained when the drug was given postprandially. Drug absorption in vivo corresponded reasonably closely with in vitro drug release from the Oros system.", 
    "25": "Plasma oxprenolol concentrations were measured in six young healthy female volunteers after single oral dosing with a 16/260 oxprenolol Oros system on three separate occasions. Reproducibility was assessed by comparing individual plasma profiles, areas under the curve, peak concentrations and times to peak. Plasma concentration-time profiles were consistent with an extended duration of drug release from the Oros system. Individual and mean profiles on the three occasions were similar, and no significant differences in mean plasma levels, or derived pharmacokinetic parameters, were detected. The mean amount of drug in eight systems recovered from faeces corresponded to 11% of the dose. Individual amounts were related to the total transit time of the system through the body. The 16/260 Oros system functioned reproducibly within the gastrointestinal tract, and in vivo absorption mirrored in vitro drug release.", 
    "26": "A new osmotic drug delivery system (Oros) has been evaluated in multiple-dose studies in young healthy volunteers as a sustained-release vehicle for once-daily administration of oxprenolol. Two Oros systems were examined in two separate studies, one containing 170 mg oxprenolol succinate with an initial zero-order release rate of 10 mg/h, and the other containing 260 mg oxprenolol succinate with an initial release rate of 16 mg/h. These were compared respectively with conventional oxprenolol hydrochloride (Trasicor) 80 mg twice daily and polymer-matrix oxprenolol hydrochloride (Slow Trasicor) 160 mg once daily. Variations in mean plasma levels and beta-adrenoceptor blockade (measured by inhibition of exercise tachycardia) were considerably reduced on the 10/170 Oros once-daily compared with the Trasicor 80 mg twice-daily regimen. With both formulations there was no significant change in mean plasma concentrations or areas under the curve after 8 days' treatment, and similar pre-dose plasma concentrations were obtained. There was significant inhibition of exercise tachycardia throughout 24 h after the 10/170 Oros on the eighth day. The 16/260 Oros system gave smoother pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles, and on repeated dosing a higher mean pre-dose plasma oxprenolol concentration than Slow Trasicor. Drug availability was similar for the two dose forms, suggesting an acceptable level of absorption of oxprenolol from most of the gastrointestinal tract. On the eighth day exercise heart rate was significantly reduced throughout 24 h with 16/260 oxprenolol Oros, but only between 1 and 15 h with Slow Trasicor.", 
    "27": "Oxprenolol was administered in single doses by mouth to healthy volunteers either in a polymer-matrix slow-release formulation (Slow Trasicor) or in osmotic drug-delivery systems (oxprenolol Oros). Plasma oxprenolol concentrations and heart rates after exercise were measured. Plasma concentrations of the drug were maximal at 3 h but negligible at 24 h after administration of Slow Trasicor. Following ingestion of the Oros systems measurable concentrations were maintained throughout 24 h. Significant reduction of exercise-induced tachycardia persisted for 24 h after administration of oxprenolol Oros. With Slow Trasicor heart rate responses had returned to baseline values by this time. The osmotic drug-delivery systems appear to sustain significant beta-adrenoceptor blockade for 24 h after a single oral dose.", 
    "28": "The absorption kinetics of oxprenolol have been investigated in eight healthy volunteers after single dosing with 16/260 Oros drug delivery systems. Oxprenolol disposition kinetics in individual subjects were estimated from intravenous dose data. Loo-Riegelman analysis of the plasma concentration data indicated an extended duration of drug absorption for the Oros system. Initially, the in vivo absorption rate was similar to the in vitro release rate but after 5-6 h it slowed perceptibly. However, at later times similar in vivo and in vitro rates were again observed. The absolute bioavailabilities for prototype and clinical trial systems were shown to be similar, at approximately 42%, and no significant differences in plasma profiles or pharmacokinetic constants were detected between the two Oros forms. A comparison of plasma concentration data in seven subjects who received the prototype system on two occasions in separate studies indicated a consistent level of drug absorption from this preparation. Approximately 10-15% of the administered dose was found in Oros systems recovered from faeces. The quantity of drug remaining was poorly correlated with the observed areas under the plasma concentration-time curve.", 
    "29": "The relationship between in vitro and in vivo drug release from Oros systems has been examined by analysing plasma concentration data from two pharmacokinetic studies, using a numerical deconvolution technique. This method generates an input profile by comparing the response with that achieved following an instantaneous reference unit dose. The approach is conceptually simple and does not require compartmental pharmacokinetic modelling or curve fitting. In the analysis of the first study, the plasma profile following intravenous dosing was used as the reference function, allowing the combined release/absorption process to be calculated; for the second, an oral bolus was used, the result of the deconvolution therefore indicating the in vivo dissolution rate of the Oros systems. The in vivo release from Oros in most volunteers followed the same pattern as that measured in vitro; only after 6-8 h was the decline in the in vivo release rate somewhat greater than expected. In a few individuals the cumulative absorption profile reached an early plateau level which coincided, on some but not all occasions, with the premature excretion of the Oros system from the body. The amount of drug in recovered systems agreed reasonably with the prediction of the deconvolution analysis.", 
    "30": "A mathematical model describing the relationship between plasma concentrations of oxprenolol and submaximal-exercise heart rates has been developed on the basis of data available from 34 healthy volunteers. This relationship, which is exponential in type, is consistent with the 'law of diminishing returns', and is independent of the pharmaceutical formulations used; it appears to be established instantaneously, and is not modified by repeated drug administration over 8 days. At oxprenolol concentrations of 190-250 ng/ml, between half and three-quarters of the subjects investigated reached 90% of their estimated maximum levels of beta-adrenoceptor blockade.", 
    "31": "The systemic availability of oxprenolol after colonic and oral administration has been compared in a crossover study involving six healthy male volunteers. Drug administration into two regions of the colon (caecum and left flexure) was achieved by means of a colonoscopic technique. There were no obvious differences in plasma concentrations after drug administration to the caecum and left flexure, although in one subject it was necessary to repeat colonic administration because of unexpectedly high plasma drug levels on the first occasion. The possible reasons for this abnormal response are discussed. The mean systemic availability of oxprenolol was 82% after colonic compared with oral dosing, although marked differences were observed in individual plasma levels following drug administration by the two routes. The results of this study support the concept of extending the duration of oxprenolol release from a rate-controlled dosage form to permit once-daily administration with this short elimination half-life drug.", 
    "32": "The role of the adrenergic system in normal gastric function was assessed in five healthy volunteers by measuring gastric secretion and emptying after a mixed meal containing a non-absorbable marker, [14C]-PEG 4000, with and without 100 mg of metoprolol, a beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist. Intraduodenal perfusion of PEG 4000, and gastric and jejunal sampling was achieved by means of a gastrointestinal intubation technique. Gastric function was assessed from the degree of dilution of the duodenal marker. Analysis of acid content by titration allowed the gastric acid secretory rate to be determined. Gastric emptying of a meal over 4 h was similar with and without metoprolol, the time to 50% emptying being 100 min. In the presence of metoprolol, gastric acid content was significantly increased during the late postprandial period producing a corresponding increase in acid load delivered to the duodenum. beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade appears to prolong the gastric secretory response to food without altering gastric emptying.", 
    "33": "The influence of nutrients and digestive secretions on the intestinal absorption and bioavailability of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, metoprolol, was investigated in an isolated segment of jejunum using an intestinal perfusion technique. Two solutions containing metoprolol, one with, and one without nutrients, were perfused into the jejunum with an occluding balloon inflated or deflated. Jejunal fluid, blood and urine samples were then collected for drug or metabolite estimation. In the segment studied, metoprolol absorption from the nutrient solution was four times that observed during perfusion of the saline solution. Bile salts did not enhance drug absorption. Both in the presence and absence of nutrients, a linear relationship was observed between the computed cumulative amount of drug absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and the resulting plasma concentration at each sampling time, indicating that first-pass loss was not saturated. This result was also reflected in the similarity of the AUC:dose ratios, and in the lack of effect of nutrients on the metabolism of the drug.", 
    "34": "The colonic absorption of metoprolol was indirectly evaluated by measuring drug appearance in plasma following intravenous, jejunal or colonic infusion in six healthy volunteers. Plasma concentrations of alpha-hydroxymetoprolol and urinary excretion of the main metabolites were also measured. Plasma profiles of metoprolol after colonic and jejunal perfusion were similar, and the relative bioavailabilities of the drug from these two regions of the gut were not significantly different. The concentrations of alpha-hydroxymetoprolol, the major metabolite in plasma, were similar after jejunal and colonic perfusion, but higher than those observed after intravenous administration. The percentage of the dose recovered in urine over 24 h as two metabolites was not significantly influenced by the route of administration.", 
    "35": "Absorption of metoprolol in jejunum and ileum was investigated in eight healthy subjects using an intestinal perfusion technique below an occlusive balloon. An isotonic saline solution, with or without metoprolol, was perfused at a flow rate of 10 ml/min, either at the angle of Treitz or in the middle part of the ileum. The absorption in a 30 cm intestinal segment was evaluated at metoprolol concentrations of 20, 40 and 60 mg/l. Metoprolol did not affect gut motility. Metoprolol was similarly absorbed in the jejunum and ileum. The absorption rates appeared to be linearly related to the perfusion rates and to the mean concentration in the segment, indicating a first-order kinetic process. The absorption rate of metoprolol perfused in the jejunum in a saline solution appeared to be lower than that observed after gastric administration of the drug incorporated in a meal. The findings in this and other studies in this series indicate that metoprolol is similarly absorbed throughout the small intestine.", 
    "36": "Experiments with isolated animal hearts showed that intracoronarily injected propranolol (beta-adrenoblocker) and nonachlasine (beta-adrenostimulator) lead to coronary dilatation changing into coronary constriction. Unlike propranolol, nonachlasine reduced the venous bed capacity. The use of nonachlasine resulted in primary reduction and consequent increase of myocardial contractility, propranolol leading to negative inotropic effect. The character and degree of the drug effect in hemodynamics depend on the initial activity of the sympathoadrenal system. The therapeutic effectiveness of the drugs also depends on the initial hemodynamic state and on the sympathoadrenal system activity. A comparative study of Ca2+ antagonists demonstrated corinfar to have positive ino- and chronotropic effect. Isoptine was shown to produce negative ino- and chronotropic action, with hemodynamics remaining indifferent to sensite. Ca2+ antagonists examined in the study are characterized by a diverse therapeutic effect and considerably differ in their influence on the circulatory system.", 
    "37": "The effect of the beta-blocker propranolol and of bensonal, a barbituric acid derivative stimulating microsomal oxidation of the liver monooxygenase, was evaluated using the model of experimental myocardial infarction (EMI) in the presence of 3-month cholesterol atherosclerosis. Using light and electron microscopy, polarography and weight planimetry atherosclerosis was shown to complicate considerably the course of EMI analyzed 1, 3, 7, 15 and 30 days after the coronary artery ligation. The drugs given at the same intervals improved the structure and metabolism of different myocardial zones while limiting necrotic areas for 7 days of EMI.", 
    "38": "Three synthetic 1-O-hexadecyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholines and the corresponding 1-O-hexadecyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphoric acid methyl esters were tested for platelet-aggregatory and membranolytic properties. Nanomolar concentrations of both the 2-O-acetyl and the 2-O-propionyl derivative of 1-O-hexadecyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholine were shown to activate platelets in human platelet-rich plasma. About 625-fold higher concentrations of the corresponding phosphoric acid methyl esters are required to produce the same platelet-stimulating effect. The 1-O-hexadecyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholine and the 1-O-hexadecyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphoric acid methyl ester are both nearly ineffective up to final concentrations of 0.1 to 0.2 mM. All tested compounds also cause a graduated lysis of red cells in the range of micromolar concentrations.", 
    "39": "This study was carried out in association with medical practitioners who were responsible for observing the patients. In a first phase, 58 subjects younger than 70 years with moderate essential hypertension were allotted at random to treatment with either indapamide (2.5 mg per day) or muzolimine (20 mg per day). The double blind-double dummy study lasted for six months and demonstrated that the two drugs were similar in efficacy and tolerance. At the end of this phase 42 patients whose supine diastolic blood pressure fell to below 100 mmHg were selected to continue the trial with 20 mg per day muzolimine in an open long-term study. The survey comprised two periods: the first lasted for six months, the patients being examined every two months, and the second lasted for one year and patients were seen quarterly. However, 8 subjects entered directly into the second period. At each examination standing and supine blood pressure, heart rate and body weight were noted; blood was sampled to allow measurements of serum plasma parameters. Thus 15 patients were treated with muzolimine over two years and 15 over 18 months. Clinically the fall in blood pressure observed initially was maintained throughout the rest of the trial; but 3 patients needed another drug, i.e. central hypotensor (2 cases) and beta-blocker (1 case). Two subjects complained of transitory cramps, but 3 other complications not imputable to the treatment were observed: one myocardial infarction and 2 strokes. Biologically there was no change in mean plasma potassium level, but 3 patients received a potassium supplement.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "40": "RU 24722, a compound selected for its protective effect against cerebral anoxia and ischemia in rats, induced a dose-dependent increase in brain ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), a rate limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of polyamines. This action already 2 hr after injection, increased at 4 and 6 hr and ODC activity returned to pretreatment levels at 16 hr. Since it has been shown previously that glucocorticoids stimulate brain ODC, it was considered necessary to know if corticosterone could play a role in the action of RU 24722. This compound increased serum corticosterone levels 1 hr after injection, its effect being nil at 4 hr. Nevertheless, the effect of RU 24722 on brain ODC does not appear to be entirely dependent on the increase of serum corticosterone. the delays needed to obtain a stimulation of the enzyme by the steroid are longer (6 hr) than those necessary to observe the action of the drug (2 hr)on brain ODC. Furthermore, RU 24722 increased brain ODC even in adrenalectomized animals. In order to get an insight on the interaction of RU 24722 with putative transmitters, we have studied the effect of the compound on brain ODC in the presence of different pharmacological agents. Experiments performed using noradrenergic agonists and antagonits suggest that the action of RU 24722 on brain ODC is due to the blockade of inhibitory post-synaptic alpha-2 adrenoceptors. We have studied the action of other compounds, used for the treatment of senile cerebral insufficiency: codergocrine, dihydroergocristine, dihydroergocryptine, dihydroergocornine, dihydroergocristine and piribedil increased rat brain ODC; vincamine, piracetam and nicergoline were devoid of any action.", 
    "41": "Salivary flow was studied in normotensives and in subjects with hypertension. Salivary flow rate was lower in borderline hypertensives than in normotensives. Propranolol, phentolamine and noradrenaline had no influence on salivary flow. Atropine decreased this parameter. The stimulating effect of neostigmine on saliva production was more pronounced in normotensives than in borderline hypertensives. The data support the assumption that in subjects with borderline hypertension the parasympathetic influence on the salivary glands is reduced.", 
    "42": "A study was made of the vascular protein synthesis in young, genetically hypertensive rats, mainly in their renal arteries. Some of the rats were treated either with 3.5 mg/kg of phenoxybenzamine (POB) or with 4 mg/kg of propranolol twice daily, from 6 to 8 weeks of age. 3H-proline was injected intravenously into each rat before sacrifice to analyse the in vivo incorporation rates of tritiated proline into the vascular collagen and vascular non-collagenous proteins. Evidence has been presented that: (1) the rates of incorporation of 3H-proline into collagen and non-collagenous proteins of the renal arteries in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) were greater than those in normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY); (2) the administration of POB decreased incorporation of 3H-proline into the collagen and non-collagenous proteins of the renal arteries concomitant with a reduction of blood pressure in every rat strain; (3) the administration of propranolol failed to decrease the incorporation of 3H-proline into these connective tissue proteins in the renal arteries and this drug did not reduce blood pressure in every rat strain; (4) the incorporation rates of 3H-proline into these protein fractions in hearts were similar in every rat strain which received any drug treatment. These results indicate that an increased synthesis of collagen and non-collagenous proteins in the renal arteries of young SHR and SHRSP rats participates in the pathogenesis of spontaneous hypertension in the early hypertensive stage.", 
    "43": "Indenolol hydrochloride is a recently introduced antihypertensive substance. Although it has beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity, its action is due to total peripheral resistance reduction. We investigated the effects of indenolol therapy on left ventricular performance in 15 patients with essential hypertension. Assessments were made using systolic time intervals and computerized echocardiography. The echocardiographic and mechanocardiographic tracings were recorded three times: at the beginning of the trial, after seven days of placebo, and after three weeks of indenolol treatment. The indenolol therapy significantly decreased (P less than 0.001) systolic and diastolic blood pressures and heart rate in all patients, both in supine and standing positions. After three weeks of treatment, systolic time intervals and echocardiographic determinants of left ventricular function were substantially unchanged in comparison with the basal and placebo evaluations. We conclude that indenolol exerted a marked effect on chronotropism but no demonstrable negative effect on inotropism in patients with essential hypertension. No clinical signs of heart failure were recorded. Side effects were absent, and patient compliance was good in all cases.", 
    "44": "Mitochondria isolated from tissues of hypoxic animals have increased respiratory capacity (State 3 respiration) when assayed in vitro at ambient oxygen tensions. The present study utilized the isolated perfused rat heart to determine whether or not this change could be produced in the absence of the neural and hormonal changes that accompany hypoxia in vivo. Following 10-min single pass retrograde perfusion with normoxic Krebs-Henseleit buffer (PO2 greater than or equal to 600 mmHg), perfusion was continued for up to 15 min with either normoxic or hypoxic buffer (PO2 less than or equal to 150 mmHg). After 10 min of hypoxic perfusion State 3 respiration of the mitochondria from the hypoxic hearts was 13 to 15% higher (P less than or equal to 0.05) than that of normoxic hearts when assayed with either glutamate/malate or succinate as substrate but was unchanged when TMPD and ascorbate was the substrate. Succinate-supported State 4 respiration of the hypoxic mitochondria also showed a small (10%) but significant (P less than or equal to 0.05) increase. These changes were not abolished by preperfusing the heart with propranolol (10(-7), 10(-6), or 10(-5) M) indicating that the response was not attributable to release of local stores of catecholamines. Respiratory control and ADP/O ratios as well as contents of cytochrome c and aa3 of the mitochondria from the hypoxic hearts were similar to those of normoxic hearts indicating that the mitochondria remained intact and tightly coupled. We concluded that the hypoxia-induced increase in mitochondrial State 3 respiration, while independent of neural and hormonal influences from the body requires an intracellular event, since they cannot be reproduced by subjecting isolated mitochondria to hypoxia in vitro.", 
    "45": "The first recorded case of beta-blocker overdose complicated by rhabdomyolysis is described.", 
    "46": "Isovolumetrically contracting left ventricle of the anesthetized dog was used to evaluate the end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship [LVEDP (P)-LVEDV (V) relationship (curve)] following changes in heart rate, ischemia and administration of beta-adrenergic blocking drug. At the same time, relaxation indices were also obtained. Initial left ventricular volume was set at the end-diastolic pressure of 2.0 mmHg. Comparison of each parameters after intervention was done when each initial left ventricular volume was increased by 10 ml. With increase in heart rate, LVEDP increased significantly from 5.1 +/- 2.1 to 14.0 +/- 2.2 mmHg (at 160 bpm, p less than 0.02, vs 100 bpm) and to 24.0 +/- 1.0 mmHg (at 180 bpm, vs p less than 0.001, vs 100 bpm). Regional ischemia also increased LVEDP significantly from 6.4 +/- 1.4 mmHg to 12.8 +/- 4.1 mmHg (after 30 min, p less than 0.01, vs control) and to 14.1 +/- 4.7 mmHg (after 45 min, p less than 0.01, vs control). However, global ischemia produced by decreasing coronary perfusion pressure to 50 mmHg, or administration of propranolol (1.0 mg/kg) brought about no significant changes in LVEDP. Among the relaxation indices, peak negative dp/dt decreased significantly following global ischemia, regional ischemia and administration of propranolol (from 1101 +/- 131 to 733 +/- 49 mmHg/sec, p less than 0.01, from 888 +/- 425 to 268 +/- 94 mmHg/sec after 45 min, p less than 0.01 and from 562 +/- 160 to 291 +/- 100 mmHg/sec, p less than 0.01, respectively). On the other hand, time constant (T) of the left ventricular pressure fall was prolonged significantly following regional ischemia from 44.7 +/- 5.2 to 72.0 +/- 8.6 msec (after 30 min, p less than 0.001) and 95.4 +/- 26.0 msec (after 30 min, p less than 0.001) and 95.4 +/- 26.0 msec (after 45 min, p less than 0.001). Therefore, it is concluded that LV diastolic compliance decreases by tachycardia (160 and 180 bpm) and regional ischemia, while the changes of the relaxation indices were not necessarily parallel to those of the LV compliance.", 
    "47": "The acute and long-term effects of the beta 1-adrenoceptor blocking agent metoprolol on blood pressure and maximal aerobic power (Wmax) were studied in 10 healthy subjects. Progressive maximal bicycle ergometer tests were performed after intravenous administration of placebo and metoprolol (0.15 mg . kg-1 and 0.30 mg . kg-1), and at the end of 4-week treatment periods with placebo, conventional metoprolol (C-M) and slow-release metoprolol (SR-M). The reduction in maximal exercise heart rate (HRmax) was correlated with the log plasma metoprolol concentration. Despite a reduction in HRmax of 23 beats/min after 0.15 mg . kg-1 metoprolol, Wmax was unaffected. After 0.30 mg . kg-1 HRmax was reduced by 40 beats/min and Wmax by 5.0%. During chronic treatment, the reductions in HRmax and Wmax were 48 beats/min and 7.5% (C-M) and 45 beats/min and 6.9% (SR-M), respectively. Resting systolic blood pressure was not changed after acute administration of metoprolol but it was reduced during chronic beta-blocker treatment. Resting diastolic blood pressure was not affected after acute or chronic treatment. Exercise systolic blood pressure remained unchanged after 0.15 mg . kg-1 metoprolol i.v. The fall in exercise systolic pressure after 0.30 mg . kg-1 metoprolol i.v. (18 +/- 5 mmHg) was significantly smaller than that during chronic treatment (30 +/- 6 mmHg C-M; 30 +/- 6 mmHg, SR-M). During chronic metoprolol treatment a certain % HRmax corresponded to a higher % Wmax than during placebo treatment, but the shift appeared to be of minor practical importance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "48": "In an observer-blind, randomised cross-over trial, in 12 patients, the effects on the peripheral circulation of antihypertensive doses of atenolol, labetalol and propranolol and placebo were compared. After a placebo period of at least 4 weeks, patients were allocated at random to one of the three active drug treatments. After active treatment for at least 6 weeks and a fall in diastolic pressure (DP) to less than 90 mmHg subjects were switched to the next medication. At the end of each period, photo-electric plethysmography (PHELP) was done on all fingers of one hand cooled over 4 min in water in steps of 3 degrees C from 33 degrees to 12 degrees C, and subsequently warmed in room air (20 degrees C) for a period of 10 min. Blood flow changes during cooling were expressed as a percentage of the initial PHELP value (% PHELP). Areas under the curves, representing the % PHELP/cooling period and % PHELP/warming-up period, showed that within the temperature range normally encountered in daily life, labetalol preserved finger blood flow significantly better than propranolol and marginally better than placebo. With atenolol, finger blood flow was not significantly different from that during the three other regimens, but there were significantly fewer other side-effects. It is concluded that labetalol may be the drug of choice for hypertensive patients treated with beta-blocking agents whose peripheral arterial circulation seems inadequate at low temperatures.", 
    "49": "In a placebo controlled exercise protocol using healthy volunteers the effects of nadolol 80 mg and 160 mg orally and of nadolol 80 mg during treatment with nifedipine 20 mg 8 hourly were compared. Resting systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced by both nifedipine (p less than 0.05) and nadolol (p less than 0.01) acting alone. An unexpected finding was that nifedipine alone significantly inhibited exercise tachycardia (p less than 0.01) (8 to 12 h post dose). Predictably both doses of nadolol produced significant reduction in exercise tachycardia which was still apparent at 24 h. There was a linear relationship between log10 plasma nadolol concentration and reduction in exercise heart rate. The combined inhibitory effects of nifedipine and nadolol 80 mg on exercise heart rate showed partial additivity but did not summate. There was no pharmacokinetic interaction between the 2 drugs. The inhibition of exercise tachycardia by nifedipine, not previously documented, is consistent with an effect of the drug on the sinus node, as has been reported in in-vitro studies, and may contribute to the drugs efficacy in angina.", 
    "50": "The effect of atenolol on the total elimination of disopyramide and its main dealkylated metabolite was studied in 6 patients and 3 volunteers. During administration of 50 mg atenolol b.i.d. the clearance of disopyramide decreased significantly (p less than 0.02) from 1.90 +/- 0.71 (mean +/- SD) to 1.59 +/- 0.68 ml/kg/min, while its half-life, concentration of the metabolite, and the volume of distribution remained unchanged. The reduction in the clearance of disopyramide by atenolol might contribute to the alleged pharmacodynamic interaction between disopyramide and beta-blocking drugs.", 
    "51": "Twenty-four hypertensive patients have been studied. All had blood pressure recordings greater than 160/95 mmHg on 3 occasions whilst taking a beta blocker and two other antihypertensive agents in therapeutic doses. Compliance was checked by intermittent urine analysis for the relevant beta-blocker. These difficult to control hypertensives were treated with nadolol alone, nadolol plus indapamide and nadolol plus xipamide each for 2 months in random order. The aim was to reduce the blood pressure to below 160/95 mmHg. The supine blood pressure on nadolol alone (167/100 mmHg) was comparable to that on the previous three drug regimens (157/100 mmHg), the other two treatments were more effective (145/90 and 148/93 mmHg respectively). Hypokalaemia (serum potassium below 3.5 mmol/l) occurred in six individuals but occurred more frequently on xipamide than on indapamide.", 
    "52": "In 20 patients with long-standing essential hypertension, a comparison was made in a randomized cross-over study of the effect of once and twice daily prazosin administration on blood pressure levels. Concurrent medication (beta-blocker and/or saluretic once daily) remained constant throughout the study. Blood pressure measurements were carried out by a nurse using a Hawksley random zero sphygmomanometer, both in the clinic and at home, and using a Roche Kontron Arteriosonde SR-2 at home. Observations made in the morning and in the evening showed no significant difference in blood pressure between the once and twice daily treatments. Eight patients complained of dizziness and faintness half an hour after taking the once daily dose. However, they felt quite well on the twice daily regimen. The mean daily dose in these 8 patients was prazosin 8.4 mg, range 6-12 mg. No indication was found that the subjective adverse side effects were correlated with the serum prazosin level. The complaints noted may possibly be overcome by taking the once daily dose late in the evening, just before retiring. Better still, the development of a slow-release formulation for daily dosages of 6 mg and over is suggested.", 
    "53": "The binding of propranolol, a drug commonly used in cardiovascular disorders, to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) was studied in vitro in malnutrition. Compared to normal and hospital controls, the level of AGP was found to be elevated in undernourished subjects with and without infection. In the same patients the free drug percentage was significantly diminished. A significant inverse relationship was observed between the percentage of free drug and the level of AGP. The finding suggests that there may be need for an altered dosage regimen in the undernourished.", 
    "54": "High doses of propranolol administered to rats during pregnancy and lactation cause inhibition of growth of the neonatal rats. Growth remains inhibited if drug treatment is continued after weaning. Cessation of drug administration after weaning leads to a nearly normal growth rate but a relatively long period elapses before normal weight is attained. The administration of large doses of propranolol to young growing rats also causes inhibition of growth. This inhibition is quickly reversed upon cessation of drug treatment.", 
    "55": "The combined use of some beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents with calcium channel blockers may cause adverse pharmacodynamic drug interactions: hypotension, heart block or even asystole may be precipitated. The electrophysiological effects of combined administration of intravenous metoprolol 10mg and the vasodilating calcium antagonist felodipine (0.1 mg/kg/bodyweight) were assessed in an open study by invasive methods. Following metoprolol, the heart rate was reduced from 69 +/- 24 to 60 +/- 16 beats/min (mean +/- SD, p less than 0.05) with a minor prolongation of the sinus node recovery time. The A-H interval was increased from 94 +/- 25 to 109 +/- 16 msec (p less than 0.005) and the H-V interval was unchanged. The effective refractory period of the atrioventricular node was prolonged from 327 +/- 54 to 361 +/- 62 msec (p less than 0.01) with a minor prolongation of the effective refractory period of the ventricular Purkinje fibres. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures showed a mean reduction of 11 (p less than 0.001) and 6mm Hg (p less than 0.05), respectively. Following felodipine, the changes in heart rate and effective refractory periods of the atrioventricular node and ventricular Purkinje fibres returned towards control values. No further prolongation of the A-H interval resulted and further blood pressure changes were minor. The absence of adverse haemodynamic or electrophysiological effects suggests that this combination of agents may be safely used.", 
    "56": "In a single-blind randomised study in 9 healthy men we compared the acute haemodynamic effects of the calcium antagonists felodipine and verapamil, singly and in combination with metoprolol. Three different cumulative intravenous doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 1.5 mg felodipine and of 2.0, 4.0 and 8.0 mg verapamil or placebo were given as constant infusions over 5 minutes on 3 occasions and were followed by intravenous metoprolol (15 mg). Felodipine caused a significant and dose-dependent decrease in the total peripheral resistance, and an increase in the forearm blood flow by 8, 48 and 163% with progressively increasing doses showing that the drug is a potent arteriolar vasodilator. A significant and dose-dependent increase in heart rate and a decrease in the pre-ejection period/left ventricular ejection time (PEP/LVET) ratio of up to 15% was also recorded, mainly reflecting a reflexogenic increase in the sympathetic tone. Total peripheral resistance, forearm blood flow, heart rate and the systolic time intervals were mainly unchanged after verapamil, whereas the PQ interval was prolonged. Metoprolol given after the 2 calcium antagonists caused a decrease in heart rate and blood flow and an increase in the total peripheral resistance and PEP/LVET ratio. The tolerability was good to all infusions.", 
    "57": "The antihypertensive and vasodilator effects of felodipine, a new calcium antagonist of the dihydropyridine group, were examined in 15 patients with moderate to severe hypertension. Flow was measured simultaneously at the calf and finger using a venous occlusion ECG-triggered plethysmograph. Measurements were made at rest, during handgrip and during reactive hyperaemia. Felodipine (12.5 mg, orally) was given after placebo treatment and after 3 weeks' treatment with metoprolol. It was also given for 3 weeks in combination with metoprolol. Felodipine caused a significant decrease in blood pressure which was similar in the supine, sitting and standing positions without causing any orthostatic reaction. The antihypertensive effect was accompanied by an increase in heart rate, dilatation of calf arteries and, to a lesser degree, dilatation of finger arteries. However, the degree of vasodilatation diminished with long term treatment. Metoprolol prevented the increase in heart rate but not vasodilatation. Felodipine decreased the potential for further dilatation in certain situations, as shown during reactive hyperaemia, although vasoconstrictor responses during the handgrip test remained unimpaired.", 
    "58": "The antihypertensive drugs dihydralazine and propranolol can produce identical liver injuries which must be distinguished clinically and morphologically from acute viral hepatitis. In 19 cases selected from our biopsy file during the last two years, clinical and morphological findings suggested that the liver injury diagnosed by light microscopy had been caused by an adverse reaction to dihydralazine and/or propranolol. In order to establish a causal relation the lymphocyte proliferation test (LPT) was performed with dihydralazine in 11 cases. Positive results were observed in 9 cases, demonstrating an etiologic role for dihydralazine in liver injury in these cases. The dihydralazine and/or propranolol induced liver injury consisted mainly of drug-induced hepatitis with confluent (bridging) necrosis. Different findings were observed in three cases: In two of these drug-induced hepatitis with confluent necrosis was observed together with eosinophilic cholangio-cholangiolitis. In one other case the histologic changes corresponded to drug hepatitis resembling viral hepatitis. Each of the three cases showed conspicuous centrolobular cholestasis, a feature which is unusual in drug-induced hepatitis with confluent necrosis irrespective of serum bilirubin levels. In one third of our cases we found morphological features of hypersensitivity reactions in the liver biopsies. Considered together with the results of LPT these features emphasize the role of cell mediated immune reaction in the mechanism of liver injury caused by dihydralazine and/or propranolol.", 
    "59": "It is referred to the importance of bicycle-ergometric examinations for a better recognition of the hypertension with limiting value and the labile hypertension. According to time of day and the physical and psychic condition very different blood pressure values can be measured. Therefore, from this point of view blood pressure values may be compared only on the same exterior and interior conditions. The interior conditions are only little to be influenced. A standardized test method, as it is the bicycle ergometry, therefore under the same exterior conditions guarantees comparable and above all reproducible blood pressure values. Also the success of therapy under antihypertensive drugs and thus the prognosis can exactly be classified after these examinations. Furthermore it could be shown that the behaviour of the blood pressure under ergometric load with and without beta-receptor blocker is approximately the same.", 
    "60": "A study was made of the binding of 125I-triiodothyronine with the sections, nuclei and mitochondria of the euthyroid thyroid under the conditions of adding adrenergic agents, cooling to 0 degree C and freezing to--196 degrees C. It was noted that 125I-T3 got no less with adding unlabeled T3 and thyroxine that might suggest the unsaturated nature of the process. Among the studied adrenergic agents (noradrenaline, neoepinephrine, propranolol, pyrroxane in the concentration of 1 X 10(-4) M) noradrenaline only influenced this process. It stimulated binding and pyrroxane inhibited it. 125I-T3 binding got less at 0 degree C, after freezing to--196 degrees C the preservation of the basal activity of the process and disappearance of the noradrenaline stimulating effect were noted. The results obtained do not confirm assumptions as to the mechanism of thyroid autoregulation function with T3 by the short feedback type.", 
    "61": "The effects of pilocarpine, isoproterenol, epinephrine, timolol, acetazolamide, ouabain, and dinitrophenol on aqueous humor production were investigated in enucleated rabbit eye. The metabolic inhibitors ouabain and dinitrophenol at a concentration of 10(-5) M produced a 50% inhibition in aqueous humor formation. Acetazolamide at the same concentration was without effect, but at 10(-4) M concentration lowered aqueous production by 40%. The autonomic drugs epinephrine and isoproteranol at a concentration of 10 micrograms/ml medium reduced aqueous humor formation by 64 and 52% respectively. Timolol, even at a concentration of 0.05 microgram/ml, suppressed aqueous humor formation by approximately 30%. Pilocarpine on the other hand was ineffective. Except for pilocarpine, these responses are similar to those reported to occur in the cat both in vivo and in vitro.", 
    "62": "The effects of the organic calcium antagonist diltiazem (DIL) upon the alterations in renal hemodynamics produced by norepinephrine (NE) were assessed in the isolated perfused rat kidney. In the presence of propranolol, the administration of NE (3 X 10(-7)M) caused sustained reductions in renal perfusate flow (RPF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The administration of 10(-5) M DIL to NE-treated kidneys did not reverse the NE-induced decrease in RPF. In contrast, DIL produced a striking reversal of the NE-induced decrease in GFR. In the absence of NE-treatment, DIL did not alter GFR or RPF. We conclude that NE-induced constriction of major postglomerular resistance vessels of the rat kidney is not inhibited by DIL. In contrast, the DIL-induced increase in GFR of the NE-treated kidneys indicates that the NE-constriction of preglomerular resistance vessels is inhibited by this organic Ca entry blocker. Under identical conditions, manganese, an inorganic calcium entry blocker, reversed the NE-induced reductions in both RPF and GFR, indicating that although both responses depend upon Ca entry, only the latter is sensitive to DIL. These data are, therefore, consistent with the postulate that different regions of the renal vasculature are heterogeneous with regard to the mechanisms mediating NE-induced vasoconstriction.", 
    "63": "The influence of a course therapy with anaprilin alone on the peripheral circulation in patients with essential hypertension of the early stages was investigated. Anaprilin was shown to have a significant effect on the peripheral blood circulation in the skeletal muscles expressed as veno- and artery dilatation, with the predominance of the former.", 
    "64": "Autonomic control of resting heart rate was assessed using atropine and propranolol in 20 neonatal (2 to 3 weeks old) male Rhesus monkeys. After release from restraint for placement of a venous catheter, the average heart rate significantly decreased from 220 +/- 7 beats/min to 181 +/- 6 beats/min within 15 minutes and remained stable for the 2 hours. Autonomic control of resting heart rate is mediated through both divisions of the autonomic nervous system with the sympathetic system having a dominant influence. This is in contrast to the adult Rhesus, where the parasympathetic nervous system controls resting heart rate.", 
    "65": "Oxprenolol (1), like related beta-adrenergic antagonists, undergoes oxidative N-dealkylation to form the corresponding 3-aryloxypropane-1,2-diol (2), 3-aryloxylactic acid (3), and 2-aryloxyacetic acid (4) metabolites. Compounds 3 and 4 were synthesized by conversion of 2-allyloxyphenol (5) to the aryloxyacetaldehyde 6 and subsequent elaboration to the desired acids. Both acids (3 and 4) and glycol 2 were confirmed as metabolites formed from 1 in vivo in the rat and in vitro in the rat liver 9000 X g supernatant fraction. Incubation of a pseudoracemate of 1, made up of equal molar amounts of (2S)-1-d0 and (2R)-1-d2, showed that 2 and 3 arise principally from (2S)-1 by S/R ratios of approximately 5:1 and 2:1, respectively. On the other hand, acetic acid derivative 4 arises about equally from both enantiomers of 1.", 
    "66": "The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of behaviorally conditioned changes in autonomic activity on atrio-ventricular (AV) transmission in dog. To produce consistent activation of the cardiac nerves in the awake animal (n = 7), a classical appetitive conditioning paradigm was used. A conditioning trial consisted of a 30 s control period followed by one of two differing situations: (1) a 60-s conditional stimulus (CS+) tone wherein food (i.e. 'UCS' or unconditioned stimulus) was given during the last 30 s; or (2) at 30-s discriminative stimulus (CS-) tone which was never followed by food reward. Eight of each type trial were given daily until a stereotypic cardiovascular response was developed for the CS+ but not the CS-. The hemodynamic conditional response (i.e. 'CR', the response to the CS+) consisted of a moderate tachycardia (+14.5%, P less than or equal to 0.05), a small pressor response (+6.7%, P less than or equal to 0.01), and a moderate increase in the first time derivative of left ventricular pressure (+14.9%, P less than or equal to 0.01) reflecting an increase in inotropic state. The unconditional response (i.e., 'UCR', the response to the food reward) consisted of a substantial increase in HR (25.7%, P less than or equal to 0.01) above CR values while left ventricular pressure (LVP) and d(LVP)/dt increased 5.0% and 10.0% (P less than or equal to 0.01 for both) above their CR values. The effect of the conditioned changes in neural activity on the AV node was observed by pacing the atrium from 110 to 180 bpm during the first 15 s of each trial period (i.e. control, CS+, UCS). The discrepancy between the atrial pace rate and the transmitted ventricular rate is expressed as a 'mean difference score' and serves as an index of the fidelity of the AV transmission process: the smaller the difference, the closer a 1:1 ratio of atrial vs ventricular beats is approached. The relatively large mean difference score for the control periods (46.0 +/- 9 bpm) indicates that the paced atrial impulse did not faithfully precede ventricular contraction during these periods. The mean difference significantly decreased (34.6%, P less than or equal to 0.05) during the CS+, and approached an almost 1:1 ratio (75.6% decrease from CS+ values, P less than or equal to 0.01) during food delivery. beta-Adrenergic blockade (propranolol, 1 mg/kg, i.v.) eliminated the changes in mean difference during the CS+ but not during food delivery. There were no statistically significant physiological changes during CS-.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "67": "Epinephrine has been implicated in the genesis of some forms of hypertension. We have investigated the effects of epinephrine on vasoconstrictor responses evoked by adrenergic stimuli in the isolated perfused rat kidney. Low concentrations of epinephrine (2.5 - 5 X 10(-9) M) increased the amplitude of vasoconstrictor responses evoked by electrical stimulation of the renal adrenergic nerves. These concentrations of epinephrine had no effect on the basal perfusion pressure of the kidney or on the amplitude of vasoconstrictor responses evoked by exogenous norepinephrine. The potentiating effect of epinephrine persisted after infusion of the amine had ceased. Kidneys that had been perfused with 3H-epinephrine accumulated radioactivity, which could then be released by renal nerve stimulation. Cocaine (3 X 10(-5) M) reduced the renal accumulation of 3H-epinephrine and abolished both the persistent potentiating effect of the amine and the release of radioactivity evoked by subsequent nerve stimulation. The potentiating effect of epinephrine infusion was abolished by the beta 2-selective adrenergic receptor antagonist ICI 118,551 (3 X 10(-8) M), but not by the beta 1-selective adrenergic receptor antagonist atenolol (10(-6) M). These results indicate that concentrations of epinephrine that can be achieved during acute stress can enhance the amplitude of neurogenic vasoconstrictor responses. This effect appears to be mediated via a prejunctional beta 2-adrenergic receptor. The persistent nature of this effect may be due to the neuronal accumulation and subsequent release of epinephrine.", 
    "68": "The local hemodynamic effect of pindolol, a nonselective beta-blocker with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, was investigated in 17 healthy volunteers. Changes in forearm blood flow (FBF) in response to infusion of drugs into the brachial artery were measured by plethysmography. Pindolol increased FBF dose dependently to a maximal value of 62 +/- 8% (mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.001) without inducing changes in heart rate or blood pressure. For a single dose of pindolol the maximal effect on FBF was seen after approximately 4 minutes of infusion, and this effect persisted for at least 12 minutes after the infusion. The pindolol-induced increase in FBF was reduced by concomitant infusion of propranolol (p less than 0.001). Intra-arterial infusion of practolol did not influence FBF. No significant influence of pindolol was found on the vasoconstriction induced by the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor agonist methoxamine, the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor agonist BHT-933, or angiotensin II. Measurement of plasma pindolol concentrations in the venous effluent of the forearm suggested that vasodilatation occurred at drug levels within the therapeutic range. These results indicate that the beta-blocker pindolol has vasodilatory properties owing to stimulation of vascular beta 2-adrenergic receptors and that this effect may be of therapeutic relevance.",

    "70": "A variety of neurological disturbances may occur in patients receiving ocular administration of timolol. Possible mechanisms include direct effects on neurons of the central nervous system, effects on peripheral vasculature, and cardiac arrhythmias. Interestingly, transient ischemic attacks have not been documented to occur synchronously with timolol-related arrhythmias. We report a case of recurrent dizziness and staggering gait occurring synchronously with timolol related arrhythmias. An attack of amaurosis fugax also occurred. Discontinuing timolol abolished all the symptoms. Pre-existing autonomic dysfunction in our patient may have been an important contributing factor in his symptomatology.",

This report summarizes his clinical findings, his response to medical therapy and laser trabeculoplasty, and suggests the possibility that melanosis oculi causes secondary open angle glaucoma in patients who are predisposed to primary open angle glaucoma.", 
    "72": "Thirty-two patients with uncomplicated hyperthyroidism were compared to 17 patients deemed to be suffering from pure thyrotoxic cardiac failure, other heart disease having been excluded. The thyrotoxic failure group were older and had clinically and biochemically milder endocrinal abnormalities for a longer time. Haemodynamic studies at rest and exercise showed that the thyrotoxic failure patients had no functional cardiac reserve. Their response to propranolol indicated that myocardial function was dependent on beta-adrenergic activity. Following specific anti-thyroid medication cardiac function returned to normal in the majority of cases with cardiac failure. This study shows that hyperthyroidism by itself can cause a reversible cardiomyopathy.", 
    "73": "The purpose of the investigation was to evaluate the effects of d-propranolol upon temporary cerebral ischemia followed by a period of reperfusion, that is, a situation analogous to major cerebral artery embolization. Twenty adult cats, lightly anesthesized with nitrous oxide, underwent 4 hours of right middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion and 2 hours of recirculation. Ten cats were untreated and 10 cats received d-propranolol, the weak beta-blocking isomer of racemic (d,l) propranolol. The d-propranolol was infused directly into the right carotid artery at doses of 2 mg/kg, given as a bolus immediately before MCA occlusion, and 0.33 mg/kg/hour, given continuously for 6 hours beginning immediately after MCA occlusion. Systemic arterial blood pressure was similar in both groups, but heart rate was transiently reduced in the treated group immediately after the bolus injection of d-propranolol and MCA occlusion. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), measured by the xenon-133 clearance technique, was not significantly different in the ischemic, right hemisphere. Electroencephalographic (EEG) activity changes in the ischemic, right hemisphere were similar in both groups, but there was significant deterioration of EEG activity in the left, nonischemic hemisphere of untreated cats after MCA reopening. Swelling of the ischemic, right hemispheres was similar in both groups and more severe than in previous studies wherein there was no recirculation phase. Carbon perfusion and blood-brain barrier changes were also similar. The results of the study failed to show a protective effect despite theoretical beneficial actions of d-propranolol. Also, the study demonstrated that d-propranolol does not have a detrimental effect upon rCBF in acute focal cerebral ischemia.", 
    "74": "In a randomized and controlled study (already published) the efficacy and safety of Pindolol eye drops 1% were compared with Timolol eye drops 0.5% in the treatment of open-angle glaucoma over a period of 6 months. With the exception of some allergic reactions there was no difference between the two with regard to IOP and the other parameters documented, such as pulse, blood pressure, visual acuity, refraction, diameter of pupils, tear production, visual field and biomicroscopic and ophthalmoscopic. In this article, the authors report on the results of prolongation of treatment in the 33 patients of the Pindolol group from month 7 to month 12 in an open-case study. The effect on IOP after 12 months was no different from that after month 6. There was no difference with regard to pulse and blood pressure, either. Four patients had to discontinue the treatment, in one case owing to drug-related side effects on the lids and conjunctiva. The other parameters documented (visual acuity, visual field, refraction, diameter of pupils, tear production, corneal sensitivity and biomicroscopic and ophthalmoscopic examination) revealed no difference between the first and the second 6 months. A diminution of the effect of the drug on the level and duration of IOP was ruled out.", 
    "75": "Pindolol, a nonselective beta-adrenergic blocking drug, lowered systolic and diastolic BP equally well during once-daily and twice-daily dosage. Side effects were few. Absence of supine bradycardia distinguished this drug from other beta-adrenergic blockers and likely was attributable to the agent's intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Blood pressure variability was less during therapy. Automatic indirect BP monitoring reliably confirmed office and home BP recordings and indicated good control throughout waking and sleeping periods.", 
    "76": "It can be postulated that inhibition of lung tissue Na+-K+-ATPase might potentiate hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction by depolarizing some excitable cell or, in contrast, that it might blunt the hypoxic response by reducing cellular metabolic rate and sensitivity to hypoxia. Thus the purpose of this study was to test in isolated rat lungs whether hypoxic pressor reactivity was related inversely or positively to Na+-K+-ATPase activity. Dose-pressor response curves to hypoxia, angiotensin II, or KCl were measured under control conditions and after exposure either to one of two inhibitors of Na+-K+-ATPase, ouabain, and low-K+ solution or to a stimulator of Na+-K+ pumping, aldosterone. Ouabain and low K+ depressed the response to hypoxia but had little effect on that to angiotensin II. The response to KCl was increased by ouabain. Aldosterone potentiated the hypoxic response. These results do not support the idea that membrane depolarization due to inhibition Na+-K+ pumping is a component of hypoxic vasoconstriction. They do suggest a positive relationship between Na+-K+-ATPase activity and hypoxic pressor reactivity and are consistent with the idea that Na+-K+-ATPase activity might influence hypoxic reactivity indirectly by altering cellular energy metabolism. It is also possible that the results were somehow due to changes in intracellular [Na+] or transmembrane Na+ gradient, rather than to changes in energy metabolism.", 
    "77": "Spectral analysis of spontaneous heart rate fluctuations were assessed by use of autonomic blocking agents and changes in posture. Low-frequency fluctuations (below 0.12 Hz) in the supine position are mediated entirely by the parasympathetic nervous system. On standing, the low-frequency fluctuations increase and are jointly mediated by the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. High-frequency fluctuations, at the respiratory frequency, are decreased by standing and are mediated solely by the parasympathetic system. Heart rate spectral analysis is a powerful noninvasive tool for quantifying autonomic nervous system activity.", 
    "78": "We examined the relations between bronchial reactivity, baseline FEV1, and annual decline of height corrected FEV1 (delta FEV1/ht3) over 7.5 years in 227 men (117 smokers, 71 ex-smokers, and 39 non-smokers). Men with a clinical diagnosis of asthma or receiving bronchodilator treatment were excluded. Bronchial reactivity was determined as the provocation concentration (PC20) of inhaled histamine sufficient to reduce FEV1 by 20%; subjects were divided into reactors (PC20 less than or equal to 16 mg/ml) and non-reactors (PC20 greater than 16 mg/ml). Thirty per cent of smokers, 24% of ex-smokers, and 5% of non-smokers were reactors. When smokers who were reactors were compared with non-reactors, the reactors showed a lower baseline FEV1 as percentage predicted in 1981-2 (85% v 108%), and a faster delta FEV1/ht3 (14.1 v 9.2 ml/y/m3). Baseline FEV1 correlated with PC20 in both smokers (rs = 0.51) and ex-smokers (rs = 0.61), and all 15 subjects with an FEV1 under 80% of the predicted value were reactors. In ex-smokers delta FEV1/ht3 was similar in reactors and non-reactors (m 9.0 v 7.4 ml/y/m3), despite significant differences in baseline FEV1. When analysis was confined to men with a baseline FEV1 over 80% predicted, the prevalence of reactors was significantly increased among smokers and slightly increased among ex-smokers compared with non-smokers, though the mean FEV1 was higher in the non-smokers. Bronchial reactivity was not increased in smokers aged 35 years or less. In smokers delta FEV1/ht3 was faster in those with a personal history of allergy (usually allergic rhinitis), but was not related to a family history of allergic disease, total serum immunoglobulin E level, absolute blood eosinophil count, or skinprick test score. delta FEV1/ht3 was also faster in all subjects taking beta blocker drugs. Thus increased bronchial reactivity was associated with accelerated decline of FEV1 in smokers. Although the association could be a consequence of a lower lower baseline FEV1, a trend towards increased reactivity was found in smokers with normal baseline FEV1 and delta FEV1/ht3 was dissociated from increased reactivity in ex-smokers. These findings are compatible with the \"Dutch hypothesis,\" but the association between allergic features and accelerated delta FEV1/ht3 was relatively weak, and increased reactivity may follow rather than precede the onset of smoking.", 
    "79": "The nonspecific interactions of propranolol, timolol, and ethanol with model and sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes were determined utilizing radioisotopic association differential scanning calorimetry, and neutron diffraction. Differential scanning calorimetry performed on mixtures of these amphiphilic compounds and model membrane bilayers composed of dimyristoyllecithin showed that propranolol was approximately 25 times more lipid-soluble than timolol and at least 100 times more lipid-soluble than ethanol. Neutron diffraction showed that the solvation of propranolol was within the fatty acyl chain region of the lipid bilayer. This solvation correlated with the effect of propranolol to inhibit ATP-dependent calcium transport in isolated rabbit skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum, a membrane that lacks beta-adrenergic receptors. In contrast, the major site of interaction of ethanol was within the aqueous compartment hydrating the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. A model for nonspecific drug interaction with the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane based on the site of interaction of these amphiphiles and their relative potencies to inhibit calcium transport by these membranes is proposed. In principle, this model could be extended to specific drug interactions with membranes.", 
    "80": "The symptom limited maximal exercise was performed by a supine bicycle ergometer before and 12 weeks after oral carteolol therapy in 10 patients with essential hypertension of WHO Stage 1 and 2. At rest, arterial blood pressure (BP) and venous pressure (VP) significantly declined after therapy, while heart rate (HR), cardiac index (CI), stroke index (SI) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) were not significantly changed. The maximal exercise work of post-therapy was similar to that of pre-therapy in 9 patients and increased in one. When compared with the pre-therapy values at each work load of exercise, carteolol caused significant decreases in systolic BP, mean BP, HR and CI, and a significant increase in SVR, while SI and VP were not significantly changed. Plasma levels of renin activity, aldosterone, and catecholamines were not altered by carteolol throughout the study at rest and with exercise. It may be concluded that the inhibition of HR increase by carteolol results in a reduced cardiac output during moderate and severe exercise and then suppresses the elevation of BP, so that carteolol makes it possible to achieve more exercise with less cardiac work.", 
    "81": "Intra-arterial blood pressure recordings were studied in 10 ambulant subjects with essential hypertension to evaluate the effect of a single daily dose of acebutolol. Blood pressures and heart rates, measured on a beat-to-beat basis were averaged over every hour, for the daytime, night-time, and for the total 24 hours. Acebutolol significantly lowered the average daytime systolic pressure (160 to 142 mmHg, p = less than 0.01), diastolic pressure (78 to 66 mmHg, p = less than 0.01), and the heart rate (92 to 77 beats/min, p = less than 0.001). Significantly lower pressures were demonstrated up to 11 hours after the last dose of acebutolol. The effect on heart rate lasted up to 13 hours. The observed lowering of pressures and heart rate during the remaining 11 hours did not reach statistical significance.", 
    "82": "The accumulation of (-)-3H-adrenaline (3H-A) by rabbit isolated aorta was studied. In all experiments, monoamine oxidase and catechol-O-methyltransferase were inhibited by treatment with pargyline and 3',4'-dihydroxy-2-methyl-propiophenone (U-0521), respectively. The relationship between the accumulation of 3H derived from 3H-A (10(-8) M) and the duration of incubation (0-3 h) was linear. The 3H-accumulation after 3 h incubation was 22.5 ml X g-1. In reserpine-treated tissue, the 3H-accumulation levelled off after 30 min and was 8.5 ml X g-1 after 3 h. The concentration of 3H-A or (-)-3H-noradrenaline (3H-NA) and the 3H-accumulation (ml X g-1) were inversely related. At 10(-8) M, the 1-hour accumulation of 3H derived from 3H-A and 3H-NA was 7.8 and 15.2 ml X g-1, respectively. With increasing concentrations (3 X 10(-8)-10(-4) M), the accumulation values approached each other. At 10(-4) M, the accumulation was 2.3 and 2.8 ml X g-1 for 3H-A and 3H-NA, respectively. The accumulation of 3H derived from 3H-A (10(-8)-10(-4) M) by reserpine-treated tissue also showed an inverse relationship with concentration: 5.4 ml X g-1 (10(-8) M) and 2.6 ml X g-1 (10(-4) M). The accumulation of 3H derived from 3H-A (10(-8) M; 1 h) was dependent on the bath temperature (1-37 degrees C). The accumulation increased continuously from 1.1 ml X g-1 (1 degree C) to 11.1 ml X g-1 (37 degrees C). Storage of tissue (0-5 days in salt solution without equilibration with 95% O2/5% CO2; 4 degrees C) did not affect the accumulation of 3H derived from 3H-A (10(-8) M; 1 h). Thereafter (7-14 days), the accumulation decreased. The inhibitory potency (IC50;-log M) of desimipramine, cocaine, (-)-propranolol, (-)-isoprenaline, and (+/-)-normetanephrine on accumulation of 3H derived from 3H-A (10(-8) M; 1 h) was found to be 8.26; 6.50; 5.48, 4.88, and 4.02, respectively. The maximal degree of inhibition was almost the same for these drugs, while that of clonidine and corticosterone was 50 and 20%, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "83": "A sensitive, specific assay utilizing fluorescence-HPLC has been developed for determining the 1'-hydroxylation of bufuralol by human liver. The 1'-hydroxylation of the isomers of bufuralol varied threefold, both the Vmax and the Km for the (+) isomer being greater than the corresponding values for the (-) isomer. Debrisoquine was a competitive inhibitor of the 1'-hydroxylation of both isomers and of the racemate of bufuralol. Both isomers and the racemate of bufuralol were competitive inhibitors of debrisoquine 4-hydroxylase activity. The competitive inhibition of debrisoquine and bufuralol of each other's metabolism, together with the similarity in the values for Km and Ki, support the conclusion that the same form of cytochrome P-450 catalyses these two reactions.",

Propranolol decreased the migraine index more than 70% in 13 patients: five patients at a dosage of 40 mg/day, five patients at a dosage of 120 mg/day, and three patients at a dosage of 240 mg/day. Three patients did not achieve a good improvement of migraine at any of the doses used. The relief of migraine was not directly related to the propranolol and 4-hydroxypropranolol plasma concentrations.", 
    "85": "We describe the occurrence of hyperkalemia in a stable hemodialysis patient who developed digoxin toxicity. The patient had been receiving digoxin for 2 years. His maintenance digoxin dose was increased from 0.125 to 0.25 mg three times a week, which resulted in a toxic serum level of 4.9 ng/mL (therapeutic range is 0.8 to 2.0 ng/mL). As a consequence of the digoxin toxicity, he became hyperkalemic (7.8 mEq/L), and this value returned to normal only after the digoxin level was lowered by a combination of oral charcoal and dialysis. This study shows how readily hyperkalemia can occur in an anephric patient manifesting digoxin toxicity. Thus, potentially lethal hyperkalemia can occur in hemodialysis patients who ingest therapeutic quantities of digoxin. Digoxin toxicity should be added to the differential diagnosis of hyperkalemia in patients with renal failure. This can occur despite the absence of a history of massive ingestion of a cardiac glycoside."
