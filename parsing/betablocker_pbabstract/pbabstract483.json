    "0": "The stereoselective formation of 4'-hydroxypropranolol sulfate (HOPS) from racemic 4'-hydroxypropranolol (HOP) has been investigated using canine hepatic cytosol and partially purified phenolsulfotransferases (PSTs). Pseudo first order rate constants, Vmax/Kmapp, were significantly greater (P less than .05) for the formation of R-HOPS by canine hepatic cytosol, S/R-HOPS = 0.72. Moreover, double reciprocal replots for the sulfation of both HOP enantiomers were biphasic, suggesting the presence of multiple PST enzymes. Pentachlorophenol (PCP) inhibited the sulfation of both HOP enantiomers with an IC50 of 244 nM, suggesting that phenol (P) forms of the PST enzymes may be primarily responsible for the cytosolic sulfation. Three distinct PST fractions were partially purified from the cytosol and were found to possess unique stereoselectivities toward HOP. Fraction 1 was most stereoselective, S/R-HOPS = 0.51, but was not inhibited by PCP, suggesting that it is a monoamine (M) form PST. Fraction 3 was the most active fraction and mimicked the cytosol in both stereoselectivity, S/R-HOPS = 0.73 vs. 0.72, and susceptibility to PCP inhibition, IC50 = 93 nM. The S/R-HOPS ratio produced by fraction 2 was 0.63. These data demonstrate the presence of multiple PST enzymes with differing stereoselectivities for the enantiomers of HOP in canine hepatic cytosol. Further studies with homogeneous PST isozymes, ideally from human tissue, and other chiral drugs are needed to define the enzymatic mechanism of this reaction and its role in chiral drug metabolism.", 
    "1": "Intrastriatal administration of the hydroxylated metabolites of amphetamine, p-hydroxyamphetamine (p-OHA) or p-hydroxy-norephedrine (p-OHNor), decreased local concentrations of dopamine and serotonin in a dose-dependent manner. Although both compounds reduced concentrations of the metabolites of dopamine, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentrations were elevated. After systemic treatment with p-OHA, striatal dopamine was also reduced. In contrast, only hypothalamic and hippocampal serotonin stores were altered significantly in rats treated with p-OHA systemically. Neither compound decreased the activities of tryptophan hydroxylase or tyrosine hydroxylase. Because p-OHA is metabolized to p-OHNor via dopamine beta-hydroxylase present in noradrenergic neurons, the direct effects of these compounds on dopaminergic and serotonergic variables can be observed in rats which receive intrastriatal drug treatment. p-OHA and p-OHNor were equally potent in decreasing dopamine concentrations. However, p-OHNor was more potent than p-OHA in decreasing serotonin concentrations. Both compounds more readily depleted dopamine compared to serotonin stores. Complete recovery of p-OHA-induced decreases in striatal dopamine occurred within 48 hr of intrastriatal administration and concurrent treatment with the dopamine uptake blocker, amfonelic acid, significantly attenuated the p-OHA-induced effects on dopamine.", 
    "2": "One hundred fifty-eight patients were evaluated because of symptoms of potentially fatal venom anaphylaxis, as defined by hypotension, including loss of consciousness (LOC), throat/laryngeal edema, or marked respiratory distress. The demographic characteristics were 118 male and 40 female patients; age range, 3 to 80 years; mean, 29.7 years; 33 patients less than 10 years; and incidence of atopy, 20%. One hundred twenty-seven patients had had prior stings; 27 had prior systemic reactions (SR), including one with LOC. Almost all patients had venom-specific IgE; RAST titers covered a wide range. As compared to the total group, the subset of 45 patients with LOC were older, had an increased incidence of cardiac disease and beta-blocker use, stings in the head area, and re-sting reactions in patients who did not receive venom immunotherapy (VIT). One hundred six re-stings occurred in 37 patients receiving VIT with no SR. There were 38 re-stings in 18 patients who refused VIT, with 14 SRs in 11 patients. These studies suggest no distinguishing characteristics, including age, that would identify patients susceptible to severe venom anaphylaxis and confirm the prophylactic effectiveness of VIT.", 
    "3": "The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of dilevalol, the R,R stereoisomer of labetalol, were evaluated in nine subjects. Dilevalol was given as a single 50 mg intravenous dose and as a 400 mg daily oral dose for 7 days. To study the effects of hepatic enzyme inhibition, each subject received dilevalol in the presence of and absence of cimetidine. Cardiac beta-blockade was assessed by use of standardized treadmill tests for 48 hours after oral dilevalol. The three-compartment model analysis showed that systemic clearance (29.8 +/- 5.7 ml/min/kg), volume of distribution (16.6 +/- 4.1 L/kg), and terminal half-life (11.7 +/- 2.7 hours) were not altered by cimetidine. However, there was a 20% increase in the area under the curve (p less than 0.05) and an 11% increase in systemic bioavailability (p less than 0.05) after oral administration. Dilevalol caused significant cardiac beta-blockade for more than 24 hours, but these effects were not altered by cimetidine. The pharmacokinetic changes are consistent with a decrease in first-pass extraction of a high clearance drug.", 
    "4": "The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of intravenous atenolol were studied in 10 children during cardiac electrophysiologic studies. The intravenous pharmacokinetic data were best described by a two-compartment model and revealed the following (mean +/- SD): total body clearance, 0.15 +/- 0.06 L/hr/kg; volume of the central compartment 0.33 +/- 0.06 L/kg; volume of distribution at steady state, 0.83 +/- 0.15 L/kg; distributive elimination half-life, 0.29 +/- 0.08 hour; and terminal elimination half-life, 4.56 +/- 1.05 hours. The data suggest that children have a slightly shorter terminal elimination half-life than that of adults. Pharmacodynamic data showed a significantly (p less than 0.01) increased sinus cycle length and an increase in His to ventricle conduction time (p less than 0.05). Further studies are necessary to determine the optimal oral dose and dosing frequency of atenolol and to access the response of children to long-term treatment.", 
    "5": "Labetalol is an alpha 1- and beta-adrenergic antagonist currently used in the treatment of hypertension. Studies which have evaluated the effects of age on its pharmacokinetics have yielded conflicting results. The purpose of this study is to comprehensively re-evaluate the effect of age on the elimination of labetalol. Data were obtained from 4 single-dose and 3 multiple-dose studies of the pharmacokinetics of the drug. An analysis of covariance was performed on the single-dose data to determine whether the type of subject evaluated (normotensive vs hypertensive), type of assay methodology used and/or age were significant factors affecting labetalol clearance estimates. A similar covariance procedure was used for the multiple-dose data, to assess whether the type of subject, duration of treatment and/or age were significant variables affecting labetalol elimination. Subsequent to the analysis of covariance, linear regression and correlation analysis was used to evaluate the effects of age on labetalol clearance. A modest though significant relationship was observed between the apparent oral clearance of the drug and age; it appeared slightly stronger when clearance was normalised for bodyweight. No relationship was found following multiple doses of the drug. Hence, age does not appear to be a significant factor affecting the oral clearance of labetalol, particularly in individuals receiving the drug in the long term.", 
    "6": "The effects of MgSO4 or MgCl2 infusion on the duration of epinephrine-induced cardiac arrhythmia were evaluated in male rats anesthetized with either halothane or pentobarbital. In addition, the duration of epinephrine-induced arrhythmia in pentobarbital (50 mg/kg) anesthetized rats was compared with the duration of arrhythmia in halothane (1.5%) anesthetized rats. During halothane anesthesia MgSO4 or MgCl2 infused at a dose rate of 8 mg.kg-1.min-1 for 20 min caused a significant reduction in the duration of arrhythmia (100% and 80%, respectively) following a 4-microgram/kg injection of epinephrine and a significant threefold reduction in arrhythmia duration for each salt following an 8- or 16-micrograms/kg injection of epinephrine. Significantly shorter periods of arrhythmia after each dose of epinephrine were seen in rats anesthetized with pentobarbital than were seen in rats anesthetized with halothane. No significant difference was seen between MgSO4 or MgCl2 infusions in any of these studies. Twenty-minute infusions of MgSO4 (8 mg.kg-1.min-1) were compared with propranolol (0.03 mg.kg-1.min-1) and verapamil (0.5 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) infusions on the duration of arrhythmia after epinephrine (8 micrograms/kg) injections in halothane anesthetized rats. MgSO4 and propranolol infusion caused a significant reduction in the duration of arrhythmia (81% and 70%, respectively). Verapamil infusion caused only a 48% reduction in arrhythmia duration. While there was no significant difference between MgSO4 or propranolol, both caused a significantly greater reduction in arrhythmia than verapamil. CaCl2 (0.15 mM.kg-1.min-1) infusion for 5 min caused a significant fivefold increase in the duration of arrhythmia during halothane anesthesia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "7": "The efficacy of intravenous propranolol for suppression of inducibility of sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VT) was studied in 24 patients who had failed greater than or equal to 1 membrane-active antiarrhythmic drug (mean 2.2 +/- 1.2 drugs/patient). The response to propranolol was compared in 13 patients who had only stable monomorphic VTs inducible at baseline and another 11 patients who had greater than or equal to 1 episode of electrically unstable VTs (polymorphic VT, ventricular flutter or ventricular fibrillation) at baseline. Seven patients (29%) became noninducible (responders) and 17 patients (71%) remained inducible to sustained VT (nonresponders) after propranolol. The basal heart rate was faster in responders than in nonresponders (101 +/- 14 vs 86 +/- 11 beats/min, p less than 0.01). The magnitude of heart rate reduction was also greater after propranolol in responders (from 101 +/- 14 to 80 +/- 9 beats/min, p less than 0.001) than in nonresponders (from 86 +/- 11 to 74 +/- 9 beats/min, p less than 0.01) (p less than 0.05 between the groups), despite equal plasma propranolol concentrations (84 +/- 50 vs 88 +/- 43 ng/ml, difference not significant). Seven of 11 patients (64%) who had greater than or equal to 1 episode of unstable VTs inducible at baseline responded to intravenous propranolol, whereas none of the patients with only stable monomorphic VTs became noninducible after beta blockade (p less than 0.001). Responders had shorter cycle length of inducible VTs than nonresponders (225 +/- 38 vs 302 +/- 66 ms, p less than 0.001). Thus, intravenous propranolol appears to be efficacious in suppressing fast, electrically unstable VTs, compared to monomorphic VTs with slower rates.", 
    "8": "We studied the acute and chronic effects of propranolol and primidone in essential tremor by administering long-acting propranolol (80 to 160 mg/d) and primidone (50 to 250 mg/d) to 50 patients. We evaluated patients at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after treatment and assessed tremor by subjective rating by patients, clinical scoring, and thermographic (accelerometer) recordings. Acute adverse reactions occurred in 8% with propranolol and 32% with primidone. Propranolol was without therapeutic effect in 30%, and 32% had no benefit from primidone. Significant chronic side effects occurred in 17% taking propranolol and in 0% with primidone. Tolerance to drug effect occurred with chronic treatment in 12.5% of patients with propranolol and 13.0% with primidone. We conclude that propranolol and primidone are effective long-term treatment for some patients with essential tremor. Acute adverse reactions with primidone and side effects with chronic use of propranolol hamper therapy.", 
    "9": "Propranolol decreases portal pressure by reducing portal blood inflow. Studies in rats with prehepatic portal hypertension due to portal vein stenosis (a model with extensive portosystemic shunting) have shown that propranolol increases the portocollateral resistance, which hinders the fall in portal pressure. The present study examined the effects of propranolol on splanchnic and systemic hemodynamics in rats with portal hypertension due to cirrhosis of the liver, a model which is characterized by mild portosystemic shunting. Two groups of rats with CCl4-induced cirrhosis were studied: the propranolol group (n = 8), which received a propranolol infusion of 2 mg per 15 min, and controls (n = 9), which received a placebo (saline) infusion. Hemodynamic measurements were done using radiolabeled microspheres. Propranolol-treated rats had significantly lower cardiac output (-31%) and heart rate (-26%) than controls (p less than 0.001). Hepatic artery flow was not modified by propranolol. Propranolol caused splanchnic vasoconstriction, manifested by increased splanchnic resistance (+57%) and by a significant fall in portal blood inflow (4.8 +/- 0.4 vs. 6.3 +/- 0.5 ml per min.100 gm in controls, p less than 0.05). In contrast with rats with prehepatic portal hypertension, propranolol did not increase portal resistance in cirrhotic rats [2.0 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.0 +/- 0.1 mmHg per ml per min.100 gm body weight (not significant)]. Hence, the fall in portal pressure (-19%) was expected from the decrease in portal inflow (-24%). These results suggest that increased portal resistance in rats with prehepatic portal hypertension may represent an intrinsic effect of propranolol on the portocollateral vessels, since beta-blockade does not modify portal vascular resistance in cirrhosis.", 
    "10": "Three models of altered autonomic innervation of the chick heart have been developed in the last few years. These include sympathetically aneural heart, parasympathetically aneural heart, and heart with cholinergic innervation reconstituted from the nodose placodes. The neural status of these hearts has been assessed by a variety of morphological and biochemical methods, but the functional status of innervation is not known. In the present study, we have used electrocardiography and field stimulation to determine the functional neural status of the three different innervation models. The RR and QTc intervals were measured to assess the dominant autonomic tone and autonomic dysfunction in the heart. Even though the RR and QTc intervals were found to be identical in sham and experimental embryos, field stimulation of superfused atria showed that the sympathetically aneural heart has functional cholinergic innervation but lacks any sympathetic response. Hearts from embryos which were parasympathetically aneural lacked a cholinergic response to field stimulation and were judged to be functionally parasympathetically aneural. Hearts with cholinergic ganglia reconstituted from the nodose placodes have normal RR and QTc intervals as well as a normal cholinergic response to field stimulation. The results indicate that these neurons are functionally indistinguishable from neural crest-derived neurons.", 
    "11": "Neuropeptide Y (NPY) attenuates vagal effects on cardiac cycle length, presumably by inhibiting the release of acetylcholine from vagal nerve endings. We sought to determine if NPY inhibited the vagal effects on atrioventricular (AV) interval and atrial contraction in a manner similar to its inhibition of the vagal effects on cycle length. In 19 anesthetized dogs we measured the vagal effects on cycle length, AV interval, and atrial contraction before and after 3-minute trains of sympathetic stimulation or before and after exogenous NPY (20 micrograms/kg i.v.). Three minutes after 10-Hz sympathetic stimulation, the vagal effects on cycle length and AV interval were attenuated by 52 +/- 9% and 63 +/- 8%, respectively. Phentolamine significantly augmented this attenuation, but propranolol had no appreciable effect. In the control group of animals or in the group that received phentolamine, the vagal effects on atrial contraction measured before and after sympathetic stimulation were not significantly different. In these two groups, however, the basal atrial contraction was reduced substantially after the cessation of sympathetic stimulation. Propranolol prevented this reduction in atrial contraction. After propranolol, the vagal effects on atrial contraction 3 minutes after sympathetic stimulation were attenuated by 31 +/- 6%. Exogenous NPY had no direct effect on cycle length, AV interval, or atrial contraction, but exogenous NPY did persistently inhibit the vagal effects on each of these cardiac processes. Three minutes after NPY was given, the vagal effects on cycle length, AV interval, and atrial contraction were inhibited by 62 +/- 7%, 69 +/- 5%, and 68 +/- 5%, respectively. We conclude that NPY attenuates the vagal effects on the atrial myocardium and on the sinus and AV nodes. In the absence of beta-blockade, the inhibitory effect of neurally released NPY on the vagally induced decreases in atrial contraction may be masked by the reduction in the atrial contraction that occurs after sympathetic stimulation.", 
    "12": "The authors studied the effects of withdrawing oral diltiazem therapy on the subsequent course of coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Patients with severe coronary artery disease were divided into three groups using a prospective, controlled, randomized protocol. In group D (diltiazem-continuation) patients, diltiazem was administered 2.1 +/- 0.1 hours (mean +/- SEM) before anesthetic induction (n = 10). Group DW (diltiazem-withdrawal) patients received their final diltiazem dose 17.3 +/- 2.9 hours before anesthesia (n = 10). Group R was a reference group of patients not receiving diltiazem (n = 11; not randomized). Anesthesia was induced and maintained with fentanyl and pancuronium without use of halogenated anesthetics. No clinically important differences were detected in measured hemodynamics or drug requirements. Group D patients did not have a lower systemic vascular resistance (SVR) index (P greater than 0.31) or mean arterial pressure (P greater than 0.08) compared with group DW. Also, no evidence for a diltiazem withdrawal response was found, because group DW did not have either a higher SVR index (P = 0.99) or a higher pulmonary vascular resistance index (P = 0.99) compared with group R, and no severe myocardial ischemia, coronary artery spasm, or postoperative heart block were seen. Plasma diltiazem concentrations decreased significantly during CPB (P less than 0.0001), but showed overlap between groups D and DW. Plasma diltiazem concentration did not correlate significantly with simultaneous SVR. These data show the benign effects of both diltiazem administration and its acute withdrawal before coronary artery bypass surgery with high-dose fentanyl anesthesia.", 
    "13": "Extrapolation from one country to another concerning costs of treatment of essential hypertension has to be made with caution because of wide variation of socio-economic differences and governmental price setting attitudes. The worldwide antihypertensive drug market shows a strong increase in the last few years and reflects the evolution away from diuretics and toward the more expensive ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists, with a decreasing percent market of beta-blockers and absolute stagnation in other antihypertensives outside these four groups of drugs.", 
    "14": "The drug therapy prescribed for 412 diabetic patients attending an outpatient clinic over a 12 week period was recorded to try and identify potential therapeutic problems. Over 90% of the patients were prescribed at least one drug (including insulin) with oral hypoglycaemic agents prescribed for 86% of non-insulin requiring diabetics. 19% of patients were prescribed more than three drugs and few patients took drug combinations. Of patients prescribed either glibenclamide or chlorpropamide, 63% were aged 65 yr or older. Despite their potential adverse clinical and biochemical effects, diuretics and beta-blockers were commonly prescribed, especially in hypertension. The prescribing of \"newer\" anti-hypertensive drugs, combination products in patients taking a multiple drug regimen, and the potential dangers of sulphonylureas in the elderly are three areas where alteration of prescribing habits may be of value.", 
    "15": "Transesophageal electrophysiologic study has recently been proposed for the evaluation of supraventricular arrhythmias. In this report we present 13 cases, with palpitations occurring only during effort, due to a suspected supraventricular tachycardia, in which the usefulness of the transesophageal electrophysiologic study performed during stress test was evaluated. Of these 13 patients, nine were male and four were female, mean age was 29 yrs. Twelve cases had no heart disease, one had a moderate mitral valve insufficiency. Nine cases had a normal ECG, four had a WPW pattern. In 9/13 cases no significant arrhythmia was ever documented, in 1/13 ventricular premature beats were present in the basal ECG, in 1/13 a atrial fibrillation and in 2/13 a supraventricular reciprocating tachycardia was recorded. In all cases a maximal exercise test and a 24-hour Holter monitoring were performed. In all pts a transesophageal electrophysiologic study was performed both at rest and during extra-stimuli and incremental atrial pacing. The end point of transesophageal study was the induction of a sustained (greater than 30\") supraventricular tachycardia. RESULTS. Maximal exercise test was negative in 11/13 cases; it showed ventricular premature beats in one case and initiated a supraventricular tachycardia in one. The 24 hour Holter monitoring was negative in 12/13 cases while it showed frequent ventricular premature beats in one. Resting transesophageal electrophysiologic study revealed dual A-V nodal pathways in six pts: in one of them a junctional re-entry was induced; in two a single echo beat was observed, while in three no reentry was observed. In three cases a supraventricular tachycardia was induced which was sustained in one and unsustained (7\" and 24\") in two cases. In 4 cases transesophageal electrophysiologic study gave no information. Transesophageal stimulation during exercise induced a greater than 30\" reciprocating tachycardia in all patients, at work loads of 30-180 watts. Six pts had an intranodal tachycardia (V-A less than 70 msec) a further six pts had a atrioventricular tachycardia involving a Kent bundle (V-A greater than or equal to 70 msec), which was concealed in two, and one had a atrial tachycardia. In four cases (3 with intranodal and 1 with atrioventricular tachycardia), exercise transesophageal study was repeated after chronic therapy with betablockers (sotalol 240 mg/die or metoprolol 200 mg/die). In all cases, after therapy, the induced tachycardia had a longer cycle and in two cases it was induced at a higher work load. In a further two cases flecainide (200 mg/die) was tested. In one case (with atrial tachycardia), the arrhythmia was no longer inducible after therapy, in another case (with intranodal tachycardia) the drug had no effect. CONCLUSIONS. In patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachyarrhythmias occurring during effort the basal ECG is normal or shows a WPW pattern. The maximal exercise test and 24 hour Holter monitoring give no information in over 90% of cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "16": "The pharmacological properties of centrally acting alpha2-receptor agonists such as clonidine suggest a potentially important role as ideal adjuvants for anesthesia since they produce sedation, analgesia anxiolysis, xerostomia and cardiovascular stability without respiratory depression, development of tolerance or addiction liability. Further clinical experience with this exciting development will undoubtedly establish the ultimate role and optimal use of alpha2 -receptor agonists in anesthetic practice. Beta-blockage can result in significant bradycardia, atrial ventricular conduction problems, bronchospasm and left ventricular contractile dysfunction. Thus, the use of long-acting beta-blockers is of limited value in the perioperative period. Esmolol, because of its ultrashort action, cardioselective properties and titratability, has been shown to be safe and effective for the treatment of tachycardia and hypertension. Doses from 50 to 300 micrograms/kg/min for up to 7 hours in the perioperative period have been shown to cause no apparent cumulative effect. It has been used in the treatment of asthmatic patients with tachycardia and hypertension without significant increases in airway resistance. Studies using esmolol during general anesthesia have demonstrated no significant interaction with several anesthetic regimens.", 
    "17": "Left ventricular hypertrophy may be a serious consequence of chronic untreated hypertension since it may accentuate the risk of congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, coronary ischaemias and sudden death. Although haemodynamic factors may play a role in the genesis of left ventricular hypertrophy, certain neurohumoral mechanisms such as the adrenergic nervous system may induce left ventricular hypertrophy in patients with hypertension. There is considerable evidence to implicate adrenergic activation in the pathogenesis of left ventricular hypertrophy. Thus, adrenergic blockade may have a favourable impact on the course of left ventricular hypertrophy. Recent studies discussed in this paper have demonstrated that postsynaptic alpha-adrenergic blockers cause a significant reduction in the left ventricular mass. It is concluded that alpha-adrenergic blockers can be added to the list of antihypertensive drugs which can cause regression of left ventricular hypertrophy in patients with hypertension.", 
    "18": "The therapeutic effectiveness and safety of indenolol, a vasodilating beta-blocker with beta 2-agonism, was compared with that of atenolol, a cardioselective beta-blocker, in a 1-year double-blind trial. A total of 143 hypertensive patients (diastolic blood pressure 95-115 mmHg after 1 month of placebo) were randomly allocated to either atenolol, 50 mg/day, or indenolol, 60 mg/day. If the target diastolic blood pressure (less than or equal to 90 mmHg) was not reached after 1 month, the beta-blocker was doubled. If the target was still not reached, a diuretic was added after 2 months and doubled after 4 months. There was a higher overall responsiveness and monotherapy was more effective in the atenolol group, but at the lower dose indenolol was more effective than atenolol; however, no differences between drugs were significant. Although the drop-out rate was higher with indenolol, withdrawals due to side effects were similar in both groups. Indenolol was as effective and safe as atenolol in long-term antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "19": "Fifty milligrams of carvedilol and 100 mg atenolol were administered in a random order once a day for 2 months to 43 patients with mild to moderate hypertension, in a double-blind crossover study. Blood pressure, heart rate and peripheral blood flow parameters (n = 11) were recorded 2 and 24 h after the drug administration. Supine blood pressure was the same 2 h after both carvedilol and atenolol administration, but carvedilol caused a greater decrease in standing systolic blood pressure 2 h after the administration (P less than 0.05). The heart rate decreased less with carvedilol (P less than 0.01). There was no difference in the effects exerted by the two therapies on systolic blood pressure and the heart rate 24 h after drug administration, but the diastolic blood pressure was higher in patients given carvedilol (92 versus 88 mmHg; P less than 0.05). Forearm blood flow, forearm vascular resistance and calf blood flow did not change significantly with either of the therapies. In conclusion, 50 mg carvedilol once a day is an effective antihypertensive therapy, though its duration of action did not reach that of 100 mg atenolol once a day. Peripheral vasodilation was similar with both therapies.", 
    "20": "The effects of verapamil (a calcium antagonist) and nebivolol (a novel, selective beta 1-adrenoceptor blocker) on carotid artery distensibility and cross-sectional compliance were studied non-invasively in hypertensive patients with the use of a high-resolution multigate pulsed Doppler system. Arm blood pressure measurements were made with an automated device (Dinamap). After a 4-week washout period, 19 patients (aged 21-73 years) with essential hypertension entered a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled crossover study with 120 mg verapamil or placebo three times a day for 4 weeks. After the administration of verapamil, carotid artery distensibility and cross-sectional compliance were significantly larger (P less than 0.05) than after placebo. Using the same protocol, 29 patients (aged 25-70 years) were given 5 mg nebivolol or placebo once a day for 4 weeks. After the administration of nebivolol, carotid artery distensibility and cross-sectional compliance were significantly larger (P less than 0.05) than after placebo. In both studies no significant differences in diameter and pulse pressure were found between placebo and verapamil or nebivolol. Blood pressure was decreased similarly with both verapamil and nebivolol. These results indicate that both verapamil and nebivolol favourably influence carotid artery distensibility and cross-sectional compliance of the common carotid artery, resulting in a better management of the systolic pressure pulse. The improved carotid artery distensibility may help to protect the patient against atherosclerotic complications of hypertension.", 
    "21": "Recent studies suggest that beta-blocker treatment may attenuate cardiac hypertrophy induced by pressure overload in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), but the effect of this therapy on the reconstitution of the intracellular constituents in the heart that occurs during the development of cardiac hypertrophy has not been examined. In this study, we investigated the effect of chronic administration of carteolol (4 mg/kg/day p.o.) or propranolol (20 mg/kg/day p.o.), beta-blockers with distinct modes of action, on the composition of cardiac myosin isozymes and histological findings as well as heart weight. Therapeutic periods were 4, 12 or 30 weeks. Though blood pressure was not significantly reduced, the development of cardiac hypertrophy was suppressed as evidenced by left ventricular weight in both groups of carteolol- and propranolol-treated SHR for all therapeutic periods. Again, beta-blocker treatment for 12 weeks alleviated myocardial degeneration and reactive fibrosis which were observed in all cases of age-matched untreated SHR. However the extent of the transition of cardiac myosin isozymes from V1 to V2 or V3 were essentially the same among all groups including untreated SHR. These results indicate that chronic administration of beta-blockers attenuates the development of cardiac hypertrophy and degeneration without affecting the transition of myosin isozymes which is thought to be a kind of biochemical adaptation of the myocardium to overload.", 
    "22": "This study examined the effect of chronic clomipramine administration on opioid mu- and kappa-binding sites. Clomipramine (5 mg kg-1 day-1) or saline was administered to rats via osmotic minipumps for 3 days or 28 days. Lysed-P2 brain membranes were prepared and preincubated for 60 min without (control membranes) or with 1 microM of the mu-selective acylating agent, 2-(4-ethoxybenzyl)-1-diethylaminoethyl-5-isothiocyanatobenzimid azole-HC1 (BIT), to deplete membranes of mu-binding sites. [3H]6-Desoxy-6 beta-fluoronaltrexone ( [3H]cyclo FOXY) was used to label mu and kappa-binding sites. Weighted nonlinear least squares analysis of cycloFOXY binding surfaces permitted determination of the Kd and Bmax values of mu- and kappa-binding sites in control and treated rats. Subacute (3 days) administration of rats with clomipramine had no significant effect on [3H]cycloFOXY binding. Chronic (28 days) administration of clomipramine produced a small (approximately 10%) but statistically significant decrease in the Bmax. These findings are discussed in reference to other studies that have examined the effect of chronic antidepressant administration on opioid receptors, and speculate that the endogenous opioid systems may play a role in obsessive-compulsive disorder.", 
    "23": "The effects of the beta 1-adrenoceptor blocking drug atenolol and the beta 2-adrenoceptor blocking drug ICI 118551 (ICI, Melbourne, Australia) on noradrenaline release and blood pressure were investigated using the pithed rat, which was subjected to continuous electrical stimulation of the spinal sympathetic outflow (pulses at 3 Hz). This stimulation increased blood pressure but not heart rate. The noradrenaline release rate was calculated by infusing [3H] noradrenaline and measuring the steady-state concentrations of both endogenous and infused noradrenaline. Atenolol (0.2 mg/kg bolus plus 0.1 mg/kg per h, intra-arterially) had no effect on the noradrenaline release rate or heart rate, but significantly decreased blood pressure. On the other hand, ICI 118551 (0.2 mg/kg bolus plus 0.1 mg/kg per h. intra-arterially) had no significant effect on blood pressure or heart rate, but did inhibit the noradrenaline release rate. The sympathoinhibitory effect of ICI 118551 was not observed in animals which had been adrenal medullectomized, suggesting that its effect on noradrenaline release was due to blockade of activation of facilitatory prejunctional beta 2-adrenoceptors by adrenaline. The reduced noradrenaline release in the presence of ICI 118551 was not accompanied by a reduction in blood pressure. This may be because ICI 118551 also blocked vasodilatory beta 2-adrenoceptors on vascular smooth muscle. Indeed, in unstimulated pithed rats, infusions of adrenaline which were non-pressor were found to be pressor after ICI 118551 was administered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "24": "The effects of rilmenidine [(N-dicyclopropylmethyl) amino-2-oxazoline; S 3341], an alpha 2 agonist, on the hypertensive rat heart have been compared with those of propranolol, using a model of deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertension. One week after nephrectomy and initial treatment with DOCA-salt, which was continued for an additional 7 weeks, the two drugs were added to the rats drinking water at a concentration of 10 mg/kg per day for rilmenidine and 15 mg/kg per day for propranolol. Both drugs had a slight and similarly significant antihypertensive effect at their respective concentrations [systolic blood pressure in controls, 141 +/- 15 mmHg (n = 20); after DOCA-salt, 209 +/- 22 mmHg (n = 24); after propranolol, 182 +/- 19 mmHg (n = 20, P less than 0.01); after rilmenidine, 192 +/- 15 mmHg (n = 19, P less than 0.05)]. They also lowered the systolic blood pressure x frequency product (P less than 0.001). Propranolol, but not rilmenidine, significantly reduced the left ventricular weight: body weight ratio [in controls, 2.00 +/- 0.2 mg/g; after DOCA-salt, 3.04 +/- 0.5 mg/g; after propranolol, 2.67 +/- 0.4 mg/g (P less than 0.05); after rilmenidine, 3.13 +/- 0.6 mg/g (P = NS)]. However, both propranolol and rilmenidine reduced left ventricular weight [in controls, 676 +/- 57 mg; after DOCA-salt, 827 +/- 114 mg; after propranolol, 732 +/- 108 mg (P less than 0.01); after rilmenidine, 760 +/- 100 mg (P less than 0.05)].(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "25": "Studies of the changes in the rat tail blood vessels in heating shows a considerable increase in slow oscillation frequency, apart from the rheographic index elevation. The hyperthermic effect became considerably lesser in elimination of these oscillations with ganglio- or adrenoblocking agents. The mechanism of hyperemia in heating associated with modulation of mechanic contractions of vascular smooth muscles, are discussed.", 
    "26": "Simultaneous blood pressure and uterine responses to norepinephrine infusions were recorded in urethane-anesthetized, pentolinium-indomethacin treated rats in natural estrus under conditions in which no blockers or blockers of alpha 1-, alpha 2-, and beta-adrenergic receptors or of \"reuptake\" of norepinephrine were present. The contributions of alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors to the blood pressure response were similar during the initial portion of the response. At later times, however, alpha 1-adrenergic receptors were responsible for the major portion of the response. The tachyphylaxis of the pressor response that occurs during norepinephrine infusion could be prevented by preventing norepinephrine \"reuptake\" with imipramine. In the uterus, the initial small alpha-adrenergic contractile response (seen only at the lowest infusion rate) was quickly overwhelmed by a beta-adrenergic relaxing component. Administration of the beta-adrenergic receptor blocker, propranolol, during norepinephrine infusion caused similar increases in blood pressure in control, yohimbine-, and prazosin-treated rats. Uterine contractions, in contrast, were only significantly elevated during beta-adrenergic receptor blockade when yohimbine or imipramine had also been administered.", 
    "27": "The absorption, distribution and elimination of falintolol maleate was studied in various ocular and extraocular tissues and organs following ocular instillation, intravenous injection of a 0.5% 14C-falintolol ophthalmic solution and repeated ocular instillations of a 1% non-labeled falintolol ophthalmic solution into albino New Zealand rabbits. Falintolol was distributed in all studied tissues and organs after both routes of administration. After ocular instillation, levels of total radioactivity were distinctly higher in ocular tissues than after intravenous injection. Thus, the level was 475 times more important in cornea, 72 times in aqueous humor and 36 times in iris and ciliary body after ocular instillation. On the other hand, levels of total radioactivity in extraocular tissues and organs were 30-50% higher after intravenous injection compared to ocular instillation of the same dose. Peak levels of total radioactivity were generally achieved between 30 min and 1 h after ocular instillation, while 1.5 h after intravenous injection an increase in the declining part of the curve occurred. This increase, characteristic of an enterohepatic reabsorption, was also observed in blood and plasma 1 h after intravenous injection. Urinary elimination was the major means of excretion since 79.6% of total radioactivity was found in urine 6 h after intravenous injection and 74.5% 12 h after ocular instillation. But after ocular instillation, only 5% was excreted as unchanged falintolol. Whatever the route of administration, after single or repeated application, no drug accumulation was evident.", 
    "28": "Post-partum dysthyroidism are not well understood by obstetricians, but are rather frequent (5.5% of the cases); they usually are the manifestation of a lympho-plasmocytic thyroidism with auto-immune origin. They are encouraged by a genetic predisposition and sometimes by food with a high iodine content. The disease starts with a phase of early thyreotoxicosis, 1 to 3 months following delivery, then later with hypothyroidism (from the 3rd to the 9th month), associated with menstrual disorders, an amenorrhea-galactorrhea syndrome or still, the occurrence of a goiter. Most of the time, the course is favorable, even in the absence of treatment with spontaneous return to euthyroidism within a few months, although the chance of permanent hypothyroidism is however non negligible. The diagnosis is difficult, and the treatment should be the least aggressive possible: beta-blocker during the thyreo-toxicosis phase, supplemental treatment during the hypothyroidism phase. There is a risk of recurrence during subsequent pregnancies.", 
    "29": "The authors evaluated QT interval changes after 7 and 14 days of treatment with 3 different betablockers--acebutolol, atenolol and penbutolol--in 3 groups of hypertensive patients. Acebutolol (400 mg u.i.d.) prolonged QTc interval in a statistically significant fashion, atenolol (100 mg u.i.d.) induced a significant and constant reduction, whereas QTc interval was shortened by penbutolol only after the first week, shifting toward pretreatment values during the second week. The physiological correlation between QT and RR was slightly modified by acebutolol and penbutolol, but markedly reduced after atenolol. Such differences might be of importance in clinical practice because are likely to be linked to different mechanisms intrinsic to each agent.", 
    "30": "1. Reflexogenic effects of bradykinin, lysyl-bradykinin and endogenously formed kinins on neural afferents of the left ventricular epicardium were studied in anaesthetized, open-chest dogs. 2. Epicardial application of either bradykinin (0.01-10 micrograms), lysyl-bradykinin (0.01-10 micrograms) or tissue kallikrein (0.003-1 U) consistently resulted in dose-related increases in blood pressure and heart rate. The pressor and heart rate responses to epicardial kallikrein were slower in onset and longer lasting than those evoked by bradykinin or lysyl-bradykinin. The effects of kallikrein, but not those of exogenous kinins, were subject to tachyphylaxis. The application of higher doses of kallikrein (0.1 or 1 U) also resulted in long-lasting desensitization of the epicardium to the effects of bradykinin. 3. Treatment of the epicardium with a proteinase inhibitor, aprotinin, prevented the reflexogenic effects of kallikrein but not those of bradykinin or lysyl-bradykinin. Treatment with aprotinin also counteracted post-kallikrein desensitization of sensory receptors of the ventricular epicardium to the reflexogenic effect of bradykinin. 4. Superfusion of the epicardium with a selective B2 receptor antagonist, D-Arg[Hyp3,Thi5,8,D-Phe7]-bradykinin, was equally effective in antagonizing the reflexogenic effects of kallikrein, bradykinin and lysyl-bradykinin. 5. We conclude that the response to epicardial application of kallikrein indicates an ample presence of endogenous substrate for local formation of bradykinin and/or related kinins. These then initiate reflex activation of the cardiovascular system by interacting with specific B2 receptors associated with sympathetic afferent neurones in the dog epicardium. We suggest that the kallikrein-kinin-receptor system has a role in the reflex function of the cardiac sympathetic afferents in both physiological and pathological conditions.", 
    "31": "In previous studies, the peptide secretin has demonstrated the ability to increase cardiac output and peripheral organ flow. In this investigation the mechanisms of the myocardial effects of secretin were studied. The secretin effects on cardiac output, stroke volume and systemic resistance were unaltered after propranolol, whereas the effect on LVdP/dt was reduced and the heart rate effect negligible. Systemic pressure, myocardial blood flow and myocardial oxygen consumption were unchanged by secretin infusion both before and after beta-receptor blockade. Secretin caused reduction of all three end-systolic left ventricular diameters. Thus, an inotropic effect by secretin was confirmed. Beta-receptor blockade reduced the inotropic effect and almost abolished the chronotropic effect, whereas the vasodilating effect was unaltered. The main haemodynamic effect of secretin was caused by activation of receptors other than the beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "32": "A sensitive, stereospecific high-performance liquid chromatographic assay of atenolol (AT) enantiomers in human plasma and urine was developed. After addition of internal standard (IS, methoxamine) and alkalinization of the plasma, the drug and IS were extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was evaporated and, after addition of saturated sodium carbonate, the residue was derivatized with (-)-menthyl chloroformate at ambient temperature; the reaction was complete within 30 s, with an efficiency of 97.2 +/- 2.6%. The diastereomeric derivatives of AT and IS were then extracted into chloroform and analyzed on a C18 column with a mobile phase consisting of water: acetonitrile: methanol. The samples were detected utilizing a fluorescent detector. Water-diluted urine samples were derivatized directly and then subjected to the same procedure as plasma. Under these conditions, AT diastereomers were separated with a resolution factor of 1.94, free of any interfering peak. An excellent linear relationship (r greater than or equal to 0.998) was obtained between the peak area ratios and the corresponding concentrations in the ranges 12.5-250 and 250-2500 ng/mL for plasma and urine, respectively. The applicability of the method is demonstrated by analysis of plasma and urine concentrations of individual enantiomers of AT after oral administration of a single 100-mg dose to a healthy subject.", 
    "33": "Previously we found that in rats, electrical stimulation of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus elicited hyperglycemia associated with hyperglucagonemia without immediate hyperinsulinemia. To clarify the mechanism of these responses, we examined the effects of blockers of the autonomic nervous system on these responses. Hexamethonium, a ganglion blocker, suppressed the hyperglycemic and hyperglucagonemic responses to electrical stimulation of the SCN. Both bunazosin, an alpha 1-adrenergic blocker, and yohimbin, an alpha 2-adrenergic blocker, increased the level of insulin before stimulation, but only the latter suppressed the hyperglycemic and hyperglucagonemic responses. Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocker, partially inhibited the responses. These findings suggest that alpha 2- and beta-adrenergic mechanisms are involved in the hyperglycemic and hyperglucagonemic responses to SCN stimulation.", 
    "34": "1. The nature of the rat epididymal adipocyte beta-adrenoceptor was investigated by studying the effects of beta 1- and beta 2-selective antagonists on lipolysis induced by (-)-isoprenaline and the lipolytically selective agonist BRL 37344. 2. From 10 nM to 10 microM, the potent and highly selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist CGP 20712A did not influence the concentration-response curve (CRC) of BRL 37344 whereas small but consistent shifts to the right of the (-)-isoprenaline-induced CRC were observed. Clear rightward shifts of the CRCs induced by both (-)-isoprenaline and BRL 37344 were produced only at 100 microM CGP 20712A with the corresponding pA2 values being 4.80 and 4.61, respectively. 3. When the beta 2-selective antagonist ICI 118,551 was used at 10 microM and higher, clear and concentration-dependent shifts to the right of the CRCs of both agonists were observed. The slopes of the Schild plots did not deviate significantly from unity, the pA2 values being 5.49 and 5.33 against (-)-isoprenaline and BRL 37344, respectively. 4. The results demonstrate that (-)-isoprenaline-induced lipolysis in rat white adipocytes is mediated predominantly by atypical beta-adrenoceptors, whereas the typical beta 1-adrenoceptors play a small, subordinate role. The lipolytically selective agonist BRL 37344 acts solely through atypical beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "35": "The relaxation by catecholamines of superior mesenteric veins and portal veins, precontracted by 65 mM KCl, was studied after a 2-h exposure to phenoxybenzamine. The veins were obtained from portal-hypertensive and sham-operated rats. The beta 2-selective antagonist ICI 118551 attenuated the relaxation caused by epinephrine and isoproterenol but did not change the relaxation caused by norepinephrine in superior mesenteric veins. The beta 1-specific antagonist CGP 20712A reduced the relaxation caused by norepinephrine but only marginally attenuated those caused by epinephrine and isoproterenol in superior mesenteric veins. The combination of ICI 118551 and CGP 20712A abolished the relaxation caused by the catecholamines in superior mesenteric veins. The relaxation caused by norepinephrine, epinephrine, and isoproterenol was markedly reduced by ICI 118551 in portal veins. The pattern of antagonism was similar in veins from portal-hypertensive and sham-operated rats. The results suggest that both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors mediate relaxation induced by catecholamines in superior mesenteric veins. Relaxation of portal veins appears to be mediated mostly by beta 2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "36": "We have measured the output of melatonin in vitro from the pineal glands of lambs in late gestation (135-143 days) and the early newborn period (4-8 days). The basal output of melatonin/mg pineal tissue was significantly lower in the fetal group (16.3 +/- 3.9 pg melatonin.(30 min)-1.mg-1) than in the newborn group (148.1 +/- 43.6 pg melatonin.(30 min)-1.mg-1). Addition of the beta-adrenergic agonist, isoprenaline (10(-5) mol/l) significantly stimulated melatonin output from both the fetal (to 24.9 +/- 3.9 pg melatonin.(30 min)-1.mg-1) and newborn pineals (to 247.7 +/- 67.3 pg melatonin.(30 min)-1.mg-1). Pineals from newborn lambs produced 9-10-fold more melatonin than the fetal pineal glands, before, during and after addition of isoprenaline. These results show that functional beta-adrenergic receptors are present before birth on the sheep pinealocyte and that there is a marked increase in the melatonin synthetic capacity of the pineal in the newborn period.", 
    "37": "The effects of physiological concentrations of the native catecholamines norepinephrine and epinephrine upon term placental hormonal function were examined by measuring estradiol and progesterone secretion by organ and cell culture systems. Results show that, in explants, both catecholamines caused a significant increase in the secretion of both sex steroids, p less than 0.05. Estradiol secretion was blocked by the alpha and beta adrenergic receptors antagonists, phenoxybenzamine and propranolol, respectively, p less than 0.05. Norepinephrine but not epinephrine dependent progesterone secretion was blocked by propranolol. In cells, epinephrine stimulated cyclic AMP generation and caused a 30% increase in estradiol secretion, p less than 0.05. Both were abrogated by propranolol. Norepinephrine increased secretion by 25%, p less than 0.05. This was inhibited by yohimbin and prazosin, alpha-1 and -2 receptors antagonists, respectively. In conclusion, the placenta in vitro is a target organ for catecholamines. The marked response of the explant system as compared with the marginal response of the cell culture system indicates that cell to cell contact/communication is required for full expression of catecholamine effect.", 
    "38": "There is controversy whether various classes of antihypertensive drugs can reduce significantly cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in primary prevention. A failure to show this in many studies was attributed, at least in part, to deleterious effects of these drugs on lipid metabolism. Especially adrenergic antihypertensives cause marked effects on lipoprotein levels in plasma. A review of the literature revealed that beta-blockers increase triglycerides and VLDL (very low density lipoprotein)-cholesterol and may lower plasma HDL (high density lipoprotein) levels. In contrast alpha 1-adrenergic inhibitors like prazosin, doxazosin and terazosin lower triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL (low density lipoprotein)- and VLDL-cholesterol and increase plasma HDL levels. The mechanisms by which alpha- and beta-blockers may produce the observed effects on plasma lipids and lipoproteins are not well understood. It has been shown in our laboratory that the activity of the LDL receptor of peripheral cells, a major determinant of cholesterol levels in plasma, is regulated by catecholamines via alpha 2- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors. Accordingly, blockade of these adrenoceptors with alpha- and beta-adrenergic antagonists can reverse the catecholamine effect. In addition these agents may affect lipoprotein lipase, lecithin cholesteryl acyltransferase and cholesterol ester hydrolase. These data may explain, at least in part, the plasma effects. However, long-term studies are needed to clarify the clinical value of antihypertensives with different metabolic profiles.", 
    "39": "Treatment of hypertension aims at preventing strokes and coronary events. Although diuretics and beta-blockers lowered blood pressure effectively and allowed prevention of strokes in large-scale trials, they did not reduce the incidence of myocardial infarction or coronary death. The failure of diuretics and beta-blockers to afford cardiac protection may be due in part to the unfavourable effects of these agents on associated risk factors like hyperlipidaemia and smoking. Hyperlipidaemia is more prevalent in hypertensive patients than in matched normotensive controls, and the combination of hyperlipidaemia and smoking is more frequent than can be expected to occur by chance. Diuretics and beta-blockers affect lipid metabolism negatively. Unlike these agents, alpha-blockers do not alter serum lipids and might reduce triglyceride and cholesterol levels. Several trials have shown that the outcome of treatment with beta-blockers was less favourable in smokers than in non-smokers in terms of blood pressure control and prevention of coronary events. A possible explanation is provided by acute experiments in which beta-blockade enhanced the systemic and coronary vasoconstriction elicited by smoking, while alpha-blockade had the opposite effect. Although there is reason to believe that alpha-blockers may be preferable to diuretics and beta-blockers for the treatment of high risk hypertensive patients who smoke and/or exhibit high levels of serum lipids, there is a need for larger and longer trials to test their ability to reduce cardiovascular risk.", 
    "40": "The treatment of systemic hypertension in patients with coexisting chronic airflow limitation is difficult. Even a 'cardioselective' beta-blocker potentially can increase airflow limitation. However it is very unlikely that alpha 1 blockers can bronchoconstrict. We have therefore evaluated the efficacy and safety of doxazosin, a new orally active selective alpha 1 blocker, in patients with systemic hypertension with concomitant airflow limitation. We studied 21 patients (11M, 10F) whose diastolic blood pressure was 95-114 mmHg and FEV1 22-73% of predicted. In the 19 patients who completed the study the dose of doxazosin to achieve satisfactory control of the systemic hypertension lay between 1 and 16 mg (mean 6 +/- 3.6 mg). This doxazosin dosage reduced the diastolic blood pressure on average from 103 to 91 mmHg (P = 0.0001). However this produced no significant changes in peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) over the days of the study (P greater than 0.05). The mean variations in PEFR both 'day to day' (P less than 0.001) and 'within day' (P less than 0.002) were reduced during doxazosin therapy, and FEV1 rose on average from 1.6 to 1.7 (P less than 0.05). We conclude that doxazosin is an effective oral antihypertensive drug, which does not exacerbate pre-existing airflow limitation.", 
    "41": "Renal vascular reactivity to intrarenal arterial boluses of norepinephrine (NE), phenylephrine (PHE; alpha 1-agonist), and guanabenz (GBZ; alpha 2-agonist) was assessed in conscious, freely moving, chronically instrumented, normotensive Wistar rats. Dose-response curves (DRCs) were obtained in the absence and cumulative presence of propranolol (PROP; beta-antagonist), corynanthine (CORY; alpha 1-antagonist) and idazoxan (IDX; alpha 2-antagonist) to estimate effective dosages (ED) required for 15 and 75% peak reductions in renal blood flow. The PHE DRC had a short shallow ED15 region, but was primarily linear with a steep slope. The GBZ DRC had a shallow slope. The NE DRC had a prolonged shallow phase in the ED15 region and a steep slope in the ED75 region. PROP had no effect on the DRCs. CORY caused a parallel rightward shift of the PHE DRC and had no effect on the GBZ DRC. After CORY, the shallow ED15 portion of the NE DRC was even more pronounced with a slope now identical to that of the GBZ DRC, whereas the ED75 region of the NE DRC was shifted rightward like the PHE DRC. IDX preferentially antagonized the ED15 regions of the GBZ and NE DRCs. In a second group of rats, the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, rauwolscine, was administered following base-line DRCs to demonstrate rightward shifts of the NE and GBZ DRCs when PHE DRCs remained unaffected. Therefore, when boluses of NE are injected into the rat kidney, the vasoconstrictive responses are a result of the activation of both alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "42": "The ability of myometrial beta-adrenergic receptors to form a \"'high-affinity state\" with beta-adrenergic receptor agonists might be greater in pregnant guinea pigs at greater than or equal to 0.9 of gestation than in nonpregnant animals. To determine whether this difference is due to pregnancy in general or is associated only with late pregnancy and to determine whether it persists in the postpartum period, we studied the interaction of l-isoproterenol with beta-adrenergic receptors in myometrial membranes obtained from nonpregnant (nulligravid) animals, pregnant (primigravid) animals at 0.3, 0.7, and 0.9 to 1.0 of gestation (term 65 days), and postpartum guinea pigs (2 to 3 days). The affinity of myometrial beta-adrenergic receptors for l-isoproterenol was measured by percent inhibition of -[125I]cyanopindolol binding. In the presence of magnesium chloride, the competition curves could be resolved into two affinity state of the beta-adrenergic receptor, \"high\" and \"low,\" respectively, in all groups. The ratio of the dissociation constant of the \"low\"-affinity state to that of the \"high\"-affinity state was significantly higher in pregnant guinea pigs at greater than or equal to 0.9 of gestation than in nonpregnant or postpartum animals and in pregnant animals of earlier gestations. In the presence of guanosine triphosphate only one (low-affinity) state of the receptor was detectable. Thus it is only in pregnant guinea pigs at greater than or equal to 0.9 of gestation that the ability of myometrial beta-adrenergic receptors to form a high-affinity state is enhanced.", 
    "43": "Intrauterine 17 beta-estradiol pellets can induce an up-regulation of guinea pig myometrial beta-adrenergic receptor density and l-isoproterenol-dependent adenylate cyclase activity. Does 17 beta-estradiol influence the ability of beta-adrenergic receptors to form a \"high affinity\" state with l-isoproterenol, which is a necessary step for adenylate cyclase activation? Nonpregnant, oophorectomized guinea pigs received intrauterine pellets of either placebo, 17 beta-estradiol, progesterone, or 17 beta-estradiol plus progesterone for 1 week. 17 beta-Estradiol resulted in pharmacologic, whereas progesterone resulted in physiologic plasma 17 beta-estradiol and progesterone concentrations, respectively. The affinity of myometrial beta-adrenergic receptors for l-isoproterenol was measured by percentage of inhibition of -[125I]cyanopindolol binding. In all groups, the competition curves in the presence of magnesium chloride could be resolved into two affinity states of the beta-adrenergic receptor, \"high\" and \"low,\" respectively. The ratio of their dissociation constants was not influenced by hormonal treatment. However, the relative concentration of beta-adrenergic receptors in the high affinity state was significantly higher in the 17 beta-estradiol-treated group than that in the control group. This correlates with the up-regulation in myometrial adenylate cyclase activity and suggests that myometrial beta-adrenergic receptor-adenylate cyclase function may be modulated by 17 beta-estradiol.", 
    "44": "The perspectives on migraine are changing rapidly. Many of the recent findings on migraine are examined. The overlap between migraine and tension headache, which has led to a reappraisal of the treatment of this disorder, is reviewed. Both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic methods of treating migraine are discussed.", 
    "45": "In recent years, there has been increased recognition of the relative importance of abnormalities of diastolic function in patients with essential hypertension. Indeed, diastolic dysfunction may be the earliest indicator of hypertensive heart disease. In this article, the mechanisms governing normal ventricular relaxation and the factors that may cause diastolic dysfunction are reviewed. Noninvasive clinical methods, particularly Doppler echocardiography and radionuclide angiography, for determination of diastolic function are outlined, and the limited experience in the management of hypertensive patients with abnormalities of diastolic function is discussed. When congestive heart failure develops in a patient with hypertension, it is especially important to determine whether it is due primarily to systolic or to diastolic left ventricular dysfunction.", 
    "46": "Calcium antagonists block the entry of calcium into vascular smooth muscle cells, producing pharmacological vasodilation. Thus, it is not surprising that these drugs are effective in treating unstable angina that is often characterized by increased vasomotion and dynamic obstruction at the site of atheromatous plaques. Nifedipine, diltiazem, and verapamil are all highly and equally effective in reducing painful and painless ischemic episodes in Prinzmetal's variant angina. In patients with unstable angina who have known or suspected significant underlying coronary artery disease, a multipharmacological approach to therapy is warranted. Nifedipine used with beta-blocker drugs is more effective than nifedipine as monotherapy. Diltiazem and verapamil have been shown to be effective when given without beta-blockers in unstable angina patients. In many patients, thrombus formation rather than vasospasm is the major pathophysiological event resulting in progression of the syndrome to infarction or sudden death. In these patients, antiplatelet, antithrombotic, or antiplatelet and antithrombotic therapy is of utmost importance to maintain adequate coronary flow. Nonresponders to medical therapy with unstable angina have a high prevalence of eccentric and multiple coronary stenoses with a high incidence of thrombi. The best responders to calcium antagonist therapy are patients with concentric coronary stenoses. In summary, calcium antagonists are highly effective in reducing ischemic episodes in patients with Prinzmetal's angina and effective for therapy for unstable angina when used in conjunction with other forms of medical treatment aimed at the processes of platelet activation and thrombus formation.", 
    "47": "Asymptomatic myocardial ischemia likely results from an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand. Although changes in coronary vasomotor tone probably are important in the genesis of asymptomatic ischemia, heart rate increases also play a critical role. Consequently, all three classes of antianginal agents, nitrates, beta-blockers, and calcium entry blockers, have been shown efficacious as monotherapy for silent ischemia. Comparative studies have demonstrated that agents or combination therapies that control heart rate increases during normal activities are superior to regimens that increase average heart rate. Consideration of the side-effect profile of any therapy for asymptomatic patients also is important. The ideal therapy would be with one drug that reduced coronary vasomotor tone and myocardial oxygen demand during normal activities and had no adverse effects. Currently, the calcium entry blockers, diltiazem and verapamil, most closely approximate this ideal. It has yet to be proven, however, that the treatment of asymptomatic myocardial ischemia improves the prognosis of patients with coronary artery disease, and the risk-benefit ratio of pharmacological therapy is not established.", 
    "48": "We studied 14 patients to determine whether sustained-release diltiazem is a satisfactory long-term substitute for the combination of propranolol plus hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), control phase, in the treatment of systemic hypertension with coexisting chronic stable angina pectoris. All patients had either one- or two-vessel coronary disease and normal left ventricular systolic function. Measurements were made during the control phase and 4 and 8 weeks after substitution of sustained-release diltiazem. Only the sitting blood pressure was available before the control phase (pretreatment). Blood pressure and heart rate were measured with patients supine, sitting, and 5 minutes after standing. Cardiac output was measured in the supine position using a computerized Doppler system, and stroke volume, mean arterial pressure, and total systemic resistance were calculated. Symptom-limited modified Bruce protocol treadmill tests were performed to determine time to onset of 1 mm ST segment depression, time to termination of exercise, reason for cessation of exercise, and maximum rate-pressure product. The patients were initially receiving 160-240 mg/day of propranolol (40-60 mg q.i.d.) plus 25-50 mg/day of HCTZ and, subsequently, 12 of 14 had substitution with 240 mg/day (120 mg b.i.d.) of sustained-release diltiazem, and two received 360 mg/day with one of these patients also receiving 50 mg/day of HCTZ. These patients are a subset of a larger group of patients in whom the response of blood pressure alone has been previously reported. Diltiazem resulted in reduction of blood pressure equivalent to that with the propranolol plus HCTZ combination.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "49": "The calcium channel blockers are useful in treating many cardiovascular disorders. Due to their anti-ischemic and spasmolytic properties, the cardioprotective effects of these agents have been studied in the setting of acute myocardial infarction. This paper will review this application with respect to limitation of infarct size, reduction of mortality, and incident morbidity rates. Of the agents currently available for clinical use, nifedipine has been studied most extensively. This agent shows no beneficial effects and its use can, in fact, be harmful in this setting. Of the few trials that have been conducted with verapamil, none have shown a preventive effect on death, reinfarction, or postinfarction angina. Both verapamil and diltiazem might limit infarct size although further confirmation is required. At the present time, diltiazem is the only agent shown to have short- and long-term benefits on clinical outcome in patients with acute myocardial infarction. The success of prophylactic diltiazem is, however, critically dependent on proper patient selection. In particular, those patients with non-Q wave infarction, normal left ventricular function, or both can be expected to derive the greatest benefit in terms of reduced mortality and incident morbidity.", 
    "50": "Clinical studies of syncope suggest a decreased prevalence of vasovagal syncope in old age. To examine this possibility and its pathophysiologic implications, we report the results of two studies. The first evaluated responses to head-up tilt in young and old subjects. Presyncopal vasovagal symptoms occurred in 4 of 9 young subjects and only 1 of 22 old subjects. The second study asked whether decreased beta-adrenergic responsiveness protected the old during tilt via unopposed alpha-adrenergic-mediated vasoconstriction. Blood pressure, heart rate, and forearm vascular resistance responses to tilt in 11 healthy young subjects randomized to receive intravenous propranolol hydrochloride or saline were compared with those of 10 healthy elderly. Propranolol attenuated heart rate and forearm vascular resistance responses. Vasovagal symptoms occurred in 4 young and no old subjects; 2 were symptomatic during propranolol administration. Thus, presyncopal vasovagal symptoms are less common during tilt in old age. Propranolol did not prevent the vasovagal reaction or enhance forearm vasoconstriction. Propranolol's attenuation of vasoconstriction may be due to decreased activation of cardiopulmonary baroreceptors during beta-blockade.", 
    "51": "Treatment with the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol suppresses clinical and histological experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in Lewis rats. The effect of isoproterenol treatment is greater when the drug is given from the time of immunization through the acute phase of the illness or from 8 to 14 days post-immunization than when given for the first 7 days after immunization.", 
    "52": "To determine whether GH feedback affects both induced and spontaneous GH secretion and to explore its neurotransmitter mediation, we assessed the effects of 6-h GH infusions (0.55-5.5 micrograms/m2/min) on sleep-associated and GH-releasing hormone (GHRH)-, insulin hypoglycemia-, and arginine-stimulated GH secretion and their modulation by beta-adrenergic blockade in normal men. GH infusions initiated 2 h before the expected onset of sleep produced a dose-dependent inhibition of GH secretion. GH infusions (0.55 micrograms/m2/min) initiated 4 h before the stimuli inhibited the GH response to each, but did not alter the TSH response to TRH. Propranolol infusion (80 micrograms/min) started 2 h before the onset of sleep or the stimulus enhanced GH responses to GHRH and insulin alone and in the presence of GH. In contrast, propranolol neither enhanced the GH responses to arginine or sleep nor reversed the inhibitory effects of GH. The negative feedback effect of GH to both physiological and pharmacological stimuli of GH secretion indicates that it is most likely mediated by both stimulation of somatostatin and inhibition of GHRH release. The effects of beta-adrenergic blockade suggest an inhibition of somatostatin release, although the complex interaction of GH and propranolol implies that they act through dissimilar mechanisms.", 
    "53": "Recombinant interleukin-1 alpha and -beta (Il-1 alpha and -beta) have been evaluated for their abilities to stimulate ACTH and catecholamine secretion in the intact adult male rat. Additionally, the role of adrenergic-dependent pathways in mediating Il-1-induced ACTH release has been assessed. The iv or intracerebroventricular injection of either Il-1 alpha or Il-1 beta caused dose-related increases in plasma ACTH, epinephrine, and norepinephrine levels. While at low iv doses (less than or equal to 10 ng), Il-1 beta was more effective than Il-1 alpha at releasing ACTH, no measurable differences were noted at higher doses. In contrast, Il-1 beta was significantly more active at all doses in elevating plasma ACTH levels after intracerebroventricular injection. Similarly, Il-1 alpha was more effective than Il-1 beta at stimulating epinephrine, but not norepinephrine, secretion after icv injection. Because of the ability of catecholamines to alter ACTH secretion, we then examined the role of adrenergic-dependent pathways as possible mediators of Il-1-induced ACTH secretion. Blockade of adrenergic receptors by the concomitant administration of prazosin and propanolol prevented the simultaneous actions of phenylephrine and isoproterenol on the corticotrophs, but did not significantly alter the effect of peripherally administered Il-1 alpha on ACTH release. These results suggest that both Il-1 alpha and Il-1 beta stimulate ACTH and catecholamine secretion in the rat. Despite the ability of the lymphokine to elevate plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine values, circulating catecholamines do not appear to represent essential modulators of ACTH release induced by acutely injected Il-1.", 
    "54": "The effects of halothane on alpha-adrenergic receptors, beta-adrenergic receptors, and the process of Ca++ dependent contractions on rat mesenteric lymphatics were examined. Halothane depressed the contraction rate of mesenteric lymphatics but did not effect the increase in lymphatic contraction rate caused by noradrenaline (an alpha-agonist). The depressant effect of halothane on the contraction rate was also not antagonized by propranolol (a beta-blocker), but was partly reversed by CaCl2. These findings suggest that the depressant effect of halothane on the lymphatic contraction rate derives not from blocking lymphatic alpha-receptors or stimulating lymphatic beta-receptors but rather by halothane inhibition on the process of Ca++ dependent lymphatic contractions.", 
    "55": "Arterial compliance, assessed by the stroke volume-pulse pressure relationship, was measured in 32 patients with a high cardiac output together with borderline hypertension and 26 control subjects with normokinetic borderline hypertension. Measurements were obtained in the supine position both before and after 0.2 mg/kg intravenous propranolol. Baseline arterial compliance was significantly greater in the hyperkinetic group (P less than 0.01). The inter-group difference was no longer significant after the administration of propranolol, since compliance tended to increase in the normokinetic group and decrease in the hyperkinetic group. Therefore, disparities in vascular beta-adrenergic tone between hyperkinetic and normokinetic borderline hypertensive patients probably contribute to group differences in arterial compliance.", 
    "56": "Thirteen borderline hypertensives were investigated at rest and during dynamic exercise, before and after therapy with nadolol (40-80 mg/day for 7-28 days), in order to evaluate regulation of the number of lymphocyte beta-receptors. Systolic blood pressure and the heart rate were measured before and after 15 min of bicycle exercise, both with and without nadolol therapy; blood samples were withdrawn for adrenaline, noradrenaline and lymphocyte beta-receptor determinations. Nadolol induced a significant decrease in systolic blood pressure and the heart rate at rest, while plasma catecholamines and lymphocyte beta-receptors did not change significantly. Of the physiological responses to dynamic exercise (increases in systolic blood pressure, heart rate, plasma noradrenaline levels and adrenaline and lymphocyte beta-receptors), only the rise in beta-receptors was entirely prevented, and the increase in the heart rate was significantly attenuated by nadolol. It is suggested that the lack of a rise in the number of beta-receptors during exercise may contribute to the blunted exercise-induced tachycardia in patients taking nadolol.", 
    "57": "Blood pressure was continuously monitored over 24 h in 201 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension using a noninvasive method. Measurements were made both before and after 6 months of antihypertensive treatment and the data were compared to results from 100 normotensive patients. The frequency with which blood pressure values above 140/90 mm Hg occurred during the 24-h period proved to be the most reliable parameter for distinguishing between hypertensive and normotensive profiles. The blood pressures of all patients could be normalized (less than 140/90 mm Hg) on single or combined drug therapy as assessed by casual measurement. However, significant differences were observed between the 24-h profiles of the treated patients and the control group. The mean 24-h blood pressure, the mean day and nighttime blood pressures, the mean hourly pressure, and the frequency of increased blood pressure values were all significantly higher in the patients on medication as compared to the normotensive controls. This would suggest that normotension, as defined by the control group, cannot be attained with antihypertensive medication. In conclusion, 24-h continuous blood pressure monitoring allows a better evaluation of blood pressure profiles and consequently, will be of greater value in assessing cardiovascular risk than occasional random measurements.", 
    "58": "1. We determined the number of beta-receptors in the whole spinal cord of the adult rat and in the cervical, thoracal, and lumbal/sacral parts. 2. The undivided spinal cord contains 47 +/- 10 fmol/mg beta-receptors (KD = 2066 +/- 982 pmol/liter), and the cervical part of the spinal cord contains 53 +/- 8 fmol/mg protein (KD = 3224 +/- 1775 pmol/liter). The thoracal part shows 40 +/- 1 fmol/mg protein (KD = 3229 +/- 104 pmol/liter), and the lumbal/sacral spinal cord contains 48 +/- 8 fmol/mg protein (KD = 3610 +/- 1610 pmol/liter). 3. Competitive inhibition studies with l-practolol, dl-atenolol, and ICI 118,551 were performed and we calculated by a computer program in the whole spinal cord the following ratio of beta-receptor subtypes: 80 +/- 5% Beta 1-receptors and 20 +/- 5% beta 2-receptors. 4. The basal and (-)-isoproterenol- and NaF-stimulated activity of adenylate cyclase was highest in the cervical part of the spinal cord and equally distributed between the thoracal and the lumbal/sacral parts. 5. The whole synaptosomal protein of the cervical part of the spinal cord contained 132 +/- 20 fmol, the thoracal part 117 +/- 3 fmol, and the lumbal/sacral part 133 +/- 22 fmol.", 
    "59": "Selective perforation of the right cusp of the aortic valve alone (1V) or in combination with that of the left valve cusp (2V) by a plastic rod inserted from the right common carotid artery was performed to cause aortic insufficiency (AI) in rats. The development of cardiac hypertrophies subsequent to these interventions to cause graded cardiac volume overloads was followed up every week till the end of week 4 after the operations by radiographic measurement of the cardiothoracic ratio (CTR). Rats were killed 2 and 4 weeks after the operations, and the density of beta-adrenoceptors in hypertrophied cardiac muscle membranes was determined by radioligand binding assay and compared with sham-operated (sham) rats. Production of AI resulted in an enlargement of the cardiac shadow in 1VAI and 2VAI rats, with significant graded increases in the CTR at the end of week 3. The occurrence of graded cardiac hypertrophies was well revealed in graded increases of the heart weight/body weight ratio among the sham, 1VAI, and 2VAI rats at the end of both week 2 and week 4. There was a tendency to stepwise increases due to graded AI in the density of binding sites for 3H-dihydroalprenolol, with a significant increase in 2VAI rats at the end of week 2. At the end of week 4, plasma norepinephrine levels of 2VAI rats was raised significantly as compared with the sham rats. Selective perforation of either one or two cusps of the aortic valve can be performed with ease using touch alone and provides us with a simple method for producing graded cardiac hypertrophies in rats due to pure volume overload.", 
    "60": "The effects of intravenous (i.v.) and intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of beta-adrenoceptor agonists were evaluated on the reticulo-rumen and upper-gut myoelectrical activity in six ewes chronically fitted with intraparietal electrodes and a cannula in a lateral ventricle of the brain. Intravenous infusion of the beta 1 agonist dobutamine (30 micrograms/kg/min for 15 min) reduced the frequency of reticulo-ruminal and abomasal contractions and stimulated duodeno-jejunal motility, inducing a Phase III on the jejunum. These effects were reproduced by i.c.v. dobutamine at a dose of 10 micrograms/kg. Intravenous infusion of the beta 2 agonist ritodrine (15 micrograms/kg/min for 15 min) selectively inhibited antral and duodenal motility. Ritodrine i.c.v. (15 micrograms/kg) did not affect forestomach or gastrointestinal motility. The mixed beta 1, beta 2 agonist isoprenaline infused i.v. (0.6 micrograms/kg/min for 15 min) reproduced the effects of i.v. dobutamine, except at the antro-duodenal level which was strongly inhibited. The effects of i.v. dobutamine were antagonized by i.v. or i.c.v. acebutolol, a specific beta 1 antagonist. The effects of i.v. ritodrine were blocked by i.v. but not i.c.v. administration of propranolol, a mixed beta 1, beta 2 antagonist. These data indicate that the stimulation of central beta 1 adrenoceptors inhibits forestomach and antral motility and stimulates duodeno-jejunal motility. Stimulation of peripheral beta 2 adrenoceptors selectively inhibits duodeno-jejunal motility.", 
    "61": "The purpose of the present study was to evaluate and compare the responsiveness of beta 2-adrenoceptors in elderly and young subjects. Seven healthy elderly volunteers (72 +/- 3 years) were given cumulative doses of inhaled salbutamol (100 micrograms-4000 micrograms) or placebo, following pre-treatment with propranolol 40 mg or placebo. Finger tremor (Tr), plasma potassium (K), and heart rate (HR) were measured at each dose step. There were dose-dependent increases in Tr (P less than 0.001) and HR (P less than 0.001) and falls in K (P less than 0.001), which were completely attenuated by propranolol (P less than 0.001). Comparison with dose-response curves in a group of young (Y) subjects (24 +/- 3 years) given an identical dose protocol of salbutamol showed no evidence of subsensitivity of beta 2-adrenoceptor responses in the elderly (E) group (mean and 95% confidence intervals for maximum responses): delta K -0.90 (-1.1(-)-0.82) mmol l-1 Y, -0.82 (-1.04(-)-0.60) mmol l-1 E, delta Tr 274 (213-335)% Y, 269 (197-342)% E, delta HR 25 (21-28) beats min-1 Y, 26 (21-31) beats min-1 E.", 
    "62": "Respiratory infections provoke increased airway reactivity in both asthmatic and otherwise healthy subjects in part through impaired beta-adrenergic relaxation of bronchial and tracheal muscle. The precise mechanism remains obscure, but some studies report a decrease in the number of beta-adrenergic receptors. The present study was designed to assess the effect of viral respiratory infection with influenza A on lung beta-adrenergic receptors and adenylate cyclase activation in mice under two separate protocols. First, to determine whether changes are due to a local or systemic effect, we compared mice with influenza infections limited to the upper respiratory tract to mice with infection of the total respiratory tract. Four days after upper respiratory tract infection there were no changes in either isoproterenol- or NaF-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. In contrast, there was an 82% decrease in isoproterenol- and a 25% decrease in NaF-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity on the fourth day after total respiratory tract infection. There were no changes in beta-adrenergic receptors or receptor coupling to adenylate cyclase with either type of infection. Our second protocol compared acutely infected mice to postrecovery mice. Twelve days after infection the virus was no longer present in the lungs, and adenylate cyclase activity was restored to normal. These data suggest that viral respiratory infection may impair airway function through attenuation of receptor and postreceptor activation of adenylate cyclase activity.", 
    "63": "The effect of norepinephrine (NE) injection (40 nmol) into the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) on plasma insulin and glucose levels was studied in freely moving lean Zucker rats bearing chronic right jugular catheters for blood sampling and unilateral intracerebral cannulas placed just above the PVN. Already 2.5 min after NE injection, plasma glucose levels rose significantly, reaching a peak at 10 min poststimulus, whereas the insulin output was strongly inhibited. This NE-induced hyperglycemia was independent of the corticosterone levels. A ganglionic blockade performed by intravenous chlorisondamine (1 mg/kg body wt) reduced by 80% the 4.5-min NE-induced incremental glucose areas. NE-induced hyperglycemia was reduced to a large extent when the PVN alpha-adrenergic receptors were blocked with phentolamine and to a lesser extent when the beta-adrenergic receptors were blocked with propranolol. NE-induced inhibition of insulin output was not affected by these adrenergic blockers. It is concluded that, when administered locally into the PVN, NE can activate the sympathetic outflow expressed by a neurally mediated hyperglycemia through central alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptor and an inhibition of insulin output through other types of receptors and/or mechanisms.", 
    "64": "Selective lesions of serotonin neurons or inhibition of serotonin synthesis results in an increase in the number of [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding sites in several areas of rat brain. Previously, this increase in binding sites was interpreted as an increase in beta-adrenergic receptors. However, the lesion-induced increase in [3H]dihydroalprenolol is not accompanied by an increase in isoproterenol- or norepinephrine-stimulated cyclic AMP production. The increased binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol is blocked by the addition of serotonin but not by the addition of norepinephrine or dopamine to the assays. Furthermore, the addition of metergoline, a serotonin antagonist, also blocked the increase in lesioned tissues. Thus, the lesion-induced increase in [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding appears to represent an increase in serotonergic binding sites. Among drugs with some selectivity for serotonin-1 receptor subtypes, trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine and RU-24929 were as effective as serotonin in blocking lesion-induced increases in [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding. However, 8-hydroxy-N,N-dipropyl-2-aminotetralin (8-OH-DPAT), spiperone, and mesulergine were either much less effective than serotonin or completely ineffective. Radioligand binding to serotonin-1A and serotonin-1B sites with [3H]8-OH-DPAT and 125I-cyanopindolol, respectively, after lesions of serotonin axons or depletion of serotonin was not increased, despite a marked increase in [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding in the same tissues. When tissues from control rats or rats with serotonin lesions were preincubated at 37 degrees for 10 min to remove endogenous serotonin bound to receptors, the binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol in controls was increased to the level seen in lesioned tissues. Thus, [3H]dihydroalprenolol binds primarily to beta-adrenergic receptors in control membranes that are not preincubated; however, either preincubation of control tissues or serotonin depletion unmasks a serotonin-1 receptor subtype to which [3H]dihydroalprenolol binds in addition to the beta-adrenergic receptor.", 
    "65": "Alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), a plasma protein responsible for the binding of a variety of basic lipophilic drugs including propranolol, is different from other plasma proteins in being nonprecipitable after treatment with 1.2M perchloric acid (PCA). To assess the contribution of AGP to drug disposition in sheep and three other species (rats, dogs, and humans), the binding of [3H]propranolol was measured before and after PCA precipitation. PCA precipitation reduced propranolol binding 14-fold in sheep, compared to 2- to 3-fold in the other species. This implied either that sheep AGP binds less propranolol than other species, or that the AGP in sheep is more precipitable. It was not due to inherently poor propranolol binding, as whole sheep plasma bound a higher fraction than the other species. When samples of PCA-precipitated sheep plasma were analyzed using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the concentration of AGP was 10-20% that of the other species. Phenobarbital induction was used as a tool to examine the changes in the plasma protein profile. Phenobarbital induced propranolol binding and AGP along with two other proteins in sheep. One of these proteins migrated similarly to AGP deglycosylated by peptide-N-glycosidase F. It is postulated that the greater precipitability of propranolol binding in sheep is due to a less glycosylated form of AGP which is not important in other species.", 
    "66": "The goal of this study was to determine the mechanism of beta-adrenergic receptor desensitization after chronic elevation of circulating NE levels. Osmotic minipumps containing either NE or saline were implanted subcutaneously in dogs for 3-4 wk. Physiologic desensitization to isoproterenol was confirmed in conscious dogs, i.e., left ventricular dP/dt increased in response to isoproterenol (0.4 micrograms/kg per min) by 5,625 +/- 731 mmHg/s in control dogs with saline pumps, and significantly less, P less than 0.01, by 2,093 +/- 263 mmHg/s in dogs with NE pumps. Myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor density as determined with 125I-cyanopindolol binding was 49% higher (p less than 0.05) in the NE pump group. However, beta-adrenergic receptor agonist binding with isoproterenol demonstrated a significant shift into the low affinity state for the animals with NE pumps. Basal, GTP plus isoproterenol, 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate, sodium fluoride, and forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in the NE pump group were significantly depressed (P less than 0.05) by amounts ranging from 20 to 40%. The functional activity of the guanine nucleotide binding protein Gs was also reduced (P less than 0.05) in animals with NE pumps. Thus, the process of desensitization in response to chronic elevation of NE levels in intact, normal dogs does not involve a decrease in beta-adrenergic receptor density. Rather, it is characterized by reduced adenylate cyclase activation and uncoupling of the beta-adrenergic receptor in association with decreased activity of the GTP-coupling protein Gs.", 
    "67": "Effects of ACTH-(1-24) on the release of noradrenaline from postganglionic sympathetic neurones were studied in rabbits. In the isolated perfused rabbit heart, ACTH-(1-24) (0.1-100 nmol/l) increased the overflow of noradrenaline elicited by sympathetic nerve stimulation at 1 Hz, an effect that persisted in the presence of propranolol and cocaine. In pithed rabbits with electrically stimulated sympathetic outflow (2 Hz), ACTH-(1-24) (0.03-1 microgram/kg per min) increased the plasma noradrenaline concentration as well as the calculated rate of entry of noradrenaline into the plasma, but decreased arterial blood pressure by a direct vasodilator effect. In anaesthetized rabbits, ACTH-(1-24) (0.1-1 microgram/kg per min) also increased the plasma noradrenaline concentration; the higher dose in addition reduced the blood pressure and increased the firing rate of renal sympathetic nerves; however, the rise in plasma noradrenaline was greater than would have been expected from the increase in sympathetic firing rate alone. It is concluded that ACTH exerts two primary effects on the cardiovascular system of the rabbit: presynaptic facilitation of the noradrenaline release and postsynaptic vasodilation. The vasodilation leads to a baroreceptor-mediated reflex increase in sympathetic tone. The low concentrations of ACTH required suggest that presynaptic facilitation may occur in vivo, at least when the secretion of ACTH is high.", 
    "68": "We have previously reported that alpha 2-adrenoceptor stimulation enhances adenosine-induced coronary vasodilation. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that alpha 2-adrenoceptor activity exerts beneficial effects on myocardial ischemia through augmentation of vasodilatory effects of released adenosine. In open-chest dogs, the left anterior descending coronary artery was perfused through an extracorporeal bypass tube from the carotid artery. Propranolol was infused into the bypass tube to exclude the metabolic effects of norepinephrine. When clonidine (0.24 micrograms/kg/min i.c.) was infused for 10 minutes after reduction of coronary blood flow by partial occlusion of the bypass tube, coronary blood flow was increased by 43% from 27 +/- 1 ml/100 g/min despite no changes in coronary perfusion pressure (38 +/- 5 mm Hg) and a slight decrease in adenosine release. Both fractional shortening and lactate extraction ratio of the perfused area were significantly improved (fractional shortening, 1.8 +/- 1.0 to 10.9 +/- 1.5%, p less than 0.001; lactate extraction ratio, -57.8 +/- 6.5 to -31.9 +/- 2.4%, p less than 0.005). Identical results were observed in the denervated hearts, indicating that the beneficial effect of clonidine is not attributed to the prevention of norepinephrine release from the sympathetic nerve terminals. The beneficial effects of clonidine were prevented by yohimbine, an alpha 2-adrenoceptor blocking agent. An adenosine receptor antagonist, 8-phenyltheophylline, also prevented the beneficial effects of clonidine, indicating that these beneficial effects are mediated by effects of adenosine. Furthermore, the extent of augmentation of coronary flow in the ischemic heart was coincided with that of augmentation of exogenous adenosine-induced hyperemic flow (40%) by clonidine. Production of cyclic AMP in the coronary artery during myocardial ischemia was augmented by clonidine. In 12 other dogs, myocardial ischemia was produced by intracoronary embolization of microspheres (15 microns in diameter). Clonidine enhanced (39%) the hyperemic coronary flow and improved both fractional shortening and lactate extraction ratio. Thus, we conclude that alpha 2-adrenoceptor stimulation can ameliorate myocardial ischemia mainly due to enhancement of vasodilatory effects of adenosine released from the ischemic myocardium.", 
    "69": "Loss of pigmented noradrenergic locus ceruleus neurons occurs in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and, to a lesser extent, in aging. We studied beta-adrenergic receptors and their subtypes, beta 1 and beta 2, by the specific binding of 125I-pindolol to particulate membrane preparations from prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, putamen, and cerebellum and to sections from frontal cortex by in vitro autoradiography. In prefrontal cortex from controls, numbers of total beta- and beta 2-adrenoceptors did not significantly correlate with age, but number of beta 1-adrenoceptors showed a weak but significant negative correlation. Binding in tissue particulate preparations to total beta-receptors did not reveal significant differences in samples from prefrontal cortex between AD subjects and age-matched controls. However, beta 1-adrenoceptors were decreased and beta 2-adrenoceptors were increased in number by approximately 30-50% in AD subjects. Thus, the relative ratio of beta 1-/beta 2-receptors was decreased in AD. Binding by in vitro receptor autoradiography performed in a subset of samples of frontal cortex also showed beta 2-adrenoceptors, and less consistently total beta- and beta 1-receptors, to be increased significantly in number in cortical laminae II, III, IV, and V of tissue sections from AD subjects. In these subjects, number of locus ceruleus cells and norepinephrine concentrations in putamen and frontal cortex were markedly reduced compared with values in controls. In the hippocampus, total beta- and both beta 2- and beta 1-adrenoceptors were increased in number in AD. In contrast, in the putamen, where beta 1-receptors predominate, total beta- and beta 1-receptors were significantly decreased in number with no consistent change in content of beta 2-receptors in AD. There were no significant changes in the cerebellum. Specific pindolol binding was not affected by interval between death and sampling of tissue at autopsy. Our results indicate selective changes in number of beta-receptors in AD. These changes in the cortex and hippocampus suggest receptor upregulation in response to noradrenergic deafferentation from the locus ceruleus or may simply reflect glial proliferation in AD.", 
    "70": "The aim of this prospective multicenter study is to determine the efficacy and tolerance of a new, highly cardioselective beta-blocking agent with vasodilatation effects, Celiprolol. 185 patients with mild-light blood hypertension, grade 1-2, were admitted. Patient's progress was followed in 21 centers, 15 of them not being evaluated due to study protocol transgression. 82 patients were male and 87 female, with a median age of 50 +/- 11 (18-74). A doses of 200 mq/day of Celiprolol, once a day, during 2 weeks produced a significant statistical decrease of TAS and TAD (165 +/- 18 vs 151 +/- 18 mmHg, P less than 0.01 and 103.9 +/- 7 vs 94 +/- 9, P less than 0.01), with a minimal reduction of CR (78.5 +/- 10 vs 72.9 +/- 8 p min); 72 patients (43%) did not show a decrease in TAD lower than 95 mmHg, this being the reason to increase the celiprolol doses to 400 mg once a day, obtaining a decrease of TAS and TAD (TAS 146 +/- 16, P less than and TAD 90.5 +/- 9, P less than 0.01) with final CR of 71 +/- 8 p min. 18 patients had secondary effects, being mild in 16 cases, moderate in 2 and only one left the study spontaneously. 107 patients obtained a good control of blood hypertension (TAD less than 90) (62.9%), 80 of them with 200 mg doses. Analysing quality of life, 97 patients recognised that they left better (59.9%), 58 (35.8%) no different, and only 7 (4.3%) worse.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "71": "The hypertensive heart is an example of myocardial adaptation to a chronic mechanical overload. In this model, the myocardium adapts by quantitative mechanisms such as hypertrophy and by qualitative processes at sarcomere and cell membrane level. Cardiac failure occurs when these mechanisms become inadequate although other phenomena such as collagen, coronary resistances, adverse hormonal effects and associated pathologies also play a role. This report describes an experimental model: uninephrectomised rats were made hypertensive by administering a DOCA-salt diet. The resulting cardiac hypertrophy was reduced and the hypertension corrected by propranolol. Rilmenidine, a new antihypertensive agent, has no effect on cardiac hypertrophy but it does reduce myocardial collagen concentrations significantly which has potentially important beneficial consequences.", 
    "72": "Twenty patients undergoing various surgical procedures were anaesthetised using hypotensive anaesthesia using labetalol and halothane. The technique is safe, predictable and cheap. This technique also offers the advantage of usage of less blood, thus minimising the complications of transfusion induced diseases like hepatitis and AIDS.", 
    "73": "In previous work, we have shown that the chronic administration of verapamil, a calcium channel blocker, ameliorated the mortality, pathology, and biochemical alterations associated with acute murine Chagas' disease. To extend these studies to an established chronic model, C3H/Hej mice were infected with the Sylvio X10/4 clone. This clone does not cause symptomatic acute disease but does induce cardiac pathology incorporating several pathological features of human chagasic cardiomyopathy. Cardiac pathology was assessed at 60, 90, and 180 days postinfection. There was a significant decrease in the degree of inflammation and fibrosis in the group infected and treated with verapamil. Myocardial beta-adrenergic adenylate cyclase (AC) activity was determined 180 days postinfection. In the infected group not treated with verapamil, there was no significant change in the maximum rate of conversion of ATP to cAMP (Vmax) or in the concentration of agonist giving 50% of Vmax (apparent Kact) for isoproterenol (ISPN)-dependent AC activation. The increase in Vmax for ISPN determined in the presence of 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate (Gpp[NH]p) was consistently lower in infected than in uninfected mice, suggesting that infection altered the potential synergistic activation of AC by the guanine nucleotide. In the infected group treated with verapamil, there was a slight increase in the Vmax for ISPN. However, there was a marked enhancement of the synergistic contribution of Gpp(NH)p. These observations suggest that verapamil had preserved that aspect of the AC complex mediating guanine nucleotide sensitive activation of AC. Collectively, the observations in the acute and chronic models of murine Chagas' disease suggest that verapamil may be a useful adjunct in treatment.", 
    "74": "The efficacy of beta-blockers in preventing sudden death after myocardial infarction would seem to be greater in patients with cardiac failure and proportional to the reduction in heart rate induced by these drugs. In addition, a reduction in heart rate variability measured by the standard deviation from the average cardiac cycle over 24 hours has been reported to be an independent bad prognostic factor after myocardial infarction. This study compares the heart rates and the standard deviations from the mean cardiac cycle over 24 hours in 41 patients divided into 3 groups of comparable age (group I: normal subjects, n = 15; group II: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy without cardiac failure, n = 13; group III: cardiac failure, n = 13) before and after administration of acebutolol (10 mg/kg). The average 24 hour heart rates, the maximum 8-hour diurnal and minimum average 4-hour nocturnal heart rates, day-night ratio and standard deviations from the average 24 hour heart rate and at the hours of maximum and minimum average heart rates were measured by Holter monitoring with an ATREC II system. The 24 hour heart rates were slower in groups II (-18.1 p. 100) and III (-19.1 p. 100) than in group I (-9.5 p. 100), p less than 0.01, the basal heart rates being comparable and the heart rates after acebutolol being significantly lower in groups II and III. The degree of change was comparable during the diurnal and nocturnal periods.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "75": "In isolated perfused rat hearts, epidermal growth factor (EGF; 15 nM) increased cellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) content by 9.5-fold. In rat cardiac membranes, EGF also stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in a dose-dependent manner, with maximal stimulation (35% above control) being observed at 10 nM-EGF. Half-maximal stimulation of adenylate cyclase was observed at 40 pM-EGF. Although the beta-adrenergic-receptor antagonist propranolol markedly attenuated the isoprenaline-mediated increase in cAMP content of perfused hearts and stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity, it did not alter the ability of EGF to elevate tissue cAMP content and stimulate adenylate cyclase. The involvement of a guanine-nucleotide-binding protein (G-protein) in the activation of adenylate cyclase by EGF was indicated by the following evidence. First, the EGF-mediated stimulation of adenylate cyclase required the presence of the non-hydrolysable GTP analogue, guanyl-5'-yl-imidodiphosphate (p[NH]ppG). Maximal stimulation was observed in the presence of 10 microM-p[NH]ppG. Secondly, in the presence of 10 microM-p[NH]ppG, the stable GDP analogue guanosine 5'-[beta-thio]diphosphate at a concentration of 10 microM blocked the stimulation of the adenylate cyclase by 1 nM- and 10 nM-EGF. Third, NaF + AlCl3-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was not altered by EGF. The ability of EGF to stimulate adenylate cyclase was not affected by pertussis-toxin treatment of cardiac membranes. However, in cholera-toxin-treated cardiac membranes, when the adenylate cyclase activity was stimulated by 2-fold, EGF was ineffective. Finally, PMA by itself did not alter the activity of cardiac adenylate cyclase, but abolished the EGF-mediated stimulation of this enzyme activity. The experimental evidence in the present paper demonstrates, for the first time, that EGF stimulates adenylate cyclase in rat cardiac membranes through a stimulatory GTP-binding regulatory protein, and this effect is manifested in elevated cellular cAMP levels in perfused hearts exposed to EGF.", 
    "76": "The effects of beta-adrenergic blockade, thrombolysis and their combination on infarct size and left ventricular function were investigated in a canine model of thrombotic occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Metoprolol was administered intravenously (0.5 mg/kg) over 10 min, starting 15 min after occlusion. Recombinant human tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) was given intravenously 1 h after occlusion for clot lysis. Anatomic infarct size was measured as a percent of perfusion area and ventricular mass. Left ventricular function was assessed by ejection fraction and the centerline method. Groups 1, 3, 5 and 7 were evaluated after 24 h and received, respectively, metoprolol plus rt-PA, rt-PA, metoprolol and no treatment; groups 2, 4, 6 and 8 were studied after 1 week and treated, respectively, as groups 1, 3, 5 and 7. Metoprolol did not influence infarct size and global or regional ventricular function after 24 h and 1 week. Thrombolysis reduced infarct size from 69.5 +/- 3.4% (24 h) and 76.6 +/- 1.8% (1 week) in the control group to, respectively, 44.1 +/- 11.6% and 39.5 +/- 10.5% (p greater than 0.05), did not influence left ventricular function after 24 h and was accompanied after 1 week by a definite recovery of global and regional left ventricular function when compared with findings in control dogs. Metoprolol plus rt-PA further reduced infarct size (percent perfusion area) to 20.4 +/- 3.7% and 19.9 +/- 8.1% after 24 h and 1 week, respectively (p = NS versus rt-PA).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "77": "We have studied the effect of noradrenaline- and serotonin-depleting agents on the febrile response induced by an intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of interleukin-1 (IL-1) in rats. Pretreatment with an injection into the lateral ventricle of the catecholamine-depleting agent, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), abolished the febrile response induced by IL-1. Injection of 6-OHDA into the ventral noradrenergic ascending bundle (VNAB) did not affect the pyrogenic effect of IL-1. Pretreatment with the serotonin-depleting agent, 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT), did not inhibit the febrile response to IL-1. In addition, pretreatment with a beta-adrenergic blocker (propranolol) but not an alpha-adrenergic blocker (yohimbine) attenuated the fever induced by an i.c.v. injection of IL-1. These results suggest that the integrity of the central catecholaminergic system is important in mediating the IL-1-induced fever in rats. The central serotonergic system, as well as noradrenergic neurotransmission at the hypothalamus, do not appear to participate in this endogenous pyrogen-induced febrile response.", 
    "78": "We studied atrial flutter due to circus movement in chronically instrumented conscious dogs to identify the mechanism by which class I and class III antiarrhythmic drugs terminate reentrant excitation. We used a crossover experimental design administering five class I agents and one class III agent, by intravenous bolus followed by intravenous infusion. The class I agents other than lidocaine were almost uniformly effective in terminating the arrhythmia (disopyramide in six of seven dogs, propafenone in six of six, flecainide in seven of seven, and SC-40230 in seven of seven). Termination was preceded by a marked increase in cycle length (ranging from +78% with propafenone to +55% with disopyramide), but with the exception of disopyramide, class I agents did not significantly shorten the excitable gap. With disopyramide the gap decreased from 49 +/- 3% to 28 +/- 3% of the cycle length. With no class I agent did the wavelength of effective refractoriness increase to approach the cycle length of the arrhythmia. Lidocaine, used as a negative control, terminated the reentry in one dog with modest prolongation of the cycle length. Terminations with class I agents correlated with depression of conduction rather than prolongation of refractoriness. In contrast with class I agents, D-sotalol prolonged the cycle length minimally (+10%) and terminated the arrhythmia in six of seven dogs. It decreased the excitable gap from 42 +/- 4% to 26 +/- 6% of the cycle, but it still did not cause the wavelength of effective refractoriness to equal the cycle length. Terminations by D-sotalol seemed to result from either failure of the lateral boundaries of the circus path or reflection within the path.", 
    "79": "The aim of this work was to develop and initiate the documentation of an instrument for the assessment of subjective CNS-related symptoms occurring during cardiovascular pharmacotherapy. The self-applied questionnaire developed for minor symptom evaluation (MSE profile) includes 24 items and uses a visual analogue scale to record symptoms. Three different studies were performed using a total of 86 healthy volunteers. Based on a subjective grouping followed by principal component analysis to confirm the grouping, three dimensions-contentment (eight items), vitality (five items), and sleep (three items)-were formed. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient, used to evaluate the internal consistency of these dimensions, was found to be 0.90, 0.88, and 0.85, respectively. To validate the MSE profile, the subjective symptoms of two classes of drugs with well-known symptom profiles, a nonselective, beta-blocker (propranolol) and a benzodiazepine (oxazepam), were compared in placebo-controlled randomized double-blind crossover studies. The obtained results indicate that the symptom profiles were different but were compatible with the previously reported effects of these compounds. It can be concluded that the MSE profile is practical, useful, and sensitive enough to also detect subtle drug-induced effects.", 
    "80": "The effect of prostaglandin (PG) E2, F2 alpha, the thromboxane-A2 mimetic U46619 (9,11-dideoxy-9 alpha,11 alpha-methanoepoxy-prostaglandin F2 alpha) and the prostacyclin mimetic iloprost was investigated in cat middle cerebral and basilar arteries in vitro precontracted with 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) (50nM) in the absence and presence of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin or the thromboxane receptor blocker AH23848B [1 alpha (z),2 beta,5 alpha]-(+)-7-[5-[1,1'-(biphenyl)-4-yl] methoxy]-2-(4-morpholinyl)-3-oxocyclopentyl]-4-heptenoic acid). PGF2 alpha and U46619 both produced further concentration-related contractions of basilar and middle cerebral artery, U46619 being approximately 1,000 times more potent than PGF2 alpha. Iloprost produced concentration-related relaxations of precontracted basilar and middle cerebral artery, the mean maximum relaxations produced at a concentration of 1.3 microM being 57.3% and 80.6%, respectively of the contraction produced by 50nM 5-HT. PGE2, 100nM relaxed the basilar and middle cerebral artery, 46.7% and 38.5% respectively. However, at 1 microM, PGE2 caused contraction. Indomethacin, 2.8 microM had no effect on contractile or relaxant responses to any of the prostanoids. Oxyhaemoglobin inhibited the relaxation of both arterial preparations but had no effect on responses to PGE2 or iloprost. The thromboxane-receptor blocker AH23848B antagonised the contractile responses to U46619, PGF2 alpha and PGE2 and had no effect against relaxant responses to PGE2 or iloprost. It is concluded that both contraction- and relaxation-inducing prostanoid receptors are present in the in vitro preparation of feline basilar and middle cerebral artery. Under sustained tension conditions, endothelial factors do not appear to be involved in the responses to dilating prostanoids.", 
    "81": "Chloride permeability of the inner membrane of brown adipose tissue mitochondria was analyzed by monitoring mitochondrial swelling in KCl salts in the presence of K+ ionophores. The results indicate that the high anion conductance observed in these mitochondria is due to the presence of two separate pathways: 1) a Cl-conducting pathway that is inhibited by guanosine 5'-diphosphate (GDP) but neither by N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) nor by amphiphilic amines and that is found uniquely in brown adipose tissue mitochondria and 2) an inner membrane anion uniport channel that is inhibited both by DCCD and by amphiphilic amines but not by GDP and that is opened either by depletion of matrix Mg2+ or by alkalinization of the matrix.", 
    "82": "Sudden cessation of prolonged treatment with clonidine in conscious rats evokes a cardiovascular withdrawal syndrome, characterized by severe tachycardia and brief blood pressure (BP) increases, so-called \"upswings.\" Previously, adenylate cyclase-coupled alpha 2-adrenoceptors were shown to be involved in this phenomenon. In the present study, the effect on the intensity of clonidine withdrawal symptoms of concomitant treatment with various beta-adrenoceptor antagonists during clonidine infusion (100 micrograms/kg/24 h, 7 days) was investigated. Propranolol (18 mg/kg/24 h, beta 1 and beta 2 blocker) and ICI 118.551 (12 mg/kg/24 h, beta 2 blocker) clearly aggravated the withdrawal symptoms, whereas metoprolol (18 mg/kg/24 h, beta 1 blocker) did not affect the severity of the withdrawal syndrome. Accordingly, intensification of the withdrawal syndrome appears to be mediated by beta 2- rather than by beta 1-adrenoceptors. These results point to an interaction at the level of the second-messenger adenylate cyclase (AC) system in development of clonidine withdrawal syndrome.", 
    "83": "The importance of the interaction of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors in maintaining vascular tone in rats was studied. This interaction after clenbuterol (CLEN) treatment indicates an important contribution of the circulating epinephrine (EPI) levels. In urethane-anesthetized rats, the beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118.551 was more effective in antagonizing isoproterenol-induced hypotension (mainly beta 2-mediated) than tachycardia (mainly beta 1-mediated). Intravenous (i.v.) administration of the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine (CLO) induced an initial pressor response followed by a more prolonged hypotension and bradycardia. The initial hypertensive effect was potentiated by previous acute administration of ICI 118.551 as well as by the nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol, but not by metoprolol, a more selective beta 1-blocker. Fourteen days of administration of the beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist CLEN [0.3 mg/kg, subcutaneously (s.c.) twice daily], a treatment that induces desensitization of beta 2-mediated vasodilation, increased the pressor response induced by CLO, an effect that was not observed in pentobarbital-anesthetized rats. In any case, neither beta-blockers nor CLEN treatment affects the hypotension and bradycardia induced by CLO. Mean blood pressure (BP) of CLEN-treated rats was increased under urethane anesthesia but not under pentobarbital anesthesia. Catecholamine levels (principally EPI) were higher in urethane-anesthetized rats. These results provide further evidence of a functional interaction between alpha 2- and beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated responses in rat vasculature and suggest that vasodilator beta 2-adrenoceptors might contribute to the determination of peripheral vascular tone when circulating EPI is substantially elevated.", 
    "84": "Hypertensive patients received a beta-blocker plus placebo once daily for 4 weeks. If their diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was then 95-115 mm Hg, they were randomized to receive, in addition to the beta-blocker, placebo (n = 36), felodipine-extended release (ER) 10 mg (n = 36), or felodipine-ER 20 mg (n = 37) in a 4-week double-blind parallel-group trial. All medication was administered once daily and, when BP was measured 24 h after the last dose, felodipine-ER 10 mg reduced DBP by 14 +/- 9 mm Hg (mean +/- SD) from a mean of 103 mm Hg and felodipine-ER 20 mg reduced DBP by 18 +/- 9 mm Gg from 101 mm Hg. The reductions in DBP with both doses of felodipine were greater than reductions with placebo (5 +/- 8 mm Hg, from 102 mm Hg--both p less than 0.001). At the end of the study, 21% of patients receiving placebo had a DBP less than or equal to 90 mm Hg. In contrast, 69% of patients receiving felodipine-ER 10 mg and 82% receiving 20 mg attained this level. More than 90% of patients receiving 10 mg felodipine-ER once daily had a reduction in DBP greater than 5 mm Hg 24 h postdose. Felodipine-ER was well tolerated. Felodipine-ER once daily is an effective antihypertensive drug for patients who require therapy in addition to a beta-blocker; the tolerability in this study was good, and a starting dose greater than 10 mg once daily is not indicated.", 
    "85": "The effects of beta-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists on field-stimulated release of radioactivity from superfused guinea pig papillary muscles preincubated with 3H-noradrenaline were studied. Stimulation-evoked overflow of tritium was abolished in the absence of Ca2+ or the presence of tetrodotoxin. Isoprenaline (1 mumol/L) caused a slight facilitation of evoked overflow, whereas phentolamine (1 mumol/L) exerted a strong facilitatory action. However, when phentolamine (1 mumol/L) was present throughout superfusion, isoprenaline and the selective beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, zinterol, caused concentration-dependent increases (half-maximal effects at 1 nmol/L). The effects of the agonists were inversely related to stimulation frequency. Furthermore, the concentration-response curve of isoprenaline was shifted to the right by the selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, ICI 118,551, but not by the selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, ICI 89,406. Schild-plot analysis revealed competitive antagonism and a pA2 value of 9.04 for ICI 118,551. Both ICI 118,551 and ICI 89,406, as well as beta-adrenoceptor antagonists with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (pindolol and celiprolol; 1 mumol/L), had no effect on stimulation-evoked overflow of tritium (phentolamine present). It is concluded that guinea pig papillary muscles are endowed with prejunctional beta 2 adrenoceptors facilitating impulse-evoked noradrenaline release. The facilitation is markedly promoted by blockade of prejunctional alpha adrenoceptors.", 
    "86": "1. A single subcutaneous injection of clenbuterol hydrochloride (0.125 mg/kg body wt.) to female Wistar rats produced a rapid increase in muscle cyclic AMP and lactate concentrations and a decrease in muscle glycogen concentrations. These changes are characteristic of muscle beta-adrenoceptor stimulation and were abolished by intraperitoneal injection of propranolol (12.5 mg/kg) 15 min before clenbuterol administration. 2. When this dose of clenbuterol was injected twice daily, the changes in muscle metabolite concentrations which followed its acute administration persisted until day 7 of treatment, and were accompanied by increases in muscle mass, body weight and muscle protein synthesis rate (ks). When the clenbuterol injections were preceded by propranolol injections (12.5 mg/kg administered according to the protocol described above), or if animals were treated with propranolol only, the values of these variables were not significantly different from those of sham-injected controls. 3. In rats fed on a semi-synthetic diet (PW3) supplemented with 2 mg of clenbuterol/kg of diet for 7 days, the muscle mass was greater than that of rats fed on unsupplemented PW3. The increased muscle mass was accompanied by increased muscle lactate and decreased muscle glycogen concentrations. When PW3 was supplemented with 2 mg of clenbuterol/kg and 200 mg of propranolol/kg, the increase in muscle mass remained, but decreased muscle glycogen concentrations and increased muscle lactate concentrations were also observed. 4. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that clenbuterol influences muscle growth via beta-adrenoceptor stimulation.", 
    "87": "This article describes the inadvertent, catheter-induced induction of right bundle branch block resulting not only in transient complete infra-His heart block but also in temporary interruption of the macroreentry circuit of ventricular tachycardia. A patient with preexistent left bundle branch block and spontaneous ventricular tachycardia based upon the bundle branch reentry mechanism underwent electrophysiological testing for the evaluation of sotalol drug efficacy. In search of an optimal His-bundle recording, the manipulation of a 6 Fr quadripolar catheter caused a right bundle branch block, thus advancing the preexistent left bundle branch block to complete heart block. Retrograde ventriculoatrial conduction remained unaffected. The macroreentrant tachycardia with left bundle branch block configuration was no longer inducible. While the patient continued on unchanged sotalol medication (320 mg/d) he required temporary pacing for 16 hours until the block subsided. A subsequent induction attempt demonstrated initiation of the tachycardia. Finally, guided by invasive testing, the patient successfully received amiodarone therapy (300 mg/d). The patient completed an uneventful follow up of 27 months. No progression of conduction delay was observed. This case suggests that the inadvertent induction of right bundle branch block prevents the initiation of ventricular tachycardias relying on bundle branch reentry. Therefore, missed diagnosis or misinterpretation of antiarrhythmic drug efficacy might occur if there is no electrophysiological reevaluation after right bundle branch recovery.", 
    "88": "The in vivo lipid mobilizing effect of alpha-2 adrenergic antagonist has been demonstrated previously. This has attracted attention to the putative interest of such compounds in a lipid-mobilizing strategy. RP 55462 [6-chloro-4-(isopropylamino)-5-(methyl)-2 piperazinopyrimidine], a piperazinopyrimidine derivative, has already been shown to exert alpha-2 adrenergic antagonist actions on fat cell function in vitro. Moreover, RP 55462 exhibits a direct in vitro lipolytic action which is independent of its alpha-2-blocking potency. When administered i.v. RP 55462 is also able to induce an increment in plasma nonesterified levels in dogs. The mechanism of action of RP 55462 was studied and the nature of its lipomobilizing effect was explored. RP 55642-dependent lipolysis was not affected by beta adrenergic blockers on rat fat cells and RP 55462 had no direct effect on adenylylcyclase activity on fat cell membranes. Moreover, RP 55462 did not compete with [3H]phenyl isopropyl adenosine binding (A1-adenosine receptor agonist) on fat cell membranes. In fact, RP 55462 inhibited, in a dose-dependent manner, the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity in rat adipose tissue. Several derivatives with the piperazinopyrimidine structure also inhibited cAMP-dependent PDE activity and exerted lipolytic effects. A short structure-activity study was performed with various derivatives. In dogs, by contrast with yohimbine, the in vivo lipid mobilizing effect of RP 55462 was not abolished by pretreatment with propranolol, and lasted longer. It is concluded that the in vivo lipolytic activity of RP 55462 is connected with its ability to inhibit cAMP-dependent PDE activity; a property of several piperazinopyrimidine derivatives. The lipid mobilizing effect induced in vivo by RP 55462 results from a combination of its alpha-2 adrenergic antagonist properties and its direct lipolytic action mediated by cAMP-dependent PDE inhibiting effects.", 
    "89": "The use of membrane-active antiarrhythmic agents may be complicated by aggravation of existing arrhythmias or development of new drug-induced arrhythmias. Four patients, referred because of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest or symptomatic sustained ventricular tachycardia, were receiving class IC antiarrhythmic agents in an attempt to prevent inducibility of sustained ventricular tachycardia. New or worsening spontaneous arrhythmias developed while they were on flecainide acetate (n = 3) or encainide hydrochloride (n = 1) therapy. Spontaneous runs of rapid nonsustained and sustained ventricular tachycardia developed in two. Increased frequency of premature ventricular contractions and repetitive forms of ventricular ectopic activity developed in one, despite the fact that inducibility of sustained ventricular tachycardia had been prevented. Salvos and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia developed in the fourth patient. Propranolol had failed to prevent inducibility of sustained ventricular tachycardia during previous programmed stimulation studies in three of the four patients, but it reproducibly suppressed drug-induced arrhythmias that appeared only after administration of the IC agents in each patient. Suppression of the proarrhythmic effects by beta-adrenergic blockade suggests a possible interaction of these drugs with autonomic function in the genesis of the observed proarrhythmic effects. Direct pharmacologic control of proarrhythmic drug effects has not previously been reported.", 
    "90": "Anti-peptide antibodies, raised against the N-terminal sequence (amino acids 2-10) of the turkey beta 1-adrenoceptor [Yarden et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1986) 83, 6795-6799] recognized the 50 kDa- but not the 40 kDa-form of the receptor, thus confirming the previous assumption that the N-terminus of the 50 kDa form is lost during its conversion to the 40 kDa-form [J\u00fcr beta, R., Hekman, M. & Helmreich, E.J.M. (1985) Biochemistry 24, 3349-3354]. By in situ proteolysis small amounts of receptor fragments were formed, which could be recognized by the N-terminus specific antibody. Therefore, although the production of the stable 40 kDa receptor species by proteolytic removal of a portion of the N-terminal appears to be the predominant route, there exists an additional pathway of degradation which must involve the initial cleavage of the carboxyl terminal."
