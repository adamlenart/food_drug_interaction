The simultaneous occurrence of various QRS morphology during supraventricular tachycardia results in a challenging diagnostic ECG problem. The cycle length during tachycardia with left bundle branch block was longer than the cycle length during narrow QRS supraventricular tachycardia and with functional right bundle-branch block. Electrophysiologic studies revealed fixed V-A conduction time and increased V-A conduction during tachycardia with left bundle branch block. These studies suggested the presence of a concealed left-sided anomalous pathway. Differentiation between intra- and extranodal re-entry and therapeutic modalities are also discussed.", 
    "1": "Although many studies have been carried out on the dopaminergic system, little is known about the dopaminergic system in the ovary. The present study was undertaken to investigate the role of the dopamine (DA) system in ovarian function especially in steroidogenesis using rat ovaries. Ovarian cells from PMS-treated rats were incubated for 1 hour with or without DA or other drugs. DA, norepinephrine (NE) and isoproterenol (Iso) increased the levels of progesterone (P4) and cAMP in the media. D1 agonists (SKF38393, SKF82526-J, CY208-243) increased P4 secretion, whereas bromocriptine (D2 agonists) did not show any effect on the P4 level in the media. The effect of NE and Iso on P4 and cAMP levels was inhibited by propranolol (Pro; beta-blocker), while the increase of P4 and cAMP levels caused by DA or D1 agonists was suppressed by bulbocapnine (Bul; D1 antagonists). Propranolol (beta-blocker) or domperidone (D2 antagonists) did not affect the levels of P4 and cAMP. The presence of dopamine D1 receptor in the PMS-treated rat ovary was revealed by a kinetic study. The maximal number of binding sites (Bmax) of ovarian D1 receptor was 1.33fmol/mg tissue and the Kd value was 0.357nM. These results suggest that the DA system may physiologically play a role in the steroidogenesis in the ovary through D1 receptor.", 
    "2": "We studied the effects of various beta-adrenoceptor (beta AR) antagonists and local anesthetics (LAs), i.e. substances possessing one basic and one lipophilic domain each, on activation of regulatory heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G-proteins). In membranes of differentiated HL-60 cells, propranolol activated high-affinity GTP hydrolysis with a half-maximal effect at 0.19 mM and a maximum at 1 mM. There was a close correlation between the log Q values (logarithm of the octanol: water partition coefficient) of beta AR antagonists and the logarithm of their effectiveness at activating GTPase (EC 3.6.1.-) in HL-60 membranes. The lipophilic LA, tetracaine, was also an effective activator of GTPase in HL-60 membranes, whereas more hydrophilic LAs were less stimulatory (bupivacaine and lidocaine) or even inhibitory (procaine). Propranolol and tetracaine also stimulated binding of guanosine 5'-O-[3-thio]triphosphate (GTP[gamma S]) to HL-60 membranes, but their stimulatory effects on GTP[gamma S] binding were smaller than on GTP hydrolysis. The stimulatory effects of propranolol and tetracaine on GTPase and GTP[gamma S] binding were inhibited by pertussis toxin. Propranolol and tetracaine effectively activated GTP hydrolysis of a reconstituted mixture of bovine brain Gi/Go-proteins, but the concentrations of substances needed for GTPase activation were higher than in HL-60 membranes. Procaine showed stimulatory effects on the GTPase of Gi/Go-proteins. Our data show that beta AR antagonists and LAs activate pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins, presumably through interaction with the C-terminus of their alpha-subunits. Apparently, the lipophilic domain of beta AR antagonists and LAs is more important for G-protein activation than the basic domain. We discuss the possibility that activation of nucleoside diphosphate kinase by beta AR antagonists and LAs contributes to their stimulatory effects on GTP hydrolysis in HL-60 membranes.", 
    "3": "Direct and persistent effects of chronic neonatal administration of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol on brain noradrenergic activity were investigated by measuring tissue concentrations of noradrenaline and its metabolites and in vivo overflow of noradrenaline during adulthood. Rat pups were chronically treated with propranolol from postnatal day 1 to day 10. Determination of monoamine metabolism after the last injection showed an increase in noradrenaline metabolism in frontal cortex, limbic system and hippocampus of propranolol-exposed rats, but 47 days after this last injection it was apparent that these effects were not long-lasting. Moreover, basal noradrenaline overflow in vivo in the hippocampus of 40-55 day-old propranolol-exposed rats did not differ from that in controls. However, the regulation of noradrenaline release seemed to have been altered, since a pharmacological challenge with the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan induced an enhanced increase in the in vivo noradrenaline overflow in propranolol-exposed rats compared to controls. It is suggested that the neonatal beta-blockade induced a supersensitivity of the presynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptor. The precise mechanism underlying this effect has to be elucidated.", 
    "4": "1. K+ efflux rate and control of K+ reuptake rate in exercising muscle cells was examined in six healthy female volunteers. 2. A K(+)-selective electrode in the femoral vein continuously monitored K+ concentration ([K+]fv) during bicycling. Power was increased stepwise 5-6 times by 30-40 W every fourth minute until exhaustion before and after I.V. administration of propranolol. Leg blood flow was measured by bolus injections of Cardiogreen. 3. [K+]fv increased from about 4.3 to 6.8 mmol l-1 at exhaustion both before and after propranolol administration, but after drug infusion endurance was reduced from 22.2 +/- 0.6 to 19.7 +/- 1.1 min, so [K+]fv rose more rapidly. 4. The exercise-induced efflux rate of K+ from the muscle cells was estimated to be about 11 mumol kg-1s-1 at exhaustion both before and after propranolol administration. 5. As an indicator of rate of net loss of K+ from the leg, veno-arterial concentration differences ([K+]fv-a) during first, fourth and fifth power increments were high after 15 and 40 s, but declined toward the end of each power step. Propranolol accentuated [K+]fv-a only after 15 and 40 s of the first and fourth increments. 6. The exercise-induced increase in reuptake rate of K+ in the muscle, estimated at exhaustion, was not significantly changed by propranolol and was about 10 mumol kg-1s-1, corresponding to about 15% of maximum Na(+)-K+ pump capacity in man. 7. Extracellular accumulation and loss of K+ from muscle during bicycle exercise is due to Na(+)-K+ pump lag. The higher [K+]fv during propranolol is mainly due to impaired redistribution outside the exercising muscles. In addition at low powers, beta-adrenoceptor blockade caused a transiently increased net loss due to an accentuated Na(+)-K+ pump lag.", 
    "5": "A new method has been developed for the analysis of propranolol plus five major metabolites in perfusate from isolated liver preparations, and also in rat serum and dog plasma. The regional isomers of hydroxypropranolol are clearly separated within a total run time of less than 15 min. The basic and neutral metabolites are extracted and analysed together, while the acidic metabolites are extracted in a second step. The new assay is more simple and time efficient than previously published methods.", 
    "6": "Previous studies in the field of beta-adrenergic drugs had supported the hypothesis of the existence of a bioisosterism between the [(methyleneamino)oxy]methyl moiety (C = NOCH2, MAOMM) of type B beta-blocking drugs and the aryl (Ar) of type A beta-blocking agents. In the MAOMM, however, the carbon of the CH2 linked to the oximic oxygen possesses a hybridization (sp3) and a geometry different from those of the corresponding carbon of Ar which possesses an sp2 hybridization. Furthermore, in the MAOMM, in its preferred conformation, the unsaturated portion (C = N) is situated in a spatial area which does not correspond exactly to the area occupied by Ar. The formal inversion of the atomic sequence C = NOCH2 of the MAOMM leads to a different type of group, the [(methyloxy)imino]methyl moiety (CH2ON = C, MOIMM), which, in the E configuration, appears to present greater steric and electronic analogies with an Ar, with respect to the MAOMM. On the basis of these observations, some completely aliphatic (E)-N-(3-amino-2- hydroxypropylidene)(alkyloxy)amino derivatives of type C (11a,b and 12a, b) were synthesized, the their beta-adrenergic properties were compared with those of the corresponding [(methyleneamino)oxy]-methyl isomers of type B (19a, b and 20a, b). The similar beta-adrenergic properties of 11, 12 and 19, 20 evaluated in vitro both by radioligand binding assays and by functional tests on isolated preparations, are discussed on the basis of considerations regarding the spatial correspondences and electronic analogies between the MOIMM and the MAOMM.", 
    "7": "The aortic root enlarges progressively in Marfan's syndrome, and this enlargement is associated with aortic regurgitation and dissection. Long-term treatment with beta-adrenergic blockade, by reducing the impulse (i.e., the rate of pressure change in the aortic root) of left ventricular ejection and the heart rate, may protect the aortic root.", 
    "8": "We conducted an open-label, randomized trial of propranolol in adolescent and adult patients with classic Marfan's syndrome (32 treated and 38 untreated [control] patients). Aortic-root dimensions and clinical end points (aortic regurgitation, aortic dissection, cardiovascular surgery, congestive heart failure, and death) were monitored for an average of 9.3 years in the control group and 10.7 years in the treatment group. All 70 patients were included in the analysis according to the intention-to-treat principle.", 
    "9": "The dose of propranolol was individualized; the mean (+/- SE) dose was 212 +/- 68 mg per day. The mean slope of the regression line for the aortic-root dimensions, which reflect the rate of dilatation, was significantly lower in the treatment group than in the control group (0.023 vs. 0.084 per year, P < 0.001). Clinical end points were reached in five patients in the treatment group and nine in the control group. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve for the treatment group differed significantly from that for the control group during the middle years of the trial and remained better for the treatment group throughout the study.",

    "11": "The effects of the K+ channel activators, levcromakalim, pinacidil and diazoxide, at comparable antihypertensive doses, on acute glucose tolerance and glibenclamide-induced hypoglycaemia were examined in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Levcromakalim (0.15 mg.kg-1 p.o.) and pinacidil (1.0 mg.kg-1 p.o.) caused a slight, but short-lived, impairment of glucose tolerance following oral or s.c. administration of glucose (2.0 g.kg-1). This effect, although small, was abolished by the beta-adrenoceptor blocker, propranolol (2.0 mg.kg-1 p.o.). Diazoxide (30.0 mg.kg-1 p.o.) caused a marked and sustained impairment of oral glucose tolerance and s.c. glucose tolerance, the profile of which was quantitatively and qualitatively different from levcromakalim or pinacidil and was not significantly affected by propranolol. Glibenclamide (1.0-10. mg.kg-1 p.o.) elicited a dose-related hypoglycaemic response. Levcromakalim or pinacidil had little or no significant effect on the hypoglycaemic response elicited by glibenclamide (3.0 mg.kg-1). Conversely, diazoxide both abolished and reversed glibenclamide-induced hypoglycaemia. We conclude that levcromakalim and pinacidil have only marginal and transient effects on glycaemic control in conscious SHR and that these disturbances are probably mediated indirectly via reflex activation of the sympathetic nervous system in response to blood pressure lowering. In addition, at active antihypertensive doses neither levcromakalim nor pinacidil significantly interfered with the ability of glibenclamide to reduce blood glucose concentration. Diazoxide's impairment of oral glucose tolerance, s.c. glucose tolerance and glibenclamide response confirms this drug's well known ability to activate pancreatic KATP channels.", 
    "12": "An isolated, perfused and ventilated guinea-pig lung was used to compare the duration of effect of the bronchodilating beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists formoterol, salmeterol and terbutaline. Lung conductance was measured real time with the aid of a computer. Bronchoconstriction was induced in the preparation every 10 min by bolus injections of acetylcholine into the pulmonary artery. Lung conductance was reduced by about 70% after acetylcholine. The test compounds or the vehicle was administered for 1 min as aerosols generated from solutions: formoterol (10 mumol/l), salmeterol (100 mumol/l) and terbutaline (1000 mumol/l). This treatment inhibited the response to acetylcholine by 50-60% within the first 10 min for all three test compounds. The onset of action appeared to be slower for salmeterol than for formoterol and terbutaline. The inhibitory effect of terbutaline disappeared completely during the next 20 min of continuous perfusion (single pass), while both formoterol and salmeterol displayed a significant inhibitory effect 40 min after their administration. Formoterol, when inhaled at a higher dose (100 mumol/l), caused a 90% inhibition of the response to acetylcholine. This effect was completely reversed by 0.1 mumol/l propranolol in the perfusion medium. There were in general no major changes in the basal conductance measured between the acetylcholine provocations.", 
    "13": "In the present work, the effects of neurotransmitter antagonists on theophylline-induced changes in body temperature were investigated. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of a low dose of theophylline (25 mg/kg) induced slight hyperthermia, while high doses (75 and 100 mg/kg) induced hypothermia. The hypothermic effect of theophylline was decreased by pretreatment of animals with the dopamine D2 receptor antagonists sulpiride (15 and 30 mg/kg i.p.) and pimozide (0.125 and 0.25 mg/kg i.p.), the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine (2.5 and 5 mg/kg i.p.) and the 5-HT receptor antagonist metergoline (0.25 mg/kg i.p.). However, the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390 (0.05 and 0.5 mg/kg i.p.), the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phenoxybenzamine (2.5 and 5 mg/kg i.p.) and the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (5 and 10 mg/kg i.p.) did not after the theophylline response. In reserpinized mice, theophylline caused a dose-dependent rise in body temperature. The response was blocked in animals pretreated with phenoxybenzamine, propranolol and atropine. Single treatment of animals with either SCH 23390 or sulpiride, and also with a combination of the two drugs, decreased the hyperthermia induced by theophylline in reserpinized mice. Pimozide or metergoline did not have any effect in this respect. These data suggest that the hypothermic response to theophylline may be mediated through dopaminergic, cholinergic and serotonergic mechanisms. The hyperthermic action of theophylline in reserpinized animals may be mediated through dopaminergic, cholinergic and adrenergic systems. Overall it seems likely that theophylline interacts with modulatory mechanisms involved in thermoregulation.", 
    "14": "Recognizing the need to identify and quantify the alterations in myocardial function and structure induced by weightlessness and to clarify the underlying mechanisms, we have devoted ourselves to the present serial work in recent years. To achieve this, firstly, some modifications to the model originally introduced by Morey-Holton and Wronski (1981) were made, so as to make the suspension period prolonged to more than 120 days with least stressful influence and no injurious effects on the tail skin. Secondly, the cardiovascular deconditioning effects of this model were confirmed in conscious rats. Thirdly, changes in myocardial contractile function and ultrastructure after tail-suspension were studied. The main purpose of this paper is to review our recent progress with comments and perspectives.", 
    "15": "The purpose of this study was to screen atenolol as a candidate for transdermal drug delivery, and to study the release of atenolol from various gels. The percent atenolol release over time profiles indicates that for all the gelling agents used the amount of atenolol released is decreased by increasing the polymer concentration in the gel. The amount of atenolol released was found to be higher from Klucel gels, compared to Methocel and Carbopol gels, with Carbopol gels giving the least release. In studying the effect of atenolol concentration in the gel, it was observed that the amount of atenolol released was increased by increasing the drug concentration in the donor up to a limit corresponding to an atenolol concentration of approximately 2%. This seems to resemble the saturation solubility of atenolol into the gels. Hairless mouse skin and TESTSKIN LSE were used as in vitro skin models.", 
    "16": "The overflows (i.e., veno-arterial concentration differences multiplied by plasma flow) of angiotensin-(1-10) decapeptide (ANG I) and angiotensin-(1-8) octapeptide (ANG II) from blood-perfused canine gracilis muscle in situ were studied. Special precautions were taken to minimized ex vivo generation and/or degradation of angiotensins in the sampled blood. ANG I was found to be generated in the catheter system supplying the gracilis muscle with arterial blood, but plasma renin activity and ANG II levels were uninfluenced by the catheter system. A positive venoarterial concentration difference over the muscle itself was found for ANG II but not for ANG I under basal conditions. Isoprenaline elicited vasodilatation, reduced ANG I overflow, and tended to increase ANG II overflow, whereas beta-adrenoceptor blockade by propranolol had no effect on these variables. In conclusion, we found no evidence for a local de novo synthesis of ANG II from the gracilis muscle vasculature in vivo. The net overflow of ANG II was most likely caused by local conversion in the tissue of ANG I artifactually generated in the arterial catheter system. beta-Adrenoceptor stimulation enhanced the local conversion of ANG I to ANG II, probably by exposing a greater endothelial surface containing angiotensin-converting enzyme activity.", 
    "17": "In dogs and humans, heat stress is associated with an increase in cardiac output that sustains blood flow to heat-dissipating organs. Because cardiac output and venous return are equal in the steady state, the circulation must also adjust in heat stress to allow the venous return to increase. To analyze these adjustments, we measured blood volumes, unstressed volumes, blood flow distribution, venous compliance, venous resistance, and the time constant of venous drainage of the splanchnic and extrasplanchnic vascular beds in dogs anesthetized with alpha-chloralose at normal and at high core temperatures. We repeated the measurements at high core temperatures with ganglionic blockade, alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade, or beta-adrenergic receptor blockade to determine the efferent neurohumoral pathway. When core temperature was increased from 37.8 +/- 0.2 to 41.9 +/- 0.1 degrees C, total splanchnic blood volume decreased 23% (4.6 +/- 1.4 ml/kg) and splanchnic unstressed volume decreased 38.5%. None of the other determinants of venous return changed. Ganglionic blockade shifted the total and unstressed splanchnic blood volume during heat stress back to normothermic values. However, beta- and alpha-blockade did not affect splanchnic volumes. We conclude that a decrease in splanchnic unstressed volume is an important factor for the increased venous return during heat stress. Although mediated through sympathetic ganglions, this decrease is not abolished by alpha- or beta-receptor blockade.", 
    "18": "Eight chronically instrumented conscious dogs were used to test the hypothesis that left ventricular (LV) relaxation is accelerated during cardiac tamponade. The time constant of LV transmural pressure fall was measured before and during intrapericardial (IP) saline infusion (baseline) with and without beta-adrenergic blockade (propranolol 1 mg/kg iv). Heart rate was controlled by atrial pacing. Increasing IP pressure caused a progressive linear decrease in stroke volume before and during beta-blockade in each animal. The time constant of LV transmural pressure fall also decreased continuously with an increase in IP pressure from 26 +/- 7 ms during baseline to 18 +/- 5 ms during severe cardiac tamponade (P < 0.01) before beta-blockade. However, after beta-blockade, the time constant of LV transmural pressure fall was constant over a wide range of IP pressures despite a continuous decrease in LV end-diastolic volume. The time constant of LV transmural pressure fall was not altered by vena caval occlusions that caused the same decrease in LV preload observed during cardiac tamponade. We concluded that despite decreased pump function, LV relaxation was accelerated progressively during graded cardiac tamponade, and this change was dependent not on changes in loading conditions but on an intact beta-adrenergic influence.", 
    "19": "The analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) provides information on neural control of the heart. We investigated HRV in normal rats and in models of experimental cardiac hypertrophy using the Holter monitoring and peak/trough method. In normal rats, two heart rate oscillations with different wavelengths, high frequency (HF) and low frequency (LF) oscillations, were detected. The HF oscillations were insensitive to propranolol and suppressed by atropine. The LF oscillations were sensitive to both antagonists. Thyrotoxicosis resulted in cardiac hypertrophy (+20%) and tachycardia. The HF oscillations were unchanged, whereas LF oscillations were hampered at low heart rate in this group. Aortic stenosis resulted in cardiac hypertrophy (+53%), but heart rate oscillations were unchanged. The (number x amplitude) product for both types of oscillations correlated with heart rate in controls but not in the thyrotoxicosis or aortic stenosis models. Alterations of HRV in cardiac hypertrophy occur in rats as in humans. They may reflect the changes in the molecular components of the adrenergic/muscarinic system, which defines the new myocardial phenotype.", 
    "20": "In this study, we examined how locally mediated hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction is modulated by autonomic nervous system activation during global alveolar hypoxia (GAH) accompanied by systemic hypoxemia. Using an X-ray television system on the in vivo cat lung, we measured changes in the internal diameter (ID) during GAH and regional alveolar hypoxia (RAH) without systemic hypoxemia in identical small pulmonary arteries and veins (100-600 microns ID). We also analyzed the effects of the autonomic nervous system blockade on the hypoxic ID changes. During GAH the ID of the arteries reduced by 5 +/- 1 and 3 +/- 1% with 10 and 5% O2 inhalations, respectively, whereas during RAH the arterial ID reduced by 12 +/- 1 and 18 +/- 1% with 10 and 5% O2 inhalations, respectively. The magnitude of the ID reduction was significantly smaller during GAH than during RAH. After pretreatment with propranolol, however, GAH induced large ID reductions (16 +/- 1 and 23 +/- 1% with 10 and 5% O2 inhalations) with patterns very similar to those seen during RAH. Phentolamine and atropine had no effect on the response during GAH. The ID reductions during RAH, on the other hand, were unaffected by all the blockers. The results indicate that, in the cat, alveolar hypoxia per se acts locally to constrict the small pulmonary vessels and that the hypoxic vasoconstriction is attenuated by a beta-receptor-mediated vasodilator effect during GAH with systemic hypoxemia. In addition, we found that, after adrenalectomy plus ganglion blockade with hexamethonium bromide, the GAH-induced ID reduction with 5% O2 inhalation was enhanced from 3 to 19%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "21": "Utilizing a combination of mechanical and chemical unilateral denervation, we have examined the relevance of renal innervation for the expression of renin in kidneys of adult rats. Renal denervation led to a reduction by 57 +/- 4% of renin-containing areas in denervated kidneys as quantitated by morphometry of kidney sections immunoreactive against a polyclonal antirenin antibody. Preprorenin mRNA content in the denervated kidneys fell to 46 +/- 7% of the contralateral innervated kidneys. Treatment of rats with the beta 1-adrenoreceptor antagonist metoprolol (100 mg.kg-1.day-1) for 2 days decreased renal renin mRNA levels to 71% of control levels. Unilateral renal denervation led to a further decrease of renin mRNA levels also in metoprolol-treated animals to 60% of the values found in the contralateral kidneys. Hypotensive hemorrhage led to a 1.4-fold increase of renin mRNA in the kidneys of sham-treated animals. In unilaterally denervated rats renin mRNA increased to levels similar to those in sham-operated animals in both denervated and in contralateral innervated kidneys in response to bleeding. As a consequence, the ratio of abundance of renin mRNA in the denervated to the innervated kidneys rose to 86 +/- 7%. Pretreatment of the animals with metoprolol, on the other hand, prevented the rise of renin mRNA in response to hypotensive hemorrhage. Our findings suggest that in the adult organism renal neural input significantly contributes to the expression of renin under basal conditions, while it appears to be of less importance for stimulation of renin gene expression by severe blood loss.", 
    "22": "We examined epithelial modulation of tracheal smooth muscle (TSM) responsiveness in vitro from guinea pigs receiving active immune sensitization in vivo. Initially, guinea pigs were either ovalbumin sensitized (by aerosol) or sham sensitized with normal saline; TSM responsiveness was assessed isometrically as active tension (AT) after equilibration by electrical field stimulation in vitro. For epithelium-intact (Epi+) tissues, sensitization caused an increase in baseline active spontaneous tone (1.89 +/- 0.20 g AT) vs. sham-sensitized tissues (1.18 +/- 0.28 g AT; P = 0.02). Spontaneous tone in sensitized TSM in which the epithelium was removed (Epi-) (1.01 +/- 0.14 g AT) was substantially less than from Epi+ tissues (P = 0.01) and did not differ from sham-sensitized epithelium-denuded tissues (0.82 +/- 0.24 g AT; P > 0.05). Indomethacin caused a reduction in spontaneous tone to comparable magnitude for all treatment paradigms. Immune sensitization caused physiological reduction in the ability to relax in response to isoproterenol; the concentration of isoproterenol eliciting 50% relaxation of spontaneous tone was 7.10 +/- 0.13 (-log M) for TSM from sensitized guinea pigs compared with 8.20 +/- 0.27 (-log M) for sham-sensitized tissues (P = 0.006). However, after precontraction with exogenous acetylcholine, relaxation caused by isoproterenol was not affected by either indomethacin or epithelial removal. Muscarinic responsiveness to acetylcholine was augmented by immune sensitization; however, the increase in response to acetylcholine was attenuated by epithelium removal or cyclooxygenase blockade.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "23": "Responses of beta-adrenoceptor (beta-AR) in rat soleus to gravitational unloading and/or changes in the levels of phosphorus compounds by feeding either creatine or its analogue beta-guanidinopropionic acid (beta-GPA) were studied. A decrease in the density of beta-AR (about -35%) was induced by 10 days of hindlimb suspension, but the affinity of the receptor was unaffected. Suspension unloading tended to increase the levels of adenosine triphosphate and phosphocreatine and decrease inorganic phosphate. Even without unloading, the beta-AR density decreased after an oral creatine supplementation (about -20%), which also tended to elevate the high-energy phosphate levels in muscle. However, an elevation of beta-AR density was induced (about +36%) after chronic depletion of high-energy phosphates by feeding beta-GPA (about +125%). Data suggest that the density of beta-AR in muscle is elevated if the high-energy phosphate contents are chronically decreased and vice versa. However, it may not be directly related to the degree of muscle contractile activity.",

    "25": "The effect of late percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) of an occluded infarct-related artery on left ventricular ejection fraction was studied in patients with a recent, first Q-wave myocardial infarction in a prospective, randomized study. Forty-four patients (31 men and 13 women, mean age 58 +/- 12 years) with an occluded infarct-related coronary artery were randomized to PTCA (n = 25) or no PTCA (n = 19). Patients received acetylsalicylic acid, a beta blocker and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor unless contraindicated. Left ventricular ejection fraction was determined at baseline and 4 months. Coronary angiography was repeated at 4 months. Baseline ejection fraction measured 20 +/- 12 days after myocardial infarction was 45 +/- 12% in both groups. PTCA was performed 21 +/- 13 days after the event. The primary PTCA success rate was 72%. One patient in each group died before angiographic follow-up, which was completed in 37 of the remaining 42 patients (88%; 21 with and 16 without PTCA). At 4 months, the infarct-related artery was patent in 43% of PTCA patients and in 19% of no PTCA patients (p = NS). Reocclusion occurred in 40% of patients after successful PTCA. Secondary analyses showed that the change in left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly greater in patients with a patent infarct-related artery (+9.4 +/- 6.2%) than in those with an occluded artery (+1.6 +/- 8.8%; p = 0.0096). Baseline ejection fraction also independently predicted improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (p = 0.0001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "26": "The drug 2,3-butanedione monoxime (BDM) was suggested to be a potent cardioprotective agent useful for cardiopreservation. The present study investigated the activity of BDM and its mechanism of action in human myocardium. In electrically driven left ventricular papillary muscle strips and right atrial trabeculae from failing (heart transplants) and nonfailing (donor hearts) human myocardium, isometric force development and the force-frequency relationship were examined. To study the sarcolemmal actions of BDM, competition experiments with 125I-iodocyanopindolol, 3H-ouabain and 3H(+)PN 200-110 were performed. The effect of BDM on the contractile apparatus was tested by investigating its effects on Ca++ sensitivity and on the relaxation parameters of skinned fiber preparations. In papillary muscle strips and in atrial trabeculae, BDM (0.001-30 mM) depressed the isometric force of contraction in a concentration-dependent manner. BDM was more potent in atrial than in ventricular tissue and it shifted the Ca++ concentration-response curve in atrial and ventricular tissue to the right. The potency of BDM to depress force development was significantly lower compared with the L type of Ca++ channel antagonist nifedipine in both atrial and ventricular myocardium. In the presence of 10 mM BDM, the force-frequency relationship becomes positive in failing myocardium but not in the presence of 1 mM BDM, which did not affect the specific binding of 125I-iodocyanopindolol, 3H-ouabain or 3H(+)PN 200-110. This indicated there was no action on beta adrenoceptors, cardiac glycoside receptors and dihydropyridine-type Ca++ channels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "27": "Cocaine produces apparent myocardial ischemia in some individuals without deleterious effects in others. The authors identified a subset of rats in which cocaine produces a decrease in cardiac output and an increase in cardiomyopathies. In the present study, several potential causes of this differential responsiveness were examined in conscious rats instrumented for cardiac output determination by using pulsed Doppler flowmetry. Although arterial pressure and heart rate responses to cocaine (5 mg/kg i.v.) were similar in all rats, cardiac output responses varied widely. Specifically, in 17 of 36 rats, cocaine elicited a maximum decrease of greater than 15% that was relatively consistent with repeated trials. These rats were designated responders, whereas the remaining rats with little change or an increase in cardiac output were classified as nonresponders. Pentolinium (7.5 mg/kg) or adrenal demedullation reduced the peak cardiac output responses in both groups such that there was no longer a difference between responders and nonresponders. Prazosin (0.1 mg/kg) reduced the cocaine-induced pressor responses in all rats and selectively reduced the decrease in cardiac output in responders. Propranolol (1 mg/kg) reduced the peak pressor response but enhanced the decrease in cardiac output in responders. Neither indomethacin (5 mg/kg) or heparin (300 units) pretreatment altered the cocaine-induced cardiac output or peripheral vascular effects in either responders or nonresponders. Amphetamine (1 mg/kg) elicited smaller pressor responses but still evoked a net decrease in cardiac output in responders.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Recently, a K channel blocker, quinine, has been reported to inhibit cell proliferation and protein synthesis in lymphocytes, implicating physiologic roles for K channels in lymphocytes. The effect of quinine on protein synthesis in human alveolar macrophages, however, has not been determined, although alveolar macrophages have been reported to have two types of K channels. Therefore, we investigated the effect of quinine on TNF-alpha production from human alveolar macrophages. The production of TNF-alpha was induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. We obtained the following results. First, LPS induced time-dependent activation of both types of K channels. Second, quinine inhibited TNF-alpha release in a dose-dependent fashion at concentrations of 50 to 200 microM, concentrations capable of blocking both types of K channels, with no appreciable reduction of phagocytosis of latex beads. Third, the compound remarkably inhibited the expression of TNF-alpha mRNA without any appreciable effect on the expression of beta-actin mRNA. These results indicate that both types of K channels are activated by stimulation with LPS and that quinine, at concentrations required to inhibit K channels, specifically blocks TNF-alpha production of human alveolar macrophages at the level of gene transcription.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a beta-adrenergic blocking drug could reduce the severity of these symptoms and signs in these patients, as previously reported in patients with hyperthyroidism. Eleven patients (mean age, 42 +/- 11 yr; 10 females and one male) affected with differentiated thyroid carcinoma or nontoxic goiter were selected from a more numerous group of patients receiving suppressive therapy based on the presence of palpitations, increased heart rate, left ventricular systolic function, and other symptoms mimicking exaggerated beta-adrenergic activity. In these patients the cardioselective beta-blocking drug bisoprolol was added to the L-T4 suppressive therapy at a dose of 2.5-5 mg/day. Blood samples were collected for the determination of thyroid hormones and TSH concentration during L-T4 therapy and after 3 and 6 months of associated L-T4 plus bisoprolol therapy. Cardiac function was assessed by clinical evaluation, standard and Holter electrocardiogram, as well as one- and two-dimensional echocardiography. Furthermore, we applied the symptom-rating scale previously used by Klein et al. in hyperthyroid patients to assess the quality of life in our group of patients. Our findings show that the addition of bisoprolol to L-T4 suppressive therapy produces a normalization of heart rate, which was significantly increased during TSH suppressive therapy, and the disappearance of atrial arrhythmias with considerable reduction of palpitations. Furthermore, bisoprolol produced an effective improvement in measures of the hyperthyroid symptom scale, with significant reduction of the mean score. The echocardiographic data showed an increased left ventricular mass index with significantly enhanced systolic function at the basal evaluation. After 6 months of combined L-T4 plus bisoprolol therapy, left ventricular mass index normalized, and the indices of left ventricular systolic function were reduced, with a tendency to normalize. Further studies conducted on a larger series of patients are required to verify the long term implications of cardiac parameter variations on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Our results, however, show that the addition of bisoprolol to L-T4 suppressive therapy improves the quality of life in those patients with clinical features of enhanced adrenergic activity.", 
    "61": "Sepsis and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) trigger the systemic release of both cytokines and catecholamines. Cytokines are known to be capable of eliciting a stress hormone response in vivo. The present study sought insight into the effect of noradrenaline on LPS-induced release of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in human whole blood. Whole blood was incubated with LPS for 4 h at 37 degrees C in the presence and absence of noradrenaline and/or specific alpha and beta antagonists and agonists. Noradrenaline caused a dose-dependent inhibition of LPS-induced TNF and IL-6 production. This effect could be completely prevented by addition of the specific beta 1, antagonist metoprolol, while it was not affected by the alpha antagonist phentolamine. Specific beta-adrenergic stimulation by isoprenaline mimicked the inhibiting effect of noradrenaline on LPS-evoked cytokine production, whereas alpha-adrenergic stimulation by phenylephrine had no effect. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis demonstrated that beta-adrenergic stimulation had no effect on LPS binding to and internalization into mononuclear cells or on the expression of CD14, the major receptor for LPS on mononuclear cells. In acute sepsis, enhanced release of noradrenaline may be part of a negative feedback mechanism meant to inhibit ongoing TNF and IL-6 production.", 
    "62": "The Dictyostelium discoideum NC4 genome harbors approximately 150 individual copies of a retrotransposable element called the Dictyostelium repetitive element (DRE). This element contains nonidentical terminal repeats (TRs) consisting of conserved building blocks A and B in the left TR and B and C in the right TR. Seven different-sized classes of RNA transcripts from these elements were resolved by Northern (RNA) blot analysis, but their combined abundance was very low. When D. discoideum cells were grown in the presence of the respiratory chain blocker antimycin A, steady-state concentrations of these RNA species increased 10- to 20-fold. The D. discoideum genome contains two DRE subtypes, the full-length 5.7-kb DREa and the internally deleted 2.4-kb DREb. Both subtypes are transcribed, as confirmed by analysis of cloned cDNA. Primary transcripts from the sense strand originate at nucleotide +1 and terminate at two dominant sites, located 21 or 28 nucleotides upstream from the 3' end of the elements. The activity of a reasonably strong polymerase II promoter in the 5'-terminal A module is slightly upregulated by the tRNA gene located 50 +/- 4 nucleotides upstream and drastically reduced by the adjacent B module of the DRE. Transcripts from the opposite DNA strand (complementary-sense transcripts) were also detected, directed by an internally located polymerase II promoter residing within the C module. This latter transcription was initiated at multiple sites within the oligo(dA12) stretch which terminates DREs.", 
    "63": "The selective serotonin (5-HT) agonist 8-hydroxydipropylaminotetralin (8-OH-DPAT) has been extensively used to characterize the physiological, biochemical, and behavioral features of the 5-HT1A receptor. A further characterization of this receptor subtype was conducted with membrane preparations from rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus. The saturation binding isotherms of [3H]8-OH-DPAT (free ligand from 200 pM to 160 nM) revealed high-affinity 5-HT1A receptors (KH = 0.7-0.8 nM) and low-affinity (KL = 22-36 nM) binding sites. The kinetics of [3H]8-OH-DPAT binding were examined at two ligand concentrations, i.e., 1 and 10 nM, and in each case revealed two dissociation rate constants supporting the existence of high- and low-affinity binding sites. When the high-affinity sites were labeled with a 1 nM concentration of [3H]8-OH-DPAT, the competition curves of agonist and antagonist drugs were best fit to a two-site model, indicating the presence of two different 5-HT1A binding sites or, alternatively, two affinity states, tentatively designated as 5-HT1AHIGH and 5-HT1ALOW. However, the low correlation between the affinities of various drugs for these sites indicates the existence of different and independent binding sites. To determine whether 5-HT1A sites are modulated by 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate, inhibition experiments with 5-HT were performed in the presence or in the absence of 100 microM 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate. The binding of 1 nM [3H]8-OH-DPAT to the 5-HT1AHIGH site was dramatically (80%) reduced by 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate; in contrast, the low-affinity site, or 5-HT1ALOW, was seemingly insensitive to the guanine nucleotide. The findings suggest that the high-affinity 5-HT1AHIGH site corresponds to the classic 5-HT1A receptor, whereas the novel 5-HT1ALOW binding site, labeled by 1 nM [3H]8-OH-DPAT and having a micromolar affinity for 5-HT, may not belong to the G protein family of receptors. To further investigate the relationship of 5-HT1A sites and the 5-HT innervation, rats were treated with p-chlorophenylalanine or with the neurotoxin p-chloroamphetamine. The inhibition of 5-HT synthesis by p-chlorophenylalanine did not alter either of the two 5-HT1A sites, but deafferentation by p-chloroamphetamine caused a loss of the low-affinity [3H]8-OH-DPAT binding sites, indicating that these novel binding sites may be located presynaptically on 5-HT fibers and/or nerve terminals.", 
    "64": "We applied in vivo microdialysis to assess the effects of dopaminergic and beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation on cyclic AMP efflux in rat striatum under chloral hydrate anesthesia. Dopamine (up to 1 mM) infused for 20 min through the probe did not increase cyclic AMP, whereas both the selective dopamine D1 agonist SKF 38393 and D2 antagonist sulpiride produced modest increases. It is interesting that the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol produced a marked increase (204.7% of basal level at 1 mM) which was antagonized by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol. Pretreatment with a glial selective metabolic inhibitor, fluorocitrate (1 mM), by a 5-h infusion through the probe attenuated basal cyclic AMP efflux by 30.3% and significantly blocked the response to isoproterenol. By contrast, striatal injection of a neurotoxin, kainic acid (2.5 micrograms), 2 days before the dialysis experiment did not affect basal cyclic AMP or the response to isoproterenol, but blocked the response to SKF 38393. These data demonstrate the beta-adrenoceptors as well as dopamine receptors contribute to cyclic AMP efflux in rat striatum in vivo. They also suggest that basal and beta-adrenoceptor-stimulated cyclic AMP efflux are substantially dependent on intact glial cells.", 
    "65": "We characterized the mechanisms underlying acute endotoxin-induced alterations in glucose metabolism and determined the extent to which catecholamines mediate these changes. Acute endotoxemia was induced in chronically catheterized awake rats by a bolus injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 1 mg/kg; LD10). Basal glucose turnover (Rt; infusion of [5-3H]glucose), in vivo insulin action on overall glucose utilization (euglycemic clamp), glycolysis, and glycogen synthesis were determined in four groups of rats. These groups received 1) LPS (LPS rats; n = 6), 2) saline (control rats; n = 6), 3) LPS and alpha beta-blockade (alpha beta-blockade and LPS rats; n = 9), or 4) saline and alpha beta-blockade (alpha beta-blockade control rats; n = 9). In the basal state, LPS induced hypotension and transient hyperglycemia. These changes were associated with glycogen depletion in both skeletal muscle and liver, and increased Rt. During hyperinsulinemia, whole body glucose disposal was 37% decreased (105 vs. 166 mumol/kg.min; P < 0.01). This whole body insulin resistance was characterized by decreased glycogen synthesis and glycogen synthase activity, but not by altered whole body glycolysis. alpha beta-Blockade abolished transient hyperglycemia, increased Rt, and accelerated basal liver glycogen depletion (45 vs. 105 mmol/kg dry, LPS and alpha beta-blockade rats vs. LPS rats; P < 0.05), but inhibited muscle glycogenolysis. alpha beta-Blockade did not reverse the insulin resistance induced by endotoxin. These data suggest that catecholamines counteract the LPS-induced increase in basal glucose turnover and stimulate muscle glycogenolysis during acute endotoxemia. These effects might explain the better preservation of hepatic glycogen in the absence than in the presence of alpha beta-blockade and serve as a defense mechanism against hypoglycemia. Catecholamines do not seem to be the immediate causes of insulin resistance during acute endotoxemia.", 
    "66": "Mitogenic stimulation of NIH3T3 fibroblasts with growth factors or ras oncogenes is associated with an increase in the levels of phosphorylcholine and diacylglycerol. Both metabolites could be generated as a result of direct activation of a phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC) or by a more complex pathway, involving activation of phospholipase D followed by choline kinase and phosphatidic acid-hydrolase. We show evidence indicating that the generation of phosphorylcholine and diacylglycerol follow independent mechanisms in both serum-treated and in ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells. No significant activation of a PC-PLC enzyme was observed. Instead, activation of a phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase D (PC-PLD) was detected. Moreover, while a fivefold constitutive activation of the endogenous PLD activity and a twofold increase on the levels of phosphatidic acid were observed in ras-transformed cells, very small alterations on these parameters were detected at late times after serum stimulation of quiescent cells. Thus, cell proliferation induced by ras oncogenes in fibroblasts cells may be functionally linked to activation of a PC-PLD enzyme. The differences found in the activation of this enzyme between ras-transformed and normal cells may constitute an important difference in mitogenic signalling between normal and transformed cells.",

In all IVGTT was performed. 19 patients with normal K values were randomized to treated with either propranolol 160 mg daily (10 persons) or acebutolol 400 mg daily (9 persons). 12 patients with low K values were randomized to treated with either propranolol (5 persons) or acebutolol (7 persons). After 7 days on treatment a second IVGTT was carried. In all blood samples were glucose, FFA and insulin levels determined, in samples taken at 0 T3 and T4 too. T3, T4 and insulin were measured by the radioimmunoassay, glucose by the glucose oxidase method, FFA by the colorimetric method. In hyperthyroid patients with low K value significantly higher plasma concentrations of FFA were found compared to control and after propranolol or acebutolol treatment no differences in FFA levels between hyperthyroid patients and control were observed. In patients with low K value acebutolol but not propranolol normalized K value and propranolol but not acebutolol significantly decreased acute phase of insulin secretion.

The specific binding of the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist RX 821002 confirms the presence of an alpha 2-adrenoceptor in the human placenta, which has been characterized previously with [3H]-rauwolscine. The major finding presented here is a correlation between the alpha 2- and beta-adrenergic receptor concentrations (r = 0.765) in the human placenta at term. It is suggested that the alpha 2/beta adrenoceptor balance may play an important role in regulation of the vascular bed of the placenta. Determination of the alpha 2/beta ratio may help towards an understanding of the contractility of the placental vascular muscles.", 
    "70": "We have investigated the effect of experimental malaria infection on rat cytochrome P450-mediated drug metabolism using ethoxyresorufin and metoprolol as probe compounds.

However, clearance of metoprolol was unchanged in malaria infection compared with control (control 2.7 +/- 1.2; malaria 4.0 +/- 1.7 mL min-1). The change in clearance of ethoxyresorufin was the result of a decrease in Vmax, with no apparent change in Km. There was no change in either Vmax or Km of metoprolol.

Insulin incubation had no effect on the sensitivity of diabetic tissues to forskolin or on ventricular beta-adrenoceptor number.

    "77": "Neuroendocrine (NE) differentiation within the primary prostate tumor has been correlated with tumor progression and shortened patient survival. Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT), a known mitogen, is found in most neuroendocrine cells of the human prostate. We have previously found that human prostatic carcinoma cell lines, PC-3, DU-145 and LNCaP, display certain NE characteristics. In this study, we have examined the effects of several subtype-selective 5-HT receptor antagonists on the growth of the three lines. Of these, the 5-HT1A antagonist pindobind had the most marked antiproliferative effect in vitro. Pindobind also had marked growth-inhibitory effects on the aggressive PC-3 cell line in vivo, in athymic nude mice. Radioligand binding studies indicated the presence of 5-HT binding sites on all three cell lines. Our results suggest that 5-HT is involved in the growth of prostate tumor cells and may serve as a target for treatment.", 
    "78": "Previous studies suggest that beta-adrenergic blockers reduce craving levels during acute alcohol withdrawal. We conducted a new study to assess whether the daily use of atenolol by the abstinent alcoholic could maintain a blunted craving for alcohol and result in a decreased rate of relapse for alcohol abuse. The study was designed as a randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial. Among all 100 patients (50 atenolol, 50 placebo), only 15 stayed in the trial and remained fully abstinent for 1 year (7 atenolol, 8 placebo). Of the remaining 85 patients, 30 withdrew early while still abstinent (17 atenolol, 13 placebo). In the 57 high-risk patients who reported craving for alcohol at baseline, the treatment failure rates were 90% for patients receiving placebo, and was reduced to 65% in those who received atenolol (risk reduction = 28%, 95% confidence interval, -3% to 49%). The data from this trial also support the observation that poorer levels of treatment adherence are strongly associated with adverse outcomes for alcoholics during follow-up. This relationship was present both for patients who received atenolol and for those who received placebo.", 
    "79": "Changes of intracellular pH (pHi) after alpha-1-adrenoceptor stimulation (5 x 10(-5) mol/l phenylephrine in the presence of 10(-6) mol/l timolol) were studied in isolated perfused rat hearts by 31P-NMR spectroscopy in order to use the whole organ without disruption. The contractility was monitored simultaneously in all hearts. Alpha-1-adrenoceptor stimulation gave an alkalinization by 0.02 +/- 0.01 pH-units (mean +/- S.E.M.) after 5 min and by 0.03 +/- 0.01 pH-units (mean +/- S.E.M.) after 15 min. Thus, an intracellular alkalinization after myocardial alpha-1-adrenoceptor stimulation was observed during close to physiological conditions. The elevation of pHi may contribute to maintain the inotropic effect after alpha-1-adrenoceptor stimulation.", 
    "80": "The inhibitory hemodynamic effects of the Bezold-Jarisch reflex in the adult animal, which play a role in the response to disease states, are elicited by veratridine and are mediated by vagal afferents. We tested whether the reported excitatory response to veratridine in the fetal animal may be caused by a maturational phase in the Bezold-Jarisch response. The effects of proprananol and atropine on the hemodynamic response to veratridine were examined at 124-141 d (mean, 133 d) of gestation in 11 fetal lambs instrumented long-term (instrumentation, 111-129 d of gestation). Seven lambs had intact vagal nerves, and four had bilateral cervical vagotomies. Veratridine injected into the superior vena cava (0.3 to 2.8 micrograms/kg) and the left atrium (0.2 to 0.8 microgram/kg) increased heart rate, arterial pressure, and left ventricular output, with the responses to left atrial injections occurring more rapidly. Propranolol markedly inhibited the increase in arterial pressure; atropine had no effect. Neither carbocaine, perfused around the cervical vagi, nor bilateral transection of the vagal nerves altered the hemodynamic excitatory response to veratridine. These findings demonstrate that the fetal excitatory response to veratridine is not mediated by vagal afferents, indicating the Bezold-Jarisch reflex does not undergo a maturational change from an excitatory reflex to an inhibitory one and suggesting the maturational loss of a sympathetically mediated hemodynamic reflex.", 
    "81": "Neuropeptide Y (NPY) has been recently characterised as a circulating vasoconstrictor peptide which is co-stored with noradrenaline (NA) in sympathetic neurons. We measured NPY by radioimmunoassay and NA by HPLC in plasma of ten healthy volunteers (23-27 years of age) during bicycle ergometry and found a rapid increase of both NPY and NA during exercise. NPY rose from 1.3 +/- 0.5 to 9.6 +/- 7.8 pmol/l and NA from 1.3 +/- 0.3 to 10.8 +/- 5.6 mnol/l (mean +/- SD). Following maximal exercise NA disappeared more rapidly from plasma than NPY. Compared with these healthy volunteers, plasma NPY was found to be elevated in 23 children and adolescents aged 9-18 years with borderline primary hypertension (NPY 3.1 +/- 1.7 pmol/l, P < 0.01). Basal NPY was also elevated when compared with 21 age-matched pediatric controls (P < 0.05). The bicycle ergometry protocol performed in 23 patients separated ten adolescents with normal basal and exercise blood pressure from 13 with high BP also during ergometry. In the latter group, NPY rose to 11.9 +/- 7.3 pmol/l and NA to 12.3 +/- 8.6 nmol/l during exercise. Treatment of the hypertensive patients with the beta-adrenergic blocker atenolol (50 mg per day) lowered basal and exercise BP. Heart rate fell during atenolol treatment from 92 +/- 19 to 72 +/- 15 beats/min.

    "82": "The contribution of the intestine to the nonlinear absorption of celiprolol in the rat was studied. After intravenous administration of 14C-celiprolol to bile duct-cannulated rats, approximately 9% of the dose was found to be associated with intestinal tissue and its contents. Microhistoautoradiography of frozen intestinal sections showed a time-dependent secretion of celiprolol from the blood into the lumen of the rat intestine. Propranolol, a lipophilic beta-blocker, was also found to be secreted into the intestine in vivo and transported in epithelial cells in both a temperature- and a pH-dependent manner, although to a lesser extent than celiprolol. Consistent with the observations in rats, transport of celiprolol from the basal-lateral to the apical side was found to dominate apical-to-basal transport using human Caco-2 cell monolayers. Additionally, using isolated rat small intestinal epithelial cells, celiprolol was found also to have a time- and temperature-dependent uptake, suggesting the involvement of a carrier-mediated system in its uptake. The uptake was inhibited by 2 mM celiprolol and propranolol and was also found to be pH dependent. Saturation of the carrier-mediated secretion of celiprolol in the intestine may result in enhanced absorption of celiprolol at high doses and account for its observed nonlinear absorption.", 
    "83": "Recovery from viral myocarditis is usually excellent and complete although it occasionally results in sudden death during its acute stage. While neurohormonal mechanisms play an important role in the adaptation to heart diseases, little is known about the alteration of the neurohormonal system in viral myocarditis. Therefore, we examined the myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor and cardiac angiotensin I and II concentrations in a murine model of viral myocarditis induced by an encephalomyocarditis virus. The down-regulation of the beta 1-adrenergic receptor subtype was observed on day 10. The heart weight, heart weight/body weight ratio and myocardial necrosis were significantly increased at this stage. On day 30, the beta 2-adrenergic receptor subtype was up-regulated without up-regulation of the total beta-adrenergic receptor. Both angiotensin I and II concentrations were significantly increased with myocardial hypertrophy in the left ventricle on day 30. The up-regulation of the total beta-adrenergic receptor and beta 2-subtype was observed on day 120, but neither the angiotensin I nor II concentration was increased. Therefore, the up-regulation of the beta 2-adrenergic receptor density and the temporal increase of the angiotensin I and II concentrations in the murine ventricle during viral myocarditis may play an important role in the pathophysiology of post-viral myocarditis.", 
    "84": "The purpose of the study was to compare the effect of transmural field stimulation (TMS) on isolated smooth muscle strips from rabbit sphincter of Oddi (SO), duodenal circular layer (Dc) and duodenal longitudinal layer (D1). The strips were suspended in thermostatically controlled 5-ml organ baths containing Krebs solution constantly bubbled with 5% CO2 in O2. TMS was delivered through platinum electrodes (140 V, 0.4 ms, 5 s trains, 40 Hz). The TMS responses could be divided in two main responses: (1) contraction initiated after cessation of the stimulus train, preceded by an inhibitory phase during TMS ('off'); and (2) contraction initiated during TMS ('duration'). The 'duration' response was observed in one out of 20 strips in the SO and Dc compartments, whereas 11 D1 strips (55%) showed 'duration' responses (P < 0.001). Atropine (10(-6)) converted all 'duration' responses to an 'off' response preceded by an inhibitory phase during TMS and reduced the contractile amplitudes with 40-65%. L-NNA significantly increased the number of 'duration' responses in all types of muscle, and caused a 40% increase in D1 contractile amplitude. Inhibitory responses could not be removed by atropine, propranolol and phentolamine. The results suggest that the intrinsic innervation of SO and duodenal muscle consists of a mixture of excitatory, cholinergic and inhibitory NANC pathways. The latter may utilize, wholly or partly, NO or a related compound as transmitter. A relative dominance of excitatory, cholinergic responses was present in the D1 strips, whereas inhibitory responses were dominating in the SO and Dc strips.", 
    "85": "Multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT) is an uncommon but clinically important tachydysrhythmia that is usually seen in the setting of severe cardiopulmonary illness. Diagnostic criteria include the presence of at least three different, nonsinus P waves in the same lead; an atrial rate greater than 100 beats per minute; and an isoelectric baseline between P waves. MAT is often difficult to differentiate from atrial fibrillation. The pathogenesis of MAT is unknown; however, it is probably incited by \"triggered\" electrical activity, a form of abnormal automaticity. This electrophysiologic model has led to several small, uncontrolled clinical trials using calcium channel and beta-adrenergic blocking agents, specifically verapamil and metropolol. None of these trials meets rigorous methodologic standards, and all exclude unstable patients who are at greatest risk for hemodynamic compromise from the tachycardia. Treatment of MAT should first be directed at potential predisposing factors, such as hypoxia, congestive heart failure, and theophylline toxicity. Pharmacologic treatment includes intravenous metoprolol or verapamil; in published reports both agents have been well tolerated and have controlled the heart rate in a majority of patients.", 
    "86": "1. We assessed the effects of changing levels of sympathetic drive on the gain of baroreflex control of the sino-atrial node, in normotensive and hypertensive subjects. 2. Autoregressive spectral and cross-spectral analysis of R-R interval and systolic arterial pressure (non-invasive Finapres method) variabilities providing an estimate of baroreflex gain through the frequency domain index alpha were performed on data from 63 normotensive and 78 mild hypertensive subjects. Subjects were studied at rest and during active orthostatism, which induces sympathetic predominance. Seven control subjects and 14 hypertensive subjects were also studied after chronic atenolol treatment, to attenuate beta-adrenoceptor-mediated responses. 3. In both normotensive and hypertensive subjects, the index alpha was reduced by active standing and increased by chronic beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Furthermore, at rest, the index alpha was correlated with R-R variance and appeared significantly reduced with age. The age-related negative correlation of the index alpha was no longer evident during the standing-induced increase in sympathetic drive, in both normotensive and hypertensive subjects. 4. The index alpha, a non-invasive frequency domain estimate of the overall gain of baroreflex control of the sino-atrial node, which appears to be reduced in essential hypertension, is negatively modulated by physiological increases in sympathetic drive, and augmented by pharmacological blockade of beta-adrenoceptors. 5. In essential hypertension the enhanced sympathetic drive present already at rest, and the simultaneous reduction of the gain of baroreflex mechanisms, are the expression of a complex alteration in neural cardiovascular control.", 
    "87": "1. The physiological effects of the acute administration of a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy were assessed by performing post-exercise Doppler-echocardiography study. Eleven patients and six control subjects were studied. According to a double-blind randomized protocol, 5 mg of metoprolol or placebo was administered before cycloergometer exercise. 2. In patients, after metoprolol, a significant decrease in heart rate and systolic blood pressure, as well as in peak aortic acceleration and cardiac output, was observed 2 min after exercise. Left ventricular end-diastolic diameter did not change from baseline values either after placebo or metoprolol. In normal subjects, as compared with placebo, a decrease in heart rate and peak aortic acceleration was observed after metoprolol, whereas systolic blood pressure did not change. A similar increase in cardiac output occurred after metoprolol, as compared with placebo, associated with an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and stroke volume. 3. Post-exercise Doppler echocardiography is a means of assessing haemodynamic changes occurring during exercise in patients with congestive heart failure. Although acute metoprolol administration does not provide beneficial haemodynamic effects, a decrease in the energy requirements of the heart and a faster recovery after exercise may participate in the long-term beneficial action of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists.",

Bolus injection of 5 micrograms CRF, dissolved in 100 microliters perfusion buffer, provoked a significant (p < 0.01 vs. control) short-time increase of ANP release. Indomethacin (3 x 10(-5) mol/l) inhibited the CRF-stimulated increase of ANP release and decreased the basal ANP secretion (p < 0.01 vs. CRF group).

In the third, the movement consisted of rhythmic contractions of the arms and legs that were triggered by aspartame. The first patient agreed to participate in a study in which she drank 250 ml of skim milk, an amount sufficient to trigger head shaking, after pretreatment with drugs known to alter neurotransmission across beta-adrenergic, dopaminergic, GABAergic or purinergic synapses. At the doses used, propranolol and diazepam had no effect on the milk evoked movement disorder. Levodopa (plus carbidopa) blocked the reaction to milk. Haloperidol, salbutamol and theophylline by themselves triggered a reaction similar to that evoked by milk.

Randomization to placebo or to long-acting nisoldipine core coat (20 mg once daily) was performed in 135 eligible patients with mild to moderate systolic LV dysfunction (LV ejection fraction < or = 50%) 20 days (range 7-35) after infarction, with serial clinical, echocardiographic, and Doppler cardiographic measurements during a 4 week follow-up period. At the end of the follow-up period, exercise capacity was determined by bicycle ergometry. Nisoldipine improved indices of diastolic LV function. Early diastolic transmitral blood flow velocity increased, with an increase in peak E wave of 0.06 m/sec (95% confidence intervals [CI], 0.01, 0.11) and an increase in time velocity integral of 1.2 cm (95% CI, 0.16, 2.27). Isovolumic relaxation time was reduced by 14.7 msec (95% CI, -22.5, -6.9), a change not explained by the very small (and not significant) changes in systemic arterial pressure, heart rate, or cardiac output. There was no change in systolic and diastolic LV volume, nor in LV ejection fraction. Exercise capacity was greater by 12 watts (95% CI, 0.8, 23.3) in patients receiving nisoldipine, while the incidence of > or = 1 mm ST-segment depression (relative occurrence 0.54, 95% CI, 0.30-0.97) and the incidence of angina pectoris (relative occurrence 0.67, 95% CI, 0.42-1.08) during exercise testing tended to be lower in this group. Although the relations were not exact, peak exercise workload 7 weeks after infarction correlated with resting measurements of diastolic LV function. Exercise workload was inversely related to peak late diastolic transmitral blood flow velocity (A wave, slope, -86.6; 95% CI, -120.9, -52.2) and directly to the E/A ratio (slope, 20.5, 95% CI, 6.0, 35.1). The relations between exercise workload and peak late diastolic flow velocity remained significant after correction for age, sex, resting heart rate, and usage of beta-blocking drugs or nisoldipine. Exercise capacity was not related to measurements of systolic LV function (LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volume, LV ejection fraction, stroke volume, cardiac index). In summary, the calcium channel blocker nisoldipine improved measurements of diastolic LV function in patients recovering from acute myocardial infarction.

In fact, two different patterns of contractile dysfunction, possibly coexisting, have been shown after acute myocardial infarction: Stunning and hibernation represent distinct patterns of contractile dysfunction that share the character of reversibility. It is noteworthy, then, to identify the presence of these two conditions at the bedside and to develop medical treatment to effect recovery of myocardial dysfunction. This strategy has the potential to ameliorate the outcome of patients after acute myocardial infarction by improving left ventricular function. Beta-blocker therapy significantly reduces mortality and the incidence of reinfarction after an acute myocardial infarction: These benefits result from the prevention of sudden death, the reduction of the extent of myocardial injury during the acute phase, and a further antiischemic action. Nevertheless, beta-blocker therapy increases left ventricular dilatation. Recent experimental and clinical data show that ACE inhibitors confer positive therapeutic effects after myocardial infarction by reducing the extent of left ventricular dilation, by reducing mortality, and by improving the clinical outcome. Not all patients, however, can be subjected to this therapeutical approach because of the possible detrimental effects produced by hypotension and by block of neurohormonal activation, sometimes truly compensatory in the early phase. Therefore, it would be interesting to suggest a combination therapy of a beta-blocker with a vasodilator agent (ACE inhibitor or calcium-channel blocker.", 
    "110": "The influence of hepatic lipase (HL) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity on the low density lipoprotein (LDL) subclass pattern was studied in a population of males with coronary heart disease and without severe hypercholesterolemia. LDL subclass patterns, lipases and plasma lipoproteins were determined in 326 patients. In part of the study population, fasting insulin and glucose levels were also determined. The LDL subclass pattern was determined by gradient gel electrophoresis (GGE) and classified according to Austin et al. (J. Am. Med. Assoc. 260 (1988) 1917 (predominantly large LDL = A-pattern, predominantly small LDL = B-pattern). An LDL subclass A-pattern was exhibited by 199 subjects; 108 exhibited a B-pattern. In 19 subjects no distinctive A- or B-pattern was present (A/B-pattern). Hepatic and lipoprotein activities differed significantly between patients with the A- or B-pattern. The median hepatic lipase activity was lower (384 vs. 417 mU/ml, P = 0.006), and the lipoprotein lipase activity higher (122 vs. 101 mU/ml, P = 0.001) in the A-pattern subjects than in the B-pattern subjects. In subjects with the A/B pattern the lipase activities were intermediate between the values in the A- and B-pattern subjects (HL 408 +/- 87 mU/ml, LPL 115 +/- 55 mU/ml). Plasma triglyceride, very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-triglyceride, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL)-triglyceride and LDL-triglyceride were higher in the patients with a B-pattern (+84%, +171%, +10% and +16%, respectively). Total plasma cholesterol was not different between A- and B-pattern subjects. VLDL- and IDL-cholesterol were higher in the B-pattern group (+174% and +66%, respectively), while LDL- and HDL-cholesterol were higher in the A-pattern group (+2 and +24%, respectively). In univariate analysis HL, LPL, plasma (and VLDL) triglyceride, HDL-cholesterol and IDL-cholesterol were each significantly associated with the LDL subclass pattern. In multivariate analysis plasma triglyceride (or VLDL-triglyceride) and HDL-cholesterol appeared to be independently associated with the LDL subclass pattern. No additional discriminative value of HL or LPL was found. Similar results were obtained if the patients with or without beta blocker were evaluated separately. An estimate of insulin resistance (EIR), calculated from plasma insulin and glucose in part of the study population (n = 145), was significantly higher in the subjects with a B-pattern than in those with an A-pattern (3.12 vs. 2.00, P < 0.003). EIR correlated positively with plasma triglyceride (P < 0.0001), but not with HL or LPL.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "111": "Pharmacogenous shifts in EEG spectral density induced by mutually antagonistic noradrenotropic influences (pairs sydnocarb-obsidan and sydnocarb-sonapax) were compared in each of four subjects by means of factor and discriminant analysis. Narrow-band oppositely directed reactions were revealed almost in all classical EEG diapasons in a range of 0.5-30 Hz. Incidence of such reactions, their expression and generalization made it possible to recognize the states, induced by each of the drugs, and EEG reactions to placebo in every subject with high significance. The most pronounced oppositely directed shifts were observed in the band of approximately 20-24 Hz. They were revealed in all the subjects and had an accent of expression in parietal-central areas. Sydnocarb increased the spectral density in this band, obsidan and sonapax decreased it. The obtained data point to the possibility of application of EEG density change in the band of 20-24 Hz over the right parietal area as an EEG marker of the level of activation of noradrenergic neurotransmitter system.", 
    "112": "Ocular blood flow, in particular to the optic nerve head, is considered important in determining the extent of glaucomatous damage. The 24-hour variation in the pulsatile component of ocular blood flow (POBF) was measured using a pneumotonometer linked to the Langham Ocular Blood Flow System. Intraocular pressure (IOP), ocular pulse amplitude, POBF, systemic blood pressure and heart rate were recorded at three-hourly intervals over a 24-hour period in 10 ocular hypertensives, eight patients with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) treated with timolol eyedrops (G timolol 0.25%), and eight ocular normotensive control subjects. The POAG subjects were readmitted for a second set of 24-hour measurements after temporarily discontinuing G timolol for two weeks. The POBF showed no significant diurnal variation in any of the patient groups, the POAG values being taken from the \"off treatment\" period. By contrast, there were overnight falls in IOP, ocular pulse amplitude, blood pressure and heart rate, which reached significance in some groups. This suggests that overall there are compensatory changes in IOP, blood pressure, heart rate, and perhaps ocular vascular resistance, to preserve POBF overnight. Within all groups there was much individual variation, with some subjects showing an overnight fall in POBF, suggesting a lack of autoregulation in these cases who might prove to be at greater risk of developing nocturnal glaucomatous damage. When timolol was withdrawn from POAG subjects, there was no change in POBF despite an increase in IOP, implying that timolol, though effective as ocular hypotensive, did not alter POBF.", 
    "113": "In a prospective, randomized, double-masked study, 44 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma were treated either with 0.5% betaxolol or 0.5% timolol in both eyes twice daily. Twenty-nine patients could be followed up for 48 months. Seventeen of these patients were treated with betaxolol and 12 with timolol. Each examination included visual field measurements with an Octopus automated perimeter 201 (Program G1), intraocular pressure measurement, funduscopy, as well as pulse and arterial blood pressure measurements. Both drugs lowered in the intraocular pressure. This reduction was slightly but not statistically significantly higher in the timolol-treated group. However, the visual fields improved more in the betaxolol group. Patients treated with betaxolol had significantly smaller averaged mean defects (p < 0.05) and higher averaged mean sensitivities (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon rank score text) than did timolol-treated patients at months 3, 6, 12, and 18. Thereafter, the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant in this relatively small sample size. For betaxolol patients the cumulative area-under-the-curve analysis for the worse eye yielded significantly larger mean sensitivities beyond month 12 (exception: month 30; p < 0.05) and significantly smaller mean defects beyond month 6 (p < 0.05).", 
    "114": "In a prospective, randomized study, nineteen patients with ocular hypertension (n = 14) or chronic open-angle glaucoma (n = 5) were treated with either betaxolol 0.5% or timolol 0.5% in both eyes twice daily. Visual field sensitivity and intraocular pressure were assessed with the Octopus perimeter (program G1) and applanation tonometry, respectively, at 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months during treatment. Four of the nineteen patients (two timolol-treated and two betaxolol-treated) were lost to follow-up after the 36-month examination. Whereas both drugs reduced the intraocular pressure, the decrease in the timolol-treated group was statistically more pronounced than in the betaxolol-treated group at month 3, 6, and 48 (p < 0.03). In both treatment groups, the visual field mean sensitivity (MS) index decreased slightly during the first six months of treatment, but remained so only in the timolol-treated group at all subsequent examinations. In the betaxolol-treated group, there was a statistically significant increase in MS at the 12, 24, 36, and 48 month visits (p < 0.01). These findings suggest that factors other than IOP alone may determine visual field outcome.", 
    "115": "The vascular relaxing properties of three beta adrenoceptor antagonists, betaxolol, carteolol and timolol, currently used in the treatment of glaucoma, were characterized, compared and contrasted in the porcine long posterior ciliary artery. Isolated arterial ring segments precontracted with increased extracellular KCl (plus 40 mM) or the thromboxane analog, U-46619 (3 x 10(-7) M), were relaxed in a concentration-dependent fashion by betaxolol, carteolol, timolol or nitroprusside. In vessel segments depolarized with increased extracellular KCl, EC50 values indicated that the intrinsic relaxant sensitivity to betaxolol was equal to that of nitroprusside, six-fold greater than that of carteolol, and ten-fold greater than that of timolol. Similarly, the maximum relaxation occurring at equimolar concentrations (10(-4) M) for the beta adrenoceptor antagonists was betaxolol > carteolol = timolol. Qualitatively similar results were noted in ring segments of the rabbit external iliac artery precontracted with increased extracellular KCl (plus 30 mM). Under conditions in which specific receptor-linked events are absent and voltage-gated Ca++ entry is maximized, the Ca++ concentration response relationship in porcine long posterior ciliary artery was shifted to the right in an apparent competitive manner by betaxolol, reflecting a 5.6-fold reduction in the sensitivity to Ca++. Conversely, nitroprusside reduced the Ca++ sensitivity three-fold in a noncompetitive fashion; not only shifting the Ca++ concentration response relationship to the right, but also depressing the maximum by 57%. Porcine long posterior ciliary arterial segments precontracted to a similar degree with U-46619, in which voltage-gated Ca++ entry is only one component of many specific cell signalling transduction mechanisms contributing to the precontraction, exhibited a sensitivity to betaxolol that was six-fold less than to nitroprusside, but two-fold greater than to timolol and 20-fold greater than to carteolol. These results are consistent with an obvious direct vascular relaxing capacity for beta adrenoceptor antagonists that primarily represents a capacity for inhibiting voltage-gated Ca++ entry in vascular smooth muscle. Additionally, the differential potencies of these three beta adrenoceptor antagonists characterized in this study suggests that this property is much more likely to contribute to any potentially beneficial effects of betaxolol than carteolol or timolol.", 
    "116": "In the past several years the effect of longterm glaucoma therapy on ocular hemodynamics has taken on increased interest. This interest has been sparked by studies demonstrating differential effects of various beta-blockers on visual function, and the possible contributory role of ocular blood flow. In the present study, the pulsatile ocular blood flow (POBF), as derived by the Langham OBF system, was measured prior to treatment and then tracked throughout a one-year period of beta-blocker therapy (betaxolol 0.5% or timolol 0.5%) in 25 glaucoma patients. Results of the two treatments were compared, and indicated that, whereas both betaxolol- and timolol-treated patients had similar significant reductions in the IOP, the effect of the two treatments on the POBF differed. In timolol-treated patients, the POBF decreased significantly over the 12-month observation period, whereas in betaxolol-treated patients it remained stable.", 
    "117": "The effects of 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT were compared with those of the mixed beta-adrenoceptor and 5-HT1A receptor antagonist (-)pindolol, and the selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist betaxolol in rats implanted for chronic sleep recordings, 8-OH-DPAT (0.375 mg/kg) significantly increased wakefulness and decreased slow wave sleep (SWS) and REM sleep (REMS). At 2.0-4.0 mg/kg (-)pindolol reduced REMS. Betaxolol in doses of 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg did not significantly modify sleep variables. Pretreatment with (-)pindolol (2.0-4.0 mg/kg) reversed the effect of 8-OH-DPAT on waking and SWS, while (+)pindolol (4.0 mg/kg) and betaxolol (2.0 mg/kg) were ineffective in this respect. The stereoselective antagonism by the pindolol enantiomers supports the proposal that 8-OH-DPAT-induced increase of waking and decrease of SWS depends on the activation of 5-HT1A receptors. The absence of antagonism by betaxolol tends to indicate that prevention by (-)pindolol of waking increase did not involve beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "118": "Spontaneous motor activity, rotarod test and observational rating of sedation were employed to study effect of nifedipine on sedation produced by reserpine, clonidine and propranolol. Reserpine (2 mg kg-1), clonidine (4 mg kg-1), and propranolol (40 mg kg-1) significantly reduced spontaneous motor activity and staying capacity of animals on accelerating rotarod (P < 0.01). Observational sedation was also caused significantly as indicated by a higher score in test. Nifedipine (2 mg kg-1) produced no sedation or excitation on its own. Reduction in spontaneous motor activity produced by reserpine and clonidine was partially reversed in animals treated with nifedipine (P < 0.01). A similar effect of nifedipine was also evident on the observational sedation induced by reserpine and clonidine. Effect of these drugs on rotarod times was nearly totally antagonised by nifedipine. Nifedipine did not oppose the sedation produced by propranolol which actually became significantly greater in the animals pretreated with nifedipine in all three tests. It is concluded that nifedipine antagonizes the sedation produced by reserpine and clonidine, probably by blocking central alpha 2-adrenoceptors. The sedative effect of propranolol can be potentiated by nifedipine possibly because of a pharmacokinetic interaction.", 
    "119": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether patients whose blood pressure failed to normalize while receiving monotherapy with atenolol would experience further blood pressure lowering by adding the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor benazepril hydrochloride to their treatment regimen. Seventy-four of the original 127 patients treated with atenolol met the criteria for entry into the 4-week, double-blind phase of the study, in which either benazepril 10 mg twice daily (increased after 1 week, if necessary, to 20 mg twice daily) or placebo was added to atenolol. At end point, 46% of the benazepril group had achieved an excellent or good response (ie, diastolic blood pressure [DBP] < 90 mm Hg or a decrease of > or = 10 mm Hg below the baseline) compared with 14% of the placebo group (P < 0.01). The mean fall in DBP at end point was -5.6 mm Hg in the benazepril group and -3.7 mm Hg in the placebo group. Because six patients in the benazepril group experienced an increase of blood pressure that offset the fall observed in the responders, the difference in DBP response between the benazepril group and the placebo group was not statistically significant. We conclude that adding benazepril to the regimen of patients whose blood pressure is inadequately controlled while receiving atenolol monotherapy can produce an additional decrease in blood pressure in almost half the patients.", 
    "120": "The treatment of cardiac arrhythmias has changed over the past several years, as concerns have grown about proarrhythmias and increased mortality associated with certain antiarrhythmic agents. Sotalol, a unique racemic compound with both Class II (beta-blocking) and Class III (repolarization-prolonging) properties, effectively controls life-threatening arrhythmias and has a favorable safety profile, especially when compared with traditional antiarrhythmic drugs. A review of clinical trials demonstrates that sotalol is an effective treatment for premature ventricular complexes, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. Moreover, it significantly reduces cardiac and all-cause mortality in these patient populations. Although sotalol currently is approved in the United States only for the treatment of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, it also is active against several supraventricular arrhythmias. Sotalol is safe and generally well tolerated; most of the adverse effects experienced with its use are related to its beta-blocking activity. However, sotalol has been associated with life-threatening proarrhythmias, including torsades de pointes, but the incidence of this adverse effect is low. Unlike pure Class II agents, sotalol usually is well tolerated in patients with mild-to-moderate left ventricular dysfunction and rarely causes new or worsening congestive heart failure. Sotalol represents an advance in the treatment and prevention of symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias and appears to be a reasonable first-line choice when the arrhythmia is life threatening.", 
    "121": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response is a common tachyarrhythmia requiring hospitalization. The increased morbidity and mortality due to the hemodynamic consequences of acute AF is well recognized. Management strategies may be formed based on the evaluation of the entire clinical context including cardiovascular status and the associated noncardiac clinical disorders. Intravenous (i.v.) beta blockers and calcium channel blockers are equally effective in rapidly controlling the ventricular rate in acute AF in selected individuals. The addition of digoxin to the regimen causes a favorable outcome. However, digoxin as a single agent is generally inefficacious in slowing the ventricular rate in acute AF. These standard pharmacotherapies however, are contraindicated in ventricular preexcitation syndrome associated with rapid ventricular rate due to AF. In this situation the drug of choice is i.v. procainamide. When clinical condition is unstable or hemodynamically compromised, cardioversion is the treatment of choice in all cases of AF with rapid ventricular rate. Radiofrequency ablation of the AV node or anomalous tract may be considered in refractory or high risk subjects as a last resort.", 
    "122": "We investigated the profiles of sudden death and hemoconcentration induced by endothelin-1 (ET-1) and big endothelin-1 (big ET-1) in mice using various compounds as pharmacological tools. In ET-1-induced sudden death (5 nmol/kg, i.v.), pretreatment with the Ca(2+)-channel blockers, diltiazem, nifedipine or verapamil at a dose of 2 mg/kg, i.v. significantly inhibited the mortality and prolonged the latency to death. These Ca(2+)-channel blockers, however, failed to inhibit the rise in hematocrit (Ht), namely hemoconcentration, induced by ET-1 (2.5 nmol/kg). A beta-adrenoceptor agonist, isoproterenol (1 mg/kg) tended to prolong the latency, whereas, a beta-adrenoceptor blocker, propranolol (2 mg/kg), and an alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blocker, labetalol (5 mg/kg), aggravated the sudden death. Esculetin (10 mg/kg) and fenbufen (10 mg/kg), which are enzyme inhibitors in the arachidonate cascade, prevented only the hemoconcentration. Anti-arrhythmic drugs, lidocaine (1 mg/kg) and disopyramide (20 mg/kg) did not improve any parameters. Big ET-1 also caused sudden death (20 and 25 nmol/kg, i.v.) and hemoconcentration (10 nmol/kg, i.v.). Of several proteinase inhibitors, only a metalloproteinase inhibitor, phosphoramidon (2 mg/kg i.v.), prevented the sudden death and the hemoconcentration induced by big ET-1 but not by ET-1. Ca(2+)-channel blockers exerted their protective effects only when a lower dose of big ET-1 was employed. These results indicate that the sudden death caused by both peptide is mainly due to myocardial ischemia and respiratory disorder, and that hemoconcentration caused by them is due to their vasoconstrictor action but to their effects on the vascular permeability via secondary endogenous factors.", 
    "123": "Studying a patient with Cushing's disease by 24-hour indirect blood pressure monitoring, we confirmed that the normal nocturnal fall in blood pressure was absent, although the usual decrease in heart rate persisted. Thereafter we found a hypervariability in blood pressure and heart rate, which was reversed by treatment with betablockers and/or cyproheptadine. The therapy restored also the normal nocturnal fall in blood pressure. The low-dose cyproheptadine therapy normalized urinary free cortisol levels and restored a 24-hour blood pressure profile better than the low-dose beta-blocker therapy.", 
    "124": "Chromatographic retention parameters of a series of 7 beta-adrenolytics and of 12 antihistamine drugs were determined employing an alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) column. For the group of antihistamines capillary electrophoretic (CE) retention was additionally measured in the presence of either AGP or human serum albumin (HSA). Two series of solutes hydrophobicity parameters were obtained by reversed-phase HPLC on an immobilized artificial membrane (IAM) column. The solutes studied were subjected to molecular modelling and the structural descriptors obtained were applied in studies of quantitative structure-retention (protein binding) relationships (QSRR). It was found that retention on AGP correlates well with the literature on physiological protein binding data. This retention was demonstrated to depend on hydrophobicity: to a lesser extent in the case of beta-adrenolytics and strongly in the case of antihistamines. Hydrophobicity, along with molecular width and electron excess charge on aliphatic nitrogen was demonstrated to describe retention of antihistamines on AGP. The AGP column is recommended as a convenient reactor for studies of drug-protein interactions. Preliminary CE data do not correlate with the HPLC data.", 
    "125": "Neurotransmitters which increase intracellular cAMP levels can cause cultured astroglia to change from a flat, polygonal shape to a stellate morphology. Little is known about how glial stellation can be regulated by other transmitters. In the present study, we demonstrated that L-glutamate blocked isoproterenol (ISO) or dibutyryl-cAMP induced stellation in astroglia. The glutamate inhibition was concentration dependent, with its maximal effect on > 90% of cells at 500 microM. Glutamate also reversed glial stellation within a short period (< 30 min). Glutamate uptake analogues, D-glutamate and D-aspartate, rather than receptor agonists, kainate and quisqualate, mimicked the glutamate effect. Likewise, the glutamate uptake blocker, D-thero-beta-hydroxyaspartate, blocked the glutamate effect. The glutamate inhibition was not a result of inhibition of cAMP formation, since norepinephrine, which inhibited 80% of ISO-stimulated cAMP, also caused glial stellation. Increases in extracellular K+ to 50 mM also reduced glial stellation, whereas 25 mM K+ had little effect. Since 25 mM K+ caused much greater depolarization than 400 microM glutamate, it was unlikely that the effects of both glutamate and high [K+] on glial stellation were due to membrane depolarization. Hypotonic treatment (120 mOsm) enhanced, whereas hypertonic treatment (520 mOsm) prevented, the glutamate reversal of glial stellation. Thus, glial swelling appeared to be a primary mechanism for the inhibitory effect of glutamate and high [K+] on glial stellation. This mechanism could also explain the observation that glutamate inhibited stellation induced by PMA, a PKC activator. Our data suggest that glutamate released from neurons during neuronal activity or pathology can be taken up by astrocytes and alter their morphology. Changes in glial morphology may in turn affect the volume and composition of the extracellular space and, as a result, neuronal activity.", 
    "126": "Beta-adrenoceptors on lymphocytes are acutely increased after dynamic exercise in normotensive subjects, but not in hypertensives. It was thus of interest to evaluate the acute regulation of the lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptor-adenylate-cyclase-cAMP-system (BAAS) in patients with primary hypertension during dynamic stress after acute beta-blockade. Density and affinity of beta 2-adrenoceptors, and intracellular cAMP concentrations (baseline and isoprenaline stimulated values) were measured on the peripheral mononuclear cells in 8 male patients with primary hypertension before and immediately after dynamic exercise on a bicycle (50-200 W) at baseline and after acute beta-blockade (2 h following 100 mg atenolol). Dynamic exercise causes no significant changes in receptor density and affinity, nor in basal cAMP values. After acute beta-blockade the dynamic stress-induced rise in mean arterial blood pressure was significantly (p < 0.01) reduced from 33 to 24 mmHg, and beta-adrenoceptor density significantly (p < 0.05) increased from 1320 to 2102 molecules/cell, whereas affinity remained unchanged. Baseline and stimulated cAMP concentrations increased significantly (p < 0.05) from 5.3 to 7.0 and from 2.1 to 3.5 pmol/10(6) cells, respectively. These findings suggest that in primary hypertension the regulation of the beta 2-adrenoceptor-adenylate-cyclase-cAMP-system is impaired on exercise and can be normalised by acute beta-blockade. Since atenolol predominantly blocks beta 1-adrenoceptors, the observed normalisation of the lymphocyte BAAS may reflect only an unspecific effect of antihypertensive therapy per se.",

Trials examining the impact of antihypertensive pharmacotherapy, primarily with diuretics and beta-blockers, have shown them to decrease the incidence of stroke by 33-50 percent.

Examination of numerous clinical trials assessing the impact of the various antihypertensive therapies on cardiovascular risk factors, including blood pressure, plasma lipids, diabetic control/insulin sensitivity, and left ventricular hypertrophy was done. The classes included beta-blockers, diuretics, alpha-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and CCBs; the results show a diversity of effect.

Age is not a contra-indication, but the physician has to be familiar with the drugs used in the elderly (side-effects, contra-indications, metabolism, dosages, etc.). The choice based on side-effects and contra-indications favours calcium inhibitors and nitrates. Nevertheless, beta-blocking agents give good results in the elderly, if care is taken to use them correctly. Aspirin is given at reduced dosage. Sublingual nitrates are necessary for the anginal crisis or before stress (prophylaxis). Compliance and safety are favoured by a rational therapy.",

SB 207710 caused concentration-dependent (0.1-10 nmol/l) surmountable antagonism of the effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine with a pKB (mol/l) of 10.1. Due to its high selectivity and affinity, SB 207710 could be a powerful tool for the comparison of human atrial 5-HT4 receptors with 5-HT4 receptors of other organs of man and other species.", 
    "133": "This study examined the changes of beta-adrenoceptors in the guinea-pig sinoatrial nodal region following 7 day (-)-isoprenaline (400 micrograms/kg/h s.c.) infusion and the relationship between beta-adrenoceptor desensitization and receptor down-regulation. Changes in beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor density were measured using quantitative autoradiography and function in organ bath studies. (-)-Isoprenaline treatment produced a marked decrease in total (from 57.5 to 33.9 fmol/mg protein), beta 1- (from 49.4 to 32.8 fmol/mg protein), and beta 2-adrenoceptor density (from 8.1 to 1.05 fmol/mg protein) in the sinoatrial node. In adjacent right atrium, treatment produced no change in total (39.5 and 36.7 fmol/mg protein) or beta 1-adrenoceptors (35.9 and 36.4 fmol/mg protein) but did decrease beta 2-adrenoceptors (from 3.7 to 0.3 fmol/mg protein). Chronotropic effects were measured in spontaneously beating right atrium. Procaterol, a selective beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, caused a biphasic chronotropic response in control right atria, the first part of which was abolished in the tissue from treated animals. The maximum increase in right atrial rate to RO363, a beta 1-adrenoceptor selective partial agonist, was reduced from 114 bpm in control to 43 bpm in treated animals. In electrically driven right atrium with the sinoatrial node removed procaterol failed to produce a positive inotropic response via beta 2-adrenoceptors, but the maximum response to RO363 was reduced from 0.75 g in the control tissue to 0.12 g in the treated tissue. This study showed that changes in beta 2-adrenoceptor density following 7 day (-)-isoprenaline infusion are compatible with reduced functional responsiveness in the SA node. The reduction of beta 1-adrenoceptor number in the SA node was also compatible with the reduced chronotropic response in this tissue. However the lack of effect on beta 1-adrenoceptor density in the right atrium was not consistent with the decrease in beta 1-adrenoceptor mediated inotropic response in this tissue. This suggests that beta-adrenoceptor desensitization is not always associated with receptor down-regulation but depends also on the changes in the cell signalling system beyond the level of the receptor which differ according to the cardiac location.", 
    "134": "Muscle glycogen depletion by means of exercise is associated with increased insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity. To determine whether reduction in muscle glycogen content independent of muscle contractions would increase glucose transport activity, rats were injected with epinephrine (20 micrograms/100 g body wt) or saline. Two hours later, epitrochlearis muscles were removed, washed thoroughly to remove epinephrine, and assayed for glucose transport activity with 3-O-methyl-D-glucose (3-MG). Muscle adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate concentration was elevated 441% in muscles frozen immediately after removal from epinephrine-injected rats but had returned to control levels by the time 3-MG transport was measured. Prior exposure to epinephrine resulted in depletion of muscle glycogen [from 18.6 +/- 1.4 to 11.0 +/- 0.1 (SE) mumol glucose units/g wet wt] and a small increase in basal glucose transport activity (from 0.13 +/- 0.02 to 0.24 +/- 0.04 mumol 3-MG.ml-1 x 10 min-1, P < 0.05). A submaximally effective insulin concentration (30 microU/ml) induced a 70% greater increase in 3-MG transport in epinephrine-treated muscles than in controls (0.57 +/- 0.09 and 0.34 +/- 0.04 mumol.ml-1 x 10 min-1, respectively, P < 0.001). Response to a maximally effective concentration of insulin was unaltered by prior exposure to epinephrine. When epinephrine-induced glycogen depletion was prevented by prior injection with the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, glucose transport activity was no longer enhanced by epinephrine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "135": "Carvedilol is an arylethanolamine that is a racemic mixture of 2 enantiomers. The S-(-)-enantiomer has beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity, while the racemate also has alpha 1-receptor blocking activity due to the activity of the R-(+)-enantiomer. The drug is rapidly absorbed and undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver. It reaches a peak concentration 1 to 2 hours postdose and has an elimination half-life of about 4 to 7 hours. Absorption is delayed by food. The drug is highly lipophilic and is highly protein bound. The drug is metabolised by the liver, with some metabolites having biological activity. The pharmacokinetic profile is not altered in the elderly or in patients with renal disease. However, bioavailability of the oral medication is greatly increased in patients with liver disease. Carvedilol lowers blood pressure as a result of its beta-blocking and vasodilatory activity. The reduction in blood pressure is similar to that achieved with other antihypertensive drugs, and there are no adverse effects on renal or cerebral blood flow. Carvedilol has been used in small numbers of patients with cardiac failure. It reduces left ventricular hypertrophy and has no significant adverse metabolic effects.", 
    "136": "The experiments on rabbits and the clinical studies of patients with primary open-angle glaucoma revealed that 1% and 2% solutions of the new beta-, alpha-adrenoceptor blocking drug proxodolol had a marked antihypertensive effect. Proxodolol reduced intraocular pressure, by decreasing the rate of aqueous humor inflow. The study of the effects of proxodolol versus timolol on intraocular pressure showed that their antihypertensive effects were identical.", 
    "137": "The effects of placebo and proxodolol, a new hybrid (beta-, alpha-) adrenoblocking agent, on exercise tolerance, hemodynamics and the conduction system were compared in 28 patients with coronary heart disease, Functional Class II-III exercise-induced angina pectoris at rest and during bicycle ergometric exercise test. Proxodolol was shown to exert a significant dose-dependent antianginal effect without producing any negative effect on atrioventricular and intraventricular conduction."
