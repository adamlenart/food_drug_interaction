    "0": "1. After intravenous injection of practolol the blood concentration-time curve is fitted by a bi-exponential function. A two compartment open system model is therefore a minimal requirement in order to describe adequately the distribution of the drug in the body.2. The parameters of the two compartment model for practolol were determined. The mean values for the ;fast disposition' half life and the ;slow disposition' half life were 0.5 min and 13.3 min, respectively.3. The rate constants of distribution and elimination were similar in different animals. The volume of the central compartment was related to the weight of the animal.4. The absorption of practolol from an intestinal site was measured by its appearance in the blood. The rate constant for this process was estimated to be 0.03 min(-1).", 
    "1": "1. In cats anaesthetized with pentobarbitone, intravenous infusions of phentolamine ((10-50 mug/kg)/min for 5 min) increased heart rate, left ventricular dp/dt max (without increasing end-diastolic pressure), aortic dp/dt, cardiac output, myocardial blood flow and metabolic heat production.2. Phentolamine-induced increases in myocardial contractility occurred irrespective of the direction or magnitude of the blood pressure change and were maintained well beyond the actual infusion period.3. In cats treated with alprenolol, bretylium or reserpine there was no evidence of increased cardiac contractility following phentolamine administration.4. It is concluded that phentolamine, in doses less than those required to produce significant alpha-adrenoceptor blockade, increased myocardial contractility through an effect on the sympathetic nervous system.", 
    "2": "1. The effects of nicotine on amylase secretion induced by auriculo-temporal nerve stimulation were studied.2. Nicotine caused a transient increase in secretion as well as flow rate of amylase.3. No difference in nicotine action was found between acute sympathetic decentralization of the gland and acute denervation.4. The increase in amylase secretion due to nicotine was not inhibited by phenoxybenzamine, bretylium and chronic denervation, but was prevented by hexamethonium, propranolol and adrenalectomy.5. The increase in flow rate due to nicotine was not inhibited by propranolol, chronic denervation and adrenalectomy, but was prevented by hexamethonium, phenoxybenzamine and bretylium.6. These results show that the action of nicotine in increasing amylase secretion is neither a direct action on the ganglion nor on the nerve terminal of the cervical sympathetic nerve, but is an indirect action of catecholamines released from the adrenal medulla on the post-junctional receptors.7. The study also suggests that the initial acceleration of salivary flow due to nicotine is characterized by a mechanism different from that of amylase secretion.", 
    "3": "1. Responses of muscle strips from the stomach of the guinea-pig have been recorded. Sympathomimetic amines cause inhibitory, motor or biphasic responses.2. The motor components of the responses of the preparations were greatly enhanced by the removal of the mucosal layers.3. The inhibitory responses to isoprenaline, noradrenaline and phenylephrine were antagonized by propranolol or by sotalol. The inhibitory responses to noradrenaline and phenylephrine but not isoprenaline were antagonized by phentolamine. Therefore, both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors may subserve inhibition.4. The motor responses to noradrenaline and phenylephrine were often potentiated by propranolol or sotalol and were antagonized by phentolamine. Therefore, motor responses to sympathomimetic amines appear to involve alpha-adrenoceptors.5. The responses to sympathomimetic amines and their antagonists were not modified by hyoscine or by tetrodotoxin. It is concluded that the adrenoceptors mediating the responses recorded from these preparations are located on the smooth muscle cells rather than on a nervous pathway.", 
    "4": "1. The extracellular fluid volume (ECFV), as raffinose space, and its content of Na, K and Ca were measured in anaesthetized dogs in acute experiments before and during the vascular response to intravenous injections and infusions of noradrenaline, adrenaline, isoprenaline and angiotensin.2. In male dogs the effect of noradrenaline was unpredictable, the ECFV might increase or decrease. In female dogs noradrenaline caused an increase in the ECFV. The difference between the responses of the two sexes was statistically significant (P<0.001). After phentolamine, noradrenaline exerted no effect at all in either sex. After bretylium the results were like those in normal animals.3. In both males and females adrenaline generally induced an increase in the ECFV. After phentolamine, adrenaline decreased the ECFV in males and caused little change in females. The differences before and after blockade were statistically significant (P<0.001). After bretylium the results in both sexes were like those in normal animals.4. In both male and female dogs isoprenaline induced an increase in the ECFV and the results were the same as in the normal animals after both phentolamine and bretylium.5. In male dogs there was no change in the ECFV as a result of administering angiotensin, either alone or in the presence of phentolamine or bretylium. In normal females angiotensin induced a decrease in ECFV and the difference between the responses of the males and females was statistically significant (P<0.005). In females which had received either phentolamine or bretylium the results were indistinguishable from those in the males.6. Blockade of the beta-adrenoceptors with pronethalol in a few animals did not change the response to the drugs from those seen in normal animals.7. The cation content of the ECF changed in the same direction and to about the same extent as the water, except after noradrenaline when in some experiments the proportionate change in potassium concentration was considerably greater than that of the other substances.8. The inulin space and its Na and K content were measured in several dioestrous, oestrous and pro-oestrous rats and in normal and stilboestrol treated males before and after giving an intravenous injection of angiotensin. There was little difference between the results of control injections of 0.9% saline solution and of angiotensin in dioestrous and oestrous females and normal males. On the other hand, pro-oestrous females and stilboestrol treated males responded alike to angiotensin in the form of a decrease in ECFV which was statistically different from the responses in the other three groups (P<0.0005).9. It is suggested that the various results depend on two factors: the site of action of the drug-for example, whether it increases or decreases capillary pressure and therefore, fluid transfer-and also the sex of the animal. The ground substance of the small blood vessels is probably important in taking up and releasing fluid, and its capacity for so doing may well vary with the amount of available oestrogen. It appears that the effect of oestrogens and events at the alpha-adrenoceptor site are connected in some way.", 
    "5": "1. The effects of three beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents on isoprenaline induced changes in systemic and regional blood flow have been investigated in rats anaesthetized with pentobarbitone. The blood flow to the principal vascular beds was measured by the (86)Rb fractionation method.2. Isoprenaline infusion at a rate of 0.3 (mug/kg)/min intravenously caused an increase in cardiac output and a decrease in peripheral resistance which affected different vascular fields unevenly. The coronary and carcass fractions of cardiac output increased while the cutaneous, renal and splenic fractions decreased.3. Pretreatment with propranolol (2 mg/kg intravenously) blocked all isoprenaline effects. Practolol (8 mg/kg intravenously) lessened the effect on cardiac output but did not prevent the vascular effects except those on the coronary circulation. LB 46 (0.2 mg/kg) had less marked beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity than propranolol (2.0 mg/kg).", 
    "6": "Adrenergic and adrenolytic drugs were injected directly into the hypothalamus of the rat brain through permanently implanted cannulas and were found to have reliable effects on water consumption in water-satiated and water-deprived subjects. The beta-adrenergic agonist stimulated thirst, and the beta-adrenergic blocker suppressed thirst. Conversely, the alpha-adrenergic agonist suppressed thirst, and the alpha-adrenergic blocker enhanced thirst. These results demonstrate the existence of a hypothalamic beta-adrenergic \"thirst\" system which opposes a hypothalamic alpha-adrenergic \"water-satiety\" system. In view of our earlier results demonstrating the existence in the hypothalamus of an alpha-adrenergic \"hunger\" system which opposes a beta-adrenergic \"food-satiety\" system, we suggest that a reciprocal inhibitory relationship between these adrenergic hunger- and thirst-regulating systems provides a neurochemical explanation for the ability of organisms to maintain food and water consumption at a constant ratio. In the regulation of both hunger and thirst, the central cholinergic system mimics the hypothalamic beta-adrenergic system and opposes the hypothalamic alpha-adrenergic system.", 
    "7": "We have studied cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) concentrations in human peripheral blood lymphocytes after stimulation with phytohemagglutinin (PHA), isoproterenol, prostaglandins, and aminophylline. Purified lymphocytes were obtained by nylon fiber chromatography, and low speed centrifugation to remove platelets. Cyclic AMP levels were determined by a highly sensitive radioimmunoassay. At concentrations of 0.1-1.0 mmoles/liter isoproterenol and aminophylline produced moderate increases in cyclic AMP concentrations, whereas prostaglandins produced marked elevations. High concentrations of PHA produced 25-300% increases in cyclic AMP levels, alterations being demonstrated within 1-2 min. The early changes in cyclic AMP concentration appear to precede previously reported metabolic changes in PHA-stimulated cells. After 6 hr cyclic AMP levels in PHA-stimulated cells had usually fallen to the levels of control cells. After 24 hr the level in PHA-stimulated cells was characteristically below that of the control cells. Adenyl cyclase, the enzyme which converts ATP to cyclic AMP, was measured in lymphocyte homogenates. Adenyl cyclase activity was rapidly stimulated by fluoride, isoproterenol, prostaglandins, and PHA. Since adenyl cyclase is characteristically localized in external cell membranes, our results are consistent with an initial action of PHA at this level.", 
    "8": "1. Entamoeba coli endotoxin was administered intravenously to cats and dogs.2. The changes in circulating levels of catecholamines and angiotensin following endotoxin were assayed by a continuous superfusion technique.3. The response of the dog was characterized by an immediate sustained rise in angiotensin levels and a later variable rise in catecholamine levels.4. The response of the cat was characterized by an early rise in catecholamine levels and a later rise in angiotensin levels.5. It is concluded that this species difference may reflect the relative importance of renin-angiotensin and sympatho-adrenal systems of dogs and cats, respectively.", 
    "9": "1. The effect of (+/-) dihydroxy ephedrine (DHE), (+/-) dihydroxy pseudoephedrine (DHPE) and isoprenaline on the vasoconstrictor responses of the perfused mesenteric arteries of the rat produced by stimulation of their periarterial sympathetic fibres, and in the responses to injected noradrenaline, has been studied.2. DHE and DHPE inhibited the responses to nerve stimulation and increased the responses to injected noradrenaline.3. Isoprenaline slightly decreased the basal perfusion pressure and reduced the responses to both nerve stimulation and injected noradrenaline. Since these effects of isoprenaline were abolished by propranolol, they are presumably mediated by beta-receptors.4. The inhibitory effect of DHE and DHPE on the responses to nerve stimulation was not abolished by propranolol.5. The results suggest that DHE and DHPE impair adrenergic transmission by partially replacing the adrenergic neurotransmitter, thereby acting as a false neurotransmitter."
