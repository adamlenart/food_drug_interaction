    "0": "Myocardial damage by transthoracic countershocks was assessed by observation for electrocardiographic loss of R waves and elevation of ST segments, creatine kinase depletion, and histologic evidence of necrosis in damaged areas, and by excision and examination, 3 days later, of all tissue macroscopically observed to be damaged. When 4000 J of stored energy was passed across the chest of dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (30 mg/kg), more damage was caused when the energy was divided among 10 shocks than when it was applied in 20 or 40 shocks (at intervals of 0.5 min). The prior intravenous administration of verapamil (1 mg/kg) reduced the weight of damaged shocks. Propranolol (0.4 mg/kg) had no effect. These results give further evidence for the role of calcium accumulation in cardiac necrosis after direct current countershocks. Multiple low-energy shocks cause less cardiac damage than do a few high-energy shocks of similar total energy.", 
    "1": "A study has been made of the effects of newborn calf-serum on the isolated frog ventricle. Preparations were superfused with solutions containing different concentrations of serum and the changes in contractility measured. Ordinary calf-serum evoked a dose-dependent increase in contractile force which was unaffected by adrenergic receptor antagonists (propranolol and phentolamine). Serum which was either used in growing HeLa cells or incubated with chymotrypsin failed to elicit a positive inotropic response. However, if prostaglandin-like materials were extracted from the serum then its ability to potentiate the twitch remained unaltered. These results suggest that the cardioactive-factor present in calf-serum is most probably related to a polypeptide, and possibly a growth factor.", 
    "2": "Intravenous administration of alcohol decreased postural essential tremor but not parkinsonian resting or cerebellar intention tremor. The response to alcohol infusion occurred in all 15 patients studied, whereas only 11 of the 15 had a response to propranolol therapy. Furthermore, the response to ethanol was greater than that due to propranolol.", 
    "3": "Electrical field stimulation (EFS), transmural nerve stimulation, was utilized to investigate autonomic nerve innervation of cat pulmonary artery. EFS (duration; 0.8 msec or 1.0 msec, frequency; 20 Hz, voltage; 70 V, for 15 sec) induced small fast constriction followed by large prolonged relaxation on prostaglandin H2 analog-precontracted cat pulmonary arterial strip which was suspended in a 10 ml organ bath. The small fast constriction was blocked or considerably reduced by addition of phenoxybenzamine. The relaxation was partially blocked in some strips by addition of atropine and/or propranolol. Tetrodotoxin or lidocaine not only blocked relaxation which was not blocked by atropine or propranolol, but also farther reduced or completely blocked the relaxation which was partially blocked by atropine and/or propranolol. It is concluded that (1) alpha-adrenergic nerve regulates pulmonary arterial constriction, (2) beta-adrenergic and cholinergic regulations may be present, but their roles may be substantially small and (3) non adrenergic non cholinergic nerve may play major roles in inhibitory regulation of cat pulmonary circulation.", 
    "4": "It has recently been shown that prostaglandin (PG)E2 or F2 alpha reduces the intraocular pressure (IOP) of cats and primates when applied topically to the eye in very small doses, and that reduced IOP can be maintained in these species as long as the topical application of one of these PGs is repeated daily or twice daily. In the present study the ocular hypotensive efficacy and some of the ocular side-effects of 15 eicosanoids and related compounds, especially derivatives of PGF2 alpha, were compared and were also compared to some clinically used ocular hypotensive agents. Derivatives of PGF2 alpha were found that had short-term and long-term ocular hypotensive potencies some 10- to 50-fold greater than PGF2 alpha itself.", 
    "5": "Twenty-two hypertensive diabetic patients were admitted to a double-blind, within-patient study, and treated with propranolol 80 mg and metoprolol 100 mg twice daily for 4 weeks according to a cross-over design. Dosages of the two drugs such as to induce comparable cardiovascular effects, did not induce relevant changes of fasting blood glucose levels in patients receiving the oral hypoglycaemic agent glibenclamide (group 1), insulin (group 2) or diet alone (group 3). Glucose tolerance, assessed with a 75 g oral load, was however decreased by propranolol, and not by metoprolol in the glibenclamide-treated group. Glucose-induced insulin secretion was reduced by propranolol and not by metoprolol both in the group treated by diet alone and in the glibenclamide-treated group. It is concluded that cardioselective metoprolol seems to be more suitable than the non-selective propranolol in the treatment of arterial hypertension in diabetic subjects, particularly when sulfonylureas are being used as hypoglycaemic agents.", 
    "6": "The relevance of the ancillary pharmacological properties of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) and cardioselectivity to the haemodynamic profile following intravenous beta-blockade was examined in a randomised study of propranolol (16 mg), acebutolol (160 mg) or penbutolol (4 mg) in 30 patients with stable angina pectoris. Haemodynamic measurements were undertaken at rest and during four minutes steady-state supine bicycle exercise (25 to 50 W), load limited to the angina threshold, before and after each drug. The randomised groups were statistically similar for major haemodynamic and clinical variables. The plasma concentrations achieved for each drug were in the therapeutic range. At rest, propranolol resulted in greater reductions in resting cardiac output and greater increase in pulmonary artery occluded pressure compared with acebutolol and penbutolol. During the sympathetic stimulus of dynamic exercise, penbutolol resulted in less depression of exercise cardiac performance than either acebutolol or propranolol. These observations are compatible with previous studies which suggested that the possession of ISA by a beta-blocking drug offset the depression of cardiac performance following intravenous beta-blockade; the benefits of ISA on haemodynamic profile appeared maximum at rest and were reduced or abolished during dynamic exercise.", 
    "7": "Treatment of fifteen patients with essential hypertension over four weeks using the beta 1-adrenoceptor blocking agent, metoprolol, resulted in a decrease in 24 h urinary excretion of kallikrein and aldosterone along with a decrease in plasma renin activity. There was no significant change in 24 h excretion rates of the free adrenal steroids deoxycorticosterone, 18-OH-deoxycorticosterone, corticosterone, cortisol or 18-OH-corticosterone during treatment, which were not significantly different from excretion rates of normal males, thus excluding inhibitory effects of adrenal steroids on urinary kallikrein activity. A positive correlation was found between plasma renin activity and urinary excretion of kallikrein during the control period and after 2 weeks on metoprolol, supporting the assumption of a preserved link between the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and the renal excretion of kallikrein in these patients. The decrease in kallikrein excretion during beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade in patients with essential hypertension may be explained by a reduction in sympathetic tone and by reduced activity of the renin-aldosterone system.", 
    "8": "One-0-hexadecyl-2-0-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (HAGPC), a component of semisynthetic antihypertensive polar renomedullary lipid (APRL) reported by Muirhead et al. in chemically treated rabbit renomedullary lipid had a strong hypotensive action, a cardiosuppressing action and an apparent anti-norepinephrine action. 3-(N-n-octadecylcarbamoyloxy)-2-methoxypropyl-2-thiazolio ethyl phosphate significantly inhibited the hypotensive action of HAGPC, whereas the hypotensive activities of prostaglandin I2, prostaglandin E2, bradykinin, histamine and acetylcholine were not affected by this drug. The blood pressure of rats with established hypertension produced by clipping one renal artery and contralateral nephrectomy normally decreases rapidly after unclipping the renal artery, but the initial rapid decrease was significantly inhibited by an intravenous infusion of 3-(N-n-octadecylcarbamoyloxy)-2-methoxypropyl-2-thiazolio ethyl phosphate. This shows that endogenous 1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine participates in the rapid decrease of blood pressure after unclipping the renal artery in one-kidney, one clip hypertensive rats.", 
    "9": "The effects of penbutolol (40 mg daily) and long-acting propranolol (160 mg daily) were assessed in 26 patients with chronic stable angina in a placebo-controlled randomised double-blind crossover study with 2-weekly treatment periods. In addition to conventional subjective assessment, serial multistage treadmill exercise was used to obtain objective data on drug efficacy and 24-hr ambulatory electrocardiography performed for diurnal heart rate analysis. The mean exercise time of 6.3 +/- 0.5 (SEM) min on placebo increased to 7.3 +/- 0.6 min on penbutolol (P less than 0.01) and to 7.9 +/- 0.5 min on propranolol (P less than 0.001). The pre-exercise resting heart rate was 73 +/- 2 beats/min on placebo and decreased to 63 +/- 2 beats/min on penbutolol (P less than 0.001) and 58 +/- 2 beats/min on propranolol (P less than 0.001). The maximum exercise heart rate was similarly reduced by both drugs and there was a corresponding reduction in peak exercise double product. The time-corrected maximum ST segment depression was reduced by both drugs and neither produced a delay in ST segment recovery. Both drugs effected significant reductions in ambulatory maximum hourly heart rates throughout 24 hr. The lowest observed heart rate on penbutolol was 40 beats/min and 34 beats/min on propranolol. Penbutolol is an effective antianginal agent with a profile of action similar to that of propranolol.", 
    "10": "After treatment with alprenolol for 1 year, serum 3,3',5'-triiodothyronine (rT3) was significantly increased (P less than 0.01) in a group (n = 20) of euthyroid subjects compared to a control group (n = 20) given placebo. All subjects had definite or suspected myocardial infarction one year previously. Serum thyroxine (T4), free T3 index (FT4I), serum 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine, (T3) and free T3 index (FT3I) were not significantly different in the two groups. Alprenolol and placebo were gradually withdrawn over 14 days. On the first day after withdrawal a significant decrease in serum rT3 in the alprenolol treated group was the only change observed. Fourteen days after withdrawal a significant fall in serum T4, FT4I, rT3 and a rise in serum T3 and FT3I was found in the alprenolol treated group. Six months after withdrawal the only further change observed in the alprenolol treated group was an increase in T3 and FT3I. No changes occurred in the placebo treated group in any of the hormones studied. The results are consistent with a direct effect of long-term alprenolol treatment on the peripheral levels of serum T4, T3 and rT3 in euthyroid subjects. The changes in the thyroid hormones after withdrawal further indicate withdrawal of a permanent inhibition of 5'deiodinase during long-term treatment with alprenolol in euthyroid subjects.", 
    "11": "Electrical stimulation of the hypothalamus in anesthetized lean and obese Zucker rats produced equivalent activation of the sympatho-adrenal system (assessed by plasma norepinephrine [NE] and epinephrine [E] levels) and cardiovascular systems (assessed by monitoring intra-arterial blood pressure and heart rate). Basal plasma E levels were 11% higher and basal heart rates were 20% higher in obese than lean rats. Binding of beta-adrenergic antagonist, [3H] dihydroalprenolol to cardiac membranes was equal but there was a slightly lower affinity for various adrenergic agonists in the hearts of obese compared to lean rats. These results suggest that there are no striking abnormalities in the central pathways for activation of the sympatho-adrenal and cardiovascular systems of obese Zucker rats comparable to those previously described in the peripheral sympatho-adrenal system and other specific organs of these animals [8, 9, 12-15].", 
    "12": "Following administration of dibutyryl cyclic-AMP or aminophylline, but not vehicle solution, into the lateral cerebral ventricle of rats produced locomotor stimulation, head and body rearing, circling, (as indicated by an enhancement of gross movement), increased grooming, head swaying and scratching (as indicated by an enhancement of fine movement), tail elevation, piloerection and convulsion. The behavioural excitation produced by either dibutyryl cyclic-AMP or aminophylline was antagonized by pretreatment with intraventricular injection of either two alpha-adrenergic antagonists (phentolamine and yohimbine) or a dopaminergic antagonist (haloperidol), but not with either a beta-adrenergic antagonist (propranolol) or a narcotic antagonist (naloxone). In addition, direct administration of dibutyryl cyclic-AMP into either the anterior hypothalamus, the nucleus accumbens or the caudate-putamen complex of rats produced the same behavioural responses as those produced by the intraventricular injection. Again, the behavioural responses induced by intracerebral injection of dibutyryl cyclic-AMP was antagonized by pretreatment with either alpha-adrenergic antagonists or a dopaminergic antagonist. The present data indicate that both the dopaminergic and the adrenergic receptors in the brain are involved in the behavioural excitation induced by dibutyryl cyclic-AMP and aminophylline in the rat.", 
    "13": "In 10 healthy volunteers the effects of acute increases in concentrations of catecholamines in plasma induced by dynamic exercise (on a bicycle for 15 min at 80% of maximum heart rate) on lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptor density (determined by (+/-)-125iodocyanopindolol binding) and -responsiveness (determined by cyclic AMP responses to 10 mumol/l isoprenaline) were investigated. Immediately after exercise plasma catecholamines were increased about 4-fold; concomitantly receptor density and cyclic AMP production increased 55% and 65%, respectively. One hour after exercise beta-adrenoceptor density and plasma catecholamines had reached values, which were not significantly different from pre-exercise values, while cyclic AMP production was significantly diminished. It is concluded, that acute increases in concentrations of catecholamines in plasma may increase beta-adrenoceptor density and - responsiveness in human lymphocytes.", 
    "14": "The ability of a calcium channel blocker (D-600) and a beta-adrenergic antagonist (propranolol) to modify the chemical, biochemical, functional, and ultrastructural manifestations of reperfusion injury following circumflex coronary artery ligation has been examined using an open chest, anaesthetized rabbit model of acute myocardial ischaemia. A 40-min ligation period followed by 60 min of reperfusion produced a decrease in mitochondrial azide-sensitive ATPase activity which could be prevented by pretreatment with either agent. While both drugs caused an equivalent (approximately 50%) reduction in myocardial Ca2+ accumulation associated with reperfusion, only D-600 preserved Mg2+ and Na+ levels. The greater protective effects of D-600 on sarcolemmal integrity were also apparent from its superior ability (when compared with propranolol) to offer protection against the loss of sarcolemmal Na+-K+ ATPase activity which we have previously suggested may parallel the development of irreversible ischaemic injury. Further support for these biochemical data came from ultrastructural studies in which we demonstrated significant improvement in subcellular membrane integrity by both of the drugs. In contrast to the foregoing protective actions, D-600 and propranolol failed to prevent the marked decrease in myocardial contractile function and in cellular ATP content associated with reperfusion. The superior effectiveness of D-600 in our system cannot be explained on the basis of Ca2+ antagonism alone, but is more likely a result of its greater negative inotropism.", 
    "15": "Aqueous cotton dust extracts (ACDE) stimulated production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in normal human peripheral blood mononuclear leucocytes (MNL). This response was not due to prostaglandin production by monocytes or platelets in the cell preparation nor to stimulation of the beta-adrenergic or H2 receptors; however, desensitization experiments indicated that the response may be receptor mediated. The possible involvement of such receptor desensitization in byssinosis pathogenesis is discussed.", 
    "16": "We investigated the possibility that the positive inotropic effects of the alkylxanthines are due to adenosine receptor blockade. The potency of 8-phenyltheophylline, theophylline and enprofylline as adenosine antagonists was assessed in vitro, using the guinea-pig isolated atrium, and in vivo, using the anaesthetized dog. The order of potency of the alkylxanthines as antagonists of the negative inotropic response to 2-chloroadenosine in vitro, and of the hypotensive response to adenosine in vivo was 8-phenyltheophylline greater than theophylline greater than enprofylline. The order of potency of the alkylxanthines as positive inotropic and chronotropic agents in the anaesthetized dog was enprofylline greater than theophylline greater than 8-phenyltheophylline. The results of this study indicate that the inotropic effects of the alkylxanthines in the anaesthetized dog are not due to adenosine receptor blockade.", 
    "17": "This light microscopic autoradiographic study was performed to test the hypotheses that (a) the density of beta adrenergic receptors (BAR) may differ in various components of the heart and (b) BAR in certain components of the heart may exhibit a selective response to pharmacologic and pathological stimuli. Blocks of canine left ventricle were frozen and tissue sections cut and incubated in (-)[3H]dihydroalprenolol (DHA) to label the BAR. For total and nonspecific binding, serial sections were incubated with and without 10(-5) M (+/-)propranolol. Scintillation spectrometry of sections demonstrated rapid binding, saturability, stereospecificity, a dissociation constant (KD) of 3.2 +/- 0.5 nM (SD) (n = 3), and a maximal binding of 31.3 +/- 3.1 fmol/mg of tissue protein. Isoproterenol was 12.5 times more effective than norepinephrine in displacing DHA. Sections incubated with 10(-5) - 10(-8) M metoprolol, a beta one selective antagonist, demonstrated a KD of 0.7 X 10(-6) M. For autoradiography, emulsion-coated coverslips were attached to the slides. After exposure, the slides were developed and stained, and grain density quantified. Specific BAR binding (n = 4 dogs) was 1,047 +/- 131 (SEM) grains/10(-2) mm2 for myocardial arterioles, 219 +/- 30 for myocardial arteries, 31 +/- 12 for the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), and 231 +/- 34 for cardiac myocytes. Specific binding in the presence of 10(-5) M metoprolol was reduced approximately 75% for both arterioles and myocytes. However, at 10(-6) M metoprolol, the percent reduction in specific DHA binding was greater for myocytes (50%) than for arterioles (0%), and at 10(-7) M metoprolol, the percent reduction in specific DHA binding was 17% for myocytes with no reduction over arterioles. After 1 h of LAD occlusion, a selective increase (18%) in BAR density occurred over cardiac myocytes, but not over blood vessels in the ischemic myocardium. Thus, (a) specific BAR binding was five times greater in arterioles than in small arteries and myocardium and 34 times greater than in the proximal LAD; (b) BAR of myocytes were more sensitive than those of arterioles to displacement by the beta one selective antagonist, metoprolol; and (c) a selective increase in BAR occurs in cardiac myocytes but not in blood vessels after 1 h of ischemia in this experimental model.", 
    "18": "Adrenergic effectors were shown to play a major role in increasing cutaneous water uptake (the hydroosmotic response) in dehydrated anurans. A beta-adrenergic antagonist, propranolol, blocked 61% of the cutaneous response to dehydration and 67% of the response elicited by salt loading in the toad Bufo cognatus. A beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol, elicited a response in normally hydrated animals equal to the propranolol-sensitive portion of the cutaneous hydroosmotic response of dehydrated animals. The isoproterenol-induced cutaneous water balance response in hydrated animals greatly exceeded the response induced by arginine vasotocin, the endogenous antidiuretic hormone.", 
    "19": "The effect of captopril on blood pressure (BP) and various components of the renin-angiotensin system was assessed in ten severely hypertensive patients. Captopril acutely reduced the BP with a maximum decrease of 23% at 90-120 min. Maintenance treatment with captopril alone could not control the BP in any of the patients. Addition of hydrochlorothiazide markedly reduced the BP, while supplementation with propranolol caused no consistent changes. Three patients attained a supine diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) less than or equal to 90 mmHg. Only two patients had a fall in SDBP less than 10 mmHg. One patient stopped because of taste disturbances. Monitoring the renin-angiotensin system showed suppressed plasma concentrations of angiotensin II and increased levels of angiotensin I and renin, indicating the inhibition of converting enzyme activity. Plasma concentration of renin substrate decreased significantly. This observation has important implications for the methodology of renin assays. Captopril is an effective alternative in the treatment of hypertensive patients not readily controlled with conventional therapy.", 
    "20": "We have used autoradiography of [125I]iodocyanopindolol [( 125I]-ICYP) to define the distribution and localization of beta-adrenergic receptors in the rat kidney. [125I]ICYP, a radiolabeled beta-adrenergic antagonist, proved to be an excellent probe to identify these receptors in kidney slices in that specific [125I]ICYP binding was 1) saturable, 2) competed stereoselectively by the agonist isoproterenol and the antagonist propranolol, and 3) competed by agonists in a classical rank order of potency for beta 1-adrenergic receptors (isoproterenol greater than epinephrine congruent to norepinephrine). Autoradiographic studies demonstrated that specific [125I]ICYP sites were present exclusively in the cortex and outer medulla and were localized in glomeruli, ascending limb, and distal tubule-cortical collecting duct. Autoradiography of probes like [125I]ICYP appears to offer a simple and rapid method to assess distribution of adrenergic receptors in the kidney and presumably in other tissues as well.", 
    "21": "To determine the relationship between oxidative capacity and characteristics of beta-adrenergic receptors (beta AR) in skeletal muscle, selected biochemical variables were quantitated in particulate preparations from soleus and gastrocnemius muscle from rats subjected to 10 wk of treadmill running and from three control groups: free-fed, sedentary controls; food-restricted, pair-weighted controls; and animals trained by swimming. Beta AR density and isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity were considerably greater in the slow-twitch oxidative soleus muscle than in the mixed fiber type gastrocnemius in animals from each group (P less than 0.005). Succinic dehydrogenase (SDH) activity of gastrocnemius was increased 23-42% (P less than 0.05) in runners over each of the control groups, concommitantly with a 15-27% increase (P less than 0.05) in beta AR density (Bmax for binding of 125I-cyanopindolol). In 24 animals from all four treatment groups, there was a significant correlation between SDH activity and beta AR density (r = 0.68; P less than 0.001). We conclude that BAR density correlates positively with oxidative capacity in skeletal muscle, but further studies are required to determine the physiological importance of these differences.", 
    "22": "A series of imidazo[1,2-alpha]pyrazine derivatives was synthesized by condensation of alpha-halogenocarbonyl compounds and aminopyrazines. Various compounds resulted from competitive reactions or reagent isomerization and demonstrated in vitro uterine-relaxing and in vivo antibronchospastic activities. On isolated atria, 5-bromoimidazo-[1,2-alpha]pyrazine showed positive chronotropic and inotropic properties; the latter was associated with an increase in the cyclic AMP tissue concentration. Potentiation of the isoproterenol positive inotropic effect of 5-bromoimidazo[1,2-alpha]pyrazine and the lack of blockade of the 5-bromoimidazo[1,2-alpha]pyrazine positive inotropic effect by propranolol suggested phosphodiesterase-inhibiting properties.", 
    "23": "This study examines the beta adrenergic receptors of the rabbit detrusor smooth muscle, employing [125I]iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) as a ligand for the binding of beta adrenergic receptors. Saturation binding experiments on the isolated membrane fraction yielded a KD for ICYP of 14.7 pM and a maximum binding of 147.6 fmol/mg of protein. Displacement of labeled ICYP by a series of beta adrenergic agents yielded the following KD values for the combined high and low affinity binding sites: I-propranolol, 0.76 nM; ICI 118,551, 1.7 nM; zinterol, 38.0 nM; metoprolol, 3.5 microM; and practolol, 61.4 microM. When these displacement experimental results were compared to KD values from other reported binding studies with ICYP for beta adrenoreceptors, both the order of potency and the KD values indicated primarily beta-2 adrenergic receptor subtypes. Computer program Scatfit analysis of the displacement curves indicated a single slope and affinity constant for all five beta adrenergic agents. Hofstee plots for zinterol, ICI 118,551 and metoprolol, however, were not linear and indicated that minor populations of beta-1 adrenoreceptors were also present as both high and low affinity binding sites could be defined. It is concluded that the primary receptor population is beta-2 and that this tissue is heterogenous with a small population of beta-1 adrenoreceptors representing approximately 13 to 23% of the total beta adrenoreceptor population.", 
    "24": "Human leukocytes have been useful in studying desensitization phenomena to beta-adrenergic agonists in a number of clinical conditions. For example, we have previously shown that oral terbutaline causes a time-dependent decrease in neutrophil (PMN) beta receptor number, using the beta antagonist ligand [3H]dihydroalprenolol (DHA), in conjunction with a significant loss of isoproterenol-induced adenylate cyclase activity. In the present in vitro study we have explored the mechanism for beta-adrenergic desensitization and have compared conditions for homologous and heterologous desensitization, using the intact PMN model. PMN preincubated with isoproterenol (10(-4)M), washed thoroughly, then restimulated, desensitize rapidly so that within 10 min 80% of control isoproterenol-induced cyclic AMP stimulation is lost. Cells washed free of isoproterenol recover full responsiveness in 1 to 2 hr. The estimated isoproterenol desensitization EC50 in cells washed and then restimulated is 1 X 10(-5)M, and the EC50 in unwashed cells that are restimulated is 9 X 10(-8)M. Rank-order potency studies of catecholamine desensitization show isoproterenol greater than epinephrine greater than norepinephrine, a beta-2 pattern. Isoproterenol-induced desensitization results in a small reduction in [3H]DHA binding sites, which becomes statistically significant (p less than 0.05) from control values at 1 hr (67% of control) and 3 hr (64%). Since the change in number of beta receptors did not explain the profound, rapid loss of beta agonist-induced cyclic AMP responsiveness, we explored the possibility of an uncoupling phenomenon. In the absence of GTP, isoproterenol binding is characterized by an EC50 of 6.6 +/- 2.6 X 10(-7)M, which is significantly different (p less than 0.05) from the EC50 of 38.1 +/- 9.1 X 10(-7)M found when cells are previously desensitized with isoproterenol for 10 min. GTP does not affect the EC50 of desensitized cells. These findings are consistent with the uncoupled receptor state fitting the model described by Su et al. Finally, prolonged (3 hr) isoproterenol preincubation results in a small but significant (p less than 0.05) loss of cyclic AMP responsiveness to histamine (67.7% +/- 11.7 of control) and PGE1 (59.3% +/- 7.4), suggesting heterologous desensitization. These studies suggest that the human PMN is a suitable model to study both homologous and heterologous desensitization in vitro.", 
    "25": "Exercise thallium-201 perfusion scans and gated equilibrium blood pool scans were performed in 120 catheterized patients with a chest pain syndrome. Eighty-six patients had coronary artery disease and 34 patients did not. The effects of gender, propranolol, exercise level, exercise ischemia, history of typical angina, history of previous myocardial infarction, electrocardiographic Q waves, number of diseases vessels and extent of coronary artery obstruction on diagnostic accuracy were evaluated. The overall sensitivity and specificity of thallium scans were 76 and 68%, respectively, and those of gated blood pool scans 80 and 62% (p = not significant). Propranolol decreased the specificity of thallium scans (propranolol = 42%; no propranolol = 87%, p less than 0.05). Thallium scans and anginal history were less sensitive for detecting coronary disease in women (men: thallium = 79%; angina = 77%; women: 54 and 46%, respectively; p less than 0.05). Exercise level did not significantly affect the diagnostic accuracy of either scan. Thallium and gated scans were both highly sensitive (95%) in detecting disease in 20 patients with a prior myocardial infarction, angina and a positive electrocardiogram. The sensitivity of the thallium scan significantly decreased as the number of diseased vessels decreased. Both thallium and gated scans were less frequently positive in patients with atypical angina or no Q waves, but were not significantly influenced by electrocardiographic ischemia. The sensitivity and specificity of both scans were low in 57 patients with the combination of atypical angina, no history of infarction and equivocal stress electrocardiogram thallium = 61 and 63%, respectively; gated = 61 and 67%). When stress thallium scan evaluation included the electrocardiogram and thallium scan interpretation, the diagnostic accuracy was 81%. When all the information from gated scans (wall motion, ejection fraction, pulmonary blood volume) was combined for final gated scan evaluation, the diagnostic accuracy was 83%. When electrocardiographic data were added to all three gated scan variables, diagnostic accuracy was 77%. In conclusion, thallium perfusion and gated blood pool scans have reasonable diagnostic accuracy for coronary artery disease in a group of patients with a moderately high prevalence of disease. However, combined variables from each test are needed to provide reliable diagnostic accuracy.", 
    "26": "The effects of intravenous propranolol infusion for 24 hr was compared with those of zero-order rectal administration by an osmotic delivery system in six healthy subjects. In plasma and urine, levels of propranolol, 4-OH-propranolol (4-OH-P), and conjugates were determined just before and at 6 hr and at 20 hr during drug administration. With the rectally applied osmotic delivery system providing zero-order release, fairly constant steady-state levels of propranolol in plasma were produced within 12 to 15 hr (four to five times elimination t1/2). The mean steady-state levels were 25 ng/ml after 1.1 micrograms/min/kg rectally and 60 ng/ml after 0.8 micrograms/min/kg IV. The mean rectal systemic availability was 33%; the elimination t1/2s for the two routes did not differ. The results of analysis of plasma for metabolites indicate that after rectal propranolol different metabolic pathways are followed and that there is partial avoidance of first-pass elimination. The isoproterenol challenge resulted in a reproducible assessment of beta-receptor blockade that was closely related to the propranolol concentration in plasma in all subjects and for both routes of administration. With rate-controlled release of propranolol from an osmotic delivery device, the rectal route provides an alternative to intravenous infusion to achieve constant steady-state propranolol concentrations. This may be useful for research purposes or during the perioperative period in surgical patients.", 
    "27": "Adrenergic regulation of adenylate cyclase activities in the zona glomerulosa (the capsular fraction) and the zona fasciculata-reticularis (the decapsulated fraction) from rat adrenocortical glands has been investigated. Specific binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol to the membrane from the capsular and the decapsulated fractions was saturable with dissociation constant (Kd) of 4.67 and 5.1 microM, respectively. The receptor density in the capsular and the decapsulated fractions was 230 and 235 fmol/mg protein, respectively. The potencies which isoproterenol, epinephrine, salbutamol, and norepinephrine competed with [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding sites indicted that adrenergic receptors of the capsular and the decapsulated membranes were of the beta 2-type. beta-Adrenergic stimulation of the adenylate cyclase system was observed only in the capsular fraction. This suggests that beta-adrenergic receptors of the capsular membrane are associated with their adenylate cyclase system, but those of the decapsulated membrane are not. Maximum stimulatory concentrations of ACTH and isoproterenol had no additive effect on the capsular adenylate cyclase, indicating that receptors for ACTH and beta-adrenergic agonists are coupled to a common pool of the cyclase.", 
    "28": "Trophic adrenergic influences may in part potentiate the pressure dependent development of structural cardiovascular changes in hypertension. Regression of such changes by antihypertensive treatment should therefore be most successful if adrenergic blocking drugs are used. In the present study spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) received either alpha-methyldopa, metoprolol, felodipine, a new vasodilating Ca2+-antagonist, or metoprolol and felodipine in combination for 10 weeks. Their left ventricles were weighed and resistance vessel design was analysed using a haemodynamic technique. Arterial pressure (MAP) was equally reduced by metoprolol and felodipine. Despite their different modes of action cardiovascular design was also equally affected. The combined regimen reduced average MAP more than either drug alone. It also caused more pronounced regression of cardiovascular structural changes. Methyldopa lowered MAP less than either metoprolol or felodipine and had only modest effects on cardiovascular design. Thus, the extent of MAP reduction, regardless of which therapeutic regimen is used to induce it, determines the extent of regression of structural cardiovascular changes during antihypertensive treatment.",

    "30": "To assess the beta-blocking potencies of three newly synthesized beta-blockers, i.e., S-596: dl-2-(3'-t-butylamino-2'-hydroxypropylthio)-4-(5'- carbamoyl-2'-thienyl)-thiazole hydrochloride, K-351: 3,4-dihydro-8-(2-hydroxy-3-isopropyl-aminopropoxy)-3-nitroxy -2H-1-benzopyran, and N-696: 4,3-(tert-butylamino)-2-hydroxypropoxy)-N-methylisocarbostyril hydrochloride, values of Ki (inhibition constant) were obtained by the radioligand binding assay method using rat heart membrane treated with neuraminidase. The pA2 values of these blockers as antagonists against the positive chronotropic and inotropic actions of isoproterenol were also determined by pharmacological methods using guinea pig atria. To assess the selectivity of these beta-blockers, pA2 values were also obtained in the isolated trachea using isoproterenol as an agonist. The order of potencies as assessed by Ki and pA2 values were S-596 greater than K-351 greater than N-696. When the Ki values were plotted against the pA2 values together with the Ki and pA2 values of our previous study (Horii et al., 1974; Nakazawa et al., 1978; Nakagawa et al., 1980; Nakagawa et al., 1983; Nagatomo et al., 1983), straight lines were obtained with r values of 0.93 (P less than 0.001) (positive chronotropic action) and 0.91 (P less than 0.001) (positive inotropic action), respectively. Thus, the validity of using the beta-adrenoceptor binding assay method developed in this laboratory using cardiac membrane treated with neuraminidase for assessment of the potencies of beta-adrenoceptor blockers in cardiac muscle was further substantiated.", 
    "31": "The management of the pregnant patient with Graves' thyrotoxicosis remains a contested issue. A retrospective review of our records from 1960 through 1979 involving 25 pregnant women with thyrotoxicosis was performed. Our 25 patients were divided into three management groups, six being managed medically, ten surgically and nine with a combination of medical and surgical therapy. Of the six patients managed medically, four were delivered of term infants and two had premature deliveries. Agranulocytosis developed in one of these women and one infant had a fetal goiter. Of the ten patients surgically managed, three underwent spontaneous abortions, four were delivered of term infants and two had premature deliveries. Of the nine patients who failed to respond to medical treatment and subsequently underwent operation, eight were delivered of term infants. Of the 19 surgically treated patients, one patient had permanent injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve and one had temporary hypoparathyroidism. The combination of thyrotoxicosis and pregnancy is uncommon, but it requires attentive treatment when diagnosed. There are several treatment alternatives basically following either a medical or surgical approach. There appears to be no clear-cut advantage to either choice, both in the literature or in our limited series. We conclude that either choice is safe and effective.", 
    "32": "Thirteen patients developed syncope and a prolonged QTc interval while taking therapeutic doses of sotalol. Polymorphous ventricular tachycardia was observed in 12 patients, and criteria typical of torsade de pointes were present in 10. In 12 patients sotalol had been given with hydrochlorothiazide in a combined preparation, Sotazide, but with inadequate or no potassium supplementation. Serum potassium concentrations were reduced in eight patients. Four patients were taking other drugs known to prolong the QT interval, including disopyramide (three patients) and tricyclic antidepressants (two patients). The QT interval returned to normal in all patients after withdrawal of the drugs and correction of the hypokalaemia. Thus even in low dosage sotalol may be hazardous in the presence of hypokalaemia or when combined with drugs that also prolong the QT interval. The use of sotalol concurrently with potassium losing diuretics, such as the combined preparation Sotazide, may expose the patient to unnecessary risk and should be avoided unless the class III antiarrhythmic action of this unique beta adrenoreceptor blocking agent is also required.", 
    "33": "Several large, prospective, randomized, clinical trials involving more than 11,500 patients testing five beta-blockers with respect to efficacy in reducing mortality after myocardial infarction as well as in preventing recurrent infarctions have been completed. The majority of the studies demonstrated significant mortality reduction when patients were begun on oral beta-blocker therapy prior to discharge from the hospital and maintained on the drug for at least 1 year. Similar benefit has not yet been demonstrated when beta-blockers are instituted parenterally during the early hours of infarction. Most patients should receive, routinely, a beta-blocker at the time of discharge from the hospital after infarction.", 
    "34": "We assessed the effects on renal haemodynamics in 18 black patients with essential hypertension of acute and chronic beta-adrenergic blockade with three agents having different properties: atenolol, nadolol or propranolol. Six patients received each drug. In our patients the antihypertensive response to beta-blockers was minimal or nonexistent. This permitted us to analyse the effects on renal haemodynamics of 'pure' beta-blockade, as opposed to the combined effects of beta-blockade and decreased systemic perfusion pressure. In this setting, neither acute nor chronic administration (two months) of each of these agents decreased renal perfusion. We conclude, therefore, that beta-blockade per se has no deleterious effect on renal function and previous observations are most probably accounted for by the blood pressure lowering effect of these drugs, either alone or coupled with beta-blockade of the renal vasculature allowing unopposed alpha-sympathetically mediated vasoconstriction.", 
    "35": "In an experimental study in 50 dogs the myocardial uptake of free fatty acids (FFAs) after beta-blockade was determined using radioiodinated heptadecanoic acid as a metabolic tracer. All 4 beta-blockers used (metoprolol, timolol, propranolol and pindolol) lowered the uptake of FFAs in the normal canine heart. Uptake of FFAs was also diminished after coronary artery occlusion per se, but administration of beta-blockers exerted little additional influence on the uptake of FFAs. This observation was qualitatively paralleled by the uptake of 201Tl in concomitant experiments. Plasma FFA levels were increased by pindolol (non-selective with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity), not changed by metoprolol (a cardioselective beta-blocking agent) and lowered by timolol and propranolol (both non-selective compounds). The extent of ischemic tissue, as reflected by uptake of iodoheptadecanoic acid and 201Tl, was diminished by metoprolol but not by other beta-blockers. Regional distribution of both tracers, as shown in the endo-epicardial uptake ratios, was hardly influenced by beta-blockade, except for a small increase of 201Tl uptake in non-occluded endocardium. Uptake of 201Tl as well as of iodoheptadecanoic acid in the ischemic area was increased by metoprolol, timolol and propranolol and decreased by pindolol. We conclude that beta-blocking agents confer different effects on myocardial uptake and metabolism of FFAs which might possibly be related to their different inherent properties.", 
    "36": "Previous studies of widely different concentrations of propafenone in various species have reported that in addition to having class 1 antiarrhythmic action, the drug was a beta adrenoceptor blocker and a calcium antagonist. High concentration shortened action potential duration in animal experiments, but Q-T interval was reported as being lengthened in man. It was thought desirable to study the effects of propafenone over a range of concentrations equivalent to those used clinically in various cardiac tissues of a single species, the rabbit. It was concluded that although the primary action of propafenone was on fast inward current, the drug being categorised as of group 1c, its potency as a beta blocker was sufficient for the effect to be of clinical significance. Its potency as a calcium antagonist was relatively weak. Action potential duration and effective refractory period were lengthened in both atrium and ventricle, the effects being long-lasting and persisting on wash-out of the drug when other measurements had returned to control values.", 
    "37": "The effect of the adrenergic agonists noradrenaline (NA), isoproterenol (ISO) and salbutamol (SA) on spontaneous contractions of the circular and longitudinal muscles of rat uterus has been investigated in vitro in the middle and at the end of pregnancy. NA and ISO inhibited the contractions of longitudinal muscle during both stages of pregnancy. NA exerted a biphasic effect on circular muscle contractions (excitatory at lower concentrations and inhibitory at higher concentrations). Both the excitatory and the inhibitory effect of NA on the circular muscle contractions were more pronounced at the end of pregnancy. NA and ISO failed to inhibit completely the circular muscle contractions. SA inhibited the contractions of both muscles and the effect was more pronounced on the longitudinal muscle at the end of pregnancy. Analysis of the effect of the adrenergic antagonists indicated the presence of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors in both uterine muscles. The results suggest that the difference of the contractile response to NA of pregnant uterine muscles may be related to a difference in number or sensitivity of their beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "38": "A new experimental model is presented for determining the optimum dose of 3 different doses (13 mg, 25 mg, 37 mg per day) of hydrochlorothiazide employed to enhance hypotensive effect of 200 mg/day of metoprolol in human hypertension. The model takes into account the circadian variability of blood pressure as sinusoidal function and wash-out effect as a linear trend so as to compensate for bias due to normal temporal variability.", 
    "39": "Antianginal effect of a new beta-blocker corgard (nadolol) was studied in 17 male patients with stable stress angina, aged 42 to 56, in comparison to obsidan and placebo. An original method was used to assess the extent and duration of antianginal effect consisting in repeat identical treadmill exercise coupled with continuous ECG monitoring. Corgard was shown to produce a marked antianginal effect as reflected in significantly reduced ST depression and elevation of angina of effort for more than 24 hours after a single 80 mg dose. Compared to an adequate dose of propranolol, corgard is 20-25% more effective in terms of markedness, and at least 14 hours more effective in terms of duration of the effect.", 
    "40": "The distribution coefficient (D) of atenolol is lower than that of sotalol, despite the latter's lower partition coefficient (P). Since D is the relevant quantity under physiological conditions, it is re-established that atenolol is in practice the more hydrophilic. Because of the common confusion between P and D which this case exemplifies, the relation between them is set out.", 
    "41": "Labetalol, an agent with both alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptor blocking properties, and the beta blocker propranolol were each given for one month to groups of 15 patients with essential hypertension. With either treatment, 11 of the 15 patients experienced decreased supine diastolic blood pressure to less than 90 mm Hg without evidence of fluid retention. Propranolol significantly increased plasma concentrations of uric acid and potassium, whereas labetalol significantly increased plasma concentration of high-density lipoproteins (HDL) and decreased the total cholesterol:HDL ratio; neither drug significantly changed renal function. During three additional months of labetalol treatment, there was a slight tendency to orthostatic decreases in systolic blood pressure as compared with the values after the initial month. Labetalol had variable effects on plasma renin activity and aldosterone excretion, but within individual patients the values were constant; there were close correlations between changes measured after one month and after four months for both renin (r = 0.86) and aldosterone (r = 0.94). The manifestations of labetalol's alpha-blocking component appeared to be a small postural effect on systolic blood pressure and an increase in plasma HDL.",

    "43": "This study analysed the survival rate of 179 patients with triple vessel coronary artery disease, 168 men and 11 women (mean age 54 years). Seventeen cases of left main stem disease were excluded. The patients presented with unstable angina (64 cases), stable angina (66 cases), recent myocardial infarction (26 cases) or chronic invalidating angina (23 cases). Coronary bypass surgery was undertaken whenever possible (64 cases, 34% of patients). Medical therapy (115 cases) was based on betablockers (61%), amiodarone (22%) and perhexiline (17%). The study was carried out by a double questionnaire sent to the patient and treating physician, 6 months to 76 months after coronary angiography (average 30 months). The response to these questionnaires was 100%. Survival rates were calculated by actuarial methods. Comparisons of survival graphs was made using the Log Rang test. The overall survival rate was 89% at 1 year, 84% at 2 years, 82% at 5 years and 71% at 6 years. There seemed to be a lower mortality in the surgical group (p less than 0,28). The 2 year survival rate in the group with cardiac failure was 40% compared with 88% in the group without cardiac failure (p less than 0,001). There was no statistically significant difference in mortality except in patients with ejection fractions lower than 0,30. Analysis of survival with respect to mode of presentation did not show any significant difference between patients with unstable angina, stable angina or chronic invalidating angina. Mortality was higher when triple vessel disease was discovered during myocardial infarction, reaching 33% at 4 years, compared to 15% in the other subgroups (p less than 0,05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "44": "The effect of three different oral doses, 5 mg, 10 mg and 20 mg of betaxolol (BTX), a new long acting cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocking drug, on exercise tolerance was studied in a randomized double blind, cross-over study with latin square distribution in nine male patients with angina pectoris, under continuous therapy with oral nitroglycerin. BTX caused a significant reduction of heart rate (p less than 0.001) for all different dose levels during exercise. Systolic blood pressure was significantly decreased at peak exercise for BTX 10 (p less than 0.01) and BTX 20 (p less than 0.001). During the three treatment periods a significant drop of the rate pressure product (p less than 0.01) was observed and a statistically significant improvement of exercise tolerance, before the occurrence of anginal pain, could be demonstrated. No differences could be detected in oxygen uptake, carbon dioxide output and ventilation between placebo- and treatment periods. BTX was well tolerated in all patients and exerted its effect also in the presence of nitroglycerin. Its cardioselectivity, ease of dosing and complete absence of side effects makes BTX an attractive choice as antianginal agent for chronic use.",

    "46": "Metoprolol was compared to propranolol in the treatment of neuroleptic-induced akathisia by means of an on-drug/off-drug crossover study. Both beta-blockers were effective, but the usefulness of metoprolol was limited by side effects due to the high dose of this medication required to produce a therapeutic effect. The mechanism of action of beta-blockers in the treatment of akathisia is discussed in light of the different pharmacologic properties of metoprolol and propranolol. The study results suggest that these agents are effective in reducing akathisia through a central mechanism of action requiring beta-2 blockade.",

This article reviews the definition and etiology of stable angina pectoris, including reversible risk factors often associated with the disease.

    "48": "The effect of noradrenaline and isoprenaline were studied in the 15-day old chick atria. Noradrenaline increased both the rate and force of atrial contractions whilst isoprenaline only slightly increased force at very high concentrations. The increase in force after noradrenaline and isoprenaline was reduced by phentolamine, an alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist. The beta-antagonist, propranolol and the cardioselective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, atenolol, did not reduce the positive inotropy. Noradrenaline-induced positive chronotropy was, however, resistant to both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockade. It is concluded that the force of contraction of the chick atria may be alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated whilst the rate seems to be mediated by a mechanism sensitive to noradrenaline but insensitive to alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockade.", 
    "49": "We hypothesized that adrenergic mechanisms support the postabsorptive plasma glucose concentration, and prevent hypoglycemia when glucagon secretion is deficient. Accordingly, we assessed the impact of glucagon deficiency, produced by infusion of somatostatin with insulin, without and with pharmacologic alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade on the postabsorptive plasma glucose concentration and glucose kinetics in normal human subjects. During somatostatin with insulin alone mean glucose production fell from 1.5 +/- 0.05 to 0.7 +/- 0.2 mg/kg per min and mean plasma glucose declined from 93 +/- 3 to 67 +/- 4 mg/dl over 1 h; glucose production then increased to base-line rates and plasma glucose plateaued at 64-67 mg/dl over 2 h. This plateau was associated with, and is best attributed to, an eightfold increase in mean plasma epinephrine. It did not occur when adrenergic blockade was added; glucose production remained low and mean plasma glucose declined progressively to a hypoglycemic level of 45 +/- 4 mg/dl, significantly (P less than 0.001) lower than the final value during somatostatin with insulin alone. These data provide further support for the concept that maintenance of the postabsorptive plasma glucose concentration is a function of insulin and glucagon, not of insulin alone, and that adrenergic mechanisms do not normally play a critical role. They indicate, however, that an endogenous adrenergic agonist, likely adrenomedullary epinephrine, compensates for deficient glucagon secretion and prevents hypoglycemia in the postabsorptive state in humans. Thus, postabsorptive hypoglycemia occurs when both glucagon and epinephrine are deficient, but not when either glucagon or epinephrine alone is deficient, and insulin is present.", 
    "50": "Carbohydrate and lipid metabolism at rest and after 1 h submaximal physical exercise in cold weather (between -1 and -6 C) were studied in ten healthy male subjects treated in a randomized double-blind fashion for 2 days with either placebo, the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with high ISA pindolol (10 mg), or the cardioselective drug atenolol (100 mg). Four subjects, on both atenolol and pindolol, complained of muscular fatigue during exercise on beta blockade; four other subjects perceived some fatigue. There were no significant differences in blood glucose or insulin levels between treatments and placebo period. Post-exercise growth hormone levels increased on placebo (p less than 0.01), on pindolol (p less than 0.01), and on atenolol (p less than 0.05), but the alteration was more prominent on pindolol than on placebo (p less than 0.05). The plasma free fatty acid concentrations increased during exercise on placebo and pindolol (p less than 0.05) and on atenolol (p less than 0.01). Serum triglyceride concentrations decreased significantly during exercise on placebo or pindolol (p less than 0.01). Triglyceride levels before exercise were significantly higher on beta blockade than on placebo (p less than 0.05). The metabolic parameters taken before and after exercise did not explain the muscle fatigue experienced by many subjects during exercise.", 
    "51": "We tested the hypothesis that (1) beta 1-selective and nonselective beta adrenoceptor blockades have a different influence on stress-induced catecholamine overshoot, and (2) beta 1-selective blockade shifts the epinephrine/norepinephrine ratio in favor of norepinephrine. Seven violinists were investigated; each performed four times in public after ingesting different beta blockers. A significantly greater urinary norepinephrine/creatinine excretion was found with selective beta blockade than with nonselective. In addition during selective beta blockade creatinine excretion decreased significantly in comparison with nonselective blockade. This might be due to a higher concentration of circulating norepinephrine, stimulating alpha receptors in the renal vasculature.", 
    "52": "In a single-blind, placebo-controlled study, esmolol was administered intravenously to 12 patients with chronic atrial fibrillation. Esmolol produced a significant dose-dependent decrease in the ventricular rate without conversion to normal sinus rhythm in any of the patients. For most patients, a correlation was observed between the blood levels of esmolol and reductions in heart rate. There were no significant adverse effects. We conclude that esmolol is an effective and safe agent for the control of heart rate in patients with supraventricular tachycardia.", 
    "53": "The action of catecholamines and somatostatin on cyclic adenosine 3',5' monophosphate (cyclic AMP) formation in human isolated gastric glands is reported. We show that: (1) there is a beta 2 receptor-mediated stimulation of cyclic AMP production in fundus. Catecholamines act with the order of potencies isoproterenol (ED50 = 50 nmol 1(-1) greater than epinephrine (ED50 = 0.1 mumol 1(-1] greater than norepinephrine (ED50 = 5 mumol 1(-1]. Their action is completely reversed by propranolol at doses 10(3) times lower than practolol, while unaffected by phentolamine; (2) isoproterenol and Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) have additive effects on cyclic AMP in fundic glands whereas no additivity is observed between histamine and isoproterenol; this, together with the absence of catecholamine effect in antral glands, suggests that the beta 2 receptor is located on parietal cells; (3) somatostatin (1 mumol 1(-1] non-competitively inhibits the stimulation by catecholamines but does not affect VIP and histamine stimulations. These results suggest a physiological stimulatory effect of catecholamines on gastric acid secretion in man, through a beta 2 receptor coupled to the cyclic AMP system, regulated by somatostatin.",

Sexual dysfunction is a relatively common complication of antihypertensive drug therapy and has been associated with nearly all of the antihypertensive agents. The physiology of the normal sexual response, proposed mechanisms of sexual dysfunction, and the types of disorders and relative incidence rates associated with individual agents are discussed. Since a disturbance in sexual function may lead to poor compliance with the drug regimen, it is important that the clinician be familiar with this topic. Information on the detection of antihypertensive-agent-induced sexual dysfunction, patient counseling, and therapeutic alternatives, should a disorder in sexual function occur, also is provided.", 
    "55": "The beta-adrenergic blockade-induced reduction in myocardial norepinephrine overflow during sympathetic stimulation was examined by use of the multiple indicator-dilution technique. A kinetic model incorporating the effects of flow, capillary permeability surface product for norepinephrine, the interstitial uptake rate constant for neurotransmitter, and plasma norepinephrine input and output values was used to estimate the rate of local release of norepinephrine into the interstitial space. The model was tested by first examining the effects of two drugs that increase myocardial norepinephrine overflow during sympathetic stimulation by differing mechanisms: desmethylimipramine, a norepinephrine uptake inhibitor, and phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic blocker. The uptake inhibitor was demonstrated to reduce interstitial uptake and the alpha-blocker to increase local neurotransmitter release, without change in blood flow. The beta-adrenergic blocker, in contrast, reduced coronary blood flow and decreased the capillary norepinephrine permeability surface product but did not change the rate of local release. The decreased norepinephrine overflow after beta-blockade was deduced to result from the decrease in transcapillary flux and secondary increase in interstitial uptake.", 
    "56": "We have previously reported that, in conscious, unrestrained dogs in which insulin and glucagon levels were clamped pharmacologically, combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade resulted simultaneously in a fall in plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels and an increase in glucose production. In this study we have tested the hypothesis that the increase in glucose production observed in the previous study was due to the fall in plasma FFA concentration. Glucose production was measured by means of the primed-constant infusion of [6-3H]- and/or [U-14C]glucose, and insulin and glucagon were clamped at constant levels by means of the infusion of somatostatin, insulin, and glucagon. When no attempt was made to control the FFA levels, combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade significantly decreased plasma FFA levels, and this was associated with a significant increase in the rate of glucose production. However, the glucose production response to adrenergic blockade was entirely prevented by the clamping of FFA levels at a high, constant value by the infusion of a 10% lipid emulsion (Liposyn) and heparin. We conclude that basal adrenergic activity is important in the mobilization of fat but does not directly influence glucose production. Further, there is an inhibitory effect of FFA on glucose production that is unmasked during hormonal control and alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade.", 
    "57": "Important advances in understanding of the pathophysiology and medical treatment of angina pectoris have taken place in the past few years. Angina may occur from increased oxygen demands that cannot be met by a diseased coronary circulation and/or primary decrease in oxygen supply to the heart. Three major categories of pharmacologic agents are used in treating angina. Nitrates remain the first-line approach; they are inexpensive and available in many delivery forms. Beta blockers are also effective in the treatment of angina pectoris, and despite their side effects, are particularly useful in effort angina. The newest agents, the calcium channel blockers, are efficacious in all types of anginal syndromes. Each group of drugs acts differently on the various pathophysiologic mechanisms that contribute to the production of angina. This commentary critically reviews the major groups of anti-anginal drugs and places them in a clinical perspective. Guidelines for choosing an appropriate agent for the treatment of angina are proposed. Special situations, such as angina and hypertension, congestive heart failure, or post-myocardial infarction angina, are discussed with respect to selection of anti-anginal therapy. The proper utilization of nitrates, calcium channel blockers, and beta blockers, alone or in combination, provides a bright future for patients with ischemic heart disease.", 
    "58": "Combinations of 2 or 3 drugs are often used to treat angina pectoris, but their combined cardiorespiratory effects have not been investigated. Using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled protocol, the effects of nadolol alone and nadolol in combination with isosorbide dinitrate and nifedipine were compared, in low and high doses, on antianginal efficacy, respiratory functions and arterial blood oxygen saturation (SaO2) in 19 patients with stable angina pectoris. A complete assessment including a bicycle exercise test with the measurement of the sum of ST-segment depression in all leads (sigma ST) was carried out every 2 weeks. The frequency of anginal attacks and nitroglycerin consumption was reduced significantly (p less than 0.001) by nadolol alone and in combination with the other drugs. Nadolol caused a slight reduction in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second, which was improved by isosorbide dinitrate and nifedipine. The sigma ST profile (basal, at peak exercise and 2 and 5 minutes after exercise) was decreased by nadolol alone and in combination with the other drugs, although the greatest reduction was achieved with large doses of nifedipine and nadolol. The rest and postexercise SaO2 decreased after nadolol alone and in combination with isosorbide dinitrate, but recovered to pretrial values after nifedipine and nadolol. With all drug combination, sigma ST depression was greater when the postexercise SaO2 was less than 92%, and decreased (p less than 0.05) in the same patients when their postexercise SaO2 was greater than 92%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "59": "The hemodynamic effects of corwin were evaluated in 9 patients with coronary artery disease and without clinical signs of heart failure at rest, during submaximal exercise and during exercise-induced angina pectoris before and after administration of corwin. Angina pectoris was always prevented after the drug was given and the exercise intensity was increased until recurrence of angina pectoris; hemodynamic data were also recorded at this higher exercise capacity (+16%: p less than 0.001). At rest, corwin increased heart rate (from 80 to 84 beats/min) and pressure-rate product. During submaximal exercise, heart rate decreased from 105 to 96 beats/min, and pressure-rate product and ST-segment depression also decreased after corwin. The prevention of angina pectoris in all patients was accompanied by a lower heart rate (from 132 to 117 beats/min), pressure-rate product and ST-segment depression. At rest and during exercise, the cardiac output was unchanged and the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was slightly decreased after corwin (from 12.5 to 10 mm Hg; p less than 0.001). At the 16% greater exercise capacity after corwin, angina pectoris recurred at the same values of cardiac output, pulmonary wedge pressure and ST-segment depression; maximal heart rate decreased from 132 to 124 beats/min, and the pressure-rate product was lower. Thus, corwin is an active antianginal drug. Its effects are likely due to a decrease in pressure-rate product and myocardial oxygen requirements during exercise. In contrast to beta-antagonists devoid of partial agonist activity, corwin does not depress left ventricular function either at rest or during exercise.", 
    "60": "Factors associated with total cardiac mortality, sudden cardiac death and reinfarction were studied in 325 male survivors aged younger than 60 years of age (mean 50) of a first myocardial infarction (MI). All patients had undergone exercise testing and cineangiocardiography 4 weeks after MI, 24% underwent coronary artery surgery and 30% received beta-blocking therapy. Patients were followed 1 to 6 years (mean 3.5). Total cardiac mortality was best predicted by the left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) and by a coronary prognostic index. In contrast, neither the severity of coronary arterial lesions measured with a scoring system nor the results of the exercise test gave significant prediction of mortality. Of the 2 major late sequelae of MI, reinfarction could not be predicted by any clinical or cineangiocardiographic variable. However, sudden death not associated with reinfarction was significantly more common (p less than 0.001) when EF was less than or equal to 40% than when it was greater than 40%. Comparison of patients with an EF less than or equal to 40% who did or did not die suddenly showed that LV dilation (high volumes at ventriculography) was an added risk factor, but the extent of coronary occlusions and stenoses was not. It is concluded that, at least for groups of patients treated with standard modern methods after MI, the main determinant of medium-term survival is the extent of LV damage. The state of the coronary arteries and the presence of ischemic myocardium during exercise are only of secondary importance for survival.",

Generally, treatment should involve education and supportive psychotherapy, behavioral therapies designed to promote relaxation and adjustment to stress, and short-term pharmacotherapy. Although some clinical data from uncontrolled studies point to the possible importance of others drugs (eg, beta-blocking agents) in treating anxiety, the major pharmacotherapy rests with antianxiety drugs, particularly the benzodiazepine. Because each benzodiazepine appears to be relatively effective, a specific agent is selected for a particular clinical situation on the basis of its kinetic (especially its half-life) and side-effect profiles. A nonbenzodiazepine soon to be released in the United States, buspirone (Buspar), appears to be effective and nonaddictive and is not potentiated by alcohol. However, the final verdict as to its usefulness and safety in treating anxiety awaits results of further testing.", 
    "62": "The postulated beta adrenoceptor blocking properties of the new antiarrhythmic drug propafenone were studied by in vivo comparison against placebo and propranolol in the antagonism of both exercise- and isoproterenol-induced tachycardia and by in vitro radioligand binding studies of animal and human left ventricular muscle membrane preparations. Interaction with frog erythrocyte membrane adenylate cyclase was also investigated. In the clinical studies, a double blind crossover comparison of oral propafenone (300 mg), propranolol (40 mg) and placebo indicated significant antagonism of chronotropic response to isoproterenol 2 hr postdose with dose ratios of 4.1 +/- 1.3 (mean +/- S.E.M.) for propafenone and 16.8 +/- 5.1 for propranolol. Chronotropic response to exercise was modestly reduced by propafenone. Analysis of the binding of [125I]iodocyanopindolol to human left ventricular membranes revealed specific beta adrenoceptor competition by propafenone with an EC50 of 111 +/- 13 nM. Propranolol EC50 was 2.4 +/- 0.2 nM in this system. Competitive inhibition of isoproterenol-stimulated frog erythrocyte membrane adenylate cyclase activity was also obtained with propafenone. The ratio of affinities (calculated from the apparent dissociation constant; KD) for propranolol-propafenone was 1:40 for the in vivo study and 1:50 for the in vitro system. Propafenone is a specific antagonist of the human beta adrenoceptor and this action can be demonstrated during in vivo study in human subjects. At clinical dosages it appears likely that it will achieve a modest degree of beta blockade which may contribute to its antiarrhythmic effect.", 
    "63": "To study potential cardiac receptor alterations during the development of spontaneous hypertension, specific binding of [3H]-2-N(2,6-dimethoxyphenoxyethyl)amino-methyl-1,4-benzodioxane, (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol and (-)-[3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate in ventricles of Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY), spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and stroke-prone SHR (SHRSP) at different ages was determined. The Kd and maximal binding for specific binding of [3H]-2-N(2,6-dimethoxyphenoxyethyl)amino-methyl-1,4-benzodioxane and (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol in ventricular homogenates of SHR and SHRSP at prehypertensive ages were similar to those of age-matched WKY. With the development of spontaneous hypertension in SHR and SHRSP, there was a significant decrease in the maximal binding for both ligands without a change in Kd. The decrease in maximal binding in SHR and SHRSP at 10 weeks of age was 29 to 38%, compared with age-matched WKY. There was no difference in ventricular (-)-[3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding between WKY and SHRSP. Hofstee analysis of the inhibition of ventricular (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol binding by practolol demonstrated a specific 51% decrease in ventricular beta-1 receptor density in 10-week-old SHRSP. In addition, the inotropic response to isoproterenol in isolated papillary muscles from SHRSP was significantly smaller than that in WKY. Thus, it is concluded that during the development of spontaneous hypertension in SHR and SHRSP, there is a specific loss in number of cardiac alpha and beta-1 adrenoceptors with a consequently reduced responsiveness of isolated papillary muscles to isoproterenol in SHRSP. These results are compatible with the reported increase in sympathetic outflow to the cardiovascular system in spontaneous hypertension.", 
    "64": "Effects of noradrenergic stimulation and depletion on the K+-p-nitrophenylphosphatase activity and ouabain binding associated with (Na+, K+)-adenosine triphosphatase (E.C. 3.6.1.3) were examined in heart, soleus, brown adipose tissue and kidney. Stimulation by repeated yohimbine or d-amphetamine increased and depletion by parenteral 6-hydroxydopamine decreased enzyme activity or ouabain binding in each tissue studied except kidney. Some increase in the parameters associated with (Na+, K+)-adenosine triphosphatase was seen after repeated doses of 1 mg/kg of d-amphetamine or yohimbine, with maximal effects at 2 mg/kg of yohimbine and 5 or 10 mg/kg of d-amphetamine. Stimulation was reduced by administration of alpha-1 or beta noradrenergic antagonists. Repeated treatment with isoproterenol, but not with phenylephrine, increased ouabain binding and enzyme activity in the heart. The decrease and recovery of enzyme activity in the heart after administration of the reversible noradrenergic neurotoxin N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP4) were parallel to the recovery of norepinephrine content and desmethylimipramine binding. The effects of the noradrenergic changes appeared to involve chiefly the fraction of enzyme with high affinity for ouabain.", 
    "65": "Identification of two distinct types of adrenotropic receptors, alpha and beta, by Raymond Ahlquist provided the scientific basis that enabled the development of drugs to selectively block adrenoceptor function. These pharmacotherapeutic advances have improved the care of patients with coronary and hypertensive cardiovascular disease.", 
    "66": "A 27 year old woman presented with recurrent episodes of disabling paroxysmal sinus tachycardia (150 to 180 beats/min) in the absence of identifiable organic disease. Tachycardia was resistant to all drug therapy. Programmed stimulation could not induce the tachycardia but high dose propranolol therapy failed to suppress sinus tachycardia in response to isoproterenol infusion. Because of the disability resulting from refractory tachycardia, the patient underwent a new operative procedure to create exit block around the region of abnormal impulse formation. This resulted in the appearance of a stable junctional escape rhythm at 60 beats/min. No adverse effects occurred and the patient has remained free of symptoms after a follow-up period of 10 months.", 
    "67": "Esmolol (ASL-8052) is a new intravenous beta-adrenergic blocking agent that has exhibited both cardiac selectivity and an extremely short half-life in animal studies. To assess its clinical efficacy, 16 patients were studied with a rapid ventricular rate associated with atrial flutter (n = 2), atrial fibrillation (n = 10), atrial tachycardia (n = 2) and multifocal atrial tachycardia (n = 2). During a 30 minute control period of observation, the ventricular rate ranged from 121 to 150 beats/min (mean 133.2 +/- 10.6). Using a double blind crossover method, esmolol was infused intravenously for a maximum of 60 minutes. Infusions of 50, 100, 150, 200, 250 and 300 micrograms/kg per min were given in consecutive 5 minute periods (during the first minute of each period, a loading dose of 500 micrograms/kg was given). Not all patients received the maximal dose. A response was defined as conversion to sinus rhythm or a 20% reduction in ventricular rate. One patient with atrial fibrillation associated with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome did not respond. In the remaining 15 patients, their highest esmolol infusion rate was maintained for an additional 30 minutes. This resulted in a reduction in ventricular rate to a mean of 97.8 +/- 12.9 beats/min (range 72 to 119) (p less than 0.001). Conversion from flutter/fibrillation to sinus rhythm occurred in two patients. During the infusion, six had transient asymptomatic hypotension that was mild and manageable. After infusion, ventricular rate and blood pressure returned rapidly toward control values within 25 minutes in patients without conversion to sinus rhythm.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "68": "Butoxamine, a beta 2-adrenergic blocking agent, which temporarily blocks the G1-S transition of human bone marrow granulocyte precursors in vitro, was used in vivo together with 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C) in mice. Butoxamine alone depressed the granulocyte labeling index and granulocyte-monocyte colony-forming Cell (GM-CFC) suicide rate at a dose of 3 micrograms/g body weight. A maximum effect was produced 6 to 12 hr after injection. Butoxamine administered 8 hr before an injection of ara-C modified the proportion of GM-CFC in S phase as compared with the number found after ara-C alone. After a series of five ara-C injections, administered at intervals of 16 hr, 70% of the treated mice died within 2 weeks, whereas only 42% of mice pretreated with butoxamine 7 to 9 hr before each ara-C injection died. This difference was due to the more rapid return to normal of GM-CFC numbers and an increase in the proportion of GM-CFC and granulocyte precursors in S phase in the butoxamine-pretreated animals. These findings suggest that butoxamine may have a potential use in protecting hematopoiesis during intensive chemotherapy for cancer.", 
    "69": "[125I]Iodo-2-[beta-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-ethylaminomethyl]tetralone ([125I]HEAT), a selective, high affinity, high specific activity alpha 1-adrenoceptor ligand, is used to characterize alpha-adrenoceptors in the rat pineal gland. Binding of [125I]HEAT to membranes is rapid [association rate constant (Kon) = 3.1 nM-1 min-1] and readily reversible either by 100-fold dilution or by addition of excess unlabeled HEAT [apparent dissociation rate constant (Koff) = 0.153 min-1). Saturation experiments indicate a single class of noncooperative binding sites with an equilibrium binding constant (KD) of 41 +/- 9 pM and a Bmax of 399 +/- 63 fmol/mg protein. The relative potency of a number of adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists in competing with [125I] HEAT indicates the receptor is an alpha 1-subtype. In addition, inhibition of binding is stereospecific; (-)epinephrine and norepinephrine are more than 100-fold more potent than their (+)isomers. The identification of alpha 1-adrenoceptors in the pineal gland is consistent with evidence indicating a role for these receptors in the regulation of melatonin synthesis and phosphatidylinositol turnover.", 
    "70": "In a controlled, randomized, double-blind study we investigated the long-term effects of the beta 1-adrenoceptor agonist prenalterol in 16 patients with severe congestive heart failure (NYHA class III or IV). Previous to and 1 week, 3 months, and 6 months after continuous oral intake of 40 to 120 mg prenalterol a day, catheterization of the right heart combined with an ergometer test was carried out; M mode and two dimensional echocardiograms as well as systolic time intervals were also recorded. With prenalterol the heart rate increased within 1 week from 81 +/- 7 to 90 +/- 7 beats/min (mean +/- SD) (p less than .05) and remained increased after 3 months (93 +/- 9 beats/min, p less than .01) and 6 months (91 +/- 6 beats/min, p less than .05). After 1 week the cardiac index rose from 2.7 +/- 0.7 to 3.3 +/- 0.7 l/min/m2 (p less than .01), and after 3 and 6 months it fell again to 3.0 +/- 0.9 l/min/m2 and 2.9 +/- 0.7 l/min/m2, respectively. In the ergometer test the improvement in performance was not significant. The mean velocity of circumferential fiber shortening initially increased from 0.58 +/- 0.20 to 0.79 +/- 0.28 circumferences/sec (p less than .01), but dropped after 3 months to 0.62 +/- 0.31 circumferences/sec. The ejection fraction determined from the two-dimensional echocardiogram rose after 1 week from 20 +/- 10 to 27 +/- 12% (p less than .05), but decreased again after 3 months (23 +/- 11%) and 6 months (20 +/- 10%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "71": "Time and temperature dependence of the binding of 3H-dihydroalprenolol (3H-DHA) to beta-adrenergic receptors in rat cerebral cortex is described. The kinetic data obtained suggest that 3H-DHA binding proceeds through a two-step reaction scheme consisting of a bimolecular association step followed by an unimolecular internal conversion of the radioligand receptor complex (isomerisation). Equilibrium thermodynamic analysis provided evidence that the over-all binding process is associated with a small decrease in enthalpy and a substantial increase in entropy. Within the framework of the two-step binding kinetics, the evaluation of the temperature dependence by the van't Hoff analysis resulted in values for thermodynamic parameters for the single equilibrium steps. The data suggest that the association step can be considered as a bimolecular hydrophobic interaction which is mainly entropy-driven due to the release of structural water, while the isomerisation step is accompanied by a large negative change in both enthalpy and entropy. The large negative change in the activation entropy for the forward reaction of the isomerisation step, obtained from evaluation of Arrhenius plots, indicates an internal conversion to a highly ordered receptor-ligand complex, while the low activation energy points to a small threshold energy for reaching this structure. Thus, these result support a previous assumption that the hydrophobic center of an adrenergic antagonist interacts with the receptor by entering a pocket (Cherksey et al. 1981).", 
    "72": "The effect of insulin on the alpha1-adrenergic stimulation of glycogenolysis and ureogenesis, which is very small or undetectable in hepatocytes from control animals, is marked in hepatocytes from hypothyroid rats; the metabolic actions due to alpha1-adrenergic activation, but not those due to glucagon, were nearly blocked by insulin in cells from hypothyroid rats. The alpha1-adrenergic-mediated stimulation of phosphatidylinositol labelling was not affected by insulin in cells from either control or hypothyroid rats. The data suggest that the alpha1-adrenergic action proceeds through two pathways, one of which is very sensitive to insulin and predominates in cells from hypothyroid rats.", 
    "73": "Asthma may be very mild, at times hard to diagnose; beta blockade should be used only with great caution. An asthmatic who becomes thyrotoxic should be closely monitored for deterioration of the asthma.", 
    "74": "Infusion of histamine into the coronary circulation of the isolated perfused rat heart produced a marked and concentration-dependent fall in perfusion pressure. A similar effect was obtained with 2-pyridylethylamine, a histamine H1-receptor agonist. Impromidine, a potent H2-receptor agonist, however, was found to be ineffective. Mepyramine but not cimetidine competitively inhibited the fall in perfusion pressure induced by histamine and 2-pyridylethylamine. Propranolol, a non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blocker, failed to abolish the coronary vasodilator effect of both histamine and 2-pyridylethylamine. From these results it was concluded that although the rat is known to be insensitive to histamine, this amine has a marked H1-mediated vasodilator effect in the isolated perfused coronary vasculature of this species.", 
    "75": "The antihypertensive efficacy of prazosin was compared with that of a combination of prazosin and propranolol in 14 patients with essential hypertension. All patients had sitting diastolic blood pressures greater than or equal to 95 mm Hg despite daily therapy with 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide and 240 mg of propranolol. After a 4-week monitoring period, patients were divided randomly into 2 groups in whom either (1) propranolol was reduced to 120 mg/day (to avoid potential hypotension) and prazosin was added, starting with an initial dose of 1 mg twice daily, or (2) propranolol was tapered and discontinued as prazosin was added. The average doses of prazosin were 7.4 and 7.6 mg/day, respectively. After 12 weeks of therapy, blood pressure was reduced in both groups, and there was no significant difference in the reduction of blood pressure or dose of prazosin in the 2 groups. Mean heart rate increased significantly in both groups (p less than 0.01), but more so in the group of patients who discontinued propranolol therapy. Thus, when a combination of 50 mg/day of hydrochlorothiazide and 240 mg/day of propranolol is insufficient to control hypertension, the addition of prazosin is shown to decrease blood pressure whether or not propranolol is continued."
