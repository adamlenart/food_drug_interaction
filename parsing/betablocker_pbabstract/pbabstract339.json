However, a recent study has shown that efaroxan may also act as a blocker of a second class of potassium channel (the Kmaxi channel) in red blood cells, raising the possibility that its effects in islets could be mediated by interactions with both types of channel. Since the antimycotic imidazole compound clotrimazole is a highly potent blocker of Kmaxi channels, we have studied the effects of this drug on insulin secretion. Clotrimazole stimulated insulin secretion from rat islets of Langerhans incubated in the presence of 6 mM glucose, in a dose-dependent manner. Experiments performed at different glucose concentrations showed that the actions of clotrimazole were most prominent at low glucose concentrations whereas it did not enhance secretion beyond the rate induced by 20 mM glucose. The insulinotropic action of clotrimazole was temperature dependent but was independent of extracellular calcium. Clotrimazole appeared to block ATP-sensitive potassium channels in islets since, like efaroxan and glibencamide, it was able to prevent the inhibitory effects of diazoxide on glucose-induced insulin secretion. However, neither the direct stimulatory effect of clotrimazole on insulin release nor the abilty of clotrimazole to reverse the inhibitory actions of diazoxide was sensitive to blockade by the imidazoline secretagogue antagonist KU14R. Overall, the results suggest that clotrimazole exerts an insulinotropic effect in pancreatic beta-cells that is distinct from the actions of imidazoline secretagogues such as efaroxan. Clotrimazole can increase insulin secretion at sub-maximal glucose concentrations by an action which appears to be independent of membrane ion channel events.", 
    "1": "To assess medical attention focused on hypertension (HBP) in the elderly, this study examines trends in HBP prevalence, treatment, and control status in a defined population of persons > or = 65 years of age enrolled in a large HMO. Random samples of approximately 400 persons were drawn for the years 1967, 1974, 1981, and 1988. First recorded ambulatory pressures, available on over 90% of subjects in each period, were obtained from medical records. Prevalence of HBP (SBP > or = 160 and/or DBP > or = 95, and/or taking anti-HBP drugs) ranged between 44% to 53%. Proportion with HBP on treatment increased from 25% in 1967 to 60% in 1988 (P<.001); proportion on treatment and controlled (SBP < 160, DBP < 95) increased from 8% to 34% (P<.001). Mean population SBP declined from 155.2 in 1967 to 144.0 in 1988 (P<.001); mean DBP declined from 85.2 to 81.2 (P<.001). Proportion with isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) (SBP > or = 160, DBP < 90) remained unchanged at 12% to 14%. Use of diuretics and adrenergic antagonist agents declined while use of beta blockers and newer classes of anti-HBP drugs increased significantly among treated hypertensives in the 1980s. These findings parallel HBP trends in younger adults from National Health Survey data though we find evidence of a substantial gap in addressing the problem in the elderly, who constitute the population at greatest risk of cardiovascular complications of HBP.",

Each rat was dosed with REMI (15 micrograms/kg/min), and REMI & ES (15 micrograms/kg/min and 600 micrograms/kg/min) for 21 minutes in a random crossover design. Six serial blood samples were collected over 25 minutes into test-tubes containing 0.5 ml acetonitrile. Blood samples were extracted with methylene chloride and analyzed by a validated GC-MS assay. EEG was captured and subjected to power spectral analysis (0.1-50 Hz) for spectral edge (97%).",

A linked sigmoid Emax PK-PD model was used and the pharmacodynamic parameters were not statistically different. Mean Emax and EC50 after REMI were 18.0 +/- 6.0 Hz and 32 +/- 12 ng/ml; and after REMI + ES were 19 + 4.8 Hz and 26 + 8.6 ng/ml.",

Two of the final products (X = CONH) were obtained by coupling the appropriate furoxancarboxylic acids with N-[2-hydroxy-3-(1-naphthoxy)propyl]-ethylenediamine. beta 1- and beta 2-blocking activities were examined on isolated guinea pig right atria and on guinea pig trachea respectively. Vasodilating properties were assessed on endothelium denuded strips of rat aorta.", 
    "8": "Some derivatives behave as well balanced \"hybrids\" displaying NO-dependent vasodilating and beta-blocking properties in the same concentration range. Some others display either prevalent beta-blocking or vasodilating activity. Generally speaking hybrid formation lowers the affinity for beta-receptors, in particular for beta 2-type, to give an increase in beta 1/beta 2 selectivity.",

    "11": "Interactions with phospholipids were measured by high performance liquid chromatography on a stationary phase made up of phospholipids, the so-called \"Immobilized Artificial Membrane\" (IAM). Reference lipophilicity parameters were measured by shake-flask method between n-octanol and buffer phases.", 
    "12": "Interactions with phospholipids were predicted from log P for all compounds except tocainide, which also showed additive polar extra-interactions. Moreover, when the retention on Immobilized Artificial Membrane (IAM) phase was mainly lipophilicity-based, a unique scale included the correlation between log kwIAM and log P values, for both LAs (bases) and the structurally unrelated (nonionizable and acidic) compounds previously studied. IAM interaction values for LAs were predictive of the partition measures on liposome membranes already reported in literature. The half-blocking doses for closed sodium channel, corrected for ionization at pH 7.4, were successfully correlated with the respective IAM values for eleven compounds while procaine and tetracaine, which are ester-linked compounds and have a p-amino group as well, gave more potent results than predicted by phospholipid interactions.",

    "14": "We examined a family with autosomal-dominant hypertension and brachydactyly from northeastern Turkey. The hypertension was defined as severe, resulting in stroke before age 50 years, featuring normal renin, aldosterone, and catecholamine responses, and did not appear to be salt-sensitive. The responsible gene resides on chromosome 12p. To determine which medications were most effective, we performed a prospective clinical trial. We studied 13 affected individuals in a randomized double-blind, cross-over trial including a beta-blocker (BBL), alpha-blocker (ABL), calcium channel blocker (CCB), converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI), and hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) and placebo (PLA). We then added moxonidine (MOX) and continued the trial for an additional period in a single-blind fashion. Each drug was given for four weeks with an option to double the dose after two weeks; each washout period comprised two weeks. Blood, 24-hour urine, and saliva were studied at the outset, and blood and urine samples were obtained at the end of each phase. Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate measurements were with the patient ambulatory at 24 hours. All regimens required doubled doses at two weeks. Beta blocker, CCB, CEI, and ABL lowered BP (6 to 10 mm Hg) and BP load compared to PLA, while HCT and MOX did not. Converting enzyme inhibitor and HCT increased plasma renin activity (PRA), while BBL lowered PRA. The 24-hour urine analysis indicated a high dietary salt intake with a low potassium and calcium intake. The salivary electrolytes showed similar sodium and potassium concentrations, while chloride values were significantly higher in affected than nonaffected subjects. Thus, this monogenic form of hypertension resembles nonsalt-sensitive essential hypertension in that BBL, CCB, CEI, and ABL were effective, while HCT was not. The BP reduction was similar to other single drug trials in essential hypertension. The high salivary chloride values suggest an additional intermediary phenotype that may be related to electrolyte transport. These results raise the possibility that an as yet unknown hypertensive mechanism is operative in these subjects.", 
    "15": "kappa-PVIIA is a 27-residue polypeptide isolated from the venom of Conus purpurascens and is the first member of a new class of conotoxins that block potassium channels. By comparison to other ion channels of eukaryotic cell membranes, voltage-sensitive potassium channels are relatively simple and methodology has been developed for mapping their interactions with small-peptide toxins. PVIIA, therefore, is a valuable new probe of potassium channel structure. This study of the solution structure and mode of channel binding of PVIIA forms the basis for mapping the interacting residues at the conotoxin-ion channel interface.", 
    "16": "The three-dimensional structure of PVIIA resembles the triple-stranded beta sheet/cystine-knot motif formed by a number of toxic and inhibitory peptides. Subtle structural differences, predominantly in loops 2 and 4, are observed between PVIIA and other conotoxins with similar structural frameworks, however. Electrophysiological binding data suggest that PVIIA blocks channel currents by binding in a voltage-sensitive manner to the external vestibule and occluding the pore. Comparison of the electrostatic surface of PVIIA with that of the well-characterised potassium channel blocker charybdotoxin suggests a likely binding orientation for PVIIA.", 
    "17": "Although the structure of PVIIA is considerably different to that of the alphaK scorpion toxins, it has a similar mechanism of channel blockade. On the basis of a comparison of the structures of PVIIA and charybdotoxin, we suggest that Lys19 of PVIIA is the residue which is responsible for physically occluding the pore of the potassium channel.", 
    "18": "We examined the functional role of adrenergic receptor subtypes (ARs) in bovine intra-mammary arteries (IMAs), 1.5-2.5 mm internal diameter. Norepinephrine (NE) and phenylephrine (PE) produced concentration-dependent increases in tone in segments maintained at a previously determined optimal basal tension in vitro. The sensitivity of the tissue to NE and PE, based on -log molar ED50s was 6.87 +/- 0.17 and 7.05 +/- 0.35, respectively. In addition a Schild analysis yielded antagonist affinities for the receptor mediating contractile responses to NE (pA2 value) of 10.46 +/- 0.85 for prazosin and 6.29 +/- 0.18 for yohimbine. These data indicate a dominance of functional alpha 1 (alpha(1)) over alpha 2 (alpha(2))-ARS in this tissue. Based on the inhibitory effects of chloroethylclonidine (CEC) on PE responses and the further reduction in sensitivity when nifedipine was added to the CEC, also in the presence of PE, we conclude that there is more than one alpha(1)-AR subtype, with a predominant role for alpha(1B)-ARs in phenylephrine responses. Stimulation of beta (beta)-ARs, resulted in relatively small reductions in tone (the highest magnitude of response was 25.94 +/- 6.46% of the papaverine maximum at 3 x 10(-6) M isoproterenol); in addition, propranolol did not significantly alter tissue sensitivity to NE. Additional characterization of functional autonomic receptor populations in this circulatory bed will form a basis for future studies on circulatory dynamics in the mammary gland.", 
    "19": "We have altered the spontaneous contractile activity of neonatal cardiac myocytes in culture to investigate the re-lationship between mechanical forces, myofibril assembly, and the localization and translation of (alpha)-myosin heavy chain mRNA. Immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization techniques revealed that contracting myocytes display well aligned myofibrils and a diffuse distribution of (alpha)-myosin heavy chain mRNA. Inhibition of contractile activity with the calcium channel blocker verapamil (10 microM) resulted in myofibril disassembly and a perinuclear mRNA distribution within six hours. There was a significant decrease (P<0. 05) of mRNA levels, 5 to 15 micron away from the nucleus following 6 hours of verapamil treatment compared with control cells. Inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide (10 microM) also resulted in perinuclear mRNA localization despite having little effect on contractile activity or myofibril assembly. To determine if the 3' untranslated region of (alpha)-myosin heavy chain mRNA was sufficient for localizing the entire message, a chimeric construct composed of beta-galactosidase coding region followed by (alpha)-myosin heavy chain 3' untranslated region sequences was made as a reporter plasmid and transfected into cultured myocytes. A perinuclear accumulation of ss-galactosidase was exhibited in many of the contractile arrested cells (48.3+/-2.4%, n=7). In contrast, significantly fewer (P<0.05) contracting control (29.1+/-3.3%, n=7) and strongly contracting, isoproterenol-treated cells (27.2+/-6.1%, n=3) exhibited a perinuclear localization of protein. The distribution of the reporter protein was not affected by the contractile state in cells transfected with a constitutively translated 3'UTR. We propose that mechanical activity of neonatal cardiac myocytes regulates the intracellular localization of alpha-myosin heavy chain mRNA via the 3' untranslated region mediated by an initial block in translation.", 
    "20": "The effect of acute administrations of three doses of imipramine (1, 5 and 10 mg/kg s.c.), a widely used tricyclic antidepressant, on extracellular levels of serotonin (5-HT) has been studied by intracerebral microdialysis in raphe nuclei and prefrontal cortex of conscious rats. Imipramine 1 mg/kg s.c. did not change extracellular 5-HT in either raphe nuclei and prefrontal cortex. However, with the dose of 5 mg/kg s.c. imipramine induced in raphe nuclei, a brief increase of extracellular 5-HT followed by a lowering (55-65% basal release) of the neurotransmitter. The same dose of imipramine decreased (60-70% of basal value) extracellular 5-HT in prefrontal cortex. Imipramine 10 mg/kg s.c. significantly increased 5-HT levels in both raphe nuclei (190 +/- 20% above basal value) and prefrontal cortex (280 +/- 15% above basal value). Pretreatment with (-)pindolol (5 mg/kg s.c.), a non-selective 5-HT1A subtype receptor antagonist, 30 min before imipramine 5 mg/kg, modified the effect of the antidepressant: an increase, instead of a decrease, on prefrontal cortex dialysate 5-HT was observed. (-)Pindolol (10 mg/kg s.c.) increased extracellular 5-HT in both raphe nuclei (155 +/- 20% above basal value) and prefrontal cortex (160 +/- 8% above basal value). These data show that acute administration of imipramine modifies extracellular 5-HT at the level of the raphe nuclei and prefrontal cortex. 5-HT1A autoreceptors in the raphe nuclei, which this study suggests to be tonically active, may be stimulated after systemic administration of high doses of imipramine.", 
    "21": "Purified S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase from Dictyostelium discoideum or rabbit erythrocytes is inactivated when incubated with cAMP. The aim of this study was to investigate whether adrenaline, which increases cytosolic cAMP and calcium concentrations, is able to modify in situ the activity of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase in the heart. The enzyme was assayed in a crude extract obtained from superfused guinea-pig papillary muscles with the different tested substances. Adrenaline was found to inhibit S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase in papillary muscles in a concentration-dependent fashion. This inhibition was associated with an increase in the concentration of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (326%), and a decrease of adenosine (40%). beta-Adrenoceptors are involved in the effect of adrenaline, since isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic agonist, inhibited the enzyme, whereas the beta-adrenergic blocker, propranolol, prevented this inhibition. Participation of calcium in the inhibitory effect of adrenaline was suggested because the calcium channel blocker, verapamil, suppressed this inhibition, and high calcium in the perfusion medium inhibited the enzyme. In vitro experiments with calcium were performed in a semi-purified fraction of the enzyme, resulting in a concentration-dependent inhibition of the enzyme. Calcium concentration, which inhibited the enzyme 50%, was in the millimolar range for control and in the micromolar range for the obtained enzyme from adrenaline-treated muscles, indicating a different sensitivity to calcium inhibition. We conclude that adrenaline inhibits S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase in situ, probably by a calcium-modulated mechanism.", 
    "22": "Historically, catecholamine-producing chromaffin cells and steroid-producing adrenocortical cells have been regarded as two independent endocrine systems that are united under a common capsule to form the adrenal gland. There is increasing evidence for bidirectional interactions, with regulatory influences of adrenocortical secretory products on adrenomedullary functions and vice versa. However, the direct involvement of chromaffin cells on the regulation and maintenance of cortical function has not yet been demonstrated. Therefore, we analyzed glucocorticoid secretion and P450 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in bovine adrenocortical cells in cocultures with chromaffin cells compared with those in pure cortical cell cultures. Cortisol release from cortical cells in coculture with chromaffin cells was 10 times as high (mean +/- SEM, 1035 +/- 119%) as that from the same number of isolated cortical cells (100 +/- 11%). By a [3H]thymidine incorporation assay, it was demonstrated that this effect was not due to a higher proliferation rate. Northern analysis revealed an increasing expression of P450(17alpha) mRNA in the coculture from days 1-5, whereas in isolated cortical cells, P450(17alpha) mRNA decreased, leading to a 6-fold difference on day 5. Inhibitors of protein (cycloheximide) or RNA (actinomycin D) synthesis completely annulled the observed increase in cortisol release, indicating that de novo protein synthesis is required for this activation of adrenocortical steroidogenesis. Addition of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin reduced the stimulatory effect, suggesting that this stimulation is in part mediated by PGs. Locally produced ACTH, catecholamines, and interleukin-1 accounted for 43% of the effect. Secretory products of chromaffin cells that act in concert are believed to be responsible for the stimulation of steroidogenesis in the coculture. The coculture system is an in vitro model that corresponds to the in vivo situation in the intact adrenal gland, where both endocrine cell systems are in close contact. Our data demonstrate the requirement of intraadrenal cellular communication for the full strength of the adrenocortical hormonal response.", 
    "23": "The muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist scopolamine, but not the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol or atenolol, suppressed tetanus-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) of population spikes in the rat hippocampal CA1 region. When scopolamine was coapplied with propranolol or atenolol, a synergistic effect in preventing LTP generation was observed. On the other hand, the coapplication of scopolamine and atenolol failed to affect tetanus-induced LTP of field EPSP. These findings suggest that cooperative mechanisms via muscarinic and beta-adrenergic receptor activation might contribute to LTP induction in terms of the EPSP-spike potentiation, i.e., an increase in the excitability of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells after tetanic stimulation, but are independent of the tetanus-evoked potentiation of a synaptic component.", 
    "24": "Electrical stimulation of the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) produced orthodromic excitation (n = 28, 15%) and inhibition (n = 6, 4%) of the activity of neurons in the subfornical organ (SFO) in male rats under urethane anesthesia. Almost all (n = 26) of the excitatory responses (n = 28) were blocked by microiontophoretically applied phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, but not by timolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist. In contrast, the inhibitory response of all the neurons (n = 6) tested was not affected by either phentolamine or timolol. Approximately two-third (n = 19) of SFO neurons that demonstrated the excitatory response to NTS stimulation exhibited an increase in neuronal activity in response to hemorrhage (10 ml/kg b.w.t.). Hemorrhage did not cause any change in the activity of all the neurons that demonstrated the inhibitory response to NTS stimulation. These results suggest that the excitatory pathways from the NTS to the SFO may transmit the peripheral baroreceptor information through alpha-adrenoreceptor mechanisms.", 
    "25": "Primary cultures of neurons from chick embryo telencephalons were deprived of serum to induce apoptotic cell death. After 24 h of serum withdrawal, we found a reduction in cell viability from 85% to 72% and an increase in the number of apoptotic cells from 12% to 29%. The 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT inhibited the decrease in cell viability and reduced the number of apoptotic cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The anti-apoptotic effect of 8-OH-DPAT (1 microM) could be blocked by adding the selective 5-HT1A antagonist MPPI (10 microM), but not in the presence of the dopamine receptor antagonist chlorpromazine (1 microM) and of the beta-receptor blocker propranolol (10 microM). In addition, anti-nerve growth factor (NGF) antibodies inhibited the protective effect of 8-OH-DPAT, suggesting that induction of NGF was involved in the mechanism of action. Serum deprivation alone already induced a release of NGF (10 pg/flask) which protected the neurons from further cell death. Accordingly, the addition of the same amount of exogenous NGF restored cell viability up to control level and addition of anti-NGF antibodies further decreased cell viability to 56%. In the presence of 8-OH-DPAT (1 microM), the level of NGF in the culture medium was only slightly yet consistently increased compared to serum deprivation from 4 h onwards. Thus, our data suggest that the anti-apoptotic effect of 8-OH-DPAT is mediated by the stimulation of 5-HT1A receptors. Furthermore, the induction of neuronal NGF synthesis and secretion contributes to its neuroprotective action.", 
    "26": "The toxic interaction between disopyramide and propranolol were studied in chick embryos. Fertilized eggs of White Leghorns were incubated and investigated. Disopyramide with and without propranolol was injected into the air sac of a fertilized egg on the 16th day of incubation. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) were recorded 0 to 60 min after the injection. After each drug injection alone, the heart rate was not different compared with control. However, the heart rate was significantly decreased by combination with disopyramide and propranolol. In addition, arrhythmia was produced by disopyramide 1.0 mg/egg alone and in combination with propranolol. These findings indicate that the interaction between disopyramide and propranolol has a marked influence on the heart rate in chick embryos.", 
    "27": "Radioisotopic and electrophysiological techniques were used to assess the effects of verapamil, a phenylalkylamine Ca2+ channel blocker, on K+ permeability of insulin-secreting cells. Verapamil provoked a concentration-dependent inhibition of 86Rb (42K substitute) outflow from prelabelled and perifused rat pancreatic islets. This property appears to be inherent to the phenylalkylamine Ca2+ channel blockers since gallopamil, a methoxyderivative of verapamil, but not nifedipine, a 1,4-dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel blocker, inhibited 86Rb outflow. The experimental data further revealed that verapamil interacted with a Ca2+-independent, glucose- and glibenclamide-sensitive modality of 86Rb extrusion. Moreover, verapamil prevented the increase in 86Rb outflow brought about by BPDZ 44; a potent activator of the ATP-sensitive K+ channel. Single-channel current recordings by the patch clamp technique confirmed that verapamil elicited a dose-dependent inhibition of the ATP-dependent K+ channel. Lastly, under experimental conditions in which verapamil clearly inhibited the ATP-sensitive K+ channels, the drug did not affect 45Ca outflow, the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration or insulin release. It is concluded that the Ca2+ entry blocker verapamil inhibits ATP-sensitive K+ channels in pancreatic beta cells. This effect was not associated with stimulation of insulin release.", 
    "28": "Perioperative myocardial ischemia occurs in 20-40% of patients at risk for cardiac complications and is associated with a ninefold increase in risk for perioperative cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or unstable angina, and a twofold long-term risk. Perioperative atenolol administration reduces the risk of death for as long as 2 yr after surgery. This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial tested the hypothesis that perioperative atenolol administration reduces the incidence and severity of perioperative myocardial ischemia, potentially explaining the observed reduction in the risk for death.", 
    "29": "Two-hundred patients with, or at risk for, coronary artery disease were randomized to two study groups (atenolol and placebo). Monitoring included a preoperative history and physical examination and daily assessment of any adverse events. Twelve-lead electrocardiography (ECG), three-lead Holter ECG, and creatinine phosphokinase with myocardial banding (CPK with MB) data were collected 24 h before until 7 days after surgery. Atenolol (0, 5, or 10 mg) or placebo was administered intravenously before induction of anesthesia and every 12 h after operation until the patient could take oral medications. Atenolol (0, 50, or 100 mg) was administered orally once a day as specified by blood pressure and heart rate.",

    "32": "Three methods are described for the simultaneous determination of nifedipine and acebutolol hydrochloride in combined pharmaceutical tablets. The first method depends on first-derivative ultraviolet spectrophotometry, with peak-to-base and zero-crossing measurements methods. The first derivative amplitudes at 400 and 352 nm were selected for the assay of nifedipine and acebutolol hydrochloride, respectively. Calibration graphs follow Beer's law in the range of 4-12 and 44-132 micrograms ml-1 and the linearity was satisfactory (r = 0.999) for nifedipine and acebutolol hydrochloride, respectively. The second method was based on the separation of nifedipine from acebutolol hydrochloride, with an internal standard thymolphthalein, using capillary gas-liquid chromatography with a programmable temperature change. The third method was based on high performance liquid chromatographic separation of the two drugs on a reversed-phase, C18, column using a mobile phase of methanol-water (55:45, pH 4.5) with a programmable flow rate of 1 ml min-1 for 4 min which changed to 2 ml min-1 for the rest of the run. The detection was done at 260 nm using oxprenolol hydrochloride as an internal standard. Both chromatographic methods showed good linearity, precision and reproducibility. No spectral or chromatographic interference from the tablet excipients were found. The proposed methods were successfully applied to the assay of commercial tablets and a content uniformity test. The procedures were rapid, simple nondestructive and suitable for quality control application.", 
    "33": "In patients with essential hyperhidrosis (EH), a pathological condition characterized by increased activity of the upper dorsal sympathetic ganglia D2-D3, anatomical interruption at the D2-D3 level by thoracoscopic sympathicolysis (TS) is a safe and effective treatment. The D2 and D3 ganglia, however, are also in the pathway of sympathetic lung innervation, which may influence the pulmonary diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (expressed as transfer factor for CO:TLCO, and as transfer coefficient for CO:KCO). We therefore studied the effect of TS on TLCO and KCO in 50 EH patients: compared with pre-operative values, both TLCO (-6.7%, P < 0.001) and KCO (-4.2%, P = 0.002) were significantly decreased at 6 weeks after bilateral TS, an effect which was independent of the smoking status of the patients. In order to explain this phenomenon, the following pharmacological interventions were studied: (1) oral beta 1 + 2-adrenoreceptor blockade with propranolol caused a comparable decrease of TLCO (-6.3%) and KCO (-7.5%) in matched normal subjects, but had no effect on TLCO and KCO in EH patients prior to TS; and (2) subsequent inhalation of the beta 2-adrenoreceptor agonist salbutamol in a dosage suspected to cause alveolar beta-receptor stimulation had no effect on TLCO and KCO, neither in the normal subjects, nor in EH patients (before and after TS). Although the exact mechanism of the TS-induced decrease in TLCO and KCO remains speculative, these findings suggest that they may be related to a beta 1-adrenoreceptor-mediated change in pulmonary capillary membrane permeability, although TS-induced changes in pulmonary blood flow or an interplay of both mechanisms cannot be excluded.", 
    "34": "The involvement of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC) and D (PC-PLD) in the regulation of the thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ increase was investigated. Pretreatment of human lymphocytes with the PC-PLC inhibitors D609 or U73122 enhanced the thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ influx. By contrast, no effect was observed in the presence of phospholipase D inhibitor butanol. Addition of exogenous PC-PLC but not PC-PLD to lymphocytes prestimulated with thapsigargin led to a decrease of intracellular Ca2+. In addition, thapsigargin was shown to release diacylglycerol (DAG) from cellular phosphatidylcholine pools. The thapsigargin-induced DAG formation was inhibited by U73122 and D609 but not by butanol. Moreover, no formation of the PC-PLD activity marker phosphatidylbutanol was detected. Thapsigargin-induced DAG formation was dependent on the Ca2+ entry, as it was abolished in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ or in the presence of Ni2+. Further investigations demonstrated that the inhibition of the cellular DAG target, protein kinase C (PKC), enhanced thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ increase, whereas direct PKC activation had an inhibitory effect. Taken together, our results reveal the involvement of PC-PLC in the regulation of the thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ increase and point to the existence of a physiologic feedback mechanism activated by Ca2+ influx and acting via consecutive activation of PC-PLC and PKC to limit the rise of intracellular Ca2+.",

Irrespective of whether the selective beta3-, beta2-, and beta1-agonists BRL 37344, salbutamol, and dobutamine or the physiological agonist norepinephrine was used to stimulate the cells, increases in cAMP levels were mediated via the beta3-receptor, as were the thermogenic effects. However, the relationship \"thermogenesis per cAMP\" was much lower for agents other than norepinephrine. Similarly, forskolin, although more potent than norepinephrine in elevating cAMP, was less potent in inducing thermogenesis. The selective alpha1-agonist cirazoline was in itself without effect on cAMP levels or thermogenesis, but when added to forskolin-stimulated cells, potentiated thermogenesis, up to the norepinephrine level, without affecting cAMP. This potentiation could not be inhibited by chelerythrine, but could be mimicked by Ca2+ ionophores. It was apparently not mediated via calmodulin-dependent protein kinase and was not an effect on mitochondrial respiratory control. The ability of all cAMP-elevating agents to induce thermogenesis in brown fat cells has earlier been interpreted to mean that it is only through the beta-receptors and the resulting increase in cAMP levels that thermogenesis is induced. However, it is here concluded that the thermogenic response to norepinephrine involves two interacting parts, one mediated via beta-receptors and cAMP and the other via alpha1-receptors and increases in cytosolic Ca2+ levels.", 
    "36": "The nonspecific, noncovalent binding of three drugs, imipramine, warfarin, and propranolol, to pooled human and animal liver microsomes has been determined using equilibrium dialysis in conditions where no cofactor (NADPH) was included in the incubation. The binding of warfarin was dependent upon both protein and drug concentration, whereas the binding of propranolol and imipramine was also dependent upon protein concentration but generally independent of drug concentration. At a microsomal protein concentration of 1.0 mg/ml and a warfarin concentration of 10 microM, the free fraction (fu(mic)) was 0.85. The corresponding values for propranolol and imipramine were 0.41 and 0.16, respectively. Thus, although all three drugs exhibit high binding in plasma (fu<0.1) the acidic drug warfarin differs from the basic drugs propranolol and imipramine in the extent to which each binds to microsomal protein. The binding of all three drugs to liver microsomes obtained from commonly studied animal species (rat, dog, and monkey) was almost identical to that observed in human. Additionally, the binding of warfarin and propranolol to microsomes obtained from insect cells used in baculovirus cytochrome P450 expression systems was similar to that exhibited in liver microsomes, when equal protein concentrations were compared. The enzyme kinetics of propranolol, imipramine, and warfarin oxidative metabolism were determined in pooled human liver microsomes, and the intrinsic clearance values obtained were used in scaling up to project human in vivo clearance. The values obtained by incorporating microsomal binding were compared with those in which this factor is ignored. The findings suggest that the parameter fu(mic) is important to obtain when attempting to relate in vitro intrinsic clearance to in vivo clearance. Also, this value is important to consider when comparing substrates with respect to enzyme specificity, since measured apparent KM values should be converted to true \"free KM\" values by correcting for the free fraction in the in vitro incubation. Furthermore, the extent of nonspecific binding to microsomes is likely an important parameter to consider when attempting to relate Ki values measured in vitro to observations of drug-drug interactions (or the lack thereof) in vivo.",

Tissue maximum was defined as the force increase to 127 mmol/L KCl plus arginine vasopressin (1 microm). All arteries dilated well to acetylcholine. Possible explanations for the PA marginal neurogenic responses were assessed. NE ED50 was 5.4+/-2.2 X 10(-7) mol/L and did not vary with age or diameter. NE responsiveness did not increase in vessels with spontaneous or raised potassium-induced tone. Relaxation to isoproterenol was variable and propranolol did not increase the neurogenic response. Neither N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine, N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, endothelium removal, nor indomethacin consistently influenced the contractions to NE or neurogenic reactivity. The weak PA neurogenic response is in keeping with its poor innervation. As determined by catecholamine histofluorescence, innervation in the PA is sparse, with density increasing in the order PA, MMA, and STA. The incidence of nerve structures in the PA adventitio-medial junction was only 3% of those in the STA, and these were situated more than 3 microm from the closest smooth muscle cell.",

    "47": "Although beta-adrenoceptor agonists are primary agents in therapy of asthma, epidemiological studies have suggested that frequent or prolonged used of these drugs could be associated with exacerbation of disease. Mechanisms of any adverse effects remain unclear although in vitro studies have suggested that beta-adrenoceptor agonists can block glucocorticoid actions. Because asthma is an inflammatory disease characterized by eosinophil infiltration of the airways, actions of beta-agonists and corticosteroids that alter eosinophil survival and mediator generation may be of importance. Eosinophil generation of superoxide anion, a potent mediator that can damage respiratory epithelium, was markedly increased after 2-24 h of in vitro beta-adrenoceptor agonist exposure. These proinflammatory effects are in contrast to inhibition of superoxide generation, which is observed with acute beta-agonist exposure. Corticosteroid treatment to reduce inflammation is combined with beta-agonist therapy in current asthma guidelines. Although dexamethasone independently decreased eosinophil superoxide anion generation, in the presence of beta-adrenoceptor agonist dexamethasone inhibition was minimal and not statistically significant. Eosinophil survival is a relevant factor to pulmonary inflammation. Although beta-adrenoceptor agonists did not independently increase eosinophil survival, glucocorticoid actions that increase apoptosis were blocked. Thus, in vitro beta-agonists can independently increase inflammatory mediator generation and block anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroid.", 
    "48": "Environmental circumstances during the neonatal period are critical for the establishment of adult responses to stressful environmental situations. As these responses are underpinned by adaptations in the functioning of brain neurotransmitter systems, the present study was designed to assess the mediation of noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems in the long-lasting effects of neonatal handling on both emotionality and learned helplessness behaviour. Animals received either prazosin, propranolol, haloperidol or saline before infantile handling. When the animals were 2 months old, they were subjected first to an open field test and then to the learned helplessness paradigm. Non-treated handled animals exhibited lower emotional reactivity and reduced susceptibility to helplessness compared to non-treated non-handled rats. The results suggest that noradrenergic, but not D2-dopamine receptor systems mediate the influence of neonatal handling on the acquisition of learned helplessness in the adult. Only beta-adrenoceptors appear to play a role in emotional responsiveness.", 
    "49": "Angiotension converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers have been reported to possess disparate effects on insulin sensitivity. The aim of this study was to study the effects of the selective beta-1 blocker bisoprolol and of the ACE inhibitor captopril on cellular insulin action in hypertensive individuals. After washout, 12 mild to moderate essential hypertensives were randomized in a double-blind manner to 5 mg bisoprolol daily or 25 mg captopril twice daily for 8 weeks. Erythrocyte insulin binding and insulin-stimulated tyrosine kinase (TK) activity were measured before and after therapy. Both agents decreased diastolic blood pressure significantly (bisoprolol 96.5+/-0.9 to 87.8+/-3.1 mm Hg; captopril 96.5+/-0.9 to 91.5+/-1.8 mm Hg; P < .05). Fasting plasma glucose, insulin, and insulin/glucose indices remained unchanged after both therapies, as did lipid profiles. Maximal insulin-stimulated TK activity, assessed by phosphorylation of the exogenous substrate poly-Glu80Tyr20, was significantly higher (P < .05) after bisoprolol treatment, but not after captopril treatment, when compared to placebo (bisoprolol 8.5+/-1.8; captopril 7.3+/-1.5; placebo: 6.4+/-1.3 pmol 32P-ATP/fmol bound insulin). However, captopril, but not bisoprolol, increased the sensitivity of the receptor TK activity, as measured by the half-maximal activity concentration (ED50). Specific insulin binding was not affected by these two agents. Thus, both captopril and bisoprolol may have favorable but different effects on TK activity and insulin action at the cellular level.",

Successful treatment slowed average acceleration of left ventricular ejection by 34% (P=.001). Mean time to peak velocity in the left ventricle was prolonged 31% (P=.001). Mean time to an ejection velocity of 60 cm/s was prolonged 91% (P=.001). Before treatment, left ventricular ejection velocity peaked in the first half of systole; after successful treatment, it peaked in the second half (P=.001). In contrast, after treatment, we found no change in peak left ventricular ejection velocity.

Because our previous studies had characterized/verified procedures to determine pressure-derived indices of contractile function in the anesthetized, ventilated, open-chest rat, we first correlated PFV with (a) maximum rate of left ventricular pressure development (max +dP/dt) and (b) a contractility index derived by dividing max +dP/dt by left ventricular pressure at max +dP/dt [(dP/dt)/P] in anesthetized rats (n = 5). The positive inotropic agent, isoproterenol, given by bolus intravenous injection (0.2 microgram), significantly and concurrently increased dP/dt, (dP/dt)/P, and PFV. The negative inotropic agent, propranolol, given by bolus intravenous injection (2 mg/kg), significantly and concurrently attenuated all of the above measurements. When control, isoproterenol, and propranolol responses were used to calculate multivariate correlation coefficients among dP/dt, (dP/dt)/P, and PFV, r values ranged from 0.74 (PFV vs. dP/dt) to 0.84 (dP/dt vs. (dP/dt)/P) to 0.91 (PFV vs. (dP/dt)/P). A separate group of rats (n = 4) was surgically implanted with ascending aortic blood flow sensors, carotid artery and jugular vein catheters. Intravenous isoproterenol (0.2 microgram, bolus) elicited increased cardiac (heart rate and cardiac output) and decreased peripheral vascular resistance (mean arterial blood pressure) beta-adrenergic receptor agonist effects. Propranolol (2 mg/kg, i.v. bolus) produced hemodynamic effects consistent with cardiovascular beta-adrenergic receptor blockade. Isoproterenol and propranolol had directionally appropriate, and significant effects on PFV in the conscious rat. When compared with PFV values under control conditions in the anesthetized rat, conscious rat values are approximately double those observed under anesthesia; however, the relative PFV responses to isoproterenol and propranolol were not affected. Therefore, the present studies provide evidence that aortic PFV can be utilized as an estimate of heart contractile performance, i.e., myocardial contractility, in the conscious, instrumented rat.", 
    "61": "The purpose of this study was to morphologically assess a possible mechanism for caffeine-induced ocular hypertension. Taking into consideration the relationship between the secretion of aqueous humor and the ultrastructure of the ciliary body, the time course of the morphological features in the ciliary epithelium when caffeine was administered intravenously to male Wistar rats was investigated by electron-microscopy. These morphological findings were also compared with the changes in the intraocular pressure (IOP). A significant increase in IOP was noted 15 min and 1 hr after a single dosing of caffeine alone. This change disappeared in all animals within 2 hr after dosing. The IOP in the animals receiving caffeine and the beta-blocker befunolol, which lowers the IOP by inhibiting aqueous humor secretion, decreased significantly from 15 min after dosing, and this change persisted 2 hr after dosing. In electron-microscopy 15 min and/or 1 hr after dosing with caffeine, a slight dilatation in the lateral intercellular spaces near the basement membrane of the non-pigmented ciliary epithelium was observed and the interdigitations between the non-pigmented epithelial cells were intact. Reversal of these changes was observed 2 hr after dosing. On the other hand, the lateral intercellular spaces between the non-pigmented epithelial cells were markedly dilated and the interdigitations were disorganized following dosing with caffeine alone and in combination with befunolol. These results described here indicate that the intravenous administration of caffeine causes ocular hypertension and also changes in the non-pigmented ciliary epithelium, suggesting an enhancement of aqueous humor transportation. This paradigm in the rat is considered to be useful to further assess caffeine-induced ocular hypertension and for use as an animal model in glaucoma research associated with an aqueous humor secretion.", 
    "62": "To examine the role of glutamatergic signaling in the function of pancreatic islets, we have characterized a high affinity glutamate/aspartate uptake system in this tissue. The islet [3H]glutamate uptake activity was Na(+)-dependent, and it was blocked by L-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid, a blocker of neuronal and glial glutamate transporters. Islet glutamate transport activity exhibited a Vmax of 8.48 +/- 1.47 fmol/min/islet (n = 4), which corresponds to 102.2 +/- 17.7 pmol/min/mg islet protein. The apparent Km of islet glutamate transport activity depended on the glucose concentration used in the assay. In the presence of glucose concentrations that do not stimulate insulin secretion (2.8 mM), the apparent Km was 34.7 +/- 7.8 microM (n = 3). However, in high glucose (16.7 mM) the apparent Km increased to 112.7 +/- 16.5 microM (n = 3) with little or no change in Vmax. Like most known plasma membrane glutamate transporters, islet glutamate transporters also transported D-aspartate. Anti-D-aspartate immunoreactivity showed that the islet glutamate/aspartate transport activity was localized to the non-beta cell islet mantle. In perifusion experiments with isolated islets in the absence of exogenous amino acids, L-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid in the presence of 8.3 mM glucose potentiated insulin secretion 23.3 +/- 2.3% (n = 3) compared with 8.3 mM glucose alone. This effect was abolished in the presence of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid receptor antagonist, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione. Furthermore, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione alone inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in isolated islets by 15.9 +/- 5.9% (n = 3). Taken together these data suggest that a high affinity glutamate transport system exists in pancreatic islets and that this system contributes to a glutamatergic signaling pathway that can modulate glucose-inducible insulin secretion.",

    "71": "Although hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is genetically determined, several other factors, including autonomic dysfunction, may play a role in the phenotypic expression. A recent study using positron emission tomography with [11C]CGP 12177 ([11C]CGP) demonstrated that beta-adrenoceptor (betaAR) density is reduced in HCM and is correlated with disease progression. This present study tested the hypothesis that this downregulation is associated with reduced catecholamine reuptake (uptake 1) by myocardial sympathetic nerve terminals leading to increased local norepinephrine concentration. Myocardial presynaptic catecholamine reuptake was assessed by measuring the volume of distribution (Vd) of the catecholamine analogue [11C]hydroxyephedrine ([11C]HED) in 9 unrelated HCM patients aged 45+/-15 years. The maximum number of binding sites (Bmax) for myocardial betaAR density was measured in 13 unrelated HCM patients aged 40+/-12 years using the nonselective beta blocker [11C]CGP. Six patients were studied with both [11C]HED and [11C]CGP. Comparison was made with two groups of healthy control subjects for each ligand ([11C]HED, n=10, aged 35+/-8 years; [11C]CGP, n=19, aged 44+/-16 years). Myocardial Vd of [11C]HED (33.4+/-4.3 mL/g tissue) and betaAR density (7.3+/-2.6 pmol/g tissue) were significantly reduced in HCM patients compared with control subjects (71.0+/-18.8 mL/g tissue, P<.001, and 10.2+/-2.9 pmol/g tissue, P=.008, respectively). These results are consistent with our hypothesis that myocardial betaAR downregulation in HCM is associated with an impaired uptake-1 mechanism and hence increased local catecholamine levels.", 
    "72": "The aim of this study was to investigate in vitro the pharmacologic properties of rabbit esophageal muscularis mucosae. Stimulation of its motor innervation elicited only atropine-sensitive excitatory responses. This tissue was not refractory to histamine but appeared to be rapidly desensitized to its effects. Responses to adrenoreceptor agonists were produced by excitatory alpha1 and beta1 adrenoreceptors, inhibitory beta3 receptors but not alpha2 receptors. The esophageal muscularis mucosae was only weakly stimulated by neurokinins and bradykinin, and these responses were mediated via NK2, NK3, B1, and B2 receptors, respectively. Adenosine diphosphate and adenosine triphosphate produced approximately 40% maximal contractions through the activation of P2 receptors, whereas adenosine monophosphate and adenosine were without effect. Responses to prostaglandins E2 and F2alpha were < or =10% of the tissues' maximum response to acetylcholine. These data demonstrate that rabbit esophageal muscularis mucosae has a simple excitatory innervation and is only weakly stimulated by a variety of pharmacologic agents. For these reasons it is distinct from muscularis mucosae found elsewhere in the rabbit gastrointestinal tract.",

    "77": "Harmaline, a beta-carboline derivative, is known to produce tremor through a direct activation of cells in the inferior olive. However, the receptor(s) through which harmaline acts remains unknown. It was recently reported that the tremorogenic actions of harmaline could be blocked by the noncompetitive NMDA channel blocker, MK-801. This study examined whether the blockade of harmaline's action, in the rabbit, by MK-801 was due to a pharmacological antagonism at the MK-801 binding site. This was accomplished by measurement of [3H]MK-801 binding in membrane fractions derived from tissue containing the inferior olivary nucleus and from cerebral cortex. Harmaline completely displaced saturable [3H]MK-801 binding in both the inferior olive and cortex with apparent IC50 values of 60 and 170 microM, respectively. These IC50 values are consistent with the high doses of harmaline required to produce tremor, e.g., 10-30 mg/kg. Non-linear curve fitting analysis of [3H]MK-801 saturation experiments indicated that [3H]MK-801 bound to a single site and that harmaline's displacement of [3H]MK-801 binding to the NMDA receptor was competitive as indicated by a shift in Kd but not in Bmax. In addition, a Schild plot gave a slope that was not significantly different from 1 indicating that harmaline was producing a displacement of [3H]MK-801 from its binding site within the NMDA cation channel and not through an action at the glutamate or other allosteric sites on the NMDA receptor. These findings provide in vitro evidence that the competitive blockade of harmaline-induced tremor by MK-801 occurs within the calcium channel coupled to the NMDA receptor. Our hypothesis is that harmaline produces tremor by acting as an inverse agonist at the MK-801 binding site and thus opening the cation channel.", 
    "78": "Serotonin (1-40 microM) reduced input resistance by 20.6 +/- 6% and hyperpolarized stellate and pyramidal neurons of layers two and three of the lateral entorhinal cortex. 5-Carboxamidotryptamine, a 5-HT1 agonist, and the selective 5-HT1A agonist 8-hydroxy-dipropylaminotetralin mimicked the action of serotonin. The reversal potential of 5-HT-mediated hyperpolarizations was sensitive to the extracellular K+ concentration, indicating a potassium conductance change. Serotonin treatment suppressed excitatory amino acid-mediated synaptic potentials (by 48%, Kd = 6.9 microM) and responses to exogenously applied glutamate (70.1 +/- 17% of control, n = 7), but did not alter paired-pulse facilitation, indicating a postsynaptic site of action. Intracellular application of QX-314, a blocker of potassium conductance, significantly reduced depression of synaptic potentials by 5-HT agonists. In cells filled with QX-314, responses to exogenously applied glutamate were not reduced by serotonin or 5-carboxamidotryptamine application. These results indicate that the observed conductance increase associated with 5-HT application accounts for most if not all of the observed depressant effects of 5-HT1A agonists on excitatory amino acid-mediated neurotransmission.", 
    "79": "A rat blood pressure assay was used to perform a structure-activity relationship study (SAR) of Leu-Val-Val-hemorphin-7 (LVV-H7), a fragment of hemoglobin (Hb) beta-chain, elucidate the mechanisms of its cardiovascular effects, and test its potential involvement in the pressor activity of diaspirin crosslinked Hb (DCLHb), a recently developed Hb-based oxygen carrier. The SAR study revealed that the C-terminal-Arg-Phe-amino acid sequence of LVV-H7 contained the main determinants of the pressor activity of this peptide. Drug interaction studies using various inhibitory drugs (e.g., phentolamine, clonidine, etc.) and LVV-H7 showed that the pressor effect and tachycardia elicited by LVV-H7 involved the activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Additional studies using phenytoin (sodium channel blocker), [Tic7]H7(5-7)-NH2 (putative antagonist of receptors for LVV-H7) and H7(5-7)-NH2, an amidated C-terminal fragment of LVV-H7, suggested that LVV-H7 activated the SNS by interacting with specific receptors functionally coupled with phenytoin-sensitive sodium channels. The pressor effect and tachycardia caused by LVV-H7 were potentiated by captopril, suggesting that the angiotensin converting enzyme may contribute to the inactivation of LVV-H7 in rats. The pressor activity of DCLHb, in contrast to that elicited by LVV-H7, was not affected by animal pretreatment with LVV-H7 fragments shown to inhibit the pressor effect of LVV-H7. We conclude that: 1) LVV-H7 is unlikely to mediate the pressor activity of DCLHb in rats; 2) the pressor and tachycardic activities of LVV-H7 are mediated by the SNS; 3) the C-terminal-Arg-Phe-amino acid sequence of LVV-H7 contains the chemical groups responsible for the pressor effect of this peptide in rats; 4) LVV-H7 and FMRF amide-related peptides may share the same mechanism of pressor activity in rats.", 
    "80": "Our objective was to investigate the effects of alpha1- or beta-adrenoceptor blockers on endocardial and epicardial refractory-period changes during myocardial ischemia in alpha-chloralose-anesthetized dogs. The first and second diagonal branches of the left anterior descending coronary artery were ligated. The refractory period was determined by an S1-S2 extrastimulus method. Dogs were treated with the alpha1-blocker bunazosin (0.1-0.2 mg/kg, i.v.; n = 16), the beta-blocker propranolol (0.2 mg/kg, i.v.; n = 15), or saline (n = 11). Dogs that developed ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF) during the experiment were excluded from the statistical assessment in refractory periods. In all groups, coronary ligation produced a significant shortening of the refractory period of ischemic epicardial tissue (p < 0.05) but only minimal shortening of ischemic endocardial refractory periods, resulting in an increased difference in repolarization time between the endo- and epicardial sites. Treatment with bunazosin ameliorated this ischemia-related shortening of refractory periods at both the endo- and epicardial sites, with a greater effect seen epicardially (p < 0.05), resulting in values similar to those in the nonischemic tissue. Treatment with propranolol prolonged refractory periods more in the epicardial (p < 0.01) than in endocardial sites, exacerbating the disparity in the refractory period between the endo- and epicardial sites (p < 0.05). Propranolol also prolonged the refractory period of nonischemic tissue (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01 in endo- and epicardial sites, respectively), resulting in a significant difference between the ischemic and normal myocardium at the endocardial site (p < 0.05). Results suggest that the alpha1-blocker bunazosin reduces the refractory-period disparity between the ischemic and normal myocardium without increasing the disparity between the endo- and epicardial surfaces, whereas propranolol produces a greater disparity.", 
    "81": "The influence of celiprolol (beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptor partial agonist), propranolol (beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist), and atenolol (beta1-adrenoceptor antagonist) on heart-rate variability (HRV) was assessed from Holter records in 12 normal volunteers. A combination of summary statistics and nonlinear procedures was used to assess HRV and autonomic balance. Under double-blind and randomised conditions (Latin-square design), subjects received placebo, celiprolol (200 and 800 mg), propranolol (160 mg), atenolol (50 mg), and combinations of these agents. Single oral doses of medication (at weekly intervals) were administered at 22:30 h with sleeping heart rates (HRs) recorded overnight. Compared with placebo, celiprolol (200 and 800 mg) increased the sleeping HR, the HR effect of celiprolol was different from the bradycardia after propranolol, 160 mg, and atenolol, 50 mg. Dose-response effects on HR with celiprolol were evident in the presence of atenolol, unlike those with propranolol that abolished the HR increase between celiprolol, 200 mg and 800 mg. These data were consistent with beta1-selective adrenoceptor agonism with 200 mg but agonism at both the beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptor with celiprolol, 800 mg. The action of the drugs on short-term HRV indices (rMSSD and pNN50) closely followed their effects on HR. The longer-term HRV indices (global SD, SDANN) were reduced by celiprolol but increased by propranolol and atenolol. At a fixed HR, the data dispersion (SDNN5) was higher with propranolol compared with celiprolol; however, the dispersion was not merely an HR-dependent phenomenon. A novel nonlinear approach (quadrant analysis) revealed the sequencing of cardiac accelerations and decelerations after the high correlation between adjacent intervals had been removed. Celiprolol increased the frequency of consecutive cardiac accelerations; the duration between and variance of these beat-to-beat differences shortened after celiprolol but lengthened with increased variance after propranolol and atenolol. These results demonstrated reduced HRV indices and a shift toward sympathetic dominance after the beta-adrenoceptor agonist celiprolol contrasting with increased HRV indices and parasympathetic dominance after the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists propranolol and atenolol. The implications of these findings for the treatment of patients with cardiovascular disease warrant further study.", 
    "82": "In the transplanted human heart, beta-adrenoceptor subtypes change with time after transplantation: beta1-adrenoceptors tend to decline, whereas beta2-adrenoceptors are upregulated. The aim of this study was to determine whether, in the transplanted human heart, stimulation of beta2-adrenoceptors can induce heart-rate increases. For this purpose, we assessed in eight heart-transplant recipients (mean posttransplant time: 932 days) the effects of infusion of graded doses of isoprenaline (3.5-35 ng/kg/min) 120 min after pretreatment with the beta1-adrenoceptor antagonist bisoprolol (10 mg p.o.; beta1-adrenoceptor occupancy approximately 80%; beta2-adrenoceptor occupancy <5%) on heart rate in the recipient's native (innervated) and transplanted (denervated) sinus nodes. Isoprenaline, acting under these conditions predominantly at beta2-adrenoceptors, increased heart rate both in the recipient's transplanted and native sinus nodes in a dose-dependent manner; at each dose, increases were significantly higher in the transplanted than in the native sinus node. ED20 values (dose to increase heart rate by 20 beats/min) in the transplanted sinus node were 22.2 +/- 1.8 ng/kg/min, and in the native, >35 ng/kg/min (p < 0.01). We conclude that in the transplanted human heart, beta2-adrenoceptor stimulation does evoke increases in heart rate. The enhanced response to isoprenaline in the transplanted sinus node could be caused by the upregulated beta2-adrenoceptors or by the fact that during isoprenaline infusion, vagal activity increases, thus blunting the response in the native (innervated) but not in the transplanted (denervated) sinus node.", 
    "83": "Extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) plays an important role in the regulation of endothelial function. However, its receptors and their signal-transduction pathways in major cerebral arterial endothelial cells are largely unknown. This study was undertaken functionally to classify the P2 purinoceptors in cultured bovine middle cerebral artery endothelial cells by using [Ca2+]i microfluorimetry. The rank order of potency to increase [Ca2+]i was 2-methylthio-ATP approximately ATP approximately uridine triphosphate (UTP) > adenosine diphosphate (ADP) > adenosine monophosphate (AMP) > alpha,beta-methylene-ATP > adenosine, suggesting that the effect was mediated by both P2y and P2u receptors. ATP, 2-methylthio-ATP, and UTP mobilized Ca2+ from intracellular stores and triggered Ca2+ entry. The effects of ATP, 2-methylthio-ATP, and UTP were reduced by phospholipase C inhibitor 2-nitro-4-carboxyphenyl-N,N-diphenylcarbamate (NCDC), but only the effects of ATP and UTP were attenuated by pertussis toxin, indicating that P2y and P2u receptors may activate the same effector mechanisms by coupling to different G proteins. The [Ca2+]i entry caused by UTP was significantly reduced by the receptor-regulated Ca2+ channel blocker SK&F 96365, by P-450 inhibitor econazole and by inorganic Ca2+ entry blocker lanthanum. P2-receptor antagonists suramin, pyridoxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulfonic acid (PPADS), and reactive blue 2 reduced the effects of ATP and 2-methylthio-ATP, but not those of UTP, in a concentration-dependent manner. These studies suggest a coexistence of P2y and P2u receptors in cultured bovine middle cerebral artery endothelial cells.", 
    "84": "Blockade of the rapid delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr) as an important mechanism for current Class III antiarrhythmics is less effective in action potential prolongation during beta-adrenergic activation. We hypothesized that blockade of the increased slow IK (IKs) current during beta-adrenergic stimulation could improve action potential prolongation and tested this hypothesis by comparison of three different IK blockers: dofetilide, a selective blocker of IKr; ambasilide, a nonselective blocker of IK; and chromanol 293B, a selective blocker of IKs.", 
    "85": "Transmembrane action potential duration was determined in guinea pig papillary muscles. After equilibration with the potassium channel blockers (dofetilide 10 nM, ambasilide 10 microM, chromanol 293B 10 microM), isoproterenol (10 and 100 nM) was added. The action potential prolonging effect of dofetilide was reduced in the presence of increasing concentrations of isoproterenol whereas the effect of ambasilide was much less reduced. In contrast, the effect of chromanol 293B clearly was increased in the presence of both concentrations of isoproterenol. No afterdepolarizations were observed after application of isoproterenol in control. Following isoproterenol, but not before, dofetilide and chromanol 293B induced early afterdepolarizations in 20% and 17% of the papillary muscles, whereas ambasilide and chromanol 293B induced delayed afterdepolarizations in 27% and 33%, respectively.", 
    "86": "In contrast to dofetilide, the Class III effect of ambasilide is less reduced and the effect of chromanol 293B is enhanced during beta-adrenergic stimulation. Our data support the hypothesis that IKs blockade improves the efficacy of antiarrhythmics in action potential prolongation during beta-adrenergic activation; however, this effect may increase the risk of afterdepolarizations.", 
    "87": "Although the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (1) binds at rodent 5-HT1B serotonin receptors, it displays low affinity (Ki > 10,000 nM) for its species homologue 5-HT1D beta (i.e., h5-HT1B) receptors. The structure of propranolol was systematically modified in an attempt to enhance its affinity for the latter population of receptors. Removal of the alkyl hydroxyl group, shortening of the O-alkyl chain from three to two methylene groups, and variation of the terminal amine substituent resulted in compounds, such as N-monomethyl-2-(1-naphthyloxy)-ethylamine (11; Ki = 26 nM), that display significantly higher h5-HT1B affinity than propranolol. Compound 11 was shown to bind equally well at human 5-HT1D alpha (h5-HT1D) receptors (Ki = 34 nM) and was further demonstrated to possess h5-HT1B agonist character in an adenylate cyclase assay. It would appear that such (aryloxy)alkylamines may represent a novel class of 5-HT1D receptor agonists.", 
    "88": "Phospholamban (PLB) regulates Ca(2+)-adenosinetriphosphatase activity in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum and participates in the regulation of myocardial performance. Animal models with altered levels of PLB permit in vivo evaluation of the physiological role of PLB. This study examined left ventricular (LV) performance in intact PLB heterozygous and homozygous mice under basal and stimulated conditions. A Millar Mikro-Tip transducer was inserted into the right carotid artery and advanced into the LV for direct measurement of ventricular pressure and the first derivative of intraventricular pressure (dP/dt). Baseline blood pressures were increased in PLB heterozygotes and even more so in PLB homozygotes compared with wild types (WT), and there were no differences in heart rate or LV end-diastolic pressure. The increase in pressure was primarily caused by an increase in systolic pressure. Baseline values for positive and negative dP/dt were linearly correlated with PLB levels. In PLB heterozygotes, contractile response to isoproterenol (Iso) was blunted compared with WT, but maximum rates of contraction were similar between the two groups. Contractile performance in PLB homozygous mice, which under baseline conditions was similar to maximum levels seen in WT, showed a blunted response to Iso, and maximum rates of contraction were significantly greater than in either of the other groups, indicating an essential but perhaps not exclusive role for PLB in mediating the inotropic effects of beta-adrenergic agonists. The effects of Iso on negative dP/dt were also blunted in both PLB heterozygous and PLB homozygous animals. Our results demonstrate that myocardial function in highly dependent on PLB level and suggest that the cardiovascular effects of PLB perturbations are largely uncompensated for in the intact mouse.", 
    "89": "Postinjury deficits in monocyte tumor necrosis factor receptors (moTNFR) activity may alter beneficial functions during an inflammatory response. Several counter-regulatory hormones elicited during inflammation may modulate tumor necrosis factor (TNF) activity, but little is known about their influence on moTNFR. Also, catecholamines inhibit TNF production, but the adrenoreceptor mechanism of this effect has not been fully clarified. To determine the effect of catecholamines and corticosteroids on moTNFR, whole blood was coincubated for up to 8 (moTNFR) or 24 h (cytokines) in the presence of lipopolysaccharide (100 ng/ml) and 1) epinephrine (Epi, 10(-6) M), dexamethasone (Dex, 10(-6) M) or both (EpiDex, 10(-6) M) to assess the expression of total moTNFR, moTNFR-I, and moTNFR-II. 2) Epi and norepinephrine (EpiNE, 10(-6) M) and the alpha 1 + 2-, beta 1 + 2-, beta 1-, or beta 2-adrenergic antagonists were used to assess the role of such adrenoreceptors on total moTNFR and TNF production, and N6,2'-O-dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (DBcAMP) alone or in combination with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor Ro-20-1724/000, to study the cAMP-dependent pathway on total moTNFR. We found that Epi upregulated total moTNFR and moTNFR-II. Dex did not significantly influence total moTNFR or moTNFR-II. Also, EpiNE increased total moTNFR and inhibited TNF by a beta 2-dependent mechanism. DBcAMP (10(-5) M) modestly enhanced total moTNFR. This suggests a common mechanism for acutely enhancing moTNFR and attenuation of soluble TNF appearance during conditions of severe stress.", 
    "90": "This study examines rapid (5-60 s) effects of androgens on the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in human granulosa lutenizing cells. Cells were obtained from human preovulatory follicles, and [Ca2+]i was measured with the use of the Ca(2+)-responsive fluorescent dye fluo-3. Molar concentrations between 100 pmol/L and 1 mumol/L androstenedione increased [Ca2+]i within 5 s after addition to cells. This [Ca2+]i increase resulted from both Ca2+ influx, as shown by the effects of ethyleneglycol-bis-(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid and the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel blocker verapamil, and Ca2+ mobilization from the endoplasmic reticulum, as shown by the effects of thapsigargin. Treatment with pertussis toxin and U-73,122, a specific inhibitor of phospholipase C, abolished the effects of androstenedione on [Ca2+]i. Flutamide, a nuclear androgen receptor antagonist, did not block the increase in [Ca2+]i induced by androstenedione. Testosterone (100 pmol/L to 1 mumol/L) had no effect. This is the first report showing that androstenedione increases [Ca2+]i in granulosa cells. These data provide evidence for the presence in granulosa cells of a novel, short term mechanism of androstenedione action involving voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane and phospholipase C activation via a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein.", 
    "91": "We cloned four cDNAs belonging to the CYP2D subfamily to express these enzymes in yeast cells and to compare their catalytic activities simultaneously. Three are believed to be alleles of CYP2D1, 2D2, and 2D3, respectively, based on high nucleotide sequence similarity, while CYP2D4 had both sequences of CYP2D4 and CYP2D18. Expression plasmids carrying CYP2D cDNAs were transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Typical P450 CO-difference spectra with absorbance maximum at 448 nm were recorded with microsomal preparations from the yeast cells expressing the four CYP2D forms. A catalytic study of these CYP2D forms was done with debrisoquine, bufuralol, and lidocaine. CYP2D2 had the highest debrisoquine 4-hydroxylation (2.2 nmol/min/nmol P450) activity, similar to that (2.2 nmol/min/nmol) of human CYP2D6 expressed in yeast cells. CYP2D3 had high lidocaine N-deethylation (43 nmol/min/nmol P450) activity, and both CYP2D3 and 2D2 exhibited high lidocaine 3-hydroxylation (2.4 and 1.6 nmol/min/nmol P450, respectively) activity. Bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation catalytic capabilities were comparable among the four isoforms. The activity of CYP2D1 was relatively low toward the three substrates (debrisoquine, 0.091; bufuralol, 1.5; lidocaine 3-hydroxylation, 0.019; lidocaine N-deethylation, 2.8 nmol/min/nmol P450). These findings indicate that debrisoquine, a typical substrate for CYP2D forms, was mainly metabolized by CYP2D2 but not CYP2D1 in rat liver and that the CYP2D forms have different substrate specificity.", 
    "92": "Although melatonin has been reported to influence neurohypophysial hormone release, no binding has been demonstrated in the neurohypophysial system, suggesting melatonin could affect afferent inputs. The effect of neurotransmitter receptor antagonists on the inhibitory effect of melatonin on neurohypophysial hormone release from the rat hypothalamus in vitro was therefore determined. The agents employed were atropine, a muscarinic cholinergic antagonist; mecamylamine, a nicotinic cholinergic antagonist; atenolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist; phentolamine, a nonselective alpha-adrenergic antagonist; prazosin, a selective alpha-adrenergic antagonist; haloperidol, a dopaminergic antagonist; naloxone, an opioid antagonist; and ibuprofen, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor. Rat hypothalami were incubated in either medium alone or medium containing melatonin or melatonin and antagonist, and hormone release determined. Melatonin (43 nM) significantly inhibited (p < 0.05) vasopressin and oxytocin release. Inhibition was still observed in the presence of atenolol, phentolamine, and naloxone, suggesting that neither adrenergic nor opioid pathways contribute to the response. The inhibitory effect of melatonin on vasopressin and oxytocin release was abolished (p < 0.05) in the presence of atropine (10[-8] M), mecylamine (10[-6] and 10[-4] M), ibuprofen (10[-4] M) and haloperidol (10[-6] and 10[-5] M). The melatonin-induced inhibition of oxytocin release was also attenuated in the presence of prazosin (10[-8] and 10[-6] M). This study suggests that melatonin may influence neurohypophysial hormone release through modulation of afferent pathways mediated by acetylcholine, dopamine, and/or prostaglandin.", 
    "93": "Human cytochrome P450 2D6 metabolizes more than 50 common drugs and is polymorphically expressed, with 5-10% of the population lacking expression caused by mutant genes. This may result in a defective and toxic response in deficient individuals treated with 2D6 drug substrates. Baculovirus-expressed 2D6 was used to immunize mice for hybridoma production and two clones yielded monoclonal antibodies, that were positive against 2D6 by ELISA and inhibited 2D6 catalysed metabolism of bufuralol, dextromethorphan and phenanthrene by more than 90%. The inhibitory activity was highly specific to 2D6 and the monoclonal antibodies did not bind to 11 other P450s, nor inhibit seven human P450s tested. Analysis of eight human liver microsome samples showed that their basal bufuralol 1'-hydroxylase activity varied from 6.7-83.5 pmol min-1 nmol-1 P450. The monoclonal antibody 512-1-8 inhibited 2D6-dependent bufuralol 1'-hydroxylase in these samples by 10-70% indicating a widely variable role for 2D6 in human liver bufuralol 1'-hydroxylase activity and a role for other P450s in bufuralol metabolism. Independent analysis of several recombinant human P450s showed that 2D6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19 and 1A2 exhibited bufuralol 1'-hydroxylase activity with 2D6 and 2C19 being the most active. Further analysis of three liver samples was made with individual inhibitory monoclonal antibodies. Inhibitory antibodies to 2D6, 2B6, 2E1, 2C8/9/19, 3A4 and 1A2 were added to the microsomes either singly or additively. Inhibitory activity of bufuralol 1'-hydroxylase was observed with antibodies to 2D6 (14-76%), 2C8/9/19 (24-69%) and 1A2 (2-25%) indicating a variable and different role for each of these P450s in the bufuralol 1'-hydroxylase of human liver. The monoclonal antibodies to 2B6, 2E1 and 3A4 were not inhibitory, indicating that these enzymes play no role in bufuralol 1'-hydroxylase metabolism. When the three antibodies to 2D6, 2C8/9/19 and 1A2, respectively, were all added, the total bufuralol 1'-hydroxylase of the liver samples was inhibited by more than 90%, indicating that the latter P450s catalyse all of liver bufuralol 1'-hydroxylase metabolism. These studies demonstrate that inhibitory monoclonal antibodies offer a simple and precise method for assessing the quantitative role of each P450 in the metabolism of a P450 substrate in a tissue, which include drugs, carcinogens, mutagens, toxic chemicals and endobiotics.",

    "98": "The effect of beta- and alpha-adrenergic stimulation on cardiovascular function and development of cardiac hypertrophy was studied in rats by measuring the heart weight/body weight and cardiac RNA/DNA ratios. Beta-receptor stimulation with isoproterenol over 3 days induced an increase in the biosynthesis of cardiac adenine nucleotides, myocardial protein synthesis, and the heart weight/body weight ratio. The isoproterenol-induced metabolic effects were prevented by simultaneous beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol. Alpha-adrenergic stimulation with norfenephrine for 3 days induced an increase in heart rate, total peripheral resistance, the myocardial RNA/DNA, and left ventricular weight/body weight ratio. The calcium antagonist verapamil prevented the hemodynamic changes but did not influence the development of cardiac hypertrophy. The alpha-adrenergic blocker prazosin reversed the norfenephrine-induced functional changes and prevented cardiac hypertrophy. Norepinephrine was infused into isolated perfused working rat hearts to elucidate some molecular biological changes that precede the development of cardiac hypertrophy. It increased transiently and sequentially the mRNA of c-fos and c-myc. This enhancement occurred at about the same time as that induced by elevation of pre- and afterload but was more pronounced. These findings were compared with those obtained in other studies assessing the effects of catecholamines on proto-oncogene expression. Combination of norepinephrine with pre- and afterload elevation induced the c-fos mRNA signal to appear earlier, to be more pronounced, and to persist for a longer period of time. Similar results were obtained in regard to the c-myc mRNA. These findings indicate that the combination of two hypertrophy-inducing stimuli which may cause a higher degree of cardiac hypertrophy in vivo induce an earlier, more pronounced, and longer lasting expression of the proto-oncogenes c-fos and c-myc.", 
    "99": "1. A loud acoustic stimulus was administered to rats prior to and after treatment with autonomic blockers in order to unravel the autonomic mechanisms of the blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) responses to startle. 2. Six rats, implanted with a BP telemetric system, were used in a randomized crossover saline-controlled (saline vs. autonomic blocker) study with a washout period of 7 days between each active session. A first acoustic stimulus (110 dB, 0.7 s) was administered. An autonomic blocker i.e. atropine methylnitrate (15 mg. kg-1), atenolol (15 mg. kg-1) or prazosin HCl (1 mg. kg-1), or physiological saline was administered i.p. 40 min prior to a second identical acoustic stimulus. 3. The average BP rise following the first stimulus was +25 mmHg and the average HR change was +17 bpm. The responses after autonomic blockades were affected as follows: atropine increased the HR rise (+45.1 +/- 1.7 bpm), atenolol reversed the HR changes to a bradycardic response (-21.4 +/- 9.1 bpm), after prazosin treatment the BP rise was reversed into a BP decrease (-11.3 +/- 3.2 mmHg) and the HR increase was amplified (+76.0 +/- 10.0 bpm). Finally, the delay for obtaining the maximal BP change was increased from 1.9 to 2.6 s following prazosin pretreatment. 4. These results indicate that the BP rise resulting from an acute loud noise depends on a vascular sympathetic activation (prevented with prazosin), which is partly blunted by vasodilation (revealed with prazosin). The evoked HR changes combine a sympathetic activation (fully expressed following atropine) and a vagal activation (unmasked with atenolol). Further experiments are necessary to document the vasodilatory component unmasked with prazosin.",

At hospital discharge, 1,001 patients were treated with beta-adrenergic blocking agents, 923 with calcium antagonists, 711 with both beta-blockers and calcium antagonists and 1,346 with neither drug. Compared with patients given beta-blockers, patients given calcium antagonists were more likely to suffer myocardial infarction or cardiac death (adjusted relative risk [RR] 1.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0 to 1.9), cardiac death (RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.0 to 2.7) and death from all causes (RR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.6).

    "106": "In many black African populations, the capacity for CYP2D6-dependent drug metabolism is generally reduced. A specific variant of the CYP2D6 gene (CYP2D6*17) that carries three functional mutations (T107I, R296C, and S486T) has been found to be present in Zimbabwean subjects with impaired CYP2D6-dependent hydroxylase activity. To evaluate whether the CYP2D6*17 allele was the major cause behind the decreased rate of drug metabolism and to examine the role of the different mutations, CYP2D6 cDNAs containing all eight combinations of the mutations were created. Expression of the cDNAs in COS-1 cells revealed that the CYP2D6 17 enzyme displayed only 20% of the wild-type (CYP2D6 1) activity, whereas the T107I substitution on its own had no significant effect on enzyme function. Expression in yeast showed that the three possible single amino-acid mutant CYP2D6 variants all had properties similar to CYP2D6 1 when the kinetics of bufuralol hydroxylation was examined. However, enzymes containing both the T107I and R296C mutations exhibited a more than 5-fold higher K(m) for bufuralol than the wild-type enzyme, whereas the S486T mutation was of little importance. In contrast, when codeine was used as a substrate, the T107I substitution alone was sufficient to cause a significant increase in the apparent K(m), indicating a differential effect for this substitution depending on the CYP2D6 substrate. In conclusion, the CYP2D6*17 allele represents the first human cytochrome P450 polymorphic variant in which a combination of substitutions is required to alter the enzyme's catalytic properties and is the first case in which a decreased CYP2D6 activity, as monitored in vivo, has been documented to be caused by an enzyme with altered affinity for CYP2D6 substrates.", 
    "107": "The potential use of terpenes/terpenoids as penetration enhancers in the transdermal delivery of propranolol hydrochloride (PL) was investigated. PL was chosen for the reasons of its extensive first-pass metabolism and short elimination half-life. The terpenes studied included L-menthol, (+)-limonene, (+/-)-linalool, and carvacrol at 1%, 5%, and 10% w/v concentrations. The diffusion of PL across excised hairless mouse skin was determined using side-by-side diffusion cells. Flux, permeability coefficient (Pm), and lag time (tL) were calculated. PL showed comparable lag times with menthol at all three concentration levels. At a 1% level of carvacrol, PL exhibited a 2.4- and 2.2-fold increase in lag time compared with 5 and 10% levels of enhancer, respectively. In the presence of limonene, PL had shown maximum lag time (between 3.0 and 3.3 h) at all three levels. In the case of linalool, the lag times for PL with 5 and 10% levels of enhancer were 7.0- and 5.2-fold less compared with 1% level. A significant (p < 0.05) concentration effect was observed only with linalool. Hydrogel-based patches were formulated with or without menthol as enhancer. Release profiles from the hydrogel formulations obeyed zero-order kinetics. The permeability of propranolol was significantly higher (p < 0.05) from the test patch than the control (no enhancer) patch across the mouse skin. The mechanism of permeation enhancement of menthol could involve its distribution preferentially into the intercellular spaces of stratum corneum and the possible reversible disruption of the intercellular lipid domain. The results suggest the potential use of menthol as effective penetration enhancer in the delivery of significant amounts of PL through skin.", 
    "108": "The basic problem is to compare several treatments with a control in the standard unbalanced one-way layouts. Step-up tests were considered by Dunnett and Tamhane (1995, Biometrics 51, 217-227). In this paper, a method of calculating the critical values of step-up tests is proposed so that the Type I family wise error (FWE) is controlled at a prespecified level alpha. It is also pointed out that the equivalence of a step-up test and the test based on the correspondingly adjusted p-values requires implicitly a monotone property. A practical example is used for illustration.", 
    "109": "Clinical and pathologic studies have confirmed that disruption or superficial erosion of atherosclerotic plaque is the major cause of coronary thrombosis, which is the primary mechanism responsible for acute coronary syndromes of unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction, and sudden cardiac death. Serial angiographic studies have shown that nearly 60-70% of acute coronary syndromes evolve from mildly to moderately obstructive atherosclerotic plaques. The risk of plaque disruption appears to be a function of both plaque vulnerability (intrinsic factors) and extrinsic triggers, and is determined largely by the size of the lipid-rich atheromatous core, the thickness of the fibrous cap covering the core, and the presence of ongoing inflammation within and underneath the cap. Hemodynamic or mechanical stresses may precipitate plaque disruption, particularly in places where the fibrous cap is weakest, such as the shoulders. The degree of thrombosis following plaque disruption depends on the thrombogenicity of the disrupted plaque, the disturbed local rheology, and the systemic thrombotic-thrombolytic milieu. Surges in sympathetic activity (such as those provoked by sudden vigorous exercise, emotional stress, or cold weather) may also trigger plaque disruption. These observations have led to the concept of plaque stabilization as a new strategy for the prevention of acute coronary syndromes. Plaque stabilization can be achieved through pharmacologic and lifestyle-modifying interventions that alter plaque composition and/or inflammatory activity within the plaque and thus reduce its vulnerability to disruption.", 
    "110": "1. beta-Adrenoceptor subtypes in rat and rabbit urinary bladder were investigated in functional experiments by use of several agonists and antagonists. 2. All agonists tested produced concentration-dependent relaxation, but the relative potencies varied between both species: BRL 37344 (pD2:8.0) > isoprenaline (7.3) > adrenaline (6.7) = noradrenaline (6.6) in rat bladder, and isoprenaline (8.7) = adrenaline (8.5) > noradrenaline (7.7) = BRL 37344 (7.4) in rabbit bladder. 3. The relaxation response to isoprenaline in rat bladder was relatively resistant to propranolol and ICI 118551, and the slopes of Schild plot for both antagonists were different from unity. The apparent pKB values estimated by single concentrations of propranolol (1, 10 microM) and ICI 118551(10 microM) were 6.6 and 5.4, respectively. 4. On the other hand, the relaxation response to isoprenaline in rabbit bladder was antagonized by lower concentrations (1 nM-100 nM) of propranolol and ICI 118551 in a competitive manner, resulting in pA2 values of 8.7 and 8.6, respectively. 5. These results suggest species-heterogeneity of beta-adrenoceptors in urinary bladder; beta 3 and beta 2 subtypes in rat and beta 2 subtype in rabbit.", 
    "111": "1. Heterozygous, male, hypertensive, transgenic ((mRen-2)27) rats (350-450 g) were instrumented for the measurement of regional or cardiac haemodynamics (n = 16, in both groups). Animals were given continuous i.v. infusions of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalaprilat, or the dual metallopeptidase inhibitor, MDL 100,240 (both at 3 mg kg-1, 3 mg kg-1 h-1; n = 8 for regional and cardiac haemodynamics), for 32 h. Twenty four hours after the onset of infusion of enalaprilat or MDL 100,240, the bradykinin (B2)-receptor antagonist, Hoe 140 (1 mg kg-1, i.v.), was given and measurements were continued for a further 8 h, to assess any possible involvement of bradykinin. 2. Over the first 8 h of infusion, both enalaprilat and MDL 100,240 had significant antihypertensive effects, accompanied by similar regional vasodilatations. However, the blood pressure lowering effect of MDL 100,240 (-54 +/- 9 mmHg) was greater than that of enalaprilat (-38 +/- 4 mmHg), because the former caused a significantly greater reduction in cardiac index. 3. Between 8-24 h after the onset of infusion, there was a reduction in the effect of enalaprilat on blood pressure, because cardiac index rose, with no further increase in total peripheral conductance. In contrast, the antihypertensive effect of MDL 100,240 persisted, in spite of a recovery in cardiac index, because there was further vasodilatation, particularly in the mesenteric and hindquarters vascular beds. 4. There were no apparent haemodynamic changes associated with the injection of Hoe 140, and over the following 8 h, the difference between the haemodynamic effects of enalaprilat and MDL 100,240 persisted; there was little evidence of suppression of the effects of either drug. 5. These results are more consistent with the antihypertensive effects of enalaprilat or MDL 100,240 in transgenic ((mRen-2)27) rats being due to suppression of angiotensin II production, than due to inhibition of bradykinin degradation. The additional effects of MDL 100,240 may be accounted for by inhibition of the degradation of natriuretic peptides reducing cardiac output, initially, and decreasing vascular tone, subsequently. Alternatively, the additional increase in vascular conductance following treatment with MDL 100,240 may represent an autoregulatory response to the reduced pressure.", 
    "112": "1. Vasoconstrictor responses of the isolated and perfused canine epicardial coronary artery to uridine 5'-triphosphate (UTP) were analysed pharmacologically. 2. At basal perfusion pressure, UTP induced vasoconstriction in a dose-related manner and the vasoconstriction was sometimes followed by a slight vasodilatation at large doses (more than 10 nmol). The rank order of potency for vasoconstriction was UTP = UDP > ATP > TTP > or = ITP > UMP. At raised perfusion pressure by 20 mM KCl, the vasoconstriction was not changed and a small vasodilatation was induced at large doses. The rank order of potency for vasodilatation was induced at large doses. The rank order of potency for vasodilatation was ATP > ITP > or = UDP > UTP > or = TTP. The maximal vasodilator response to UTP was much less than that to ATP. UMP did not induce vasodilatation. 3. The P2X receptor agonist and desensitizing agent alpha, beta-methylene ATP (1 microM) and the P2 receptor antagonist suramin (100 microM) inhibited the vasoconstrictor responses to ATP but not those to UTP and UDP. The P2 receptor antagonist reactive blue 2 (30 microM) did not inhibit the vascular responses to UTP. 4. UTP (200 microM) desensitized the vasoconstrictor responses to UTP, but not either the vasodilator responses to UTP or the vasoconstrictor responses to ATP and UDP. UDP (200 microM) did not desensitize the vascular responses to UTP. 5. Preincubating the UDP stock solution and arterial preparation with hexokinase (10 and 1 uml-1, respectively) did not change the vasoconstrictor responses to UDP. 6. The Ca channel blocker diltiazem (1 microM) inhibited the vasoconstrictor responses to UTP but not those to ATP and UDP. Incubation in a Ca(2+)-free solution containing 1 mM EGTA inhibited the vascular responses to ATP, UTP and UDP. 7. Removal of the endothelium by an intraluminal injection of saponin (1 mg) inhibited the vasodilator responses to UTP. Indomethacin, a cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor (1 microM), inhibited the vasodilator responses to UTP, but NG-nitro-L-arginine, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (300 microM), did not have an inhibitory effect. 8. The results suggest that (1) UTP induces vasoconstriction via UTP-preferring P2Y receptors on the smooth muscle and vasodilatation via receptors different from those mediating the vasoconstriction induced by UTP and mediating the vasodilatation by ATP on the endothelium, through mainly the release of prostacyclin in the canine epicardial coronary artery; (2) UDP induces vasoconstriction via UDP-preferring P2Y receptors; and (3) L-type Ca ion channels are involved in the vasoconstriction induced by UTP, but not in that induced by UDP.", 
    "113": "Agonist binding to G protein-coupled receptors is believed to promote a conformational change that leads to the formation of the active receptor state. However, the character of this conformational change which provides the important link between agonist binding and G protein coupling is not known. Here we report evidence that agonist binding to the beta2 adrenoceptor induces a conformational change around 125Cys in transmembrane domain (TM) III and around 285Cys in TM VI. A series of mutant beta2 adrenoceptors with a limited number of cysteines available for chemical derivatization were purified, site-selectively labeled with the conformationally sensitive, cysteine-reactive fluorophore IANBD and analyzed by fluorescence spectroscopy. Like the wild-type receptor, mutant receptors containing 125Cys and/or 285Cys showed an agonist-induced decrease in fluorescence, while no agonist-induced response was observed in a receptor where these two cysteines were mutated. These data suggest that IANBD bound to 125Cys and 285Cys are exposed to a more polar environment upon agonist binding, and indicate that movements of transmembrane segments III and VI are involved in activation of G protein-coupled receptors.", 
    "114": "The role of protein kinase C (PKC) in modulating the release of the octapeptide cholecystokinin (CCK-8) was investigated in rat hippocampal nerve terminals (synaptosomes). The PKC-activating phorbol ester 4beta-phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (beta-PDBu) dose dependently (5-5,000 nM) increased CCK-8 release in a strictly Ca2+dependent way. This effect was observed only when synaptosomes were stimulated with the K+(A) channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (4-AP; 1 mM) but not with KCl (10-30 mM). The PDBu-induced exocytosis of CCK-8 was completely blocked by the two selective PKC inhibitors chelerythrine and calphostin-C and was not mimicked by alpha-PDBu, an inactive phorbol ester. In addition, an analogue of the endogenous PKC activator diacylglycerol, oleoylacetylglycerol, dose dependently increased CCK-8 exocytosis. Beta-PDBu (50-100 nM) also stimulated the 4-AP-evoked Ca2+-dependent release of the classic transmitter GABA, which co-localizes with CCK-8 in hippocampal interneurons. As a possible physiological trigger for PKC activation, the role of the metabotropic glutamate receptor was investigated. However, the broad receptor agonist (1S,3R)-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid did not stimulate, but instead inhibited, both the CCK-8 and the GABA exocytosis. In conclusion, presynaptic PKC may stimulate exocytosis of distinct types of co-localizing neurotransmitters via modulation of presynaptic K+ channels in rat hippocampus.", 
    "115": "Increased sympathetic activity perioperatively and associated cardiovascular effects play a central role in cardiovascular complications. High thoracic epidural blockade attenuates the sympathetic response, but even with complete pain relief, haemodynamic and endocrine responses are still present.

This study was designed to evaluate the perioperative haemodynamic effect of preoperative beta-blockade and its influence on the haemodynamic aspects of the surgical stress response.",

Postoperative cardiac index (CI) was lower with a lower variability and cardiac filling pressures were slightly higher in the metoprolol group. The oxygen consumption index was higher after placebo throughout the observation period, with no difference in the oxygen delivery.",

    "119": "Many types of drugs are used by athletes to improve performance. This paper reviews the literature on 3 categories of drugs: those that enhance performance as stimulants (amphetamines, ephedrine, and cocaine), those that are used to reduce tremor and heart rate (beta-blockers) and those involved in bodyweight gain or loss (anabolic-androgenic steroids, growth hormone, beta 2-agonists, and diuretics). Limitations of research on these drugs as they relate to performance enhancement are also discussed. The numerous studies that have assessed the effects of amphetamines on performance report equivocal results. This may be due to the large interindividual variability in the response to the drug and the small sample sizes used. Most studies, however, show that some individuals do improve exercise performance when taking amphetamines, which may be attributed to their role in masking fatigue. As a stimulant, ephedrine has not been found to improve performance in the few studies available. More recently, ephedrine has been purported to be effective as a fat burner and used by athletes to maintain or improve muscle mass. Although research on individuals with obesity supports the use of ephedrine for fat loss, no studies have been done on athletes. The few studies of cocaine and exercise suggest that little to no performance gains are incurred from cocaine use. Moreover, the sense of euphoria may provide the illusion of better performance when, in actuality, performance was not improved or was impaired. beta-Blockers have been found to reduce heart rate and tremor and to improve performance in sports that are not physiologically challenging but require accuracy (e.g. pistol shooting). However, there is evidence that some individuals may be high responders to beta-blockers to the extent that their heart rate response is so blunted as to impair performance. Although equivocal, several studies have reported that anabolic-androgenic steroids increase muscle size and strength. However, most studies are not well controlled and use insufficient drug doses. One recent well controlled study did find an increase in muscle mass and strength with supraphysiological doses, and the improvements were greater in participants who were also resistance training. There is little information available on the effects of growth hormone on muscle mass or performance in athletes, although data suggest that growth hormone administration does not increase muscle protein synthesis. beta 2-Agonists, such as clenbuterol and salbutamol, when administered orally appear to improve muscular strength due to their potential role in increasing muscle mass. However, studies have not been done using athletes. Diuretics results in a loss of body water and hence bodyweight that can be advantageous for sports with strict bodyweight classifications. There is insufficient evidence on possible performance decrements in the field that could result from dehydration induced by the diuretics. Overall, the most significant concern in studies of drug use is the large inter-individual variability in responses to a drug. Further studies are needed to understand why some individuals are more responsive than others and to assess whether the responses are consistent for a given individual. Most studies of drug effectiveness have not used athletes. The effectiveness of many drugs may be reduced in highly trained athletes because there is a lower margin for improvement.", 
    "120": "Treatment with a beta-adrenergic blocker (beta-blocker) in hypertension is associated with increased plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) levels despite a decrease in cardiac overload. The mechanism and pathophysiological significance of the phenomenon remain unclear. To clarify the role of the ANP system in the antihypertensive effects of the beta-blocker, we investigated the effects of carvedilol (30 mg/kg x day, orally, for 4 weeks) on the ANP system in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-SP/Izm). Plasma ANP levels showed a significant increase despite a significant decrease in blood pressure and heart rate in the carvedilol group. Although ANP messenger RNA levels in the heart did not change, messenger RNA levels of the natriuretic peptide-C (NP-C) receptor as a clearance receptor showed a significant decrease in both the aorta and lung in the carvedilol group. NP-C receptor densities were also significantly decreased in the lung in this group. The biological half-life of exogenous ANP in circulating blood was prolonged in the carvedilol group compared with that in the control group. Administration of the ANP receptor antagonist, HS-142-1, resulted in a greater increase in systolic blood pressure in the carvedilol group than in the control group. In addition, both basal and ANP-stimulated cGMP contents in the aorta were significantly higher in the carvedilol group. These results suggest that carvedilol potentiates the hypotensive action of ANP by increasing plasma ANP levels and enhancing the vascular response to ANP. These effects were closely related to the down-regulation of the NP-C receptor. The newly found mechanism seems to account for a sizable portion of the antihypertensive effects of carvedilol and could be of potential importance in the treatment of cardiovascular disease with beta-blockers.", 
    "121": "1. Noradrenaline induces a meagre vasoconstriction in small muscular pulmonary arteries compared to large conduit pulmonary arteries. We have examined whether this may be partially related to differences in the beta-adrenoceptor-mediated vasorelaxation component and, in particular, beta-adrenoceptor-mediated NO release. 2. Noradrenaline induced a bell-shaped concentration-response in large (1202+/-27 microm) and small (334+/-12 microm) pulmonary arteries of the rat. In large arteries tension increased to 95.6+/-1.8% of 75 mM KCl (KPSS; n=8) at 2 microM, above which tension declined. The response in small arteries was meagre (12+/-1.5% KPSS, n=9), peaking at 0.2 microM. N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA; 100 microM) abolished the decline in tension induced by higher concentrations of noradrenaline in large arteries, and increased maximum tension (117+/-3.5% KPSS, n=5, P<0.05). In small arteries peak tension doubled (22.0+/-3.4% KPSS, n=6, P<0.01), but still declined above 0.2 microM. 3. Propranolol (1 microM) abolished the decline in tension at higher concentrations of noradrenaline in both groups, but increased tension substantially more in small (37.4+/-3.7% KPSS, n=5, P<0.001) than in large arteries (112.2+/-3.7% KPSS, n=9, P<0.05). In the presence of L-NMMA, propranolol had no additional effect on large arteries, whereas in small arteries there was greater potentiation than for either agent alone (67.8+/-5.9% KPSS, n=4). 4. Beta-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxation was examined in arteries constricted with prostaglandin F2alpha (50 microM). In the presence of propranolol isoprenaline caused an unexpected vasoconstriction, which was abolished by phentolamine (10 microM). In the presence of phentolamine, isoprenaline caused a maximum relaxation of 43.3+/-2.1% (n=6) in large, and 49.0+/-4.5% (n=6) in small arteries. L-NMMA substantially reduced relaxation in large arteries (7.4+/-1.5%, n=6, P<0.01), but was less effective in small arteries (26.8+/-5.8, n=5, P<0.05). 5. Atenolol (beta1-antagonist, 5 microM) reduced relaxation to isoprenaline (large: 34.8+/-4.5%, n=5; small: 35.0+/-1.9%, n=6), but in combination with L-NMMA had no additional effect over L-NMMA alone. ICI 118551 (beta2-antagonist, 0.1 microM) reduced isoprenaline-induced relaxation more than atenolol (large: 18.0+/-4.6%, n=6, P<0.05; small: 25.6+/-10.7%, n=6, P<0.05). ICI 118551 in combination with L-NMMA substantially reduced relaxation (large: 4.8+/-2.6%, n=9; small: 6.5+/-3.6%, n=5). 6. Salbutamol-induced relaxation was reduced substantially by L-NMMA in large arteries (control: 34.7+/-6.4%, n=6; +L-NMMA: 8.3+/-1.3%, n=5, P<0.01), but to a lesser extent in small arteries (control: 50.9+/-7.5%, n=6; +L-NMMA: 23.0+/-0.7%, n=5, P<0.05). Relaxation to forskolin was also partially antagonized by L-NMMA. 7. These results suggest that the meagre vasoconstriction to noradrenaline in small pulmonary arteries is partially due to a greater beta-adrenoceptor-mediated component than in large arteries. Beta-mediated vasorelaxation in large arteries was largely NO-dependent, whereas in small arteries a significant proportion was NO-independent. Noradrenaline stimulation was also associated with NO release that was independent of beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "122": "1. We have previously shown (Malinowska & Schlicker, 1996) that the atypical beta-adrenoceptor involved in the positive chronotropic effect of the so-called non-conventional partial beta-adrenoceptor agonists CGP 12177 and cyanopindolol in the pithed rat possesses properties markedly different from those observed for beta3-adrenoceptors in the literature. In the present study, we have directly compared the pharmacological properties of the atypical cardiostimulant beta-adrenoceptor and of the beta3-adrenoceptor mediating the thermogenic response in the brown adipose tissue in pithed and vagotomized rats. 2. Heart rate was dose-dependently increased by CGP 12177 and cyanopindolol by maximally 150 and 100 beats min(-1), yielding pED50 values of 8.0 and 7.3, respectively (pED50, -log10 of the dose in mol kg(-1) body weight i.v. causing the half-maximum effect), but not affected by the selective beta3-adrenoceptor agonist CL 316243 (pED50 > 6.0). 3. CGP 12177, cyanopindolol and CL 316243 increased temperature in the brown adipose tissue by maximally 1 degree C (pED50 values 7.4, 6.3 and 8.6, respectively). 4. The beta1-adrenoceptor antagonist CGP 20712 10 micromol kg(-1), attenuated the cardiostimulatory effect of CGP 12177 and, at a still higher dose (30 micromol kg(-1)), also antagonized its thermogenic effect. The -log10 values of the doses causing a two fold shift of the dose-response curves (DRCs) of CGP 12177 to the right were 6.1 and 5.2, respectively, and were much lower than the corresponding value for the antagonism of CGP 20712 against the beta1-adrenoceptor-mediated positive chronotropic effect which was 8.6. 5. The cardiostimulant and the thermogenic effect of CGP 12177 were not affected by the beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118551 10 micromol kg(-1). 6. The beta3-adrenoceptor antagonist SR 59230A (which, by itself, caused a beta1-adrenoceptor-mediated increase in heart rate and, for this reason, was studied after administration of a low dose of CGP 20712) attenuated the cardiostimulant and the thermogenic effect of CGP 12177 to a similar extent. The -log10 values of the doses causing two fold rightward shifts of the DRCs of CGP 12177 were 5.9 and 5.7, respectively. 7. The non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist bupranolol diminished the cardiostimulant and thermogenic response to a very similar extent. The -log10 values causing two fold rightward shifts of the DRCs of CGP 12177 were 5.6 and 5.7, respectively, and were much lower than the corresponding values for the antagonism of bupranolol against the beta1-adrenoceptor-mediated positive chronotropic effect and the beta2-adrenoceptor-mediated decrease in diastolic blood pressure which were 7.6 and 8.3, respectively. 8. The rank order of agonistic potencies for the cardiostimulant effect (CGP 12177 > cyanopindolol > CL 316243) differs from that for the thermogenic response in the brown adipose tissue (CL 316243 > CGP 12177 > cyanopindolol); furthermore, there is a difference with respect to the rank orders of antagonistic potencies for cardiostimulation (CGP 20712 > or = SR 59230A > or = bupranolol > ICI 118551) and thermogenesis (SR 59230A = bupranolol > CGP 20712 > ICI 118551). 9. In conclusion, our study provides further evidence that the atypical cardiostimulant beta-adrenoceptors (causing an increase in heart rate) and beta3-adrenoceptors are pharmacologically different.", 
    "123": "1. To date no study has described the cardiovascular effects of increased myofilament Ca2+ responsiveness in awake animals both under resting conditions and during treadmill exercise. In the present study we therefore investigated the systemic, pulmonary and coronary haemodynamic actions of the Ca2+ sensitizer EMD 57033 in 16 chronically instrumented awake pigs at rest and during treadmill exercise, and compared these to the haemodynamic actions of the Ca2+ sensitizer/phosphodiesterase inhibitor pimobendan. 2. Under resting conditions EMD 57033 (0.2, 0.4 and 0.8 mg kg(-1) min(-1), i.v.) produced dose-dependent increases in LVdP/dt(max) (up to 65+/-17% (mean+/-s.e.mean), P < or = 0.05) and stroke volume (up to 20+/-3%, P < or = 0.05), with an increase in heart rate only after the highest dose (22+/-5%, P < or = 0.05), while mean aortic blood pressure and LVdP/dt(min) were not altered. EMD 57033 had also no effect on pulmonary vascular resistance, but produced dose-dependent decreases in systemic vascular resistance (32+/-4%, P < or = 0.05), and coronary vascular resistance (44+/-2%, P < or = 0.05). These effects were essentially unchanged when animals were pretreated with non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blockade, indicating that phosphodiesterase inhibition did not contribute to the positive inotropic actions of EMD 57033. 3. During exercise at 2, 3, and 4 km h(-1), the positive inotropic actions of EMD 57033 gradually waned at higher levels of exercise. This may have been caused by the exercise-induced increase in beta-adrenergic activity, because after pretreatment with propranolol the positive inotropic actions of EMD 57033 were preserved at all levels of exercise. In contrast, the positive inotropic and chronotropic effects of pimobendan were amplified during exercise, but were abolished (at rest) or markedly attenuated (during exercise) after pretreatment with propranolol. 4. The responses to EMD 57033 during exercise after combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor blockade were not different from those after beta-adrenergic receptor blockade alone, indicating that the positive inotropic actions of EMD 57033 were not mediated via or did not depend on intact alpha-adrenergic receptor activity. 5. In conclusion, EMD 57033 increases left ventricular myocardial contractility in awake pigs. During exercise this effect is partially offset by the increased beta-adrenergic activity, with no effect of alpha-adrenergic activity, suggesting that EMD 57033 may be most effective in patients with severe loss of beta-adrenergic responsiveness.", 
    "124": "Recently there has been growing interest in studying the differences between different classes of antihypertensive drugs in preventing cardiovascular events in diabetic patients. Hypomagnesemia is common in diabetes mellitus, and correlates to its chronic complications and the associated alteration of the antioxidant enzyme activity. Depletion of reduced glutathione (GSH) in the blood has been demonstrated with myocardial injuries associating hypomagnesemia. A previous study has demonstrated a beneficial effect of metformin hydrochloride (Met), an antihyperglycemic drug, on both magnesium (Mg) and GSH levels in diabetic animals. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of oral atenolol, metformin (50 and 60 mg kg[-1] day[-1], respectively) and their combination for 14 days on Mg and GSH levels in blood, liver and heart of diabetic male Wistar rats, as these two parameters have been shown to be altered in diabetics and linked to myocardial ischemic injuries. The results of this investigation showed a state of low levels of Mg and GSH in both blood and liver of the diabetic animals. Treatment with atenolol alone did not change these levels significantly, however administration of metformin or atenolol/metformin increased significantly the GSH levels in both liver and blood, and returned the liver Mg content back to normal values.", 
    "125": "During the first few weeks after birth, major changes occur in porcine adipocyte lipid metabolism. Two of the important receptors controlling lipid metabolism in adipocytes are the beta-adrenergic receptors (betaAR) and the A1 adenosine receptors (A1R). To gain insight into the role of these receptors in modulating neonatal adipocyte lipid metabolism, we measured receptor affinity and number in suckling pigs. Adipose tissue from crossbred (X-Bred) and genetically obese suckling pigs at 0, 3, 10, and 17 d of age was used to prepare crude membranes. The betaAR and A1R number and affinity were measured in membranes by equilibrium saturation binding with radioligands. Obese pigs were smaller than X-Bred pigs (average weight = 1.62 and 2.43 kg for obese and X-Bred, respectively; P < .01). Osmium-fixed adipocytes were larger in obese pigs than in X-Bred pigs (average cell diameter = 34.4 and 30.1 microm for obese and X-Bred, respectively; P < .01). In the obese and X-Bred pigs, the affinity of the betaAR for iodocyanopindolol was greater (lower Kd) at 17 d than at the younger ages (average Kd = 177 pM at 17 d compared with > 330 pM at younger ages; age effect P < .01). The pattern for the betaAR number was complex; the lowest receptor number was at 10 d of age in obese and X-Bred pigs (average number = 41 at 10 d compared with > 65 fmol/mg protein at older and younger ages; age effect P = .03). The higher betaAR Kd and the lower receptor number in younger animals suggest less regulation by physiologic concentrations of epinephrine and norepinephrine. This would allow greater anabolic lipid metabolism to proceed during the neonatal period, when adipocytes increase four- to sixfold in volume. There were no measurable A1R at any of these early ages; thus, adenosine control mechanisms to counteract the betaAR and provide negative controls to lipid accretion are not operable in suckling pigs.", 
    "126": "The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that patients with angina, positive exercise test and angiographically smooth coronary arteries (syndrome X), may exhibit abnormal myocardial glucose handling, as assessed by fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and positron emission tomography (PET) and to investigate the possibility that this abnormality could be reversed by treatment with betablockers, the drugs of choice in most patients with syndrome X. Eight consecutive patients (4 females, age 53 +/- 4 yrs) with syndrome X were studied. Off therapy, they underwent stress/rest 99m-TcMIBI SPET (360 degrees) and assessment of resting glucose metabolism by PET. PET studies were again performed after a 10 day treatment period on oral atenolol (100 mg/o.d.). All patients exhibited significant fasting FDG uptake in 2 or more myocardial regions. Overall, there were 28 of 48 segments (58%) with abnormal tracer uptake. On atenolol, there were only 5 segments with persistent FDG uptake (10%) in 2 patients. At rest, 7 patients exhibited perfusion defects in 14 myocardial segments. With stress performed in pharmacological wash-out, 5 patients developed perfusion defects in 10 myocardial segments. Eight of these segments were already underperfused at rest, and showed further reduction in perfusion after stress. All hypoperfused segments showed abnormal FDG uptake when the PET study was performed off therapy. The results suggest that, in patients with syndrome X, imbalance of the demand/supply ratio, either caused by limited coronary flow reserve or by primary vasoconstriction with reduction in myocardial perfusion, may determine a sustained metabolic shift towards anaerobic glycolysis. The mechanism by which atenolol improves metabolism in these patients could be simply related to reduction in O2 consumption.",

    "130": "Rest, mean 24-hour and maximal exercise heart rate were all significantly and directly related to the probability of improvement, but heart rate at rest, supine and in upright position, showed the highest predictive power. The relationship between heart rate and improvement with metoprolol appeared to be non-linear, with an increasing probability in patients with higher heart rate, but with a fall of the slope in cases with extreme tachycardia. By dividing our study population on the basis of the most important clinical variables, this complex relation was evident only in patients at a more advanced stage of the disease.",

    "132": "The syndrome of akathisia typically consists of a subjective component, e.g. inner restlessness and an urge to move, and observable symptoms such as restless legs and inability to sit still. In most cases akathisia is caused by neuroleptics. There are several subtypes of akathisia according to the time of onset in the course of neuroleptic treatment. In clinical routine extrapyramidal motor disturbances are often underestimated or misinterpreted. As far as akathisia is concerned, differential diagnosis of restlessness or of repetitive movement patterns may be problematic. Non-compliance and impulsive behaviour are regarded as possible complications of akathisia, but systematic investigations are lacking. The pathophysiology of akathisia is not clear, but it probably differs from other pharmacologically induced motor disturbances. If warrantable, the first step in akathisia treatment is dose-reduction of the causing agent. Anticholinergic drugs, benzodiazepines, and beta-receptor blockers may be effective. Clinical assessment and survey of the patient's behaviour, e.g. during occupational therapy and group therapy is important for an early diagnosis of akathisia so that complications may be minimised.", 
    "133": "The aim of this double-blind, parallel group study was to compare the effects of nebivolol and atenolol on blood pressure (BP) and insulin sensitivity in hypertensive patients with type II, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). After a 4-week run-in period on placebo, 30 patients (14 males and 16 females) aged 43 to 69 years, with stable NIDDM and mild to moderate hypertension (DBP > or =95 and <116 mm Hg) were randomised to receive either nebivolol 5 mg or atenolol 50 mg, both administered once daily for 6 months. At the end of the placebo and the active treatment periods, supine and standing BP was measured, 24-h urinary C-peptide, HbA1c, plasma glucose and lipid levels were evaluated and an euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp was performed to evaluate insulin sensitivity: glucose infusion rate during the last 60 min of clamp and total glucose requirements were evaluated. Nebivolol 5 mg once daily was of an equivalent efficacy as atenolol 50 mg once daily at reducing supine and standing systolic and diastolic BP values. Neither beta-blocker adversely affected carbohydrate metabolism in terms of insulin sensitivity, whole body glucose utilization, HbA1c and 24-h urinary C-peptide excretion. No significant changes in cholesterol (total, high density and low density lipoprotein) and triglycerides plasma levels were observed with both beta-blockers. These findings indicate that, in hypertensive patients with NIDDM, ie, in subjects who have established insulin resistance, treatment with nebivolol and atenolol neither further deteriorated insulin sensitivity nor adversely affected the lipid profile.", 
    "134": "We sought to determine whether 10 days of training would be a sufficient stimulus for cardiac adaptations that would allow a greater compensatory stroke volume during beta-blockade. We also sought to determine whether men and women had a similar cardiac reserve capacity for increasing stroke volume with beta-blockade during submaximal exercise. Eight men (age 29 +/- 2 yr, mean +/- SE) and eight women (25 +/- 2 yr) cycled at 65% of peak O2 consumption (unblocked) under placebo-control and beta-blockade (100 mg atenolol) conditions performed on separate days. These tests were repeated at the same power output after training (10 consecutive days, 1 h of cycling per day). Before training, beta-blockade significantly (P < 0.05) decreased heart rate (HR) and cardiac output and increased stroke volume in both men and women. After training, the increase in stroke volume and decrease in HR with beta-blockade was significantly less while cardiac output was reduced more. There were no gender differences in the effects of beta-blockade on HR, stroke volume, or cardiac output. These data indicate that, during exercise with beta-blockade, exercise training for 10 days does not enhance the compensatory increase in stroke volume and that men and women have a similar cardiac reserve capacity for increasing stroke volume.", 
    "135": "To evaluate stress-induced changes in blood leukocytes with emphasis on the natural killer (NK) cells, eight male volunteers were followed during three trials of head-up tilt with adrenergic beta 1- (metoprolol) and beta 1 + 2- (propranolol) blockade and with saline (control) infusions. The beta 1- and beta 1 + 2-receptor blockade did not affect the appearance of presyncopal symptoms, but the head-up tilt induced a transient lymphocytosis that was abolished by beta 1 + 2-receptor blockade but not by beta 1-receptor blockade. Head-up tilt also resulted in delayed neutrophilia, which was insensitive to beta-receptor blockade. Lymphocyte subset analysis revealed that the head-up tilt resulted in a twofold increase in the percentage and absolute number of CD3-/CD16+ and CD3-/CD56+ NK cells in peripheral blood and that this increase was partially blocked by metoprolol and abolished by propranolol. The NK cell activity on a per NK cell basis did not change during head-up tilt, indicating that the cytotoxic capability of NK cells recruited to circulation is unchanged. The data suggest that the head-up tilt-induced lymphocytosis was due mainly to CD16+ and CD56+ NK cells and that their recruitment to the blood was inhibited by beta 1- and especially beta 1 + 2-receptor blockade. Thus stress-induced recruitment of lymphocytes, and of NK cells in particular, is mediated by epinephrine through activation of beta-receptors on the lymphocytes.", 
    "136": "We questioned the superiority of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to beta blocking drugs with regard to renal function outcome in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency and normal to moderately elevated blood pressure (BP). We therefore studied 89 patients in a prospective double-blind randomized trial comparing the effect of enalapril and atenolol on the slope of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Mean baseline GFR was 53 +/- 20 ml/min, untreated BP 152 +/- 20 mm Hg systolic and 90 +/- 11 mm Hg diastolic and median proteinuria 0.6 g/24 hr (interquartile range 0.0 to 2.5). After a run-in period without antihypertensives, the test drug was titrated to lower diastolic BP to a predefined goal of 10 mm Hg below baseline and/or below 95 mm Hg. The median follow up was 3.9 years. Antihypertensive therapy resulted in a comparable decrease of BP in both study groups. Filtration fraction and proteinuria decreased in both groups. The slope of GFR over time was not different between both groups (-1.39 +/- 2.82 and -1.97 +/- 3.38 ml/min/year on atenolol and enalapril, respectively). In multiple regression analysis a higher baseline GFR, a greater decrease in GFR and in proteinuria during titration and a lower proteinuria during follow up were independently related to a better GFR slope. We conclude that the use of ACE inhibitors is not imperative in all patients with non-diabetic nephropathy.",

    "140": "A high percentage of patients with chronic open-angle glaucoma receive a wide variety of medications for coexisting systemic disorders. The concomitant use of glaucoma and systemic medications creates the potential for drug interactions, as well as side effects for both groups of drugs, for which the Physicians' Guide may be beneficial.", 
    "141": "We have studied why rat pineal N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity is relatively insensitive to isoproterenol in young rats when compared with adult rats. We report that activation by isoproterenol of pineal cyclic AMP production and NAT activity is higher in adult than in 2-week-old rats. However, the effect of dibutyryl cyclic AMP, which enters the pinealocyte and duplicates the effect of cyclic AMP, on NAT activity was similar at both ages. Moreover, we found that both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors are highly specific at both ages, since the binding of the specific radioligands used to their receptors could be displaced only by their corresponding agonists and antagonists. However, we observed differences between pineals from young and adult rats when several families of the alpha subunit of G-proteins were studied in cell membranes. ADP-ribosylation and immunoblot studies have shown clear differences in both 42 and 45 kDa forms of the Gs alpha Both forms exhibit low values in pineals from 2-week-old animals when compared with 6-week-old. We also show that the later appearance of both Gs alpha forms is roughly similar to the potent activation of cyclic AMP production and NAT activity in adult rats when compared with young rats. In conclusion, the results presented suggest that the relative lack of sensitivity of rat pineal gland to beta-adrenergic receptor agonists early in the postnatal development may be explained by the low levels of membrane Gs alpha, rather than postreceptor-mediated mechanisms or changes in the characteristics of the beta-adrenergic receptors on the pinealocyte membrane.",

    "149": "Beta blockers have long been used in the treatment of systemic hypertension, where they effectively lower blood pressure and, in so doing, they decrease left ventricular hypertrophy. The sympathetic nervous system is activated in patients with congestive heart failure, and therefore it is logical that beta blockers may also provide benefit in these patients. As such, beta blockers are currently being evaluated in several large clinical trials in congestive heart failure. One particular drug, carvedilol, is a third-generation vasodilating beta blocker that is marketed for the treatment of hypertension. The drug lowers systemic arterial blood pressure without producing reflex tachycardia and preserves renal function. Carvedilol decreases mortality by 65% and decreases hospitalization by 29% in patients with congestive heart failure. The effects of carvedilol in heart failure may result, at least in part, from beta blockade as well as vasodilation, the latter resulting from alpha(1)-adrenoceptor blockade. Interestingly, carvedilol has a number of additional properties that may also provide benefit in these patients. Carvedilol and several of its metabolites are potent antioxidants that may inhibit catecholamine toxicity resulting from the oxidation of norepinephrine and the subsequent formation of toxic intermediates, including the generation of reactive oxygen free radicals in the myocardium. As a result of its antioxidant activity, carvedilol also blocks the expression of several genes involved in myocardial damage and cardiac remodeling, and the drug inhibits free radical-induced activation of transcription factors and programmed cell death (apoptosis). Carvedilol is a novel beta blocker that is highly effective in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure, and combines in one molecule a number of important pharmacologic properties.", 
    "150": "Remifentanil (Ultiva) is a novel, ultra-short-acting opioid which has recently been approved for use as an analgesic during induction and maintenance of general anesthesia. Esmolol is a short-acting beta-blocker used during surgical procedures to reduce heart rate and blood pressure. Both drugs are metabolized by nonspecific esterases in the blood and other tissues and may be administered concomitantly during surgery. The goal of this study was to determine if coadministration of esmolol significantly alters the pharmacokinetics of remifentanil in the rat. Two groups of rats were dosed with remifentanil [25 micrograms/kg/min (n = 8)] and remifentanil plus esmolol [25 and 200 mg/kg/min (n = 7)] for 20 min. Cardiovascular measurements were collected continuously over the course of the study. Serial blood samples (12) were collected over 25 min into test tubes containing 0.5 mL of acetonitrile. Blood samples were extracted (liquid-liquid) with methylene chloride and then analyzed by a validated GC-MS assay. Compartmental data analysis was performed using PCNONLIN. The mean(+/- SD) for Cl and t1/2 observed in treatment I were 390(+/- 98) mL/min/kg and 0.69(+/- 0.27) min and in treatment II were 421(+/- 164) mL/min/kg and 0.56(+/- 0.22) min, respectively. Comparison of clearance, volume of distribution, and terminal half-life between the two groups showed that coadministration of esmolol had no significant (p < 0.05) effect on the pharmacokinetics of remifentanil in the rat.", 
    "151": "Ventricular concentrations of atrial, brain (BNP) and C-type natriuretic peptide are enhanced in congestive heart failure (CHF). Natriuretic peptide receptors are present on ventricular myocytes and stimulate guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) production. cGMP has been demonstrated to affect myocyte function in vitro. Thus we hypothesized that the intracardiac natriuretic peptide system may modulate myocardial and coronary function in CHF. To test this hypothesis, the effects of an intracoronary infusion of the natriuretic peptide receptor antagonist HS-142-1 on ventricular and coronary function were examined in anesthetized dogs with chronic CHF. To determine whether receptor stimulation had contrasting effects to those of receptor blockade, intracoronary BNP was infused in anesthetized normal and CHF dogs. Low-dose HS-142-1 delayed and slowed left ventricular (LV) relaxation and decreased coronary blood flow without changes in LV pressures. Higher doses further impaired LV relaxation without further decreases in coronary blood flow. In normal and CHF dogs, exogenous BNP produced the opposite effect with a quicker onset and faster rate of LV relaxation without effects on LV pressures or coronary blood flow. The endogenous natriuretic peptide system has an autocrine-paracrine role to modulate LV and coronary vascular function in CHF.", 
    "152": "Neuregulins (also known as ARIA, NDF, heregulin, GGF) are a family of widely expressed growth and differentiation factors. Neuregulins secreted from motor neurons accumulate at maturing neuromuscular junctions, where they stimulate transcription of genes encoding specific acetylcholine receptors. How these factors function at central synapses, however, is unknown. In the maturing cerebellum, neuregulins are concentrated in glutamatergic mossy fibres that innervate granule cells in the internal granule-cell layer. We have analysed the effects of neuregulins on the expression of genes encoding NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors in the cerebellum, because receptor composition changes dramatically as expression of the receptor NR2C subunit is specifically induced in neurons in the internal granule-cell layer during synaptogenesis. Here we report that addition of a neuregulin-beta isoform to cultured cerebellar slices specifically increases the expression of NR2C messenger RNAs by at least 100-fold; effects are only minor with a neuregulin-alpha isoform. This stimulation of NR2C expression requires synaptic activity by NMDA receptors, as well as neuregulin-beta. Addition of the NMDA-receptor-channel blocker AP-5 prevents upregulation of the NR2C subunit by neuregulin, whereas an AMPA/kainate-receptor antagonist does not. Consistent with these effects of neuregulin, we find that granule cells express its receptors ErbB2 and ErbB4 before the NR2C subunit of the NMDA receptor. Our results indicate that neuregulins regulate the composition of neurotransmitter receptors in maturing synapses in the brain, in a manner analogous to the neuromuscular junction.", 
    "153": "1. The metabolism of carteolol, a beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug, was investigated in male Sprague-Dawley rat liver microsomes. 2. The formation of 8-hydroxycarteolol was the principal metabolic pathway of carteolol in vitro and followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a K(m) = 11.0 +/- 5.4 microM and a Vmax = 1.58 +/- 0.64 nmol/min/nmol P450 respectively (mean +/- SD, n = 5). Eadie-Hofstee plot analysis of carteolol 8-hydroxylase activity confirmed single-enzyme Michaelis-Menten kinetics. 3. The cytochrome P450 isoforms involved in 8-hydroxylation of carteolol were investigated using selective chemical inhibitors and polyclonal anti-P450 antibodies. Quinine (Ki = 0.06 microM) and quinidine (Ki = 2.0 microM), selective inhibitors of CYP2D1, competitively inhibited 8-hydroxycarteolol formation. Furthermore, only anti-human CYP2D6 antibody inhibited this reaction. 4. These results suggest that carteolol is metabolized to 8-hydroxycarteolol by CYP2D1. The K(m) of carteolol for CYP2D1 in male rat liver microsomes was much greater than those of propranolol or bunitrolol, indicating that carteolol has a lower affinity for CYP2D1 compared with these other beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs."
