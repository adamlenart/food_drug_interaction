The authors hypothesized that nebivolol, a selective \u03b21 -antagonist that stimulates nitric oxide (NO), will improve endothelial function in AAs with hypertension when compared with metoprolol. In a double-blind, randomized, crossover study, 19 AA hypertensive patients were randomized to a 12-week treatment period with either nebivolol 10 mg or metoprolol succinate 100 mg daily. Forearm blood flow (FBF) was measured using plethysmography at rest and after intra-arterial infusion of acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside to estimate endothelium-dependent and independent vasodilation, respectively. Physiologic vasodilation was assessed during hand-grip exercise. Measurements were repeated after NO blockade with L-N(G) -monomethylarginine (L-NMMA) and after inhibition of endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) with tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA). NO blockade with L-NMMA produced a trend toward greater vasoconstriction during nebivolol compared with metoprolol treatment (21% vs 12% reduction in FBF, P=.06, respectively). This difference was more significant after combined administration of L-NMMA and TEA (P<.001). Similarly, there was a contribution of NO to exercise-induced vasodilation during nebivolol but not during metoprolol treatment. There were significantly greater contributions of NO and EDHF to resting vasodilator tone and of NO to exercise-induced vasodilation with nebivolol compared with metoprolol in AAs with hypertension.", 
    "1": "Complex interactions between tumor cells and their surrounding compartment are strongly influenced by the host in which the tumor grows. In melanoma, for instance, stress-associated norephinephrine (NE), acting at \u03b2-adrenergic receptors (\u03b2-ARs), stimulates melanoma cell proliferation and tumor angiogenesis. Among \u03b2-ARs, \u03b23-ARs play a role acting not only at tumor cells but also at non-neoplastic stromal cells within the melanoma. In the present study, we used a murine model of B16 melanoma to evaluate the role of the host \u03b21- and \u03b22-ARs in melanoma growth and we determined whether the role of \u03b23-ARs can be influenced by the absence of stromal \u03b21- and \u03b22-ARs. As compared to wild-type mice, \u03b21/2-AR knockout mice displayed (i) increased intratumoral levels of both NE and \u03b23-ARs, as evidentiated at both messenger and protein levels; (ii) increased tumor vascularization; (iii) decreased tumor cell proliferation but increased tumor cell apoptosis; and (iv) increased responsiveness to intratumoral injection of the \u03b23-AR blocker L-748,337 in terms of decrease in tumor growth, tumor vascular response, tumor cell proliferation, and increase in tumor cell death. These findings together validate the role of \u03b2-AR signaling in melanoma microenvironment suggesting that non-neoplastic stromal cells may be targeted by \u03b2-AR-related drugs. The additional fact that \u03b23-ARs play an important role in melanoma growth suggests selective \u03b23-AR antagonists as important proapoptotic agents.",

One potential new treatment for alcohol addiction is based on disrupting the reconsolidation of the maladaptive Pavlovian memories that can precipitate relapse to drug-seeking behavior. In alcohol self-administering rats, we investigated the effects of bidirectionally modulating adrenergic signaling on the strength of a Pavlovian cue-alcohol memory, using a behavioral procedure that isolates the specific contribution of one maladaptive Pavlovian memory to relapse, the acquisition of a new alcohol-seeking response for an alcohol-associated conditioned reinforcer. The \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol, administered in conjunction with memory reactivation, persistently disrupted the memory that underlies the capacity of a previously alcohol-associated cue to act as a conditioned reinforcer. By contrast, enhancement of adrenergic signaling by administration of the adrenergic prodrug dipivefrin at reactivation increased the strength of the cue-alcohol memory and potentiated alcohol seeking. These data demonstrate the importance of adrenergic signaling in alcohol-associated memory reconsolidation, and suggest a pharmacological target for treatments aiming to prevent relapse through the disruption of maladaptive memories.",

The lack of a standardized definition of effective antianginal therapy and the lack of clear understanding of the underlying evidence have often been cited as reasons for the large variations in the use of these particular classes of pharmacologic agents in contemporary clinical practice. Hence, we performed a search of the PubMed database and identified published manuscripts examining the effect of common antianginal agents on improving anginal parameters and on important clinical outcomes such as mortality, myocardial infarction, and repeat revascularization from multiple large randomized, controlled trials, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and outcomes data from observational studies in patients with stable ischemic heart disease. The most commonly used antianginal agents (beta-blockers, nitrates, calcium channel blockers, and ranolazine) demonstrated equivalent efficacy in improving patient reported ischemic symptoms and quantitative exercise parameters. With regards to mortality, beta-blockers are beneficial in the setting of depressed left ventricular systolic function. In contrast, recent evidence points toward the lack of similar benefit of beta-blockers in patients with preserved systolic function, even in the setting of prior myocardial infarction. No survival benefit has been identified with the use of calcium channel blockers, nitrates, or ranolazine. Currently, guidance regarding objective measurement and up titration of antianginal therapy is missing.

Hepatic Rheb or active-S6K expression have similar metabolic effects, whereas hepatic expression of dominant-negative-S6K inhibits TG elevation in SNAT2 mice. Denervation, pharmacological deafferentation and \u03b2-blocker administration suppress obesity-related hypertriglyceridemia with adipose LPL upregulation, suggesting that signals are transduced between liver and adipose tissue via a neuronal pathway consisting of afferent vagal and efferent sympathetic nerves.

Patients with disproportionately high catecholamine responses to stressful events are prone to worse clinical outcomes. Catecholamines stimulate platelet activation and, therefore, may determine the clinical presentation and outcomes of TCM. We conducted a retrospective, descriptive study TCM patients admitted between 2003 and 2013 to Einstein Medical Center, Philadelphia, PA, USA and Danbury Hospital, Danbury, CT, USA. A total of 206 patients met Modified Mayo TCM criteria. Using a multiple logistic model, we tested whether aspirin, dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) aspirin\u00a0+\u00a0clopidogrel, beta blocker, statin, or ACE inhibitor use were independent predictors of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) during the index hospitalization. MACE was defined as in-hospital heart failure, in-hospital death, stroke or respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Incidence of in-hospital heart failure was 26.7\u00a0%, in-hospital death was 7.3\u00a0%, stroke was 7.3\u00a0% and MACE was 42.3\u00a0%. In a multiple logistic regression model (adjusted for gender, race, age, physical stressor, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, smoking history, body mass index, initial left ventricular ejection fraction, single antiplatelet therapy, DAPT, beta blocker, statin, and ACE inhibitor) aspirin and DAPT at the time of hospitalization were independent predictors of a lower incidence of MACE during the index hospitalization (aspirin: OR 0.4, 95\u00a0% CI (0.16-0.9), P\u00a0=\u00a00.04; DAPT: OR 0.23; 95\u00a0% CI (0.1-0.55); P\u00a0<\u00a00.01. Physical stressor itself was also found to be an independent predictor of worse MACE: OR 5.1; 95\u00a0% CI (2.4-11.5); P\u00a0<\u00a00.01. In our study, aspirin and DAPT were independent predictors of a lower incidence of MACE during hospitalization for TCM.

However, in case of G protein coupled receptors (GPCR), docking and binding energy (BE) calculations are not enough to discriminate agonist and antagonists. Absence of a reliable model for discriminating \u03b22AR antagonist is still a major hurdle. Docking of known antagonists and agonists into activated and ground state \u03b22AR revealed several key intermolecular interactions and H-bonding patterns, which in combination, emerged as a model for prediction of antagonists. Present study identifies an alternative binding orientation, within the binding pocket, for blockers and a minimum grid size to lessen the false positive predictions. Cluster analysis revealed structural variability among the antagonists and a conserved pattern in case of agonists. A combination of docking and structure activity relationship (SAR) model reliably discriminated antagonists. Based on key intermolecular interactions, a set of agonists and antagonists useful to SAR, quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) and pharmacophore modeling, has also been proposed for identifying antagonists.",

In this study, the fractions retained by CMC column were separated and identified by UPLC/MS system. Using metoprolol as a positive control drug, coptisine from C. chinensis was identified as the active component which could inhibit \u03b21AR. Compared with the control group: coptisine could attenuate the infarct size and release malondialdehyde (MDA) while increasing superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, suggesting a role in reducing myocardial injury. In vitro, coptisine could decrease apoptosis, showing their protective effects upon cardiomyocytes. This \u03b21AR-CMC-offline-UPLC/MS method can be applied for screening active components acting on \u03b21AR from traditional Chinese medicines.",

In addition, the results of in vivo pharmacological trials revealed that rutaecarpine (1.1mg/ml) and evodiamine (1.1mg/ml) attenuated myocardial infarct size injured by myocardial ischemia/reperfusion, improved metabolism disorders between fatty acid and glucose, increased the content of ATP, Ca(2+)-ATPase activity and reduced the content of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1 (PPAR\u03b1) protein level. Thus, the \u03b21-AR/CMC-offline-UPLC/MS method developed in this study could be used as an effective alternative for screening \u03b21-AR binding bioactive components in traditional Chinese medicines and the bioactive components could be used to remedy cardiac diseases via energy modulation.", 
    "60": "Ample evidence supports the statement that in patients with atrial fibrillation in whom treatment is warranted, either rhythm control or rate control are acceptable primary therapeutic options. If a rhythm control strategy is chosen, it is important to consider that recurrence of atrial fibrillation is not treatment failure per se. Occasional recurrence, with cardioversion if necessary, may be quite acceptable. The latter will depend on the frequency, duration and symptoms associated with recurrence, and may require a change in the rhythm control therapy, e.g., change the antiarrhythmic drug, or initiate or redo atrial fibrillation ablation. And a rhythm control strategy should include careful attention to and treatment of comorbidities (hypertension, heart failure, diabetes, etc.). If a rate control strategy is chosen, treatment with a beta blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker is almost always required to achieve adequate rate control. Digoxin is often useful to obtain satisfactory rate control in combination with a beta blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. Digoxin may be useful as primary therapy in the presence of hypotension or heart failure. Satisfactory ventricular rate control is usually a resting rate less than 110 beats per minute, although resting rates below 90 beats per minute are probably wiser. Finally, when pursuing a rhythm control strategy, because recurrence of atrial fibrillation is common, rate control therapy should be a part of the treatment regimen.", 
    "61": "Chronotropic incompetence (CI) is common in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and may be a key reason underlying exercise intolerance in these patients. However, the determinants of CI in HFpEF are unknown. We prospectively studied 157 patients with consecutive HFpEF who underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing and defined CI according to specific thresholds of the percent heart rate reserve (%HRR). CI was diagnosed as present if %HRR <80 if not taking a \u03b2 blocker and <62 if taking \u03b2 blockers. Participants who achieved inadequate exercise effort (respiratory exchange ratio \u22641.05) on cardiopulmonary exercise testing were excluded. Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression was used to determine the factors associated with CI. Of the 157 participants, 108 (69%) achieved a respiratory exchange ratio >1.05 and were included in the final analysis. Of these 108 participants, 70% were women, 62% were taking \u03b2 blockers, and 38% had chronic kidney disease. Most patients with HFpEF met criteria for CI (81 of 108; 75%). Lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR), higher B-type natriuretic peptide, and higher pulmonary artery systolic pressure were each associated with CI. A 1-SD decrease in GFR was independently associated with CI after multivariable adjustment (adjusted odds ratio 2.2, 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 4.4, p\u00a0= 0.02). The association between reduced GFR and CI persisted when considering a variety of measures of chronotropic response. In conclusion, reduced GFR is the major clinical correlate of CI in patients with HFpEF, and further study of the relation between chronic kidney disease and CI may provide insight into the pathophysiology of CI in HFpEF.",

The molecular micelle is used as a chiral selector in capillary electrophoresis. This study is part of a larger effort to understand the mechanism of chiral recognition in capillary electrophoresis by characterizing the molecular micelle binding of chiral compounds with different geometries and charges. Propranolol and atenolol were chosen because their structures are similar, but their chiral interactions with the molecular micelle are different. Molecular dynamics simulations showed both propranolol enantiomers inserted their aromatic rings into the molecular micelle core and that (S)-propranolol associated more strongly with the molecular micelle than (R)-propranolol. This difference was attributed to stronger molecular micelle hydrogen bonding interactions experienced by (S)-propranolol. Atenolol enantiomers were found to bind near the molecular micelle surface and to have similar molecular micelle binding free energies.",

The secondary objective of this study was to study the effect of P-gp inhibitor NRG on the P-gp probe drug TLN. The binary amorphous samples were prepared by quench cooling technique in the molar ratios TLN:NRG (1:1), TLN:NRG (1:2), TLN:NRG (2:1). The prepared samples were characterized by DSC, FTIR and XRD. Amorphicity of the prepared binary amorphous samples was confirmed by spotting diffuse halo in the diffractograms and further corroborated by detecting glass transition event (Tg) in the thermograms of the respective samples. The Tgs for all prepared systems were found above room temperature, the highest being 45.43 \u00b0C. The systems were found physically stable at 25 \u00b0C and 40 \u00b0C at dry conditions for 60 days. The temperature stability of prepared amorphous forms may be attributed to strong intermolecular hydrogen bond interaction between TLN and NRG, which was confirmed by Gordon-Taylor calculations and FTIR data. The solubility of TLN in amorphous form was increased by approximately 9-fold as compared to its crystalline counterpart. The in-vivo bioavailability study conducted on wistar rats demonstrated 5.4-fold increase in the AUC0-t value for TLN as compared to its crystalline counterpart. Further to learn the contribution of P-gp inhibition by NRG on the permeability of TLN, In-vitro single pass perfusion studies were conducted on the ileum of wistar rats. The permeability of TLN in rat ileum in the presence of NRG was significantly increased to 3.16\u00d710(-5) cm/s as compare to control value 2.48\u00d710(-5) cm/s.

    "79": "Carvedilol (CRV) is an antihypertensive drug with both alpha and beta receptor blocking activity used to preclude angina and cardiac arrhythmias. To overcome the low, variable oral bioavailability of CRV, niosomal formulations were prepared and characterized: plain niosomes (without bile salts), bile salt-enriched niosomes (bilosomes containing various percentages of sodium cholate or sodium taurocholate), and charged niosomes (negative, containing dicetyl phosphate and positive, containing hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide). All formulations were characterized in terms of encapsulation efficiency, size, zeta potential, release profile, stability, and morphology. Various formulations were administered orally to ten groups of Wistar rats (n=6 per group). The plasma levels of CRV were measured by a validated high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method and pharmacokinetic properties of different formulations were characterized. Contribution of lymphatic transport to the oral bioavailability of niosomes was also investigated using a chylomicron flow-blocking approach. Of the bile salt-enriched vesicles examined, bilosomes containing 20% sodium cholate (F2) and 30% sodium taurocholate (F5) appeared to give the greatest enhancement of intestinal absorption. The relative bioavailability of F2 and F5 formulations to the suspension was estimated to be 1.84 and 1.64, respectively. With regard to charged niosomes, the peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of CRV for positively (F7) and negatively charged formulations (F10) were approximately 2.3- and 1.7-fold higher than after a suspension. Bioavailability studies also revealed a significant increase in extent of drug absorption from charged vesicles. Tissue histology revealed no signs of inflammation or damage. The study proved that the type and concentration of bile salts as well as carrier surface charge had great influences on oral bioavailability of niosomes. Blocking the lymphatic absorption pathway significantly reduced oral bioavailability of CRV niosomes. Overall twofold enhancement in bioavailability in comparison with drug suspension confers the potential of niosomes as suitable carriers for improved oral delivery of CRV.",

    "94": "Autophagy is a vital pathway for the removal of \u03b2-amyloid peptide (A\u03b2) and the aggregated proteins that cause Alzheimer's disease (AD). We previously found that cilostazol induced SIRT1 expression and its activity in neuronal cells, and thus, we hypothesized that cilostazol might stimulate clearances of A\u03b2 and C-terminal APP fragment \u03b2 subunit (APP-CTF\u03b2) by up-regulating autophagy.When N2a cells were exposed to soluble A\u03b21-42, protein levels of beclin-1, autophagy-related protein5 (Atg5), and SIRT1 decreased significantly. Pretreatment with cilostazol (10-30 \u03bcM) or resveratrol (20 \u03bcM) prevented these A\u03b21-42 evoked suppressions. LC3-II (a marker of mammalian autophagy) levels were significantly increased by cilostazol, and this increase was reduced by 3-methyladenine. To evoke endogenous A\u03b2 overproduction, N2aSwe cells (N2a cells stably expressing human APP containing the Swedish mutation) were cultured in medium with or without tetracycline (Tet+ for 48 h and then placed in Tet- condition). A\u03b2 and APP-CTF\u03b2 expressions were increased after 12~24 h in Tet- condition, and these increased expressions were significantly reduced by pretreating cilostazol. Cilostazol-induced reductions in the expressions of A\u03b2 and APP-CTF\u03b2 were blocked by bafilomycin A1 (a blocker of autophagosome to lysosome fusion). After knockdown of the SIRT1 gene (to ~40% in SIRT1 protein), cilostazol failed to elevate the expressions of beclin-1, Atg5, and LC3-II, indicating that cilostazol increases these expressions by up-regulating SIRT1. Further, decreased cell viability induced by A\u03b2 was prevented by cilostazol, and this inhibition was reversed by 3-methyladenine, indicating that the protective effect of cilostazol against A\u03b2 induced neurotoxicity is, in part, ascribable to the induction of autophagy. In conclusion, cilostazol modulates autophagy by increasing the activation of SIRT1, and thereby enhances A\u03b2 clearance and increases cell viability.",

    "103": "Haemangiomas are benign vascular tumours that generally arise in the skin during the first days of life. They usually grow for a few months before stabilising and regressing over a period of several years, sometimes leaving sequelae. Because of their size or location, some haemangiomas cause: impairment of vital functions (vision, breathing); disfigurement with major problems of self-image; painful skin ulcers; and unsightly scars. When the growth of haemangioma is likely to cause complications, treatment with oral prednisolone at a dose of 2 to 3 mg/kg per day for several months can hasten its regression but carries a risk of numerous adverse effects, including electrolyte disturbances, cardiovascular and musculoskeletal disorders, hypercorticism, behavioural disorders, immunosuppression and growth retardation. Regrowth of the haemangioma sometimes occurs after prednisolone discontinuation. Propranolol, a beta-blocker, has been authorised in the European Union for the treatment of severe infantile haemangiomas, in the form of an oral solution to be used at a dose of 3 mg/kg per day for several months. Two randomised, unblinded trials with low statistical power compared propranolol with prednisolone in respectively 19 and 30 infants treated for several months. No difference in efficacy was observed. Treatment withdrawal seemed less frequent with propranolol. Two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials tested a 6-month course of propranolol. Propranololled to tumour regression in about half of the infants in one trial but, 17 months after propranolol withdrawal, tumour regrowth occurred in about 40% of the children considered to be in clinical remission. In the other trial, the haemangiomas shrank on average by about 60% with propranolol versus 14% with placebo. The known adverse effects of propranolol differ from those of corticosteroids. They mainly consist of hypoglycaemia, bradycardia, hypotension, bronchospasm, sleep disturbances, and gastrointestinal disorders. In comparative trials, treatment discontinuation because of adverse effects appeared to be less frequent with propranolol than with prednisolone. Severe adverse effects, some of which were fatal, have been reported in infants treated with propranolol. In practice, when medication is warranted for infantile haemangioma, propranolol is the drug of first choice. Parents and healthcare professionals must monitor infants closely for adverse effects. Treatment initiation and each dose increase should take place in hospital.", 
    "104": "Diabetic kidney disease is the most frequent cause of end-stage renal disease. This implies failure of current therapeutic approaches based on renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade. Recent phase 3 clinical trials of paricalcitol in early diabetic kidney disease and bardoxolone methyl in advanced diabetic kidney disease failed to meet the primary endpoint or terminated on safety concerns, respectively. However, various novel strategies are undergoing phase 2 and 3 randomized controlled trials targeting inflammation, fibrosis and signaling pathways. Among agents currently undergoing trials that may modify the clinical practice on top of RAS blockade in a 5-year horizon, anti-inflammatory agents currently hold the most promise while anti-fibrotic agents have so far disappointed. Pentoxifylline, an anti-inflammatory agent already in clinical use, was recently reported to delay estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) loss in chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3-4 diabetic kidney disease when associated with RAS blockade and promising phase 2 data are available for the pentoxifylline derivative CTP-499. Among agents targeting chemokines or chemokine receptors, the oral small molecule C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) inhibitor CCX140 decreased albuminuria and eGFR loss in phase 2 trials. A dose-finding trial of the anti-IL-1\u03b2 antibody gevokizumab in diabetic kidney disease will start in 2015.

    "105": "Careful review of the literature of the last 20\u00a0years since the appearance of the first positive trials in heart failure indicates an evolution in the mode of death moving from sudden death to a predominance of pump failure death (i.e., death due to progression of heart failure). Pump failure is becoming a leading cause of mortality in a range of patient profiles, including patients with newly diagnosed or severe heart failure, patients with devices, and patients with heart failure associated with Chagas' disease. Indeed, the evidence suggests that modern management strategies, such as beta-blockers and devices, are successful in preventing sudden death. However, this means that optimally treated patients are at greater risk for the consequences of pump failure (death, hospitalization, and reduced quality of life). This highlights a new important unmet need in heart failure, and a priority for current research should be therapies that reduce pump failure death and hospitalization for more cost-effective management of the disease. Insofar as one-third of heart failure patients do not survive more than 3 years after diagnosis, properly addressing pump failure is an essential target in heart failure.",

A new hybrid molecule incorporating both NO and H2S donors into aspirin (NOSH-aspirin) was recently developed. In the present study, the antinociceptive activity of this novel molecule was compared with aspirin in different models of inflammatory pain. It was found that NOSH-aspirin inhibits acetic acid-induced writhing response and carrageenan (Cg)-induced inflammatory hyperalgesia in a dose-dependent (5-150\u00a0\u03bcmol/kg, v.o.) manner, which was superior to the effect of the same doses of aspirin. NOSH-aspirin's antinociceptive effect was also greater and longer compared to aspirin upon complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced inflammatory hyperalgesia. Mechanistically, NOSH-aspirin, but not aspirin, was able to reduce the production/release of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2) during Cg-induced paw inflammation. Furthermore, NOSH-aspirin, but not aspirin, reduced prostaglandin E2-induced hyperalgesia, which was prevented by treatment with a ATP-sensitive potassium channel (KATP) blocker (glibenclamide; glib.). Noteworthy, the antinociceptive effect of NOSH-aspirin was not associated with motor impairment. The present results indicate that NOSH-aspirin seems to present greater potency than aspirin to reduce inflammatory pain in several models. The enhanced effects of NOSH-aspirin seems to be due to its ability to reduce the production of pronociceptive cytokines such as IL-1 \u03b2 and directly block hyperalgesia caused by a directly acting hyperalgesic mediator in a mechanism dependent on modulation of KATP channels. In conclusion, we would like to suggest that NOSH-aspirin represents a prototype of a new class of analgesic drugs with more potent effects than the traditional NSAID, aspirin.",

Arterial stiffness is associated with multiple negative cardiovascular outcomes, including myocardial infarction, stroke, and sudden death. Therefore, identifying therapeutic interventions that improve arterial stiffness in response to changes in elastin levels is of vital importance. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of chronic pharmacologic therapy with different classes of antihypertensive medications on arterial stiffness in elastin insufficiency. Elastin-insufficient mice 4-6 wk of age and wild-type littermates were subcutaneously implanted with osmotic micropumps delivering a continuous dose of one of the following: vehicle, losartan, nicardipine, or propranolol for 8 wk. At the end of treatment period, arterial blood pressure and large artery compliance and remodeling were assessed. Our results show that losartan and nicardipine treatment lowered blood pressure and pulse pressure in elastin-insufficient mice. Elastin and collagen content of abdominal aortas as well as ascending aorta and carotid artery biomechanics were not affected by any of the drug treatments in either genotype. By reducing pulse pressure and shifting the working pressure range of an artery to a more compliant region of the pressure-diameter curve, antihypertensive medications may mitigate the consequences of arterial stiffness, an effect that is drug class independent. These data emphasize the importance of early recognition and long-term management of hypertension in Williams-Beuren syndrome and elastin insufficiency.",

Factors affecting extraction efficiency including the logarithms of the octanol/water partition coefficient (logPo/w ) of analytes, acid\u00a0dissociation constants, the logarithms of the octanol/water partition coefficient of solvents and pH of the sample solution were investigated. The results showed that a low water solubility of extraction solvent is the foundation to ensure higher extraction efficiency. Moreover, when \u0394logPo/w > 0, a higher extraction efficiency is observed at lower \u0394logPo/w , on the contrary, when \u0394logPo/w < 0, extraction efficiency is higher as the absolute value of \u0394logPo/w becomes greater.

The decrease in HR in the controls during vagal stimulation was markedly attenuated, but persisted after i.v. injections of atropine and propranolol. When first administered, DPCPX modestly but significantly reduced the HR response to vagal stimulation, but this disappeared after i.v. caffeine administration. Both the HR and BP responses were significantly accentuated after i.v. injection of dipyridamole. Vagal stimulation induced a significant increase in APC, proportional to the magnitude of HR decrease. Our data suggest that the inhibitory effects of electrical vagal stimulations on HR and BP were partly mediated through the activation of A1 and A2 receptors by an endogenous adenosine release. Our experimental data could help to understand the effects of ischemic preconditioning, which are partially mediated by adenosine.",

The lungs were examined histologically to grade injury.", 
    "201": "Seven days after lung contusion and lung contusion/hemorrhagic shock, the addition of chronic restraint stress significantly increased the mobilization of HPC, which was associated with persistently increased levels of G-CSF and increased lung injury scores. The addition of propranolol to lung contusion/chronic restraint stress and lung contusion/hemorrhagic shock/chronic restraint stress models greatly decreased HPC mobilization and restored G-CSF levels to that of na\u00efve animals without worsening lung injury scores.", 
    "202": "The daily administration of propranolol after both lung contusion and lung contusion/hemorrhagic shock subjected to chronic restraint stress decreased the prolonged mobilization of HPC from the bone marrow and decreased plasma G-CSF levels. Despite the decrease in mobilization of HPC, lung healing did not worsen. Alleviating chronic stress with propranolol may be a future therapeutic target to improve healing after severe injury.", 
    "203": "Infantile haemangioma (IH) is the most frequent benign tumour seen in children. In most cases, diagnosis is made chiefly on clinical grounds, and because the condition tends to subside naturally within several years and without any major sequelae, therapeutic abstention is the rule. However, a number of additional investigations may be necessary: where the clinical picture is atypical or potentially confusing, where the condition may affect adjacent or remote structures, in screening for associated anomalies in certain syndromal forms which practitioners must be able to recognise. Such investigations facilitate therapeutic indications for forms of haemangioma likely to lead to complications. The most important recent therapeutic development has been the discovery of the spectacular efficacy of beta-blockers (propranolol) upon the development kinetics of infantile haemangioma, greatly transforming the prognosis for these haemangiomas at risk."
