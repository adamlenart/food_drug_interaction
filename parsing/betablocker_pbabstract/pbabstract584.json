Heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac index (CI), total peripheral resistance index (TPRI), and regional hemodynamic measurements were determined before and two hours after its administration (10 mg/kg, gavage) using the combined radioactive reference sample and microsphere techniques (85SR and 141Ce). The agent significantly reduced MAP (168 +/- 5 to 158 +/- 5 mm Hg; p less than 0.02) after 20 minutes without changing HR in SHR. After two hours MAP, HR, and Cl were significantly reduced without change in TPRI. Only Cl decreased (p less than 0.05) in WKY, presumably from its beta receptor antagonist effects. Blood flow to the major organs (eg, heart, brain, and kidneys) was maintained in both groups of rats. These hemodynamic effects reflect the combined actions of this new agent and suggest its potential value for the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "1": "The effects of a selective beta 2-blocker (ICI 118,551) on hepatic haemodynamics were studied in cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic rats. Infusions of 10 and 20 microgram (kg body wt)-1 min-1 beta 2-blocker (in cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic rats) significantly reduced portal pressure, portal venous flow and liver blood flow without altering heart rate. Splanchnic vascular resistance was significantly increased following infusions of 10 and 20 micrograms (kg body wt)-1 min-1 beta 2-blocker. An intraportal injection of beta 2-blocker (10 micrograms body wt)-1 or hepatic artery ligation lowered portal pressure by approximately the same magnitude. Intraportal injection of beta 2-blocker after hepatic artery ligation did not further reduce portal pressure. The results indicate that a selective beta 2-blocker reduces portal pressure by a combination of increased splanchnic vascular resistance and hepatic arterial resistance. It is concluded that a selective beta 2-blocker may be of clinical value in the long-term managements of portal hypertension.", 
    "2": "The initial stage of interaction of beta-adrenomimetics and beta-adrenoblockers with specific membrane binding sites is characterized by different patterns of thermodynamic parameters. Administration of isadrin results in a decrease of entropy and enthalpy, which reflects the primary binding reaction and agonist-specific receptor isomerization to the conformational form activating adenylate cyclase. Anaprilin and alpheprol do not change the receptor conformation and participate only in the primary binding reaction which is marked by a decrease in enthalpy and a rise of entropy in the course of interaction of beta-adrenoblockers with specific membrane binding sites. The different patterns of thermodynamic parameters under the effect of beta-adrenomimetics and beta-adrenoblockers on plasma membranes are explained by the different influence of these substances on the mobility of membrane lipids, i.e. on the viscosity of plasma membranes.", 
    "3": "Intracellular recordings were made in juxtaglomerular granulated (JG) cells and in vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells in afferent arterioles of hydronephrotic mouse kidneys. Both cell types did not differ in their passive and active electrical membrane properties; membrane potential was about -58 mV, input resistance exceeded 400 M omega, and JG as well as VSM cells showed spontaneous depolarizations resembling excitatory junction potentials and active responses observed in smooth muscle cells of other blood vessels in various species. These depolarizations, attributed to spontaneous transmitter release from adrenergic terminals, were extremely polymorphous and quite frequent. Epinephrine, norepinephrine, phenylephrine, arginine vasopressin, and angiotensin II depolarized JG and VSM cells, but isoproterenol and orciprenaline had no effect. A hyperpolarizing action of catecholamines was never observed. It is suggested that, in this in vitro preparation, isoproterenol increases renin secretion by a mechanism independent of membrane potential changes. Depolarizations mediated by alpha-mimetic agents, arginine vasopressin, and angiotensin II, as well as by the junctional activity may inhibit renin secretion by an increased calcium influx into JG cells.", 
    "4": "A second coronary artery revascularization procedure often yields poor results. Nifedipine, a calcium antagonist, was added to the current medical therapy consisting of maximal doses of beta blockers and nitrates in a group of 18 patients who had had one revascularization procedure and subsequently had class 3 and 4 angina pectoris. The overall favorable clinical response was 72%. The average dose of nifedipine to achieve a clinical response was 90 mg/day. Left ventricular function improved with time. We believe nifedipine is an important adjunct in the management of angina after coronary bypass operation.", 
    "5": "The development of new drugs, especially beta-blocking and calcium entry-blocking agents, has greatly facilitated the medical treatment of angina pectoris. The specific needs of each patient should dictate the appropriate treatment of angina pectoris. Angina may occur in patients who have various concomitant disorders such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or arrhythmias, and the physician must take these factors into account when a drug regimen is prescribed. Individual drugs should be chosen on the basis of specifically desired pharmacologic effects, and the dosages should be gradually adjusted according to the patient's response. Although a therapeutic regimen should be selected primarily on the basis of efficacy, the physician must also attempt to recommend a simple and cost-effective program.", 
    "6": "The effect on ovulation of intraventricular infusions of noradrenaline, adrenaline and various pharmacological agents acting on the adrenergic receptor subtypes were investigated in cyclic female rats on the day of pro-oestrus. The inhibitory effects on ovulation of the different infusions were monitored by administering the drugs before 11.00 h (several hours before the critical period for the ovulatory LH surge). In experiments designed to show how the drugs under investigation might stimulate ovulation, pentobarbitone sodium (35 mg/kg) was given at 14.30 h; this anaesthetic inhibits ovulation and its effects can be overcome by substances that advance the preovulatory LH surge. Noradrenaline (an alpha-agonist) stimulated ovulation when administered on the morning of pro-oestrus to rats injected with pentobarbitone early in the afternoon of the same day. Phenoxybenzamine and phentolamine (non-selective alpha-antagonists) and clonidine (a selective alpha 2-agonist) all inhibited ovulation when infused on the morning of pro-oestrus. Yohimbine (a moderately selective alpha 2-antagonist) neither stimulated nor inhibited ovulation. Both isoprenaline (a non-selective beta-agonist) and fenoterol (a selective beta 2-agonist) stimulated ovulation in pentobarbitone-treated rats when administered on the morning of pro-oestrus and fenoterol was also able to overcome the pentobarbitone block when infused later in the afternoon. Propranolol (a non-selective beta-antagonist) and metoprolol (a selective beta 1-antagonist) were stimulatory only when administered in the afternoon. Adrenaline (both an alpha- and beta-agonist), prenalterol (a selective beta 1-agonist), atenolol (a selective beta 1-antagonist) and ICI 118,551 (a selective beta 2-antagonist) neither stimulated nor inhibited ovulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "7": "Recent studies in man demonstrated a marked ketogenic effect of increased plasma norepinephrine concentrations as observed in diabetic ketoacidosis. Since this effect may have been due either to increased substrate supply for ketogenesis (lipolysis) or to direct hepatic activation of ketogenesis, the latter mechanism was examined in isolated rat hepatocytes. Incubation of hepatocytes with norepinephrine (10(-7) to 10(-4) M) resulted in a dose-dependent increase in conversion of the long-chain fatty acid [1-14C]palmitate into ketone bodies and CO2. Norepinephrine decreased [1-14C]palmitate conversion into triglycerides without affecting fatty acid uptake. Norepinephrine enhanced ketogenesis from [1-14C]palmitate in a physiologic range of fatty acid concentrations (0.5-2.5 mM), but failed to affect fatty acid esterification to phospholipids or mono- and diglycerides. In contrast to long-chain fatty acids, oxidation of the medium-chain fatty acid [1-14C]octanoate to ketone bodies was not enhanced by norepinephrine, whereas CO2 production increased. The effect of norepinephrine on [1-14C]fatty acid oxidation was blocked by the alpha 1 receptor blocker prazosin. The results demonstrate that norepinephrine diverts long-chain fatty acids into the pathways of oxidation and ketogenesis away from esterification, suggesting enhanced carnitine-dependent mitochondrial fatty acid uptake. The studies using octanoate indicated that norepinephrine also enhanced fatty acid oxidation by increasing the flux of acetyl-CoA through the Krebs cycle. The data suggest that stress-associated sympathetic activation and norepinephrine discharge, as observed in diabetic ketoacidosis, result in direct activation of ketogenesis in the liver.", 
    "8": "We evaluated the long-term antihypertensive effects of ketanserin, a selective serotonin2-receptor blocker with weak adrenergic receptor blocker properties. Ketanserin was given alone, 40 mg o.d. or b.i.d., for 2 years to 12 patients with essential hypertension. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures (BPs) were significantly reduced 14 days after the start of therapy and remained lowered during the 2-year follow-up period. In a larger group of patients who received ketanserin monotherapy for 2 to 3 months, the response to therapy varied considerably between subjects, with an overall response rate (BP less than 165/95 mm Hg) of 60% to 75%. During steady-state conditions, the maximum and minimum ketanserin plasma concentrations varied from threefold to fourfold between subjects and did not correlate with individual reductions in BP, but for each individual there was a positive correlation between BP reduction and ketanserin plasma concentration throughout a study day. In combination with beta-blockers, ketanserin effectively reduced BP in the supine and standing positions. The plasma concentration profile was not altered as much during combination therapy as when ketanserin was given alone. Side effects were few and tolerable. Ketanserin effectively reduces BP both alone and in combination with beta-blockers and may be still another drug useful in the treatment of essential hypertension.", 
    "9": "Empirical studies suggest the following main conclusions: functional somatic symptoms are extremely common; a large proportion appear to be caused by physiologic activity and tend to be aggravated by emotion. Hypochondriacal patients misunderstand the nature and significance of these symptoms and believe that they are evidence of serious disease. Hypochondriasis can be a part of another syndrome, usually an affective one, or it can be a primary disorder. The prevalence differs between cultures and social classes. Constitutional factors, disease in the family in childhood, and previous disease predispose to hypochondriasis. Various stressors can be precipitating events. Selective perception of symptoms, motivated by fear of disease, and subsequent increase in anxiety with more somatic symptoms appear to be links in the vicious cycle of the hypochondriacal reaction. Psychotherapy as well as psychotropic drugs are effective in the treatment of functional somatic symptoms. There are no adequate controlled studies of psychotherapy in hypochondriasis, and the recommended treatments are based on studies with similar disorders. The prognosis of treated hypochondriasis is good in a substantial proportion of patients.", 
    "10": "The amylase secretion in vivo was examined in the rat parotid gland. A comparison was made between individual stimulation of sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves and simultaneous activation of both nerves. When sympathetic stimulation was superimposed on a parasympathetic background activity, amylase secretion was elicited at a frequency far below the threshold for secretion of fluid, and increased in a frequency-dependent way. This augmented amylase secretion, seen when the two nerves were activated at the same time, gave an amylase output which far exceeded the sum obtained at individual nerve stimulation. The sympathetic amylase secretion obtained in a background of parasympathetic activity seemed to be dependent entirely on beta 1-adrenoceptors. When high sympathetic stimulation frequency (3-10 Hz) was used a reduction in salivary flow was seen, which was accompanied by a reduced amylase output. This effect was counteracted by alpha-adrenoceptor blockade. Isoprenaline, injected intravenously during an ongoing parasympathetic activity, was found to evoke an augmented amylase secretion in a similar way as sympathetic nerve stimulation.", 
    "11": "Secretion of 3H-noradrenaline was evoked by electrical field stimulation (1 Hz, 300 shocks) in guinea-pig ileum myenteric plexus. The role of cyclic nucleotides in the presynaptic receptor-mediated control of 3H-noradrenaline secretion was studied. The secretion of 3H-noradrenaline was maximally enhanced to the same extent, viz. 300-400% of control, by two analogues of cyclic AMP (8-Br cyclic AMP and dibutyryl cyclic AMP), by an adenylate cyclase activator (forskolin) and by three structurally different inhibitors of phosphodiesterase (3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, SQ 20,006 and Ro 20-1724), but not altered by two analogues of cyclic GMP (8-Br cyclic GMP and dibutyryl cyclic GMP). Added separately an alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist (yohimbine) and a beta-adrenoceptor agonist (isoprenaline) enhanced the 3H-noradrenaline secretion. Yohimbine, but not isoprenaline, increased additively the 'maximal enhancement' of the 3H-noradrenaline secretion caused by 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. These results suggest that neuronal cyclic AMP may be involved in beta- but not in alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated control of 3H-noradrenaline secretion in guinea-pig ileum myenteric nerve terminals.", 
    "12": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system plays a central role in electrolyte homeostasis and in the regulation of arterial blood pressure. The level of activity of this system is determined primarily by the rate at which the kidneys secrete renin into the blood. Although many factors affect renin secretion in vivo, it is certain that all extracellular first messengers affect the activity of the renin-secreting cell by altering its intracellular concentrations of only a few second messengers. The thesis of this review is that free ionic calcium (Ca2+) and cAMP are inhibitory and stimulatory second messengers in renin secretion and that Ca2+ is preeminent. In general, intracellular Ca2+ is controlled by two mechanisms of Ca2+ efflux (Na-Ca exchange; primary active Ca2+ transport) and two mechanisms of Ca2+ influx and/or mobilization (voltage-sensitive Ca channels; receptor-operated channels). There is evidence to suggest that first messengers affect intracellular Ca2+, and therefore renin secretion, by affecting these efflux, influx, and mobilization pathways.", 
    "13": "The effects of dimethylpropranolol (UM-272) on transmembrane action potentials were examined in isolated right ventricular papillary muscles of the guinea pig. UM-272 (10(-5) to 3 X 10(-4) M) caused a dose-dependent decrease in the Vmax of the action potential. At 3 X 10(-4) M, a slight decrease in the amplitude of action potential was also observed. The resting potential and the action potential duration were not affected by the drug. In the presence of UM-272, trains of stimuli at rates higher than 0.1 Hz led to an exponential decline in Vmax (onset rate, 0.13-0.28 per action potential) to a new plateau level. This use-dependent block was augmented at the higher stimulation frequency. The time constant for the recovery of Vmax from the use-dependent block (offset) was 7.1 to 7.3 sec. In depolarized papillary muscles with 8 or 10 Mm [K+]0, the inhibitory action of UM-272 on Vmax of the first action potential after a long quiescent period (tonic block) was augmented markedly, but the rates of onset and offset of the use-dependent block were similar to those in normally polarized preparations under 5 mM [K+]0. The curves relating membrane potential and Vmax in preparations stimulated infrequently were shifted by 7.2 mV with UM-272 at 10(-4) M in the direction of more negative potentials. These findings suggest that UM-272 has kinetically similar use-dependent inhibitory action of the fast sodium channels of cardiac muscles as other Class Ia antiarrhythmic drugs like quinidine or procainamide.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "14": "The beta-adrenergic receptor was characterized on BCG-activated rat peritoneal macrophage membranes by radio-ligand binding studies. Saturable binding with [125I]iodocyanopindolol (125I-ICYP) was demonstrated. With Scatchard analysis, rat macrophages demonstrate approximately 1000 receptors per cell with a Kd of 5 X 10(-11) M for 125I-ICYP. Competition curves with (-) and (+) propranolol at concentrations below 10(-6) M confirmed stereospecificity. The potency of various ligands to compete for 125I-ICYP binding sites followed the order: propranolol greater than isoproterenol greater than epinephrine greater than norepinephrine with apparent Kd of 2.0 X 10(-9), 3.9 X 10(-7), 1.0 X 10(-5), and 2.5 X 10(-5) M, respectively. Isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was two-fold above basal activity. The potential physiologic significance of a beta-adrenergic receptor on rat peritoneal macrophages was suggested by a dose-dependent decrease in phagocytosis of soluble, model immune complexes (aggregated gamma-globulin) by macrophages incubated with metaproterenol. We conclude that the rat macrophage has a beta-adrenergic receptor and that catecholamines may thereby modulate macrophage function.", 
    "15": "Profound alterations in the microsomal fatty acyl-CoA desaturase activities and cyclic AMP production of a unicellular eukaryote, Tetrahymena pyriformis NT-1, originally grown in the glucose-deficient medium, were observed, following the administration of glucose or beta-adrenergic agonists such as epinephrine and isoproterenol. There was a great increase of stearoyl-CoA (delta 8) desaturase activity coincident with a 2-fold decrease of oleoyl-CoA (delta 12) desaturase activity over the first 2 h after administration of these compounds. During this period of time, it was found that the production in vivo of labeled oleic acid from [14C]acetic or [3H]palmitic acid increases 2-fold and the formation in vivo of each labeled linoleic and gamma-linolenic acids drastically decreases. Glucose or beta-adrenergic agonists caused an increase of stearoyl-CoA-stimulated reoxidation rate of NADH-reduced cytochrome b5 but depressed oleoyl-CoA-stimulated reoxidation rate of b5, indicating that both desaturase activities are controlled by the respective terminal components of the desaturase system. A significant and reproducible increase of adenylate cyclase activity and a slight decrease of cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase activity were observed to occur within the first 2 h after the addition of these compounds, when cyclic AMP content in Tetrahymena cell rose by 3-4-fold. Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocker, abolished the effects of glucose or beta-adrenergic agonists on the activities of fatty acyl-CoA desaturases and the terminal components as well as cyclic AMP production of cells. These results suggest that glucose and beta-adrenergic agonists may modulate the microsomal fatty acyl-CoA desaturase system in Tetrahymena by acting through the increase of intracellular cyclic AMP content.", 
    "16": "When rats were exposed to immobilization stress for 1-12 h, gastric lesions did not occur at 1-6 h but did at 12 h of immobilization. Exogenous adenosine increased stress-induced gastric lesions, and dipyridamole, a blocker of adenosine uptake, potentiated the action of adenosine. The selective adenosine A1-receptor stimulants N6-cyclohexyl adenosine (CHA) and N6-(L-phenylisopropyl) adenosine (L-PIA) produced gastric lesions even in non-stressed state and markedly potentiated in dose- and time-dependent manner in stressed state. The stimulatory effect of N6-(D-phenylisopropyl) adenosine (D-PIA) on ulceration was weaker than that of CHA or L-PIA. Furthermore, intracerebral ventricular (i.c.v.) injection of adenosine or adenosine analogues produced the most rapid and most potent exacerbation of stress-induced gastric lesions relative to those induced with subcutaneous (s.c.) injection. The stress lesions enhanced by CHA were not affected by phentolamine, yohimbine, prazosin, naloxone and cholecystokinin (CCK8) but were inhibited by caffeine, clonidine, morphine and beta-endorphin. The inhibitory effect of clonidine was not antagonized by yohimbine or prazosin. The inhibition by morphine was selectively antagonized by exogenous CCK8 as well as naloxone. These results suggest that endogenous adenosine is tonically active in stress lesion formation which is modulated by opiate systems. Clonidine as well as caffeine may function as a purinoceptor antagonist, and it seems unlikely that the inhibitory effect of clonidine on stress ulcer is due to activation of alpha-adrenoceptors.", 
    "17": "Two forms of cytochrome P-450 were purified to apparent homogeneity from several different preparations of human liver microsomes. One form, designated P-450DB, had relatively high catalytic activity towards the drugs debrisoquine, sparteine, bufuralol (both the (+)- and (-)-isomers), encainide, and propranolol and appears to be the enzyme involved in the polymorphic distribution of oxidative activities towards these substrates in humans. The other form, designated P-450PA, had relatively high phenacetin O-deethylase activity and appears to be involved in the variation of this activity among humans. Polyclonal antibodies raised to the two enzymes were specific for the antigens as judged by immunoelectrophoresis and immuno-inhibition studies. The two enzymes and their activities were distinguished by chromatographic separation, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, amino acid composition, immuno-inhibition studies, and steady-state kinetic assays. Immunochemical studies suggest that each form represents only a small fraction of the total cytochrome P-450 in human liver microsomes. These biochemical studies provide a basis for better understanding the mechanisms which underlie genetic polymorphisms involving P-450 cytochromes in humans.", 
    "18": "The role of gluconeogenesis on the increase in plasma glucose and liver glycogen of rats exposed to hyper-G (radial acceleration) stress was determined. Overnight-fasted, male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 g) were injected i.p. with uniformly labeled 1 4C lactate, alanine, or glycerol (5 microCi/rat) and immediately exposed to 3.1G for 0.25, 0.50, and 1.0 hr. 1 4C incorporation of the labeled substrates into plasma glucose and liver glycogen was measured and compared to uncentrifuged control rats injected in a similar manner. Significant increases in 1 4C incorporation of all three labeled substrates into plasma glucose were observed in centrifuged rats at all exposure periods; 1 4C incorporation into liver glycogen was significantly increased only at 0.50 and 1.0 hr. The i.p. administration (5 mg/100-g body wt) of 5-methoxyindole-2-carboxylic acid, a potent gluconeogenesis inhibitor, prior to centrifugation blocked the increase in plasma glucose and liver glycogen during the first hour of centrifugation. The increase in plasma glucose and liver glycogen was also abolished in adreno-demedullated rats exposed to centrifugation for 1.0 hr. Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocker, suppressed the increase in plasma glucose of rats exposed to centrifugation for 0.25 hr. From the results of this study, it is concluded that the initial, rapid rise in plasma glucose as well as the increase in liver glycogen of rats exposed to hyper-G stress can be attributed to an increased rate of gluconeogenesis, and that epinephrine plays a dominant role during the early stages of exposure to centrifugation.", 
    "19": "Primary astrocyte cultures from neonatal rat cerebral hemispheres were treated chronically for up to 3 weeks with the tricyclic antidepressants amitryptyline (AMT) or desipramine (DMI), or acutely with AMT and DMI added at the same time as the agonist, norepinephrine (NE). AMT and DMI were added at concentrations from 10(-9) to 10(-5) M. Both types of treatment did not decrease the increase in cyclic AMP (cAMP) content of these cells in response to a 10 min exposure to 10(-5) M NE. Chronic exposure to the antidepressants also did not affect stimulation of cAMP by isoproterenol (iso) in both rat and mouse primary astrocyte cultures. In contrast to the lack of effect of the tricyclic antidepressants pretreatment of the cultures with 10(-5) M NE resulted in total inhibition of the cAMP response after 2 h, with a 50% decrease occurring in about 45 min. This is similar to the agonist-induced desensitization of the beta-receptor-adenylate cyclase system seen in many other cells. This effect could, in part, be a direct response to increased intracellular cAMP since pretreatment with 0.25 and 1.0 mM N6-2'-O-dibutyryl cAMP (DBcAMP) also resulted in total inhibition of the cAMP response after 4 h. Receptor labelling experiments using [125I]cyanopindolol showed no decreases in apparent binding sites up to 3 h after exposure to 10(-5) M norepinephrine, suggesting that the rapid desensitization of the cAMP response was primarily due to an uncoupling of the receptor from the adenyl cyclase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "20": "The pattern of pulsatile secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) is affected by the circulating gonadal hormone levels. In the rat the frequency and amplitude of the LH pulse increase after ovariectomy and decrease after estrogen replacement. Since estrogen is known to affect the catecholaminergic activities in the rat hypothalamus, the present study examined whether the catecholaminergic mechanisms are involved in the estrogen-induced suppression of pulsatile LH secretion. Recently, we have elucidated that the preoptic suprachiasmatic area (POSC) is a specific site of action of estradiol in reducing the LH pulse frequency. Subsequently, in this paper, we report the effects of various catecholamine synthesis inhibitors and synaptic blockers on the basal pulsatile LH secretion and on the frequency suppression induced by local implantation of EB in the POSC. Female rats of the Wistar strain were ovariectomized about 4 weeks before the experiment. Blood samples were obtained at 6-min intervals for 4 h without anesthesia through the indwelling atrial catheter. The rats were given i.p. injection with the drug or the vehicle 1 or 3h before bleeding. The steroid was implanted into the POSC via the chronically-implanted cannula 1 h after the initiation of the bleeding. Serum LH concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay. The following results were obtained. EB implantation into the POSC suppressed the frequency of existing pulsatile LH secretion in vehicle-treated rats. Pretreatment of the rat with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (AMPT), AMPT + threo-dihydroxyphenylserine (DOPS) or pimozide did not affect the basal pulsatile LH secretion but prevented suppressive effect of EB implantation on the LH pulse frequency. In rats pretreated with diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC) or phenoxybenzamine the basal pulsatile LH secretion was abolished. Further suppression by EB implantation was not clear. Pretreatment of the rats with propranolol did not affect the basal pulsatile LH secretion nor the EB-induced suppression of the LH pulse frequency. These results support the hypothesis that the alpha-adrenergic mechanism is required for maintaining the basal pulsatile LH secretion in ovariectomized rats. Furthermore, the dopaminergic system is obligatorily necessary for the manifestation of the inhibitory action of EB implanted in the POSC on the LH pulse frequency.", 
    "21": "We have tested several compounds interfering with the brain monoamine (noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin) and acetylcholine systems for their effects on limbic seizures produced by systemically (s.c.) injected kainic acid as well as on neurochemical changes in amygdala/pyriform cortex resulting from the kainic acid treatment. The characteristic neurochemical changes induced by s.c. kainic acid were a decrease in noradrenaline and an increase in 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in the acute (3 h after kainic acid injection) suggesting strongly increased neurotransmitter turnover in noradrenergic and serotonergic neurons. This was followed by a reduction of glutamic acid decarboxylase and choline acetyltransferase activities during the chronic phase (3 days) of the kainic acid action, indicating destruction of GABAergic and cholinergic neurons. The compounds tested in this model of limbic epilepsy included 1-propranolol, prazosin, clonidine, yohimbine, metergoline, atropine and haloperidol. Among these compounds the alpha 2-adrenergic agonist clonidine (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) exhibited a powerful protective action on kainic acid-induced limbic seizures as well as on the neurochemical changes in the amygdala and pyriform cortex. In addition, the adrenoceptor antagonists prazosin (alpha 1) and propranolol (beta) as well as the dopamine receptor antagonist haloperidol had significant but less potent - protective actions upon kainic acid-induced seizures and subsequent neurochemical changes. On the other hand, yohimbine (alpha 2-antagonist) and metergoline (serotonin-antagonist) potentiated the limbic seizure syndrome and no effect was found with atropine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "22": "Exploratory behaviour was measured in the open-field at 8.00 h and 20.00 h with naive rats and rats treated with an alpha 1-agonist (phenylephrine, 25 micrograms i.c.v.) or beta-agonists (salbutamol, 2.5 mg/kg; clenbuterol 0.05 mg/kg i.p.). The spontaneous activity was similar at both times, yet the response to a alpha 1-as well as to beta-stimulation was significantly enhanced at 20.00 h. The density of cortical [3H]prazosin and [3H]dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA) binding sites at 20.00 h was enhanced by 19% and 28% respectively, in comparison with the density measured at 8.00 h.", 
    "23": "The binding of (-)-[125I]pindolol ((-)-[125I]PIN) to human platelet membranes has been examined and identifies a relatively low density of beta-adrenoceptor binding sites in this tissue. The relative order of potency of the catecholamines in displacement experiments, isoprenaline greater than adrenaline greater than noradrenaline and curve-fitting analysis of the competition binding isotherms using subtype selective beta-adrenergic antagonists, suggests the presence of an homogeneous population of beta 2-adrenoceptors. The effects of guanine nucleotides and mono- and divalent cations on the isoprenaline displacement of (-)-[125I]PIN binding to human platelet and rat lung membrane beta-adrenoceptors was compared in parallel experiments. In the presence of Mg2+ the agonist showed relatively lower overall affinity for the platelet receptor with a steep displacement curve, Hill slope approaching unity. Under these circumstances Gpp(NH)p characteristically produced a shift to the right and a steepening of the agonist displacement curve in rat lung but had no effect in platelet membranes. NaCl caused a parallel shift to the right of the curves in both systems in the presence or absence of Gpp(NH)p. The significance of these results in relationship to the efficiency of coupling of the human platelet beta-adrenoceptor to adenylate cyclase is discussed.", 
    "24": "The 2-hydroxylation of desmethylimipramine (DMI) correlates strongly with the 4-hydroxylation of debrisoquine (D) both in human volunteers and in vitro comparing human liver microsomes from different individuals. D competitively inhibits the 2-hydroxylation of DMI in vitro suggesting that DMI is hydroxylated by the 'debrisoquine hydroxylase' which is under monogenic control in man. We have characterized the effect of drugs on the hydroxylation of DMI in human liver microsomes by measuring the formation of 2-OH-DMI with HPLC using fluorescence detection. Amitriptyline, nortriptyline and metoprolol inhibited the hydroxylation of DMI competitively indicating interaction with the catalytical site for DMI 2-hydroxylation. Antipyrine and amylobarbitone at concentrations similar to their Km-values for metabolism did not inhibit DMI-hydroxylation. Thus, for these compounds there was a good correspondence between the drugs' capacity to inhibit DMI 2-hydroxylation competitively in vitro and their apparent metabolism by the 'debrisoquine hydroxylase' in vivo in man. Thioridazine, chlorpromazine, quinidine and quinine also inhibited DMI-hydroxylation competitively. Thioridazine was an unusually potent inhibitor (apparent inhibition constant Ki = 0.75 microM). Quinidine was also an unusually potent inhibitor (Ki = 0.27 microM) and much more efficient than its isomer quinine (Ki = 12 microM). Theophylline could inhibit DMI hydroxylation but with atypical kinetics. We suggest that this simple DMI in vitro test as well as earlier described inhibition tests with debrisoquine, sparteine and bufuralol can be used to screen if drugs interact with the 'debrisoquine hydroxylase' in human liver.", 
    "25": "The in vitro perfused rabbit ovary preparation was used to examine the role of calcium in the ovulatory process. Two groups of rabbits were studied. In the first group, verapamil hydrochloride (10(-4) mol/L), a calcium channel blocker, was used together with human chorionic gonadotropin (50 IU) in the perfusate. Verapamil had no apparent effect on human chorionic gonadotropin-induced ovulation. Verapamil treatment, however, significantly reduced the percentage of ovulated ova that were mature (68.8%) in comparison to ovulated ova from human chorionic gonadotropin-treated control ovaries (95.0%). In a second experimental group, ethyleneglycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-n,n'-tetraacetic acid (2.0 mmol/L), a calcium ion chelator, was included in the perfusate with gonadotropin. The ethyleneglycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-n,n'-tetraacetic acid significantly reduced ovulatory efficiency (16.7% +/- 9.43%) in comparison to that of controls exposed to human chorionic gonadotropin alone (79.5% +/- 11.1%). In addition, ovulation occurred at an earlier time in ovaries perfused with ethyleneglycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-n,n'-tetraacetic acid; however, only four ovulations occurred in these ovaries. These four ovulated ova were immature, probably reflecting the early time of ovulation. Furthermore, both verapamil and ethyleneglycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-n,n'-tetraacetic acid blocked ovarian smooth muscle contractions during ovarian perfusion. These data provide additional support for the concept that calcium dynamics influence the processes of ovulation and ovum maturation. Furthermore ovarian smooth muscle contractions do not appear to be essential for ovulation in this model.", 
    "26": "The answer to how the beta-adrenergic receptor mediates a fall in intraocular pressure has been elusive. Methods of measurement have not been refined sufficiently. The separate changes after adrenergic treatment frequently are small, and the tissue effects are multiple. On a molecular basis, stimulation of the beta-adrenergic receptor activates intracellular adenylate cyclase to produce increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate. Acting by different cell-receptor mechanisms, but nonetheless potent, nonadrenergic stimulators of adenylate cyclase in the ciliary epithelium, such as cholera toxin and organic fluorides, have been studied in experimental animals. They reduce intraocular pressure by reducing net aqueous flow. When forskolin, a diterpene and potent stimulator of adenylate cyclase, became available, it was used in noninvasive topical form in the human eye to clarify the question of whether increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate reduces intraocular pressure and aqueous flow. Noninvasive studies in human eyes have demonstrated a 35% reduction in outflow pressure after the administration of forskolin in a 1% topical suspension, matched by a corresponding reduction in aqueous flow. Tonographic outflow facility was unaltered. Thus, the entire reduction in intraocular pressure can be accounted for by a reduction in net aqueous flow.", 
    "27": "The main aim of the trial was to determine whether drug treatment of mild hypertension (phase V diastolic pressure 90-109 mm Hg) reduced the rates of stroke, of death due to hypertension, and of coronary events in men and women aged 35-64 years. Subsidiary aims were: to compare the course of blood pressure in two groups, one taking bendrofluazide and one taking propranolol, and to compare the incidence of suspected adverse reactions to these two drugs. The study was single blind and based almost entirely in general practices; 17 354 patients were recruited, and 85 572 patient years of observation have accrued. Patients were randomly allocated at entry to take bendrofluazide or propranolol or placebo tablets. The primary results were as follows. The stroke rate was reduced on active treatment: 60 strokes occurred in the treated group and 109 in the placebo group, giving rates of 1.4 and 2.6 per 1000 patient years of observation respectively (p less than 0.01 on sequential analysis). Treatment made no difference, however, to the overall rates of coronary events: 222 events occurred on active treatment and 234 in the placebo group (5.2 and 5.5 per 1000 patient years respectively). The incidence of all cardiovascular events was reduced on active treatment: 286 events occurred in the treated group and 352 in the placebo group, giving rates of 6.7 and 8.2 per 1000 patient years respectively (p less than 0.05 on sequential analysis). For mortality from all causes treatment made no difference to the rates. There were 248 deaths in the treated group and 253 in the placebo group (rates 5.8 and 5.9 per 1000 patient years respectively). Several post hoc analyses of subgroup results were also performed but they require very cautious interpretation. The all cause mortality was reduced in men on active treatment (157 deaths versus 181 in the placebo group; 7.1 and 8.2 per 1000 patient years respectively) but increased in women on active treatment (91 deaths versus 72; 4.4 and 3.5 per 1000 patient years respectively). The difference between the sexes in their response to treatment was significant (p = 0.05). Comparison of the two active drugs showed that the reduction in stroke rate on bendrofluazide was greater than that on propranolol (p = 0.002). The stroke rate was reduced in both smokers and non-smokers taking bendrofluazide but only in non-smokers taking propranolol. This difference between the responses to the two drugs was significant (p = 0.03).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "28": "20 patients with idiopathic complex ventricular arrhythmias received propafenone 450 mg/d, disopyramide 600 mg/d and metoprolol 100 mg/d. Before commencement of the 3-week treatment period the 95% normal range for spontaneous changes in ventricular extrasystoles (VES), as couplets and runs, were determined from three 24 h-ECG recordings in each patient under drug-free conditions. A drug effect was assumed when the rate of VES/24 h for the control period decreased by greater than or equal to 83.5% or increased by greater than or equal to 505% in the test period. The frequency dependent normal range for couplets varied between a decrease from 100% to 92% (greater than or equal to 16 to greater than or equal to 44/d) and an increase from 650% to 1000% (greater than or equal to 3 to greater than or equal to 38/d) and for runs between a decrease from 100% to 85% (greater than or equal to 6 to 32/d) and an increase from 600% to 1000% (greater than or equal to 1 to 14/d). A decrease in all rhythm disturbances under the action of the 3 drugs could be shown for the whole group (P less than 0.01). On the basis of the calculated normal range, ventricular extrasystoles in the patients decreased significantly by 26-37%, couplets by 13-33% and runs by 0-55% depending to the drug. A drug dependent arrhythmogenic effect occurred in 4 patients. A preference for one or other of the drugs could not be established statistically.", 
    "29": "Mice were trained in a 1-trial inhibitory avoidance task (0.7 mA FS) and tested for retention at 1, 3, or 6 h following training. Posttraining beta-endorphin (0.1 micrograms/mouse i.p.) administration impaired retention at 6 h, but not 1 or 3 h after training. Propranolol (0.3 mg/mouse i.p.), but not naloxone (0.1 mg/mouse i.p.) administered prior to retention testing at 1 or 3 h accelerated the onset of amnesia in mice given posttraining beta-endorphin. Neither propranolol nor naloxone affected retention when given alone. These findings suggest that the delayed onset of the amnesia produced by posttraining beta-endorphin is due to the activation of a beta-adrenergic system.", 
    "30": "A comparative, controlled, open hypertension study using the direct vasodilator endralazine and the ACE-inhibitor captopril in combined therapy for severe and moderately severe hypertension is described. Both vasodilators cause an approximately 20% reduction in supine and upright blood pressure. Extreme side effects such as hematological alterations, autoimmune states or uncontrollable water retention were not observed. Subjective symptoms, particularly severe headaches, were especially evident after endralazine use. This side effect may possibly be eliminated by gradual titration over several weeks.", 
    "31": "Although hypertension is the most common and significant risk factor in pregnancy, the risks can be minimized with careful supervision and therapy. The mere presence of hypertension, even of severe hypertension, is neither a contraindication to pregnancy nor an indication for the termination of pregnancy, provided that appropriate management principles are applied. For optimum management, the skills of the obstetrician, the physician and, later in pregnancy, of the neonatologist should all be employed to the full. The ability to monitor the fetus closely, and to offer intensive care to the premature newborn, is critical in making decisions about the timing and mode of delivery. These women, as all other women with high-risk pregnancies, should be receiving treatment in centres which can offer adequate care both to the mother and to the baby.", 
    "32": "The turkey erythrocyte beta 1-adrenergic receptor can be purified by affinity chromatography on alprenolol-Sepharose and characterized by photoaffinity labeling with N-(p-azido-m-[125I]iodobenzyl)-carazolol. Through the use of the specific glycosidases neuraminidase and endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H and affinity chromatography on lectin-Sepharose gels, we show here that the receptor is an N-glycosyl protein that contains complex carbohydrate chains. No high-mannose carbohydrate chains appear to be present. The binding of the radiolabeled antagonist dihydroalprenolol to the receptor is affected neither by the enzymic treatments nor by the presence of lectins, suggesting that the carbohydrate moiety is not involved in the catecholamine binding site.", 
    "33": "The effects of naloxone and propranolol on cardiac arrhythmias and durations from respiratory arrest to ventricular asystole and cardiac standstill were studied in unanaesthetized young rats induced to suffer respiratory arrest and exhibit ventricular fibrillation (VF) by a modified chloroform hypoxia technique. Both naloxone and propranolol reduced the incidence of VF dose dependently, indicating that they have antiarrhythmic effects. Addition of naloxone to propranolol shifted the dose-response curve of propranolol to the left significantly, indicating an additive effect of the two drugs in their antiarrhythmic activity. Both naloxone and propranolol prolonged the duration from respiratory arrest to ventricular asystole. However, joint administration of both did not further prolong this duration indicating an absence of additive effects. Naloxone prolonged the duration from respiratory arrest to cardiac standstill, indicating that naloxone prolonged the survival time. In contrast, propranolol did not produce the same effect. That naloxone both produced antiarrhythmic effect and prolonged the survival time whereas propranolol only corrected cardiac arrhythmias suggests that the antiarrhythmic effect of naloxone may not result in prolongation of survival time and that different mechanisms may be involved in the antiarrhythmic effect.", 
    "34": "A pharmacokinetic model, with Michaelis-Menten elimination, has been developed for drugs and propranolol in particular. The theory is given and the relationship between the area under the theoretical plasma level curve and the absorption rate constant is discussed. This approach allows for an explanation of many of the observed pharmacokinetics of 'Inderal' and particularly 'Inderal' LA; a sustained release preparation of propranolol. In particular, the bioavailability, as measured by area under the curve, is found to be strongly dependent on the absorption half-life in agreement with experimentally observed data.",

    "36": "The pharmacokinetic parameters of nipradilol (NIP), a new potent antihypertensive and antianginal agent, and propranolol were determined after oral, intravenous and intraportal administration to the beagle dog implanted with cannula in portal vein at a dose of 1 mg/kg. Orally administered NIP underwent extensive first-pass metabolism leading to low bioavailability (11%), despite of complete gastrointestinal absorption. On the constant infusion for 30 min into the portal vein, hepatic extraction ratio was 0.71. The reduction in the systemic availability of orally administered NIP could partly be attributed to the fact that denitration and glucuronidation of NIP occur primarily in the intestinal tract and liver, respectively. Following oral administration of NIP, smaller amount of unchanged drug (1.9%) was excreted into the urine than that of intravenous administration (5.8%). However, in the qualitative and the quantitative aspects on urinary metabolic patterns, there was no appreciable influence of the route of administration. On the other hand, the systemic availability and the hepatic extraction ratio of propranolol were 11% and 0.86, respectively, suggesting that the first-pass metabolism through the liver actually contributes to the reduced availability.", 
    "37": "Bicycle ergometry was conducted in conjunction with the consecutive administration of the placebo, 80 mg anaprylin, 30 mg corinfar, and 80 mg anaprylin + 30 mg corinfar in patients with 2nd--4th class angina of effort. Both anaprylin and corinfar significantly raised patients' physical stress tolerance, increased the total amount of work done, and reduced the magnitude of St depression during exercise. Combined use of anaprylin and corinfar produced the greatest rise in physical stress tolerance in more favorable hemodynamic conditions. Bicycle ergometry in conjunction with anaprylin and corinfar can supply additional functional information on angina pectoris and its pathogenetic mechanisms.", 
    "38": "The effect of propranolol-finoptin combinations was examined in 27 patients with angina of effort. Repeated exercise testing showed this combination to provide an essential antianginal effect that exceeded a mere sum of individual effects of each of the two drugs taken alone in the same doses. The high anti-anginal effect of the combination is suggestive of a synergy in their antianginal action resulting in a further reduction of myocardial oxygen requirement. Side effects necessitating discontinuation of the drugs were only recorded during the early days of the treatment; therefore, patients should be adequately monitored during the first days of the regular use of this combination.", 
    "39": "In patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, clinical symptoms such as exertional dyspnea, angina and collapse are considered to be rather the consequence of diastolic than of systolic dysfunction of the left ventricle. Beta-blocker therapy is aimed at reducing systolic overcontraction while calcium blockers predominantly therapy is aimed at reducing systolic overcontraction while calcium blockers predominantly improve diastolic filling characteristics. Therefore 61 consecutive patients with well defined hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were treated with calcium channel blockers: 60 patients with verapamil at average dose 530 mg (320 to 720 mg/d) and one patient received 30 mg nifedipine. All patients had clinical, noninvasive and cardiac catheterization evaluation at the time of entry into the study. Therapy was continued for an average of 54 months (10 to 96). Follow-up studies were performed at 6-month intervals. Subjective improvement was achieved in 47 of 55 symptomatic patients (85%). Heart size, judged as heart volume from tele-chest X-ray in supine position, showed a reduction in 36/61, no change in 15/61 and increase in 10/61. On average in all 61 patients, a significant reduction from 947 to 833 ml/1.73 m2 was seen. Twenty-six patients who had been followed for an average of 24 months prior to verapamil therapy on beta blockers or no treatment had heart volume increases averaging 12% in the pre-verapamil period. Electrocardiography (ECG) showed a significant reduction in QRS amplitude and a tendency towards normalization of ST/T segments. Serial echocardiography study showed small but significant reduction in left atrial diameter. Repeat catheterization was performed in 19 patients and a significant reduction in intraventricular pressure gradient, left ventricular muscle mass and coronary artery diameter was demonstrated. Three patients died during the study (256 patient-treatment-years) for an annual mortality rate of 1.3%. This mortality is considerably lower than reported for patients receiving no treatment, beta-blockade, or surgery. Of all 61 patients only one had surgery related to the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. One patient had the dose of verapamil reduced because of the occurrence of heart block. No patient discontinued the drug because of side-effects. Utilizing serial noninvasive and invasive studies, we conclude that verapamil therapy in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy results in objective and subjective improvement, a low death rate and little need for operation as compared to standard therapy.", 
    "40": "The choice of initial therapy of hypertensive patients may be critical in the long-term efforts to reduce premature cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In the 1984 report of the third Joint National Committee (JNC), significant changes in the usual approach to initial therapy were suggested, including a more conservative approach toward the institution of drug therapy, more liberal use of nondrug therapies and broader choices for the initial drug. I support these changes and believe that even a greater number of choices for initial therapy should be considered. I am increasingly concerned about the hazards of diuretic therapy and believe that for most patients, an adrenergic inhibitor is preferable for first drug. Rather than limit the type of adrenergic inhibitor to a beta blocker as suggested in the JNC report, either an alpha blocker or a centrally acting drug may be preferable. In the near future, calcium antagonists will likely also become logical choices.", 
    "41": "Echocardiographic (E) assessment of left ventricular response to increases (I) and decreases (D) in preload of 9 volunteer male subjects (mean age 25 +/- 2.0 years) was made during both control (C) and cardiac blocked (B) conditions. Cardiac autonomic blockade was produced by intravenous administration of atropine (0.04 mg/kg) and propranolol (0.2 mg/kg), while I was produced by 5 degrees head-down tilt (T) for 90 min and D by lower body negative pressure to -40 Torr. Increases in resting heart rate of 44% and diastolic blood pressure of 13% occurred after B, (P less than 0.05). During C, the alterations in preload produced mean changes in end-diastolic volume (EDV) ranging from 135 +/- 10 cm3 for I to 96 +/- 9.1 cm3 for D. Changes in stroke volume during condition C were significantly related to changes in EDV during preload alterations and conformed to a normal LV function curve and were described by SV = 0.6 EDV + 4.5 cm3 (r = 0.85; P less than 0.001). Similarly during B, SV = 0.43 EDV + 5.8 cm3 (r = 0.75; P less than 0.001). Comparison of the LV function curves produced during C and B showed that both slope of regression and r were significantly different (P less than 0.01). These data indicate that cardiac autonomic blockade produces a downward shift in the LV function curve indicating a depression in myocardial contractility. In addition, the data indicate that changes observed in LV function during wide variations in preload are independent of autonomic nervous system influences and are independent of the intrinsic heart rate.", 
    "42": "The relationship between indenolol (an investigational agent) plasma levels and the drug's effect on blood pressure and heart rate was investigated after single and repeated once daily administration at two dosage levels (60 mg and 120 mg) in two different groups of patients with first or second stage hypertension, according to the World Health Organization classification. The pharmacokinetic data were indicative of a first order absorption-elimination curve; time of maximum plasma levels was 1.5 to two hours, and elimination half-life was four hours. The drug did not accumulate in the central compartment after repeated administrations. A long-lasting decrease of both resting and isometric exercise systolic pressure values was recorded after acute indenolol administration. Diastolic pressure was affected only by repeated administrations. The lower dose (60 mg daily) of indenolol did not affect heart rate, whereas the higher dose (120 mg daily) decreased this parameter. A steady state of pressure values and heart rate was reached after 14 days of once daily treatment.", 
    "43": "The antihypertensive efficacy of a new agent, indenolol, was compared with that of the well-established antihypertensive drug, metoprolol, and its hemodynamic effects were investigated using echocardiography. Eighteen hypertensives completed a double-blind, crossover, randomized study using indenolol and metoprolol. Two four-week courses with indenolol or metoprolol were preceded and followed by a two-week placebo period; the total duration of the study was 14 weeks. Indenolol proved to be significantly more effective than metoprolol in decreasing blood pressure values at rest (P less than .05). Furthermore, three patients that failed with metoprolol were successfully treated with indenolol. Both drugs induced a significant decrease in cardiac output that was mediated mainly through a reduction in heart rate, because stroke volume, left ventricle circumferential fiber shortening velocity, and ejection fraction were not significantly reduced by either drug. However, after indenolol, a significant direct relationship was found between the basal values of both cardiac output (r = .809) and total peripheral resistance (r = .800), and the reduction of these parameters. On the contrary, after metoprolol only, the correlation between the basal value of cardiac output and its reduction was significant (r = .790).", 
    "44": "Cats, anaesthetized with alpha-chloralose, were used to investigate an interaction between the baroreceptor reflex and stimulation of the anterior hypothalamus (AH). In these cats, stimulation of the anterior hypothalamus gave autonomic responses that characterize the defense reaction. Stimulation of the anterior hypothalamus also interacted with the baroreceptor reflex without altering the effectiveness of the vasodepressor component of the reflex (induced by stimulation of the aortic nerves). However, in spinal cats the bradycardia component (induced by angiotensin at 0.097 nmol/kg pe min, i.v.) was inhibited by stimulation of the anterior hypothalamus and the inhibition was augmented by pretreatment with phentolamine (17.7 nmol) in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS). Pretreatment with phentolamine (17.7 nmol) in the nucleus tractus solitarius also reduced the sensitivity of the bradycardia component of the reflex and attenuated (3 and 6 nmol) the induced inhibition of the bradycardia induced by stimulation of the anterior hypothalamus. This attenuation induced by NE was abolished by pretreatment with phentolamine (17.7 nmol), but not by pretreatment with sotalol (16 nmol) or haloperidol (12 nmol) in the nucleus tractus solitarius. Additionally, NE was released from the nucleus tractus solitarius during activation of the baroreceptor and during stimulation of the anterior hypothalamus in cats with intact baroreceptor nerves, but not in baroreceptor-denervated cats. Moreover, the baroreceptor reflex attenuated the pressor response evoked by stimulation of the anterior hypothalamus, and also caused the release of NE from the anterior hypothalamus. At this site, injection of NE (3 and 6 nmol) attenuated the pressor response evoked by stimulation of the anterior hypothalamus and this attenuation was abolished by pretreatment with phentolamine (17.7 nmol), but not by pretreatment with sotalol (16 nmol) or haloperidol (12 nmol) in the anterior hypothalamus. It is concluded that NE participates at the nucleus tractus solitarius and the anterior hypothalamus as an attenuator in the interaction between the baroreflex and stimulation of nerve fibers in the anterior hypothalamus that mediate the defense reaction.", 
    "45": "Prizidilol (SK&F 92657-A2 X H2O) is the dihydrochloride salt of D,L-3-[2-(3-t-butylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy)phenyl]-6-hydrazinopyridazi ne, a molecule combining the properties of precapillary vasodilatation and beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Prizidilol was administered to baboons daily for up to 1 year at sustained doses up to 800 mg/kg. During the 16th week of a 26-week study ophthalmoscopic examination revealed an orange tinge at the periphery of the normally pale pink optic disc in all high-dose (800-1225 mg/kg) baboons. The colour became more intense as the study progressed. By week 25 orange discolouration was seen in all baboons at 350 mg/kg and three out of six baboons at 100 mg/kg. The findings, except those at 100 mg/kg, were confirmed in a 12-month study. Optic disc discolouration was correlated with darkening of internal organs at necropsy. Discolouration of the optic disc did not appear to affect visual function. Slow regression of discolouration was demonstrated after withdrawal of treatment with 800 mg of prizidilol/kg at 6 months. No histological abnormalities were present in the optic discs of affected baboons. The study demonstrates the value of regular ophthalmoscopy in toxicity studies, combining the facility for the early detection of an unusual lesion with the ability to follow its time-course.", 
    "46": "There is a group of patients who presents with intense anxiety and physical complaints suggestive of cardiac or gastrointestinal disease. These patients are more commonly women and complain of palpitations, lightheadedness, chest pains, and dyspnea. A work-up may reveal positive findings such as extrasystoles and mitral valve prolapse that appear to confirm the organic etiology of the symptoms. Evidence is presented that the positive findings serve to confuse the picture and are an impediment, rather than an aid, to the physician in making the correct diagnosis. Effective treatment using tricyclic antidepressants or monoamine oxidase inhibitors is suggested.", 
    "47": "Continuous intra-arterial blood pressure measurement and electrocardiograms were obtained in two ambulatory patients with orthostatic hypotension due to autonomic dysfunction. Systolic and diastolic arterial pressure presented marked variations which took place mainly during the day and were related to several physical activities; however, marked falls in blood pressure were also observed during sleep and at the moment of arousal. A peak incidence of hypotensive events was found in the afternoon, mainly in the hours following the afternoon meal. Recording was repeated after 3 weeks of treatment with propranolol, 40 mg t.i.d. In patient 1, beta blockade drastically reduced the number and severity of hypotensive episodes, while propranolol failed to control blood pressure in patient 2, who experienced a higher number of hypotensive events during treatment. Findings of this study may be relevant to the management of patients with orthostatic hypotension and should contribute to a more accurate characterization of blood pressure profile in autonomic dysfunction.", 
    "48": "Aphthous lesions of the oral mucosa were simulated in dogs by common bile duct ligation. In one of the experimental groups, the animals were administered the beta-adrenoblocker obsidan 30 min before operation. Two hours after operation the regions of the oral mucosa mostly affected by aphthous lesions were examined for the content of adrenaline and noradrenaline (NA). The data obtained indicate a significant increase in the content of NA and adrenaline in the oral mucosa 2 h following operation. In animals pretreated with obsidan, the content of catecholamines remained at the level seen in the control group. Therefore, blocking the transmission of nerve impulses to the sympathetic nervous system obsidan interferes with the reflex influence from the involved organs of the abdominal cavity, thereby protecting the oral mucosa tissues from the damage-inducing action of high concentrations of NA.",

The preparations tested were slow-release propranolol hydrochloride, 160 mg, atenolol, 100 mg, slow-release oxprenolol hydrochloride, 160 mg, and metoprolol, 200 mg. Propranolol and atenolol produced a significant decline in lying, standing, and postexercise blood pressure and pulse rate values. The effects of oxprenolol and metoprolol were not significantly different from that of placebo.", 
    "51": "This study compared airways reactivity before and after an inflammatory response was induced in the airways by exposing them to cigarette smoke. Airways reactivity was measured to graded doses of histamine using a standard technique in 24 animals without drug pretreatment, in 17 pretreated with propranolol, in 17 pretreated with atropine, and in 18 pretreated with both atropine and propranolol. In each group, at least 5 animals not exposed to cigarette smoke served as controls, and the remaining animals were studied in groups of 4 or more at 30 min, 6, and 24 h after exposure to 100 puffs of whole cigarette smoke. The data show that airways reactivity was increased at 30 min but not at 6 and 24 h after exposure to cigarette smoke. Pretreatment with propranolol or the combination of propranolol and atropine prior to the histamine dose-response curve did not affect the increased response seen after cigarette smoke exposure, but pretreatment with atropine abolished it. Comparing this study with our previous histologic studies of the airways in similarly exposed animals, we conclude that the observed increase in airways reactivity occurs during the fluid exudative phase of the inflammatory response before the polymorphonuclear leukocytes migrate into the epithelium.", 
    "52": "Several studies have shown that halothane may influence drug disposition in animals and humans, but the mechanism remains unclear. The relative contributions of changes in metabolizing capacity and hepatic blood flow to altered drug disposition were investigated during halothane anesthesia, using propranolol as a model compound. The studies were performed on six dogs on three separate days; first, the day before anesthesia, second, during halothane (2.0 MAC) anesthesia, and third, 24 h after anesthesia. Each dog simultaneously received 40 mg unlabeled propranolol directly into the portal vein and 200 mCi of 3H-propranolol intravenously via chronically implanted catheters. Blood samples were taken every 5 min for the first hour and then every 15 min for a further 3 h for the measurement of unlabeled and 3H-propranolol concentrations. During halothane anesthesia, intraportal-intrinsic clearance was decreased by 62% (P less than 0.05) from 2,110 +/- 298 to 799 +/- 233 ml/min, while systemic clearance was decreased (P less than 0.05) from 470 +/- 33 ml/min preanesthesia to 280 +/- 38 ml/min during halothane anesthesia. The intravenous elimination half-life was increased (P less than 0.05) from 87 +/- 12 to 155 +/- 23 min during anesthesia. Although halothane anesthesia tended to lower liver plasma flow from 642 +/- 80 to 473 +/- 47 ml/min, this change was not significant. The large change in portal or intrinsic clearance indicates that halothane anesthesia markedly inhibits drug-metabolizing ability. The authors therefore conclude that the alterations in drug disposition observed during halothane anesthesia are mainly due to inhibition of drug-metabolizing capacity in the liver.", 
    "53": "Mean mouth to cecum transit time determined by the hydrogen breath test after oral lactulose in a group of 10 hyperthyroid patients (nine with regular bowel habit and one with diarrhea) was significantly lower than that observed in 10 euthyroid controls [53 min (SD 15) versus 123 min (SD 12.2), p less than 0.01]. After 5 days of propranolol treatment the patients showed a significant reduction of the heart rate but no modification of transit time [51 min (SD 7.3)].", 
    "54": "Because the combined use of a beta-adrenergic blocking agent and a calcium antagonist may be beneficial in some patients with severe angina, the acute hemodynamic and electrophysiologic effects of intravenous propranolol in the presence and absence of oral diltiazem treatment was studied. In 22 patients (11 men, 11 women, mean age 50 years), 12 receiving diltiazem (mean 243 mg/day, range 180 to 360) and 10 not receiving diltiazem, hemodynamic and electrophysiologic variables were measured before and 5 minutes after intravenous propranolol (0.1 mg/kg). Cardiac index (by thermodilution) and left ventricular (LV) peak dP/dt fell and LV end-diastolic pressure increased similarly in both groups. Mean systemic arterial pressure was unchanged. Coronary sinus blood flow (by thermodilution) decreased slightly in patients receiving diltiazem and was unchanged in those not receiving it. Propranolol caused a similar reduction in heart rate and increase in atrio-His conduction in both groups. Thus, when intravenous propranolol is given to patients with normal or only mildly depressed LV systolic function, the hemodynamic and electrophysiologic effects are similar in those receiving and not receiving oral diltiazem.", 
    "55": "Verapamil and propranolol, alone and in combination, were given intravenously to anesthetized dogs to analyze the interaction between drug-induced cardiovascular effects and the resulting changes in pharmacokinetics. Dosing regimens were used that produced steady state plasma levels of both drugs, and the observed effects were clearly related to the plasma concentrations of the agents. When given alone, at stable \"therapeutic\" levels in plasma, verapamil or propranolol decreased spontaneous heart rate, increased atrioventricular conduction time, and had opposite effects on cardiac output. At the same doses, the combined infusion of the 2 drugs rapidly resulted in profound depression in cardiac function; in addition, plasma concentrations of both agents increased into ranges associated with cardiovascular toxicity. When verapamil doses were reduced, combined infusion with propranolol decreased atrioventricular conduction and cardiac output, but drug plasma concentrations (and associated effects) remained stable. When reduced doses of propranolol were added to infusion of verapamil, similar effects on cardiovascular function occurred, but plasma drug levels increased progressively throughout the remainder of the study period. In all combinations studied, beta blockade with propranolol decreased liver plasma flow and, therefore, the systemic clearance of verapamil. The in vitro effects of propranolol on verapamil metabolism were small, although significant, and not clinically relevant. These acute studies suggest that the hemodynamic effects resulting from verapamil and propranolol in combination may significantly diminish clearance of 1 or both drugs, thereby resulting in accumulation during continued administration, increased drug effects with increasing plasma concentrations, and potentially lethal drug toxicity.", 
    "56": "Hypertensive emergencies require prompt and aggressive treatment to prevent target organ damage and death. A variety of neurologic, cardiac, renal and other conditions may underlie a hypertensive crisis. A number of highly effective drugs are now available to treat hypertensive crises, including well-known agents like sodium nitroprusside and diazoxide, as well as newer drugs such as nifedipine and captopril. Some older medications have been superseded by newer agents.", 
    "57": "We report here that the chemotactic peptide, N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP), and the mitogenic phorbol ester, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) cause a time- and concentration-dependent, selective, extracellular release of N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase and lysozyme from freshly isolated, adherent human peripheral blood monocytes. The inability of the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, to influence enzyme release indicates that these enzymes are constitutive secretory products. 1-O-Hexadecyl-/octadecyl-2-O-acetyl-sn-glyceryl-3-phosphorylcholine demonstrated moderate secretory activity, whereas pepstatin A, concanavalin A, and leukotriene B4 were essentially inactive. FMLP- and PMA-induced enzyme release were inhibited with the intracellular calcium antagonist, 8-(N,N-diethylamino)-octyl-(3,4,5-trimethoxy)benzoate hydrochloride and the anion channel blocker, 4,4'-diisothiocyano-2,2'-disulfonic acid stilbene. These results demonstrate the capacity of soluble, surface-active stimuli to activate the human monocyte secretory process.", 
    "58": "This radial compression liquid-chromatographic assay for propranolol in plasma is rapid, reproducible, and suitable for use in routine monitoring. A 10-micron particle, 8 mm X 10 cm CN cartridge is used in conjunction with a radial compression separation system. The mobile phase is monobasic sodium phosphate (pH 3) solution/methanol/acetonitrile (760/84/156 by vol), the flow rate 6 mL/min. Propranolol was detected by use of a spectrofluorometer equipped with a 20-microL flow-through cell, at excitation and emission wavelengths of 250 and 336 nm. The retention times for propranolol and metoprolol (the internal standard) are 3.13 and 1.42 min, respectively. A one-step extraction with chloroform yields \"clean\" chromatograms, with greater than 90% of the drug being analytically accounted for. Under these conditions, results are precise and accurate. Currently we are using this method to monitor propranolol in hypertensive neonates. Data on changes in the concentrations of propranolol in plasma with time are presented for one such patient.", 
    "59": "The effect of combination therapy with diltiazem and atenolol on the regional myocardial blood flow-function relationship was studied in eight conscious dogs with chronic coronary artery stenosis. An ameroid constrictor and hydraulic occluder were placed around the left circumflex coronary artery, sonomicrometers were implanted for measuring wall thickness in control and ischemic regions, and regional myocardial blood flow was measured with the microsphere method. Eighteen days (average) after surgery, resting regional myocardial function and blood flow were normal, but treadmill exercise induced severe regional myocardial dysfunction in the posterior wall (wall thickening during systole reduced from 25.5% to 2.7%, a 90% reduction). Subendocardial blood flow decreased by 68% from the control standing value, while subepicardial flow increased. An identical exercise bout was performed 3 hr after administration of atenolol (1.0 mg/kg orally) and 15 min after administration of diltiazem (0.3 mg/kg iv). Heart rate during running was significantly lower as were left ventricular peak systolic pressure, end-diastolic pressure, and peak dP/dt. Wall thickening in the control region was not augmented during exercise after atenolol and diltiazem. There was less dysfunction in the ischemic region (35% reduction) and the improved performance was accompanied by a substantial increase in subendocardial perfusion (0.31 +/- 0.14 vs 0.61 +/- 0.30 ml/min/g, a 36% reduction from rest). Epicardial flow was unchanged, and the endocardial/epicardial ratio increased (0.27 +/- 0.13 vs 0.62 +/- 0.29). Recovery time for regional wall thickening also improved. The beneficial effects of the combination of atenolol and diltiazem in a preparation of single-vessel chronic coronary stenosis were shown to be significantly greater than those of either drug alone.", 
    "60": "We determined the effect of heart rate on the disposition of neurally released norepinephrine from the cardiac tissues in open-chest, anesthetized dogs with complete atrioventricular block. After injecting desipramine to block the neuronal uptake of norepinephrine, we stimulated the cardiac sympathetic nerves supramaximally for about 3 minutes at a mean frequency of 2.7 Hz. In one series of experiments, we allowed coronary sinus blood flow to change spontaneously in response to cardiac pacing and sympathetic stimulation. The mean coronary sinus blood flows just before cessation of sympathetic stimulation were 67.4 +/- 4.2 (SE) and 37.4 +/- 2.7 ml/min during pacing at a high (150/min) and a low (60/min) frequency, respectively. The mean norepinephrine overflow into the coronary sinus blood during steady state sympathetic stimulation was 45.0 +/- 14.2% greater during high frequency pacing than during low frequency pacing. After cessation of neural stimulation, the norepinephrine overflow decayed more rapidly during high frequency pacing than during low frequency pacing. This difference in decay rates was mainly ascribable to the difference in coronary blood flows. In a second series of experiments, we adjusted the coronary sinus blood flow during sympathetic stimulation so that the flows were not significantly different during pacing at the two frequencies. During the initial 30-second period, after cessation of sympathetic stimulation, the mean decrements of norepinephrine overflow were 95.9 +/- 21.4 and 59.2 +/- 17.3 ng/min at the high- and low-pacing frequencies, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "61": "Intracerebroventricular injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OH-DA) prevented the development of the lypressin (LVP)-induced hypertension. Administration of 6-OH-DA to hypertensive rats significantly decreased, but did not normalize, blood pressure. A fourteen-day treatment with clonidine, guanethidine, reserpine, dihydralazine, propranolol and furosemide produced a transient decrease in blood pressure in LVP-hypertensive rats. Eight weeks after the withdrawal of hypotensive drugs blood pressure again reached the value corresponding to that in untreated LVP-hypertensive rats.", 
    "62": "Isolated gastric glands from the rabbit were used for studying the effect of catecholamines on the release of pepsinogen. Isoprenaline, adrenaline and noradrenaline stimulated pepsinogen release in a dose-dependent manner with similar maximal effects, but isoprenaline was significantly more potent than the other two agonists. The effect was mediated through beta-adrenoceptors, since the response was inhibited by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol, and since the alpha-adrenoceptor agonist, phenylephrine, was without effect in the concentration range 0.01 - 10 microM. Concentration-response curves for isoprenaline were shifted to the right in parallel by increasing doses of propranolol, and maximal response was not influenced by propranolol per se, which indicates a competitive type of antagonism. A Schild plot showed a pA2-value for propranolol of 7.70 and the slope of the regression line was 1.02. Studies with the beta 1-selective antagonist pafenolol and the beta 2-selective antagonist ICI 118.551 demonstrated that isoprenaline acted through beta 1-adrenoceptors. The results suggest an adrenergic component in the control of the peptic cells in rabbit gastric mucosa.", 
    "63": "The effects of oral Sotalol were assessed by electrophysiological investigations in 6 patients with ventricular preexcitation (Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome) and a short anterograde refractory period (less than or equal to 280 ms) of the accessory pathway. After 27 to 80 days (mean 41 +/- 19 days) of oral Sotalol (160 mg daily in 5 patients, 320 mg daily in 1 patient). The effective anterograde refractory period of the accessory pathway increased from 268 +/- 13 ms to 318 +/- 33 ms (less than 0.05); the shortest QR interval with appearances of preexcitation increased either during rapid atrial pacing (272 +/- 19 ms to 374 +/- 74 ms: p less than 0.05) or during induced atrial fibrillation (258 +/- 61 to 335 +/- 56 ms: p less than 0.01). The effective refractory period could only be measured in 4 cases during Sotalol therapy and increased by 10 ms, 130 ms and by at least 220 and 300 ms. During the repeat electrophysiological investigation the plasma concentrations of Sotalol ranged from 0.33 to 2.3 g/ml. These results show that oral Sotalol significantly increases the effective refractory periods of accessory pathways even when they are short under basal conditions. This product could therefore be effective in preventing the rapid ventricular response to atrial fibrillation in patients with the WPW syndrome and also in the prevention of reciprocating tachycardias.", 
    "64": "The haemodynamic and myocardial metabolic effects of intravenous Labetalol were studied in 7 normotensive coronary patients with at least one significant stenosis on the left anterior descending artery. The study consisted of 5 successive observation periods: basal (I); during atrial pacing at the theoretical maximal heart rate or when anginal pain occurred (II); return to basal conditions (III); 20 minutes after an injection of 1.5 mg/kg of Labetalol over 3 minutes into the pulmonary artery (IV); during repeat atrial pacing at the rate achieved during phase II (V). There was no significant difference between phases I and III except for a slightly faster heart rate in phase III. The effects of Labetalol were assessed by comparing the results during phases III and IV between phases II and V and by analysing the variations between phases I, II, IV and V. In comparison with basal conditions (phase III), Labetalol (phase IV) induced a slight decrease in cardiac output (p less than 0.05), a decrease in aortic pressure and systemic arterial resistances (p less than 0.01) and of the double product. Coronary sinus flow did not change but myocardial oxygen consumption fell by an average of 11% (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "65": "The results of cardiac plexectomy in spastic angina are controversial. This study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of blocking the cardiac autonomic nervous system (CANS) in this syndrome in 61 patients presenting with chest pain and angiographically normal coronary arteries. All patients underwent a methyl-ergometrine provocation test with a sequential protocol. They were then divided into two groups: Group 1 (13 patients): positive response to ergometrine. Group 2 (48 patients): negative response to ergometrine. Three sub-groups were identified: 2: 1: 9 patients with coronary spasm demonstrated by another method: 2: 2: 6 patients with myocardial infarction: 2: 3: 33 patients with chest pain alone. The results of these tests were compared with those obtained after blocking the CANS by intravenous injection over 3 minutes of an alpha and beta-blocker (labetalol 2 mg/kg) and a parasympathetic blocker (Atropine. 0.04 mg/kg). The CANS blockade was confirmed by two facts: the basal heart rate of 66.38 +/- 9.91 rose to ots intrinsic rate of 89.76 +/- 10.5 (p less than 0.01) and remained at that rate after ergometrine and trinitrate administration and myocardial ischaemia; changes in blood pressure were greater after CANS blockade: + 30.62 +/- 16.13 mmHg instead of + 8.62 +/- 0.33 mmHg after ergometrine (p less than 0.01) and -43.16 +/- 16.32 mmHg instead of -25.16 +/- 3.64 mmHg after trinitrate (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "66": "Prenalterol (P), a partial adrenergic agonist with functional beta 1-specificity, has been shown to have inotropic effects when given orally and thus represents a potential substitute or adjunct to conventional digitalis therapy (D) in the long-term management of congestive cardiomyopathy (COCM). A direct comparison between both drugs has not been reported. In a blind controlled trial, 15 patients with COCM (NYHA II-III) with sinus rhythm and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LV-EF) of 34.5 +/- 2.6% received consecutively D (0.25-0.5 mg/d), placebo (PLAC), P (slow releases = SR) (80 mg/d SR) and both drugs combined in respective doses. After 4 weeks of therapy with each drug, effects were assessed by gated blood pool scintigraphy at rest (R) and during graded bicycle exercise (EX), systolic time intervals (STI), Holter monitoring and a clinical score. Plasma levels of both drugs and of catecholamines and lactate were also determined. Compared to PLAC, LV-EF was not significantly altered by D at R (34.5 +/- 2.6 vs. 31.9 +/- 2.3%, p = ns), but a shortening of the QS2-interval could be demonstrated (533 +/- 7 vs. 550 +/- 6 msec, p less than 0.05). In contrast, during EX an improvement of LV-EF was observed (34.5 +/- 3 vs. 31.3 +/- 2.8%, p less than 0.05). P alone showed no significant alterations in LV-EF and STI, along with a lack of symptomatic improvement. The addition of D (D + P) resulted in improved left ventricular performance both at R (LV-EF 37.9 +/- 3.3 vs. 31.9 +/- 2.3%, p less than 0.01, QS2 530 +/- 8 vs. 550 +/- 6 msec, p less than 0.01) and during EX (LV-EF 35.3 +/- 2.5 vs. 31.1 +/- 2.8%). Values between D and D + P were not significantly different. No drug or combination improved maximal working capacity.", 
    "67": "Beneficial effects of chronic treatment with D could be demonstrated in patients with COCM, particularly during EX. Further studies are needed to determine why the acute effects of P are not fully sustained during long-term therapy.", 
    "68": "The effect of the beta1 selective adrenoceptor blocker, atenolol, on the physiological response to exercise was studied in 12 healthy young men. Oral atenolol (100 mg) and placebo were administered in a randomised double blind crossover fashion an hour and a half before an intermittent multistage cycle ergometer exercise test. At maximal effort oxygen consumption, pulmonary ventilation, carbon dioxide output, and respiratory exchange ratio were not modified by atenolol. In contrast, maximal heart rate and performance time were significantly reduced after atenolol. Nevertheless, because the relation of percentage of maximal oxygen consumption to percentage of maximal heart rate was not changed by atenolol both the absolute and relative oxygen consumption corresponding to 70% and 85% of the maximal heart rate remained unaltered. These data suggest that recommendations of exercise intensity may be determined on the basis of a calculated percentage of the predetermined maximal heart rate in persons without symptomatic coronary heart disease receiving beta1 selective adrenoceptor blockers.", 
    "69": "Nipradilol and prizidilol are beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs with vasodilator action. These drugs lowered blood pressure (BP) in spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats acutely (24 hr) and subacutely (3 weeks) at doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg per day, p.o., respectively. Nipradilol decreased plasma renin concentration in acute and subacute studies, whereas it was unchanged with prizidilol treatment. Paradoxical effects of these drugs on BP were analyzed further: BP determined indirectly at the tail was slightly higher in SHR rats than the control, whereas BP determined directly through an aortic cannula without anesthesia, restraint, or prewarming was lower. We found that the discrepancy between BP values determined directly and indirectly was due to the increase in BP by prewarming stress during the determination by the tail cuff method.", 
    "70": "The role of the autonomic innervation in the control of pancreatic endocrine responses to I.V. infusions of butyrate (0.02 mmol kg-1 min-1 for 10 min) has been investigated in conscious 4-6 month old weaned lambs. Intravenous butyrate produced a small rise in mean arterial plasma pancreatic glucagon concentration which was unlikely to have had any physiological effect and produced no consistent or statistically significant changes in mean plasma pancreatic polypeptide concentration in any of the groups studied. In contrast, butyrate produced an abrupt and substantial rise in mean plasma insulin concentration, which rose to a peak incremental value of about 300 pmol l-1 in normal control lambs. This response was unaffected by pre-treatment with either phentolamine or propranolol alone, but was significantly reduced by simultaneous administration of these drugs, as it was either by pre-treatment with atropine or prior section of the splanchnic nerves. The rise in mean plasma insulin concentration was inhibited most effectively by combined treatment with propranolol, phentolamine and atropine, which was significantly more effective than administration of atropine to lambs with cut splanchnic nerves (P less than 0.01). It is concluded that both divisions of the autonomic nervous system are likely to be involved in mediating the release of insulin from the pancreas, in response to butyrate, in this species under these experimental conditions and also in the resting state.", 
    "71": "In a clinical trial we studied left ventricular performance at rest in 50 patients with unstable angina by radionuclide techniques. Thallium-201 scintigraphy was performed on admission in 38 patients and repeated after 48 hr in 32 patients. Also dynamic blood pool scintigraphy was performed in 37 patients on admission and in 45 patients after 48 hr. Of the 50 patients, 27 (54%) had no recurrent episodes of myocardial ischemia, but 23 (46%) patients showed recurrent ischemic episodes of whom 11 (22%) patients developed a myocardial infarction. The thallium-201 images showed perfusion defects in 27 (71%) of the 38 patients studied on admission and in 20 (63%) of the 32 patients studied at 48 hr. No relation between clinical outcome and presence or absence of defects was observed. Left ventricular ejection fraction was abnormal (less than 50%) in 19 (51%) of the 37 patients on admission and in 29 (64%) of the 45 patients studied at 48 hr. As with thallium-201, no relation could be established between clinical outcome and left ventricular ejection fraction. It is concluded that radionuclide techniques are useful to provide insight into the pathophysiological mechanism of unstable angina, but they are not helpful for the short-time assessment of clinical outcome.", 
    "72": "Seventy-one patients submitted routinely to coronary artery bypass surgery were randomized into 2 groups. Group A (32 patients) received 24 hr after initiation of surgery an intravenous perfusion of 100 mg of acebutolol given over 24 hr (22 cases) or 600 mg administered orally (10 cases). On subsequent days, they received 1200 mg of acebutolol/day orally. Group B (39 patients) was used as control. The groups were comparable in terms of age, sex, severity of coronary disease, preoperative therapy, duration of extracorporeal circulation, aortic clamping time, and immediate postoperative haemodynamic findings. No patient received digitalis. During hospital stay (10 days), 1 group A patient (3%) and 13 group B patients (33%; P less than 0.001) developed a sustained episode of atrial arrhythmia (fibrillation, flutter or atrial ectopic tachycardia). The majority of these rhythm disorders developed between days 2 and 4. On Holter monitoring on days 7-10, malignant ventricular extrasystoles (grades IV and V of Lown's classification) were more frequent in group B (65.2%) than in group A (19.3%; P less than 0.001). Haemodynamic measurements taken at rest performed in 27 patients on days 7-10 (16 patients of group A; 11 of group B). No difference was observed between the two groups. Acebutolol is a safe and efficacious drug for the prevention of arrhythmias following coronary surgery.", 
    "73": "The efficacy of sotalol in treating acute atrial fibrillation and flutter after open heart surgery was compared with that of a digoxin/disopyramide combination. Forty adult patients with postoperative atrial arrhythmias were randomised into either group 1 (sotalol 1 mg/kg bolus intravenously plus 0.2 mg/kg intravenously over 12 hours) or group 2 (digoxin 0.75 mg intravenously, then two hours later disopyramide 2 mg/kg intravenous bolus and 0.4 mg/kg/h intravenously for 10 hours). In each group, 17 out of 20 patients reverted to sinus or junctional rhythm within 12 hours. The time to reversion in group 1 was significantly shorter than in group 2. Systolic blood pressure fell by greater than or equal to 20 mm Hg or to less than or equal to 90 mm Hg during drug administration in 17 out of 20 patients in group 1 (sotalol withdrawn in two) and in none out of 20 in group 2. Two patients in group 1 developed transient bradycardia (sotalol withdrawn in one). None of 17 patients in group 1 and two of 17 in group 2 relapsed temporarily into atrial fibrillation during the 12 hours of intravenous treatment. On continued oral treatment, one late relapse occurred in group 1 and five in group 2, and five patients in group 2 had disopyramide withdrawn because of anticholinergic side effects (acute urinary retention in four). Sotalol was as effective as the digoxin/disopyramide combination and acted significantly faster. Sensitivity to beta blockade in these patients may be related to high plasma catecholamine concentrations known to occur after cardiopulmonary bypass.", 
    "74": "We have previously shown that vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a renin-stimulating factor both in vivo and in vitro. In the present investigation we sought to determine whether VIP exerted this effect by a neural or humoral mechanism. To test for a neural effect, the renal nerves were stimulated on one side for 30 min in anesthetized dogs, and plasma VIP and renin levels were determined in the renal venous effluent. The stimulation significantly increased plasma renin activity in arterial and renal venous plasma but had no effect on VIP concentrations. A humoral action was tested in two ways. First, plasma renin activity was measured before and after elevating circulating levels of endogenously produced VIP using intravenous neostigmine (0.07 mg/kg) in control, renal-denervated, and propranolol-pretreated animals. In all three groups, the elevated plasma level of VIP was associated with a significant increase in plasma renin activity. Second, plasma levels of VIP were determined in conscious dogs with elevated plasma renin activity produced by either a low-salt diet or hemorrhage. In both cases, plasma renin activity was significantly elevated as expected, but plasma levels of VIP were unchanged. These data suggest that the effects of VIP on renin secretion are not mediated by release of the peptide from the renal nerves, the circulating level of endogenously produced VIP can be elevated sufficiently to stimulate renin secretion, but a humoral role of VIP in the elevated plasma renin activity produced by low-salt diet or hemorrhage seems unlikely.+", 
    "75": "The excellent safety and predictable efficacy of isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) have been demonstrated repeatedly during the past 25 years in a number of studies in which the agent has been used alone or in combination with other antianginal agents. Clinical studies to investigate the additive or synergistic effect of ISDN have been difficult to conduct because of the complexity of protocol design and length of studies required. However, combination therapy is well accepted in the clinical practice of medicine and cardiology and is used to obtain additive therapeutic effects while minimizing the side effects. The addition of ISDN not only to other standard and proven antianginal agents but also to calcium antagonists should prove to be a fruitful area for further clinical research benefiting patients with angina pectoris (caused by either coronary artery spasm or occlusive coronary artery disease), hypertension, and congestive heart failure. Noncardiovascular uses of ISDN may include the treatment of hyperspasticity of other smooth muscle beds, such as esophageal spasm and achalasia."
