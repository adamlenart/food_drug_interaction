    "0": "For the practicing physician the medicamentous treatment of the patients with infarction is the main problem of the secondary prevention in the prehospital phase as well as in the after-treatment. In these cases in the acute phase not the myocardial insufficiency is in the centre of the out-patient care, but the therapy of the disturbances of cardiac rhythm, which mainly cause the high lethality in the early phase. Therefore, uncomplicated infarctions, in whch care must be taken only for a sedation of sympathico-adrenergic reactions and a volume reduction of the heart, should be differed from complicated cases. However, an immediate transport to the hospital must be guaranteed. If there appear a contraction insufficiency of the left ventricle or threatening disturbances of the rhythm, additionally glycosides and saluretics must be administered as well as an aimed antiarrhythmic therapy must be initiated. The necessary medicamentous measures are described dependent upon the diagnosis of brady- and tachycardiac disturbances of the rhythm. The author enters briefly the problems of volume substitution, treatment of acidosis as well as the administration of beta-sympathicolytics and gluco-corticoids. - In the after-treatment of infarctions anticoagulants are the only medicaments to be prescribed, when findings completely without complications are present. If, however, there are signs of activity of the coronary heart disease in the post-infarction phase, a basic therapy with a glycoside and anticoagulants as well as an individually to be varied additive therapy with nitro-preparations, beta-sympathicolytics, saluretics, anti-hypertensive agents and antiarrhythmic agents are necessary.", 
    "1": "The cardiac and bronchial effects of AH 5158 and propranolol were compared in a double-blind, placebocontrolled intravenous study on 10 asthmatics. AH 5158, like propranolol, is a non-cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor-blocking drug, but unlike propranolol it also has an alpha-adrenoceptor-blocking action. Both drugs produced equivalent cardiac(beta1) blockade, but propranolol produced bronchoconstriction, whereas AH 5158 did not. Hence the alpha-blocking action of AH 5158 seems to prevent the bronchoconstrictor effects of propranolol in these patients.", 
    "2": "The effects of dimethyl quaternary propranolol (UM-272) on electrophysiologic properties of canine cardiac Purkinje fibers (PF) were studied using standard microelectrode techniques. In PF superfused with Tyrode's solution, the effects of UM-272, 10- minus 7 to 10- minus 5 M, were studied. In other experiments, UM-272, 3 mg/kg, was injected into donor animals whose blood was used to superfuse isolated PF. Antiarrhythmic concentrations of UM-272 decreased action potential (AP) amplitude, phase 0 upstroke velocity, membrane responsiveness, AP duration and the effective refractory period (the decrease in the effective refractory period was less than that in AP duration). Automaticity of spontaneously firing PF was suppressed. As perfusate potassium concentration was increased, the magnitude of UM-272 effect was accentuated. When the actions of equimolar concentrations of UM-272 and propranolol on PF AP were compared, propranolol attained a steady-state effect more rapidly and tended to depress the AP more markedly. UM-272 did not block epinephrine-induced increases in PF automaticity or the adenylate cyclase activation of PG homogenates induced by epinephrine. These studies indicate that UM-272 has direct effects on the PF AP similar to those of propranolol, but lacks the beta blocking properties of the latter.", 
    "3": "The therapy for acute dissecting aneurysm of the aorta remains a difficult problem for thoracic surgeons. Because of an excessive operative mortality in patients with acute dissection who were operated on within 24 hours of hospital admission, we have utilized intensive medical management to delay surgical intervention. Even patients with acute aortic insufficiency can be supported medically, allowing their operations to be delayed at least 3 weeks or longer. Since this policy has been implemented, there has been no operative mortality in our last 13 patients with acute dissection. Medical therapy as the definitive treatment is now reserved solely for Type III dissections or for patients who cannot be operated on for other reasons. This report outlines our rationale for therapy and our current method of managing acute dissection.", 
    "4": "Knowledge of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics is a powerful tool for controlling cardiac arrhythmias with drugs even though antiarrhythmic drugs are potentially quite toxic. If the diagnosis and drug selection are correct at the outset of therapy, the clinician can use his knowledge of pharmacokinetics to achieve arrhythmia control with a minimum of personal effort and risk to his patient.", 
    "5": "A new approach to monitoring of episodic but frequently recurring arrhythmias has been developed, consisting of condensation of electrocardiographic information on a special drum recorder, a programmer that permits selection of intervals and durations for monitoring, and a telemetry unit for transmission of the electrocardiographic signal. We used this system to manage three selected cases.", 
    "6": "Some aspects of drug management of acute behavioural disorder are discussed. Drug management aims at the amelioration of the patient's ineraction with his environment; it is used as a diagnostic procedure, and to facilitate further definitive diagnosis and investigation, as a form of psychotherapeutic contact, to facilitate further psychotherapy, and to initiate a treatment programme aimed at returning the patient to being a useful and health member of society. Some methods of rapid tranquillisation are described and the drug management of the following specific behavioural disturbances are discussed: schizophrenic distrubance, acute mania, depressive behavioural disturbance, acute anxiety states, acting-out psychopathic behaviour, toxic states, epileptic furore and dyscontrol syndrome, behavioural disturbances of the elderly, and behavioural disturbances in organic conditions.", 
    "7": "The effects of single doses of the beta1-receptor antagonist metoprolol (40 mg orally), propranolol (40 mg orally) and placebo were compared on furosemide-stimulated plasma renin activity (PRA) in seven healthy subjects. In the placebo studies, PRA increased by 0.59+/-0.18 ng x ml-1 x h-1 60 minutes after intravenous administration of 30-60 mg furosemide. After propranolol and metoprolol, the corresponding increases in PRA were significantly less pronounced amounting to 0.16+/-0.06 and 0.24+/-0.08 ng x ml-1 x h-1, respectively. The resting heart rate was reduced to the same extent after the two beta-blockers, which means that the two drugs had been given in equipotent beta1-receptor blocking doses. It is suggested that the release of renin from the kidney may partly be mediated via an adrenergic beta1-receptor.", 
    "8": "The effects of propranolol (0.06 mg/kg i.v.), the selective beta1-receptor antagonist metoprolol (0.12 mg/kg i.v.) and a placebo on pulmonary function, heart rate and blood pressure have been compared in asthmatics. The interaction of these drugs with increasing doses of isoprenaline on the same variables was also studied. The two beta-blockers reduced resting heart rate to the same extent, indicating the same degree of blockade of cardiac beta-receptors. Both beta-blockers reduced the basal forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and the effect tended to be more pronounced after propranolol. Isoprenaline caused a dose-dependent increase in FEV1 and vital capacity (VC). These effects were almost completely blocked by propranolol, whereas after metoprolol the changes approached that of the placebo. The isoprenaline-induced increase in heart rate and fall in diastolic blood pressure was also inhibited to a considerably greater extent by propranolol than by metoprolol. The results show a selectivity of metoprolol for so-called beta1-receptors and indicate that metoprolol may be used in asthmatics provided that it is combined with beta2-receptor-stimulating drugs.", 
    "9": "Nine patients with suspicious repolarization (ST-T segment) changes in the ECG were further investigated. Each had ten different additional ECG tests (after various degrees of exercise, and orciprenaline, amylnitrite, glucose, potassium chloride, and propranolol injections). The ECG changes became normal in all patients, orciprenaline and propranolol injection providing optimal results. Clinical investigation, left-heart angiocardiography and coronary angiography were normal in all. The questionably abnormal repolarization distrubances were, therefore, judged to be benign. As both beta-stimulation and beta-blockade normalized the ECG it can be safely assumed that the ECG changes were induced by autonomic nervous system factors. Cardiac catheterization appears, therefore, not indicated in each case and a potential iatrogenic heart disease can be avoided by relatively simple means.", 
    "10": "In guinea-pig cerebral cortical slices cyclic AMP concentrations increase during incubation with histamine+noradrenaline. After 10 min of incubation the levels of cyclic AMP start to decline. When calcium ions are omitted from the incubation medium, cyclic AMP levels do increase to a greater extent under the same conditions and do not drop during 30 min incubation. In the presence of calcium ions cyclic AMP synthesis can not be elicited by noradrenaline alone. In calcium-free Krebs-Ringer solution a pronounced effect of noradrenaline on cyclic AMP levels is observed. This effect of noradrenaline is shown to be mediated by a classical alpha-type receptor. 5-Hydroxytryptamine, prostaglandin E1 and dopamine do not significnatly enhance cyclic AMP formation in guinea-pig brain slices in either the presence in, or the absence of calcium ions from the incubation medium. Under depolarizing conditions of incubation the stimulatory effect of ouabain or 125 mM K+ is blocked in a calcium-free medium, while with the depolarizing agent veratridine no significant reduction of cyclic AMP formed during incubation in a calcium-free medium is obtained.", 
    "11": "In the rat vas deferens alpha-adrenoblocking agent phentolamine (1-10(-6)M) and beta-adrenoblocking agent propranolol (1-10(-6)M) activated uptake of exogenous noradrenaline--H-3 by 37 and 47% respectively and synthesis of noradrenaline--H3 from thyrosin-H3 by 72 and 48%. The rate of noradrenaline-H3 synthesis from DOPA-H3 or dopamine-H3 remains unaltered. Regulating effect of the adrenoblocking agents is carried out by means of uptake of tyrosine-H3 and noradrenaline-H3 into adrenergic neuron, i.e. at the main stages sustaining a necessary level of mediator. The rate of noradrenaline biosynthesis is supposed to be independently regulated by means of both types of adrenoreceptors in an adrenergic neuron.", 
    "12": "1 Oral ICI 66,082 (200 mg) or water (control treatment) were each administered to six healthy volunteers. 2 The heart rate (HR) and peak flow rate (PFR) were measured at rest and during vigorous exercise before and at intervals up to 24 h after each treatment. 3 ICI 66,082 produced significant reductions in exercise HR at all times compared with the changes after the control treatment (P less than 0.001), whereas with resting HR, corresponding significant reductions only occurred at 2,3 and 4 h (P less than 0.05). 4 Although there was no change in resting PFR, significant reductions in exercise PFR, compared with the changes after the control treatment, occurred at all times excepting at 2 h after ICI 66,082 (P less than 0.025). 5 The findings are consistent with ICI 66,082 possessing partial cardioselectivity. 6 Plasma levels and renal excretion of the drug were determined. Urinary recovery was variable which, together with the plasma concentration/effect relationships obtained, raise the possibility that ICI 66,082 is metabolized in man.", 
    "13": "Urticaria with systemic effects occurred in a patient being treated with propranolol and was reproducible upon rechallenge with the drug; Successful beta-adrenergic blocking therapy was achieved using a new agent, tolamolol, with no evidence of any adverse effects.", 
    "14": "Fifteen patients with angina pectoris participated in a double-blind study evaluating the effect of intravenous saline, 10 mg of intravenous tolamolol, 20 mg of intravenous tolamolol, and 10 mg of intravenous propranolol on resting and exercise heart rate and on exercise time until angina. Twenty mg of tolamolol and 10 mg of propranolol caused a similar decrease in mean resting heart rate, heart rate after a similar amount of exercise, heart rate at angina, resting product of systolic blood pressure times heart rate, and product of systolic blood pressure times heart rate at angina and were, therefore, judged equipotent. Tolamolol, 10 and 20 mg, and propranolol, 10 mg. were not followed by a significant change in mean exercise duration until angina, but there was a 25 percent increase in exercise time until angina in 4 of 15 patients (27 percent) after 10 mg of propranolol and in 3 of 15 patients (20 percent) after 20 mg of tolamolol.", 
    "15": "Abrupt occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery was performed on 45 unanesthetized farm pigs in order to evaluate the relative effects on the latency to ventricular fibrillation (VFL) of 1) adaptation of the animals to the laboratory, and 2) beta-receptor blockade by propranolol. Compared to control values, VFL was greatly lengthened (i.e., VF delayed or prevented) by adaptation (P smaller than 0.01), was shortened by large (2 MG/KG) doses of racemic propranolol in unadapted animals (P smaller than 0.02), and was again increased while under the influence of the drug, by adaptation (P smaller than 0.051). Neither a lower (0.02 mg/kg) dose of racemic propranolol, 2 mg/kg of dextropropranolol, nor ventricular pacing to a higher heart rate had an effect on VFL. The results suggest that reduced psychological stress was very effective in retarding or preventing the onset of VF, that low doses of propranolol were ineffective, and that higher doses were deleterious in unadapted animals.", 
    "16": "The vasodilatory drugs, minoxidil and hydralazine, induce renin release in the rat, man and the dog. Previous reports suggest that the rat adrenal cortex was insensitive to angiotensin stimulation. As a result these studies were designed to obtain evidence for or against the hypothesis that the control of aldosterone release in the rat is unique among mammalian species. Minoxidil and hydralazine induced a time-related increase in both serum renin activity and serum aldosterone. Minoxidil caused a dose-related, proportional increase in serum renin and aldosterone. This response was blocked by prior bilateral nephrectomy but was not affected by hypophysectomy. A competitive angiotensin antagonist, saralasin (1-Sar-8-Ala angiotensin II), impaired minoxidil-induced aldosterone release in a dose-related manner while potentiating minoxidil-induced renin release. Pretreatment with propranolol, a beta adrenergic blocking drug, impaired minoxidil-induced renin and aldosterone release. Only small changes in serum corticosterone occurred after minoxidil or hydralazine administration. These results indicate that minoxidil-induced aldosterone release was mediated by the endogenous angiotensin II formed from renin release. They also support the unanesthetized rat as an appropriate animal model for study of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis and its modification by drugs.", 
    "17": "Reduction of the (expanded) body fluid volumes found in some patients with renal hypertension may be essential in the management of these cases. Illustrative examples are given of this \"volume dependent\" form of hypertension. In such patients, plasma renin activity (PRA) is low. Other forms of hypertension may be regarded as caused by \"inappropriate renin secretion\". Most often, however, both factors are operative. This concept is supported by experimental evidence obtained in animals. The combined effect of salt depletion (which increases PRA) and beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol (during which treatment PRA is lowered) was systematically studied in 3 groups of hypertensive patients (including one group with chronic renal insufficiency). The results indicate that this combined therapy lowers the blood pressure in various types of hypertension, the effect being sometimes more than additive. There was, however, no correlation between the PRA levels and the blood pressure decrease after salt depletion or after propranolol. Consequently, on the basis of the PRA values, no group of patients could be identified for which this treatment would be specifically indicated.", 
    "18": "The adrenergic and cholinergic receptors of the human prostatic capsule, prostatic \"adenoma\", and bladder neck, were investigated by the in-vitro isometric technique. The prostatic capsule was found to be very rich in both alpha-adrenergic receptors and cholinergic receptors. The prostatic adenoma was moderately rich in alpha-adrenergic receptors, but cholinergic receptors were absent. Beta-adrenergic receptors were absent in the prostatic adenoma, and there was an equivocal response in less than half the specimens of the prostatic capsule. An attempt was made to distinguish between the trigonal component at the posterior bladder neck, and the true bladder neck muscle both posteriorly and antero-laterally. The results indicat that the \"posterior bladder neck\" seen at operation is predominantly trigonal muscle, and is poor in cholinergic receptors. The adrenergic response is variable in the true bladder neck muscle, but is present and strong in the trigonal muscle. This response is characteristically gradual in its development. In view of the findings in this investigation, it is suggested that certain instances of acute retention of urine in prostatic patients are due to over-stimulation of the alpha-adrenergic receptors, particularly those in the prostatic capsule. Similarly, the accepted clinical contraindication to the use of cholinergic drugs for retention in the prostatic patient is supported by the distribution of the cholinergic receptors in the tissues examined.", 
    "19": "1. Burimamide (34-1080 muM) caused a concentration-dependent increase in the force and frequency of contraction of kitten isolated atria. 2. Metiamide (467 muM) had no stimulant action on kitten atria and did not modify the effects of burimamide. 3. The atrial stimulation produced by burimamide was reduced by (-)propranolol (34-68 nM) and by cocaine (3 muM). 4. The atrial stimulant effect of burimamide was prevented by pretreatment of kittens with reserpine (1 mg/kg, 24 h before the experiment). 5. It is concluded that burimamide causes atrial stimulation by releasing catecholamines.", 
    "20": "In monkeys with beta-adrenergic blockade caused by administration of propranolol, we found that the conductance of the total respiratory system markedly decreased following intravenous administration of methacholine. The presence of beta-adrenergic blockade was judged from inotropic effect on the heart, levels of blood glucose and lactic acid, and the reaction of eosinophils after adrenalin injection.", 
    "21": "The isolated right atrium of the dog was perfused with arterial blood introduced from a carotid artery of a support dog. The selective injection of dopamine, tyramine and norepinephrine into the cannulated sinus node artery induced dose-relatedly positive chronotropic and inotropic effects. However, for an equal increase in sinus rate, dopamine caused less increase in tension development than norepinephrine. Tyramine caused least increase in contractility. Effects induced by dopamine were not blocked by treatment with tetrodotoxin which blocked those induced by nicotine. Desmethylimipramine treatment significantly suppressed dopamine-induced effects and completely blocked tyramine-induced ones but rather enhanced norepinephrine-induced ones. Alprenolol inhibited effects of dopamine, tyramine and norepinephrine. From these results, it is concluded that positive chronotropic and inotropic effects of dopamine are partly due to tyramine-like effect which causes the release of norepinephrine from sympathetic storage sites.", 
    "22": "Twenty-three out-patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension have been treated with a combination of hydralazine (37.5-150 mg daily) and oxprenolol (60 mg daily). Before treatment the patients were phenotyped for polymorphic acetylation by means of the sulphamethazine test: 12 proved to be slow and 11 rapid acetylators. A significant correlation was found between daily doses of hydralazine and the plasma hydralazine levels, separately in slow (r=0.480) and in rapid (r=0.580) acetylators. The antihypertensive response to hydralazine correlated well to plasma hydralazine levels. The mean fall of BP in slow acetylators was 33/23 mmHg in supine and 20/18 mmHg in standing position. The corresponding values in rapid acetylators were 22/15 and 21/15 mmHg. The average daily doses of hydralazine needed for these responses were 1.3 mg/kg in slow and 1.6 mg/kg in rapid acetylators. To reduce the systolic BP by 20 mmHg, 1.0 mg/kg of hydralazine was needed in slow acetylators; rapid acetylators needed a significantly higher dose of 1.4 mg/kg. During a follow-upof 1 year there have been virtually no side-effects. The results tally with the previous finding of Zacest and Koch-Weser, who demonstrated a similar correlation during the triple-drug regimen. It seems as if hypertensive patients can be succesfully treated with hydralazine and beta-blocking drug without knowledge of the patient's acetylator phenotype. However, acetylator status is a determinant of tissue levels and long-term toxicity of hydralazine, and patients should be phenotyped because beta-blockers may mask the warning side-effects.", 
    "23": "The monoenoic prostaglandin precursor, dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA), in a single dose intravenously (2.0 mg/kg) in dogs, produced a biphasic alteration in systemic arterial pressure (SAP) with a predominant and marked depressor effect. This SAP response is approximately equidepre-sor to the effect of PGE1 5 mug/kg. DGLA had a positive inotropic effect, causing a greater increase in myocardial contractility than PGE1 in an equidepressor dose. The effect of DGLA on MC was not altered by ganglion blockade or beta-adrenergic blockade. Aspirin blocked the sustained depressor response to DGLA but not an initial drop in SAP and increase of MC of very short duration. Aspirin had no effect on PGE1 or PGF1 alpha responses. DGLA caused no thrombocytopenia, but caused a decrease in sensitivity to platelet aggregation. Control fatty acid injections produced variable effects with no resemblances to DGLA responses. It is concluded that DGLA produces direct depressor and positive inotropic responses as well as responses which may be due to conversion to an endoperoxide formed in the biosynthesis of prostaglandins. In contrast, in equidepressor doses, arachidonic acid (AA), the bisenoic prostaglandin precursor, produces a delayed, single-phase depressor effect which may be due to endoperoxide formation alone. Further, the effect of AA on MC is reflex and is blocked by hexamethonium.", 
    "24": "Atrioventricular and intraventricular conduction were assessed in 4 patients with tricyclic antidepressant overdosage. The proximal or A-V nodal conduction (A-H) was normal, but 3 patients showed a drug-related increase in the QRS duration and His-Purkinje (H-V) conduction time. One patient with a normal H-V interval had a normal width QRS. The findings were independent of the heart rate and suggested a \"quinidine-like effect\" of the tricyclic drugs when ingested in suicidal doses. All 4 patients had normal intracardic conduction when restudied 8 days later. Procainamide and quinidine have similar effects on the intracardiac conduction and would appear undesirable in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias in patients with tricyclic overdosage. Practolol in a dose of 20 mg by intravenous injection reduced the heart rate and caused a relative increase in the A-H interval but did not affect either the distal atrioventricular or intraventricular conduction. Although there was a slight drop in blood pressure, it may be a safer drug to use.", 
    "25": "The authors report the effects of vasoactive drugs and sympathectomy on experimental spasm using vertebral angiography. Papaverine and isoxsuprine injections into the vertebral artery released both early and late spasm. The antiserotonin agent, methysergide, adn the alpha adrenergic blocking agent, phentolamine, released early but not late spasm. In sympathathectomized dogs, early spasm was milder than in untreated dogs; however, late spasm was the same as in untreated dogs. The authors discuss an etiological difference between early and late spasm.", 
    "26": "Electrocardiogram changes and pharmacologic responses were studied in 28 cases of brain death. Cardiac activity in this condition is possibly determined by the dynamic balance between the depressant action of hypothermia and the stimulating action of the sympathetic nervous system (without any vagal or central influence). The electrocardiographic alterations are the results of this dual influence, and are probably characteristic of this condition. In the initial stage of brain death the ECG shows J waves in the terminal part of the QRS, prolongation of the QT interval and the ST-T changes; in the advanced stages, progressive showing of the heart rate and the depolarization and repolarization processes are observed (manifested by gradual accentuation of the findings mentioned above); in the terminal stage dynamic electrocardiographic changes (among them, progressive depression of sinus activity, atrial fibrillation, atrioventricular and intraventricular conduction disturbances and severe ST-T changes) appear. It is possible that additional factors, like metabolic changes and possible myocardial damage in some instances, may have some influence on the electrocardiographic pattern. Final conclusions cannot be drawn from these preliminary observations. The atropine test was found to be an efficient and simple diagnostic aid in cases of brain death.", 
    "27": "The antihypertensive effect of two adrenergic blocking agents (Alprenolol and Propranolol) have been studied in a group of 107 patients with essential hypertension. A significant reduction of 20 mmHg in the systolic blood pressure was recorded for the group using Alprenolol and 25 mmHg in the group using Propranolol. The corresponding decrease of 7-10 mmHg in the diastolic blood pressure for the entire group was also significant. These two drugs may be of therapeutic value in essential hypertension, independently or in combination with other antihypertensive drugs.", 
    "28": "In order to determine if increased caloric intake could be responsible for the insulin resistance and elevated plasma glucose, insulin, and triglyceride levels commonly associated with obesity, hypercaloric diets were fed for 3 wk to eight normal subjects, and the metabolic consequences of this diet were assessed before significant weight gain had occurred. One wk of increased caloric intake led to statistically significant increases in fasting plasma insulin (22 per cent), glucose (5 per cent), and triglyceride (30 per cent) levels, as well as an increased insulin response (20 per cent) to oral glucose. Since the average weight gain during this period was only 1.6 kg, the observed changes appear to be secondary to increased caloric consumption, not obesity. Most of these changes returned toward baseline values during the succeeding 2 wk of increased caloric intake, but statistically significant elevations of fasting plasma glucose (10 per cent), insulin (8 per cent) and cholesterol (15 per cent) levels were still seen at the end of the hypercaloric dietary period. On the other hand, insulin resistance, as estimated by direct measurement of insulin responsiveness, did not change as a result of 3 wk of increased caloric intake. These results indicate that acute increases in caloric intake can lead to elevated plasma glucose, insulin, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. These changes occurred before significant weight gain had taken place, and raised the possibility that at least some of the abnormalities of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism attributed to obesity may be due to increased caloric intake. However, this conclusion would not seem to apply to the insulin resistance associated with obesity, as 3 wk of increased caloric intake did not produce any change in the responsiveness of these subjects to insulin's action.", 
    "29": "Two different sympathetic cardiovascular reflexes and the urinary catecholamines were studied to try to predict which patients would respond best to antihypertensive treatment with alprenolol, a beta-adrenergic blocking drug. The antihypertensive effect of sustained release tablets of alprenolol (200 mg twice daily) in 19 young patients with labile hypertension was confirmed. The treatment effectively reduced the tachycardia produced by the Valsalva manoeuvre and by nitroglycerin, and reduced the rise in systolic blood pressure after the Valsalva manoeuvre. The excretion of catecholamines was not affected. Neither the sympathetic cardiovascular reflexes produced by the Valsalva manoeuvre and nitroglycerin nor the excretion of catecholamines revealed which patients would respond best to alprenolol.", 
    "30": "The effect of the calcium ionophore A23187 on contractility in guinea pig left atria was studied. This ionophore increased both the force of contraction and the rate of tension development in a concentration dependent manner. The positive inotropic effect of A23187 is not mediated by activation of beta-receptors or by the release of endogenous catecholamines since neither propranolol nor pretreatment with reserpine altered the inotropic effect of this agent. Our studies of the dependence of contractile force on external calcium indicate that A23187 enhances the response of atrial muscle to external calcium ions. Since A23187 is known to facilitate the movement of calcium across biological membranes, we believe the ionophore may be acting either by increasing calcium influx across the myocardial cell membrane or by facilitating calcium release from sarcoplasmic reticulum.", 
    "31": "A life-threatening, severe, hypertension refractory to conventional antihypertensive drugs developed in a 10-year-old girl in association with a functional renal transplant. Minoxidil, a new vasodilator, proved to be a life-saving antihypertensive drug and prevented the removal of the functional transplant. During 9 months of minoxidil therapy the blood pressure remained controlled and the renal transplant function excellent. No serious side effects except a moderate hypertrichosis have been observed. It appears that minoxidil can be used to control refractory, life-threatening hypertension in children.", 
    "32": "Precise quantitation of the effects of the non-selective beta adrenergic blocking drug propranolol (3.15 mg/kg body weight) on left ventricular function, segmental wall motion, and diastolic pressure-volume relation in man has been performed. High fidelity left ventricular pressure measurements and simultaneous single-plane angiocardiograms were recorded on a video disc and volumes calculated by a light-pen computer system. Systolic segmental wall motion was computer analysed using the long axis-quadrasection method. Patients were transvenously atrially paced to maintain a constant heart rate. The haemodynamic effects of propranolol may vary depending upon the extent of pre-existing myocardial disease. In some patients ventricular function, as measured by ejection fraction, may be reduced. This reduction in ejection fraction appears to result from overall reduction in segmental wall motion, but also from accentuation of segmental wall abnormalities. These results are consistent with the thesis that beta adrenergic blocking drugs may inhibit compensatory sympathetic mechanisms. The diastolic effects of propranolol may include quite substantial increases in ventricular volumes in those patients with impaired cardiac function. With respect to the intact human ventricle, propranolol may increase diastolic volume for a given level of ventricular pressure. Thus, in a static sense, the ventricle in these patients could be viewed as being more compliant after propranolol administration. However, the fact that the length-tension relation, as measured by the slope of the logarithmic pressure versus volume plot is unaltered by propranolol, suggests that the muscle comprising the ventricle itself exhibits no alteration in its passive elastic properties.", 
    "33": "(Minus) [3-H] alprenolol, a potent beta-adrenergic antagonist, was used to identify binding sites in a fraction of canine cyocardium. Beta adrenergic agonists and antagonists compete for these binding sites in a manner which directly parallels their known affinity for the cardiac beta-adrenergic receptor. Thus, binding was highly stereo-specific, with the (minus) isomers of beta-adrenergic agonists or antagonists being at least two orders of magnitude more potent than were the (plus) isomers in competing for these sites. The order of potency for inhibition of binding by beta-adrenergic agonists was (minus) isoproterenol greater than (minus) epinephrine greater than (minus) norepinephrine. The dissociation constant (KD) of (minus) alprenolol for the beta-adrenergic receptors was 7-11 nM as determined independently by direct binding studies or by inhibition of isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase [ATP pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing), EC 4.6.1.1]. The beta-adrenergic antagonist (minus) propranolol also had high affinity for the binding sites (KD equals 12 nM). The physiologically inactive catechol-containing compounds pyrocatechol and (plus or minus) dihydroxymandelic acid, as well as the metabolite (plus or minus) normetanephrine, and the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine did not compete for the binding sites at a concentration of 160 muM. Binding was rapid (t1/2 less than 30 sec) and was rapidly reversible (t1/2 less than 15 sec). The binding sites were saturable and bound 0.35 pmol of (minus) [3-H] alprenolol per mg of membrane protein. These characteristics suggest that these binding sites represent the cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "34": "To investigate hypothalamic-pituitary functions and the primary site of the lesion in idiopathic pituitary dwarfism, various pituitary function tests, especially the pituitary hormone responses to the hypophysiotropic hormones were studied in 23 patients with idiopathic pituitary dwarfism. A few cases showed slight responses of GH to GH stimulation tests. Gonadotropin deficiencies were most frequently noted among pituitary hormones. The basal levels and the responses of plasma LH and FSH to LH-RH test were diminished markedly in all of the cases except in 5 cases with isolated GH deficiency. Responses of LH and FSH to LH-RH improved markedly after a long term administration of LH-RH for a period of one month in 2 patients with gonadotropin deficiency. As to TSH axis, half of the cases accompanied hypothyroidism. However, the responses of TSH to TRH were normal in all of the cases regardless of the thyroid function. The basal levels and the responses of plasma cortisol and 11-deoxycortisol to the rapid metopirone test were also impaired in about half of the cases. Basal levels of plasma prolactin were normal in all of the cases and the responses of prolactin to TRH were normal in cases with normal thyroid function, but slightly delayed in cases with hypothyroidism. It is concluded from the above observations that the incidences of various pituitary hormone deficiencies were quite high in this disorder and hypophysiotropic hormone deficiencies may cause pituitary hormone deficiencies. Therefore, it is suggested that the primary site of the lesion in this disorder might be at the hypothalamus.", 
    "35": "1 Propranolol and pindolol reduced both the blood pressure and plasma renin activity when given chronically to hypertensive patients. 2 There was no correlation between the fall in blood pressure and the fall in plasma renin activity. 3 Neither the basal nor the random plasma renin activity predicted the patients who would respond to beta-adrenergic receptor blocking drugs. 4 Oral propranolol reduced plasma renin activity but did not reduce blood pressure within 4 h of administration; oral pindolol reduced blood pressure but did not reduce plasma renin activity within 4 h of administration. 5 The reduction of blood pressure by propranolol and pindolol does not seem to be mediated by changes in plasma renin in most patients.", 
    "36": "During the post-operative period, there is no intestinal paralysis, but simply a transient disorder of motility, the duration and intensity of which are different in the stomach, small intestine and colon. The asynchronism between regularisation of motor activity of the small intestine, which is almost immediate, and that of the colon, which occurs later, is responsible for the clinical picture usually noted. In the light of these new findings, the author analyses the various factors liable to modify the course of post-operative and attempts to suggest appropriate management of the immediate post-operative period.", 
    "37": "Isoprenaline, propranolol, alprenol and sotalol administered intraventricularly (ivc) to anaesthetized rats induce hypotension. Propanolol and alprenolol given ivc to rats pretreated with isoprenaline increase blood pressure up to the values equal to those, previous to isoprenaline administration; another isoprenaline dose acts slightly hypotensively.", 
    "38": "Fifteen years after the introduction of beta adrenergic blocking drugs into clinical medicine, there is satisfactory evidence indicating that this class of drug has significant anti-arrhythmic activity. The chief indications for using these drugs are for the control of sinus tachycardia digitalis dysrhythmias and for the control of rapid ventricular rates atrial and ventricular dysrhythmias. The mode of action is by antagonizing the cardiac actions of catecholamines on cardiac automaticity and conduction.", 
    "39": "Atrio--ventricular conduction and its modifications induced by six Beta-adrenergic blocking agents have been investigated in the dog. Premature atrial stimuli (St2) were applied at variable intervals following regular stimuli (St1) ensuring atrial pacing; atrial (AERP), nodoventricular (NERP) and global (GERP) effective refractory periods as well as global functional refractory period (GFRP) were determined before and after administration of each of the six drugs. When Beta-blockade was produced with d,1-propranolol which hwas membrane stabilizing effects (MSE) but no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) or with sotalol, which has neither MSE nor ISA, all parameters were significantly increased. When Beta-blockade was achieved with pindolol or practolol, which have only a poor Beta-adrenolytic potency and no ISA. Alprenolol showed intermediate effects. Thus, it appears that Beta-blockade and not MSE, is responsible for the onset of A-V conduction impairment but that ISA, probably through a metabolic mechanism, affords protection against this impairment. On the other hand, measurement of ventricular effective refractory period (VERP) has shown that at the Purkinje-free junction, it is MSE which is mainly involved in conduction impairment.", 
    "40": "1. AH 5158, 5-(1-hydroxy-2-((1-methyl-3-phenylpropyl)amino)ethyl)salicylamide, competitively antagonised phenylephrine-induced vasopressor responses in anaesthetized dogs, thus confirming that the drug possesses alpha-adrenoceptor blocking activity. 2. In contrast, AH 5158 was a relatively ineffective antagonist of vasopressor responses to noradrenaline in anesthetized dogs. Thus, at the lowest dose-level tested (1 mg/kg) AH 5158 abolished the increase in pulse width caused by noradrenaline, but otherwise had little or no blocking effect in doses as high as 10 mg/kg. Propranolol (0.1 mg/kg) also abolished the increase in pulse width caused by noradrenaline. With both drugs this effect is thought to be a consequence of blockade of the beta-adrenoceptor-mediated cardia stimulant action of noradrenaline. 3. The interaction between AH 5158 and noradrenaline in spinal dogs, anaesthetized cats and pithed rats was very similar to that seen in anaesthetized dogs. 4. Noradrenaline pressor responses were effectively antagonized by AH 5158 in anaesthetized dogs pretreated with cocaine. The degree of block was similar to that obtained when phenylephrine was the agonist in untreated dogs. 5. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that AH 5158 blocks a cocaine-sensitive inactivation process for noradrenaline in addition to blocking alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors. The resultant increase in the level of circulating noradrenaline would tend to counteract the adrenoceptor blocking action of the drug. 6. The implications of these findings are discussed.", 
    "41": "1. In an attempt to clarify the role of the sympathetic neurone in the antihypertensive action of propranolol, the effect of this drug on responses to lumbar sympathetic nerve stimulation has been studied in the perfused hind-limb of the dog. 2. No consistent reduction of maximal or submaximal responses to nerve stimulation was produced by propranolol (10 to 100 mug/kg). In contrast, potentiation of nerve-evoked response, as well as those to injected noradrenaline, usually occurred. Dexpropranolol (50 mug/kg) had no effect. 3. When neuronal uptake of noradrenaline was inhibited by desmethylimipramine or cacaine, no reduction in responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation was observed with propranolol. 4. No evidence was found, using alpha-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, that released transmitter stimulates beta-adrenoceptors in the blood vessels of the hind-limb. 5. No evidence has been found for the existence of an adrenergic neurone-blocking action of propranolol that might contribute to the antihypertensive activity in man.", 
    "42": "Blood flow through the femoral artery, lymph flow in a lymphatic vessel in the femoral triangle and metatarsal distal venous pressure were measured simultaneously in a canine moving hind limb. 2. Low intra-arterial doses of adrenaline and noradrenaline increased lymph flow even in the presence of marked arterial vasoconstriction. In contrast, isoprenaline increased arterial blood flow without affecting lymph flow rate. 3. Phenoxybenzamine, dihydroergotoxine, and nicergoline did not inhibit the lymphatic flow increase induced by adrenaline at doses active on arterial or venous vascular alpha-adrenoceptors. 4. Propranolol given intra-arterially into animals pretreated with alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agents restored the vasoconstrictor effect of adrenaline (reversal of adrenaline reversal).", 
    "43": "The effects of the adrenergic agonists norepinephrine, epinephrine, isoproterenol, and phenylephrine upon femoral arterial blood flow were measured in baboons before and after alpha (phenoxybenzamine) and beta (propranolol) adrenergic receptor blockade. Flow was measured with an electromagnetic flowmeter. Arterial and venous pressures were recorded simultaneously. Femoral vascular resistance was calculated from these data. Catecholamines were injected intra-arterially (10(-3)--10(0) mug, base, kg.(-1) and intravenously (1.0 mug kg.(-1) in a randomized sequence. All four adrenergic amines were vasodilators at low dose (10(-3) mug kg.(-1), intra-arterially) and this effect was abolished during beta adrenergic receptor blockade. Intra-arterial isoproterenol elicited dose-dependent increases in femoral flow; the other amines were vasoconstrictors at high doses. Alpha adrenergic blockade \"reversed\" the vasoconstrictor effects of these three amines. At the same dose isoproterenol increased flow more through the intra-arterial than the intravenous route. Conversely, norepinephrine and epinephrine were potent femoral vasodilators when injected intravenously. The findings indicate that the classical adrenergic amines are all vasodilators of the subhuman primate hindlimb at low doses due to their interaction with beta receptor sites. The fact that epinephrine and norepinephrine exert a greater increase in flow when given intravenously than when given intra-arterially is presumably secondary to increased arterial pressure, in turn due to the vasoconstrictor effects of these agents on other regional circulations.", 
    "44": "A brief characteristics of the main therapeutic methods for shock in acute myocardial infarction cases is presented, including fast infusion of plasma-substitutes, noradrenalin, isoproterenol, alpha-adrenergic bocking agents, steroid hormones, intra-aortal balloon counter-pulsation, oxygen therapy, acidbase balance correction, etc. It is emphasized that proper therapy based on the evaluation of the nature of circulatory disorders in every particular case proves effective in some cases.", 
    "45": "A subcutaneous injection of an oil suspension of l-epinephrine (270 mumol/kg), dopamine (270 mumol/kg) or l-norepinephrine (270 mumol/kg), when administered with phenoxybenzamine (32 mumol/kg i.p.) to blocl alpha adrenergic effects, increases the cyclic 3', 5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) content in superior cervical ganglia (SCG) of rats. The increase is highest after l-epinephrine and dopamine and is barely detectable after l-norepinephrine; it lasts longer than 2 hours after l-epinephrine, about 30 minutes after dopamine and is fleeting after l-norepinephrine. The duration of the increase in cAMP elicited by l-epinephrine in SCG of rats is dose-related. Furthermore, when the cAMP increase lasts longer than 90 minutes, 48 hours later the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity in SCG is increased. l0Epinephrine (150 mol/kg s.c.) induces TH in decentralized ganglia. One injection of l-isoproterenol (77 mol/kg i.p.) increases cAMP concentrations in intact and decentralized SCG. This increase lasts only 30 minutes and fails to induce TH 48 hours later. However, if the increase of cAMP concentration is prolonged by four successive injections of l-isoproterenol (15 30-minute intervals) the TH activity of intact and decentralized SCG is increased 48 hours later.l-Isoproterenol (four injections of 77 mumol/kg, each) and l-epinephrine (270 mumol/kg) fail to induce TH in the adrenal medulla. dl-Propranolol (125 mumol/kg i.p.) injected 30 minutes before l-isoproterenol blocks the increase of cAMP content and the delayed induction of TH activity in SCG. The elevation of TH activity elicited in SCG by beta adrenergic receptor agonists is always preceded by an increase of cAMP concentration lasting 90 minutes or longer. However, the induction of TH elicited by cold exposure or by reserpine administration can occur without an apparent increase in ganglionic cAMP concentration.", 
    "46": "A forced oscillations technique for measuring total respiratory system resistance was used to quantitate the bronchomotor activity of Sch 15280: (5[4-(N-methyl)-piperidylidine]5H-[1]-benzopyrano[2,3,b]-pyridine maleate) and to compare its potency to that of standard bronchodilator agents. By the intravenous route, Sch 15280 was 48 times more potent than aminophylline and 1/78 as potent as atropine in inhibiting methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction in rabbits. In cats Sch 15280 was 1/12 as potent as ephedrine in inhibiting histamine-induced bronchoconstriction and had a greater protective activity against histamine-induced bronchoconstriction and had a longer duration of action than 0.5% solution of isoproterenol. Statistical tests of parallelism revealed a significant difference between the log dose-response curves of Sch 15280 and ephedrine but not between those of Sch 15280, atropine and aminophylline. The results suggest that Sch 15280 can act via, a nonadrenergic mechanism to block both histaminergically and cholinergically mediated responses in the tracheobronchial tree. This pharmacologie profile may have important therapeutic application in the type I immediate hypersensitivity reactions of man.", 
    "47": "The effects of dl-propranolol, d-propranolol, butoxamine or practolol on erythropoietin (ESF) production in rabbits exposed to hypoxia (0.42 atmosphere) for 18 hours were investigated. Rabbits treated with dl-propranolol (4 or 8 mg/kg i.p.) or butoxamine (15 or 30 mg/kg i.p.) produced significantly less ESF in response to hypoxia than did saline-treated control animals. ESF production in rabbits given d-propranolol or practolol during hypoxia was not significantly different from that of control animals exposed to hypoxia. Based on the proposed selectivity of butoxamine for beta2 adrenergic receptors and of practolol for beta1 adrenergic receptors, it is suggested that ESF production in rabbits exposed to hypoxia may involve the activation of beta2 adrenergic receptors.", 
    "48": "In eleven dogs made hypotensive by means of rapid exsanguination over a period of forty to seventy minutes, mean glucagon rose to a peak of 516 plus or minus (S.E.) 150 pg/ml. and mean glucose to a peak of 341 plus or minus 27 mg. per 100 ml. The hyperglucagonemia induced by exsanguination was substantially reduced, although not abolished, by propranolol infusion, but was not diminished by phentolamine, suggesting that it was largely a beta-adrenergic effect. Its possible contribution to survival during shock is considered.", 
    "49": "In addition to its potent antileukemic properties, cyclocytidine has a sialogogue action that depends on stimulation of beta adrenergic ereceptors of salivary glands. Furthermore, when chronically administered (for 3 days), cyclocytidine caused enlargement of parotid and submaxillary glands and heart that resembled the hypertrophy caused by chronic isoproterenol administration. The salivas evoked by cyclocytidine also closely resembled those evoked by isoproterenol, and were extremely viscous, and high in K+, (121 plus or minus 5.6, for submaxillary, and 42 plus or minus 2.9, for parotid), low in flow rate (0.007 mg/min times mg) and parotid saliva contained high concentrations of amylase (805 plus or minus 33 mg/mg gland). Cyclocytidine also caused marked emptying of parotid gland amylase. The cyclocytidine-induced salivary flow and gland emptying of amylase were prevented for 90 min when propranolol (but not dibenzyline or atropine) was administered prior to injection of the cyclocytidine. In addition, when the superior cervical ganglion was acutely removed, administration of cyclocytidine elicited salivary flow from the denervated as well as the innervated glands. These findings suggest that cyclocytidine does not affect salivary glands through indirect central or ganglionic actions. Cyclocytidine action does not exclusively involve beta receptors, since even in the presence of propranolol, secretory flow was evident after 90 min but when dibenzyline was given with the propranolol, complete blockade of cyclocytidine-stimulated saliva was effected. The dominant effect is, however, a beta adrenergic one. The undesirable side effects of cyclocytidine (parotid pain, postural hypotension, and cardiac hypertrophy) probably stem chiefly from its beta adrenergic properties and might be eliminated (or at least modified) by administration of propranolol with the cyclocytidine.", 
    "50": "Adequate treatment of hypertension requires that the physician understand the pharmacologic actions of antihypertensive agents. Although no drug is without adverse reactions, it should be possible to choose an agent or combination of agents which can effectively lower blood pressure and be tolerated by the patient. The indications, proposed mechanisms of actions and adverse effects of the following antihypertensive drugs are discussed: thiazide diuretics, spironolactone, triamterene, trimethaphan, Rauwolfia alkaloids. guanethidine, bethanidine, methyldopa, clonidine, pargyline, propranolol, hydrazaline, minoxidil, guancydine, diazoxide and sodium nitroprusside.", 
    "51": "Plasma levels and the effect of orally administered metoprolol on the resting arterial blood pressure and heart rate have been studied during acute and steady-state conditions in patients with mild hypertension. The patients receiving an 80-mg dose had a mean maximum plasma level of about 100 ng/ml plasma in single-dose studies and about 140 ng/ml plasma during steady-state conditions. The corresponding values for the patients on the 50-mg dose were about 60 and 100 ng/ml plasma, respectively. The maximum concentrations were reached 1 hr after administration. After the single dose the elimination half-life of metoprolol in plasma was 4.3 plus or minus 0.7 hr in the patients receiving the 80-mg dose and 3.8 plus or minus 0.3 hr in the other group. The difference was not statistically significant. The elimination half-life in the plasma was about the same in the single-dose study and during steady state in both groups. The morning dose induced a decrease of the systolic blood pressure whereas the diastolic blood pressure was not significantly different from that recorded immediately before administration of metoprolol. For the 80-mg dose the systolic pressure dropped from 167 plus or minus 4 to 146 plus or minus 4 mm Hg in the single dose study and from 160 plus or minus 8 to 140 plus or minus 4 mm Hg at steady state. The corresponding values for the 50-mg dose were 150 plus or minus 3 to 135 plus or minus 3 mm Hg and 144 plus or minus 3 to 138 plus or minus 3 mm Hg, respectively. In experiments with placebo the systolic blood pressure was not significantly changed. There was no correlation between the plasma levels and the effect on the systolic blood pressure. Both doses of metoprolol markedly reduced the heart rate after the single dose as well as at steady state. The effect was linearly related to the logarithm of the plasma concentration, and the relationship was virtually the same as obtained previously for the effect on exercise heart rate in healthy volunteers.", 
    "52": "The antihypertensive efficacy of a new beta-adrenergic receptor inhibiting compound, timolol (MK-950), was evaluated using two treatment protocols: double-blind timolol vs. placebo treatment and double-blind timolol vs. propranolol (10 and 12 patients, respectively). These studies indicate that timolol significantly and safely reduced arterial pressure in mild to moderately severe essential hypertensive patients. The reduction in mean arterial pressure with timolol was equivalent to the pressure reduction with propranolol when the doses of 30 and 120 mg. per day, respectively, were used.", 
    "53": "1 Infusion of isoprenaline into dorsal hand veins preconstricted with noradrenaline produced vasodilatation in four subjects out of five which was reversed by addition of propranolol. It is confirmed that beta-adrenoceptors are present in the hand veins of most subjects. 2 Addition of either propranolol or practolol to infusions of vasoconstrictor doses of noradrenaline potentiated the vasoconstriction in the hand vein. 3 After systemic administration of propranolol (0.3 mg/kg) or of practolol (1.0 mg/kg) intravenously, the sensitivity of the hand vein to the vasoconstrictor activity of noradrenaline was increased by 7.5 times and 2.9 times respectively. Significant reductions in hand skin temperature and resting pulse rate occurred after propranolol only. 4 It is suggested that this may be a useful method for the quantitative estimation of peripheral vascular beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity in man. At the doses used, significant beta-adrenoceptor blockade appears to occur at this site with practolol as well as propranolol.", 
    "54": "In local application of substances with a mediator action (adrenaline, acetylcholine, histamine) and blockers of specific receptors (dihydroergotoxin, inderal, atropine and of subcutaneous dimedrol) together with dicaine it was possible to reveal a distinct presence in the cornea of the eye of the mediator receptors capable of influencing one another. Pharmacological analysis permitted a supposition to be made that there were two receptor systems in the sensory nerve endings of the cornea; these systems were in reciprocal inhibitory relations; due to this their regular influence on the processes of excitation and inhibition is effected in the sensory nerve ending.", 
    "55": "Cyclic adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphosphate (cyclic AMP) as measured by radioimmunoassay is found in diced rat lung in an amount approximating one picomole per milligram of wet weight lung tissue. Incubation of rat lung with adrenaline, a beta adrenergic agent, produced a rapid increase in cyclic AMP, 100% increase at 15 seconds and 340% at 2 minutes. Isoprenaline was more stimulatory than adrenaline; noradrenaline was less stimulatory, and ephedrine produced a negligible effect. The methylxanthines, caffeine and theophylline, produced an increase in cyclic AMP concentration. Of these, caffeine was more potent, and synergism with adrenaline was demonstrated. The beta adrenergic blocking agent, propranolol, completely inhibited the expected rise in cyclic AMP secondary to adrenaline stimulation. In contrast, the alpha blocker, phentolamine, produced no effect. This animal model offers evidence that adrenergic agents and methylxanthines act to increase cyclic AMP in lung tissue. It is likely that many of the beneficial effects of these drugs in pulmonary patients occur through similar changes and modulation of the cyclic AMP system."
