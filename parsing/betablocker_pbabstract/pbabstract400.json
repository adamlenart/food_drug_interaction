The aim of this randomised, double-blind four way crossover study was to assess the interaction between the new calcium antagonist, lacidipine and atenolol, in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. 2. Sitting blood pressure at 4 h post-dosing with lacidipine (4 mg) and atenolol (100 mg) alone was significantly lower compared with placebo (137/89 +/- 3/3 mmHg; 142/89 +/- 5/3 mmHg; and 154/98 +/- 5/3 mmHg respectively; P < 0.001). Co-administration of both drugs produced a significant additive effect compared with atenolol and lacidipine alone (124/80 +/- 4/2 mmHg; P < 0.002). 3. Heart rate on treatment with lacidipine alone was significantly greater at 4 h compared with placebo (86 +/- 1 beats min-1 and 74 +/- 2 beats min-1 respectively; P < 0.001). When both drugs were used in combination, there was a significant decrease in pulse rate compared with lacidipine alone (58 +/- 1 beats min-1 and 86 +/- 1 beats min-1 respectively; P < 0.001). 4. Home blood pressure recordings confirmed the statistically significant reduction in blood pressure on co-dosing (120/82 +/- 10/2 mmHg) compared with lacidipine (140/92 +/- 5/3 mmHg) and atenolol (146/90 +/- 6/3 mmHg) given alone (P < 0.05). 5. Lacidipine alone produced a significant exercise tachycardia compared with atenolol alone and the atenolol/lacidipine combination (97 +/- 8 beats min-1; 65 +/- 4 beats min-1 and 75 +/- 7 beats min-1 respectively; P < 0.001). Exercise tolerance was not adversely affected by the co-administration of both lacidipine and atenolol.", 
    "1": "1. Plasma binding of tritium-labelled racemic propranolol (P) was measured by equilibrium dialysis. The unbound enantiomers were separated by h.p.l.c. after chiral derivatization. The binding of (-)-P was higher than that of (+)-P. 2. Contrary to previous suggestions, a sex difference in the plasma binding of the P enantiomers (9 young women, 12 young men) was not observed. The unbound percentage of (-)-P was 9.2 +/- 1.8 (mean +/- s.d.) in women vs 9.1 +/- 1.7 in men; for (+)-P it was 10.8 +/- 1.8 vs 10.8 +/- 2.1. 3. In the nine women, the binding did not change with fluctuating plasma oestradiol concentrations during the menstrual cycle. Testosterone cypionate doubled the circulating concentrations of testosterone in eight men but had no effect on P binding. 4. Ethinyl oestradiol (50 micrograms day-1) alone or together with norethindrone (OCD) in eight of the women produced an increase in the unbound percentage of both (-)-P (11.4 +/- 2.6 vs 9.5 +/- 1.6 for control; P < 0.001) and (+)-P (13.2 +/- 2.5 vs 11.2 +/- 1.5 for control; P < 0.001). This was due to a decrease in the plasma concentrations of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein from 0.54 +/- 0.11 mg ml-1 in control to 0.37 +/- 0.08 mg ml-1 (P < 0.001) during ethinyl oestradiol treatment. 5. Enantioselectivity in the unbound fraction of P increased with increasing total binding from a (-)/(+)-ratio of 0.93 at 84% binding to a (-)/(+)-ratio of 0.78 at 94% binding (P < 0.001).", 
    "2": "In a 3-month, double-masked, randomized clinical trial, the ocular hypotensive efficacy and systemic safety of 0.5% levobunolol and 2% carteolol were compared in 59 patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The overall mean decrease in intraocular pressure was 7.3 mm Hg (27.4%) in the 0.5% levobunolol group and 4.1 mm Hg (14.8%) in the carteolol group. This difference was statistically significant (p = 0.0004). Changes in visual field and cup-disk ratios were few and similar between the groups. Effects on mean heart rate were noted in both treatment groups. The mean decrease in heart rate in the carteolol group was greater (-8.4 beats/min) than in the levobunolol group (-3.1 beats/min). This difference had marginal statistical significance (p = 0.059). We conclude that 0.5% levobunolol and 2% carteolol administered twice daily differ in lowering intraocular pressure as well as in their effects on heart rate.", 
    "3": "A comprehensive study was undertaken to examine the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interaction of propranolol and nifedipine in 11 patients with stable angina of effort who were treated for a long time. It was shown that when the agents were given in combination, the patient's plasma generated the same profiles of their concentrations as used alone. This suggests that the propranolol + nifedipine combination is safe from the point of their pharmacokinetic interaction. The latter occurs at the level of their pharmacodynamic effects.", 
    "4": "Acebutolol (sectral) is one of the new types of cardioselective beta-blockers which has at the same time also qualities of ISA. The author made a 6-month clinical study comprising 20 patients, focused on the antihypertensive effectiveness and tolerance of the drug. Administration of acebutolol led already after two weeks to a significant effect on the systolic and diastolic blood pressure and during the period of 1-6-month administration the maximal antihypertensive effect was achieved (-29 mm Hg systolic BP, -19 mm Hg diastolic BP). 24-hour monitoring of the BP proved antihypertensive effectiveness of acebutolol regardless whether the drug was administered in two daily doses or only once a day. In the course of the investigation no negative metabolic effects of acebutolol were observed.", 
    "5": "The combined effects of 1-menthol and ethanol as a skin permeation enhancer were evaluated with two equations describing the permeability coefficient through full-thickness skin (PFT) and the full-thickness skin/vehicle concentration ratio (CFT/CV) of drugs as a function of their octanol/vehicle partition coefficient (KOV). A two-layer model was applied for skin, which consists of a stratum corneum (SC) with lipid and porous pathways and a viable epidermis and dermis (ED). The two equations contain one variable (KOV) and nine coefficients, six of which (three diffusion coefficients, the porosity of the SC, and two terms of the linear free energy relationship) were considered different, dependent on the drug vehicle. In vitro permeation of four drugs (morphine hydrochloride, atenolol, nifedipine, and vinpocetine) was determined using excised hairless rat skin and four aqueous vehicles (water, 5% 1-menthol, 40% ethanol, and 5% 1-menthol-40% ethanol) to measure each PFT. Drug concentrations in full-thickness skin were also measured to obtain CFT/CV. A nonlinear least-squares method was employed to determine six coefficients using the two equations and experimentally obtained PFT and CFT/CV. The addition of 1-menthol to water and 40% ethanol increased the diffusion coefficient of drugs in lipid and pore pathways of SC, whereas the addition of ethanol to water and 5% 1-menthol increased the drug solubility in the vehicle, decreased the skin polarity, and increased the contribution of the pore pathway to whole-skin permeation.", 
    "6": "The selectivity of carbon monoxide binding to specific human cytochrome P450 isozymes was investigated by studying its inhibition of prototype reactions for 3 major drug metabolizing P450s in liver microsomes: dextromethorphan O-demethylation and (+)-bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation (P450DB1, CYP2D6), diclofenac 4'-hydroxylation (P450TB, CYP2C subfamily), and midazolam 1'-hydroxylation (P450NF, CYP3A subfamily). The affinity of carbon monoxide is different for each P450 isozyme. Warburg partition coefficients were 0.35, 1.1 and 3.9 microM for P450DB1, P450TB and P450NF, respectively. Differential inhibition by carbon monoxide may be a useful tool to identify specific human cytochrome P450 isozymes in the early screening of drug biotransformation catalysts. Further studies involving other P450 isozymes and substrates should extend our understanding of the phenomena and their implications.", 
    "7": "We investigated the effects of adrenergic, cholinergic and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-ergic agonists and antagonists on the amplitude of gastric phasic contractions in the anaesthetized rat using a volumetric model. The amplitude of the phasic contractions was reduced significantly by atropine, hexamethonium or bilateral cervical vagotomy indicating that cholinergic neural activity involving both muscarinic and nicotinic receptors and intact vagal nerve function are integral parts of the control of basal gastric phasic motility. In contrast, neither selective alpha 1-, alpha 2- or non-selective beta-blockers had any significant influence on the amplitude of the gastric contractions suggesting that adrenergic neurones are not tonically active in the maintenance of basal phasic motility in the stomach. The amplitude of the gastric phasic contractions was, however, significantly reduced by the alpha 1-agonist L-phenylephrine, the alpha 2-agonist clonidine and a close intraarterial injection of VIP (3 micrograms kg-1) but not be the selective beta 1-agonist, prenalterol, or the beta 2-agonist, salbutamol. These data suggest the presence of superimposed inhibitory control of phasic activity by VIP-ergic stimulation and by adrenergic neurones via alpha-receptor stimulation.", 
    "8": "Eleven patients with moderate to severe hypertension were studied at the Vargas Hospital of Caracas. The patients were pretreated with labetalol, 800 to 1200 mg/day, orally, over a period of 1 week, after which an intravenous infusion of dopamine, .5 to 3 micrograms/kg/minute, was given. Two intravenous dopamine infusions (30 minutes each) were performed before and after the injection of metoclopramide (30 mg, intravenous bolus). Two washout periods were also included before and after metoclopramide administration. Dopamine induced a decrease of blood pressure from 171.9 + 6.35/103.6 +/- 3.12 to 152.7 +/- 7.55/93.8 +/- 2.97 mm Hg (P < .001) without altering heart rate, and it increased plasma insulin levels from 8.29 +/- .70 microU/mL to 12.09 +/- 1.83 microU/mL (P < .01). Metoclopramide caused no changes of blood pressure or plasma insulin levels. Hypotensive responses and plasma insulin increases due to dopamine were blocked by metoclopramide, however. The authors conclude that a dopaminergic receptor may be involved in some cardiovascular responses and in modulating insulin secretion in humans.", 
    "9": "A direct, isocratic and simple chromatographic method is described for the enantiomeric separation of bevantolol (BEV) using normal and reverse cellulose tris (3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate) chiral stationary phases (CSPs) known as Chiralcel OD and Chiralcel OD-R, respectively. The effect of various alcohols present in the mobile phase on the separation factor (a) and resolution factor (Rs) has been studied. The method has been used to determine and identify the BEV enantiomers in human urine after oral administration of racemic BEV. The chiral recognition mechanism(s) between the analyte and these chiral stationary phases is proposed.", 
    "10": "Adipocyte precursors from the stromal vascular fraction of human adipose tissue were allowed to differentiate in serum-free defined medium, whereafter their catecholamine stimulated lipolytic response was compared to that of mature isolated human adipocytes. Seventy-five to ninety percent of the fibroblast-like cells accumulated lipid droplets and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activities of 1,000-2,800 mU/mg protein were measured in cell homogenates of differentiated cells. Lipolysis could be stimulated by both isoproterenol and norepinephrine in both differentiated preadipocytes as well as mature adipocytes. The results obtained with beta-adrenergic agents suggested the presence of a higher affinity receptor in differentiated preadipocytes as compared to mature adipocytes. Mature adipocytes responded well to beta-adrenergic agents, but no antilipolytic alpha 2-adrenergic response was observed in the differentiated preadipocytes. The presence of Gi proteins in the differentiated preadipocytes was suggested by the antilipolytic effect of adenosine as well as the lipolytic activity generated by pertussis toxin. In conclusion, our medium supported the differentiation of a very high percentage of human preadipocytes which developed a sensitive beta-adrenergic lipolytic response but which lacked an alpha 2-adrenergic antilipolytic response.",

    "12": "To review the pharmacology of labetalol and related compounds.", 
    "13": "Unlike \"pure\" beta blockers, labetalol maintains cardiac output, reduces total peripheral resistance, and does not decrease peripheral blood flow. It has been used to treat hypertension of all degrees of severity and may be especially useful in black patients, elderly patients, patients with renal disease, and in pregnancy. It can be used in conditions that produce catecholamine crises, such as pheochromocytoma, clonidine withdrawal, and cocaine overdose. Its hemodynamic profile is attractive for use in myocardial ischemia. The parenteral form is useful in situations where blood pressure must be lowered quickly. The major side effect is orthostatic hypotension, and hepatotoxicity has been reported.",

    "15": "Isoproterenol stimulates lipolysis in human omental adipocytes with an EC50 (concentration at which an agonist produces half-maximal stimulation) of 120 nM. CGP12177 (dl-4-3[(1,1-dimethylethyl) amino]-2-hydroxylpropoxy]1,3-dihydro-2H-benzimidazol-2-one hydrochloride), a potent beta 1-/beta 2- adrenergic receptor (AR) antagonist but being an agonist for atypical beta-AR, fails to stimulate lipolysis in these cells, even at a concentration as high as 0.1 mM. Since CGP12177 is a partial agonist, its failure to stimulate lipolysis may result from a poor stimulus-response coupling, so that it can not be excluded that atypical beta-AR are actually present and even functional in these cells. To evaluate this hypothesis, we estimated the potency of CGP12177 to inhibit the isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis. This inhibition curve reflects a single class of sites and the IC50-value (concentration at which an antagonist produces half-maximal inhibition) of CGP12177 (3.8 nM) is in good agreement with what should be expected for beta 1-AR/beta 2-AR. Moreover, metoprolol and atenolol, two beta 1- AR- selective antagonists, shift the isoproterenol dose-response curve to the right with high potency as well. These potencies are similar to the ones found for beta 1-AR in the human heart but appreciably higher than those which should be expected for atypical beta-AR. The present study suggest that atypical beta-AR are not functional in human omental adipocytes.", 
    "16": "Studies on the binding of 3H-dihydroalprenolol (3H-DHA) to astrocytes from cerebra of normal and hypothyroid rats show that hypothyroidism results in a decline in the beta-adrenergic receptors. Ontogenic studies indicated that in normal, euthyroid rats, the maximum binding capacity (Bmax) for 3H-DHA progressively increased with age while the affinity (Kd) remained unaltered. In astrocytes prepared from hypothyroid rats, total number of binding sites for 3H-DHA also increased with age, however, at a given age, the number was significantly lower than that for corresponding euthyroid animals while the affinity for 3H-DHA remained unaffected. Correspondingly, primary cultures of astrocytes from normal and hypothyroid brain when maintained in TH-deficient serum, display a similar reduction of 3H-DHA binding. In the case of astrocytes from hypothyroid brain cultured in TH-deficient serum, the decline can be largely restored by supplementing with normal serum. Results suggest that thyroid hormones (TH) directly or indirectly regulates the level of beta-adrenergic receptors in astrocytes from developing rat brain.", 
    "17": "A 51-year-old man with no history of liver disease had acute severe jaundice, with a serum level of total bilirubin of 27.4 mg/dl and an alkaline phosphatase level of 731 IU/L due to distal common bile duct compression from peripancreatic head fibrosis associated with retroperitoneal fibrous. Other obstructive phenomena in this patient included bilateral hydronephrosis from ureteral fibrosis encasement and testicular swelling from fibrous encasement of vessels draining the scrotum. Autopsy demonstrated massive retroperitoneal fibrosis, with angulation and compression of the distal common bile duct by fibrosis covering the head of the pancreas. The intrahepatic biliary tree was dilated because of the distal choledochal obstruction, but the proximal common bile duct was not dilated due to mural fibrosis.", 
    "18": "To investigate whether increased release of acetylcholine may be involved in propranolol-induced bronchoconstriction (PIB), the inhibitory effect of pilocarpine (Pilo), an agonist of M2-muscarinic receptors that in 11 stable asthmatic subjects. The bronchial responsiveness to Pilo was also measured in terms of Dmin, defined as the cumulative dose at the point where respiratory resistance (Rrs) began to increase. In PIB, the maximum increase in Rrs (Rrs max) after stopping inhalation for 1 min was measured. Atropine reversed PIB. After pilocarpine pretreatment at a dose equal to Dmin, Rrs max divided by baseline Rrs decreased significantly from 206.6 +/- 61.1 to 163.0 +/- 42.6% (mean +/- SD) (p = 0.001). The ratio of PIB (Rrs max/baseline Rrs) with Pilo to PIB without Pilo correlated inversely according to the pretreatment dose (Dmin) of Pilo (p < 0.05). These results suggest increased release of acetylcholine in PIB and that M2-muscarinic receptors are at least in part functioning in stable asthmatic airways.", 
    "19": "Furosemide has recently been shown to be effective in inhibiting various indirect challenges in asthmatic patients, but its mode of action is not yet clear. There is some evidence that furosemide has an inhibitory effect on sensory and cholinergic nerves in the airways. We have investigated the effects of furosemide, bumetanide, and nedocromil sodium on inhibitory nonadrenergic, noncholinergic (iNANC) responses in guinea pig trachea in vitro using electrical field stimulation (50 V, 0.5 ms, 2 to 32 Hz for 30 s) and exogenously applied vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) or nitroprusside. In the presence of atropine (1 microM), indomethacin (10 microM), and propranolol (1 microM), both furosemide and bumetanide but not nedocromil sodium produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of the iNANC response (maximum inhibition, 31.2 +/- 5.6% with 100 microM furosemide at 16 Hz and 44.2 +/- 4.1% with 10 microM bumetanide at 4 Hz). Furthermore, after pretreatment of the tissues with L-NG-monomethyl arginine (90 microM), alpha-chymotrypsin (2 U/ml), or both, furosemide and bumetanide produced a further inhibition of the iNANC relaxation. Neither loop diuretic had any effect on the concentration-response curves to exogenous VIP (10(-9) to 10(-7) M) or nitroprusside (10(-8) to 10(-6) M). These results indicate that loop diuretics may inhibit nonadrenergic relaxation in guinea pig trachea in vitro by a prejunctional mechanism, probably through inhibition of nerve activation, the exact mechanism of which is still undefined.", 
    "20": "To determine whether the cytokine interleukin (IL)-1 beta directly affects airway smooth muscle functions and, if so, what the mechanism of action is, we studied canine isolated bronchial segments under isometric conditions in vitro. Incubation of tissues with human recombinant IL-1 beta (10 ng/ml) for 150 min decreased the contractile responses to acetylcholine, histamine, and KCl. The inhibitory effect of IL-1 beta on the acetylcholine (10(-3) M)-induced contraction was concentration-dependent, the maximal decrease from the baseline contraction being 52 +/- 8% (mean +/- SD, p < 0.001) observed with 10 ng/ml IL-1 beta. Intracellular levels of cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP were not significantly altered by IL-1 beta. The IL-1 beta-induced inhibition of the contractile responses was not affected by pretreatment of tissues with indomethacin or propranolol, but it was greatly attenuated by mechanical removal of epithelium. These results suggest that IL-1 beta may play a protective role against bronchoconstrictor responses via epithelium-dependent mechanism such as the release of epithelium-derived relaxing factor.", 
    "21": "Inhalation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has been associated with increased airway responsiveness and inflammation both in humans and in animals. To investigate the contribution of capsaicin-sensitive nerves to these changes, we compared airway responsiveness and inflammation after intratracheal administration of 10 micrograms/kg LPS (Escherichia coli O55:B5 lipopolysaccharide) or saline in guinea pigs treated 10 days previously with 50 mg/kg capsaicin and in those pretreated with the capsaicin vehicle. Four hours after LPS, airway responsiveness and cell counts in the bronchoalveolar lavage were assessed. To determine airway responsiveness, guinea pigs were anesthetized, tracheotomized, and mechanically ventilated before exposure to increasing concentrations of aerosolized histamine (10(-4) to 10(-3) M). Capsaicin pretreatment prevented the LPS-induced increase in airway responsiveness in response to aerosolized histamine. It significantly reduced total cell recovery in the bronchoalveolar lavage after LPS (1,167 +/- 167 10(3) cells/ml in capsaicin-treated guinea pigs versus 2,171 +/- 184 10(3) in vehicle-treated guinea pigs) by reducing the LPS-induced influx of neutrophils and macrophages. Additional experiments demonstrated that the activity of neutral endopeptidase (NEP) in the tracheal epithelium was not significantly different in guinea pigs injected with LPS from that in the saline-treated control animals, and that the pretreatment with the NEP inhibitor phosphoramidon did not increase the LPS-induced influx of neutrophils into the bronchoalveolar lavage. These results demonstrate that in the guinea pig, capsaicin-sensitive nerves are involved in LPS-induced airway hyperresponsiveness and inflammation.", 
    "22": "Administration of timolol to one eye is associated with a decrease in intraocular pressure in both eyes. To further investigate this effect the contralateral decrease in intraocular pressure was measured in a three arm crossover study using a 0.1 mg dose of timolol given topically to an eye, a 0.1 mg dose of timolol given lingually, and a placebo given topically. Two hours after topical timolol administration the mean intraocular pressure reduction in the fellow eye was 3.1 mm Hg compared with baseline (p = 0.0007). Two hours after lingual timolol administration the mean intraocular pressure reduction was 3.9 mm Hg compared with baseline (p = 0.0004). Two hours after topical administration of placebo the mean intraocular pressure reduction in the fellow eye was only 0.33 mm Hg (p = 0.6). These findings suggest the contralateral reduction in intraocular pressure from timolol is caused by systemic absorption. The significant intraocular pressure reduction obtained from lingual timolol raises the possibility that this route of drug administration may be useful in selected patients who cannot use eye drops.", 
    "23": "The exercise- and drug-induced potassium shifts in pregnant women was studied. Six healthy nonpregnant women, six healthy pregnant women and four hypertensive, pregnant women on labetalol performed a bicycle exercise test. Blood samples for plasma potassium concentrations were drawn before, during and after the exercise. The exercise-induced plasma potassium increase was 0.9 +/- 0.2 mmol/l in healthy control women and 0.8 +/- 0.1 mmol/l in healthy pregnant women. In hypertensive pregnant women on labetalol the increase was 0.3 +/- 0.3 mmol/l (P < 0.01). There was a negative correlation (r = 0.941, P = 0.05) between the plasma potassium and labetalol concentration. Our results suggest that the potassium exchange during normal pregnancy is not changed. Labetalol reduced the exercise-induced plasma potassium increase which contrasts to other beta-blocking agents which usually augment the plasma potassium increase caused by exercise.", 
    "24": "There is an expectation that ocular inserts, regardless of the nature of the polymer, will faithfully reduce systemic drug absorption. This may not necessarily be so, however, since not all polymers would release drug at the same rate and to the same extent. The objective of the present study was to determine how drug release rate from various polymeric ocular inserts may influence systemic timolol absorption in the pigmented rabbit. The inserts tested were made of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC), or partial ethyl ester of poly(vinyl methyl ether/maleic anhydride) (PVMMA), approximately 89.4% w/w in all cases. Some polyvinyl alcohol inserts contained timolol in salt form with Carbopol 940 (PVA-C940), 8.6% w/w. The time course of timolol in plasma over 6 hr was monitored using reversed phase HPLC. While all inserts reduced the peak timolol concentration in plasma (Cmax), only the PVA and HPC inserts, which released timolol rapidly in vitro, reduced the extent of systemic timolol absorption (AUC). On the other hand, both PVA-C940 and PVMMA inserts, which released timolol relatively slowly in vitro, increased the extent of systemic timolol absorption. Moreover, the time at which peak timolol concentration was achieved in the plasma was much delayed, raising the possibility of delayed timolol absorption until discharge of the presumably viscous and/or mucoadhesive solutions of PVA-C940 and PVMMA inserts into the nasal cavity. It may be concluded that not all polymeric ocular inserts reduce systemic timolol absorption. Whether an insert would do so depends on the interplay of residence time in the conjunctival sac and rate of drug release from the insert.", 
    "25": "The effects of a continuous wave or pulse-modulated, 900 MHz microwave field were studied by in vitro assays of rat chemoreceptors. The pulsed field was modulated as rectangular waves at rates of 1, 6, 16, 32, 75, or 100 pps. The pulse-period to pulse-duration ratio was 5 in all cases, and specific absorption rates (SARs) ranged from 0.5 to 18 W/kg. Binding of ligands to cell membranes was differentially affected by exposure to microwaves. For example, binding of H3-glutamic acid to hippocampal cells was not altered by a 15 min exposure to a continuous wave field at 1 W/kg, but binding of H3-dihydroalprenolol to liver-cell membranes of neonates underwent a fivefold decrease under the same field conditions. This effect was not dependent on modulation or on a change in the constant of stimulus-receptor binding but depended on a shedding of the membrane's receptor elements into solution. The magnitude of inhibition correlated with the oxygen concentration in the exposed suspension. Antioxidants (dithiothreitol and ionol) inhibited the shedding of receptor elements. The microwave exposure did not cause an accumulation of products from the peroxidation of lipids (POL). Ascorbate-dependent or non-enzymatic POL was not responsible for the inhibition, and POL was not found in other model systems. However, enzymatic POL mechanisms in localized areas of receptor binding remain a possibility.", 
    "26": "The bioavailability and pharmacodynamic bioequivalence of a conventional and an experimental sustained-release formulation of 100 mg metoprolol tartrate were studied in a randomised cross-over study in seven healthy volunteers by assessing over 24 h the plasma kinetics of R,S-metoprolol, its beta 1-adrenoceptor binding component, and by determining the extent to which the active drug moiety in plasma occupied rabbit lung beta 1- and rat reticulocyte beta 2-adrenoceptors. The formulations differed markedly in their kinetic characteristics: the peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of R,S-metoprolol after administration of the conventional formulation was 140 ng.ml-1, (n = 7) and it was approximately one-third of that after the sustained-release formulation, 49 ng.ml-1, (n = 6); the AUC0-24 h-values for the formulations were 700 and 310 ng.h.ml-1, respectively. The Cmax for the beta 1-adrenoceptor binding component of metoprolol was 180 ng.ml-1 (n = 7) after administration of the conventional, and 74 ng.ml-1 after administration of the sustained-release formulation. The corresponding AUC0-24 h-values for the receptor binding component were 920 and 470 ng.h.ml-1 (n = 7). Thus, the kinetic differences between R,S-metoprolol and the beta 1-receptor binding component were considerable and they were affected by the type of formulation. In general, after administration of the sustained-release formulation, the percentage beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor occupancy of metoprolol in plasma was 5-15% less than after administration of the conventional formulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "27": "Time-Controlled Explosion System (TES) has the time-controlled drug release property with a pre-designed lag time. The drug release from the system is initiated by destruction of the membrane. In this study, metoprolol tartrate was used as a model drug. After five types of TES with different in vitro lag times were orally administrated to dogs, plasma metoprolol concentration was monitored. There existed a good correlation between in vitro and in vivo lag time, while the extent of absorbed metoprolol decreased with prolongation of lag time. Next, the in vivo drug release behavior was directly investigated using five different colored TES with a lag time of two hours. Each TES was consecutively administrated to the fasted dogs at predetermined intervals. The amount of metoprolol released was monitored by recovering the administered TES from the gastrointestinal trace. The in vivo release profile corresponded with the in vitro one. It is demonstrated that TES can release the drug in in vivo conditions similarly to in vitro. Based on these results, the decrease of the absorption is suggested to be caused by increased hepatic first-pass metabolism of the drug due to the retarded release rate with longer lag time.", 
    "28": "A novel controlled drug release system. Time-Controlled Explosion System (TES) has been developed. TES has a four-layered spherical structure, which consists of core, drug, swelling agent and water insoluble polymer membrane. TES is characterized by a rapid drug release with a precisely programmed lag time; i.e. expansion of the swelling agent by water penetrating through the outer membrane, destruction of the membrane by stress due to swelling force and subsequent rapid drug release. For establishing the concept and development strategy, TES was designed using metoprolol and polystyrene balls (size: 3.2 mm in diameter) as a model drug and core particles. Among the polymers screened, low-substituted hydroxypropylcellulose (L-HPC) and ethylcellulose (EC) were selected for a swelling agent and an outer water insoluble membrane, respectively. The release profiles of metoprolol from the system were not affected by the pH of the dissolution media. Lag time was controlled by the thickness of the outer EC membrane; thus, a combination of TES particles possessing different lag times could offer any desired release profile of the model compound, metoprolol.", 
    "29": "The influence of endotoxin-induced inflammation on the enantioselective pharmacokinetics of propranolol, oxprenolol, and verapamil, which bind to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, was studied in the rat. The racemic mixtures were given orally. In the control animals, for propranolol and oxprenolol, the plasma concentrations of the (R)-enantiomer were higher than those of the (S)-enantiomer, while for verapamil the reverse was true. Protein binding and intrinsic clearance are the main factors responsible for this enantioselectivity. After endotoxin treatment, for the three drugs tested the plasma concentrations and the plasma binding of both enantiomers were significantly increased. This effect was more pronounced for (R)-propranolol, (R)-oxprenolol, and (S)-verapamil than for their respective antipodes. The enantioselective effect of endotoxin on the plasma concentrations of the drugs studied seems mainly due to the enantioselective increase in binding to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein.",

We studied how the increase in contractility index (Emax) by the ejecting activation would affect myocardial oxygen consumption (VO2). To this end, left ventricular steady-state ejecting contractions were produced with various stroke volumes from a fixed end-diastolic volume in an excised cross-circulated canine heart. The effect of the ejection-activated Emax on VO2 was assessed by the relation between VO2 and pressure-volume area (PVA). PVA is the total mechanical energy generated by ventricular contraction. In contrast to the elevation of the linear VO2-PVA relation in a parallel manner with an enhanced Emax by ordinary positive inotropic agents such as catecholamines and calcium, the ejection-activated Emax did not elevate the VO2-PVA relation. This result indicates that the ejecting activation enhances Emax in an energetically different manner from ordinary positive inotropism in the canine left ventricle.", 
    "31": "Increased thyroid hormone concentrations have been reported to have disparate effects on insulin sensitivity in man. We describe a 72-year-old lady who initially presented with episodic hypoglycemia secondary to an insulinoma that was controlled by diazoxide. She re-presented 12 months later with a recurrence of the hypoglycemia following the development of thyrotoxicosis. The diazoxide treatment was maintained and propranolol was introduced, which prevented further episodes of hypoglycemia. This appeared to be due to a direct effect of propranolol on endogenous insulin secretion, while whole body insulin sensitivity remained unchanged as assessed using the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique. She was later rendered biochemically euthyroid with a combination of blocking carbimazole therapy and thyroxine replacement, and this was associated with a marked decrease in insulin sensitivity. Thus, the principal effect of thyroid hormone excess in this patient was an increase in insulin sensitivity that led to the clinical relapse of the insulinoma.", 
    "32": "An open randomized study was conducted in mild to moderate hypertensive patients to evaluate, over a 3 months treatment period, the efficacy and tolerability of carvedilol 25 mg OD and to compare, in case of insufficient results with 25 mg, the efficacy and tolerance of carvedilol 50 mg and carvedilol 25 mg coadministered with diuretics. Mean office blood pressure (sitting) of the 91 patients who completed the study according to the protocol was reduced from 161/100 to 147/91 mm Hg after 4 weeks of treatment carvedilol 25 mg OD. Continuation of carvedilol 25 mg produced no further reduction in blood pressure. Increasing carvedilol to 50 mg OD or addition of diuretics further reduced blood pressure. Ambulatory blood pressure measurements showed a significant reduction in both SBP and DBP after 3 months treatment in the three groups, as well as with respect to the circadian profile of blood pressure and heart rate. Large differences between ambulatory and office blood pressure were observed: 37% of the patients diagnosed as mild to moderate hypertensives according to office blood pressure before treatment had mean daytime DBP < 90 mm Hg and 39% mean daytime SBP < 140 mm Hg. Twenty-eight percent of the patients experienced adverse events; they occurred mainly at the beginning of treatment; less than 5% of participants withdrew due to adverse events. The most frequent adverse events were fatigue, vertigo and asthenia. This study showed that carvedilol is safe and effective in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension and that there is a high prevalence (nearly 40%) of low ambulatory blood pressure means in a population labelled as mild to moderate hypertensive.", 
    "33": "A 27 year-old deeply unconscious male patient with shallow spontaneous respiration was admitted to hospital following an epileptoid convulsion with a tentative diagnosis of cerebral trauma. On admission he was noted to have hyperpyrexia, tachycardia and hypertension. The clinical and laboratory findings pointed to intoxication. Aspiration of the stomach produced a large amount of coffee grounds, but not tablets or other poison. The plasma caffeine level was 29 micrograms/ml, which is potentially lethal. Therapy was commenced with a beta-blocker, an anticonvulsive drug and an antipyretic, and supportive symptomatic measures were undertaken. After 12 hours the patient was fully conscious, orientated and cooperative. He subsequently admitted having ingested about 500 g ground coffee with the intention of obtained a \"high\" state of drug intoxication, which he had successfully achieved on previous occasions with a smaller amount of coffee and without complications. The clinical picture was consistent with the expected signs of caffeine intoxication whereby the central effects of the substance remain to be clarified. This appears to be the first report of caffeine misused in this manner. In cases of intoxication with convulsions of uncertain aetiology, caffeine poisoning should be considered in the differential diagnosis.", 
    "34": "The authors report a case of unruptured subcapsular haematoma of the liver in a 31-year-old woman, para 2, in the 34th week of pregnancy, complicated by preeclampsia. Clinical signs of preeclampsia were associated with pain in the right hypocondrium and laboratory findings consistent with a true HELLP syndrome. The diagnosis of subcapsular haematoma was confirmed by tomodensimetry. A cesarean section was carried out but a conservative treatment of the hepatic haematoma was decided. Regular X-ray follow-ups showed the regression of the hepatic lesion. This case confirms recent reports that patients with unruptured capsular haematoma should be treated conservatively but should receive careful monitoring.", 
    "35": "The effect of dl-propranolol on the basolateral membrane potential (Vb) of in vitro microperfused S2 proximal straight tubules of the rabbit kidney was examined using conventional microelectrode techniques. In the steady-state condition, the average of 23 measurements of Vb was -44.8 +/- 2.0 mV. Addition of 10(-4) mol/l of dl-propranolol to the basolateral solution rapidly depolarized Vb by 12.1 +/- 1.3 mV in 20 sec (n = 15). The same dose of d-isomer of propranolol, which has no beta-blocking effect, also depolarized Vb to a similar extent. The non-selective beta-blocker nadolol, which possesses no membrane stabilising activity, had no effect on Vb. Depolarization of Vb by dl-propranolol in 20 seconds (propranolol-induced delta Vb) occurred in a dose-dependent manner. In the presence of 1 mmol/l Ba++ in basolateral solution, propranolol-induced delta Vb was strongly inhibited. The stilbene derivative DIDS at 1 mmol/l did not change propranolol-induced delta Vb, whereas the elimination of Cl- from the ambient conditions increased propranolol-induced delta Vb. The minimization of the luminal Na(+)-coupled organic solute transporter by collapsing of the lumen did not inhibit propranolol-induced delta Vb, indicating the lack of effect of propranolol on luminal Na(+)-coupled transporters. Ouabain at 10(-3) mmol/l in the bath did not eliminate propranolol-induced delta Vb, indicating the presence of a target transporter other than Na+/K+ ATPase for propranolol. These results suggest the following; 1) propranolol has a depolarizing effect on Vb in proximal tubule; 2) the effect of propranolol is independent of Cl- transport or Na(+)-coupled transporters in the luminal membrane; 3) propranolol depolarizes Vb by inhibiting the K+ channel in the basolateral membrane of S2 proximal tubule.", 
    "36": "The purpose of this study was to assess whether nasolacrimal occlusion improves the therapeutic index of various antiglaucoma medications. Use of nasolacrimal occlusion resulted in better efficacy and safer usage. Nasolacrimal occlusion used with 2% pilocarpine, 1.5% carbachol, 0.25% timolol maleate, or 1% epinephrine every 12 hours gave the maximal response for these drugs. Applying 0.25% timolol and 1.5% carbachol every 12 hours gave the maximal response for this combination. Nasolacrimal occlusion did not alter the effect of 0.1% dipivefrin, and since the corneal penetration of this prodrug is 17 times that of epinephrine, 0.05% dipivefrin every 12 hours might be an adequate dosage for maximal effect. Our findings suggest that most of the commercially used antiglaucoma agents can achieve the same maximal effect with lower concentrations and less frequent administration (never exceeding every 12 hours). Nasolacrimal occlusion should markedly decrease systemic absorption and side effects following topical treatment.", 
    "37": "The purpose of this study was to describe the pharmacokinetics of and heart rate and blood pressure responses to (S)-atenolol (SATN) and (R)-atenolol (RATN) after oral administration of (S)-atenolol and (R,S)-atenolol (Tenormin) in man. Eight male subjects were given single oral doses of 50 mg of SATN as a single enantiomer formulation (SEF) and 100 mg of Tenormin (TMN) using a randomized, double-blind, 2-period, complete crossover study design. Subjects performed exercise tolerance tests (Bruce Protocol) before and 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 h after drug administration. Plasma samples were obtained 2 min before and 30 min, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, and 24 h after dosing. Urine was collected for the first 48 h after dosing. Plasma and urine samples were analyzed for SATN and RATN by an enantioselective HPLC method. SEF and Tenormin attenuate exercise-induced increases in heart rate and systolic blood pressure. Mean changes in exercise heart rates 4 h after dosing were -38 +/- 3 bpm and -37 +/- 3 bpm for SEF and TMN, respectively, P = 0.792. Mean changes in exercise systolic blood pressure were -42 +/- 12 mm Hg and -55 +/- 14 mm Hg for SEF and TMN, respectively, P = 0.484. Mean area under the plasma level time curve (AUC0-24) and mean Cmax for SATN for SEF were significantly lower than for SATN after TMN.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "38": "The influence of a single oral dose of 30 mg nicardipine on the pharmacokinetics of (R)- and (S)-propranolol, given orally as rac-propranolol 80 mg, was studied in 12 healthy volunteers. The plasma concentrations were higher for the (S)-enantiomer than for the (R)-enantiomer. The Cl(o) and the Cl'intr of (S)-propranolol were significantly lower than the Cl(o) and Cl'intr of (R)-propranolol. The unbound fraction of (R)-propranolol was significantly higher than that of (S)-propranolol. Coadministration of nicardipine significantly increased the AUC and Cmax and significantly decreased the Cl(o) and Cl'intr for unbound drug of (R)- and (S)-propranolol. These changes were more important for (R)- than for (S)-propranolol. The protein binding was not altered by nicardipine. The enantioselective effect of nicardipine on the metabolic clearance of propranolol appears to be due to an interaction at the level of the metabolizing enzymes. The effect on blood pressure of rac-propranolol was little affected when nicardipine was coadministered with rac-propranolol, and its bradycardic effect was reduced.", 
    "39": "Hyperthermia induced by high doses of 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyl-tryptamine (5-MeODMT) was diminished and hypothermia induced by low doses of 5-MeODMT was enhanced by pretreatment with delta sleep-inducing peptide (DSIP). Delta sleep-inducing peptide had an enhancing effect of hypothermia induced by 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT). This action of DSIP was completely inhibited by ICV injection of anti-DSIP. Pindolol prevented the enhancing action of DSIP on both 8-OH-DPAT- and apomorphine-induced hypothermia. It is suggested that the thermoregulatory action of DSIP is primarily exerted by a 5-HT1A mechanism in the rat.", 
    "40": "After studying central hemodynamics in patients with ischemic heart disease who had undergone aortocoronary shunting without postoperative complications and angina pectoris, the authors came to the conclusion on the beneficial effect of small-dose beta-blockers in the above cases if they developed sinus tachycardia. Beta-blockers help reduce oxygen demand of the myocardium and make more effective cardiac performance.", 
    "41": "1. The haemodynamic profile of elgodipine (1-30 micrograms kg-1, i.v.), a new dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, has been compared directly with that of nicardipine (1-30 micrograms kg-1, i.v.) in chloralose-anaesthetized dogs. 2. Nicardipine produced dose-related systemic, pulmonary and coronary vasodilatation accompanied by reflex tachycardia, inotropy and increases in cardiac output and myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2). Elgodipine had similar vasodilator and hypotensive properties to nicardipine but produced less reflex inotropy, little or no reflex tachycardia and did not increase MVO2. 3. Both calcium antagonists were retested in a separate group of anaesthetized dogs pretreated with propranolol (1 mg kg-1, i.v.) and atropine (0.3 mg kg-1, i.v.) to abolish reflex autonomic tone to the heart and thus reveal the direct cardiac effects of each compound. Under these conditions both elgodipine and nicardipine decreased heart rate and cardiac contractility and slowed atrio-ventricular conduction. Elgodipine was approximately ten times more potent than nicardipine as a decelerator agent and slightly more potent in depressing cardiac contractility and increasing PR interval duration. Elgodipine, unlike nicardipine, slightly reduced the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram. Therefore, the potent decelerator effect of elgodipine, which was present throughout the dose-range, appears to be largely responsible for the suppression of reflex tachycardia observed when the baroreflex is functional. 4. Elgodipine is a potent systemic and coronary vasodilator with more marked direct cardiac effects than nicardipine, particularly with respect to slowing of heart rate. The ability of elgodipine to increase coronary blood flow without significant reflex tachycardia or increases in MVO2 suggests that this compound will have a more favourable effect on myocardial oxygen supply/demand balance than nicardipine. The haemodynamic profile of elgodipine may be suitable for the treatment of angina.", 
    "42": "1. We assessed regional haemodynamic responses to the vasodilator, MgSO4, in the absence and presence of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), in conscious chronically instrumented Long Evans rats (n = 9). 2. MgSO4 (loading dose 220 mumol kg-1 min-1 for 7 min, maintenance dose 56 mumol kg-1 min-1 for 7 min), alone, caused slight bradycardia and hypotension accompanied by reductions in renal and mesenteric flows, but a marked hyperaemic vasodilatation in the hindquarters (flow, delta 54 +/- 6%, vascular conductance, delta 77 +/- 5%). 3. L-NAME (183 nmol kg-1 min-1) caused hypertension (29 +/- 2 mmHg) accompanied by bradycardia (-51 +/- 6 beats min-1) and reductions in flow and vascular conductance in the renal (-18 +/- 4% and -35 +/- 3%, respectively), mesenteric (-35 +/- 3% and -49 +/- 3%, respectively), and hindquarters (-26 +/- 3% and -42 +/- 3%, respectively) vascular beds. In the presence of L-NAME, the hypotensive and bradycardic effects of MgSO4 were still apparent, but its hindquarters hyperaemic vasodilator effect was significantly attenuated. 4. In order to determine if the inhibitory action of L-NAME on the hindquarters hyperaemic vasodilator action of MgSO4 was a non-specific effect, due to the change in baseline conditions caused by L-NAME, we also examined responses to MgSO4 in the presence of endothelin-1 (12.5 pmol kg-1 min-1) or angiotensin II (50 pmol kg-1 min-1). In the presence of either peptide, the overall effects of MgSO4 on hindquarters flow and vascular conductance were unchanged. 5. In a separate experiment (n = 8) we determined that the inhibitory effect of L-NAME on the hyperaemic vasodilator response to MgSO4 was prevented by L-arginine, and also demonstrated that the Beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist, ICI 118551, caused significant inhibition of the hindquarters haemodynamic effects of MgSO4.6. We conclude that the hindquarters haemodynamic effects of MgSO4 in conscious rats involve a substantial L-NAME-sensitive component which depends on activation of Beta2-adrenoceptors, probably asa consequence of adrenal medullary adrenaline release.", 
    "43": "Hepatocytes from partially hepatectomized rat livers show enhanced glucagon-sensitive adenylate cyclase activity. Bmax and Kd values of glucagon receptors (GR), measured by [125I]glucagon binding to liver plasma membranes, remained unchanged following partial hepatectomy. The amount of stimulatory G proteins (Gs), quantified by cholera toxin catalyzed ADP-ribosylation, increased in parallel with an increment in glucagon-responsive adenylate cyclase activity. It is proposed that an increment of Gs is one of the factors responsible for enhancement of glucagon-sensitive adenylate cyclase activity following partial hepatectomy.", 
    "44": "Factors controlling hypoxia-induced myocardial glycerol release were studied in isolated, perfused rat hearts. A constant coronary flow rate 10 ml g-1 min-1 was maintained. The perfusion buffer was gassed with O2-N2 mixtures containing 5% CO2. The O2:N2 ratios were normoxia 95:0, hypoxia 30:65, and severe hypoxia 10:85 (v/v). Glycerol and lactate release were stimulated during a 30-min period of either hypoxia or severe hypoxia but remained constant during normoxia. Tissue glycerol-3-phosphate levels were increased after 30 min hypoxia compared with after a similar period of normoxic perfusion (p < 0.01) and further increased after severe hypoxia (p < 0.01 vs hypoxia). beta-Adrenoceptors remained sensitive to isoprenaline during hypoxia, demonstrated by an increase in glycerol release over a 30-min period of isoprenaline infusion from 897 +/- 317 to 1771 +/- 307 nmol g-1 wet weight (p < 0.05). The isoprenaline-induced increase in glycerol release during hypoxia was inhibited by both atenolol and timolol (1 x 10(-5) M). In contrast, beta-adrenoceptor blockade using these drugs failed to reduce glycerol release induced by either hypoxia or severe hypoxia. Both drugs attenuated the rise in glycerol-3-phosphate during hypoxia. Chronic denervation by pretreatment with 6-hydroxydopamine reduced hypoxia-stimulated glycerol release by only 30%. Thus, a major part of hypoxia-induced glycerol release is mediated by non-adrenergic mechanisms. The results of this study bring into question the validity of the use of glycerol production during hypoxia as a reliable measure of myocardial lipolysis.", 
    "45": "The extent of impairment of respiratory function in a group of 52 elderly, glaucomatous patients receiving topical timolol therapy was investigated. To predict those patients who were likely to benefit from changing therapy, symptoms were elicited by direct questioning, and lung spirometry was measured before and after inhalation of salbutamol. Changing from timolol to either pilocarpine or the cardioselective betaxolol produced improvement in lung function tests. Mean peak flow increased from 278 l/min to 328 l/min (p < 0.001), forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1) from 1.66 l to 1.85 l (p < 0.001) and forced vital capacity (FVC) from 2.41 to 2.64 l (p < 0.001). Spirometry in a control group of 20 subjects was unchanged. Nineteen of 47 patients demonstrated a clinically significant (defined as 15% or more) increase in all values of lung function tests. Change to pilocarpine or betaxolol was equally effective in producing improvement but betaxolol had fewer side-effects. The presence of exertional dyspnoea, cough with sputum, raised dyspnoea score and improved lung function tests after salbutamol identified those patients experiencing clinically significant bronchospasm with an 89% specificity and 74% sensitivity.", 
    "46": "The components of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP), P7, N9, P12, and N15, were recorded from dura mater before and after intracerebroventricular injection (icv) of monoamines. The peak latencies of P12 and N15 were prolonged and the amplitudes of P12 and N15 were decreased following icv norepinephrine (NE) 1 microgram.microliter-1 and serotonin (5-HT) 1 microgram.microliter-1. Generally, P12 and N15 restored to normal 1-2 h after icv NE and 5-HT. Dopamine (DA) 1 microgram.microliter-1, however, did not show any significant effect on SEP. Tolazoline (Tol) 2.5 micrograms.microliters-1 markedly potentiated the inhibitory effect of NE, but propranolol (Pro) 1 microgram.microliter-1 weakened the effect of NE on SEP. These results indicated that icv NE and 5-HT exerted an inhibitory effect on the somatosensory afferent function from thalamus to cortex and/or intercortical areas and alpha-adrenoceptor had an influence on the inhibitory effect of NE.", 
    "47": "Glucagon has been reported to be one of the most effective treatments for severe beta-blocker poisoning. Recently, amrinone was suggested as an alternative therapeutic choice for beta-blocker poisoning. Milrinone, a derivative of amrinone, acts independently of beta-adrenoceptors and increases cyclic AMP. Therefore milrinone may also be effective in the treatment of beta-blocker poisoning. In the present study, we compared the effect of glucagon and milrinone in treating severe beta-blocker poisoning. Following the administration of 10 mg/kg propranolol i.v. over 10 min, heart rate, cardiac output, mean arterial pressure, stroke volume, and end tidal CO2 were depressed, while central venous pressure, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure increased significantly (p < 0.05). Following the administration of saline (Group S, N = 3), glucagon 20 micrograms/kg (Group G, N = 5), and milrinone 300 micrograms/kg (Group M, N = 5), hemodynamic parameters were observed for 30 min. In group M, mean arterial pressure, cardiac output and stroke volume recovered to their baseline values, while central venous pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased. Although there were no significant differences between groups G and M, the heart rate, central venous pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, mean arterial pressure and stroke volume did not return to baseline values in group G. Milrinone administration produced a significant hemodynamic improvement without increasing the heart rate in the canine model of severe heart failure caused by propranolol. In the glucagon treatment group, central venous pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure improved less than the milrinone group. Although more data are needed before a clinical recommendation, milrinone might be an effective drug to treat beta-blocker poisoning.", 
    "48": "The central effects of atenolol (50 mg tds) and captopril (50 mg tds) ingested for a period of seven days were studied in ten healthy volunteers. A placebo and two active control drugs, methyldopa (250 mg tds) and oxazepam (10 mg), were included in the design. Oxazepam was ingested on the seventh day only, with a placebo being taken on the preceding six days. On the seventh day, central effects of the drugs were tested at 10.00-11.00 h (session 1), immediately before the subjects' last dose of each drug and at 2.5-3.5 h after the final dose of each drug (1330-1430 h, session 2). Performance was assessed using digit symbol substitution, continuous attention, letter cancellation, choice reaction time, finger tapping, immediate and short-term memory, critical flicker fusion and two flash fusion. Subjects assessed their mood and well-being on a series of 12 visual analogue scales. Recordings of the EEG and body sway were carried out. Neither atenolol nor captopril altered performance at any of the skills tested. There were no effects on subjectively assessed alertness or mood with captopril, while atenolol significantly increased wakefulness in session 2 and when the two sessions were meaned. Similarly, captopril did not modify body sway, while with atenolol there was a significant decrease in activity in the frequency range 1.0-2.75 Hz from session 1 to session 2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "49": "Diaspirin crosslinked hemoglobin (DCLHb) administration elevates mean arterial pressure (MAP). The purpose of this study was to determine whether commonly used antihypertensive agents could control this pressor effect in rats. Awake rats were injected intravenously (i.v.) with 280 mg/kg of DCLHb. Fifteen minutes later when MAP was 25-30% above baseline and heart rate (HR) was reciprocally decreased, prazosin (2 mg/kg;an alpha adrenergic blocker), nitroglycerine (NTG; 10-150 mcg/min; a nitrovasodilator), nicardipine (0.204-0.08 mg/hr; a calcium channel blocker) or labetalol (5 mg/kg; an alpha/beta adrenergic blocker) was administered i.v. All four classes of antihypertensive agents promptly restored MAP to baseline. Coincident with the return of MAP to baseline, HR was restored to baseline in prazosin and NTG treated animals, however, bradycardia persisted in those animals treated with nicardipine and labetalol, most likely due to the negative chronotropic properties of these agents. We conclude that the pressor effect of DCLHb can be readily controlled with at least four different classes of commonly used antihypertensive agents.", 
    "50": "In urethane-anesthetized rats, sodium L-glutamate (Glu) microinjection into the anteroventral third ventricle region (AV3V) induced a depressor response, but the heart rate remained unchanged, whereas Glu injection into its surrounding areas or normal saline injection into the AV3V had no effect on the arterial pressure and heart rate. Bilateral preinjection of procaine or atriopeptin III antiserum into the nucleus paraventricularis (NPV) and methyl atropine (IV) markedly attenuated the AV3V depressor response, but the hypotensive response was not significantly affected by phentolamine or propranolol (IV), indicating that atriopeptin in the NPV mediates the AV3V depressor response, and excitation of the cardiac vagus is also involved in this response.", 
    "51": "Diltiazem CR tablets 120 mg b.i.d. for 1 week were compared with plain tablets 60 mg q.i.d. in 13 healthy male volunteers in a study of pharmacokinetic variables. Their antianginal efficacy was also compared in 23 patients with stable angina pectoris who were already on metoprolol. Both studies were of randomised, cross over design, and the clinical study was double blind. The pharmacokinetic variables of the two formulations were very similar except for the longer tmax of 4.4 h for diltiazem CR in comparison to 2.9 h for the plain tablets. The mean relative bioavailability of diltiazem CR in comparison with plain tablets was 1.14. The clinical study showed that after four weeks on diltiazem CR 120 mg b.i.d. or diltiazem plain tablets 60 mg q.i.d. in addition to metoprolol, there were significant decreases in weekly anginal attacks from 11 to 5 attacks/week, the number of nitroglycerin tablets consumed from 6 to 3 tablets/week, and an increase in the maximum workload from 116 to 126 and 123 W for diltiazem CR and plain diltiazem tablets, respectively, as compared to placebo. Five of the patients were angina free during diltiazem treatment. No difference in anti-anginal efficacy between the two preparations was seen. It was concluded that CR 120 mg b.i.d. appears bioequivalent to plain diltiazem tablets 60 mg q.i.d.", 
    "52": "The effects of single oral doses of dilevalol 400 mg and propranolol 80 mg on systemic and regional haemodynamics at rest and after sub-maximal exercise, were compared, in a placebo-controlled, randomised, double-blind, crossover study in 6 healthy male volunteers. At rest, as compared to placebo, neither dilevalol nor propranolol significantly affected arterial pressure and heart rate but, whereas propranolol decreased cardiac output (-27% at 2 h) and tended to increase total peripheral resistance, dilevalol tended to increase cardiac output and decreased total peripheral resistance (-7% at 2 h). Neither dilevalol nor propranolol affected brachial artery diameter. Propranolol tended to decrease brachial artery flow (-20% at 2 h) and to increase brachial vascular resistance (+25% at 2 h), but dilevalol did not and the brachial irrigation ratios did not change. Neither of the drugs affected carotid haemodynamics or plasma atrial natriuretic factor. Both drugs tended to decrease plasma renin activity, and dilevalol (+82% at 2 h) increased norepinephrine more than propranolol (+19% at 2 h). After exercise, dilevalol and propranolol produced similar falls in the induced increases in arterial pressure, heart rate and cardiac output, and had the same effects on regional haemodynamics, plasma renin activity and atrial natriuretic factor. Finally, dilevalol greatly increased plasma norepinephrine. We conclude that the beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist activity of dilevalol was clearly expressed at rest, thus inducing vasodilation and counteracting the beta-adrenoceptor blockade-induced negative chronotropic and inotropic effects. However, during sub-maximal exercise, only the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist activity of dilevalol was apparent.", 
    "53": "The effect of a single dose of nifedipine or propranolol hydrochloride on gastric acid production and motility has been assessed in 90 duodenal ulcer (DU) patients having the relapse. Intragastric pH-metry showed that the drugs in a dose 20 mg significantly inhibit basal acid production. As indicated by electrogastromyography, nifedipine effect on gastric motility depends on its baseline level. The drug displays a moderate normalizing action (modulating effect) on the dominating frequency, amplitude of motor oscillations and overall capacity of gastric biopotentials. Propranolol hydrochloride noticeably lowered initially high frequency of gastric contractions. Due to nifedipine gastric evacuation inhibits and makes more regular. The authors recommend introduction of nifedipine and propranolol hydrochloride in correction of gastric dysfunction in DU patients.", 
    "54": "Chronic exposure (8 weeks) to sequential application of mild stressors caused the increase in the density (Bmax) of beta-adrenergic and 5-HT2 receptors in the rat cerebral cortex. MK-801 given chronically (5 weeks) decreased beta-adrenergic receptors density in both control and stressed rats, whereas it decreased the density of 5-HT2 receptors in control rats only. On the other hand, imipramine administered for 5 weeks reduced the number of beta-adrenergic and 5-HT2 receptors in both control and stressed rats.", 
    "55": "We conducted a double-blind randomized prospective study to evaluate the efficacy of topical timolol alone and topical timolol and atropine combined in cases of operated failed retinal detachment surgery cases in which no apparent open break explained the surgical failure. In both groups with and without proliferative vitreoretinopathy no statistically significant difference in retinal reattachment was found.", 
    "56": "A novel tetrahydroisoquinoline, 1-alpha-naphthylmethyl-6,7-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4- tetrahydroisoquinoline (YS 49) 1) increased heart rate and force in isolated rat atria; 2) relaxed PE- and KCl-contracted rat aorta, and 3) decreased blood pressure and increased heart rate in anesthetized rabbit. These effects were blocked by propranolol, a nonselective beta-antagonist, but not by phentolamine, an alpha-blocker, and/or depletion of catecholamine by reserpine. These results suggest that the mechanism of action of YS 49 is due, at least in part, to beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation.",

Prior to these 16 weeks there was a placebo wash-out period of 2-6 weeks. Blood pressure measurements, euglycaemic, hyperinsulinaemic glucose clamps, and intravenous glucose tolerance tests (IVGTT) were performed at baseline and after 4 and 16 weeks. Blood lipid status was evaluated at baseline and 16 weeks. The insulin sensitivity index (M/I) increased by 12% during the prolonged placebo period, and subsequently decreased by 12% during treatment with atenolol in that group. A post-hoc analysis of covariance indicated that the increase in insulin sensitivity during the initial 4 weeks may have been due to carry-over effects from previous antihypertensive treatment. Fosinopril increased glucose disappearance during IVGTT at 4 and 16 weeks (k values 1.46 and 1.33 vs 1.10 at baseline) but had no effect on insulin sensitivity. The change in insulin sensitivity and serum triglycerides during treatment with fosinopril was related to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in serum. In conclusion, carry-over effects from previous antihypertensive medication were indicated in this study, probably because of an insufficient wash-out period in many patients. Therefore, 4 weeks of placebo wash-out in all patients is advisable in this kind of investigation.", 
    "58": "The effects of esmolol at different rates of infusion (100, 250 and 500 micrograms.kg-1 BW.min-1) were compared with beta-adrenoceptor occupancy (beta 1 and beta 2, estimated by a subtype selective radioreceptor assay) and plasma concentrations of esmolol and its acid metabolite were measured by HPLC. Up to a rate of infusion of esmolol of 500 micrograms.kg-1 BW.min-1 there was a maximal beta 1-receptor occupancy of 84.7% while beta 2-receptor occupancy was below the detection limit; confirming the beta 1 selectivity of esmolol. Exercise-induced increases in heart rate and systolic blood pressure were reduced by esmolol in a dose-dependent manner. The estimated EC50 values of rate of infusion for the reduction in heart rate and systolic blood pressure during exercise were 113 and 134 micrograms.kg-1 BW.min-1, respectively. Additionally, heart rate and systolic blood pressure were reduced moderately at rest. Because of the short elimination half-life of esmolol caused by the rapid hydrolysis to its acid metabolite, 45 min after end of infusion high plasma concentrations of the metabolite (maximally 80 micrograms.ml-1) but no esmolol were detectable. Since no in vivo effects have been observed, despite the presence of high plasma concentrations of the metabolite, the metabolite did not participate in the observed effects up to an infusion rate of esmolol of 500 micrograms.kg-1 BW.min-1. The plasma concentrations of antagonist detected by radioreceptor assay and plasma concentrations of esmolol detected by HPLC showed a good correlation (r = 0.97).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "59": "In drug utilisation studies, the units of defined daily doses (DDD) and DDD/1000 inhabitants per day standardise for differences in dosage and population size, but not for age-related differences in drug utilisation. There is no consensus as to how age standardisation of DDD data should be carried out. Using cardiovascular drug utilisation data from Sweden and Spain, the current study compared the outcome of different methods of age standardisation. Both indirect methods (based on a comparison of observed and expected drug usage) and direct methods (using different weighting for the age categories) were used. The largest impact of standardisation was seen for diuretics. The crude rate for men and women combined was 26 DDD/1000 inhabitants per day in Costa de Ponent and 98 DDD/1000 inhabitants per day in V\u00e4rmland. The corresponding figures when standardising the Costa de Ponent population were 26 and 58, respectively. Using the equivalent average rate (EAR) method, the rate for V\u00e4rmland was 129 DDD/1000 inhabitants per day. Lesser but still important differences were found for beta-adrenoceptor and antihypertensives. Thus, the results of standardisation differ depending on which method is used and which drugs are evaluated. EAR is recommended for direct standardisation because of its ease of use and because it does not require the choice of a standard population.", 
    "60": "Indicators of cardiovascular strain were studied in 12 healthy young men under the influence of drugs affecting the autonomic nervous system during the course of taking a sauna bath. There were four bath sessions: one without a drug (control) and three with drug pretreatment (Atenolol 50 mg or Scopolamine 0.3 mg or their combination taken orally 2 h before the bath). The time spent in the hot room depended on the subjective rating of heat stress. Its mean duration at a temperature of 88 degrees C (dry bulb) was 22 (range 14-33) min and did not differ significantly among the sessions. In the Atenolol experiment the mean resting heart rate before the bath was significantly lower (P < 0.001, ANOVA of repeated measures) than in the other experiments. The increase in heart rate per minute of heat exposure was significantly lower (P < 0.001) in the Atenolol experiment and higher (P = 0.017) in the Scopolamine experiment than in the other experiments. The systolic blood pressure increased more slowly (P = 0.004) and the diastolic pressure decreased less (P = 0.02) in the Atenolol experiment than in the other experiments. Heart rate and blood pressure returned to their initial levels during the 30-min recovery after the heat exposure. The plasma noradrenaline concentrations increased approximately twofold during all of the bath sessions, whereas the plasma adrenaline and serum thromboxane B2 concentrations showed no consistent alterations. A small oral dose of Scopolamine alone or in combination with Atenolol produced no marked cardiovascular strain in healthy men during a sauna bath.", 
    "61": "It has been suggested that long-term beta blockade treatment in congestive heart failure might be less effective in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy as compared with patients having idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. This study was performed to evaluate the effect of long-term adrenergic beta blockade treatment on regional myocardial function in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. The regional wall motion (RWM) was evaluated in 12 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy before and after long-term open treatment with metoprolol. On average, the patients were treated over 11 months (range 6-36 months). The regional left ventricular function was assessed using two-dimensional echocardiographic recordings by two independent blinded observers. The RWM score was evaluated in 16 segments of the left ventricle on a scale from 0 (hypercontractility) to 5 (dyskinesia). Following treatment, there was an improvement in general ventricular function (ejection fraction 0.24-0.31; p = 0.01) as well as in RWM (86 improved segments, 48 deteriorated, 49 unchanged; p < 0.002). Ventricular segments with poor contractility (RWM score > or = 3.5) tended to improve (53 improved segments, 16 deteriorated, 13 unchanged; p < 0.0001), whereas less severely impaired segments (RWM score < 3.5) did not improve (33 improved segments, 32 deteriorated, 36 unchanged; NS). It is suggested that poorly contracting myocardial segments might improve following beta blockade treatment, while an effect on less impaired segments might be lacking. An improvement in overall myocardial function would then be harder to detect.", 
    "62": "Some poly(ethyleneglycol) derivatives of propranolol were prepared, in which the drug molecule was linked to the oligomeric carrier via urethane bonds in order to study the suitability of this bond as a linkage between the carrier and the drug moiety in oligomeric prodrugs. For comparison purposes also ethanol- and butanol-based prodrugs of propranolol were prepared, with the same linkage between drug and promoiety. The urethane compounds were obtained by condensation via N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole. None of these compounds gave rise to appreciable blood concentrations of propranolol after oral administration, thus suggesting in this particular case, a relative in vivo resistance of urethane bonds towards cleavage.", 
    "63": "Experimental evidence for antiatheromatous of effects of calcium antagonists has been impressive. Clinical experience has, in contrast, been more difficult to obtain. Primary prevention with calcium antagonists has not been studied due to obvious difficulties. Secondary prevention, however, has been investigated: Several studies have addressed influence of calcium antagonists upon atheromatous arterial wall changes as demonstrated by quantitative coronary angiocardiography. A review of these studies reveals considerable methodological problems. For nifedipine it could be demonstrated, however, that the occurrence of \"new lesions\" can be retarded to a certain extent (3-6). Nicardipine has been studied, but the preventive effect reported cannot be considered valid, because distribution of risk factors to the study groups was not statistically homogeneous. Another approach has been the application of calcium antagonists to patients with acute myocardial infarction. Here, vascular and myocardial effects come into play. In non-Q-wave, i.e. not transmural infarction, the calcium antagonist diltiazem definitely has preventive effects as regards re-infarction (2). The large multicenter post-myocardial infarction trial MDPIT showed an improvement of cardiac envent rate and re-infarction. This effect was seen only if pulmonary congestion was not present. Calcium antagonists have negative effects if cardiac failure is present. Verapamil was shown to have beneficial effects in acute myocardial infarction in the large DAVIT trials. Here again, the effect was only seen if heart failure was not present. Otherwise negative results were recorded. Nifedipine demonstrated only borderline myocardial protective effects in acute myocardial infarction (7). We conclude that calcium antagonists have vascular and myocardial protective effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "64": "The beta-adrenoceptor subtypes which trigger lipolysis in white adipocytes vary markedly between calf and rats, and even between different rat strains. In calf adipocytes, CGP12177, a potent antagonist for beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors (i.e., \"classical beta-adrenoceptors\") and a partial agonist for atypical beta-adrenoceptors, did not stimulate lipolysis, but inhibited with high affinity (IC50 = 0.66 nM) the lipolytic response to 10 nM isoproterenol. In adipocytes from both Wistar rats and Sprague-Dawley OFA rats, CGP12177 stimulated lipolysis to almost the same extent as isoproterenol. Low concentrations of CGP12177 (3 nM) inhibited part of the lipolytic response to 10 nM isoproterenol in the Sprague-Dawley OFA rat adipocytes, but not in Wistar rats at all ages tested (2-4 weeks, 2-4 months, 24-26 months). Hence, functional beta-adrenoceptors are only classical in calf adipocytes, only atypical in Wistar rat adipocytes and both classical and atypical in Sprague-Dawley OFA rat adipocytes. Binding experiments were performed with 150 pM [125I]CYP. On calf adipocyte membranes, competition binding curves with CGP12177 displayed one high affinity binding site (IC50 = 4.7 nM), whereas the curves for CGP20712 (beta 1-selective antagonist) and ICI118551 (beta 2-selective antagonist) were biphasic. In agreement with the functional data, these results indicate that only beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors are present in calf adipose tissue. For both rat strains, only half of the displaceable [125I]CYP binding sites displayed high affinity for CGP12177 (IC50 = 6.8 to 7.5 nM), and competition binding studies with CGP20712 and ICI118551 indicated that they represent beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors. The remaining [125I]CYP binding sites possessed an about 50 times lower affinity for CGP12177 (IC50 = 260 to 345 nM). They are likely to represent atypical beta-adrenoceptors. It is concluded that the presence and the physiological relevance of beta-adrenoceptor subtypes in adipose tissue may not only be species-related, but also strain-related.", 
    "65": "This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms involved in the contractile effects produced by the novel quinoline derivative, 2-(2-aminoethyl)-quinoline (D-1997), in the canine isolated basilar artery. For comparison, the effects of D-1997 were also evaluated on rat aorta. Canine basilar artery and rat aortic rings were prepared and mounted in organ baths to record isometric tension changes. The contractile effects of D-1997 in the basilar artery were compared with those produced by 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and the 5-HT receptor agonist quipazine. Thus, 4-HT (10(-10)-10(-6)M), D-1997 (3.1 x 10(-8)-10(-4) M) and quipazine (3.1 x 10(-7)-10(-4) M) each caused concentration-dependent contractions of the canine basilar artery with a rank order of agonist potency of 5-HT > D-1997 > quipazine. 5-HT and D-1997 exhibited similar maximum effects which were higher than that of quipazine. Similar concentrations of D-1997 failed to produce contraction in rat aorta. The effects of D-1997 in the basilar artery were not modified by incubation with either the 5-HT2 receptor antagonist ketanserin (0.01-1 microM), the 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 receptor antagonist ICS205930 (tropisetron; 0.1-10 microM), the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist spiroxatrine (0.01-1 microM), the beta-adrenoceptor blocker with high affinity for 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B binding sites (+/-)-pindolol (0.01-1 microM), or the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (0.01-1 microM). In contrast, the D-1997-induced responses were potently and concentration-dependently antagonized by the mixed 5-HT1-like and 5-HT2 receptor antagonist methiothepin (0.01-1 microM). It is concluded that D-1997 contracts the canine basilar artery by stimulating 5-HT1-like receptors unrelated to either the 5-HT1A or 5-HT1B receptor subtypes. The compound seems to be devoid of 5-HT2 receptor agonist properties in rat aorta.", 
    "66": "The effects of bopindolol (a new, nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist) and its active metabolite, 18-502, on the regional myocardial pH during coronary occlusion were studied. Mongrel dogs were anesthetized with pentobarbital and the thorax was opened to expose the heart. The left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) was incompletely (or partially) occluded so that the LAD flow could be reduced to about one third of the original flow. Regional myocardial pH of the LAD area was continuously measured by a tissue pH monitor. Drugs were injected intravenously 30 minutes after LAD partial occlusion. The myocardial pH in the LAD area decreased in response to LAD partial occlusion (from 7.3-7.4 to 6.72-6.92), and the low pH value was sustained for 60 minutes after LAD occlusion. Atenolol (1 mg/kg) decreased heart rate markedly and attenuated the regional myocardial acidosis induced by LAD partial occlusion. Bopindolol (1 mg/kg) decreased heart rate and 18-502 (0.5 mg/kg) decreased heart rate and blood pressure. Both drugs attenuated to a similar degree the decrease of regional myocardial pH induced by LAD occlusion. In the dog whose heart rate was maintained constant, however, bopindolol (1 mg/kg) did not attenuate the decrease of regional myocardial pH induced by LAD occlusion. These results suggest that both bopindolol and 18-502 attenuate the ischemia-induced regional acidosis of the myocardium as does atenolol, and, hence, have an anti-ischemic action. The beneficial action of bopindolol on ischemia-induced myocardial acidosis is possibly due to a decrease of heart rate, which corresponds to a saving of energy in the myocardial cells.", 
    "67": "A comparative evaluation of beta-blockers and calcium antagonists as protective agents against ventricular fibrillation related to myocardial ischaemia, was attempted in the pig heart in situ of anaesthetized, open-chest animals, subjected to a temporary complete occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery near its origin. This occlusion resulted in fibrillation occurring after a time depending on the vulnerability to the fibrillatory process. As this time to onset of fibrillation does normally not exceed a few minutes, its determination could be achieved repeatedly in the course of an experiment, in the absence and presence of drugs such as beta-blockers and calcium antagonists. When propranolol (0.05 mg/kg, i.v.) and verapamil (0.05 mg/kg, i.v.) abolished tachycardia produced by isoproterenol (0.25 micrograms/kg/min), the triggering of fibrillation was delayed in either case: in animals under atrial pacing at a rate close to the sinus rate on each determination, time to fibrillation was prolonged from about 160 to 400 sec by propranolol and from 160 to 640 sec by verapamil, with a return to control values within 60 min. Under ventricular pacing at a constant high rate (180 beats/min), no change was observed in time to fibrillation after propranolol (0.025 or 0.050 mg/kg), whereas verapamil, in the same conditions and in the same doses, multiplied this time by about 4 and 6, respectively. Consequently, propranolol and verapamil are likely to protect against fibrillation immediately after i.v. injection, but the protection due to propranolol is only indirect and a consequence of bradycardia which tends to increase the polarization of the muscular fibres, whereas verapamil adds to the same influence a direct preventive action by avoiding a cellular calcium overload in these fibres, which is responsible for the depolarization and fluctuations of their membrane potential.", 
    "68": "The role of central adrenergic innervation of the brain capillaries is still a matter of discussion. The hypothesis that these nerves control the blood-brain barrier permeability was tested by electrically stimulating the locus coeruleus, the major central adrenergic nucleus, in the anaesthetized rat. Frequencies of 5, 15, and 30 Hz were used. A frequency dependent increase in blood-brain barrier permeability to sodium fluorescein was verified. Prior administration of the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phenoxybenzamine (10 mg/kg i.p., 24 h before electrical stimulation) totally blocked the effect of 15 Hz stimulation. The same dose of pindolol (a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist) given 1 h before electrical stimulation potentiated the effect of 5 Hz stimulation. Thus, blood-brain barrier permeability is increased, in a frequency dependent manner, by electrical stimulation of the locus coeruleus. The results obtained with phenoxybenzamine and pindolol suggest an opposite effect of alpha and beta-adrenoceptors on the control of sodium fluorescein transport through the blood-brain barrier.", 
    "69": "The effects of atenolol and nifedipine on gas exchange were studied in 27 patients with effort angina in a randomized cross-over trial. Semi-supine bicycle exercise tests (ramp program, 20 W/min) with measurement of gas exchange were carried out after consecutive 2-week treatment periods with atenolol (50 mg b.i.d.) and slow-release nifedipine (20 mg b.i.d.). In the range of subthreshold exercise, the slope of the VO2 workload line was lower with atenolol than with nifedipine (8.64 +/- 1.59 vs 10.28 +/- 1.74 ml.min-1.W-1, p < 0.005) as determined by linear regression analysis excluding the initial 30 W. The intercept of the curve on the VO2 axis was higher with atenolol than with nifedipine (366 +/- 111 vs 299 +/- 113 ml.min-1, p < 0.05). VO2 was higher (p < 0.05) with nifedipine than with atenolol for workloads above 65 W. A similar pattern was seen if the drug effects on the slope of the VCO2-workload relation were analyzed (7.11 +/- 1.92 vs 8.54 +/- 1.85 ml.min-1.W-1, p < 0.02). The intercept on the VCO2 axis was not different among the treatments. VCO2 was higher (p < 0.05) with nifedipine than with atenolol for workloads above 55 W. Minute ventilation was higher (p < 0.05) with nifedipine than with atenolol at all points of the analysis. The data suggest that the ventilatory requirements and the energy cost for aerobic exercise are higher with nifedipine than with atenolol. This may become relevant in cardiovascular patients with concomitant pulmonary disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "70": "The substrates in the phenylalanine, metabolism play key roles in the physiological processes of bacteria. Promethazine affects the phenylalanine metabolism in Escherichia coli. The antibacterial and anti-plasmid actions of promethazine were prevented by phenylalanine, tyrosine, phenylpyruvic acid, phenylacetic acid, noradrenaline and dopamine in minimal medium. Isoproterenol (and phenoxybenzamine) reduced, while propranolol, oxyprenolol and alprenolol isomers enhanced the anti-plasmid effect of promethazine. Propranolol itself induced an anti-plasmid effect. The effects of beta-receptor agonists and antagonists on promethazine-induced anti-plasmid action serve as an indirect evidence of beta adrenergic like binding sites in E. coli. These binding sites are involved in the plasmid replication process and are connected with promethazine binding sites in bacteria.", 
    "71": "The method of cellular immobilization and perfusion was applied to adipocytes. The lipolytic effect of isoprenaline, whose action is produced as a result of receptor-drug interaction, was followed. An agarose solution kept at at 37 degrees C was mixed 1:1 with the cell suspension. Thereafter, adipocytes were immobilized in the agarose threads. The lipolytic effect of 0.1 ml of isoprenaline (1 x 10(-4) mol/l), that was rapidly introduced to the cell perfusion inlet in a non-recirculating system, was monitored by assessing glycerol production. The immobilized and perfused adipocytes exhibited significant lipolytic activity. After reaching the maximum effect, 0.1 ml of propranolol (1 x 10(-3) mol/l) that was applied to the bioreactor inlet, abolished the isoprenaline effect. The present data demonstrate the potential applicability of immobilized perfused adipocytes for various kinds of studies.", 
    "72": "Beta-adrenoceptor blockers are widely used drugs for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Since beta-blockers cross the placenta, it is essential to consider possible adverse effects on the embryo. Six beta-adrenoceptor blockers were tested at various concentrations (10-5000 microM) in a rat whole embryo culture. Although inducing a very similar pattern of dysmorphogenetic effects (incomplete flexure, disturbed development of the neural tube, the head, the heart and the tail bud), the compounds exhibited a wide range of embryotoxic potency. Estimation of the EC50 (median-concentration producing dysmorphogenesis in 50% of the embryos) for the six compounds revealed differences of more than two orders of magnitude: propranolol 25 microM, alprenolol 30 microM, metoprolol 100 microM, pindolol 150 microM, acebutolol 500 microM, atenolol 4000 microM. Measurements of the concentrations of the various drugs in the cultured embryos at corresponding EC50 levels showed differing values: metoprolol 4.5 microM, propranolol 5.2 microM, alprenolol 8.4 microM, pindolol 9.0 microM, acebutolol 12.5 microM and atenolol 77.0 microM. With regard to the EC50 and the degree of substance transfer to the embryo it can be stated that propranolol and metoprolol show a much higher intrinsic potency to interfere with normal in vitro embryonic development than, e.g. atenolol.", 
    "73": "Coronary artery preparations from cattle hearts responded with stable contractions to the thromboxane A2 analogue, U 46619. These contractions were progressively reduced by increasing concentrations of the prototypical potassium channel opener pinacidil (3.8 x 10(-8) to 1.1 x 10(-4) M). Pinacidil-induced relaxations were antagonized significantly by d,l-propranolol (1.2 x 10(-6) to 1.2 x 10(-5) M). Forskolin-induced relaxations of coronary preparations were also antagonized by d,l-propranolol, but those to nitroprusside were not. d-Propranolol also antagonized relaxations to pinacidil but only when used in higher concentrations than the I-isomer. Nadolol and metoprolol, two other beta receptor antagonists with differing profiles of action, also antagonized to some extent the vasodilator action of pinacidil. The known potassium channel antagonist, glibenclamide, shifted the concentration-relaxation curve for pinacidil to the right, but d,l-propranolol produced an additional antagonistic effect in the presence of glibenclamide. Relaxations of contracted tracheal ring preparations of guinea pig by pinacidil, however, were not antagonized by d,l-propranolol, suggesting specificity for vascular tissue. Isoproterenol increased significantly the cyclic AMP levels in coronary tissue, but pinacidil had no such effect, ruling out an adrenergic component to pinacidil action. Pinacidil increased the efflux of 86Rb in isolated coronary preparations, and this effect was blunted by propranolol. It is concluded that beta receptor antagonists inhibit relaxations to a potassium channel opener by a mechanism independent of beta adrenergic receptors and that this effect may have therapeutic implications.", 
    "74": "To investigate a role for dopamine (DA) in steroidogenesis in the rat ovary, ovarian cells of pregnant-mare-serum gonadotropin (PMSG)-treated rats were incubated with DA agonists, antagonists, adrenergic drugs and beta-blocker for 1 h. DA, norepinephrine (NE) and isoproterenol (Iso) increased the level of progesterone (P4) and cAMP in the conditioned medium. D1 agonists (SKF38393, SKF82526J, CY208-243) increased P4 secretion, while the D2 agonist, bromocriptine, showed no significant effect on P4 secretion. The effect of NE or Iso was inhibited by the beta-blocker propranolol (Pro), but was not suppressed by the D2 antagonist, domperidone. The effects of D1 agonists were suppressed by bulbocapnine (Bul), while neither Pro nor the D2 antagonist, domperidone, affected the levels of P4. The D1 receptor was demonstrated in the PMSG-treated rat ovary, and its Bmax was 1.33 fmol/mg tissue and the Kd was 0.357 nM. These results suggest that DA has a direct stimulatory effect on P4 secretion in PMSG-treated rat ovarian cells through they D1 receptor. The observed action may indicate a physiological role for DA in the regulation of ovarian functions in rats.",

Each patient was tested with all of the study medications: vehicle alone, 0.1% metipranolol HCl + 2% pilocarpine HCl, 0.1% metipranolol HCl + 4% pilocarpine HCl, 0.3% metipranolol HCl + 2% pilocarpine HCl, and 0.3% metipranolol HCl + 4% pilocarpine HCl, in a single dose, randomized, double-masked, cross-over placebo-controlled trial. In addition, another eight age and baseline intraocular pressure (IOP)-matched subjects received 0.1% or 0.3% metipranolol HCl, while a similar group of 14 volunteers received 2% or 4% pilocarpine HCl. A two week washout period was instituted between the various groups of treatments. All four metipranolol-pilocarpine combinations were more effective than placebo or either medication alone in reducing the average IOP for up to 8 hours (p < 0.05 for each treatment group). Metipranolol HCl 0.3%, regardless of the pilocarpine concentration, demonstrated the most significant IOP lowering effect, reducing the IOP by 4.9 mm Hg or about 20% from baseline. However, 0.1% metipranolol HCl in combination with 4% pilocarpine HCl was found almost as effective with a 18.5% reduction in IOP from baseline, but a shorter duration of action. In conclusion, all metipranolol-pilocarpine combinations were more efficacious than either medication alone in a single-dose trial. Additional multiple-dose studies are needed to determine the long-term effectiveness and tolerance of combining 0.3% metipranolol HCl with either 2% or 4% pilocarpine HCl.", 
    "80": "The surgical stress can be defined as a complex array of neuroendocrine, haemodynamic, metabolic and inflammatory changes following surgical injury. These responses, when excessive, may contribute to increased postoperative morbidity and mortality. Thus a major endpoint of general anaesthesia is to protect the patient against the noxious stress response components. The different classes of anaesthetic or associated drugs are reviewed in this respect: sedative/hypnotics (barbiturates, etomidate, propofol, benzodiazepines), opioids, alpha-2 adrenergic agonists (clonidine), non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, intravenous local anaesthetics. Central and peripheral sensitization phenomenons--ie the sympathoadrenal response to surgery--might likely be efficiently attenuated by preemptive analgesia, and/or well-designed computer-guided total intravenous anaesthesia. 119 references complete this review.",

Neither drug had an effect on tissue-type plasminogen activator or plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1). A significant correlation between fasting insulin and PAI-1 has previously been described and was confirmed in this study. The group treated with metoprolol showed a significant rise in fasting insulin after 6 months with no change in PAI-1.

    "83": "To examine whether the results of trials on the secondary prevention of myocardial infarction have led to a change of prescription practice, the discharge forms of a random sample of 737 patients admitted to a university hospital with a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (MI) with Q wave from 1982 to 1988 were examined. Information about cardiovascular and other risk factors, contraindications, and prescription of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (beta AA), acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and calcium channel blockers (CCB) was collected. The prescription of these drugs was analysed in relation to clinical variables and the date of patients' discharge from hospital. During the 7 years of follow-up, the prescription of beta AA increased gradually from 20% to 30-35%; the prescription of CCB was above 30% during the same period and did not change significantly with time. The prescription of ASA increased from 0% to 30-35% in the last 3 years of follow-up. Contraindications to beta AA were present in 23.2% of cases and contraindications to ASA in 14.4%. In a multivariate analysis, hypertension (odds ratio 2.29, 95% confidence interval 1.55-3.38) and the period 1986-1988 (OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.57-3.30) were associated with the prescription of beta AA, although the prescription of beta AA decreased significantly with advancing age. Other variables inversely associated with the prescription of beta AA were contraindications (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.24-0.66) and the presence of heart failure during admission (OR 0.08, 95% CI 0.03-0.20).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "84": "Methylphenidate hydrochloride, when administered as a single 75 to 100 mg/kg i.p. dose, was found to produce hepatic necrosis in male ICR mice. Peak hepatotoxicity, as measured by serum ALT elevations, occurred 16 hours post-treatment while maximal histopathological evidence of hepatotoxicity occurred 24-48 hours after the methylphenidate dose. Liver injury measured by either method was essentially nonexistent for dosages < or = 50 mg/kg in male mice, and was only minimally evident in female mice at the highest dosage testable. Co-treatment of mice with either alpha 1- or alpha 2-adrenergic agonist drugs had no meaningful effect on methylphenidate-induced hepatotoxicity. In contrast, the beta-adrenergic agonist drug isoproterenol produced a striking potentiation of the liver injury, and shifted the apparent threshold for toxicity approximately 5- to 10-fold. Co-administration of methylphenidate with the mixed alpha/beta-adrenergic agonist dobutamine or with the beta 2-selective agonists metaproterenol, ritodrine or terbutaline produced a similar potentiation of toxicity. Parallel tests with beta-adrenergic antagonists revealed that the potentiation by isoproterenol could be significantly diminished by a single dose of the non-selective beta-adrenoreceptor blocking drug nadolol or the beta 2-selective antagonist ICI-118,551, but not the beta 1-selective antagonist metoprolol. Collectively, these observations suggest that potentiation of methylphenidate hepatotoxicity occurs through stimulation of beta 2-adrenoreceptors. Mice co-treated with isoproterenol were found to have substantially higher serum and liver methylphenidate levels following the methylphenidate dose, and significant increases were also observed in the area-under-the-curve (AUC) for methylphenidate in both tissues of isoproterenol co-treated mice. The results of this study suggest that beta 2-adrenergic agonist drugs are capable of potentiating methylphenidate-induced hepatotoxicity in mice by increasing hepatic methylphenidate concentrations.", 
    "85": "A 61-year-old man developed renovascular hypertension characterized by nephrotic-range proteinuria. When he was treated with a calcium channel blocker, glomerular filtration fraction was 0.26 and massive proteinuria ranging from 10 to 15 g/day persisted. An angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor markedly reduced the proteinuria to 1-2 g/day with a filtration fraction of 0.20. After the antihypertensive drug was switched to a beta-blocker, the filtration fraction was 0.23 and urinary protein excretion was 3-4 g/day. Blood pressure control was comparable by each drug. These findings suggest a role of intraglomerular hydraulic mechanism in the etiology of massive proteinuria in renovascular hypertension.", 
    "86": "1. IgG1-mediated anaphylactic bronchoconstriction was elicited by intravenous administration of antigen to guinea-pig 2 days after passive sensitization with IgG1-rich serum, and this response was not affected by heating the serum (at 56 degrees C, for 4 h). IgE-mediated bronchoconstriction, provoked 14 days after passive sensitization with IgE-rich serum, was completely abolished by the heating of the serum. 2. S-1452 (10 mg kg-1, p.o.), a selective thromboxane (Tx) A2 antagonist, significantly but incompletely suppressed the IgG1-mediated bronchoconstriction, but did not affect the IgE-mediated one, while diphenhydramine (5 mg kg-1, i.v.), a histamine antagonist, almost completely inhibited both IgG1- and IgE-mediated bronchoconstriction. 3. Pretreatment with propranolol (1 mg kg-1, i.v.), a beta-adrenergic blocker, in addition to diphenhydramine, caused a long-lasting bronchoconstriction following antigen challenge in both animal models. This histamine-independent bronchoconstriction was markedly suppressed by S-1452 at a low dose of 0.1 mg kg-1. 4. A significant increase in bronchial responsiveness to i.v. acetylcholine (ACh), compared to the prechallenge value, occurred as early as 3 min and persisted for 24 h after antigen challenge in the IgG1 model, but was not observed in the IgE model. S-1452 (10 mg kg-1, p.o.) inhibited the IgG1-mediated bronchial hyperresponsiveness, as assessed 60 min after antigen challenge. 5. A marked elevation of TxB2 levels was observed in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) 3 min after antigen challenge in the IgG1 model, while levels were not changed in the IgE model. In contrast, the plasma TxB2 level assessed 1 min after antigen challenge was increased in both the IgGI and IgE models.6. The results indicate that the inhibition of IgGl- but not IgE-mediated bronchoconstriction by higher doses of S-1452 may result from the suppression of increased bronchial responsiveness to allergic mediators such as histamine, which is probably due to TxA2 generated in the airway lumen rather than in plasma. In both the IgGI and IgE models, plasma TxA2 appeared to contribute directly to the bronchoconstriction, its action being almost completely masked by histamine-mediated bronchoconstriction.", 
    "87": "1. Arterial blood pressure, heart rate and cardiac contractility were measured in pentobarbitone-anaesthetized mongrel dogs and in conscious, instrumented dogs. 2. In anaesthetized dogs (n = 5), dose-response curves were obtained by intravenous infusion of increasing doses of dopexamine (5-20 micrograms kg-1 min-1). Infusions were administered three times to each animal to determine whether the responses were reproducible. Dopexamine increased heart rate and myocardial contractility and decreased blood pressure. The dose-response curves for dopexamine did not differ significantly over time. 3. In a second group of dogs (n = 6), dose-response curves (5-20 mg kg-1 min-1) were obtained as above and repeated after the administration of amitriptyline (2 mg kg-1, i.v.). Amitriptyline caused a non-significant reduction in the inotropic and chronotropic responses to dopexamine. 4. Control dose-response curves for dopexamine (5-50 micrograms kg-1 min-1) were similarly obtained in a third group of dogs (n = 6), and repeated after bilateral vagotomy and sympathetic denervation of the heart. In these animals, a third dose-response curve for dopexamine was obtained after the administration of ICI 118551 (0.2 mg kg-1, followed by 0.2 mg kg-1 h-1). The chronotropic response to dopexamine was significantly reduced after cardiac denervation. There was a small, non-significant reduction in the inotropic and depressor responses after denervation. Administration of ICI 115881 significantly reduced both the inotropic and chronotropic response to dopexamine and caused a non-significant reduction in the depressor response. 5. The effect of raclopride (0.2 mumol kg-1, p.o.) was investigated by comparison of the dose-response curves for dopexamine in a control group of dogs (n = 6) to those obtained in dogs which had been pretreated with raclopride (n = 5). Raclopride had no significant effect on the cardiovascular responses to dopexamine. 6. In conscious, instrumented dogs (n = 5), pretreated with raclopride, dose-related positive inotropic and chronotropic and depressor responses to dopexamine infusions were recorded. The chronotropic responses in conscious animals were significantly greater than those in the anaesthetized animals.7. The results of this study indicate that both the positive inotropic and chronotropic actions of dopamine are due to a combination of direct, Beta2-adrenoceptor-mediated effects and the baroreceptor reflex response to the depressor action of the drug.", 
    "88": "The present study was undertaken to know whether the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) is increased by quick stretch, a dynamic mechanical stimulus in porcine coronary artery in order to inquiry the possibility that IP3 could mediate Ca2+ release in the stretch-induced contraction. Quick stretching of a helical strip of porcine coronary artery at a rate of 10 cm/sec, the amount of stretch equivalent to 140% of the initial muscle length (= 100%), and the stimulus period of 30 sec with 20-min intervals, produced delayed contraction. Quick stretching increased the content of IP3 about three-fold over the control basal level, which always preceded the contraction. A putative phospholipase C inhibitor, 2-nitro-4-carboxyphenyl-N,N-diphenylcarbamate (NCDC), abolished the increase in the formation of IP3 and partially inhibited the stretch-induced contraction. The results suggest that quick stretching increases the formation of IP3 through a possible mechanism for activation of phospholipase C, which may lead to release of Ca2+ into myoplasm and to further activation of the contractile elements.", 
    "89": "To investigate the possible major source of thyroid autoantibodies production, blood samples were obtained from thyroid vein, jugular vein and peripheral vein during subtotal thyroidectomy in 12 patients with Graves' disease (11F, 1M; age 16-39 yr). Among them, 7 were treated preoperatively by methimazole, 4 by iopanoic acid and 1 by propranolol. All blood samples were assayed for thyroglobulin (Tg), thyrotropin binding inhibition immunoglobulin (TBII), antithyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) and antimicrosomal antibody (McAb). Tg, a native product of thyroid gland, was markedly elevated in the thyroid veins, over 4 to 6 folds that of jugular veins or peripheral veins. However, the level of thyroid autoantibodies including TBII, TgAb and McAb in the thyroid veins were not significantly different from that in the jugular or peripheral veins. Our preliminary data suggest that it is thyroglobulin, and not thyroid antibodies that is present at higher level in the thyroid vein than the periphery.", 
    "90": "We compared the hyperglycaemic effect of intranasal and intramuscular (i.m.) administration of glucagon after insulin-induced hypoglycaemia. Twelve healthy subjects were examined twice, receiving on both occasions an intravenous insulin bolus. Somatostatin and propranolol were administered to block endogenous glucose counterregulation, and glucose turnover was estimated by a 3-[3H]-glucose infusion. When hypoglycaemia was reached, the subjects received either i.m. glucagon of pancreatic extraction (1 mg) or intranasal genetically engineered glucagon (2 mg). The incremental values for plasma glucose concentrations 15 min after intranasal and i.m. administration of glucagon differed marginally. However, after 5 min the glucose appearance rate, as well as the incremental values for plasma glucose, were significantly higher for the i.m. glucagon treatment. The mean time taken for incremental plasma glucose to exceed 3 mmol.l-1 was significantly shorter for i.m. glucagon. The mean plasma glucagon level increased faster after i.m. glucagon than after intranasal glucagon, and the levels remained higher throughout the study period. We conclude that glucose recovery was significantly better after i.m. administration of glucagon than after intranasal administration. However, the differences between the incremental plasma glucose and the time for incremental plasma glucose to exceed 3 mmol.l-1 were not considered of major clinical importance.", 
    "91": "Ocular blood flow in the retina, choroid and optic nerve head should be measured in addition to the intraocular pressure (IOP) in order to better diagnose glaucoma disease and to better evaluate the efficacy of antiglaucoma drugs. It was found that beta-adrenergic blockers, the most widely used antiglaucoma drugs, reduced ocular blood flow in animals and worsened glaucoma disease in some patients, even though the IOP was reduced to the normal range. Therefore, their use for glaucoma treatment requires careful re-evaluation. On the other hand, most dopamine antagonists were found to reduce the IOP and increase the blood flow to the retina, choroid, iris and ciliary muscle. Therefore, these agents could be used for glaucoma treatment. Further, dopamine antagonists were found to improve retinal function after ischemia and, thus, also could be used for the treatment of ischemic retinopathy.", 
    "92": "There are two major novel metabolism-based drug design concepts which have significant advantages when used in the design of safe, specific ophthalmic drugs. One is based on predictable enzymatic activation processes by enzymes found exclusively or preferentially at the site of action--in this case, within the eye, primarily in the iris-ciliary body. The second major retrometabolic design technique involves soft drug approaches. Among the various soft drug design strategies, it was found that the \"inactive metabolite\" and the \"soft analog\" approaches are the most useful for designing safe and selective ophthalmic drugs. In the first case, the design process starts with a known (or predicted) inactive metabolite (Mi) of the drug (D). This Mi is then structurally modified in the \"chemical activation\" stage to the soft drug (SD), which is isosteric and/or isoelectronic with D to produce activity at the target receptors, similar to that of D. By design, however, SD is also subject to a facile, predictable (generally hydrolytic) metabolism leading in one step to the starting inactive Mi. As this deactivation takes places everywhere in the body, the desired activities are produced virtually exclusively at the target site at or near the place of application. Successful use of this general concept has led to soft beta-blockers as safe antiglaucoma agents, soft anticholinergics as short acting mydriatic agents, and soft corticosteroids as a type of novel, safe anti-inflammatory agents, which due to their unique design, do not elevate intraocular pressure IOP and do not produce other systemic and local side effects.", 
    "93": "Epinephrine increased outflow facility and cyclic AMP in the in vitro perfused human anterior segment with a maximal facility increase of 44% occurring at approximately 2 x 10(-5) M. Cyclic AMP measured in the perfusate from anterior segments increased by 12-14 fold after administration of 10(-5) M epinephrine. Both the facility increase and cyclic AMP rise were blocked by the beta-2 selective antagonist, ICI118,551. While there was a correlation between the facility increase and elevation in cyclic AMP levels, the rise in cyclic AMP preceded the facility increase by about 1 hour, suggesting that the ultimate effect of epinephrine involved a rather slow event such as synthesis and release of prostaglandins or protein synthesis. Subsequent perfusion studies showed that very large concentrations of indomethacin were necessary to block the outflow facility effect of epinephrine, suggesting that prostaglandin synthesis did not underlie the facility effect in this system. However, 5 x 10(-5) M cyclohexamide blocked the effect on outflow facility of both epinephrine and forskolin, but did not block the rise in cyclic AMP. These studies suggest that protein synthesis may play a role in the epinephrine-induced facility increase at some point beyond the second messenger level.", 
    "94": "Trimetoquinol [1-(3',4',5'-trimethoxybenzyl)-6,7-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4- tetrahydroisoquinoline , TMQ] exists as two enantiomers, and the (-)-(S)-isomer is a potent beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) agonist. Experiments were conducted to examine the functional and biochemical potencies of the (S)-and (R)-enantiomers of TMQ for interaction with beta-AR subtypes in tissues, membrane fractions, and cell systems. The isomeric-activity ratios (IARs) of the TMQ isomers [(S)-isomer > > (R)-isomer] for stimulation of beta 1- and beta 2-AR of guinea pig right atria and trachea were 224 and 1585, respectively; these IARs were similar to those observed on atypical beta-AR systems of rat distal colon (575), rat brown adipocytes (398), but differed from that of rat esophageal smooth muscle (2884) in the presence of pindolol. In the absence of pindolol, the potencies for the TMQ enantiomers were slightly increased; however, the IARs remained unchanged in rat distal colon, rat brown adipocytes, and rat esophageal smooth muscle. Similarly, radioligand binding studies demonstrated that the TMQ isomer beta-AR affinities were stereoselective for the (-)-(S)-isomer in membranes of guinea pig left ventricle (beta 1) and lung (beta 2) giving IARs of 115 and 389, respectively; and in E. coli expressing human beta 1- and beta 2-AR giving IARs of 661 and 724, respectively. Corresponding IARs of receptor affinities and stimulation of cAMP accumulation in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing human beta 2-AR and rat beta 3-AR were 331 and 282, and 118 and 4678, respectively. These results indicate that the (-)-(S)-isomer of TMQ exhibits high affinity, and is a potent and highly stereoselective agonist for each beta-AR subtype, that the isomers generally fail to differentiate between the beta-AR subtypes, and that, based upon differences in IAR within beta 3-AR containing systems, subtypes of atypical beta (or beta 3)-AR may exist in adipose tissue and smooth muscle."
