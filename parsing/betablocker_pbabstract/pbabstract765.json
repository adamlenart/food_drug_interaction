    "0": "Mechanical stimulation of the mucosa of the proximal colon evoked a hyperemia which also could be elicited when severing the autonomic fibres to the colon. Mechanical stimulation of the distal colon produced a hyperemia which, on the other hand, was abolished by cutting the pelvic nerves. Afferent pelvic nerve stimulation evoked a response similar to that seen when stimulating the distal colon. Adrenergic and cholinergic receptor blockers did not affect the studied colonic vasodilations. Dihydroergotamine, given in doses abolishing the vascular effects of i.a. injected 5-hydroxytrptamine, abolished the hyperemia to mechanical stimulation of the proximal colon but not that of the pelvic stimulation. It is concluded that a local nervous vasodilator reflex exists in the proximal colon similar to that earlier demonstrated in the small bowel (Biber et al. 1971) and that the reflex vasodilatation evoked by mechanical stimulation in the distal colon is mediated via the pelvic nerves. Hence, the vascular control differs in the proximal and in the distal parts of the colon.", 
    "1": "The influence of intramural noradrenaline on potassium induced contractures was studied in isolated preparations of the uterus and the portal vein of the rat. Uterine strips of oophorectomized rats responded with contraction followed by transient relaxation when immersed in a medium containing 127 mM potassium chloride. Reserpinization or blockade of beta-adrenoceptors with propranolol greatly diminished the transient relaxation. In the isolated portal vein, both noradrenaline depletion with reserpine and alpha-adrenoceptor blockade (phentolamine) reduced the active tension produced in response to the isotonic potassium solution. These results suggest that intramural noradrenaline plays a significant role in the development of contractures evoked by potassium in the uterus and the portal vein of the rat. In the uterus, the released noradrenaline counteracts the development of active tension, whereas in the portal vein, noradrenaline has a contractile effect which is added to that of potassium. Estrogen treatment reduced (portal vein) or abolished (rat uterus) the contractile effects of intramural noradrenaline. The adrenolytic effect of estrogen is possibly due to reduction in the release of noradrenaline from the sympathetic nerve-endings.", 
    "2": "Ornithine decarboxylase activity was higher in the left ventricle than in the right ventricle of the rat. Swimming exercise for 2 hours caused an increase in left ventricular but not right ventricular enzyme activity. This effect was not influenced by the prior injection of propranolol, which also had no influence on the resting level of ornithine decarboxylase activity. After 4 hours' exposure to 400 mm Hg the decarboxylase activity became greater in the right ventricle. This was attributed to the increased work-load on the right ventricle caused by hypoxic pulmonary hypertension. In the left ventricle, ornithine decarboxylase showed an initial increase in activity followed by a transient decrease at 16 hours. Propranolol had no effect on the changes observed in either ventricle. It is concluded that beta-receptor stimulation is not involved in the mechanism of an increased myocardial ornithine decarboxylase activity during increased cardiac work.", 
    "3": "Experiments with the guinea pig ileum, trachea, and vas deferens, the rat fundal strip, the rabbit jejunum and aortic strip, and the toad heart indicated that 2-amino-1-p-nitrophenylpropane-1,3-diol, the hydrolytic product of chloramphenicol, inhibited smooth muscles. Its action was direct and not through any mediators. After intravenous administration, the compound produced vasodepression followed by an overshooting rise of blood pressure. Vasodepression was not mediated by adrenergic, cholinergic, or histaminergic mechanisms. Hypertension was a sympathomimetic effect. Muscle relaxant and cardiovascular effects of the compound were similar to those of chloramphenicol, although it had no antibacterial effect.", 
    "4": "In order to investigate the mechanism of sperm transport along the genital ducts, intraluminal pressure of isolated segments of the vas deferens was recorded in vivo. Responses to filling and mechanical as well as pharmacologic and electric stimulation of the autonomic nervous system were monitored. Contraction waves were initated in response to the stretch of filling and from mechanical stimulation. Pharmacologic response was variable. Low doses of alpha-adrenergic stimulant produced an increase in frequency of the contraction wave. Large doses of the same drug induced stroking contraction of the entire vas. alpha-Blocking drugs did not alter the rhythmic activity of the vas. beta-Adrenergic stimulation blocked peristaltic activity while administration of parasympathomimetic drugs increased the force of contraction. Electric stimulation of the hypogastric nerve produced strong sustained contractions. These data suggest that, whenever stretched, the vas deferens responds by regular peristaltic waves of low amplitude. These peristaltic waves can be enhanced by sympathomimetics or electric stimulation of the sympathetic system. The contents of the vas are propulsed into the urethra through strong rhythmic contractions of the entire vas.", 
    "5": "A 29-year-old woman suffered acute laryngospasm on taking the initial dose of propranolol hydrocholoride for the treatment of hypertension associated with a hyperdynamic circulatory state. Hypersensitivity to the tartrazine additive used as a stabilizing agent in oral propranolol appeared the likely cause of anaphylaxis, although a direct hypersensitivity to propranolol itself could not be excluded.", 
    "6": "A major difficulty in the investigation of chronic facial pain has been a practical classification permitting the selection of appropriate diagnostic procedures to elucidate the etiology of the pain and to provide appropriate therapy. Categorization of facial pain syndromes into vascular, neuritic, muscular, rheumatic, traction and inflammatory and psychogenic groups provides a useful approach to the problem. Despite the utility of this method and advances in noninvasive diagnostic techniques, many pain syndromes remain refractory to full understanding and/or therapy and will test the physician's patience and perseverance.", 
    "7": "The right hind limbs of rats (which had previously implanted intraventricular guide cannulae) were isolated from the systemic circulation, but with the nerves to the limb remaining intact, and perfused using a constant output blood pump. Using this preparation, changes in vascular resistance, blood pressure and heart rate were monitored following injection of noradrenaline, phentolamine and propranolol into the lateral cerebral ventricles (i.c.v.) of rats anaesthetised with alpha-chloralose. All three drugs lowered blood pressure. Noradrenaline administered i.c.v. induced a nervously mediated vasocilatation and an insignificant fall in heart rate whereas i.c.v. phentolamine administration was followed by a nervously mediated vasoconstriction in the isolated hind limb and a gradual rise in heart rate. After i.c.v. administration of propranolol there was no evidence of an immediate nervously mediated vasodilatation but heart rate fell significantly. Following i.c.v. phentolamine or propranolol vasodilatation did not occur in the hind limb until after the time taken for circulating blood ro reach the isolated vascular bed. The vasodilatatory and hypotensive responses to i.c.v. noradrenaline were not evident following prior i.c.v. injection of phentolamine. These results indicate the suitability of this preparation for investigations of central actions of other drugs.", 
    "8": "Alprenolol was administered orally and intravenously to 5 healthy subjects before and after 10 to 14 daily doses of 0.1 gm pentobarbital. The area under the plasma concentration time curve after an oral 200-mg dose decreased from 706 +/- 277 to 154 +/- 48 ng/ml-hr (mean and SD) with the barbiturate treatment, but there was no significant change in elimination rate. The change in area corresponded to an increase in extraction by the liver from 0.72 +/- 0.13 to 0.93 +/- 0.01. The disposition of a 5.0-mg intravenous dose of alprenolol did not change significantly after pentobarbital treatment. There was no indication of a marked change in hepatic blood flow estimated from the clearance of alprenolol after intravenous administration. It is concluded that pentobarbital administration induces the metabolism of alprenolol in man and that the pharmacokinetic theories derived for hepatic extraction of drugs subject to a high metabolic clearance can be successfully applied.", 
    "9": "Out of 12 patients in whom phenylephrine terminated ventricular tachycardia, four were selected for detailed studies of its mechanism of action. Pretreatment with edrophonium (15-20 mg, i.v.) decreased, while atropine (2.4 mg, i.v.) increased by at least a factor of two, the dose of phenylephrine required to break ventricular tachycardia. Carotid sinus massage following pretreatment with edrophonium in unusually high (15-20 mg, i.v.) doses broke ventricular tachycardia in all four patients. The evidence presented supports the assumption that a vagal mechanism caused both instances of termination. These findings significantly alter our interpretation of vagal interventions in the bedside clinical diagnosis of wide QRS complex tachycardias.", 
    "10": "The effect of chemical stimulation of the area postrema (AP) with noradrenalin (NOR) and its blocking agents was studied in alert guinea pigs submitted to noxious peripheral stimuli (electric shock). The animal's motor defense and vocalizing responses during and after nociceptive stimulation were studied. Topical administration of NOR in the AP at a concentration of 150 microgram/microliter decreased the vocalizing and movement responses with both threshold and overthreshold stimulation. Phentolamine (5 microgram/microliter) elicited the opposite response, i.e. increase in vocalization and movements. Propranolol elicited a brief reduction of the threshold response. These results suggest an involvement of the AP in the mechanism of nociceptive stimulation through alpha-adrenergic mediation. The inhibition of the response to the noxious stimulus may be the consequence of a vagal activation triggered by the AP.", 
    "11": "A method was developed to measure the oxygen cost of ventilation during CO2 rebreathing. In 20 healthy normal subjects SGaw, MMEF, and FEV1 were measured prior to and following the infusion of propranolol. In five of the same subjects airway constriction was induced by inhalation of histamine. The use of both agents was followed by a significant decrease in the ventilation response to carbon dioxide inhalation. Even more significantly, the oxygen cost of the increase in ventilation measured during CO2 rebreathing rose significantly following either propranolol or histamine.", 
    "12": "Reactive metabolite products of the drug practolol were generated in vitro using the rat liver mixed function oxidase complex. The metabolites were spontaneously coupled to a non-agglutinating rabbit antibody to human O red blood cells, so forming a metabolite-antibody reagent. This reagent was then used to passively sensitize human O red cells which subsequently acted as indicator cells for detecting anti-metabolite antibodies.", 
    "13": "Sinus node recovery time (SRT) was measured in 30 patients with healthy sinus nodes to examine the influence of the increase in atrial frequency, atropine and beta-receptor blockade. The measurements were performed following pacing with 3 atrial frequencies before and after administration of 1 mg atropine i.v. (13 patients) and 0.4 mg prindolol (Visken) i.v. (17 patients). Total group; Increase of frequency alone caused prolongation of the SRT in 17 patients and shortening in 13 patients. Atropine group: Blockade of the parasympathicus alone induced a highly significant reduction in the SRT. Simultaneous increase in frequency and blockade of the parasympathicus led to greater SRT-shortening during low frequency than with high frequency. This interrelationship of frequency and blockade of the parasympathicus influencing the SRT is statistically significant. Visken-group: Blockade of the sympathicus causes a highly significant prolongation of the SRT. Simultaneous increase in frequency and blockade of the sympathicus led to greater SRT-prolongation during low frequency than with high frequency. This interrelationship of frequency and blockade of the sympathicus influencing the SRT has slight statistical significance. The results are discussed in respect to the electrophysiological influences of atrial cycle length shortening, acetylcholine and catecholamines on the sinus node, the perinodal atrial fibres and the atrial working myocardium.", 
    "14": "Increasing evidence suggests that higher blood velocity, by causing turbulence and high shear rates at the endothelial surfaces of arteries, may be important in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. In order to measure the effects of antihypertensive agents on blood velocity, an improved method has been developed for analysis of Doppler ultrasound velocity recordings. The audio signal from a Doppler velocity meter is subjected to spectral analysis; the sonagraph thus obtained is digitized with the use of a magnetic table on-line with a calculator. Four monkeys were maintained at a hypertensive baseline for six weeks by infusion of angiotensin and isoproterenol. The effects on blood velocity of 72-hour infusions of propranolol, clonidine, hydralazine, and methyldopa were studied. In doses that reduced diastolic pressure by 13--28%, propranolol decreased mean blood velocity (mv) by 17%, clonidine decreased mv by 14%, while methyldopa increased mv 12%, and hydralazine increased mv by 52% (p less than .00001). Antihypertensive drugs appear to have different effects on blood velocity; these differences may influence choice of antihypertensive drugs for the prevention of arterial disease.", 
    "15": "Rhesus monkeys weighing 6-8 kg and demonstrating regular menstrual cycles were used to delineate the relationships between the circadian patterns in spontaneous uterine activity, the urinary excretion of 2 catecholamines, norepinephrine and epinephrine, and the alterations in adrenergic neuroreceptors. In Experiment 1 norepinephrine and epinephrine concentrations were determined by the Zuspan and Cooley method. These values were correlated with the circadian patterns of spontaneous uterine activity. In Experiment 2 the effect on the circadian pattern evidenced by spontaneous uterine activity of pharmacologic depletion of catecholamines as well as selective blocking of alpha and beta adrenergic receptors, were evaluated. Constant iv infusion of reserpine was used to suppress catecholamines as well as selective blocking of alpha and beta adrenergic receptors, were evaluated. Constant iv infusion of reserpine was used to suppress catecholamines. In Experiment 1, lowest values occurred in the secretory phase during the periods of darkness, and highest values occurred in the proliferative phase during periods of light. Intrauterine pressure and norepinephrine excretion consistently exhibited diurnal variations conforming to sine curves and were statistically correlated (r = .838, p less than .001). In Experiment 2 the continuous infusion of reserpine produced a dose-related reduction in the average values and circadian patterns of uterine activity and norepinephrine and epinephrine excretion. Baseline resting pressures were reduced by phentolamine infusion. The frequency of contractions were also reduced and the diurnal variations of uterine activity abolished. Beta blockade increased the resting pressure and the amplitude of contractions. The results suggest that adrenergic receptors and catecholamines have a causal role in the occurrence of spontaneous variations in and the establishment of the circadian pattern of uterine activity.", 
    "16": "A double blind study was performed concerning effects and endurance of a combined therapy with beta-receptor blocker Pindolol (LB 46 Visken Sandoz/2 X 2 tabletes per 5 mg daily and Trichlormethiazidum Eurinol Spofa 3-dicholor-methyl-6-chlor-7-sulfamoyl 3,4-dihydro-1,2, 4-benzothiadiazin-1, 1-dyoxydum) 1 X1 tablet per 4 mg daily in 74 patients with essential hypertony in stadium II WHO. Reduction of the systolic as well as the diastolic blood pressure was already highly significant after the first two weeks of treatment (p less than 0.05). Heart frequency dropped from the average of 86,6 +/-8,6 per minute to 74 +/-16.8 per minute. All patients endured the medication very well.", 
    "17": "The tendency for patients with essential hypertension to differ markedly in antihypertensive response to propranolol could arise from pathophysiologic or pharmacokinetic differences between them. This possibility was investigated in 23 men with mild to moderately severe essential hypertension. At each of three propranolol doses, 40 mg, 80 mg, and 320 mg daily, approximately a 20-fold range in steady-state plasma propranolol concentrations was observed. Clinical response however was unrelated to plasma propranolol: oral dose ratio, since patients with higher plasma levels were less sensitive to the existing plasma drug concentration. When falls in blood pressure and plasma propranolol concentration were compared overall, a biphasic dose-response relationship was noted, with a first component at plasma propranolol concentrations of 3 to 30 ng/ml and a second at concentrations above 30 ng/ml. Only patients with increased sympathetic nervous system activity and high plasma renin activity (PRA) had substantial falls in pressure at propranolol levels of 3 to 30 ng/ml. Cardiac beta adrenergic receptor blockade, not suppression of PRA, seemed to be the antihypertensive mechanism. This relation of pretreatment sympathetic nervous activity and PRA to antihypertensive response existed only at lower plasma propranolol concentrations. With a propranolol dose of 320 mg daily, both plasma norepinephrine concentration and PRA were unrelated to the clinical response.", 
    "18": "High-pressure baroreceptor reflex sensitivity (BRS) was estimated by measuring the reflex heart rate response to pharmacologic elevation of blood pressure (phenylephrine, 150 to 200 microgram intravenously) in 18 patients with essential hypertension on two occasions: after a 4-wk placebo period and after 9 wk of incremental doses of oral timolol (20, 40, and 60 mg daily). On placebo, measurements were performed both before and after propranolol (0.2 mg/kg intravenously). The level of cardiac vagal inhibition, estimated by the heart rate change after atropine (0.04 mg/kg intravenously), was similar in placebo and on timolol, thereby permitting comparisons of BRS. BRS on placebo (before and after propranolol) correlated with BRS on timolol ( r = 0.87 and 0.90, p less than 0.001), attesting to the reproducibility of BRS measurements. BRS was unchanged by either short-term (propranolol) or long-term (timolol) beta adrenoceptor inhibition. Results were similar in responders (n = 10), whose mean arterial blood pressure on timolol fell by 10 mm Hg or more, and in nonresponders. The findings do not provide evidence for a change in gain of the baroreceptor reflex arc under conditions of short- or long-term beta adrenoceptor inhibition.", 
    "19": "The incidence of perioperative myocardial infarction (MI) determined by electrocardiogram was examined in 168 consecutive patients having only coronary artery bypass grafting at Yale-New Haven Hospital from July 1974 to June 1975. The incidence of MI and its mortality were correlated with clinical, hemodynamic, anatomic, and operative factors. Perioperative MI occurred in 23% of all patients (39/168); 26 in the inferior, 11 in the anterior, and two in the anterolateral wall. Three factors appeared related to the occurrence of MI: 1) abrupt propranolol withdrawal 24 hours prior to surgery (Prop) (32%, 33/103); 2) left main coronary artery disease (LMCD) (37%, 7/19); and 3) cardiopulmonary bypass longer than 60 minutes (CPB) (23%, 30/128). To more precisely predict MI, combinations of factors were examined. The combination of LMCD and CPB was 39%, (7/18) while the absence of either yielded an incidence of only 5.1% (2/39) (P less than 0.001). The mortality of patients with MI was 15.4% (6/39) while in patients without MI the mortality was 1.6% (2/129). We conclude that the risk of perioperative MI is significantly increased by abrupt propranolol withdrawal 24 hours before surgery, left main coronary artery disease, and cardiopulmonary bypass longer than 60 minutes in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. The mortality of perioperative MI is high, despite previous reports of the benignity of perioperative myocardial infarction.", 
    "20": "1. Bradykinin (0.02-5 microgram) applied to the epicardium of the left ventricle in the open-chest, anaesthetized dog, elicits dose-related reflex pressor effects and acceleration of the heart rate. 2. Bradykinin-induced reflex tachycardia was suppressed after the blockade of beta-adrenoceptors with propranolol, whereas reflex pressor responses were prevented by blocking the alpha-adrenoceptor sites with phenoxybenzamine. 3. Vagotomy and atropine treatment did not affect reflex hypertension and tachycardia to epicardial bradykinin. 4. After spinal section at C1, the pressor responses to epicardial bradykinin were significantly reduced, but still present in all but one experiment. A small acceleration of the heart occurred in two out of five spinal dogs with intact vagi and was absent in three vagotomized spinal dogs. 5. The results indicate the reflex activation of the sympathetic outflow to the heart and blood vessels, mediated mainly at a supraspinal level as a predominant mechanism for the cardiovascular response initiated by bradykinin-induced stimulation of cardiac pain receptors.", 
    "21": "The effect of practolol (a selective beta1-adrenergic receptor blocking agent) on increased blood insulin, sugar, lactate and FFA and decreased blood phosphorus and potassium induced by salbutamol (a primarily beta2-adrenergic stimulant) was studied in 6 normal volunteers. Practolol abolished the rise of lactate and glucose, suggesting that changes in these parameters due to salbutamol are mediated by beta1-receptors. The rise of insulin and the fall of potassium were only partially inhibited, and the possible involvement of the beta2-receptors as well in these 2 cases cannot be ruled out. The decrease of phosphorus and the FFA rise were not affected and thus appear to be primarily dependent on beta2-receptors.", 
    "22": "To determine to what extent the effects of phentolamine (PHE) are mediated by the cardiac and vascular beta-receptors, the action of the drug was studied in anaesthetized cats pretreated with beta-blockers. Blockade of the cardiac beta-receptors with either propranolol or metoprolol entirely prevented the increases in heart rate, dP/dt and cardiac output caused by PHE. In animals pretreated with propranolol (in a dose blocking the vascular beta-receptors) or metoprolol (in a purely cardio-selective dose) PHE significantly lowered blood pressure to the same extent as in untreated controls. The effects of PHE on the heart are thus conditional on the integrity of cardiac beta-receptors, whereas it seems improbable that vascular beta-receptors have any part in its vasodilative action. Evidence presented in the literature rather suggests a predominantly central mode of action.", 
    "23": "Using adrenergic agonists and antagonists this study has demonstrated that adrenaline induced sweating is mediated via beta2-adrenoreceptors in the horse.", 
    "24": "As evidenced from experiments on rats, a combined application of apressin with obsidan and diprazine, and also of adenozine with nicotine-amidadenine-dinucleotide (NAD), as well as of adeozine with nicotine amide potentiates the protective effect of these substances in hypobaric hypoxia, increases the resistance of the animals to cerebral ischemia, brings down the excess lactate level and raises the redoz potential of the system lactic-acid-pyruvic acid in the brain of rats exposed to the effects of rarefied atmosphere.", 
    "25": "Functional significance of alpha and beta-adrenoreceptors and also possible involvement of the cyclic 3', 5'-AMP in the catecholamines regulation mechanism of the sodium and potassium ions transport in renal cortex slices of rats were studied. Epinephrine did not change the intracellular sodium and water content, but increased that of potassium in the cells. Phentolamine-a blocking agent of the alpha-adrenoreceptors--did not change the reaction of slices to epinephrine, while inderal--a beta-adrenoblocking agent-prevented accumulation of potassium by the cells occurring under the action of epinephrine. Isopropyl-nore-pinephrine reproduced the action of epinephrine on the electrolytes composition of the renal tissue. It is suggested that accumulation of postassium by the cells of the rats' renal cortex slices is consequent upon excitation of the beta-adrenoreceptors.", 
    "26": "The adenylate cyclase [ATP pyrophosphatelyase (cyclizing); EC 4.6.1.1] and beta-adrenergic receptor of plasma membranes of turkey erythrocytes were solubilized in an active form by treatment with either NaF or guanylylimidodiphosphate and digitonin. The solubilized enzyme was no longer stimulated by catecholamines, NaF, or guanine nucleotides. The digitonin extract was chromatographed on an alprenolol-agarose derivative. While the bulk of protein and all the adenylate cyclase activity passed unretarded through the column, the receptor was retained. It eluted free of enzyme activity with an alprenolol solution containing 1 M NaCl; the yield was 25-30%. The protein content of the alprenolol eluates was too low to be estimated by the Lowry technique and was assessed by a more sensitive fluorometric method. Under these conditions, the beta-adrenergic receptor was purified approximately 2000-fold in a single step with retention of all its pharmacological properties. These experiments establish that the beta-adrenergic receptor and the adenylate cyclase are independent entities which may be separated on a functional basis.", 
    "27": "1. The action of catecholamines on the transport and the distribution of Na and K and the resting membrane potential (E(M)) has been investigated in soleus muscles isolated from fed rats.2. In a substrate-free Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer adrenaline (ADR) (6 x 10(-6)M) increased (22)Na efflux by 83%, (42)K influx by 34%, and E(M) by 10%. Similar effects were exerted by noradrenaline (NA), phenylephrine, salbutamol and isoprenaline. The effects of ADR on Na-K transport and E(M) were suppressed by ouabain (10(-3)M) and propranolol (10(-5)M), but not by thymoxamine (10(-5)M) or tetracaine (10(-4)M).3. Following 90 min of incubation in the presence of ADR (6 x 10(-6)M), the intracellular K/Na-ratio was increased threefold. NA produced almost the same change, and both catecholamines seem to induce a new steady-state distribution of Na and K which can be maintained for several hours in vitro.4. The effect of ADR on (22)Na efflux and E(M) could be detected at concentrations down to 6 x 10(-9) and 6 x 10(-10)M, respectively, and half-maximum increase was obtained at around 2 x 10(-8)M. NA was at least one order of magnitude less potent.5. The effect of low concentrations of ADR on (22)Na efflux was potentiated by theophylline (2 mM). When added together, dibutyryl-cyclic AMP and theophylline mimicked the action of ADR on (22)Na efflux, (42)K influx, Na/K content and E(M). Ouabain (10(-3)M) also suppressed the effect of dibutyryl-cyclic AMP and theophylline on Na-K transport.6. Following the addition of ouabain (10(-3)M), E(M) rapidly dropped from a mean of -71 to -63 mV, and then showed a slow linear fall for up to 4hr.7. The hyperpolarization induced by ADR was associated with a decrease in membrane conductance, (22)Na influx and (42)K efflux. The time course and the response to ouabain suggests that all of these effects are secondary to stimulation of the active coupled transport of Na and K.8. It is concluded that in rat soleus muscle, the active Na-K transport is electrogenic and susceptible to stimulation by catecholamines via beta-adrenoceptors. This effect is mediated by adenyl cyclase activation and may account for the increase in E(M) and the intracellular K/Na ratio.", 
    "28": "Biochemical (myocardial DNA, RNA, and hydroxyproline) and humoral (plasma [PRA] and kidney [KRA] renin activity) factors were determined in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar controls (NR) before and following treatment with minoxidil or propranolol. Minoxidil (150 mg.litre-1 drinking water) effectively controlled blood pressure (17.3 kPa vs 24.9 kPa [130 mmHg vs 187 mmHg], P less than 0.001) despite marked and sustained increases in both PRA and KRA ventricular weight which were not reduced and myocardial DNA, RNA, and hyperdroxyproline which were increased by minoxidil (P less than 0.01). In contrast propranolol did not reduce blood pressure in SHR but ventricular weight was reduced somewhat (3.1 +/- 0.4 mg.g-1 vs 3.4 +/- 0.09 mg.g-1, P less than 0.05); in both SHR and NR, KRA, and PRA were lowered by pranolol. Methyldopa which controlled blood pressure and lowered PRA led to a reversal of hypertrophy. Thus, although blood pressure control is obviously important for reversing cardiac hypertrophy, it may not be the sole factor for the development and reversal of cardiac hypertrophy.", 
    "29": "A survey of 192 patients receiving beta-blocking drug therapy has been carried out. An ophthalmological examination was performed on each patient with particular reference to the clinical status of the cornea and conjunctiva, and to lacrimal function. A selected control group of 52 patients was similarly investigated. The results indicate that the beta-blocking drugs administered to the survey group did not produce any significant adverse effect on the cornea, conjunctiva, or tear secretion when compared with the control group. The findings did not provide any evidence to incriminate the non-practolol beta-blocking agents with the production of ocular pathology.", 
    "30": "Subtetanic contractions of the guinea-pig isolated soleus, a slow-contracting skeletal muscle, were evoked by transmural field-stimulation. Isoprenaline caused a dose-dependent depression of the contractions. This effect was inhibited by propranolol and H 35/25 (1-(p-tolyl-2-isopropylamino-1-propanol) but not by practolol. Similar results were obtained for terbutaline. Tazolol and H 80/62 (1-isopropylamino-3-(p-hydroxyphenoxy)-2-propanol (HCl), selective beta1-agonists, had no effect per se but inhibited the effect of terbutaline. Adrenaline, noradrenaline, and dopamine all caused a dose-dependent decrease in the force of the soleus contractions, their potencies being in that order. Tyramine did not appreciably affect the contractions nor did it inhibit the effect of terbutaline. Pretreatment with reserpine, if anything, increased the response to terbutaline. It is concluded, in conformity with previous in vivo studies, that the adrenergic receptor mediating the effect on the soleus muscle contractions is of the beta2-type. Indirect sympathomimetic effects do not contribute to the responses observed on the isolated soleus muscle.", 
    "31": "The actions of methysergide, a 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) antagonist, have been examined on muscle strips taken from the circular and longitudinal layers of the human colon. Relaxations of the longitudinal muscle to 5-HT were antagonized by concentrations of methysergide known to be selective. Relaxations of the circular muscle to 5-HT were unaffected by similar concentrations of methysergide. Responses of both types of muscle to 5-HT were partially reduced by tetrodotoxin. Furthermore there was evidence for 5-HT receptors in circular colonic muscle which were unaffected either by selective concentrations of methysergide or tetrodotoxin.", 
    "32": "In human taenia coli electrical field stimulation after cholinergic blockade excited mainly non-adrenergic inhibitory nerves. Adrenergic relaxations during stimulation were demonstrated only with short electrical pulses at high frequencies or with ganglion stimulants. Reduction by tetrodotoxin of relaxations to indirectly acting sympathomimetics supports the histochemical finding that colonic adrenergic nerves are mainly preganglionic, and possibly synapse with non-adrenergic inhibitory nerves. When the latter undergo direct maximal stimulation, responses to adrenergic nerve excitation are masked.", 
    "33": "The effects of various beta-blocking agents upon the catecholamine-activated adenylate cyclase of human fat cell ghosts were studied. Both non-selective and cardio-selective beta-blocking drugs are capable in inhibiting the human enzyme system. The concentrations of the non-selective beta-blockers (bupranolol, alprenolol, propranolol, 4-hydroxypropranolol, prindolol and oxyprenolol) required to produce half maximal inhibition of isoproterenol-stimulated rates of cAMP-formation were found to be in a narrow range (5X10(-7) M-3X10(-6) M).The cardioselective beta-blocking agents, however, were only 1/100 (methypranol) to 1/1000 (atenolol, practolol) as potent as the non-selective drugs.", 
    "34": "Effects of nadolol, a new beta adrenergic antagonist, were determined on transmembrane potentials of canine Purkinje fibers and ventricular and atrial muscle. Significant alterations in Purkinje fiber potentials occurred only with nadolol concentrations of 10(-4) M or greater. After 1 hour exposure to 10(-4) M, resting potential and action potential amplitude were reduced; at 3 hours, action potential rate of rise, phase 2 duration and action potential duration at 75% repolarization also were decreased. 10(-3) M nadolol also was depressant and, additionally, consistently reduced membrane responsiveness. Nadolol (10(-8)-10(-4) M) had no significant effects on effective refractory period. Ventricular and atrial muscle were less sensitive to all drug concentrations. Nadolol (10(-8)-10(-4) M) had little action on automaticity in normal, ouabain-treated or stretched Purkinje fibers but markedly decreased catecholamine-enhanced automaticity. In isoproterenol-treated Purkinje fibers, pA2 for nadolol was 8.2 and 7.7 for propranolol. Nadolol (10(-3) M or less) did not affect isometric force developed by isolated canine atrial trabeculae. We suggest that direct membrane depressant effects of nadolol do not contribute to its antiarrhythmic activity and that its beta adrenergic blocking ability is beneficial in catecholamine-related cardiac ectopia.", 
    "35": "Possible adrenergic mechanisms involved in acetylcholine (ACh) induced potassium movements in the sinus node have been investigated using a tracer potassium (42K) and a microelectrode technique. The ACh-induced increase in 42K uptake was enhanced by propranolol and was unaffected by phentolamine. Reserpinization neither prevented the ACh-induced increase in 42K uptake nor the enhanced effect in the presence of propranolol. In reserpinized preparations, ACh-induced 42K uptake was the same before and after norepinephrine (NE) administration, but was greater after acute reserpinization. NE alone induced an increase in 42K uptake but the simultaneous administration of ACh and NE provoked an increase in 42K uptake similar to that obtained with ACh alone. When both neuromediators and atropine were given simultaneously, an increase in 42K uptake did not occur. Thus, the ACh induces an increase in 42K uptake independently of NE. ACh antagonizes the NE effect on 42K uptake independently of a muscarinic interaction.", 
    "36": "The findings in a patient with an angiographically proven aneurysm of the coronary artery are described. The case is reviewed in the light of 115 similar cases reported in the literature. The patient had had numerous episodes of variant angina, a feature not previously described in coronary arterial aneurysms, which may be related to embolic showers originating from the aneurysm.", 
    "37": "In conscious dogs with experimental atrioventricular block and with ventricles paced at constant rate the effects of norepinephrine (NE) and isoproterenol (ISO) on coronary flow, coronary resistance, and myocardial O2-balance were investigated. Myocardial O2-S balance, as estimated from continuous measurement of coronary venous O2-S saturation, was used for the discrimination of coronary dilation induced either directly by vascular beta-adrenoreceptor stimulation or indirectly by increased myocardial metabolism. Following bolus injection of NE (0.3 microgram/kg) or ISO (0.1 microgram/kg) into the pulmonary artery, coronary venous O2-S saturation increased from a control of 25 +/- 2% O2-S saturation (mean +/- S.D.) transiently to 51 +/- 5 and 62 +/- 5% O2-S saturation respectively. After beta1-adrenoreceptor blockade these increases were reduced to 33 +/- 4 and 41 +/- 3% O2-S saturation, respectively. The remaining increase after NE was abolished when atropine was given in addition to beta1-b blockade. After beta1 + 2-adrenoreceptor blockade neither NE nor ISO injection had an effect on coronary venous O2 saturation. After beta1-b blockade was superimposed on ganglionic blockade NE injection led to a decrease in coronary venous O2-S saturation indicating a latent alpha-a activity of NE. NE seems to act directly via beta1-a adrenoreceptors, since no differences were observed in the time courses of changes in coronary venous O2-S saturation after left atrial injection of NE when compared to adenosine. It is concluded that circulating NE like ISO is able to improve myocardial oxygen balance by a direct vasodilating effect on canine coronary vessels mediated by vascular beta1-adrenoreceptors.", 
    "38": "In 14 beta-blockaded anginal subjects, 10 of whom had poor left ventricular function, sublingual isosorbide dinitrate significantly increased maximal exercise capacity on a standardized multistage treadmill test. This was associated with changes in heart rate and blood pressure suggestive of a fall in left ventricular work. The effect of isosorbide lasts for at least two hours and when taken before exercise may be a useful addition to beta-blockade in patients with angina.", 
    "39": "Five to six millions of hypertensives live in the Federal Republic of Germany. Of these, about 70% are known to be hypertensives but only 30% are consistently treated. It is therefore not surprising that hypertension is one of the most common risk factors in patients who have to be operatively treated. The commonly approved principles of hypertensive therapy are compiled in the present study and classified with reference to the multivarious pathophysiological processes. In particular, special anesthesiologic problems are dealt with in detail. Furthermore, this paper provides the basic knowledge of the artificial fall in blood pressure under anesthetic conditions.", 
    "40": "Data are presented on 282 patients who began taking prazosin before March, 1975, and whose progress was followed until March, 1976. The following conclusions can be drawn. (i) Prazosin is an effective and useful antihypertensive agent, best used with a diuretic and a beta-blocker. (ii) For patients with suspected or definite coronary artery disease, prazosin should not be used without a beta-blocker. (iii) In patients suspected of having incipient heart failure, prazosin should not be used without a diuretic, and the latter should be given first. (iv) many patients have little or no rise in heart rate with prazosin. However, patients with sinus tachycardia or a history of arrhythmias should preferably not be treated with prazosin. (v) The initial dose should be kept small (0-25 to 0-5 mg). Subsequent increments should also be small, not more than 2 mg/day. (vi) If prazosin is added to a regimen containing an adrenergic neurone-blocking drug, the dose of the latter should first be reduced. (vii) Prazosin should not, in the meantime, be used concomitantly with a phenothiazine, as the combination appears to be capable of causing agitation and confusion. (viii) There seems to be no long-term toxicity.", 
    "41": "Prazosin has been used as an antihypertensive drug in the treatment of 93 patients in Dunedin since 1971-1972, mainly those whose previous control was unsatisfactory. It has led to very significant improvement of control in many cases; 48 patients now receiving the drug have taken it for an average of 30 months. Forty-five patients have stopped taking the drug for various reasons, such as failure to respond (11-8%), side effects (20-4%), myocardial infarction (8-6%) or unrelated reasons (7-5%). This reflects to some extent the use ofa new drug in patients who are difficult to control, and its use initially without concomitant diuretic and beta-blocker therapy. We believe that the place of praxosin is primarily as a third drug for patients whose hypertension does not respond satisfactorirly to a diuretic and a beta-blocker. The first dose must be kept small, preferably 0-25 mg, and even with this dose a small proportion of patients receiving diuretic and beta-blocker therapy seem to become hypotensive; patients should be warned about this. The plasma half-life in normal volunteers was 3-8 hours but in some patients it seems to be considerably longer.", 
    "42": "In a group of 6 healthy (but physically unfit) volunteers an investigation was made of whether there was a true plasma level effect relationship and absolute \"cardioselectivity\" with respect to beta-adrenoceptor blockade due to practolol. To this end three treatments were given orally, namely placebo, practolol 100 mg and practolol 400 mg. Cardiac beta-adrenoceptor blockade was assessed by measuring the inhibition of exercise heart rate and pulmonary beta-adrenoceptor blockade was assessed by measuring the reduction in exercise peak flow rate, up to 24 h after each dose. Plasma practolol levels were determined spectrophotometrically. From the results obtained there was no reason to doubt the existence of a valid relationship between cardiac beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity and the plasma concentration of practolol. It was also concluded that even in non-asthmatics, practolol does not possess absolute \"cardioselectivity\" since significant reductions in peak flow rate were discernible during vigorous exercise, particularly when the large dose had been given.", 
    "43": "The effect of adrenergic stimulation and blockade on the concentration of cAMP and cGMP was studied in the rat gastric mucosa. Adrenaline (0.5-2.0 mg/kg) elevated the gastric mucosal cAMP and cGMP levels up to 100% in a dose-dependent manner. Blockade of the beta-adrenoceptors with 4 mg/kg propranolol suppressed the adrenaline effect on the cAMP level and increased the effect on the cGMP concentration up to 500%. The opposite effect was found under alpha-adrenoceptor blockade. Phenoxybenzamine, 4 mg/kg, prevented the adrenaline effect on the cGMP level and increased the effect on the cAMP concentration up to 300%. Predominant stimulation of the beta-adrenoceptors by isoproterenol or of the alpha-adrenoceptors by phenylephrine caused smaller changes in the cyclic nucleotide concentration than did adrenaline. Their effect was more pronounced when the non-stimulated receptor was blocked. The data indicate that the rat gastric mucosa contains alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors. The effect of adrenaline on the gastric mucosal cAMP level is mediated by beta-adrenoceptors and that on the cGMP level by alpha-adrenoceptors.", 
    "44": "The effect of NA injected into the lateral cerebral ventricle on Tc was blocked by alpha-adrenergic receptor blockers, but not by beta-receptor blockers, whereas the effect of systemically administered NA was blocked by i.p. administered beta-receptor blockers, but not by alpha-blockers.", 
    "45": "In a controlled multicentre trial carried out to assess the value of long-term practolol treatment after myocardial infarction the provisional results showed a significant reduction in mortality, though some of the data were lacking. These have now been included and the results updated. The final figures for all deaths were 78 in the placebo group of 1533 patients and 48 in the practolol group of 1520 patients. The reduction in mortality (38%) was significant at the 1% level. The figures for non-fatal reinfarction (97 in the placebo group, and 75 in the practolol group) were not significantly different. Patients with pre-entry anterior infarction, and especially those with a diastolic blood pressure equal to or below the mean (78 mm Hg) at entry to the trial, were at high risk but benefited particularly well from beta-adrenoceptor blockade. After pre-entry inferior infarction the percentage reduction in deaths occurring within two hours after symptoms of a new event was similar to that after anterior infarction, but the incidence of death more than two hours after the event was greater in the practolol-treated group. Thus the difference between groups in total deaths after pretrial inferior infarction was marginal. Until the results of further trials are reported long-term beta-adrenoceptor blockade (possibly up to two years) is recommended after uncomplicated anterior myocardial infarction.", 
    "46": "There are three histological laminae within the rat olfactory tubercle: plexiform, pyramidal and polymorphic. We have assayed dopamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase in homogenates of frozen sections cut parallel to these laminae. Consecutive sections were cut of alternating thickness, 16 micron and 100 micron. The 16 micron sections were stained with toluidine blue to ascertain the depth and orientation of each section. The 100 micron sections were homogenized and assayed for dopamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase. Substantial levels of dopamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase were found within all three laminae. The results suggest that the enzyme occurs in cell processes, including dendrites, of the plexiform layer, and they are consistent with the localization of dopamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase in the pyramidal cells.", 
    "47": "The majority of in-hospital deaths from acute myocardial infarction occur as a result of the \"power failure\" syndrome (severe congestive heart failure and cardiogenic shock), which results from extensive loss of myocardium. The death of myocardial cells is sequential over many hours. Surrounding the central zone of necrosis in an acute myocardial infarction is a zone of ischemic myocardium whose fate might be altered by interventions during the early phase of the infarction. ST-segment mapping, serial measurement of the serum concentration of creatine phosphokinase and myocardial imaging by means of radionuclides are being developed for the noninvasive assessment of infarct size in animals and humans. A number of interventions appear to limit infarct size in animals. There have been relatively few studies in humans to date, but preliminary results suggest that infarct size might be limited by certain interventions. The research has provided important practical benefits in terms of understanding the course of acute myocardial infarction and the potential effects of conventional therapies. For the present, interventions designed to limit infarct size remain in the realm of clinical research; routine clinical use would be inappropriate."
