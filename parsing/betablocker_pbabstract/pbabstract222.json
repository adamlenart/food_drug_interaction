However, the specific involvement of each beta-adrenoceptor (beta-AR) subtype, in particular the low-affinity state of beta1-AR, has not yet been evaluated. We investigated whether the low-affinity state of beta1-AR-induced relaxation was impaired in Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats (SHR). 2 The relaxant responses to CGP 12177 and cyanopindolol, low-affinity state beta1-AR agonists (with beta1-/beta2-AR antagonistic and partial beta3-AR agonistic properties) were evaluated on thoracic aortic rings isolated from 12-weeks-old Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) and SHR. 3 In WKY, CGP 12177 and cyanopindolol produced an endothelium and nitric oxide (NO)-independent relaxation. CGP 12177-induced endothelium-independent relaxation was not modified either by beta1-, beta2-AR (nadolol) or beta3-AR (L-748337 or SR 59230A) antagonists but was significantly reduced by high concentrations of CGP 20712A (P<0.05). This relaxation was also reduced by adenylyl cyclase inhibitors, SQ 22536 or MDL 12330A. 4 In SHR, CGP 12177 produced mainly an endothelium and NO-dependent relaxation. This effect was not modified by nadolol, but was strongly reduced by beta3-AR blockade. Endothelium-independent relaxation to CGP 12177 was not altered by adenylyl cyclase inhibition, but was amplified in preparations from pertussis toxin-pretreated SHR. 5 The immunohistochemical analysis revealed an upregulation of beta3-AR in the endothelial layer of SHR aorta, whereas the beta3-AR-induced relaxation was not modified. 6 In conclusion, we demonstrated an impaired low-affinity state of the beta1-AR-induced relaxation and an upregulation of the beta3-AR in hypertension. Some clinical implications of those findings are discussed.", 
    "1": "Proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) contributes to the progression of atherosclerotic plaques. Calcium channel blockers have been shown to reduce VSMC proliferation, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. p21(Waf1/Cip1) is a potent inhibitor of cell cycle progression. Here, we demonstrate that amlodipine (10(-6) to 10(-8) M) activates de novo synthesis of p21(Waf1/Cip1) in vitro. We show that amlodipine-dependent activation of p21(Waf1/Cip1) involves the action of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and C/EBP-alpha. The underlying pathway apparently involves the action of mitogen-activated protein kinase or protein kinase C, but not of extracellular signal-related kinase or changes of intracellular calcium. Amlodipine-induced p21(Waf1/Cip1) promoter activity and expression were abrogated by C/EBP-alpha antisense oligonucleotide or by the GR antagonist RU486. Amlodipine-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation was partially reversed by RU486 at 10(-8) M (58%+/-29%), antisense oligonucleotides targeting C/EBP-alpha (91%+/-26%), or antisense mRNAs targeting p21(Waf1/Cip1) (96%+/-32%, n=6); scrambled antisense oligonucleotides or those directed against C/EBP-beta were ineffective. The data suggest that the anti-proliferative action of amlodipine is achieved by induction of the p21 (Waf1/Cip1) gene, which may explain beneficial covert effects of this widely used cardiovascular therapeutic drug beyond a more limited role as a vascular relaxant.", 
    "2": "We describe a 24-year-old Japanese woman with pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN) whose only early symptom was postural tremor in the right hand at around 18 years of age, leading to a diagnosis of essential tremor at age 21. Although she was treated with arotinolol hydrochloride and clonazepam, she gradually progressed to extrapyramidal and pyramidal signs several years later. T2-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRI) showed bilaterally marked hypointensity with a central region of hyperintensity in the globus pallidus, or the so-called \"eye-of-the-tiger\" sign. Six years have passed since the initial appearance of postural tremor, whereas she has not shown choreoathetosis, retinitis pigmentosa, optic atrophy, or seizure. Direct sequencing of the patient's genomic DNA revealed homozygous base substitutions in the pantothenate kinase gene (PANK2): the A764-->G substitution (N245S) due to consanguinity of her parents. Although the heterozygous form of this mutation has already been reported among several families, this is the first report of the homozygous mutation in a patient with atypical-type PKAN. This detailed description of the clinical features of a Japanese patient with PKAN arising from homozygous N245S mutations in PANK2 would be useful for elucidating the pathogenesis of PKAN.", 
    "3": "The purpose of the this study was to characterize the putative anxiolytic-like effects of the aqueous extract of Albizzia julibrissin stem bark using the elevated plus maze (EPM) in rats. The water extract of Albizzia julibrissin was orally administered at 10, 50, 100 or 200 mg/kg to adult male SD rats, 1 h before behavioral evaluation in an EPM, respectively. Control rats were treated with an equal volume of saline, and positive control rats buspirone (1 mg/kg). Single or repeated treatment (for 7 days) of the water extract of Albizzia julibrissin (at 100 or 200 mg/kg) significantly increased time-spent and arm entries into the open arms of the EPM, and decreased time-spent and arm entries in the closed arms of the EPM versus saline controls (P < 0.05). However, no changes in the locomotor activity and myorelaxant effect were seen in any group versus the saline control. In addition, the anxiolytic-like effects of Albizzia julibrissin extract were abolished by pindolol (10 mg/kg, i.p), a 5-HT(1A/1B) receptor antagonist. These results suggest that Albizzia julibrissin might proved to be an effective anxiolytic agent, and that it acts via the serotonergic nervous system.",

    "8": "We compared the predictive value of the Rush score with the Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) risk score in unselected patients with an acute coronary syndrome and evaluated the effect of compliance with established guidelines on the accuracy of these models. The Registry of Acute Coronary Syndromes is a retrospective registry of 3,754 consecutive patients (38% women; mean age 67 years) who presented with acute coronary syndrome to the emergency department between April 1, 1999, and December 31, 2000, at 9 hospitals. The primary end point was death, myocardial infarction, or urgent revascularization during hospitalization. Rush classification was based on quartiles of predicted risk of cardiac complication (<2% for class I vs >15% for class IV). The TIMI score was implemented as published. Compliance with guidelines for acute coronary syndrome was assessed with a 4-point scale based on the aggregate use of aspirin, beta blockers, heparin, and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors. Fifteen percent of patients met the primary end point. The primary end point rates for TIMI scores 0/1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6/7 were 11%, 14%, 13%, 11%, 14%, and 12%, respectively (p = NS). The primary end point rates for Rush classes I, II, III, and IV were 6%, 8%, 9%, and 17%, respectively (p <0.001). After controlling for compliance with established guidelines, the odds ratio of an event increased by 46% for each unit increase in Rush score (p <0.001). After adjusting for the Rush score, the odds ratio decreased by 54% for each unit increase in compliance (p <0.001). Thus, compliance with current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines significantly improves prognosis, regardless of the risk score. The use of established risk scores may overestimate event rates in unselected populations.",

Of these factors a patent false-lumen and a maximum aortic diameter greater than 40 mm upon admission were the most strongly associated factors with regard to the development of events. Patients with a patent false-lumen and a maximum aortic diameter greater than 40 mm upon admission were determined to exhibit significantly higher event rates than other patients.",

    "13": "The pharmacological activity of several amphiphilic drugs is often related to their ability to interact with biological membranes. Propranolol is an efficient multidrug resistance (MDR) modulator; it is a nonselective beta-blocker and is thought to reduce hypertension by decreasing the cardiac frequency and thus blood pressure. It is used in drug delivery studies in order to treat systemic hypertension. We are interested in the interaction of propranolol with artificial membranes, as liposomes of controllable size are used as biocompatible and protective structures to encapsulate labile molecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids or drugs, for pharmaceutical, cosmetic or chemical applications. We present here a study of the interaction of propranolol, a cationic surfactant, with pure egg phosphatidylcholine (EPC) vesicles. The gradual transition from liposome to micelle of EPC vesicles in the presence of propranolol was monitored by time-resolved electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) under different experimental conditions. The liposome-drug interaction was studied with varying drug/lipid (D/L) ratios and different stages were captured by direct thin-film vitrification. The time-series cryo-EM data clearly illustrate the mechanism of action of propranolol on the liposome structure: the drug disrupts the lipid bilayer by perturbing the local organization of the phospholipids. This is followed by the formation of thread-like micelles, also called worm-like micelles (WLM), and ends with the formation of spherical (globular) micelles. The overall reaction is slow, with the process taking almost two hours to be completed. The effect of a monovalent salt was also investigated by repeating the lipid-surfactant interaction experiments in the presence of KCl as an additive to the lipid/drug suspension. When KCl was added in the presence of propranolol the overall reaction was the same but with slower kinetics, suggesting that this monovalent salt affects the general lipid-to-micelle transition by stabilizing the membrane, presumably by binding to the carbonyl chains of the phosphatidylcholine.", 
    "14": "The risk of perioperative myocardial infarction or cardiac death in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery may be estimated by clinical risk factor analysis and by myocardial stress testing. While stress testing modalities accurately delineate reversible myocardial ischaemia, their positive predictive value is low, and it is not clear whether their implementation improves outcome when compared to risk stratification alone. Similarly, it remains to be shown that preoperative coronary revascularization is an effective strategy in reducing perioperative risk. Recent reports indicate that surgery undertaken in the first weeks after percutaneous coronary interventions may be associated with a significantly increased rate of major complications. Administration of beta-blockers and alpha2-adrenergic agonists to high-risk patients reduces surgical morbidity and mortality, and the benefits observed with beta-blockers may extend long after the operative period. In high-risk patients undergoing major surgery, pulmonary artery catheter-guided haemodynamic optimization has not been associated with better outcomes, whereas use of regional anesthetic techniques decreases the incidence of postoperative pulmonary, but not cardiac, complications.",

She began daily treatment with 60 mg metoprolol. However, the chest symptoms were not relieved and the left ventricular outflow tract obstruction was still visible on echocardiography. She was then given 200 mg daily of cibenzoline, in addition to 40 mg metoprolol, and the left ventricular pressure gradient significantly decreased and she was free of symptoms without any complications.

    "29": "Glucagon, secreted by the pancreatic alpha-cells, stimulates insulin secretion from neighboring beta-cells by cAMP- and protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent mechanisms, but it is not known whether glucagon also modulates its own secretion. We have addressed this issue by combining recordings of membrane capacitance (to monitor exocytosis) in individual alpha-cells with biochemical assays of glucagon secretion and cAMP content in intact pancreatic islets, as well as analyses of glucagon receptor expression in pure alpha-cell fractions by RT-PCR. Glucagon stimulated cAMP generation and exocytosis dose dependently with an EC50 of 1.6-1.7 nm. The stimulation of both parameters plateaued at concentrations beyond 10 nm of glucagon where a more than 3-fold enhancement was observed. The actions of glucagon were unaffected by the GLP-1 receptor antagonist exendin-(9-39) but abolished by des-His1-[Glu9]-glucagon-amide, a specific blocker of the glucagon receptor. The effects of glucagon on alpha-cell exocytosis were mimicked by forskolin and the stimulatory actions of glucagon and forskolin on exocytosis were both reproduced by intracellular application of 0.1 mm cAMP. cAMP-potentiated exocytosis involved both PKA-dependent and -independent (resistant to Rp-cAMPS, an Rp-isomer of cAMP) mechanisms. The presence of the cAMP-binding protein cAMP-guanidine nucleotide exchange factor II in alpha-cells was documented by a combination of immunocytochemistry and RT-PCR and 8-(4-chloro-phenylthio)-2'-O-methyl-cAMP, a cAMP-guanidine nucleotide exchange factor II-selective agonist, mimicked the effect of cAMP and augmented rapid exocytosis in a PKA-independent manner. We conclude that glucagon released from the alpha-cells, in addition to its well-documented systemic effects and paracrine actions within the islet, also represents an autocrine regulator of alpha-cell function.", 
    "30": "Central corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) delays gastric emptying through the autonomic nervous system. CRF plays an important role in mediating delayed gastric emptying induced by stress. However, it is not clear whether a sympathetic or parasympathetic pathway is involved in the mechanism of central CRF-induced inhibition of solid gastric emptying. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether 1) CRF inhibits solid gastric emptying via a peripheral sympathetic pathway and 2) stress-induced inhibition of solid gastric emptying is mediated via a central CRF and peripheral sympathetic pathways. Using male Sprague-Dawley rats, CRF was injected intracisternally with or without various adrenergic-blocking agents. To investigate whether central CRF-induced inhibition of solid gastric emptying is mediated via a peripheral sympathetic pathway, rats underwent celiac ganglionectomy 1 wk before the gastric emptying study. After solid meal ingestion (90 min), gastric emptying was calculated. To investigate the role of endogenous CRF in stress-induced delayed gastric emptying, a CRF type2 receptor antagonist, astressin2-B, was intracisternally administered. Rats were subjected to a restraint stress immediately after the feeding. Intracisternal injection of CRF (0.1-1.0 microg) dose-dependently inhibited solid gastric emptying. The inhibitory effect of CRF on solid gastric emptying was significantly blocked by guanethidine, propranolol, and celiac ganglionectomy but not by phentolamine. Restraint stress significantly delayed solid gastric emptying, which was improved by astressin2-B, guanethidine, and celiac ganglionectomy. Our research suggests that restraint stress inhibits solid gastric emptying via a central CRF type2 receptor and peripheral sympathetic neural pathway in rats.", 
    "31": "Intrinsic cardiac adrenergic (ICA) cells in developing rat heart constitute a novel adrenergic signaling system involved in cardiac regulation. Regulatory mechanisms of ICA cells remain to be defined. Immunohistochemical study of fetal rat hearts demonstrated ICA cells with catecholamine biosynthetic enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT). The mRNA of TH and PNMP was also detected in fetal rat hearts before sympathetic innervation. Immunoreactivity of norepinephrine transporter (NET) was localized to ICA cells in rat heart tissue and primary cell culture. For the functional study, the activity of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) transients was quantified by a ratio fluorescent spectrometer in cultured ICA cells and myocytes. ICA cells generated spontaneous [Ca2+]i transients that were eliminated by tetrodotoxin or Ca(2+)-free solutions and showed greatly reduced amplitude with the addition of L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine. [3H]norepinephrine studies demonstrate release and uptake of norepinephrine. Functional interaction between catecholamines produced by the ICA cells and cocultured myocytes was evident by the effect of the beta-adrenergic blocker atenolol eliciting a dose-dependent reduction in the amplitude and frequency of [Ca2+]i transients of beating myocytes. Hypoxia inhibited [Ca2+]i transient activity of ICA cells, which subsequently produced a reoxygenation-mediated rebound augmentation of [Ca2+]i transients. We conclude that ICA cells are capable of catecholamine synthesis, release, and uptake. They generate spontaneous [Ca2+]i transient activity that can be regulated by oxygen tension. ICA cells may provide an alternative adrenergic supply to maintain cardiac contractile and pacemaker function at rest and during stress in the absence of sympathetic innervation.",

The study found that beta2-AR agonists inhibited the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), CD40 and CD14 on monocytes, and that AR agonist activity was antagonized by the selective beta2-AR antagonist, butoxamine. The selective beta2-AR agonists salbutamol and terbutaline induced a similar co-stimulatory molecule expression pattern. The LPS-induced production of tumour necrosis factor-alpha was inhibited by AR agonists, and this was also antagonized by butoxamine, and mimicked by salbutamol and terbutaline. The AR agonists also inhibited T-cell proliferation through beta2-AR stimulation. This study clearly demonstrated that endogenous catecholamines elicited immunosuppressive effects through beta2-AR stimulation, possibly due to down-regulation of the expression of ICAM-1, CD40 and CD14 on monocytes. These results suggested that the sympathetic nervous system might regulate the T-helper cell balance via the peripheral end-effectors of the stress system.",

    "42": "Despite the importance of the adrenergic activity and of the metabolism of magnesium in some important cardiovascular pathologies, very little is known about how intracellular ionized magnesium (Mgi2+) is regulated by catecholamines. We made an in-vitro study of the variations in the concentration of ionized magnesium in human lymphocytes using the fluorescent probe furaptra in response to different catecholamines. We also made an ex-vivo study of the changes in intracellular ionized magnesium in lymphocytes in 20 subjects with essential arterial hypertension, 10 treated with 120 mg/d of propranolol and 10 with placebo. Norepinephrine and isoproterenol significantly decrease Mgi2+ and this effect is blocked by beta-blockers but not by alpha-blockers. The EC50 of the effect of norepinephrine is within the range of concentrations physiologically present in plasma. The substitution of extracellular sodium with choline blocks the decrease in intracellular ionized magnesium induced by norepinephrine, which leads us to suppose that the magnesium-reducing effect of catecholamines is a result of the activation of a Na+-Mg2+ exchanger. We were not able to demonstrate any change in intracellular ionized magnesium after 1 and 17 days of active treatment in essential hypertensives. The impossibility of demonstrating ex vivo the mechanism of catecholamine-mediated regulation that is evident in vitro is perhaps due to our experimental conditions or to substances which in vivo inhibit the action of the catecholamines on magnesium, such as insulin and/or glucose.", 
    "43": "We studied the contribution of L-type Ca2+ channels to action potential-evoked Ca2+ influx in dendritic spines of CA1 pyramidal neurons and the modulation of these channels by the beta2 adrenergic receptor. Backpropagating action potentials (bAPs) (three at 50 Hz) were evoked by brief somatic current injections, and Ca2+ transients were recorded in proximal basal dendrites and associated spines. The R- and T-type Ca2+ channel blocker NiCl2 (100 microm) significantly reduced Ca2+ transients in both spines and their parent dendrites (approximately 50%), suggesting that these channels are the major source of bAP-evoked Ca2+ influx in these structures. The L-type Ca2+ channel blockers nimodipine and nifedipine (both 10 microm) reduced spine Ca2+ transients by approximately 10%, whereas the L-type Ca2+ channel activators FPL 64176 (2,5-dimethyl-4-[2-(phenylmethyl)benzoyl]-1H-pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid methylester) and Bay K 8644 ((+/-)-1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-5-nitro-4-[2-(trifluoromethyl)-phenyl]-3-pyridine carboxylic acid methyl ester) (both 10 microm) significantly enhanced the spine Ca2+ transients by 40-50%. Activation of beta2 adrenergic receptors with salbutamol (40 microm) or formoterol (5 microm) resulted in significant enhancements of the spine (40-50%) but not dendritic Ca2+ transients. This increase was prevented when L-type Ca2+ channels were blocked with nimodipine (10 microm) or when cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) was inhibited with KT5720 (3 microm), Rp-cAMPS (Rp-adenosine cyclic 3',5'-phosphorothioate) (100 microm), or PKI (100 microm). The above data suggest that L-type Ca2+ channels are functionally present in dendritic spines of CA1 pyramidal neurons, contribute to spine Ca2+ influx, and can be modulated by the beta2 adrenergic receptor through PKA in a highly compartmentalized manner.",

Here, we demonstrate that low doses of NCXIF (10(-7)10(-8) M) induce strong inotropic effects in the guinea and rat ventricle strips, while having no detectable effects in the atria even at 10(-5) M. The inotropic effects of NCXIF are species-specific; the rat ventricle muscle is 20 to 50 times more sensitive to varying doses of NCXIF than the guinea pig. On the other hand the extent of maximal inotropic response is more prominent in the guinea pig model (up to 6-fold enhancement) than in the rat (up to 2-fold enhancement). The NCXIF accelerates the single-twitch relaxation (lusitropic effect) in dose-dependent manner, reaching approximately 2-fold shortening of twitch width at saturating doses. The dose-dependence curves of lusitropic and inotropic effects exhibit a reciprocal relationship, meaning that these two effects might share common mechanisms. To test a possible involvement of catecholamines, the effects of NCXIF were examined in the presence or absence of beta-adrenergic blocker, deralin. The saturating doses of deralin (1- 3 microM) do not alter either the NCXIF-induced acceleration of relaxation or twitch enhancement, meaning that the NCXIF effects cannot be mediated by occasional release of endogenous catecholamines. The capacity of NCXIF to modulate the ventricle contractility unconnectedly to the beta-adrenergic activation may provide new rational clues for future pharmacological interventions.",

(-)-[(125)I]-Iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) binding to intact calf lymphocytes was rapid, saturable (maximal number of binding sites 987 +/- 89 ICYP-binding sites/cell, n = 4) and of high affinity (K(D) value 17.23 +/- 2.8 pmol/l, n = 4). These binding sites were of the beta(2)-subtypes of adrenoceptors as indicated by the fact that beta-agonists inhibited ICYP binding with an order of potency: (-)-isoproterenol > (-)-adrenaline > (-)-noradrenaline. Furthermore, the selective beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118.551 was about >1,500 times more potent in inhibiting ICYP binding than was the beta(1)-selective adrenoceptor antagonist CGP 20712A. Consequently, calves were treated with clenbuterol (1.0 microg/kg b.i.d., i.v.) for 9 days alone or simultaneously with dexamethasone (0.1 mg/kg, i.v., once a day for 4 days). Clenbuterol decreased the number of lymphocyte beta(2)-adrenergic receptors by about 40-50% after only 48 h of drug administration. This was accompanied by a decrement in isoproterenol-induced lymphocyte cAMP formation. Upon application of both drugs, dexamethasone restored the clenbuterol-mediated decrease in beta(2)-adrenoceptors and cAMP production. Dexamethasone elevated the number of beta(2)-adrenoceptors and cAMP almost 1.5- to 2-fold at 24 h of drug administration, an effect that persisted for up to 24 h following drug withdrawal. Neither clenbuterol nor the combination with dexamethasone had an influence on the affinity of the receptor for the ligand. The present results demonstrate that dexamethasone in vivo upregulates the number and function of calf lymphocyte beta(2)-adrenoceptors, and thus enhances the sensitivity of the beta(2)-adrenoceptor signal-transduction pathway for clenbuterol during concomitant treatment with both drugs.",

Although altered betaAR signaling plays a pivotal role in the genesis of HF, the choice to therapeutically agonize or antagonize this receptor pathway remains an area of ongoing investigation. Research from the authors' laboratory as well as other research conducted over the last 10 years has produced evidence to support the fact that \"normalizing\" the betaAR system at a molecular level and improving signaling, instead of blocking it, leads to significant enhancement of cardiac contractile function and prevents ventricular remodeling in HF. This review summarizes the extensive in vivo animal model experimentation that supports the still-controversial hypothesis that increasing the myocardial density of beta(2)-ARs or, more effectively, inhibiting the activity of the betaAR kinase (also referred to as G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2), represent potential novel therapeutic strategies for HF.",

Although 30-day mortality was sixfold higher for patients with HF (18.9% vs. 3.1%, P < 0.0001), these patients were less likely to undergo angiography (30% vs. 40%, P < 0.0001) and revascularisation (19% vs. 25%, P , 0.0001), than patients without HF. Likewise, angiotensin-inhibitors and beta-blockers were not optimally utilised in patients with HF following MI.",

    "99": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia. Congestive heart failure (CHF), an increasingly frequent cardiovascular disorder affecting millions of people world-wide, has become the most important risk factor of AF in developed countries, as a result of ageing populations. Approximately two thirds of patients with CHF are >65 years of age and likely to have AF as a coexistent complication. Epidemiological surveys and large clinical trials in CHF provide strong evidence that AF is a marker of increased mortality. AF may compromise LV systolic function and worsen CHF through poor rate control, irregularity of ventricular response, and loss of atrial systolic activity. Furthermore, enhanced adrenergic stimulation in the setting of CHF facilitates AV conduction and promotes the progression of cardiomyopathy, and AF may worsen CHF as a consequence of the negative inotropic effects of drugs used to control the heart rate of rhythm, or of the proarrhythmic effects of drugs used to maintain sinus rhythm. This article reviews the putative mechanisms behind atrial remodelling due to long-standing AF, and the role of neuro-hormonal alterations in the atrial electrophysiologic and structural changes which facilitate its perpetuation. It also reviews and discusses various controlled trials of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and AT-1 receptor blockade in the perspective of AF treatment and prevention. Finally the role of specific antiarrhythmic drugs, the respective advantages and shortcomings of rate versus rhythm control in patients with AF and CHF, and the important issue of chronic anticoagulation are presented in the light of time-tested therapies, as well as new promising therapeutic approaches.",

There are two roles for MTC: one is to strengthen inference concerning the relative efficacy of two treatments, by including both 'direct' and 'indirect' comparisons. The other is to facilitate simultaneous inference regarding all treatments, in order for example to select the best treatment. In this paper, we present a range of Bayesian hierarchical models using the Markov chain Monte Carlo software WinBUGS. These are multivariate random effects models that allow for variation in true treatment effects across trials. We consider models where the between-trials variance is homogeneous across treatment comparisons as well as heterogeneous variance models. We also compare models with fixed (unconstrained) baseline study effects with models with random baselines drawn from a common distribution. These models are applied to an illustrative data set and posterior parameter distributions are compared. We discuss model critique and model selection, illustrating the role of Bayesian deviance analysis, and node-based model criticism. The assumptions underlying the MTC models and their parameterization are also discussed.", 
    "103": "Florida red tide brevetoxins are sodium channel neurotoxins produced by the dinoflagellate Karenia brevis. When aerosolized, the toxin causes airway symptoms in normal individuals and patients with airway disease, but systematic exposures to define the pulmonary consequences and putative mechanisms are lacking. Here we report the effects of airway challenges with lysed cultures of Karenia brevis (crude brevetoxin), pure brevetoxin-2, brevetoxin-3, and brevetoxin-tbm (brevetoxin-2 minus the side chain) on pulmonary resistance and tracheal mucus velocity, a marker of mucociliary clearance, in allergic and nonallergic sheep. Picogram concentrations of toxin caused bronchoconstriction in both groups of sheep. Brevetoxin-tbm was the least potent, indicating the importance of the side chain for maximum effect. Both histamine H(1)- and cholinergic-mediated pathways contributed to the bronchoconstriction. A synthetic antagonist, beta-naphthoyl-brevetoxin-3, and brevenal, a natural antagonist, inhibited the bronchoconstriction. Only crude brevetoxin and brevetoxin-3 decreased tracheal mucus velocity; both antagonists prevented this. More importantly, picomolar concentrations of the antagonists alone improved tracheal mucus velocity to the degree seen with mM concentrations of the sodium channel blocker amiloride. Thus, Karenia brevis, in addition to producing toxins that adversely affect the airways, may be a source of agents for treating mucociliary dysfunction.",

The 5-HT1A receptor gene is repressed by NUDR/DEAF-1 in raphe cells at the C-, but not at the G-allele of the C(-1019)G polymorphism that is associated with major depression and suicide. Depressed patients (n=118) were treated with antidepressants including fluoxetine or nefadozone combined with pindolol or flibanserin alone. The severity of depression was assesssed using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Although patients had similar severity initially, those with the homozygous G(-1019) genotype responded significantly less to flibanserin (p=0.039) and in pooled antidepressant treatment groups (p=0.0497) and were approximately twice as likely to be non-responders as those with the C(-1019)C genotype. These results implicate the C(-1019)G 5-HT1A gene polymorphism as a potential marker for antidepressant response, suggesting a role for repression of the 5-HT1A gene.",

The addition of isosorbide-5-mononitrate may enhance portal pressure reduction in patients receiving propranolol. Carvedilol is a nonselective beta-blocker with alpha(1)-adrenergic blocking activity. It has been shown to decrease portal pressure in cirrhotic patients. Additionally, carvedilol has a greater portal hypotensive effect than propranolol alone in patients with cirrhosis.

    "109": "A 30-year-old woman with atrial flutter after surgical correction of tetralogy of Fallot, underwent gynecological procedure under general anesthesia. Because she had been noted to have atrial flutter and heart failure at 8 weeks' gestation, she was scheduled for dilatation and curettage. Chest X-ray film showed cardiomegaly and pulmonary congestive changes. ECG showed atrial flutter with 3:2 atrio-ventricular conduction rate and complete right branch block. She was anesthetized with propofol infused with target-controlled infusion system, fentanyl and 66% of nitrous oxide under close monitoring and appropriate respiratory management. The quantity of hemorrhage was about 850 ml, and hypovolemia was treated with volume infusion and the use of vasoactive drugs. Soon after emergence from anesthesia, atrial flutter with 1:1 A-V conduction (> 230 bpm) occurred suddenly. Esmolol hydrochloride, 30 mg, was administered. Despite the relatively low doses, rapid control of heart rate was possible in a few minutes and the atrial flutter returned to 2:1 conduction. Although atrial flutter had continued until the discharge, tachyarrhythmia was no longer observed and the heart resumed sinus rhythm 3 month after the operation. The present case suggests that esmolol can be used effectively and safely for controling atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response in a patient after surgical correction of tetralogy of Fallot.", 
    "110": "Functional involvement of beta3-adrenoceptors in controlling human gastrointestinal motility has not been unequivocally assessed yet. The direct myogenic contribution of these receptors was examined, by in vitro functional studies and analysis of mRNA expression, on smooth muscle cells separately isolated from taenia coli and circular muscle layers of the human colon. Isoproterenol, a nonselective beta-adrenoceptor agonist, relaxed, in a concentration-dependent manner, both human taenia coli and circular colonic smooth muscle cells, although displaying a higher intrinsic activity (65.3 +/- 2.3 vs. 55.2 +/- 1.4% maximal relaxation) and potency (pEC50: 7.41 +/- 0.07 vs. 6.32 +/- 0.08) were greater on taenia coli than circular cells. In the presence of the beta1-antagonist CGP20712A and of the beta2-antagonist ICI 118,551, a 25-30% decrease in isoproterenol intrinsic activity was observed on both cell types and on taenia coli, the nonselective beta1/beta2-antagonist propranolol produced a rightward shift of the isoproterenol concentration-response curve with mean estimated pKB values (8.12 +/- 0.27 at 0.1 microM and 6.45 +/- 0.13 at 1 microM) lower than that expected for both beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors. CGP12177A and SR 58611A, two beta3-adrenoceptor agonists, presented an intrinsic activity comparable to that of isoproterenol in the presence of beta1- and beta2-antagonists, the former being more potent on taenia coli than on circular smooth muscle cells. Beta3-adrenoceptor mRNA was detected by reverse transcription PCR on both cell types. These results strongly suggest a direct functional role of beta3-adrenoceptors in the human colon.", 
    "111": "Catecholamines induce apoptosis in various lymphoid populations. This process can occur with both alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptors. Heavy exercise increases plasma catecholamine concentrations, and is also a cause of lymphocyte apoptosis, a possible explanation for postexercise lymphocytopenia. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of adrenoreceptor antagonism on exercise-induced decreases and apoptosis of intestinal lymphocytes. Mice received an intraperitoneal injection of phentolamine (a nonselective alpha-blocker), nadolol (a nonselective beta-blocker), or saline (vehicle) prior to an exhaustive bout of exercise. Total intestinal lymphocyte numbers, percent and number of CD3+ lymphocytes, and cell viability were assessed. Neither alpha- nor beta-antagonism prevented exercise-induced cell loss in the intestine; however, pretreatment with nadolol significantly reduced the number of apoptotic and necrotic cells. Phentolamine administration appeared to increase the incidence of cell death among intestinal lymphocytes. Both drugs decreased the percentage of CD3+ intestinal lymphocytes. Our study suggests that catecholamines are not responsible for postexercise lymphocytopenia, but beta-adrenoceptor blockade may confer protection against exercise-induced apoptosis of intestinal lymphocytes.",

    "113": "Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep deprivation induces a cortical down-regulation of beta-adrenergic receptors. Down-regulation of cortical beta-adrenergic receptors is consistently observed after a number of different chronic antidepressant treatments (drugs and electroconvulsive shock). REM sleep deprivation has an antidepressant effect in humans, and in rats, it decreases immobility in the behavioral despair test, an effect also produced by antidepressant treatments. To verify whether REM sleep deprivation also affects hippocampal beta-adrenergic receptors, we carried out the binding of [3H]-dihydroalprenolol ([3H]-DHA) to hippocampal membranes from rats deprived of REM sleep for 96 h. We also determined the binding of [3H]-DHA to brainstem membranes, a brain region where noradrenergic nuclei are located. Rats were deprived of REM sleep using a water tank with multiple small platforms. [3H-DHA] saturation conditions (concentrations ranging from 0.15 to 6 nM) were obtained in a crude hippocampus and brainstem membrane preparation. Nonspecific binding was determined using DL-propranolol in hippocampus homogenates. In the brainstem homogenates, nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of DL-propranolol or L-isoproterenol. The results obtained showed statistically significant down-regulation of beta-adrenergic receptors in both the hippocampus and the brainstem after REM sleep deprivation. In the hippocampus, there was also a significant decrease in the dissociation constant (KD). In the brainstem, a significant decrease in KD was observed when DL-propranolol was used to determine nonspecific binding. The down-regulation of beta-adrenergic receptors in the hippocampus and brainstem suggests the involvement of these brain areas in the antidepressant effect of REM sleep deprivation.", 
    "114": "BACKGROUND: In many studies investigating measures to attenuate the hemodynamic and humoral stress response during induction of anaesthesia, primary attention was paid to the period of endotracheal intubation since it has been shown that even short-lasting sympathetic cardiovascular stimulation may have detrimental effects on patients with coronary artery disease. The aim of this analysis was, however, to identify the influencing factors on high catecholamine levels before induction of anaesthesia. METHODS: Various potential risk factors that could impact the humoral stress response before induction of anaesthesia were recorded in 84 males undergoing coronary aortic bypass surgery, and were entered into a stepwise linear regression analysis. The plasma level of norepinephrine measured immediately after radial artery canulation was chosen as a surrogate marker for the humoral stress response, and it was used as the dependent variable in the regression model. Accordingly, the mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate and the calculated pressure-rate product were taken as parameters of the hemodynamic situation. RESULTS: Stepwise regression analysis revealed that the oral administration of low-dose clonidine (mean dose 1.75 \u03bcg.kg-1) on the morning of surgery was the only significant predictor (p = 0.004) of the high variation in preoperative norepinephrine plasma levels. This intervention decreased norepinephrine levels by more than 40% compared to no clonidine administration, from 1.26 to 0.75 nmol.l-1. There was no evidence for dose-responsiveness of clonidine. All other potential predictors were removed from the model as insignificant (p > 0.05). The use of beta-blocker, ace-inhibitors, ejection fraction, and body mass index were significant determinants for the hemodynamic situation (heart rate, mean arterial pressure, pressure rate product) of the patient during the pre-induction period. CONCLUSION: The oral administration of clonidine is the only significant predictor for the observed variation of norepinephrine levels during the preoperative period. Lack of significant dose responsiveness suggests that even a low dose of the drug can attenuate the preoperative stress response and thus is recommended in cardiovascular high risk patients.",

Recoveries obtained from spiked HPLC water, as well as, from spiked real samples (sewage treatment plants influent and effluents, river and tap water) were all above 60%, with the exception of betaxolol with a 52% recovery. The quantitative MS analysis was performed using a multiple reaction monitoring. The LC-MS-MS method gave detection limits ranging from 0.017 to 1.25 microg/l in spiked effluent. Precision of the method, calculated as relative standard deviation, ranged from 3.7 to 18.5%. Individual and combined effects on Daphnia magna were evaluated for both therapeutic groups. Individual effects in culture medium showed these compounds as not harmful and not toxic, an exception is fenofibrate that was found to be harmful, but at high, in the environment unrealistic concentrations (EC50 of 50 mg/l). Combined effect in wastewater showed synergistic toxic effects at low concentration level (2 microg/l).",

The results obtained agree with those of previous, similar studies of the same equilibria in which the protein was immobilized on silica particles, packed in a chromatographic column. The association constant and the complexation enthalpy and entropy of the (S)-enantiomer increase with increasing pH. For (R)-alprenolol, the binding is endothermic at all pH values. Thus, for both enantiomers in the pH range 5.5-6.8, the binding is an entropically driven process.",

We have developed and validated an RP-HPLC assay method for direct determination of R-(+)- and S-(-)-propranolol glucuronide in rat hepatic microsomes to investigate the enantioselectivity of propranolol glucuronidation metabolism. A baseline separation of propranolol glucuronide enantiomers was achieved on a 5 microm reversed-phase ODS column, with a mixture of phosphate buffer (pH 3.5, 0.067 mol/L) and methanol (55:45, v/v) as mobile phase. Ultraviolet detection was set at 220 nm, and p-nitrobenzoic acid was used as internal standard. The standard curve of assay for R-(+)- and S-(-)-propranolol glucuronide in spiked microsomal incubate showed good linearity throughout the concentration range from 0.50 to 20.0 micromol/L. The analytical method affords average recovery of 99.8 and 100.1% for R-(+)- and S-(-)-propranolol glucuronide, respectively. The method provides a high sensitivity and good precision for R-(+)- and S-(-)-propranolol glucuronide (RSD < 10%). The LOD was 0.15 micromol/L and the LOQ was 0.5 micromol/L (RSD < 8%, n = 5) for both R-(+)- and S-(-)-propranolol glucuronide. The method is simple, precise and accurate, and is suitable for quantifying the propranolol glucuronides enantiomers in rat hepatic microsomes.", 
    "122": "The lateral part of the ventral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (vlBNST) is a critical site for the antiaversive effects of noradrenergic drugs during opioid withdrawal. The objective of the present study is to identify the cellular action(s) of noradrenaline in the vlBNST after withdrawal from a 5d treatment with morphine. The vlBNST is a heterogeneous cell group with multiple efferent projections. Therefore, neurons projecting to the midbrain were identified by retrograde transport of fluorescent microspheres injected in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Whole-cell voltage clamp recordings of these neurons and of those sharing physiological properties were done in brain slices. Noradrenaline activated alpha1-adrenergic receptors to increase GABA(A)-IPSC frequency. Noradrenaline produced a similar increase in GABA(A)-IPSCs during acute opioid withdrawal, but this increase resulted from activation of beta-adrenergic receptors, adenylyl cyclase, and protein kinase A, as well as alpha1-adrenergic receptors. Given that neurons in the vlBNST send an excitatory projection to the VTA, noradrenaline may reduce excitatory drive to mesolimbic dopamine cells. This mechanism might contribute to the withdrawal-induced inhibition of dopamine neurons and explain how noradrenergic drugs microinjected into the vlBNST reduce aversive aspects of opioid withdrawal.", 
    "123": "The immunomodulatory cytokine interferon-beta (IFN-beta) is used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis. However, the effect of IFN-beta on neuronal functions is currently unknown. Intracellular recordings were conducted on somatosensory neurons of neocortical layers 2/3 and 5 exposed to IFN-beta. The excitability of neurons was increased by IFN-beta (10-10,000 U/ml) in two kinetically distinct, putatively independent manners. First IFN-beta reversibly influenced the subthreshold membrane response by raising the membrane resistance R(M) 2.5-fold and the membrane time constant tau 1.7-fold dose-dependently. The effect required permanent exposure to IFN-beta and was reduced in magnitude if the extracellular K+ was lowered. However, the membrane response to IFN-beta in the subthreshold range was prevented by ZD7288 (a specific blocker of I(h)) but not by Ni2+, carbachol, or bicuculline, pointing to a dependence on an intact I(h). Second, IFN-beta enhanced the rate of action potential firing. This effect was observed to develop for >1 h when the cell was exposed to IFN-beta for 5 min or >5 min and showed no reversibility (< or =210 min). Current-discharge (F-I) curves revealed a shift (prevented by bicuculline) as well as an increase in slope (prevented by carbachol and Ni2+). Layer specificity was not observed with any of the described effects. In conclusion, IFN-beta influences the neuronal excitability in neocortical pyramidal neurons in vitro, especially under conditions of slightly increased extracellular K+. Our blocker experiments indicate that changes in various ionic conductances with different voltage dependencies cause different IFN-beta influences on sub- and suprathreshold behavior, suggesting a more general intracellular process induced by IFN-beta.",

In 21 patients, esmolol (aim: heart rate <70 bpm) plus enoximone (initial bolus of 0.5 mg/kg followed by a continuous infusion of 2.5 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1)) was started after induction of anesthesia and continued until the morning of the first postoperative day; another 21 patients received saline solution as placebo. Hemodynamics, splanchnic perfusion (gastric-arterial CO(2) gap), liver function (glutathione transferase-alpha plasma levels), renal function (creatinine clearance, urine concentrations of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase), myocardial ischemia (creatine-kinase MB and troponin T plasma levels), inflammation (elastase, interleukin-6 and -8 plasma levels), and endothelial integrity (adhesion molecules plasma levels) were assessed at baseline, before and after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), and in the intensive care unit until the first postoperative day. Catecholamine requirements were significantly less in the treated than in the nontreated patients. Heart rate was significantly slower, cardiac index was higher, and gastric-arterial CO(2) gap was significantly lower in the treatment group. Troponin T, beta-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase, glutathione transferase-alpha, and soluble adhesion molecules increased significantly in the untreated control, but remained almost normal in the esmolol+enoximone patients. Inflammatory responses (elastase/interleukins) were attenuated by esmolol+enoximone. We conclude that, in comparison to an untreated control, the prophylactic use of a combination of esmolol and enoximone in elderly patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass resulted in overall beneficial effects on postbypass hemodynamic status, organ function, inflammatory response, and endothelial integrity.",

Expression of ANP and BNP mRNA has not been studied in isolated adult mouse cardiac myocytes (AMCM). We examined expression of ANP and BNP mRNA in isolated AMCM with and without stimulation with beta-adrenergic receptor agonists and antagonists. AMCM were isolated and maintained in culture for 24-48 h with and without stimulation with the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol (Iso), the beta1-antagonist CGP20712A (CGP), or the beta2-antagonist ICI-118,551 (ICI). Northern blot analysis was performed using probes for mouse ANP and BNP mRNA. TUNEL assay was performed after beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation of AMCM. BNP mRNA expression was increased fivefold (P < 0.001) after 48 h in culture without adrenergic stimulation. BNP mRNA expression was reduced (P < 0.0001) after stimulation with Iso while ANP expression remained similar to unstimulated cells. CGP prevented the Iso reduction in BNP mRNA. Iso stimulation at doses that reduced BNP mRNA expression increased TUNEL positive nuclei, an effect blocked by the beta1-antagonist CGP. In conclusion, we have demonstrated differential gene expression of ANP and BNP in AMCM in culture. Expression of BNP mRNA increases in AMCM in culture and beta1-adrenergic receptor stimulation attenuates increased BNP gene expression and results in apoptosis.",

Our previous study has shown that IL-1 can induce mast cells to produce proinflammatory cytokines which are involved in atherogenesis. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of epinephrine on IL-1-induced proatherogenic cytokine production from mast cells.",

HMC-1 cultured alone produced none to trace amounts of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-13. IL-1 beta significantly induced production of these cytokines in HMC-1, while epinephrine alone did not. However, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-13 production induced by IL-1 beta were significantly enhanced by addition of epinephrine. The enhancing effect appears to involve NF-kappa B and p38 MAPK pathways. Flow cytometry showed the presence of beta1 and beta2 adrenoreceptors on resting mast cells. The enhancing effect of proatherogenic cytokine production by epinephrine was down regulated by the beta1 and beta2 adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol, but not by the beta1 adrenoceptor antagonist, atenolol, suggesting the effect involved beta2 adrenoceptors. The enhancing effect of epinephrine on proatherogenic cytokine production was also down regulated by the immunosuppressive drug, dexamethasone.", 
    "137": "These results not only confirm that an acute phase cytokine, IL-1 beta, regulates mast cell function, but also show that epinephrine up regulates the IL-1 beta induction of proatherogenic cytokines in mast cells.

    "138": "Myopathy is frequently associated with thyrotoxicosis. Skeletal muscles are predominantly involved in thyrotoxic myopathy, but dysphagia is extremely rare. We report three cases of thyrotoxicosis with dysphagia and review of the literature of the past 30 years. Most of these patients had antecedent muscle weakness before the onset of dysphagia although some suffered from a sudden onset of bulbar palsy. Either a myopathic or neuropathic pattern was found on electromyography. The incidence of oropharyngeal dysphagia was higher than that of esophageal motility dysfunction. Aspiration pneumonia occurred more accompanied by oropharyngeal dysphagia. The swallowing disorder could be resolved completely within 3 weeks after treatment for thyrotoxicosis. In light of these clinical experiences, early intensive treatment that includes antithyroid agent, beta-blocker, and Lugol solution may be necessary.", 
    "139": "Beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) antagonists have been associated with increased airway reactivity in asthmatics and potentiation of contractile stimuli in animal models. In the present study, using an in vitro model of tracheal preparations from guinea pigs, we show that the beta-AR antagonists propranolol and pindolol induce a smooth muscle contraction. A prerequisite for this contraction is that the airway preparations have been pre-treated with an beta-AR agonist. Our data show that the contractile effect of beta-AR antagonists is not a simple consequence of reversing the agonist-induced relaxation. Furthermore, the effect seems to be mediated through interaction with beta2-ARs since the response is stereo-selective, and the selective beta1-AR receptor antagonist atenolol did not induce any contractile response. SQ 29,546, a thromboxane A2 antagonist; MK 886, a lipoxygenase inhibitor; and indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor significantly inhibited the contractions of the tracheal preparations induced with propranolol or pindolol. We put forward the hypothesis that the contractile effect of the beta-AR antagonist is a consequence of their inverse agonist activity, which is only evident when the receptor population have a higher basal activity. Our results indicate a novel additional explanation for the known side effect, bronchoconstriction, of beta-AR antagonist.",

The objectives of this prespecified analysis were to compare antihypertensive treatment strategies in the diabetes cohort (verapamil SR-based [n=3169] versus atenolol-based [n=3231]) and identify predictors for the primary outcome (a composite of first occurrence of all-cause death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke). During a mean follow-up of 2.7 years, 913 participants with diabetes experienced a primary outcome event, with no significant difference between treatment strategies (14.6%, verapamil SR versus 13.9%; atenolol hazard ratio, 1.05; 95% confidence interval, 0.92 to 1.19). Risk for the primary outcome increased with presence of baseline heart failure, renal impairment, US residency, age, previous stroke/transient ischemic attack, previous myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease, or smoking. High systolic and diastolic pressures during follow-up also were associated with increased risk, as were low diastolic pressures. Antihypertensive treatment with a verapamil SR or atenolol strategy resulted in similar rates of cardiovascular outcomes in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients with diabetes. Thus, a verapamil SR-based antihypertensive treatment strategy is an alternative to a beta-blocker-based strategy in adults with CAD and diabetes.",

Values of NT-proBNP were markedly increased despite the requirement that patients be euvolemic before the start of treatment (mean+/-SD, 3235+/-4392 pg/mL; median, 1767 pg/mL). By univariate Cox regression analysis, NT-proBNP was found to be a powerful predictor of subsequent all-cause mortality (relative risk [RR], 2.7; 95% CI, 1.7 to 4.3; P=0.0001 for above versus below median) and all-cause mortality or hospitalization for heart failure (RR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.8 to 3.4; P=0.0001 for above versus below median). The predictive value of NT-proBNP was similar when both placebo and carvedilol patients were analyzed separately.

    "144": "The effects of acute exercise on the protein expressions of heterotrimeric G protein alpha subunits were examined in rat adipocytes. Galphai2 protein expression was significantly reduced 0 and 3h after exercise but increased 24h after exercise, without alterations in Galphai2 mRNA expressions. The protein expressions of other alpha subunits, Galphas, Galphai1, and Galphai3, were not influenced. Both the 26S proteasome activity and polyubiquitination of Galphai2 protein were significantly increased 0 and 3h after exercise. Whereas, proteasome activity was decreased, and the polyubiquitination of Galphai2 protein was returned to the control level 24h after exercise. The reductions in Galphai2 protein expressions 0 and 3h after exercise were completely prevented by the injection either of a proteasome inhibitor or of a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker prior to exercise. Thus, acute exercise altered the expression of Galphai2 protein via mechanisms which involve the coupling of beta-adrenergic receptors to an agonist with subsequent ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent proteolysis.", 
    "145": "The clinical use of doxorubicin, a highly active anticancer drug, is limited by its severe cardiotoxic side effects. Increased oxidative stress and apoptosis have been implicated in the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin. Carvedilol is an adrenergic blocking agent with potent anti-oxidant activity. In this study we investigated whether carvedilol has protective effects against doxorubicin-induced free radical production and apoptosis in cultured cardiac muscle cells, and we compared the effects of carvedilol to atenolol, a beta-blocker with no anti-oxidant activity. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in cultured cardiac muscle cells (H9c2 cells) was evaluated by flow cytometry using dichlorofluorescein (DCF) and hydroethidine (HE). Apoptosis was assessed by measuring annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide double staining, DNA laddering, levels of expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax-alpha and the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, and caspase-3 activity. Pre-treatment with carvedilol significantly attenuated the doxorubicin-induced increases in DCF (P < 0.001 compared to cells not pre-treated with carvedilol) and HE (P < 0.01) fluorescence. Doxorubicin increased the fraction of annexin V-FITC-positive fluorescent cells, while pre-treatment with carvedilol reduced the number of positive fluorescent cells (P < 0.01). Doxorubicin-induced DNA fragmentation to a clear ladder pattern, while carvedilol prevented DNA fragmentation. Doxorubicin-induced a fall in mRNA expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and an increase in the expression of the pro-apoptotic Bax-alpha. Carvedilol pre-treatment blunted both the decrease of Bcl-2 (P < 0.01) and the increase of Bax-alpha mRNA expression (P < 0.01). Caspase-3 activity significantly increased after the addition of doxorubicin. Concurrently, carvedilol partially inhibited the doxorubicin-induced activation of caspase-3 (P < 0.01). Atenolol did not produce any effect in preventing doxorubicin-induced ROS generation and cardiac apoptosis. Our results suggest that carvedilol is potentially protective against doxorubicin cardiotoxicity by decreasing free radical release and apoptosis in cardiomyocytes.",

    "150": "Carvedilol is a useful cardiovascular drug for treating heart failure, however, the in vitro effect on many cell types is unclear. In human MG63 osteosarcoma cells, the effect of carvedilol on intracellular Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i) and cytotoxicity was explored by using fura-2 and tetrazolium, respectively. Carvedilol at concentrations greater than 1 microM caused a rapid rise in [Ca2+]i in a concentration-dependent manner (EC50=15 microM). Carvedilol-induced [Ca2+]i rise was reduced by 60% by removal of extracellular Ca2+. Carvedilol-induced Mn2+-associated quench of intracellular fura-2 fluorescence also suggests that carvedilol induced extracellular Ca2+ influx. In Ca2+-free medium, thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, caused a monophasic [Ca2+]i rise, after which the increasing effect of carvedilol on [Ca2+]i was inhibited by 50%. Conversely, pretreatment with carvedilol to deplete intracellular Ca2+ stores totally prevented thapsigargin from releasing more Ca2+. U73122, an inhibitor of phospholipase C, abolished histamine (an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent Ca2+ mobilizer)-induced, but not carvedilol-induced, [Ca2+]i rise. Pretreatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and forskolin to activate protein kinase C and adenylate cyclase, respectively, did not alter carvedilol-induced [Ca2+]i rise. Separately, overnight treatment with 0.1-30 microM carvedilol inhibited cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner. These findings suggest that in human MG63 osteosarcoma cells, carvedilol increases [Ca2+]i by stimulating extracellular Ca2+ influx and also by causing intracellular Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum and other stores via a phospholipase C-independent manner. Carvedilol may be cytotoxic to osteoblasts.", 
    "151": "A number of newer antianginal agents, including nicorandil, trimetazidine, and ivabradine, have been synthesized in recent years, but ranolazine, a piperazine derivative that partially inhibits fatty acid oxidation and the late INa current in animal models, is of particular interest mechanistically. Earlier clinical trials with immediate-release ranolazine led to the current sustained-release version tested in the Monotherapy Assessment of Ranolazine In Stable Angina (MARISA) (n = 193) and Combination Assessment of Ranolazine In Stable Angina (CARISA) trials (n = 823) of patients with chronic angina and severe limitation of exercise capacity (ie, < 5 metabolic equivalents). MARISA was a placebo-controlled, randomized trial that compared ranolazine monotherapy (500 mg, 1000 mg, and 1500 mg, twice daily) to placebo. CARISA was a placebo-controlled trial that randomized patients on background beta-blocker or calcium antagonist therapy to placebo or ranolazine (750 mg or 1000 mg, twice daily). Both studies showed a significant increase in total exercise duration, time to angina onset, and time to 1 mm ST segment depression. The average magnitude of increase in exercise duration over placebo was 29 to 56 seconds at peak and 24 to 46 seconds at trough with the 3 doses tested in MARISA, and 24 to 34 seconds greater than placebo with the 2 doses used in CARISA. The beneficial effect was achieved without clinically important changes in rest or exercise heart rate or blood pressure. Weekly angina attack frequency and nitroglycerin usage were significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner in the 12-week CARISA trial. Reported adverse effects were similar in MARISA and CARISA and consisted of asthenia, nausea, constipation, and dizziness. Syncope, reported in 8 patients at doses of 1000 mg twice daily or more may be related to attenuation of alpha-1 receptor activity. The mean QTc interval increased with dose and was less than 10 msec on ranolazine at 1000 mg twice daily. The mortality rates at 1 and 2 years in MARISA and CARISA open-label run-on studies were 2% and less than 5%, acceptable for this high-risk population with limited exercise capacity. In conclusion, clinical trial evidence with ranolazine to date is consistent with its proposed mechanism of action and demonstrates an effective antianginal profile that may benefit patients with severe chronic angina.",

The chicken beta-globin 5' HS4 (cHS4) insulator acted as a positional enhancer blocker, inhibiting promoter remodeling and transcription activation only when placed between the enhancer and gene. Enhancer blocking by cHS4 reduced histone hyperacetylation across a zone extending from the enhancer to the gene and inhibited recruitment of CBP and p300 to HS2. Enhancer blocking also led to accumulation of RNA polymerase II at HS2 and within cHS4, accompanied by its diminution at the gene promoter. The enhancer blocking effects were completely attributable to the CTCF binding site in cHS4. These findings provide experimental evidence for the involvement of spreading in establishment of a broad zone of histone modification by an enhancer, as well as for blocking by an insulator of the transfer of RNA polymerase II from an enhancer to a promoter.",

Here, we report that beta-adrenoceptor activation in the hippocampus and the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) is implicated in the impairing effects of glucocorticoids on memory retrieval. The specific glucocorticoid receptor (GR) agonist 11beta,17beta-dihydroxy-6,21-dimethyl-17alpha-pregna-4,6-trien-20yn-3-one (RU 28362) (15 ng) infused into the hippocampus of male Sprague Dawley rats 60 min before water maze retention testing, 24 hr after training, impaired probe trial retention performance, as assessed by quadrant search time and initial latency to cross the platform location. Because we found previously that RU 28362 infused into the hippocampus does not affect water maze acquisition or immediate recall, the findings suggest that the GR agonist-induced retention impairment was attributable to a selective influence on long-term memory retrieval. Likewise, systemic injections of the beta1-adrenoceptor partial agonist xamoterol (3.0 or 10.0 mg/kg, s.c.) 60 min before the probe trial dose-dependently impaired retention performance. The beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (2.0 mg/kg) administered subcutaneously before retention testing did not affect retention performance alone, but blocked the memory retrieval impairment induced by concurrent intrahippocampal infusions of RU 28362. Pretest infusions of the beta1-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol into either the hippocampus (1.25 microg in 0.5 microl) or the BLA (0.5 microg in 0.2 microl) also prevented the GR agonist-induced memory retrieval impairment. These findings suggest that glucocorticoids impair retrieval of long-term spatial memory by facilitating noradrenergic mechanisms in the hippocampus, and additionally, that norepinephrine-mediated BLA activity is critical in enabling hippocampal glucocorticoid effects on memory retrieval.",

A study of the effectiveness of comanagement in 197 hypertensive patients with physician-pharmacist collaboration using an evidence-based, systematic approach showed that a significantly larger number of patients in the study group achieved BP control than in the control group.", 
    "178": "The expanded role of clinical pharmacists in programs for evaluating, monitoring, and treating patients with hypertension can result in improved adherence to therapy and established guidelines. As members of interdisciplinary health care teams, pharmacists should utilize the JNC 7 guidelines and scientific evidence to consult with physicians about medications, design effective formularies, and collaborate with physicians in evaluating and comanaging patients with hypertension.", 
    "179": "To analyze the effect of bisoprolol in patients with stable congestive heart failure and who tolerated beta-blockers.", 
    "180": "Two hundred and one patients performed before and 3 months after maximal tolerated doses of bisoprolol have been reached, a clinical evaluation, an echocardiography, a radionuclide angiography, a cardiopulmonary exercise test and hormonal determinations.", 
    "181": "Mean dose of bisoprolol was 8.8 +/- 2.4 mg/d. Patients had a significant improvement in NYHA classification. Heart rate at rest decreased from 87 +/- 17 to 66 +/- 12 beats/min (P < 0.0001) without any effect on electrocardiographic parameters. Left ventricular ejection fraction improved from 31 +/- 11 to 41 +/- 13% (P < 0.0001), with a significant decrease in end-diastolic and end-systolic left ventricle diameters and volumes. Mitral profile improved. Peak VO2 increased from 16.1 +/- 5 to 16.8 +/- 5.5 ml/min/kg (P = 0.001) with a significant increase in O2 pulse (from 8.52 +/- 2.7 to 11.2 +/- 3.5 ml/min/beats, P < 0.0001). Plasma levels of A-type and of B-type natriuretic peptides and of norepinephrine significantly decreased after bisoprolol.", 
    "182": "Bisoprolol significantly improved left ventricle ejection fraction with a reverse remodeling of the left ventricle, a decrease in hormonal activation and a modest improvement in exercise capacity.", 
    "183": "Left main coronary artery dimensions were evaluated in patients with and without arterial hypertension, in the presence of coronary artery disease, and correlated to left ventricular mass.", 
    "184": "Intracoronary ultrasound was performed in 25 patients (pts) with coronary artery disease and hypertension (+HTN) and in 25 pts with coronary artery disease only (-HTN). Maximal left main dimensions and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) were measured. +HTN pts had greater LVMI compared to -HTN, (+HTN = 183 +/- 17 g/m2 vs. -HTN = 82 +/- 22 g/m2, p < 0.0001), while maximal left main vessel area was similar (25.99 +/- 5.01 mm2 vs. 25.62 +/- 3.3 mm2, p = 0.8). No correlation was found between LVMI and left main vessel area in + HTN.", 
    "185": "Pts with +HTN despite the increased LVMI do not manifest increased LM dimensions. This may affect mid-term clinical outcome.", 
    "186": "Bupropion is an increasingly prescribed agent to aid in smoking cessation. However it has important drug-drug interactions related to the cytochrome P450 system. One of these is its inhibition of the metabolism of the commonly used beta-blocker, metoprolol. The authors describe a case of severe bradycardia related to the addition of bupropion to the medical regimen of a patient on metoprolol."
