To identify causes of HAV, we compared 113 pre-HT donor and recipient variables, 28 peri-HT variables, and 46 post-HT variables between groups.

African-American patients had less HAV than Caucasians (p = 0.047). Patients with pre-HT mechanical circulatory assistance had less HAV than pharmacologically treated patients (p = 0.014). Multivariate analysis showed that recipient (p = 0.0004) and donor weight (p = 0.0394) and ischemia time (p = 0.0015) independently predicted HAV and correlated with HAV severity.

    "13": "Liver lesions and portal hypertension in rats, following chronic alcohol administration, are a particular target for therapy. Portal hypertension (mm Hg) assessed directly into the portal vein, and liver lesions induced by 7.28 g/kg b.w. of alcohol given in drinking water for 3 months, were counteracted by a stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157, GEPPPGKPADDAGLV, M.W. 1419, known to have a beneficial effect in a variety of models of gastrointestinal or liver lesions (10 microg or 10 ng/kg b.w. i.p. or i.g.) and propranolol (10 mg/kg b.w. i.g.), but not ranitidine (10 mg/kg b.w. i.g.) or saline (5 ml/kg b.w. i.p./i.g.; control). The medication (once daily) was throughout either the whole 3 months period (1) or the last month only (2) (last application 24 h before sacrifice). In the background of 7.28 g/kg/daily alcohol regimen similar lesions values were assessed in control rats following alcohol consumption, after 2 or 3 months of drinking. Both prophylactic and therapeutic effects were shown. After a period of 2 or 3 months, in all control saline [intragastrically (i.g.) or intraperitoneally (i.p.)] treated rats, the applied alcohol regimen consistently induced a significant rise of portal blood pressure values over values noted in healthy rats. In rats that received gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157 or propranolol the otherwise raised portal pressure was reduced to the values noted in healthy rats. Besides, a raised surface area (microm(2)) and increased circumference (microm) of hepatocyte or hepatocyte nucleus [HE staining, measured using PC-compatible program ISSA (VAMS, Zagreb, Croatia)] and an advanced steatosis [scored (0-4), Oil Red staining] (on 100 randomly assigned hepatocytes per each liver), an increased liver weight, all together parallel a raised portal pressure in controls. Some of them were completely eliminated (not different from healthy rats, i.e. portal pressure, the circumference and area of hepatocytes, liver weight), while others were markedly attenuated (values less than in drinking controls, still higher than in healthy rats, i.e. circumference and area of hepatocytes nucleus). On the other hand, ranitidine application attenuated only steatosis development. In summary, despite continuous chronic alcohol drinking, pentadecapeptide BPC 157, and propranolol may prevent portal hypertension as well as reverse already established portal hypertension along with related liver disturbances.", 
    "14": "Unlike severe gastric damage acutely induced by ethanol administration in rat, the ulcerogenic effect of chronic alcohol administration (3.03 g/kg b.w. or 7.28 g/kg b.w.) given in drinking water, producing liver lesions and portal hypertension, is far less investigated. Therefore, focus was on the antiulcer effect of the gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157, GEPPPGKPADDAGLV, M.W. 1419, known to have a beneficial effect in variety of gastrointestinal lesions models (10 microg or 10 ng/kg b.w. i.p. or i.g.), ranitidine (10 mg/kg b.w. i.g.) and propranol (10 mg/kg b.w. i.g.) or saline (5 ml/kg b.w. i.p./i.g.; control). They were given once daily (1) throughout 10 days preceding alcohol consumption, (2) since beginning of alcohol drinking till the end of the study, (3) throughout the last month of alcohol consumption, 2 months after alcohol drinking had been initiated. Gastric lesions were assessed, at the end of 3 months drinking [(1), (2)] or with respect to therapeutic effect of medication before medication or at the end of therapy. Pentadecapeptide BPC 157, ranitidine and propranolol may prevent gastric lesion development if given prophylactically, before alcohol drinking. Likewise, they attenuate the lesion appearance given once daily throughout the drinking period. Importantly, when given therapeutically, they may antagonize otherwise pertinent lesion presence in stomach mucosa of the drinking rats. Thus, these results demonstrate that pentadecapeptide BPC 157, ranitidine and propranol may prevent, attenuate or reverse the gastric lesions appearance in chronically alcohol drinking rats, and may be used for further therapy, while the other studies showed that their effect (except to ranitidine) is parallel with their beneficial effect on liver lesion and portal hypertension.", 
    "15": "SM-11044 is the only beta-adrenergic agonist that inhibits guinea pig eosinophil chemotaxis and induces relaxation of depolarized rat colon tonus. We have previously reported the purification of a 34 kDa photoaffinity-labeled SM-11044 binding protein (SMBP) from rat colon that may mediate the biological effects of the ligand and that differs from all known monoamine receptors (Sugasawa et al., J. Biol. Chem. 272 (1997) 21244). The present report describes partial amino acid sequence of rat SMBP and molecular cloning of corresponding human SMBP (hSMBP) cDNA. This cDNA encodes a 588 amino acid residue polypeptide comprising a signal peptide, a long hydrophilic amino-terminal region, and a highly hydrophobic C-terminal portion organized into nine putative transmembrane domains. The sequence and structure of hSMBP shows homology to members of a new transmembrane protein 9 superfamily (TM9SF). Comparison of hSMBP with related protein sequences from yeast, plant and human revealed two subgroups within TM9SF. The members of these groups differ in length and have characteristic amino acid sequence motifs in their amino-terminal portion. Northern blot analysis revealed two major SMBP mRNAs, at 3.4 and 3.8 kb, that were present in all the human tissues examined. Western blot experiments detected SMBP as a 70 kDa protein that may be further cleaved into an active 34 kDa N-terminal polypeptide. Stable Chinese Hamster Ovary cell transfectants expressing hSMBP cDNA displayed specific binding of [(125)I]iodocyanopindolol that was displaced by SM-11044 in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, SMBP is the first member of TM9SF with functional ligand binding properties, suggesting that some of these integral membrane proteins may function as channels, small molecule transporters or receptors.",

Timolol treatment diminished resistance significantly in the glaucoma group, but not in the ocular hypertension group. Thus the two groups responded differently to timolol treatment. The reaction to IOP lowering treatment could indicate defective autoregulation in the glaucoma group.",

    "26": "Lithium is a monovalent cation used therapeutically to treat a range of affective disorders (1), although the cellular mechanisms of lithium regulation that might contribute to its therapeutic effects at the level of neurotransmitter receptors are not known. Herein we report the ability of lithium to stimulate the internalization of beta2-adrenergic receptors. Lithium treatment of A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells resulted in a rapid, prominent desensitization and internalization of beta2-adrenergic receptors. The ability of these receptors to generate a cyclic AMP response was strongly inhibited by lithium, at concentrations therapeutic in humans. Receptors for the serotonin (5HT1c) and for opiates (mu-opioid), in sharp contrast, resisted the effects of lithium on internalization. These data provide the first receptor-based mechanism to be described for lithium that could explain, in part, the therapeutic effects of lithium on affective disorders.", 
    "27": "The unique findings from the HOPE (Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation) study strongly support extending the use of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ramipril as a preventive agent for patients at high risk of cardiovascular events with normal left ventricular function. In addition, ramipril provides significant benefit in diabetic patients. These findings will impact on how ramipril is used in primary care, where ACE inhibitors are currently underprescribed. Patients reflecting the inclusion criteria of the HOPE study should be considered as suitable candidates for long-term ramipril therapy as an addition to their existing drug regimen. Screening should include control of kidney function (by serum creatinine), particularly within the first two weeks of treatment, in addition to regular monitoring of serum potassium. However, the HOPE study shows that ramipril is well tolerated at high doses and over a long treatment period. The effectiveness of therapy should also be regularly reviewed and dose adjustments made where necessary. If concern remains, referral to a specialist--a cardiologist or a diabetologist--may ultimately be necessary.", 
    "28": "We have characterised nerve-mediated vasodilations in small arteries of the rat hepatic mesentery. Stimulation of sympathetic nerves (10 Hz, 10 s) produced a vasodilation which was abolished by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol (2 x 10(-6) M), but was unaffected by NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 10(-5) M). Stimulation of sensory nerves produced a large vasodilation that was abolished by capsaicin (10(-6) M). This vasodilation was unaffected by L-NAME (10(-5) M), but significantly reduced by the calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) antagonist, CGRP8-37 (10(-6) M), or inhibition of adenylate cyclase (SQ22356, 2 x 10(-5) M; 2',5'-dideoxyadenosine, 2 x 10(-4) M). Stimulation of cholinergic nerves produced a small vasodilation which was significantly reduced by scopolamine (10(-6) M). Expression of mRNA for CGRP1 receptors, muscarinic m2, m3 and m5 receptors and neurokinin1 (NK1) and NK3, receptors was detected. Perivascular nerves were immunoreactive for CGRP and substance P. No role was found for substance P, neuronal NO, ATP or adenosine in nerve-mediated responses. L-NAME (10(-5) M) potentiated vasoconstrictions following sympathetic nerve stimulation. This effect was reversed by L-arginine (10(-3) M) and cromakalim (10(-6) M) and mimicked by glybenclamide (10(-5) M), thus implicating KATP channels. Vasodilation in response to sensory nerve stimulation was directly proportional to the level of preconstriction, while vasodilation in response to neurogenic or applied acetylcholine was inhibited at high levels of preconstriction. We hypothesize that, under conditions of intensive vasoconstriction, some endothelial-dependent vasodilations may be less important than vasodilations activated directly through the smooth muscle.",

This presentation reviews the existing knowledge and recommendations regarding the treatment of chronic heart failure in adults and the information that is available in children. Medications currently recommended for use in adults include diuretics, digoxin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and beta-blockers. These recommendations are based on results from large, randomized, multicenter trials. Anecdotal evidence suggests similar beneficial effects of these medications in children. The fact that the etiologies, pathophysiology, and physiologic consequences of heart failure in children often differ greatly from those in adults, however, justifies the development of prospective, randomized trials to evaluate these medications specifically in children. Findings from these types of studies will provide critical information for developing guidelines for the appropriate treatment of children with chronic heart failure.",

These findings have been confirmed by additional studies in the clinical setting. More recently, several clinical trials have been completed investigating the role of brimonidine as adjunctive medication to beta-blockers and as replacement therapy to other intraocular pressure lowering compounds. When added to beta-blockers, brimonidine is superior to dorzolamide, similar in efficacy but better tolerated than pilocarpine, and more predictable than latanoprost.

In a review of the worldwide literature of the efficacy and safety of perindopril erbumine for the treatment of patients with CHF, once-daily treatment with this ACE inhibitor was shown to be effective in patients with CHF of all severities. Its use is associated with a low risk of first-dose hypotension and no unwanted effects on blood pressure in normotensive patients. Perindopril also improves arterial compliance and reverses left ventricular hypertrophy in patients with hypertension. It is well tolerated and has no significant effects on heart rate, indexes of renal function, or plasma lipid profile. It also has no clinically significant interactions with other drugs, including digoxin, likely to be taken by patients with CHF.",

For all visits pooled, the mean intraocular pressure at 4 PM for travoprost was 0.7 mm Hg (0.0015%, P =.0502) and 0.8 mm Hg (0.004%, P =.0191) lower than for latanoprost. Travoprost 0.004% was more effective than latanoprost and timolol in reducing intraocular pressure in black patients by up to 2.4 mm Hg (versus latanoprost) and 4.6 mm Hg (versus timolol). Based on a criterion of 30% or greater intraocular pressure reduction from diurnal baseline or intraocular pressure 17 mm Hg or less, travoprost 0.0015% and 0.004% had an overall response to treatment of 49.3% and 54.7%, respectively, compared with 49.6% for latanoprost and 39.0% for timolol. Iris pigmentation change was observed in 10 of 201 of patients (5.0%) receiving travoprost 0.0015%, six of 196 of patients (3.1%) receiving travoprost 0.004%, 10 of 194 of patients (5.2%) receiving latanoprost, and none of the patients receiving timolol (0 of 196). The average ocular hyperemia score was less than 1 on a scale of 0 to 3, indicating that on average patients experienced between none/trace and mild for all treatment groups.

    "63": "Sublingual (SL) apomorphine (2 to 6 mg) has been shown to be effective for treatment of male erectile dysfunction. Many patients with erectile dysfunction are also being treated for systemic hypertension and/or cardiovascular disease. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, SL apomorphine 5 mg and placebo were administered on alternate days to 162 men who were on long-term therapy (> or =4 weeks) with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta blockers, diuretics, calcium channel blockers, alpha(1) blockers, or short- or long-acting nitrates. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured before and after dosing; cardiac rhythm was recorded by 4-hour Holter monitoring. The only potentially clinically significant interactions between SL apomorphine and the antihypertensive agents or short-acting nitrates were greater orthostatic decreases in systolic blood pressure in the alpha-blocker and calcium channel blocker groups (-10 and -6 mm Hg vs placebo, respectively). Administration of SL apomorphine after dosing with long-acting nitrates resulted in significant decreases in blood pressure when patients were standing (mean systolic change, -5 to -9 mm Hg 30 to 60 minutes postdose, p <0.05; mean diastolic change, -3 to -4 mm Hg 50 to 60 minutes postdose, p <0.05). The most common adverse events with SL apomorphine were dizziness, nausea, and headache. Syncope occurred in 1 patient in the beta-blocker group; symptomatic hypotension occurred in 2 patients each in the short- and long-acting nitrate groups. Thus, in patients receiving common antihypertensive agents and short-acting nitrates, as well as in most patients receiving long-acting nitrates, SL apomorphine at higher than recommended doses produced no clinically significant changes in heart rate or blood pressure greater than changes seen with SL apomorphine alone.", 
    "64": "Transgenic TGR(mREN2)27 rats (TGR), carrying an additional mouse renin gene, are characterized by severe hypertension, an inverse circadian blood pressure profile, a blunted response to photic entrainment signals, and an increased nocturnal production of the pineal hormone melatonin. In order to evaluate the contribution of the over-expressed renin-angiotensin system to the function of the pineal gland in TGR, we studied the adrenergic and angiotensin II (Ang II)-mediated regulation of melatonin synthesis using dispersed pinealocytes from TGR and from Sprague-Dawley control rats (SDR). Isoproterenol was more effective in stimulating melatonin release in pinealocytes from TGR than from SDR, whereas the maximum effect of norepinephrine (NE) stimulation did not differ between the strains. Prazosin reduced the NE-mediated melatonin release only in SDR but not in TGR pinealocytes. Competition experiments with (+/-)-, (+)-, (-)-propranolol and (+/-)-atenolol revealed one homogeneous population of beta1-adrenoceptors. Ang II had no significant effect on basal or isoproterenol-induced melatonin release in either strain. In conclusion, TGR pinealocytes were more sensitive to beta-adrenergic stimulation than SDR pinealocytes, but lacked the alpha1-adrenergic potentiation of beta-adrenergic induced melatonin release. The renin-angiotensin system was not directly involved in the regulation of melatonin synthesis by rat pinealocytes in vitro.", 
    "65": "Enantiomeric separations in capillary electrochromatography (CEC) carried out using a continuous-bed chiral stationary phase (CSP) based on the macrocyclic antibiotic, vancomycin, is presented. The continuous beds were prepared from methacryloxypropyl modified fused silica capillaries (100 microm ID) by in situ copolymerization of N-(hydroxymethyl)acrylamide and piperazine diacrylamide with vinyl sulfonic acid comonomer used to introduce ionic functionality and thus a strong electroosmotic flow (EOF). The CSP was subsequently prepared by immobilizing the vancomycin stationary phase by reductive amination. Preliminary results have indicated that an extremely strong EOF is obtained in both the nonaqueous polar organic (15.2 x 10(-5) cm2 V(-1) s(-1) and the aqueous reversed-phase modes of operation (8.5 x 10(-5) cm2 V(-1) s(-1)). Enantioselectivity was obtained for four racemic compounds, the best of which was in the case of thalidomide which was separated in 10 minutes with high resolution (Rs = 2.5) and efficiency (120,000 plates meter(-1)) values.", 
    "66": "Separations of basic drug enantiomers by capillary electrophoresis (CE) using ovoglycoprotein (OGCHI) as a chiral selector are described. The effects of running buffer pH and 2-propanol content on the migration times and resolution of basic drug enantiomers were examined using a linear polyacrylamide-coated capillary. High resolution of basic drug enantiomers was attained using a mixture of 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 4.5-6.0) and 2-propanol (5-30%) including 50 microM OGCHI. It was found that ionic and hydrophobic interactions could work for the recognition of basic drug enantiomers. Further, we compared the chiral resolution ability of OGCHI with that of completely deglycosylated OGCHI (cd-OGCHI) using them as chiral selectors in CE. OGCHI showed higher resolution for basic drug enantiomers tested than cd-OGCHI. The results suggest that the chiral recognition site(s) for OGCHI exists on the protein domain of OGCHI.",

In all patients, beta-blockade either was contraindicated or (in 7%) had failed. Intravenous diltiazem was administered as a slow 10-mg bolus dose (0.1-0.2 mg/kg ideal body weight), and then an infusion was started at 5 or 10 mg/hr and increased up to 30 mg/hr, as needed, to decrease heart rate to <100 beats/min. Variables retrospectively collected included demographic data, preinfusion blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and preinfusion pressure-rate quotients (pressure-rate quotient = mean arterial pressure / heart rate). Intravenous bolus dose, when given, and diltiazem infusion rate and time necessary to achieve the target heart rate also were recorded. The lowest heart rate recorded within 24 hrs from the initiation of the infusion and the time necessary to achieve the lowest heart rate after beginning the infusion were recorded.",

Multiple linear regression suggested that response could be predicted by age, pressure-rate quotients, baseline mean arterial pressure, and central nervous system failure. In the responders, a heart rate <100 beats/min was achieved in an average of 2 hrs, at a mean diltiazem infusion of 13.3 mg/hr. The lowest rate reached by the responders in a 24-hr period averaged 86 beats/min and was achieved in 4.8 hrs with a mean infusion rate of 14.8 mg/hr. Both target and lowest rate values were statistically different from baseline heart rate.",

    "76": "To reduce the intraocular pressure (IOP), treatment was started with drops of timolol, betamethasone, and atropine and acetazolamide suspension. After 6 months of medical treatment, the skin lesions did not change, but the iris lesion enlarged without hyphema. The IOP in the right eye was controlled by the medications.", 
    "77": "Although JXG is an uncommon disease, it is one of the most important causes of spontaneous hyphema in children. Iris involvement, spontaneous hyphema, and secondary glaucoma are the most common ocular problems. Corneal involvement often is characterized by a yellowish protrusion of the limbus along with blood staining of recurrent hyphema and elevated IOP. In this report, we describe an unusual case of JXG with 360-degree limbus, iris, and angle involvement. To our knowledge, this is the first report in the medical literature of 360-degree limbus involvement in JXG.", 
    "78": "Effective control of blood pressure is usually achieved only with the use of two or more antihypertensive medications. The treatment options for hypertension are numerous, and the number of possible combinations large. The selection of a specific combination drug regimen has often been linked to the perceived need for diuretic therapy as first- or second-step therapy; thus, the popularity of such drug combinations as an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor/diuretic, an angiotensin-receptor blocker/diuretic, or a beta blocker/diuretic. Rational alternatives exist, including an ACE inhibitor/calcium channel blocker (CCB) or a dihydropyridine CCB/b blocker combination. Traditionally, recommendations have advised against the use of combination therapy with two drugs from the same therapeutic class. However, because of the different binding and pharmacologic characteristics of CCBs, a rationale exists for combining different agents in this class in the management of hypertension and/or symptomatic coronary artery disease. In the treatment of either hypertension or angina, combination CCB therapy can prove uniquely successful.", 
    "79": "Hypertension and its complications are more frequent and occur about a decade earlier in life among high-risk groups, especially in the Southeast. Moreover, socioeconomic status is inversely related to hypertension and cardiovascular complications. Low-income, young and middle-aged adults living in the Southeast may be at especially high risk. Data on inpatient admissions among hypertensive Medicaid beneficiaries living in this region may provide insights on the burden of hypertension-related disease and on opportunities for successful intervention. A study of hospitalization rates and costs among 44,440 hypertensive Medicaid beneficiaries in South Carolina from 1993-1996 showed that 16,883 (38%) were continuously enrolled in Medicaid. Of this group, 63% were African American and 74% were women. Among the continuously enrolled patients, 7637, or about 45%, were hospitalized during the 4-year period. These 7637 individuals accounted for 20,698 hospital admissions, i.e., 2.7 admissions per person, over the 4-year interval. Nearly two thirds of the hospitalizations included a cardiovascular or renal diagnosis. Hospital claims paid reached nearly $90 million for the 7637 hypertensive Medicaid recipients during the 4-year period. Among patients discharged from the hospital with congestive heart failure, 33% filled a prescription for an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor within 90 days; 13% of patients discharged with an acute myocardial infarction filled a prescription for a beta blocker within 90 days. The data confirm that hypertensive Medicaid beneficiaries in the Southeast are hospitalized at high rates. Cardiovascular and renal morbidity account for the majority of the inpatient admissions. The findings suggest that the application of evidence-based guidelines would improve health, avoid cost, and reduce racial disparities in health outcomes.", 
    "80": "Older studies of antihypertensive treatment have shown that prescribing patterns are not consistent with recommendations from expert national panels. We determined whether prescribing patterns for antihypertensive drugs changed recently in the largest integrated health care system in the United States. Specifically, we determine 1) patterns of antihypertensive medication use at all Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical facilities for fiscal years 1997 to 1999, 2) the cost of this care, and 3) savings associated with changes in treatment patterns. Data were aggregated by individual medication as well as by antihypertensive drug class. Estimates of VA national antihypertensive drug costs are based on the median cost and the number of units for each dosage form of each medication dispensed at all facilities. At VA medical facilities, calcium antagonist use went from 33% to 29.3% of antihypertensive treatment days between 1997 and 1999, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) use from 36.4% to 36.8%, beta-blockers from 19.1% to 21.1%, and thiazide diuretic use from at 11.5% to 12.8%. If treatment patterns had remained the same between 1997 and 1999 in terms of the proportion of medications from each drug class, an additional six million dollars would have been spent on antihypertensive medications in 1999. Although calcium antagonists and ACE inhibitors/ARB remained the most commonly dispensed antihypertensives at VA facilities from 1997 to 1999, there was a proportional decrease in calcium antagonist use and an increase in the use of thiazide diuretics and beta-blockers. These changes were consistent with improved compliance with VA national guidelines. The cost implications of these changes in practice patterns were considerable.", 
    "81": "Mouse capillary endothelial cells (1G11 cell line) embedded in type I collagen gels undergo in vitro angiogenesis. Cells rapidly reorganize and form capillary-like structures when stimulated with serum. Transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) alone can substitute for serum and induce cell survival and tubular network formation. This TGF-beta1-mediated angiogenic activity depends on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. We showed that specific inhibitors of either pathway (wortmannin, LY-294002, and PD-98059) all suppressed TGF-beta1-induced angiogenesis mainly by compromising cell survival. We established that TGF-beta1 stimulated the expression of TGF-alpha mRNA and protein, the tyrosine phosphorylation of a 170-kDa membrane protein representing the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, and the delayed activation of PI3K/Akt and p42/p44 MAPK. Moreover, we showed that all these TGF-beta1-mediated signaling events, including tubular network formation, were suppressed by incubating TGF-beta1-stimulated endothelial cells with a soluble form of an EGF receptor (ErbB-1) or tyrphostin AG1478, a specific blocker of EGF receptor tyrosine kinase. Finally, addition of TGF-alpha alone poorly stimulated angiogenesis; however, by reducing cell death, it strongly potentiated the action of TGF-beta1. We therefore propose that TGF-beta1 promotes angiogenesis at least in part via the autocrine secretion of TGF-alpha, a cell survival growth factor, activating PI3K/Akt and p42/p44 MAPK.", 
    "82": "The drug treatment of heart failure, once simple, has become complex. Apart from a loop diuretic and digoxin, most patients should now be receiving an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (or angiotensin II receptor blocker), a beta-blocker and spironolactone. Newer drugs, such as endothelin-receptor antagonists and combined blockers of converting-enzyme and neutral endopeptidase, might soon become available. When to introduce these drugs and what dose is optimal for any individual, are questions that currently vex clinicians. We proposed that plasma levels of the cardiac hormone brain natriuretic peptide (BNP, or better, its 1-76 amino-acid N-terminal fragment, N-BNP), would provide an objective index for guiding drug treatment in patients with established, stable cardiac failure. In a pilot study, 69 patients were randomized to drug treatment based on clinical criteria, or based on plasma levels of N-BNP. After a median follow-up of 9.6 months, those in the N-BNP group had fewer clinical end-points than those in the group managed by clinical criteria alone (19 vs 54; P= 0.02). These preliminary data encourage the concept that the increasingly complex pharmacotherapy for heart failure, both chronic (as in this trial) and acute, might best be guided by an objective measure such as plasma levels of BNP or N-BNP.",

A total of 1766 patients in Newcastle and 4,503 patients in Perth, discharged from hospital after confirmed MI from 1985 to 1993, were studied. Rates of beta-blocker use before and after hospital discharge were evaluated and correlates of beta-blocker use determined.", 
    "85": "Beta-blocker use was similar in Newcastle and Perth before MI (21% of patients in each centre). During hospital admission, beta-blocker therapy was initiated nearly twice as frequently in Perth compared with Newcastle (66 vs 36%, respectively) and more patients were discharged from hospital on beta-blockers in Perth (68%) than in Newcastle (45%). The main factors associated with underuse of beta-blockers in multivariate analysis were geographical centre (odds ratio (OR) for Newcastle compared with Perth 0.3; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.3-0.3), a history of previous MI (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.5-0.7), admission to hospital in earlier years (OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.3-0.4 for years 1985-87 compared with years 1991-93), diabetes (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.5-0.8) and the concomitant use of diuretics (OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.4-0.6) and calcium antagonists (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.5-0.8).", 
    "86": "Underuse of beta-blockers after MI was strongly related to hospital prescribing patterns and not to community use of beta-blockers.

As illustrated by this case, carvedilol may also increase the energy requirement for internal defibrillation.", 
    "88": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is frequently activated in patients with chronic liver diseases. Angiotensin-II (AT-II) has been suggested to play an important role in liver fibrogenesis. It induces hepatic stellate cell (HSC) proliferation and up-regulates the transforming growth factor beta(1) (TGF-beta(1)) expression via AT-II type 1 receptor (AT(1)-R) in vitro. The aim of the present study was to examine the in vivo effect of candesartan (CA), a clinically used AT(1)-R blocker (ARB), and perindopril (PE), an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (ACE-I), on pig serum-induced liver fibrosis development in rats. The clinically available comparable doses of CA and PE significantly attenuated the fibrosis development. These inhibitory effects of PE and CA were also found in the on-going liver fibrosis model. The hepatic hydroxyproline and serum fibrosis markers were significantly suppressed by CA and PE treatment. Furthermore, the alpha smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) positive cells in number were markedly suppressed by CA and PE treatment. Similarly, the hepatic TGF-beta(1) protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were significantly suppressed. Our in vitro study showed that AT-II increased the TGF-beta(1) mRNA expression in the activated HSCs, and this effect was totally blocked by CA. These results suggested that the RAS, especially AT-II and AT(1)-R interaction plays a pivotal role in liver fibrosis development through HSC activation. Because both CA and PE are widely used in clinical practice without serious side effects, these drugs may provide an effective new strategy for anti-liver fibrosis therapy.",

Only preserved beta-blockers induced chromatin condensation associated with an alteration of mitochondrial activity and a decrease of glutathione, suggesting an apoptotic phenomenon. BAC increased glutathione after 15 minutes, whereas a decrease was observed after a recovery period. ROS production was found with preserved formulations at significantly higher levels than those observed with unpreserved drugs.",

This 1994-1996 Washington State study investigated whether such exposure was associated with lower nocturnal urinary concentration of 6-sulfatoxymelatonin in 203 women aged 20-74 years with no history of breast cancer. Each woman was interviewed and provided data on the following for a 72-hour period at two different seasons of the year: 1) magnetic field and ambient light measured every 30 seconds in her bedroom, 2) personal magnetic field measured at 30-second intervals, and 3) complete nighttime urine samples on three consecutive nights. Lower nocturnal urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin level was associated with more hours of daylight, older age, higher body mass index, current alcohol consumption, and current use of medications classified as beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, or psychotropics. After adjustment for these factors, higher bedroom magnetic field level was associated with significantly lower urinary concentration of 6-sulfatoxymelatonin during the same night, primarily in women who used these medications and during times of the year with the fewest hours of darkness. These results suggest that exposure to nighttime residential 60-Hz magnetic fields can depress the normal nocturnal rise in melatonin.",

At any follow-up evaluation, the covariance analysis showed significantly greater interval changes in LVEDI in group 3 than in group 1 (P =.0077 at 2 weeks, P =.0108 at 3 months, and P = 0.0155 at 6 months). No significant differences were observed between group 1 and group 2 and between group 2 and group 3.",

Each drug caused similar reductions in left ventricular mass, chamber sphericity, and pulmonary artery wedge pressure during monotherapy and combined treatment. Adjunctive treatment with carvedilol produced a trend toward a greater increase in ejection fraction (4.3% vs 2.7%, respectively; P not significant) and significantly greater reductions in the wall thickening score index than with captopril (0.25 vs 0.08, respectively; P =.04).",

In the RESOLVD study, the 6MWT was not responsive to change when effect sizes and standardized response means were used. Disease-specific quality of life was responsive to change in patients treated with candesartan and enalapril and NYHA-FC was responsive to change in the candesartan and enalapril combination and for enalapril alone with small effect sizes. The 6MWT, NYHA-FC, and quality of life were not responsive to change during the metoprolol or placebo phase.",

There was a marked increase in the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, aspirin, beta-blockers, lipid-lowering agents, and thrombolytic therapy between 1986 and 1997. The use of calcium antagonists, lidocaine, and other antiarrhythmic agents declined over this period. Similar trends were observed in the use of these agents in hospital survivors at the time of hospital discharge. Patient age, presence of comorbidities, and AMI-associated characteristics influenced the use of these therapies; sex differences in the use of several of these medications were also noted.",

    "126": "1. Are arterial blood pressure fluctuations buffered or reinforced by respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA)? There is still considerable debate about this simple question. Different results have been obtained, triggering a discussion as to whether or not the baroreflexes are responsible for RSA. We suspected that the measurements of different aspects of arterial pressure (mean arterial pressure (MAP) and systolic pressure (SP)) can explain the conflicting results. 2. Simultaneous recordings of beat-to-beat MAP, SP, left cardiac stroke volume (SV, pulsed ultrasound Doppler), heart rate (HR) and respiration (RE) were obtained in 10 healthy young adults during spontaneous respiration. In order to eliminate HR variations at respiratory frequency we used propranolol and atropine administration in the supine and tilted positions. Respiration-synchronous variation in the recorded variables was quantified by spectral analysis of the recordings of each of these variables, and the phase relations between them were determined by cross-spectral analysis. 3. MAP fluctuations increased after removing heart rate variations in both supine and tilted position, whereas SP fluctuations decreased in the supine position and increased in the head-up tilted position. 4. RSA buffers respiration-synchronous fluctuations in MAP in both positions. However, fluctuations in SP were reinforced by RSA in the supine and buffered in the tilted position.", 
    "127": "1. We investigated whether catecholamines through activation of alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors (alpha(1)-AR) are involved in mouse uterine contraction at parturition. Myometrial phospholipase C (PLC) activity and uterine contraction were measured in response to noradrenaline (NA), the specific alpha(1)-AR agonist phenylephrine (Phe) and oxytocin (OT). 2. Using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR, we detected the alpha(1a)-AR subtype in late pregnant mouse myometrium. We also detected, by immunoblotting studies, PLCbeta(1), PLCbeta(3) and different alpha-subunits of pertussis toxin-insensitive (Galpha(q/11)) and -sensitive G proteins (Galpha(o/i3), Galpha(i1/2)). 3. Phenylephrine and NA did not alter the myometrial inositol phosphate (InsP) production of late pregnant or parturient mouse. In similar conditions, OT increased InsP production in a dose-dependent manner. Consistent with these results, only OT (10 microM) recruited PLCbeta(1) and PLCbeta(3) to myometrial plasma membranes. The OT-induced InsP response was not altered by pertussis toxin (300 ng ml(-1), 2 h pretreatment), suggesting the involvement of a member of the Galpha(q) family. 4. Noradrenaline and Phe failed to increase uterine contraction at late pregnancy and at parturition. In contrast, OT induced uterine contraction in a dose-dependent manner with maximal increase (400 %) at a concentration of 1 microM. 5. The results indicate that OT receptors (OTR) but not alpha(1)-AR are linked to myometrial PLC activation and uterine contraction in late pregnant and parturient mouse. This discrepancy between mouse and other mammals could be attributed to the alpha(1)-AR subtype expressed in myometrium at this time.", 
    "128": "1. Using a semi-intact epithelial preparation we examined the Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (K(Ca)) currents of frog (Rana pipiens) saccular hair cells. After blocking voltage-dependent K(+) (K(V)) currents with 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) an outward current containing inactivating (I(transient)) and non-inactivating (I(steady)) components remained. 2. The contribution of each varied greatly from cell to cell, with I(transient) contributing from 14 to 90 % of the total outward current. Inactivation of I(transient) was rapid (tau approximately 2-3 ms) and occurred within the physiological range of membrane potentials (V(1/2) = -63 mV). Recovery from inactivation was also rapid (tau approximately 10 ms). 3. Suppression of both I(transient) and I(steady) by depolarizations that approached the Ca(2+) equilibrium potential and by treatments that blocked Ca(2+) influx (application Ca(2+)-free saline or Cd(2+)), suggest both are Ca(2+) dependent. Both were blocked by iberiotoxin, a specific blocker of large-conductance K(Ca) channels (BK), but not by apamin, a specific blocker of small-conductance K(Ca) channels. 4. Ensemble-variance analysis showed that I(transient) and I(steady) flow through two distinct populations of channels, both of which have a large single-channel conductance (~100 pS in non-symmetrical conditions). Together, these data indicate that both I(transient) and I(steady) are carried through BK channels, one of which undergoes rapid inactivation while the other does not. 5. Inactivation of I(transient) could be removed by extracellular papain and could later be restored by intracellular application of the 'ball' domain of the auxiliary subunit (beta2) thought to mediate BK channel inactivation in rat chromaffin cells. We hypothesize that I(transient) results from the association of a similar beta subunit with some of the BK channels and that papain removes inactivation by cleaving extracellular sites required for this association.",

The released TL from BUTL inserts and PalTL inserts in pH 7.4 phosphate-buffered saline until 5 h were approximately 25% and 3% of that from TL inserts, respectively. In addition, BUTL was also released from BUTL inserts. However, PalTL was not released from the PalTL insert. The release of drugs from TL inserts and BUTL inserts was little affected by the addition of bovine serum albumin (BSA) in pH 7.4 phosphate-buffered saline. In contrast, the release of drugs from PalTL inserts were enhanced by the addition of BSA. After application of TL, BUTL, and PalTL inserts to the rabbit eye, the aqueous humor concentration of TL was prolonged compared with TL instillation, and the plasma concentration of TL was much lower than that of TL instillation. The ratios of the area under the TL concentration-time curve (AUC) in the aqueous humor to AUC in the plasma (AUC(aqueous)/AUC(plasma)) after application of BUTL until 8 h were 3.1-fold and 3.8-fold higher than those of the TL insert and PalTL insert, respectively.",

These trials have modified and enhanced the therapeutic paradigm for heart failure and extended treatment goals beyond limiting congestive symptoms of volume overload. Part II of this two-part article presents treatment recommendations for patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. The authors recommend that, if tolerated and not contraindicated, the following agents be used in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction: an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor in all patients; a beta blocker in all patients except those who have symptoms at rest; and spironolactone in patients who have symptoms at rest or who have had such symptoms within the past six months. Diuretics and digoxin should be reserved, as needed, for symptomatic management of heart failure. Other treatments or treatment programs may be necessary in individual patients.",

In another instance heart block and hypotension was noted in association with a diltiazem and atenolol adverse interaction. Crystalloid infusion was ineffective in both cases, but toxicity was rapidly reversed with aminophylline administration.

Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and hypertrophic cardio-myopathy (HCM) are more common than restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM). Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) is extremely rare in pediatric age groups. Treatment should be targeted at the cause of the cardiomyopathy, if identified. Nutritional deficiencies, metabolic disorders, and inborn errors of metabolism should be corrected if possible. Immunosuppressive therapy may be considered in patients with lymphocytic myocarditis. Maximal medical therapy with inotropic drugs or cardiac glycosides, diuretic drugs, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors improve heart failure symptoms in patients with DCM. Beta-blocker therapy in adults with DCM is well established and is being evaluated in children with DCM. High-dosage beta-blocker or calcium channel blocker therapy improves the survival rate in children with HCM. The cautious use of diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with RCM improves symptoms. Anticoagulation to prevent thromboembolism in patients with DCM and RCM is indicated. Antiarrhythmia therapy is needed in patients with DCM- or HCM-associated dysrhythmia. Cardiac transplant is indicated in patients with progressive deterioration.", 
    "138": "Following agonist stimulation, most G protein-coupled receptors become desensitized and are internalized, either to be degraded or recycled back to the cell surface. What determines the fate of a specific receptor type after it is internalized is poorly understood. Here we show that the rapidly recycling beta2 adrenergic receptor (beta2AR) binds via a determinant including the last three amino acids in its carboxyl-terminal tail to the membrane fusion regulatory protein, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF). This is documented by in vitro overlay assays and by cellular coimmunoprecipitations. Receptors bearing mutations in any of the last three residues fail to interact with NSF. After stimulation with the agonist isoproterenol, a green fluorescent protein fusion of NSF colocalizes with the wild type beta2AR but not with a tail-mutated beta2AR. The beta2AR-NSF interaction is required for efficient internalization of the receptors and for their recycling to the cell surface. Mutations in the beta2AR tail that ablate NSF binding reduce the efficiency of receptor internalization upon agonist stimulation. Upon subsequent treatment of cells with the antagonist propranolol, wild type receptors return to the cell surface, while tail-mutated receptors remain sequestered. Thus, the direct binding of the beta2AR to NSF demonstrates how, after internalization, the fate of a receptor is reliant on a specific interaction with a component of the cellular membrane-trafficking machinery.", 
    "139": "Altered expression and functional responses to cardiac beta(3)-adrenergic receptors (ARs) may contribute to progressive cardiac dysfunction in heart failure (CHF). We compared myocyte beta(3)-AR mRNA and protein levels and myocyte contractile, [Ca(2+)](i) transient, and Ca(2+) current (I(Ca,L)) responses to BRL-37344 (BRL, 10(-8) mol/L), a selective beta(3)-AR agonist, in 9 instrumented dogs before and after pacing-induced CHF. Myocytes were isolated from left ventricular myocardium biopsy tissues. Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, we detected beta(3)-AR mRNA from myocyte total RNA in each animal. Using a cloned canine beta(3)-AR cDNA probe and myocyte poly A(+) RNA, we detected a single band about 3.4 kb in normal and CHF myocytes. beta(3)-AR protein was detected by Western blot. beta(3)-AR mRNA and protein levels were significantly greater in CHF myocytes than in normal myocytes. Importantly, these changes were associated with enhanced beta(3)-AR-mediated negative modulation on myocyte contractile response and [Ca(2+)](i) regulation. Compared with normal myocytes, CHF myocytes had much greater decreases in the velocity of shortening and relengthening with BRL accompanied by larger reductions in the peak systolic [Ca(2+)](i) transient and I(Ca,L). These responses were not modified by pretreating myocytes with metoprolol (a beta(1)-AR antagonist) or nadolol (a beta(1)- and beta(2)-AR antagonist), but were nearly prevented by bupranolol or L-748,337 (beta(3)-AR antagonists). We conclude that in dogs with pacing-induced CHF, beta(3)-AR gene expression and protein levels are upregulated, and the functional response to beta(3)-AR stimulation is increased. This may contribute to progression of cardiac dysfunction in CHF.", 
    "140": "A novel peptide from Centruroides noxius Hoffmann scorpion venom was isolated and sequenced. The 37 amino acid peptide belongs to the charybdotoxin sub-family (alphaKTx1) and was numbered member 11. alphaKTx1.11 has 75% sequence identity with iberiotoxin and 54% with charybdotoxin. alphaKTx1.11 revealed specificity for mammalian MaxiK channels (hSlo), thus, was named slotoxin. Slotoxin blocks the MaxiK pore-forming alpha subunit reversibly (K(d)=1.5 nM). Slotoxin association with alpha+beta (beta1 or beta4) channels was approximately 10 times slower than iberiotoxin and charybdotoxin, leading to a lack of effect on alpha+beta4 when tested at 100 nM for 5 min. Thus, slotoxin is a better tool to distinguish MaxiK alpha+beta complexes.",

To analyse the initial events of beta-BuTx-mediated cell death, the toxin was applied to cultured rat hippocampal neurons where it induced neuronal cell death in a concentration-dependent manner (EC(50) approximately equal to 5 x 10(-13) M) within 24 h. Fluorescence labelled beta-BuTx was completely incorporated by neurons within < 10 min. Binding and uptake of beta-BuTx, as well as induction of cell death, were efficiently antagonized by preincubation with dendrotoxin I, a blocker of voltage-gated potassium channels devoid of phospholipase activity. Binding of beta-BuTx was selective for neurofilament-positive cells. As evident from intense annexin-V and TUNEL stainings, application of beta-BuTx induced apoptotic cell death exclusively in neurons, leaving astrocytes unaffected. No evidence was obtained for any contribution of either caspases or calpains to beta-BuTx-induced apoptosis, consistent with the inability of the inhibitors Z-Asp-DCB and calpeptin, respectively, to protect neurons from beta-BuTx-induced cell death. These observations indicate that induction of cell death by beta-BuTx comprises several successive phases: (i) binding to neuronal potassium channels is the initial event, followed by (ii) internalization and (iii) induction of apoptotic cell death via a caspase-independent pathway.",

These effects were also studied in the presence of atenolol, a beta-blocking agent, and 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), a blocker of the transient outward K+ current. Thiopental (3.8 x 10(-6), 3.8 x 10(-5) and 1.1 x 10(-4) M) induced a dose-dependent positive inotropic effect. This positive inotropic effect persisted in the presence of atenolol (1 x 10(-6) M) but did not develop in the presence of 1 mM 4-AP; 4-AP had a positive inotropic effect but not in the presence of thiopental. Moreover, thiopental (3.8 x 10(-5) M) lengthened the plateau and the slow repolarizing phase of the AP, while 1 mM 4-AP only prolonged the plateau duration. In rat myocardium, the positive inotropic effect of thiopental in part mimics that of 4-AP, and in part may be explained by the lengthening of the slow repolarizing phase of the AP.", 
    "157": "Historically, postural hypotension has been cited as a consideration which might influence the selection of antihypertensive therapy. The common symptoms (dizziness, blackouts, syncope) give cause for concern but they are not attributed to every class of antihypertensive drug. For example, administration of a beta-blocker is not generally associated with symptomatic postural hypotension, whereas the alpha-blocker prazosin was particularly problematical, with a significant and well-recognized risk of first-dose postural effects. Titration from a low starting dose and careful selection/monitoring of patients have been successfully used to circumvent this problem. However, since there is a relatively high incidence of postural hypotensive symptoms in elderly patients in general, it may be a misconception to attribute such symptoms to any particular type of antihypertensive drug. Furthermore, with the newer alpha(1)-blockers, such as doxazosin, which have a more gradual onset of action, there is a markedly reduced tendency for postural hypotension to occur. Thus, it is perhaps time to reassess the real significance of iatrogenic postural hypotension in the selection of antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "158": "The Oxford Record Linkage Study (ORLS; an epidemiological database) was used to examine relationships between intercurrent cardiovascular drug therapy and cardiac death within 30 days of elective or emergency/urgent surgery under general anaesthesia. Cases identified from the ORLS were paired with matched control patients. Clinical details were obtained from the patients' medical notes. In elective surgical patients, there was no effect of beta-adrenoceptor or calcium entry channel blockade, diuretics or digoxin on cardiac death after adjusting for confounding variables. Use of nitrates was associated with an odds ratio of 4.79 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-22.72] for cardiac death after adjustment for confounding by a history of angina and residual age difference. In emergency/urgent patients, there were significant univariate associations with cardiac death for intercurrent use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (odds ratio 1.18) and diuretics (odds ratio 4.95; 95% CI 1.82-13.46). However, neither maintained significance after adjustment for the confounding effect of cardiac failure. We conclude that, with the possible exception of the use of nitrates in elective surgical patients, chronic intercurrent drug treatment alone does not significantly affect the odds of cardiac death within 30 days of surgery.", 
    "159": "Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents (beta-blockers) are now considered to be standard of care for the treatment of chronic congestive heart failure in adults. Studies in adults with chronic heart failure have shown that beta-blockers improve left ventricular ejection fraction, symptoms, and survival when compared to placebo. New mechanisms of actions in individual beta-blockers are being continually elucidated, but the primary mechanism of action of beta-blockers in chronic heart failure is thought to be the prevention and/or reversal of adrenergically-mediated intrinsic myocardial dysfunction and remodeling. Experience with the use of beta-blockers in children with heart failure is limited but growing. Although no randomized, placebo-controlled data yet exists, anecdotal evidence suggests that children with chronic congestive heart failure may also benefit from this therapy. There are now uncontrolled safety and efficacy studies showing possible benefit from both metoprolol and carvedilol in children with heart failure due to either large left-to-right shunt or systemic ventricular dysfunction. Large prospective, randomized trials in children are currently underway in order to attempt to determine the indications, dosages, and optimal use of beta-blockers in children with chronic congestive heart failure.", 
    "160": "A number of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) parameters have been used in cardiovascular psychophysiology. This study aimed to describe the pattern and redundancy of a set of SNS parameters during peripherally induced changes of cardiac sympathetic activation and reflex modulation of central SNS control. Preejection period (PEP) was assessed as a marker of peripheral sympathetic activation. Low-frequency blood pressure variability (BPV) was assessed as an estimate of central SNS control.", 
    "161": "Peripheral beta-sympathetic stimulation and blockade were achieved with epinephrine and esmolol hydrochloride (beta1-blockade), respectively. Changes in central SNS output were induced by loading and unloading arterial baroreceptors with norepinephrine and nitroprusside sodium, respectively. This single-blinded, crossover study in 24 healthy men also included two placebo control periods. PEP was derived from impedance cardiography and adjusted individually for heart rate. BPV was calculated by power spectral analyses of beat-to-beat heart rate and systolic blood pressure (Finapres system) data.", 
    "162": "PEP decreased during epinephrine infusion (-40.1 +/- 3.8 ms, p <.0001) and increased during esmolol infusion (+6.6 +/- 3.5 ms, p =.05). PEP was shortened after central SNS activation by nitroprusside (-16.8 +/- 2.9 ms, p < 0.0001). Systolic BPV in the low-frequency range (0.07-0.14 Hz, Mayer waves) increased during nitroprusside infusion (+0.44 +/- 0.19 ln mm Hg(2), p =.03) and decreased during norepinephrine infusion (-0.67 +/- 0.13 ln mm Hg(2), p < 0.0001). Low-frequency BPV did not change significantly during epinephrine or esmolol infusion.", 
    "163": "Our data provide empirical evidence of separable peripheral and central sympathetic response components. The combined report of low-frequency BPV and PEP gives distinct information on both central SNS control and the level of sympathetic cardiac activation achieved.", 
    "164": "The pharmacological characteristics of levobetaxolol, a single active isomer of betaxolol, were determined and compared with activities of other beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. Levobetaxolol (43-fold beta1-selective) exhibited a higher affinity at cloned human beta1 (Ki = 0.76 nM) than at beta2 (Ki = 32.6 nM) receptors, while dextrobetaxolol was much weaker at both receptors. Levobetaxolol potently antagonized functional activities at cloned human beta1 and beta2 receptors, and also at guinea pig atrial beta1, tracheal beta2 and rat colonic beta3 receptors (IC50s = 33.2 nM, 2970 nM and 709 nM, respectively). Thus, levobetaxolol was 89-times beta1-selective (vs beta2). Levobetaxolol (Ki = 16.4 nM) was more potent than dextrobetaxolol (Ki = 2.97 microM) at inhibiting isoproterenol-induced cAMP production in human non-pigmented ciliary epithelial cells. Levobunolol and (l)-timolol had high affinities at beta1 and beta2 receptors but were considerably less beta1-selective than levobetaxolol. Levo-, dextro- and racemic-betaxolol exhibited little or no affinity, except at sigma sites and Ca2+-channels (IC50s > 1 microM), at 89 other receptor/ligand binding sites. Levobetaxolol exhibited a micromolar affinity for L-type Ca2+-channels. In conscious ocular hypertensive cynomolgus monkeys, levobetaxolol was more potent than dextrobetaxolol, reducing intraocular pressure by 25.9+/-3.2% at a dose of 150 microg/eye (n = 15-30). Quantitative [3H]-levobetaxolol autoradiography revealed high levels of binding to human ciliary processes, iris, choroid/retina, and ciliary muscles. In conclusion, levobetaxolol is a potent, high affinity and beta1-selective IOP-lowering beta-adrenoceptor antagonist.", 
    "165": "New insights into the pathophysiology of atherosclerotic plaques leading to acute myocardial infarction (MI) are discussed, along with new diagnostic and treatment strategies. Ischemic heart disease represents a continuum from stable angina to unstable angina to non-Q-wave MI to Q-wave MI. Patients whose angina becomes unstable are classified as having acute coronary syndrome (ACS). It was formerly believed that thrombosis leading to critical occlusion of coronary arteries at the site of atherosclerotic plaque rupture was the common cause of ischemic heart disease. It is now thought that even lesions that do not critically occlude coronary arteries can cause MI. ACS can be caused by the rupture of an unstable atherosclerotic plaque. Vulnerable plaques are usually those causing only mild to moderate stenosis and having a lipid-rich core and a thin, macrophage-dense, collagen-poor fibrous cap. Factors affecting plaque rupture include mechanical injury, circadian rhythm, inflammation, and infection. Progressive thrombosis and vasospasm may follow plaque rupture. The diagnosis of MI starts with the recognition of symptoms of myocardial ischemia that are new or different from the usual pattern. Agents used to prevent or treat plaque rupture and its complications include thrombolytics, antiplatelet agents, antithrombotics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and nitrates. Once patients survive the acute phase of MI, long-term therapy for prevention of future events begins. Post-MI patients should receive aspirin, beta-blockers, and an ACE inhibitor indefinitely; modification of cardiovascular risk factors is also important. Greater understanding of the pathophysiology of ACS has led to strategies to limit the progression of atherosclerosis and to improve survival and function after an acute event.", 
    "166": "Normal rats or rats parasympathetically denervated on one side by cutting the auriculo-temporal nerve were maintained on a liquid diet for 1 week. After fasting overnight, experimental rats were then offered hard, pelleted food over a period of 2 h, while unfed animals served as controls. The reflex-induced increase in the [3H]leucine incorporation into trichloroacetic acid-insoluble material of the parotid glands following intake of the food in the presence of the muscarinic blocker atropine and alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists was greater (104%) than in the absence of the blockers (75%) in normal rats. The picture was the same when the innervated glands of rats subjected to unilateral parasympathetic denervation were examined. In this case, the protein synthesis increased by 108% in the presence of the blockers and by 63% in their absence. Analysis of the parasympathetically denervated and contralateral innervated glands revealed no support for a cholinergic or adrenergic contribution to this response. The increase in protein synthesis in the innervated glands was 86% in the rats treated with atropine, whilst it was 76% in those treated with alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. The protein synthesis in the denervated glands increased by 57% in the absence of receptor blockade. Neither atropine (51%), nor a- and b-adrenoceptor antagonists (52%), nor a combination of the three blockers (55%) affected the response of the denervated glands. A large part of the response in the presence of the traditional autonomic receptor blockers was thus dependent on the parasympathetic auriculo-temporal nerve. Under natural feeding conditions, the parasympathetic non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic (NANC) mechanisms are likely to contribute to the synthesis of secretory proteins.", 
    "167": "In the vagally intact anaesthetised dog, we have investigated the role of nitric oxide (NO) on a normal sinus arrhythmia using an inhibitor of neuronally released NO, 1-(2-trifluoromethylphenyl) imidazole (TRIM). The mean and S.D. of the R-R interval was used to describe mean heart rate and heart rate variability, respectively. TRIM (0.8 mg I.C.) injected into the sinus node artery increased the mean heart rate slightly but reduced heart rate variability 3-fold from a control of 790 +/- 124 ms (mean +/- S.D.; n = 5) to 666 +/- 36 ms (P < 0.01 Student's paired t test, n = 5). These results suggest that neuronally released NO may have a vagal facilitatory role in the maintenance of sinus arrhythmia in the normal heart.", 
    "168": "The aim of this study was to assess whether patients have their ocular drops correctly prescribed during non-ophthalmic admissions to hospital. A retrospective review of notes of patients who were admitted to hospital for general medical or surgical care, while on regular eye drops at the time of admission was performed. Twenty two patients were on regular ocular medication when admitted. Only seven out of 22 patients had their eye drops correctly prescribed. Furthermore, six patients had been prescribed topical beta-blockers, yet suffered from medical conditions that may have been aggravated by these drops. These findings demonstrate that the majority of patients on drops do not have their medication correctly prescribed during non-ophthalmic admissions to hospital. Also topical beta-blockers continue to be inappropriately prescribed.", 
    "169": "The present study examined what kind of receptors are involved in the antinociception produced by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of a,beta-methylene-ATP using antagonists at adrenergic, serotonin or opioid receptors. Antinociceptive effect of alpha,beta-methylene-ATP (10 nmol/rat) was significantly attenuated by subcutaneous pretreatment with propranolol and naloxone, but not phentolamine or methysergide, at a dose of 10 mg/kg. I.c.v. pretreatment with propranolol (100 nmol/rat), butoxamine (100 nmol/rat), ICI-I 18,551 (100 nmol/rat) and naloxone (30 nmol/rat) significantly attenuated the antinociceptive effect of alpha,beta-methylene-ATP. However, i.c.v. pretreatment with atenolol (100 nmol/rat), naltrindole (30 nmol/rat) or nor-binaltorphimine (30 nmol/rat) did not show any significant effects. These results suggest that supraspinal beta2-adrenergic and mu-opioid receptors are involved in the antinociceptive effect of i.c.v. administered alpha,beta-methylene-ATP.", 
    "170": "The author compares the results of MCOs that have publicly reported their Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS) rates for 1997 through 1999 with health plans that did not report publicly. Managed care plans that publicly reported for three consecutive years performed better on preventive health measures than those that did not. Newer measures, such as beta-blocker treatment after a heart attack, showed the greatest improvement over time. Health care plans rated high in consumer experience also had higher clinical performance rates. Finally, plans that sought accreditation by the National Committee for Quality Assurance had better performance on their HEDIS measures, although the differences narrowed for those reporting HEDIS rates for three consecutive years.", 
    "171": "This report reviews the efficacy of currently available antiarrhythmic agents for conversion of atrial fibrilation (AF) to normal sinus rhythm (NSR). A systematic search of literature in the English language was done on computerized databases, such as MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Current Contents, in reference lists, by manual searching, and in contact with expert informants. Published studies involving humans that described the use of antiarrhythmic therapy for conversion of AF to NSR were considered and only studies that examined the use of agents currently available in the United States were included. Studies exclusively describing antiarrhythmic therapy for conversion of postsurgical AF were excluded. The methodology and results of each trial were assessed and attempts were made to acquire additional information from investigators when needed. Assessment of methodological quality was incorporated into a levels-of-evidence scheme. Eighty-eight trials were included, of which 34 (39%) included a placebo group (level I data). We found in recent-onset AF of less than 7 days, intravenous (i.v.) procainamide, high-dose i.v. or high-dose combination i.v. and oral amiodarone, oral quinidine, oral flecainide, oral propafenone, and high-dose oral amiodarone are more effective than placebo for converting AF to NSR. In recent-onset AF of less than 90 days, i.v. ibutilide is more effective than placebo and i.v. procainamide. In chronic AF, oral dofetilide converts AF to NSR within 72 hours, and oral propafenone and amiodarone are effective after 30 days of therapy. We conclude than for conversion of recent-onset AF of less than 7 days, procainamide may be considered a preferred i.v. agent and propafenone a preferred oral agent. For conversion of recent-onset AF of longer duration (less than 90 days), i.v. ibutilide may be considered a preferred agent. For patients with chronic AF and left ventricular dysfunction, direct current cardioversion is the preferred conversion method. Larger, well-designed randomized controlled trials with clinically important endpoints in specific populations of AF patients are needed.", 
    "172": "Symptomatic involvement of the gastrointestinal tract in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is rare. Most reported complications in adults are caused by the presence of neurofibromas in the stomach, small bowel, or mesentery. In contrast, abdominal pain in children with NF1 may be the result of nonanatomic causes, such as migraine. There are no previous reports of an association between abdominal migraine and NF1.", 
    "173": "Children with abdominal migraine were identified from a group of children with NF1, all of whom had been followed up for a minimum of 3 years. Medical records of cases were reviewed independently by two authors. MEDLINE was searched via PubMed for all reports of children with NF1 and any associated gastrointestinal involvement.", 
    "174": "Six children with NF1 and intermittent, episodic, severe abdominal pain are reported. Investigations for obstructive or inflammatory causes of abdominal pain were negative. All patients had previously been diagnosed with migraine headaches by a neurologist. In five of the six patients, propranolol (10-15 mg three times daily) resulted in relief of their abdominal pain within days of starting therapy. Our review identified 24 children in the medical literature with gastrointestinal complications of NF1, mostly secondary to visceral neurofibromas. In almost all of these cases, clinical examination and simple radiologic investigations led to the definitive diagnosis. There were no reports of abdominal migraine complicating NF1.", 
    "175": "Abdominal pain secondary to migraine is an unrecognized cause of abdominal pain in children with NF1 and may be more common than anatomic causes of abdominal pain in children with NF1. In children with NF1 and severe recurrent abdominal pain in whom an evaluation for anatomic lesions is negative, a trial of migraine therapy may be indicated.", 
    "176": "There is little information regarding the effect of hypoxia on alveolar fluid clearance capacity. We measured alveolar fluid clearance, lung water volume, plasma catecholamine concentrations, and serum osmolality in rats exposed to 10% oxygen for up to 120 h and explored the mechanisms responsible for the increase in alveolar fluid clearance. The principal results were 1) alveolar fluid clearance did not change for 48 h and then increased between 72 and 120 h of exposure to hypoxia; 2) although nutritional impairment during hypoxia decreased basal alveolar fluid clearance, endogenous norepinephrine increased net alveolar fluid clearance; 3) the changes of lung water volume and serum osmolality were not associated with those of alveolar fluid clearance; 4) an administration of beta-adrenergic agonists further increased alveolar fluid clearance; and 5) alveolar fluid clearance returned to normal within 24 h of reoxygenation after hypoxia. In conclusion, alveolar epithelial fluid transport capacity increases in rats exposed to hypoxia. It is likely that a combination of endogenous norepinephrine and nutritional impairment regulates alveolar fluid clearance under hypoxic conditions.", 
    "177": "The response to beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) stimulation was evaluated in both isolated cardiomyocytes (video edge detection) and the intact animal (echocardiography) in dogs either susceptible (S) or resistant (R) to ventricular fibrillation induced by a 2-min coronary occlusion during the last minute of exercise. In the intact animal, velocity of circumferential fiber shortening (Vcf) was evaluated both before (n = 27, S = 12 and R = 15) and after myocardial infarction. Before infarction, increasing doses of isoproterenol provoked similar contractile and heart rate responses in each group of dogs. Either beta(1)-AR (bisoprolol) or beta(2)-AR (ICI-118551) antagonists reduced the isoproterenol response, with a larger reduction noted after the beta(1)-AR blockade. In contrast, after infarction, isoproterenol induced a significantly larger Vcf and heart rate response in the susceptible animals that was eliminated by beta(2)-AR blockade. The single-cell isotonic shortening response to isoproterenol (100 nM) was also larger in cells obtained from susceptible compared with resistant dogs and was reduced to a greater extent by beta(2)-AR blockade in the susceptible dog myocytes (S, -48%, n = 6; R, -15%, n = 9). When considered together, these data suggest that myocardial infarction provoked an enhanced beta(2)-AR response in susceptible, but not resistant, animals.", 
    "178": "Cardiac dysfunction after brain death has been documented, but its mechanisms remain unclear. Myocardial ischemia has been suggested as a possible cause. The aim of the present study was to investigate the existence of an imbalance between myocardial oxygen delivery and demand as a possible cause of myocardial dysfunction in brain-dead pigs.", 
    "179": "Interstitial myocardial lactate and adenosine concentrations were assessed with cardiac microdialysis in 2 groups of animals: brain-dead pigs (n=7) and brain-dead pigs treated with labetalol (10+/-3 mg/kg) (n=7). Heart rate (HR), left ventricular (LV) dP/dt(max), rate-pressure product (RPP), cardiac output (CO), and left anterior descending coronary artery blood flow (QLAD) were continuously monitored. Brain-dead pigs exhibited a transient significant increase in HR, LV dP/dt(max), RPP, and CO and a limited increase in QLAD. This resulted in functional myocardial ischemia attested to by the significantly increased adenosine and lactate microdialysate concentrations. In brain-dead pigs treated with labetalol, there was a moderate increase in HR, QLAD, and adenosine microdialysate concentrations; LV dP/dt(max), RPP, CO, and myocardial lactate concentrations remained stable, confirming the preservation of aerobic metabolism.", 
    "180": "Brain death was associated with an increase in myocardial interstitial adenosine and lactate concentrations, as well as with myocardial dysfunction; all were attenuated by labetalol, suggesting an imbalance between oxygen consumption and oxygen delivery as a possible cause of myocardial dysfunction after brain death.", 
    "181": "Potential intrinsic activating properties are probably the most controversially discussed issues with respect to GP IIb/IIIa blockers, especially since clinical trials with oral GP IIb/IIIa blockers revealed disappointing results. Based on the finding that currently clinically used GP IIb/IIIa blockers are ligand mimetics, experimental data are discussed, demonstrating an intrinsic activating effect of ligand mimetic GP IIb/IIIa blockers that potentially results in fibrinogen binding to alpha(IIb)beta(3) and in platelet aggregation. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of aspirin on GP IIb/IIIa blocker-induced platelet aggregation is discussed as a clinically relevant finding. Finally, the potential association of GP IIb/IIIa blocker-induced thrombocytopenia with platelet activation is described.", 
    "182": "Obesity has been shown to be an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease. The insulin resistance associated with obesity contributes to the development of other cardiovascular risk factors, including dyslipidemia, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. The coexistence of hypertension and diabetes increases the risk for macrovascular and microvascular complications, thus predisposing patients to cardiac death, congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease, cerebral and peripheral vascular diseases, nephropathy, and retinopathy. Body weight reduction increases insulin sensitivity and improves both blood glucose and blood pressure control. Metformin therapy also improves insulin sensitivity and has been associated with decreases in cardiovascular events in obese diabetic patients. Antihypertensive treatment in diabetics decreases cardiovascular mortality and slows the decline in glomerular function. However, pharmacological treatment should take into account the effects of the antihypertensive agents on insulin sensitivity and lipid profile. Diuretics and beta-blockers are reported to reduce insulin sensitivity and increase triglyceride levels, whereas calcium channel blockers are metabolically neutral and ACE inhibitors increase insulin sensitivity. For the high-risk hypertensive diabetic patients, ACE inhibition has proven to confer additional renal and vascular protection. Because hypertension and glycemic control are very important determinants of cardiovascular outcome in obese diabetic hypertensive patients, weight reduction, physical exercise, and a combination of antihypertensive and insulin sensitizers agents are strongly recommended to achieve target blood pressure and glucose levels."
