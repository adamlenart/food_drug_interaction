Unlike other calcium antagonists, detailed pharmacokinetic data are available for verapamil. Plasma concentrations of verapamil appear to correlate with both electrophysiological and haemodynamic activity after either intravenous or oral drug administration, although considerable intra- and intersubject variation has been found in the intensity of pharmacological effects resulting at specific plasma drug levels. Verapamil is widely distributed throughout body tissues; animal studies suggest that drug distribution to target organs and tissues is different with parenteral administration from that found after oral administration. The drug is eliminated by hepatic metabolism, with excretion of inactive products in the urine and/or faeces. An N-demethylated metabolite, norverapamil, has been shown to have a fraction of the vasodilator effect of the parent compound in in vitro studies. After intravenous administration, the systemic clearance of verapamil appears to approach liver blood flow. The high hepatic extraction results in low systemic bioavailability (20%) after oral drug administration. Multicompartmental kinetics are observed after single doses; accumulation occurs during multiple-dose oral administration with an associated decrease in apparent oral clearance. Norverapamil plasma concentrations approximate those of verapamil following single or multiple oral doses of the parent drug. Because of the complex pharmacokinetics associated with multiple-dose administration and the variation in individual patient responsiveness to the drug, 'standard' dosing recommendations are difficult to determine; use of verapamil must be titrated to a clinical end-point. Further, the potential for alteration in verapamil's disposition by the presence of hepatic dysfunction or cardiovascular disorders which result in altered hepatic blood flow is only now becoming apparent. A potentially toxic interaction has been reported between verapamil and digoxin, in which renal excretion of the glycoside is impaired, but the true clinical significance of this remains debatable. Combination therapy with verapamil and beta-adrenoceptor blocking compounds has been advocated by some investigators, but may be hazardous because of the additive negative inotropic and chronotropic effects inherent in both agents.", 
    "1": "A 53-year-old woman with nephroptosis and aortitis disease was found also to have orthostatic hypertension. When standing, she had high renin levels and normal catecholamine values, with a reduced baroreflex sensitivity. This orthostatic hypertension largely may be due to an activation of the renin system caused by nephroptosis and partly due to a reduced baroreflex sensitivity caused by aortitis. Captopril and propranolol hydrochloride were effective for the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "2": "Exercise tolerance 1, 3 and 8 hours after 80 mg of propranolol, 120 mg of diltiazem and 20 mg of nifedipine, and after 20 minutes of 0.6 mg of sublingual nitroglycerin were compared with placebo in 15 men who had chronic stable angina pectoris. Three hours after drug ingestion, the exercise time was prolonged by 72 +/- 26, 162 +/- 27 and 161 +/- 30 seconds (p less than 0.05) for propranolol, diltiazem and nifedipine, respectively, and by 123 +/- 35 seconds (p less than 0.001) 20 minutes after sublingual nitroglycerin compared with placebo. The onset of ST-segment depression greater than or equal to 0.1 mV was delayed by 120 +/- 34, 203 +/- 29 and 189 +/- 35 seconds (p less than 0.05) and by 79 +/- 23 seconds (p less than 0.05), respectively. After propranolol, the peak rate-pressure product decreased compared with placebo (15.1 +/- 1.1 U [10(-3)] vs 20.0 +/- 1.5 U, p less than 0.01). In contrast, the peak rate-pressure product was greater after diltiazem and nifedipine than after placebo (22.2 +/- 1.3 U [p less than 0.05] and 23.8 +/- 1.4 U [p less than 0.01]). The maximal increase in exercise tolerance was most marked for each drug at 3 hours, but was also significant at 1 hour for nifedipine and at 8 hours for diltiazem. At 3 hours, an increase in exercise time of more than 2 minutes was observed in 4 of 6 patients who had plasma propranolol concentrations greater than 40 ng/ml, 8 of 9 who had a plasma diltiazem concentration greater than 150 ng/ml, and in 7 of 7 who had a plasma nifedipine concentration greater than 90 ng/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "3": "The effects of different types of adrenoreceptor blocking agents on portal venous pressure were studied in patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Oral atenolol (selective beta 1 blocker), propranolol (non-selective beta 1 and beta 2 blocker), and prazosin (alpha blocker) were compared in three groups of eight patients. Haemodynamic measurements were made before and after two or three and eight weeks of therapy. The dose of beta blockers was sufficient to reduce the exercise heart rate by more than 25%. Propranolol and prazosin produced a sustained reduction in the mean portohepatic venous pressure gradient of the order of 25% and 18% respectively. The cardiac index was significantly reduced by propranolol but not altered by prazosin. Atenolol produced an early reduction in portohepatic venous pressure which, although not sustained, showed a good correlation with reduction in cardiac index. No such relationship was found with propranolol. All three drugs were well tolerated by these patients with advanced cirrhosis. Therefore propranolol and prazosin have proved to be effective agents for the reduction of portal venous pressure.", 
    "4": "Atrial homografts from newborn hamsters, transplanted into cheek pouches of adult Syrian golden hamsters, were studied using intravital and electron microscopy. Half of the transplants survived up to 1 year, performing spontaneous pulsatile activity. The transplants could be influenced by beta-receptor activating or blocking substances applied intravenously to the host animal. For morphological analysis homografts were taken 3, 6, and 12 months after transplantation. Irregular arrangement of the myofibers occurred, and the T system was seen to be replaced by plasmalemmal and sub-plasmalemmal vesiculations. There was some evidence for hypoxia in the grafts. Dedifferentiation of atrial cardiocytes, somehow resembling smooth muscle cells, is discussed. Despite these morphological changes the specific contractile function of the grafts was preserved.", 
    "5": "Systemic and splanchnic hemodynamics, renal blood flow, and renal function were studied in 13 patients with cirrhosis both before and 1 h after oral administration of 40 mg of propranolol (acute administration) and 1 mo after continuous administration of this substance at doses reducing the heart rate by 25% (chronic administration). Cardiac output and the gradient between wedged and free hepatic venous pressures significantly decreased after acute and chronic administration of propranolol; mean arterial pressure did not change significantly and systemic vascular resistance significantly increased. Renal blood flow and renal vascular resistance did not change significantly after acute administration of propranolol and renal function did not change significantly after acute or chronic administration of propranolol. We conclude that propranolol does not alter renal function in patients with cirrhosis who are in good physical condition.", 
    "6": "The effects of hypotonic solution on the mechanical activities and action potential of the bullfrog atrium were investigated. Exposure of muscle to hypotonic solutions (70% of normal solution) produced initially a transient increase in twitch after which twitch declined below the control level. The response is independent of the kinds of salts withdrawn to make the medium hypotonic and of the presence of beta-blocker (5 X 10(-7) M propranolol). The resting potential and the plateau level of action potential were little changed initially. When the twitch declined, a small amount of depolarization and a shortening of action potential duration were observed; however, the plateau level of action potential was not reduced. The initial increase in twitch was not observed, and only the gradual decline of twitch remained in the caffeine containing hypotonic solution. The weight of muscle increased 10% in the hypotonic solution. The resting tension was also increased transiently and then declined to reach a maintained plateau with exposure to hypotonic solution. In the 0-Ca2+ or caffeine containing medium, the transient component of contracture was suppressed but the plateau tension remained. It is suggested that the initial transient increase of twitch by the perfusion of the hypotonic solution was induced by the Ca2+ released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), and the resultant decline of twitch resulted from the depletion of Ca2+ from the SR and/or from the shortening of action potential duration.", 
    "7": "In 194 patients with inferior wall acute myocardial infarction (MI) defined from ECG, the initial ST elevation and final Q- and R-wave changes in leads II, III and aVF were related to peak serum enzyme (heat stable lactate dehydrogenase) activity. Positive correlations were observed between initial ST elevation and peak LD (r = 0.54; p less than 0.001) and between peak LD and the final Q- and R-wave changes (r = 0.45; p less than 0.001). Peak LD activity was strongly related to the incidence and severity of congestive heart failure, and to mortality after 90 days and 2 years. A similar relationship could not be demonstrated between ECG findings and clinical outcome.", 
    "8": "The effect of beta-blockade on dipyridamole thallium-201 images was assessed in 8 patients with coronary artery disease and positive dipyridamole test. Three dipyridamole thallium-201 tests were performed, the first in basal conditions, the second 30' after propranolol and the third with propranolol and atrial pacing. After dipyridamole heart rate and double product increased respectively from 75 +/- 7 to 98 +/- 15 b/min (p less than 0.01 vs starting values) and from 10 551 +/- 1255 to 11 740 +/- 4542 mmHg X b/min (p less than 0.05 vs starting values). Propranolol reduced heart rate to 64 +/- 6 b/min (p less than 0.05 vs basal conditions), systolic blood pressure to 136 +/- 13 and double product to 8733 +/- 1248 (p less than 0.05 vs basal conditions). Dipyridamole when infused after propranolol, induced an increase in heart rate to 70 +/- 5 b/min (p less than 0.05 vs starting values) while double product was 9133 +/- 1189 mmHg X b/min (p = NS vs starting values). Atrial pacing prevented the fall in heart rate and double product induced by propranolol so during dipyridamole infusion double product increased to 13 271 +/- 1868 (p less than 0.05 vs propranolol treatment; p less than 0.05 vs starting values). Segmental score calculated after dipyridamole was 5.2 +/- 2.0 in basal conditions, 5.1 +/- 1.3 after propranolol (p = NS) and 4.8 +/- 1.3 after propranolol plus atrial pacing (p = NS). Thus the results of the study show that beta-blockade does not worsen dipyridamole thallium-201 images. Furthermore the steal phenomenon seems to be the main mechanism of the dipyridamole induced ischemia. In fact, also when the increase, oxygen consumption is blunted with beta-blockade the disparity in myocardial blood flow resulted unaffected.", 
    "9": "The present study reports on the interaction between the non-steroidal antiinflammatory agents pirprofen (Rengasil) and indomethacin with the antihypertensive effects of oxprenolol and the natriuretic effects of furosemide. Pirprofen did not attenuate the antihypertensive action of oxprenolol nor did it reduce the natriuretic activity of furosemide. When indomethacin was given to the same patients an attenuation of oxprenolol's antihypertensive action was observed in four out of seven patients. Furosemide's effects were not affected. It is suggested that there are responders and non-responders to that drug interaction which is also supported by previously published work. During this study clinical-chemical and hematological parameters were also monitored. There were no changes caused by pirprofen indicating the safety of this new compound. For clinical purposes these data suggest that pirprofen--in contrast to indomethacin--can be safely coadministered with beta-blockers and probably other antihypertensive agents.", 
    "10": "The clinical, electrocardiographic, pharmacologic, electrophysiologic and Holter monitoring findings are described in four patients with autonomic sinus node dysfunction and one patient with autonomic binodal disease. All showed cerebral symptoms, and had attacks of dizziness, weakness, near-syncope or syncope. After a pharmacologic autonomic blockade with propranolol and atropine, all patients had normal intrinsic heart rates. Electrophysiological studies revealed normal corrected intrinsic node recovery time (less than or equal to 240 msec) a gradual return to the basic cycle length in the secondary postpacing cycles after autonomic blockade, and no intrinsic paroxysmal atrioventricular block. Continuous ECG monitoring (1-3 X 24 hours) revealed severe sinus bradycardia, SA-block, severe sinus arrest, cardiac standstill, atrial fibrillation and in two patients associated AV-block. Autonomic blockade with electrophysiological studies exclude the intrinsic involvement of the sinoatrial and atrioventricular node. Holter monitoring is the best method for assessing the autonomic neurovegetative component of dysrhythmias. Therapy regarding isolated autonomic sinus node dysfunction depended on the pathomechanisms of rhythm disorders: two patients received permanent pacemakers, antiarrhythmic drugs were applied in the case of two patients, and etiological treatment in the case of one. During the follow-up, all patients became symptom-free.", 
    "11": "Forty cardiac pacing threshold studies were conducted in 20 patients during temporary pacing prior to permanent pacemaker implantation using the following intravenously administered anti-arrhythmic drugs: Lignocaine 2 mg/kg (10 patients), mexiletine 5 mg/kg (5 patients), ajmaline 1 mg/kg (5 patients), verapamil 0.15 mg/kg (10 patients) and propranolol 0.1 mg/kg (10 patients). Changes in voltage (volts), current (mA), energy (micro-joules) and resistance (ohms), were measured using a pacemaker system analyzer at a constant pulse width (0.6 msec) and pacing rate (70/minute). Lignocaine increased the voltage threshold significantly (p less than 0.05) with insignificant (p greater than 0.05) change in current, energy and resistance. Mexiletine and ajmaline significantly (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.02) increased the voltage and current thresholds but did not change the energy level and resistance (p greater less 0.05). Verapamil caused a significant increase in the current and energy threshold (p less than 0.05), without changing the voltage threshold significantly (p greater than 0.05). The resistance values showed a consistently decreasing trend. Propranolol on the other hand did not affect any parameter significantly (p greater than 0.05). Anti-arrhythmic drugs appear to produce variable effects on different pacing threshold parameters. This has important clinical implications.", 
    "12": "Effects of 3,4-dihydro-6-[4-(3,4- dimethoxybenzoyl )-1-piperazinyl]-2(1H)- qu inolinone ( OPC -8212) on the isolated guinea-pig ventricular myocardium was studied measuring the force of contraction and action potential under various experimental conditions. The positive inotropic effect (PIE) of OPC -8212 was observed at a concentration higher than 10(-5) mol/l. The following circumstantial evidence led to the conclusion that OPC -8212 caused an elevated cyclic AMP level in myocardial cells thereby producing the positive inotropic effect. The positive inotropic effect of OPC -8212 was unaffected by reserpinization, propranolol and cimetidine treatments. OPC -8212 strengthened the slow response of partially depolarized papillary muscle. This suggested an increased calcium influx across myocardial cell membrane. Carbachol inhibited the positive inotropic effect of OPC -8212 on ventricular myocardium. Concentration-effect curves for isoprenaline (isoproterenol) and histamine were shifted to the left but that for dihydro-ouabain was not affected at all by OPC -8212. Rested-state contraction of guinea-pig papillary muscle was strengthened by OPC -8212 the same as dibutyryl cyclic AMP and beta-agonists.", 
    "13": "The cardiovascular effects of 3,4-dihydro-6-[4-(3,4- dimethoxybenzoyl )-1-piperazinyl]-2(1H)- qu inolinone ( OPC -8212) were investigated in isolated ventricular muscles of various mammalian species, anaesthetized dogs and conscious dogs. In the isolated ventricular muscles of the dog, cat, rabbit and guinea pig, OPC -8212 (3 X 10(-6)-3 X 10(-4) mol/l) increased the developed tension in a concentration-related manner and these positive inotropic effects of OPC -8212 were 1/140-1/120 those of dobutamine but 5-17 times and 8-25 times those of amrinone and theophylline, respectively. The positive inotropic effect of OPC -8212 was not modified by pindolol or phentolamine. In the isolated rat ventricular muscle, OPC -8212, amrinone and theophylline exerted no positive inotropic effect, although dobutamine did. In anaesthetized dogs, OPC -8212 (0.1-3 mg/kg i.v.) was nearly as active as amrinone in producing an increase in left ventricular contractile force. However, OPC -8212 was much less active than amrinone in increasing heart rate and decreasing blood pressure. In conscious dogs OPC -8212 at doses of 1 and 3 mg/kg i.v. increased peak LV dP/dt by 27% and 59%, respectively, without significant changes in heart rate and blood pressure. OPC -8212 did not affect the dog heart Na+,K+-ATPase activity. These results suggest the following: (1) OPC -8212 has a mechanism of action different from those of catecholamines and cardiac glycosides, (2) it has a useful profile in the treatment of heart failure because it caused a selective positive inotropic effect with no obvious positive chronotropic and vascular effects.", 
    "14": "The experimental results discussed in this paper provide evidence that antidepressant-induced attenuation of the NE receptor-coupled adenylate cyclase system in brain and the down-regulation of its beta adrenoceptor subpopulation result in a net deamplification of the NE signal. The desensitization of the NE receptor system requires an unhindered occupancy of the receptor by the agonist NE. Following adrenalectomy, the non-beta population of NE receptors coupled to adenylate cyclase shows an enhanced response to NE without changes in the activity of adenylate cyclase or phosphodiesterase. This supersensitivity to NE can be prevented by corticosterone. The synaptic availability of 5HT is co-required for the down-regulation by DMI-like drugs of the density of beta adrenoceptors. Moreover, beta adrenoceptors from tissue deprived of serotonergic neuronal input display a marked decrease in agonist affinity as determined from competition binding of (-)-isoproterenol for [3H]dihydroalprenolol. Using NE as an agonist, competition binding curves with membrane preparations from cortical tissue lacking 5HT input show low affinity binding of the receptor for NE that cannot be further modified by guanine nucleotides. The reduction in beta adrenoceptor agonist affinity following reduction of the synaptic availability of 5HT is accentuated by chronic administration of DMI or zimelidine. The new experimental data on the biomolecular linkage between serotonergic and noradrenergic neurons, expressed functionally at the level of NE receptors, provide the scientific basis for a \"serotonin-norepinephrine link hypothesis\" of affective disorders. The pursuit of studies on the molecular mechanisms of the action of steroid hormones on central NE receptor systems and on mechanisms underlying the functional 5HT-NE linkage and its modification by antidepressants should generate a deeper understanding of neuronal signal processing in brain.", 
    "15": "In order to elucidate the importance of adrenergic beta receptors in the regulation of cerebral microcirculation during arterial hypoxia, chloralose anaesthetized cats were treated with propranolol hydrochloride. Arterial hypoxia, lasting for approximately 4 min, was induced by respiring the animals with a gas mixture containing 7% oxygen balanced in nitrogen gas. Arterial hypoxia was induced in the same animals before and during continuous infusion of propranolol (0.05 mg/kg/min into the lingual artery). Cerebrocortical vascular volume ( CVV ) and NADH fluorescence were measured through a cranial window with a microscope fluororeflectometer . Control arterial hypoxia (no treatment) increased CVV and NADH reduction by 22.2 +/- 2% and 20.4 +/- 2.1%, respectively. Following 1 mg/kg propranolol treatment arterial hypoxia of the same severity resulted in only approximately 2/3 of the CVV response obtained during the control arterial hypoxia. Since arterial hypoxia induced similar changes in arterial blood gases, arterial blood pressure, and intracranial pressure in both cases, our results indicate that the cortical vasodilatation occurring during arterial hypoxia is due, at least in part, to the activation of adrenergic beta receptors.", 
    "16": "The post-training administration of ACTH1-24 (0.2 microgram/kg), human beta-endorphin (1.0 microgram/kg) or epinephrine HC1 (5.0 micrograms/kg), intraperitoneally, caused retrograde amnesia for a step-down inhibitory avoidance task in rats, and their pre-testing administration reversed this effect. The concomitant administration of the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor blocker, yohimbine HC1 (2.0 mg/kg), antagonized both the post-training amnestic and the pre-testing anti-amnestic effects of the three substances. The anti-amnestic effect of epinephrine, but not that of ACTH or beta-endorphin, was also antagonized by the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor blocker, prazosin HC1 (2.0 mg/kg). These findings suggest that alpha 2-adrenergic receptors are involved both in the amnestic and in the anti-amnestic effect of ACTH, beta-endorphin and epinephrine at the doses used, and that, in the case of the anti-amnestic effect of epinephrine, alpha 1 receptors also are involved. It seems likely that memory regulation by post-training and pre-testing ACTH and beta-endorphin requires the concomitant activity of alpha 2-adrenergic mechanisms, either central or peripheral.", 
    "17": "In particular membrane fractions of human and rabbit oviductal smooth muscle specific binding sites for the radiolabelled beta-adrenergic antagonist [125I]- cyanopindolol (I- CYP ) were detectable utilizing the radioligand technique. The binding was saturable, relative to the concentration of protein as well as ligand in the assay. The analysis of the binding kinetics by Scatchard plots revealed a number of beta-adrenergic receptor sites of 30 fmol I- CYP bound per milligram protein with a dissociation constant (KD) of 20 pM. In competition binding studies with beta 2-adrenergic agonists and antagonists the receptors in their pharmacological range corresponded to the beta 2-subtype of beta-adrenergic receptors. Within the oviduct the ampulla possessed 70% of all traceable beta-adrenergic receptor sites.", 
    "18": "It has been proposed that reduced beta-adrenergic responsiveness plays an important role in the increased airway reactivity of asthmatic patients. This hypothesis has been supported by studies showing reduced beta-adrenergic responsiveness in lymphocytes of asthmatic patients, predominantly during the occurrence of active and severe symptoms. Little is known about the mechanism underlying this relationship and its clinical relevance with respect to bronchial hyperreactivity. Therefore, in this study we assessed the status of the beta-adrenergic receptor-adenylate cyclase system in lymphocytes of allergic asthmatic patients in relation to parameters of bronchial hyperreactivity. This was performed before and after challenge with house-dust mite allergen, as a possible modulating factor of beta-adrenergic responsiveness. It was shown that lymphocytes of 'stable' allergic asthmatic patients with increased airway reactivity may have normal beta-adrenergic responsiveness and a normal beta-adrenergic receptor number. After allergen challenge, however, a group of 12 patients developed reduced beta-adrenergic responsiveness, which could be partially attributed to changes in the beta-adrenergic receptor number, while changes distal to the receptor also occurred. The results indicate that reduced beta-adrenergic responsiveness in lymphocytes of allergic asthmatic patients is a consequence of an active disease state rather than the reflection of a primary aetiological factor. A number of the patients concomitantly developed enhanced bronchial reactivity to propranolol after allergen challenge, which might indicate that reduced beta-adrenergic receptor function also occurs at the level of the bronchial tree. In five of the patients it was shown that beta-adrenergic hyporesponsiveness could be restored after environmental control in combination with drug treatment, thus indicating the dynamic character of the lymphocyte beta-adrenergic receptor system in asthmatic patients.", 
    "19": "The binding of the radiolabelled beta-antagonist 3H-DHA to membranes prepared from bovine lung was examined. Three methods for determining the NSB of this ligand (200 microM of (-)-isoprenaline, 10 microM of (-)-propranolol and 10 microM of (-)-alprenolol) were investigated. In experiments designed to measure the Kd and Bmax of 3H-DHA to bovine lung membranes these three methods were not equivalent. (-)-Isoprenaline gave lower estimates of the Kd and Bmax than did (-)-propranolol, which in turn gave lower estimates than (-)-alprenolol. Critical examination of the characteristics of the binding of these three compounds using competition experiments showed that, at the concentrations used, an interaction of (-)-propranolol and (-)-alprenolol with both the receptor and the NSB site was responsible for the observed differences. This result was confirmed by a theoretical consideration of the binding reactions involved. Furthermore, these theoretical studies also revealed other potential problems arising from incorrect NSB measurement, which, if not appreciated, can cause serious misinterpretation of the nature of the receptor-ligand interactions.", 
    "20": "The protective effects of oxyphenonium bromide, terbutaline and theophylline were compared in 8 asthmatic patients by determination of the degree of non-specific airway reactivity after 1 week of oral treatment according to a fixed dose scheme in a double-blind random order: oxyphenonium bromide 3 X 10 mg; terbutaline 3 X 5 mg; theophylline 2 X 300 mg and placebo. Controlled, standardized inhalation provocation tests were carried out with histamine, acetylcholine and propranolol. The study was monitored by measuring blood concentrations of the 3 drugs, and their effect on the plasma cAMP concentration was also determined. Significant protection by oxyphenonium bromide against the bronchial obstructive effects of acetylcholine and propranolol was observed, but not against the effect of inhaled histamine. The other two drugs provided no significant protection against the inhaled agents. The absence of any protective effect of terbutaline and theophylline might have resulted from too low a blood concentration. The observed differences in protection could not be explained by changes in pulmonary function. The study suggests dissociation between the bronchodilating effect of a drug and its protective effect against inhaled substances.", 
    "21": "The extent to which the serum potassium rose in a group of six healthy volunteers during an intra-venous infusion of potassium was identical following pretreatment with placebo, low or high dose propranolol and low or high dose metoprolol. Thus in this acute study, we were unable to demonstrate any influence of either selective or non-selective beta adrenergic blockade upon potassium uptake mechanisms. This is in contrast to the effects of beta blockers on potassium reuptake rates noted after exercise and during cardiac surgery.", 
    "22": "The amount of specific (-)-3H-dihydroalprenolol binding sites in the crude membranes of brown adipose tissue is constant in the course of postnatal development of the rat. Contrarily, the activity of the isoprenaline and fluoride-stimulated adenylate cyclase undergoes rather pronounced changes with maximum enzyme activity measured shortly after birth and minimum activity between the 10th and 20th day. These data may be interpreted to mean that the binding and catalytical moiety of the beta-adrenergic receptor complex represents two functionally distinct entities which develop independently of each other.", 
    "23": "The dependence of intact noradrenergic and serotonergic nerve terminals for the decrease in the number of beta-adrenoceptors and 5-HT2 binding sites in the cerebral cortex produced by long-term treatment of rats with antidepressant drugs was examined. Noradrenergic nerve terminals were destroyed with the selective noradrenaline neurotoxin DSP4, and serotonergic nerve terminals were destroyed with p-chloroamphetamine (PCA). It was found that lesioning of the noradrenergic nerve terminals abolished the decrease in beta-adrenoceptors produced by desipramine, mianserin and zimeldine and partially antagonized that of the beta-adrenoceptor agonist clenbuterol. PCA pretreatment did not antagonize the long-term effects on the beta-adrenoceptor produced by these compounds. Lesioning of serotonergic nerve terminals affected the down-regulation of 5-HT2 binding sites produced by long-term treatment with mianserin, desipramine and amiflamine. DSP4 pretreatment partially abolished the down-regulation of 5-HT2 binding sites produced by long-term treatment with desipramine, while the effects of mianserin and amiflamine were unaffected by pretreatment with DSP4.", 
    "24": "The effect of thyroid status on noradrenergic synaptic function in the mature rat brain was examined by measuring presynaptic alpha 2- and post-synaptic beta-adrenoceptors. Repeated triiodothyronine (T3) administration to rats (100 micrograms/kg X 14 days: hyperthyroid) caused an 18% increase in striatal beta-adrenoceptors as shown by [3H]-dihydroalprenolol binding with no change in membranes from cerebral cortex or hypothalamus. In contrast, hypothyroidism (propylthiouracil, PTU X 14 days) produced significant 12% and 30% reductions in striatal and hypothalamic beta-adrenoceptors respectively with no change in the cerebral cortex. Presynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptor function was measured in the two dysthyroid states using the clonidine-induced hypoactivity model. Experimental hyperthyroidism increased the degree of clonidine-induced hypoactivity, and suggests increased presynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptor function compared with control rats, whereas hypothyroidism suppressed presynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptor function. These results show firstly that changes in thyroid status in the mature rat may produce homeostatic alterations at central noradrenergic synapses as reflected by changes in pre- and post-synaptic adrenoceptor function. Secondly, there appear to be T3-induced changes in beta-adrenoceptors in the striatum where changes in dopaminergic neuronal activity have previously been demonstrated.", 
    "25": "Several investigators have confirmed that beta-adrenergic blocking agents produced a sustained pressor action in anesthetized rats. In this experiment, rat hindquarters were perfused with the rat's own blood under a constant perfusion rate. The effect of propranolol administered intraarterially to the hindquarters was studied. Propranolol (0.001--0.1 mg/ml, 5 microliter intraarterial injection) produced a sustained rise in the perfusion pressure dose-dependently. In contrast, propranolol did not produce any sustained rise in the perfusion pressure of guinea pigs and rabbits. These results support that the beta-adrenoceptive vasodilation in skeletal muscle is stronger in rats than in guinea pigs and rabbits.", 
    "26": "The characteristics of the beta-adrenoceptors (3H-dihydroalprenolol binding) and the beta-adrenergic responsiveness (cyclic AMP response to isoproterenol) were studied in circulating lymphocytes from healthy volunteers before (D 0), on the 22nd day of treatment (D 22) and on the fifth day (D 30) following discontinuation of pindolol 15 mg/day or propranolol 160 mg/day. During pindolol therapy (D 22) the beta-adrenoceptor-affinity towards dihydroalprenolol was unchanged and the beta-adrenoceptor density decreased by 50%, an effect which persisted after drug administration ceased (D 30). The receptor \"down-regulation\" was accompanied by a parallel decrease in the maximal lymphocyte response to isoproterenol on D 22 and 30, by a shift to the right of the concentration-response curves to isoproterenol on D 22 and 30. In contrast, no significant modification in beta-adrenoceptor density or in the maximal response to isoproterenol was observed during (D 22) or after discontinuation (D 30) or propranolol therapy; the beta-adrenoceptor affinity for dihydroalprenolol and the sensitivity of the lymphocyte response to isoproterenol were markedly reduced on D 22 but not on D 30. It is concluded that the lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptor \"down regulation\" and the parallel beta-adrenergic desensitization induced by chronic pindolol therapy are both due to the intrinsic sympathomimetic activity of this drug.",

    "28": "The effects of procedures which diminish Ca2+ influx into myocardial cells on responses of isolated cardiac preparations to cAMP-independent histamine H1 receptor stimulation and cAMP-generating beta-receptor stimulation were measured. The histamine response of guinea pig left atria, which appears to be primarily mediated by H1 receptors, was depressed to a greater extent than was the response of this preparation to isoproterenol by decreasing the extracellular Ca2+ concentration, and by the Ca2+ influx blocker D-600. Similarly, while the H1 agonist 2-pyridylethylamine dihydrochloride (PEA) produced increases in tension of a similar magnitude as the partial beta-agonist salbutamol in both left atria and in papillary muscles, responses of both preparations to PEA were depressed to a significantly greater extent by decreasing the extracellular Ca2+ concentration than were responses to salbutamol. Overall, both the basal developed force of papillary muscles and the responses of these preparations to H1 and beta-receptor stimulation appeared to be less depressed by decreasing the extracellular Ca2+ concentration than were those of left atria. These results indicate that responses mediated via cAMP-independent H1 receptors, like those arising from alpha-receptor stimulation, are more sensitive to procedures which diminish Ca2+ influx than are responses arising from stimulation of cAMP-generating beta-receptors. This may reflect differences in the mechanisms by which stimulation of H1, alpha-, and beta-receptors give rise to positive inotropic responses. In addition, left atria may be more dependent than papillary muscles on extracellular Ca2+ for the support of contraction.", 
    "29": "In Rat, neonatal lesion of the locus coeruleus induces modifications of beta-adrenergic regulations at the level of raphe dorsalis neurons. In normal conditions, the firing of serotoninergic raphe cells is not beta-adrenergic dependent. On the contrary in the lesioned animal, iontophoresis of a beta-blocking agent (DL-propranolol) produces a marked inhibition of the serotoninergic unit firing. Various mechanisms may account for this pharmacological response in the lesioned group: a classical hypersensitivity phenomenon, or the persistence of an immature regulation.", 
    "30": "The central effect of the Ca++ binding protein, calmodulin (CaM) on spontaneous feeding as well as on core temperature was examined in the satiated cat in which chronically indwelling cannulae were permanently implanted for intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion. When CaM was injected ICV in doses of 2.5-10.0 micrograms, the intake of food was significantly enhanced in the satiated cat without any notable change in the animal's core temperature. Ca++ ions infused similarly in a solution of 6.25-25.0 mM also augmented the spontaneous ingestion of food, which was accompanied by a concentration-related decline in core temperature. When infused separately, neither CaM in a low dose (1.25 micrograms) nor Ca++ ions (3.0 mM) given ICV altered the intake of food of the satiated cat. However, the simultaneous infusion of CaM and Ca in these concentrations enhanced significantly the amount of food consumed by as much as 60 g. When the same concentration of Ca++ ions was infused ICV simultaneously with 5.0 micrograms troponin C, a Ca++ binding protein of an identical molecular weight, the intake of food was unaltered. Further, the spontaneous feeding induced by CaM could be attenuated either by the central chelation of Ca++ ions by 1.0-1.5 mM EGTA or by 30 micrograms calcineurin, a specific CaM inhibitor, when either was given ICV. Pre-treatment of the cat with ICV phentolamine (50 micrograms) also reduced the CaM-induced feeding response significantly, whereas the similar pre-treatment with ICV propranolol (50 micrograms) or naloxone (100 micrograms) failed to affect CaM-induced feeding behavior.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "31": "In experiments with 216 male rats emotional-painful stress impaired distinctly the oxidative phosphorylation and Ca2+ transport in heart muscle mitochondria. When gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, inderal, antioxidants ionol and isoptin were used as selective inhibitors of definite steps in the pathogenetic chain of stress heart impairments, these impairments of the mitochondrial functions were effectively prevented at the step of regulatory mechanisms responsible for the stress reactions.", 
    "32": "Intraperitoneal adrenaline injection induces in 15 and 30 min an increase in the phosphorylation rate, calcium capacity and Ca2+ retention time in the rat liver mitochondria. A rise of the phosphorylation rate is inhibited by inderal, a beta-adreno-blocker. Energy metabolism grows considerably with succinate exchange intensification.", 
    "33": "Retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells in culture, as well as freshly dissected embryonic RPE, exhibit a beta-adrenergic receptor. Agonist potency is: L-isoproterenol greater than (-)epinephrine greater than or equal to (-)norepinephrine much greater than dopamine. Propranolol blocks this effect. Hydroxybenzylpindolol (HYP), a beta-antagonist, also blocks the increase in cAMP elicited by L-isoproterenol. Binding of [125I]-hydroxybenzylpindolol, shows a half saturation concentration of 1.1 X 10(-9) M and 2.7 X 10(5) HYP binding sites per cell. The presence of such distinct beta-adrenergic responsiveness indicates a potentially important role for this receptor in RPE cell physiology.", 
    "34": "Prior reports by Dr. Bond [1] have described the occurrence of an initial compensatory vasoconstriction followed by a decompensatory vasodilation response in animals that progress to irreversible shock induced by blood loss. Further analysis suggests that the secondary vascular decompensation is the result of sympathetic inhibition of adrenergic neurotransmission. The primary purpose of the present studies was to elucidate the roles of the alpha 1 and alpha 2 adrenoreceptors during initial compensatory and secondary decompensatory phases of hemorrhagic shock. This was accomplished by subjecting rat pairs to a modified Wiggers hemorrhagic shock protocol. One of these rats served as an untreated control (Rc) while the other (Re) received either an adrenergic antagonist or was bilaterally adrenal medullectomized 1-2 days prior to induction of shock. The adrenergic antagonists were: (1) propranolol, a nonspecific beta blocker; (2) phenoxybenzamine, a nonspecific alpha blocker; (3) tiodazosin, a specific alpha 1 blocker; and (4) yohimbine, a specific alpha 2 blocker. The results of these studies suggest that the beta receptors do not play a major role in either the compensatory or decompensatory response. Specific blockade of the alpha 2 adrenoreceptors accentuates decompensation by approximately 35%, while blockade of the alpha 1 adrenoreceptors may offer some degree of protection against the vascular decompensatory processes. These data support the conclusion that the extrasynaptic alpha 2 adrenoreceptors are better able to maintain the vascular compensatory effort than the alpha 1 adrenoreceptors.", 
    "35": "Mammalian platelets vary widely in their responses to catecholamines in part because these agonists can act via excitatory alpha- and inhibitory beta-adrenoceptors. In the absence of antagonists, adrenaline enhances the response of rabbit platelets to an excitatory agonist, e.g. adenosine-5'-O-(1-thiodiphosphate) (ADP-alpha-s) acting at another receptor, but has no effect on the response of rat or guinea pig platelets to such an agonist. In the presence of a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, adrenaline enhances the response of rat, but not guinea-pig platelets to ADP-alpha-S and the extent of the enhanced effect on rabbit platelets is increased. In the presence of an alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist, adrenaline inhibits the response of rabbit and rat platelets to ADP-alpha-S but has no such effect on the response of guinea-pig platelets. Studies using selective agonists and antagonists demonstrate that the excitatory response of rat platelets to adrenaline is mediated by an alpha 2-adrenoceptor, and the inhibitory response of rabbit platelets to adrenaline by a beta 2-adrenoceptor as is the case in other species which have been examined. The mean alpha 2-adrenoceptor density on human, rabbit, rat and guinea-pig platelets as assessed using [3H]-yohimbine as radioligand is obtained as 258, 270, 42 and less than 10 receptors per platelet. The mean beta 2-adrenoceptor density on human, rabbit, rat and guinea-pig platelets as assessed using (-)-[125I]-iodocyanopindolol is obtained as 66, 14, 41 and less than 5 receptors per platelet. The nature of the effect of adrenaline on the response of mammalian platelets to other excitatory agonists, e.g. ADP-alpha-S, appears therefore to be largely determined by the absolute number of alpha 2-adrenoceptors and by the relative content of alpha 2- and beta 2-adrenoceptors on these cells for the species which have been examined in this analysis.", 
    "36": "A randomized, double-blind, parallel treatment trial was carried out in 24 patients with moderate to severe hypertension to compare the effectiveness and tolerance of two treatment regimens in reducing and maintaining supine diastolic blood pressure below 90 mmHg. Patients in Group I received 10 to 40 mg enalapril maleate per day with the addition of 50 mg hydrochlorothiazide per day and then 250 to 1000 mg alpha-methyldopa per day, if necessary. Patients in Group II received 50 mg hydrochlorothiazide per day with the addition of 80 to 240 mg propranolol and then 100 to 200 mg hydralazine per day, if necessary. Apart from the hydrochlorothiazide dosage which was fixed, the dosage of the other active drugs was titrated incrementally until the target blood pressure level was achieved. Blood pressures, heart rate and body weight were monitored at 2-weekly intervals during 26 weeks of active therapy. In Group I, blood pressure control was achieved and maintained with enalapril alone in 9 patients, 2 patients required double therapy and 1 patient triple therapy. In Group II, 9 patients required double therapy, 2 triple therapy, and only 1 patient received monotherapy. Supine and erect blood pressure control was comparable in both groups. There was, however, a significant decrease in supine heart rate in patients in Group II. More importantly, 8 of the 12 patients in Group II experienced non-life threatening adverse reactions (4 were hypokalaemic and required supplementary potassium, 2 had cold hands and feet, 1 man had sexual dysfunction and 1 acute gout) and no adverse reactions were reported by Group I patients.", 
    "37": "Inhibitors of the Na+ pump have been proposed as participating in sodium excretion, extracellular fluid regulation, and in the rise of blood pressure. The presence of digitalis-like compounds in human plasma has been investigated by comparing the effects of plasma extracts to those of ouabain in 4 tests. - competition with ouabain for binding to the Na+ pump, - inhibition of Na+ and K+ dependent hydrolysis - inhibition of serotonin uptake by human platelets - central hypertensive effect Plasma fractions exhibited digitalis-like properties in the 4 tests. The effects of plasma extracts of 42 normotensive subjects (21 with family history of hypertension) and 38 patients with essential hypertension (15 with antihypertensive treatment) and 9 patients with chronic renal failure were compared. Plasma from Forty per cent of untreated hypertensive patients and normotensives with hypertensive heredity had a high inhibition level. Inhibition was enhanced in beta-blocker treated patients and decreased in those on diuretics. No digitalis-like activity was observed in uremic plasma. These observations strongly suggest the presence of digitalis-like compound(s) in human plasma and point to its possible association with hypertension.", 
    "38": "We examined the late coronary vascular response to carotid chemoreceptor reflex activation in normal, conscious dogs instrumented for the measurement of right main and left circumflex coronary artery blood flows, arterial and right ventricular pressures, and arterial and coronary sinus blood gases and O2 contents. With heart rate held constant by electrical stimulation, and with respiration controlled or allowed to vary spontaneously, carotid chemoreceptor reflex activation (induced by intracarotid nicotine) elicited a striking biphasic coronary vascular response characterized by an early dilation (previously described) and a late constriction. For example, with respiration controlled and with the autonomic nervous system intact, carotid chemoreceptor reflex activation resulted in a late increase in arterial pressure (19 +/- 4%; P less than 0.002), absolute reductions in right main (24 +/- 4%; P less than 0.002), and left circumflex (12 +/- 2%; P less than 0.004) coronary blood flows, and increases in right (62 +/- 13%; P less than 0.002) and left (26 +/- 3%; P less than 0.0001) coronary resistances. This carotid chemoreceptor reflex activation-induced late coronary constriction was also associated with a concomitant increase in myocardial oxygen extraction, i.e., arterial oxygen content remained constant, while coronary sinus oxygen content decreased (19 +/- 6%; P less than 0.04). Neither propranolol nor atropine had any significant effect on the magnitude of the right coronary constriction. However, both the absolute reduction in right coronary blood flow and increase in right coronary resistance were abolished by phentolamine. Furthermore, either total cardiac denervation or adrenalectomy significantly attenuated (P less than 0.01) carotid chemoreceptor reflex activation-induced reductions in right coronary blood flow and increase in right coronary resistance. We conclude that, with autonomic nervous system activity intact, carotid chemoreceptor reflex activation can elicit an absolute reflexly mediated reduction in coronary blood flow in the normal, conscious dog, despite an increase in arterial pressure. The mechanism of this vasoconstriction involves alpha-adrenergic receptor stimulation mediated by both cardiac sympathetic nerves and circulating catecholamines.", 
    "39": "Experiments were made to study the actions of STH and its fragment capable to stimulate the growth processes on MAO activity and selective binding of catecholamines by alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptors in glial cells of the rat brain cortex. For comparison the effects of STH and its fragment on 3H-PGE1 binding were studied. STH and its fragment were found to produce no influence on MAO activity or specific binding of 3H-PGE1 with glial cells. STH and its fragment (5.10(-9) M) were found to reduce specific binding of 3H-dihydroergocryptine with beta- and alpha-adrenoreceptors of glial cells, respectively. It is suggested that STH and its fragment can modulate the function of glial cells by changing the selective action of catecholamines on subpopulations of adrenergic receptors.", 
    "40": "Injection of insulin to the CSF in the presence of spontaneous diuresis and hydration gives rise to the growth of reabsorption of osmotically free water accompanied by high tubular transport, as well as to the development of antinatriuresis and inhibition of diuresis. Experiments with a preliminary blockade of beta-adrenoreceptors with propranolol or administration of a beta-blocker following insulin injection demonstrated beta-adrenoreactive brain structures to be involved in the mechanism of action of insulin. Secondary activation of vasopressin secretion and release in the blood may be mediated via these structures, as a result of which reabsorption of osmotically free water in renal tubules gets increased. Thus, CSF insulin effects its influence on renal function via the central neurohumoral mechanisms which work due to beta-adrenergic brain receptors.", 
    "41": "Prior work has provided ultrastructural evidence that beta-adrenergic agonists stimulate secretion by nonciliated bronchiolar epithelial (Clara) cells of the rat (J Clin Invest 67:345, 1981). However, since the lung is a multicellular organ it is not clear if the beta-agonists act directly on the Clara cell. The absence in Clara cells of beta-adrenergic receptors would indicate an indirect action of the beta-adrenergic agonists. In the present study, we used 9-amino-acridyl propranolol in an attempt to determine if beta-adrenergic receptors are present in rat bronchiolar Clara cells. Discrete, intense yellow fluorescent dots were identified microscopically in ciliated and in Clara cells of the rat. This anatomical localization of beta-adrenergic receptors supports the notion that beta-adrenergic agonists stimulate secretion by acting directly on Clara cells.", 
    "42": "The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) plays a major role in blood pressure regulation. Although the exact relationship of the SNS to the etiology of hypertension remains undetermined, many of the agents used to treat hypertension interfere with this system. Clonidine, methyldopa, guanethidine, and reserpine decrease SNS tone whereas hydralazine, minoxidil, and hydrochlorothiazide increase it. Most evidence suggests that beta-adrenergic blocking agents decrease SNS activity. The effect of prazosin and captopril on the SNS requires further study. The appropriate use of these antihypertensive agents requires a knowledge of their sites of action and the physiological reflexes they induce. Efficacy, toxicity, and effective drug combinations can be predicted based on their mechanism of action and effect on SNS activity.", 
    "43": "It has been reported that adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) administration reduces the time necessary for observing the imipramine-induced decline in beta-adrenergic receptor binding and function in rat brain frontal cortex. This interaction was examined in the present study following the destruction of the dorsal noradrenergic bundle in an attempt to determine whether the hormone treatment influences pre- or postsynaptic activity to facilitate the receptor response. Lesioning completely prevented the decline in beta-receptor binding normally observed following treatment with the drug combination. In fact, the number of cerebral cortical beta-adrenergic receptor binding sites was significantly greater in lesioned animals receiving ACTH than in lesioned controls. Lesioning significantly increased the amount of cyclic AMP produced in response to a saturating concentration of norepinephrine, an effect that was not influenced by ACTH treatment. These findings suggest that ACTH administration modifies the norepinephrine-stimulated cyclic nucleotide system indirectly, perhaps through an action on presynaptic neurons, whereas the effect on receptor recognition site number may be due to a direct action on the postsynaptic cell.", 
    "44": "One way of gaining a greater understanding of the central mechanisms underlying hunger and the regulation of feeding behaviour in humans is to examine the actions and interactions on hunger and food intake of drugs with known or presumed pharmacological modes of action. To this end we have undertaken a number of studies which fall into three main categories: the mechanisms by which amphetamine anorexia is induced; the possible role of endogenous opioids in feeding; the action of amino acids thought to be involved in the regulation of feeding. In this field the potential for cross-fertilization between basic scientists working with laboratory animals and clinical scientists working with human subjects exists. For example, the clinical pharmacologist has been able to test out hypotheses on human subjects which could only have been developed using laboratory animals. Furthermore, using human subjects it is possible to extend the field of inquiry into an exploration of the subjective dimensions of appetite and hunger.", 
    "45": "In vitro autoradiographic techniques combined with computer assisted microdensitometry were used to analyze the characteristics and distribution of multiple recognition sites for the neurotransmitters acetylcholine (M1 and M2) and serotonin (5-HT1A and 5-HT1B). For this purpose, binding competition experiments were performed using non-subtype selective 3H-labeled ligands and selective unlabeled compounds. Consecutive tissue sections were incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of displacers. By using this approach, maximal densities of binding sites, as well as competition profiles of several drugs could be analyzed and quantified in microscopic brain areas. Our results reveal the presence of brain structures enriched in one class of muscarinic or serotonergic-1 recognition sites. This provides a tool for better characterization of the proposed \"subtype-selective\" ligands and suggests physiological functions for these receptor subtypes. It is concluded that quantitative autoradiographic techniques provide a level of anatomical and pharmacological information on neurotransmitter receptor subtypes, which is difficult to attain using membrane binding studies.", 
    "46": "The neurochemical specificity of physiological, biochemical, and psychological responses to dextroamphetamine was tested by pretreating volunteers with haloperidol (0.014 mg/kg IM), propranolol (0.1 mg/kg IV), thymoxamine (0.1 mg/kg IV), or placebo prior to 0.3 mg/kg IV amphetamine. Healthy volunteers (N = 12) participated in the studies, but not all volunteers received each drug combination. Haloperidol prevented dextroamphetamine-induced behavioral excitation, but did not significantly affect plasma norepinephrine or pressor responses, whereas propranolol inhibited norepinephrine and pressor responses without influencing excitation or other behavioral responses. Thymoxamine did not affect any of the responses measured. None of the agents significantly affected plasma cortisol or growth hormone responses. The prolactin rise following dextroamphetamine was potentiated by haloperidol. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that behavioral excitation after dextroamphetamine occurs through a dopaminergic mechanism, and pressor responses through a noradrenergic mechanism.", 
    "47": "This study examined changes in cardiac myofibrillar ATPase activity during the development of hyperthyroidism and the relationships between changes in myofibrillar ATPase activity and hemodynamic parameters in rabbits. Calcium-stimulated, magnesium-dependent ATPase (Ca-ATPase) activity of cardiac myofibrils exhibited about a 30% increase after the first week of treatment with excess desiccated thyroid tissue powder (thyroid-treatment) and did not show further increase during thyroid-treatment. Development of cardiac hypertrophy and increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure were dependent upon prolonged periods of thyroid-treatment lasting from 3 days to 4 weeks, whereas the maximal increase (about 55%) in heart rate was seen after the first week of thyroid-treatment. The elevated level lasted throughout subsequent thyroid-treatment. Lineweaver-Burk plots showed an increase in Km and Vmax values for Ca-ATPase activity of myofibrillar preparation from the thyrotoxic hearts of treated animals. Increased Ca-ATPase activity was correlated with thyroid-induced changes in heart rate. Propranolol partially reduced the thyroid-induced increase in Ca-ATPase activity and heart rate, suggesting participation of beta-adrenoceptors in the thyroid-induced increases of Ca-ATPase activity and heart rate.", 
    "48": "Twenty patients with mild to moderate hypertension and evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy (relative wall thickness greater than or equal to 0.45), who previously had not received either alpha-methyldopa or propranolol, were allocated at random to treatment with one or other of these drugs as monotherapy after a 2-week baseline period on no medication. Dosage was titrated until normotension was attained and patients were then maintained on this treatment for a year. Analysis of blood pressure measurements and echocardiograms taken before and during maintenance therapy showed that there were significantly correlated changes in systolic blood pressure and heart rate with left ventricular cavity and regional wall changes during chronic drug administration. In the alpha-methyldopa group there were significant correlations between changes in erect and supine systolic blood pressure and the posterior wall index, and in erect systolic blood pressure and left ventricular mass. In the propranolol group, there were significant correlations between changes in supine systolic blood pressure and interventricular septal thickness, and in erect heart rate and supine systolic blood pressure with the percentage change in internal diameter of the left ventricle. It is suggested that these observations may have important therapeutic implications for hypertensive patients with documented left ventricular hypertrophy.", 
    "49": "In 24 normal eyes of healthy adult rhesus monkeys, the effects of 1% Pilocarpine, 0.5% Timolol, 0.5% levo-epinephrine (Epifrin) and 0.5% Thymoxamine were tested on the iris vessels, intraocular pressure and pupil size. Fluorescein iris angiography and applanation tonometry were performed on the eyes before the use of any drug, and then 2-4 h after topical instillation of each drug; all drugs were used in all the eyes, an interval of one week being left after the use of each drug. The findings of this study suggest that Pilocarpine and Timolol produced vasodilation. Epifrin and Thymoxamine seemed to have no appreciable effect. Pilocarpine produced miosis while other drugs had no significant effect on pupil size. Pilocarpine, Timolol and Epifrin each produced a significant fall in the intraocular pressure. The mechanisms of vascular changes are discussed. The various limitations of fluorescein iris angiography in such a study are stressed.", 
    "50": "The effect of long-term timolol treatment on heart size after myocardial infarction was evaluated by X-ray in a double-blind study including 241 patients (placebo 126, timolol 115). The follow-up period was 12 months. The timolol-treated patients showed a small but significant increase in heart size from baseline in contrast to a decrease in the placebo group. These differences may be caused by timolol-induced bradycardia and a compensatory increase in end-diastolic volume. The timolol-related increase in heart size was observed only in patients with normal and borderline heart size. In patients with cardiomegaly, the increase in heart size was similar in both groups. After re-infarction, heart size increased in the placebo group and remained unchanged in the timolol group.", 
    "51": "The effects of ICI 118,587 and atenolol on the responses to submaximal exercise and on breathlessness were studied in six healthy subjects. Atenolol reduced heart rate at rest and during exercise whereas ICI 118,587 increased resting heart rate but caused a small reduction in the highest heart rate achieved during exercise. Neither ICI 118,587 nor atenolol significantly changed minute ventilation or oxygen uptake either at rest or during exercise. There were no effects on bronchomotor tone. The assessment of breathlessness was validated for the subjects participating in the study. Atenolol increased the intensity of breathlessness in relation either to ventilation or to oxygen uptake. This effect was not secondary to a change in bronchomotor tone but was possibly related to changes in pulmonary haemodynamics. On the other hand, the relationships of breathlessness to ventilation or to oxygen uptake were unchanged by ICI 118,587. The effects of ICI 118,587 on exercise tolerance and dyspnoea in patients with impaired cardiac function should now be determined.", 
    "52": "Ten normal, non-asthmatic subjects performed an 18 min graduated exercise test on a static exercise bicycle on 3 separate days. They received either no medication, or propranolol 80 mg orally 2 h before, or ipratropium bromide 0.216 mg by inhalation 30 min before, the start of exercise. With no medication, transpulmonary index (TPI), a measure of airway resistance, fell linearly during exercise from a resting value of 0.269 +/- 0.024 to 0.170 +/- 0.014 kPa X 1(-1) X s by the end of exercise. This returned to baseline between 2 and 4 min after stopping exercise. Propranolol elevated baseline TPI slightly from 0.270 +/- 0.024 to 0.294 +/- 0.024 before exercise and during exercise this fell linearly to 0.185 +/- 0.016 kPa X 1(-1) X s. The fall in TPI during exercise after propranolol was not significantly different from the fall seen with no medication. Six minutes after exercise stopped TPI rose to 0.336 +/- 0.035 kPa X 1(-1) X s after propranolol. All values for TPI from 4 min to 16 min after exercise were significantly higher after propranolol than the corresponding values found after no medication (P less than 0.05). Ipratropium bromide decreased baseline TPI from 0.264 +/- 0.024 to 0.163 +/- 0.013 kPa X 1(-1) X s (P less than 0.001) and this did not change significantly further either during or after exercise. Normal subjects show considerable airway dilatation during exercise and this appears to result from inhibition of resting vagal tone. The sympathetic system does not appear to mediate the airway dilatation during exercise, but it may be important in protecting against post-exercise bronchoconstriction.", 
    "53": "23 patients suffering from psoriasis and being treated with beta-blocking agents were compared to a control group regarding psoriasis activity. Seven out of the 23 were affected by psoriasis after introduction of the beta-blocking drug. The mean age of onset was significantly higher (p less than 0.001) than that of the control group, which supports the provoking effects of beta-blocking agents. Remission occurred in 3 out of 4 patients after medication was stopped.", 
    "54": "The effect of forskolin and isobutyl-methylxanthine on amylase release and cyclic AMP accumulation by alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonists was studied in rat parotid slices. A small increase in cyclic AMP by beta-adrenergic agonists was sufficient for maximum stimulation of amylase release (Yoshimura et al., 1982a), but a similar increase in cyclic AMP by forskolin did not stimulate the maximum amount of amylase release. The amount of amylase release and cyclic AMP changed in parallel when lower doses of isobutyl-methylxanthine were used, but higher doses of isobutyl-methylxanthine further increased cyclic AMP without causing a significant increase in amylase release. Amylase release stimulated to its maximum by isobutyl-methylxanthine was much lower than that by isoproterenol. These results suggest that cyclic AMP is not the only chemical correlate for the activation of amylase release by beta-adrenergic agonists. The effect of phenylephrine and methoxamine on amylase release was augmented by either forskolin or isobutyl-methylxanthine, but the effect of methacholine was not. Phenylephrine increased the cyclic AMP concentration under the same conditions, but methoxamine did not. The inhibition of the effect of phenylephrine plus forskolin on cyclic AMP accumulation by propranolol was almost complete and stereospecific, but the inhibition of their effects on amylase release was incomplete and not stereospecific. Synergism of amylase release was observed in the effect between methoxamine and dibutyryl-cyclic AMP. These results suggest that the augmentation of the effect of alpha-adrenergic agonists on amylase release by forskolin or isobutyl-methylxanthine cannot be explained only on changes in cyclic AMP and that some other factor in collaboration with cyclic AMP may participate in the regulation of amylase release by alpha-adrenergic agonists.", 
    "55": "The pathways of action of some agents modifying tumor dissemination were studied experimentally. The preventive effect of interferon upon metastatic spreading was found to be due to activation of effector cells of non-specific immune surveillance. A relationship between tumor dissemination process and the condition of neuro-regulatory mechanisms of target-organ was established. For example, it was shown that an injury to the vascular wall of the target-organ caused by hypercatecholemia and steady rise in adrenocortical hormone levels is, to a degree, a factor of metastatic spread stimulation following primary tumor removal.", 
    "56": "Effects of arotinolol on dog coronary arteries were investigated in vitro. In distal portions of left circumflex coronary arteries contracted with 3 X 10(-2)M KCl, norephinephrine relaxed the strips in a concentration-dependent fashion. Propranolol (10(-6)M) converted the norepinephrine-induced relaxations to contractions, and arotinolol (10(-6)-10(-5)M) inhibited the relaxations induced by norepinephrine in a concentration-dependent manner. In proximal portions of the strips after potassium-contracture, norephinephrine produced concentration-dependent contractions which were augmented by propranolol (10(-6)M) and inhibited by arotinolol (10(-6)-10(-5)M). These results suggest that arotinolol has an alpha-adrenoceptor blocking activity in addition to a beta-adrenoceptor blocking action in dog coronary arteries.", 
    "57": "Treatment of hypertension with diuretics and beta-blockers is often associated with changes in lipids and uric acid levels. The clinical importance of these metabolic changes is still uncertain, but potentially they might counteract the beneficial effect of blood pressure reduction in some patients. As these drugs are widely used to prevent the cardiovascular complications of hypertension, it is imperative that we evaluate the effect of these drug-induced metabolic changes on the atherosclerotic process in humans.", 
    "58": "Effect of clenbuterol on the release of histamine and SRS-A from passively sensitized guinea-pig lungs was studied in a superfused-cascade bioassay system, and compared with isoproterenol and salbutamol. One-week-old guinea-pig lungs were used, since histamine and SRS-A were released more in these than in 6- or 12-week old lungs during anaphylaxis. Clenbuterol, isoproterenol and salbutamol (10(-8) - 10(-7) M) were found to inhibit the releases of histamine and SRS-A. These actions were inhibited by propranolol. These results suggest that clenbuterol inhibits the releases of histamine and SRS-A via the beta-adrenoceptor.", 
    "59": "204 patients with established ischaemic heart disease, aged up to 62 years, were divided at random into two groups according to the matched pairs principle with respect to factors influencing long-term prognosis. Before randomization, the patients' ECG was monitored for 24 hrs, a treadmill exercise test and roentgencardiography were performed. The follow-up period was about 1.5 years. In the experimental group of 101 patients who were given propranolol in individualized doses (40-320 mg/day), which ensured a decrease in heart rate by 15-20%, sudden coronary death was significantly less frequent (p less than 0.01) than in the control group. The occurrence of repeated non-fatal myocardial infarction did not in the two groups significantly differ. A decrease in the occurrence of ventricular extrasystoles in the propranolol treated group was found only at the exercise test.", 
    "60": "Diuretics are important drugs used in therapy for hypertension. Diuretics have a number of side effects, some of which have long-term consequences. In this study diuretics were used to treat individuals with mild hypertension. Patients receiving diuretics as sole therapy had an increased mortality due to an excess number of deaths from myocardial infarction or sudden death. In patients given alpha-methyldopa or propranolol as well as a diuretic drug, this effect was not observed. The increased mortality may be due to an increased susceptibility to arrhythmias in individuals receiving diuretics, and this was prevented by drugs that interfere with the effects of the sympathetic nervous system.", 
    "61": "Diuretics, when used for antihypertensive therapy, may also affect lipoprotein metabolism. The following observations were made after 1-12 months of treatment. Various thiazide-type diuretics significantly increased the potentially atherogenic serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and/or very-LDL-C (V-LDL-C) fractions, while the antiatherogenic high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level was largely unchanged. Certain loop diuretics also increased the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio. Both types of diuretics elevated serum triglyceride (Tg) levels in some, but not all, studies. Levels of LDL-C were increased in diuretic-treated men and in chlorthalidone-treated postmenopausal women, but not in chlorthalidone-treated premenopausal women. Only two diuretics evaluated, indapamide and spironolactone, had no apparent influence on lipoproteins. A tendency for increased Tg levels and lower HDL-C concentrations was apparent during combined thiazide-type diuretic-beta-blocker treatment; these changes resembled those observed during beta-blocker monotherapy. Diuretic-induced increases in LDL-C were prevented or reversed by concomitant beta-blockade, but not by combination treatment with sympatholytics such as reserpine, methyldopa, and clonidine. Prospective studies are needed to clarify the long-term course and the pathogenic and prognostic relevance of lipoprotein changes induced by various diuretics. In the meantime, it is of clinical interest that premenopausal women may be protected from thiazide-induced increases in LDL-C, certain diuretic agents have no significant effect on serum lipoproteins, and beta-blockers may prevent or reverse increases in LDL-C in men and postmenopausal women during diuretic treatment.", 
    "62": "Diuretics are first-line drugs for treatment of hypertension in most parts of the world. Recently, however, beta-blockers have been increasingly used as drugs of first choice. The aim of this review is to describe advantages and disadvantages of diuretics in comparison to beta-blockers. The blood pressure (BP)-lowering effect of normally used doses of diuretics gives a useful decrease of BP equal to what can be achieved with beta-blockers in corresponding doses. Over 20 years of use has shown diuretics to be relatively safe for long-term treatment. The frequency of withdrawals and the subjective tolerability are comparable to those with beta-blockers. Diuretics do not seem to induce diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance when used in small doses. At higher doses and in elderly patients impairment of glucose tolerance might appear. The commonly encountered hypokalemia during diuretic treatment seems to be related to the dose and to the duration of the diuretic action. Diuretics can always be used once daily, and they are cheaper than beta-blockers, even when a greater need for laboratory check-ups is taken into account. While beta-blockers so far have not been shown to prevent or postpone hypertensive complications, diuretics have done so in several recent large-scale trials. Two multicenter trials are currently testing the hypothesis of whether beta-blockers are superior to diuretics in preventing coronary heart disease, the most common hypertensive complication. Until these studies are presented, there is little evidence to change the current use of diuretics as first-choice drugs in hypertension.", 
    "63": "Fenoterol, a beta 2-adrenergic agonist recently introduced to treat asthmatic disorders, inhibits antigen-induced histamine release from human basophil leukocytes and lung mast cells in a dose-dependent fashion. The dose-response inhibition curve is paralleled by a fenoterol-induced increase in the cAMP levels of human leukocyte preparations. The relationship between the effect of fenoterol and cAMP level is supported by the finding that the beta 2-adrenergic agonist only inhibits the first stage of antigen-induced histamine release and not the release caused by the Ca2+ ionophore, A23187. Propranolol, a competitive antagonist of beta 2-adrenergic receptor, blocks the inhibition of release and the cAMP accumulation caused by fenoterol. Finally, theophylline, a cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor, synergistically potentiates the inhibitory effect of fenoterol on histamine release and the accumulation of cAMP. These data suggest that fenoterol may modulate the in vivo release of the mediators of immediate hypersensitivity reactions via the activation of beta 2-adrenergic receptor linked to adenylate cyclase on human basophils and mast cells.", 
    "64": "The nature of the beta-adrenoceptor population(s) mediating direct smooth muscle relaxation, inhibition of antigen-induced histamine release and inhibition of antigen-induced (leukotriene-mediated) smooth muscle contraction of human and guinea pig central and peripheral airways was investigated. Preferential blockade by beta 1- and beta 2-selective antagonists of the relaxation induced by beta 1- and beta 2-selective agonists, respectively, revealed the guinea pig tracheal smooth muscle relaxation to be mediated by both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors. Using a highly beta 2-selective antagonist, the NE-induced relaxation was split up biphasically into a beta 1- and a beta 2-component. In contrast, no such differential blockade was observed with the relaxation of the guinea pig lung parenchyma strip, neither with the human tracheal, main bronchus and respiratory bronchiolus smooth muscle, which are all mediated by homogeneous beta 2-adrenoceptor populations. Only in the guinea pig trachea did neuronal and extraneuronal uptake inhibitors produce pronounced left shifts of the NE- and ISO-induced relaxation curves, respectively, suggesting a causal relationship between noradrenergic innervation and the presence of the beta 1-adrenoceptor subpopulation in the airways. Using the same techniques, it was established that inhibition of antigen-induced histamine release from guinea pig lung and tracheal mast cells is mediated by homogeneous beta 2-adrenoceptor populations as well. In contrast to catecholamines, non-catecholamine beta-agonists such as fenoterol, clenbuterol and zinterol had a substantially higher apparent affinity for the inhibition of the anaphylactic (leukotriene-mediated) guinea pig tracheal contraction than for the inhibition of histamine release; the same was true for lung tissue, though the difference was less pronounced. With some non-catecholamine beta-agonists considerable selectivity both in central and peripheral airway preparations was observed for the inhibition of anaphylactic contraction as compared with smooth muscle relaxation.", 
    "65": "Formoterol was evaluated for its inhibitory effects on tissue tonus of the isolated guinea-pig lung parenchymal (peripheral airways) and tracheal (central airways) strips and on antigen-induced release of slow reactive substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A) in the rat. Relaxant effects of formoterol in both parenchymal and tracheal strips were dose-dependent and were of similar potency. Formoterol was 44 and 100 times more potent than isoproterenol and salbutamol, respectively, in relaxing the parenchymal preparation. Propranolol, butoxamine and atenolol antagonized the relaxation of the parenchymal strips by formoterol in this order of decreasing potency; their slopes of regression line of the Schild plots were 0.809, 0.975 and 0.676, respectively. The inhibitory effect of intraperitoneally administered formoterol on (mouse) IgE-mediated SRS-A release in rat passive peritoneal anaphylaxis was 40 and 12200 times, respectively, more potent than those of salbutamol and disodium cromoglycate (DSCG). This action was antagonized by pretreatment with propranolol. In contrast to DSCG which dose-dependently inhibited histamine release, neither formoterol nor salbutamol was effective in inhibiting the release. The results indicate that formoterol potently relaxes the peripheral airways through stimulating the beta 2-adrenoceptors selectively as is the case in the central airways and that it significantly inhibits IgE-mediated SRS-A release through beta-adrenoceptor stimulation.", 
    "66": "Hemodynamic actions of arotinolol in anesthetized dogs and its effects on alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors were examined. Arotinolol produced dose-dependent decrease in mean blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, maximum rate of left ventricular pressure rise and coronary blood flow in a dose range of 1 microgram/kg-3 mg/kg. Total peripheral resistance (TPR) increased with arotinolol dose-dependently in a dose range of 1 microgram/kg-0.3 mg/kg, but at doses of 1 and 3 mg/kg the increase in TPR was less. Arotinolol at a dose of 10 micrograms/kg significantly inhibited the blood pressure and heart rate responses to isoproterenol. Propranolol at the same dose produced only a slight inhibition of these. Arotinolol at a dose of 3 mg/kg attenuated the pressor response to phenylephrine without any effect on the response to angiotensin-II in anesthetized dogs. Propranolol at the same dose produced only a slight inhibition of the response to phenylephrine. In the study of radioactive ligand binding assays, arotinolol showed high affinities for both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors. Arotinolol showed an affinity also for alpha 1-adrenoceptors which was comparable to the affinity of yohimbine. Thus, the present results support the idea that arotinolol possesses both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors blocking effects.", 
    "67": "Isometric muscle endurance was measured in fourteen physically active men without (placebo) and after acute oral administration of 160 mg propranolol (Inderal). Quadriceps muscle contractions were sustained at 65% maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) to exhaustion. Muscle biopsies were obtained from m. vastus lateralis at rest for subsequent histochemical analysis for myofibrillar ATPase and amylase-PAS in order to determine fiber type composition and capillary density. The time to exhaustion was shorter (p less than 0.01) during beta-blockade (0.82 +/- 0.22) min than placebo (0.90 +/- 0.23) min. Changes in endurance time, induced by beta-blockade, were not correlated with any of the muscle morphological or histochemical variables examined. It is concluded that muscular performance is impaired as a result of beta-blockade on muscle tissue irrespective of any concomitant change in central circulation.", 
    "68": "We assessed the effects of labetalol on pulmonary wedge pressure (PWP) and other hemodynamic variables in 18 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and systemic hypertension (systolic blood pressure greater than 150 mm Hg). According to the initial value of PWP, the patients were separated into two groups of nine patients each: Group 1 (PWP greater than or equal to 15 mm Hg) and Group 2 (PWP less than or equal to 12 mm Hg). Labetalol was infused at increasing rates to lower systolic blood pressure below 130 mm Hg; this optimal rate (mean rates for Groups 1 and 2: 1.8 and 2.1 mg/min, respectively) was maintained for 1 h. Hemodynamic variables were measured before and after 1 h of infusion. Labetalol normalized blood pressure in both groups by a significant decrease in total systemic resistance [22% (p less than 0.001) and 13% (p less than 0.02)] and in cardiac index [17% (p less than 0.005) and 12% (p less than 0.02)]. While the hemodynamic responses were rather similar in both groups, the PWP decreased significantly (from 22 to 15 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) in Group 1, but did not change significantly in Group 2 (from 7 to 10 mm Hg, NS). The possible mechanisms behind these different responses are discussed. We conclude that labetalol is an effective drug for treating systemic hypertension in AMI which acutely decreases total systemic resistance and preload in patients with moderate left ventricular failure.", 
    "69": "The beta-blocking potencies of mepindolol and pindolol were determined in guinea pig right atria (heart rate) and paced left atria (contractile force) in vitro. Neither agent showed selectivity for blocking rate responses induced by isoproterenol. The pA2 (95% confidence interval) values determined for mepindolol against rate and force responses induced by isoproterenol were 9.96 (9.91-10.01) and 9.52 (9.44-9.60), respectively, and for pindolol, 9.20 (9.15-9.25) and 8.85 (8.76-8.94). Mepindolol was approximately 6.5 times as potent as pindolol. The present evidence does not support the hypothesis of subpopulations of beta-receptors subserving inotropic and chronotropic responses.", 
    "70": "Various in vitro and in vivo techniques were used to evaluate the cardiovascular actions of MDL 19205, a new cardiotonic agent. In the anesthetized dog, intravenous administration of MDL 19205 (0.1-1 mg/kg) produced marked increases in cardiac contractile force which were accompanied by small increases in heart rate and minor decreases in blood pressure. These effects were not altered by alpha- or beta-adrenergic receptor blockade, reserpine pretreatment, or bilateral carotid sinus denervation. In isolated cat cardiac tissues, MDL 19205 (10(-5)-10(-3) M) produced a selective inotropic effect relative to isoproterenol and, unlike isoproterenol, was nonarrhythmogenic. Adrenergic beta-receptor or histamine H1-receptor blockade did not modify the inotropic effects of MDL 19205 in guinea pig atria. The vasodilatory effect of MDL 19205 in the canine isolated pump-perfused hindlimb preparation was not significantly attenuated by surgical sympathectomy, alpha- or beta-adrenergic receptor blockade, cholinergic or histaminergic receptor blockade, or indomethacin pretreatment, indicating that MDL 19205 produced direct relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. MDL 19205 was found to be safe and effective when administered acutely in combination with ouabain, hydralazine, nitroglycerin, or furosemide, agents commonly used in the treatment of congestive heart failure. The pharmacological profile revealed by these and other studies suggests that MDL 19205 should be useful in the clinical treatment of congestive heart failure.", 
    "71": "The cardiovascular properties of a new cardiotonic agent, MDL 19205, were investigated in anesthetized and conscious dogs and in a dog heart-lung preparation. MDL 19205 (0.1-1 mg/kg), administered to anesthetized dogs by intravenous injection, produced a dose-related increase in cardiac contractile force lasting up to 1 h. It also produced a relatively minor increase in heart rate and a brief decrease in blood pressure. These effects did not involve beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation, as they were observed in dogs after a myocardial-depressant dose of propranolol. Given orally to conscious dogs, MDL 19205 (1 and 3 mg/kg) produced a dose-related increase in dP/dt without producing a significant alteration in heart rate or blood pressure. When administered to anesthetized dogs by constant intravenous infusion, MDL 19205 (0.1 mg/kg/min) produced a marked and sustained increase in cardiac contractile force and decreases in blood pressure and left atrial pressure, but did not produce a significant change in cardiac output or stroke volume, indicating an enhancement of cardiac pump function. Intravenous MDL 19205 reversed the hemodynamic characteristics of heart failure produced by propranolol in anesthetized dogs. In addition, it reversed the depressant effect of pentobarbital on cardiac function in a dog heart-lung preparation. These studies show that MDL 19205 is a potent, direct-acting cardiotonic agent in animals.", 
    "72": "The effects of bufuralol and its carbinol metabolite have been compared with those of propranolol in the anaesthetised and conscious cat and dog. Bufuralol and its carbinol metabolite are nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists; the former has equivalent potency to propranolol, whereas the latter is six times more potent. In anaesthetised animals both bufuralol and its metabolite exhibited partial agonistic activity, resulting in tachycardia and vasodilation. In conscious cats there was no change in heart rate or slight bradycardia, whereas in dogs both compounds again produced tachycardia. In anaesthetised and conscious cats and conscious dogs, both bufuralol and the metabolite increased abdominal aortic blood flow. There was a reduction in blood pressure in the conscious dog. It is concluded that the partial agonistic activity of bufuralol and its carbinol metabolite is exerted mainly at the beta 2-adrenoceptor, producing vasodilation and reducing peripheral resistance, resulting in a reduction in blood pressure with a long duration of action.", 
    "73": "Isolated, perfused rabbit hearts were used to identify substituted phenylethylamines selective for either chronotropic or inotropic stimulation relative to norepinephrine. Heart rate and dF/dtmax were measured; the difference in their normalized values was used as an index of selectivity. p-Octopamine (OA) showed chronotropic preference, while phenylephrine (PE) showed a significant inotropic preference. Their effects were not prevented by reserpine pretreatment, cocaine, butoxamine, or phenoxybenzamine, but were antagonized by propranolol, which suggests that OA and PE exert their selective actions directly at beta 1-receptors. These findings provide further evidence for the existence of separate chronotropic and inotropic beta-adrenergic receptors in the heart.", 
    "74": "We compared the beta-adrenoceptor stimulant actions of dobutamine and (-)-isoprenaline in isolated tissue preparations (atria, trachea, and uterus) from the guinea pig and in chloralose-anaesthetized, vagotomized cats (arterial blood pressure, heart rate, hindlimb perfusion pressure, and soleus muscle contractility). The results obtained in these experiments indicate that, on a dose basis, dobutamine shows little selectivity in producing alpha-, beta 1-, and beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated effects. In phentolamine-treated cats, reductions in arterial pressure and total peripheral resistance produced by infusions of dobutamine were little affected by the beta 2-adrenoceptor-selective antagonist butoxamine, but were antagonized by atenolol. The rise in cardiac output produced by dobutamine involved increases in both heart rate and stroke volume. There was little indication of a selective inotropic action, a feature that confirmed the results obtained in isolated atrial preparations. The increase in cardiac output appeared to involve both alpha- and beta-receptor-mediated actions, because phentolamine reduced the rise in cardiac output by reducing stroke volume.", 
    "75": "The effects of graded infusions of the beta-agonists isoproterenol (nonselective), l-prenalterol (beta 1-selective), and salbutamol (beta 2-selective) on plasma potassium and norepinephrine were compared in subjects with borderline hypertension. Potassium levels fell with all three agonists, and norepinephrine levels rose with isoproterenol and salbutamol. These effects on potassium and norepinephrine were closely correlated and occurred at the same dose ranges as the cardiovascular responses. The fall in plasma potassium was probably caused by activation of beta-receptors, mainly on skeletal muscle, with subsequent stimulation of active sodium-potassium transport across the cellular membrane. The rise in plasma norepinephrine may have been due to activation of beta-receptors on sympathetic nerve endings. Activation of these presynaptic receptors is known to enhance the release of norepinephrine during nerve stimulation. For a given increase in heart rate and cardiac contractility, as measured by the heart rate-corrected duration of total electromechanical systole, which are mainly beta 1-responses, the effects on potassium and norepinephrine were in the order: salbutamol greater than isoproterenol greater than prenalterol. beta-Blockade with propranolol (nonselective), 80 mg four times a day, or atenolol (beta 1-selective), 100 mg once a day, antagonized the hypokalemic effect of isoproterenol as well as the rise in norepinephrine, but when isoproterenol was infused in doses high enough to overcome the blockade of the heart rate response, the effects on norepinephrine and potassium were abolished by propranolol and not by atenolol. Thus, the receptors in question appear to be of the beta 2-subtype.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "76": "Cyclocytidine (CC), in addition to its antitumor properties, also causes copious flow of saliva. Calcium concentration of CC-evoked saliva from submaxillary (SM) and parotid (PA) glands of adult rats was initially 7 meq/liter and 15 meq/liter, respectively, and thus resembled that of sympathetically evoked secretion. From previous data, as well as present data, this is expected since CC apparently causes release of norepinephrine (NE) from adrenergic nerve endings. Present data also confirm that CC causes NE release since a single dose of reserpine (RES) (5 mg/kg), administered 24 hr prior to injection of CC in order to cause depletion of NE prevented the action of CC. Furthermore, the NE released by CC acts principally on beta-adrenergic receptors since propranolol administered prior to CC caused a marked reduction in flow and [Ca] of saliva, and prevented the usual CC-induced depletion of glandular calcium. An increase in [Ca] of SM but not PA gland was also caused by chronic (daily injections of 500 mg/kg body wt for 3 days) administration of CC. The same threefold increase was observed 2 days after injection of a single dose of CC also. The increase in glandular calcium was not prevented by propranolol, thus suggesting that this effect of CC on glandular [Ca] was probably not beta-mediated. The calcium increase may, however, be the result of depletion of NE. Thus, [Ca] of SM of CC-treated rats, that of RES-treated rats, and that of rats treated with RES + CC were very similar. If the mechanism of action of the two drugs were different (not NE depletion), the combined action of the two would have been additive.", 
    "77": "Intracranial injection of D-mannitol (MA) or D-glucose (GL) caused photoperiodic hyperglycemia in rats; MA injection elicited hyperglycemia only in the light period, while GL injection induced it only in the dark period. To elucidate the mechanisms of these hyperglycemias, we examined the effect of the autonomic nervous system on them in rats under the L:D (12:12) condition. Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocker, and hexamethonium, a ganglion blocker, effectively inhibited hyperglycemia induced in either the light (MA) or dark (GL) period. In contrast, phenoxybenzamine, an alpha-adrenergic blocker, and atropine, a cholinergic blocker, inhibited hyperglycemia induced in the light period (MA), but not that induced in the dark period (GL). These findings suggest that alpha and beta-adrenergic and cholinergic mechanisms are involved in the hyperglycemia induced by MA in the light period, while only the beta-adrenergic mechanism is involved in the hyperglycemia induced by GL in the dark period.", 
    "78": "The nighttime rise in pineal melatonin levels can be blocked by administration of the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, propranolol, in both Syrian hamsters and rats. Although the administration of beta-adrenergic receptor agonists such as norepinephrine or isoproterenol stimulates pineal melatonin production in the rat, these drugs are without apparent effect on indole production in the Syrian hamster. To determine whether this lack of stimulatory effect in the Syrian hamster is characteristic of this species, a comparison of the effects of norepinephrine and isoproterenol on pineal serotonin N-acetyltransferase activity and melatonin content was conducted. In contrast to their lack of effect in the Syrian hamster, norepinephrine and isoproterenol stimulated pineal serotonin N-acetyltransferase activity and melatonin content in the Djungarian hamster. Hourly injection of norepinephrine during a continuation of light into the normal dark period stimulated increases in the activity of serotonin N-acetyltransferase and melatonin content in the Djungarian hamster but was without effect on these pineal parameters in the Syrian hamster.", 
    "79": "Performing a sports profile in the hypertensive patient requires a careful assessment of the cardiovascular system. Special attention must be directed to the etiology of the disease as well as to the treatment regimen. Many individuals seeking a sports profile may, in fact, be either unaware of their hypertension or inadequately treated. Insufficient pretesting evaluation of these individuals might well place them at a higher risk for complications of testing. Modification of standard testing procedures would, therefore, be warranted, and in view of the augmented rise in both systolic and diastolic pressure with isometric exercise, avoidance of this form of exercise is advised in the untreated hypertensive patient. Finally, recognizing that antihypertensive medication can adversely affect the hemodynamic response to exercise should permit appropriate application and interpretation of the sports profile.", 
    "80": "Inhibition of the activity of semipurified renal Na+, K+-ATPase and of 3H-Ouabain binding to erythrocytes was used to titrate the level of a plasmatic endogenous inhibitor of the Na+, K+-pump. The inhibition effect of plasma extracts was specific and unrelated to vanadate, calcium and products of proteolysis. Similar results were obtained with the two procedures. An endogenous pump inhibitor could be detected in 28 plasmas of the 42 normotensives investigated so far. In 18 out of 21 normotensives born of hypertensive parent(s) the level was found to be higher than that observed in normotensive controls devoid of hypertensive heredity. 13 untreated essential hypertensives out of 21 also exhibited higher levels of the sodium-potassium pump inhibitor. Plasma levels of the inhibitor appear stable during several months in male subjects. No clear relationship could be established either in normotensives or hypertensives between the pump inhibitor level, the urinary output of Na+, and blood pressure. Neither could any relationship be established between the inhibitor and the intraerythrocytic Na+ concentration. The accuracy of the methodology allows a large scale clinical investigation. It can also be used in the purification of the substance, and preliminary results precised that its molecular weight was inferior to 1 000 daltons and that it was anionic. Purified fractions were obtained after gel filtration, ion exchange chromatography, and high pressure liquid chromatography. Preliminary results suggest that the purified fraction may interfere with the mechanisms of hypertension. They inhibited the Na+-dependent serotonin uptake by human platelets.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
