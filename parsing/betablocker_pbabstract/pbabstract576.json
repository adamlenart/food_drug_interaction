    "0": "The effects of labetalol and its R1R isomer, SCH 19927, on the accumulation of radioactivity from [3H]-noradrenaline, and on the subsequent spontaneous and nerve-evoked outflow of radioactivity have been investigated in the rat isolated right ventricle. In addition, the effect of these agents on the contractions of the electrically-driven rat right ventricle to isoprenaline and of the rat isolated aorta to phenylephrine and 5-hydroxytryptamine are reported. Labetalol and SCH 19927 (both at 10(-6)M) inhibited the accumulation of radioactivity from [3H]-noradrenaline by 26 and 37%, respectively. The spontaneous outflow of radioactivity, following loading of the ventricle with [3H]-noradrenaline, was increased by labetalol and SCH 19927 (both at 10(-6)M) by a cocaine and idazoxan-insensitive mechanism. The nerve-evoked outflow of radioactivity was increased by labetalol and SCH 19927 (both at 10(-6)M). The ability of labetalol and SCH 19927, to increase nerve-evoked outflow was maintained in the presence of cocaine (10(-5)M) or idazoxan (10(-7)M) but reversed in the presence of cocaine and idazoxan. It is suggested that labetalol and its R1R isomer act both to inhibit neuronal uptake of noradrenaline and as antagonists at prejunctional alpha 2-adrenoreceptors. Labetalol and SCH 19927 reduced the contractile responses associated with the nerve-evoked outflow of radioactivity probably mainly by acting as antagonists at postjunctional beta 1-adrenoreceptors. The contractile responses of the electrically-driven rat right ventricle to isoprenaline were inhibited by labetalol and SCH 19927. SCH 12297 (pA2 = 8.9) was 4 times more potent than labetalol (pA2 = 8.3) as a beta 1-adrenoreceptor antagonist. The ability of labetalol and SCH 19927 at greater than or equal to 10(-7)M to depress maximal responses to isoprenaline may represent membrane stabilizing activity. The contractile responses of rat aorta to phenylephrine were inhibited by labetalol and SCH 19927. Labetalol (pA2 = 7.5) was 4X more potent than SCH 19927 (pA2 = 6.9) as an alpha 1-adrenoreceptor antagonist. SCH 19927 and labetalol had no effect on contractile responses to 5-hydroxytryptamine.", 
    "1": "Effect of calcitonin (CT) upon the AP of contractile cardiomyocytes was absent under conditions of blockade of beta-adrenoreceptors with inderal which reduced the level of intracellular sodium and ionized calcium. Inderal facilitated the effect of parathyroid hormone on the myocardium electrical activity. In conditions of blockade of beta-adrenoreceptors, the CT acted upon the autorhythmic activity of pace-maker cardiomyocytes as in control solution.", 
    "2": "Timolol of 0.5% was applied in 6 eyes prior to cataract extraction, while 7 eyes were not treated. Aqueous humor was drawn after retrobulbar analgesia with 2% lidocaine and analyzed for epinephrine and norepinephrine using a radioenzymatic assay. Epinephrine levels averaged 15.8 +/- 16.2 and 19.3 +/- 27.5 pg/ml in the timolol treated group and controls respectively. The corresponding values for norepinephrine were 1.59 +/- 0.55 and 1.87 +/- 0.90 ng/ml. These differences were not statistically significant. Norepinephrine levels in this study were somewhat higher than in previous reports of catecholamine levels in human aqueous humor and considerably higher than plasma levels of norepinephrine. There was no significant correlation between aqueous humor norepinephrine levels and age in the two groups combined. The mean norepinephrine levels for men and women in the two groups combined were 1.73 +/- 0.89 and 1.76 +/- 0.56 ng/ml. The difference was not statistically significant. Timolol resulted in a decrease in the intraocular pressure.", 
    "3": "Nifedipine, a well-tolerated calcium-channel blocking drug, is known to produce a rapid and vigorous vasodilating effect on the peripheral vasculature. In order to determine its effectiveness in rapidly treating moderately severe hypertension, nifedipine was administered buccally to 63 patients. Ten-milligram capsules, perforated ten times with a 26-gauge needle, were chewed by patients to expel the viscous drug within them. If one capsule was not sufficiently effective within 20 to 30 minutes, a second capsule was administered similarly. The drug was administered to 63 patients with diastolic blood pressure of 120 mm Hg or greater, or systolic blood pressure of 200 mm Hg or greater with a diastolic blood pressure in excess of 90 mm Hg. Forty-two patients responded to 10 mg of nifedipine, with a drop in blood pressure from a mean (+/- SD) of 205.5 +/- 24.4/127.7 +/- 11.7 mm Hg to 158.6 +/- 24.7/88.8 +/- 10 mm Hg in 39.9 +/- 13.0 minutes. Nineteen patients responded to two doses of nifedipine (20 mg), with a drop in blood pressure from 212.1 +/- 27.1/128.2 +/- 17.3 mm Hg to 165.4 +/- 24.5/93.8 +/- 10.7 mm Hg after 66.0 +/- 17.8 minutes. There were no side effects and no hypotension, even among the 38 patients who had recently received other medications, including beta blockers, diuretics, hydralazine, methyldopa, captopril, and clonidine. It is our conclusion that the chewing of nifedipine capsules is a safe and effective method to lower blood pressure promptly without the use of parenteral medications.", 
    "4": "Cardiac output (CO) was measured in sodium pentobarbital-anesthetized cats over a wide range of blood flow rates. In 10 cats, CO was measured simultaneously, using Fick determination and thermodilution techniques. Echocardiography was used to estimate contractility of the heart by measuring percentage change in minor diameter and velocity of circumferential fiber shortening. These indices were compared with CO by the other techniques. Echocardiographic equations used for CO determination in man were evaluated for reliability in the cat. Thermodilution and Fick determination correlated best with low CO (r = 0.89) and less with intermediate (r = 0.69) and high (r = 0.75) CO. Percentage change in minor diameter and velocity of circumferential fiber shortening correlated with thermodilution measurements of the cardiac index (r = 0.71 and r = 0.84, respectively). The value of echocardiography for CO estimation was questionable, using existing equations. Fick determination of CO was more inconsistent and was more prone to technical error than was thermodilution.", 
    "5": "The initial antifailure efficacy of beta-adrenergic agonists is generally lost during prolonged treatment. The reasons are not fully understood. In 11 patients with advanced cardiac decompensation due to dilated cardiomyopathy, prenalterol, a selective beta 1 adrenergic agonist, improved the left ventricular contractility after acute intravenous and during prolonged oral administration. However, after periods of treatment ranging from 2 to 18 weeks, blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance were raised in each patient. These changes resulted in an increase of the left ventricular afterload which was such as to overwhelm the effects of the enhanced contractility, and to extinguish the initial improvement of the cardiac function and of the clinical condition. Stimulation of the presynaptical beta-receptors facilitating norepinephrine release or of the renin secretion by this beta 1 agonist, may be the causes of the systemic vasoconstriction and of the loss of effectiveness in the long run.", 
    "6": "The effect of 1, 2, and 5 mg/kg propranolol on the neuroelectrophysiological manifestations of CNS oxygen toxicity was studied in conscious rats. Cortical electrodes for electrocorticographic (ECoG) recording and femoral venous cannula for i.v. infusion were implanted 7 and 3 d, respectively, before the experiment. The rats were divided into 5 groups. Groups I to III were treated with 1, 2, and 5 mg/kg propranolol, respectively, and Group IV with saline. Groups I-IV were exposed to 5 ATA O2 until the appearance of the first cortical paroxysmal electrical discharges (FED), considered to be a preconvulsive electrophysiological manifestation of CNS oxygen toxicity. Rats in Group V were exposed to 5 ATA N2-O2 normoxia and treated with 5 mg/kg propranolol. After the hyperbaric exposures and the i.v. administration of propranolol a typical ECoG pattern consisting of frequent bursts of high amplitude spindle-like waves of 6-7 c/s activity was observed. In hyperbaric oxygen-exposed rats, the paroxysmal electrical discharges were always preceded by the propranolol-induced spindle wave activity (in theta range) and oxygen-induced slow wave activity (in delta range) in ECoG. Infusion of 2 and 5 mg/kg propranolol significantly delayed the time of onset of the oxygen-induced slow wave activity and the FED. It is suggested that the protective effect of propranolol against the neurological manifestations of oxygen toxicity, may be related to its multiple effects on physiological systems rather than beta adrenergic blocking action alone.", 
    "7": "The ability of digoxin and a 4-aminocardenolide, ASI-222, to alter atrioventricular nodal refractory period (AVRP) was determined as a function of the maximum subarrhythmic dose (MSAD) in the dog anesthetized with morphine-pentobarbital. ASI-222, a highly polar and potent inhibitor of Na+, K+-adenosine triphosphatase produces a cardiotoxicity in dogs prominently involving atrioventricular nodal blockade rather than ventricular premature ectopic beats and tachycardia seen with digoxin. AVRP was assessed with trains of electrically isolated stimuli of decreasing pulse interval delivered to the right atria. Digoxin and ASI-222 were infused i.v. at rates which produced cardiac arrhythmias in about 100 min in dogs either: 1) with intact nerves, 2) pretreated with atropine, 3) without reflex receptors (without vagus and carotid sinus nerves, 4) without cardiac sympathetic nerves and adrenals or 5) pretreated with metoprolol. In dogs with intact nerves, ASI-222 produced greater increases in AVRP than digoxin at fractions of the MSAD; however, both glycoside produced a similar elevation at the MSAD (approximately equal to 30% increase). Atropine did not alter the AVRP response to ASI-222 but prevented the lengthening due to digoxin except for that which occurred near the MSAD. Removal of reflex receptor afferents (and vagi) had an effect similar to atropine on the AVRP response to digoxin, but completely prevented any response to ASI-222. Prior sympathectomy or beta adrenergic blockade abolished the AVRP response to ASI-222 but did not alter the responses to digoxin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "8": "To evaluate the effect of chronic beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade on physiological adaptation to asphyxia a study was done on exteriorized sheep fetuses of 127-142 days gestational age. Eleven pregnant ewes were infused with metoprolol for 5 days prior to experiment. Another 10 ewes were infused with saline and served as controls. Asphyxia was induced by intermittent complete obstruction of maternal placental blood flow. Fetal electro-cardiogram, heart rate, cardiac output, myocardial contractility and cerebral blood flow were measured together with blood pH, lactate and hypoxanthine. Neurophysiological responses were evaluated by changes in somatosensory evoked electroencephalogram. The beta 1-blocked fetuses showed less responsiveness in myocardial contractility and heart rate during reoxygenation. This curtailed reaction resulted in accelerated lactic acidosis, increased break-down of intracellular energy rich substances and impaired cerebral function. Nine of the ten controls survived the experiment and 8 of them regained their somatosensory evoked EEG potentials, whereas 7 of the 11 beta-blocked fetuses survived and only 3 regained original somatosensory evoked EEG potentials. It is concluded that beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade impairs the adaptive responses to asphyxia in the ovine fetus and decreases its ability to survive severe asphyxia.", 
    "9": "The effects of different dosages of the beta 1-adrenoceptor blocker metoprolol and of acute and chronic administration of this beta-blocker during physical exercise were compared in healthy normotensive subjects. Placebo, 0.15 mg/kg, and 0.30 mg/kg metoprolol were administered intravenously 10 min before a progressive bicycle ergometer test up to exhaustion. Thereafter, subjects were treated for 4 weeks with placebo or slow-release metoprolol (1 X 200 mg/day). At the end of each 4th week of treatment, a maximal exercise test was performed. Heart rate, ventilation, oxygen consumption, and plasma concentrations of free fatty acids, glucose, and lactate were determined at rest and during exercise. After the low (0.15 mg/kg) i.v. dose, the heart rate during maximal exercise was reduced from 189 +/- 2 to 155 +/- 2 bts/min (P less than 0.001). This reduction was significantly smaller than that after the high (0.30 mg/kg) i.v. dose (177 +/- 3 to 137 +/- 4 bts/min, P less than 0.001) and during chronic treatment (176 +/- 3 to 132 +/- 2 bts/min, P less than 0.001). The difference between the high i.v. dose and chronic treatment was not significant. After the low i.v. dose, the heart rate was the only variable affected. After the high i.v. dose, the heart rate, exercise time, maximal oxygen uptake, and plasma glucose and free fatty acid concentration during maximal exercise were reduced, and maximal lactate concentration tended to be lower. During submaximal exercise, no significant differences between placebo or beta-blocker administration were found, except for heart rate, which was reduced after beta-blockade.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "10": "An intravenous K+-sensitive electrode has been used to monitor plasma [K+] changes induced by alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor agonists in anaesthetized guinea-pigs, rabbits and rats. The effects of phentolamine and propranolol on these responses were studied. In the guinea-pig both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor agonists produced a biphasic response consisting of an initial rapid increase in [K+] which was followed, within 1 min, by a fall below baseline. The antagonist studies indicated that in this species both phases of the response could be elicited by either alpha- or beta-adrenoceptor activation. In the rabbit the responses were both slower and smaller than those seen in the guinea-pig and required larger agonist doses. In addition it was found that the increase in plasma [K+] was alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated while the subsequent fall was seen only with beta-adrenoceptor activation. In the rat triphasic changes in plasma [K+] were seen consisting of an initial decrease which was alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated, followed by an increase and then a second fall which was elicited by beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. The increase in plasma [K+] was only slightly reduced by either alpha- or beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. Apamin, a toxin from bee venom which blocks Ca2+-activated K+-channels, was found to block the hyperkalaemic phase of the response in the guinea-pig and rabbit but had no effect in the rat. It is concluded that there are marked species differences in the effects of adrenoceptor agonists on plasma [K+] in vivo.", 
    "11": "The effects of lidocaine, procaine, procainamide and quinidine were studied on organ-cultured embryonic chick (2-3 day-old) ventricular cells. Lidocaine (10(-5) - 10(-4)M), in a dose-dependent manner, reduced the rate of pacemaker discharge, the action potential amplitude (APA), the maximum rate of rise (Vmax) of the upstroke of the action potential and the action potential duration at 50% repolarization (APD50). These changes occurred without alterations in the maximum diastolic potential (MDP). Extracellular electrical field stimulation could still evoke action potentials in cells arrested by 10(-4)M lidocaine, but 10(-3)M lidocaine completely abolished electrical activity. Procaine, procainamide and quinidine, at 5 X 10(-5)M to 10(-3)M, depolarized the cells to around -30 mV and reduced APA and Vmax. Procaine and procainamide increased APD50, but quinidine shortened it. All the effects described disappeared completely in about 40 min of superfusion with drug-free Tyrode solution. Isoprenaline (5 X 10(-7)M) and adrenaline (10(-6)M) restored spontaneous firing of preparations arrested by any of the antiarrhythmic agents and repolarized ventricular cells depolarized by procaine, procainamide or quinidine. Propranolol (5 X 10(-7)M) did not affect the depolarization produced by procaine (5 X 10(-4)M), but antagonized its reversal by isoprenaline. In contrast, isoprenaline (10(-6)M) did not produce recovery of automaticity of preparations arrested by verapamil (10(-5)M). Histamine (10(-5)M) or strontium (10 mM) were not able to restore rhythmic activity in cells arrested procaine. Application of long (10-15 s duration) hyperpolarizing currents did not reverse the blocking effect of procaine, procainamide and quinidine. The input resistance increased during the procaine-induced depolarization. It is suggested that the four agents studied block the slow Na+ channels responsible for the upstroke of the action potential in young chick heart cells. A drug-induced decrease in PK may occur in those cells arrested at low levels of membrane potential.", 
    "12": "beta-Adrenergic blockers are considered the drugs of choice in the management of the hyperadrenergic state in hyperthyroidism. However, we observed a patient in thyroid storm and coma who failed to respond to large doses of oral and intravenous propranolol hydrochloride but who responded promptly to intramuscular reserpine. Reserpine may have been lifesaving and should be considered in propranolol-resistant hyperthyroidism and in hyperthyroid patients in whom propranolol is contraindicated.", 
    "13": "Disease processes affecting the aorta are gaining increasing attention as average longevity of the population in this country increases and as awareness of conditions such as hypertension and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease improves. Aortic dissection is commonly seen as a manifestation of these processes in the aging population and is the most common catastrophic illness affecting the aorta. Familiarity with its pathogenesis, diagnosis, and therapy is mandatory to prevent almost certain death if left untreated.", 
    "14": "A double-blind crossover study was performed on 27 patients with proved fixed coronary artery disease and stable angina pectoris. The study was designed to compare the relative efficacy of two combination therapies, nifedipine plus propranolol and isosorbide dinitrate plus propranolol, in terms of antianginal response and effect on exercise tolerance by evaluation of treadmill testing. The combination of nifedipine and propranolol was superior to the combination of isosorbide and propranolol in reducing the number of anginal attacks (p = 0.03), increasing total exercise time (p less than 0.02), increasing oxygen consumption achieved at end of exercise (p less than 0.03), increasing time to onset of pain (p = 0.003) and increasing oxygen consumption achieved at onset of pain (p = 0.003). Analysis of the rate-pressure products suggests that the difference in these results may be explained by the greater effect of nifedipine on afterload reduction. Although nitroglycerin consumption was reduced from baseline levels during combination nifedipine therapy (p less than 0.001), there was no statistical difference between nifedipine combination therapy and isosorbide combination therapy. In conclusion, although both combination therapies were superior to propranolol therapy alone, the combination of nifedipine and propranolol was more effective than the combination of isosorbide and propranolol in reducing the incidence of angina and improving exercise performance. Side effects were experienced at a similar frequency during both combination therapies.", 
    "15": "We describe a patient who ingested 5 g of atenolol with ethanol. After awakening, with repeat toxicology screen only showing atenolol, and in spite of normal voluntary breathing mechanics, he had marked suppression of his spontaneous respirations as measured by minute ventilation and by occlusion pressure with no incremental response to hypercapnic challenge. Subsequently, he recovered. Although we are unable to prove a causal relationship, future patients with atenolol overdose should be observed carefully for ventilatory failure, even if fully conscious.", 
    "16": "It has recently become possible to study platelet aggregation in whole blood which may more closely resemble the in-vivo situation as the platelets are left in their natural milieu with red and white cells present which themselves can influence aggregation. The effects of 4 adrenoceptor antagonists on platelet aggregation in whole blood were studied in-vitro using the Clay-Adams Ultra Flo 100 whole blood platelet counter. Labetalol, pindolol and propranolol inhibited aggregation to 0.5 microgram/ml collagen in a dose dependent manner, and were synergistic with prostacyclin in inhibiting collagen induced aggregation. These 3 drugs also promoted reversal of aggregation induced by 10 microM ADP, but only inhibited 0.5 mM arachidonic acid induced aggregation at high drug concentrations. Atenolol had no effect on either collagen, ADP or arachidonic acid induced aggregation. The anti-platelet effect of these drugs may be of value in the treatment of vascular disease.", 
    "17": "Some adverse effects of beta-blockers in heart failure are counteracted by glycerylnitrate. However, the hemodynamics in this condition after giving both drugs are not well known. We examined the drug combination in exercising coronary patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was a measure of dysfunction. A right-heart catheterization with three successive exercise stress tests was done in 40 patients. At repeated exercise without drugs a \"warming up\" phenomenon was observed, consisting of small but statistically significant reductions in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and heart rate. At exercise propranolol reduced heart rate, cardiac output, systemic blood pressure, left ventricular work, and increased arteriovenous oxygen difference. Glycerylnitrate reduced pulmonary capillary wedge pressure at exercise, but, contrary to the findings at rest, it did not increase heart rate or reduce cardiac output. The drug combination resulted in hemodynamics that were similar to those after propranolol alone, except for a lower pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. The drug combination allowed the patients to exercise with the benefits of the beta-blocker, but at a lower ventricular filling pressure. Thus, the potential hazard of giving beta-blockers to patients with left ventricular dysfunction may be reduced by adding glycerylnitrate.", 
    "18": "The effect of germ cells or germ cell fractions on adenylate cyclase (AC) activity in membrane preparations from cultured rat Sertoli cells has been examined. Whole germ cells or 30,000 X g pellet or supernatant fractions of germ cells have the ability to stimulate Sertoli cell AC to levels comparable to those measured in follicle-stimulating hormone-stimulated Sertoli cell membranes. Treatment at 100 degrees C but not 60 degrees C for 1 min abolished the ability of germ cell preparations to stimulate Sertoli AC. Germ cell stimulation of Sertoli cell AC was not calcium dependent, was not blocked by propranolol, and was observed to be dose dependent.", 
    "19": "The hypothesis that carotid body chemoreceptor activation with hypoxic-hypercapnic blood elicits reflex coronary vasodilation was investigated. Circumflex or anterior descending coronary artery blood flow was measured in alpha-chloralose-anesthetized, closed-chest dogs. To minimize changes in cardiac metabolism, the heart was paced at a constant rate after atrioventricular heart block, propranolol (1 mg/kg) was given to prevent beta-receptor-mediated alterations in cardiac contractility, and aortic blood pressure was stabilized by means of a blood reservoir. The carotid body regions were vascularly isolated and perfused at constant pressure with arterial blood or hypoxic-hypercapnic blood. Under these conditions, carotid body chemoreceptor stimulation with hypoxic or hypoxic-hypercapnic blood for 90 s produced atrial bradycardia and a transient increase in coronary blood flow of 36-53% above prestimulation values. The augmented coronary flow was accompanied by a transient increase in coronary sinus O2 tension of 4.6-5.7 mmHg. Aortic blood pressure varied less than 10 mmHg. Intracarotid injections of nicotine (0.1 microgram/kg) or cyanide (150 micrograms) produced similar results. The coronary response to chemoreceptor stimulation with hypoxic blood or drugs was abolished when the reflex arc was interrupted with atropine (0.5 mg/kg). It is concluded that transient reflex parasympathetic coronary vasodilation is elicited by hypoxic or hypoxic-hypercapnic stimulation of carotid body chemoreceptors.", 
    "20": "Pindolol, a beta blocker with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, was investigated in a randomised controlled trial of 100 patients presenting within 12 hours of uncomplicated acute myocardial infarction. Pindolol was given intravenously for 24 hours and orally for 48 hours to achieve serum levels above 10 ng/ml. Heart rate and arterial pressure, both systolic and diastolic, fell to a similar degree in actively treated and control patients. There was no significant difference between systolic blood pressure-heart rate product in actively treated and control patients during the first 72 hours of therapy. There was no increased incidence of cardiac failure, bradycardia, or AV conduction disturbance among pindolol-treated patients. Infarct size estimated from cumulative enzyme release did not differ significantly from controls regardless of whether pindolol was given within four hours or between four and 12 hours of symptom onset. However, fewer patients given pindolol within four hours required morphine. Use of pindolol during the acute phase of myocardial infarction did not appear to modify clinical course, hemodynamic determinants of myocardial oxygen demand, or enzymatically determined infarct size.", 
    "21": "Patients with chronic schizophrenia were treated with either propranolol (640 mg daily) or thioridazine (400 mg daily). In a double-blind study lasting five weeks, propranolol was superior to thioridazine on both psychiatrists' and nurses' ratings. Significant improvements were noted with propranolol in both positive (Type I) and negative (Type II) symptoms.", 
    "22": "The intraocular pressure lowering effect of 2 commercial preparations of timolol maleate was studied in 57 adult outpatients suffering from open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Special attention was paid to side effects of topical treatment with timolol, while comparing the efficacy of the 2 preparations. The intraocular pressure lowering effect with each strength (0.25% and 0.5%) of both preparations (Blocanol and Oftan-Timolol) was identical. No clearcut effect on lacrimal gland function, accommodation, or pupil size was seen. The adverse effects of timolol maleate during 6 months of treatment were of transient nature and generally mild. The only serious adverse effect was respiratory distress which occurred with 0.25% timolol in one patient. The respiratory distress developed slowly and the trial had to be discontinued for this patient after 2 months of treatment. There was a tendency toward a decrease in blood pressure and heart rate with both commercial preparations.", 
    "23": "Fifty patients with open-angle glaucoma were treated twice daily for one year with topical 0.5% levobunolol, 1% levobunolol, or 0.5% timolol. Both concentrations of levobunolol were as effective as timolol in reducing intraocular pressure over the one-year period. At the concentrations tested, levobunolol and timolol decreased heart rate to a similar extent, suggesting that systemic absorption occurred after topical instillation. In all three treatment groups, clinically insignificant changes in blood pressure were observed sporadically throughout the one-year period. Very few clinically significant toxic ocular reactions were observed.", 
    "24": "The effect of a synthetic analogue of encephalin was studied experimentally in 150 rabbits with neoepinephrine-induced myocardial necrosis to whom the drug was administered intravenously at the rate of 100 micrograms/kg, 1 and 6 hours later. Necrotic developments were assessed on the basis of MB CPK and LDH activity and myoglobin levels. Control animals received saline solutions or propranolol in equimolar doses. In encephalin-treated animals, enzyme activity and myoglobin values were significantly lower, an evidence of encephalins' favorable effect on the course of neoepinephrine-induced myocardial necrosis.", 
    "25": "Previous studies have shown that labetalol, a new alpha- and beta-adrenergic antagonist, is relatively safe for the treatment of hypertension in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This multicenter study was designed to evaluate its effects in hypertensive patients with asthma and propranolol sensitivity. Hypertension was successfully controlled in 18 of 21 patients who received labetalol in increasing doses, up to 1,200 mg/day. The decrease in mean FEV1 (1.5 percent) two hours after the highest dose of labetalol was not statistically significant, although there was a gradual decline in mean baseline FEV1 during the four-week treatment period. Antihypertensive agents other than adrenergic antagonists should be considered for the management of hypertension in patients with asthma, especially those with marked reversibility of airflow. If treatment with beta-adrenergic antagonists is indicated, labetalol is recommended over other currently available agents.", 
    "26": "Enzymatic activity of submandibular gland (SG) kallikrein released into saliva and blood was studied at rest and after autonomic nerve stimulation. Kallikrein was measured by an immunometric assay that allows measurement of immunoreactive kallikrein in complex with inhibitors as well as simultaneous determination of kallikrein enzymatic activity. Measurements using the chromogenic substrate S2266 gave identical results to the natural substrate kininogen. Endogenous SG kallikrein secretory rate was, at rest, 0.9 +/- 0.1 ng/min. Kallikrein secretion into blood in response to autonomic nerve stimulation paralleled that into saliva, and secretion was greatly enhanced by alpha-adrenergic stimulation. In plasma, kallikrein was bound to several inhibitors that completely or partially blocked the enzyme activity. In arterial and SG venous control plasma, 93 +/- 3 and 72 +/- 10% inhibition of kallikrein enzyme activity was observed, respectively. Sympathetic stimulation after administration of a beta-adrenergic blocker increased kallikrein enzyme activity 62 and 11 times in arterial and SG venous plasma, respectively, with a corresponding 78 +/- 8 and 70 +/- 8% inhibition of kallikrein enzyme activity. A fraction containing kallikrein resembling \"free kallikrein\" was always present in plasma.", 
    "27": "We evaluated the antihypertensive efficacy of \"once-a-day\" minoxidil, given in conjunction with a diuretic and sympatholytic, and the effect of this simple regimen on patient compliance. Twenty-one severely hypertensive patients had their existing antihypertensive regimens changed to a single daily dose of chlorthalidone (50-100 mg) and either nadolol (160 mg) or reserpine (.25 mg) for a 3-week period. After stabilization on these two drugs, a single daily dose of minoxidil (2.5 mg) was added to each patient's regimen. Doses were titrated as necessary to achieve diastolic blood pressures of less than 90 mmHg. After 3 and 6 months of maintenance therapy, blood pressures were measured 24 hours after the previous day's dosing to evaluate the persistence of the antihypertensive effect. Twenty-four-hour blood pressure control was achieved on 76% of these occasions, and on at least one occasion in 90% of the patients. In addition, compliance was excellent.", 
    "28": "To analyze the autonomic mechanism on heart rate (HR) variations, pharmacological studies were performed on 8 healthy subjects and 6 diabetic patients. Three HR variations--in supine resting position, during deep breathing in supine position (respiratory HR variations), and on standing (orthostatic tachycardia; delta HR)--were examined. The results in healthy subjects and diabetics were similar. After administration of parasympathetic blockade with atropine, respiratory HR variations were almost abolished. However, no significant difference in delta HR was found. With the addition of beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol, delta HR was remarkably reduced. Propranolol alone did not affect the respiratory HR variations, but after propranolol administration delta HR was significantly reduced compared with that of the control. The present studies show that respiratory HR variations are predominantly mediated by parasympathicus, whereas orthostatic tachycardia is mediated by both sympathicus and parasympathicus, particularly by sumpathicus. This result suggests the possibility of discriminating the impairment of the 2 cardiac autonomic nervous systems by these simple and non-invasive tests.", 
    "29": "In both isolated canine ventricular trabecular muscle and Purkinje strand preparations, dl-sotalol and its two optical isomers d- and l-sotalol produced a concentration-dependent increase in action potential duration while other transmembrane electrical characteristics were not significantly affected. The magnitude of the increase in action potential durations was greater in Purkinje strand preparations. In Purkinje strand preparations, the effect was rate dependent (i.e., the increase in duration was proportionately greater when stimulation frequency was slowed). From the concentration of each compound calculated to produce a 50% maximal increase in Purkinje fiber action potential durations, d-sotalol appeared to be one to three times more potent than either l-sotalol or the racemate. Each compound appeared to increase force development in ventricular trabecular muscle preparations stimulated at a frequency of 2 Hz. Increased force development was only observed in Purkinje strand preparations stimulated at slower rates (0.5-0.33 Hz). These results are unlike those produced by other beta-adrenergic blockers and suggest that the antiarrhythmic effects of sotalol are related primarily to its effect of action potential duration. The estimated potency ratios established for the effect of dl-sotalol and its optical isomers on both trabeculae and Purkinje fiber action potential durations (d greater than dl-l) may indicate that these effects are unrelated to the beta-adrenergic blocking properties of these compounds. The differential effect of sotalol on isolated trabeculae and Purkinje strand preparations may help to explain the clinically reported phenomenon of sotalol-induced torsade de pointes.", 
    "30": "The aim of the present study was to establish equieffective doses of propranolol (PROP) and bufuralol (BUF) in man. Both drugs compete for radioligand binding of 3H-CGP 12177 at beta-adrenoceptors of rat reticulocytes with Ki-values of 6.7 (PROP) and 19.6 (BUF) ng/plasma in the mean. In contrast to PROP, which is a pure antagonist, BUF shows partial agonism with an intrinsic activity around 5% (relative to isoprenaline) in vitro. After i.v. injection of cumulative doses of both drugs to 10 healthy volunteers, drug present in plasma occupies beta-adrenoceptors in vitro in a dose-dependent manner up to 80%. In man the full beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline (8 micrograms/min for 3 min) induces an increase in heart rate by 73%, an increase in stroke volume by 47%, a decrease in total peripheral resistance by 63% and a shortening of the preejection period by 70%. PROP exerts effects in man in the opposite direction of isoprenaline (at resting state), whereas BUF does not influence heart rate and stroke volume to a significant extent. Only the preejection period and total peripheral resistance are influenced in analogy to the isoprenaline effects. A direct comparison of the effects of PROP and BUF at 50% in vitro receptor occupancy by the respective plasma samples shows the clear-cut qualitative differences between the pharmacodynamics of both drugs in man as expected from the comparison of the full agonist isoprenaline and the antagonist propranolol. It is concluded that only on the basis of the respective receptor occupancy one may delineate pharmacodynamic differences of different drugs of the same class in man.", 
    "31": "The role of phospholipase (PLase) on the mechanism of the so called \"down regulation\", which decreases the number of beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-AR) of rat cardiac membranes during successive beta-agonist administration, was investigated. In vivo study: The rats were divided into 3 groups: (1) the control group, untreated; (2) the isoproterenol (ISP) one day group, ISP (10 mg/kg) was subcutaneously injected once; and (3) the ISP 6 days group, ISP (10 mg/kg) was injected once a day for 6 successive days. Binding assay using [3H] dihydroalprenolol and analysis of the content and the composition of fatty acids in phospholipids in cardiac membranes were conducted. The endogenous PLase activity in heart homogenate and tissue ATP levels were also determined. In the 6 days group, the equilibrium dissociation constant of beta-AR was not affected; however, the number of beta-AR decreased significantly when compared with the control group. Phospholipid content also decreased in parallel with the decrease in the number of beta-AR and the composition of fatty acids was altered. However, in the one day group, there were no significant changes in either the number of beta-AR or the phospholipid content. The PLase activity of heart homogenate increased significantly, and the tissue ATP levels decreased in both the one day and the 6 days group. In vitro study: Cardiac membranes prepared from intact rats were incubated with 0.03 and 0.1 unit of PLase A2. PLase A2 reduced the number of beta-AR dose-dependently.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "32": "The major sites of action in the nervous system of the various types of drug used in the treatment of hypertension were considered, together with some of their advantages and disadvantages. Consideration was given to the way in which the circulation may be controlled, particularly in hypertension, and the difficulties of using various drugs to analyse controlling mechanisms. The assessment of sympathetic activity and over-activity was also considered, since this remains an area of great difficulty, both in man and in other animals.", 
    "33": "In hypertension, changes of cardiac anatomy and function are not just a simple consequence of the increased pressure load. The sympathetic nervous system activity is one of the factors which may influence the cardiac performance, and possibly also the cardiac anatomy of hypertensive patients. Several clinical studies have provided evidence of a subset of patients, usually with mild or borderline hypertension, with an increased cardiac performance, higher plasma catecholamine concentrations and/or greater response to beta-adrenergic stimulation. Animal studies have strongly suggested a possible role of adrenergic factors in the development of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). In man, plasma catecholamines are usually higher in hypertensive patients with LVH, and a correlation between left ventricular mass and plasma noradrenaline has also been observed. An impaired response to beta-adrenergic stimulation has been reported in hypertensive animals and in patients with LVH. Several studies have also suggested that reversal of LVH may be more easily induced by those antihypertensive drugs that reduce, or at least do not stimulate, the sympathetic activity, although exceptions to this statement may be observed.", 
    "34": "An increase in plasma renin activity (PRA) following experimental coronary occlusion has previously been demonstrated in anaesthetized and conscious dogs. The purpose of the present study was to analyse the mechanism of this renin release. In two distinct models of myocardial ischaemia in anaesthetized dogs--i.e. occlusion of the left-anterior descending coronary artery (model A, n = 21) and atrial pacing in the presence of stenosis of the left-anterior descending coronary artery (model B, n = 23), an increase in arterial PRA was found from 1.68 +/- 0.43 to 3.06 +/- 0.63 ng ml-1 h-1 (model A, mean +/- SEM, P less than 0.025) and from 9.87 +/- 3.59 to 14.96 +/- 4.06 ng ml-1 h-1 (model B, P less than 0.05), respectively. The increase in PRA following coronary occlusion was not blunted by adrenergic beta-receptor blockade with propranolol (3 mg kg-1 i.v.; n = 4). Coronary sinus PRA was lower than arterial PRA and the increase in PRA did not occur in nephrectomized dogs (n = 5). The data suggest that myocardial ischaemia induces a release of renin from the kidney which is not mediated by adrenergic beta receptors.", 
    "35": "Cardiac hyperactivity and its consequent metabolically induced coronary vasodilation (MCD) were studied in isolated, perfused, electrically paced rat hearts. The alpha-adrenoceptor agonists, phenylephrine and methoxamine, produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of the inotropic responses to noradrenaline, dobutamine, isoprenaline, tyramine, and glucagon, while relatively potentiating their MCD reactions. This inhibition was unrelated to the alpha-agonists' known inotropic action and was not affected by catecholamine depletion of the heart. Withdrawal of the alpha-agonists or administration of the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists phentolamine, phenoxybenzamine, or prazosin returned the inotropic and MCD reactions to normal. Neither the MCD response to electrically induced tachycardia nor the inotropic reactions produced by calcium chloride were affected by alpha-adrenoceptor agonists or antagonists. Alone, alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists were shown to potentiate the inotropic responses to noradrenaline and isoprenaline while the MCD was relatively diminished. The responses to glucagon were unaltered by alpha-antagonists. We postulate that myocardial reactivity to sympathetic stimulation can be modulated through alpha-adrenoceptors by the inhibition of processes that mediate cardiostimulation at post-beta-adrenoceptor sites, together with facilitation of those leading up to MCD. Accordingly, this modulation would act to prevent ischaemic damage to the heart by acting to limit the inotropic responses to increasing sympathetic stimulation while maximizing the blood supply to the myocardium.", 
    "36": "Affinities of denopamine, a new cardiotonic agent, and several beta-adrenergic drugs for turkey erythrocyte membranes (TEM) and rat reticulocyte membranes (RRM) which contain homogeneous beta 1- and beta 2-receptors, respectively, were studied by receptor binding. The order of potencies of denopamine and several beta-adrenergic agonists in displacing 3H-dihydroalprenolol binding (Ki, nM) in TEM was isoproterenol (Iso, 27) greater than norepinephrine (Nor, 360) greater than epinephrine (Epi, 860) greater than dobutamine (DB, 1380) greater than denopamine (1540) greater than dopamine (DA, 49500). The order in RRM was Iso (7.3) greater than Epi (58) greater than DB (750) greater than Nor (1090) greater than denopamine (2300) greater than DA (26800). In the presence of GTP, competition curves for full agonists like Iso, Epi and Nor shifted to the low affinity side (Ki values increased by 300-500% in TEM and 200-460% in RRM), and the slopes were steepened in both membrane preparations. The Ki value for denopamine increased only in TEM (70%) and that in RRM was not influenced by GTP. This suggests that denopamine has an agonist property at the beta 1-receptor but not at the beta 2-receptor and that the intrinsic activity at the beta 1-receptor of the drug is lower than full agonists. Affinities of DB and DA for TEM were influenced by GTP as well as those for RRM, although the extent of the rightward shift was less than full agonists.", 
    "37": "The binding of DSM fluorescent probe with erythrocyte membranes in conditions of the organism high and low adrenoreactivity was studied in guinea pig. The dependence of DSM binding on the level of adrenoreactivity was shown by probe luminescence in the range of 615 nm. Specific and unspecific types of the DSM bindings with erythrocyte membranes were revealed. In high adrenoreactivity, an increase of specific binding places (Nsp) and a decrease of specific binding constant (Ksp) were found whereas in low adrenoreactivity the Nsp decreased and the Ksp increased.", 
    "38": "Effects of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) on the electrical and contractile activities of the fundus and antrum of the cat stomach were studied using the sucrose-gap technique. In the fundus, low concentrations of 4-AP (up to 1 mmol/l) induced membrane depolarization and appearance of spike potentials and phasic contractions. After preliminary administration of atropine, 4-AP produced an opposite effect: hyperpolarization and relaxation. On the background of tetrodotoxin (TTX) plus antagonists of cholinergic and adrenergic receptors, high concentrations of 4-AP (greater than 5 mmol/l) caused membrane depolarization and appearance of spike potentials and phasic contractions. In the antrum, 4-AP in low concentrations (up to 1 mmol/l) decreased both the amplitude and the duration of the second component of the plateau-action potential, as well as those of the phasic contractions. This effect decreased in the presence of adrenergic receptor antagonists and was abolished by TTX. On this background, high concentrations of 4-AP (greater than 5 mmol/l) led to the appearance of spike potentials superimposed on the second component of the plateau-action potentials, and to a further increase in the phasic contraction amplitudes. The present data suggest that 4-AP exerts its effects via an increase in neurotransmitter release (low concentrations) and/or directly on the smooth muscle cell membrane (high concentrations).", 
    "39": "Rats (Fisher F-344) were given free access to a 10% sucrose solution containing 0.5 mg/ml morphine sulfate (controls received the sucrose vehicle only) as their sole source of fluid. Daily morphine intake averaged 119 +/- 21 mg/kg, an amount sufficient to induce physical dependence. After 18 days on this regimen, the control and dependent subjects were sacrificed. A protracted abstinence group was weaned from morphine by reducing its concentration in the vehicle by 20% over the next 5 days, followed by a 5-week drug-free period before sacrifice concurrent with the other groups. These subjects showed no signs of an abstinence syndrome. Binding assays for alpha-2 adrenergic sites (3H-clonidine), beta-1/beta-2 adrenergic sites (3H-dihydroalprenolol), and dopaminergic (D2)/serotonergic (5-HT2) sites (3H-spiroperidol) were performed on tissue from frontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and brainstem. No alterations in 3H-clonidine or 3H-dihydroalprenolol binding were observed in dependence or protracted abstinence, suggesting that noradrenergic systems are well-regulated both during dependence and in protracted abstinence. 3H-spiroperidol binding was significantly elevated in the striatum (D2 sites) and hippocampus (5-HT2 sites) during dependence. Hippocampal 3H-spiroperidol binding returned to control levels in protracted abstinence, reflecting a morphine-induced change in 5-HT2 binding sites which had normalized by 5 weeks post-drug. Striatal 3H-spiroperidol binding was significantly decreased below control levels after withdrawal, suggesting that alterations of D2 sites in this structure may play a role in protracted abstinence.", 
    "40": "Protein kinase activity of lymphocytes isolated from human subjects was assayed using histone as substrate. The activity was stimulated about twofold by cyclic AMP and total enzyme activity, determined in the presence of cyclic AMP, was inhibited by 65% by the specific heat-stable inhibitor of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. Histone phosphorylation was not stimulated by cyclic GMP in the presence of the inhibitor. Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase could be activated in vitro by incubating intact cells with isoproterenol or with forskolin and was reflected by a significant (P less than 0.05) increase in the protein kinase activity ratio. In contrast to these well-characterized adenylate cyclase activators, incubating cells for up to 2 hr in vitro in the presence of the specific beta-blocker propranolol had no significant effect on the amount of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase that was in the activated state. When compared in subjects between the ages of 21 and 74 years, lymphocyte protein kinase activity was unaltered by age or gender. These results indicate that cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase is of the cyclic AMP-dependent variety in the human lymphocyte. A low amount of the cyclic AMP-dependent activity (about 15%) is in the already activated state in freshly isolated cells, and this is not further reduced by incubation in vitro or by beta-blockade. In contrast to previously reported changes in the capacity to synthesize cyclic AMP, lymphocyte protein kinase is unaltered by gender or age in human subjects.", 
    "41": "Immunoneutralization of endogenous gonadal steroids has recently been shown to modify pineal beta-adrenoceptor function in intact Merino ewes. In the current study, interactions between gonadal steroids and these receptors have been further investigated. beta-Adrenoceptor density and binding affinity both showed time-related changes in ewes; the significance of these changes requires further study. Two observations, firstly modification of beta-adrenoceptor function by androstenedione and 17 beta-estradiol in ovariectomized, but not in intact ewes, and secondly that steroid-mediated effects on receptor density and binding affinity in the pineal of ovariectomized Merino ewes could be demonstrated during anestrus, but not during the breeding season for intact ewes, indicate that gonadal steroids may regulate pineal beta-adrenoceptor variables in Merino ewes. It is suggested that gonadal steroids may regulate ovine pineal function in ewes, and that the seasonal differences in sensitivity of luteinizing hormone release to steroid feedback may be mediated in part via effects on the pineal gland.", 
    "42": "Electrical field stimulation (5 Hz)- or high K+ (20 mM)-evoked release of endogenous norepinephrine from superfused rat hypothalamic slices in the presence of cocaine (20 microM) was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography with an electrochemical detector. Apomorphine (10-1000 nM) dose-dependently facilitated the electrically evoked release. Apomorphine (1 microM)-induced facilitation was abolished by pretreatment with yohimbine (100 nM), was converted to inhibition by yohimbine (1 microM), but was not antagonized by propranolol (300 nM). Epinephrine (100 nM) decreased the electrically evoked release and the decrease was antagonized by yohimbine (100 nM) and by apomorphine (100 nM), but not by S-sulpiride (100 nM). In the presence of yohimbine (1 microM), apomorphine (10-1000 nM) dose-dependently inhibited the electrically evoked release. Furthermore, in the presence of tetrodotoxin (300 nM), apomorphine (100 nM) also decreased the high K+-evoked release and this decrease was antagonized by S-sulpiride (100 nM). Dopamine produced biphasic actions on the electrically evoked release, a dose-dependent decrease at 30 and 100 nM and an increase at 300 and 1000 nM. Dopamine (300 nM)-induced increase was antagonized by propranolol (300 nM) but not by yohimbine (100 nM). The dopamine (100 nM)-induced decrease was antagonized by S-sulpiride (1 nM), but not by the R-isomer. S-sulpiride (10 to 100 nM) alone dose-dependently increased the electrically evoked release, whereas the R-isomer had no effect. Haloperidol (100 nM) also increased the electrically evoked release.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "43": "The density and functional responsiveness of adrenergic receptor subtypes were determined in tissues from control, hyperthyroid and hypothyroid rats. There was a decrease in sensitivity to isoproterenol in spontaneously beating right atria, electrically driven left atria and field-stimulated vas deferens associated with hypothyroidism, with no change in maximum response. Hyperthyroidism increased the potency of isoproterenol in right atria, but not in left atria or vas deferens. The maximal response to isoproterenol was greatly reduced in hyperthyroid left atria. The potency of procaterol, a partial agonist at beta adrenergic receptors in right atria, was unaltered in hyper- or hypothyroidism, although the maximum stimulation by procaterol was increased in hyperthyroidism. Scatchard analysis of specific [125I]pindolol binding showed that beta adrenergic receptor density was greater in hyperthyroidism than in hypothyroidism in left atria, right atria, ventricles, vas deferens and cerebral cortex, although the proportions of beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptor subtypes did not change. There was no change in the responsiveness of alpha-1 adrenergic receptors mediating contraction of caudal artery and vas deferens or mediating [3H]inositol phosphate accumulation in cerebral cortex in hyperthyroid or hypothyroid rats, although the maximal contraction of caudal artery was significantly reduced in hyperthyroidism. Scatchard analysis of specific [125I]BE 2254 binding showed that alpha-1 adrenergic receptor density was significantly decreased in the ventricles from hyperthyroid rats and increased in the ventricles of hypothyroid rats, but was unchanged in vas deferens, caudal artery and cerebral cortex. Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor density in cerebral cortex, determined by Scatchard analysis of specific [3H] rauwolscine binding, was not altered in hyperthyroid or hypothyroid rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "44": "Insulin, in doses sufficient to cause systemic hypoglycemia, decreases vascular resistance; however, a vasoactive effect of insulin in humans, in the absence of hypoglycemia, is unknown. Venous occlusion strain gauge plethysmography was utilized to determine forearm blood flow (FBF) and forearm vascular resistance (FVR) during incremental intra-arterial infusion of insulin (0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 mU/kg/min) in seven normal subjects. With the increasing doses of insulin, FBF increased 55, 76 and 145% and FVR decreased 30, 42 and 58%, respectively. Systemic glucose concentration decreased only during the highest dose insulin infusion. In eight subjects who received insulin during euglycemic glucose clamping, FVR also decreased. Therefore, it was demonstrated that insulin dilates the forearm vasculature in the absence of hypoglycemia. In order to determine whether the vasodilatory effect of insulin was mediated by the sympathetic nervous system, plasma levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine were measured. During the incremental insulin infusions, norepinephrine levels did not change, but epinephrine concentration increased during the 1.0 mU/kg/min infusion when hypoglycemia developed. Furthermore, 21 subjects were pretreated with intra-arterial phentolamine, propranolol or the combination of phentolamine and propranolol. Phentolamine did not potentiate the fall in FVR during insulin administration; however, propranolol attenuated or completely inhibited the changes in FBF and FVR. During combined alpha and beta adrenergic blockade, insulin increased FBF and decreased FVR only during the higher dose insulin infusions. It is concluded that insulin causes forearm vasodilation primarily via a beta adrenergic mechanism. In addition, at the higher doses used in this study, insulin may decrease FVR directly or by a mechanism other than adrenergic stimulation.", 
    "45": "Adrenergic stimulation of LRM55 glial cells results in the release of the neuroactive amino acid taurine. The present study characterizes the receptors involved in taurine release and shows that taurine release is mediated by cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP). beta-Receptors in LRM55 cells were first characterized by [125I]iodohydroxybenzylpindolol binding. Binding was stereospecific and saturable with time and ligand concentration. Kinetic analysis of equilibrium binding at 37 degrees C revealed a single component of high affinity (Km = 113 pm; Bmax = 52.1 +/- 5.0 fmol/mg of protein). The pharmacologies of the stimulation of cAMP accumulation and taurine release were similar. The agonists isoproterenol (IPR), epinephrine (E) and norepinephrine (NE) showed a rank order of potency characteristic of a beta-adrenergic system (IPR greater than E greater than or equal to NE). The beta-antagonists alprenolol and propranolol inhibited the IPR stimulation of both processes; the alpha-antagonist phentolamine did not. The dependence of taurine release on cAMP was further suggested by the similarity of the two time courses and was demonstrated by the stimulation of taurine release by the cAMP analogue dibutyryl cAMP. Thus, one physiological response of glial cells to beta-adrenergic stimulation is the release of taurine. Receptor-activated release of taurine from glia represents a previously undescribed neuronal-glial interaction by which glia may actively regulate neuronal excitability.", 
    "46": "Procaterol is a new and effective beta-adrenergic bronchodilator. To determine if procaterol administration could cause tachyphylaxis, airway and leukocyte beta-adrenergic function were monitored in 10 patients with asthma during two 4-wk, double-blind treatment periods, each preceded by a 2-wk beta-agonist washout. Treatment periods were randomized to placebo or procaterol (2 wk, 0.1 mg/day; 2 wk, 0.2 mg/day). At each 7 biweekly evaluations, the patient's cumulative bronchodilator dose-response to inhaled isoproterenol (0.1 to 0.64%) was measured, and venous blood was collected to quantitate, in vitro, the polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) beta-adrenergic receptor's 125Iodo-cyanopindolol (125I-CYP) ligand binding and the PMN cyclic AMP response to isoproterenol and procaterol. Neither the airway nor leukocyte beta-adrenergic characteristics were changed during placebo treatment. Procaterol treatment reduced (p less than 0.05) the maximal 125I-CYP binding to PMN membranes but only during the initial 2 wk at low dosage. The percent PMN cyclic AMP increase to procaterol (10(-5) M) was also significantly (p less than 0.05) less during active treatment (141 +/- 40%) than during washout (256 +/- 24%) or placebo (257 +/- 32%). In contrast, procaterol treatment did not alter the acute isoproterenol bronchodilation response as measured by either the percent improvement in FEV1 or the dose required to produce 50% maximal bronchodilation. The duration of bronchodilation was not measured. Therefore, although procaterol therapy of asthma is associated with decreased PMN beta-adrenergic function, airway smooth muscle function appears not to be altered.", 
    "47": "We examined the effects of environmental light and prior treatment with an agonist on vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) binding and VIP stimulation of cAMP accumulation in the rat pineal gland. VIP binding to pinealocytes and cAMP accumulation in response to VIP were significantly increased in animals kept exposed to constant light compared to those in animals experiencing a dark night before the experiments. Scatchard analysis of [125I]VIP binding indicated the presence of two classes of binding sites: high affinity, low capacity sites and low affinity, high capacity sites. The increased VIP binding to pinealocytes in rats maintained in constant light was attributed to an increase in the number of available VIP receptors at both high and low affinity sites. The affinity of VIP binding to cells was not affected by exposure of the animals to light. VIP stimulation of cAMP accumulation was not inhibited by d,l-propranolol. Prior treatment of pinealocytes with VIP decreased [125I]VIP binding by reducing the number of receptors and significantly inhibited subsequent VIP stimulation of cAMP accumulation. Prior treatment with norepinephrine did not alter the number of VIP receptors. Our results strongly suggest that VIP is a neuromodulator of pineal function.", 
    "48": "The mechanism by which noradrenaline stimulates ouabain-sensitive rubidium uptake in guinea-pig myocardial tissue has been studied. The stimulatory action of low concentrations of noradrenaline was reversed by high doses of propranolol (10(-5) mol/l) in atrial tissue, but was not reversed by alpha- or beta-, or combined alpha- and beta- adrenoceptor antagonists in ventricular tissue. Rubidium uptake was also found to increase with increasing extracellular potassium concentration [( K]o). The percentage values of stimulation by noradrenaline decreased with increasing [K]o. Noradrenaline had no effect on the rate of ATP splitting by an isolated membrane preparation of Na,K-ATPase. It is proposed that noradrenaline stimulates active cation transport by either (a) an effect secondary to increased passive efflux of K ions, or (b) an action at a novel adrenergic receptor, distinct from the ATPase enzyme itself.", 
    "49": "The possibilities for therapy in the field of severe cardiac insufficiency have been extended in recent years by the introduction of novel agents endowed with a positive inotropic action. These substances may be arranged in two large classes: sympathomimetic agents and \"non sympathomimetic--non digitalis-like\" inotropic agents. The stimulant action of noradrenaline, adrenaline and isoproterenol on beta-adrenergic myocardial receptors has been clearly demonstrated but the usefulness of these medicines is limited by their positive chronotropic and arrhythmogenic actions. Dopamine and dobutamine have proved to be very useful in the treatment of patients in intensive care units. However, the exclusively intravenous route of administration limits their importance to the medium or long term. Several compounds, which are active by the oral route, have been the subject of therapeutic trials for the short or medium term. The problems posed by their use result, in the first place, from an insufficient understanding of their mechanism of action. Some of them (pirbuterol, salbutamol, terbutaline, penoterol) seem to act preferentially on B2 adrenergic receptors and the haemodynamic effect results, in part or predominantly, from the vasodilator action which they cause. On the other hand, other agents (prenalterol, ICI 108-87) show a relative selectivity for B1 adrenergic receptors. Ibopamine exerts its action on B1 receptors and dopaminergic receptors. A second problem concerns the hypothetical character of their long term therapeutic activity. A major problem in the use of several of these sympathomimetic agents in chronic treatment is the appearance of a desensitization of the beta receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "50": "We hope that the reader is impressed with the relatively limited amount of information available about the effects of drugs on breathing during sleep in both normal subjects and patients with sleep-disordered breathing. Although more reports are appearing, well-controlled evaluations remain limited in number. We believe that this information gap will quickly close because it is now increasingly appreciated that either spontaneous or drug-induced breathing abnormalities measured during wakefulness may be strikingly magnified during sleep. Therefore, this area of investigation is exciting. Finally, we hope the reader shares our view that, to date, drug therapy for sleep apnea has limited efficacy.", 
    "51": "1-Arylpiperazines (MK-212, quipazine, m-chlorophenylpiperazine and m-trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine) caused a serotonin (5-HT) receptor-mediated contraction of rat fundic strips. m-chlorophenylpiperazine and m-trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine had high affinity for the receptor but little efficacy, whereas quipazine and MK-212 had lesser affinity and much greater efficacy. 5-HT itself was the most potent (EC50 = 6-9 nM) agonist and possessed the greatest affinity (KA = 9.7 nM). Assessment of receptor occupancy vs. functional response (as well as receptor alkylation studies) demonstrated a very small, if any, receptor reserve in this tissue. Several arylquinolizines were found to be competitive antagonists of 5-HT-induced contraction, the most potent being L-653,267 and rauwolscine (KB values = 1.9 and 3.8 nM). Clozapine, trazodone and propranolol were identified as less potent, competitive antagonists, whereas various ergolines (including LY 53857), L-646,462 (cyproheptadine analog) and mianserin were noncompetitive. Potent 5-HT2 receptor antagonists (pirenpirone and ketanserin) antagonized only weakly or were without effect against 5-HT, indicating that the fundic 5-HT receptor is not of the 5-HT2 subtype. Because the fundic receptor has high affinity for 5-HT (as does the 5-HT1 binding site in brain tissue), the possible correspondence of the fundic 5-HT receptor with the 5-HT1 recognition site in rat brain cortex was considered. 5-HT, the nonindole agonists (1-arylpiperazines) and the competitive antagonists all competed with [3H]-5-HT for the 5-HT1 site. However, all compounds except 5-HT had Hill slopes significantly less than 1.0, precluding a valid comparison with dissociation constants derived pharmacologically in the fundus. With respect to having a high affinity for 5-HT, the 5-HT receptor mediating contraction of fundic smooth muscle resembles the 5-HT1 recognition site (as defined in brain tissue by radioligand binding), but identity remains unproven.", 
    "52": "The demonstration that antihypertensive drug treatment reduces mortality and morbidity in mild hypertension has extended the indications for treatment. Verapamil, nitrendipine, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs are all equally effective in reducing blood pressure. The choice of drug depends on the presence or absence of specific contra-indications and the occurrence of side effects in individual patients.", 
    "53": "Adrenaline may increase noradrenaline release and enhance sympathetic pressor effects through activation of pre-synaptic beta 2-adrenoceptors. Conversely, blockade of beta 2-receptors could lead to a fall in blood pressure. To test this hypothesis we performed a double-blind placebo controlled crossover study in nine patients with mild hypertension, comparing the effects of the beta 2-selective blocker ICI 118,551, 50 mg t.i.d. with those of propranolol, 80 mg t.i.d. Two hours after the first dose of ICI 118,551 or propranolol, plasma noradrenaline and blood pressure remained unchanged while heart rate and renin were reduced. After 1 week, blood pressure was significantly reduced by both drugs. The beta 2-selectivity of ICI 118,551 was confirmed by isoprenaline infusion studies. After 1 week of treatment ICI 118,551 had no effect on the beta 1-receptor mediated shortening of electromechanical systole (QS2I), the rise in systolic pressure and rise in renin, whereas these responses were blocked by a dose factor of eight after propranolol. ICI 118,551 and propranolol equally blocked the beta 2-receptor mediated fall in diastolic pressure and the rise in noradrenaline. We conclude that beta 2-selective blockade by ICI 118,551 lowers blood pressure. This finding is compatible with a role of pre-synaptic beta 2-receptors in blood pressure control.", 
    "54": "In order to investigate whether addition of beta 1-selective agonism can interfere with the antihypertensive efficacy of beta 1-selective adrenoceptor blockers, two separate studies were carried out to evaluate the effects on blood pressure and heart rate of three beta 1-selective blockers with or without varying degree of beta 1-selective agonism. In hypertensive patients at rest, the greatest blood pressure reduction and bradycardia were found with atenolol, a beta 1-selective blocker without any agonistic activity; a consistently smaller effect on blood pressure and heart rate was observed with Visacor (ICI 141 292), a beta 1-selective blocker with moderate beta 1-selective agonism, whereas no clinically relevant decrease in blood pressure occurred with Corwin (ICI 118 587), the beta 1-selective blocker with high beta 1-selective agonism. In contrast, during exercise-induced sympathetic activation, all three compounds reduced systolic blood pressure and heart rate to a similar degree.", 
    "55": "The effects of beta-blockers on glucose tolerance, insulin secretion and peripheral insulin sensitivity were evaluated by oral glucose tolerance test and euglycaemic insulin technique in six normoglycaemic patients with primary arterial hypertension at the end of 3-week treatments with placebo (one tablet twice daily) and propranolol (80 mg twice daily). Body weight did not change during the study (83 kg at the end of placebo, 83 kg at the end of propranolol), while blood pressure (150 +/- 9/97 +/- 8 mmHg on placebo, 138 +/- 8/89 +/- 8 mmHg on propranolol, P < 0.01) and heart rate (66 +/- 9 beats/min on placebo, 60 +/- 5 beats/min on propranolol, P < 0.05) showed a significant fall on the beta-blocker. No change was observed in glucose tolerance (incremental area for glucose 3462 +/- 1149 mg/dl per min on placebo, 3209 +/- 1695 mg/dl per min on propranolol), insulin secretion (incremental area for serum insulin 7579 +/- 4380 microU/ml per min on placebo, 7934 +/- 4351 microU/ml per min on propranolol) and peripheral insulin sensitivity (metabolic clearance rate 11 +/- 4 ml/kg per min on placebo, 13 +/- 6 ml/kg per min on propranolol). These data support the hypothesis that chronic treatment with adrenergic blocking agents does not induce any significant change in insulin secretion or peripheral insulin sensitivity.", 
    "56": "Celiprolol is a cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, with interesting propranolol-insensitive cardiostimulatory, vasodilatory and bronchodilatory effects. Recent reports suggest that mild alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonism may contribute to these effects. The present investigation further explored the alpha 2 effects of celiprolol. In isolated electrically-stimulated rat atria celiprolol (1.0 and 10 mumol/l) significantly increased the release of [3H]-norepinephrine, consistent with the blockade of pre-junctional alpha 2-adrenoceptors. Evidence for post-synaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist activity was obtained in studies of the effects of celiprolol on the pressor response to clonidine and either phenylephrine or methoxamine in perfused hind-limbs of dogs (pretreated with mecamylamine and propranolol) and pithed rats. In the dog, celiprolol (10 mg/kg) significantly inhibited the vasoconstrictor response of clonidine while in the rat higher doses were required (> or = 12.5 mg/kg). Celiprolol did not affect the pressor response induced by alpha 1-agonists. We conclude that celiprolol possesses a mild alpha 2-adrenoceptor blocking action which may contribute to its unconventional profile.", 
    "57": "The antihypertensive effect of labetalol was evaluated in 18 adult black patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension previously controlled with a combination of a diuretic and a beta blocker. After a 4-week washout period, standing blood pressure had increased from 138 +/- 2.2/85 +/- 1.5 mmHg, (mean +/- SEM) to 154 +/- 1.9/100 +/- 0.6 mmHg. Labetalol was then titrated to a maximum of 600 mg BID to obtain a standing diastolic blood pressure of less than or equal to 90 mmHg and/or a decrease of greater than or equal to 10 mmHg from baseline (end of washout period). By the end of the labetalol titration period, standing blood pressure had decreased to 140 +/- 2.0/84 +/- 1.5 (p less than 0.01). Following a 2-week maintenance period, standing blood pressure was 136 +/- 1.6/80 +/- 1.5 mmHg (NS vs. titration). Labetalol therapy was well tolerated and reduced diastolic blood pressure to less than or equal to 90 mmHg in 17 of 18 patients, 13 of whom required dosages less than or equal to 300 mg BID. The average reduction in standing heart rate while on labetalol was 4 bpm (p less than 0.01). Side effects were limited to skin rash in one patient and possible mild urinary retention in another. These data indicate that labetalol is an effective antihypertensive for black patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension.", 
    "58": "The release of PGI2-like activity into the circulation in response to cholinergic agonists and modification of this response by beta-adrenergic antagonists was investigated in anaesthetized cats and healthy humans. Antiaggregatory activity in the arterial blood was continuously assayed by measuring platelet aggregation on blood superfused collagen strip. In some of the human experiments, after the administration of the drugs, the conversion of [14C]-arachidonate to [14C]-prostaglandins in the pulmonary vascular bed was studied. Cholinergic agonists stimulated the release of PGI2-like activity into the circulation, which effect was potentiated in cats by beta-adrenergic antagonists. In humans the latter agents did not stimulate the conversion of [14C]-arachidonate to prostaglandins in the pulmonary circulation and, moreover, inhibited the stimulatory cholinergic effect. The results suggest that an interplay between cholinergic and beta-adrenergic mediators may be involved, although in a different way in cats and in humans, in the release of PGI2-like activity into the systemic circulation.", 
    "59": "The effects of serotonin on pentagastrin- and bethanechol-stimulated gastric mucosal blood flow (GMBF) and acid secretion were evaluated. Conscious gastric fistula dogs were used, with neutral red clearance as the method to estimate the mucosal blood flow. Serotonin inhibited the acid secretion, with a counteracting effect of propranolol and methysergide. Serotonin inhibited the pentagastrin- and bethanechol-stimulated GMBF after 15 min of infusion. The ratio between GMBF and acid secretion was increased during serotonin infusion, which suggests primary and independent changes in both variables. Propranolol and methysergide counteracted the serotonin inhibition of the GMBF. It may be concluded from this study that the acid-inhibitory effect of serotonin is not mediated by changes in the GMBF. The actions of serotonin on acid secretion and GMBF are mediated by specific receptors.", 
    "60": "The effect of serotonin on pentagastrin-stimulated gastric pepsin secretion in dogs was evaluated with regard to dose-response kinetics and receptor mediation. The pepsin secretion showed a dual response to exogenous serotonin. The high and low doses of serotonin stimulated, whereas the doses in between inhibited. The inhibition was of a non-competitive type and could be significantly counteracted by beta-adrenergic blocking drugs. This study supports the concept that the serotonin effect on gastric functions is mediated via sympathetic nerves releasing noradrenaline.", 
    "61": "Sigmoid motility, stimulated by the octapeptide of cholecystokinin (OP-CCK) and the effects of beta-adrenoceptor agonists, was studied in 12 healthy subjects in a randomized, double-blind fashion. Sigmoid pressure was recorded 18-20 cm from the anus, and contractile activity quantified as the area under pressure waves for three 25-min periods. OP-CCK (sincalide), 80 ng X kg-1 X h-1, was continuously infused throughout each session, resulting in a high sigmoid motility index. Preceded by a control period, terbutaline (beta-2 agonist), prenalterol (beta-1 agonist), or placebo was injected on 3 separate days. After 1 mg + 4 mg prenalterol or 0.25 mg + 0.25 mg terbutaline intravenously no significant changes in motility pattern were seen compared with the control period. Terbutaline and prenalterol infusions were followed by a dose-dependent increase of systolic blood pressure and heart rate. After placebo no effect on blood pressure or heart rate was seen. The study shows that CCK significantly enhances sigmoid motility in man and that selective beta-adrenergic agonists do not show any inhibitory influence on colonic motility stimulated with CCK. Since terbutaline inhibits sigmoid and rectal motility in man during rectal distention, it is suggested that the inhibitory effect of beta-2-adrenoceptor agonists may be dependent on the mode of background stimulation of the colon.", 
    "62": "Patients with the irritable bowel syndrome were studied with regard to the effects of beta-adrenoceptor agonists on rectosigmoid motility. Pressure was recorded with a continuously inflated balloon in the upper rectum and recorded from a pressure catheter in the sigmoid colon. On different days the beta-2 agonist terbutaline, the beta-1 agonist prenalterol, and placebo, respectively, were administered intravenously after a control period. During each examination contractile activity was quantified for three consecutive periods of 25 min. Terbutaline in a total dose of 0.50 mg decreased sigmoid motility index significantly from 3.0 +/- 0.6 (SEM) to 1.1 +/- 0.3 kPa X min (p less than 0.01). After less than or equal to 5 mg prenalterol no significant changes of motility index were observed. After placebo an increase, although not significant, in contractile activity was seen compared with the initial control period. Rectal motility indices were low and not changed by the beta agonists. The serum concentrations of the drugs were within the therapeutic limits used in clinical practice and caused a dose-dependent increase of both systolic blood pressure and heart rate. It is concluded that beta-2 adrenoceptor stimulation significantly decreases sigmoid motility whereas the motility index seems to be unaffected by beta-1 adrenergic stimulation.", 
    "63": "In the mouse, injection (subcutaneously) of the putative 5-HT1 agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), produced a dose-related hypothermia (ED50:0.36 mg/kg). A maximum response was elicited by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of 8-OH-DPAT (3 micrograms) and almost abolished by lesion of 5-HT-containing terminals in the brain with 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT; i.c.v.) or long-term treatment with p-chlorophenylalanine. The response was unaltered by a range of neurotransmitter antagonists: prazosin (alpha1-adrenoceptor), idazoxan (alpha2-adrenoceptor), metoprolol (beta1-adrenoceptor), erythro-DL-1-(7-methylindan-4-yloxy)-3-isopropylamino-but an-2-ol (beta2-adrenoceptor), (-)propranolol or (+/-)pindolol (beta-adrenoceptor), flupenthixol (dopamine) or Ro 15-1788 (benzodiazepine binding site). Classical 5-HT antagonists (methysergide, metergoline, cinanserin and methiothepin) were either without effect or facilitated the response and the 5-HT2 antagonist, ritanserin was also without effect. In contrast, quipazine and haloperidol produced a dose-related antagonism of the response. Since the response was almost abolished by a lesion induced by 5,7-DHT and was antagonised by quipazine, which is known to antagonise presynaptic 5-HT function in vitro, it is suggested that the hypothermic response is due to 8-OH-DPAT acting as an agonist at a presynaptic 5-HT receptor, which also appears to be sensitive to butyrophenones (the antagonism elicited by haloperidol but not by flupenthixol). The hypothermic response of mice to 8-OH-DPAT, therefore, may provide a simple and convenient in vivo model in which to measure the function of the presynaptic 5-HT receptor.", 
    "64": "Rat brain cortex slices preincubated with 3H-serotonin were superfused with physiological salt solution containing the serotonin uptake blocker DU 24565 (6-nitroquipazine). The effects of (+/-)-cyanopindolol and its enantiomers, of ICI 118,551 (erythro-dl-1-(7-methylindan-4-yloxy)-3-isopropylaminobut an-2-ol) and of isoprenaline on the electrically (3 Hz) evoked 3H overflow were studied. (+/-)-Cyanopindolol increased the evoked 3H overflow; this effect was prevented by preexposure to the previously characterized serotonin receptor antagonist metitepin. The concentration-response curve of unlabelled serotonin for its inhibitory effect on the electrically evoked 3H overflow was shifted to the right by (+/-)-cyanopindolol (apparent pA2 value: 8.29), whereas that of noradrenaline (determined in the absence of DU 24565) was not affected (apparent pA2 value: less than 6.0). The concentration-response curve of serotonin was also shifted to the right by (-)-cyanopindolol (apparent pA2 value: 8.30) and (+)-cyanopindolol (6.83) but not by ICI 118,551 (less than 5.5). Isoprenaline (up to 10 mumol/l; examined in the absence of DU 24565) did not influence the electrically evoked 3H overflow. The present results show that the presynaptic serotonin autoreceptor is blocked by cyanopindolol in a stereoselective way. This drug is 20 times more potent than metitepin as an antagonist at the presynaptic serotonin autoreceptor, and, in contrast to the latter, it does not act as an antagonist at the presynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptor on the serotoninergic neurone.", 
    "65": "The properties of beta-adrenoceptors in rat vas deferens were examined using radioligand binding assays of 125I-pindolol(125IPIN) and inhibition of electrically-evoked contractions of vas deferens in vitro. 125IPIN labelled a single class of high affinity binding sites with apparently mass action kinetics in membrane preparations of vas deferens with properties consistent with an essentially homogeneous population of beta 2-adrenoceptors. Isoprenaline inhibited electrically evoked (60 V, 1.0 ms, 0.1 Hz) contractions of vas deferens with an EC50 of 18.0 +/- 2.1 nM. KB values for antagonists in competitively antagonizing this response correlated well (r2 = 0.99) with the KD values for inhibition of 125IPIN binding. Inhibition of 125IPIN binding by isoprenaline, adrenaline, noradrenaline and salbutamol was determined under conditions designed to produce high and low affinity agonist binding. In the presence of 10 mM MgCl2, agonists inhibited specific 125IPIN binding with a relatively high potency and low Hill slope, while in the presence of 154 mM NaCl and 300 microM guanosine-5'-triphosphate, agonists inhibited specific 125IPIN binding with a lower potency and an apparent Hill slope closer to 1. To determine which affinity state was relevant to functional receptor stimulation, receptor density was decreased with bromoacetylalprenololmenthane (BAAM). Treatment of membrane preparations with 0.3 microM BAAM produced a 45% decrease in the Bmax for 125IPIN with no change in the apparent KD. Treatment of intact vasa deferentia with increasing concentrations of BAAM resulted in a progressive rightward shift in the dose-response curve to isoprenaline or salbutamol followed by a decreased maximum response. KA values for isoprenaline and salbutamol in activating the functional beta-adrenoceptors were compared with KI values for agonist inhibition of specific 125IPIN binding. The KA values for both agonists were not significantly different from the low affinity KI values, but were significantly different from the high affinity KI values. These data suggest that 1) a homogeneous population of beta 2-adrenoceptors inhibiting contraction of rat vas deferens can be labelled with 125IPIN, 2) there is a substantial beta-adrenoceptor reserve in rat vas deferens; and 3) the initial event in signal transduction by beta-adrenoceptors in rat vas deferens is the binding of agonists to the low affinity form of the receptor which is not complexed with the guanine nucleotide binding protein.", 
    "66": "In a single blind clinical trial the effects of Tobanum (chloranolol), a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker, on 450 patients were examined. The side effects were detected by placebo control. Complaints were recorded on a questionnaire in the placebo period as well as in the active treatment period. Every fourth patient reported complaints in the placebo period and every third had a new complaint in the active period. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of the complaints indicated that Tobanum has mainly cardiorespiratory side effects judging from the beta-blocker characteristics. The study draws attention to the need for awareness of complaints in the placebo period for correct evaluation of side effects.", 
    "67": "The effect of beta-adrenergic stimulation on insulin binding was studied in human fat cells in vitro. Isoproterenol rapidly (approximately 5 min) reduced insulin binding through a beta-adrenergic and dose-dependent mechanism. The reduced binding was enhanced by the addition of adenosine deaminase and was also elicited by the addition of dibutyryl cAMP. This effect was due to a decreased number of binding sites. The reduction was rapidly reversed by propranolol (t1/2 approximately 10 min) and other beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agents. Insulin binding was also measured in fat cells from 6 patients with a phaeochromocytoma. A significant negative correlation between tracer binding and the log value of total urinary catecholamine excretion was found (r = -0.821, p less than 0.05). Mean tracer insulin binding was reduced about 30% as compared to cells from 16 carefully matched control subjects. Decreased insulin binding was again mainly attributable to a decreased number of binding sites. Thus, beta-adrenergic stimulation, both in vitro and in vivo, leads to a decreased number of binding sites for insulin in human fat cells.", 
    "68": "The steady state pharmacokinetics of flestolol, a short acting beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, were studied in six healthy subjects following intravenous infusion of six different doses; 18, 24, 35, 50, 75 and 100 micrograms kg-1 min-1, for 60 min. Steady state blood levels increased linearly with dose for all six subjects. The overall mean half-life was 6.5 min. The total body clearance averaged 208 ml min-1 kg-1 indicating significant extrahepatic metabolism of the drug. There were no significant changes in the half-lives or the total body clearances after the six doses, suggesting that the kinetics of flestolol are linear over the dose range studied.", 
    "69": "The effects of single oral doses of bucindolol (50, 100, 200 and 400 mg), pindolol (10 mg), propranolol (160 mg) and placebo on arterial pressure and heart rate in the supine and standing positions and exercise heart rate were compared in 12 healthy male volunteers. Supine heart rate was significantly greater after all four doses of bucindolol and pindolol in comparison to propranolol. Bucindolol had no significant effect on standing heart rate which was significantly reduced by pindolol and propranolol. Bucindolol, pindolol and propranolol significantly reduced an exercise tachycardia for at least 24 h after drug administration. Supine systolic pressure was not affected by any treatment but supine diastolic pressure was significantly reduced by bucindolol (200 and 400 mg) and by pindolol. All doses of bucindolol, propranolol and pindolol significantly reduced standing systolic blood pressure. There was a significant linear trend for reductions in standing systolic blood pressure and increasing doses of bucindolol. Standing diastolic blood pressure was significantly reduced by bucindolol 200 and 400 mg. Faintness and light headedness occurred in 6 of 12 subjects after 200 mg bucindolol and in 8 of 10 subjects after 400 bucindolol. After bucindolol, analysis of plasma samples demonstrated the presence of bucindolol, 5-hydroxy and 6-hydroxy bucindolol and indolyl-t-butylamine. These observations indicate that in man, bucindolol is a beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug with hypotensive activity and probably partial agonist activity. It is unlikely that the hypotensive effects result from blockade of beta-adrenoceptors or from the drug's partial agonist activity.", 
    "70": "Two studies were performed each in six normal volunteers in order to find evidence of either a physiological or pharmacological role of presynaptic alpha- and presynaptic beta-adrenoceptors in man. In Study 1 subjects received a 60 min infusion of guanfacine 3 mg (alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist) preceded by either idazoxan (alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist) or vehicle. Guanfacine reduced plasma noradrenaline concentration by approximately 30% and this fall was not antagonised by the alpha 2-receptor antagonist. The 30-fold increase in plasma growth hormone, measured as a marker of the central action of guanfacine, was almost completely blocked by idazoxan. A comparison of the drug concentrations of idazoxan and guanfacine, together with their relative affinities for alpha 2-adrenoceptors, suggested that the idazoxan could not block the peripheral actions of guanfacine and that these were responsible for the fall in plasma noradrenaline concentration. In Study 2 adrenaline 0.05 micrograms kg-1 min-1 was infused for 80 min preceded by either idazoxan or vehicle. After vehicle, adrenaline caused no change in plasma noradrenaline concentration whereas it rose approximately 25% after administration of idazoxan. This was probably due to unmasking of presynaptic beta-adrenoceptor stimulation by adrenaline when the opposing inhibitory autoreceptor was blocked.", 
    "71": "The metabolism of metoprolol was studied in 143 unselected hypertensive patients and in 10 families. The log10 metoprolol to alpha-hydroxymetoprolol urinary ratio was bimodally distributed and was correlated with the debrisoquine oxidation phenotype (rs = 0.81, P less than 0.001). The results of the pedigree study were compatible with poor hydroxylation of metoprolol being inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. The major urinary metabolite of metoprolol metabolism was H117-04, the end-product of O-dealkylation. The distribution of the log10 metoprolol to H117-04 (M/H117-04) urinary ratio was unimodal. However, there was a significant correlation between this ratio and the debrisoquine oxidation phenotype (rs = 0.68, P less than 0.001) and poor metabolisers of debrisoquine (PMs) were concentrated at the upper end of the range of M/H117-04 values. These results indicate that both the alpha-hydroxylation and O-dealkylation of metoprolol are under polymorphic control of the debrisoquine type. Plasma concentrations of metoprolol were about three times higher in PMs than in extensive metabolisers of debrisoquine (EMs) at 3 h after dosing. In a sub-group of 24 subjects, all seven PMs but only two EMs showed more than a 10% reduction in post-exercise heart rate at 24 h after dosing.", 
    "72": "The treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is first and foremost symptomatic, its aim being to counteract dyspnea, angina pectoris, syncopes and lipothymias, palpitations. In therapy, use is made of beta-blockers, propranolol in particular at moderate or high doses, which are often efficacious but readily cause muscular asthenia. Calcium antagonists, especially verapamil, are a therapeutic alternative, often more efficacious but exposing the patient to the risks of iatrogenic effects which are sometimes serious and may even be fatal. Surgical myomectomy is another alternative, the functional results of which are remarkable, more often than not, but the mortality at surgery, although declining progressively, is not negligible and leads to this approach being used only in cases not responding to medical treatment as when infra-aortic septal hypertrophy is accompanied by an \"obstruction\". The second type of therapeutic approach is the treatment and prevention of rhythmic disorders which are an integral part of the risk of sudden death. Reduction of auricular fibrillation must play a role in the prevention of thrombo-embolic disease. Ventricular arrhythmias, especially sustained attacks of ventricular tachycardia systematically detected by ambulant ECG, ought to be prevented by anti-arrhythmics: beta-blockers, in combination or not with anti-arrhythmics of class I, amiodarone, propafenone, etc.", 
    "73": "The release of prostacyclin (PGI2) as measured by the production of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha was assessed in vitro in rat tail artery segments after exposure to norepinephrine (NE). Time course studies demonstrated a three fold increase in 6-keto-PGF1 alpha production in response to 6 X 10(-5) M NE that persisted for approximately one hour. This production was almost completely prevented by the cyclooxygenase inhibitors indomethacin and ibuprofen and the phospholipase inhibitor mepacrine. Vigorous rubbing of the vessel intima did not prevent the response to NE. Previously stimulated tissues were unresponsive to further addition of NE. However, the addition of arachidonic acid following NE resulted in further increases in PGI2 production which exceeded that of the addition of arachidonic acid alone. NE stimulation was significantly inhibited by phentolamine and prazosin pretreatment of the tissues but was not affected by yohimbine or propranolol. Alpha-1 adrenergic agonists (cirazoline, methoxamine, and phenylephrine) were stimulatory whereas alpha-2 agonists in high doses (tramazoline, BHT-920, xylazine, and UK-14304) were without effect. It is concluded that norepinephrine stimulates PGI2 production in the rat tail artery via an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor. NE also enhances the conversion of arachidonic acid to PGI2. Exhaustion of the response appears to be due to consumption of available arachidonic acid. The fact that procedures which generally remove most of the endothelium did not prevent NE-induced stimulation points to the vascular smooth muscle as the likely source of adrenergically mediated prostacyclin generation in this tissue.", 
    "74": "Photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) has been used to examine the aggregation in aqueous NaCl solution of a series of antidepressant and antihistamine drugs (hydrochlorides of imipramine, clomipramine, amitriptyline, butriptyline, protriptyline, doxepin, dothiepin, iprindole, diphenhydramine, bromodiphenhydramine, orphenadrine) propranolol hydrochloride and propantheline bromide. Critical micelle concentrations were measured by surface tension and PCS. Micellar sizes were investigated as functions of drug structure and drug and NaCl concentration. Generally, antidepressants formed the largest micelles. We propose that the antidepressants aggregate in a similar fashion to the phenothiazines by stacking with size increasing by addition of single monomers to stacks and by addition of more stacks to the aggregate.", 
    "75": "In an attempt to evaluate the effect of the sympathetic nervous system on the postnatal maturation of the parotid gland, rats were either sympathetically denervated on one side by avulsion of the superior cervical ganglion within 4 h after birth or treated with various beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents from the day of birth. Four or 9 weeks later the animals were killed and the parotid glands were subjected to quantitative morphological studies. The neonatal denervation caused a significant decrease in parotid acinar cell size and their granule content, whereas chronic beta-adrenoceptor blockade was without any effect. It is suggested that the trophic effect of the sympathetic nervous system may be due to a growth factor released from sympathetic nerve endings, which does not seem to interact with the beta-adrenoceptor system.", 
    "76": "Exposure to the beta-adrenergic agonist, metaproterenol, elicits extensive receptor loss and desensitization of adenylate cyclase activity in the hamster DDT1, MF-2 cell line. The reappearance of beta-adrenergic receptors and restoration of adenylate cyclase activity were investigated. Receptor reappearance was investigated under conditions in which lost receptors were not detectable either on the cell surface or within the cell. Exposure to metaproterenol resulted in a 3-5-fold decrease in beta-adrenergic receptor affinity for agonist, an 85% reduction in beta-adrenergic receptor number per cell, and a 65% reduction in isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity without any change in NaF-stimulated enzyme activity. The rate of reappearance of the lost receptors was proportional to the concentration of metaproterenol to which the cells were initially exposed. Metaproterenol, at a concentration of 250 microM, induced long-term receptor loss which required 16 days in fresh media devoid of metaproterenol before the full complement of receptors reappeared. This prolonged receptor loss may be due to residual metaproterenol; however, the resensitization of isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was restored 2 days after removal of metaproterenol. The lag period for the reappearance of receptors was shortened by incubation with either the beta-adrenergic antagonist, nadalol, or the glucocorticoid, methylprednisolone. Both pharmaceuticals reversed receptor down-regulation and up-regulated receptor number in control cells, although the extent and time course of restoration were different. These data suggest that the process of resensitization in DDT1 cells involves rapid restoration of adenylate cyclase activity and a slower reappearance of receptors over a time period of six population doublings.", 
    "77": "The effects of YM-12617 on the electrophysiological properties of smooth muscle membranes and prejunctional nerve terminals and contractions evoked by different procedures were studied using guinea-pig mesenteric and pulmonary arteries. In concentrations over 1 nM, YM-12617 inhibited the depolarization induced by norepinephrine in both muscle tissues. Yohimbine had no effect whereas prazosin inhibited the norepinephrine-induced depolarization to a lesser extent than YM-12617. When YM-12617, in concentrations over 1 microM, was applied to the mesenteric artery the amplitude of the first excitatory junction potential evoked by a train stimulation of perivascular nerves was inhibited, but the facilitation of excitatory junction potentials evoked by frequencies over 0.1 Hz was enhanced. As a consequence, the amplitude of the excitatory junction potentials after completion of the facilitation exceeded the control, as was expected to occur with a typical alpha-2 adrenoceptor blocker. YM-12617 inhibited the contraction evoked by exogenously applied norepinephrine or perivascular nerve stimulation, with a higher potency than seen with prazosin, but this agent had no effect on the contraction evoked by excess concentrations of K+ or by direct muscle stimulation. These results indicate that YM-12617 possesses a more potent alpha-1 adrenoceptor blocking action than does prazosin, and is more selective for alpha-1 than for alpha-2 adrenoceptors.", 
    "78": "The interactions of the atypical agonists pindolol and celiprolol with beta adrenergic receptors were compared with those of the full agonist, isoproterenol. Studies were carried out using intact cells as well as membranes prepared from C6 glioma cells. Computer-assisted analysis of dose-response curves resulting from the inhibition of the binding of [125I]iodopindolol by the beta-1 and beta-2 selective compounds ICI 89,406 and ICI 118,551 revealed that approximately one-third of the beta adrenergic receptors on these cells were beta-1 receptors. Addition of GTP to the binding assay simplified the dose-response curve for inhibition of the binding of [125I]iodopindolol by isoproterenol and diminished the potency of the agonist. GTP had no effect on the binding of pindolol or celiprolol, suggesting that these drugs do not induce the formation of a ternary complex with the receptor and the guanine nucleotide-binding protein for stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity. When added to the growth medium of intact C6 cells, isoproterenol induced a 40-fold increase in cyclic AMP accumulation. Pindolol and celiprolol, however, caused no elevation of enzyme activity. Addition of isoproterenol to the growth medium of intact cells resulted in an 80% decrease in the density of both beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors within 8 hr. Growing cells in the presence of pindolol or celiprolol induced a 50% decrease in the density of beta-2 receptors, which was inhibited by beta adrenergic antagonists.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "79": "Guinea-pig isolated atria were incubated and loaded with [3H]-noradrenaline. The release of 3H and of [3H]-noradrenaline was induced by field stimulation (6-9 trains of 150 pulses at 5 Hz). The stimulation-evoked overflows of 3H and of [3H]-noradrenaline were determined. In the absence of an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase, acetylcholine (12 min preincubation before nerve stimulation, up to 10 microM) failed to inhibit the evoked [3H]-noradrenaline overflow. In the presence of atropine, an increase by acetylcholine of evoked release was observed in the same atria. In contrast, the selective muscarinic agonist methacholine significantly decreased the evoked overflow. The inhibition was antagonized by atropine. Methacholine did not enhance release in the presence of atropine. When present for only 2 min, acetylcholine 10 microM inhibited the evoked overflow and no facilitation of release was observed in the presence of atropine. In the presence of physostigmine, acetylcholine (12 min preincubation, 1 and 10 microM) inhibited evoked [3H]-noradrenaline overflow, but the overflow was increased by acetylcholine 10 microM in the presence of atropine. In the presence of cocaine, corticosterone, phentolamine, propranolol and hexamethonium together, acetylcholine 1 microM inhibited the evoked [3H]-noradrenaline overflow. The inhibition was significantly enhanced in the presence of physostigmine. It decreased with preincubation time of the agonist, despite the presence of physostigmine and constant replacement by new drug. Neither inhibition nor facilitation of evoked release was observed in the presence of atropine. It is concluded that a muscarinic inhibition by acetylcholine (upon prolonged exposure time) may be masked by a concomitant facilitation of release and/or desensitization of the muscarinic inhibitory mechanism. Furthermore, degradation by acetylcholinesterase contributes in part to the ineffectiveness of acetylcholine as a presynaptic inhibitor. When a distortion of the overflow/release ratio was excluded, adrenergic and nicotinic effects were prevented, and acetylcholinesterase was inhibited, the fading of muscarinic inhibition by acetylcholine may have been exclusively due to a slow and moderate desensitization of the presynaptic muscarinic mechanism.", 
    "80": "Eight hundred fifty-seven radiocontrast media (RCM) procedures were performed from 1974 to 1984 in 743 patients who previously had experienced an immediate generalized (anaphylactoid) reaction to RCM. During the 695 intravascular infusions of RCM, prednisone-diphenhydramine hydrochloride pretreatment of 415 essential repeated RCM procedures from 1974 to 1980 resulted in 45 (10.8%) reactions during which transient hypotension occurred in three (0.7%) patients. From 1980 to 1983, prednisone-diphenhydramine-ephedrine sulfate pretreatment of 180 procedures was associated with only nine reactions (5.0%) (chi 2 = 5.195). The addition of cimetidine hydrochloride in 1983 to 1984 was not useful in that 14 reactions occurred during 100 procedures (14.0%). The 21 patients who had been receiving beta-adrenergic antagonist therapy were protected as well as those who were not, in that none of 11 patients receiving the three-drug regimen had a repeated reaction and only one of ten patients receiving the four-drug regimen reacted.", 
    "81": "Coronary hypoperfusion was elicited in alpha-chloralose-anesthetized open-chest dogs by reducing left coronary perfusion pressure to 50 mmHg. Left coronary blood flow, as well as left ventricular oxygen extraction, oxygen consumption, and contractile force were measured. The reduction in perfusion pressure caused significant reductions in coronary flow, oxygen consumption, and peak reactive hyperemic flow. During hypoperfusion in 11 dogs, intracoronary infusion of the specific alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist prazosin (0.1 mg/min) increased coronary flow and oxygen consumption by 22 and 16%, respectively. Peak increases were observed after 6-8 min of prazosin infusion (0.6-0.8 mg prazosin), and both increases were statistically significant (P less than 0.05). In seven additional dogs, beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol (1.0 mg ic) did not significantly affect the actions of prazosin. In five additional dogs, the specific alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist yohimbine (1.3 mg ic) in the presence of propranolol (1.0 mg ic) did not affect coronary flow or oxygen consumption during coronary hypoperfusion. Those results suggest that an alpha 1- but not an alpha 2-adrenergic constrictor tone was operative in the left coronary circulation under the conditions of these experiments.", 
    "82": "Megakaryocyte-platelet regeneration time (MPRT) was determined 6 to 12 months after myocardial infarction in 42 patients below the age of 45 years (mean age +/- SD = 39.4 +/- 4.6, range 23 to 44) and in 11 healthy control subjects by measurement of the reappearance rate of platelet cyclooxygenase activity after oral aspirin. In the young post infarction patients, MPRT was correlated to pertinent metabolic, angiographic, and clinical findings. MPRT for all patients tended to be shorter than in control subjects (t1/2 = 4.53 +/- 1.15 vs 5.22 +/- 0.52; p less than 0.10). Age, present tobacco consumption, serum lipoprotein lipid concentrations, and glucose tolerance, as well as other measured risk factors, did not correlate significantly with MPRT. A marked difference in MPRT, independent of risk factor profile, was present between patients with and without hemodynamically significant stenoses in the coronary angiogram (4.06 +/- 0.92 vs 5.22 +/- 1.07; p less than 0.001). It is suggested that a shortened platelet survival in young post infarction patients is secondary to platelet activation by high-velocity flow and shear forces at the sites of proximal coronary artery stenoses.", 
    "83": "Treatment of hypertension is best accomplished in stepwise fashion, beginning with nondrug therapy followed by a knowledgeable selection of antihypertensive drugs. Consideration must be given to the side effect profile as well as the cost of the medication. Diuretics are still useful, both as first-step drugs and as second-step and third-step drugs to overcome the sodium retention associated with many antihypertensive agents.", 
    "84": "The purpose of this article is to familiarize the clinician with six major categories of cardiovascular medications. Each category includes a description of the agents available, clinical indications for treatment, clinical pharmacology, and side effects. It is expected that the information gained by the therapist will enhance both evaluation and treatment program planning and implementation for individuals with one of the following: a primary diagnosis of cardiovascular disease or a primary diagnosis being treated with physical therapy (such as a neurologic or orthopedic disorder) and a secondary diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. Three case studies are presented to exemplify the importance of a thorough chart review, evaluation, and treatment program implementation and modification, in conjunction with the cardiovascular medications used in each case.", 
    "85": "Long-term clinical trials have been carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of beta-adrenergic blocking agents in modifying the natural history of myocardial infarction (MI). In most of these studies, a lower mortality rate was documented in patients receiving a beta-blocker than in those receiving placebo. The drugs may have both antiarrhythmic and antiischemic effects. In patients without contraindications to beta-blocker treatment, a relative reduction in mortality of 25% can be expected for at least one to two years, with the reduction higher in older patients or patients having complications at infarction. Study results indicate benefit from starting beta-blocker therapy early after infarction, and some benefit from starting late seems a reasonable assumption. Evidence also points to a benefit from prolonged therapy. Beta-blockers are well tolerated in most patients; those major side effects that do occur are often cardiovascular.", 
    "86": "In six patients with hypertriglyceridaemia presenting whilst receiving treatment with beta-adrenoreceptor blocking drugs (mean serum triglycerides 31.2 mmol/l) the half-life (t1/2) of an intravenously administered triglyceride emulsion was 32.8 +/- 7.9 min (mean +/- SEM) on beta-blocker and 22.8 +/- 4.8 min after stopping beta-blocker treatment. In three of these patients subsequent administration of a beta-blocker with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity had no effect on t1/2. In a cross-over trial of placebo, atenolol (beta 1-blocker), propranolol (beta 1- and beta 2-blocker) and pindolol (beta 1- and beta 2-blocker with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity) in 11 normal men t1/2 was 11.8 +/- 0.9, 12.6 +/- 1.1, 14.3 +/- 1.7 and 12.4 +/- 1.1 min respectively. None of the apparent differences achieved statistical significance, but in two men marked increases in t1/2 occurred on propranolol. The concentrations of serum triglycerides and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol in the normal men were, however, increased by beta-blockade, most markedly by pindolol. Serum high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration decreased in normal men on beta-blockers, most clearly on atenolol and propranolol. This decrease was due to a reduction in cholesterol in the HDL2 subfraction. No statistically significant effects on serum low density lipoprotein cholesterol or apolipoprotein B concentrations occurred in the normal men. The doses of atenolol and propranolol used in this study were equipotent as judged by the heart rate response to exercise.", 
    "87": "During the past 15 years coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) has evolved into a procedure with low operative mortality and morbidity resulting in excellent improvement in lifestyle and improved longevity in some instances. Operative risk factors have been identified. Their significance has changed during this time. Currently, clinical congestive heart failure and emergency operation are the most commonly observed adverse results. Since the patients being operated upon, especially those emergent, are sicker, the improvements in mortality and morbidity with CABG are not due to patient selection, but rather to improvement in preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative management. The major areas of management that have been responsible for the current status of CABG are myocardial protection, conduit selection and preservation, blood conservation, anesthetic management, pulmonary arterial catheter monitoring, pharmacologic unloading, intraaortic balloon assistance, cardiac assist devices, and arrhythmia control."
