The current report is an ongoing analysis of an 8-week double-blind randomized controlled multicenter trial in 289 FES, comparing risperidone and haloperidol. Assessments were conducted weekly and included the Hillside Akathisia Scale and 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ratings. Suicidal ideation was significantly associated with clinician observed akathisia, depressed mood, younger age, and use of propranolol. The allocated treatment, anxiety, and nervousness had no influence. The present findings suggest a promoting effect of akathisia on suicidal ideation can not be ruled out in patients with FES.",

    "14": "Sleep is a fundamental behavior exhibited almost universally throughout the animal kingdom. The required amount and circadian timing of sleep differs greatly between species in accordance with habitats and evolutionary history. The Mexican blind cavefish, Astyanax mexicanus, is a model organism for the study of adaptive morphological and behavioral traits. In addition to loss of eyes and pigmentation, cave populations of A. mexicanus exhibit evolutionarily derived sleep loss and increased vibration attraction behavior, presumably to cope with a nutrient-poor environment. Understanding the neural mechanisms of evolutionarily derived sleep loss in this system may reveal critical insights into the regulation of sleep in vertebrates. Here we report that blockade of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors with propranolol rescues the decreased-sleep phenotype of cavefish. This effect was not seen with \u03b1-adrenergic antagonists. Treatment with selective \u03b21-, \u03b22-, and \u03b23-antagonists revealed that the increased sleep observed with propranolol could partially be explained via the \u03b21-adrenergic system. Morphological analysis of catecholamine circuitry revealed conservation of gross catecholaminergic neuroanatomy between surface and cave morphs. Taken together, these findings suggest that evolutionarily derived changes in adrenergic signaling underlie the reduced sleep of cave populations.", 
    "15": "Wastewater samples from the secondary clarifier of two treatment plants were spiked in the microgram-to-tens-of-microgram per liter range with diuron (herbicide), ibuprofen and diclofenac (anti-inflammatory drugs), sulfamethoxazole and erythromycin (antibiotics), bezafibrate and gemfibrozil (lipid regulators), atenolol (\u03b2-blocker), carbamazepine (anti-epileptic), hydrochlorothiazide (diuretic), caffeine (stimulant) and N-acetyl-4-amino-antipiryne, a metabolite of the antipyretic drug dypirone. They were subsequently ozonated in continuous flow using 1.2L lab-scale bubble columns. The concentration of all spiking compounds was monitored in the outlet stream. The effects of varying ozone input, expressed as energy per unit volume, and water flow rate, and of using single or double column were studied in relation to the efficiency of ozone usage and the ratio of pollutant depletion. The ozone dosage required to treat both wastewaters with pollutant depletion of >90% was in the 5.5-8.5 mg/L range with ozone efficiencies greater than 80% depending on the type of wastewater and the operating conditions. This represented 100-200 mol of ozone transferred per mole of pollutant removed. Direct and indirect environmental impacts of ozonation were assessed according to Life Cycle Assessment, a technique that helped identify the most effective treatments in terms of potential toxicity reduction, as well as of toxicity reduction per unit mass of greenhouse-gas emissions, which were used as an indicator of environmental efficiency. A trade-off between environmental effectiveness (toxicity reduction) and greenhouse-gas emissions was observed since maximizing toxicity removal led to higher greenhouse-gas emissions, due to the latter's relatively high ozone requirements. Also, there is an environmental trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency. Our results indicate that an efficient use of ozone was not compatible with a full pollutant removal.", 
    "16": "Cardiovascular risk of increased heart rate (HR) was first reported in the Framingham study. Thereafter, the risk of increased HR for mortality has been extensively studied, suggesting the higher risk in clinical outcomes with increased HR in the general population and in patients with coronary artery disease or heart failure (HF). In a long-term follow-up study in Framingham, the general population in this cohort showed an increase in all-cause mortality by 14% at every 10 bpm increase in HR. In patients with heart failure, resting HR of more than 80 bpm could cause myocardial dysfunction which further deteriorates HF. Downregulation of \u03b2-adrenoreptor receptors with suppressed signal transductions, impaired intracellular Ca homeostasis, and excitation-contraction coupling may play a role in myocardial dysfunction. These subcellular alterations are mimicked in the pacing-induced HF in large animals; however, exact mechanisms of cardiac deterioration by increased HR are not fully understood. \u03b2-Blocker treatment is the most effective therapy for long-term survival of patients with chronic HF. Meta-analysis of HR reduction and improvement in survival in patients with chronic HF indicates that HR reduction is more important than the titrated dose of \u03b2-blockers, although the relative importance of HR reduction in improvement of prognosis is not clear. A recent study in which ivabradine decreased the hospitalization from HR deterioration in patients with chronic HF, demonstrated that further HR reduction with optimal treatment for HF is beneficial for clinical outcomes of the patients. These findings strongly suggest that HR reduction should be a pivotal target of the treatment in patients with HF.",

We prospectively included 96 consecutive patients then excluded 5 patients with arrhythmia. Coronary CT-angiography was performed using a dual-source 128-slice CT machine, at the diastolic phase in the 55 patients with heart rates <70 bpm (group D) and at the systolic phase in the 36 patients with heart rates \u226570 (group S). Image quality was scored on a 5 point-scale (1, not interpretable; 2, insufficient for diagnosis; 3, fair, sufficient for diagnosis; 4, good; 5, excellent). In addition, we compared the number of stair-step artifacts in the two groups. Mean image quality score was 4 (0.78) in group D and 4.1 (0.34) in group S (NS), with an unequal distribution (p = 0.01). Step artifacts were seen in 44 % of group D and 18 % of group S patients (p = 0.02). In 3 group D patients and no group S patients, the image score was <3 due to artifacts, requiring repeat CT-angiography. When performing dual-source 128-slice CT-angiography, step-and-shoot acquisition provides comparable mean image quality in systole, with less variability and fewer stair-step artifacts, compared to diastole. This method may be feasible at any heart rate in most patients in sinus rhythm, allowing low-dose prospective acquisition without beta-blocker premedication.",

This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of this drug for cases of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with left ventricular dysfunction. Between September 2006 and August 2009, 32 patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction of <40% underwent CABG. Two groups of patients, a group administered landiolol hydrochloride and a control group not administered this drug, were compared. The administration of landiolol hydrochloride was initiated at 1 \u03bcg/kg per minute (\u03b3) after cardiopulmonary bypass in on-pump cases and after completion of all the distal anastomoses in off-pump cases. We observed no significant differences between the groups with respect to preoperative patient background or incidences of complications, except for postoperative atrial fibrillation. The heart rate decreased significantly 30 minutes after landiolol hydrochloride administration, but no change was observed in arterial pressure. No change was observed in other parameters; the hemodynamics were stable. The occurrence of atrial fibrillation during the intensive care unit stay (during landiolol hydrochloride administration) was significantly lower in the administration group. The difference remained significant after multiple logistic regression analysis; landiolol hydrochloride was the sole inhibitory factor.", 
    "19": "The typical presentation of heart failure in primary care is insidious, with progressive breathlessness on exertion, ankle swelling, orthopnoea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea. Not all patients will have all these symptoms, and in many patients there may be other causes. If a GP suspects heart failure, then the key blood test is B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). If the BNP is normal then heart failure is unlikely and other diagnoses should be considered. If it is raised, or if there is a past history of myocardial infarction, the patient requires further assessment, which must include echocardiography and a specialist assessment. The underlying cardiac abnormality should be identified. An ECG is often very useful and if it is completely normal it makes heart failure less likely. Both the NICE and the ESC guidance emphasise the importance of lifestyle management (regular appropriate exercise, avoiding excessive salt and alcohol consumption). ACE inhibitors (or angiotensin receptor blockers) and beta-blockers licensed for heart failure (carvedilol, bisoprolol, nebivolol) remain the mainstay of treatment in addition to as small a dose of diuretic as possible to control any fluid retention. Aldosterone antagonism is recommended by the 2012 ESC guidance for all patients who remain symptomatic despite an ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker. If the rhythm is sinus but the heart rate is 75 beats per minute, therapy needs to be optimised, perhaps by increasing the beta-blocker dose, if possible, or by the addition of ivabradine.",

At 3 weeks, hearts were perfused in working mode to obtain baseline function; red blood cell glutathione, plasma 8-isoprostane, neutrophil basal superoxide production, lysosomal-derived plasma N-acetyl-\u03b2-galactosaminidase (NAGA) activity, ventricular iron content, and cardiac iron deposition were assessed. Hearts from the Fe-treated group of rats exhibited lower cardiac work (26%) and output (CO, 24%); end-diastolic pressure rose 1.8-fold. Further, glutathione levels increased 2-fold, isoprostane levels increased 2.5-fold, neutrophil superoxide increased 3-fold, NAGA increased 4-fold, ventricular Fe increased 4.9-fold; and substantial atrial and ventricular Fe-deposition occurred. d-Pro (8 mg) restored heart function to the control levels, protected against oxidative stress, and decreased cardiac Fe levels. After 5 weeks of Fe treatment, echocardiography revealed that the following were depressed: percent fractional shortening (%FS, 31% lower); left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (LVEF, 17%), CO (25%); and aortic pressure maximum (P(max), 24%).

Previous studies suggest that cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction may be involved in the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathy in thalassemia. We tested the hypothesis that iron overload causes dysfunction of cardiac mitochondria isolated from thalassemic mice. Cardiac mitochondria were isolated from the heart tissue of genetically-altered, \u03b2-thalassemic mice (HT) and adult wild-type mice (WT). Ferrous iron (Fe(2+)) at various concentrations (0-5 \u03bcg/ml) was applied to induce iron toxicity. Pharmacological interventions, facilitated by mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) blocker, CsA, and mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter (MCU) blocker, Ru360, were used to study their respective effects on cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction. Cardiac mitochondrial ROS production, mitochondrial membrane potential changes, and mitochondrial swelling were determined. Iron overload caused increased ROS production, mitochondrial depolarization, and mitochondrial swelling in a dose-dependent manner in WT and HT cardiac mitochondria. CsA decreased only ROS production in WT and HT cardiac mitochondria, whereas Ru360 completely prevented the development of cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction by decreasing ROS, mitochondrial depolarization, and swelling in both WT and HT cardiac mitochondria. Ru360, an MCU blocker, provides protective effects by preventing ROS production and mitochondrial depolarization as well as attenuating mitochondrial swelling caused by Fe(2+) overload. These findings indicate that the MCU could be a major portal for Fe(2+) entry into cardiac mitochondria. Therefore, blocking MCU may be an effective therapy to prevent iron-overload induced cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction in patients with thalassemia.",

Further studies revealed that transient receptor potential (TRP) channels did not contribute to the NaHS-induced relaxant effect. Glibenclamide, an ATP-sensitive K channel blocker, did the same thing, whereas BK(Ca) channel blockers iberiotoxin or tetraethylammonium largely reversed the relaxant effect, suggesting that H(2) S may target BK(Ca) channels. We also confirmed that BK(Ca) channels were localized in VD smooth muscle cells. Then, studies revealed that NaHS-induced VD smooth muscle relaxation was abolished by N-ethylmaleimide, which was widely used as a sulfhydryl alkylation compound protecting thiols from oxidation, whereas DL-Dithiothreitol, a strong reducing agent, did not affect the response of VD to NaHS.",

    "51": "Zinc-\u03b12-glycoprotein (ZAG) is an adipokine with the potential as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes. In this study we show that human ZAG, which is a 41-kDa protein, when administered to ob/ob mice at 50 \u03bcg/d(-1) orally in the drinking water produced a progressive loss of body weight (5 g after 8 d treatment), together with a 0.5 C increase in rectal temperature and a 40% reduction in urinary excretion of glucose. There was also a 33% reduction in the area under the curve during an oral glucose tolerance test and an increased sensitivity to insulin. These results were similar to those after iv administration of ZAG. However, tryptic digestion was shown to inactivate ZAG. There was no evidence of human ZAG in the serum but a 2-fold elevation of murine ZAG, which was also observed in target tissues such as white adipose tissue. To determine whether the effect was due to interaction of the human ZAG with the \u03b2-adrenergic (\u03b2-AR) in the gastrointestinal tract before digestion, ZAG was coadministered to ob/ob mice together with propanolol (40 mg/kg(-1)), a nonspecific \u03b2-AR antagonist. The effect of ZAG on body weight, rectal temperature, urinary glucose excretion, improvement in glucose disposal, and increased insulin sensitivity were attenuated by propanolol, as was the increase in murine ZAG in the serum. These results suggest that oral administration of ZAG increases serum levels through interaction with a \u03b2-AR in the upper gastrointestinal tract, and gene expression studies showed this to be in the esophagus.",

We investigated the effects of CM on oxidative stress and Ca\u00b2\u207a concentrations in serum and neutrophils of humans. Ten migraine patients were used in the study. Serum and neutrophil samples from patients' peripheral blood were obtained before (control) and 30 min after non-ionic (iopromide) CM injection. The neutrophils were incubated with non specific transient receptor potential 2 (TRPM2) channel blocker, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), and voltage gated Ca\u00b2\u207a channel blockers, verapamil plus diltiazem. Serum and neutrophil lipid peroxidation, apoptosis and intracellular Ca\u00b2\u207a concentrations levels were higher in the CM group than in controls. The neutrophilic reduced glutathione (GSH) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) levels as well as serum vitamin E and \u03b2-carotene concentrations were lower in the CM group than in controls. Neutrophil lipid peroxidation levels were lower in the CM+2-APB and CM+verapamil-diltiazem groups than in the CM group, although GSH, GSH-Px and intracellular Ca\u00b2\u207a values increased in the CM+2-APB and CM+verapamil-diltiazem groups. However, caspase-3, caspase-9, vitamin A and vitamin C values were unaltered by CM treatment. In conclusion, we observed that CM induced oxidative stress and Ca\u00b2\u207a influx by decreasing vitamin E, \u03b2-carotene and Ca\u00b2\u207a release levels in human serum and neutrophils. However, we observed protective effects of Ca\u00b2\u207a channel blockers on Ca\u00b2\u207a influx in neutrophils.",

Riboflavin sodium phosphate (RSP) and propranolol hydrochloride (PH) were used as water-soluble model drugs. Three different paper substrates: A (uncoated woodfree paper), B (triple-coated inkjet paper) and C (double-coated sheet fed offset paper) were used as porous model carriers for drug delivery. Active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) containing solutions were printed onto 1 cm \u00d7 1 cm substrate areas using an inkjet printer. The printed APIs were coated with water insoluble polymeric films of different thickness using flexographic printing. All substrates were characterized with respect to wettability, surface roughness, air permeability, and cell toxicity. In addition, content uniformity and release profiles of the produced solid dosage forms before and after coating were studied. The substrates were nontoxic for the human cell line assayed. Substrate B was smoothest and least porous. The properties of substrates B and C were similar, whereas those of substrate A differed significantly from those of B, C. The release kinetics of both printed APIs was slowest from substrate B before and after coating with the water insoluble polymer film, following by substrate C, whereas substrate A showed the fastest release. The release rate decreased with increasing polymer coating film thickness. The printed solid dosage forms showed excellent content uniformity. So, combining the two printing technologies allowed fabricating controlled-release oral dosage forms that are challenging to produce using a single technique. The approach opens up new perspectives in the manufacture of flexible doses and tailored drug-delivery systems.",

Furthermore, NF2-associated VS showed significantly lower angiogenic potential than sporadic VS (p <0.05). Imatinib treatment significantly reduced the angiogenic potential in both the sporadic VS and the NF2-associated VS groups. The level of PDGF-A and PDGFR-\u03b1 as well as PDGF-B and PDGFR-\u03b2 expression in sporadic VS and NF2-associated VS also differed significantly (p <0.05) from the levels in controls. Additionally the level of PDGFR-\u03b2 was significantly higher in sporadic VS than in NF2-associated VS (p <0.05).",

Such interaction is thought to occur at least partly in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) which is crucially involved in emotional memory formation. Extensive evidence points to long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) as a mechanism contributing to memory formation. Here we determined in adolescent C57/Bl6 mice the effects of stress on LTP in the LA-BLA pathway and the specific roles of corticosteroid and \u03b2-adrenergic receptor activation in this process.",

The role of glucocorticoid receptors, mineralocorticoid receptors and \u03b22-adrenoceptors in the effects of stress was studied by treating mice with the antagonists mifepristone, spironolactone or propranolol respectively (or the corresponding vehicles) prior to stress or control treatment. In undisturbed controls, mifepristone and propranolol administration in vivo did not influence LTP induced in vitro. By contrast, spironolactone caused a gradually attenuating form of LTP, both in unstressed and stressed mice. Mifepristone treatment prior to stress strongly reduced the ability to induce LTP in vitro. Propranolol normalized the stress-induced enhancement of LTP to control levels during the first 10 min after high frequency stimulation, after which synaptic responses further declined.", 
    "60": "Acute stress changes BLA electrical properties such that subsequent LTP induction is facilitated. Both \u03b2-adrenergic and glucocorticoid receptors are involved in the development of these changes. Mineralocorticoid receptors are important for the maintenance of LTP in the BLA, irrespective of stress-induced changes in the circuit. The prolonged changes in BLA network function after stress may contribute to effective memory formation of emotional and stressful events.",

The viability of Jurkat cells was determined by MTT test. It was shown that \u03b2-adlenoretseptors agonist, izoprotenol didn't affect the activity of mitochondrial dehydrogenases in intact and contributed to their low activation (12%) in the mitogen-activated Jurkat cells. \u03b2-adrenergic receptors antagonist, propranolol, promotes a significant reduction in activity of mitochondrial dehydrogenases, and hence the viability of both intact (40-60%) and mitogen stimulated Jurkat cells (20-40%). Viability of intact Jurkat cells didn't change, and dose-dependently increased in PHA-stimulated Jurkat cells during progesterone exposure. It was concluded that viability of the T-cells and hence their functional activity is largely sensitive to the influence of the \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonists and progesterone. These data should be considered in the clinical application of appropriate drugs.",

While basal levels of AP-1 activity are important for normal cell proliferation and cell survival, overactivated AP-1-dependent gene expression stimulates inflammation, angiogenesis, invasion, and other events that propel carcinogenesis. We seek to discover genes targeted by carcinogenesis inhibitors that do not also inhibit cell proliferation or survival. Transgenic TAM67 (dominant-negative c-Jun) inhibits mouse skin tumorigenesis and tumor progression without inhibiting cell proliferation or induced hyperproliferation. Expression profiling of wild-type and K14-TAM67 mouse epidermis has revealed a number of functionally significant genes that are induced by tumor promoters in wild-type mice but not in those expressing the AP-1 blocker. The current study now identifies Wnt5a signaling as a new target of TAM67 when it inhibits DMBA/TPA-induced carcinogenesis. Wnt5a is required to maintain the tumor phenotype in tumorigenic mouse JB6 cells and Ras-transformed human squamous carcinoma HaCaT-II4 cells, as Wnt5a knockdown suppresses anchorage-independent and tumor xenograft growth. The oncogenic Wnt5a-mediated pathway signals through activation of the protein kinase PKC\u03b1 and oncogenic transcription factor STAT3 phosphorylation and not through the canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway. Similar to Wnt5a knockdown, inhibitors of PKC\u03b1 blocked STAT3 activation in both mouse JB6 and human HaCaT-II4 tumor cells. Moreover, expression of STAT3-regulated genes FAS, MMP3, IRF1, and cyclin D1 was suppressed with Wnt5a knockdown. Treatment of mouse Wnt5a knockdown cells with a PKC\u03b1-specific activator rescued phosphorylation of STAT3. Thus, Wnt5a signaling is required for maintaining the tumor phenotype in squamous carcinoma cells, Wnt5a targeting by the AP-1 blockade contributes to inhibition of skin carcinogenesis, and the signaling pathway traverses PKC\u03b1 and STAT3 activation. Coordinate overactivation of Wnt5a expression and STAT3 signaling is observed in human skin and colon cancers as well as glioblastoma.",

In the present study, we evaluated the effect of celiprolol on the release of hypoxanthine, a uric acid precursor, from muscles after an exercise. We used the semi-ischemic forearm test to examine the release of lactate (\u0394LAC), ammonia (\u0394Amm), and hypoxanthine (\u0394HX) before and 4, 10, and 60 min after an exercise in 18 hypertensive patients as well as 4 normotensive subjects. Before celiprolol treatment, all the levels of \u0394HX and \u0394Amm, and \u0394LAC were increased by semi-ischemic exercise in hypertensive patients, and the increases were remarkably larger than those in normotensive subjects. Celiprolol decreased both systolic and diastolic pressure. It also decreased the levels of \u0394HX and \u0394Amm without changes in \u0394LAC after an exercise. These findings also were confirmed by summation of each metabolite (\u03a3\u0394Metabolites). Celiprolol caused a marginal decrease of serum uric acid, but the difference was not statistically significant. On the other hand, nonvasodilating \u03b21 blockers did not suppress the levels of \u0394HX and \u0394Amm, whereas they significantly increased \u0394LAC after an exercise. Celiprolol improved energy metabolism in skeletal muscles. It suppressed HX production and consequently did not adversely affect serum uric acid levels.",

Especially patients with elevated ASA-scores frequently suffer from multiple co-morbidities which often need numerous medications. The probability of pharmacological interactions rises with the number of these medications. Moreover it must be taken into consideration that chronic medication potentially interferes with both intravenous and inhaled anesthetics and moreover, bleeding complications are more likely to occur in patients undergoing chronic pharmacotherapy. The aim of this article is to provide a summary of the existing evidence concerning perioperative medication in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery. Several guidelines and advisories dealing with cardiovascular medication have been published during the last decade. The main scope of these publications was on beta-blockers and other cardiovascular medication. There is less evidence on not-cardiovascular medication as in most cases only case reports and expert opinions are published. Existing epidemiologic studies on this topic are rather heterogeneous.",

    "126": "G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) have long been known as receptors that activate G protein-dependent cellular signaling pathways. In addition to the G protein-dependent pathways, recent reports have revealed that several ligands called \"biased ligands\" elicit G protein-independent and \u03b2-arrestin-dependent signaling through GPCRs (biased agonism). Several \u03b2-blockers are known as biased ligands. All \u03b2-blockers inhibit the binding of agonists to the \u03b2-adrenergic receptors. In addition to \u03b2-blocking action, some \u03b2-blockers are reported to induce cellular responses through G protein-independent and \u03b2-arrestin-dependent signaling pathways. However, the physiological significance induced by the \u03b2-arrestin-dependent pathway remains much to be clarified in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that metoprolol, a \u03b2(1)-adrenergic receptor-selective blocker, could induce cardiac fibrosis through a G protein-independent and \u03b2-arrestin2-dependent pathway. Metoprolol, a \u03b2-blocker, increased the expression of fibrotic genes responsible for cardiac fibrosis in cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, metoprolol induced the interaction between \u03b2(1)-adrenergic receptor and \u03b2-arrestin2, but not \u03b2-arrestin1. The interaction between \u03b2(1)-adrenergic receptor and \u03b2-arrestin2 by metoprolol was impaired in the G protein-coupled receptor kinase 5 (GRK5)-knockdown cells. Metoprolol-induced cardiac fibrosis led to cardiac dysfunction. However, the metoprolol-induced fibrosis and cardiac dysfunction were not evoked in \u03b2-arrestin2- or GRK5-knock-out mice. Thus, metoprolol is a biased ligand that selectively activates a G protein-independent and GRK5/\u03b2-arrestin2-dependent pathway, and induces cardiac fibrosis. This study demonstrates the physiological importance of biased agonism, and suggests that G protein-independent and \u03b2-arrestin-dependent signaling is a reason for the diversity of the effectiveness of \u03b2-blockers.",

In the method, a suitable mixture of extraction solvent (60 \u03bcL carbon tetrachloride) and dispersive solvent (1 mL acetonitrile) were injected into the aqueous samples (5.00 mL) and the cloudy solution was observed. After centrifugation, the enriched analytes in the bottom CCl(4) phase were determined by liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection.

Increasing evidence suggests that selective engagement of \u03b2-arrestin-mediated AT1R signaling, referred to as biased signaling, promotes cardioprotective signaling. Here, we tested the hypothesis that a \u03b2-arrestin-biased AT1R ligand TRV120023 would confer cardioprotection in response to acute cardiac injury compared with the traditional AT1R blocker (ARB), losartan. TRV120023 promotes cardiac contractility, assessed by pressure-volume loop analyses, while blocking the effects of endogenous ANG II. Compared with losartan, TRV120023 significantly activates MAPK and Akt signaling pathways. These hemodynamic and biochemical effects were lost in \u03b2-arrestin-2 knockout (KO) mice. In response to cardiac injury induced by ischemia reperfusion injury or mechanical stretch, pretreatment with TRV120023 significantly diminishes cell death compared with losartan, which did not appear to be cardioprotective. This cytoprotective effect was lost in \u03b2-arrestin-2 KO mice. The \u03b2-arrestin-biased AT1R ligand, TRV120023, has cardioprotective and functional properties in vivo, which are distinct from losartan. Our data suggest that this novel class of drugs may provide an advantage over conventional ARBs by supporting cardiac function and reducing cellular injury during acute cardiac injury.",

A systematic literature review was performed to identify all the studies conducted on patients with ET published until September 2010. Articles were classified according to GRADE evidence profile, a system for grading the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendation based on the quality of the studies. The quality of evidence was often rated as \"low\" or \"very low\" for the studies analyzed.

No effect of atenolol concentration on its retardation was observed within a wide concentration range. The breakthrough curve comparison of atenolol and the more hydrophobic metoprolol under constant conditions showed a significantly stronger retardation for metoprolol than for atenolol. However, additional non-polar interactions cannot explain the observed differences as they are determined to be negligible for both compounds.

The effects of fraud in perioperative medicine are particularly caustic owing to a profound domino effect. Many investigators devoted their academic careers to following the footsteps of investigators such as Poldermans. Similarly, funding agencies supported this line of enquiry, incurring significant cost and expense. Most importantly, hundreds of patients were exposed to treatments that may have been harmful in an effort to advance this research agenda. How should perioperative clinicians utilize beta blockade now that a considerable portion of the literature is enshrouded in uncertainty? In this brief review, we reiterate and emphasize basic principles about the indications and administration of perioperative beta blockade.

    "142": "A novel investigational antidepressant with high affinity for the serotonin transporter and the serotonin 1A (5-HT(1A)) receptor, called Wf-516 (structural formula: (2S)-1-[4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)piperidin-1-yl]-3-[2-(5-methyl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)benzo[b]furan-4-yloxy]propan-2-ol monohydrochloride), has been found to exert a rapid therapeutic effect, although the mechanistic basis for this potential advantage remains undetermined. We comparatively investigated the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Wf-516 and pindolol by positron emission tomographic (PET) and autoradiographic assays of rat brains in order to elucidate their molecular interactions with presynaptic and postsynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptors. In contrast to the full receptor occupancy by pindolol in PET measurements, the binding of Wf-516 to 5-HT(1A) receptors displayed limited capacity, with relatively high receptor occupancy being achieved in regions predominantly containing presynaptic receptors. This selectivity was further proven by PET scans of neurotoxicant-treated rats deficient in presynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptors. In addition, [(35)S]guanosine 5'-O-[\u03b3-thio]triphosphate autoradiography indicated a partial agonistic ability of Wf-516 for 5-HT(1A) receptors. This finding has lent support to reports that diverse partial agonists for 5-HT(1A) receptors exert high sensitivity for presynaptic components. Thus, the present PET data suggest a relatively high capacity of presynaptic binding sites for partial agonists. Since our in vitro and ex vivo autoradiographies failed to illustrate these distinct features of Wf-516, in vivo PET imaging is considered to be, thus far, the sole method capable of pharmacokinetically demonstrating the unique actions of Wf-516 and similar new-generation antidepressants.",

Later, serum and urinary markers for pheochromocytoma were within normal limits. The histopathology report came out to be pheochromocytoma of the bladder. Later, partial cystectomy was carried out under general anaesthesia and histopathology confirmed the same.

However, these same chemotherapeutic or radiologic treatments may result in long-term health consequences. Anthracyclines, chemotherapeutic drugs commonly used to treat children with cancer, are known to be cardiotoxic, but the mechanism by which they induce cardiac damage is still not fully understood. A higher cumulative anthracycline dose and a younger age of diagnosis are only a few of the many risk factors that identify the children at increased risk of developing cardiotoxicity. While cardiotoxicity can develop at anytime, starting from treatment initiation and well into adulthood, identifying the best cardioprotective measures to minimize the long-term damage caused by anthracyclines in children is imperative. Dexrazoxane is the only known agent to date, that is associated with less cardiac dysfunction, without reducing the oncologic efficacy of the anthracycline doxorubicin in children.

Midazolam, a CYP3A substrate drug, or talinolol, a P-gp substrate drug, was orally administered to rats with each of these Kampo extract medicines. Senkyu-cha-chosan or Sokei-kakketsu-to administered as a standard regimen did not obviously affect Cmax and area under the curve (AUC) of midazolam, although both Kampo extract medicines contained notopterol, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor in vitro. The results implied a lack of potent drug-drug interactions between both Kampo extract medicines and CYP3A substrate drugs. Concomitant administration of each Kampo extract medicine unexpectedly showed the tendency to decrease Cmax and AUC of talinolol. Decreased intestinal absorption of talinolol might be caused, not by the inhibition of P-gp, but by the inhibition of organic anion transporting peptides by both Kampo extract medicines.",

Despite these well established concepts, however, hypertension remains poorly controlled, worldwide. In addition, treated hypertensive patients often remain at higher risk compared with the normotensive population, even when a satisfactory blood pressure control is achieved, due to the high or very high added cardiovascular risk profile observed in these patients. An emerging strategy to improve blood pressure control and achieve this unmet target for cardiovascular disease prevention in hypertensive patients is represented by a more extensive use of rational and effective combination therapies with respect to monotherapy. Such an approach has been recently proposed even as first-line strategy in hypertensive patients at high added cardiovascular risk or in those in whom strict blood pressure control is required. Within the possible antihypertensive drug combinations currently available for the clinical management of hypertension, those based on the association of drugs inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system and thiazide diuretics or calcium channel blockers have demonstrated to be effective and safe in lowering both systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels with a good tolerability profile. In addition, these strategies have provided evidence for effective cardiovascular protection compared with conventional antihypertensive therapies. Among the antihypertensive drugs able to counteract the deleterious effects of abnormal activation of the renin-angiotensin system, angiotensin II receptor blockers have demonstrated to provide better tolerability profile and greater cardiovascular protection on hypertension-related organ damage compared with ACE inhibitors in randomized controlled clinical trials, in the presence of similar antihypertensive efficacy and safety. In particular, these drugs are characterized by lower rates of drug-related side effects, better compliance and adherence to prescribed antihypertensive regimens, and use in synergistic and rational combination therapies, all factors that may contribute to improve blood pressure control and reduce discontinuations from antihypertensive therapy in treated hypertensive patients.", 
    "201": "The goal of antihypertensive therapy is to reduce the risk associated with blood pressure elevation. Although the choice of first-line drug therapy may exert some effects on different long-term cardiovascular endpoints, randomized clinical trials and meta-analyses demonstrated that blood pressure reduction per se is the primary determinant in primary and secondary prevention. Numerous analyses carried out over the last years have repeatedly shown that many patients require the combination of two or more drugs to reach the recommended level of blood pressure control. Within this context, combination therapy with separate agents or fixed-dose combination pills offers an attractive ability to lower blood pressure more quickly, decrease adverse effects and reach blood pressure target. It is not clear whether fixed combinations of antihypertensive agents in a single tablet provide a greater benefit than the corresponding components given separately. In other words, it is not clear if the use of fixed combinations translates into a clearly improved blood pressure control and cardiovascular prevention in clinical practice. Fixed-dose combinations may simplify the treatment regimen by reducing the number of pills and may be attractive for many hypertensive patients. However, single-pill (fixed) drug combinations have some disadvantages: (i) branded fixed combinations may be more expensive than equivalent free combinations; (ii) the duration of action of individual components may not be equivalent, and this may not justify a single daily dosing of the combination; and (iii) the use of fixed combinations implies less flexibility in modifying the doses of individual components and the exposure of patients to unnecessary therapy. Moreover, should a patient develop side effects to one component, the entire combination should be discontinued and replaced by free drugs. The following three types of fixed-dose tablets have been recently proposed to give additional flexibility: (i) tablet manufactured so that each of the two drugs is placed at opposite ends of the tablet with a drug-free (inactive) layer placed in between; (ii) tablet with the combination of drugs at each end with the inactive zone in between; and (iii) tablet divided into discrete, separate segments (the two drugs are combined uniformly), which provides benefits for initial close titration and dosage adjustments. Currently, none of the fixed-dose tablets available on the market have these characteristics and, consequently, are unable to be broken to allow sufficient flexibility.",

    "203": "A total of 74 patients with LUTS were enrolled. International Prostate Symptom Score, uroflowmetry with post-void residual urine volume, and transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) were investigated. BWT was measured by performing TRUS at the midsagittal plane view, and the average value of BWT at the anterior, dome, and trigone areas was used. After 4 weeks of alpha-blocker medication, patients were reevaluated and divided into two groups. The responder group consisted of patients who reported improvement in the storage symptom subscore of 2 points or more; the non-responder group consisted of patients who reported improvement of less than 2 points. Clinical parameters including BWT were compared between the two groups.", 
    "204": "A total of 52 patients were followed. BWT was positively correlated with intravesical prostate protrusion (IPP) (9.26\u00b14.99, standardized beta=0.393, p=0.002) and storage symptom subscore (0.35\u00b10.43, standardized beta=0.458, p=0.002). Compared with that in the responder group, BWT was thicker in the non-responder group, and improvement in the storage symptom score was correlated with BWT (0.58\u00b10.09 cm vs. 0.65\u00b10.11 cm, p=0.018) and prostate volume (27.08\u00b116.26 ml vs. 36.44\u00b110.1 ml, p=0.018).", 
    "205": "BWT was correlated with IPP, the storage symptom subscore, and the responsiveness of storage symptoms to alpha-blockers in LUTS/benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) patients. As BWT increased, the responsiveness of storage symptoms to alpha-blocker decreased in LUTS/BPH patients.", 
    "206": "Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), especially hyaluronic acid (HA), regulate tissue flexibility, cell motility, and inflammation. Airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) of patients with asthma exhibit abnormal HA metabolism, which contributes to inflammation and remodeling. Here, we investigated the effects of glucocorticoids and long-acting \u03b2(2)-agonists (LABAs) on GAG synthesis and HA metabolism by human primary ASMCs. ASMCs were isolated from airway specimens of 10 patients without asthma and 11 patients with asthma. ASMCs were incubated with glucocorticoids, LABAs, or their combination, as well as with their specific receptor antagonists. Secreted and deposited total GAGs were measured by [(3)H]-glucosamine incorporation. The expression of specific GAGs was determined by ELISA and electrophoresis. The expression of HA synthases (HAS), of hyaluronidases (HYALs), and of the HA receptor CD44 was determined by RT-PCR, immunoblotting in cell cultures, and immunohistochemistry in tissue sections of asthmatic lungs. In serum-activated asthmatic ASMCs, glucocorticoids and LABAs significantly inhibited the increased secretion and deposition of total GAGs, but they stimulated secreted and deposited HA of high molecular mass. This effect was attributed to increased mRNA and protein expression of HAS-1 and to the reduced expression of HYAL-1. Furthermore, drug treatment stimulated the expression of CD44 receptors in asthmatic ASMCs. These effects of the drugs were eliminated by their respective receptor inhibitors. Our findings indicate that the combination of glucocorticoids with LABAs counteracts the pathologic degradation of HA, and thereby may reduce the proinflammatory potential of asthmatic ASMCs.",

Twelve (52%) of these subjects had documented airway hemangiomas, six of whom were diagnosed and treated at our institution. All six subjects underwent direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy by a pediatric otolaryngologist. Five (83%) subjects had subglottic hemangioma. Three subjects (50%) had additional hemangioma within the airway located on the epiglottis, vocal folds, posterior pharyngeal wall, and tracheal wall. Five subjects (83%) were treated with propranolol, five (83%) were treated with systemic steroids, and one subject received vincristine. One subject required laser ablation of subglottic hemangioma and tracheotomy. All subjects were airway symptom free at last follow-up (average, 35 months; range, 13-76 months).",

Early detection of airway involvement is paramount. Given the high rates of airway hemangiomas, we recommend performing direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy in all PHACE patients with respiratory symptoms. We recommend having a low threshold for airway evaluation in asymptomatic PHACE patients, especially those who will not be otherwise started on propranolol.",

    "213": "RA is often performed as part of percutaneous coronary interventions for the treatment of calcified lesions; however, the procedure can be complicated by slow flow. Previous reports suggested that the use of beta-blockers was associated with slow flow during RA.",

Although guidelines exist for the treatment of the patient with elevated blood pressure, there remains a paucity of literature and accepted guidelines for the perioperative evaluation and care of the patient with hypertension who undergoes either cardiac or noncardiac surgery. Of particular importance is defining the patients most vulnerable to complications and the indications for immediate and rapid antihypertensive treatment and/or cancellation of surgery to reduce these risks in each of the three perioperative settings: preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative. This review also examines the parenteral antihypertensive medications most commonly administered in the perioperative setting.", 
    "218": "Although landiolol is useful in the emergency management of atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and tachycardia, as well as in perioperative arrhythmia control, the influence of hemodynamic changes on the pharmacokinetics of landiolol is unknown. We investigated the influence of hemodynamic variation and the following hepatocirculatory changes after systemic heparinization on the pharmacokinetics of landiolol in patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass. Cardiac output and cardiac index (CI) were continuously monitored in 19 patients using an arterial pressure-based cardiac output monitor. The middle and right hepatic venous blood flow indexes (mHVBFI and rHVBFI) were measured by transesophageal echocardiography, and hemodynamic data were collected at points (T1-T3) as follows: T1, before administration of heparin and after sternotomy; T2, just before systemic heparinization (300 U/kg); T3, 10 min after T2. The plasma concentration of landiolol was measured by HPLC at the same point. After administration of heparin, mean arterial blood pressure, CI, mHVBFI, and rHVBFI were significantly decreased (<0.05). Heart rate was not significantly changed. After systemic heparinization, the landiolol concentration was significantly decreased from 0.407\u00b10.251 \u00b5g\u00b7mL(-1) to 0.232\u00b10.207\u2009\u00b5g\u00b7mL(-1) (<0.01). There was no significant difference between T1 and T2 (=0.88). In conclusion, the plasma concentration of landiolol was decreased by diminished CI due to systemic heparinization, but not affected by the change of hepatic blood flow.",

    "220": "We hypothesized that age-related differences of \u03b2-blocker effect may be due in part to differences in the relative magnitudes of Epi and NE release during an evolving faint, specifically, greater Epi/NE ratio in younger fainters compared to older patients.

    "225": "Increased beat-to-beat variability in the QT interval (QTV) of ECG has been associated with increased risk for sudden cardiac death, but its measurement is technically challenging and currently not standardized. The aim of this study was to investigate the performance of commonly used beat-to-beat QT interval measurement algorithms. Three different methods (conventional, template stretching and template time shifting) were subjected to simulated data featuring typical ECG recording issues (broadband noise, baseline wander, amplitude modulation) and real short-term ECG of patients before and after infusion of sotalol, a QT interval prolonging drug. Among the three algorithms, the conventional algorithm was most susceptible to noise whereas the template time shifting algorithm showed superior overall performance on simulated and real ECG. None of the algorithms was able to detect increased beat-to-beat QT interval variability after sotalol infusion despite marked prolongation of the average QT interval. The QTV estimates of all three algorithms were inversely correlated with the amplitude of the T wave. In conclusion, template matching algorithms, in particular the time shifting algorithm, are recommended for beat-to-beat variability measurement of QT interval in body surface ECG. Recording noise, T wave amplitude and the beat-rejection strategy are important factors of QTV measurement and require further investigation."
