    "1": "Thirty-two patients with newly diagnosed POAG were included in the study. The patients were randomized into two groups. The first group was treated with betaxolol 0.50% twice daily and the second group with latanoprost 0.005% once daily. Baseline and posttreatment examinations on the first and third months of treatment included intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement, automated visual field testing, and ocular blood flow assessment. For evaluation of visual fields, mean defect and pattern standard deviation indices were used. Ocular blood flow was assessed by means of color Doppler imaging of the central retinal artery (CRA) and the temporal short posterior ciliary artery (PCA). For each vessel, peak systolic (PSV) and end-diastolic (EDV) blood flow velocities were measured and resistivity index (RI) calculated.", 
    "2": "After exclusion of one noncompliant patient, the study was completed with 31 eyes of 31 patients. Both drugs significantly reduced IOP (p<0.05). The mean IOP lowering effect of latanoprost was significantly higher than that of betaxolol (p=0.03). Visual field indices exhibited no significant changes in either group (p>0.05). There were no significant changes in PSV or EDV measurements of CRA or PCA in either group (p>0.05). RI decreased in both CRA and PCA with both drugs. The mean changes between baseline and 3 month blood flow measurements were not significantly different between betaxolol and latanoprost (p>0.05).", 
    "3": "Over a treatment period of 3 months, both betaxolol and latanoprost tended to improve ocular blood flow without one of them being superior to the other. The results suggest that the direct (non IOP-dependent) influence on ocular circulation is better for betaxolol than for latanoprost. In addition, neither drug caused significant generalized improvements in visual fields during this period.", 
    "4": "1. The alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist properties of the beta-adrenoceptor nonconventional partial agonist, CGP 12177A, was investigated in functional assays in rat aorta and in radioligand binding assays in rat cerebral cortical membranes. In addition, binding affinities of other beta-adrenoceptor ligands were measured to investigate any correlation between alpha(1)-adrenoceptor affinity and relaxant potency in phenylephrine-constricted rings. 2. In functional studies, CGP 12177A produced parallel rightward shifts of the phenylephrine CRC with no reduction in the maximum responses. Schild regression analysis gave a straight line with a slope of 0.95 (95% CL: 0.87-1.04), suggesting reversible competitive antagonism, and gave a pK(B) value of 5.26. In contrast, CGP 12177A (<or=300 microm) had no effect on contraction induced by the thromboxane-mimetic, U46619. 3. In binding studies, CGP 12177A competed monophasically with [(3)H]prazosin binding (Hill slope, 0.95, 95% CL: 0.76-1.13), giving a pK(i) value of 5.48, in good agreement with the pK(B) from functional studies. 4. Competition experiments with various other beta-adrenoceptor ligands showed that they all displaced [(3)H]prazosin in a manner consistent with one-site competition. pK(i) values were as follows: SR 59230A, 6.25; cyanopindolol, 6.33; bupranolol, 6.35; alprenolol, 5.90; propranolol, 5.80; BRL 37344, 5.50; ICI 118551, 5.55; CGP 20712A, 5.26. The pK(i) values correlated well with the pEC(50) values for relaxation of phenylephrine-constricted rat aorta obtained previously (r(2)=0.984, P<0.0001). 5. In conclusion, relaxant effects of CGP 12177A and other beta-adrenoceptor ligands in phenylephrine-constricted rat aorta can be attributed to alpha(1)-adrenoceptor blockade and are unrelated to effects at beta(3)-adrenoceptors or atypical beta-adrenoceptors.",

    "6": "In this 6 month, randomised, evaluator masked, parallel group European study, patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension and IOP > or =21 mm Hg on monotherapy or >16 mm Hg on dual therapy received either FC latanoprost/timolol at 8:00AM or UFC brimonidine/timolol at 8:00AM and 8:00PM. The primary outcome was the difference from baseline to month 6 in mean diurnal IOP reduction.", 
    "7": "325 of 334 randomised patients were included in intent to treat analyses (FC latanoprost/timolol, 163; UFC brimonidine/timolol, 162). Baseline diurnal IOP levels were similar: FC latanoprost/timolol, 26.4 (SD 2.7) mm Hg; UFC brimonidine/timolol, 26.5 (SD 2.8) mm Hg (p = 0.851). At month 6, levels were 16.9 (SD 2.8) mm Hg in FC latanoprost/timolol patients and 18.2 (SD 3.1) mm Hg in UFC brimonidine/timolol patients (p<0.001). No adverse events were reported by 76.4% and 75.5% of patients receiving FC latanoprost/timolol versus UFC brimonidine/timolol, respectively. Larger proportions of brimonidine/timolol treated patients reported study medication related adverse events (18.6% v 7.3%) and discontinued study participation because of this (10.8% v 1.8%).",

    "9": "On the basis of in vitro experiments showing that endothelin (ET)-1 interferes with smooth muscle ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channel opening, which is pivotal in beta-adrenergic coronary dilation, we hypothesized that pathophysiological plasma ET-1 levels impair beta-adrenergic dilation of resistance coronary vessels. In conscious instrumented dogs, graded intravenous doses of dobutamine caused the expected inotropic responses. As myocardial O(2) consumption (MVo(2)) increased, the disproportionate rise in coronary sinus (CS) Po(2) indicates that increases in coronary blood flow (CBF) exceeded metabolic requirements, consistent with beta-adrenergic dilation. ET-1 intravenous infusions, to reach pathophysiological plasma levels, reduced slopes of the Po(2)-MVo(2) and CBF-MVo(2) relations. In contrast, the first derivative of left ventricular pressure over time responses to dobutamine were not impaired during ET-1 delivery. Clazosentan, an ET(A) receptor blocker, prevented reduction of the slope of Po(2)-MVo(2) and CBF-MVo(2) relations. After ganglionic blockade to exclude reflex influences, ET-1 still reduced slopes of Po(2)-MVo(2) and CBF-MVo(2) relations. To assess effects of ET-1 on endothelium-dependent and -independent coronary vascular responses, intracoronary ACh and nitroglycerin were given to directly target coronary vessels. CBF responses to ACh and nitroglycerin were maintained during ET-1 delivery. In contrast, responses to intracoronary K(ATP) channel-dependent dilators adenosine and lemakalim were impaired by ET-1. In conclusion, pathophysiological levels of ET-1 impaired beta-adrenergic dilation of resistance coronary vessels through an ET(A) receptor-dependent process. In contrast, left ventricular inotropic responses to dobutamine were not impaired during ET-1 delivery. Our data suggest that ET-1 may interfere with smooth muscle K(ATP) channels to impair beta-adrenergic coronary dilation.", 
    "10": "Tissue levels of nineteen amino acids and total free amino acids, were assayed by gas-liquid chromatography in cytosols of rat atrial and ventricular muscle cardiomyocytes. The tissues were assayed after the rats had been administered IP with the three cardioactive drugs, exerting a significant effect on their heart action: propranolol, pentylenetetrazol and reserpine. It was demonstrated that while in the atrial and ventricular cardiac muscle cytosols of control rats, arginine, glutamine and cysteine were detected in high levels (35.1% and 17.6%; 14.8% and 51.6%; 9.9% and 0.25% of the total free amino acids, respectively), all three drugs significantly reduced the total amounts of cytosolic free amino acids in both atrial and ventricular heart muscles. All three drugs (with reserpine in particular) modified the levels of arginine, cysteine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, isoleucine and tyrosine. The role of these amino acids in the heart muscle cytosol, and their involvement in the mechanism of action of these three cardioactive drugs, is discussed.", 
    "11": "The objective of this study was to assess the in vitro the iontophoretic delivery of Timolol across human dermatomed skin in order to determine whether therapeutic doses of this drug can be delivered. Anodal iontophoresis of Timolol was performed by manipulating the donor vehicle and the current density. It was observed that by reducing simultaneously the competitive ions (NaCl) from 8 to 4 g/l and the pH from 7.4 to 4.7, the iontophoretic flux was significantly increased by a factor of 1.5 (669+/-81 microg/cm h). In order to simulate the situation in a transdermal patch, the iontophoretic delivery of Timolol was also studied after adding an artificial porous membrane placed between the Timolol formulation and the human dermatomed skin. No significant difference was observed in the steady state flux across the skin when an artificial membrane was added. Furthermore, a linear relationship was found between current density and steady state flux. These results indicate that the iontophoretic delivery of Timolol can be accurately controlled by the applied current. Assuming a one to one in vitro/in vivo correlation the Timolol transport in vitro results in therapeutic plasma concentrations in humans with very low current densities limiting possible skin irritation.", 
    "12": "A 55-year-old woman with angina was found to have multiple fistulae from all three major coronary arteries to the left ventricle. The aortography mimicked a severe aortic insufficiency. This rare vascular anomaly can cause a coronary steal phenomenon and subsequent myocardial ischemia in patients without angiographic evidence of major atherosclerotic coronary artery disease.", 
    "13": "The present study reports quick and significant changes induced by plant hormones in the volume of mesophyll protoplasts of pea (Pisum sativum). Four plant hormones: gibberellic acid (GA3), indole 3-acetic acid (IAA), abscisic acid (ABA)(+/-) and methyl jasmonate (MJ), caused marked changes in the volume of mesophyll protoplasts. GA3 and IAA increased the volume of the protoplasts (up to 90%) whereas the ABA and MJ decreased (by about 40%) the volume. Aquaporins or water channels appear to play an important role in swelling/shrinkage of the protoplasts as indicated by the suppression of volume changes by HgCl2 and reversal by mercaptoethanol. The possible role of secondary messengers in volume changes induced by GA3 was investigated by using selected pharmacological reagents. The GA3 induced swelling was restricted by GDP-beta-S (G-protein antagonist), U73122 (phospholipase C inhibitor), and TFP (calmodulin antagonist), but was not affected by 1-butanol (phospholipase D inhibitor), GTP-gamma-S (G-protein agonist), or verapamil (calcium channel blocker). The results suggest that the mesophyll protoplasts can be a simple and useful system for further studies on volume changes in plant tissues.", 
    "14": "Diastolic heart failure, a major cause of morbidity and mortality, is defined as symptoms of heart failure in a patient with preserved left ventricular function. It is characterized by a stiff left ventricle with decreased compliance and impaired relaxation, which leads to increased end diastolic pressure. Signs and symptoms are similar to those of heart failure with systolic dysfunction. The diagnosis of diastolic heart failure is best made with Doppler echocardiography. Based on current knowledge, pharmacologic treatment of diastolic heart failure should focus on normalizing blood pressure, promoting regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, avoiding tachycardia, treating symptoms of congestion, and maintaining normal atrial contraction when possible. Diuretic therapy is the mainstay of treatment for preventing pulmonary congestion, while beta blockers appear to be useful in preventing tachycardia and thereby prolonging left ventricular diastolic filling time. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers may be beneficial in patients with diastolic dysfunction, especially those with hypertension. Evidence from adequately powered randomized controlled trials, however, is not available yet. The outcomes of ongoing clinical trials may provide much-needed information to move from intuitive treatment to therapy based on evidence that matters: decreased morbidity and mortality and improved quality of life.", 
    "15": "PURPOSE OF VIEW: A major clinical trial and a meta-analysis completed within the past year addressed the issue of renal disease progression after blood pressure-lowering treatment in patients with hypertension and diminished renal function. Important human and animal studies have addressed mechanistic issues regarding renal disease progression. These advances warrant detailed discussion.", 
    "16": "The African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension Study Group trial found that an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor was superior to a calcium antagonist or beta-blocker in ameliorating renal disease progression in African-Americans. An attempt to show an advantage of lowering blood pressure to less than 130/80 compared with 140/90 mmHg showed no additional benefit. However, a meta-analysis of 2000 non-diabetic hypertensive patients suggested that lower blood pressures are beneficial, particularly in individuals with proteinuria. An autopsy study of hypertensive and normotensive individuals dying in motor vehicle accidents supported the theory that hypertensive individuals have fewer, albeit larger, glomeruli than normotensive individuals. An animal study in sheep showed similar findings in sheep born to dams given dexamethasone compared with placebo. Animal studies involving stress, immunity, and cytokines shed further light on the mechanisms. The transfer of Smad7 ameliorated renal damage in rats with ureteral obstruction and fibrosis.", 
    "17": "Guidelines suggest prescribing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin 1 receptor blocker therapy to all patients with decreased renal function and hypertension with or without diabetes. The possibility that essential hypertension involves reduced glomerular numbers received support, as well as the theory of prenatal imprinting. Progress is being made regarding basic mechanisms and novel therapies.", 
    "18": "Occurrences of arrhythmias during the acute myocardial infarction is explained with local ischaemia, but mechanism of later occurrences is unclear. Our study had for the aim to examine relationship between postinfarction left ventricle dilatation and appearance of arrhythhmias, and to show drug effects on remodelling. Patients who developed progressive left ventricle dilatation had higher mortality then patients without changes of left ventricle volume, and mortality is due of sudden cardiac death. Drugs who had preventive effects or reverse remodelling can help in prevention of malignant arrhythhmias and sudden cardiac death. It is showed that ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers and aldosterone antagonists had preventive effects on left ventricle remodelling. The combined therapy with ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers and aldosterone antagonists is showed as the most-effective in prevention of remodelling, appearaance of arrhythhmias and sudden cardiac death.", 
    "19": "Earlier studies have revealed beneficial effects of metabolic therapy in animals with congestive heart failure (CHF) due to myocardial infarction. Because heart failure is also associated with attenuated response to catecholamines, we examined the effects of propionyl L-carnitine (PLC) (a carnitine derivative) therapy on the beta-adrenoceptor (beta-AR) signal transduction in the failing heart.", 
    "20": "Heart failure in rats was induced by occluding the coronary artery and 3 weeks later the animals were treated with or without 100 mg/kg (intraperitoneally, daily) PLC for 5 weeks. The animals were assessed for their left ventricular function and inotropic responses to isoproterenol. Crude membranes were isolated from the remote, nonischemic (viable) left ventricle and examined for changes in beta-AR and adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity.", 
    "21": "Animals with heart failure exhibited depressions in ventricular function, positive inotropic response to isoproterenol, beta-AR receptor density and basal AC activity; these changes were also attenuated by PLC treatment. The stimulation of AC activities with isoproterenol, 5'-guanyl imidodiphosphate, forskolin and sodium fluoride was decreased in the failing hearts and these changes were also prevented by PLC treatment.",

    "23": "Lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) may play key roles in atherosclerosis, and have been shown to regulate nitric oxide (NO) production. However, the molecular mechanisms by which betaxolol, a specific beta 1-antagonist, stimulates endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) expression associated with LOX-1 and VEGF are unclear. We hypothesized that in the left ventricle of Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) rats, betaxolol reduces production of LOX-1 by suppressing NAD(P)H oxidase p47phox expression; betaxolol stimulates eNOS production associated with expression of VEGF and LOX-1; and betaxolol inhibits adhesion molecule and signal transduction, which may be involved in cardiovascular remodeling.", 
    "24": "After 5 weeks of feeding an 8% NaCl diet to 6-week-old DS rats (i.e. at 11 weeks of age), a distinct stage of concentric left ventricular hypertrophy was noted. Betaxolol (0.9 mg/kg per day) was administered to 6-week-old DS rats for 5 weeks until the onset of left ventricular hypertrophy stage.", 
    "25": "Decreased expression of eNOS and VEGF in DS rats was increased by betaxolol. Upregulated LOX-1, NAD(P)H oxidase p47phox, intercellular and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 expression and phosphorylations of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and p65 nuclear factor-kappa B activity were inhibited by betaxolol. Betaxolol administration resulted in significant improvement of cardiovascular remodeling and suppression of transforming growth factor-beta 1 and type I collagen expression.",

Macrocyclic compounds differing in stability of their conformers as well as in a size, steric hindrance and polarity of its internal cavities, comprising a series of five calix[6]arene derivatives completed with one modified calix[4]resorcinarene, were used as neutral ionophores to compose mentioned set of PVC-based electrodes. The output potentiometric responses were registered in the linear supernerstian range of calibration graph of each electrode, i.e. for a constant injected concentration 2.0 x 10(-4) M of investigated drugs, which is related to the amount frequently used at in vitro studies on pharmacological effects of these drugs. The impact of symmetry oriented supramolecular interactions on the responses of developed electrodes were characterised with proposed series of the highly significant quantitative structure-potentiometric response relationships (QSPRRs) combining both three-dimensional (3D) molecular descriptors of analysed drugs as well as lipophilicity and volume polarizability of calixarene-type ionophores. The principal components analysis (PCA) and unweighted hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) were used as the pattern recognition techniques into collected potentiometric database for extraction of the useful information on the molecular and pharmacological similarity/diversity of analysed drugs, thus a high-throughput and consistent identification of therapeutically relevant agonists of beta2- and beta3-adrenoceptors and antagonists of beta1-adrenoceptor was especially achieved. This evidence supports also a hypothesis formulated by results of homology modelling on the subtle significance of an unrecognised supramolecular insertion processes of the chiral drug molecule into the flexible hydrophobic pocket(s) formed by seven helical transmembrane moving domains of beta-adrenoceptors on their final activation, sequestration, down-regulation or blockade.", 
    "40": "A 62-year-old man complicated with old antero-septal wall myocardial infarction and atrial fibrillation suffered from lung and pancreas cancer. He underwent gastro-duodenum bypass surgery under epidural combined with general anesthesia. His ECG and echocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation and his left ventricular ejection fraction was 35%. After the start of surgery under general anesthesia, EHR was stable between 80-100 beats x min(-1) but rapid atrial fibrillation developed with a rate of over 140 beats x min(-1) after epidural injection of 0.375% ropivacaine 3 ml. Treatment including continuous intravenous diltiazem and several bolus intravenous injections of verapamil failed to decrease the heart rate. Therefore we used landiolol, a short-acting beta blocker, to control heart rate. HR decreased without decreasing his blood pressure. Continuous landiolol infusion was maintained for 3 hours and 30 minutes in the ICU. After finishing infusion, his heart rhythm never became rapid atrial fibrillation. We conclude that landiolol is useful for heart rate control of rapid atrial fibrillation.", 
    "41": "Beta-adrenergic receptor blockers decrease intravenous anesthetic dose requirements. The present study determined the effect of propranolol on indocyanine green and antipyrine disposition from the moment of rapid intravenous injection. Anti-pyrine is a physiological marker that distributes to a volume as large as total body water in a blood flow-dependent manner and is a pharmacokinetic surrogate for many lipophilic drugs, including intravenous anesthetics. Antipyrine and indocyanine green disposition were determined twice in five healthy adult males in this Institutional Review Board-approved study, once during propranolol infusion. After rapid indocyanine green and antipyrine injection, arterial blood samples were collected frequently for 2 min and less frequently thereafter. Plasma indocyanine green and antipyrine concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Indocyanine green and antipyrine disposition were characterized, using SAAM II, by a recirculatory pharmacokinetic model that describes drug disposition from the moment of injection. Parameters were compared using the paired t test. The disposition of indocyanine green demonstrated that propranolol decreased cardiac output at the expense of the fast peripheral (nonsplanchnic) intravascular circuit. The area under the antipyrine concentration versus time relationship was doubled for at least the first 3 min after injection due to both decreased cardiac output and maintenance of nondistributive blood flow at the expense of a two-thirds reduction of blood flow (intercompartmental clearance) to the rapidly equilibrating (fast, splanchnic) tissue volume. The increase in antipyrine area under the curve due to propranolol-induced alteration of initial antipyrine disposition could explain decreased intravenous anesthetic dose requirements in the presence of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade.", 
    "42": "The water-in-oil-in-water (w/o/w) emulsification process is the method of choice for the encapsulation inside polymeric particles of hydrophilic drugs such as proteins and peptides which are high molecular weight macromolecules. Our objective was to apply this technique in order to formulate nanoparticles loaded with both a hydrophilic and a low molecular weight drug such as propranolol-HCl. Nanoparticles were prepared using a pressure homogenization device with various polymers (poly--caprolactone, poly(lactide-co-glycolide), ethylcellulose) and different amounts of drug and were compared in terms of particle size, encapsulation efficiency and drug release. Higher encapsulation efficiencies were obtained with both PCL (77.3%) and PLGA (83.3%) compared to ethylcellulose (66.8%). The in vitro drug release was characterized by an initial burst and an incomplete dissolution of the drug. When decreasing the polymer/drug ratio, the release appeared more controlled and prolonged up to 8 h. It can be concluded that nanoparticles prepared by w/o/w emulsification followed by solvent evaporation might be potential drug carriers for low molecular weight and hydrophilic drugs.", 
    "43": "It has been found recently that the platelet activating factor antagonist ginkgolide B is a selective use-dependent blocker of glycine-gated chloride channels. GABAA receptor antagonist picrotoxin is known to block alpha homomeric glycine (Gly) receptors, being less effective for heteromeric alpha1/beta glycine receptors. Studying pyramidal hippocampal neurons of rat, we have confirmed that the effect of picrotoxin depends on the age of the animals. Its blocking ability was characterised by IC50=140+/-12 microM and IC50=354+/-43 microM for 7 and 14 days old rats, respectively, indicating at a possibly increased contribution of heteromeric receptors with animals age. We have revealed that the blocking action of ginkgolide B is subjected to a more drastic change in the same range of ages: the IC50 value is decreased from 1.6+/-0.2 microM for 7 days old rats to 0.27+/-0.01 microM for 14 days old rats. When measured on the background of ginkgolide B (1 microM), IC50 for picrotoxin was 92+/-16 microM. Taken together, these findings indicate that ginkgolide B has higher affinity to heteromeric Gly receptor-gated channels than to the homomeric ones.", 
    "44": "Combined poisoning with calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and beta-blockers is usually associated with severe hypotension and heart failure. Due to the block of the beta receptors, treatment with adrenergic agonists, even at high doses, can be insufficient, and beta-independent inotropes, such as glucagon, may be required. Phosphodiesterase III (PDEIII) inhibitors represent a possible alternative to glucagon in these cases as they have an inotropic effect which is not mediated by a beta receptor.", 
    "45": "In order to lower arterial blood pressure, antihypertensive drugs decrease cardiac output, total peripheral resistance or both. Diuretics, beta-blockers, and central adrenergic inhibitors decrease cardiac output. ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists, calcium antagonists, alpha-blockers, central adrenergic inhibitors, and after a delay also diuretics and beta-blockers decrease peripheral resistance. Diuretics are first line therapy for treating low renin hypertension. Beta blockers are used for treating high renin hypertension and patients suffering additional coronary artery disease. ACE inihibitors can be given for treating high renin hypertension particularly in conjunction with diabetes, heart failure or left ventricular hypertrophy. Combining ACE inhibitors with diuretics potentiates the antihypertensive effect. Angiotensin II antagonists exert fewer side effects and better renal protection than ACE inhibitors. The main indication for calcium antagonists is low renin hypertension, their advantages being strong blood pressure reduction as well as in preventing stroke. Central alpha2 receptor agonists and other vasodilators are chosen only in selected cases and mostly in combination with other antihypertensive drugs.", 
    "46": "Intoxication with L-tyroxine has a low prevalence, high prevalence is observed in pediatric age. Toxic dose is unclear, asymptomatic patients have been observed with doses under 5 mg. Systems with high prevalence of symptoms are cardiovascular system, sympathetic nervous system and gastrointestinal tube. Symptoms could appear from hours to days after ingestion. Early hours after L-tyroxine ingestion, levels of T4 and T3 are not related with severity. However, monitoring seric levels is necessary to lead therapeutic approach and to give a prognosis. Daily determinations of T3, T4 and TSH are necessaries. Determinations of temperature, arterial pressure and blood heart rate are needed to control complications. Beta-blockers and intestinal decontamination drugs are used during therapeutic approach. Other therapeutic options are iopanoic acid and propylthiouracil. In summary, intoxication with L-tyroxine could be a severe situation. It is necessary to describe therapeutic protocols in this entity.",

The Km and Vmax values of lidocaine, bupivacaine and propranolol for FMO are 143, 408 and 210 microM, and 145, 119 and 135 nmol/min/mg FMO protein, respectively. The lipophilicity of the drugs decreased in the following order: lidocaine>propranolol>bupivacaine, under our experimental conditions. Furthermore, the metabolic products of FMO were separated by high-performance liquid chromatography and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and were found to be the N-oxides and N-hydroxylamines of the respective drugs. These findings suggest that lidocaine, bupivacaine and propranolol are substrates for FMO, and the enzymatic toward lidocaine or bupivacaine may be inhibited exclusively and competitively by propranolol.",

Therapy with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors was recommended in 68%, long acting nitrates in 62%, diuretics in 55%, cardiac glycosides in 31%, Ca blockers in 29% and beta blockers in 22% of all individuals with HF. The prevalence of particular groups of drugs administered in both genders was similar with the exception for calcium blockers, which were more frequently used in women (p<0.001), whereas long acting nitrates in men (p<0.001). In general, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, long acting nitrates and cardiac glycosides use increased with age. On the contrary, beta blockers and calcium blockers were given mostly to younger patients. The most sick patients were more likely to receive angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, cardiac glycosides, long acting nitrates and diuretics, whereas less frequently beta blockers and calcium blockers. Combination therapy was used relatively rarely, with lowest percentage in NYHA IV.", 
    "54": "Compared to the other population studies, both angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and beta blockers were used relatively more frequently, although in the absolute terms the latter was clearly underused. The high rate of Ca blockers prescription is a matter of concern. More attention should be paid to optimising combination usage and introducing beta blockers early in all stable patients.",

In the per-protocol analysis (929 patients who received adequate study drug and had adequate ST-segment monitoring), these figures were 30.0%, 43.5%, 41.0%, 34.8%, and 40.2%. Again, no dose response was observed. The lowest event rates were observed in the 2.5-mg fondaparinux group, which had significantly lower rates than the enoxaparin group as well as for 4 and 8 mg fondaparinux in the per-protocol analysis (p < 0.05). Bleeding rates were low and not different among the patient groups. No differences were observed in fondaparinux concentrations in patients with or without death, myocardial infarction, recurrent ischemia, or bleeding events.", 
    "59": "This dose-finding study revealed no dose response for different fondaparinux doses ranging from 2.5 to 12 mg subcutaneously and suggests that the efficacy and safety of fondaparinux may be similar to that of enoxaparin. Further studies with fondaparinux in ACS might include the lowest dose (2.5 mg) investigated in this study.",

This allowed early identification of barriers to tool use and strategies to overcome barriers. Main outcome measures were AMI quality indicators in pre-measurement (January 1, 2001 to June 30, 2001) and post-measurement (December 15, 2001 to March 31, 2002) samples.", 
    "63": "One or more tools were used in 93% of patients (standard orders = 82%, and discharge document = 47%). Tool use was associated with significantly higher adherence to most discharge quality indicator rates with increases in aspirin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and smoking cessation and dietary counseling. Patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) had low rates of discharge indicators. Patients undergoing percutaneous coronary revascularization were more likely to receive evidence-based therapies.", 
    "64": "These data validate the results of the pilot project that quality of AMI care can be improved through the use of guideline-based tools. Identifying and overcoming barriers to tool use led to substantially higher rates of tool use. The low rates of adherence to quality indicators in patients undergoing CABG suggest that these patients should be particularly targeted for quality improvement efforts.", 
    "65": "The aim of this study was to define the determinants of the linear hepatic disposition kinetics of propranolol optical isomers using a perfused rat liver. Monensin was used to abolish the lysosomal proton gradient to allow an estimation of propranolol ion trapping by hepatic acidic vesicles. In vitro studies were used for independent estimates of microsomal binding and intrinsic clearance. Hepatic extraction and mean transit time were determined from outflow-concentration profiles using a nonparametric method. Kinetic parameters were derived from a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model. Modeling showed an approximate 34-fold decrease in ion trapping following monensin treatment. The observed model-derived ion trapping was similar to estimated theoretical values. No differences in ion-trapping values was found between R(+)- and S(-)-propranolol. Hepatic propranolol extraction was sensitive to changes in liver perfusate flow, permeability-surface area product, and intrinsic clearance. Ion trapping, microsomal and nonspecific binding, and distribution of unbound propranolol accounted for 47.4, 47.1, and 5.5% of the sequestration of propranolol in the liver, respectively. It is concluded that the physiologically more active S()-propranolol differs from the R(+)-isomer in higher permeability-surface area product, intrinsic clearance, and intracellular binding site values.",

In univariate analysis, age, NYHA class, serum creatinine, left ventricular ejection fraction (all P<0.0001) and sex (P=0.046) all predicted survival. Haemoglobin as a continuous variable for all patients was not a significant prognostic marker (P=0.26). However, sub-dividing patients according to 1.0 g/dL increments of haemoglobin revealed that the survival relationship was non-linear. The results from the polynomial regression suggest that the optimal interval is a symmetric one centred around 14.5 g/dL. This was independent of age, sex, NYHA class, left ventricular ejection fraction, creatinine, co-existing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and treatment allocation (P<0.001). There was a minor fall in plasma haemoglobin at the 12-month follow-up (mean change for all patients 0.3 +/- 2.2 g/dL, P<0.0001), with no difference between captopril and losartan groups (P>0.3).",

    "69": "Congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a rare but potentially lethal disease, characterized by prolongation of QT interval, recurrent syncope, and sudden death. In the pregenomic era (1959-1991), sympathetic imbalance was thought to be responsible for this disease. Since 1991 (postgenomic era), 7 LQTS genes have been discovered and more than 300 mutations have been identified to account for approximately 70% of patients affected. Despite the advancement in molecular genetic knowledge, diagnosis of congenital LQTS is still based on electrocardiographic and clinical characteristics. Beta-blockers remain the mainstay treatment. For high-risk patients, the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) offer an effective therapeutic option to reduce mortality. Gene-based specific therapy is still preliminary. Further studies are required to investigate new strategies for targeting the defective genes or mutant channels. For acquired LQTS, it is generally believed that the main issue is the blockade of the slow component of the delayed rectifier K+ current (IKr). These IKr blockers have a \"reverse frequency-dependent\" effect on the QTc interval and increase the dispersion in repolarization. In the presence of risk factors such as female gender, slow heart rate, and hypokalemia, these IKr blockers have a high propensity to induce torsades de pointes. For patients with a history of drug-induced LQTS, care must be taken to avoid further exposure to QT-prolonging drugs or conditions. Molecular genetic analysis could be useful to unravel subclinical mutations or polymorphisms. Physicians not only need to be aware of the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions of various important drugs, but also need to update their knowledge.",

The overall postoperative mortality was 3.2% and 2.3% for the patients with postoperative supraventricular arrhythmias. In none of the cases did supraventricular arrhythmia cause cardiac failure leading to death. Sinus rhythm was achieved with amiodarone in 37 out of 43 patients (86%).

These changes resulted in a higher cardiac index (CI) and a lower systemic vascular resistance (SVR), which were associated with fairly normal mean blood pressure (BP) but higher PP/stroke volume (an index of total arterial stiffness,+29%; P<0.01). After bisoprolol, compared with controls, the randomly treated patients (n=10) had comparable HR but additionally increased SI; PP remained enhanced, EDVI was further enlarged (+26%, P<0.001), stress-corrected MWS was substantially unchanged, and IVRT remained shorter. Overall, these effects attenuated the high-output state, which was associated with normalization of PP/stroke volume without changes of mean BP.", 
    "77": "In human overt hyperthyroidism, myocardial contractility does not play a major role in increasing LV performance, which is instead predominantly sustained by increased preload with enhanced LV diastolic function. In addition, human thyrotoxicosis is associated with increased total arterial stiffness despite fairly normal mean BP. In this scenario, acute beta(1)-adrenergic blockade blunts the cardiovascular hyperkinesia predominantly by slowing HR - a process that is associated with normalization of total arterial stiffness.",

    "85": "It is widely believed that the inflammatory events mediated by microglial activation contribute to several neurodegenerative processes. Alzheimer's disease, for example, is characterized by an accumulation of beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) in neuritic plaques that are infiltrated by reactive microglia and astrocytes. Although Abeta and its fragment 25-35 exert a direct toxic effect on neurons, they also activate microglia. Microglial activation is accompanied by morphological changes, cell proliferation, and release of various cytokines and growth factors. A number of scientific reports suggest that the increased proliferation of microglial cells is dependent on ionic membrane currents and in particular on chloride conductances. An unusual chloride ion channel known to be associated with macrophage activation is the chloride intracellular channel-1 (CLIC1). Here we show that Abeta stimulation of neonatal rat microglia specifically leads to the increase in CLIC1 protein and to the functional expression of CLIC1 chloride conductance, both barely detectable on the plasma membrane of quiescent cells. CLIC1 protein expression in microglia increases after 24 hr of incubation with Abeta, simultaneously with the production of reactive nitrogen intermediates and of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). We demonstrate that reducing CLIC1 chloride conductance by a specific blocker [IAA-94 (R(+)-[(6,7-dichloro-2-cyclopentyl-2,3-dihydro-2-methyl-1-oxo-1H-inden-5yl)-oxy] acetic acid)] prevents neuronal apoptosis in neurons cocultured with Abeta-treated microglia. Furthermore, we show that small interfering RNAs used to knock down CLIC1 expression prevent TNF-alpha release induced by Abeta stimulation. These results provide a direct link between Abeta-induced microglial activation and CLIC1 functional expression.",

At none of the visits did the 95% CIs for between-treatment comparisons exceed 1.5 mm Hg and, at most of the visits, these intervals did not exceed 1.0 mm Hg. Mean baseline IOP was approximately 25 mm Hg in both groups. IOP was reduced at all posttreatment visits to 18 to 19 mm Hg at peak and to approximately 19 to 20 mm Hg at trough drug level in both treatment groups. Mean reductions from baseline were 6 to 7 mm Hg at peak and 5 to 6 mm Hg at trough (25.5%-28.7% and 20.8%-24.7%, respectively). Seventeen patients (5.1%) withdrew due to adverse events (AEs) (10 patients [6.0%] and 7 patients [4.2%] in the TLA and TIM groups, respectively). Based on biomicroscopic and ophthalmoscopic examination and volunteered symptoms, the safety profile was similar between the 2 treatments, except for burning and stinging on instillation, with an incidence of 41.6% in the TLA group and 22.9% in the TIM group (P = 0.001).

HNE is metabolized to the non-toxic 4-hydroxy-trans-2-nonenoic acid (HNEAcid) by aldehyde dehydrogenases in the rat cerebral cortex. Based upon the structural similarity of HNEAcid to ligands of the gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) receptor, we hypothesized that HNEAcid is an endogenous ligand for the GHB receptor. HNEAcid displaced the specific binding of the GHB receptor ligand (3)H-NCS382 (30 nm) in membrane preparations of human frontal cerebral cortex and whole rat cerebral cortex with IC(50s) of 3.9 +/- 1.1 and 5.6 +/- 1.2 micro m, respectively. Inhibition was attenuated when the carboxyl group of HNEAcid was replaced with an aldehyde or an alcohol. HNEAcid (300 micro m) did not displace the binding of beta-adrenergic receptor and GABA(B) receptor antagonists, demonstrating the selectivity of HNEAcid for the GHB receptor. HNEAcid is formed in homogenates of human frontal cortical gray matter in an NAD(+)-dependent (V(Max), 0.71 nmol/min/mg) and NADP(+)-dependent (V(Max), 0.12 nmol/min/mg) manner. Lastly, (3)H-NCS382 binding is elevated 2.7-fold with age in the cerebral cortex of rats. Our data demonstrate that an HNE metabolite, formed in rat and human brain, is a signaling molecule analogous to other bioactive lipid peroxidation products.",

The main points of the initiation on of antihypertensive treatment in diabetic patients are reviewed. In order to decrease the target organ damages the treatment of early recognized cardiovascular risk factors are of great importance. The target value of antihypertensive treatment in diabetic patients is < 130/80 mmHg (in case of proteinuria > 1 g daily: < 125/75 mmHg). The global cardiovascular risk is high or very high in diabetic patients both with grade I-III hypertension and with high normal blood pressure, therefore, treatment with antihypertensive drug (besides life style optimalisation) should be initiated promptly in these cases. In case of micro- or macroalbuminuria antihypertensive drug (mainly with characteristics of blocking the renin-angiotensin-system) should be given to each diabetic subject irrespective of actual blood pressure values. Success of antihypertensive treatment in diabetic patients could be achieved mainly with combination therapy only.

Methods were developed with a conventional capillary electrophoresis (CE) apparatus and a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) microchip system. With CE the separation of oxprenolol, atenolol, timolol, and acebutolol from a standard solution containing 5 microg/mL of each compound was accomplished by performing ZE with transient ITP. The electrolyte system consisted of 10 mM sodium morpholinoethane sulfonate (pH 5.5) and 0.1% methylhydroxyethylcellulose as the leading electrolyte and 30 mM ortho-phosphoric acid (pH 2.0) as both the terminating and the ZE background electrolyte. With the microchip system the separation of oxprenolol and acebutolol from a standard solution containing 10 microg/mL of each compound was accomplished by a coupled-channel ITP-ZE device using the same leading electrolyte solution as the CE system but 5 mM glutamic acid (pH 3.4) as terminating and background electrolytes. The systems were used for analyses of patient urine samples. Water-soluble hydrophilic matrix compounds were removed from the urine samples by solid-phase extraction (SPE).

We synthesized a carbamate-type coumarin derivative of L-TBOA 3a as a caged blocker and compared 3a with the corresponding ester-type analogs 1. The carbamate 3a was less sensitive to photolysis than the ester 1 but was more stable in the aqueous solution. The [6,7-bis(carboxymethoxy)-coumarin-4-yl]methylcarbonyl (BCMCMC) group exhibited good results both in photoreactivity and stability.

In the present paper we will consider the main results of studies on the natural history of DCM in 581 consecutive patients prospectively enrolled and systematically followed in the Heart Muscle Disease Registry of Trieste in the last 25 years. In the last decades prognosis of DCM significantly improved over time, mainly as a consequence of optimized treatment with ACE-inhibitors and beta-blockers. However, a strong heterogeneity of prognosis was observed among patients both in familial and sporadic cases. Early diagnosis and treatment allowed to recognize two distinct subgroups, one with a rapidly progressive downhill course, high mortality and urgent indication to heart transplantation, another with a more favorable outcome. Long-term optimized treatment with ACE-inhibitors (in 90% of cases) and beta-blockers (in 87% of cases) was associated with a remarkable clinical improvement in 50% of patients and apparent \"healing\" in 16% of cases. A systematic and accurate echocardiographic follow-up showed in these cases a significant improvement of the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) with \"reverse remodeling\", frequently associated with a decrease of severity of functional mitral regurgitation and regression of the restrictive filling pattern. The response to optimal treatment showed a strong relation to long-term outcome. The 8-year transplant-free survival, starting from the evaluation at 2 years, was 31% in patients with persistent NYHA class III-IV, 64% in NYHA class I-II and LVEF < or = 40%, 83% in NYHA class I-II and LVEF > 40% and 94% in patients with apparent \"healing\" (p < 0.0001). Long-term follow-up showed a significant clinical progression of the disease in 33% of cases, independently of the initial clinical response to treatment. Predictive factors of a favorable response to beta-blocker treatment associated with ACE-inhibitors were a history of mild hypertension, an early diagnosis and treatment and the presence of sinus tachycardia. The risk of sudden death was increased particularly in patients with long-term persistent or progressive left ventricular dilation and dysfunction. A rigorous pharmacological approach (optimization of beta-blockers, withdrawal or decrease of dosage of digitalis), and selective non-pharmacological strategy (automated implantable cardioverter-defibrillators for primary prevention in high-risk patients) are potentially effective to decrease the incidence of sudden death during long-term follow-up. In conclusion, the Heart Muscle Disease Registry of Trieste gave us in the last 25 years new insights into the natural history of DCM, underlying the importance of a rigorous and systematic approach both at clinical presentation and during long-term follow-up on optimized medical treatment.",

Compared to healthy subjects, diabetic patients have a prolonged QT interval and increased QT dispersion. In non-diabetic subjects, as well as in Type 1 diabetic patients with overt nephropathy, a prolonged QT interval and increased QT dispersion are associated with cardiac morbidity and mortality. There is an increasing number of studies on effects of beta blocker treatment on QT interval and QT dispersion in non-diabetic subjects. In contrast, there are no studies on the effects of beta blocker treatment on QT interval and QT dispersion in patients with diabetes.

It also possesses unique ancillary properties that may account for positive results in a number of clinical trials. It appears to offer particular advantages in the treatment of comorbid conditions, including coronary artery disease, stroke, hypertension, renal failure, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation, that can independently contribute to the progression of heart failure.", 
    "115": "Patients with heart failure face a very high risk of hospitalizations and mortality. Despite the compelling scientific evidence that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists reduce hospitalizations and mortality in patients with heart failure, these life-saving therapies continue to be underutilized. A number of studies in a variety of clinical settings have documented that a significant proportion of patients with heart failure are not receiving treatment with these guideline-recommended, evidence-based therapies when guided by conventional care. Treatment gaps in providing other components of heart failure patient care, including patient education, have also been documented. The demonstration that initiation of cardiovascular protective medications prior to hospital discharge results in a marked increase in treatment rates, improved long-term patient compliance, and better clinical outcomes has led to the revision of national guidelines to endorse this approach as the standard of care. Recent studies demonstrated that beta-blocker therapy can be safely and effectively initiated in heart failure patients prior to hospital discharge, resulting in improved treatment rates and clinical outcomes. The Organized Program to Initiate Lifesaving Treatment in Hospitalized Patients with Heart Failure (OPTIMIZE-HF) is a national collaborative designed to improve medical care and education of hospitalized heart failure patients and to accelerate initiation of evidence-based heart failure guideline-recommended therapies by administering them before hospital discharge. A registry focusing on hospital admission to discharge and 60-90 day follow-up is designed to evaluate the demographic, pathophysiologic, clinical, treatment, and outcome characteristics of patients hospitalized with heart failure. The aim of this program is to improve the standard of heart failure care in the hospital and outpatient settings and to increase the use of evidence-based therapeutic strategies to prolong life in the large number of heart failure patients hospitalized each year.", 
    "116": "The use of beta-blocker therapy has proven extremely useful in a variety of clinical settings, including the management of hypertension, acute- and post-myocardial infarction, and in congestive heart failure (HF). However, there are noticeable differences among individual beta-blockers in regard to efficacy of treatment and clinical outcomes in many of these conditions. These differences are particularly apparent in the treatment of HF, where effects on reverse remodeling and interactions on the periphery are potential factors that can differentiate between the efficacy of one drug versus another. In fact, beta-blockers are not a singular, homogeneous group, but rather a class made up of a number of agents with individual differences in pharmacology, receptor biology, hemodynamic effects, and tolerability. In the event of ongoing disease progression, the onus of choosing the most appropriate beta-blocker falls on the clinician's shoulders. Given the baseline differences among medications of this class, the rationale and manner for transitioning to a different beta-blocker should take into account the specific receptor-blockade subtype of any given agent, as well as any other intrinsic effects attributed to a specific drug. This article includes 2 protocols for switching between carvedilol, a third generation non-selective agent with vasodilatory properties through a1-blockade, and a beta1-selective agent (e.g., metoprolol, atenolol). The aim is to simplify and maximize the safety and tolerability of performing this exchange. With the increasing amount of clinical evidence supporting the use of one beta-blocker over another in the treatment of HF, it behooves physicians treating this patient population to utilize the adrenergic blocking agent that provides optimal therapy with minimal side effects and intolerability.", 
    "117": "The abundance of evidence supporting beta-blocker therapy has resulted in the widespread acceptance of these drugs in the treatment of heart-failure patients. However, beta-blockers are not a homogeneous class of drugs, and important differences in efficacy have been noted between different members of the class. Thus, practicing physicians are faced with a choice when selecting a particular beta-blocker for treating heart failure. One of the considerations is whether to choose a selective or a nonselective beta-blocker. The results of the Carvedilol or Metoprolol European Trial indicate that carvedilol, a third-generation, nonselective beta-blocker with additional a-blocking, antioxidant, and other properties, is clearly superior to a beta1-blocking drug, metoprolol tartrate. The choice between these drugs is therefore unambiguously in favor of carvedilol.", 
    "118": "Beta-blocker use improves left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients with heart failure. A similar effect of b blockers on right ventricular function has been proposed, although the effect of bisoprolol, a highly selective b-1 blocker, on right ventricular function has not been assessed. This study investigated the short-term effect of bisoprolol on right ventricular function in chronic heart failure patients. A cohort of 30 heart failure patients who were not taking b blockers at baseline was studied prospectively. Right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) and LVEF were measured at both baseline and 4 months by radionuclide angiography. Bisoprolol was up-titrated during four monthly visits by a preestablished protocol to a target dose of 10 mg/d. The dose of vasodilators was not changed. Quality of life and brain natriuretic peptide level were assessed. Mean age was 62.7+/-14.3 years. Baseline RVEF was 30.7%+/-6.3% and baseline LVEF was 21.7%+/-9.4%. Mean bisoprolol dose reached was 5.3+/-3.9 mg daily. At 4 months, RVEF significantly increased by 7.1% (95% confidence interval, 3.9-10.2; p=0.0001) and LVEF also increased significantly by 7.9% (95% confidence interval, 4.0%-11.9%; p=0.0003). Quality-of-life score improved from 42.8 to 30.8 (p=0.047). No correlation was found between brain natriuretic peptide levels and RVEF. Bisoprolol treatment for 4 months resulted in a significant improvement of RVEF, which paralleled the improvement of LVEF.",

The aim of this trial was to compare the effects of irbesartan versus atenolol on LVH in subjects with essential hypertension. Because electrocardiographic and echocardiographic parameters of LVH carry disparate prognostic information, both methods were applied in this trial. In the randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial CardioVascular Irbesartan Project, 240 patients with essential hypertension were treated with irbesartan or atenolol for 18 months. Voltage criteria used for LVH were Sokolow index, Cornell index, Cornell voltage x QRS duration product and Lewis index. In parallel, left ventricular mass (LVM) was determined by 2-dimensional guided M-mode echocardiography. After 6 and 18 months, reductions of LVM and voltage criteria for LVH were only found in subjects treated with irbesartan. However, a reduction of LVM was only detectable in subjects within the highest quartile of baseline LVM but not overall. In contrast, reductions of voltage criteria for LVH were detectable after 6 and 18 months even within commonly used normal limits. In conclusion, treatment of hypertension with irbesartan resulted in a significant reduction in the voltage criteria for LVH, although an effect on LVM was only seen in subjects with high baseline LVM. In contrast, atenolol did not lead to reductions in electrocardiographic or echocardiographic parameters of LVH. Because voltage criteria for LVH have been shown to predict cardiovascular outcome independently from LVM, we suggest that both methods should be used to accurately assess the benefits of antihypertensive treatment.",

After beta-blocker washout, isoproterenol potency returned to control values in metoprolol-treated muscles, whereas in carvedilol-treated preparations, isoproterenol potency remained decreased (P<0.001 versus control). In vivo studies were performed in 9 individuals receiving metoprolol succinate (190 mg/d) or carvedilol (50 mg/d) for 11 days in a randomized crossover design. Dobutamine stress echocardiography (5 to 40 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1)) was performed before, during, and 44 hours after application of study medication. Beta-blocker medication reduced heart rate, heart rate-corrected velocity of circumferential fiber shortening, and cardiac output compared with baseline (P<0.02 to 0.0001).

    "148": "Achieving target glycaemic goals while avoiding hypoglycaemia is a major challenge in the management of elderly patients with diabetes mellitus. Repeated episodes of hypoglycaemia may cause extreme emotional distress in such patients, even when the episodes are relatively mild. Moreover, evidence is mounting that hypoglycaemia among elderly patients is a very real and costly health concern. The strongest predictors of severe hypoglycaemia in the elderly are advanced age, recent hospitalisation and polypharmacy. Education is the key to preventing recurrent or severe hypoglycaemia. As such, there should be close coordination of care between the patient, physician and all other healthcare providers in identifying the cause of hypoglycaemia in elderly patients, and appropriate steps should be taken to prevent further episodes. Prevention of hypoglycaemia has the potential to improve psychosocial aspects of elderly health, including enhanced quality of life, boosted confidence, improved compliance with antidiabetic regimens and avoidance of long-term complications. Since the elderly population represents a unique group, it is imperative to focus on the aetiologies that are exclusive to this group. Advanced age itself is a risk factor for hypoglycaemia, and elderly patients with comorbidities are at increased risk when they are hospitalised. Elderly patients with diabetes often have compromised renal function, which intereferes with drug elimination and thus predisposes them to prolonged life-threatening hypoglycaemia. In addition, patients on five or more prescription medications are prone to drug-associated hypoglycaemia. Although sulfonylurea-associated hypoglycaemia is common, drugs such as ACE inhibitors and nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists can also predispose patients to hypoglycaemia. Greater attention should be paid to the avoidance of hypgolycaemia in nursing home residents. Recurrent hypoglycaemia in elderly patients is not only detrimental to achieving good glycaemic control, it is also a substantial economic burden. Once the causes of hypoglycaemia have been identified, it is crucial to formulate and institute a prevention plan. Firstly, global evaluation of the patient should be carried out to identify possible predisposing risk factors. Secondly, target glycaemic goals should be tailored to each patient. Thirdly, selection of antidiabetic agents should be judicious, then patients and family should be educated to recognise and treat hypoglycaemia. Finally, coordinated care should be provided to identify, treat and prevent hypoglycaemia.",

The progress of epidemiology and molecular genetics have allowed a better knowledge of the genotype-phenotype correlation in young patients presenting syncopes due to torsades de pointes or polymorphic ventricular tachychardia episodes which may degenerate into ventricular fibrillation and cause sudden death. The data of numerous large prospective randomised studies have led to more rational treatments with the progressive withdrawal of class I antiarrhythmics and their replacement by betablocking agents.

Pharmacological cardioversion was made in 39 acute cases with the administration of propafenone (in 29 ones successfully) and in 57 elective cases with quinidine + beta-blocker + magnesium (in 49 ones successfully). For the maintenance of sinus rhythm in the 38.8% of cases amiodarone, 24.0% propafenone, 19.9% sotalol, 10.7% beta-blocker, 0.8% quinidine, 0.5% prajmaline was administered, and 5.1% of the patients didn't receive any special treatment. During the one year follow-up from the 391 patients 261 remained on sinus rhythm, in 81 cases (21%) the return of the atrial fibrillation was diagnosed (in 57 of them a successful cardioversion was performed again), 11 patients (3%) died and 38 (9%) were lost for observation. At the time of the one year control 57.8% of patients treated with amiodarone, 61.7% of those treated with propafenone, 67.9% with sotalol and 35.7% with beta-blocker remained on sinus rhythm. The amiodarone was omitted in 17 cases because of its side effects.",

    "160": "Cardiac sympathetic neuronal function is closely coupled with beta-adrenoceptors and adrenergic signaling. However, the recovery process of sympathetic neuronal function and beta-adrenoceptors after reperfusion following transient ischemia is not fully understood. Accordingly, this study was performed to investigate serial changes in sympathetic neuronal function and beta-adrenoceptors after transient myocardial ischemia.", 
    "161": "The left coronary artery of male Wister rats was ligated for 15 min followed by reperfusion. A dual-tracer method of (131)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine ((131)I-MIBG) and (125)I-iodocyanopindolol ((125)I-ICYP) was used to assess cardiac sympathetic neuronal function and beta-adrenoceptor density on days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 after reperfusion. Myocardial norepinephrine (NE) content in ischemic regions (IR) and in remote regions (RR) and hemodynamic indices were determined. Using a membrane preparation of the rat heart after reperfusion, the maximum specific binding (B(max)) of beta-adrenoceptors was compared with (125)I-ICYP accumulation.", 
    "162": "The maximum value of the rate of change in left ventricular (LV) pressure (dP/dt(max)) tended to decrease on day 1 after reperfusion but recovered thereafter. Myocardial NE content was significantly reduced in IR compared with RR on day 1 (272 +/- 49 vs. 487 +/- 93 ng/g, P < 0.01), and the decrease became more severe on day 14 (36 +/- 19 vs. 489 +/- 132 ng/g, P < 0.01) and day 28 (37 +/- 14 vs. 455 +/- 216 ng/g, P < 0.01). Decrease in the IR-to-RR uptake ratio of (131)I-MIBG was modest on day 1 (0.64 +/- 0.12) and became more severe on days 7 and 14 (0.38 +/- 0.12 and 0.35 +/- 0.13, respectively). This reduction was partially restored on day 28 (0.50 +/- 0.18). In contrast, the IR-to-RR uptake ratio of (125)I-ICYP was severely decreased until day 3 (0.60 +/- 0.13 on day 1 and 0.54 +/- 0.19 on day 3) and recovered thereafter. On day 3, B(max) was significantly lower in IR than in RR (83 +/- 17 vs. 100 +/- 12 fmol/mg, P < 0.05), but the dissociation constant did not differ between the 2 regions.",

From this data collection, the two-tiered European draft guideline on the environmental risk assessment of human pharmaceuticals was tested. Measured environmental concentrations in effluents from France and in effluents and surface waters from Germany were compared to the predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) in both countries. In a similar manner, predicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs) derived from acute data and PNECs derived from chronic data were estimated for each pharmaceutical and corresponding PEC/PNEC ratios then were compared in both countries. Globally, results demonstrated that all environmental concentrations (predicted or measured) for each considered pharmaceutical exceeded the 10-ng/L cutoff value, which requires the implementation of the second-tier assessment based on ecotoxicity data. Moreover, the six pharmaceuticals showed a relatively limited acute toxicity, and carbamazepine and propranolol were inaccurately identified as having negligible risks under the current European draft procedure. Such results lead to discussion of the actual procedure on pharmaceuticals, especially on the need of appropriate ecotoxicity tests.",

Drug release from the pellets as well as the mechanical properties, water uptake, and dry weight loss behavior of thin polymeric films were determined in 0.1 M HCI and phosphate buffer, pH 7.4.", 
    "167": "Drug release strongly depended on the type of coating technique. Interestingly, not only the slope, but also the shape of the release curves was affected, indicating changes in the underlying drug release mechanisms. The observed effects could be explained by the higher mobility of the macromolecules in organic solutions compared to aqueous dispersions, resulting in higher degrees of polymer-polymer interpenetration and, thus, tougher and less permeable film coatings. The physicochemical properties of the latter were of major importance for the control of drug release, which was governed by diffusion through the intact polymeric films and/or water-filled cracks.",

Selective suppression of each messenger system was achieved by pretreatment of rats with either lithium chloride or propranolol for 8 days. Consequences of this treatment and/or hypoxia were evaluated by orientation behavior and physical exercise test. Administration of LiCl caused reduction of phosphoinositide level; hypoxia (6000 m) caused further impairments in the second messenger content. The synergism between phosphoinositide and adenylatcyclase systems was demonstrated.",

We investigated pharmacological properties of [3H]-dihydroalprenolol (DHA) transport into C6, IMR32, native lymphocytes, B-lymphoblastoids and MOLT-3 cells. DHA transport was inhibited by a heterogeneous group of structurally related compounds exhibiting an amine group and various aromatic ring structures. It was verified on cells of neuronal/glial and blood cell origin but in detail on B-lymphoblastoids. The latter once showed strongest inhibition of DHA transport using tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline: IC50 = 2.86 microM, imipramine: IC50 = 3.33 microM) and haloperidol (IC50 = 3.98 microM) as a neuroleptic. Antipsychotics like clozapine (IC50 = 11 microM), olanzapine (IC50 = 15 microM), spiperone (IC50 = 66 microM) and EMD 49980 (ICso > 100 microM) were less effective. In contrast to cells of blood origin, a stimulation of DHA transport by antipsychotics was not detectable using neuronal cells. As antipsychotics showed a distinct inhibition and, concerning cells of blood origin, a stimulation of transport after pre-incubation, further investigations seem to be of interest in respect to its involvement in the cellular uptake of drugs and therefore its impact on the quality of therapy of psychiatric patients.",

The aim of the present study was to assess the role of adrenoceptor agonists as a means to induce HO-1 and to assess molecular mechanisms of HO-1 gene expression by adrenoceptor agonists. Induction of HO-1 in primary cultures of hepatocytes and in rat liver in vivo was assessed by Northern blot, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry. The beta-receptor agonists (+/-)isoproterenol and (-)isoproterenol induced HO-1 in primary cultures of hepatocytes but not the inactive enantiomer (+)isoproterenol. No induction of HO-1 was observed after alpha1, alpha2, beta2, or beta 3 agonists. beta1-Receptor agonists dobutamine and xamoterol induced HO-1 dose dependently, whereas the beta1-receptor antagonist metoprolol attenuated HO-1 induction by beta1-receptor agonists. Furthermore, 8 Br-cAMP and forskolin induced HO-1. Inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA) abolished induction by dobutamine and 8 Br-cAMP. Parallel changes were observed for the transcription factor AP-1. In vivo infusion of dobutamine for 6 h induced HO-1 in rat livers. Immunohistochemical detection of HO-1 revealed a pericentral expression pattern of HO-1 in hepatocytes, i.e., the area at risk for ischemia/reperfusion injury. These results suggest induction of HO-1 by beta1-adrenoceptor agonists via the PKA pathway in hepatocytes, reflecting a potential means for \"pharmacological preconditioning.\"",

This study tested whether frequent nurse visits provide additional benefits to antihypertensive treatment. Every 30 days, a pharmacist visited these patients to deliver antihypertensive drugs and perform a pill count. Nurses visited group A (48 patients) every 15 days and group B (52 patients) every 90 days. Ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring was performed 15 and 180 days after randomization. At randomization, groups A and B had the same clinical systolic (191 +/- 5 v 186 +/- 3 mm Hg) and diastolic BP levels (122 +/- 3 v 117 +/- 4 mm Hg), respectively. After 90 days, BP declined more in group A than in group B (35 +/- 5/19 +/- 3 v 27 +/- 5/9 +/- 3 mm Hg). At 180 days, the difference increased because the reduction persisted in group A but decreased in group B (36 +/- 6/21 +/- 4 v 17 +/- 4/10 +/- 2 mm Hg). The mean ambulatory BP monitoring values were similar in both groups at 15 and 180 days. However, the attenuation of the clinic-daytime BP difference was larger in group A than in group B (systolic, -13 +/- 4 v -3 +/- 4 mm Hg; diastolic -11 +/- 3 v -4 +/- 3 mm Hg). The patients with clinic-daytime differences decreased more in group A (systolic, 16 to 10; diastolic, 20 to 14) than in group B (systolic, 19 and 20; diastolic, 22 and 22).

Previous experiments from our group demonstrated morphologic changes in erectile tissue from male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The aim of the present study was to determine whether blood pressure (BP) control is enough to preserve cavernous tissue from the deleterious effect of arterial hypertension. Eight-week-old male SHR and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) were studied during 6 months: Group 1 (n = 10) SHR; group 2 (n = 10) SHR with 7.5 mg/kg/d candesartan (C); group 3 (n = 10) SHR with 100 mg/kg/d atenolol (AT); and group 4 (n = 10) WKY. At the end of the experiment all the animals were killed for microscopic studies. Cavernous tissue was processed by hematoxylin-eosin, Masson's trichrome, monoclonal anti-alpha-smooth muscle actin, and anticollagen type III. Cavernous smooth muscle (CSM) and vascular smooth muscle (VSM) from cavernous arteries and the amounts of collagen type III were evaluated. At the end of the experiment, SHR with C and AT showed similar control in BP (group 2: 131.3 +/- 5.5 mm Hg; group 3: 136.5 +/- 2.9 mm Hg) compared with untreated SHR (group 1: 199.6 +/- 5.1 mm Hg). However, animals with C presented significantly lower values (P <.01) of CSM layer in cavernous space and VSM in cavernous arteries (P <.01), and lower amounts of collagen type III (P <.01) compared to SHR with AT and untreated SHR. We conclude that C provides a significant protective role against structural changes in vessels as well as in cavernous spaces of the erectile tissue, caused by arterial hypertension in SHR, beyond BP control.",

Multiple regression analysis showed that abnormal GTT was independent of the following: level of clinic or ambulatory BP; presence or absence of nocturnal BP dip; cholesterol, sodium, and potassium levels; smoking history; alcohol intake; prior treatment for hypertension; and ethnicity. These results were also independent of antihypertensive medications taken.

It is also controversial whether essential tremor with synchronous electromyographic activity is influenced by the administration beta-blockers, while tremor with alternating electromyographic activity is influenced by primidone. The aim of this study was to reevaluate the effects of beta-blockers and primidone on essential tremor. We also aimed to evaluate the differential effects of beta-blockers and primidone on tremor with synchronous or alternating electromyographic activity and on tremor in different limb positions. One hundred patients (57 female, 43 male) with essential tremor were included in this study. According to the electromyographic pattern recorded from the antagonistic muscles, the patients were subdivided into group with synchronous (SYN) and group with alternating (ALT) activity. After the initial clinical and electromyographic examinations the patients were randomly assigned first to treatment with propranolol (180 mg daily), or to treatment with primidone (500 mg daily) for 30 days. After a washout period of 20 days the patients were assigned to the other treatment. Our results revealed that the effects of propranolol and primidone on essential tremor and on SYN or ALT tremor were similar. Differences between both drugs existed as regards to better primidone influence on the kinetic and intention tremors and to tremor localized outside the limbs. In conclusion it is better to treat patients with kinetic and intention essential tremor and tremor localized outside the limbs with primidone.",

Continuous variation plots revealed that Met forms the inclusion complexes with alpha-CyD, beta-CyD, and HP-beta-CyD in a stoichiometry of 1:1, whereas gamma-CyD forms the 2:1 complex where two Met molecules are included in one gamma-CyD cavity. NMR spectroscopic studies, including ROESY and GROESY techniques, clearly indicated that alpha-CyD with the small cavity includes the methoxyethylbenzene moiety of Met molecule shallowly in the cavity, depositing the benzene and the methoxy moieties around the secondary and primary sides, respectively, of the cavity. In the case of the beta-CyD complex, the methoxyethylbenzene moiety is more deeply included in the cavity, and it is feasible that Met may be able to enter from both primary and secondary hydroxyl sides of the cavity, forming the 1:1 complex. On the other hand, two Met molecules are included probably in an antiparallel orientation in the large gamma-CyD cavity, and the benzene moieties of Met are in contact with each other.",

We examined whether i.p.c. delivery of sotalol and atenolol in rats offers advantages over intravenous (i.v.) application. Following sustained IPC infusion of sotalol or atenolol, pericardial fluid levels exceeded plasma levels 97 and 134 times respectively (P < 0.01) resulting in 3.8 and 4.7 times higher overall left ventricular tissue drug levels (P < 0.05). In a second experiment, the effects of the i.p.c. or i.v. beta-blocker infusions on nitroprusside-induced tachycardia were studied in conscious rats. For both drugs, i.p.c. infusion of 0.03 mg/kg.h produced similar antitachycardiac effects as the 1 mg/kg.h i.v. dose. In a third set of studies, dP/dt max challenged by dobutamine infusion was assessed to study ventricular contractile function after i.v. and i.p.c. sotalol in anesthetized rats. i.p.c. sotalol infusion attenuated the dobutamine response curve to a greater extent than i.v. (P < 0.01). In conclusion, i.p.c. infusion of sotalol and atenolol results in high cardiac tissue concentrations with low systemic drug levels. Similar antitachycardiac effects can be obtained at a 10- to 30-fold lower dose compared with i.v. delivery. Also, depression of ventricular contractility is acquired at a substantially lower i.p.c. sotalol dose. Thus, beta-blocking properties of sotalol and atenolol can be greatly enhanced by applying them i.p.c.",

In Cox analyses adjusting only for treatment effect, ECG strain was a significant predictor of CV death (hazard ratio [HR] 2.26, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.78 to 2.86), fatal/nonfatal myocardial infarction (HR 2.16, 95% CI 1.67 to 2.80), fatal/nonfatal stroke (HR 1.76, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.21), and the composite CV end point (HR 1.99, 95% CI 1.70 to 2.33). After further adjusting for standard CV risk factors, baseline blood pressure, and severity of ECG LVH, ECG strain remained a significant predictor of CV mortality (HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.00), myocardial infarction (HR 1.55, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.06), and the composite CV end point (HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.59). Thus, ECG strain is a marker of increased CV risk in hypertensive patients in the setting of aggressive blood pressure lowering, independent of baseline severity of ECG LVH.", 
    "207": "Differential drug treatment guided by the underlying heart disease may improve outcome of rhythm control therapy. In the present study we investigated in a well-defined group with either lone atrial fibrillation (AF) or hypertension whether there were differences in rhythm control outcome between both groups in relation to the use of cardiovascular drugs.", 
    "208": "One hundred sixty-two patients were included after successful cardioversion of persistent AF. None of the patients was given a class I or III antiarrhythmic drug. Patients' heart rhythm was checked 3 times a day, using transtelephonic monitoring for 1 month after cardioversion. One month after cardioversion up to 68% of patients had a recurrence of persistent AF. During the first 3 days almost no recurrences were seen on beta-blocker therapy whereas recurrences peaked on day 2-3 in the absence of beta-blockers. Univariate analysis showed that the use of beta-adrenergic receptor blockers and the presence of hypertension were associated with a lower recurrence rate at 1 month. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that beta-blockade was the only statistically significant parameter predicting sinus rhythm at 1 month (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.19-0.86, P=0.02).", 
    "209": "Compared with lone AF patients, patients in the setting of hypertension maintain sinus rhythm much better after cardioversion when treated with a beta-blocker. Beta-blockade protects, in particular, against the early subacute recurrences. These findings underscore the importance of a differential approach towards drug prevention of post-cardioversion recurrences depending on the underlying heart disease.", 
    "210": "A simple, rapid, sensitive and specific reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatographic (RP-HPLC) method involving ultraviolet detection (lambda = 210 nm) was developed for analysis of indinavir along with propranolol in samples obtained from ex vivo intestinal permeability studies. Chromatography was carried out on C-18 column with mobile phase comprising of phosphate buffer-acetonitrile (68:32, v/v) pumped at flow rate of 1 ml/min. The proposed method has a short run time of 12 min and involves a simple sample preparation for the purpose of reducing permeability model artifacts and to concentrate the samples. Fluorescein was used as internal standard. The proposed method has been validated with regard to specificity, detection limit, recovery, accuracy and precision. For both the drugs, method was found to be selective, linear (R(2) approximately 0.999), accurate (recovery = 100-105%) and precise (<3% R.S.D.) in the range of 2-20 microg/ml. The limit-of-detection and limit-of-quantification of the method were 40 ng/ml and 100 ng/ml for indinavir, and 30 and 80 ng/ml for propranolol, respectively. Indinavir, a widely prescribed HIV protease inhibitor, suffer from bioavailability problems where involvement of P-glycoprotein mediated drug efflux may play a significant role. The proposed method was successfully applied for intestinal permeability of indinavir to estimate the contribution of P-glycoprotein in limiting its oral bioavailability. The advantage of the developed method lies in the simultaneous determination of propranolol, a passive integrity marker, routinely employed in permeability studies and its selectivity in presence of various P-gp modulators and permeability markers."
