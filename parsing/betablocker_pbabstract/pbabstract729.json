    "0": "The effect of Betadrenol, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent, was studied by means of traffic psychology tests in 29 male patients with cardiovascular disorders. The age range was 29 to 60 years. After a 7-day wash-out period, each subject received either 3 x 100 mg Betadrenol or a placebo daily during three days. Subsequently every patient was given 3 x 100 mg of Betadrenol daily during another ten days. The short-term double-blind study revealed no impairment of driving performance. The results of the open study showed significant improvements, especially in concentration and speed of reaction.", 
    "1": "[3H]-(--)-Dihydroalprenolol ([3H]-DHA) binds to rat spleen membranes with a dissociation equilibrium constant (KD) of about 0.7 nM and a maximal number of binding sites of 272 fmoles x mg protein-1. Approximately 90% of the sites labelled by 1 nM [3H]-DHA possess classical properties of beta-adrenoceptors. The labelled ligand is stereospecifically displaced by the isomers of propranolol and the order of potency of agonists is: isoprenaline greater than adrenaline greater than noradrenaline. Highly selective beta 1 antagonists such as practolol and atenolol displaced [3H]-DHA from spleen membranes in a biphasic manner indicating the co-existence of beta 1 and beta 2 sites (30--35% beta 1; 65--70% beta 2) in this tissue. Support for this classification was provided by the binding of the beta 2 agonist procaterol to spleen membranes. This drug possessed high affinity only for those sites that have low affinity for the beta 1 selective agents. Chemical sympathectomy induced by chronic 6-hydroxydopamine administration did not alter the number or the pharmacological properties of beta-adrenoceptor binding sites. The results suggest that both beta 1 and beta 2 adrenoceptors are probably postsynaptic in spleen.", 
    "2": "Patients with essential hypertension were treated for four weeks with the alpha- and beta-adreno-receptor blocking agent labetalol. Urinary excretion of total catecholamines, metanephrine plus normetanephrine and vanillylmandelic acid was measured with various methods before and during treatment. An unidentified substance interfering with the fluorimetric method for catecholamines and the photometric assay for metanephrines caused falsely high values of those substances. Using appropriate methodology no changes of total catecholamines, metanephrine plus normetanephrine and vanillylmandelic acid excretion were found after labetalol therapy. Our findings are important in preventing errors in the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma as well as in the evaluation of the effects of labetalol on the sympathetic nervous system in man.", 
    "3": "In seven patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension the effects of an acute alpha-adrenergic blockade, alone and combined with a chronic beta-adrenergic blockade, on blood pressure, renal function as measured by standard clearance methods, plasma renin activity, and plasma aldosterone were evaluated. Acute alpha-adrenergic blockade with phentolamine (20 mg by intravenous infusion) significantly enhanced the antihypertensive effect of chronic beta-adrenergic blockade with slow-oxprenolol (160 mg/ day X 14 days) (- 14.5% verus - 7.4% for pulse pressure, - 12.4% versus - 6.0% for diastolic pressure, 2 alpha less than 0.05). Under combined adrenergic blockade renal plasma flow increased, glomerular filtration rate and filtration fraction decreased (2 alpha less than 0.05 each), whereas the fractional clearances of sodium, potassium, free water, and solute load remained unchanged. The activation of the renin-angiotensin-axis, elicited by alpha-adrenergic blockade alone, was suppressed by the preceding beta-adrenergic blockade. These findings demonstrate a favourable antihypertensive action of a combined blockade of alpha- und beta-adrenergic receptor sites without untoward side effects on renal function or the renin-angiotensin-axis.", 
    "4": "The effect of acetylstrophanthidine (AS), a rapid-acting digitalis-like agent, on the ventricular fibrillation (VF) threshold was examined in normal and denervated chloralose-anesthetized dogs. In neurally intact dogs an intravenous bolus of AS (0.075 mg/kg) increased the VF threshold up to a maximum 50% (P less than 0.01) within 30 min after injection. The augmented VF threshold following intravenous administration of AS was not altered by vagotomy. Bilateral stellectomy in vagotomized dogs, as well as carotid sinus and aortic arch denervations, however, prevented the AS induced increase in VF threshold. In neurally intact dogs beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol (0.25 mg/kg) precluded AS effects. These data suggest that the increase in the VF threshold resulting from AS administration in the normal canine ventricle is due to withdrawal of sympathetic tone mediated via the baroreceptor reflex. The direct effect of AS on the myocardium is to decrease the VF threshold.", 
    "5": "Ten patients with clinically complete cervical spinal cord transection of traumatic origin were studied. These subjects do not have supraspinal control of their sympathetic outflow and are prone to marked elevations of blood pressure during visceral and somatic stimulation. This is a result of reflex sympathetic activity via the isolated spinal cord. The arterial blood pressures and heart rates of these patients were recorded on separate occasions during elevation of the urinary bladder pressure and before and after treatment with propranolol, labetalol, phenoxybenzamine and guanethidine. Guanethidine seems to afford the best protection against the marked hypertension occurring during autonomic hyperreflexia. In contrast to the ganglionic blocking agents, it has no anticholinergic or CNS side-effects, and reflex sweating, a valuable indicator of an impending abdominal catastrophe, still occurs. The findings that negative inotropic drugs, i.e. propranolol, guanethidine and labetalol, reduce the marked elevations in pulse pressure which occur during acute bladder distension in quadriplegic patients, suggest that inotropic cardiac responses are mediated by cardiac sympathetic nerves which leave the spinal cord above the T5 level.", 
    "6": "[3H]Dihydroalprenolol, a potent beta-adrenergic antagonist, was used to identify the adenylate cyclase-coupled beta-adrenoceptors in isolated membranes of rat skeletal muscle. The receptor sites, as revealed by [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding, were predominantly localized in plasmalemmal fraction. That skeletal muscle fraction may also contain the plasmalemma of other intramuscular cells, especially that of blood vessels. Hence, the [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding observed in that fraction may be due partly to its binding to the plasmalemma of blood vessels. Small but consistent binding was also observed in sarcoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. The level of [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding in different subcellular fractions closely correlated with the level of adenylate cyclase present in those fractions. The binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol to plasmalemma exhibited saturation kinetics. The binding was rapid, reaching equilibrium within 5 min, and it was readily dissociable. From the kinetics of binding, association (K1) and dissociation (K2) rate constants of 2.21 . 10(7) M-1 . min-1 and 3.21 . 10(-1) min-1, respectively, were obtained. The dissociation constant (Kd) of 15 mM for [3H]dihydroalprenolol obtained from saturation binding data closely agreed with the Kd derived from the ratio of dissociation and association rate constants (K2/K1). Several beta-adrenergic agents known to be active on intact skeletal muscle also competed for [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding sites in isolated plasmalemma with essentially similar selectivity and stereospecificity. Catecholamines competed for [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding sites with a potency of isoproterenol greater than epinephrine greater than norepinephrine. A similar order of potency was noted for catecholamines in the activation of adenylate cyclase. Effects of catecholamines were stereospecific, (-)-isomers being more potent than (+)-isomers. Phenylephrine, an alpha-adrenergic agonist, showed no effect either on [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding or on adenylate cyclase. Known beta-adrenergic antagonists, propranolol and alprenolol, stereospecifically inhibited the [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding and the isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase. The Ki values for the antagonists determined from inhibition of [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding agreed closely with the Ki values obtained from the inhibition of adenylate cyclase. The data suggest that the binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol in skeletal muscle membranes possess the characteristics of a substance binding to the beta-adrenergic receptor.", 
    "7": "Rats were trained by daily swimming or running exercises with and without daily propranolol injections. Both training methods resulted in cardiac enlargement, but only swimming exercise caused hypertrophy of the brown adipose tissue. These changes were antagonized by beta blockade. The size of the adrenals reflected the stress of the treatments, but other known stress parameters, such as the size of the thymus or sexual organs dit not. Only swimming training without beta blockade sensitized the rats to the calorigenic action of noradrenaline. The cooling rate of the rats in water, when taking into account the insulative capacity of the body, was decreased in swimming-trained as well as in propranolol-treated rats but increased in running-trained rats. The latter two changes may be due to circulatory alterations, while the delayed body cooling in swimming-trained rats probably results from increased heat production capacity. Training-induced resting bradycardia and enhanced tachycardic response to isoprenaline were observable only in the animal groups trained without beta blockade. The pressor response to noradrenaline tended to be higher in the trained groups and the propranolol-treated group than in the controls and was smaller in the animal groups trained under the influence of beta blockade. On the other hand, the hypotonic response to isoprenaline was smaller in the propranolol-treated and running-trained animals. The results emphasize the importance of the sympathetic nervous system in the adaptation of an organism to physical training.", 
    "8": "Pretreatment with 6-hydroxydopamine abolished the antihypertensive effects of intravenously and intracisternally administered dl-propranolol in dogs with acute neurogenic hypertension. These results show that the anti-hypertensive action of this drug is dependant on the integrity of central catecholaminergic neurones and suggest an action on presynaptic b\u00eata-adrenoceptors.", 
    "9": "45 patients with ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma were tested to see if, and to what extent timolol and three other different parasympathicomimetics (pilocarpine 2%, carbachol 1.5%, aceclydine 2%) produced an supplementary reduction of the intraocular pressure. An equally marked, additional drop in eye pressure was achieved when patients who had been given timolol over an extended period of time, were additionally treated with one dose of pilocarpine 2% or carbachol 1.5%. Aceclydine 2% produced no statistically significant additional effect. Patients who had only been treated with pilocarpine 2% over an extended period of time and then were given one dose of timolol 0.25% produced a drop in eye presure more than double that of those patients who had been primarily treated with timolol and then received pilocarpine or carbachol. These results will be discussed on the basis of the mode of action of the applied medications.", 
    "10": "The effects of two beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, propranolol (0.2 mg/kg) and metoprolol (0.2 mg/kg) on some physiological and metabolic changes produced by maximal exercise in the horse were investigated. Both drugs reduced the elevation in heart rate seen immediately following exercise and reduced performance as was seen by the increased time taken to perform each gallop. The rise in plasma glucose, glycerol and lactate, and the fall in blood pH seen following exercise were attenuated by both drugs. However, a greater increase in plasma free fatty acids occurred. Exercise produced a nine- to 12-fold increase in plasma noradrenaline levels. Neither drug had any effect on resting levels of noradrenaline but after metoprolol the levels during exercise were increased.", 
    "11": "Twenty-two patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy were treated with the calcium inhibitor, verapamil, which was administered in a mean oral dose of 480 mg per day. After an average of 15 months of treatment (4 to 24 months), the QRS amplitude in the electrocardiogram was significantly reduced from 4.2 to 3.8 mV. Heart volume calculated from chest x-ray films in the supine position decreased significantly from 858 to 766 ml per 1.73 m2. In 10 patients, follow-up heart catheterisation showed a decrease in left ventricular muscle mass in 7 patients and a slight increase in 3 patients. Coronary artery diameter decreased in 7 patients, increased in 1, and was unchanged in 2. The reduction in coronary artery diameter is considered to be a consequence of a reduced heart muscle mass. From all available clinical data it is concluded that verapamil treatment is superior to beta-blocker therapy.", 
    "12": "An in vitro investigation of the action of ouabain on the guinea pig bladder and urethra is presented Detrusor strips responded with an increase in baseline tension and in the amplitude and frequency of contractions. The response of the detrusor to ouabain was not significantly altered by phentolamine, propranolol, or hexamethonium. The response of the detrusor to ouabain was significantly reduced, but not abolished, by atropine suggesting that ouabain acts mainly by stimulating cholinergic receptors in the detrusor although it may also have some direct action on the detrusor smooth musculature. The action of ouabain on the guinea pig urethra was inconsistent. The most common response was a slight decrease in urethral tension.", 
    "13": "1. The plasma propranolol concentrations after a single oral dose of 40 mg were measured in 25 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and compared with those of 16 patients with Crohn's disease from a previous study. Thirteen healthy volunteers were used as controls. 2. In both diseases some high and some low values occurred. This scatter did not correlate with any symptoms or biochemical or haematological data other than with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). 3. Both sets of patients were therefore separated into two groups depending on whether or not their ESRs were above or below 20 mm/l h. In both diseases the plasma propranolol concentrations of the patients with a raised ESR were significantly higher than the controls as well as those of the low ESR group. 4. In rheumatoid arthritis the plasma propranolol concentrations of the patients with a low ESR did not differ from those of the controls, but in Crohn's disease they remained significantly higher. 5. In one patient with Crohn's disease there was a dramatic rise in propranolol concentrations during an exacerbation (ESR 91 mm/l h) compared with those during a remission (ESR 20 mm/l h). 6. A difference in smoking habits did not seem to have been responsible for the difference in plasma propranolol concentrations.", 
    "14": "1 Dose-related increases in airways resistance (Raw) and decreases in dynamic lung compliance (Cdyn) were recorded in guinea-pigs and rats following intravenous injection of propranolol and of the cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, atenolol and practolol. 2 The bronchoconstriction reached a peak in 2 to 4 min and subsided within 15 min. Repeated injections caused identical responses in the airways. 3 The isomer (+)-propranolol, which has only weak beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity, produced identical responses when given alone or when given after a dose of the racemate, sufficient to cause measurable beta-adrenoceptor blockade in the lungs. 4 After the initial bronchospasm had subsided, the beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs and the isomer, (+)-propranolol, produced potentiation of the bronchoconstrictor effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine and histamine. 5 Both the bronchospasm and the potentiation occurred in adrenal demedullated rats. 6 The results indicate that the bronchoconstrictor effects of these drugs are unrelated to beta-adrenoceptor blockade in the airway smooth muscle.", 
    "15": "Timolol, a beta-blocker with special influence on aqueous humor production and less influence on outflow facility lowered the intraocular pressure after one single local application for more than 12 hours. Normal diurnal variations of the intraocular pressure were also observed. Fifty open-angle glaucoma patients from the University of M\u00fcnster, Eye Clinic, took part in a comparative study between Timolol and Pilocarpine. For a period of 17 weeks the patients were given various concentrations of Timolol ophthalmic solution. The continual lowering of the intraocular pressure following Timolol application was noted in 88% of the patients, whereas the rate of success on only 56% could be recorded with Pilocarpine. Side-effects, which for the Pilocarpine-treated patients were very irritating, e. g. miosis with possible night-blindness, accommodation spasms, myopia, etc. were not observed with Timolol. Pupil diameter and pupillary reaction remained unchanged with the application of Timolol. Changes of blood pressure and pulse were not evident. A detrimental influence on the corneal transparency could not be observed in any patient.", 
    "16": "The sympathetic system is composed of alpha and beta receptors. Beta blockers block the beta effect competitively. They slow the heart and decrease its contractile strength. They block bronchodilatation and the vasodillation of muscular arteries. Timolol is a non specific beta blocker. It decreases intraocular pressure by reducing aqueous humor formation. It does not change outflow facility. Its action starts twenty minutes after a topical drop, is maximum two to four hours later and lasts 24 hours and more. Timolol o.50% seems equivalent to pilocarpine 4% while Timolol 0.25% seems equivalent to epinephrine 2%. There is a further drop in pressure when added to pilocarpine, diamox as maximum medical treatment. Tables show its advantages, drawback, adverse reactions, and precautions to be taken.", 
    "17": "The effect of large doses of morphine (1 mg/kg, i.v.) on experimental myocardial ischemia was evaluated in anesthetized open-chest cats. Myocardial ischemia was produced by intermittent coronary artery occlusion and assessed by measuring ST-segment elevation in multiple epicardial leads. The results obtained in the group of animals given morphine were compared with values obtained in animals given saline (control group), propranolol or nitrous oxide (reference groups). Morphine injected before coronary occlusion produced a significant increase in ST-segment elevation after left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion, whereas no significant change was noted in animals receiving normal saline or nitrous oxide. As expected, in the animals that received propranolol there was a pronounced decrease in ST-segment elevation. Our data suggest that large doses of morphine may increase myocardial ischemia when administered before coronary occlusion in the anesthetized open-chest cat.", 
    "18": "A case is presented herein of alopecia developing in a patient receiving propranolol. The literature is reviewed and this case compared to the first one reported. The two cases have similarities, and most importantly, both showed an effluvium of the telogen type. This may be important as a diagnostic aid, if substantiated in further cases. In a survey of several major textbooks this side effect of propranolol is not noted and it is hoped that this article will make practitioners aware of the possible complication.", 
    "19": "Two adult patients ingested an overdose of 2.4 g and 8.0 g of sotalol hydrochloride, respectively, i.e. 7-25 times the mean daily dose. Certain signs as bradycardia and hypotension were similar to those described for other beta-blocking agents. In addition to these, however, both patients had severe cardiac tachyarrhythmias and a considerably prolonged QT-interval in their electrocardiogram. The decline of serum sotalol concentrations followed first-order kinetics with the elimination half-life of 13-15 hours. There was a good correlation between the serum sotalol concentration and the prolongation of the QT-interval. Sotalol differs from other beta-blocking agents in its effects on the action potential of the ventricular muscle and Purkinje fibers of the heart. This is likely to explain the different symptoms and findings of sotalol intoxication compared to those seen in connection with other beta-blocking agents.", 
    "20": "The effect of sympathetic activity on T4 and T3 levels in cold-exposed rats was investigated. Administration of the highest dose of propranolol (2 mg/100 g b.w.) twice daily during 4 days decreased T4 and T3 concentrations in plasma of rats living at 23 degrees C (T4 from 46.4 +/- 2.6 to 25.8 +/- 5.3 nmol/l and T3 from 1.08 +/- 0.6 to 0.82 +/- 0.12 nmol/l). No significant effect on T4 and T3 levels (49.0 +/- 11.6 and 1.48 +/- 0.16 n/mol, respectively) after the administration of the same dose regimen of propranolol was observed in rats exposed to cold for 4 weeks. T4 and T3 levels in rats exposed to cold for 4 weeks were not significantly altered 1 week after sympathectomy, while remaining in the cold. However, chemical sympathectomy before cold exposure delayed the cold induced T3 elevation occurring during the first week of cold exposure (controls: from 1.16 +/- 0.19 to 1.44 +/- 0.29 nmol/l; sympathectomized rats: from 1.07 +/- 0.12 to 1.17 +/- 0.22 nmol/l). After 2 weeks of cold exposure the T3 levels of controls and sympathectomized rats were not significantly different (controls: 1.45 +/- 0.12 nmol/l, sympathectomized rats: 1.38 +/- 0.15 nmol/l). No effect of sympathectomy was observed on T4 levels. These experiments show that the role of sympathetic activity in increasing T3 is not clear during cold exposure. They provide some evidence that sympathetic activity may play a role in the initiation of the process leading to increased T3 plasma levels during cold exposure.", 
    "21": "1. In 9 male hypertensives the influence of a long-term cardioselective (200 mg Metoprolol) and non-cardioselective (15 mg Pindolol) beta-receptor blockade on the blood pressure, O2-uptake and carbohydrate metabolism was investigated at rest and during a short (6 min, 100 Watt), long (30 min under steady-state conditions with a heart rate of 130/min) and maximal ergometric work and 5 min after that. 2. In this cross-over trial the blood pressure was reduced significantly (p less than 0.01) and in an identical manner by both beta-receptor blockers. 3. Though there was a significant (p less than 0.01) reduction of the heart rate of 26% by Metoprolol (M) and of 21.2% by Pindolol (P), the O2-uptake during submaximal work was unchanged under P with 1.66 +/- 0.4 l/min and under M with 1.7 +/- 0.44 l/min in comparison with the control (C) of 1.71 +/- 0.38 l/min. The maximal O2-uptake was insignificantly reduced by Pincolol (C 2.51 l/min; M 2.46 l/min; P 2.11 l/min). 4. Only under Pindolol we found in all patients a marked and insignificant (p less than 0.01) drop of the blood sugar level in the 30th min of ergometric work (C 76.2 +/- 11; M 72.6 +/- 9; P 55.3 +/- 11 mg/dl), under maximal work (C 74 +/- 12; M 73.2 +/- 10; P 54.2 +/- 11 mg/dl) and 5 min after (C 83.6 +/- 11; M 87.6 +/- 15; 69 +/- 19 mg/dl). 5. The lactic acid level showed under both beta-receptor blockers the same tendency to decrease. 6. The drop of the blood sugar to hypoglycemic values is due to an impaired glycogenolysis in the skeletal muscles and implies a considerable reduction of the physical capacity. Therefore the cardioselective beta-receptor blocker Metoprolol is recommended especially for the treatment of young hypertensives and for all patients who need their physical fitness in order to achieve their work or to perform a preventive and rehabilitative training.", 
    "22": "The effect of acute beta-adrenoceptor blockage (Metoprolol) (M), 0.1 mg/kg i.v.) on left ventricular performance has been investigated at rest and during exercise in 15 patients with 2--3 months old transmural myocardial infarctions. Coronary venous and arterial norepinephrine (NE) concentrations were determined. There was no significant change in arterial and coronary venous NE concentrations (0.27 and 0.22 ng/ml, respectively) after blockage of beta-adrenoceptors (0.36 vs 0.26 ng/ml), which caused a fall of stroke volume from 79 to 68 ml, a reduction of ejection fraction from 62 to 55% and of circumferential fibre shortening form 1.2 to 0.9 circ/sec. During physical exercise the plasma NE concentration in the arterial (0.51 ng/ml) and coronary venous (0.6 ng/ml) blood increased significantly and increased even further to 0.65 and 0.76 ng/ml, respectively, following administration of Metoprolol. The arterio-coronary sinus difference in NE concentrations demonstrate a release of NE from the myocardium. As compared to control values, heart rate following Metoprolol was lower (116 vs 106/min), mean PCV pressure was slightly increased (from 21 to 23 mm Hg) and there was a fall of cardiac index from 6.3 to 5.2 l/min X m2. It is likely that the increased sympathetic activity after Metoprolol and during exercise is a compensatory reaction due to the hemodynamic effects of blockade of beta-adrenoceptors. Further studies are in preparation in order to find out if this is only a transient phenomenon during the early adaptation phase after blockade of beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "23": "The article analyses 188 cases treated for acute left ventricular insufficiency (ALVI) in different forms of tachyarrhythmia. It was established that in patients with supraventricular paroxysmal tachycardia ALVI develops when the rate of cardiac contractions is 180 +/- 3/min on the average, whereas in patients with cardiac fibrillation it develops when the rate of contractions is 163 +/- 4/min. For successful treatment of ALVI of a tachyarrhythmic character it is necessary to restore the sinus rhythm or slow down the rhythm of cardiac contractions in patients with supraventricular paroxysmal tachycardia to 113 +/- 5/min on the average and in patients with cardiac fibrillation to 118 +/- 2/min. Isoptin and obsidan produce the highest decelerating effect. In half of the patients with tachyarrhythmia. ALVI was relieved by means of antiarrhythmic agents among which obsidan and isoptin proved most effective.", 
    "24": "The effects of intravenous pindolol on the electrophysiologic properties of the atrioventricular conduction system was studied in intact dog, using His bundle electrogram and the extrastimulus method. Pindolol was administered intravenously in a dose range of 4 to 40 micrograms/Kg. The latter dosage of pindolol is above those used clinically. Significant effects of intravenous pindolol were observed on sinus cycle length, the A-V nodal conduction time, the ERP of the atrium, the ERP and FRP of the A-V node, and the ERP of the ventricle. Sinus cycle length was prolonged during sinus rhythm. Intraatrial conduction time was not altered by pindolol, while the ERP of the atrium was slightly increased. The A-H interval was generally prolonged by pindolol without Wenckebach type A-V block, but the H-V interval was unchanged. Both ERP and FRP of the A-V node was prolonged. The ERP and RRP of the His-Purkinje system were not statistically evaluated, because no block within the His-Purkinje system were not statistically evaluated, because no block with the His-Purkinje system or prolongation of H-V interval was produced and only a few QRS complexes by extrastimulus showed aberrant configration in the intact canine heart. In addition, pindolol prolonged the ERP of the ventricle.", 
    "25": "Left or right stellate ganglion stimulation resulted in changes of ST segments and T waves of electrocardiogram. The present experiments were performed in an attempt to elucidate alpha-and beta-adrenergic actions, and calcium action on the monophasic action potential duration (APD), that is, the repolarizing phase of myocardium. During experiments in open-chest dogs, right ventricular pacing was performed for avoiding the acceleration of heart rate by stellate ganglion stimulation. Administration of phentolamine, propranolol or D600 prolonged APD, while hydrazine shortened it. However, stellate ganglion stimulation caused a prolongation of APD after infusion of propranolol or hydrazine, and a shortening of APD after infusion of phentolamine, D600 or hydrazine. These results indicate that alpha-and beta-adrenergic actions as well as calcium ions can be related to APD in the ventricular myocardium of dogs; apparently, alpha-adrenergic action prolongs APD and beta-adrenergic action shortens it.", 
    "26": "Dose-response curves to inhaled histamine were studied in 12 normal subjects. Pulmonary resistance (RL) and dynamic compliance (Cdyn) were measured during tidal breathing, and maximum expiratory flow rates, at an absolute lung volume corresponding to 40% of control vital capacity, were obtained during forced expiration from tidal end inspiration (Vmax40p) and from total lung capacity (Vmax40c). Threshold was defined as the histamine dose at which a departure from the range of normal measurements was observed. RL and Vmax40p indicated lowest threshold values, which varied by a factor of 32 and 38, respectively. There was no correlation between reactivity, which reflects the slope of the dose-response curve beyond the threshold dose, and threshold doses, nor between the initial RL (normalized for lung volume) and either threshold or reactivity. In eight subjects, restudied on two occasions after 10 mg propranolol or after saline, injected in a double-blind manner, there was no change in the dose-response curves. These results indicate that different indices of bronchoconstriction may yield different dose-response curves and hence different sensitivities. In addition, a wide variation of airway responses to inhaled histamine exists in the normal population and beta-blockade does not influence this variability.", 
    "27": "According to the experimental model of a 5 X 5 Latin square, 5 treatments were studied single blind in 5 patients, affected by stable-effort angina, by means of exercise tests. In the period of maximal supposed effect the following treatments were investigated: placebo (P), 1 tablet, orally; isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN), 5 mg, sublingually; propranolol (Pr), 40 mg, orally; nifedipine (N), 10 mg, orally; verapamil (V), 160 mg, orally. Placebo, compared with its own control tests, did not change any of the examined parameters. Comparison of the 'active' treatments with P showed the following results. All the treatments increased the duration of work before ECG positivity appearances. An increase in duration of work and total work performed before angina was seen after administration of ISIDN, N and V; the improvement observed after treatment with Pr was not significant. Comparison of treatments showed that work performance before angina was the same after administration of ISDN, N and V; these treatments were more effective than that with 40 mg Pr. Duration of work before ECG positivity was significantly longer after ISDN and N than after Pr. The changes in heart rate, maximal arterial pressure, ejection time index and triple product confirmed the activity of the administered doses. According to the observed effects on exercise tolerance, in comparison with P the same level of work was performed with the same triple product after Pr, and with lower triple products after ISDN, N and V.", 
    "28": "Blood pressure in the common carotid artery, the tone of the cerebral and femoral vessels were recorded by resistography in acute experiments on nonanesthetized cats (local anesthetics, listenon) with artificial respiration. The increased pressure in isolated carotid sinuses was accompanied by a decrease in arterial pressure and in the tone of the cerebral and femoral vessels. In both cases the reaction of the cerebral vessels was less pronounced as compared to that shown by the femoral vessels. The blocking of alpha-adrenoreceptors with phentolamine reduced or abolished completely the reactions noted. After beta-adrenergic blockade with obsidan these reactions persisted. The role of carotid baroceptors in the regulation of cerebral circulation under orthostatic collapse is discussed.", 
    "29": "A 2-week-old premature child with congenital glaucoma secondary to anterior cleavage syndrome was treated with timolol maleate and cyclocryotherapy. The patient had apneic spells of up to 30 seconds that stopped soon after timolol maleate therapy was discontinued. No apnea was seen before timolol maleate administration, and no further spells were noted after subsequent cyclocryotherapy without timolol maleate treatment. Possible central nervous system toxicity of timol maleate or its metabolic by-products in neonates with immature blood-brain barriers was noted.", 
    "30": "The effect of catecholamines and adrenergic receptor blocking drugs on mortality and body temperature was studied in mice subjected to burn, tourniquet, and endotoxin shock at an environmental temperature of 25 degrees C. Epinephrine and norepinephrine (0.5 mg/kg) injected intraperitoneally postburn increased shock mortality significantly (p less than 0.05); pretreatment with these catecholamines had no effect. Pretreatment of burn- and tourniquet-traumatized mice with propranolol (25 mg/kg) significantly decreased shock mortality, while pretreatment with dibenamine (25 mg/kg) significantly lowered early mortality after endotoxin. None of the catecholamines or their blocking drugs significantly prevented the characteristic immediate fall in core temperature after the three types of shock. At 6 days postburn, however, a combination of propranolol and dibenamine caused a marked fall in core temperature (p less than 0.05). These results indicate that beta-catecholamine agonists could play an important role in acute burn mortality and that both alpha- and beta-catecholamine agonists could significantly influence body temperature regulation and metabolic rate during the late postburn period.", 
    "31": "A patient is presented who had two paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias, one slow and incessant and the other fast. Both paroxysmal tachycardias appeared to be atrioventricular (A-V) reentrant, with anterograde conduction by way of a normal A-V pathway. Two pathways conducting in retrograde manner were demonstrated, characterized by different conduction times (fast and slow), identical abnormal atrial activation sequence and A-V nodal-like properties (retrograde Wenckebach periodicity with rapid ventricular pacing, and depression with ouabain and propranolol). Thus, there appeared to be two anomalous A-V bundles with nodal-like properties conducting in retrograde fashion. Whether the paroxysmal tachycardia was fast or slow depended on which of these pathways was utilized. Spontaneous cure of incessant paroxysmal tachycardia was observed and coincided with unexplained total loss of ability for ventriculoatrial conduction.", 
    "32": "Noninvasive measurements of maximal oxygen intake and invasive measurement of systemic and pulmonary arterial pressures, arterial and mixed venous oxygen contents and direct Fick cardiac output are reported for 3 healthy men and 14 men with coronary heart disease. Observations were obtained at supine and sitting rest, during graded levels of upright exercise on a treadmill up to symptom-limited maximal effort and in two periods of recovery. The effects of 40 mg of propranolol orally were ascertained by repeating the measurements 1 to 1 1/2 hours later. The most consistent effect of propranolol was reduction of pressure-rate products at all phases; slowing of heart rate was significant only during exercise and recovery, and the greater slowing was accompanied by a significant increase in stroke volume. These changes were similar in patients with and without evidence of left ventricular impairment greater than 15 percent on exercise testing. Maximal oxygen intake decreased in healthy subjects and decreased slightly in patients with coronary heart disease with less than 15 percent left ventricular impairment or percent deviation of pressure-rate product from age-predicted normal values during the control study. Maximal oxygen intake increased in patients with more than 15 percent left ventricular impairment. Arterial-mixed venous oxygen difference increased after propranolol because of a reduction of mixed-venous oxygen content attributed to greater peripheral extraction of oxygen.", 
    "33": "Left circumflex coronary blood flow was increased significantly (20 per cent) during stimulation of somatic afferent fibers. The change in CBF was associated with significant increases in heart rate and arterial pressure and significant decrease in coronary vascular resistance. Controlling heart rate or preventing cardiac beta-adrenergic effects with propranolol during somatic nerve stimulation resulted in increases in CBF and arterial pressure with no change in coronary resistance. These results indicate that stimulation of a somatic nerve elicited an increase in CBF which could be explained on the basis of an increase in perfusion pressure plus a decrease in CVR resulting from the increased metabolic demand secondary to the increase in heart rate. There was no evidence of a significant neural component directly affecting CVR, even in the presence of beta-adrenergic blockade.", 
    "34": "A convenient test of growth hormone (GH) provocation using oral doses of L-dopa and propranolol (L + P) is compared with insulin-induced hypoglycemia (IIH) in 28 children and adolescents with short stature. In eight of these children, growth hormone deficiency was diagnosed when GH failed to rise above 7 ng/ml. The GH levels of the remaining GH-responsive children were significantly higher after administration of L + P (P less than .05) when compared with IIH given before L + P on the same morning or on a separate day.", 
    "35": "Coronary artery spasm can occur in the presence of excessive alpha-adrenergic tone. A decrease in protective coronary vasodilator substance and enhanced alpha-adrenergic responsiveness, which occurs in the setting of hypothroidism and beta blockade, predisposes to coronary artery spasm. The case presented supports these concepts.", 
    "36": "Atropine sulfate causes bradycardia in doses which are greater than the usual anticholinergic doses producing tachycardia (Shucard and Andrew, 1977, Res. Comm. Chem. Path. Pharmacol. 16, 401-410). The present study was designed to evaluate the effects of large doses of atropine sulfate on heart rate and systemic blood pressure in rats. Six groups of urethane anesthetized, male, Sprague Dawley rats (200-450 g) were injected with varying doses of atropine via the jugular vein. Groups I through IV received 5 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, 40mg/kg and 80 mg/kg, respectively. Group V was bilaterally vagotomized before the injection of 80 mg/kg of atropine. Animals in Group VI were bilaterally vagotomized and pretreated with propranolol-HCl before injection of 40 mg/kg of atropine. Atropine caused a significant (p less than 0.005) dose-dependent reduction in both heart rate and blood pressure. The negative chronotropic property of atropine shown in these experiments is in agreement with recent in vitro and in vitro studies. The cause of bradycardia in these doses appears to be an intrinsic property of atropine rather than being centrally mediated. Possible direct action by atropine on peripheral vascular resistance is discussed.", 
    "37": "The adrenergic mechanisms involved in the sinus tachycardia which follows the termination of vagal stimulation (\"postvagal tachycardia\") were studied in the anesthetized dog. The following results were obtained. Postvagal tachycardia: 1) is not affected by ventricular or atrial drive; 2) is enhanced by the application of either norepinephrine or dopamine on the sinus node area; 3) is increased in magnitude and duration by the catecholamine uptake blockers desipramine and phenoxybenzamine; 4) is significantly reduced by beta blockade with propranolol; 5) is not affected by alpha blockade with phentolamine or dopaminergic blockade with haloperidol; 6) is not affected by Disulfiram, a drug which inhibits dopamine beta-hydroxylase and thereby increases endogenous dopamine; 7) rises more slowly to a smaller peak after bretylium; and 8) is enhanced by phenoxybenzamine, but not by desipramine, after destruction of sympathetic nerves by 6-hydroxydopamine. It is concluded that release of catecholamines by vagally liberated acetylcholine is involved in postvagal tachycardia. The released catecholamine acts on beta but not alpha or dopamine receptors. Catecholamines released from sympathetic nerves may account for an initial component in postvagal tachycardia, but catecholamine(s) released from extraneuronal stores account for most of postvagal tachycardia.", 
    "38": "The importance of renal perfusion pressure (RPP), the sympathetic beta adrenergic nervous system and renal prostaglandins (PG) on renin release during a uniform 15-17% reduction in blood pressure by hemorrhage (HH) was studied systematically in anesthetized dogs. All groups of animals had similar decrements in systemic and renal hemodynamics with HH. In control dogs (n = 7), both plasma renin activity (PRA, 4.1-9.0 ng angiotensin I/ml per h, P < 0.05) and renin secretory rate (RSR, 26-228 ng/ml per h.min, P < 0.005) increased significantly with HH. This increase in renin release during HH was not abolished by any single maneuver alone including beta adrenergic blockade with d,l-propranolol (n = 6), renal PG inhibition with indomethacin (n = 7), or control of RPP (n = 6). However, when beta adrenergic blockade was combined with control of RPP (n = 7) during HH, neither PRA (1.9-2.7 ng/ml per h, NS) nor RSR (16-53 ng/ml per h.min, NS) increased significantly. Similarly, a combination of beta adrenergic blockade and PG inhibition (n = 6) also abolished the increase in PRA (1.5-1.4 ng/ml per h, NS) and RSR (14-55 ng/ml per h.min, NS) during HH despite significant decreases in sodium excretion. Finally, a combination of PG inhibition and RPP control was associated with significant increases in PRA and RSR during HH. These results support a multifactorial mechanism in renin release during HH and implicate both the beta adrenergic receptors, renal baroreceptors, and possibly the macula densa as constituting the primary pathways of renin release during HH of this magnitude. Because either constant RPP or PG inhibition blunted renin release during HH in the setting of beta adrenergic blockade, the present results strongly suggest that the renal baroreceptor, and probably the macula densa mechanism are PG mediated.", 
    "39": "Any patient with elevated blood pressure on at least two occasions should have a hypertensive workup; however, extensive evaluation for a correctable cause of hypertension is seldom necessary unless findings in the history, physical examination, or basic laboratory tests are abnormal. Diuretics are the cornerstone of therapy. If blood pressure does not respond adequately to these agents, a step-care approach with more potent antihypertensives is indicated.", 
    "40": "1. The short term effects of hydrallazine, oxprenolol and oxprenolol plus hydrallazine were studied in five patients with essential hypertension. 2. The increase in pulse rate caused by hydrallazine was prevented by combined treatment with oxprenolol, which also lowered the high plasma noradrenaline levels, associated with the use of hydrallazine. 3. Plasma renin activity was higher in the supine and standing positions with hydrallazine than with oxprenolol alone and with the patients standing this high renin level was prevented by simultaneous treatment with oxprenolol. With the patients supine, combination of oxprenolol with hydrallazine resulted in a mean plasma renin activity which was less than half that with hydrallazine alone, although this difference was not statistically significant. 4. The combination of oxprenolol with hydrallazine did not lower the blood pressure further, but reduced the increased sympathetic activity which occurred with hydrallazine alone.", 
    "41": "The antimanic action of high doses of the beta-receptor blocking agent propranolol was investigated by the use of a double-blind placebo controlled ABA design. For comparison, the d-stereoisomer (which is practically devoid of beta-blocking activity) was used. 6 trials were performed with d-propranolol, 6 trials with the racemic mixture. From dose-effect relations one can conclude that the d-stereoisomer is about half as effective against manic syndromes as the racemic mixture. From this finding it can be concluded that the antimanic action of propranolol is at least partially due to a mechanism independent of its beta-blocking action.", 
    "42": "The duration of the effects of single oral doses of 80 and 160 mg of propranolol was studied in 11 patients with stable, exercise-induced angina pectoris. After administration of both doses, plasma propranolol levels peaked at 2 hours in 8 of the 11 patients and thereafter declined exponentially with an average plasma half-life of 3.98 hours (range 1.4 to 4.3) after the 80 mg dose and 4.28 hours (range 1.9 to 5.4) after the 160 mg dose. There was wide interindividual variation in plasma propranolol concentration at any given time after each dose. Treadmill walking time to the onset of angina, the total duration of exercise and the total external work performed were significantly greater by 1 hour after each dose of propranolol than after placebo. This improvement in exercise tolerance persisted unchanged for 8 hours (P less than 0.001) and was still significant although less marked at 12 hours (P less than 0.05). Improvement in exercise tolerance after propranolol was associated with a significant reduction in S-T segment depression during exercise. Both at rest and during exercise, heart rate, systolic blood pressure and rate-pressure product decreased after propranolol, and these circulatory effects persisted for 12 hours. Changes in walking time, heart rate and systolic blood pressure were similar after 80 and 160 mg of propranolol. Despite the increase in exercise duration and in total work performed after propranolol, the rate-pressure product at the onset of angina was lower after propranolol. In view of the prolonged effects of single oral doses of 80 and 160 mg of propranolol, it is suggested that administration of propranolol twice daily should be adequate in treating patients with stable angina pectoris. These studies also demonstrate that routine measurement of plasma propranolol levels is of little practical value in the management of patients with angina pectoris.", 
    "43": "Diastolic time (DT) is calculated as the cycle length (RR) minus electromechanical systole (QS2). The ratio of DT (RR-QS2) to RR interval times 100, or the percent diastole (%D), varies nonlinearly with heart rate (HR), increasing rapidly with decreasing HR. The effect of commonly used cardioactive agents on %D was studied in five groups of normal subjects. In group 1 (n = 12), propranolol (160 mg daily) increased %D from 55.9 +/- 1.7 to 64.7 +/- 1.3 (p less than 0.001) by slowing HR. In group 2 (n = 12), dobutamine (2.5 micrograms/kg/min) increased %D from 56.4 +/- 1.4 to 61.8 +/- 1.3 (p less than 0.005) by shortening the QS2. In group 3 (n = 10), Cedilanid-D (1.6 mg i.v.) increased %D from 55.5 +/- 1 to 63.2 +/- 0.7 (p less than 0.001), both by slowing the HR and shortening the QS2. In group 4 (n = 12), isoproterenol (2 micrograms/min) increased HR and shortened the QS2 significantly. The net result was a significant reduction of %D from 56.1 +/- 1.4 to 53.5 +/- 1.1, (p less than 0.05). In group 5 (n = 15), a 100-mg bolus of i.v. lidocaine did not have a significant effect on %D. This study indicates that cardiovascular drugs may have significant effects on the relative duration of diastole either by affecting HR or the duration of systole. This may have clinical implications for patients with coronary artery disease and patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, since in both cases coronary flow in mostly diastolic.", 
    "44": "In the isolated frog cornea, 10(-5)M timolol completely blocked the stimulation of chloride transport by 10(-6)M isoproterenol. In this preraration, timolol inconsistently modified the response to epinephrine. In some experiments, epinephrine added to the bathing medium after timolol caused a smaller than normal increase in chloride transport, but in other instances, epinephrine caused a decrease in chloride transport. In the isolated rabbit cornea, 10(-5)M timolol totally blocked the stimulation of chloride transport by 10(-6)M epinephrine. In vivo, topical treatment of rabbit eyes with 0.5% timolol resulted in corneas from these eyes having an inhibited response to epinephrine when incubated in vitro. This inability to stimulate chloride transport persisted for several days following termination of topical treatment with timolol.", 
    "45": "The dynamics of amylase release from the guinea pig submandibular gland were studied in vitro by applying a multi-channel microperfusion set. This technique makes it possible to measure time related enzyme release more accurately and to take samples of perifused tissue at short intervals. Stimulation of the beta-adrenoceptor with norepinephrine gives rise to a rapid initial enzyme discharge, detectable within 15 s. Administration of propranolol inhibits enzyme release, which is not restored after removal of the agent. Simultaneous measurements of tissue cyclic AMP during norepinephrine stimulation at various time intervals display a significant increase of cAMP as early as 15 s after stimulation of secretion. This increase of cAMP thus coincides with the discharge of amylase. In addition, cAMP continuously accumulates during 30 min of norepinephrine perifusion of the slices. The present study describes a valuable tool with high sensitivity for visualizing the relations between enzyme secretion from the salivary gland and the intracellular biochemical processes. The data obtained further indicate a close correlation between amylase and cAMP during the initial phase of enzyme discharge.", 
    "46": "1. Rat liver sinusoids were observed by a microscopic in vivo transillumination method. The diameter of liver sinusoids and intrasinusoid erythrocyte flow velocities were measured quantitatively by a close-circuit television technique. 2. Both isoprenaline and the selective beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist terbutaline produced a concentration-dependent dilatation of liver sinusoids and slowed erythrocyte flow velocity. The effects of isoprenaline and terbutaline were antagonized by propranolol but not by the selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol. Propranolol alone produced constriction of the liver sinusoids and increased erythrocyte flow velocity; these effects were not produced by atenolol. 3. The percentage dilatations produced by isoprenaline alone, isoprenaline in the presence of phenoxybenzamine and isoprenaline in the presence of phenylephrine-induced constriction were similar. 4. It is proposed that the beta-adrenoceptors in liver sinusoids are of the beta 2-type, and their physiological role was to counteract constrictor responses produced by alpha-adrenoceptor activity.", 
    "47": "The 3H-labelled alpha-adrenergic antagonist dihydroergocryptine has been found to bind specifically to hamster white adipocyte membranes. Binding is rapid and is inhibited by alpha but not beta antagonists. In addition, adrenergic agonists compete for this binding site in order of affinities equal to their activity as alpha-adrenergic agonists. The (-) stereoisomer of adrenaline is 10 times more potent than the (+) stereoisomer in inhibiting binding.", 
    "48": "The action of stimulants and imitators of the adenylate cyclase function (novodrin, sodium fluoride, cAMP), imitators of the guanylcyclase function (cGMP), inhibitors of adenylate cyclase (propranolol), izanylate cyclase (atropin) or phosphodiesterase (euphyllin, papaverin) on the body acetylating capacity measured from acetyl-PABA release, and CoA content in the liver was studied in experiments on male rats. The substances that mainly produce an increase in cAMP in the tissues augment the CoA endogenic pool and, as a rule, stimulate the acetylating capacity of the body. As compared to cAMP, the eczogenic cGMP raises, but to a significantly less measure, the CoA content and does not change the rate of arylamine acetylation. Paraverin is an exception to the rule since it seems to exert a direct action on the enzymatic system of acetylation. When administered to rats cGMP elicits a cAMP-like but a weaker action on the CoA pool. It is suggested that combined use of test substances prolonging cAMP effects and drugs belonging to a group of arylamines is not advisable because of active inactivation of the latter compounds."
