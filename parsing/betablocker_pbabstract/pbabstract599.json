    "0": "In this open study 21 hypertensive patients (WHO I + II) received after a one-week placebo period a 4-week treatment with a once daily dose of 300 mg celiprolol hydrochloride (Selectol). 21 normotensive subjects receiving placebo during the whole trial period and 20 normotensives receiving no treatment at all served as comparative groups. Prior to the treatment the hypertensive subjects showed a marked lack in acquisition and reproduction of complex visual information and their subjective emotional condition was more negative than that of the healthy subjects. A one-week placebo treatment had no influence on the parameters under test. One single dose of celiprolol had no influence on the specific capacity of driving a motor vehicle and on the emotional condition. Long-term medication of celiprolol did not impair the driving ability. The subjective emotional condition improved as desired.", 
    "1": "In a total of 36 volunteers with cardiac hyperreaction, investigations were carried out on the effect of bisoprolol (designated tradename: Concor), pindolol and placebo on central nervous functions with the aid of a reaction test, spiral aftereffect, tremor test and mood and sleep questionnaires. In the randomized double-blind study performed with 3 independent groups the volunteers received placebo, 2 X daily 10 mg of pindolol or 1 X daily 10 mg of bisoprolol for a period of 14 days. Bisoprolol is a new highly beta 1-selective adrenoceptor blocker with moderate lipophilia and without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA). When compared to placebo neither of the beta-adrenoceptor blockers induced any significant changes in mood, vigilance, tremor and reaction times. Moreover, under bisoprolol no negative effect on sleep quality or feeling refreshed after sleep was determined. Under pindolol, on the other hand, a significant impairment of sleep quality was observed after acute dosage and a decrease in feeling refreshed after sleep, continuing up to day 14 of treatment. It is presumed that, as bisoprolol and pindolol have comparable lipophilia, the different intensity with which the two preparations act on the central nervous system is connected with the ISA of pindolol. In the selected doses bisoprolol had a stronger effect on diastolic blood pressure and heart rate than pindolol and placebo.", 
    "2": "The effect of propranolol treatment on the steady-state plasma levels of ketanserin was evaluated in 6 patients suffering from borderline hypertension and in 2 healthy volunteers. All subjects received ketanserin 40 mg b.i.d. for 21 days. From day 8 to 14 of the study propranolol was given additionally in a dose of 80 mg bid. This dose of propranolol had to be reduced in 3 subjects because of side effects. Steady-state plasma concentrations (measured 4-6 h after the dose) of ketanserin varied from 51.0 +/- 13.6 to 67.8 +/- 13.8 ng/ml (mean +/- SEM) during the entire study period. Treatment with propranolol (plasma concentrations ranged from 45.7 +/- 15.8 to 65.7 +/- 11.4 ng/ml) did not significantly alter the plasma concentrations of ketanserin. The same was true for the minimal plasma concentrations of ketanserin measured at the end of each treatment period. Blood pressure decreased during the 21 days treatment period with ketanserin (mean systolic blood pressure decreased from 144 +/- 5 to 123 +/- 7 and diastolic from 81 +/- 3 to 72 +/- 5 mmHg). Propranolol had a slight additional hypotensive effect. Heart rate decreased during treatment with propranolol. It is concluded that simultaneous oral treatment with propranolol in doses up to 160 mg/day does not alter the first-pass metabolism and the elimination kinetics of ketanserin.", 
    "3": "The defective BAT function of obese Zucker rats has been related primarily to a loss of diet-induced thermogenesis. The normalisation of BAT function by adrenalectomy has been related to the removal of corticosterone. Experiments with propranolol-blockade and on tissue norepinephrine turnover suggest that corticosterone impairs diet-related sympathetic activity but does not alter BAT response to exogenous norepinephrine. The reduction in serum T3 in obese rats is related to the loss of sympathetic activity.", 
    "4": "This multicenter study was initiated to assess the efficacy and safety of celiprolol in a large number of hypertensive patients. Patients received a once daily dose of 200 mg celiprolol for the first 3 weeks. If blood pressure was not lowered satisfactorily after this period, the investigator was asked to rise the dose to 300 mg celiprolol or to add a diuretic for the next 3 weeks. The study included 2694 patients, 2311 of whom were evaluable over a period of 3 weeks, 2077 over 6 weeks. On admission 10% showed isolated systolic hypertension, 38% were in WHO I, 35% in WHO II and 17% in WHO III. Hypertension was known for more than 1 year in 57%, for even more than 5 years in 28%. Concomitant diseases were diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive airways disease, peripheral arteries disease; digitalis comedication in 211 patients. BP was lowered significantly in all degrees of severity of hypertension. There was no obvious connection between efficacy and age nor with duration of disease. Only 229 patients received 300 mg celiprolol during the second period of treatment, 223 patients got additionally a diuretic. Heart rate decreased by a mean of 8 bpm and was lowered mostly in patients with tachycardia. Patients with a heart rate of 60 bpm or below showed a slight increase in heart rate. In no case heart rate fell below 50. Side effects were rare and in most cases not serious. Treatment was discontinued due to suspected side effects in 58 patients only (2.15%). We conclude, that celiprolol is a safe and efficacious drug in the management of hypertension.", 
    "5": "Corneal endothelial cells in primary culture responded to isoproterenol (Iso), epinephrine (Epi), nor-epinephrine (NE), Prostaglandins E1 and E2 (PGE1, PGE2) and forskolin by increasing cyclic AMP 61, 52, 28, 14, 10, and 176-fold, respectively, over control within a 10 minute incubation period. However, when cells were preincubated with Iso for one hour, they lost 76% of their responsiveness to a subsequent Iso challenge. Iso preincubation also decreased the effectiveness of other beta-adrenergic agonists (Epi and NE), but responses to PGE1, PGE2 and forskolin remained unchanged. The decreased cyclic AMP response was associated with a loss of beta-adrenergic binding sites. The affinity of the remaining receptors was unchanged as determined by propranolol displacement of [125I] pindolol binding. This study shows that corneal endothelial cells not only respond to beta-adrenergic stimuli, but can also regulate the magnitude and duration of their response to the hormone.", 
    "6": "The evaluation of myocardial metabolic changes in ischemic heart disease remains centered on the coronary sinus pacing and sampling techniques established over the last 25 years. Lactate remains the marker of choice for most institutions, though centers with more sophisticated laboratories will always be trying to improve on the sensitivity and specificity for ischemia, perhaps using ATP catabolites and nucleotides and measuring coronary sinus flow. The diagnostic value of lactate changes is limited and probably not superior to a well-conducted 12-lead treadmill exercise electrocardiogram test, but it does provide an objective marker for reliable further study and evaluation of interventions. It is almost certainly in the research context that metabolic studies have their place--evaluating drugs, surgery, or angioplasty and perhaps shedding light on obscure entities, such as chest pain with normal coronary arteries and cardiomyopathies. Attention to detail and simplicity of study are more likely to lead to valuable results rather than concentrating on the complexities. Each laboratory should establish the reproducibility of its results before commencing any procedures.", 
    "7": "Evaluations of drug interactions should be done with caution. One needs to be aware of the reported interactions and apply the information on an individual basis. This review may therefore serve as a guide to the more common drug interactions and when drug therapy should be monitored closely in clinical practice. Major drug interactions with calcium antagonists are summarized in Table 2.", 
    "8": "In summary, antiarrhythmic combinations have been explored as a matter of clinical necessity in many instances, and clinical circumstance has led to attempted combination therapy with two, and sometimes more, drugs. Few controlled studies using a specific combination have been performed. Therapy is thus usually empiric, based on available clinical, electrophysiologic and pharmacologic information. Nonetheless, certain general impressions are available, which may form the basis for clinical decisions and for structuring future trials (Table 6). Although single-drug antiarrhythmic therapy continues to be advisable, in certain instances combined-drug therapy may be appropriate and efficacious. The importance of potential adverse drug interactions must also be appreciated.",

    "10": "The aim of this study was a comparison between the hypotensive effects of two fixed combinations (atenolol + chlorthalidone and labetalol + chlorthalidone) in patients suffering from untreated mild to moderate hypertension. Both combinations were effective in reduction of BP values. Heart rate showed no statistically significant modification. The combination of labetalol plus chlorthalidone seems to find its best application in the treatment of mild hypertension.", 
    "11": "The added hypotensive effect of bevantolol, a new cardioselective beta-blocker, was studied in 244 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension following prior treatment with hydrochlorothiazide or placebo. After four weeks of monotherapy with 50 mg/day or 100 mg/day of hydrochlorothiazide or placebo, the mean diastolic blood pressure of the patients in these groups decreased from baseline by 8.6, 8.8, and 4.3 mmHg, respectively. During the subsequent four weeks of dual therapy with 400 mg/day of bevantolol added to the regimen, additional and uniform mean decreases of 7.5, 7.3, and 7.5 mmHg occurred, providing total mean diastolic pressure decreases from baseline of 16.1, 16.1, and 11.8 mmHg in the three groups, respectively. These diastolic pressures were significantly lower during dual therapy than during monotherapy and lower in both diuretic groups than in the placebo group during monotherapy and dual therapy (P less than 0.001). Fewer adverse reactions occurred during dual therapy than during monotherapy. The addition of bevantolol to a thiazide diuretic regimen provided safe and significantly better control of mild to moderate hypertension than did the diuretic alone.", 
    "12": "The number of antiarrhythmic drugs available in the United States is increasing, with the discovery of antiarrhythmic properties of drugs previously marketed for other indications (phenytoin, imipramine) and the development of several new drugs, many of which are likely to become commercially available in the next 5 years. The currently available drugs and several promising investigational drugs are reviewed in this report. Their optimal use is dependent on an understanding of their electropharmacologic effects, pharmacokinetics, drug interactions, and clinical pharmacology. Such use may allow better attempts to reduce arrhythmia-related death and morbidity.", 
    "13": "The effect of pH on [3H]-DHA specific binding and its displacement by various nonlabeled ligands from beta-adrenoreceptors was examined in sarcolemmal membranes from canine hearts. At low pH (6.69) the affinity of beta-adrenoreceptors for agonists is lower than at pH 7.65, causing a 1.50-fold increase in the inhibition constant (KI) of both (-) noradrenaline and (-) isoprenaline. The change in the affinity was attenuated by adding 300 microM GTP to the reaction medium. Low pH neither affected the affinity of antagonists ((-) dihydroalprenolol, (+/- ) alprenolol, ( +/- ) propranolol) for adrenoreceptors nor the number of binding sites determined by [3H]-DHA binding assays. The effect of pH suggests that H+ induces the formation of a low affinity state of beta-adrenoreceptors for agonists. This H+-dependent mechanism may be capable of regulating the process by which agonists stimulate adenyl cyclase.", 
    "14": "Hypertension is common in hemodialyzed patients and constitutes an important cardiovascular risk factor. Fluid retention, inappropriate stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system, sympathetic overactivity and changes of vessel wall structure have been shown to be important factors in its pathogenesis. It has been claimed that hemofiltration permits a better control of hypertension in the interdialytic interval, although the evidence is not perfectly convincing; blood pressure tends to be lower with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. While fluid withdrawal and - within certain limits - adjustment of dialysate sodium concentration constitutes a primary line of therapy, antihypertensive medication is necessary in approximately 20% of patients. Specific problems with dialysis patients are cumulation of drugs (some cardioselective beta-blockers, alpha-methyldopa, captopril), altered dose-response relationship (diuretics) and particularly interaction with cardiovascular stability during fluid withdrawal.", 
    "15": "Radioligand binding studies show that both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors were present in the colon wall, but with a considerably higher concentration of the beta 2-subtype than of the beta 1-subtype. The effect of selective beta-adrenoceptor agonists on isometric force recordings of spontaneous contractile activity and electrically integrated activity were determined in isolated proximal cat and rat colon strips. The use of selective beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents revealed both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor inhibitory interaction by the beta-agonists employed. Comparison of qualitative effects of the selective beta-adrenoceptor agonists led to the hypothesis that the beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors were separated on two functional levels within the colon organ. This hypothesis was confirmed by the reduced maximal inhibitory response of the partial beta-adrenoceptor agonist, prenalterol, induced by tetrodotoxin. Further confirmation was found in the decrease in affinity after tetrodotoxin treatment of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, metoprolol. Pretreatment with 6-hydroxy-dopamine induced an upregulation of the beta 1-adrenoceptor density but a decrease in the total efficacy of prenalterol. This may additionally indicate a beta 1-adrenoceptor-mediated effect of endogenously released noradrenaline and the requirement of sympathetic nerves for part of the beta-adrenoceptor mediated effect. Atropine and physostigmine influenced the basal contractile activity in a way suggesting that endogenous cholinergic tone existed in the isolated colon preparation. Furthermore, atropine shifted the concentration-effect curves for isoprenaline and terbutaline in a way suggesting that this tonus exerts functional antagonism for the beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. The efficacy of prenalterol was increased by atropine and was markedly reduced by extremely low concentrations of carbachol and bethanechol. This reveals that functional antagonism may be exerted at more than one effector level in the colon wall. Furthermore, it indicates that the nerves responsible for the propagation of the inhibitory effect to beta-adrenoceptor stimulation in the nervous plexa are not of the cholinergic type. It is concluded that the beta 1-adrenoceptor mediates the inhibitory sympathetic effect mainly in nervous plexa of the colon, whereas the beta 2-adrenoceptor mediates this effect at the smooth muscle cells.", 
    "16": "In 1973 the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute organized the Coronary Artery Surgery Study (CASS) including a patient registry and a randomized trial designed to compare medical and surgical therapy in patients with coronary artery disease. This study is discussed in detail and compared with two further large randomized trials of coronary artery bypass surgery, the US Veterans Administration Trial (VA) and the European Cooperative Surgical Study (ECSS). Although there are many differences between these three studies, their similarities warrant some conclusions on the improvement of survival in certain high risk patients, protection against myocardial infarction, the deterioration of graft patency, and the postponement of surgery in low risk patients.", 
    "17": "The ability of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs to prevent death in patients after myocardial infarction has been demonstrated by several large trials. However, the need to treat patients at low risk has been challenged. Retrospective analysis of the data from one of these studies plus results from many additional studies have shown that electrical, mechanical and ischemic complications after myocardial infarction imply a high risk of subsequent death or recurrent infarction. On the other hand, absence of complications with a negative exercise tolerance test, good exercise tolerance, absence of arrhythmias and normal increase of ejection fraction with exercise documents a very low risk. These considerations lead to the following practical implications: The physician should watch for any evidence of left ventricular dysfunction or arrhythmia. Any such complication justifies treatment or more intensive study. Patients without complications can be further characterized with exercise testing, exercise radionuclide blood pool ventriculography, and Holter monitoring. If these tests expose risk indicators, treatment or more study should again be recommended. Because the beta-blockers are probably life-saving in a considerable portion of the patients with moderate and high risk, the decision to treat or not to treat should be made with due, affirmative consideration. In those patients with a carefully documented uncomplicated course and who have a normal exercise test and appropriate increase in ventricular ejection fraction with stress, beta-blockade is probably of no benefit. Under these conditions, a physician and patient might logically decide not to use the drug.", 
    "18": "The European Infarction Study (EIS) was a multicentre, double-blind, randomized study comparing the effect on survival, cardiac mortality and non-fatal cardiac events of oxprenolol slow release 160 mg b.i.d. with placebo in 1,741 patients aged 35 to 69 years surviving acute myocardial infarction. During the one year follow-up there was a 30% difference in the cumulative mortality rate in favor of placebo. In the oxprenolol group the mortality was noted to be higher in patients who were 65-69 years of age. In general, there was a higher incidence of fatal reinfarctions and of sudden death in those, who discontinued study medication. 24-hour ECG recordings before randomization in 736 patients revealed a high prevalence of complex ventricular tachydysrhythmias. These patients had a significantly higher one-year mortality. Like other beta-blocking drugs oxprenolol had a weak suppressant effect on ventricular tachydysrhythmias in infarct survivors. The proportion of deaths was noted to be higher in the oxprenolol group to the same relative degree in patients with or without complex tachydysrhythmias. Reviewing the results of other beta-blocker post infarction trials it is concluded that a protective effect on sudden death in myocardial infarction survivors is related to beta-blockade. Beta-blocking drugs with significant intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, which partly counteracts beta-blockade, might be less effective. High dose oxprenolol treatment might be deleterious to some patients with more enhanced coronary heart disease.", 
    "19": "The preventive effect of long-term beta-blocker therapy in patients who have survived the acute phase of myocardial infarction has been examined in several controlled clinical trials. The largest, the Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial, has convincingly demonstrated that propranolol in a daily dose of 180 to 240 mg given to patients without absolute or relative contraindications to the drug, prolongs life while producing moderate side effects. The predominant benefit appears to be in the first 12-18 months. The prime candidates for treatment seem to be patients at high risk, i.e. with complicated infarctions or complex arrhythmias. The likely mechanisms of action are anti-arrhythmic and anti-ischemic. Beta-2 blockade may be a contributing factor.", 
    "20": "Elemental distribution and ultrastructure of the submandibular gland, the parotid gland and the pancreas were investigated in three suggested animal models of the disease cystic fibrosis: the chronically reserpinized rat, the chronically isoproterenol-treated rat, and the chronically pilocarpine-treated rat. To elucidate the cellular mechanism underlying the effects of these treatments, chronic effects of specific alpha - and beta -adrenergic agonists, as well as acute effects of reserpine and various agonists were also investigated. Reserpine, isoproterenol, and pilocarpine cause an increase in the calcium concentration in submandibular gland acinar cells, due to an increased calcium content of the intracellular mucus. In the parotid gland, reserpine and isoproterenol cause a decrease of the calcium concentration in acinar cells, due to a lower calcium content of the zymogen granules. In the submandibular gland, a decreased cellular Na concentration was noted after chronic treatment with isoproterenol or pilocarpine, and after a single dose of reserpine or isoproterenol. Ultrastructural changes in the exocrine glands investigated included excessive accumulation of intracellular secretory material and formation of abnormal uncondensed secretion granules. A common pattern in the 'animal models' appears to be (1) inhibition of secretion resulting in intracellular accumulation of secretory material, (2) synthesis of secretory macromolecules with altered cation-binding properties.", 
    "21": "The QT interval is a function of ventricular repolarization time and is measured from the onset of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave. The length of this interval is inversely related to heart rate. A prolonged QT interval is most often secondary to the use of Type I antidysrhythmic medications (quinidine, procainamide). It is also associated with phenothiazines, organophosphates, hypocalcemia, liquid protein diets and the congenital long QT syndromes. QT prolongation is associated with a variety of ventricular dysrhythmias, most characteristically Torsades des pointes. Treatment consists of correction of the underlying metabolic disorder or discontinuation of the offending medication.", 
    "22": "Treatment of 66 hypertensive patients with three different beta-blockers (atenolol 100 mg once a day; oxprenolol 80 mg twice a day; nadolol 80 mg once a day) for six months resulted in a significant reduction in blood pressure and heart rate, the maximum with nadolol, a significant amelioration in pre-ejection period/left ventricular ejection time ratio expressing the haemodynamic performance of the left ventricle with atenolol and nadolol, and a significant reduction left ventricular hypertrophy as expressed by the Romhilt-Estes index with all three drugs, but especially with nadolol.", 
    "23": "A Doppler technique has been used in three separate studies to measure the changes induced by increasing infusion rates of isoprenaline on blood velocity, blood flow and diameters in the femoral and posterior tibial arteries of normal volunteers and to investigate the effects of various B-adrenoceptor antagonists on these changes. Heart rate and blood pressures were also recorded. Isoprenaline produced the expected changes in heart rates and blood pressures in the volunteers and changes induced in these responses by the B-adrenoceptor antagonist were as seen by previous workers. The only expected finding was that systolic blood pressure at the ankle was decreased compared to that in the arm which was increased. Isoprenaline produced reproducible dose-dependent increases in blood velocity, blood flow and diameters in the femoral artery, but little or no effects in the posterior tibial artery. These differences may reflect the difference in distribution of these arteries, the femoral to large muscular beds and the posterior tibial artery essentially to skin vascular beds. The different effects of the B-adrenoceptor blocking drugs with different actions on B1- and B2-adrenoceptors on the responses of the Doppler measurements to isoprenaline would support the differences in distribution of the femoral and posterior tibial arteries and allow a conclusion that the muscle vascular beds contain essentially B2-adrenoceptors with respect to stimulation by isoprenaline. The results obtained in three separate studies using the Doppler technique do suggest that this non-invasive technique may be of value in investigating the physiology, and/or pharmacology of the peripheral circulation in man.", 
    "24": "We report the first placebo controlled parallel group study of once daily endralazine (5-20 mg) in hypertension uncontrolled by a beta-blocker plus a diuretic. Following a 4-week run-in period 22 patients with a sitting mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 110 mm Hg were entered into the study and received either endralazine 5 mg or placebo. Blood pressure was measured 2 h and 24 h after dosing and the drug dose doubled at 2 and 4 weeks if the 24-h MAP remained greater than 110 mg Hg. The final blood pressure assessment was made after 6 weeks treatment in the 19 patients who completed the study. Three patients withdrew from the study because of side effects. The hypotensive effect (sitting) was in excess of placebo at 2 h by 15.8 mm Hg systolic (NS), 15.4 mm Hg diastolic (p less than 0.01), 15.5 mm Hg MAP (p less than 0.02) and at 24 hours by 7.7 mm Hg systolic (NS), 8.9 mm Hg diastolic (p less than 0.02) and 11.1 mm Hg MAP (p less than 0.02). This study suggests that endralazine should be prescribed twice daily.", 
    "25": "Five patients with mild hypertension were given single oral doses of Ro 31-1118 (10,20,40, and 80 mg) and placebo in a randomized, double-blind, within-patient study. Plasma concentrations of Ro 31-1118 and supine, standing, exercise, and post-exercise heart rates and blood pressures were measured before and at regular intervals after drug administration. The pharmacokinetic data were consistent with a one-compartment model with first-order absorption and a variable time lag. Peak plasma concentrations and area under curve were linearly related to dose, whereas time to peak concentration, half-time, clearance and apparent volume of distribution were dose-independent. There was a reduction in exercise and post-exercise heart rate of approximately 10% after 10 mg and 20 mg Ro 31-1118, and of approximately 15% after 40 mg and 80 mg. At all doses standing systolic blood pressure was reduced by approximately 5%. A similar fall was seen in exercise and post-exercise systolic blood pressures. There was no substantial effect of Ro 31-1118 on supine or standing heart rates nor on diastolic blood pressure. No adverse effects were reported. It is concluded that Ro 31-1118 has linear pharmacokinetics over the dose range 10-80 mg, and has a weak antihypertensive effect when administered in single doses to patients with mild hypertension.", 
    "26": "The exercise test response and exercise capacity of patients with atherosclerotic coronary heart disease may be significantly altered by a number of commonly used cardiovascular drugs, alone or in combination, via complex interactions of hemodynamic and electrophysiologic changes. The clinician must assess the effects of pharmacotherapy when evaluating the results of exercise testing as well as when prescribing a rehabilitative exercise training regimen.", 
    "27": "In this investigation it could be shown that the intracellular alterations of cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) caused by the beta-receptor blocker (2R,3S)-5-(3-tert-butylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy)-1,2,3,4- -tetrahydro-2,3-naphtalenediol (nadolol, Solgol mite) can also be proved in plasma. 15 hypertensive patients were given 60 mg nadolol; before and after certain intervals plasma cAMP, blood pressure, heart rate and pulmonary function were measured. After a single dose of nadolol within 8 h a prompt, significant decrease of the plasma cAMP concentration from 21.3 pmol/ml to 8.1 pmol/ml could be seen. 8 h later the cAMP concentration increased slowly and after 32 h achieved an average value of 13.1 pmol/ml. Heart rate and systolic blood pressure of the patients showed nearly identical behavior for more than 32 h. Both parameters fell significantly, increased slowly after 8 h and were still on a lower level after 32 h. There was no influence on diastolic blood pressure value and pulmonary function. The results confirm--in accordance with other investigators--the long therapeutical effect of the beta-receptor blocker nadolol; besides they prove that the model used here is a suitable biochemical equivalent in comparison to the pharmacological effect of a beta-receptor blocker.", 
    "28": "It is somewhat difficult to reconcile the contrasting findings regarding the hemodynamic actions of high doses of corticosteroids in shock. The studies differ according to type of shock (hypovolemic, septic or cardiogenic), animal species, shock model, type of corticosteroid, etc. Beneficial hemodynamic effects (e.g. myocardial improvement, vasodilation) of steroids given alone are not consistently observed and when so often mild and transient. This might indicate that the hemodynamic changes of corticosteroids are not due to primary actions on the cardiovascular system but rather represent the hemodynamic consequences of the metabolic response to corticosteroid therapy. If, however, the corticosteroid therapy is combined with an alpha-adrenoreceptor blocker the nutritive tissue blood flow is distinctly increased.", 
    "29": "A review is given on age-dependent changes in drug sensitivity, absorption, distribution, hepatic and renal elimination of drugs with special reference to the use of cardiac glycosides, betablockers, antiarrhythmics, diuretics and hypotensive drugs in the elderly.", 
    "30": "Reduction in arterial blood pressure caused by ACE inhibitors, calcium antagonists and beta-blockers leads to regression of heart muscle hypertrophy. However, this regression may also occur in the absence of a significant reduction in blood pressure (alpha-Methyldopa), whereas no decrease in heart muscle mass may be observed in the presence of pronounced decreases in blood pressure (hydralazine, minoxidil, diuretics). In the present review, biochemical factors are analyzed that might be important in the regression of heart muscle hypertrophy. It will be seen that angiotensin II and cardiac catecholamines play important roles in modifying the influence of various drugs on regression of heart muscle hypertrophy. Reductions in angiotensin II and cardiac catecholamines lead to decreases in cardiac mRNA contents and thus to a decrease in the myocardial protein synthesis. Changes in myocardial protein degradation do not contribute to the regression of heart muscle hypertrophy.", 
    "31": "The antihypertensive effect of the preparation celiprolol was studied in a double blind experiment versus acebutolol in 60 patients (30 males and 30 females), with an average age 40 years. Only patients with hypertonic diseases, stage I-II, according to WHO classification were included in the study. The treatment Lasted 4 weeks. The criteria for a good effect were the normalization of the blood pressure and the absence of adverse effects. There was no statistically significant difference between the percentages of the reduced blood pressure, attained by both preparations. By the end of 4th week, 56.7 per cent of the treated with celiprolol were with normalized blood pressure, and 46,7 per cent--with acebutolol. The following adverse effects were observed: light gastrointestinal manifestations, weakness, dizziness, tremor, impotence. In some of the patients those effects were transitory but in 4 patients, treated with acebutolol, the treatment was discontinued because of the adverse effects.", 
    "32": "The effects of the autonomic antagonists on urethral activity was studied in female dogs. Urethral responses produced by autonomic nerve stimulation were measured with pressure and motility changes in control conditions and after administration of autonomic antagonists. Phentolamine and guanethidine reduced both hypogastric and pelvic nerve mediated responses. It seems that urethral smooth muscle function is greatly influenced by adrenergic drugs.", 
    "33": "Injection of prostaglandin (PG) F-2 alpha or its analogues has provided a technique to induce parturition after Day 110 of gestation in the sow. The mean interval from PG injection to parturition ranges from 24 to 28 h, but only 50-60% of the sows farrow during an 8-10 h working day, and as many as 20% of sows may begin parturition before the injection of PG or less than 22 h after the injection. The duration of parturition is positively associated with the incidence of stillbirths and perinatal death so that techniques to reduce the duration of parturition may save piglets. Early parturition has been prevented by feeding sows progestagens, PG synthesis inhibitors and hypothalamic function inhibitors. These compounds were detrimental to piglet survival if they delayed parturition too long after the expected time of parturition. Parturition was delayed in sows up to 1.5 days by altrenogest, 1.6 days by meclofenamic acid, 2.7 days by indomethacin, and 3 days by methallibure without increased incidence of stillborn piglets compared with control sows. Injection of PG after administration of altrenogest or meclofenamic acid was successful in experiments with sows; parturition could be confined to a 5-day working week with no increase in stillborn piglets compared with control sows. Relaxin injected at 48 and 24 h before or only 24 h before injection of PG increased the proportion of sows farrowing 22-32 h after PG to 86.2% compared with sows injected only with PG (53.3%, P less than 0.01). Oxytocin injected 20 h after injection of PG increased the proportion of sows farrowing 20-28 h after PG to 90.4% compared with sows injected only with PG (49.2%, P less than 0.005). Injection of 25-60 i.u. ACTH on Day 110 of gestation did not shorten the length of gestation, but did decrease the incidence of still born piglets by 0.2 piglets/litter (P less than 0.05). An injection of the beta-adrenergic antagonist, carazolol, during labour before the birth of the first piglet decreased the duration of parturition and the incidence of stillborn piglets particularly in primiparous sows (P less than 0.05). Carazolol injected with oxytocin 20 h after injection of PG decreased the interval from PG to parturition by 2 h compared with sows injected with only PG and oxytocin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "34": "Alpha 1-adrenergic potencies of SM911 and SM2470, whose chemical structures are similar to that of prazosin, a selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocker, were tested in rabbit aortic strips, rat aortic strips and rat vas deferens preparations. SM2470 was as potent as prazosin in alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocking effects, though SM911 was 0.5-0.1 as potent as prazosin. The pA2-values for prazosin, SM911 and SM2470 were approximately one order of magnitude lower in rabbit aortic strips and rat vas deferens preparations than in rat aortic strips, suggesting that alpha 1-adrenoceptors in these tissues may not be identical. SM911 and SM2470 as well as prazosin did not interact with alpha 2- and beta-adrenoceptors, muscarinic and nicotinic cholinoceptors, and histamine and serotonin receptors in doses up to 10(-5) M.", 
    "35": "The paper describes the synthesis and the pharmacological evaluation of some derivatives of betaxolol, all with a N-aralkylamine instead of the tertiobutylamine. Their general formulas are: (Formula: see text). These compounds have been tested for beta 1-adrenergic receptors antagonism on guinea pig atria, beta 2-adrenergic receptor antagonism on guinea pig trachea and alpha-adrenergic blocking activity on rat aorta. Compound U12 with a marked alpha-blocking activity and compound R8 with a beta 1/alpha ratio = 1 were selected for a haemodynamic study in the dog. The decrease in cardiac work and the diminution of total peripheral resistance exhibited by U12 are consistent with a dual alpha/beta-blocking agent. Finally, structure-activity relationships are discussed.", 
    "36": "In 709 patients with definite acute myocardial infarction (MI) the appearance of raised serum enzyme activity was related to onset of symptoms. Heat stable lactate dehydrogenase (LD), creatine kinase (CK) and CK B were analysed. A gradual increase in the incidence of raised enzyme activity in the first blood sample was seen for up to 18 hours after the onset of MI for all 3 enzymes. The incidence of raised enzyme activity in the first blood sample was higher for CK and CK B than for heat stable LD up to 24 hours after onset of MI, but thereafter a similar incidence was found. The median time between onset of symptoms and estimated appearance of raised serum enzyme activity was 6.2 hours for heat stable LD versus 4.3 hours for CK and 4.1 hours for CK B. A wide variation was however found. Infarct localization and chronic treatment with betablockade might affect these results. The clinical course including short- and long-term survival was similar in patients with early and later appearance of enzymes.", 
    "37": "Standard single doses of nitrates, Ca-antagonists and beta-adrenoblockers were studied and compared in 37 patients presenting with stable angina pectoris of effort by repeated treadmill tests coupled with ECG monitoring. The use of isosorbide dinitrate (10 mg), nifedipin (20 mg) and propranolol (40 mg) enabled the effective drug to be screened in 86% of patients. Eleven per cent more of patients responded to the raising of the drug dosage. Isosorbide dinitrate was found to be the most effective in 27% of cases, nifedipin in 19%, and propranolol in 11%. The effect of 2 to 3 drugs was similar in 40% of patients. The data obtained during the screening of the most effective drug in 13 patients, performed by two different methods (treadmill pharmacodynamic and pair bicycle ergomentry tests showed a good agreement in the majority of cases).", 
    "38": "In the search for improved drugs much attention has been focussed on the need for greater selectivity of action. Knowing that all drugs are poisons, the pharmacologist must attempt to define the required effect more narrowly but remain aware of potential unwanted effects. These may come as a result of the primary pharmacological effect or be due to other properties of the drug molecule manifesting themselves in clinical use. This paper illustrates the process of drug discovery and development with special reference to beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. Starting from the role of noradrenaline in sympathetic transmission, many compounds have been synthesized with therapeutic aims in mind. From a series of bronchodilators, dichloro-isoprenaline emerged which unexpectedly blocked stimulation of beta-receptors. This compound proved unsatisfactory leading to the introduction of the first clinically successful beta-blocker, pronethalol. Concern about potential carcinogenic effects led to its being replaced by propanolol. Failure to recognise the full range of clinical contra-indications resulted in propranolol causing severe cardio-vascular and bronchial adverse reactions. Soon it was recognized that propranolol was a powerful local anaesthetic potentially acting as a myocardial depressant. More serious was the recognition that in certain circumstances high levels of sympathetic tone were an adaptive response to pathophysiological change and that interruption by beta-blockade was inevitably serious for the patient. Attempts to identify the properties responsible for unwanted effects directed attention to comparison with non-local anaesthetic water soluble compounds still retaining beta-blocking activity. One such compound, practolol, also proved to exhibit a higher affinity for beta-receptors in the heart than elsewhere leading to the concept of cardioselective beta-blockade. The pharmacology of this agent is reviewed but it proved to have unacceptable side effects in clinical use. The importance of practolol was to demonstrate that anginal relief was due to beta-blockade and not local anaesthetic activity. It also showed that cardiovascular adverse reactions and bronchospasm were significantly less common than with propranolol. However, in addition to being cardioselective, practolol also showed intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. This resulted in a smaller bradycardia at rest. Contrary to predictions this property did not prevent practolol becoming well accepted by both doctors and patients as an effective anti-anginal drug. It was the unrelated skin, eye and mucous membrane reactions which led to the compound being withdrawn.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "39": "The adenylate cyclase complex is a ubiquitous 'second-messenger' system mediating the actions of hormones and neurotransmitters. Its presence but not its physiological control and function had previously been established in the cochlea. In this study, the hormonal stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity of the stria vascularis of the CBA mouse was characterized. In the presence of the regulatory nucleotide, GTP, the enzyme was stimulated by isoproterenol and epinephrine with a half-maximal effect at about 10 microM and the stimulation was blocked by propranolol. This profile is consistent with the presence of adrenergic beta 2-receptors on the strial enzyme complex. Hormones and neuromodulators preferring other receptor subtypes were ineffective; the non-specific stimulator, forskolin, activated the enzyme. The finding that potential hormonal effectors of water and ion transport including vasopressin were inactive may be significant with regard to the physiological role of strial adenylate cyclase.", 
    "40": "Airways resistance and expiratory flow have been investigated in 6 healthy volunteers given single doses of indenolol, propranolol, atenolol and placebo in a randomized, double-blind, cross over study. The three active drugs significantly decreased the effort-induced rise in systolic pressure, and they also reduced the resting heart rate. The relative potency against exercise-tachicardia was propranolol greater than atenolol greater than indenolol. The double and triple product were significantly decreased, too, without any difference between the active treatments. After placebo or indenolol, an exercise-induced increase in the forced expiratory flow at low pulmonary volumes (MEF50 and MEF75) was observed. The two control beta-blockers caused a fall in exercise expiratory flow as compared to the resting values. The noncardioselective agent (propranolol) was more effective than the cardioselective compound (atenolol) in decreasing the expiratory flow. The mechanism of action of indenolol is discussed in the light of the lack of its acute effect on airways resistance.", 
    "41": "14 male hypertensive patients, mean age 53 years first took part in a 3 month, double-blind crossover comparison of 1-2 mg bopindolol, a nonselective beta-blocker with ISA, and 100-200 mg metoprolol. Effects on blood pressure and heart rate were followed. One patient dropped out after the initial phase and the remaining 13 patients were followed for 1 year on bopindolol. 8 patients measured blood pressure at home, and in them bopindolol 1 mg o.d. and 8 mg once weekly were compared in a double-blind fashion, for 3 weeks on each regimen. Finally, after 1 year on bopindolol, treatment was withdrawn and blood pressure and heart rate were followed in 10 of the initial patients. Bopindolol in a mean dose of 1.35 mg/day caused a significant reduction in blood in pressure (26/15 mmHg), as did metoprolol (24/13 mmHg) in a mean dose of 144 mg/day. No significant difference in antihypertensive response was observed. Supine and standing heart rate were reduced both during bopindolol and metoprolol treatment. During long-term therapy with bopindolol, satisfactory blood pressure control was maintained up to 1 year in all patients, the average supine blood pressure being reduced from 173/107 to 144/90 mmHg. During treatment with bopindolol 8 mg once weekly, the blood pressure control was satisfactorily maintained over the week and no significant difference was observed in comparison with daily administration (1 mg) of the drug. When active treatment was withdrawn, a gradual increase in blood pressure and heart rate was observed, the pretreatment values being reached 8 weeks after discontinuation of bopindolol therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "42": "Twenty-six ambulant elderly patients (age range 62 to 78 years) whose blood pressure control was inadequate with either beta-blocker or diuretic monotherapy were studied in a randomized, prospective double-blind comparison of atenolol (50 mg), amiloride (5 mg) with hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg), and these two treatments combined. Blood pressures were measured at least 24 hours after a single daily dose. The combined therapy was more effective in reducing lying (p less than 0.01) and standing (p less than 0.05) systolic blood pressure than either beta-blocker or diuretic alone. Combined therapy was more effective than diuretic on lying (p less than 0.05) or standing blood pressure (p less than 0.01). There was little difference in blood pressure control between beta-blocker and diuretic therapy. Side-effect complaints were similar on beta-blocker (5 complaints) and diuretic (7) and appeared to be additive on combined treatment (12). Diuretic treatment alone or in combination after the 1-month randomized periods produced shifts in some biochemical parameters (creatinine, urea, urate, sodium) in this older population of treated hypertensives, but clinically significant alteration in serum potassium levels was not seen.", 
    "43": "The effects of alpha- and beta-adrenergic drugs on catecholamine- and theophylline-induced lipolysis were studied in isolated adipocytes of hamsters, mice, guinea-pigs, gerbils and cats. The ability of the beta-blocker propranolol to diminish the lipolytic rate indicates the presence of beta-adrenergic receptors. Lipolysis was also decreased by the alpha-agonists clonidine and phenylephrine, suggesting the existence of alpha-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "44": "Whether the positive inotropic effect of isoproterenol in ventricular strips of carp heart is altered by previous exposure to the agonist was studied. Isoproterenol produced a concentration-dependent positive inotropic effect in these preparations which was competitively antagonized by propranolol. Isoproterenol dose-response curves were shifted significantly downward and to the right after previous treatment with and removal of isoproterenol. The desensitization could be demonstrated after 5 min incubation and near maximal desensitization was observed after 30 min exposure to 1000 nM isoproterenol. The responsiveness was only partially recovered after 180 min incubation in drug-free medium. Isoproterenol produces a rapidly developing desensitization to inotropic effects of the beta-adrenergic agonist. This phenomenon may be mediated by alterations in beta-adrenergic receptors, adenylate cyclase and/or the beta receptor-adenylate cyclase coupling mechanism.", 
    "45": "The management of common medical problems in pregnancy often requires adjustments in drug therapy to assure a healthy fetus. The management of steroid-dependent bronchial asthma in pregnancy requires oxygen supplementation as well as vigorous treatment of airway obstruction to protect the fetus from maternal hypoxemia. The hypertensive pregnant patient should discontinue dietary sodium restriction and diuretic therapy and should be managed with alphmethyldopa or beta-blocker therapy. Hydralazine may be added if hypertension is severe. Mitral valve prolapse appears to produce no difficulties during pregnancy and the use of prophylactic antibiotics is probably not necessary for routine vaginal delivery, unless complications occur. Digoxin and quinidine are safe to use in pregnancy, provided careful monitoring is maintained. Oral anticoagulants are contraindicated in pregnancy and should be replaced with heparin if pregnancy is desired.", 
    "46": "Results of recent clinical trials on secondary prevention of ischemic heart disease indicate that judicious, long-term administration of adrenergic beta blockers and platelet-active drugs such as aspirin and Persantine (dipyridamole) would seem to yield protection against mortality associated with acute myocardial infarction, including sudden death. These drugs are beneficial also in prevention of recurrent myocardial infarction, especially among patients with unstable angina. These drugs should be considered as soon as the diagnosis of myocardial infarction or unstable angina is confirmed clinically. In terms of primary prevention of ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease (stroke), the results of the Hypertension Detection and Follow-Up Program provide an excellent set of data on the efficacy of rigorous treatment of hypertension, especially those with mild hypertension. To be effective, treatment must start before there is evidence of target end organ damage, such as left ventricular hypertrophy. Recent data from the Australian Therapeutic Trial in Mild Hypertension also confirms these findings.", 
    "47": "Major advances have taken place in recent years with respect to our understanding of hypertensive diseases, the mechanisms of action of other therapeutic agents, and the introduction of new classes of drugs. Standard therapy today uses the basic of employing nonpharmacological modalities. Thereafter a stepped-care program with pharmacological entities has been advocated using diuretic, antiadrenergic, and vasodilating agents. However, new modes of action have been introduced therapeutically during these years through inhibition of heretofore unexplored pressor mechanisms; some may be used monotherapeutically. Just precisely how the beta-adrenergic blocking drugs reduce arterial pressure still remains to be elucidated. We do not fully understand why the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors work in patients with hypertension who do not have high (or even suppressed) plasma renin activity, but they are effective. Clinical studies directed toward these questions as well as toward other new classes of antihypertensive agents (including how the calcium ion affects vascular smooth muscle contractility) should provide continued enlightenment as to the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of essential hypertension. Moreover, knowledge of newer compounds that possess unique mechanisms of action should stimulate new thinking about this enigmatic disease of blood pressure regulation that we term 'essential hypertension' as well as more specific control of arterial pressure in this ubiquitous disease.", 
    "48": "A number of conventional and newer antiarrhythmic agents are available for the treatment and prophylaxis of ventricular tachycardia and sudden death. Using a multifaceted approach of programmed electrical stimulation studies, drug level determinations, exercise tolerance testing, and 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, the physician can identify those patients who require therapy and then predict the likelihood of efficacy with each antiarrhythmic agent. This approach affords evaluation of both aspects of the sudden death equation-ectopy frequency (triggering mechanism) and vulnerability to development of sustained ventricular tachycardia (substrate). After institution of therapy, careful follow-up is necessary to document sustained drug efficacy and detect side effects. Serious adverse reactions necessitate a change in antiarrhythmic therapy, as opposed to lowering drug dosage to an ineffective level. The unacceptably high incidence of sudden death due to electrical instability can be reversed only by a rigorous and dedicated long-term approach to the management of serious ventricular arrhythmias.", 
    "49": "At present nitrates remain the initial treatment for relief or prevention of angina in patients with coronary artery disease. In cases where nitrates and beta blockers have been used and are ineffective for managing effort angina, calcium antagonists may be substituted or added to the beta-blocking treatment. When the predominant symptom is rest angina, and there is evidence suggesting coronary artery spasm, nitrates and a calcium antagonist can be effective therapy. In patients with heart block, bradyarrhythmias, heart failure, or hypertension nifedipine may be the drug of choice. In contrast verapamil merits choice when supraventricular tachycardia is present. Diltiazem appears intermediate between nifedipine and verapamil and may be particularly useful when hypotension or other side effects must be avoided.", 
    "50": "beta-Adrenergic blockade represents a major pharmacologic advance. These drugs bind to membrane adrenergic receptors interfering with the effects of endogenous catecholamines. Eight beta-blockers are available in the United States, and others are being studied. The drugs have varying pharmacodynamic properties that may modify certain side effects: beta 1-selectivity, partial agonism, alpha-adrenergic blocking activity, membrane stabilization, and varying pharmacokinetic characteristics. The drugs have been shown to be relatively safe and useful for a wide variety of cardiovascular and noncardiovascular disease states, and their wide spectrum of therapeutic activity illustrates the importance of the sympathetic nervous system in the pathophysiology of medical illness.",

There is little doubt that most physicians continue to believe these drugs are useful. The application of more definite indications, smaller doses, and the recognition of the role of pharmacokinetics and drug interactions make use of the glycosides more challenging than ever before in 1985.", 
    "52": "Five beta-blockers (propranolol, metoprolol, oxprenolol, pindolol, and sotalol) were tested for their in vivo DNA-damaging activity by two different techniques: alkaline denaturation of DNA followed by hydroxylapatite chromatography, and a new viscometric method markedly more sensitive in detecting DNA fragmentation. DNA damage, as checked by the first technique, was absent either in liver and kidney of mice or in liver and gastric mucosa of rats given a single p.o. administration of 1/2 LD50 of the drugs. The subsequent viscometric analysis of liver DNA from rats treated with the same doses confirmed the above negative results.", 
    "53": "Nine healthy volunteers received single oral doses of the following four beta-adrenergic blocking agents: propranolol (160 mg), metoprolol (100 mg), atenolol (200 mg), and sotalol (320 mg). The kinetics of each drug were determined from multiple serum concentrations measured during 24-48 h after each dose, and in vitro lipid solubility determined using the liquid chromatographic (HPLC) retention index. Oral clearance for the four drugs ranged from 40.2 ml/min/kg for propranolol down to 2.1 for sotalol. Oral clearance was highly correlated (r = 0.99) with in vitro lipid solubility, with propranolol being the most lipophilic drug and sotalol the least. Thus lipophilicity is a physicochemical property of beta-adrenergic blockers that appears to influence their intrinsic clearance after oral dosage.", 
    "54": "Our recent studies indicated that there was a good therapeutic effect selecting acupoints \"Renzhong (Du26 =G.V. 26)\" \"Chengjiang (Ren. 24=C.V.24) of electro-acupuncture (E-A) in the treatment of allergic shock induced by bovine serum in mice. Phentolamine or propranolol injection before needling could partially reverse this anti-allergic shock effect, while practolol had no influence on the effect of E-A in the treatment. Another series of experiments showed that the E-A anti-allergic shock effect could not be blocked by Naloxone or previous exhaustion of pituitary endorphins, thus suggesting that there might be a difference between mechanisms underlying the analgesic effect and those underlying the anti-allergic shock effect of acupuncture.", 
    "55": "The tremorogenic effect of nicotine was studied in control rats and in rats withdrawn for 16-48 h from six to nine days' ethanol administration. The frequency and the intensity of tremor were measured electronically. A single dose of nicotine 5 mg/kg caused shortlasting (2-3 min) convulsions within 1 min after injection in control rats. Tremor occurred first after five repeated injections of nicotine (5 mg/kg) at half-hour intervals. This tremor encompassed peak frequencies of 6, 10 and 15 Hz. Hexamethonium at a dose of 10 mg/kg did not inhibit the tremor but eliminated the highest peak frequency (15 Hz) and tended to increase the intensity. Propranolol 5 mg/kg completely abolished the nicotine-induced tremor in control rats. Rats withdrawn from repeated ethanol administration showed a marked hypersensitivity to the tremorogenic action of nicotine so that a single dose of 1 mg/kg of nicotine caused clear tremor. The frequency spectra of this tremor showed peak frequencies at 6, 10 and 12 Hz. Hexamethonium did not change these frequencies. Furthermore, it tended to increase the intensity of nicotine-induced tremor in ethanol-withdrawn rats. Propranolol did not inhibit the tremor although it eliminated the 12 Hz peak frequency. The results suggest that the hypersensitivity to the tremorogenic action of nicotine in ethanol-withdrawn rats is not mediated by a sympathetic beta-adrenergic mechanism.", 
    "56": "The highly specific beta-adrenoceptor radioligand (-)-125I-iodopindolol (IPIN) was used to label in membranes from human platelets beta-adrenoceptors. Binding of IPIN was at 25 degrees C saturable (Bmax = 7.4 +/- 2.5 fmoles bound/mg protein, N = 10) of high affinity (KD-value = 34.8 +/- 3.3 pM, N = 10), rapid and reversible. beta-Adrenoceptor antagonists inhibited binding of IPIN with monophasic displacement curves and pseudo Hill coefficients (nH) not significantly different from 1.0. The beta 2-selective antagonist ICI 118,551 was much more potent in inhibiting IPIN binding than the beta 1-selective antagonist bisoprolol. IPIN binding was stereospecific as indicated by the 100-times greater potencies of (-)-alprenolol and (-)-isoprenaline in inhibiting binding than their (+)-isomers. beta-Adrenoceptor agonists inhibited binding with slightly shallow displacement curves and nH-values of 0.85-0.88; the order of potency was: isoprenaline greater than adrenaline greater than noradrenaline. These results demonstrate that IPIN labels (in human platelet membranes with high affinity) a homogeneous population of beta 2-adrenoceptors with low capacity.", 
    "57": "The effects of bucindolol a new nonselective beta blocker were studied after short-term dosing and for up to six months in eight patients with essential hypertension. Bucindolol 100 mg acutely lowered supine and erect systolic and diastolic pressure without orthostatic features and without increases or decreases in heart rate. Plasma noradrenaline increased, but plasma renin activity fell. Long-term dosing of 100-400 mg/day led to modest decreases in blood pressure. The duration of the hypotensive effect after multiple dosing ranged from six to ten hours. After long-term dosing there was evidence of marked nonselective beta blockade but not of alpha 1 blockade from the responses to intravenous isoprenaline and phenylephrine respectively. In six out of eight patients the plasma creatinine phosphokinase rose transiently above the normal range. The increase appeared to be of muscle origin and was associated with myalgia in one patient. Bucindolol is a nonselective beta blocker, possibly with other vasodilator properties. These do not appear to be mediated by alpha blockade.", 
    "58": "Calcium antagonists are the latest addition to the antihypertensive armamentarium. The evidence available suggests that they lower blood pressure at least as effectively as diuretics, beta-receptor blockers and other vasodilators. Nifedipine is as effective as hydralazine as a third-line drug. Both nifedipine and verapamil may be used alone as first-line therapy, but they are more expensive and probably cause more symptomatic side-effects than diuretics or beta-receptor blockers.", 
    "59": "To study the role played by neurotransmitters and their receptor mechanisms in the control of feeding behavior elicited by electrical stimulation, drugs that affect neurotransmission were injected via cannula electrodes into the lateral hypothalamic area. Pretreatment with noradrenaline (0.5 and 1.0 nmol) significantly increased the effect of hypothalamic stimulation on feeding, whereas injection of 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 nmol of adrenaline or dopamine was ineffective. Phentolamine (40.0, 80.0 and 100.0 nmol) and propranolol (40.0, 80.0 and 120.0 nmol) induced a decrease in food intake, suggesting the involvement of both alpha and beta receptors in this mechanism. However, isoprenaline (20.0 nmol) also reduced food intake. Reduction of food intake by propranolol was probably related to the action of the local anesthetic. Alphamethyl-p-tyrosine (203.0 nmol), reserpine (32.8 nmol) and 6-hydroxydopamine (200.0 nmol) inhibited the feeding behavior elicited by electrical stimulation of the lateral hypothalamic area. These results suggest that electrical stimulation of the lateral hypothalamic area elicits feeding behavior by releasing noradrenaline. Alpha-adrenergic receptors seem to play a facilitatory role in feeding behavior.", 
    "60": "The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether beta blockade presents a risk of intermittent claudication and how it affects the walking capacity and lower limb haemodynamics in patients with intermittent claudication. The study was divided into six parts: A case-control study with 55 pairs, cases with hypertension and intermittent claudication and controls with hypertension only, matched for age, sex, place of residence, and time of examination, all without coronary heart disease, which is a known confounding factor. An open controlled study on the effect of withdrawal of beta blockade on walking capacity of 28 patients with intermittent claudication. A placebo-controlled double-blind crossover study on the effect of antihypertensive treatment on the walking capacity of 14 patients with intermittent claudication. Three placebo-controlled double-blind crossover studies on the effect of propranolol, metoprolol, pindolol, labetalol, and/or methyldopa on calf blood flow in 34 hypertensive subjects without peripheral arterial disease and in altogether 21 patients with intermittent claudication. Walking capacity was measured on a treadmill. Calf blood flow was measured with strain gauge plethysmography by the venous occlusion technique. The case-control comparison showed that beta blockers were used as often by patients with intermittent claudication as by controls. Walking capacity increased during the first month of the open controlled study irrespective of whether the beta blockade was withdrawn or continued. There was no difference in this respect between the various types of beta blockers. Antihypertensive treatment with metoprolol or methyldopa did not affect walking capacity. Resting calf blood flow was unaffected by propranolol or metoprolol, regardless of the presence or absence of peripheral arterial disease, as well as by pindolol, labetalol, or methyldopa in patients with intermittent claudication. During reactive hyperaemia, propranolol and metoprolol reduced flow in patients without peripheral arterial disease. Propranolol also reduced hyperaemic blood flow in the limb with less or no symptoms in patients with intermittent claudication. None of the active drugs decreased the hyperaemic flow consistently in the limb with the stronger symptoms. In a comparison of haemodynamic effects between the drugs, calf blood flow at rest was higher after pindolol than after propranolol and hyperaemic flow of the better limb was higher after pindolol than after propranolol and labetalol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "61": "Properties of cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors from two kidney-one clip hypertension and control rats were studied to determine whether or not alterations in the receptor contribute to the decreased responsiveness of two kidney-one clip rat hearts to adrenergic stimulation. The number and affinity of the beta-receptors were assessed by the binding of [3H]DHA in an enriched ventricular membrane fraction obtained from the rat hearts 3 and 4 weeks after the application of the clip. In the rats with 3 weeks of development of hypertension no significant difference was found neither in the number nor in the affinity of receptors (30.9 +/- 5.3 fmol/mg protein, KD: 1.62 +/- 0.43 nM) compared to the control rats (33.3 +/- 6.3 fmol/mg protein, KD: 2.21 +/- 0.59 nM). In rats with 4 weeks of development of hypertension, there was an increased number of receptors (54.7 +/- 3.7 fmol/mg protein, KD: 1.41 +/- 0.17 nM) compared with control rats studied in paralleled conditions (40.0 +/- 2.3 fmol/mg protein, KD: 1.13 +/- 0.12 nM). These results suggest that the reported beta-adrenergic subsensitivity in this model of hypertensive rats could be mediated by a biochemical mechanism other than a direct alteration of the beta adrenergic receptors, and that there is a compensatory increase in the density of receptors during the development of the hypertension.", 
    "62": "The safety of medicinal agents being introduced into the marketplace is of growing concern to consumers, health care providers, and regulatory agencies. Although there are ever increasing efforts to improve techniques for testing drugs, and for anticipating and confirming possible adverse effects, arrangements for monitoring and detecting adverse drug reactions are far from satisfactory. Some factors which need to be understood in order to appropriately interpret data include: maturation processes; pretesting affects, measuring instruments affects; selection bias; and the affects of differential experimental mortality. A safety profile has been presented for the calcium entry blocker diltiazem hydrochloride. Efforts were made to focus attention upon the source of safety information as it relates to the quality of the report. The data presented suggests that diltiazem hydrochloride has a low incidence of adverse experiences.", 
    "63": "We used a rat thymic epithelial cell line, IT-45R1, as a differentiation inducer to identify rat bone marrow (BM) pre-T cells. The following observations strongly suggest that BM pre-T cells are relatively small to medium-sized and weakly Thy 1 positive (the amount of Thy 1 is much lower than that of majority of adult thymocytes) lymphoid cells: (1) Fraction (Fr.) 5 cells, separated by bovine serum albumin (BSA) density gradient centrifugation, were induced to express more Thy 1. (2) In a time course study and a study with a beta-stimulator, Fr. 5 cells were almost identical to mouse pre-T cells. (3) Thy 1 expression of Fr. 5 cells appeared to be related to the syntheses of DNA, RNA and protein, being in good agreement with the results of human and mouse pre-T cells. (4) The increase of Thy 1 content by STEL was confirmed in the cell sorter (ABCASS) analysis. (5) ABCASS revealed that Thy 1 content of fetal thymocytes of 18 days' gestation was just between that of BM cells and adult thymocytes, indicating that the increase in Thy 1 content may occur also in vivo.", 
    "64": "The anaesthetic properties of propofol ('Diprivan') have been described previously. This report summarizes additional studies designed to investigate some aspects of the general pharmacology of propofol. Following recovery from anaesthesia with propofol there was no evidence of any central anticholinergic or anticonvulsant effect in mice. An anti-convulsant effect followed thiopentone anaesthesia. In mice anaesthetized with propofol 24 h after the last of 4 daily doses of phenelzine, amitriptyline, diazepam or alcohol, no marked potentiation of anaesthesia was found. Pretreatment with alcohol on the day of anaesthesia potentiated thiopentone but not propofol anaesthesia. Oral doses of propofol up to 300 mg/kg failed to induce anaesthesia in mice. The acute administration of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, atenolol or propranolol was well tolerated during anaesthesia with propofol in pigs. In the cat the arrhythmia threshold to adrenaline was greater than that in cats anaesthetized with halothane and no ganglion blocking or alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist properties were demonstrated. No potent or specific agonist or antagonist properties were detected in the range of in vitro systems examined. Neither propofol nor thiopentone had any effect on ADP-induced platelet aggregation or whole blood clotting time. Bronchomotor tone and gastrointestinal motility were unaffected by propofol. Tests of renal function indicated only a slight reduction in sodium excretion, similar to that seen with thiopentone. A normal corticosterone response to ACTH was seen in rats anaesthetized for 90 min with an infusion of propofol.", 
    "65": "Wistar rats were successively reared in cold at 5 degrees C from 1969 to 1984. The historical changes observed in these rats were reported. The cold-adapted rats reared in cold for 8 to 11 successive generations (C8-11G) were examined on their cold tolerance and non-shivering thermogenesis. C8-11G rats showed greater nonshivering thermogenesis than that of the warm-adapted control group (W), and rats exposed to cold for periods of 2 to 8 weeks (C). The nonshivering thermogenesis of C8-11G rats was diminished to a similar level to that of W and C rats by administration of a ganglion blocker, of reserpine, or of beta-adrenoceptor blocker. The de-adapted rats reared in warm at 25 degrees C for 3 generations after being reared for many generations in cold (DA-3G) showed much more nonshivering thermogenesis as compared to W rats. Cold tolerance of DA-3G rats was at a level of intermediate between that of W and C rats. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) weight of DA-3G rats was similar to that of C rats, while chemical composition of BAT in DA-3G rats differed from that of C and W rats.", 
    "66": "Pituitary glands and hypothalami from broiler fowl heads were incubated alone or together with histamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) or acetylcholine (ACh) as well as with catecholamines or neurotransmitter antagonists. Histamine and ACh stimulated, whereas GABA inhibited, the hypothalamus-induced release of prolactin, responses blocked by their specific antagonists. The dopamine antagonist pimozide, but not adrenergic (both alpha and beta), serotoninergic or cholinergic antagonists, prevented the actions of histamine and GABA. None of the antagonists except the cholinergic blocker, atropine, affected ACh-induced release of prolactin. Neither histamine nor ACh prevented inhibition of prolactin release by dopamine or stimulation of prolactin release by noradrenaline. GABA did not affect the response to noradrenaline. Furthermore, histamine, GABA and ACh had no effects on thyrotrophin releasing hormone-stimulated release of prolactin directly at the pituitary level. These results suggest that histamine and GABA affect prolactin release from chicken pituitaries in vivo by modifying the activity of the dopaminergic system. Acetylcholine may stimulate the secretion of prolactin releasing factor from the hypothalamus.", 
    "67": "The presence of cold sensitivity was investigated in three groups of patients; untreated hypertensives and hypertensives treated by a beta-adrenoceptor blocker (propranolol) or by a combined alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blocker (labetalol) at two ambient temperatures. At a comfortable ambient (24 degrees C) one-third of the untreated and those treated with beta-blockade only showed cold sensitivity as compared with 16% of patients on the combined therapy. Under conditions of mild cold stress (20 degrees C) cold sensitivity increased in frequency in all three groups, more than half of the untreated and beta-blocked patients were affected and greater than one-third of those with alpha- and beta-blockade. These findings indicate that in the general population of hypertensives treatment with beta-adrenoceptor blockade alone may have little effect on the peripheral vasculature and that a useful degree of protection may be provided by therapy which blocks both receptors.", 
    "68": "Visual analogue scales were used in a pilot study to compare side-effects in patients receiving antihypertensive drugs either including or excluding beta-blockers. Compared with symptom scores for patients receiving antihypertensive medication other than a beta-blocker, symptom scores (when combined) for patients receiving a beta-blocker were significantly higher for tired legs (p less than 0.001), cold digits (p less than 0.005), and vivid dreams (p less than 0.01). These methods were also applied in a postal survey which was designed to compare the incidence of symptoms in patients receiving different beta-blockers with symptoms in subjects receiving no drugs. When compared with symptom scores for subjects receiving no drugs, symptom scores (when combined) for patients receiving beta-blockers were significantly higher for tired legs (p less than 0.001), cold digits (p less than 0.01), insomnia (p less than 0.01), and lack of well-being (p less than 0.01). These two studies were consistent in showing higher symptom scores for tired legs and cold digits in patients receiving beta-blockers. However, there were inconsistencies regarding sleep disturbance. Increased dreaming was apparent in the pilot study whereas increased insomnia was apparent from the postal survey. These inconsistencies cannot be explained. No significant differences in side-effects were apparent between different beta-blockers."
