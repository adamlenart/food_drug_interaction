Colonic K(+) secretion follows the pump-leak model, in which the large conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel (KCa1.1) is well established as the sole, but highly regulated apical K(+) conductance. The physiological importance of auxiliary \u03b2 and \u03b3 subunits of the pore-forming \u03b1-subunit of the KCa1.1 channel is not yet fully established. This study investigates colonic K(+) secretion in a global knockout mouse of the KCa1.1-\u03b22-subunit (KCNMB2(-/-)), which apparently is the only \u03b2-subunit of the colonic enterocyte KCa1.1 channel. We can report that: (1) Neither KCa1.1 \u03b1- nor the remaining \u03b2-subunits were compensatory transcriptional regulated in colonic epithelia of KCNMB2(-/-) mice. (2) Colonic epithelia from KCNMB2(-/-) mice displayed equal basal and ATP-induced KCa1.1-mediated K(+) conductance as compared to KCNMB2(+/+) (3) K(+) secretion was increased in KCNMB2(-/-) epithelia compared to wild-type epithelia from animals fed an aldosterone-inducing diet. (4) Importantly, the apical K(+) conductance was abolished by the specific blocker of KCa1.1 channel iberiotoxin in both KCNMB2(+/+) and KCNMB2(-/-) mice. Recently a novel family of auxiliary \u03b3-subunits of the KCa1.1 channel has been described. (5) We detected the \u03b31-subunit (LRRC26) mRNA in colonic epithelia. To investigate the physiological role of the \u03b31-subunit of KCa1.1 channels in colonic K(+) secretion, we acquired an LRRC26 knockout mouse. (6) Unexpectedly, LRRC26 mice had a perinatal lethal phenotype, thus preventing functional measurements. On this basis we conclude that colonic K(+) secretion is intact or even increased in mice lacking the \u03b22-subunit of KCa1.1 channel complex despite no additional compensatory induction of KCa1.1 \u03b2-subunits.",

Areas covered: This review focused on previous studies in managing hypertension, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, heart failure, and perioperative management with sympathetic blockade. We reviewed both pharmacological and non-pharmacological management. Expert commentary: Chronic sympathetic nervous system activation is related to several cardiovascular diseases mediated by various pathways. Advancement in measuring sympathetic activity makes visualizing noninvasively and evaluating the activation level even in single fibers possible. Evidence suggests that sympathetic blockade still has a role in managing hypertension and controlling the heart rate in atrial fibrillation. For ischemic heart disease, beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists have been considered a milestone drug to control symptoms and prevent long-term adverse effects, although its clinical implication has become less potent in the era of successful revascularization. Owing to pathologic involvement of sympathetic nervous system activation in heart failure progression, sympathetic blockade has proved its value in improving the clinical course of patients with heart failure.", 
    "11": "Portal cavernoma is a venous vascular anomaly characterized by the formation of a network of veins whose caliber is increased and carrying portal blood. It is due to a thrombotic and always chronic occlusion of the extra-hepatic portal venous system. This is one of the most common causes of portal hypertension in children. Its severity is mainly associated with an high risk of gastrointestinal haemorrhage. Very few cases have been described mainly in African literature. We report the case of a 4-year old boy admitted with very abundant haematemesis, melena and dizziness associated with anemic syndrome on examination. Laboratory tests showed severe microcytic hypochromic anemia with normal renal and hepatic function. Gastrointestinal endoscopy showed esophageal varices (grade III) with red signs. Abdominal ultrasound showed portal vein formation resulting in the classic \"spiderweb\", in favor of a cavernoma. Abdominal CT scan confirmed portal cavernoma associated with portal hypertensive syndrome and vascular anomaly like an ectopic splenic vein anastomosis with the trunk formed by the gonadal vein and the inferior mesenteric vein. Therapeutic approach was based on blood transfusion and beta-blocker treatment. Portal cavernoma can be a major complication of vascular malformations often unknown. In case of gastrointestinal haemorrhage in children, diagnosis should be suspected. Its management requires early treatment and should be adapted to the patient's condition in order to prevent a fatal evolution.",

    "16": "Background and Purpose: Incidence of cardiovascular disorders increases with age, because of a dramatic fall of endogenous self-defense mechanisms and increased vulnerability of myocardium. Conversely, the effectiveness of many cardioprotective drugs is blunted in hearts of 1 year old rat. The Citrus flavanone naringenin (NAR) was reported to promote cardioprotective effects against ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, through the activation of mitochondrial large conductance calcium-activated potassium channel (mitoBK). These effects were observed in young adult rats, but no data are available about the possible cardioprotective effects of NAR in aged animals. Experimental Approach: This study aimed at evaluating the potential cardioprotective effects of NAR against I/R damage in 1 year old rats, and the possible involvement of mitoBK. Key Results: Naringenin protected the hearts of 1 year old rats in both ex vivo and in vivo I/R protocols. Noteworthy, these effects were antagonized by paxilline, a selective BK-blocker. The cardioprotective effects of NAR were also observed in senescent H9c2 cardiomyoblasts. In isolated mitochondria from hearts of 1 year old, NAR exhibited the typical profile of a mitoBK opener. Finally, Western Blot analysis confirmed a significant (albeit reduced) presence of BK-forming alpha and beta subunits, both in cardiac tissue of 1 year old rats and in senescent H9c2 cells. Conclusion and Implications: This is the first work reporting cardioprotective effects of NAR in 1 year old rats. Although further studies are needed to better understand the whole pathway involved in the NAR-mediated cardioprotection, these preliminary data represent a promising perspective for a rational nutraceutical use of NAR in aging.",

    "22": "Oxaliplatin use as chemotherapeutic agent is frequently limited by cumulative neurotoxicity which may compromise quality of life. Reports relate this neurotoxic effect to oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in peripheral nerves and dorsal root ganglion (DRG). Carvedilol is an antihypertensive drug, has also been appreciated for its antioxidant and mitoprotective properties. Carvedilol co-treatment did not reduce the anti-tumor effects of oxaliplatin in human colon cancer cells (HT-29), but exhibited free radical scavenging activity against oxaliplatin-induced oxidative stress in neuronal cells (Neuro-2a). Hence, the present study was designed to investigate the effect of carvedilol in the experimental model of oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy (OIPN) in Sprague-Dawley rats. Oxaliplatin reduced the sensory nerve conduction velocity and produced the thermal and mechanical nociception. Carvedilol significantly (P<0.001) attenuated these functional and sensorimotor deficits. It also counteracted oxidative/nitrosative stress by reducing the levels of nitrotyrosine and improving the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase expression in both sciatic nerve and DRG tissues. It improved the mitochondrial function and prevented the oxaliplatin-induced alteration in mitochondrial membrane potential in sciatic nerve thus prevented loss of intra epidermal nerve fiber density in the foot pads. Together the results prompt the use of carvedilol along with chemotherapy with oxaliplatin to prevent the peripheral neuropathy.",

However, it is not known whether \u03b2-AR signaling plays any role in the proliferation and differentiation of ventricular cells in the embryonic heart. Here, we characterized expression profiles of \u03b2-AR subtypes and established dose-response curves for the nonselective \u03b2-AR agonist isoproterenol (ISO) in the developing mouse ventricular cells. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of ISO on cell cycle activity and differentiation of cultured E11.5 ventricular cells. ISO treatment significantly reduced tritiated thymidine incorporation and cell proliferation rates in both cardiac progenitor cell and cardiomyocyte populations. The ISO-mediated effects on DNA synthesis could be abolished by cotreatment of E11.5 cultures with either metoprolol (a \u03b21-AR antagonist) or ICI-118,551 (a \u03b22-AR antagonist). In contrast, ISO-mediated effects on cell proliferation could be abolished only by metoprolol. Furthermore, ISO treatment significantly increased the percentage of differentiated cardiomyocytes compared with that in control cultures. Additional experiments revealed that \u03b2-AR stimulation leads to downregulation of Erk and Akt phosphorylation followed by significant decreases in cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 levels in E11.5 ventricular cells. Consistent with in vitro results, we found that chronic stimulation of recipient mice with ISO after intracardiac cell transplantation significantly decreased graft size, whereas metoprolol protected grafts from the inhibitory effects of systemic catecholamines. Collectively, these results underscore the effects of \u03b2-AR signaling in cardiac development as well as graft expansion after cell transplantation.NEW & NOTEWORTHY \u03b2-Adrenergic receptor (\u03b2-AR) stimulation can decrease the proliferation of embryonic ventricular cells in vitro and reduce the graft size after intracardiac cell transplantation. In contrast, \u03b21-AR antagonists can abrogate the antiproliferative effects mediated by \u03b2-AR stimulation and increase graft size.

Eighty-three children admitted to hospital from October 2011 to December 2014 were treated with IV sotalol or IV sotalol plus IV propafenone. The time to conversion to sinus rhythm and maintaining sinus rhythm were evaluated. Blood pressure, heart rate, QTc, PR intervals, and rhythm were monitored; 50 patients (60%) were converted to sinus rhythm with IV sotalol; time to conversion was 12.0 \u00b1 18.0\u00a0hours; 12 additional patients (15%) were converted with IV sotalol combined with IV propafenone; time to conversion was 13.1 \u00b1 17.6\u00a0hours. A total of 62 patients (75%) were converted. Success rates of IV sotalol for different tachycardias were similar, whereas the time to conversion differed. The time to conversion for atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia was shorter than atrial tachycardia or atrial flutter (p <0.05). QTc prolongation (from 253 to 486\u00a0ms and from 398\u00a0ms to 500\u00a0ms) was seen in 2 patients (2%) within 48\u00a0hours after conversion.

A 1\u00a0month old with atrial flutter developed bradycardia (7:1 atrioventricular conduction) 5\u00a0minutes after IV sotalol, and heart rate increased gradually after drug withdrawal. No other adverse effects were observed. In conclusion, IV sotalol can be safely and effectively used to terminate pediatric tachycardias in patients with normal cardiac function. No proarrhythmic or significant toxicities were detected. Close monitoring of QTc and heart rate is required after IV sotalol.

The cells were transfected with recombinant adenoviruses expressing \u03b2-arrestin-2 gene or small-interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting \u03b2-arrestin-2. The unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) model was used in vivo. mRNA and protein levels of \u03b2-arrestin-2, not \u03b2-arrestin-1, were significantly upregulated in the UUO kidney tissues. SII induced the tight binding of \u03b2-arrestin-2 with AT1R. SII increased the synthesis of collagen I and fibronectin in NRK-49F, which were abolished when pretreated with candesartan (AT1R blocker). Transfection of siRNA targeting \u03b2-arrestin-2 decreased the effects of SII on ECM synthesis. Overexpression of \u03b2-arrestin-2 enhanced SII-stimulated ECM synthesis. SII induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in NRK-49F. Transfection of siRNA targeting \u03b2-arrestin-2 inhibited ERK phosphorylation. Overexpression of \u03b2-arrestin-2 increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Our study first showed that AT1R-\u03b2-arrestin-2 pathway signaling plays an important role in renal fibrosis, although it was previously believed that the AT1R-G protein pathway plays a major role. Targeting \u03b2-arrestin-2 may be a potential therapeutic agent for renal fibrosis.",

However, until now it has been evaluated only manually or with simple and inefficient algorithms. In this paper, we developed a new robust single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) T-wave delineation algorithm that is able to detect the T-wave with a wavelet based method and automatically calculate the TWA. We evaluated the algorithm on the QT database, achieving a sensitivity of 99.92% for the T wave peak and 99.38% for the T wave end. In addition, the percentage of records automatically delineated with high precision was higher than previous published works. Finally, the algorithm was applied to study the influence of anticholinergic and antiadrenergic drugs (i.e. atropine and metoprolol) on the TWA. It was observed that atropine significantly decreased the TWA when compared to baseline level, that head-up tilt caused a decrease of TWA and that metoprolol blunted this decrease. Through the development of a robust algorithm, this study opens the way for further research on the T-wave analysis for the assessment of the autonomic innervation of the ventricular myocardium.",

Psychological stress in mice promotes the progression of pancreatic cancer xenografts via stress neurotransmitter-mediated increase in beta-adrenergic signaling and suppression of GABA while stress reduction inhibits pancreatic cancer by reversing these effects. The activation of G\u03b1i-coupled GABAB-receptor signaling by treatment with GABA, inhibition of beta-adrenergic signaling by a beta-blocker and/or suppression of G\u03b1s-coupled PGE2 receptor signaling by a cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor prevent the development and progression of pancreatic cancer induced in hamsters by carcinogenic nitrosamines and in transgenic mice. The re-purposing of cardiovascular therapeutics (beta-blockers, COX-2 inhibitors, Ca2+-channel blockers) that inhibit beta-adrenergic and PGE2 signaling for pancreatic cancer intervention is problematic due to undesirable side effects under chronic treatment protocols. To avoid such side effects while effectively reducing excessive cAMP signaling, nutritional GABA supplementation or positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of G\uf061i-coupled receptors (GABAB-Rs) currently in clinical trials for the treatment of addiction should be explored for pancreatic cancer intervention.", 
    "74": "Pharmaceuticals, such as beta-blockers, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as well as their metabolites are introduced into the water cycle via municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents in all industrialized countries. As the amino acid sequences of the biological target molecules of these pharmaceuticals - the beta-1 adrenergic receptor for beta-blockers and the cyclooxygenase for NSAIDs - are phylogenetically conserved among vertebrates it is reasonable that wildlife vertebrates including fish physiologically respond in a similar way to them as documented in humans. Consequently, beta-blockers and NSAIDs both exhibit their effects according to their mode of action on one hand, but on the other hand that may lead to unwanted side effects in non-target species. To determine whether residuals of beta-1 adrenergic receptor antagonists and cyclooxygenase inhibitors may pose a risk to aquatic organisms, one has to know the extent to which such organisms respond to the total of active compounds, their metabolites and transformation products with the same modes of action. To cope with this demand, two cell-based assays were developed, by which the total beta-blocker and cyclooxygenase inhibitory activity can be assessed in a given wastewater or surface water extract in real time. The measured activity is quantified as metoprolol equivalents (MetEQ) of the lead substance metoprolol in the beta-blocker assay, and diclofenac equivalents (DicEQ) in the NSAID assay. Even though MetEQs and DicEQs were found to surpass the concentration of the respective lead substances (metoprolol, diclofenac), as determined by chemical analysis by a factor of two to three, this difference was shown to be reasonably explained by the presence and action of additional active compounds with the same mode of action in the test samples. Thus, both in\u00a0vitro assays were proven to integrate effectively over beta-blocker and NSAID activities in WWTP effluents in a very sensitive and extremely rapid manner.",

GDMT use was assessed at the time of angiography, and major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) and all-cause mortality were determined during 5\u00a0years of follow-up. Cox proportional hazard modeling was used to adjust for baseline differences between patients with and without concomitant CAD. Despite a higher adherence to GDMT (all p \u22640.002) for the use of aspirin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker, and statins, patients with PAD and concomitant CAD had higher unadjusted 5-year rates of MACCE (hazard ratio [HR] 1.7, 95% CI 1.3 to 2.1, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001) and all-cause mortality (HR 1.86, 95% CI 1.4 to 2.4, p\u00a0= 0.0001).

Prospective data from acute ischemic stroke admissions at a single center from July 2010-June 2015 were analyzed. Outcomes included infection (urinary tract infection [UTI], pneumonia, or bacteremia), discharge modified Rankin Score (mRS), and in-hospital death. Any selective and non-selective \u03b2-blocker use during the first 3\u00a0days of admission were investigated with propensity score matching. A sensitivity analysis was also performed.

    "77": "Excitotoxicity is a major pathological trigger of neurodegenerative diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This process is caused by excessive release of the transmitter glutamate that overwhelms the capacity of astroglia transporters to maintain a low extracellular level of this aminoacid and strongly stimulates neurons. Using an in vitro model of rat organotypic spinal slice culture, we explored if the excitotoxicity caused by the potent glutamate analogue kainate, widely employed as a paradigm to evoke neurotoxicity in the central nervous system, was prevented by the antibiotic ceftriaxone known to enhance glutamate transporter expression. We also tested if excitotoxicity was made worse by inhibiting glutamate uptake with dl-threo-\u03b2-benzyloxyaspartate (TBOA). These experiments were aimed at clarifying the relative contribution to neurotoxicity by kainate-activation of glutamate receptors or kainate-mediated release of glutamate. Neither ceftriaxone nor TBOA alone had adverse effects. Ceftriaxone (10\u03bcM; 3days) significantly decreased delayed cell death induced by kainate (100\u03bcM; 1h) and limited neuronal damage especially to motoneurons. This effect was associated to stronger astrocytic immunostaining of the glutamate transporter GLT-1. Conversely, pharmacological inhibition of glutamate uptake with TBOA was per se unable to induce neurotoxicity, yet it intensified cell death evoked by kainate. These data indicate that kainate-mediated glutamate release was critical to damage neurons, an effect prevented by up regulating glutamate uptake. These data suggest that modulating glutamate uptake is an important strategy to preserve neuronal networks.",

It also leads to target organ damage (TOD), which worsens organ function and the patient's clinical status. Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated oxidative stress may contribute significantly to TOD in patients with hypertension. NO (nitric oxide) is a paracrine factor derived from endothelial cells that has been shown to alleviate ROS-mediated oxidative damage. Nebivolol is a third-generation \u03b2-blocker with vasodilator activity, both actions contributing to decreased blood pressure in hypertensive patients. Its vasodilatory function is mediated by the endothelial l-arginine NO pathway. Nebivolol increases the bioavailability of NO in the vasculature. Its efficacy and safety profile is comparable to other commonly used antihypertensive agents. In this article, we review the current literature to understand TOD secondary to oxidative stress in patients with hypertension and the role of nebivolol in its prevention. A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms by which nebivolol reduces ROS-mediated TOD will not only help in the development of targeted therapies but may also improve health outcomes in hypertensive patients.",

She had been treated with cyclophosphamide, melphalan, lenalidomide and corticosteroids for POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy or edema, M protein, skin changes). She had no other risk factors for chronic liver disease. Laboratory and radiological examinations could not confirm the etiology of portal hypertension. The liver biopsy suggested hepatoportal sclerosis, compatible with idiopathic portal hypertension (IPH). Under a band ligation program, with beta-blocker, diuretics and prophylactic anticoagulation, the patient remains stable. In POEMS syndrome, a rare multi-systemic disease, the most frequent liver manifestation is hepatomegaly(1). To the best of authors' knowledge, IPH has been reported only 3 times in POEMS syndrome(2,3,4) and this is the second case reporting the occurrence of histological findings compatible with IPH. As the precise etiopathogenesis of IPH is not fully elucidated and as it is an extremely uncommon manifestation in POEMS, it is not yet certain whether IPH is part of the syndrome or whether it develops independently. While some investigators believe that there is a congenital vascular anomaly involving the changes in the portal tract, the majority support an acquired vascular defect hypothesis(5). The acquired IPH hypothesis emphasizes a possible role of various pathogenic determinants: infections, prothrombotic states, prolonged exposure to several medications and toxins, immunological basis and progressive fibrosis of the portal veins (5). In this hypothesis, a hepatic circulation defect secondary to POEMS syndrome, which includes pro-inflammatory (VEGF, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1\u00df, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, tumor growth factor-\u00df) and pro-thrombotic factors (aberrations in the thrombin-antithrombin complex)(1) which have been documented in the IPH and POEMS syndrome, may contribute to a possible association between these entities. Although the association between these two entities is yet to be confirmed, the authors present this case in order to contribute to its elucidation.",

Although it is frequently difficult to diagnose CVT promptly, it is important to consider it in the differential diagnosis when a hyperthyroid patient presents with atypical neurologic symptoms. CASE REPORT A 49-year-old Japanese female with unremarkable medical history came in with thyroid storm and multiple progressive ischemic stroke identified at another hospital. Treatment for thyroid storm with beta-blocker, glucocorticoid, and potassium iodide-iodine was started and MR venography was performed on hospital day 3 for further evaluation of her progressive ischemic stroke. The MRI showed CVT, and anticoagulation therapy, in addition to the anti-thyroid agents, was initiated. The patient's thyroid function was successfully stabilized by hospital day 10 and further progression of CVT was prevented. CONCLUSIONS Physicians should consider CVT when a patient presents with atypical course of stroke or with atypical MRI findings such as high intensity area in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping. Not only is an early diagnosis and initiation of anticoagulation important, but identifying and treating the underlying disease is essential to avoid the progression of CVT.",

Moreover, alterations in KATP activity and expression have been observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and during amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2)-induced pathology. Thus, we tested whether KATP modulators can influence A\u03b2-induced deleterious effects on memory, hippocampal network function, and plasticity. We found that treating animals with subclinical doses (those that did not change glycemia) of a KATP blocker (Tolbutamide) or a KATP opener (Diazoxide) differentially restrained A\u03b2-induced memory deficit, hippocampal network activity inhibition, and long-term synaptic plasticity unbalance (i.e., inhibition of LTP and promotion of LTD). We found that the protective effect of Tolbutamide against A\u03b2-induced memory deficit was strong and correlated with the reestablishment of synaptic plasticity balance, whereas Diazoxide treatment produced a mild protection against A\u03b2-induced memory deficit, which was not related to a complete reestablishment of synaptic plasticity balance. Interestingly, treatment with both KATP modulators renders the hippocampus resistant to A\u03b2-induced inhibition of hippocampal network activity. These findings indicate that KATP are involved in A\u03b2-induced pathology and they heighten the potential role of KATP modulation as a plausible therapeutic strategy against AD.",

Patients with topiramate and propranolol also exhibited significantly reduced headache frequency compared to those with placebo. On the other hand, patients with divalproex exhibited significantly higher risk of nausea compared to those with placebo, topiramate, propranolol, gabapentin and amitriptyline.

We recently showed that SK4 calcium-activated potassium channels are important for automaticity of cardiomyocytes derived from human embryonic stem cells. Here SK4 channels were identified in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) from healthy and CPVT2 patients bearing a mutation in calsequestrin 2 (CASQ2-D307H) and in SAN cells from WT and CASQ2-D307H knock-in (KI) mice. TRAM-34, a selective blocker of SK4 channels, prominently reduced delayed afterdepolarizations and arrhythmic Ca(2+) transients observed following application of the \u03b2-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol in CPVT2-derived hiPSC-CMs and in SAN cells from KI mice. Strikingly, in\u00a0vivo ECG recording showed that intraperitoneal injection of the SK4 channel blockers, TRAM-34 or clotrimazole, greatly reduced the arrhythmic features of CASQ2-D307H KI and CASQ2 knockout mice at rest and following exercise.

Characteristics of patients with T1DM and SH were compared with a control group being equivalent concerning age, diabetes duration, HbA1c, comorbidity, and \u03b2-blocker treatment. SH was defined as a symptomatic event requiring treatment with intravenous glucose or glucagon administration and being confirmed by a blood glucose measurement of <2.8\u00a0mmol/l. Predictive factors for SH were analysed by a multivariable regression model. As many as 405 cases of SH in T1DM occurred in 206 subjects; 50% of episodes were related to 31 patients who experienced \u22653 SH. Need for nursing care (OR 4.88), treatment with NPH (OR 3.68), and impaired hypoglycaemia awareness (OR 2.06) were the strongest risk factors for SH (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, all pFDR-adjusted\u00a0<\u00a00.10; false discovery rate (FDR)). Depression (OR 0.14), treatment with CSII (OR 0.39) and short-acting insulin analogues (OR 0.31) appeared to be protective (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.10; FDR-adjusted).

Beneficial effects of angiotensin II receptor blockers on cognitive functions have also been reported earlier; however, its role in chronic neuroinflammation-induced memory impairment in the hypertensive state is not well understood. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the effect of angiotensin II receptor blockers on memory impairment induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Our data provides the strong evidence that intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of LPS (25\u00a0\u03bcg) on the 1st, 4th, 7th, and 10th days leads to sustained neuroinflammation (as indicated by increased TNF-\u03b1, GFAP, COX-2, and NF-\u03baB) and oxidative stress (increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitrite levels) resulting in amyloid beta (A\u03b21-42) deposition, apoptosis (increased Bax and decreased Bcl-2 expression as well as increased caspase-3 activity and TUNEL-positive cells), and memory impairment. Further, we found that exaggerated inflammatory response and oxidative stress were associated with RAS over-activation (as evident from the increased ACE expression, angiotensin II (Ang II) level, and angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) expression) and decreased BDNF and p-CREB expression. Oral administration of candesartan (an AT1R blocker) at a non-anti-hypertensive dose (0.1\u00a0mg/kg) for 15\u00a0days attenuated LPS-induced (ICV) apoptosis, amyloidogenesis, and memory impairment. Candesartan shows neuroprotection by inhibiting TLR4/Ang II-induced NF-\u03baB inflammatory signaling and by enhancing associated BDNF/CREB expression in SHRs. Our study also demonstrated that when both AT1R and angiotensin type 2 receptor (AT2R) were blocked by candesartan and PD123319 concomitantly, the protective effects of candesartan were blunted suggesting that functionally active AT2R is required for beneficial effects of AT1R blockade.",

Overall, the 26 placebo-controlled trials showed clear short-term effects of propranolol over placebo. Due to the lack of studies with long-term follow up, it is unclear whether these effects are stable after stopping propranolol.

Beta blockers are one of several antihypertensive drug classes associated with ED. Nebivolol is a beta blocker with vasodilating properties mediated through endothelial release of nitric oxide which facilitates penile erection. Thus, nebivolol may offer an advantage over other beta blockers in the patient with hypertension and ED. A literature search comparing nebivolol with other beta blockers identified four European studies of limited duration, with the longest study being 28 weeks. Survey scores for erectile function showed significant improvement in erectile function with nebivolol in two of the studies, while the other two studies showed erectile function did not significantly worsen with nebivolol as compared with other beta blocker agents. One study showed improved erectile function scores, possibly due to the presence of a Hawthorne effect.

The \u03b2-AR agonist isoproterenol (Iso) induced heart failure with high mortality in postpartum female, in non-pregnant female and in male CKO, but not in wild-type mice. Iso induced heart failure and high mortality in CKO mice by impairing fatty acid and glucose uptake, thereby generating a metabolic deficit.

There are approximately 10 million people in the United States who have angina, and there are over 500 000 cases diagnosed per year. Several studies now show that angina itself is a predictor of major adverse cardiac events. In addition, angina is a serious morbidity that impedes quality of life and should be treated. In the United States, pharmacologic therapy for angina includes \u03b2-blockers, nitrates, calcium channel blockers, and the late sodium current blocker ranolazine. In other countries, additional pharmacologic agents include trimetazidine, ivabradine, nicorandil, fasudil, and others. Revascularization is indicated in certain high-risk individuals and also has been shown to improve angina. However, even after revascularization, a substantial percentage of patients return with recurrent or continued angina, requiring newer and better therapies. Treatment for refractory angina not amenable to usual pharmacologic therapies or revascularization procedures, includes enhanced external counterpulsation, transmyocardial revascularization, and stem cell therapy. Angina continues to be a significant cause of morbidity. Therapy should be geared not only to treating the risk factors for atherosclerotic disease and improving survival but should also be aimed at eliminating or reducing the occurrence of angina and improving the ability of patients to be active.",

Then, the FE-fed mice were treated with deferiprone (75mg/kg/day) or efonidipine (4mg/kg/day) for 30 days. The hearts were used to determine cardiac mitochondrial function, biogenesis, mitochondrial dynamics and protein expressions for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and apoptosis. ND-fed HT mice had impaired heart rate variability (HRV), increased mitochondrial dynamic proteins and caspase-3, compared with ND-fed wild-type mice. Iron overload led to increased plasma non-transferrin bound iron, oxidative stress, and the impairments of HRV and left ventricular function, cardiac mitochondrial function and mitochondrial dynamics, and decreased complex IV in thalassemic mice. Our results suggested that deferiprone and efonidipine treatment showed similar benefit in attenuating cardiac iron deposit and oxidative stress, and improved cardiac mitochondrial function, leading to improved left ventricular function, without altering the cardiac mitochondrial biogenesis, and apoptosis proteins in iron-overload thalassemic mice.",

Conversion by HRP appeared to be more efficient compared to LccPO. Diclofenac (DCF) and sotalol (STL) were completely transformed by HRP after 4\u00a0h and immediate conversion was observed for acetaminophen (APAP). During treatment with LccPO, 60% of DCF was still detectable after 24\u00a0h and no conversion was found for STL. APAP was completely transformed after 20\u00a0min. Sulfamethoxazole (SMX), carbamazepine (CBZ), ibuprofen (IBP) and naproxen (NAP) were insusceptible to enzymatic conversion. In pharmaceutical mixtures, HRP exhibited a preference for DCF and APAP and the generally less efficient conversion of STL was enhanced in presence of APAP. Transformation product pattern after treatment with HRP revealed polymerization products for DCF while STL showed cleavage reactions. DCF product formation shifted towards a proposed dimeric iminoquinone product in presence of APAP whereas a generally less pronounced product formation in mixtures was observed for STL. In conclusion, the enzymatic treatment approach worked selectively and efficiently for a few pharmaceuticals. However, for application the investigation and possibly immobilization of multiplex enzymes being able to transform diverse chemical structures is recommended.",

Nebivolol is a highly cardioselective \u03b2-adrenergic receptor blocker that possesses endothelium-dependent vasodilator properties and antioxidant capacities. Animals were allocated into four groups. Group one was given aqueous solution of carboxymethyl cellulose and served as control, group two was given nebivolol (10\u00a0mg/kg p.o., daily), group three was given cisplatin (2\u00a0mg/kg i.p. once per week) for 10 consecutive weeks and group four was treated with cisplatin concomitantly with nebivolol as per above schedule. Cisplatin-treated rats showed an increase in both depressive-like behaviors in open-field and forced swimming tests. In addition, histopathological examination revealed cortical encephalomalacia along with hippocampal neuronal degeneration and kidney dysfunction. In parallel, cisplatin administration prominently reduced GABA and elevated glutamate levels in the cortical and hippocampal tissues. Furthermore, it resulted in a significant decline in cortical and hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor and nitric oxide contents concomitantly with a marked decrease in endothelial- and an increase in inducible-nitric oxide synthase genes expression. On the other hand, treatment with nebivolol effectively mitigated the aforementioned cisplatin-associated behavioral, biochemical, and histopathological alterations without changing its antitumor activity as evidenced by sulforhodamine B cell survival assay.

During \u03b2-blockade, older adults actively constricted at 85 and 80% [Formula: see text] (peak \u0394FVC at 80% [Formula: see text]\u2009=\u2009-13\u2009\u00b1\u20096%; P < 0.05 vs. control), whereas the response in the young was not significantly impacted (peak \u0394FVC\u2009=\u200928\u2009\u00b1\u20098%). Combined \u03b1- and \u03b2-blockade increased the dilatory response to hypoxia in young adults; however, older adults failed to significantly vasodilate (peak \u0394FVC at 80% [Formula: see text]=\u200912\u2009\u00b1\u200911% vs. 58\u2009\u00b1\u200911%; P < 0.05). Our findings indicate that peripheral vasodilation to graded systemic hypoxia is significantly impaired in older adults, which cannot be fully explained by altered sympathoadrenal control of vascular tone. Thus, the impairment in hypoxic vasodilation is likely due to attenuated local vasodilatory and/or augmented vasoconstrictor signaling with age.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We found that the lack of peripheral vasodilation during graded systemic hypoxia with aging is not mediated by the sympathoadrenal system, strongly implicating local vascular control mechanisms in this impairment. Understanding these mechanisms may lead to therapeutic advances for improving tissue blood flow and oxygen delivery in aging and disease.", 
    "243": "A present study was conducted to investigate compatibility of \u03b2-blocker drugs( like atenolol, labetalol hydrochloride, bisoprolol fumarate, metoprolol succinate, carvedilol and propranolol hydrochloride) with the pharmaceutical excipient povidone. To check the influence of peroxide impurity present in povidone on the stability of \u03b2-blockers, a binary mixture technique has been adopted. The binary mixtures (1:1) of \u03b2-blockers with povidone excipient were stored for the duration of 6\u00a0months at accelerated conditions (40\u00b0C and 75% RH) and analyzed with the technique of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). On analysis, HPLC results shows that, the percentage of total impurity for atenolol-2.15%, bisoprolol fumarate-3.55%, carvedilol-2.19%, and labetalol hydrochloride-1.89%, with\u00a0respect to povidone. To verify the interaction of H2O2 present in povidone as an impurity, oxidative degradation of selected active pharmaceutical ingredients were performed and degradation profile were compared with that of degradation impurities generated in drug-excipient mixture at accelerated conditions. The relative retention time (RRT) of impurities generated in accelerated stability study samples resembles the RRT of degradation products generated by oxidative degradation of pure drugs. Thus, it confirms that degradation of \u03b2-blockers with povidone was mediated by organic peroxides present as an impurity in povidone.",

    "245": "In a population-based study, all community-dwelling elderly adults (\u226560 years old) from Aiquara, Bahia, Brazil, were invited to participate in the study. Two-hundred-thirty-two (232) elderly adults provided information about their smoking habits and underwent 5-min recordings of successive RR intervals. Analysis of the variability of the RR intervals was performed in time and frequency domains and with nonlinear methods. The HAC parameters were adjusted for the following potential confounders: age, sex, diabetes, beta-blocker use, cardiovascular disease, body mass index and physical activity level. After exclusions, 210 elderly adults were divided into 2 groups, nonsmokers or those\u00a0who stopped smoking (NSMOK [n=190]) and current smokers (SMOK [n=20]). Owing\u00a0to the absence of a normal distribution, the Mann-Whitney test was used for group comparisons.", 
    "246": "For unadjusted HAC parameters, a significant difference was observed (p<0.05) between groups for the following parameters in the time domain: CV_RR; SDNN; RMSSD; pNN50; triangular index TINN; and nonlinear parameters SD1, SD2 and D2. All of the adjusted HAC parameters (including the Mean RR and frequency domain parameters) were significantly different between the groups.", 
    "247": "Together, the HAC parameters indicated a higher variability of successive RR intervals in NSMOK elderly adults. Notwithstanding, adjustment of the HAC parameters was an important step to improve data analysis. These results indicate an impaired sympathovagal balance on the heart of elderly adult smokers.", 
    "248": "Herein, we report a new series of aliphatic substituted pyridyl-urea small molecules synthesized as potential modulators for amyloid beta (A\u03b2) induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Their blocking activities against A\u03b2-induced mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening were evaluated by JC-1 assay which measures the change of mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m). The inhibitory activity of sixteen compounds against A\u03b2-induced mPTP opening was superior or almost similar to that of the standard Cyclosporin A (CsA). Among them, 1-(3-(benzyloxy)pyridin-2-yl)-3-(2-(piperazin-1-yl)ethyl)urea (5x) effectively maintained mitochondrial function and cell viabilities on ATP assay, MTT assay, and ROS assay. Using CDocker algorithm, a molecular docking model presented a plausible binding mode for 5x with cyclophilin D (CypD) receptor as a major component of mPTP. Moreover, hERG and BBB-PAMPA assays presented safe cardiotoxicity and high CNS bioavailability profiles for 5x. Taken as a whole, this report presents compound 5x as a new nonpeptidyl mPTP blocker may hold a promise for further development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapeutics.", 
    "249": "The current standard of treatment for infantile hemangiomas (IHs) involves initial observation for regression throughout infancy and childhood, with or without medical management with \u03b2-blocker medications. Approximately 50% of the lesions respond almost completely to this regimen. However, the remaining 50% of the lesions, especially established focal IHs of the lip, nose, eyelids, forehead, cheek, and scalp, do not regress completely with this regimen or do so leaving a deformity; among these lesions, early surgical management may result in a superior aesthetic and functional outcome.",

    "251": "In this case series, records of infants and children presenting to a tertiary care vascular anomalies center for management of IHs by the senior author were reviewed. Representative examples of focal IHs of the lips, nose, eyelids, cheek, and glabella demonstrating the tissue expansion effect were selected for presentation. Expert opinion based on more than 20 years of experience of the senior surgeon treating more than 2000 patients with focal IH and long-term clinical follow-up is also provided.", 
    "252": "Eradication of the IH while restoring aesthetic form and function to the face.", 
    "253": "Five examples of patients with focal IHs of the lip, nose, eyelid, cheek, and glabella demonstrating the tissue expander effect who were successfully treated with surgery are presented. The 5 patients with these lesions ranged in age from 3 months to 5 years old, and all of them were female. One of these patients was treated with \u03b2-blockers, and another with steroids, with incomplete response to treatment prior to undergoing surgery. The tissue expander effect of a focal IH on adjacent, unaffected tissue facilitated excision of the lesion and primary closure without distortion of anatomical subunits in all 5 of these cases. Improved cosmesis with either improved or unaffected function was demonstrated.", 
    "254": "Clinicians should consider early surgical intervention in infants with select focal infantile hemangiomas in lieu of prolonged observation or medical management. The psychological benefit of early removal of these disfiguring lesions has not been quantified, but is subjectively apparent to clinicians and the families of patients. Furthermore, the costs and unknown long-term sequelae of \u03b2-blocker medication, which is the current standard of treatment for IHs along with observation for regression, have not yet been quantified but will gain increasing salience in the current medical climate.",
