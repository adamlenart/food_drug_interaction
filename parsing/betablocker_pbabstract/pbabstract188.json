    "2": "A total of 1234 patients using chronic beta-blockers underwent dobutamine stress echocardiography and were prospectively included in the study. Heart rate and blood pressure responses were measured during the dobutamine stress echocardiography protocol. During a median follow-up time of 4 years (range: 0.5-14 years), overall and cardiac mortality and nonfatal myocardial infarction were noted.", 
    "3": "A total of 954 and 280 patients were using beta1-selective and nonselective beta-blockers, respectively. During dobutamine stress echocardiography, the heart rate response was significantly higher, systolic and diastolic blood pressure responses were significantly lower and the double product of heart rate and systolic blood pressure was similar in patients using beta1-selective than in patients using nonselective beta-blockers. In patients with and without new wall motion abnormalities during dobutamine stress echocardiography, a similar cardiac event-free survival was observed irrespective of the selectivity of beta-blockers (P=0.9 and 0.3, respectively).", 
    "4": "During dobutamine stress echocardiography, heart rate and blood pressure response was different, but the double product was similar in patients using beta1-selective or nonselective beta-blockers, which may explain why the long-term prognostic value of dobutamine stress echocardiography is similar in these two groups.", 
    "5": "Heterogeneity of heart failure (HF) phenotypes indicates contributions from underlying common polymorphisms. We considered polymorphisms in the beta(1)-adrenergic receptor (beta(1)AR), a beta-blocker target, as candidate pharmacogenomic loci. Transfected cells, genotyped human nonfailing and failing ventricles, and a clinical trial were used to ascertain phenotype and mechanism. In nonfailing and failing isolated ventricles, beta(1)-Arg-389 had respective 2.8 +/- 0.3- and 4.3 +/- 2.1-fold greater agonist-promoted contractility vs. beta(1)-Gly-389, defining enhanced physiologic coupling under relevant conditions of endogenous expression and HF. The beta-blocker bucindolol was an inverse agonist in failing Arg, but not Gly, ventricles, without partial agonist activity at either receptor; carvedilol was a genotype-independent neutral antagonist. In transfected cells, bucindolol antagonized agonist-stimulated cAMP, with a greater absolute decrease observed for Arg-389 (435 +/- 80 vs. 115 +/- 23 fmol per well). Potential pathophysiologic correlates were assessed in a placebo-controlled trial of bucindolol in 1,040 HF patients. No outcome was associated with genotype in the placebo group, indicating little impact on the natural course of HF. However, the Arg-389 homozygotes treated with bucindolol had an age-, sex-, and race-adjusted 38% reduction in mortality (P = 0.03) and 34% reduction in mortality or hospitalization (P = 0.004) vs. placebo. In contrast, Gly-389 carriers had no clinical response to bucindolol compared with placebo. Those with Arg-389 and high baseline norepinephrine levels trended toward improved survival, but no advantage with this allele and exaggerated sympatholysis was identified. We conclude that beta(1)AR-389 variation alters signaling in multiple models and affects the beta-blocker therapeutic response in HF and, thus, might be used to individualize treatment of the syndrome.",

In all patients the left ventricular outflow tract velocities decreased (2.91+/-0.4 m/s to 1.92+/-0.46 m/s, p=0.001). However, the oxygen consumption during exercise was higher (7.3+/-1.7 METs to 8.5+/-1.8 METs, p=0.005), and symptoms improved significantly following therapy, with a reduction in mean NYHA class from 1.9+/-0.5 to 1.0+/-0.0 (p=0.001).",

    "14": "Evidence indicates that oxidative stress refers to a condition where cells are subjected to excessive levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Overall vascular function is dependent upon a fine balance between oxidant and antioxidant mechanisms which is required, at least in part, for proper functioning of the endothelium. Considerable experimental and clinical data indicate that the intracellular oxidant milieu is also involved in several redox-sensitive cellular signaling pathways, such as ion transport systems, protein phosphorylation, and gene expression and thus also plays important roles as modulator of vascular cell function, such as cell growth, apoptosis, migration, angiogenesis and cell adhesion. Overproduction of ROS under pathophysiologic conditions is integral in the development of vascular disease. This fact stimulated an intensive search of new pharmacological approaches to improve vascular hemeostasis and, particularly those intended to decrease oxidative stress or augment the antioxidant defense mechanisms.", 
    "15": "Cardiovascular diseases are the major cause of death and a significant cause of disability in the Western world and more recently threaten to pose an increasing health burden on developing nations. People with pre-existent vascular disease are those at highest risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes and require aggressive secondary preventive therapies. Large strides have been made in the development of pharmacologic agents that intervene on various pathways implicated in atherogenesis, thus offering the ability to greatly impact on disease progression and to prevent events. Compelling data derived primarily from randomized controlled trials have shown the benefits of aspirin (or antiplatelet agents) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (A), beta-blockers and blood pressure (B) and cholesterol-lowering drugs (C), particularly statins, in preventing recurrent events and improving survival. Taken together these data are the foundation for the simple, but important advice for secondary prevention - the ABCs. In addition, the evidence for the central role of lifestyle factors as determinants of risk has lead to increased efforts towards developing interventions aimed at modifying lifestyle patterns. Today, the biggest challenge remains in the implementation of proven effective therapies. Our focus should turn to educating physicians and patients alike regarding available therapies and their indications. In addition systematic, sustainable and globally applicable approaches to the secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases need to be developed to truly realize the vast potential benefits of existing therapies.", 
    "16": "We report a case of a patient with severe heart failure after Fontan procedure in whom carvedilol was very effective. A 27-year-old man had intractable congestive heart failure due to severe ventricular dysfunction after Fontan operation. Central venous pressure was elevated to 29 mmHg. A right-to-left shunt was noted across a large collateral vessel between the innominate vein and the pulmonary vein. He was administered carvedilol (initial dose, 2 mg/day; maximum dose, 30 mg/day). Cardiac catheterization performed 1 year after carvedilol administration revealed a decrease in atrial pressure and improvement of ventricular function. He underwent a conversion operation to total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC) and ligation of a collateral vein communicating with the innominate and pulmonary veins. Carvedilol may be a legitimate treatment before TCPC conversion or heart transplantation for the high-risk group of patients with a failed Fontan circulation.",

    "21": "Drugs that modify noradrenergic transmission such as atomoxetine and clonidine are increasingly prescribed for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, the therapeutic targets of these compounds are unknown. Norepinephrine is also implicated in the hyperactivity exhibited by coloboma mice. To identify the receptor subtypes that regulate the hyperactivity, coloboma mice were systematically challenged with adrenergic drugs. The beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol and the alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor antagonist prazosin each had little effect on the hyperactivity. Conversely, the alpha(2)-adrenergic receptor antagonist yohimbine reduced the activity of coloboma mice but not control mice. Subtype-selective blockade of alpha(2C)-, but not alpha(2A)- or alpha(2B)-adrenergic receptors, ameliorated hyperactivity of coloboma mice without affecting activity of control mice, suggesting that alpha(2C)-adrenergic receptors mediate the hyperactivity. Localized in the basal ganglia, alpha(2C)-adrenergic receptors are in a prime position to impact locomotor activity and are, therefore, potential targets of pharmacotherapy for ADHD.", 
    "22": "The abundance of voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels is altered by beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) stimulation and by an elevation of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration in cardiac myocytes. In whole animal, chronic beta-AR stimulation or pacing heart results in various changes in the abundance of the channel, but it reduces the beta-AR responsiveness of the L-type channel. Because beta-AR stimulation facilitates the L-type calcium channels, it is difficult in the whole animal to study the effects of beta-AR and Ca2+ influx on the upregulation of the L-type channel independently of each other, which makes the culture of nonbeating adult myocytes an attractive model. We found that culturing quiescent adult rabbit ventricular myocytes with isoproterenol (ISO, 2 microM) for 72 h or more caused a significant increase in the expression of mRNA coding for the L-type channel alpha(1C) subunit by approximately twofold as compared to time-matched controls, and it was followed by a 1.8-fold increase in the Ca2+ current density at 96 h. Somewhat surprisingly, an acute application of 1 microM ISO increased the current amplitude even in ISO-treated cells. The increase in the current density, induced by sustained beta-AR stimulation, was blocked by a beta-AR antagonist, propranolol (10 microM), but not by a Ca2+ antagonist, nitrendipine (10 microM). In addition, the effects were reproduced by forskolin (10 microM), but not by a Ca2+ agonist, Bay-K 8644 (2 microM). Taken together, these results suggest that sustained beta-AR stimulation upregulates L-type channel expression, but does not alter the beta-AR responsiveness of the channel in quiescent myocytes.", 
    "23": "Colorectal distensions of 60 and 80 mmHg significantly reduced heart rate (HR) and cardiac sympathetic nerve activity in anesthetized rats. This bradycardiac response was not influenced by the intravenous administration of atropine, but was abolished by propranolol, suggesting that it was elicited by sympathetic but not vagal efferent nerves.", 
    "24": "The choice is difficult in medicine. But individual physicians and patients must make medical decisions rather than organizations or pharmaceutical companies. The choice concerns the transparency of the decision-making process (evidence based medicine), and mistrust of the methods used in cost-effectiveness analysis. Medicare's policy of paying for any medical advance that has positive benefits, regardless of its costs, is un-sustainable. Cost-effectiveness information may assume a more important role in future coverage decisions with regard to outpatient prescription drugs, but at the private level, rather than at the national one. Functional equivalence of drugs reflects a reference-pricing technique applied to a therapeutic category--reimbursement for compounds of similar efficacy within a therapeutic class set to the lowest-priced product in the class. Essentially, a standard of functional equivalence applies a cost-effectiveness principle: assuming that alternative interventions are equivalent, one should not pay more for one of them.",

The expression of PKC-betaII in the renal cortex of diabetic rats decreased significantly in the membrane (50.00 +/- 11.68%, p < 0.05) and remained unchanged in the cytosol (94.51 +/- 11.69%, p > 0.05) compared with normal controls.

Although both hCE-1 and hCE-2 are present in human liver, the dominant component was found to be hCE-1, whereas the hydrolase activity of the human small intestine was found to be predominantly hCE-2. hCE-2 has a limited ability to hydrolyze large acyl compound substrates. Interestingly, propranolol derivatives, good substrates for hCE-2, were easily hydrolyzed by substitution of the methyl group on the 2-position of the acyl moiety, but were barely hydrolyzed when the methyl group was substituted on the 3-position. These findings suggest that hCE-2 does not easily form acylated intermediates because of conformational interference in its active site. In contrast, hCE-1 could hydrolyze a variety of substrates. The hydrolytic activity of hCE-2 increased with increasing alcohol chain length in benzoic acid derivative substrates, whereas hCE-1 preferentially catalyzed the hydrolysis of substrates with short alcohol chains. Kinetic data showed that the determining factor for the rate of hydrolysis of p-aminobenzoic acid esters was V(max) for hCE-1 and K(m) for hCE-2. Furthermore, the addition of hydrophobic alcohols to the reaction mixture with p-aminobenzoic acid propyl ester induced high and low levels of transesterification by hCE-1 and hCE-2, respectively. When considering the substrate specificities of hCE-1, it is necessary to consider the transesterification ability of hCE-1, in addition to the binding structure of the substrate in the active site of the enzyme.",

The inducible ventricular ectopy was abolished in 10 dogs (>12 V, P < 0.05) and the response to HFS was blunted in one dog (10-11 V).

The objective of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetics of esmolol in children with a history of supraventricular arrhythmias (SVT) who were scheduled for diagnostic electrophysiology study or a catheter ablation procedure. Subjects were stratified into two age groups: 2-11 and 12-16 years. After an episode of stimulated or spontaneous SVT, esmolol was administered intravenously as a 1,000 microg/kg bolus followed by continuous infusion at 300 microg/kg/min. Blood samples were collected before, at 5, 10 and 15 min after the loading dose, and 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 20 min after the end of the infusion. Plasma concentration of esmolol was quantitated by a specific LC/MS assay. Pharmacokinetic data were available for 25 subjects. Arterial esmolol concentrations were approximately five times greater than venous concentrations. Esmolol had an extremely short distribution half-life (0.6 min), a rapid terminal elimination half-life (6.9 min), and a rapid clearance (119 +/- 51 mL/min/kg) which was not related to subject age or weight.

    "40": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of esmolol-induced negative ino- and chronotropism during stent/balloon angioplasty for aortic coarctation. Balloon angioplasty and stent placement have become widely accepted therapies for native and recurrent coarctation of the aorta (CoA). Trauma to the vessel wall and stent migration related to forward displacement of the balloon and/or stent by cardiac output, are the most common complications. Controlling stroke volume and heart rate may assist in balloon stability and accurate deployment of stents. All methods currently used to achieve this have significant limitations. We describe our experience using esmolol to control stroke volume and heart rate during balloon/stent angioplasty of CoA. We performed a retrospective review of all patients who had intravenous esmolol during percutaneous treatment of CoA. Six interventions were performed in six patients: coarctation stent angioplasty in five patients (two native coarctation) and balloon angioplasty alone in one patient. The median systolic blood pressure achieved during the procedure was 65 mmHg (range, 57-75) representing a median reduction of 40 mmHg (range, 20-80; p = 0.008) from baseline. The median heart achieved was 50 beats/min (range, 20-80), representing a median reduction of 20 beats/min (range, 15-90, p = 0.048) from baseline. Optimal stent position was obtained in all patients. Intravenous esmolol controls periprocedural hemodynamics effectively and safely during percutaneous therapy for aortic coarctation, thereby aiding accurate stent placement. Further evaluation of its use during other percutaneous left heart interventions is required.",

The effects of the different chromatographic conditions (buffer system, pH value, content of organic modifier, injection volume and flow rate) on the separation behaviour were studied. At higher flow rates the peaks seemed to be more symmetrical than at lower flow rates. The use of buffer or salt in the mobile phase for this separation is found to be very essential and the counter-anion type of this buffer or salt significantly affected the retention behaviour of beta-blockers while the cation type did not play the same important role.",

Like many therapeutics and other aquatic contaminants, propranolol is distributed as a racemic mixture ((R,S)-propranolol hydrochloride). Although the (S)-enantiomer is the most active form in mammals (up to 100-fold difference), no information is available regarding the enantiospecific toxicity of propranolol to aquatic organisms. Acute and chronic studies were conducted with Daphnia magna and Pimephales promelas to determine enantiospecific toxicity of propranolol to a model aquatic invertebrate and vertebrate, respectively. Also, enantiospecific effects of propranolol on D. magna heart rate were examined. Propranolol treatment levels were verified using high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Acute (48-h) responses of both organisms were similar for all enantiomer treatments. Chronic P. promelas responses to propranolol enantiomers followed the hypothesized relationship of (S)-propranolol being more toxic than (R)-propranolol, but chronic D. magna responses did not. This is potentially the result of a lack of beta-type receptors in cladocerans. No enantiospecific effects on daphnid heart rate were observed in acute exposures. Interestingly, some propranolol enantiomer treatments produced significant increases in reproduction before causing reproduction to decrease at higher treatment levels. To our knowledge, this research represents the first study of enantiospecific toxicity of chiral pharmaceutical pollutants.",

Optimized values for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) Km and Vmax were used for the final simulation results and for a stochastic virtual trial with 12 patients.", 
    "55": "Talinolol, a P-gp substrate, exhibits non-linear dose AUC relationship after administration of 25, 50, 100 and 400 mg immediate-release tablets. This dose dependency is due to a decrease of efflux transport caused by saturation of P-gp by talinolol. It was found that oral bioavailability increases after administration of higher doses of talinolol. The predicted bioavailability of the p.o. 25, 50, 100 and 400 mg doses of talinolol was 64, 76, 85, 94%, respectively. Pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC, Cmax) from in silico simulations are within acceptable range comparing with data, observed in vivo. However, the in vitro value of Km for talinolol's interactions with P-gp could not be used in the simulation and still reproduce the observed non-linear dose dependence. For each of the four doses, GastroPlus was used to model pharmacodynamic (PD) response and to optimize the values of CLe, Emax, and EC5o with the effect compartment linked indirectly to the central compartment.

Additionally, a dose of carvedilol (10(-5)M) was added 2h before incubation with okadaic acid (50 nM) and was present until the end of the experiment (2h later added okadaic acid). Our results reveal that okadaic acid induces oxidative stress and an increase of cell LDH in N1E-115 cells, whereas carvedilol prevented the changes prompted by okadaic acid. In conclusion, the data show the protective effect of carvedilol, as well as its ability to modify cell response to okadaic acid, involving like cytoprotective mechanism its antioxidative properties.",

Retention of the CR was assessed 1 week following acquisition under conditions of non-threat and threat. Conditioned stimuli were colored circles and the unconditioned stimulus (UCS) was a \"highly annoying\" electrical stimulus. The propranolol failed to produce any measurable effects on acquisition or retention of the CR and there was no evidence of increased conditionability in individuals diagnosed with PTSD. One week following acquisition, the differential CR to the reinforced stimulus was evident only in the threat condition. This suggests that belief in the presence of a threat is necessary and sufficient for activating a previously established CR.",

By using headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) combined with a novel back-extraction facility coupled off-line to capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE), the determination of propranolol enantiomers in urine was achieved with combination of ultrasonic back-extraction and field amplified sample injection (FASI) technologies. Extraction and back-extraction parameters were optimized. The clean-up effect and preconcentration effect were realized without derivatization during the SPME process in terms of this strongly polar and thermally stable compound. Preconcentration of the sample by calix [4] arene fiber increased the sensitivity, yielding a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.01 mg/L by CZE-diode array detection (DAD).

    "98": "The negative physical and affective aspects of opioid abstinence contribute to the prolongation of substance abuse. Withdrawal treatment is successful only in a subset of subjects, yet little is known about the neurobiological causes of these individual differences. Here, we compare the somatic and motivational components of opioid withdrawal in animals with high reactivity (HR) vs low reactivity (LR) to novelty, a phenotype associated with differential vulnerability to drug abuse. During withdrawal, HR relative to LR showed increased teeth chattering and eye twitching episodes, somatic signs associated with adrenergic modulation. Given the role of noradrenergic circuitry of the extended amygdala in opioid withdrawal, we examined adrenergic receptor gene expression in the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BST) and central nucleus of the amygdala. Relative to LR, HR rats exhibit a selective increase in beta(1) adrenergic receptor expression in lateral and medial BST. To uncover the functional relevance of this difference, we microinjected betaxolol, a selective beta(1) receptor antagonist, into dorsal BST and assessed somatic and affective responses during withdrawal. Betaxolol microinjection dose-dependently decreased teeth chattering episodes in HR to levels observed in LR animals. Moreover, the antagonist blocked conditioned place aversion, a measure of negative affect associated with withdrawal, in HR but not in LR animals. Our results reveal for the first time that reactivity to novelty predicts somatic and affective aspects of opiate dependence, and that beta(1) receptors in BST are implicated in opiate withdrawal but only in novelty-seeking individuals.", 
    "99": "An attenuated heart rate recovery (HRR) immediately after exercise has been shown to be predictive of mortality. It is not known whether HRR predicts mortality when measured in patients with heart failure. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the ability of HRR to predict mortality in patients with heart failure. We studied 84 NYHA class II or III chronic congestive heart failure patients who had a left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 40%. All patients underwent symptom limited cardiopulmonary exercise testing. The value for the HRR was defined as the difference in heart rate between peak exercise and one-minute later; a value < or = 18 beats per minute was considered abnormal. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to the value of HRR. Those with abnormal HRR were assigned to group I and those with normal HRR were assigned to group II. The 2 groups were compared with each other regarding baseline characteristics and exercise capacity assessed by peak VO2. There were 26 patients (31%) in group I and 58 patients (69%) in group II. Group II patients had better performance on treadmill exercise testing than group I patients. They had greater exercise duration (7.5 +/- 3.8 minutes versus 5 +/- 3.5 minutes, P = 0.006), better heart-rate reserve (79 +/- 25% versus 63 +/- 27%, P = 0.01), and higher values of maximal heart-rate (141 +/- 18 beats/min versus 132 +/- 17 beats/min, P = 0.04). Group II patients also had higher peak VO2 values (16.8 +/- 4.4 mL/kg/min versus 14.4 +/- 3.6 mL/kg/min, P = 0.01). When we separated the groups according to beta-blocker usage, beta-blockers had no prominent effect on HRR. In the follow-up period (mean 14.1 +/- 6.1 months), the presence of abnormal HRR and lower peak VO2 (< or = 14 mL/kg/min) were the only significant predictors of mortality in our patient population (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 5.2, 95% CI, 1.3 to 24, P = 0.03 and adjusted HR 13, 95% CI, 2.1 to 25.6, P = 0.005, respectively). It seems that the attenuated HRR value one minute after peak exercise appears to be a reliable index of the severity of exercise intolerance in heart failure patients and this study supports the value of HRR as a prognostic marker among heart failure patients referred for cardiopulmonary exercise testing for prediction of prognosis.",

Patients were randomly assigned to receive daily treatment with carvedilol (n = 27, 12.5 mg/day orally for the first 2 days and 25 mg/day thereafter), atenolol (n = 26, 50 mg/day orally), or doxazosin (n = 24, 2 mg/day orally) for 90 days. Doses were doubled at the end of the 3rd week in patients whose blood pressure was inadequately controlled and amlodipine 10 mg was added to the treatment if the target blood pressure was still not reached at the end of week 6. The biochemical parameters and insulin sensitivity based on the HOMA-IR model were evaluated at baseline and at the end of treatment. Similar reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure were observed in all groups (P > 0.05). A significant decrease in HDL cholesterol levels occurred in the doxazosin and atenolol groups compared to the carvedilol group (percent change: -5.6 +/- 13.5 and -8 +/- 9.8 versus -0.1 +/- 12.2, respectively; P < 0.05) and a significant increase in apolipoprotein A1 level was observed in the carvedilol group compared to the doxazosin and atenolol groups (percent change: + 4.3 +/- 9.6 versus - 0.5 +/- 10.6 and -2.3 +/- 6.6, respectively; P < 0.05).

The hypotonically induced [Ca(2+)](c) elevation was significantly suppressed by nicardipine, a voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channel blocker, and by Gd(3+), amiloride, 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborate, and ruthenium red, all cation channel blockers. In contrast, the [Ca(2+)](c) elevation was not inhibited by suramin, a P(2) purinoceptor antagonist. Whole cell patch-clamp analyses showed that hypotonic stimulation induced membrane depolarization of beta-cells and produced outwardly rectifying cation currents; Gd(3+) inhibited both responses. Hypotonic stimulation also increased insulin secretion from isolated rat islets, and Gd(3+) significantly suppressed this secretion. Together, these results suggest that osmotic cell swelling activates cation channels in rat pancreatic beta-cells, thereby causing membrane depolarization and subsequent activation of voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels and thus elevating insulin secretion.",

Hemodynamic and cardiac parameters including the heart rate (HR), left-ventricular fractional shortening (FS), and arterial pressure were measured in six healthy dogs without cardiac disease. Carvedilol did not affect FS or arterial pressure, but decreased the HR significantly. The positive inotropic and chronotropic responses to dobutamine and dopamine were attenuated by carvedilol, whereas arterial pressure was unaffected. Milrinone did not affect the HR and decreased arterial pressure, whereas FS was significantly greater both in the control and carvedilol-treated groups. Although milrinone affect the negative chronotropic effects of carvedilol, milrinone increased FS and prevented the decrease in arterial pressure. These results suggest that inhibition of PDE III preserves cardiac contractility and hemodynamic function in the presence of carvedilol.",

    "169": "Alveolar fluid reabsorption (AFR) is important in keeping the air spaces free of edema. This process is accomplished via active transport of Na(+) across the alveolo-capillary barrier mostly by apical Na(+) channels and basolateral Na(+)-K(+)-ATPases. Recently, we have reported that acute elevation of left atrial pressures is associated with decreased AFR in isolated rat lungs. However, the effect of chronic elevation of pulmonary capillary pressure, such as seen in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), on AFR is unknown. CHF was induced by creating an aorto-caval fistula (ACF) in Sprague-Dawley male rats. Seven days after the placement of the fistula, AFR was studied in the isolated perfused rat lung model. AFR in control rats was 0.49 +/- 0.02 ml/h (all values are means +/- SE) and increased by approximately 40% (0.69 +/- 0.03 ml/h) in rats with chronic CHF (P < 0.001). The albumin flux from the pulmonary circulation into the air spaces did not increase in the experimental groups, indicating that lung permeability for large solutes was not increased. Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity and protein abundance at the plasma membrane of distal alveolar epithelial tissue were significantly increased in CHF rats compared with controls. These changes were associated with increased plasma norepinephrine levels in CHF rats compared with controls. We provide evidence that in a rat model of chronic compensated CHF, AFR is increased, possibly due to increased endogenous norepinephrine upregulating active sodium transport and protecting against alveolar flooding.", 
    "170": "Cardiovascular disease is the main cause of death after renal transplantation. There are few trials evaluating the efficacy of prevention strategies in renal transplant patients on major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and cardiovascular mortality. However, there is general agreement that active prevention strategies can significantly decrease cardiovascular mortality after renal transplantation. Here, we present the case of a 52-year-old male patient who received a first kidney transplant in 1993. He showed a small fixed perfusion defect on thallium scintigraphy before transplant. He was admitted at 13 months due to an antero-lateral myocardial infarction that was complicated with ventricular fibrillation. Despite anti-coagulation with acenocumarol, treatment with statins and angiotensin II receptor blocking agents and an excellent preservation of renal function, the patient presented with a second episode of myocardial infarction at 9 years post-transplant. This case report is discussed in order to highlight the way in which attitudes have been modified in the past decade in order to systematically pursue an early diagnosis of pre-existing coronary artery disease, aggressively treat MACE and actively decrease cardiovascular risk in transplant patients, using all available efficacious treatments as well as individualizing immunosuppression to prolong not only graft but also patient survival.",

This study was designed to investigate the effects of various antihypertensive drugs on blood pressure and blood pressure variability reductions, baroreflex sensitivity, and target organ damage in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The dose is 20 mg/kg/day for atenolol, and 10 mg/kg/day for nifedipine, irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide. We used relatively low doses of drugs to avoid a very remarkable normalization of blood pressure in the treatment, which would make it much difficult to distinguish the contribution of blood pressure variability and baroreflex sensitivity to organ protection from that of blood pressure. Drugs at the aforementioned doses were mixed into rat chow. SHR were treated for 4 months. Blood pressure was then continuously recorded for 24 h. After the determination of baroreflex sensitivity, rats were killed for organ-damage evaluation. It was found that long-term treatment with atenolol, nifedipine, irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide all markedly reduced blood pressure variability, enhanced baroreflex sensitivity, and produced significant organ protection. Compared with blood pressure level, blood pressure variability and baroreflex sensitivity values showed a much closer or similar relationship with organ-damage parameters in every treatment group of rats. Multiple-regression analysis showed that the decrease in left ventricular hypertrophy, the decrease in aortic hypertrophy and the amelioration in renal lesion were all most closely correlated with the increase in baroreflex sensitivity and the decrease in systolic blood pressure variability. In conclusion, long-term treatment with atenolol, nifedipine, irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide produced organ protection in SHR. Besides the blood pressure reduction, the decrease in blood pressure variability and the restoration of baroreflex sensitivity may contribute to this organ protection.",

    "217": "Non-selective beta blockers are very useful drugs in preventing first variceal bleeding and re-bleeding in patients with cirrhosis. These drugs work in two ways: 1) by blocking beta1 receptors and reducing cardiac output, and 2) by blocking beta2 receptors, producing splanchnic vasoconstriction and reducing portal flow. Consequently, they reduce portal pressure. In primary prophylaxis, beta blockers reduced the bleeding risk from 30 to 15%; in secondary prophylaxis, this risk decreased from 60 to 42% in the first year. Heart rate decrease does not necessary correlate with reduction in hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG). When this gradient is reduced to less than 12 mmHg, the patient will not bleed; when this is reduced > 20% from basal values bleeding risk is extremely low, estimated at 9% at 2 years. The only way to know whether the patient has become a responder is to measure the HVPG. Additionally, by means of this method we also can identify the non-responders, who have a higher rate of re-bleeding, between 54 and 64%, and can attempt to utilize a more aggressive therapy, such as adding isosorbide mononitrate to the beta blocker or combining the beta blocker with endoscopic ligation.

Among both patients and controls, those with CAC were approximately 10 years older than those without CAC. In addition to age, a significant determinant of positive CAC status in both groups was the number of cardiovascular risk factors. In patients with SLE, CAC was associated with a higher homocysteine concentration, a lower GFR, and longer disease duration. In controls, the total cholesterol level correlated positively with CAC. When multivariate logistic regression methods were applied to candidate explanatory variables, homocysteine concentration, age, and disease duration (but not the levels of sCD154 or hsCRP) contributed significantly to CAC status.

    "229": "A 61-year-old man with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy was treated twice with percutaneous transluminal septal myocardial ablation (PTSMA). The first procedure improved the left ventricular outflow tract pressure gradient (LVOTG) from 148 to 48 mmHg and the New York Heart Association (NYHA) class from III to II in a week. However, the LVOTG increased to 197 mmHg and the NYHA class worsened to III within 3 months. In spite of medical treatment with beta-blocker, syncope attack occurred suddenly. Repeated PTSMA was performed. Just after the second procedure, the LVOTG did not decrease. However, the LVOTG decreased to 81 mmHg and the NYHA class improved to II with 3 months. The different response of pressure gradient in the acute and chronic phase with repeated PTSMA was interesting."
