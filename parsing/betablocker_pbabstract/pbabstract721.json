    "0": "Nadolol and propranolol were compared in seventy-five hypertensive patients in a double-blind randomized study conducted at Ain-Shams Hospital. After an initial wash-out period of 5 weeks, including 3 weeks of placebo administration, forty-five patients were given nadolol once daily and thirty patients received propranolol four times per day for 12 weeks, followed by a tapering-off period of 2 weeks. Both beta-blocking agents were effective in controlling hypertension with final daily doses ranging from 80 to 320 mg. Of statistical significance, however, were the better responses of supine systolic blood pressure elicited by nadolol. The only adverse reactions that occurred in this series were slight weight gains in two patients treated with nadolol and moderate dizziness in one patient treated with propranolol. Nadolol was proved to be a safe antihypertensive drug, at least comparable to propranolol in efficacy, with the advantages of a once-daily dose and a lack of direct depressant action on the heart.", 
    "1": "A beta-blocking agent, the 1,ter-butylamine3-(1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1,4-ethano-8-hydroxy-5-naphthoxy)-2-propanol (K5407) was synthesized with 14C and 3H and its pharmacokinetics in the dog and man were investigated after i.v. and oral administration. K5407 was rapidly absorbed after oral dosing and plasma peaks were within 1 hour. Concentrations of unchanged compound were found to be very small. After i.v. injection the levels decreased with a half-life of 2-3 hours. Excretion was mainly in the urine and amounted to about 72% of the dose in the dog and about 85% in man for both administration routes. Tissue radioactivity distribution studies in male and in pregnant mice after i.v. injection showed rapid body diffusion, passage through the blood-placenta barrier and no localization in the central nervous system. The metabolic process in dog and human urine was studied. Little unchanged compound was found (5% in the dog and 13% in man after i.v. injection and about 1% in both species after oral dosing). Conjugation processes represented the main route of biotransformation. Five metabolites, resulting from side chain degradation of the compound, were identified in dog urine and in trace quantities in human urine.", 
    "2": "A study was carried out in 15 adult in-patients with moderately severe hypertension to investigate the efficacy and safety of single and twice daily doses of primidolol (UK-11,443), a new antihypertensive agent with both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity. Patients received placebo for the first 3 days and then the trial drug, at a starting dosage of either 50 mg or 100 mg, for a further 4 days. There were significant decreases in baseline values for some of the cardiovascular parameters from Day 1 to Day 7, and in all the parameters (blood pressures and heart rate, lying and standing) in terms of the values 3 hours post-dose on Days 1 and 7. Probably because of the lowering of baseline values, however, the overall change in the cardiovascular parameters from baseline to 3 hours post-dose was not significantly different when primidolol and placebo were compared. The only side-effects considered to be related to primidolol were mild postural dizziness of short duration (2 patients), mild nausea (1 patient) and orthostatic vertigo (1 patient). No clinically important laboratory abnormalities occurred.", 
    "3": "Several specific and unspecific effects of penbutolol and propranolol and their optical isomers were tested in the following test models: -- The beta-sympatholytic activity in the heart of the anaesthetized dog (measurement of the contractility), -- the sympathomimetic intrinsic activity in the reserpinized rat, -- the antiarrhythmic activity in the digoxin poisoned guinea pig, the digitoxin/aconitine poisoned isolated guinea pig heart, and the cooled cat, -- the beta-sympatholytic activity together with electrophysiological effects in the isolated guinea pig papillary muscle. The antiarrhythmic effects of l-penbutolol are mainly due to its beta-sympatholytic activity. d-Penbutolol reveals only a local anaesthetic action and is otherwise nearly without pharmacological effects. In beta-sympatholysis it is 50 times less active than l-penbutolol. It has no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. It does not prolong the refractory period in the heart muscle. For this reason only l-penbutolol is proposed to be used as a beta-sympatholytic drug.", 
    "4": "The interaction of propranolol and RMI 81968 on histamine-induced bronchoconstriction was studied in the anesthetized dog using the respiratory overflow technique of Konzett and R\u00f6ssler. Propranolol, 3 and 10 mumol/kg i.v., enhanced histamine-induced bronchoconstriction. In contrast, RMI 81968, at 10 or 30 mumol/kg i.v., had no effect in this test. It is believed that the alpha-receptor blocking component of RMI 81968 prevents the bronchoconstriction induced by beta-adrenergic receptor blockade. The results of this study suggest that RMI 81968 is less likely than propranolol to produce bronchoconstriction in asthmatic patients.", 
    "5": "Pre- and postjunctional control mechanisms of the portal vein of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were characterized. Emphasis was placed on the influence of the presynaptic beta-adrenoceptor mediated mechanism for regulation of neuronal noradrenaline (NA) release (studied as tritium overflow) and its consequences for the contractile response under in vitro conditions. It was found that isoprenaline increased, whereas dl-propranolol decreased the release of neuronal NA during transmural nerve stimulation, while effector responses remained unaltered. d-Propranolol and the beta-1 selective adrenoceptor antagonist, metoprolol, did not affect these two variables. It is concluded that the presynaptic beta-adrenoceptors in the rat portal vein are mainly of the beta-2 type and mediate facilitation of neuronal transmitter release and that concomitant changes of the effector responses of this tissue are below the level of detection under the present experimental conditions.", 
    "6": "The role of the vascular factor (namely hypoperfusion) in the onset of pancreatic necrosis is a well-established fact. In the present study an analysis is made of the efficiency of drug blocking of alpha and beta adreno-receptors in the prophylaxis of acute postoperative pancreatitis, following surgery of the Oddi sphincter. Compared with a control group of 301 papillo-sphincterotomies performed in a previous period the application of adrenergic blocking in 127 patients in whom interventions were performed on the Oddi sphincter led to a significant reduction in both morbidity and mortality through acute postoperative pancreatitis, from 5 to 2,3%, and from 1,3 to 0,7% respectively.", 
    "7": "Since beta-adrenergic blockers are effective in the therapy of hypertension by a mechanism related to the degree of activation of the renin-angiotensin system, the effect of eight beta blockers was examined on angiotensin II potentiation of nerve stimulation (NS) in isolated perfused rat mesenteric vessels. The vasoconstrictor response to periarterial NS was obtained by monitoring changes in perfusion pressure while a beta blocker or a beta blocker and angiotensin II (3 ng/ml) were added to the perfusate. Although each beta blocker tended to decrease responses to NS, in the concentrations used, only metoprolol significantly inhibited responses to NS. Angiotensin II, when infused alone, potentiated the responses to NS by 63% (p less than 0.01). These enhanced responses following angiotensin II were inhibited in a dose-related manner (10--300 ng/ml) by beta 1, beta 2, and mixed beta blockers. At the 100 ng/ml concentration, DL-propranolol, timolol, metoprolol, practolol, butoxamine, and H35/25 inhibited the angiotensin II potentiation of NS by 83%, 76%, 77%, 59%, 72%, and 41% respectively. The order of potency for this action was as follows: timolol = metoprolol = butoxamine greater than propranolol greater than practolol greater than H35/25. Administration of D- and L-propranolol also reduced the responses by 75%. The vasoconstrictor responses to injected norepinephrine (NE), in the presence and absence of angiotensin II, were not altered by DL-propranolol or timolol. In conclusion, beta-adrenergic blockers were found to interfere with the effect of angiotensin II on the sympathetic neuron, a property that could contribute to the antihypertensive action of these drugs.", 
    "8": "The possible implication of the beta-sympathoadrenergic system in regulating the rhythmicity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) was studied in ten normotensive volunteers and in thirty-nine essential hypertensive patients. The study was carried out by simultaneous radioimmunological measurements of diurnal levels of plasma renin and aldosterone before and during acute oral medication of beta-adrenoceptors with propranolol. Acute beta-blockade was seen to blunt the circadian periodicity of plasma renin and aldosterone in normotensives and in hypertensives with normal or high renin patterns. Conversely propranolol was seen to be ineffective in low-renin patients. The disappearance of the circadian rhythms under beta-adrenoceptor blockade tends to suggest the existence of a beta-adrenergic control of RAAS cyclicity in normal condition, as well as in normal or high renin essential hypertension. The inefficacy of propranolol in hyporeninemic hypertensives is consistent with the hypothesis that low-renin essemtoa; juertemsopm os a state in which the sympatho beta-adrenergic mechanism controlling the function of RAAS has no biologic time structure.", 
    "9": "A total of 1,117 patients with inadequately controlled hypertension in spite of treatment with a combination of diuretic and beta-adrenergic blocker were studied. Treatment was changed to one or two tablets daily of Trasidrex (160 mg oxprenolol hydrochloride in a sustained release formulation and 0.25 mg cyclopenthiazide) with a subsequent improvement, 4 weeks later, in blood pressure control. Side-effects of treatment were uncommon and treatment was approved by the majority of patients. The majority of doctors participating thought a fixed combination would improve patient compliance with therapy.", 
    "10": "35 pregnant women were treated with the semiselective beta 2-stimulating compound fenoterol because of threatening premature labor. The efficiency of tocolysis and the cardiovascular effects of a mono-therapy with fenoterol were compared with a combined therapy with the beta 1-blocking compound metoprolol by the following parameters: Heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, left ventricular dimensions and mean Vcf as determined by echocardiography, pelvic score, tocolysis-index and tocolysis-success-score (Weidinger-score). Metoprolol caused a remarkable and highly significant reduction of the fenoterol-induced cardiac effects: increase of heart rate and augmentation of mean Vcf; the blood pressure was significantly lowered by metoprolol. The tocolytic effect of fenoterol in no respect was blunted by metoprolol.", 
    "11": "On the hypothesis that non-selective beta-blockers can antagonize or reverse the antihypertensive effect of clonidine (C), 12 hypertensive outpatients were treated with C alone and in combination with propranolol (P), atenolol (A) and prazosin (Pz). C alone (0.11 or 0.22 mg b.i.d.) or in combination with P (80 mg b.i.d.) did not provide normotension. Changing P to A (50 mg b.i.d.) reduced supine systolic and diastolic pressures, which now were significantly lower (p less than 0.01) than during C alone. Changing A to P again resulted in elevated pressures. Pz (1 mg t.i.d.) added to the C+P regimen lowered supine blood pressures to the levels otherwise recorded during C+A. C dose-dependently contracted rabbit aortic spiral in vitro, reaching about 50% of maximum responses to noradrenaline. Pz abolished this response. P (0.1--10 micrograms/ml) but not A somewhat enhanced responses to high doses of C. Sotalol rather antagonized C contractions. We conclude that A but not P enhances the antihypertensive action of C. No hypertensive interaction was observed.", 
    "12": "In order to evaluate the risks and benefits of continuing established therapy with beta-adrenergic receptor blocking drugs during acute myocardial infarction (AMI), 183 consecutive patients, 63 with (beta-blocker group) and 120 without (control group) this therapy, were studied. Detailed information on previous diseases, present symptoms, established medication, clinical and laboratory findings on admission and during the first 12 hours in the CCU was collected. The incidences of congestive heart failure, hypotension, AV blocks and ventricular arrhythmias were not significantly more common in the control group (8 vs. 28%, p less than 0.01). Thus, continuation of established therapy with beta-adrenergic receptor blocking drugs does not seem to increase the risk of complications after hospital admission for AMI. The reason for the low incidence of inferior wall infarction in the beta-blocker group is not clear but it cannot be excluded that when patients on beta-adrenergic receptor blocking therapy develop an inferior AMI, they may run a greater risk of sudden death.", 
    "13": "In order to reveal the mechanism of renin inhibition by beta adrenergic blocking agents, the effects of dl-, d-, l-propranolol and pindolol on renin release were studied. This was done by injecting them intraperitoneally or by using an in vitro system of rat kidney slices. In the in vivo study, dl-, d-, and l-propranolol inhibited plasma renin activity and renal renin content significantly in normal rats. Furthermore, in the in vitro study, the basal levels of renin in the media and that in the kidney were significantly inhibited by these agents. Pindolol also inhibited renin release, but its effects were significantly less than those of other agents. The finding that d-propranolol which has little beta adrenergic blocking action inhibited renin release, and that the effects of pindolol which displays strong beta adrenergic blocking action but little membrane stabilizing action, were less than those of other agents, may suggest that the inhibitory effects of beta adrenergic blocking agents on renin release are dependent mainly on the membrane stabilizing action rather than the beta adrenergic blocking action.", 
    "14": "Of 1302 women aged 44-66 years in a population study in G\u00f6teborg, Sweden, in 1974-75, who were representative of women of all the ages studied in the area, 165 were taking antihypertensive drugs, mostly beta-blockers and diuretics. The prevalence of sleep disturbances, nightmares, tiredness and melancholia or depression was studied in the total population sample, and a comparison was made between women who were or were not taking antihypertensive drugs. In the entire population sample no significant difference was found between the various age strata studied, although with increasing age there was a trend towards fewer complaints of nightmares, but a larger number of sleep disturbances as a whole. No difference was found between women taking or not taking various types of single-drug therapy or combinations of antihypertensive drugs.", 
    "15": "Bovine parathyroid extract and two commercial preparations containing the first 34 amino acids of synthetic bovine parathyroid hormone [bPTH-(1-34)]produced dose-related hypotension in anesthetized rats. Dogs were 10 times more sensitive to the two bPTH-(1-34) preparations than were rats. Propranolol, phentolamine, atropine, and promethazine did not affect the hypotensive action of bPTH-(1-34) in rats and dogs. bPTH-(1-34) decreased perfusion pressure in rat hindlimbs perfused in situ with Ringer's solution and was a vasodilator in dog kidneys perfused in vitro with Ringer's solution. Helical strips of rabbit aorta were also relaxed by bPTH-(1-34). We conclude that the direct vasodilatory action of bPTH preparations represents an intrinsic property of parathyroid hormone and that the hypotensive effect of this hormone is produced by part or all of the first NH2-terminal 34 amino acids.", 
    "16": "The synthesis of a series of isoelectronic analogues of (S)-2-[3-(tert-butylamino)-2-hydroxypropoxy]-3-cyanopyridine (1) are described; included in this group are examples of thiazole, isothiazole, thiadiazole, pyrazine, and the structurally related naphthyridines. All of the compounds are similar to 1 in that they contain a cyano group ortho to the aminohydroxypropoxy side chain and meta to the nitrogen heteroatom. In addition, several related examples, having additional nuclear substituents and/or groups other than CN in the position adjacent to the aminohydroxypropoxy group, were prepared, and beta-adrenoceptor antagonist activity and vasodilating potency were determined. Three compounds, thiazole 2 and isothiazoles 3 and 27, effectively lowered mean arterial pressure in the SH rat at 5 mg/kg. Compounds 2, 3, and 27 increased iliac blood flow and exhibited beta-adrenergic blocking properties in the dog.", 
    "17": "1 Activity of six beta-adrenoceptor antagonists was studied on behavioural activity (delayed differentiation) in the monkey (Macaca mulatta). The drugs, three relatively lipophilic antagonists (propranolol, oxprenolol and metoprolol), and three relatively hydrophilic antagonists (acebutolol, atenolol and sotalol), were given by intraperitoneal injection (5 to 30 mg/kg).2 With atenolol (25 to 30 mg/kg), total response time was increased, but there was no effect on the number of correct responses. With acebutolol (25 to 30 mg/kg), the number of correct responses was reduced, but there was no effect on total response time. With metoprolol (25 to 30 mg/kg), there was an increase in total response time and a decrease in the number of correct responses, and correct responses were decreased 4 h after injection over the whole dose range (5 to 30 mg/kg).3 Some animals failed to respond or complete the task with 30 mg/kg oxprenolol, 25 mg/kg sotalol and 20 mg/kg propranolol. With 25 mg/kg oxprenolol, the total response time was increased and the number of correct responses was decreased. With 5-20 mg/kg sotalol, total response time was increased, but there was no effect on the number of correct responses. With 15 mg/kg of (+/-)-propranolol and its isomers, there were increases in total response time and decreases in correct responses.4 The studies suggest that lipophilic antagonists, such as propranolol, oxprenolol and metoprolol, are likely to have, at least, effects on the central nervous system, while hydrophilic antagonists may modify the peripheral nervous system. In the dose-ranges studied, propranolol had the greatest, and atenolol and acebutolol had the least effects. Atenolol and acebutolol may prove to be particularly useful in man when disturbances of the nervous system are to be avoided.", 
    "18": "A technique for measurement of transmural bioelectric potential difference (PD) in vivo was adapted for use in mammalian airways. PD was measured between a Ringer-perfused exploring bridge positioned on the airway furface and a reference Ringer-agar bridge in the subcutaneous space. The in vivo PD of canine trachea from 50 dogs was 30.8 +/- 9.5 (SD) mV, lumen negative, indistinguishable from the peak in vitro transmural PD of the excised canine trachea. Liquid junction potentials between bridge perfusate and tracheal liquid were negligible. The response pattern to drugs applied to the mucosal surface in vivo was similar to that observed in vitro. The PD in canine bronchi 3-6 cm distal to the carina were substantially lower. Tracheal PDs of rabbit (-23 mV), guinea pig (-8 mV), and rat (-14 mV) were higher than bronchial PDs of the same species. PD across airway epithelia can be accurately and reliably measured in vivo and the lower bronchial PD suggests regional differences in electrolyte transport and/or permeability.", 
    "19": "The influence of some adrenergic drugs (fenoterol, salbutamol, terbutaline as stimulant; propranolol as blocker) on IgE production in the rat was investigated. The drugs were administered orally, mixed in the food. The stimulant drugs caused a significant decrease of total serum IgE but had no influence on the specific IgE antibody response. The beta adrenergic blocker caused a significant increase of total serum IgE but also had no influence on specific IgE. The effect of terbutaline was blocked by propranolol. No influence of these adrenergic drugs on IgA and IgM levels was observed.", 
    "20": "The effects of selective and nonselective beta adrenergic drugs on the renin secretion rate (RSR) in isolated perfused rat kidneys were studied. Both isoproterenol (Ipr) (nonselective agonist) and salbutamol (Salb) (beta-2 selective agonist) stimulated RSR in a dose-dependent manner. The lowest doses able to induce a significant RSR increase were 5 nM for Ipr and 50 nM for Salb. A 5-fold increase in RSR was induced by 500 nM Ipr and a 3.2-fold increase by 5 microM Salb. Renin stimulation by both agonists was suppressed by propranolol (nonselective) and by acebutolol and its derivative M&B 16,942 (beta-1 selective antagonists). Thus, renin release was stimulated or inhibited effectively by all the drugs tested, regardless of the beta selectivity of agonists and antagonists. There were no consistent relationships observed between changes in renal hemodynamics and in RSR, suggesting that the used drugs affected renin release from in vitro-perfused rat kidney through their direct effects on juxtaglomerular cells. These results indicate that renal beta adrenoreceptors involved in renin release do not fall into two distinct beta subtypes.", 
    "21": "Nadolol, a nonselective beta adrenoceptor antagonist, was evaluated in 9 normal sybjects with essential hypertension for ability to inhibit exercise-induced changes in double-product (systolic pressure x heart rate). Propranolol and placebo were included as positive and negative controls. The beta antagonists were administered orally in single doses at 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg on a crossover basis. Both nadolol and propranolol induced comparable dose-related inhibition of double-product. Duration of beta receptor blockade was greater with nadolol than with propranolol; significant inhibition of double-product occurred 24 hr after a single 80-mg dose of nadolol. The antihypertensive effect of nadolol was evaluated in another series of 46 subjects with essential hypertension. The dose of nadolol ranged from 80 to 320 mg once daily. Consistent decreases in supine heart rate (20%) and diastolic blood pressure (9%) from baseline were observed. During steady state, the oral daily dose of nadolol was proportional to the minimum steady-state serum concentration (Cmin) of nadolol (r = 0.75, p less than 0.001) obtained just before the next dose of nadolol. Statistically significant correlation was observed between the antihypertensive effect and the Cmin for nadolol (r = 0.45, p less than 0.05).", 
    "22": "Submaximal treadmill exercise electrocardiography and 48 hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring were performed in 30 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy both with and without beta adrenergic blocking therapy. During ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring 1 patient (3 percent) had no arrhythmia, 14 patients (46 percent) had supraventricular tachycardia or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, 13 (43 percent) had multiform or paired ventricular extrasystoles and 8 (26 percent) had ventricular tachycardia. The frequency of these ventricular arrhythmias was almost identical with and without beta adrenergic blocking drugs (mean dose in \"propranolol equivalents\" 280 mg daily). With beta blocking therapy fewer patients had supraventricular tachycardia; however, the difference was not significant. During exercise testing 18 patients (60 percent) had ventricular extrasystoles and 3 patients (10 percent) had paired ventricular extrasystoles and the frequency was almost identical with and without beta adrenergic blocking therapy. No routine echocardiographic or hemodynamic measurement predicted the serious ventricular arrhythmias. It is concluded that asymptomatic ventricular arrhythmia is a common occurrence in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and its frequency is not reduced with beta adrenergic blocking therapy. Because occult arrhythmia may be the cause of sudden death it is important to detect it in these patients so that an effort can be made to improve prognosis with specific antiarrhythmic treatment.", 
    "23": "This study was undertaken to determine the cardiovascular response to compression of the spinal cord and to determine the autonomic mechanisms involved. The electrocardiogram and arterial blood pressure were recorded in anesthetized monkeys during inflation of a balloon catheter in the epidural space of the mid-thoracic region. Acute spinal cord compression resulted in a wide variety of severe cardiac arrhythmias and acute hypertension. The arrhythmias were found to result from hyperactivity of both the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system.", 
    "24": "Three groups of patients with different premedications were examined for changes of blood pressure, heart rate, ECG and plasma free fatty acid levels during esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy: Group A was premedicated with Bunitrolol, group B was premedicated with Hyoscin-N-butyl-bromide and diazepam, group C was endoscopied without premedication. The pulse rate rose significantly less in group A than in groups A and C; the same phenomenon was observed with regard to the systolic blood pressure. Premature beats occurred in all 3 groups: 32 per cent of the patients in group A, 43 per cent in group B and 60 per cent in group C had at least occasional premature beats; an accumulation of premature beats however occurred significantly less frequently in group A than in groups B or C. A drop of the ST-part of the ECG occurred with about the same frequency in each group. An increase of the plasma free fatty acids, which was noted in groups B and C, could be observed in Group A. A pre-endoscopic medication of beta blocking agents could be a useful measure in patients with labile arterial hypertension, vegatative dysregulation and a hyperkinetic heart syndrome.", 
    "25": "The stimulation of adenylate cyclase by dopamine and various beta-adrenergic agonists has been investigated in homogenates from 3 areas of cat brain: the cerebral cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus. The purpose of the study was to determine whether the beta-arenergic receptors coupled to adenylate cyclase could be classified as either beta 1 and beta 2 subtypes in the different regions studied. The stimulation of adenylate cyclase by the beta-adrenergic agonist, (-)isoproterenol (5 X 10(-6) M), was completely blocked by the specific beta-adrenergic antagonist, (p)alprenolol (1-(-5) M), but not by the dopaminergic antagonist, fluphenazine (10(-5) M), whereas the stimulation of adenylate cyclase by (-)epinephrine (10(-4) M) was blocked to varying extents by these two drugs in each of the 3 regions studied. The (-)epinephrine effect was always blocked in the combined presence of (p)alprenolol and fluphenazine. The adenylate cyclase stimulation by (p)epinephrine which is not blocked by (p)alprenolol was due to interaction of (p)epinephrine with a dopaminergic-sensitive adenylate cyclase which has been characterized in cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum. Regional differences in the affinity of beta-adrenergic-sensitive adenylate cyclase for various agonists were investigated in the presence of fluphenazine (10(-5) M). In the cerebellum the potency order was (+/-)protokylol greater than (+/-)hydroxybenzylisoproterenol greater than (+/-)isoproterenol greater than (-)epinephrine greater than (+/-)salbutamol greater than (-)norepinephrine, indicating the presence of a beta 2-adrenergic receptor. In the cerebral cortex the potency order was (-)isoproterenol greater than +/-)protokylol greater than (+/-)hydroxybenzylisoproterenol greater than (-)epinephrine = (-)norepinephrine ((+/-)salbutamol being inactive). A similar pattern was found in the hippocampus indicating the presence of a beta 1-adrenergic receptor in these two regions. (+/-)Salbutamol was a partial agonist in the cerebellum and a competitive antagonist in the cerebral cortex. The ratio of the antagonist potencies of (+/-)practolol and (+/-)butoxamine preferential beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic antagonists respectively, to block the stimulation of adenylate cyclase was 25 in the cerebellum, compared to 0.5 in the cerebral cortex and 1.6 in the hippocampus. These results confirm the presence of a beta 2 subtype of receptor coupled to adenylate cyclase in the former and beta 1 subtypes in the latter two regions. The comparison between the affinities of a series of beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists for the beta-adrenergic receptors coupled with an adenylate cyclase in cerebral cortex and cerebellum with their affinities for well characterized beta 2-adrenergic receptors in lung and beta 1-adrenergic receptor in heart substantiated this conclusion.", 
    "26": "The Authors examine the antihypertensive effectiveness of the beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents, according to their personal experience and a review of the bibliography. It is not cleared yet how these drugs reach their hypotensive effect. It is reasonable to assume however that several factors are involved: cardiac output, intravascular volume changes, plasma renin activity and peripheral resistance. Thirty patients suffering from essential hypertension not complicated by cardiac or renale failure were treated. Patients were allocated at random into one of three subsets of ten. In group A oxprenolol was given for 8 weeks and the dose was gradually increased up to 300 mgs daily. Oxprenolol was administered in combination with clortalidone in group B and with phentolamine in group C. A clinically satisfactory reduction in blood pressure was attained in no subset, despite the significant decrease of mean blood pressure. The blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors alone has proved to be less effective than the combined administration of oxprenolol and clortalidone or of oxprenolol and phentolamine. No differences were observed between the two combinations.", 
    "27": "The effect of simultaneous administration of 250 mg L-dopa + 25 mg L-carbidopa (Nacom) and 1 mg propranolol/kg body weight (maximal dose 40 mg propranolol) on growth-hormone secretion was tested in 96 children with growth retardation. The results were compared with those in a group of children that had been receiving only L-dopa and L-carbidopa. The additional administration of propranolol reduced the number of children unresponsive to adequate growth-hormone stimulation from 16% to 9.5%. There was no significant difference in mean maximal growth-hormone level between both groups, but the addition of propranolol caused a more long-lasting rise in serum growth hormone levels. Some of the children who previously had failed to have a satisfactory rise in growth-hormone level after L-dopa and L-carbidopa showed satisfactory stimulation when propranolol was added. Since only three blood samples need be taken (0, 45 and 90 minutes) and no significant side effects were noted, the combined treatment is suitable for out-patient use.", 
    "28": "Chronic administration of the norepinephrine (NE) reuptake inhibitor nisoxetine reduced the sensitivity of the NE receptor-coupled adenylate cyclase system in rat cortex. This subsensitivity, unlike that caused by desipramine (DMI), was not related to a reduction in specific beta-adrenergic receptor binding. The specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine had no effect on either neurohormonal sensitivity or 3H-dihydroalprenolol binding.", 
    "29": "Naloxone (0.4 mg/kg, i.p.) causes an increase of cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels in the amygdala, but not in the hippocampus, caudate, or hypothalamus, of rats. The effect is antagonized by haloperidol (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) and by propranolol (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.). This is consistent with the hypothesis of a tonic inhibitory influence of endogenous opiates on central dopaminergic and beta-noradrenergic systems. Haloperidol had an effect of its own on amygdala cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels which was blocked by propranolol. This suggests the possibility of an antagonistic interaction between dopaminergic and beta-noradrenergic innervation on this structure.", 
    "30": "It has been recently reported that the levo isomer of propranolol possesses anti-serotonin properties in animals. Since harmine-induced behavioural changes in mice are reported to be mediated through central serotonergic receptors, an attempt was made to test whether 1-propranolol would also modify harmine-induced responses by virtue of its anti-serotonergic or anti-adrenergic property. The results indicated that l- and dl-propranolol inhibited central serotonin receptor mediated responses to harmine in mice, a finding that is analogous to other recent observations.", 
    "31": "Turnover of cyclic AMP was studied in intact chicken erythrocytes. Production of cyclic AMP was stimulated by adrenaline and then blocked by propranolol. The decline in the cyclic AMP concentration under these conditions is solely due to its intracellular degradation, whereas efflux of the nucleotide, although existing in these cells, does not contribute significantly to the change in its concentration. Intracellular degradation of cyclic AMP follows a first-order kinetics with a half-life of about 6 min. Similar half-lives were obtained at widely different adrenaline concentrations or when the ration of propranolol to adrenaline was varied by 25-fold. Theoretical equations were applied to calculate the rates of cyclic AMP synthesis and degradation in the intact cells under different experimental conditions. Maximal adrenaline concentrations raise the rate of cyclic AMP synthesis and its steady-state concentration by about 10-fold. The addition of caffeine causes a further 33% increase in intracellular concentration of the nucleotide, which is in good agreement with the theoretical increase computed from its slowed-down degradation.", 
    "32": "Erythroid burst forming units (BFU-E) were much more sensitive to the beta-2 selective adrenergic drug, salbutamol, than erythroid colony forming units (CFU-E) in an in vitro study of erythroid progenitor cells.", 
    "33": "Two new beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs with acute antihypertensive and positive inotropic effects are described: Compound A (2-[4-(3-tert.butylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy)phenyl]-4-trifluoromethylimidazole) and MK-761 (2-(3-tert.butylamine-2-hydroxypropoxy)-3-cyanopyridine hydrochloride). In SH rats both compounds, given orally, lowered arterial pressure and were more potent than hydralazine. The antihypertensive effect of compound A but not of MK-761 was antagonized by timolol. Both compounds had positive inotropic activity on cat heart papillary muscles; these effects were antagonized by timolol. The pretreatment of animals with reserpine greatly reduced the positive inotropic effect of MK-761 but not of compound A. The acute antihypertensive and positive inotropic effects of compound A are like to be at least partially due to stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors, e.g. intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. The effects of MK-761 on the same parameters appear to be mediated by different mechanisms.", 
    "34": "The beta-adrenergic receptor which is coupled to adenylate cyclase in the frog erythrocyte plasma membrane provides a convenient model system for probing the molecular characteristics of an adenylate cyclase coupled hormone receptor. Direct radioligand binding studies with beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists such as [3H]hydroxybenzylisoproterenol and [3H]dihydroalprenolol have shed new light on the biochemical properties of the receptor as well as on its mode of interaction with other components of the adenylate cyclase system. Agonist binding to the receptor induces a high affinity state of the receptor which can be selectively reverted to a low agonist affinity state by guanyl nucleotides. This agonist-induced high affinity state of the receptor appears to correspond to a receptor moiety which has larger apparent molecular weight and which is probably a complex of the beta-adrenergic receptor and nucleotide regulatory binding protein. Antagonists do not appear capable of inducing or stabilizing the formation of this high affinity receptor-nucleotide site complex. The beta-adrenergic receptors have been solubilized using the plant glycoside digitonin as the detergent and have been highly purified by biospecific affinity chromatography on an alprenolol-agarose affinity support. These highly purified receptor preparations retain all of the binding characteristics observed in the unpurified soluble receptor preparations. Remarkably, antibodies raised in rabbits against affinity chromatography purified preparations of the receptor, themselves bind beta-adrenergic ligands with typical beta-adrenergic specificity. Such antibodies which possess binding sites similar to those of physiological receptors provide useful model systems for further probing the molecular characteristics of beta-adrenergic binding sites.", 
    "35": "In this review, various experiments which establish the occurrence of covalent modification mechanisms, both in vivo and in vitro, in the control of acetyl-CoA carboxylase have been presented. It is interesting to note that phosphorylation of the carboxylase results in disaggregation of the active species. These studies indicate that aggregation and disaggregation of the enzyme are involved in the control of carboxylase activity. Our covalent modification mechanism and the allosteric control mechanism share a common ground in that both mechanisms affect the equilibrium between protomers and polymers of the enzyme. However, it is clear that the allosteric control mechanism cannot function alone under normal physiological conditions. Covalent modification of the carboxylase is prerequisite for efficient functioning of the allosteric mechanism. There are many aspects of the regulation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase which require further clarification. However, it is now established that short-term control of acetyl-CoA carboxylase involves the covalent modification mechanism.", 
    "36": "Six normal subjects and six normotensive insulin-dependent diabetics underwent two insulin hypoglycaemia tests after administration for three days of either a placebo or of acebutolol--a cardioselective beta-blocker--at a dose of 400 mg per day. The order in which the tests were performed was decided by random selection. Acebutolol suppressed the tachycardia which occurred as a reaction to hypoglycaemia but did not interfere with other warning symptoms and signs. In both normal subjects and diabetics, acebutolol neither worsened the initial hypoglycaemia nor did it delay a return to normal values. The increase in lactate levels following hypoglycaemia was not reduced by acebutolol but free fatty acid rebound was suppressed. Hormonal responses (glucagon, cortisol, growth hormone) were unaffected by the beta-blocker. If they are confirmed by long term studies, these results would suggest that acebutolol is safer to use than non-cardioselective beta-blockers in the treatment of coronary insufficiency and of hypertension in diabetics exposed to the risk of hypoglycaemia.", 
    "37": "Ouabain produces a greater degree of prolongation of the P-R interval than digitoxin in rats when dosages which produce similar inotropic responses are used. When digitoxin is administered after pretreatment with propranolol, it produces prolongation of the P-R interval comparable to that produced by ouabain. Indications in the literature that these findings may apply to human beings suggest that in some situations atrial fibrillation may be better controlled with a hydrophilic digitalis preparation (e.g. ouabain), whereas cardiac failure with a tendency to atrioventricular block may be better controlled with a lipophilic preparation (e.g. digitoxin).", 
    "38": "22 patients (4 female, 18 male, mean age 47 +/- 10.7 years) with severe essential hypertension (n = 21) and renovascular hypertension (n = 1) were treated with a mean daily dosage of 16.3 +/- 5.1 mg minoxidil for up to 42 weeks. In addition, all patients received a diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide or furosemide) and a beta-blocker (pindolol or propranolol). 8 patients were treated simultaneously with alpha-methyl-dopa. Within one week minoxidil led to a significant reduction in both systolic and diastolic supine blood pressure (p less than or equal to 0.005) from 201.3 +/- 29.0/125.4 +/- 19.2 mm Hg to 172.8 +/- 28.3/106.0 +/- 19.9 mm Hg. The maximum initial blood pressure response was observed after 3 weeks with a mean daily dosage of 12.2 +/- 9.4 mg of minoxidil (160.5 +/- 20.7/99.4 +/- 13.8 MM Hg, p less than or equal to 0.001). Throughout the remaining period a constant and significant reduction in supine systolic and diastolic and upright diastolic blood pressure was achieved (p less than 0.005-less than 0.001) whereas at times systolic blood pressure values could not be lowered significantly. Body weight and pulse rate showed no significant changes throughout the study. In some cases furosemide had to be added by up to 500 mg/day to counteract minoxidil induced water and salt retention. Only moderate doses of beta-blockers were required to prevent a drug induced rise in pulse rate. In these patients a significant change in renal function was not observed. The results show that minoxidil is a potent drug in the treatment of severe essential hypertension.", 
    "39": "18 patients with angina pectoris participated in a double blind trial with atenolol (100 mg and 200 mg once daily, or 100 mg twice daily) and propranolol (80 mg twice daily). The number of anginal attacks (NAP), the number of days free of pain (NAFT), consumption of sublingual nitroglycerin (NNT) and bicycle ergometry data (EFE) were recorded. Atenolol given in a dose of 100 g twice daily significantly reduced NAP and NNT as compared with the other dose schedules for atenolol and propranolol. There was, however, no difference between NAFT and EFE under any of the treatment schedules mentioned above. Only with 100 mg atenolol twice daily was it possible to reduce heart rate at rest and immediately after exercise testing, and also diastolic blood pressure (at rest, upright and after stress testing). In spite of the long plasma T 1/2 (= 24 hours) reported by others, atenolol given twice daily seems to be the most effective schedule. It is concluded that atenolol (100 mg twice daily) has a more potent anti-anginal effect than propranolol (80 mg twice daily). In addition, atenolol has the advantage of being cardioselective.", 
    "40": "Following effective long-term antihypertensive therapy, hemodialysis could be discontinued in 4 patients with malignant hypertension in view of improved renal function. Diagnoses included nephroangiosclerosis (2 cases), scleroderma and chronic glomerulonephritis. All patients had symptoms of hypertension or renal disease for at least one year prior to initiation of hemodialysis treatment. At the outset, blood pressure averaged 249 +/- 43/150 +/- 22 mm Hg (mean +/- SD) and all patients had grade IV hypertensive retinopathy. After 1 to 20 months strict blood pressure control, renal function had improved to such a degree that hemodialysis could be discontinued. One year later, blood pressure averaged 138 +/- 20/89 +/- 6 mm Hg and serum creatinine 3,2 +/- 1,2 mg/100 ml. These data suggest that in hypertensive patients with chronic renal failure, strict control of blood pressure is of the utmost importance whatever the severity and nature of the underlying renal disease.", 
    "41": "Treatment of hypertension is still primarily relevant of drug therapy. Prolonged use of antihypertensive agents is undoubtedly efficient but may induce when discontinued occasionally or intentionally a true rebound phenomenon i.e. exacerbation or aggravation of the pretreatment morbid condition. Hypertensive rebound occurs almost exclusively after clonidine withdrawal, usually abrupt but sometimes gradual. It consists of an acute clinical syndrome together with well defined biological findings, related to reactional enhanced sympathetic activity and necessitating an emergency treatment. A different rebound phenomenon is observed on withdrawal of some antihypertensive drugs when used in the management of coronary heart disease, namely beta adrenergic receptors blockers and specially propranolol. An acute exacerbation of coronary symptoms with or without severe arrythmias and eventually sudden deaths have been reported. The mechanisms responsible of this event are described, mainly the modifications recently observed at the level of the adrenoreceptors themselves. These two rebound phenomena although rare should be considered seriously by the practitioner while prescribing antihypertensive or antiangorous drugs otherwise very efficient but alble to induce catastrophic symptoms when interrupted in certain circumstancy.", 
    "42": "Intrastriatal injection of kainic acid (5 nmoles) to rats led to severe destruction of nerve cell bodies throughout the caudate-putamen complex and an extensive proliferation of glial cells. Lesioned striata displayed a significant 23% loss of beta-adrenoceptor binding sites 21--24 days after injection of kainic acid. Further analysis of these changes revealed that this loss of sites was selectively within the beta 1 receptor population. Although these results do not rule out a partial glial cell localisation for beta-adrenoceptors, they do indicate that at least a proportion of beta 1 receptors are present on striatal perikarya.", 
    "43": "The effects of dimethylsulfoxide, propranolol and chlorpromazine on the partial reactions of the ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum were investigated. When analyzed according to a reaction scheme in which the ADP-sensitive (E1P) and ADP-insensitive (E2P) phosphoenzymes occur sequentially and P1 is derived from the latter, dimethylsulfoxide decreased the rate of E2P hydrolysis whereas it stimulated the rate of the E1P to E2P conversion. Propranolol increased the rate of E2P hydrolysis while it decreased the rate of the E1P to E2P conversion. Propranolol exerted an additional effect, presumably inhibition of the phosphoenzyme formation. These effects of dimethylsulfoxide and propranolol can account for both the stimulatory and inhibitory effects of these drugs on the overall rate of ATP hydrolysis observed in the presence and absence of added alkali metal salts. Chlorpromazine accelerated E2P hydrolysis whereas it appeared to inhibit the E1P to E2P conversion. These effects of chlorpromazine appear able to account for its stimulatory and inhibitory effects on the overall rate of ATP hydrolysis in the presence and absence of alkali metal salts. In the presence of chlorpromazine, however, the rate of Pi liberation during the steady state ATP hydrolysis was found to be greater than the hydrolysis rate of E2P. This finding suggests that under these conditions Pi is derived not only from E2P but also from source(s) other than E2P.", 
    "44": "Collagenase-isolated pancreatic islets of non-inbred ob/ob mice, containing more than 90% beta-cells, were labelled with radioactive orthophosphate (32P or 33P) and then subjected to non-recirculating perifusion. The basal D-glucose concentration in the perifusion medium was 2.8 mM. When the concentration was suddenly raised to 5.6, 8.3 or 16.7 mM, D-glucose promptly elicited a transient and dose-dependent release of radiophosphate. In the presence of 2.8 mM D-glucose, 0.1 mM of the poorly permeating sulphydryl blocker, chloromercuribenzene-p-sulphonic acid, also evoked a phosphate flush resembling the one induced by D-glucose. The basal radiophosphate release was partially inhibited by 1 mM 4-acetamido-4-'-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulphonic acid. However, the phosphate flush induced by 16.7 mM D-glucose was not noticeably inhibited by 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulphonic acid. It is concluded that the phosphate flush emanates from beta-cells and that membrane sulphydryl groups may participate in its regulation. Although at least the basal phosphate release may in part represent transmembrane transport through 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulphonic acid-sensitive anion channels, other mechanisms are also likely to participate in the glucose-induced phosphate flush.", 
    "45": "In a randomized, blind clinical study, we tested the effect of timolol and Daranide against placebo medications among patients who had intraocular pressures greater than 30 mm Hg on the first postoperative day after aphakic keratoplasty. The study failed to show any significant difference in the pressure course. We concluded that because this type of severe secondary glaucoma is extremely difficult to treat, it should be prevented by using a donor cornea larger in size than the recipient bed.", 
    "46": "Six manic patients were treated with high doses of d-propranolol or d- and dl-propranolol in a double-blind, placebo controlled study. The following variables were measured: propranolol dosage, propranolol serum concentration, pulse frequency, blood pressure, and psychotic behavior. In all cases an improvement was noticed. High dosages were necessary to obtain sufficient effect. The antimanic property of d-propranolol was approximately 50% smaller than the antimanic property of dl-propranolol. We conclude that at least some part of the antimanic action of beta-blockers is independent from the beta-blocking property.", 
    "47": "Two thyrotoxic patients with significant hypercalcaemia are described. The hypercalcaemia failed to suppress with hydrocortisone, propranolol and calcitonin but serum calcium fell rapidly to normal with carbimazole treatment. Both patients were subsequently treated surgically and at operation no evidence of parathyroid disease was found. Thyroid disease must be controlled before co-existing parathyroid disease is diagnosed in hypercalcaemic thyrotoxic patients.", 
    "48": "A patient prescribed timolol maleate for the control of hypertension developed dryness of the eyes. The symptoms improved on withdrawal of the drug. Vigilance for such adverse reactions must be observed in the use of any beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agent."
