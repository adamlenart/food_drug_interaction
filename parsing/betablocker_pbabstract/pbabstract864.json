    "0": "Oxprenolol, a new beta-receptor blocking drug with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, was used to treat 63 episodes of cardiac arrhythmia occurring in 43 patients with acute myocardial infarction or myocardial ischaemia. The drug was most effective in abolishing ventricular ectopic beats and supraventricular tachycardia. The best method of administration was by continuous intravenous infusion and the most satisfactory bolus does was 6 mg. The main side effect was hypotension, which occurred in 59% of episodes of arrhythmia that had responded previously to intravenous administration. Oxprenolol was often effective in lignocaine-resistant arrhythmia. The two main advantages of oxprenolol over propranolol are the reduced likelihood of adversely affecting myocardial function and the diminished tendency to produce bronchospasm.", 
    "1": "Adrenergic and cholinergic agonists and antagonists were applied microelectrophoretically to over 700 neurons in the cat supraoptic nucleus, 20 percent of which were antidromically identified as neurosecretory cells. Norepinephrine uniformly depressed all sensitive cells. Acetylcholine caused both muscarinic depression and nicotinic excitation which were antagonized by atropine and dihydro-beta-erythroidine, respectively. These results support the hypothesis that norepinephrine and acetylcholine are directly involved in controlling the release of antidiuretic hormone."
