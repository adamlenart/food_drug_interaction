This therapy is based upon data which maintain that the burned organism passes through a beta-modulated adrenergic receptor state as a result of the endocrine changes taking place between the 3rd and the 5th post-burn day. The author describes his own positive experiences of beta-adrenergic blocking therapy. The possible contra-indications (obstructive lung diseases, shock) to this therapy are discussed. Finally he draws attention to some of the side effects which were observed (E.C.G. conduction disturbances).", 
    "1": "The effects of procaine on the contractility of the bullfrog's ventricular muscle were investigated. The addition of 10(-5) g/ml of procaine potentiated the twitch tension which was accompanied by an elevation as well as a prolongation of the action potential plateau. This positive inotropism of procaine was not induced by endogenous catecholamine because a beta-blocking agent did not influence this twitch potentiation. The twitch potentiation was increased in proportion to the external Ca concentration, suggesting the possibility of augmentation of Ca influx during the action potential. In normal Ringer solution, procaine suppressed potassium contracture which was composed of two components: an initial phasic component and a late tonic one. Potassium contracture after perfusion with Ca-free solution was also suppressed by procaine. However, potassium contracture which had been treated previously with La was composed of only a tonic component and was potentiated by procaine in spite of perfusion with Ca-free solution. The tonic component of potassium contracture may be considered to occur with intracellular Ca. Procaine may increase the Ca inward current, acting on the intracellular Ca storage site and consequently accelerate the excitation-contraction coupling in frog ventricular muscle.", 
    "2": "The effects of adrenergic antagonists on the humoral immune response of rabbits to egg albumin was studied. Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist, when administered at a dosage of 20 mg/kg of body weight, enhanced both passive hemagglutinating and IgE (passive cutaneous anaphylaxis) antibody formation. Phenoxybenzamine, an alpha-antagonist, at 0.4--40 mg/kg had a similar adjuvant effect. A marked delay in the immune response was noted with high dosages of phenoxybenzamine. Possible mechanisms of the adjuvant effects of these drugs are discussed.", 
    "3": "In ten angina patients responding with a myocardial anaerobic metabolic pattern to isoproterenol infusion, a new beta-blocking agent, bunitrolol, was effective in normalizing the myocardial lactate extraction ratio. The correlation with lipid metabolism was also interesting because beta-blocker action reduced significantly arterial non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) level as well as myocardial NEFA extraction. The metabolic behavior suggests the effectiveness of bunitrolol in the treatment of ischemic heart disease.", 
    "4": "Mice administered haloperidol 3 mg/kg/day in their drinking water for 21 days were tested for their locomotor responsiveness to saline or acid vehicle, dl-, l- or d-propranolol, metoprolol, butoxamine or practolol. Haloperidol-treated animals administered saline or acid-vehicle were, in five of six experiments, more active than animals withdrawn from vehicle-treatment. Haloperidol- and vehicle-treated animals responded differently to the non-selective beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists (dl-propranolol and l-propranolol) and selective beta1-adrenoreceptor antagonists (practolol and metoprolol), but not to a selective beta2-adrenoreceptor antagonist (butoxamine). With dl-propranolol (4 mg/kg) the locomotor activity of haloperidol-treated animals was significantly (0.01 less than P less than 0.02) greater than that of the vehicle-treated animals. Similar effects in the same direction were seen with l-propranolol (1 mg/kg, 0.005 less than P less than 0.01), practolol (10 and 100 mg/kg, 0.025 less than P less than 0.05 and 0.01 less than P less than 0.025 respectively) and metoprolol 8 mg/kg, 0.005 less than P less than 0.01). The d-isomer of propranolol which is about 50 times less active as a beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist than the l-isomer, although having equal membrane stabilizing effects, did not differentially affect haloperidol- or vehicle-treated groups. The results suggest that there has been a change in beta 1-adrenoreceptor responsiveness in animals withdrawn from long-term haloperidol treatment.", 
    "5": "Two novel beta-adrenergic myocardial stimulants of general structure: Formula: (see text), where R is a phenyl or benzyl group were investigated for their ability to stimulate and desensitize the cyclic AMP response of C6 glioma cells. Compound ICI 89, 963 (R:phenyl) which elicited less than 1% of the maximum increase in cAMP produced by isoproterenol, was strikingly effective as a desensitizer of the isoproterenol response. This desensitization was markedly reduced by propranolol. Compound ICI 119,033 (R: benzyl) which was a more effective stimulant of cAMP synthesis than ICI 89,963, was also a more effective desensitizer of the isoproterenol response of C6 cells. The kinetics of the desensitization by ICI 89,963 were comparable with those for isoproterenol reaching a maximum in 2 to 3 hours. The data indicate that beta-adrenergic agonists are more potent as desensitizers of the cyclic AMP response than as stimulants of that response.", 
    "6": "In a large series of patients who have abused a variety of commercially available \"amphetamine-like\" agents as well as \"street drugs\" with CNS stimulant activity, the specific lytic effects of propranolol (Inderal) were utilized to reverse the dangerous hyperkinetic cardiovascular and frightening CNS phenomena noted in these non-comatose individuals. Presented here is a logical and clinically proven mode of therapy by which the authors have consistently, successfully, and safely managed such patients in \"adrenergic crisis\" by judicious titration of electrolytes, propranolol, and diazepam.", 
    "7": "This study was carried out to determine whether beta blockers could be prescribed for patients with coronary insufficiency and chronic bronchitis. The effects of intravenous infusions (30 mn) of propranolol (30 micrograms/kg), practolol 90 micrograms/kg), atenolol (90 micrograms/kg) and acebutolol (150 micrograms/kg) on vital capacity and expiratory flow rates were investigated in chronic bronchitics. Propranolol (n = 51) moderately reduced the vital capacity and FEV1, by an average 9% and a maximum of 20%. The three other infused agents given to groups of 10 patients did not change the ventilatory function. When the same patients were investigated by cross over with propranol bronchoconstriction was observed. This effect was seen in all stages of chronic bronchitis but was much less severe than in a group of 50 asthmatic patients (-23%). The respiratory tolerance of the cardioselective beta blockers seems to be better but there is considerable individual variation and the diagnosis between asthma and chronic bronchitis may itself be very difficult.", 
    "8": "Buffering of alpha-receptor-mediated pressor responses by beta-adrenergic or cholinergic vasodilation in tranquilized, chronically instrumented gos was investigated. Increases in aortic pressure were produced in the same animal by intravenous injections of phenylephrine in the control state and in three successive experimental states by 1) pacing the heart to remove the reflex capability to lower heart rate, 2) pacing the heart and beta-blockade to remove beta-adrenergic vascular buffering, and 3) beta-blockade plus atropine to also remove cholinergic vascular buffering. The pressor response in each experimental state was greater than that in the state preceding it. With the combined beta-adrenergic and cholinergic blockade, the pressor response to an alpha-receptor stimulation was three times greater than that of the control state. From an analysis of the components of the pressor response, cardiac output, and peripheral resistance, it is suggested that normal buffering of an alpha-mediated pressor response may include beta-adrenergic and cholinergic vascular dilation in addition to a decrease in heart rate.", 
    "9": "Blood platelets play a decisive role in haemostasis and thrombosis. Besides the known approaches for preventing thrombosis by inhibition of the plasmatic coagulation, it seems promising to prevent thrombus formation, particularly in the arterial vasculature, by pharmacological control of platelet functions. Drugs with antiaggregating effects are described from the clinico-pharmacological point of view. Non-steroidal antiphlogistics - especially acetylsalicylic acid - several vasodilators, alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor blockers, as well as some others have been used therapeutically. To test these drugs for the prophylaxis of thrombosis, long-term prospective clinical trials are necessary.", 
    "10": "Twenty-six patients with severe coronary artery disease, receiving long term beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs were anaesthetised for aorto-coronary bypass operations. Beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs were withdrawn 2 to 8 days before surgery in ten patients only. In the remaining sixteen patients there were no serious complications due to the presence of a degree of beta-blockade during anaesthesia and surgery. The undesirable cardiovascular responses to laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation were diminished in these patients, and the rise in heart rate/systolic pressure product, and indicator of myocardial oxygen consumption, was less in this group. The need for peripheral vasodilators to treat systemic arterial pressure rises in response to surgery was also reduced. There appeared to be no contraindication to the continuation of beta-adrenoceptor blockade before operation in patients undergoing aorto-coronary bypass procedures when suitable anaesthetic agents were selected and when an appropriate blood volume was maintained.", 
    "11": "Urotensin I (UI) was found to elicit dose-related relaxation responses in isolated helical strips of the rat tail artery. The responses were not prevented by adrenergic, cholingergic or histaminergic blocking agents. Competitive and non-competitive components of antagonism were observed to noradrenaline-, 5-hydroxytryptamine-, and arginine vasopressin-induced contractions. Atropine caused a direct relaxation of the isolated vascular tissues, as well as a significant potentiation of UI responses.", 
    "12": "Immobilization for 30 min induced a significant rise of prolactin (Prl), a significant reduction of growth hormone (GH), and no modification of plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) values in male rats. Depletion of brain catecholamine stores increased Prl and decreased LH levels while GH secretion was not affected. Blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors reduced GH and increased LH values. Plasma GH levels were also drastically reduced by depletion of brain serotonin (SER) levels and by atropine, and were increased by blockade of the H1 histamine (HIS) receptor. The anti-gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agent picrotoxin significantly reduced Prl and GH plasma levels. Depletion of brain catecholamine stores or blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors antagonized the restraint-induced rise of plasma Prl values, while the decrease of GH elicited by stress was not modified by any pharmacological manipulation. These results indicate that although several putative neurotransmitters (PN) of the central nervous system (CNS) are implicated in the modulation of baseline levels of Prl, GH and LH, only the stress-induced activation of Prl secretion appears to be mediated by a PN, namely through a noradrenergic, beta-adrenergic route.", 
    "13": "Twenty-nine anginal patients were randomly allocated to nadolol once daily, or propranolol four times daily and titrated to optimum dosage over 14 weeks under double-blind conditions: all patients then continued on nadolol once daily. Efficacy was assessed by numbers of anginal attacks and nitroglycerin (GTN) usage, and exercise EKG on the bicycle ergometer. Results showed the two drugs to have similar effects regarding anginal attacks and GTN consumption, but nadolol produced better performance in exercise time. In the extended treatment period on nadolol, the improvements over baseline readings were maintained. No serious side-effects or laboratory abnormalities were encountered.", 
    "14": "Nadolol, a new beta-blocker that is not metabolized and has a uniquely long pharmacological half-life (up to 24 hours) was employed as the sole drug therapy for thirty-one patients with mild to moderately severe essential hypertension. Twenty-two patients had a reduction over 3 months of 10% or more in supine diastolic pressure, including twelve who became normotensive. Daily dosage, administered in two divided doses, ranged up to 640 mg; however, twenty patients required 160 mg or less. Twenty-three patients continued therapy for a median additional period of 15 months, during which satisfactory control was maintained in seventeen patients. Side-effects of nadolol caused termination of therapy in only one patient.", 
    "15": "The pancreatic secretion of fluid, bicarbonate and protein in response to electrical stimulation of the vagus and splanchnic nerves, to exogenous and endogenous secretin and to various pharmacological agents was studied in anesthetized young pigs (21 kg). Vagal stimulation increased flow, bicarbonate output and protein output in a frequency dependent manner; the half maximal effective frequency was 2--4 Hz and the maximal effective frequency 12 Hz. The secretory response to vagal stimulation was potentiated by physiological elevations of the arterial concentration of secretin brought about by injection of secretin or by acidification of the duodenal bulb. Simultaneous stimulation of the splanchnic nerves strongly inhibited the response to vagal stimulation; splanchnic nerve stimulation alone had no demonstrable effect. The flow and bicarbonate response to vagal stimulation was unaffected by atropine, but abolished by hexamethonium. Protein output was strongly inhibited by both agents. The response to intraarterial infusion of acetylcholine resembled that elicited by vagal stimulation but it was smaller and it was completely abolished by atropine and unaffected by hexamethonium. Alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade stimulated rather than inhibited the secretory response to vagal stimulation. The portal vein plasma concentration of secretin was not affected by vagal stimulation. The results indicate that the protein response, and the flow and bicarbonate response to vagal stimulation are not brought about by the same mechanism. An increased release of secretin is not involved. Peptidergic (VIP-containing) nerves may contribute.", 
    "16": "1. The classical single receptor competitive occupancy model accurately describes the joint action of an agonist (isoprenaline) and a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist (propranolol) or some partial agonists (dichlorisoprenaline, practolol) on the positive chronotropic response in rats which have been depleted of catacholamines. 2. The mathematical form of the model suggests that the dissociation constants of classical competitive partial agonists may be assessed using dose ratios by exactly the same method as that currently used for agonist-antagonist interactions, provided that the log dose-response curves are first suitably normalized. 3. Close agreement between the theoretical mathematical models and the experimental data can be demonstrated by statistical fitting for certain beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (propranolol, dichlorisoprenaline, practolol). 4. The model fails to describe the behaviour of other beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (oxprenolol, pindolol). A possible extension of the model to include these drugs is proposed.", 
    "17": "1. The effects of propranolol, atenolol (ICI 66,082), practolol and pindolol on heart rate and maximal left ventricular dp/dt, atrioventricular conduction time, mean aortic flow and diastolic blood pressure during cardiac pacing were investigated over a wide dose range (0.025-4.0 mg/kg, i.v.) in dogs anaesthetized with pentobarbitone.2. Propranolol and atenolol produced similar reductions in haemodynamic parameters. Propranolol had no further effect in dogs pretreated with atenolol. 3. Practolol tended to cause smaller reductions in the haemodynamic parameters than either propranolol or atenolol. Subsequent administration of propranolol still had some depressant activity. 4. Pindolol produced a biphasic response, with depression of cardiac function at the low doses (0.025 and 0.1 mg/kg), but a reversal of effect as the dose was increased. 5. It is therefore concluded that, in anaesthetized dogs, the intrinsic activity of practolol and pindolol limits the fall in heart rate, cardiac conduction, aortic flow and maximal dp/dt observed with beta-adrenoceptor blockade. With pindolol, however, the influence of intrinsic activity is observed only in high doses related to beta-adrenoceptor blockade.", 
    "18": "1. The intrinsic sympathomimetic activity of a range of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists and its relationship to beta-adrenoceptor blockade was studied in pentobarbitone-anaesthetized, vagotomized rats which had been depleted of catecholamines by pretreatment with syrosingopine. Dichlorisoprenaline, practolol, oxprenolol, pindolol and acebutolol, produced dose-dependent positive chronotropic responses in this preparation. 2. The relationship between the dose requirements for this intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and beta-adrenoceptor-blocking activity was not the same for all drugs: (i) dichlorisoprenaline and practolol had intrinsic activity at all beta-adrenoceptor-blocking doses; and (ii) oxprenolol, pindolol and acebutolol had predominantly beta-adrenoceptor blockade at the lower dose levels and agonist activity only became significant at high doses relative to those producing beta-adrenoceptor blockade. 3. The positive chronotropic response to both practolol and pindolol was observed in rats which had been pithed and was antagonized by propranolol (0.1-3.0 mg/kg, i.v.), indicating that beta-adrenoceptors were involved. 4. It was concluded that the intrinsic sympathomimetic activity of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists was not a simple property as it was described by the relationship between the dose requirements for intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and for beta-adrenoceptor blockade as well as the degree of partial agonist activity.", 
    "19": "Increasing amounts of Digoxin, Lasix, Teofyllamin and CI-775 were added to human blood in vitro and the whole blood oxygen affinity was measured. We found no definite proof that any of the drugs was able to affect the oxygen affinity of the red cells even at unphysiologically high concentrations.", 
    "20": "The object of this study was to establish whether cardioselectivity of atenolol confers any advantage over noncardioselective beta-blockade in the treatment of hypertension. A dose of atenolol was established on the basis of morning mean systolic blood pressure (mean of 5 readings) in 27 long-standing hypertensive patients previously controlled on one of three nonselective beta-blockers: propranolol, oxprenolol, or pindolol. Most patients were also taking a diuretic. A crossover trial was then conducted of atenolol and the previous nonselective beta-blocker, each drug being given for 8 wk in randomized order. Other drugs were kept constant. At the end of each 8-wk period a morning test of blood pressure and pulse rate was done, an 11:30 A.M. blood sample was taken for estimation of drug concentration, and spirometry was performed. During the eighth week a glucose tolerance test, fasting lipids, and other biochemical and hematologic estimations were done. On a separate occasion a late morning study was done on the response of blood pressure and pulse rate to three kinds of stress: bicycle ergometer, mental arithmetic, and handgrip. At dosage levels of atenolol giving a mean resting systolic blood pressure equal to that during nonselective beta-blockade, diastolic levels on atenolol tended to be lower at rest and during the mental and handgrip forms of stress. Serum creatinine levels on atenolol were lower than during nonselective beta-blockade. Anti-dioxyribonucleic acid (DNA) titers remained normal in all patients. There was no difference in lung function. There was little difference in glucose and insulin levels during glucose tolerance tests in these patients, half of whom were diabetic. There were no serious side effects but there were a few surprising ones such as vivid dreams in three and muscle cramps in one patient.", 
    "21": "The influence exerted by stimulation of the anterior hypothalamus (zone of cholinergic vasodilatation) on the performance of triceps surae during tetanic contraction has been investigated. Hypothalamic stimulation, if combined with indirect muscle stimulation, improves muscle performance, i.e. slows down the rate of decrease of contraction. The effect is abolished by atropine (0.5 mg/kg) and insensitive to propanolol (0.1 mg/kg). The cholinergic influence is only effective if hypothalamic stimulation coincides with the beginning of motor nerve stimulation. In some of our experiments stimulation of the same central structures elicited another influence on muscle performance, associated with the release of adrenaline into the blood. In this case, contrary to the cholinergic influence, the force of contraction increases only when hypothalamic stimulation does not start earlier than 100 s after the initiation of contraction (phase of slow decline of tension). The effect is insensitive to atropine (0.1 mg/kg) and abolished by propanolol (0.1 mg/kg).", 
    "22": "To assess the importance of disease-induced increases in plasma concentrations of alpha1 acid glycoprotein (an acute-phase plasma protein that binds cationic drugs), we determined binding of propranolol in plasma from 53 patients and 25 healthy volunteers. Binding was increased in 10 patients with Crohn's disease (P less than 0.002), nine with inflammatory arthritis (P less than 0.002) and eight with chronic renal failure with superimposed inflammatory disease (P less than 0.01) as compared with healthy controls. The plasma binding of control subjects did not differ from that of 12 patients with chronic hepatic disease (P greater than 0.45) or 14 with uncomplicated renal failure (P greater than 0.80). Chlorpromazine binding, determined in 60 subjects, yielded similar results. Percentage of free drug and alpha1 acid glycoprotein concentration were inversely correlated (r = -0.77 with propranolol, P less than 0.001, and r = -0.69 with chlorpromazine, P less than 0.001). Increases in plasma protein binding in patients with inflammatory disease appear mediated by increases in alpha1 acid glycoprotein concentration, which may influence drug kinetics.", 
    "23": "Binding sites for iodohydroxybenzylpindolol with characteristics of a beta2-adrenergic receptor have been identified in a crude membrane fraction from guinea-pig lung. The binding sites could be solubilized by treatment of the membrane fraction with digitonin. Upon solubilization receptors retain their beta2-adrenergic type as indicated by the rank order of potencies of agonists in binding-inhibition experiments. The solubilized receptors demonstrate a marked increase in affinity for agonists compared with particulate receptors whereas antagonist affinity remains unchanged. Solubilized receptors are insensitive to divalent cations (Mg2+, Mn2+, Ca 2+) which increase the potency of agonists for particulate receptors. The effects of Mg2+ can be reversed by Gpp(NH)p in particulate preparations; Gpp(NH)p is ineffective for the solubilized preparation. These experiments establish that beta-adrenergic receptors can be solubilized even from crude mammalian membrane preparations. They also show that the mammalian beta-adrenergic receptor in situ is under constraints with respect to agonist affinity and is modulated by divalent cations and guanyl nucleotides in the intact membrane.", 
    "24": "32 patients with moderate or severe hypertension (16 men and 16 women, aged 32--75 years) were treated with alpha-methyldopa (daily dose: 750 mg) + placebo for 2 weeks, then with alpha-methyldopa + pindolol (15--45 mg daily) for 12 weeks. These patients had been under alpha-methyldopa monotherapy before the trial with unsatisfactory results. The simultaneous administration of alpha-methyldopa and pindolol considerably decreased the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, both sitting and standing, and the heart rate. The combination of methyldopa and pindolol was significantly more effective than methyldopa alone.", 
    "25": "Fenoterol is used in patients with premature labor to delay delivery. A young women treated with fenoterol developed severe generalized myotonia. Symptoms disappeared after medication had been stopped. In a later study myotonic discharges were found electromyographically in the muscles of the patient and her brother. Both suffered from subclinical recessive myotonia congenita (Becker). A heterozygous manifestation may be supposed.", 
    "26": "The ability of a series of adrenergic agents to displace the binding to brain membranes of [3H]WB 4101, a potent alpha-adrenergic antagonist (WB 4101 = 2-[2-(2,6-dimethoxyphenoxy)ethylaminomethyl]-1,4-benzodioxane hydrochloride), has been compared with the potency of these agents in stimulating or inhibiting the alpha-adrenergic component of cyclic AMP accumulation in rat cerebral cortex slices. [3H]WB 4101 rapidly bound to a high affinity site (KD = 2.7 nM) in membranes from cerebral cortex. Binding came to equilibrium by 2 min at 37 degrees C and was rapidly reversed in the presence of phentolamine. The potencies of adrenergic agents (WB 4101 greater than phentolamine greater than naphazoline) in displacing binding of [3H]WB 4101 were comparable to the potencies of these agents as inhibitors of the alpha-adrenergic component of norepinephrine-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulations. Phenoxybenzamine, clonidine, chlorpromazine and haloperidol were about 10--30 times more potent in inhibiting cyclic AMP accumulation than in displacing [3H]WB 4101 binding. The potency of classical alpha-adrenergic agonists in displacing WB 4101 (epinephrine greater than norepinephrine greater than methoxamine) correlated with the ability of these agonists to increase cyclic AMP levels. Overall a significant correlation (r = 0.87, P less than 0.005) was found between WB 4101 binding and alpha-adrenergically mediated cyclic AMP accumulation in brain. Several ligands bind to specific sites in brain membranes with alpha-adrenergic receptor properties. The identification of these binding sites as receptors depends on a correlation of binding with a known alpha-adrenergic receptor-mediated response in brain. These data demonstrating that WB 4101 correlates with norepinephrine-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation suggest that WB 4101 may bind to the membrane receptor sites mediating the alpha-adrenergic accumulation of cyclic AMP in rat cerebral cortex.", 
    "27": "The plasma kinetics of timolol administered orally and intravenously to 5 male subjects were examined. Bioavailability was reduced by 25% when the drug was taken orally. Mean plasma half-life after oral dosing was 4.86 h, and after intravenous administration it was 4.56 h; the difference was not significant. The volume of distribution was 3.5 1/k. It is suggested that timolol is little affected by the 'first pass effect', even though there is marked interindividual variation in availability and peak plasma level.", 
    "28": "An improvement in the prognosis of myocardial infarction has been reported after long term treatment with alprenolol 200 mg twice daily. Therefore, an experiment was carried out to find the dose of pindolol given once daily which would show cardiac beta-adrenoceptor blockade at least equipotent to that obtained during treatment with alprenolol 200 mg twice daily. Cardiac beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity and its time course during treatment with pindolol (15 mg and 20 mg given once daily) and alprenolol (200 mg given 12-hourly) for three days were compared in 6 healthy volunteers. The reduction in exercise-induced tachycardia as a measure of cariac beta-adrenoceptor blockade was significantly greater after pindolol 15 mg and 20 mg than after alprenolol 200 mg. On the morning of the fourth day, i.e. 24 h after the last dose of pindolol and only 12 h after the last dose of alprenolol, the effects of pindolol at both dose levels were slightly greater than those of alprenolol. This difference was not statistically significant. It can be concluded that pindolol 15 mg once daily produces a cardiac beta-adrenoceptor blockade at least equipotent to that of alprenolol 200 mg given 12-hourly.", 
    "29": "In a model system the influence of mental stress on blood pressure and heart rate was studied in normal persons and in patients with hypertension (WHO grade III). Metoprolol was employed to investigate the preventive effect of beta-adrenergic blockade on the response to stress. In all groups blood pressure increased significantly during mental stress. The effect was not inhibited by metoprolol. The rise in heart rate, however, was depressed by beta-blockade. Reaction time, opticomotor coordination and concentration ability were studied as parameters of vigilance, but no significant difference between the metoprolol and control groups were observed. Thus, metoprolol only influenced the heart rate in mental stress and it did not affect vigilance.", 
    "30": "The beta-adrenergic blocking drug, timolol, was combined with bendrofluazide in a comparative trial between once and twice daily dosage, conducted on 51 patients suffering from hypertension seen in general practice. During the initial control period seven of these patients became normotensive, leaving 44 who entered the trial. Using a crossover design, treatment was continued for a total period of up to 16 weeks. With both dose regimes, systolic and diastolic pressures were rendered normotensive in over three-quarters of the patients, significant reductions occurring within the first two to four weeks of treatment.", 
    "31": "20 patients (12 female) with moderately severe essential hypertension [blood pressure during placebo treatment 181 +/- 6 (systolic), 107 +/- 3 (diastolic)] completed a double-blind, cross-over dose-titrated comparison of labetalol and methyldopa. Both drugs reduced lying and standing arterial blood pressure to a similar extent, although only labetalol reduced heart rate. Compliance was high (greater than 95%) with both drugs, and the incidence of subjective adverse effects was similar.", 
    "32": "In a 10-week double-blind study, 283 hypertensive patients were treated with a beta-blocker (timolol) alone, a combination of two diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide + amiloride) or a combination of both types of treatment. The results on blood pressure figures were very much in favor of the combination therapy as compared to monotherapy. In a second step, the trial was unblinded and all patients continued with the beta-blocker/diuretic combination for a total of 24 weeks. The medium-term results confirmed those obtained during the double-blind study with regard to the effectiveness and good tolerance of the combination treatment.", 
    "33": "The authors relate two cases of idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis detected after orthostatic hypotension with syncope. This type of detection has not been described till now. Relations between idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis and orthostatic hypotension are debated as well as relation between IHSS and systemic hypertension which has existed previously in the two cases. It seems suitable to call up IHSS systematically before every orthostatic hypotension at least in elderly. Beta-blockers can in such cases considerably improve orthostatic symptoms.", 
    "34": "The effects on feeding of perifornical hypothalamic injection of catecholamines, amphetamines and mazindol were examined in hungry rats. In pargyline-pretreated subjects, both dopamine and epinephrine significantly suppressed food intake, at doses as low as 31 ng for dopamine and 150 ng for epinephrine (the latter injected with an alpha-adrenoceptor blocker). This effect was reliably strengthened by inhibiting catecholamine deamination or presynaptic catecholamine uptake. Perifornical injections of amphetamine, mazindol, methamphetamine, and phenmetrazine also suppressed feeding. The magnitude of this effect in individual animals was positively correlated with the effect produced by catecholamine agonists. Moreover, this effect of mazindol was partially antagonized by perifornical injection of dopaminergic and beta-adrenoceptor blockers. The effects of amphetamine and epinephrine were abolished by these drugs, while dopamine's effect was selectively inhibited by the dopaminergic antagonist. Serotonergic antagonists produced no change. These findings lend support to the hypothesis that perifornical hypothalamic catecholamine neurons, through dopaminergic receptors and beta-adrenoceptors, are involved in inhibiting feeding behavior, as well as in mediating the anorexic action of the amphetamines and mazindol.", 
    "35": "Studies with interference contrast microscopy reveal that platelets undergo a typical shape change within 30--60' after venepuncture, i.e. swelling, formation of large tentacles, tiny protrusions and vesicles at the platelet surface. This \"shape change\" can be observed in citrated blood and PRP, heparinized blood and EDTA-blood as well. It is enhanced by low incubation temperatures (4 degrees C, 10 degrees C) and delayed at 37 degrees C as compared with room temperature. An increased number of primarily shape changed platelets is found if platelets are strongly mechanically irritated at blood sampling. The shape change is partly reversible in vitro, it is completely or almost completely reversible in vivo. Some antiaggregating agents inhibit the in vitro shape change at varying degrees (Bencyclan, SH 869 greater than ASA greater than D-Propranolol). The shape change is partly inhibited after oral or i.v. administration of ASA. A typical transformation of platelets into \"spheric\" forms can be observed following the addition of Bencyclan, SH 869 and D-Propranolol to PRP in vitro. The spontaneous \"primary shape change\" which occurs in PRP or blood after blood sampling is probably different from the secondary ADP-induced shape change. The primary shape change may influence the results of different platelet function and aggregating tests. The shape change kinetics of \"healthy\" subjects and patients with Hodgkin's disease differ significantly. The described method may gain more clinical interest in the future.", 
    "36": "By means of the radioactive antagonist ligand (3H)(-) dihydroalprenolol (DHAP) specific binding sites were identified in membrane preparations from red blood cells from rats. These specific sites were characterized as beta-adrenoceptors because of the following reasons: Specific binding of DHAP (in contrast to unspecific binding) was dependent on temperature and time of incubation. Furthermore, specific binding of DHAP showed saturability, temperature-dependent reversibility and high affinity (KD-value of DHAP = 6.51 nM). Specific binding of DHAP was competitively inhibited by beta-adrenergic antagonists (pindolol greater than alprenolol greater than or equal to propranolol greater than practolol) and agonists (isoprenaline greater than adrenaline). The (-) enantiomers of pindolol and isoprenaline showed pronounced higher affinities for the receptor sites than the respective (+) enantiomers. The receptor density in the membrane preparations (pmoles/mg protein) was strongly dependent on the degree of reticulocytosis: The Bmax-values increased more than 4 to 5 fold without alteration of the respective KD-values when reticulocyte counts were enhanced from 3 to 80% treatment of the animals with increasing doses of acetyl phenylhydrazine.", 
    "37": "The effects of single doses of propranolol and metoprolol on skin temperature and skin and muscle blood flow were compared in 10 normal subjects and four patients with essential hypertension. In normal subjects the mean skin temperature fell by 1.30 +/- 0.62 degrees C 90 minutes after 80 mg propranolol and 0.15 +/- 0.05 degrees C after 100 mg metoprolol. Skin blood flow and resting muscle blood flow were not affected by metoprolol but fell significantly after propranolol. Both drugs reduced post-exercise muscle hyperaemia, propranolol by more than metoprolol. Similar changes were seen in the hypertensive patients. Propranolol should be used with care in patients with known vascular disease.", 
    "38": "In 15 patients with moderate to severe hypertension (WHO II--III) atenolol was evaluated against a thiazide diuretic (bendrofluazide) in a single blind crossover study. Systolic blood pressure values were lowered more efficiently by the diuretic, while diastolic pressure values were significantly better controlled by atenolol. Atenolol and bendrofluazide, by mere addition of the pressure effects of the single components, clearly afforded the best pressure control. Side effects of atenolol were frequent but mild, never causing major concern with the patients or a dropout from the study. Although the pressure response to atenolol was significantly better in the normal and high renin group of patients, there was no statistically significant correlation between the reduction in plasma renin and blood pressure induced by atenolol. In turn, the pressure response to the diuretic was significantly better in low renin than in normal and high renin patients.", 
    "39": "Multicenter study in 10294 hypertensive patients conducted by 2000 G.P.'s throughout France. This trial permitted to compare the effectiveness and tolerance of 3 types of antihypertensive therapy: a beta-blocker, a diuretic and a central antihypertensive agent. It also permitted to study a certain number of socio-epidemiological characteristics in that patient population, in particular with regard to cardio-vascular risk factors.", 
    "40": "The beta-adrenergic receptor-blocking drug, d,l-propranolol, was compared with placebo for relief of experimentally induced anxiety. Subjects were chosen on the basis of having high levels of trait anxiety. Stress was induced experimentally by two performance tests. Single 40-mg doses of propranolol significantly slowed the heart rate, suggesting a satisfactory pharmacologic effect of the drug. The treatment was not superior to placebo, however, on any other measure. The experimental model used had clearly demonstrated an antianxiety effect of single 5-mg doses of diazepam. Propranolol at the dose used had little effect on psychic anxiety as determined by this model.", 
    "41": "A quantitative assay for urinary propranolol and six of its unconjugated metabolites by a gas chromatography mass spectrometry computer system has been developed. Conjugated metabolites are also determined following enzyme hydrolysis. These compounds are separated from murine by Amberlite XAD-2 resin column chromatography and are converted to methyl esters and trifluoroacetyl derivatives. Each substance is quantitated from reconstructed ion chromatograms using a specific mass or sum of masses for each compound by comparing its area with that of an appropriate internal standard. The minimum detectable concentrations are in the range of 50--100 ng ml-1. The calibrations are linear from 0.10--15.0 microgram ml-1 with recoveries ranging from 62--91%. This procedure yields a high degree of specificity, selectivity and reproducibility, as demonstrated by the analyses of urine from dogs receiving single 40 mg doses of propranolol orally.", 
    "42": "Stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system has been implicated in the pathogenesis of post-ischemic and nephrotoxic acute renal failure. This study was designed to determine the effect of d-l propranolol in glycerol induced acute renal failure in rats. 50% glycerol administered alone, induced a significant rise in blood urea and plasma renin concentration but no significant change in renal renin concentration. When administered with d-l propranolol (10 mg/kg body weight in 5 subcutaneous injections), mean blood urea, plasma renin and renal renin concentrations were not significantly different from the preceding group. Propranolol alone, administered in the same fashion, unexpectedly induced a rise in plasma renin concentration (p less than 0.05) while blood urea and renal renin concentrations were unchanged. Considering the unusually high dose of propranolol used, a second protocol was devised to compare the effects of d-l propranolol, in doses of 10 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg. Plasma renin concentration rose after high dose propranolol, but decreased, although not significantly, after administration of 1 mg/kg. Renal renin concentration was unchanged. High dose d-l propranolol, does not protect rats against glycerol induced acute renal failure. Contrarily to the usual 1 mg/kg dose, it was found surprisingly to increase renin release.", 
    "43": "1. Adrenaline and noradrenaline have been infused into the fetal sheep to produce plasma concentrations comparable to those seen during hypoxia and the cardiovascular changes compared with those seen in response to hypoxia. The effect of isoprenaline, methoxamine, and beta- and alpha-adrenergic antagonists were also investigated. 2. There were no significant changes in the blood gas values during any of the infusions except for a mean fall in pH of 0.04 during adrenaline infusion. 3. Adrenaline caused a fall in the fetal heart rate followed by a rise above the control value after 15-20 min. The fall in heart rate was abolished when the rise in blood pressure was blocked with phentolamine. The rise in heart rate was blocked by propranolol. The exact cause of the biphasic changes in heart rate during adrenaline infusion is not clear. 4. A fall in heart rate was not seen with noradrenaline; a small rise was. Propranolol changed this into a fall in heart rate while phentolamine increased the size of the heart rate rise. 5. Phentolamine alone increased the fetal heart rate by 25% and reduced blood pressure by 12%; propranolol alone reduced heart rate by 14% and had no effect on blood pressure. Isoprenaline increased fetal heart rate and reduced blood pressure. 6. The incidence of fetal breathing movements was highly variable. Despite this a significant increase was observed during adrenaline infusion. None of the other infusions had consistent effects. 7. The role of the circulating catecholamines in mediating or modifying the cardiovascular responses to hypoxia in the fetal sheep is discussed.", 
    "44": "Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) treated in utero with a low dose, and from weaning with 6 mg/kg per day of oral timolol, a noncardioselective beta-adrenergic blocker, did not develop hypertension. Isolated aortic rings from these animals showed increased reactivity to raised extracellular K+, when compared with tissues from timolol-treated Kyoto-Wistar (WKY) control rats. The normotensive SHR aorta also showed significant responsiveness to H+ and to high Ca2+ concentrations without previously depolarizing the tissue with high K+. These observations suggest that the increased reactivity seen in vascular smooth muscle from this animal does not develop secondary to elevated peripheral resistance and subsequent hypertrophy, and that the initiation of hypertension in this animal may be related to a membrane defect and (or) cellular defect which results in a facilitation of Ca2+ availability for the contractile proteins of the SHR vascular smooth muscle cell.", 
    "45": "Although acute alcohol intoxication can cause death, hepatic metabolism of ethanol is usually rapid, and in most cases general supportive care of the intoxicated patient is all that is required. Abrupt cessation of prolonged excessive alcohol intake gives rise to the alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The fundamentals of treatment are careful assessment of the patient and judicious use of a benzodiazepine."
