Nevertheless medical treatment may be necessary both to revive the patient and temporarily to check the haemorrhaging itself. Some views are presented on the use of drugs, both those already in clinical use and others at the experimental stage, which appear to be effective in the treatment of haemorrhaging in portal hypertension (Vasopressin, glypressin, prostaglandin, somatostatin, propranolol, cimetidine and ranitidine).", 
    "1": "The binding of 3H-labelled drug molecules to membranes of living cells gives rise to photon emission from tryptophan residues at proteinaceous binding sites. This phenomenon, called condensed phase radioluminescence, has been used to measure non-invasively the kinetics of [3H]nitrendipine binding and dissociation on the same samples of cultured beating cardiac myocytes. Signal arose only from bound drug molecules. Binding was monoexponential (tau = 5.5 min) as was dissociation (14.3 min). Preincubating cells with non-radioactive nifedipine reduced the amplitude and rate of [3H]nitrendipine but not of [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding. The potential uses of this phenomenon are discussed.", 
    "2": "[3H]inositol and 32Pi were simultaneously incorporated into rat parotid phosphatidylinositol. The ratio of [3H]/32Pi incorporation dropped dramatically following stimulation with muscarinic or alpha-adrenergic agonists and returned to control values following the addition of appropriate antagonists. The drop in [3H]/32Pi ratio can be explained by a rapid increase in de- novo synthesis of phosphatidylinositol following its receptor-mediated breakdown. The change in this ratio also provided evidence for the existence of CDP-DG + inositol in equilibrium phosphatidylinositol exchange reaction in the intact tissue.", 
    "3": "A series of adrenergic agonists and antagonists was applied by iontophoresis in the vicinity of noradrenergic neurons in the nucleus commissuralis of the rat. Alpha-2 receptor-mediated inhibition of these neurons was observed with single-unit recording techniques. The excitatory effects of the alpha-2 receptor antagonist piperoxane provided evidence that these receptors are of functional significance in vivo.", 
    "4": "The bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of 10 mg of mepindolol sulphate and of 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide were compared in a cross-over design in five healthy volunteers after the administration of either the single drugs (Corindolan and Esidrix) or in combination (Tenesor). Maximum concentrations of mepindolol in the plasma of 25 ng ml-1 were achieved 1.6 h after both treatments and the half-life of disposition was calculated to be 4-5 h, being somewhat longer after the combination tablet. The amount of hydrochlorothiazide renally eliminated up to 48 h after drug intake was about 60 per cent of the dose. The half-life of renal excretion was 3 h. The two formulations of mepindolol sulphate and hydrochlorothiazide proved to be bioequivalent with a tendency to better mepindolol bioavailability in the combination form.", 
    "5": "The secretion of total phospholipid in postmortem in situ lungs of newborn rabbits was examined using the technique of lung lavage after an initial lavage procedure, and then after a period of static air inflation at 30 cm H2O pressure for 45 min. There was a significant reduction in the phospholipid yield with 10(-3) molar DL-propranolol used as the initial lavage fluid, both immediately after the initial lavage procedure (experimental group, 0.29 +/- SE 0.04 mg/g dry lung weight; control group, 0.57 +/- SE 0.09; p less than 0.01) and after static inflation with air (experimental group, 1.14 +/- SE 0.15; control group, 2.22 +/- SE 0.24; p less than 0.001). Preinjection of the breathing newborn rabbit with DL-propranolol was not necessary for this inhibitory effect. There was no significant reduction when 10(-3) molar atropine, lidocaine, D-propranolol, or 10(-5) scopolamine were substituted as the initial lavage fluid, nor was there any reduction when the concentration of DL-propranolol was decreased to 10(-4) or 10(-5) molar. Because D-propranolol has all the properties of DL-propranolol, except 100-fold less beta-adrenergic antagonist activity, the inhibition by propranolol was due to specific beta-adrenergic blockade. In the absence of an intact circulation or a functional central nervous system, it is concluded that surfactant phospholipid secretion is partly controlled by an intrapulmonary neurogenic reflex.", 
    "6": "It is shown that the Wagner-Nelson absorption method provides zero-order input rate constants exactly, or with small error, in a large number of cases where the two-compartment open disposition model applies. Factors affecting the accuracy of the method were studied with error-free simulated data. The method was applied to real data for three drugs. With ethanol infused over 2 h in eight human trials the estimated rate constant averaged 99.6 per cent of the known rate constant with a coefficient of variation of 6.86 per cent. With pindolol infused over 3 h five human subjects the estimated rate constant averaged 98.7 per cent of the known rate constant with a coefficient of variation of 22.5 per cent. With theophylline administered orally in a sustained-release form to seven human subjects the Wagner-Nelson method provided estimated zero-order rate constants which averaged 95.8 per cent of those estimated by an exact two-compartment absorption equation with a coefficient of variation of 38.1 per cent (in this case bolus intravenous data were available for the same subjects).", 
    "7": "Pharmacokinetic and bioavailability parameters of propranolol were estimated in 10 healthy adult subjects after single oral doses of two commercial tablet formulations of propranolol hydrochloride (2 X 40 mg). Plasma concentrations of propranolol were determined by a high-performance liquid-chromatographic (HPLC) assay. Peak plasma concentrations of propranolol glucuronide were 6-8 times those of the corresponding peak propranolol plasma concentrations. The mean resident time (MRT) of propranolol and of propranolol glucuronide was determined for each subject for both formulations. The MRT of the parent drug was found to be longer than the MRT of the glucuronide metabolite for each of the subjects examined. Statistical moment analysis indicated that this phenomenon is attributable to extensive presystemic glucuronidation of the parent drug.", 
    "8": "Ten healthy male volunteers received single oral doses of 100 mg of medroxalol administered as a solution, a preliminary tablet formulation and a single dose of 100 mg administered intravenously in a randomized three-way crossover study. Mean terminal half-lives of 12.4, 13.4, and 11.3 h were observed for the intravenous, solution and tablet formulation, respectively. Mean urinary recovery of parent drug at 48 h was 8.9 per cent, 3.9 per cent, and 3.2 per cent. Absolute bioavailability estimated from plasma AUC was 54 per cent for the solution and 38 per cent for the tablet, and the relative bioavailability from the tablet was 71 per cent.", 
    "9": "The article reports on the paediatric-anaesthesiological treatment of 6 phaeochromocytomas in 5 children who were 8 to 16 years of age. Therapeutic recommendations for the perioperative medication of infantile phaeochromocytoma patients are involved. The therapeutic aim of this study was the management of the effects of phaeochromocytoma before and after extirpation of the tumour, the effect of the phaeochromocytoma being of an alpha-adrenergic and beta-adrenergic cardiovascular nature and transmitted by catecholamines. Preoperative stabilization of blood pressure by means of the alpha-blocker phenoxybenzamine and a subsequent intraoperative, controlled reduction of blood pressure by means of sodium nitroprusside were found to be an effective, safe and easily appreciated therapeutic concept for the perioperative care of paediatric phaeochromocytoma patients. Considerable individual differences in dose an duration of the necessary preoperative phenoxybenzamine administration rendered ward control of therapy recommendable. The risk of complete alpha-sympathicolysis by additive drug effects during premedication and induction of anaesthesia, had to be taken into consideration for conducting phenoxybenzamine therapy. Additional administration of the beta-blocker pindolol successfully controlled the intraoperatively manifested tachycardial heart rhythm phases without provoking any complicating arrhythmias. During the entire perioperative treatment of the patients it is mandatory to ensure sufficient substitution of intravascular volume to prevent hypotensive complications. Our patients did not need any cardiac and sympathicomimetic drugs as postoperative administration. None of the patients had any perioperative complications worth mentioning.", 
    "10": "Electrical stimulation of the dorsal periaqueductal gray matter (DPAG) eliciting flight behavior in awake rats caused an increase in arterial blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) and respiration in rats anesthetized with urethane. The hypertension was markedly reduced by 5 mg/kg of intravenously injected hexamethonium or bretylium, virtually abolished by 5 mg/kg of phentolamine and partially antagonized by 0.1 mg/kg of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocker, prazosin. The tachycardia induced by DPAG stimulation was partially antagonized by hexamethonium or bretylium and abolished by propranolol (5 mg/kg, IV) or practolol (5 mg/kg, IV), but not affected by N-butylscopolamine (10 mg/kg, IV). Phentolamine increased basal HR and abolished the tachycardic response caused by either brain stimulation or intravenous noradrenaline. Prazosin moderately decreased the response to noradrenaline, but did not affect basal HR or the tachycardia induced by brain stimulation. The increase in respiratory amplitude occurring during brain stimulation was abolished by phentolamine as well as by prazosin, while the increase in respiratory rate was moderately reduced by phentolamine and propranolol. These results demonstrate that the cardiovascular component of the defense reaction of the rat is almost entirely due to a sharp increase in sympathetic tone. They also suggest that the hyperventilation induced by aversive brain stimulation is modulated by central and peripheral adrenergic mechanisms.", 
    "11": "The electrophysiological effects of prenalterol, a new beta-receptor agonist, in a dose of 100 micrograms/kg body weight given intravenously for 5 min, were studied in 13 patients with signs of sinus node dysfunction and/or conduction defects within or distal to the atrioventricular (AV) node. In nine patients with signs of sinus node dysfunction a significant reduction was found in corrected sinus node recovery time, on an average by 1955 +/- 640 ms (-61%, P less than 0.05) and in atrial refractoriness, by 61 +/- 21 ms (-20%, P less than 0.05). Similar but insignificant changes were also seen in the four patients with normal sinus node function. In eight patients with AV nodal dysfunction, a significant increase was found in the Wenckebach point, by 51 +/- 10 b.p.m. (+52%. P less than 0.01) and a decrease in the AH interval, by 23 +/- 9 ms (-14%, P less than 0.05). AV nodal refractoriness tended to decrease by 115 +/- 58 ms (-24%, NS). Similar changes were found in the five patients with normal AV conduction. Heart rate increased in all 13 patients, on an average by 28 +/- 5 b.p.m. (+44%, P less than 0.001) and systolic blood pressure by 18 +/- 8 mmHg (+13% P less than 0.01). In conclusion, prenalterol increased sinus node automaticity and atrial and AV nodal conductivity, but did not improve infranodal conduction. Thus, the drug might be useful in the treatment of patients with sinus node dysfunction as well as in patients with spontaneous or induced atrioventricular conduction abnormalities.", 
    "12": "In 25 patients with ocular hypertension and open angles timolol maleate lowered the intraocular pressure (IOP) of 71% of the 49 eyes treated, keeping it below 22 mm Hg during 4 years of therapy. However, the IOP tended to drift upward by 2 to 4 mm Hg per year, especially during the first and third follow-up periods (1 year and 2 years long respectively). Thus, patients should be examined every 3 months after an adequate response to therapy is achieved. In this series of patients there was a slight visual loss in about 38% of patients, but it was probably related to increasing age. Field loss occurred in four patients in spite of a good response to therapy. Increased cupping of the optic disc occurred in six patients, four of whom had had a pretreatment IOP of 30 mm Hg or greater. Timolol therapy was well tolerated by the patients, being virtually symptom-free. However, special care would be needed in treating patients with asthma, bradycardia or congestive heart failure.", 
    "13": "A comparison of propranolol and progesterone binding to native and desialylated human orosomucoid was studied by means of equilibrium dialysis. The association constants of propranolol and progesterone binding to native human orosomucoid under physiological conditions were 8.4 X 10(5) and 3.2 X 10(5) M-1, respectively. Enzymatic desialylation of human orosomucoid removed 95% of the sialic acid content and reduced the binding affinity of propranolol from 8.4 X 10(5) to 6.0 X 10(5) M-1, but the affinity of progesterone was not affected. In addition, desialylation reduced the percent binding for propranolol, indicating that electrostatic attraction of the positive charge on propranolol by sialic acid residues on human orosomucoid had some effect on the binding ability of purified orosomucoid for propranolol. The present data suggest that the electrostatic attraction between sialic acid and propranolol is partially responsible for the preferential binding of basic drugs to orosomucoid in plasma.", 
    "14": "Cardiovascular effects of acute administration of practolol were studied in groups of normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats. In some of these animals a strong and long-lasting hypotension was shown, resulting from a decrease in the total peripheral resistance. This hypotension was impaired by preventive propranolol administration, and did not result from a direct vascular effect. Moreover, it was previously reported that practolol induced a strong and long-lasting hypotension in all normotensive and hypertensive rats after blood-brain barrier disruption. From these experiments it is suggested that the blood pressure decrease observed in some groups of Okamoto rats may be due to a practolol action on central beta-receptors. The intensity of hypotension depends on the molecule penetration in the central nervous system, and seems to be related to blood-brain barrier lesions induced by genetic hypertension.", 
    "15": "Previous studies showed the importance of the response of blood pressure to emotional stress in essential hypertension. However, it is unclear to what extent the response of blood pressure to emotional stress is influenced by antihypertensive treatment, and especially by beta-blockers. In the present study the influence of antihypertensive treatment with either beta-blockers (beta) or diuretics (D) was compared in two series of experiments on male hypertensives, carried out after 2 weeks (beta, n = 11; D, n = 11) and 1 year of treatment (beta, n = 11; D, n = 9). One of the two drugs was randomly allocated to each patient. In the first series of experiments an ergometric exercise test was also performed (workload depending on age and body surface area, 60-100 W). The two medications caused a similar decrease in basal blood pressure. The response of blood pressure to emotional stress was also the same in both groups, and equal to that in untreated hypertensives. However, the reaction of systolic blood pressure to dynamic exercise was lower in the patients treated with beta-blockers (30.2 +/- 9.5 mm Hg) than in those treated with diuretics (42.9 +/- 12.1 mm Hg; p = 0.013). The effect of antihypertensive treatment on the reactivity of blood pressure therefore cannot comprehensively be tested by means of a single stress test. In terms of controlling the response of blood pressure to stress, beta-blockers are not generally more effective than diuretics, but only in certain situations.", 
    "16": "The relationship between the onset of hypertension and changes in monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity in the brains and hearts of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were studied. After 7-weeks-old, blood pressure of SHR increased rapidly and reached a level of 170 to 180 mmHg; but following 4 weeks of propranolol treatment (10 mg/kg/day), blood pressure decreased significantly compared to that of untreated SHR. Heart/body weights ratio of SHR was higher than that of normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY). MAO activities in the brain stem, the medulla oblongata and pons of the SHR were significantly higher than those in WKY at 7 weeks of age, and MAO activity in the brain stem of the propranolol-treated SHR was significantly lower than that in the untreated SHR. Propranolol inhibited MAO activity in brain tissue in vitro, and the I50 values of propranolol were identical (1 X 10(-4) M) in SHR and WKY. In both the WKY strain and the SHR, the Vmax values of heart MAO increased with age, and the Vmax values of SHR were twice those of WKY. Km values for tyramine of heart MAO in WKY and SHR were approx. 100 microM and 140 microM, respectively; however, these values were not age-dependent. It was concluded that an increase in MAO activity in SHR brain stem may trigger a reduction in noradrenaline content and that propranolol may be responsible for its restoration, thus reducing peripheral sympathetic activity; moreover, the increase in MAO activity in the hearts of SHR may be of genetic origin.", 
    "17": "Using the anaesthetized dog, continuous recording was made of the oxygen and glucose contents of the artery and the vein draining the upper jejunum. Flow was also measured and results expressed as differences in oxygen and glucose between the aorta and the jejunal vein (a-v), also as oxygen consumption and glucose uptake. Resting glucose uptake was greater than could be accounted for on the basis of oxidation. When adrenaline (1 microgram/kg. min) or noradrenaline (2 micrograms/kg. min) was infused intravenously, oxygen uptake rose by about 50% whereas glucose uptake rose by 300-500%; moreover, the rise in glucose uptake was apparent before the rise in oxygen uptake. The beta-blocking agent, propranolol (0 X 5 mg/kg. min) had no effect on oxygen uptake but caused a three-fold rise in glucose uptake. Subsequently infusion of adrenaline had no effect on oxygen uptake and no effect on glucose uptake. However, on stopping the infusion there was a marked drop in glucose uptake, which was not maintained. It is suggested that the effects of catecholamines may be due to altered arterial blood glucose levels and that the jejunum may play a role in glucose homeostasis which requires the action of beta receptors.", 
    "18": "A new presentation of ECG tracings is presented (contourography) which is suitable for ECG intervals measurements, particularly QT for prolonged periods of time. Possible applications of this method are looked for in the future.", 
    "19": "The antihypertensive activity of a new vasodilating agent (ISF 2469) cadralazine (CD) was compared in a randomized, crossover, intrapatient study with that of hydralazine (HD) in 20 hypertensive patients whose diastolic blood pressure (BP) was greater than 95 mmHg during treatment with atenolol (AT), 100 mg 1 X daily. The initial dose of CD was 15 mg 1 X daily; after 15 days in case of poor response, the dose was increased to 20 mg 1 X daily. HD was given at a dose of 25 mg 3 X daily and was increased to 50 mg 2 X daily in case of poor response. BP values (standing) during AT were 174/108; they fell to 144/88 during CD and to 138/88 during HD. No significant difference was detected between the two drugs for both systolic and diastolic BP (supine and standing). Heart rate increased with both drugs, with a greater increase during CD. The difference was clinically nonsignificant. A total of 24 patients were enrolled, but 4 had to cease treatment because of side effects during HD. The overall prevalence of side effects was much higher during HD, especially during the first days of therapy. Also the severity of side effects was greater during HD. Our data show that CD has the same antihypertensive activity as HD with a lesser incidence of side effects and with a single dose/day administration in contrast with three administrations of HD. This can result in greater patient compliance.", 
    "20": "In eight cats anaesthetized with chloralose, the carotid sinus on one side was either exposed to systemic arterial pressure or perfused with a pump in order to control sinus pressure. Baroreceptor influences from the contralateral carotid sinus and from the aortic arch were interrupted by denervation. Arrangements were made for intermittent electric stimulation of pain fibres in somatic and visceral nerves with stimulation parameters chosen to elicit reproducible increases in arterial blood pressure and in skeletal muscle vascular resistance. The elicited increases in arterial pressure and muscle vascular resistance were both about 40% smaller when the carotid sinus was exposed to systemic arterial pressure in comparison with the experimental condition of a constant carotid sinus pressure. I.v. metoprolol (0.1-0.3 mg kg-1) reduced base-line arterial pressure, but did not attenuate the arterial blood pressure increase in response to pain stimulation. The baroreceptor modulation of the haemodynamic response to the pain stimulation was not affected by metoprolol.", 
    "21": "The influence of beta blockers on Type A behavior pattern and cardiovascular reactivity was tested. Nineteen white, male hypertensive patients were divided at random into two therapeutic groups (100 mg atenolol versus 50 mg hydrochlorothiazide + 5 mg amiloride (control group) ). For each patient, the German version of the structured interview was performed before therapy and at a minimum of 4 weeks after normalization of clinical resting casual blood pressure (BP). Prior to therapy, there were no differences in age, BP at rest, cardiovascular reactivity, and Type A between the two groups. After therapy, the patients treated with beta blockers changed Type A characteristics toward Type B, regardless where they started on the Type A scale, and beta blockers attenuated cardiovascular reactivity. In this study, Type A (hypertensive patients) was not associated with greater cardiovascular reactivity.", 
    "22": "The effects of epinephrine (E) on plasma norepinephrine (NE) concentrations and cardiovascular responses before and after beta-blockade were studied in 36 patients with essential hypertension and 10 age-matched normal controls. The resting plasma NE and E were significantly higher in the borderline hypertensives (251 +/- 21 (SE) pg/ml, p less than 0.005; 57 +/- 5, p less than 0.05) than in normal controls (127 +/- 18; 38 +/- 7). An immediate rise in plasma E and NE was observed after one bolus intravenous administration of glucagon (1 mg). Then, plasma E fell rapidly to the baseline, whereas plasma NE declined much slowly. Propranolol did not affect the plasma E response to glucagon, but eliminated a prolonged rise of plasma NE. Exogenous E infusion (1.25-1.50 micrograms/min) for 30 min caused a definite rise in both plasma NE and blood pressures and lasted more than 30 min after termination of the infusion. Propranolol did not alter the time course of plasma E, but again inhibited a prolonged rise in both plasma NE and blood pressures. These findings support the view that plasma E can act physiologically as a sustained stimulator to the presynaptic beta-adrenoceptors, leading to an enhancement of NE release and a rise in blood pressure in man.", 
    "23": "Plasma vasopressin, arterial blood gas tensions, pH, arterial blood pressure, heart rate and respiration were monitored in conscious rats breathing room air or exposed to varying degrees of hypoxia. A similar series of observations was made in a group of anaesthetized rats and in rats treated with alpha- and beta-adrenergic and dopaminergic blocking agents. The effect of two opioid antagonists on the vasopressin response was also noted. Hypoxia produced an increase in circulating vasopressin concentrations in both conscious and anaesthetized rats. In the conscious animals the increase reached statistical significance when the animals were exposed to 12% oxygen in nitrogen, which produced a fall in arterial PaO2 of 44.7 +/- 5.0%. Guanethidine, phentolamine and propranolol all produced a significant fall in the basal concentrations of vasopressin, while guanethidine, phenoxybenzamine and propranolol blocked the increase seen on breathing 12% oxygen in nitrogen. Naloxone and levallorphan also reduced the vasopressin response to hypoxia. Thus it appears that aminergic pathways play a role in the maintenance of circulating concentrations of vasopressin and in the response to hypoxia. Endogenous opioids also appear to be involved in the hypoxic response.", 
    "24": "By repeated inhalant carbachol provocation tests on 13 normal and 13 asthmatic subjects, we investigated the effect of ketotifen (as compared with placebo) on the cholinergic responsiveness of the airways. In normal subjects, ketotifen reduced the slope of the linear regression lines, calculated from the airway resistance vs. the intra-pulmonary deposited amount of carbachol (reactivity). By adding a single dose of 80 mg of propranolol the bronchial reactivity was increased. Neither placebo nor ketotifen pretreatment altered the response to propranolol. In asthmatic subjects, the reactivity of the airways to carbachol was reduced after 7 days of ketotifen treatment. Propranolol increased the pre-challenge airway resistance values, and ketotifen did not reduce this bronchoconstrictive action. We could not observe any influence of ketotifen on the potentiation of the carbachol-induced bronchoconstriction. We conclude that ketotifen on the potentiation of the carbachol-induced bronchoconstriction. We conclude that ketotifen reduces the bronchial reactivity as assessed by carbachol inhalation in normal and in asthmatic subjects.", 
    "25": "The excretion of oxprenolol and timolol in breast milk was examined by comparing their concentrations in milk with those in plasma. The mean milk to plasma ratio of oxprenolol was 0.29 (SD 0.14; that for timolol was 0.80 (SD 0.21). The total quantity of either drug ingested by a fully breast-fed infant is unlikely to be therapeutically significant.", 
    "26": "Corneal epithelial erosions developed in two patients wearing gas permeable contact lenses (Boston) soon after commencing topical timolol maleate therapy. This prompted the following investigation. Forty rabbit corneas were examined by scanning and transmission electron microscopy after treatment for one month with one of the following: timolol ophthalmic solution, preservative-free timolol, contact lens, contact lens and timolol, contact lens and preservative-free timolol, contact lens and saline, or no treatment. Corneas treated with either timolol or contact lens alone showed mild to moderate edema or degeneration of epithelial and endothelial cells. However, the combined use of a contact lens and timolol produced marked alterations in both the corneal epithelium and endothelium.", 
    "27": "This study describes a specific memory impairment in subjects taking either of two kinds of centrally active anti-hypertensive agents. Verbal memory impairment was present in hypertensive and normotensive patients taking methyldopa or propranolol hydrochloride, while hypertensive patients receiving only a diuretic did not show this deficit. Visual memory impairment was not seen in any of the groups tested. The majority of the subjects were unaware of their memory deficit, even when test results clearly revealed impairment. An earlier pilot study of 12 hypertensive patients receiving methyldopa or propranolol used a broad range of cognitive tests and also demonstrated impairment in verbal memory only, while other cognitive measures remained relatively unaffected.", 
    "28": "The use of propranolol to treat unprovoked rage episodes in brain-damaged patients has recently been reported. The authors report three cases that indicate a role for its use in the treatment of overall aggressiveness in brain-damaged or mentally retarded patients.", 
    "29": "The renal portal circulation of the avian kidney contains a unique smooth muscle valve that can direct blood flow from the posterior extremities to the central circulation or through the kidney. The neural control of the valve and adjacent venous tissue from Rhode Island Red roosters was characterized by measuring the isometric force developed following transmural nerve stimulation (TNS). During TNS, the valve relaxed while the iliac vein contracted. In the valve, a poststimulus contraction followed the relaxation. Propranolol and guanethidine abolished the TNS-induced relaxation of the valve, leaving a contraction that was increased by physostigmine and partially blocked by atropine or prazosin. In contrast, the TNS-induced contraction of the vein was blocked by guanethidine or prazosin. Measurement of choline acetyltransferase activity and norepinephrine content confirms that the valve is densely innervated with both cholinergic and adrenergic nerves. Thus the vein shows a predominantly adrenergic contractile response typical of most vascular smooth muscle, but the valve demonstrates a dual control, i.e., adrenergic nerves producing relaxation and cholinergic nerves causing contraction. Knowledge of the nature of neuronal control of the valve should aid in the design of experiments to determine its functional role.", 
    "30": "At low doses angiotensin III (A III) stimulates jejunal fluid absorption in the pentobarbital sodium-anesthetized rat. In contrast, at high doses the hormone inhibits absorption and/or stimulates secretory processes. The stimulation of jejunal absorption in response to A III can be blocked by guanethidine, phentolamine, and prazosin but not by propranolol or yohimbine, suggesting that A III-increased intestinal absorption is secondary to the release of norepinephrine from sympathetic nerves in the jejunum and activation of postsynaptic alpha 1-adrenergic receptors. The A III inhibition of water absorption is not affected by adrenergic antagonists but can be reversed to a net stimulation of transfer after pretreatment of the animals with indomethacin. This suggests that at high doses A III stimulates intestinal prostaglandin biosynthesis. The A III analogue [Ile7]A III is devoid of agonist activity over a wide dose range and behaves as a potent antagonist of both the stimulatory and the inhibitory effects of the parent peptide on jejunal absorption. [Ile7]A III will be a useful tool for investigating the physiological role of angiotensin peptides in the control of intestinal absorption.", 
    "31": "Simultaneous in vitro measurements of electrical and mechanical activities were performed, using suction electrodes and force transducers, respectively, on longitudinal and circular muscle layers of the pig proximal colon. In addition, circular muscle strips were studied with the sucrose gap technique. Spontaneous activity was present in both preparations. In the circular muscle, slow waves with superimposed spikes occurred at a variable frequency, accompanied by phasic contractions. Longitudinal muscle preparations showed a different behavior. Regular appearance of distinct slow waves as described for the circular muscle did not occur. Instead, periods of membrane potential oscillations at a frequency of 41 cycles/min and a duration of approximately 12 s were observed in this layer. Most oscillations had superimposed spikes, and each period of oscillations was associated with a contraction. Spontaneous activity in the circular layer was myogenic in nature but susceptible to innervation and stretch. In contrast, an excitatory stimulus (acetylcholine or stretch) was a prerequisite for activity in the longitudinal layer. Cholinomimetics increased and adrenergic agents decreased the frequency of the slow waves and spiking activity and frequency and force of contractions in the circular muscle. Cholinergic agents increased the activity in the longitudinal muscle into continuous electrical oscillations with spiking activity and concomitant tonic contractile activity, whereas adrenergic agents abolished electrical and mechanical activity. Spontaneous release of acetylcholine occurred, partly due to regenerative activity of myenteric cholinergic nerves. In addition, tonic activity in the noncholinergic nonadrenergic inhibitory neurons decreased circular muscle tone.", 
    "32": "A serum sickness-like syndrome developed in a 38-year-old woman with a history of drug allergy who had been taking propranolol hydrochloride (Inderal) for four days. The illness resolved after the drug was withdrawn and a course of prednisone therapy was given. We recommend caution to physicians in prescribing propranolol or other beta-adrenergic blocking agents for patients with a history of allergic reactions to drugs. Also, all patients using beta-blocking agents should be cautioned that although serum sickness-like syndrome is rare, it requires immediate medical attention.", 
    "33": "In order to validate a new method for quantifying coronary blood flow, we injected intravenously a bolus of rubidium-82 (Rb-82) into 28 open-chested dogs under a wide range of flow and physiologic conditions, using beta probes to monitor myocardial radioactivity. Extraction fraction and perfusion were measured using a functional model that separates the data into the free and trapped myocardial rubidium. Extraction and uptake of rubidium were lower during acidosis than during alkalosis and were unchanged by glucose-insulin, digoxin, or propranolol. Myocardial flow, as indicated by rubidium, correlated linearly with simultaneous measurements of flow by microspheres in the same sample volume over a wide range of flow (r = 0.97, n = 106, range 0.02-7.76 ml/min/g). Regional myocardial blood flow can be accurately determined using generator-produced Rb-82. Studies using current state-of-the-art, fast positron-emission tomographic cameras are required to determine the utility of this approach in man.", 
    "34": "Changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and plasma concentrations of norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine were measured in eight hypertensive patients in a supine position after stepwise infusion of incremental sodium nitroprusside doses and intravenous injection of cumulative labetalol doses. Both drugs induced rises in plasma NE concentration that were linearly related to reductions in MAP. For any reduction in blood pressure (BP), however, the rise in plasma NE concentration induced by labetalol was approximately four times that induced by sodium nitroprusside. The difference can be explained by two effects of labetalol: impairment of neuronal NE uptake and beta-adrenergic-receptor blockade, which are known to reduce NE clearance from plasma. After both drugs there was a correlation between changes in HR and changes in BP and a correlation between changes in HR and changes in plasma NE concentration. Slopes of the regression lines for both relationships were less after labetalol than after sodium nitroprusside, presumably because of the beta-adrenergic-blocking properties of labetalol. Multiple-regression analysis indicated that the plasma NE rise was an important determinant of the vasodepressor response to each drug. The greater plasma NE elevation after labetalol may limit its antihypertensive effect.", 
    "35": "Kinetic and dynamic data from 27 healthy male subjects were evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, double-crossover study to test the hypothesis that 180 mg/day propranolol twice and three times a day would provide much the same plasma levels and beta 1-blockade. The data indicate that propranolol twice rather than three times a day should be favored when beta 1-blockade is needed in therapy. The dynamic efficacy of the two schedules was the same and maximum concentration, AUC0-24, and 0-hr plasma propranolol values were higher after twice-than after three-times-daily dosing. The degree of beta 1-blockade (reduction in exercise tachycardia) was much the same on both dosing regimens at trough concentrations. These data indicate that both twice- and three-times-a-day dosing schedules provide well-sustained 24-hr beta-blockade and are probably interchangeable for therapeutic purposes.", 
    "36": "Esmolol is an ultra-short-acting beta blocker. Its kinetics was studied in eight healthy subjects after continuous intravenous infusion of 400 micrograms/kg/min over 2 hr. The concentrations of esmolol and its major metabolite, 3-[4-(2-hydroxy-3-[isopropylamino]propoxy)phenyl]propionic acid, in blood and urine were determined by gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric assay and HPLC. The distribution and elimination t1/2s of esmolol averaged 2.03 and 9.19 min. The apparent volume of distribution of esmolol averaged 3.43 l/kg and was four times the volume of the central compartment. The total clearance of esmolol averaged 285 ml/min/kg, indicating that nonhepatic routes play a predominant role in its clearance. The t1/2s of formation and elimination of the metabolite averaged 2.82 min and 3.72 hr. The ratio of the metabolite formation and elimination rate constants of the parent drug (kf/k10) averaged 0.829, suggesting that 82.9% of esmolol was converted to the metabolite (which is consistent with the urinary recovery of 71% of the dose as unconjugated metabolite). The volume of distribution and total clearance of the metabolite averaged 0.411 l/kg and 1.28 ml/min/kg. Esmolol was followed by a significant reduction of isoproterenol-induced increase in heart rate and systolic blood pressure at doses of 50, 150, and 400 micrograms/kg/min.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "37": "Sotalol is a beta-adrenergic blocker that also prolongs action potential duration and myocardial refractoriness over the short term (class III effect). Its short-term antiarrhythmic effects were compared with those of metoprolol, which has neither short-term class III nor membrane-stabilizing action, on reentrant ventricular arrhythmias produced by programmed stimulation in 17 conscious dogs 3 to 8 days after myocardial infarction. Ventricular arrhythmias were prevented or significantly slowed by sotalol in 11 of 19 studies (58%) compared with in one of 14 (7%) studies with metoprolol. Sotalol prolonged refractoriness in the infarct zone, measured from an implanted \"composite\" electrode, by 41 +/- 45% (mean +/- SD, p less than .01), which was significantly greater than the increases it produced in effective refractory period of the normal ventricle (14.0 +/- 5.5%) or QT interval (12.5 +/- 7.8%). Metoprolol had no effect on infarct-zone refractoriness. Sotalol differentially increases refractoriness in potential reentry circuits in ischemic myocardium. Its antiarrhythmic effect in this model is not due to beta-blockade, and is presumably related to prolongation of action potential duration.", 
    "38": "The prophylactic effect of a 5-HT uptake inhibitor, femoxetine, was compared with that of propranolol in a double-blind crossover study of 6-months duration. 29 patients commenced the experiment. 3 subjects withdrew because of side effects and 2 because the program was inconvenient for them. In the 24 patients who continued the study to the end, the periods of propranolol (administered 160 mg daily) and of femoxetine (given 400 mg daily) differed significantly from each other with respect to the attack frequency and headache index. A significant reduction in the use of medication relieving attacks was observed during the propranolol treatment as compared with the pre-treatment period. The study showed that partial depletion of thrombocyte 5-HT uptake inhibitor did not lead to a marked improvement in headache, contrary to what might be expected on the grounds of the 5-HT hypothesis of migraine.", 
    "39": "The effects of catecholamines and adrenergic blocking agents were studied in vivo on the blood pressure and heart rate of the unanaesthetized American bullfrog, Rana catesbeiana. Bullfrogs were chronically cannulated with a T cannula in the right sciatic artery. The mean systemic arterial blood pressure prior to the infusion of catecholamines was 18.5 +/- 1.5 mm Hg. Mean preinfusion heart rate was 30.9 +/- 2.0 beats/min. Epinephrine elicited the largest increase in blood pressure, with an accompanying decrease in heart rate. Norepinephrine and phenylephrine were less effective. Isoproterenol was the only catecholamine tested which elevated heart rate in a dose-dependent manner. It had no effect on blood pressure. The beta adrenergic antagonist, propranolol, blocked the increase in heart rate elicited by isoproterenol but had no effect on the blood pressure increases elicited by the other catecholamines. The alpha adrenergic antagonist, phentolamine, partially blocked the blood pressure increase by epinephrine, norepinephrine, and phenylephrine as well as the elevation of heart rate by isoproterenol. Atropine alone elevated heart rate 19 +/- 3 beats/min, and prevented slowing of the heart due to epinephrine, norepinephrine, and phenylephrine. Stimulatory effects of epinephrine on heart rate were observed only after atropine had been administered. Beta adrenergic receptors, therefore, appear to function in heart rate regulation; however, the predominant effect of catecholamines is reflex slowing of the heart due to stimulation of the vagus nerve. In contrast, the alpha receptor, stimulated by epinephrine, appears to be the main adrenergic receptor controlling blood pressure changes.", 
    "40": "In anaesthetized guinea-pigs intravenous histamine caused an increase in airways resistance (RA) and a fall in dynamic compliance (CDyn). Indomethacin (1 mg kg-1, i.v.) significantly enhanced the effect of histamine on RA. Indomethacin also increased the basal RA and the RA response to a histamine infusion. The effect of indomethacin on CDyn was less consistent but here also there was a trend for an increased response to histamine. Sodium carbonate (the vehicle for indomethacin, 0.05 ml 100 mM solution) had no effect on RA or CDyn in control experiments. Propranolol (0.1 mg kg-1, i.v.) enhanced the effect of histamine on RA in animals pretreated with either indomethacin or Na2CO3 vehicle, but the effect was more consistent in indomethacin pretreated animals. Indomethacin also tended to enhance the effect of histamine on RA in animals pretreated with reserpine or BW755c but it had little effect on the CDyn response to histamine. The results show that indomethacin augments the responsiveness of the airways to histamine in the anaesthetized guinea-pig. The results with propranolol and reserpine suggest that an operational beta-adrenergic system is not required for the effect of indomethacin on RA. No confirmation for lipoxygenase involvement was obtained with the lipoxygenase inhibitor, BW755.", 
    "41": "The therapeutic effects of the association of propranolol (P) and nifedipine (N) were compared with those of propranolol alone in the treatment of effort angina. Ten patients under 65 years of age with stable effort angina confirmed by stress testing and coronary arteriography were studied. The criterion of selection was inadequate improvement of symptoms with the betablocker alone, prescribed in first intention. The patients were divided into two groups (A and B) at random: --Phase I (2 weeks) : group A : P 80 mg/day + N 30 mg/day, group B : P 80 mg/day + Placebo 3 tablets/day; --Phase II (2 weeks) : group A : P 80 mg/day + Placebo 3 tablets/day, group B : P 80/day. The results of this cross-over trial were assessed blind. The association N + P compared to P alone led to a clinical improvement in 7 out of 10 patients, a clear cut increase in maximal exercise capacity (44%), a reduction in ST depression of 0.8 mm and to the disappearance of effort angina in half the patients. The haemodynamic tolerance of this drug association was good. These statistically significant differences between the P + N and P + placebo treatment periods demonstrate that this drug association is beneficial in patients with effort angina who are inadequately relieved by betablocker therapy alone.",

    "44": "Cardiac arrhythmias may be caused by abnormalities of impulse initiation, impulse propagation, or a combination of the two. The specific mechanisms that may induce arrhythmias are reviewed, as are the means whereby antiarrhythmic drugs might be expected to modify arrhythmias. The cellular electrophysiologic effects of the following antiarrhythmic drugs are discussed: quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide, lidocaine, tocainide, mexiletine, phenytoin, beta-blocking and slow-channel-blocking drugs, aprindine, bretylium, ethmozin, and amiodarone. A knowledge of the similarities and differences of their actions on the determinants of conduction, on repolarization and refractoriness, on automatic mechanisms, and on afterdepolarizations, when considered in the context of the mechanism of clinically occurring tachyarrhythmias, may provide the correct framework for the choice of an appropriate agent for the control of an individual disorder of rhythm. However, it is emphasized that neither the precise mechanism of various dysrhythmias nor the fundamental basis for the salutary action of antiarrhythmic compounds is completely understood.", 
    "45": "Chronic valproate therapy induces symptomatic tremor in about 10% of patients. We studied the effects of propranolol, amantadine, diphenhydramine, benztropine, and cyproheptadine on these tremors in 19 patients by using serial accelerometric recordings. Propranolol was clearly the most therapeutic. Amantadine was moderately effective, but cyproheptadine, diphenhydramine, and benztropine gave little or no relief.", 
    "46": "The tumor promoters, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), phorbol-12,13-didecanoate, teleocidin, and dihydroteleocidin, at nM levels, but not the non-tumor-promoting 4 alpha-phorbol-12,13-didecanoate even at microM concentrations, stimulated arachidonic acid metabolism in cultured rat liver cells. These liver cells synthesize primarily prostaglandin I2 [measured as its nonenzymatic hydrolytic product, 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (PGF1 alpha)]. The production of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha increased with time of incubation with TPA and was essentially complete in 4 hr. Cycloheximide, at nM levels, blocked the TPA-stimulated 6-keto-PGF1 alpha production in a dose-dependent manner; this inhibition was related to inhibition of protein synthesis. Chelation of Ca2+ by ethyleneglycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid, treatment of the cells with the Ca2+ channel blocker, nifedipine, or inhibition of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization by 8-(diethylamine)octyl-3,4, 5-trimethoxybenzoate hydrochloride also inhibited TPA-stimulated 6-keto-PGF1 alpha production. The steroidal antiinflammatory drug, dexamethasone, a potent in vivo inhibitor of tumor promotion, was an inhibitor of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha stimulation by TPA.",

Initial management usually includes hospital admission and, ideally, care by a specialized team involving Physician, Surgeon and Nursing Staff. Prompt and adequate blood replacement is the most important measure followed by diagnosis, usually based on flexible endoscopy. Specific treatment protocols for peptic ulcer and oesophageal varices aid definitive management.

    "48": "We have performed studies on blood hormone dynamics following intravenous administration of acebutolol, a newly synthesized beta-blocker, and its direct action on the adrenal medulla in vitro. Intravenous injection of acebutolol into anesthetized dogs almost doubled the plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline concentrations within 5 to 15 minutes, while renin activity was reduced to approximately two-thirds of the pre-administration level. When arrhythmia was induced in dogs with ouabain, the plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline levels increased to 220 +/- 109 and 392 +/- 84 pg/ml, respectively, from the basal levels of 44 +/- 24 and 140 +/- 43 pg/ml. The restoration of sinus rhythm following the administration of acebutolol was accompanied by a further increase in the plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline levels to 797 +/- 364 and 1226 +/- 263 pg/ml, respectively. A perifusion experiment indicated that acebutolol directly accelerated catecholamine release from the adrenal medulla in pigs.", 
    "49": "The short-term efficacy of diltiazem (D) has been compared to that of propranolol (P), in a group of 70 patients hospitalized in the Coronary Care Unit for unstable angina, defined as recent (less than one month) appearance or aggravation of spontaneous chest pains. Among the 70 patients, 24 had angina only at rest. The patients have been divided into two groups according to ST-T changes during chest pain: 29 with ST elevation (group A) and 41 with other repolarization abnormalities (group B). Treatment was then randomized in each group. Treatment Treatment was considered successful only if spontaneous chest pains disappeared completely. Thirty-four patients were treated with D (282 +/- 102 mg/day) and 36 with P (158 +/- 81 mg/day). In the whole group and in groups A and B considered individually, responses to D and P did not differ. Among the 24 patients with angina exclusively at rest, nine successes and four failures were observed with D. There was no symptomatic relief among the 11 patients treated by P (P = 0.001). Moreover, the number of episodes of angina was decreased by D and unchanged by P, while eight out of the 11 failures with P were immediate successes when treatment was replaced with D. These results suggest that D is preferable to P for management of unstable angina in patients with angina which is exclusively spontaneous.", 
    "50": "Labetalol is a competitive antagonist of alpha 1-, beta 1-, and beta 2-adrenergic receptors. The hemodynamic effects of the drug include reduced blood pressure, heart rate, and peripheral resistance, with little change in resting cardiac output or stroke volume. In open trials and controlled studies, labetalol was an effective antihypertensive. Labetalol compared favorably with beta-blockers alone or in combination with vasodilators, for the treatment of hypertension. Reductions in heart rate are less pronounced with labetalol as compared with propranolol. Labetalol produces rapid reductions in blood pressure when administered intravenously for severe hypertension. The most frequent adverse reactions to the drug include fatigue, postural symptoms, headache, and gastrointestinal complaints. Labetalol may prove advantageous when vasodilation in addition to beta-blockade is desired, or for selected patients experiencing adverse effects attributable to beta-blockade. Until the clinical profile of labetalol is better defined, the use of the drug should be limited.", 
    "51": "The action of nifedipine given first intravenously and then orally was studied in nine patients undergoing investigation for angina pectoris who were already receiving atenolol (100-200 mg/daily) and who had been shown to be fully beta blocked (reduction in maximal heart rate by greater than 25%). Intravenous nifedipine 7.5 micrograms/kg reduced both systolic blood pressure and left ventricular pressure (dP/dt) transiently; both values were significantly lower five and 10 minutes after the infusion of nifedipine but were not significantly different from control values at 20 minutes. There was minimal but pronounced depression of atrioventricular nodal function after giving intravenous nifedipine, though this was detected only when sensitive tests of atrioventricular nodal function were used. These effects were also transient, showing no significant change from control values at 20 minutes. Atrioventricular nodal conduction time and sinus rate were unchanged. Radionuclide angiography of patients taking the oral combination of atenolol and nifedipine for chronic angina showed no change in ejection fraction compared with those taking atenolol alone, but there was a small increase in peak ejection rate. Resting blood pressure and heart rate were unchanged and the PR interval did not lengthen. Peak heart rate and systolic blood pressure showed no alteration on exercise testing when the drugs were combined compared with the response with atenolol alone. Despite the negative inotropic influence when nifedipine was given intravenously, the absence of haemodynamic deterioration when oral nifedipine is combined with atenolol has confirmed that this combination can be used safely in patients with normal left ventricular function. The minimal changes in atrioventricular nodal function cannot be detected on the surface electrocardiogram and are not of clinical importance in patients with normal conduction.", 
    "52": "Increased renal production of prostaglandins are thought to be important for the maintenance of kidney blood flow in advanced cirrhosis. In alert, unanesthetized dogs with chronic cirrhosis and ascites, produced by bile duct ligation, we measured inulin and p-aminohippurate (PAH) clearance before and after the intravenous administration of 2 mg/kg indomethacin, an inhibitor of prostaglandin production. Inulin and PAH clearance declined by 42 and 43%, respectively. This decline in renal perfusion was not associated with changes in blood pressure or cardiac output. If portal hypertension was prevented by creating an end-side portacaval anastomosis at the time of bile duct ligation, indomethacin was without effect on renal perfusion whether or not the dog had ascites. If ascites was completely mobilized in cirrhotic dogs with portal venous hypertension with the aid of a LeVeen valve, indomethacin depressed inulin and PAH clearance as usual during the steady-state period once all ascites had been removed. An attempt was made to determine some of the factors mediating the apparent increase in renal prostaglandin synthesis by administering various pharmacological antagonists. The inhibition of angiotensin effect with saralasin and the inhibition of kallikrein with aprotinin prevented the usual indomethacin effect. It is concluded that portal hypertension, but not a \"sick liver per se, in cirrhosis activates the renin-angiotensin system to both produce renal vasoconstriction and stimulate prostaglandin synthesis, thereby normalizing renal perfusion. Renal kallikrein also appears to play a role, probably by augmenting renin release.", 
    "53": "Supraventricular arrhythmias continue to complicate the postoperative course of patients undergoing myocardial revascularization. In a previous study, we showed a decrease in arrhythmias if patients were given digitalis prior to operation. Since that time we have made two changes-- propranolol is no longer discontinued prior to operation and cold hyperkalemic cardioplegic solution is routinely used. To assess the affect of these changes on arrhythmias, we repeated the previous study. One hundred twenty patients all receiving preoperative and postoperative propranolol were randomized into a control group and a digitalis-treated group. The incidence of supraventricular arrhythmia postoperatively was 21.4% in the control group and 3.1% in the digitalis group (p less than 0.005). Therefore, we continue to advise preoperative digitalization in patients requiring coronary artery bypass and continue to maintain beta blocker and digitalis therapy in the postoperative period.", 
    "54": "Oral atenolol (25 mg twice daily and 50 mg and 100 mg once daily) and placebo were tested as additional therapy in a double-masked, randomised, cross-over study. Twenty-four patients (16 with chronic simple glaucoma and 6 with ocular hypertension) participated who had an intraocular pressure (IOP) higher than 21 mmHg. The mean fall of intraocular pressure varied between 28% and 36% and was observed 2 to 6 hours after administration. After 2 weeks of treatment there was still a small fall in intraocular pressure (13%) after 12 hours (for the 25 mg dose) and 24 hours (for the 50 mg and 100 mg dose), but this was not significant (p less than 0.5). There was a fall in blood pressure and reduced pulse rate which persisted for at least 30 hours. Some patients complained of tiredness during treatment periods. Oral atenolol may be useful additional therapy for glaucoma.", 
    "55": "The stimulating effect of ATP on insulin secretion has been demonstrated by several authors both in vitro and in vivo. The kinetic study carried out on the isolated perfused pancreas of the rat, in the presence of a glucose concentration of 1.5 g/l, showed that the response was biphasic and dose-dependent for ATP concentrations ranging from 10(-6) to 10(-4) M. It can be seen from the results obtained with the natural nucleotides (ATP, ADP, AMP, adenosine, GTP, ITP, UTP, CTP), that there is a structure activity relationship. Some structural features are essential to elicit an insulin secretory effect: a purine base and 2 or 3 phosphate groups. The study with the structural analogues of ATP and ADP modified on the polyphosphate chain, shows the importance of the steric and electronic characteristics of the polyphosphate chain for induction of insulin secretion. The insulin-stimulating action of ATP seems to be selectively antagonized by 2, 2' pyridylisatogen. It is blocked neither by a cholinergic blocker (atropine), nor by a beta-adrenergic blocker (propranolol), nor by an adenosine antagonist (theophylline). In the present state of the experimental work, the results favour a purinergic receptor site to ATP or ADP on the beta-insulin-secretory cells. At least three factors are in favour of a type P2 receptor, according to the classification of purinergic receptors (Burnstock, 1978) : the order of relative potencies of the agonists: ATP greater than or equal to ADP much greater than AMP greater than or equal to adenosine, the lack of antagonist effect of theophylline and the selective antagonism of PIT.", 
    "56": "An accidental observation led to the suspicion that propranolol (P) enhances the effect of exogenous ACTH on plasma cortisol. To examine this matter further, large-dose ACTH tests (25 IU im) were performed in 10 normal young males: i) without treatment (n =10); ii) after 11/2 days of P treatment (n = 10); iii) after 11/2 days of metoprolol treatment (n = 6). Six other subjects received infusions of 0.2 IU of ACTH/hour for 12 h: i) without pretreatment; ii) after 11/2 days of P treatment. P pretreatment (80 mg t.i.d.) led to a small but significant decrease in plasma cortisol (9.4 +/- 0.8 micrograms/100 mg; mean +/- SE, vs. 11.3 +/- 0.7 micrograms/100 ml in controls). The maximum percentage increase of plasma cortisol after ACTH injection was 383% +/- 35% (mean +/- SE) after P and 253% +/- 22% in controls (p less than 0.05). The enhancement of the absolute and relative increase of plasma cortisol after ACTH injection seems to be mainly due to lowering of basal cortisol levels, since the effect of ACTH on plasma cortisol in normal subjects in inversely related to basal cortisol. The effect of metoprolol on basal cortisol and the cortisol response to ACTH was less pronounced than that of P. In the long-term-infusion study the effect of P was less apparent than in the acute study. P had no significant effect on basal plasma aldosterone or on the aldosterone response to ACTH.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "57": "The cytosolic Ca2+ activity of insulin-releasing clonal cells (RINm5F) was studied with the intracellular fluorescent indicator quin-2. When the extracellular Ca2+ concentration was 1 mM, the basal cytosolic Ca2+ activity was 101 +/- 5 nM. Depolarization with 25 mM K+ increased this Ca2+ activity to at least 318 nM, an effect completely reversed by the voltage-dependent channel blocker D-600. In the presence of K+ alone these channels appeared to have a half-life of 6.7 +/- 0.8 min. In contrast to the action of K+, exposure of the RINm5F cells to 4 mM glucose resulted in a reduction of the cytosolic Ca2+ activity. This effect was observed during K+ depolarization but was more pronounced under basal conditions when it amounted to 20%. The data provide the first direct evidence that glucose can decrease the cytosolic Ca2+ activity in beta-cells. Unlike the case in normal beta-cells the glucose effect on the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels in the RINm5F cells is apparently not sufficient to overcome the intracellular buffering of Ca2+. A defective depolarization is therefore a probable cause of the failing insulin secretion of RINm5F cells exposed to glucose.", 
    "58": "Using a competitive binding assay the effects of 2-hydroxyestradiol-17 beta, 4-hydroxyestradiol-17 beta, estradiol-17 beta and progesterone on the binding of tritiated catecholaminergic ligands to membrane preparations from rat brain and pituitary gland were studied. Up to a concentration of 10(-5) M none of the steroids tested was able to displace [3H]spiroperidol, [3H]dihydroergocryptine or [3H]dihydroalprenolol. The data suggest that the catecholestrogens do not interfere directly with the binding of catecholaminergic ligands to dopaminergic, alpha-adrenergic or beta-adrenergic receptors in the central nervous system. The view that a catechol structure is not essential for the interaction with dopaminergic receptors was further supported by the results obtained from additional studies on the competition of O-methylated and deaminated dopamine metabolites with [3H]spiroperidol binding.", 
    "59": "Evidence was obtained for catecholamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in particulate fractions of frog and rabbit corneal epithelium. Epinephrine (10(-5)M) stimulated adenylate cyclase by 22 and 53% in the frog and rabbit, respectively. The corresponding changes were statistically significant (P less than 0.01) when the data was analyzed using paired variates. Preincubation with 10(-4)M propranolol eliminated any stimulatory effect by 10(-5)M isoproterenol. Adenylate cyclase activity derived from either source was activated several fold by either 10 mM NaF or 10(-5)MGpp (NH)p. Soluble fractions of homogenized frog corneal epithelium contained cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase activity which was half-maximally stimulated by about 6 nM cyclic AMP. Evidence was also obtained for the presence of protein substrates of cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase in frog corneal epithelium. With exogenous cyclic AMP and protein kinase, a rapid 32P labelling of proteins having approximate molecular weights of 56, 46, 23 and 21 K was obtained with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A less marked and slower increase in phosphoprotein formation was observed when corneal membranes were incubated with cyclic AMP in the absence of added protein kinase.", 
    "60": "Bovine parathyroid hormone and its N-terminal (1-34) peptide fragment (bPTH-(1-34] are known to possess direct hypotensive activity in the rat. The purpose of the present study was to determine if bPTH-(1-34) possessed a direct chronotropic action as well. In vivo studies revealed that bPTH-(1-34) did produce a chronotropic effect in the rat comprising both a direct component as well as a reflex tachycardia related to its hypotensive actions. In vitro studies of isolated right atria indicated that while bPTH-(1-34) had no positive inotropic effect, it did produce significant chronotropic effects which were direct and dose-dependent. The potency of bPTH-(1-34) was found to be similar to that of isoproterenol, however, it was only one-third as effective as isoproterenol in maximally increasing atrial rate. A slight but significant increase in atrial cyclic AMP was generated prior to the chronotropic actions of bPTH-(1-34).", 
    "61": "Bradykinin (BK, 0.03-3.11 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1) was infused intravenously for 4-5.5 h to assess its effects on pulmonary transvascular fluid and protein exchange in three groups of artificially ventilated sheep prepared with lung lymph fistulas. In group I, BK was infused alone for 5.5 h. In group II, BK and captopril (SQ 14,225), an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), were infused together because the effects of BK may be attenuated by its rapid degradation in the lung by ACE. In group III, BK was infused in the presence of propranolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist, to prevent any permeability-decreasing effects of beta-adrenergic activation. The dosages of BK used, which decreased systemic arterial blood pressure by 10-20 mmHg, did not alter either pulmonary transvascular fluid and protein exchange or pulmonary hemodynamics at any time during infusion of BK alone or in combination with captopril or propranolol. Raising pulmonary microvascular pressure (Pmv) by inflating a left atrial balloon during the last 2 h of infusion in all three groups slightly increased pulmonary lymph flow and markedly decreased the lymph-to-plasma protein concentration ratio. These results are comparable with those obtained after increasing Pmv in normal anesthetized sheep and indicate that BK did not alter the pulmonary vascular permeability to proteins.", 
    "62": "Experiments on rats were performed to study the role of the monoaminergic systems in the mechanisms of analgesia produced by stress (foot shock) and auricular electroacupuncture (AEA). Analgesia was measured by the hot-plate (HP) and the tail-flick (TF) tests. Inhibition of catecholamine synthesis with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (alpha-MPT) antagonized the AEA-induced analgesia measured by the TF test. alpha-MPT did not influence the HP test latency after AEA, and HP or TF tests after stress. Inhibition of dopamine receptors by haloperidol produced a decrease in the stress- and AEA-induced analgesia. The similar effects were demonstrated in propranolol treated rats after AEA. P-chlorophenylalanine (an inhibitor of serotonin synthesis) suppressed the stress-induced analgesia measured by the HP test and AEA-induced analgesia measured by the HP or TF tests. The data indicate that the monoaminergic systems are involved in the stress- and AEA-induced analgesia. Apart from the monoaminergic systems, other neurochemical mechanisms are also involved in the stress- and AEA-induced analgesia.",

    "64": "beta-Adrenergic receptors were demonstrated in membrane preparations from 6 human Ewing's sarcomas and compared to those from 46 other pediatric cancers with the use of the beta-adrenergic antagonist (-)-(3H)dihydroalprenolol [(-)[3H]DHA]. In contrast to the high numbers of receptor sites found in Ewing's sarcomas (55-640 fmol x mg-1 protein; dissociation constant Kd, 1-2 nM), other childhood cancers (neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, brain tumors, lymphoma, osteosarcoma, hepatoblastoma, yolk sac, and Wilms' tumor) contained in general fewer beta-adrenergic receptor sites. Characteristics of (-)-[3H]DHA binding were therefore more fully characterized in the Ewing's tumors. Competition of (-)-[3H]DHA binding by classical catecholamine agonists, as well as by subtype selective agents metoprolol and zinterol, demonstrated the presence of a homogeneous population of beta 1-adrenergic sites in several Ewing's tumors. Adenylate cyclase activity in all Ewing's sarcomas was enhanced by GTP and NaF. However, in spite of high numbers of beta-adrenergic receptors, (-)-isoproterenol was not very effective in the activation of adenylate cyclase activity in several of the Ewing's tumors tested. Neither guanyl-5'-yl-imidophosphate nor GTP altered agonist potency for the receptor site in these catecholamine-insensitive tumors. Hill coefficients obtained from the competition experiments with (-)-isoproterenol (in the presence or absence of guanine nucleotide) were approximately 1.0. These uncoupled receptors were resistant to N-ethylmaleimide denaturation and were densensitized only 50% during culture in the presence of (-)-isoproterenol. Thus Ewing's sarcomas are relatively rich in beta-adrenergic sites, and several tumors appear to have a coupling lesion involving guanine nucleotide-dependent regulatory protein interaction with beta-adrenergic receptors and adenylate cyclase, similar in phenotype to that described in the (unc) variant of S49 mouse lymphoma.", 
    "65": "This study examined the renal excretory response to behavioral stress (aversive conditioning) in conscious dogs during infusion of beta adrenoceptor antagonists that either readily cross, or that do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier. With saline infusion alone (n = 7), behavioral stress decreased sodium excretion (-47 +/- 7% from 345 microEq/min) and urine flow rate (-48 +/- 5% from 2.1 ml/min). In the same dogs, infusion of propranolol, which readily crosses the blood-brain barrier, abolished the sodium excretion and urine flow rate responses to behavioral stress (-2 +/- 6% from 527 microEq/min and -5 +/- 3% from 3.0 ml/min, respectively). In a different group of dogs (n = 5), infusion of timolol or oxprenolol, antagonists that cross the blood-brain barrier less readily than propranolol, did not abolish the excretory response to behavioral stress. Behavioral stress decreased sodium excretion and urine flow rate during timolol infusion (-38 +/- 6% from 452 microEq/min and -36 +/- 6% from 2.4 ml/min, respectively) and oxprenolol infusion (-25 +/- 9% from 328 microEq/min and -19 +/- 8% from 1.8 ml/min, respectively). With saline infusion alone in these same dogs, behavioral stress decreased sodium excretion (-48 +/- 7% from 316 microEq/min) and urine flow rate (-40 +/- 7% from 1.7 ml/min). Mean arterial pressure increased similarly among all conditions in this study. Since the three antagonists accumulate to a high degree in the kidney, but only propranolol abolished the excretory response to behavioral stress, renal beta adrenoceptors did not appear to mediate the excretory response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "66": "Hepatic alpha-1, alpha-2 and beta-2 adrenoceptors were characterized during development of the rat through Scatchard analysis of [3H]prazosin, [3H]rauwolscine and [125I]pindolol binding to liver membrane preparations. Major changes in adrenoceptor numbers occur shortly before birth at weaning. The fetal rat liver is characterized by a large number of alpha-2 adrenoceptors, which falls 10-fold by birth. The number of hepatic beta-2 adrenoceptors decreases gradually during development, and is lower at all times than the number of alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptors. The developmental profile of the hepatic alpha-1 adrenoceptor is biphasic: there is a 2 to 3-fold fall in alpha-1 adrenoceptor number at birth and a 3- to 5-fold rise at weaning. While absolute numbers of alpha-1 and beta-2 adrenoceptors do not correlate precisely with reported actions of epinephrine and norepinephrine on hepatic metabolism during ontogeny, the increasing ratio of alpha-1/beta-2 hepatic adrenoceptors may contribute to the conversion from predominantly beta effects of catecholamines reported in fetal and suckling rat liver to the predominantly alpha-1 effects that are well documented in the adult male rat.", 
    "67": "These experiments were designed to study the role of calcium in the modulation of renin secretion by alpha and beta adrenoceptors. Rabbit kidneys were isolated and single-pass perfused with a modified Ringer's solution. Renal perfusion pressure was precisely controlled by an electronic servocontrol system. Tubular events were minimized by ligation of the ureter before initiating the studies. Under these conditions the predominant factor modifying renin secretion was assumed to originate directly on the juxtaglomerular cells. Isoproterenol infused at 0.1, 0.5, 1.0 and 5.0 nM/min/g of kidney weight increased renin secretion in a dose-dependent manner whereas phenylephrine infused at identical molar doses did not. In addition, phenylephrine (5.0 nM/min/g of kidney weight) blocked the usual response to isoproterenol. Removal of calcium from the perfusing medium had no effect on either the response to isoproterenol or the lack of a response to phenylephrine. On the other hand, when calcium is removed from the perfusate or when D-600, a calcium channel blocker, is added to calcium-containing medium, phenylephrine failed to block the usual response to isoproterenol. We conclude that the suppression of beta adrenoceptor stimulation of renin release by alpha adrenoceptor agonists is calcium dependent by a final mechanism as yet undefined, but probably involving movement of calcium into the juxtaglomerular cells.", 
    "68": "To elucidate the biochemical basis of airway hyperreactivity, we studied the relationships between in vivo airway sensitivity of guinea pigs to histamine and their tracheal beta-adrenergic binding sites, Ca++- and (Na+-K+)-ATPase activities, and composition of phospholipids. The relationships between tracheal and plasma phospholipids were also examined. beta-Adrenergic receptor binding with 3H-dihydroalprenolol in tracheal tissue showed an inverse relationship with in vivo airway sensitivity to histamine. Among the phospholipids, tracheal phosphatidyl ethanolamine content varied inversely with in vivo airway sensitivity, whereas tracheal and plasma lysophosphatidyl choline contents showed a direct correlation with airway sensitivity. A significant direct correlation was also observed between tracheal and plasma lysophosphatidyl choline levels. Both Ca++-ATPase and (Na+-K+)-ATPase activities increased with increasing airway sensitivity. These enzymes showed inverse correlations with phosphatidyl ethanolamine content and direct correlations with lysophosphatidyl choline content. Our data suggest that increased lysophosphatidyl choline may cause various biochemical changes associated with airway hyperreactivity.", 
    "69": "In order to assess the adrenergic contribution to hypoglycemic glucose counterregulation in type I diabetes mellitus and to determine whether the adrenergic contribution is mediated through beta 1- or beta 2-adrenergic receptors, hypoglycemia was induced by an i.v. insulin infusion (30 mU/m2 x min) for 60 min in 11 insulin-dependent diabetic patients (IDDM), 5 with normal plasma glucagon responses and 6 with blunted responses, and also in 7 age-weight-matched nondiabetic subjects. Rates of plasma glucose decrease and postnadir increase, as well as plasma concentrations of free insulin and of counterregulatory hormones, were measured when insulin was infused alone, and when insulin was infused along with propranolol (a beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptor antagonist) or metoprolol (a selective beta 1-antagonist). Postnadir plasma glucose recovery was decreased in IDDM with blunted plasma glucagon responses (21 +/- 0.8 mumol x L-1 x min-1, P less than 0.001), but was normal in patients with normal plasma glucagon responses (30 +/- 0.4 versus 33 +/- 0.5 mumol x L-1 x min-1 in nondiabetic subjects, P = NS). Postnadir plasma glucose recovery was not affected by either propranolol or metoprolol in normal subjects and in IDDM with normal glucagon responses. However, in IDDM with blunted plasma glucagon responses, postnadir plasma glucose recovery was further decreased by propranolol (14 +/- 0.6 mumol x L-1 x min-1, P less than 0.01), but was unaffected by metoprolol (22 +/- 0.9 mumol x L-1 x min-1, P = NS).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "70": "To more fully characterize the alterations in myocardial adrenergic and cholinergic receptors induced by the diabetic state, we investigated the binding characteristics of (--) [3H] dihydroalprenolol to beta adrenergic receptors (bAR), [3H] prazosin to alpha adrenergic receptors (aAR), and [3H] quinuclidinyl-benzilate to muscarinic cholinergic receptors (MCR) in myocardial membranes derived from rats 8 wk after treatment with streptozotocin. We also studied an equal number of animals from three control groups: free-eating nondiabetics, pair-weighted nondiabetics, and streptozotocin-treated animals treated daily with insulin. Diabetic hearts demonstrated 27% fewer bAR (P less than 0.01) and 31% fewer aAR (P less than 0.01) than free-eating controls, without changes in MCR, and without changes in antagonist affinity, agonist affinity, or agonist slope factor (pseudo-Hill coefficient) for any class of receptors. Food restriction had no effect on receptor characteristics, and treatment of diabetic rats with insulin prevented any downregulation of cardiac bAR or aAR. The parallel decrease in both bAR and aAR suggests that streptozotocin-induced hypothyroidism is not the primary causative factor of bAR downregulation in this model, since hypothyroidism produces upregulation of aAR. Furthermore, the lack of change in cardiac MCR suggests that the adrenergic receptor alterations are not the result of nonspecific abnormalities of protein synthesis in the diabetic heart. Further studies are required to establish the physiologic significance of these receptor alterations, but these data support the hypothesis that altered adrenergic receptor properties may underlie, at least in part, the chronotropic and inotropic abnormalities of cardiac performance that are associated with the diabetic state.", 
    "71": "In order to asses the possibility that degeneration release of noradrenaline influences the survival of critical skin flaps, we studied the effect of various antiadrenergic drugs on skin-flap levels of noradrenaline, ATP, and cyclic AMP. Reserpine treatment depleted the skin flaps of noradrenaline and counteracted the fall in ATP and the cyclic AMP accumulation. Guanethidine had similar but less pronounced effects. Propranolol did not affect noradrenaline levels or depletion rate, but reduced the metabolic stimulation, as assessed by cyclic AMP levels in the flap. Phentolamine had no effect on basal noradrenaline levels, but tended to accelerate its disappearance and reduce lactate accumulation, a measure of hypoxia. All these drugs are known to increase skin-flap survival. It is suggested that they do so by, respectively, depleting the flap of its content of noradrenaline prior to operation or preventing the vasoconstriction and metabolic stimulation caused by released noradrenaline.", 
    "72": "Ventricular arrhythmias are thought to be responsible for the high incidence of sudden death among patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOC). 24-h ECG recording was applied to 27 HOC patients before any treatment and repeated under beta-blockade with propranolol in doses not lower than 320 mg/day (mean dose : 354 mg/day). ECG tracings showed that 26/27 patients (96%) had ventricular arrhythmia; the arrhythmia was repetitive in 15 patients (55%), 3 of whom (11%) had bouts of ventricular tachycardia. These figures are very different from those found in normal subjects, i.e. : 40-50% ventricular arrhythmia and less than 5% repetitive arrhythmia. The most severe forms of ventricular arrhythmia (categories IVA and IVB in the Ryan, Lown and Horn classification) were exclusively seen in patients who had one or several syncopes. Statistically, the only positive correlations of arrhythmias were with age and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure on the one hand, and age and left ventricular systolic pressure gradient on the other hand. Propranolol had no effect on arrhythmia, which seems to contradict studies suggesting that high doses of propranolol play a substantial role in the prevention of sudden death among patients with HOC. Beta-blockers might act by preventing the transformation of arrhythmia into ventricular fibrillation.", 
    "73": "The ultrastructural changes of the white Wistar rat kidney, preserved by cold storage into two preservation media (Sacks and Plasmagel) are reported. For each medium two groups of kidney were used; for one of them the medium was used without additives and for the other stabilizing additives were added. The results showed the favourable effects of additives on the maintenance of the cellular ultrastructure during preservation, and more important the damages incurred when Plasmagel was used.", 
    "74": "The effects of intravenous (iv) nifedipine (7.5 micrograms/kg over 10 min) on systemic hemodynamics and myocardial contractility were investigated under steady state conditions of halothane anesthesia (0.5 MAC) in 8 patients scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass surgery. All patients received long-term medication in the form of beta adrenergic receptor blockers and had a normal global left ventricular function at rest. Halothane produced a marked reduction in left ventricular contractility as documented by a considerable fall in LV max dP/dt. Nifedipine caused a small additional depression of LV max dP/dt without affecting LVEDP significantly. The slight myocardial depressant effect of nifedipine was counterbalanced by a concomitant reduction in left ventricular afterload due to a decrease in the systemic vascular resistance resulting in unchanged or even improved cardiac output. The results indicate that iv nifedipine in the doses used here is safe for patients with ischemic heart disease, even in the presence of already compromised myocardial contractility due to halothane anesthesia and chronic low-dose beta blocker therapy.", 
    "75": "The interaction of bromoacetylalprenololmenthane (BrAlpM), an irreversible beta adrenergic receptor antagonist, with rat parotid acinar cells was studied in vitro. In the presence of BrAlpM, the rate of (-)-isoproterenol-induced exocrine secretion from cells, measured as percentage of amylase release, was markedly reduced. The concentration of (-)-isoproterenol required to elicit half-maximal protein secretion was about 100 times greater (5 microM) in the presence of 1 microM BrAlpM than in control incubations (0.05 microM). BrAlpM and propranolol were similar in their ability to inhibit parotid protein release (IC50 approximately 10(-7) M). To demonstrate that BrAlpM functioned as an irreversible beta adrenergic antagonist, cells were preincubated with BrAlpM for varying amounts of time and then washed three to six times before adding (-)-isoproterenol. At least 10 min preincubation was required to show irreversibility. Alprenolol, under the same preincubation conditions, was unable to inhibit amylase release. BrAlpM inhibited the binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol to parotid beta adrenoreceptors over a concentration range similar to that required for inhibition of protein secretion. Cells incubated in the absence or presence of BrAlpM displayed a comparable morphologic appearance when viewed by light and electron microscopy. The degree of inhibition of isoproterenol-induced exocytosis of secretory granules by BrAlpM appeared to vary from cell to cell. These findings suggest that BrAlpM should be a useful probe to study beta adrenoreceptor function and metabolism in rat parotid acinar cells.", 
    "76": "Adrenergic effects on TSH and subunit secretion were investigated in bovine anterior pituitary monolayer cultures. Epinephrine (E) (10(-6) M) caused a significant increase in TSH, alpha-subunit, and TSH beta release into the medium (P less than 0.001, P less than 0.001, and P less than 0.01, respectively). E, norepinephrine, and phenylephrine, all alpha-adrenergic agonists, caused significant increases in TSH release, with half-maximal effects at 4.3 X 10(-7), 6.8 X 10(-7), and 8.2 X 10(-7) M, respectively. However, isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic agonist (10(-7)-10(-4) M), did not alter TSH or subunit release. Clonidine, an alpha 2-adrenergic agonist (10(-7)-10(-4) M), had no effect on TSH or subunit secretion; however, coincubation of clonidine (5 X 10(-7) M) with a submaximal concentration of phenylephrine (5 X 10(-7) M) caused a rise in TSH release greater (P less than 0.02) than that seen with P alone. The alpha-adrenergic antagonists phentolamine and fluphenazine completely inhibited (P less than 0.001) the E-induced rise in TSH and subunits. In contrast, the beta-adrenergic antagonists propranolol and metoprolol did not significantly inhibit the stimulation of TSH by E. TSH and subunit secretion is stimulated by adrenergic agonists acting directly on the pituitary, and this is probably mediated via an alpha-adrenergic receptor.", 
    "77": "Although beta blockers' antihypertensive mechanisms have not been clearly delineated, their long-term effects may involve chronic reduction in systemic vascular resistance, which may be the result of sympathetic outflow inhibition. Although a central site of action has been advocated, we sought to identify a peripheral non-cardiac sympatholytic mechanism by studying autonomic function in a small group of nine hypertensive males during treatment with placebo and chronic oral nadolol, a noncardioselective hydrophilic beta blocker with little predicted brain penetration. Nadolol reduced blood pressure and heart rate (both P less than 0.005) while suppressing the blood pressure response to cold stimulus only after parasympathetic inhibition (P less than 0.05); the blunted response to cold stimulus did not correlate with the drug's overall blood pressure lowering effect. Baroreceptor sensitivities to phenylephrine and amyl nitrate stimuli were not enhanced. Several biochemical measures of sympathetic nervous system activity were not influenced by nadolol. Thus, nadolol, while not enhancing baroreflex sensitivity, does seem to have a peripheral non-cardiac sympatholytic effect, but this effect does not account entirely for the long term reduction in blood pressure observed in patients on the drug.", 
    "78": "The inhibition of aggregation of rat platelets treated with betaadrenoceptor blocking drugs alprenolol, exaprolol, metipranolol, practolol and propranolol, and stimulated with adenosinediphosphate was shown to be dose-dependent. Atenolol in all concentrations potentiated the aggregation. The stimulated aggregation was potentiated by low and decreased by high concentrations of doberol. Cyclic adenosinemonophosphate was decreased in platelets treated with all the betaadrenoceptor blocking drugs used. On the other hand, a dose-dependent increase in the cyclic guanosinemonophosphate content was evident in betaadrenoceptor blocker-treated platelets. The interaction of betaadrenoceptor blocking drugs with the aggregation of blood platelets seems not to be mediated through cyclic nucleotides.", 
    "79": "The influence of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists on the spontaneous rate and on force of contraction of the myocardium was studied independently on spontaneously beating right and electrically driven isolated left atria of rabbit. On spontaneous rate, practolol had sympathomimetic effect only, N-isopropylmethoxamine (IMA), had both sympathomimetic as well as depressant effects, whereas alprenolol, procinolol, bunolol and H 35/25 had depressant effects only in higher concentrations. The order of potency was procinolol greater than bunolol greater than alprenolol greater than H 35/25 greater than and IMA. On the contractions of isolated left atria, all beta-adrenoceptor antagonists produced concentration-dependent depressant effect. In relation to procinolol, these agents were 5-125 times less potent for depressing the contractions of left atria by 15% and the order of beta-potency was procinolol greater than alprenolol greater than bunolol = H 35/25 greater than IMA greater than and practolol. The present results indicate that the depressant effects of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists on spontaneous rate of right atria and on contraction of isolated left atria are not related to each other."
