    "0": "1. Isoprenaline injection into either the unanaesthetized ovine foetus or the pregnant ewe produced a transient tachycardia and hypotension in either the ewe or the foetus. No evidence was obtained for placental transfer, in either direction, of pharmacologically active isoprenaline.2. Propranolol, when given to the ewe intravenously, produced bradycardia and increased pulse pressure and inhibited the response of both the ewe and her foetus to isoprenaline. Propranolol, when given to the foetus intravenously, produced bradycardia and increased pulse pressure in both the foetus and the ewe, but only the foetal response to isoprenaline was inhibited. These data demonstrated that propranolol crossed the ovine placenta in both directions in a pharmacologically active form.3. Dose-heart rate curves of the foetus and pregnant ewe to isoprenaline and the shift to the right of the isoprenaline dose-response curves by propranolol were similar in both the ewe and the foetus.4. Notwithstanding the similarities between the ewe and foetus in their responses to isoprenaline or propranolol and in the antagonism of isoprenaline by propranolol, the duration of blockade following propranolol administration to the ewe was 2 to 3 times longer in the foetus compared with the ewe.5. Measurement of blood levels of propranolol showed that the maximum concentration of propranolol in foetal plasma was only 5% of that in the pregnant ewe when propranolol was infused into the ewe; the rate of clearance of propranolol was similar from the foetal and maternal plasma.6. From these data the long duration of beta-adrenoceptor blockade in the ovine foetus by propranolol cannot be fully explained. However, these data serve as examples of the dangers involved when extrapolating pharmacological actions of drugs on the foetus purely from data on foetal plasma levels of the drug.7. The data suggest that multiple doses of propranolol, given to maintain a beta-adrenoceptor blockade in the mother, could result in serious cumulative effects in the foetus.", 
    "1": "1. The effect of the method of killing on the concentration of glycogen in mouse brain was determined. The cerebral glycogen content of mice killed by immersion in liquid nitrogen did not differe significantly from that of animals decapitated and the heads immediately frozen. A delay before freezing led to the rapid loss of brain glycogen, with a 17% fall at 10 s and an 82% loss after 5 min.2. Hyperglycaemia, induced by the administration of D-glucose, resulted in an 8.3% loss of brain glycogen after 120 min. Insulin hypoglycaemia produced a 10.7% fall in glycogen at 60 min followed by an 11.2% increase at 120 min.3. Exposure to either high (32 degrees C) or low (10 degrees C) ambient temperatures caused a depletion of brain glycogen.4. A circadian rhythm of brain glycogen concentration was found, with a nadir which was coincident with the peak of locomotor activity and body temperature.5. Drugs from several pharmacological classes were studied for their in vivo effect on the concentration of glycogen in mouse brain.6. Brain glycogen was increased by all the depressant drugs tested, and by some drugs which had little effect on behaviour (diphenhydramine, phenytoin and propranolol), or which caused excitation (caffeine and nialamide).7. Glycogen was depleted only by amphetamine-like compounds or by bemegride-induced convulsions.8. The results are discussed with particular reference to the possible relation between catecholamines and glycogen metabolism in the brain.", 
    "2": "1. Ventricular ectopic beats were recorded in eight of thirteen conscious horses following the intravenous administration of adrenaline in doses of 3 mug/kg. Following pre-treatment with either atropine sulphate (0.1 mg/kg) or propranolol hydrochloride (0.1 mg/kg), the same dose level of adrenaline failed to produce ventricular ectopic beats.2. Halothane anaesthesia sensitized the equine heart to the arrhythmogenic actions of adrenaline; the incidence and duration of ventricular arrhythmias being greater than in conscious animals. In comparison with the findings in conscious horses, ether anaesthesia appeared to protect the heart against adrenaline-induced arrhythmias.3. From a comparison of the arrhythmogenic, chronotropic and pressor actions of adrenaline, noradrenaline and isoprenaline during halothane anaesthesia, it was concluded that sensitization to the arrhythmogenic actions of catecholamines resulted primarily from the action of halothane on the ventricle. The results also indicated that the pressor responses to catecholamines during halothane anaesthesia probably played some part in the genesis of arrhythmias.4. No \"spontaneous\" ventricular arrhythmias were recorded in twenty-four horses anaesthetized with halothane or in sixteen animals under ether anaesthesia.5. The available evidence indicates that a moderate to fairly severe degree of hypercapnia produced little increase in sympathetic control of the myocardium during halothane anaesthesia; the absence of irregularities in ventricular rhythm during halothane anaesthesia were attributed to this factor.", 
    "3": "Eight patients with aortic coarctation were studied at rest and during supine bicycle exercise before and after intravenous propranolol 0.17 mg./kg. The mean pressure gradient across the aortic narrowing increased from 16 to 45 mm. Hg during exercise, and was reduced to 11 and 31 mm. Hg after propranolol. Total peripheral resistance was increased by propranolol both at rest and during exercise, and the diminished pressor response was due to a 20 per cent decrease in exercise cardiac output. Brachial artery systolic pressure was reduced more than central aortic systolic pressure in 2 of the 3 patients in whom both pressures were monitored. In one patient descending aortic pressure fell during exercise; in the remainder, slight increases were noted.", 
    "4": "1. Skins of the lizard Anolis carolinensis darken in vitro in response to melanophore stimulating hormone (MSH), a peptide hormone, as well as to catecholamines. These hormones darken Anolis skins by dispersing the sub-cellular organelle, the melanosome, out into the dendritic processes of the dermal melanophores.2. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP and methylxanthines also darken skins. In addition, methylxanthines are synergistic with both catecholamines and MSH in causing skin darkening. These data suggest that the dispersion of melanosomes within melanophores in response to both MSH and catecholamines is mediated by cyclic AMP.3. alpha-Adrenoceptor blocking agents inhibit MSH-induced darkening but potentiate catecholamine-induced darkening. beta-Adrenoceptor blocking agents, in contrast, inhibit catecholamine-induced darkening but have no effect on MSH-induced darkening. This selective blockade of one receptor while the functional integrity of the other receptor is maintained suggests that MSH and catecholamines increase cyclic AMP levels through different receptors.4. Catecholamines exert their action through beta-adrenoceptors; MSH darkens skins through what appears to be a component of the alpha-adrenoceptor. beta-Adrenoceptor stimulation may stimulate adenyl cyclase to increase cyclic AMP levels whereas MSH may inhibit cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase thereby preventing cyclic AMP breakdown.", 
    "5": "1. The beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity of 1-isopropylamino-3-(4-indanoxy)-2-propanol HCl (USVC 6524) was determined in the anaesthetized dog, the isolated rat uterus and the isolated guinea-pig tracheal strip.2. USVC 6524 inhibited the positive inotropic, positive chronotropic and vasodilator responses to isoprenaline in the dog in a dose of 10 mug/kg and higher. On the basis of comparative pA(2) values, USVC 6524 is approximately 10 times more potent as a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist than propranolol.3. Cardiac depressant effects produced by USVC 6524 were relatively mild and occurred only after the onset of a strong beta-adrenoceptor blockade.4. USVC 6524 also blocked beta-adrenoceptors in the isolated rat uterus and guinea-pig tracheal spiral strip.", 
    "6": "1. The beta-adrenoceptor antagonists propranolol, pronethalol, MJ 1999 and Ciba 39089-Ba reduced responses to field stimulation of the guinea-pig isolated vas deferens preparation without significantly affecting responses to exogenously added noradrenaline.2. This prejunctional blocking action of the drugs cannot be correlated with their action as beta-adrenoceptor antagonists or non-specific depressants.3. The blockade produced was more pronounced at low (5-20 Hz) than at high (50 Hz) frequencies of stimulation.4. The blockade was slow in onset, and once established was poorly reversed by washing the preparation over a period of 1 to 2 h.5. The blockade produced could be reversed by dexamphetamine and cocaine.6. These experiments suggest that the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists may have some actions which closely resemble those of the adrenergic neurone blocking agent guanethidine.", 
    "7": "In order to examine the relation between cardiac state and the capacity to excrete a water load, 10 normal subjects and 61 patients with heart disease were studied during water diuresis. Under these conditions, urine flow approximates to the rate of delivery of filtrate, and therefore of sodium, from the proximal tubule of the kidney to the loop of Henle, while free water clearance is a function of distal sodium reabsorption. In 12 patients with complete heart block, ventricular pacing was associated with increased urine flow and free water clearance. Oral propranolol in 3 normal subjects and in 9 patients with intact atrial septa caused a reduction, and oral practolol in 4 normal subjects and 8 patients caused no change. In 6 patients with atrial septal defect, propranolol was without effect. Maximum urine flow correlated with left ventricular end-diastolic pressure but not mean left atrial pressure in 16 patients with chronic rheumatic heart disease. In 7 patients with ischaemic heart disease, maximum urine flow was higher than in those with chronic rheumatic heart disease and similar increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. These results reflect a close relation between proximal tubular sodium reabsorption and cardiac state, and suggest that inappropriate sodium reabsorption at this site may contribute to fluid retention in heart disease.", 
    "8": "1. In cats anaesthetized with pentobarbitone sodium, infusions of adrenaline, noradrenaline (0.5 mug/kg per min) and isoprenaline (0.25 mug/kg per min) increased myocardial blood flow, myocardial heat production, left ventricular systolic and end-diastolic pressures, left ventricular +ve and -ve dp/dt max, and calculated cardiac output, effort and oxygen consumption. These effects (apart from the effect of noradrenaline on left ventricular systolic pressure) were markedly reduced by previous administration of alprenolol (0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg).2. Infusions of adrenaline and noradrenaline increased arterial diastolic blood pressure and isoprenaline reduced it. After alprenolol the effects of adrenaline and noradrenaline were potentiated and that of isoprenaline abolished; in some experiments isoprenaline increased arterial diastolic pressure after alprenolol. Alprenolol did not influence the increases in arterial systolic pressure which followed the administration of adrenaline and noradrenaline.3. Isoprenaline-induced tachycardia was markedly reduced and adrenaline tachycardia was converted to bradycardia after alprenolol. The bradycardia which occurred during noradrenaline infusions was unaffected.4. After blockade by alprenolol, recovery of the effects of isoprenaline on left ventricular dp/dt and on heart rate occurred more quickly than recovery of the effects on arterial diastolic pressure. This suggests that alprenolol has a greater affinity for beta(2)- than for beta(1)-adrenoceptors.5. Intravenous administration of acetylcholine decreased arterial blood pressure, left ventricular pressure and +ve and -ve dp/dt max. During recovery from these effects there was a marked increase in +ve dp/dt max. which was absent after the administration of alprenolol (0.5 mg/kg). Because this dose of alprenolol is thus able to block the effects of reflex sympathetic cardiac nerve stimulation but does not completely antagonize the effects of exogenous adrenaline on dp/dt, it is suggested that alprenolol may have some adrenergic neurone blocking activity.6. Increases in liver and myocardial blood flow and heat production produced by noradrenaline, adrenaline and isoprenaline were reduced after alprenolol.7. Isoprenaline reduced air-way resistance and this effect was abolished by alprenolol; increases in air-way resistance produced by adrenaline and nor-adrenaline were augmented. All three amines inhibited intestinal smooth muscle contractions in vivo. Only the effect of isoprenaline was reduced by alprenolol.", 
    "9": "1. Propranolol, a beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug with local anaesthetic and a direct myocardial depressant action, and MJ 1999, a beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug which has no local anaesthetic or intrinsic sympathomimetic action, were compared for beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity in man.2. Propranolol was 2.67 times more active than MJ 1999 in reducing by 50% the tachycardia produced by the intravenous infusion of isoprenaline in healthy volunteers.3. Propranolol and MJ 1999 intravenously both reduced resting heart rate in the standing position and an exercise tachycardia, but there was no qualitative or quantitative difference between them.4. On oral administration, both propranolol and MJ 1999 reduced resting heart rate and an exercise induced tachycardia; propranolol was only slightly more active than MJ 1999.5. In patients with thyrotoxicosis propranolol was about twice as active as MJ 1999 in reducing the heart rate.", 
    "10": "The adenyl cyclases of chick oviduct and rat prostate were not stimulated by estrogen and testosterone, respectively, suggesting that growth and differentiation of these target tissues are not mediated by adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate. Estrogen acutely activated adenyl cyclase in the castrate rat uterus, but this was prevented by administration of DL-propranolol, suggesting that the effect was mediated by catecholamines. Progesterone produced a delayed stimulation of oviduct adenyl cyclase preceding and concomitant with the induction of synthesis of avidin.", 
    "11": "1. The effects of close intra-arterial injections and infusions of glucagon on blood flow in the femoral, hepatic and superior mesenteric arteries of anaesthetized cats were studied using non-cannulating electromagnetic flow probes.2. Glucagon dilated the mesenteric vasculature. The threshold dose for rapid injections was less than 1 mug and maximal changes were produced by 10-20 mug. The dilatation began within a few seconds of injection and was unaffected by prior denervation or by pre-treatment with propranolol or atropine.3. Close intra-arterial glucagon increased the resistance of the hepatic arterial bed but had no effect on femoral vascular resistance. Intravenous glucagon failed to alter renal blood flow.4. Glucagon is therefore a potent vasoactive substance with its effect wholly or predominantly confined to the splanchnic area.5. It has been suggested that the cardiac effects of glucagon and isoprenaline resemble each other because both compounds act on the beta-adrenoceptor mechanism. The different regional vascular effects of glucagon and isoprenaline suggest that glucagon vasodilatation may not be mediated via beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "12": "The distal 2/3 of the opossum esophagus contains only smooth muscle. Manometry shows that the most distal 1-2 cm is the lower esophageal sphincter. We used a variety of agonists to seek differences between circular muscle from the sphincteric segment and more rostral levels. Isometric contractions of strips from the distal 6 cm were recorded in vitro in response to acetylcholine, carbachol, methacholine, nicotine. DMPP, norepinephrine, norepinephrine with propranolol, barium, atropine, and potassium. Significant differences in threshold concentration occurred for all drugs except barium, atropine, and potassium, the more distal strips being more sensitive. The gradient of threshold was much steeper for norepinephrine than for the other drugs. Maximal responses did not differ among levels for the choline esters or ganglionic stimulants, but showed proximal diminution for norepinephrine. These differences in threshold concentration could represent differences in distribution density of drug receptor sites, differences in affinity of receptors for the agonists, differences in rates of uptake of agonists, or differences in rates of enzymatic hydrolysis; or they may have no common basis. The sphincter is defined, at least in part, in the esophageal wall rather than in the central nervous system. The greater magnitude of the difference in sensitivity to norepinephrine than for the other agents suggests that the adrenergic innervation is important in defining the lower esophageal sphincter.", 
    "13": "1. Propranolol antagonizes the hypotensive effect of guanethidine in renal hypertensive but not in adrenal demedullated renal hypertensive rats.2. Guanethidine does not interfere with the release of catecholamines from the adrenal gland which follows splanchnic nerve stimulation in cats anaesthetized with pentobarbitone.3. Guanethidine does not release or interfere with the release of catecholamines after the intravenous injection of physostigmine in the rat.4. Propranolol antagonizes the antihypertensive effect of guanethidine by potentiating the vasopressor effects of catecholamines released from the adrenal glands during the induction stage of ether anaesthesia."
