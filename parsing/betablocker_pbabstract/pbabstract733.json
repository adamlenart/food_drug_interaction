    "0": "Intravenous injection of insulin increased heart rate approximately 20% in six alloxan-diabetic rabbits. Blood glucose concentrations after insulin did not decrease below the fasting level of non-diabetic animals and none of the rabbits had signs of hypoglycermia. Intravenous injection of saline or insulin solvent had no effect on heart rate. The stimulatory effect of insulin on heart rate was not influenced by autonomic nervous blockade by propranolol or by propranolol plus atropine.", 
    "1": "Tubuloglomerular feedback has been defined as a mechanism in which changes in distal tubular sodium chloride delivery induce changes in glomerular arteriolar resistance. Experiments were performed in rats to test the hypothesis that the alterations in vasomotor activity are controlled by local hormonal mechanisms. Early proximal flow rate (EPFR), used as an index of filtration rate, was assessed at loop perfusion rates of 10 and 40 nl/min and during zero loop flow before and during intravenous administration of agents which interfere with the reninangiotensin or adrenergic systems. During infusion of the angiotensin (A) antagonists [Sar1,Ile8-]-AII or [Me2,Gly1,Ile8]-AII at doses ranging from 4.8 to 30.6 micrograms/kg . min, feedback response, expressed as percent change of EPFR during loop flow elevation from 3 to 40 nl/min, fell from a mean of 47.6 +/- 3.3% to 33.2 +/- 2.9% (P less than 0.05). Likewise, after administration of the converting enzyme inhibitor SQ 20881 in a dose ranging between 5.5 and 34.0 mg/kg, feedback response decreased from 48.5 +/- 2.1% to 25.9 +/- 1.9% (P less than 0.001) and returned to 43.1 +/- 5.1% after the inhibitory effect of SQ 20881 on the pressure response to angiotensin I had disappeared. Luminal application of [Sar1,Thr2]-AII (5mM) or of SQ 20881 (5 or 10 mM) had no effect on the feedback response. A significant reduction in the feedback response was noted also during intravenous infusion of propranolol (46.4 +/- 3.2% vs. 29.0 +/- 2.8%, P less than 0.001), whereas 6-OH-dopamine, reserpine, or phenoxybenzamine had no detectable effect. Our results are in agreement with the concept that the renin-angiotensin system may mediate feedback-induced resistance changes. In addition, circulating catecholamines may, in some unknown manner, act as modulators of the feedback response.", 
    "2": "1 Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured by the 133xenon inhalation method in 33 newly-diagnosed hypertensive patients prior to commencing therapy. 2 Blood pressure was treated by using a varying sequence of four different drugs, namely labetalol, metoprolol, oxprenolol and sotalol, each of which is a beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent, but with differing additional properties. 3 CBF measurements were repeated when blood pressure was controlled. No significant change in CBF was found with any of the four drugs, in contrast to the fall which has been reported when drugs of this type are administered acutely.", 
    "3": "Chronic nicotine administration in larger doses inhibits steroidogenesis in testis. This inhibition is possibly secondary to increased adrenomedullary norepinephrine activity, since the anti-steroidogenic effect of nicotine can be prevented by alpha-adrenergic blocker like phentolamine. In vitro incubation of testicular slices with nicotine failed to elicit any appreciable effect on delta 5-3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity indicating lack of direct action of nicotine on testicular steroidogenesis.", 
    "4": "The elderly are at risk from stroke and cardiac complications of hypertension. There is strong circumstantial evidence to indicate that these risks may be reduced by hypotensive therapy. However, the decision to treat must be taken after careful appraisal of the patient and, because the risks of therapy are higher in this age group, the choice of drugs should be restricted.", 
    "5": "The study of the ocular adrenergic systems at the Wilmer Institute over the last 40 years began with the examination of the formation and outflow of aqueous humor by Jonas Friedenwald and his co-workers in the early 1940's. At that time, researchers were attempting to understand the mechanisms of fluid dynamics in the eye, with the idea of altering these mechanisms to alleviate glaucoma only a distant goal. In the late 1950's, Langham and others reported on the effect of superior cervical ganglionectomy on intraocular pressure, following this work with a succession of papers on the relationship between alpha and beta adrenergic substances and aqueous humor dynamics. Sears, in collaboration with B\u00e1r\u00e1ny, described the effects of alpha and beta adrenergic substances on outflow resistance. Eakins, in 1963, suggested a mechanism of action for isoproterenol in the lowering of intraocular pressure. Work on timolol at Wilmer began with a report from Radius, Diamond, Pollack and Langham covering experimental studies with rabbits and clinical studies of the drug's ocular hypotensive effects on glaucoma patients. Richter and others also studied a small number of patients on maximal therapy and found further intraocular pressure reduction with added timolol.", 
    "6": "The autonomic nervous system is divided into the parasympathetic and sympathetic systems, with three types of adrenergic receptors: alpha (smooth muscle contraction), beta1 (cardiac acceleration and fatty acid mobilization) and beta2 (smooth muscle relaxation). Substances affecting the function of the adrenergic system are the agonists or stimulators, which mimic the effects of endogenous norepinephrine or epinephrine, and antagonists or blockers, which block the receptors and prevent stimulation by the agonists. Autonomic stimulation in the eye mediates various changes which apparently affect outflow facility and rate of formation of aqueous humor. Alteration of either or both of these factors by autonomic agonists or antagonists may have a direct or an indirect effect on intraocular pressure. Beta-adrenergic blocking substances have been used to treat a variety of diseases. Some of the effects of these drugs are attributable to properties other than beta blockade, such as intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and local anaesthetic activity. Side effects of this class of drugs require caution in cases of congestive heart failure and in asthmatics. Autonomic agents used in the treatment of ocular hypertension and glaucoma include pilocarpine, a chilinergic agonist, epinephrine, an adrenergic agonist, and various beta adrenergic blockers or antagonists including propranolol, atenolol and timolol. The physico-chemical properties and pharmacokinetics of timolol are reviewed. Data showing a significant reduction in intraocular pressure as a result of ocular instillation of timolol are presented. Reduction of the rate of aqueous formation appears to be the mechanism of action. A low incidence of non-serious side effects is reported.", 
    "7": "A previous report of a lethal potentiation between sublethal doses of morphine and the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol was confirmed for Sprague-Dawley rats. An alpha-adrenergic blocker, phentolamine, also showed a lesser but significant potentiation, as did a moderate dose of atropine. No synergism was noted between morphine and methylatropine, haloperidol or methysergide. Phentolamine and a lower dose of atropine, which did not synergize with morphine, both added significantly to the lethality of the combination of morphine and propranolol, whereas methylatropine, haloperidol and methysergide had no significant effect to synergize or antagonize mortality.", 
    "8": "Glycemia, growth hormone level and urinary catecholamine excretion were studied in 182 patients suffering from insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus during insulin therapy alone, and in 33 during treatment with insulin plus alpha- and beta-adrenoblockers. Under the effect of alpha-adrenoblockers glycemia proved to fall in the insulin-dependent patients, without increasing the insulin dose. The STH level diminished in these patients under the effect of alpha-adrenoblockers, even when glycemia persisted at the same level. But beta-adrenoblockers aggravated decompensation and the STH level remained unchanged. alpha and beta-adrenoblockers decreased the urinary adrenaline excretion and elevated noradrenaline, dophamine and DOPA excretion, irrespective of blood glycemia. The authors recommend the use of alpha-adrenoblockers to prevent the necessity of a considerable elevation of insulin doses during compensation in patients with the insulin-resistant form of diabetes mellitus. beta-adrenoblockers are not recommended in diabetes mellitus.", 
    "9": "The inhibitory effects of atenolol, metoprolol and propranolol on isoprenaline-induced tachycardia, broncho-relaxation and vasodilatation were investigated in the reserpinized and anaesthetized cat. In low doses all three antagonists inhibited the heart rate response to isoprenaline, the order of potency being propranolol greater than metoprolol greater than atenolol. While propranolol inhibited the bronchodilation and vasodilation responses to isoprenaline in the same dose range as it blocked the heart rate response, atenolol and metoprolol had to be given in considerably higher doses to block these effects. The results indicate that both metoprolol and atenolol, in contrast to propranolol, are selective beta1-adrenoceptor antagonist. No statistically significant difference in the degree of selectivity was found between metoprolol and atenolol. The three compounds were devoid of intrinsic beta-mimetic activity.", 
    "10": "Antibodies raised against purified beta-adrenergic receptors themselves specifically bind beta-adrenergic ligands. Digitonin-solubilized frog (Rana pipiens) erythrocyte beta-adrenergic receptors, purified 100- to 200-fold by adsorption to an alprenolol-agarose affinity support and specifically eluted from the affinity resin by 1-100 mM (+/-)-isoproterenol, were used to immunize six rabbits. All immune sera, in contrast to preimmune sera, bound the beta-adrenergic antagonist [(3)H]Dihydroalprenolol binding activity was due to immunoglobulins. By competition studies, antibody [(3)H]dihydroalprenolol binding was found to display a specificity and stereoselectivity resembling that of the beta-adrenergic receptor, [i.e., (-)-isoproterenol > (-)-epinephrine > (-)-norepinephrine; alprenolol approximately propranolol > phentolamine = aloperidol; and (-) isomers of both agonists and antagonists 10-100 times more potent than (+) isomers]. A portion of the [(3)H]dihydroalprenolol binding antibodies could be specifically adsorbed onto purified frog erythrocyte membranes, whereas Xenopus and human erythrocyte membranes, both of which are almost devoid of beta-adrenergic receptors, were ineffective in adsorbing [(3)H]dihydroalprenolol binding antibodies. We suggest that the likely immunogen was a beta-adrenergic receptor-isoproterenol complex and that immunization with drugs noncovalently bound to their receptors might be a means of raising antibodies to biologically active otherwise nonimmunogenic small molecules. Such antibodies, whose specificity mimics that of a receptor, should also provide useful models for the study of the structure of the receptor binding sites.", 
    "11": "In a double-blind, within-patient, randomized study, 12 mild asthmatics were given single oral doses of propranolol (80 mg), metoprolol (100 mg), timolol (10 mg), or placebo. Resting heart rate and forced expiratory volume in one sec (FEV1) were measured before and 90 min after treatment. Nonspecific bronchial reactivity was measured by inhaled histamine at 90 min. Following each active drug, resting heart rate changed to a similar extent and to a greater degree than after placebo (p less than 0.01). Changes in FEV1 were small and not different from those after placebo. In contrast, after each active drug, bronchial reactivity increased more than after placebo. The degree of reactivity with each active drug was similar but the differences from corresponding placebo values were significant (p less than 0.05). We conclude that, in mild asthmatics, nonspecific bronchial reactivity is a more sensitive index of airway effects than resting FEV1. Moreover, in the context of this study, since the beta-blockers were given in doses likely to induce equivalent cardiac beta-blockade, there is no evidence to suggest that any one of them is more \"cardioselective\" than the others.", 
    "12": "The stimulus generated at the sinus node induces on the heart working cells a stronger contraction at higher frequences. The purpose of the present report is to investigate whether the two effects a) exicitation-contraction coupling and b) contraction strength are independent. Instead of the pace-maker it has been used a rectangular waves generator; the pulses are applied to isolated guinea-pig auricle or rat right ventricle. The AA. show a stronger twitch of cell when the membrane is depolarized without contraction. This phenomenon can be obtained as follows: by applying peculiar conditions of high frequency train pulses (so that they are not capable of eliciting contraction) or depolarizing the membrane with high KO concentration. The AA. believe that the stronger contraction of the muscle cell is due to the depolarization generated by the stimulus and it is not connected to the contraction. The potentiating factor is independent by cAMP and cytoplasmic Ca++. This factor is antagonized by propranolol.", 
    "13": "Combined Glucagon-Propranolol test used for study of growth hormone is advantages. The combined administration of TRH and LHRH is possible. In 53 children, the hormone responses (GH, TSH, FSH, LH and prolactin) were studied. This combined test allows the rapid assessment of anterior pituitary function.", 
    "14": "768 men aged under 65 with angina pectoris, at least 50% obstruction in two or more major vessels, and a left-ventricular ejection fraction greater than or equal to 0.5 took part in a prospective randomised trial of the effect of coronary-artery bypass on prognosis. 373 patients were alloted to medical and 395 to surgical treatment. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the distribution of variables recorded at the time of randomisation. 1. \"surgical\" patient was lost to follow-up. 26 \"surgical\" patients did not undergo surgery and 50 \"medical\" patients were operated on. All these 76 patients were retained in their original treatment groups for the analysis. At 2 years there was no significant difference in mortality between the two groups. A significant difference was, however, found in the subset of patients with three-vessel disease, survival being significantly better for surgical patients. Operative (in-hospital) mortality was 3.6% in all operated patients and 1.5% in the last third. On average, 1.9 grafts per patient were inserted in the two-vessel-disease subgroup and 2.4 grafts per patient in the three-vessel-disease subgroup. Graft-patency rate was 90% within 9 months and 77% between 9 and 18 months after surgery. Symptomatic improvement was significantly better and deterioration less in the surgical group.", 
    "15": "The mechanism underlying the alteration of phospholipid metabolism in rat pineal gland in vitro produced by propranolol and tertiary amine local anesthetics was investigated. 0.1 mM propranolol did not affect either the levels or specific activity of [32P]ATP in glands. In the presence of the drug, the incorporation of cytidine, but not of inorganic phosphate, into phosphatidyl-CMP (CDP-diacylglycerol) was dependent on the cytidine concentration. The incorporation of glycerol into phosphatidyl-CMP, phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylglycerol was enhanced by propranolol, whereas labeling of phosphatidylcholine was decreased. When both 1 mM propranolol and 1 mM inositol were present, labeling of phosphatidylinositol was further increased, stimulation of phosphatidyl-CMP and phosphatidylglycerol labeling was reduced and incorporation into phosphatidylcholine and triacylglycerol was depressed. The incorporation of [3H]inositol into pineal lipids was also enhanced by propranolol. 10 microM propranolol inhibited rat liver phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase by 50%, while local anesthetics were less potent in the decreasing order: dibucaine greater than tetracaine greater than lidocaine greater than procaine. The propranolol-induced accumulation of phosphatidyl-CMP was prevented by supplying adequate freely diffusible inositol in the medium. The phosphatidyl-CMP which accumulated was not utilized for the enhanced formation of phosphatidylinositol brought about by norepinephrine. The results indicate that propranolol and local anesthetics redirect pineal phospholipid metabolism in part by inhibition of phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase.", 
    "16": "In 95 hypertensive patients treated in general practice, metoprolol given once daily was as effective as other beta-blockers given in an equivalent daily dose two or three times daily (P less than 0.001) and was well tolerated. Follow-up a year later produced no evidence of unusual side effects but there was a reduction in the mean daily dosage without loss of efficacy. Problems associated with surveys carried out in general practice and with the retrieval of information on the effects of long term administration in an identifiable patient population are discussed.", 
    "17": "Eleven patients with hypertension and varying degrees of stable renal functional impairment were treated with the beta adrenoreceptor blocking drug, acebutolol (Sectral). Parameters of renal, cardiovascular and respiratory function were measured immediately prior to treatment and again after four and 12 weeks. In five patients the blood pressure was well controlled throughout the 12-week period on 400mg of acebutolol each morning, in three the blood pressure was satisfactory after four weeks treatment with 400mg each morning but control had been lost by 12 weeks, while in the remaining three patients 800mg each morning was ineffective. There was no significant change in the mean glomerular filtration rate of the 11 patients but in two of these patients with severe, but stable, chronic renal failure the introduction of acebutolol was associated with a decline in renal function and the onset of uraemic symptoms. One of these patients showed an improvement when the acebutolol was discontinued but the other required regular dialysis treatment. Beta adrenoreceptor blockers should be used cautiously in severe renal failure.", 
    "18": "Effects of amiloride analogues on Na transport were studied in isolated skins of the frog Rana ridibunda. The pattern of structure-activity relationship of these compounds showed that both the -NH2 group at position 5 and Cl at position 6 of the pyrazine ring of the amiloride molecule were important for their biological activity. The paramount role of the groups at position 5 was further demonstrated by the striking properties of an analogue resulting from dimethylation of that -NH2 group. A stimulation of Na transport, opposite to the effect of amiloride itself, was observed in this instance. The increase in Na transport could already be seen at 10(-6) M and was equivalent to the measured increase in Na influx, reversible, dose-dependent, and additive to the natriferic action of oxytocin. Such characteristics resemble those reported with \"external\" agents like propranolol and La3+. Furthermore, mutual inhibition was observed between the stimulatory effects of this analogue and those of propranolol or La3+. These results suggest that the analogue may be considered as another \"external\" agent acting at sites of the external membrane distinct from those activated by cAMP but similar to the Ca sites described by Herrera and Curran (Herrera, F.C., Curran, P.F. 1963. J. Gen. Physiol. 46:999).", 
    "19": "Pineal glands convert [3H]tryptophan to [3H]N-acetylserotonin and [3H]melatonin in organ culture. Taurine treatment increases the rate of production of these compounds 40- and 25-fold respectively by stimulating the activity of N-acetyltransferase. This stimulation is blocked stereospecifically by L-propranolol, indicating that taurine is probably acting via beta-adrenergic receptors. Taurine is active in stimulating N-acetyltransferase activity in denervated glands, suggesting that it might interact directly with the beta-adrenergic receptor, and not by causing the release of norepinephrine from nerve terminals.", 
    "20": "Besides the characteristic disturbances of the motor nervous system symptoms indicating an overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system can complicate the course of severe cases of tetanus. These symptoms include fluctuating tachycardia and hypertension, electrocardiographic changes, sweating, constipation with development of paralytic ileus and metabolic disorders. These symptoms are comparable to these developing in patients with phaeochromocytoma. Elevated catecholamine levels in plasma and urine have been found in several patients with tetanus who developed these symptoms. The prolonged over-activity of the sympathetic nervous system is thought to contribute to the still considerably high mortality rate. Myocardial lesions observed at necropsy are comparable to those found in patients dying of phaeochromocytoma. These lesions are suggested to be associated with sudden death from arrhythmias or cardiac failure in patients with tetanus. For the protection of the organism against the overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system a treatment using the combination of beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents and adrenergic neuron blocking agents has been introduced. A reduction of the mortality rate was achievable by this treatment. Experimental evidence is accumulating that the tetanus toxin affects not only the motor, but also the sympathetic and sensory neurons.", 
    "21": "Chronic treatment with beta-blockers was interrupted abruptly in six patients with arterial hypertension. Three patients, who had experienced symptoms during a previous withdrawal, again complained of transient palpitations, tremor, sweating, headache and general malaise. A significant increase in standing blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) was noted after 24 h. The standing HR reached a maximum after 48 h and had decreased significantly on the 7th day (p less than 0.005). There was a strong tendency to greater increase in standing BP and HR in the patients who experienced symptoms than in those who did not. Plasma concentrations of noradrenaline, adrenaline and prolactin did not change significantly. Thus, beta-blocker withdrawal symptoms are reproducible and are indicative of a transient sympathetic hyperresponse. The increased activity is not likely to be caused by increased production of circulating catecholamines, but rather by increased sensitivity of the beta-receptor.", 
    "22": "The influence of the bath temperature on the responsiveness to sympathomimetic amines was studied with isolated guinea pig and rat atria. In electrically driven guinea pig left atria, the dose-response curve for the positive inotropic effect of isoproterenol (ISO) was shifted to the left by lowering the temperature from 36 to 24 degrees C. The positive inotropic effect of phenylephrine (PHE) in lower concentrations was attenuated by lowering the temperature. Phentolamine markedly inhibited the PHE response at 36 and 32 degrees C, whereas it produced no inhibition at 24 degrees C. Similar changes were observed with rat left atria. In guinea pig left atria, propranolol inhibited the response to PHE more effectively at 24 degrees C than 32 degrees C. With guinea pig and rat atria the dose--response curve for the positive inotropic effect of PHE in the presence of phentolamine was shifted to the left by lowering the temperature. The results suggest that lowering the temperature of the bath solution diminished the positive inotropic effect of PHE mediated by alpha-adrenoceptors and potentiated that mediated by beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "23": "The effects of prostacyclin (PGI2) on the contractile frequency and on the isometric developed tension of spontaneously beating or paced isolated rat atria were explored. PGI2 enhanced frequency and contractile tension, both effects being blocked by the presence of propranolol, or following a pretreatment with 6-OHDopamine.", 
    "24": "Severe supraventricular and ventricular tachyarrhythmias occurred after surgery in 9 patients. Oxprenolol or pindolol were used as primary drugs in 8 cases. The effect of therapy was documented quantitatively by an arrhythmia computer with trendscription and alarm recording. Beta-receptor blockade was successful in 6 cases. On supraventricular tachycardia with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome was abolished by quinidine. Severe ventricular instability with fibrillation following myocardial infarction was temporarily suppressed by lidocaine. One fatal outcome was caused by severe illness. Although all patients were suffering from coronary artery and/or hypertensive heart disease with diminished cardiac reserve, no serious side effects were directly related to beta-receptor blockade. Therefore beta-receptor blocking drugs are recommended as drugs of first choice in the treatment of postoperative arrhythmias induced by sympathetic overstimulation. Dysrhythmias based on cellular pathology should be treated with conventional antiarrhythmic drugs alone or combined with beta-blockers.", 
    "25": "We compared the immediate effects of five beta-adrenoreceptor-blocking agents in 16 patients with stable angina pectoris. Acute dose-response studies showed that all five drugs improved exercise tolerance and reduced ST-segment depression, heart rate and blood pressure by a similar degree in comparison with a placebo (P less than 0.01). Near maximum improvement in exercise tolerance occurred when the acute cumulative oral dose had reached 160 mg for propranolol and oxprenolol, 200 mg for metoprolol and tolamolol and 400 mg for practolol. When these drugs were administered as a single doses, increase in walking time before the development of angina and reduction in ST-segment depression, heart rate and systolic blood pressure all occurred within one hour and persisted for eight hours--effects markedly different from the response to a placebo (P less than 0.01). These data show that non-cardioselective agents (propranolol and oxprenolol), cardioselective agents (practolol, metoprolol and tolamolol), as well as drugs with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (oxprenolol and practolol), were equally effective in the treatment of angina pectoris.", 
    "26": "In a single-dose, double-blind study, the minimum effective doses of bupranolol and methazolamide were established. The beta-blocker bupranolol (Ophtorenin, Dr. Winzer, Konstanz) in an oily solution reduced IOP significantly in a concentration of 0.05%. The carboanhydrase inhibitor Methazolamide (Neptazane) did not change IOP in a peroral dose of 50 mg, while 100 mg p.o. gave a significant IOP decrease. Both drugs exhibited an additive effect in this low regimen. It is concluded that the combined application of both drugs will postpone or avoid side effects and prolong the time and the field of clinical usefulness. It appears possible that both have a different mechanism of action.", 
    "27": "Idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis (IHSS) occurs more commonly in the elderly than is generally believed, and is often unsuspected. In 26 patients above the age of 60, the diagnosis was recognized in only 7 (27 percent) prior to echocardiography. Symptoms included dyspnea in 17, chest pain in 16, and dizziness or syncope in 8 patients. In 10 patients, establishing the correct diagnosis led to therapy with propranolol, with or without discontinuation of digitalis; in 7 of these, the chest pain was significantly reduced. An accurate diagnosis is particularly important because drugs that are useful in other forms of heart disease may have adverse effects in IHSS. Echocardiography is the diagnostic procedure of choice and is indicated in the presence of an unexplained systolic murmur, especially when it is associated with chest pain, syncope or left ventricular hypertrophy.", 
    "28": "A high-performance liquid chromatographic procedure using a fluorescence detector for the analysis of atenolol in plasma and whole blood is described. It employs a simple and rapid method of preparation. Atenolol and metoprolol as the internal standard are chromatographed as ion pairs with heptanesulfonic acid. The method is sensitive and reproducible with accurate detection at concentrations as low as 2 ng/ml in whole blood and plasma, and a coefficient of variation of 4.7% over the range 2 ng/ml to 1000 ng/ml.", 
    "29": "A case of progressive pleural thickening developing during treatment with oxprenolol is described and the possible association between the two is discussed.", 
    "30": "Total exchangeable body potassium (KE) was determined in fifteen patients with essential hypertension, and total exchangeable body sodium (NaE) in ten, before and after propranolol administration for 2-3 months. Blood pressure was reduced; serum potassium increased, but KE was unchanged. Serum sodium and NaE were unaffected during therapy. It is concluded that the increase in serum potassium during propranolol treatment could not be attributed to potassium retention, but is possibly due to a displacement from the intra- to the extracellular fluid compartment. The antihypertensive effect of propranolol could not be related to changes in NaE.", 
    "31": "The action of beta-adrenergic blockers on neuromuscular function has been reexamined using a recent beta-blocker pindolol (Visken), along with propranolol and procaine, on three isolated skeletal muscle preparations from the same species, frog: hyoglossus muscle stimulated through hypoglossal nerve, rectus abdominis and hyoglossus muscles using acetylcholine as an agonist. The depressant action of pindolol and propranolol was found to be non-competitive. The three test-drugs potentiated the depressant actions of d-tubocurarine and succinylcholine. The results point to a local anaesthetic mode of action of beta-blockers. Pindolol which is 10-40 times more potent than propranolol as a beta-blocker but now shown to be only one-fourth as potent in its neuro-muscular depressant action, may have lesser neuro-muscular side effects than propranolol in patients receiving high doses of propranolol for antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "32": "Propranolol infusions in open-chested, anesthetised dogs increased endocardial levels of ATP and phosphocreatine. It reduced ADP, AMP, glucose-6-phosphate and lactate in this region. Endocardial glycogen was transiently increased. Metabolic perturbations in the endocardium produced by cardiotoxic doses of isoprenaline were prevented or reduced by propranolol pretreatment. Thus, propranolol appears to have a more selective action on endocardial versus midmyocardial or epicardial metabolism.", 
    "33": "A study of controlled hypotension was undertaken in 50 major surgical patients using labetalol, a drug with both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity. The patients were such that difficulty in achieving controlled hypotension could be anticipated: the young, the anxious and those for whom halothane was contraindicated. The administration of labetalol quickly induced hypotension which was controlled easily and was rapidly antagonized.", 
    "34": "The ionophore X-537A increased heart rate and contractility of the isolated, working rat heart preparation. The increased heart rate appeared to be caused solely by release of catecholamines as the response was completely eliminated by reserpine pretreatment or addition of propranolol to the perfusate. The inotropic response, however, had an apparent catecholamine-independent component as neither propranolol, nor propranol in combination with phentolamine, completely eliminated the inotropic response to X-537A. On the other hand, reserpine pretreatment did abolish the inotropic effect of the ionophore but this action appeared to be a nonspecific one as the responses to norepinephrine and to CaCl2 were substantially diminished.", 
    "35": "Eleven patients with previously untreated glaucoma of one eye were given metoprolol, 50 mg x 3 for one day. Intraocular pressure (IOP) and heart rate were significantly reduced during treatment, and increased after withdrawal of the drug. In the eyes with glaucoma, the mean IOP was reduced from 30.1 to 20.6 mmHg during treatment. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were also reduced during treatment, but stayed at the same level after withdrawal of the drug. It is concluded that at least part of the reductions observed for IOP and heart rate are drug-induced, while the effect on blood preassure is mainly induced by factors other than the drug. The effect on IOP is considered large enough to be of clinical interest."
