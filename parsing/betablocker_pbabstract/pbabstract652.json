Myocardial glycogen content was decreased and this was accompanied by activation of the enzymes of glycogenolysis and inhibition of the enzymes of glycogen synthesis. Beta blockade (nadolol) abolished the effect of phosphorus depletion (PD) on myocardial glycogen metabolism, documenting that the effect of PD is mediated, at least in part, by increased sympathetic activity. Furthermore, administration of insulin caused a marked increase of glycogen content in the heart of both control and phosphorus-depleted (PD) animals. There was no change of glycogen content or the activities of enzymes of glycogen metabolism in skeletal muscle or kidney, but a decrease of glycogen content of the liver was observed in PD animals.", 
    "1": "1. Phenylephrine has a positive chronotropic effect on the right isolated guinea-pig atria and this effect is not modified by alpha-adrenergic blocker (phentolamine) but it is drastically inhibited by beta-adrenergic antagonists (practolol or propranolol). 2. The effect is substantially reduced by treatment with cocaine or pretreatment with reserpine. 3. Cocaine plus reserpine shift the dose-response curve for phenylephrine to the left. 4. It is concluded that positive chronotropic effect of phenylephrine has two components: direct action on beta-adrenergic receptors and an indirect action due to norepinephrine release.", 
    "2": "Pharmacokinetic studies of the concentration of the beta 1-blocker metoprolol have been performed in maternal plasma, amniotic fluid, breast milk and the plasma of the newborn. The concentration of metoprolol in maternal plasma exceeds that in the amniotic fluid initially but not later on. The quotient between the metoprolol concentration in the venous maternal blood and the mixed cord blood at the time of delivery is at about 1. In the maternal plasma the metoprolol concentration will decline in a rapid way after the latest dose probably because of an increased clearance. Blood levels of metoprolol during the first postnatal hours will increase almost fourfold and are generally followed by a decrease over the next 15 hours. Active metabolites of metoprolol (alfa-OH-metoprolol and O-demethyl-metoprolol) are found in the urine of the newborn. The breast milk concentration of metoprolol is 3 times higher than in the maternal milk but the sucking newborn will only show very low or unmeasurable plasma levels between consecutive breast feeding periods in the majority of cases.", 
    "3": "Over a period of 4 years, a team of obstetricians and nephrologists have used beta-blockers in the treatment of hypertension in high risk pregnancies. One hundred and twenty one patients (125 pregnancies) were treated with this new therapeutic approach: Acebutolol (56 cases), Pindolol (38 cases) and Atenolol (31 cases) were used. In our group of patients, 56% (70/121) had a previous record of hypertension. Treatment was started when diastolic pressure reached 90 mmHg. The mothers showed excellent tolerance and in 95% of cases blood pressure was controlled in a satisfactory manner. Three groups of new-born infants were defined. In 20 infants, the weight was less than 2.5, in 15 infants between 2.5 and 2.8 kg, and in 90 infants more than 2.8 kg. There was no evidence of low Apgar scores, bradycardia or hypotension in the infants. The importance of team management of the patient is emphasised.", 
    "4": "56 patients who were taking a long-term beta-blocker, and in whom myocardial ischaemia occurred, were randomised to stop or to continue the drug. Assessed in terms of deaths, heart failure, cardiogenic shock, further myocardial ischaemia and arrhythmias (except atrial fibrillation), the outcome did not differ significantly in the two groups. We found no evidence in this small series that either maintaining or stopping beta-blockers after an episode of myocardial ischaemia significantly alters the short-term prognosis of chronically beta-blocked patients.", 
    "5": "Twenty-nine patients were randomly allocated to two groups before undergoing aorto-coronary bypass surgery. In one group the beta-blocking medication was withdrawn three days preoperatively, and in the other group it was maintained. The patients in the latter group were additionally given 100 mg metoprolol per os two hours before surgery. The degree of myocardial injury, as judged from cumulated activity of S-CK B, was less when the beta-blockade was maintained.", 
    "6": "Drugs induced respiratory disorders include bronchospasm, extrinsic alveolitis, and diffuse interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. Bronchospasm may be due to the action of pharmacodynamic agents on autonomic control of bronchial tone (beta-blockers, beta-agonists...) or to a hypersensitivity reaction (penicillins, sulfonamides, anti-inflammatory compounds...). Extrinsic alveolitis usually follows administration of anti-infective medication but other drugs may be implicated. Prolonged use of a wide variety of drugs, particularly cytotoxic agents, is necessary to provoke the onset of a diffuse interstitial pulmonary fibrosis.", 
    "7": "The aim of the study was to assess the effect of Prenalterol on cardiovascular beta adrenergic system of 12 coronary artery disease patients with a previous myocardial infarction. For this purpose, left ventricular function was assessed before and after intravenous administration of 30 gamma/Kg of Prenalterol, under a constant heart rate, provided by atrial pacing. Prenalterol induced a significant improvement of left ventricular contractility (dp/dt pos.-VCEmax-Vmax d), relaxation (dp/dt neg.-T constant), ventricular compliance (total diastolic compliance-modulus of chamber stiffness-end-diastolic compliance) and pump (ejection fraction) indices. These results suggest the potential usefulness of Prenalterol in severe acute cardiac failure.", 
    "8": "[3H]CGP-12177, in contrast to lipophilic ligands like [3H]Dihydroalprenolol, shows very little non-specific binding to intact cells. It also differs from lipophilic ligands in that it can be completely displaced from the receptors on intact cells by isoproterenol. Furthermore, binding sites for this ligand disappear rapidly upon exposure of cells to agonists. These binding sites reappear rapidly upon removal of the agonist, if any possible interaction with residual traces of the agonist are prevented. These results indicate that [3H]CGP-12177 binds only to cell surface receptors and that agonist causes a rapid and reversible shift of receptors from the cell surface to the interior of the cell.", 
    "9": "Agonist interaction with beta 1 and beta 2 adrenoceptors in rat and rabbit lung has been examined using ligand binding techniques and the results are discussed in relation to current models of beta-adrenoceptor-adenylate cyclase coupling. Agonist binding has been assessed by examining the ability of isoprenaline or salbutamol to displace the labelled antagonist 3H-dihydroalprenolol (3H-DHA) from specific receptor sites. Beta 1 and beta 2 adrenoceptors, even within the same tissue, exhibited different ion and temperature requirements for guanine nucleotide modulation of agonist binding. Thus, in contrast to the situation at beta 2 sites, agonist binding to beta 1 adrenoceptors was only sensitive to GTP if incubations were performed at physiological temperatures in the presence of Mg++ ions. These findings suggest that there may be different receptor-effector coupling relationships between the two beta-adrenoceptor subtypes.", 
    "10": "(+) Propranolol is considered to prevent adrenaline-induced pulmonary edema (A.P.E.) due to the beta-adrenoceptor blockade. However, local anaesthetics also are known to prevent pulmonary edema. To assess the role of beta-adrenergic blockade in A.P.E., the effect of a beta 1-blocker possessing local anaesthetic action (+/- Metaprolol) and a beta 1-blocker possessing no local anaesthetic action (+/- practolol) was studied along with propranolol derivatives. The study revealed that (+), (-), (+/-) propranolol and (+/-) metaprolol completely prevented A.P.E. whereas (+/-) practolol did not. This shows that local anaesthetic action but not the-beta adrenergic blockade may be responsible for prevention of A.P.E.", 
    "11": "In conscious rabbits, the intravenous administration of pindolol (1.25 mg/kg), propranolol (1 mg/kg) and alprenolol (2 mg/kg) induced a highly significant decrease of mean arterial blood pressure and significant bradycardia. In the same model, the intravenous administration of saline, indomethacin, and clidanac did not affect the mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate. Pretreatment with indomethacin and clidanac reduced the effect of these beta-blockers on the mean arterial blood pressure and had no effect on the heart rate. Treating of the guinea pig heart homogenate with 1 microM indomethacin or clidanac decreased the number of beta-adrenoceptors without changing their affinity. These results suggest that indomethacin and clidanac interfere with beta-adrenoceptor-mediated effects.", 
    "12": "In a double blind trial the authors studied the effect of beta-adrenoblocking agent Trimepranol (Spofa, Czechoslovakia), in 35 patients with ischaemic heart disease (IHD) associated with angina pectoris, and in another 42 patients they compared the effect of Trimepranol and Obsidan (GDR). The daily doses of Trimepranol and Obsidan averaged 80-100 mg and 160-200 mg respectively. In two thirds of the patients the diagnosis of IHD was confirmed by coronary arteriography. In 46 patients the authors examined the tolerance of physical exercise before and after 3 to 4 weeks of Trimepranol and Obsidan therapy. Trimepranol was effective in 81% and Obsidan in 83% of patients with angina pectoris of effort. The two drugs were distinctly less effective in patients with both effort and resting angina pectoris (54 and 64% respectively). Trimepranol treatment was associated with a higher incidence of side-effects such as bradycardia, arterial pressure decrease and bronchial spasm than Obsidan treatment.", 
    "13": "1. This study attempts to elucidate unique heart and blood pressure responses seen in sloths in response to tilting by blocking autonomics with atropine, propranolol, or a combination of these. 2. Atropine produces less heart rate increase in sloths than in other mammals but blocks reflex bradycardia as expected. 3. Propranolol reduces heart rate to about the same degree as in man and completely blocks all cardiac responses to tilting, both direct and reflex. 4. Atropine slightly diminishes blood pressure responses to tilting whereas propranolol tends to augment the already marked increases.", 
    "14": "1. The intrinsic effects of adrenaline on the myocardium of the eel in winter were investigated in the isolated perfused eel heart. 2. Adrenaline was ineffective both on the pacemaker activity and auricular action potentials but markedly increased ventricular action potential duration, thus leading to an auriculo-ventricular desynchronisation. 3. This effect was not reversed by propranolol but was by phentolamine and was attributed to the stimulation of alpha receptors. 4. Clonidine reproduced the effect of adrenaline but also decreased the cardiac rhythm, possibly via alpha 2 adrenoceptors. 5. No direct inotropic effect was observed.", 
    "15": "1. The (Na+/K+)-ATPase activity of brown fat membranes is increased by norepinephrine, the physiological mediator of thermogenesis in this tissue. 2. This increased ATPase activity was inhibited approximately 50% by either propranolol (a beta-adrenergic blocker) or phentolamine (an alpha-blocker). 3. The alpha-agonist, phenylephrine and the beta-agonist, isoproterenol, also stimulated the ATPase activity. 4. That these latter effects were receptor-specific is supported by the finding that: (a) l(-)isoproterenol stimulation was inhibited by propranolol but not by phentolamine; (b) d(+)isoproterenol had no stimulatory effect on the ATPase activity; and (c) the l(-)phenylephrine-induced increase was inhibited by phentolamine but not by propranolol. 5. (-)norepinephrine, l(-)isoproterenol and l(-)phenylephrine all decreased the apparent Km for K+ of the (Na+/K+)-ATPase but did not alter the apparent Km for ATP or the Vmax of the reaction.", 
    "16": "The effect of 1-O-hexadecyl-2-O-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (HAGPC), a major component of antihypertensive polar renomedullary lipid, on the pressor responses to norepinephrine and angiotensin II was investigated in normal Wistar rats. The pressor activity of norepinephrine (1 microgram/kg of body weight (BW)) and angiotensin II (40 ng/kg BW) were markedly suppressed when these substances were injected immediately after intravenous administration of 80 nmol/kg BW of HAGPC. When HAGPC was infused continuously at a rate of 20 nmol/kg BW/min, pressor responses to bolus injection of graded doses (0.5 to 10 micrograms/kg BW) of norepinephrine were significantly lowered, but pressor responses to 10 to 200 ng/kg BW of angiotensin II were not affected. These observations suggest that HAGPC has alpha-adrenergic blocking activity and does not influence angiotensin II receptors.", 
    "17": "Labetalol and YM-09538 are combined alpha and beta receptor antagonists with demonstrated antihypertensive activity. Both compounds inhibited the uptake of (3H)norepinephrine into nerves in the rat vas deferens. However, labetalol was approximately 5 fold more potent than YM-09538 as an inhibitor of neuronal uptake. Inhibition of neuronal uptake occurred at concentrations 43 and 3800 times higher than necessary for inhibition of alpha receptors by labetalol and YM-09538, respectively. Thus YM-09538 shows a greater separation between neuronal uptake blocking properties and alpha receptor blocking properties than labetalol. This separation of activities may contribute to greater antihypertensive efficacy of YM-09538 relative to labetalol.", 
    "18": "Studies were performed on the isolated bovine tracheal muscle preparation to assess the possible role of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic AMP) in adrenergically-induced smooth muscle relaxation. Isoproterenol, epinephrine, terbutaline and soterenol were found to relax the tracheal muscle and to increase its cyclic AMP content. The two events generally paralleled one another when analyzed in terms of dose-response and time-response relationships. Propranolol antagonized the relaxation and the increase in cyclic AMP produced by isoproterenol. However, other findings suggested that there may not be a cause and effect relationship between the biochemical and mechanical responses. Thus, salbutamol and carbuterol failed to increase muscle cyclic AMP even in concentrations which produced maximum relaxation. Additionally, butoxamine and H35/25 antagonized the biochemical response but had additive effects (instead of antagonistic effects) on the mechanical response to isoproterenol. Furthermore, it was observed that low concentrations of H35/25 produced tracheal muscle relaxation associated with an increase in tissue cyclic AMP; however, use of a high concentration of H35/25 paradoxically resulted in autoblockade of the increase in cyclic AMP but not the smooth muscle relaxation.", 
    "19": "We have observed two patients with long QT interval, ventricular tachycardias of \"torsade de pointe\" type and repeated ventricular fibrillation episodes, who also turned out to have significant hypothyroidism. This was suspected from the clinical picture in one patient and after haematological test in the other. In addition to hypothyroidism, both patients had associated factors which may have contributed to the development of the arrhythmia. After having reached an euthyroid state, both patients normalized their QT intervals, were relieved from earlier symptoms of cardiac arrhythmias and exhibited no longer any documented arrhythmia. Before thyroid substitution, both patients had marked signs of delayed ventricular repolarization even by invasive electrophysiological methods. Our observations indicate that hypothyroidism should be considered a possible primary cause in cases with long QT syndrome (LQTS). Furthermore, the possibility of LQTS in patients with hypothyroidism should be considered.", 
    "20": "Altogether 1462 middle-aged women aged 38-60 participated in a population study which was carried out in G\u00f6teborg, Sweden in 1968-69. Of these women, 1302 were re-investigated six years later in a follow-up study. Studied cross-sectionally, headache and nycturia were found to be more common in both untreated and treated hypertensives than in a non-hypertensive reference group. The prevalences of headache seemed to be U-shaped when related to the BP levels, with the highest prevalences in the lowest and highest quintiles of BP levels. In the longitudinal study, headache did not occur more often in those women who had started antihypertensive treatment than in the others. Dizziness as a new symptom occurred more often in women who had started to take antihypertensive drugs than in those who had not, and was more common in those who had started taking diuretics than in those starting on beta-blockers. The prevalences of eyeground phenomena and ECG changes seemed to increase linearly with increasing BP levels. It is concluded that some symptoms and signs are related to BP levels, and some of the symptoms in hypertensive women may also be related to antihypertensive treatment as such and to the type of antihypertensive treatment given.", 
    "21": "The effects of tobacco smoking and beta-blockade on psychophysiological measures, i.e., heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), skin conductance (SC), and sensitivity to electrical pain stimulation was studied in a group of 33 male moderate smokers. Using a method of limits threshold determination technique, measures of pain threshold (PT), and tolerance level (TL) were obtained. The results were analyzed in relation to smoking habits, personality measures, and subjective effects. There was no significant effect of smoking on pain sensitivity. Smoking caused a physiological activation as indicated by an increase in HR and systolic BP. beta-Blockade counteracted the smoking-induced increase in HR and systolic BP, but did not influence PT or TL. Subjective effects of smoking were not affected by beta-blockade. The findings suggest that physiological activation is not related to effects of smoking on pain.", 
    "22": "We assessed the electrophysiological properties of prenalterol, a new beta-selective agonist, in 10 patients with normal and 10 patients with delayed atrioventricular (A-V) conduction times. We evaluated sinus node function, A-V conduction times, refractory periods, atrial or ventricular arrhythmias, spontaneous or induced by the single extrastimulus technique during basal conditions, 5 minutes after a first dose of 20 micrograms/kg of prenalterol, and 5, 15 and 30 minutes after a second injection of the same dose. Prenalterol increased heart rate about 20%, with statistically significant shortening of right atrial refractory periods, A-V nodal functional and effective refractory periods and A-H interval in both groups after the first dose. In the 6 patients with sick sinus syndrome, prenalterol increased heart rate significantly and decreased maximum sinus node recovery time which reached a statistically significant value (P less than 0.05) 5 and 30 minutes after the second dose. At the highest dose, prenalterol seemed to increase the number of ventricular and/or atrial arrhythmias only in those patients with the arrhythmias before treatment. Prenalterol increases heart rate and decreases A-V node conduction times. The shortening of maximum sinus node recovery time in patients with the sick sinus syndrome, especially if confirmed after oral administration, could indicate a specific use of this drug in patients with sinus bradycardia or atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response.", 
    "23": "In 8 asthmatic patients a comparative study was performed of the ventilatory and haemodynamic effects of the beta 1-receptor stimulator prenalterol and the beta 2-receptor stimulator terbutaline infused in increasing doses after a placebo. Terbutaline caused a dose-dependent decrease in diastolic blood-pressure (BP) and an increase in systolic BP and heart-rate (HR), while mean arterial pressure (MAP) did not change. Prenalterol produced a dose-dependent increase in MAP and systolic BP, while diastolic BP was unaffected. HR was increased only by the largest dose of prenalterol. The haemodynamic effects of the terbutaline infusion can be explained by a reflex response to the vasodilatation induced by stimulation of the vascular beta 2-receptors, while the effects of prenalterol can mainly be accounted for by a direct action on beta 1-receptors in the heart. These observations show that the cardiac side-effects of beta 2-agonists cannot be avoided by producing more selective agonists. Terbutaline caused a dose-dependent increase in the ventilatory indices. Prenalterol in larger doses caused a limited but significant increase in the ventilatory indices, comparable to the decrease in ventilation caused by the beta 1-selective blocker metoprolol. These findings suggest that the ventilatory effects of metoprolol and prenalterol are mediated via beta 1-receptors in the airways, which apparently play a functional role in asthma.", 
    "24": "1. Cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP levels were determined in bovine splenic nerve segments in the absence and presence of (+/-)-isoprenaline, (-)-phenylephrine, clonidine and ICI 63 197 (a phosphodiesterase inhibitor). The chosen concentrations of adrenoceptor agonists were those which are known to affect stimulation-induced overflow of noradrenaline from nerve terminals. 2. The mean levels of cyclic AMP ranged from 229 to 555 pmol/g of microwave irradiated tissue. Mean cyclic GMP levels ranged from 27.9 to 42.2 pmol/g. 3. Isoprenaline enhanced cyclic AMP levels but did not affect cyclic GMP levels. The effect was blocked with (+/-)-propranolol. ICI 63 197 increased cyclic AMP levels but did not change cyclic GMP. Phenylephrine and clonidine caused no consistent changes in cyclic AMP or cyclic GMP levels or in the concentration ratio between these two nucleotides. 4. The results support the involvement of cyclic AMP in the enhancing effect of beta-adrenoceptor agonists and phosphodiesterase inhibitors on stimulation-induced release of noradrenaline from sympathetic nerves.", 
    "25": "The compound known as 5-(3-tert-butylamino-2-hydroxy-propoxy)-3,4-dihydro-2 (1H)-quinolinone hydrochloride (carteolol hydrochloride, Endak, Endak mite) has been tested in extensive experimental pharmacological investigations both in vivo in various animal species and in appropriate in vitro systems. From the results it is clear that carteolol is a beta-adrenolytic agent with the following characteristics: 1. Carteolol exerts potent and long lasting blockade of adrenergic receptors, by oral or intravenous administration alike. 2. The effect comprises beta 1- and beta 2-receptors to an equal extent, and for this reason the drug produces haemodynamic changes and metabolic shifts in addition to cardiac effects. Carteolol can therefore be classified as a nonspecific beta-adrenergic blocker. 3. The drug displays a striking feeble local anaesthetic or nonspecific membrane-stabilizing action, probably owing to its pronounced hydrophilia. 4. There is evidence that carteolol has a relatively strong intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA). This has been shown by appropriately planned investigations, and is also apparent after exceeding the doses or concentrations required for adrenolysis. 5. Carteolol causes dose-dependent changes in the electrophysiological parameters of cardiac function. In low doses or concentrations it slows heart rate and in higher doses it sometimes accelerates it. 6. Carteolol is converted - with species-specific differences - almost exclusively and to a relatively small extent into 8-hydroxycarteolol. This metabolite closely resembles the original substance and exceeds it only in ISA.", 
    "26": "The role played by postsynaptic alpha-adrenergic receptors in the stimulation of pineal N-acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.5) and [3H]melatonin production was investigated in the rat. In vivo studies indicated that phenylephrine, an alpha-adrenergic agonist, potentiated and prolonged the effects of isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic agonist. Similar observations were made in organ culture with glands devoid of functional nerve endings. In addition, a combination of 1 microM prazosin, an alpha 1-adrenergic blocking agent, and 1 microM propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent, was many times more potent then either agent alone in blocking the stimulatory effects of norepinephrine on N-acetyltransferase activity and [3H]melatonin production. These findings establish that norepinephrine acting through alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors stimulates rat pineal N-acetyltransferase activity and, as a result, the production of melatonin. Apparently, beta-adrenergic activation is an absolute requirement, and an alpha-adrenergic receptor mechanism potentiates beta-adrenergic activation. These findings are significant because they demonstrate alpha-adrenergic potentiation of beta-adrenergic effects. In addition, they indicate that the widely held belief that melatonin production is regulated exclusively by a postsynaptic beta-adrenergic mechanism must be revised.", 
    "27": "Nifedipine has been assessed as a possible alternative to other third line drugs in the management of patients with difficult to control hypertension. A group of 20 patients whose blood pressure was unsatisfactory on a 3 drug regimen had their third drug stopped and after a 2 week period nifedipine was added to their beta-blocker plus diuretic therapy. Eleven became normotensive on 30 mg nifedipine daily and a further 6 on 60 mg daily; giving on overall success rate of 85%. This result was achieved with a reduction in side effects and an absence of any haemodynamic or metabolic complications.", 
    "28": "To determine the beta-adrenoceptor subtype controlling renin release from the kidneys, several beta-adrenoceptor subtype selective agonists and antagonists were administered to 15 healthy volunteers. While isoprenaline infusion (1, 2 and 4 micrograms/min for 5 min each) markedly increased plasma renin activity (PRA), the beta 2-selective agonist fenoterol failed to change PRA. The isoprenaline induced rise in PRA could be completely prevented by the beta 1-selective antagonists metoprolol (10 mg i.v. 45 min prior to isoprenaline infusion) and betaxolol (5 mg i.v. 45 min prior to infusion) indicating that renin release is mediated by beta 1-adrenoceptors. Binding studies with the highly specific beta-adrenoceptor radioligand (+/-)-125iodocyanopindolol demonstrated that membranes from human kidney cortical slices contain predominantly, if not exclusively, beta 1-adrenoceptors. These in vivo and in vitro results support the view that the beta-adrenoceptor mediating renin release from the human kidney is of the beta 1-subtype.", 
    "29": "Lysozyme is a bacteriolytic enzyme found in respiratory tract fluid. In this study, immunocytochemistry was used to determine the cells of origin of tracheal lysozyme in the ferret. Lysozyme was found in secretory granules of serous but not mucous cells in the submucosal glands, and was absent from the surface epithelium, cartilage, and connective tissue. The exclusive presence of lysozyme in serous gland cells renders it useful as a biochemical marker of that cell type. Measurements of lysozyme assayed from the incubating medium indicated that bethanechol stimulated lysozyme release by 260 +/- 80.9% (mean +/- SE), phenylephrine by 80 +/- 16.4%, and terbutaline by 25 +/- 10.2%. Electron-microscopic and immunocytochemical analysis of incubated tissues revealed loss of serous granules and lysozyme immunoreactivity in response to the drugs. Atropine, propranolol, and phentolamine blocked the stimulatory effects of bethanechol, terbutaline, and phenylephrine, respectively. These findings establish the usefulness of lysozyme as a serous-cell marker and demonstrate that secretory responses of different magnitude are evoked by equimolar concentrations of alpha- and beta-adrenergic and cholinergic drugs.", 
    "30": "The effects of adrenaline, noradrenaline, isoproterenol, dopamine, histamine, acetylcholine, and serotonin on the wall tension in the isolated frog subclavian vein and modification of these effects by appropriate antagonists were examined. The existence of alpha- and beta-adreno-, M-choline- and H1-histamine receptors was demonstrated. Stimulation of alpha-adreno- and H1-histamine receptors augments and that of beta-adreno- and M-cholinoreceptors diminishes active wall tension in the vein.", 
    "31": "Cutaneous side effects due to beta-adrenoreceptor-blocking agents are clinically polymorphous. Apparently they appear after several months of continuous therapy. Atypical psoriasiform, lichen planus-like, and eczematous \"chronic\" rashes are mainly observed. The histological picture usually corresponds to a lichenoid drug reaction. More rarely the so-called pseudo-lupus erythematodes-syndrome is found, which cannot be differentiated from the \"idiopathic\" disease. Noteworthy extracutaneous manifestations are fibrosing processes, which may be irreversible. Pathogenetically, a delayed hypersensitivity reaction, and an action on the epidermal chalone system (epinephrine-adenylcyclase-c-AMP-complex) may be assumed. Consequently, continuous observation of the skin and mucous membranes is necessary, and medication should be withdrawn if cutaneous side-effects appear.", 
    "32": "beta-Adrenergic antagonists containing from one to four identical pharmacophores were prepared and studied. These compounds had the general structure R2NCH(CH3)CH2[-OCH2CH(CH3)-]2-8NR2, where R is either H or an aryl-OCH2CHOHCH2 group. Synthesis was achieved by reaction of aryl glycidyl ethers with Jeffamines, which are primary diamines used in the manufacture of plastics. The following aryl groups were used: 2-allyphenyl, 4-(2-methoxyethyl)phenyl, 1-naphthyl, and 4-methoxyphenyl. The first three correspond to moieties of the established drugs alprenolol, metoprolol, and propranolol, respectively. The affinities of these compounds for beta-adrenergic receptors of rat heart and lung were estimated by measuring their ability to compete with the specific binding of (-)-[3H]-dihydroalprenolol. Compounds containing one pharmacophore bound to the receptors with affinities comparable to those of the parent drugs and the blockade of receptors could be dissociated by successive washes as easily as were those of the parent drugs. Compounds containing two or three pharmacophores had somewhat lower affinities for receptors, but the resulting blockade was persistent even after successive washing.", 
    "33": "All calcium antagonists have the ability to decrease the symptoms and signs in some patients with ischemic heart disease and help lower the blood pressure in hypertensive persons, but in clinical doses nifedipine does not exhibit antiarrhythmic properties, although these are an important part of the action of verapamil, diltiazem and some substances with a similar chemical structure. In certain disorders beta-adrenergic blocking drugs are useful adjuncts, and under some circumstances, particularly variant angina and supraventricular arrhythmias, specific calcium antagonists are the drugs of choice. More data are needed to define the role of calcium antagonists during cardiopulmonary bypass, in the protection of the ischemic myocardium, in the management of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and in specific cases of primary pulmonary hypertension. When used with an appropriate sense of perspective and careful observation, calcium antagonists provide useful additional means of helping selected patients suffering from particular cardiovascular diseases.", 
    "34": "In the past 25 years there has been a many-fold increase in the prospect that with early recognition and modern treatment the newborn with critical congenital heart disease will reach adult life in a healthy condition, prepared to earn a living and to function as a spouse and as a parent. Advancements in the medical treatment of congenital heart disease may create less public acclaim than may surgical treatment but many purely medical developments provide the basis for achieving ultimate surgical success and, by judicious use of some forms of medical treatment, operation can be avoided altogether. The eight major contributions to patient care that are discussed in this review and the 35 that are simply listed are merely examples of the many developments that have occurred in the past 25 years. These include: 1) the organization of pediatric cardiology and the contribution of volunteer health organizations, 2) continuing medical education aimed at promoting early diagnosis of congenital heart disease and prompt referral to a cardiac center, 3) advances in the technology of cardiac catheterization, 4) Rashkind's balloon atrial septostomy and other catheter manipulative procedures, 5) pharmacologic manipulation of the ductus, 6) beta-adrenergic blockade for control of a variety of problems, including paroxysmal hypoxemic attacks, certain arrhythmias and relief of symptoms in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 7) echocardiography, and 8) advances in arrhythmias, electrophysiologic studies and use of pacemakers.", 
    "35": "The effects of beta-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists on both the transmitter outflow and the associated pressure response produced by perivascular nerve stimulation have been studied in human digital arteries and metatarsal veins, in which transmitter stores were labelled with [3H]noradrenaline. Both isoprenaline in arteries, and salbutamol in arteries and veins, at concentrations of 10(-8) - 10(-6) mol/l significantly enhanced stimulation-induced tritium outflow. These two agonists were approximately equipotent. Salbutamol also potentiated pressure responses to stimulation, and propranolol prevented the enhancement of stimulation-induced tritium outflow by salbutamol. Adrenaline, at a concentration of 10(-8) mol/l, but not lower concentrations, significantly enhanced stimulation-induced tritium outflow in arteries. Propranolol, however, had no effect on stimulation-induced transmitter outflow, even when the arteries were either perfused throughout the experiment with a low concentration of adrenaline, or when the arteries were preincubated in a high concentration of adrenaline as well as perfused throughout with a low concentration of adrenaline. It is concluded that facilitatory prejunctional beta-adrenoceptors (probably of the beta 2-subtype) are present in human arteries and veins, but that under the conditions of these experiments, neither transmitter noradrenaline, nor adrenaline that has been incorporated into transmitter stores with noradrenaline, activate these prejunctional beta-adrenoceptors. They may, however, be activated under conditions of enhanced adrenomedullary secretion.", 
    "36": "The epidemiology, pathogenesis, significance and management of hypertension in diabetic subjects are discussed. In Type 1 diabetes the presence of diastolic hypertension is closely related to the presence of diabetic nephropathy, from the stage of persistent proteinuria onwards. There may also be some elevation of systolic pressure. The apparent increased prevalence of hypertension in Type 2 diabetes is largely explicable, directly or indirectly, by obesity but there may be an excess of systolic hypertension among elderly patients. Hypertension in the diabetic population is associated with an increased incidence of both microvascular and macrovascular complications, but whether the high blood pressure is causal is not clear. The possible roles of sodium and insulin, the renin-angiotensin system, catecholamines and physical factors are explored. All current antihypertensive agents have additional limitations and disadvantages when used in diabetic patients: diuretics and beta-blockers are probably the initial drugs of choice. Only in the case of diabetic nephropathy is there yet reasonable evidence of antihypertensive treatment reducing the rate of progression of the disease.", 
    "37": "1 The beta-adrenoceptor agonist, isoprenaline (1.5-3.0 mg kg(-1) intravenously), produced a dose-related increase in rat pineal melatonin content. This increase was prevented by pretreatment with the selective beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, atenolol (2 mg kg(-1)), but not by the beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist, butoxamine (2 mg kg(-1)). The beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonist, terbutaline (5.0 mg kg(-1)), produced a moderate increase in pineal melatonin content.2 Repeated daily administration of desmethylimipramine (10 mg kg(-1) for 10 days) and maprotiline (10 mg kg(-1) for 10 days), antidepressants predominantly inhibiting noradrenaline (NA) uptake, reduced the isoprenaline-induced increase in pineal melatonin content. Amitriptyline (20 mg kg(-1) for 14 days), a drug which inhibits both NA and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) uptake, had a similar effect. The beta-adrenoceptor agonist, clenbuterol (5 mg kg(-1) for 14 days), also attenuated the increase in pineal melatonin produced by isoprenaline.3 In contrast, chronic administration of the selective 5-HT uptake inhibitor, fluoxetine (10 mg kg(-1) for 10 days), or the antidepressants, iprindole and mianserin (both 20 mg kg(-1) for 14 days), which do not inhibit monoamine uptake, failed to reduce the increase in pineal melatonin following isoprenaline. Repeated electroconvulsive shock was similarly without effect.4 Ten hours after the final dose of desmethylimipramine (10 mg kg(-1)) once daily for 10 days there was no change in the usual dark phase increase in pineal melatonin.5 The data suggest that repeated administration of certain antidepressant drugs results in reduced pineal beta-adrenoceptor sensitivity. However the lack of change in the dark phase increase in pineal melatonin following repeated desmethylimipramine, implies that the reduced ss-adrenoceptor sensitivity may be part of an adaptive process which maintains normal pineal function. Therefore the decrease in beta-adrenoceptor number in the brain reported after chronic antidepressant administration may not be associated with a change in overall synaptic function.", 
    "38": "1 Conditions under which transmission in rat isolated superior cervical ganglia may be affected by activation of presynaptic alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors have been investigated by means of an extracellular recording method. 2 Clonidine caused a small hyperpolarization of the ganglia (mean EC50 approximately 2 nM) in unstimulated preparations; with continuous preganglionic stimulation at 0.2 Hz, clonidine markedly decreased the height of the compound action potential (mean EC50 approximately 18 nM). 3 Phentolamine (0.1-3 microM) per se increased the height of the compound action potential by up to 15%, and antagonized the inhibitory effects of adrenaline and clonidine. 4 Using a higher frequency of stimulation (0.5 Hz), the effect of phentolamine (1 microM) was unchanged, whereas the inhibitory effectiveness of adrenaline on the height of the compound action potential was reduced. 5 (+/-)-Propranolol (0.1 microM) did not affect the height of the compound action potential, whereas the inhibitory effects of high concentrations of adrenaline were enhanced. 6 During an infusion of clonidine (1 microM), adrenaline (1-100 microM) and, less effectively, noradrenaline (10-100 microM) increased the height of the compound action potential by up to 14%; these effects were antagonized by propranolol (0.1 microM). 7 In the presence of noradrenaline (10 and 30 microM) adrenaline (100 microM) caused a small (up to 5%) enhancement of the height of the compound action potential. 8 The results obtained are consistent with the existence of presynaptic alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors on preganglionic terminals. The alpha-adrenoceptor may be part of a trans-synaptic inhibitory feedback. mechanism; however the functional role of the facilitatory beta-adrenoceptor is not clear.", 
    "39": "Even though adrenergic nerve terminals between and around thyroid follicles and catecholamine stimulation of thyroid adenylate cyclase have been reported, there is no uniform concept on catecholamine interaction with thyrotrophin (TSH) receptors. Therefore, the effect of catecholamines on TSH-stimulated cyclic AMP (cAMP) accumulation in human follicular thyroid cells has been investigated, to thus eliminating the extrathyroidal actions of catecholamines. Epinephrine, norepinephrine and isoproterenol appeared to be rapid and potent stimulators of intracellular cAMP accumulation, the half maximum increase doses being 4 X 10(-7)M, 1 X 10(-5)M and 5 X 10(-7)M, respectively. While propranolol (1 X 10(-5)M) prevented the stimulatory effect of catecholamines and failed to inhibit the effect of bovine TSH, phentolamine (1 X 10(-5)M) enhanced the potency of norepinephrine and bovine TSH, leaving that of epinephrine unchanged. The effects of epinephrine (2 X 10(-8)M) and isoproterenol (2 X 10(-8)M) were additive to that of bovine TSH (0.5 mU/ml), but the effect of simultaneous stimulation with norepinephrine (5 X 10(-7)M) and bovine TSH (0.5 mU/ml) was lower than expected. Prenalterol, a selective beta 1-agonist, did not stimulate cAMP accumulation, while terbutaline, a selective beta 2-agonist, exerted a potent stimulation. Metoprolol, a selective beta 1-adrenergic blocker, did not affect the response of thyroid follicular cells to isoproterenol. These results demonstrate the existence of beta-adrenergic receptors in human thyroid follicular cells, mainly of the type beta 2, apparently not correlated with TSH receptor. The existence of alpha-adrenergic receptors which counter-regulate TSH functional responses in human thyroid follicular cells is suggested.", 
    "40": "This study was designed to determine whether stimulation of intrarenal alpha-adrenoceptors can increase renin secretion rate (RSR) in the absence of increased renal vascular resistance and to identify the accompanying changes in renal function. Experiments were performed in pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs in which renal perfusion pressure was maintained at approximately 90 mmHg and the infused kidney was acutely denervated. Renal artery infusion of the alpha-adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine (0.5 microgram X kg-1 X min-1 for 30 min) increased RSR from 160 +/- 95 to 1,376 +/- 385 ng ANG I/min (P = 0.01) but did not decrease renal blood flow (RBF); the same dose infused intravenously had no effect on RSR or RBF. Intra-arterial phenylephrine infusion (0.5 microgram X kg-1 X min-1 for 9 min) increased RSR by 500 +/- 157 ng ANG I/min (P less than 0.01) and decreased both inulin clearance (Cin) and urinary sodium excretion (UNaV) by 25% but did not affect RBF. At a lower concentration of phenylephrine (0.2 microgram X kg-1 X min-1 for 9 min), RSR increased by 318 +/- 103 ng ANG I/min (P less than 0.01) and RBF, Cin, and UNaV did not change. The increase in RSR was completely blocked by prazosin but was unaffected by propranolol. In summary, renin secretion can be stimulated by activation of intrarenal alpha-adrenoceptors even in the absence of increased renal vascular resistance.", 
    "41": "Beta-adrenergic blockade appears to have beneficial effects on ischemic myocardium, both in experimental animals and in patients. There is substantial evidence that beta blockade, when induced promptly after coronary occlusion, is capable of limiting the size of experimentally produced infarcts. Although many mechanisms of action have been proposed, the bulk of available evidence suggests that beta blockade reduces the severity of myocardial ischemia by reducing myocardial oxygen demands. Intravenous and oral therapy with beta-blockers is safe when patients are carefully selected and observed. Invasive hemodynamic monitoring is not usually necessary for safe use of these drugs. Preliminary reports based on studies with several beta-blockers indicate that early intervention might limit infarct size or even prevent its occurrence, particularly in patients with evidence of increased sympathetic activity. However, before early beta blockade can be recommended as standard therapy for uncomplicated myocardial infarction, these findings should be confirmed in rigorously controlled clinical trials utilizing several techniques for assessment of infarct size. The most significant finding with beta-blockers in patients with myocardial infarction has been that these drugs can improve survival when administered to patients on a long-term basis after infarction. Although the mechanism of this protective effect is not yet understood, the results are clear enough to warrant the routine administration of a beta-blocker to patients who have had infarction and who have no contraindications to such therapy.", 
    "42": "The results of a prospective study of ventricular electrical instability after myocardial infarction (MI) are presented. Ventricular electrical stability was assessed using a standardized protocol of programmed stimulation in 165 hemodynamically stable patients 6 to 28 days after acute MI. Ventricular electrical instability was defined as induction at programmed stimulation of ventricular fibrillation (VF) or ventricular tachycardia (VT) lasting at least 10 seconds. Of 165 MI survivors, 38 (23%) had ventricular electrical instability. No significant differences were noted between stable and unstable patients in terms of coronary prognostic index, elevation of serum creatine phosphokinase, coronary anatomy, site of MI, or frequency of VT within 48 hours of MI. The mean follow-up period was 8 months (range 0 to 12). There were 7 deaths in stable patients (5 from cardiogenic shock, 1 from septicemia, and 1 unwitnessed) and 10 deaths in unstable patients (8 instantaneous, 1 from cardiogenic shock, and 1 unwitnessed) during the subsequent year. In addition, 2 of 127 stable patients and 4 of 38 unstable patients had spontaneous VT from which they were satisfactorily resuscitated. Thus, the sensitivity of ventricular electrical instability as a predictor of instantaneous death or spontaneous VT was 86% and the specificity 83%. The predictive accuracy of the absence of ventricular electrical instability as an indicator for the absence of instantaneous death or spontaneous VT was 98%. The predictive accuracy of the presence of ventricular electrical instability as a predictor of instantaneous death or spontaneous VT was 32%. Thus, patients with ventricular electrical instability after MI have a high risk of instantaneous death within 1 year; patients without ventricular electrical instability after MI have a low risk of instantaneous death within 1 year; prospective studies of antiarrhythmic therapy and measures to prevent reinfarction and optimize left ventricular performance are required to determine whether instantaneous death can be prevented in unstable patients; and therapy to prevent reinfarction and optimize left ventricular performance may offer the best chance to improve prognosis in stable patients.", 
    "43": "Antianginal efficacy and improved exercise performance with timolol, a new beta-adrenergic blocking agent, was assessed in 23 patients with chronic stable angina pectoris in an 11-week double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Twenty-two of the 23 subjects completed the open-label phase of this investigation (weeks 0 to 6) while receiving 10 to 30 mg of timolol twice daily to optimize exercise capacity. Weekly anginal episodes and nitroglycerin consumption declined from 8.9 +/- 9.1 episodes/week and 8.1 +/- 10.6 tablets/week, respectively, with placebo to 2.7 +/- 5.2 episodes/week and 2.6 +/- 6.0 tablets/week with optimal timolol dose (p less than 0.05). Resting heart rate (HR) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) also decreased from 75.2 +/- 14.0 beats/min and 139.1 +/- 15.7 mm Hg with placebo to 55.1 +/- 8.9 beats/min and 130.5 +/- 15.9 mm Hg with timolol (p less than 0.05). Peak exercise HR, peak exercise SBP, and peak exercise double product (HR X SBP) were significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced when evaluated 12 to 13 hours after administration of timolol compared with placebo (101.5 +/- 21.1 beats/min verus 193.3 +/- 96.2 beats/min, 161.5 +/- 26.7 mm Hg versus 175.6 + 20.8 mm Hg, and 16.6 +/- 5.1 X 10(-3) versus 21.7 +/- 5.4 X 10(-3), respectively). Exercise duration was prolonged from 263.3 +/- 90.2 seconds to 330.3 +/- 73.9 seconds (p less than 0.05), while time to onset of 1 mm S-T segment depression was delayed in 15 patients from 231.8 +/- 86.4 seconds to 298.7 +/- 68.4 seconds (p less than 0.05). During the double-blind phase (weeks 7 to 10), 8 subjects received timolol and 11 patients received placebo. Nitroglycerin consumption at weeks 8 and 10 and anginal frequency at week 8 were unchanged compared with initial placebo treatment. Resting HR, peak exercise HR, and peak exercise double product were significantly attenuated at weeks 8 and 10 in timolol patients compared with their initial placebo exposure. However, these variables were unchanged in placebo subjects compared with their initial placebo therapy. Exercise duration was again prolonged at week 8 in timolol subjects compared with initial placebo results (315.1 +/- 61.2 seconds versus 261.3 +/- 68.8 seconds, p less than 0.05), but not at week 10. Placebo patients demonstrated no difference at week 8 or 10 in exercise performance compared with initial placebo treatment. Timolol twice daily, therefore, is potentially useful in some patients with angina pectoris. Other patients may, however, require a shorter dose interval for optimal angina control and maximal improvement in exercise capacity.", 
    "44": "The stepped-care approach to management of hypertension has proved effective for the majority of hypertensive patients. The use of diuretics as first-step therapy produces normotensive levels in as high a percentage of patients as any of the second-step drugs. Diuretics are easy to titrate and relatively inexpensive, and side effects are not generally serious. Beta blockers may be preferred in certain patients, who in many cases can be identified clinically without special testing. The use of small doses of a diuretic and a second-step agent, such as a beta blocker, may prove more efficacious and cause fewer side effects than larger doses of single agents.", 
    "45": "The chronic administration of phenobarbital (180 mg/day p.o.) alters the binding, bioavailability, metabolism and pharmacokinetics of propranolol. Consequently, phenobarbital affects the pharmacological activity of propranolol as measured by inhibition of isoproterenol tachycardia in dogs. Altered binding affects beta blockade in two ways; a reduction in the free fraction and the volume of distribution. To separate the effects of active metabolites from the parent drug, we have used an integrated form of the equation (DR -- 1) = K.(p), where DR is the dose ratio and p is the concentration of the free (unbound) propranolol in plasma. The activity due to propranolol itself is subtracted from the total observed amount of beta blockade. In this way, phenobarbital was shown to increase the amount of beta blockade which was due to active metabolites. Phenobarbital treatment shortened the time course of beta blockade. The beta blocking half-life for propranolol followed its pharmacokinetic half-life closely for a variety of experimental conditions. This suggests that pharmacological activity data could be used to describe pharmacokinetics without measuring blood concentrations.", 
    "46": "We examined the interaction between isoproterenol and erythro-dl-1-(7-methylindan-4-yloxy)-3-isopropylaminobutan-2-ol (ICI 118,551), a beta-2 selective adrenergic receptor antagonist, with respect to heart rate, diastolic blood pressure and twitch tension (soleus muscle) in anesthetized cats. Dose-response curves to isoproterenol (0.025-1.0 micrograms/kg i.v.) were generated for each parameter and then repeated successively after three doses of ICI 118,551 (10, 25 and 100 micrograms/kg i.v.) ICI 118,551 did not significantly alter isoproterenol-induced changes in heart rate, but effects on diastolic blood pressure and twitch tension were inhibited competitively. The data confirm the beta-2 nature of the skeletal muscle adrenergic receptor and suggest that it may be slightly more sensitive than that in blood vessels. Because depression of twitch tension is known to correlate with essential tremor, the data are consistent with clinical reports demonstrating control of tremor by nonselective beta adrenergic receptor antagonists. ICI 118,551 may be efficacious in controlling tremor in man.", 
    "47": "Etintidine is a competitive antagonist of histamine H2-receptors in the isolated spontaneously beating guinea-pig right atrium with a pA2 value of 6.6 relative to values of 6.2, 6.7 and 7.3 for cimetidine, ranitidine and tiotidine, respectively. Low affinities for histamine H1 (pA2 = 4.2), cholinergic (pA2 = 4.4) and beta adrenergic (pA2 = 3.8) receptors indicated that etintidine has a high degree of specificity for the H2-receptor. The other antagonists studied also exhibited low affinities for these receptors; however, relative to these compounds, etintidine demonstrated a somewhat greater affinity for cholinergic receptors. Etintidine also antagonized basal gastric acid secretion in the conscious gastric fistula rat and histamine, pentagastrin, carbachol, 2-deoxy-D-glucose and meal-stimulated gastric acid secretion in conscious gastric fistula and Heidenhain pouch dogs. After oral administration to conscious Heidenhain pouch dogs, ED50 values for the inhibition of near maximal gastric acid secretion stimulated by histamine were 7.1, 5.4, 0.74 and 0.69 mumol/kg for cimetidine, etintidine, ranitidine and tiotidine, respectively. Onset and duration of the gastric antisecretory activities of the four compounds were similar. The order of potency as histamine H2-receptor and gastric antisecretory antagonists was cimetidine less than etintidine less than ranitidine less than tiotidine. Based on the high degree of specificity for the H2-receptor and its potent gastric antisecretory activity, etintidine may prove to be a useful agent in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease.", 
    "48": "Today's sophisticated diagnostic techniques make it possible to determine, virtually at the bedside, the site and size of an infarct and its effect on the patient's hemodynamic status. Thus, it is now possible to identify the patient who will benefit from aggressive therapy and to spare those who do not need or will not be helped by such treatment. Three phases of management are discussed.", 
    "49": "Pafenolol, a new beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, has been shown in animals to be more selective for beta 1-adrenoceptors than metoprolol. It was studied in asthmatic patients to evaluate whether it was more selective with respect to circulatory effects and especially whether this selectivity influenced bronchial muscle tone less than metoprolol, which has been shown to have beta 1-adrenoceptor selectivity similar to that of atenolol. Intravenous pafenolol (5 mg and 7.5 mg), metoprolol (15 mg), and saline were given double-blind at random and thereafter four increasing doses of terbutaline were given intravenously to seven asthmatic patients with reproducible reversibility of airways obstruction. After the terbutaline dose-response curve was determined, terbutaline was inhaled three times in increasing doses. A separately reported exercise study in the same patients showed that 5 mg pafenolol and 15 mg metoprolol were equipotent with respect to beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade, whereas 7.5 mg pafenolol tended to increase the blockade. The reflex tachycardia on terbutaline stimulation after pafenolol was greater than after metoprolol due to less blockade of beta 2-adrenoceptors in peripheral blood vessels. The bronchial effect of pafenolol was equal to that of saline, but there was a difference between the terbutaline dose-response curves after pafenolol and metoprolol that caused a rightward shift of the dose-response curve. Thus, pafenolol was shown to be more beta 1-selective than metoprolol.", 
    "50": "Since heart failure may occur in the setting of lung dysfunction and CO2 retention with only modest increases in cardiac work load, we questioned whether myocardial function is impaired by hypercapnic acidosis. To determine the influence of hypercapnic acidosis on right ventricular function, we measured the effects of acute (2 hours) and chronic (2 weeks) hypercapnic acidosis on right ventricular performance during normal and increased right ventricular afterload in five conscious dogs. Systemic hemodynamic and right ventricular functions were unaltered during normal right ventricular afterload by acute hypercapnic acidosis (PaCO2 = 49 +/- 3 mm Hg, pH = 7.27 +/- 0.003). As right ventricular afterload was increased by progressive balloon occlusion of the right ventricular outflow tract during acute hypercapnic acidosis, the rise (slope) in right ventricular end-diastolic pressure was increased 4-fold (P less than 0.01) over that observed in normocapnic control. Maximum isovolumic right ventricular dP/dt rose (P less than 0.05) comparably with increasing right ventricular afterload during normocapnic control and acute hypercapnic acidosis. Chronic hypercapnic acidosis (PaCO2 = 55 +/- 2 mm Hg, pH = 7.28 +/- 0.01) resulted in systemic vasodilation and increased (P less than 0.05) heart rate and cardiac output during normal right ventricular afterload. As right ventricular afterload was increased during chronic hypercapnic acidosis, the rate of rise in right ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 2-fold (P less than 0.01) above normocapnic control but maximum isovolumic right ventricular dP/dt was unchanged in contrast to normocapnic control and acute hypercapnic acidosis. Moreover, cardiac output fell and stroke work was unchanged with increasing afterload during chronic hypercapnic acidosis. beta-Adrenergic blockade resulted in an increased (P less than 0.01) rate of rise in right ventricular end-diastolic pressure with afterload during normocapnic control and chronic hypercapnic acidosis. We conclude that hypercapnic acidosis results in diminished right ventricular performance during increased right ventricular afterload, evidenced by accentuated rise in right ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and may contribute to the congestive heart failure and edema observed in patients with pulmonary hypertension and CO2 retention.", 
    "51": "We have studied the cardiovascular responses which can be evoked when the gallbladder is stimulated pharmacologically or mechanically. To determine the potential for reflex cardiovascular activation, we applied capsaicin, a selective thin-fiber agonist, to the serosal surface of the gallbladder. This algesic substance evoked cardiovascular responses which included increases in mean arterial pressure (MAP) by 14%, heart rate (HR) by 3%, left ventricular dP/dt at 40 mm Hg developed pressure (dP/dt DP40) by 14%, and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) by 19%. There were no demonstrable effects on the cardiovascular system when this same substance was applied to the surface of the liver. Bilateral vagotomy at the level of the diaphragm did not alter the responses to capsaicin. Right atrial overdrive pacing did not reduce the positive inotropic effect elicited when the gallbladder was stimulated. Removal of the celiac and superior mesenteric ganglia, or selective denervation of the gallbladder, abolished the cardiovascular responses which were evoked previously. beta-Adrenergic blockade, however, abolished only the reflex chronotropic and intropic responses. Thus, the potential for eliciting reflex cardiovascular alterations by stimulating gallbladder afferents with capsaicin was established. In subsequent studies, stimulating the gallbladder with bradykinin, an endogenous polypeptide, evoked a reflex activation of the cardiovascular system similar to that seen with capsaicin (MAP = 14%; HR = 4%; dP/dt DP40 = 18%; SVR = 14%). These reflex responses were dose dependent, were produced by mucosal as well as serosal application of this substance, and were eliminated by bilateral splanchnic nerve action. In contrast to capsaicin and bradykinin, distension of the gallbladder did not cause any cardiovascular alterations. We conclude that stimulation of gallbladder afferents by the algesic substance capsaicin or by bradykinin, an endogenous substance that under certain conditions may be formed in bile, can induce significant reflex activation of the cardiovascular system.", 
    "52": "The effects of endogenous and of exogenous norepinephrine were studied in isolated rings of canine left circumflex coronary artery and its first ventricular branch. Norepinephrine was released from adrenergic nerve endings by transmural electrical stimulation and by tyramine. In rings contracted with prostaglandin F2 alpha, transmural electrical stimulation resulted in frequency-dependent relaxations which were blocked by propranolol or tetrodotoxin; tyramine and exogenous norepinephrine caused concentration-dependent relaxations which were blocked by propranolol. The tyramine-induced relaxations also were inhibited by cocaine. The left circumflex artery was less sensitive than its branch to beta-adrenergic activation; this difference was significant even between rings of the two vessels immediately adjacent to the branching point and was abolished by phentolamine. In the presence of propranolol, transmural electrical stimulation, tyramine and phenylephrine, produced contractions of the left circumflex artery, but not the branch; these contractions were prevented by phentolamine. Phentolamine, but not prazosin, augmented the beta-adrenergic response of left circumflex artery to low frequency stimulation; in arteries preincubated with 3H-norepinephrine, this was accompanied by an increased overflow of tritiated neurotransmitter. The prejunctional effect of phentolamine was also evident in branch coronary arteries which exhibit no postjunctional alpha-adrenergic responses. With high frequency stimulation, both alpha-adrenergic antagonists equally augmented the relaxation of left circumflex artery; the efflux of tritiated norepinephrine was not different from untreated arteries. These experiments demonstrate, in isolated coronary arteries, that the primary adrenergic response to released endogenous norepinephrine is beta-adrenergic relaxation. The prejunctional effects of nonspecific alpha-adrenergic antagonists preclude their use in determining the importance of postjunctional coronary alpha-adrenergic receptor activation caused by sympathetic nerve stimulation.", 
    "53": "The treatment of classic angina pectoris must be carefully individualized, taking into account factors such as age, degree of disability, anatomic location and extent of lesions, ventricular function, and psychologic makeup of the patient. In some instances, early coronary bypass surgery is indicated. In other cases, a trial with full medical therapy is indicated and, if successful, medical management should be continued with careful, ongoing monitoring of the clinical course. Medical treatment should be considered a failure only if maximal dosage of nitrates and beta blockers is attained without satisfactory control of symptoms. The advent of calcium-channel blockers appears to add a new dimension in the treatment of variant angina, and these drugs may be useful also in certain patients with fixed coronary lesions and concomitant coronary artery spasm.", 
    "54": "(+/-)125 I-cyanopindolol ((+/-) I CYP) was used to characterize beta-adrenoceptors on rat lung and cerebral cortex membranes. The affinity of (+/-) ICYP was higher for lung (Kd = 64.3 pM) at 37 degrees C. The association reaction of (+/-) ICYP was faster with lung (k+1 = 1.52 X 10(9) M-1.min-1) than with cerebral cortex beta-adrenoceptors (k+1 = 1.75 X 10(8) M-1.min-1). In both tissues, the dissociation reaction followed a biphasic process with a fast (t 1/2 = 15.4 min and 5.6 min for lung and cerebral cortex respectively) and a slow component (t 1/2 = 474 min and 255 min for lung and cerebral cortex respectively). The thermodynamic parameters for (+/-) ICYP - beta-adrenoceptors binding have been determined from kinetics and equilibrium studies, for the two tissues, at several temperatures between 0 degrees and 44 degrees C. For lung and cerebral cortex, Arrhenius plots were linear with different energies of activation. Van't Hoff plot was not linear for lung and the standard enthalpy and entropy changes of (+/-) ICYP - beta-adrenoceptors interaction decreased linearly with temperature: the binding occurred with a negative heat capacity change (delta Cp degrees = -368.9 cal. moles-1.K-1) at 25 degrees C. Thermodynamic and kinetic results show that binding of (+/-) ICYP to lung beta-adrenoceptors could involve two successive equilibria with a conformational change of the beta-adrenergic receptor.", 
    "55": "Flavonoids are used clinically in conditions with inflammatory oedema. The effects of a clinically employed flavonoid preparation, O-(beta-hydroxyethyl)-rutoside, in this paper abbreviated 'HR', were studied in a rat skin model designed to evaluate the leakage of 125I-labelled human serum albumin after intracutaneous injection of substances increasing microvascular permeability. Intravenous injection of 25-500 mg HR/kg body weight (b.w.) 30 min before administration of permeability-increasing agents gave a dose-related attenuation of the permeability increase due to histamine, bradykinin and fibrin degradation products. The maximum inhibitory effect of HR was observed at 250 mg/kg b.w.. Treatment with the beta 2-receptor agonist terbutaline also reduced the increased permeability. This effect of HR and terbutaline included reduction of oedema due to formaldehyde, citrate and dextran 70. The effect of terbutaline was counteracted by the beta-receptor blocker propanolol. The effect of HR on blood flow in the skin, determined as clearance of 133Xe, was not considered important as an explanation for its inhibition of microvascular permeability.", 
    "56": "Release of chemical mediators from sensitized mast cells is of established importance in allergic asthma and can account for most of the pathology and recognized changes in physiology. There is still uncertainty regarding specific modes of action of most of the drugs effective in the treatment of asthma. Changes in respiratory mucosal permeability induced directly or indirectly by viruses may initiate atopic sensitization in genetically predisposed subjects. Increased bronchial irritability accounts for much of the bronchoconstriction in both allergic and nonallergic asthma. Leukotrienes cause the bronchoconstriction in patients with aspirin sensitivity, but the factors that differentiate these patients from subjects who tolerate aspirin remain unknown. Asthmatics are characterized by a substantial increase in the number of alpha-adrenergic receptors and a more modest decrease in the number of beta-adrenergic receptors as well as increased sensitivity to cholinergic stimulation. Both mediator release and bronchial irritability may be important causes of exercise induced asthma."
