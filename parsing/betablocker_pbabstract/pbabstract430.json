The author presents experience assembled in Czechoslovakia with bopindolol and nebivolol which belong into the class of these substances. Treatment with beta-blockers is effective also in hypertension in elderly subjects. The author mentions a group of extensive investigations conducted abroad, comparing beta-blockers and diuretics in the treatment of hypertension. From the analysis it is apparent that beta-blockers exert a favourable effect also in primary prevention of ischaemic heart disease. In the conclusion the author deals with the strategy of treatment of hypertension associated with other diseases, using different types of beta-blockers.", 
    "1": "We investigated blocking effects of the selective beta 1-adrenoceptor blocker atenolol (0.1-100 micrograms/kg, i.v.), the selective beta 2-adrenoceptor blocker ICI 118,551 (1-1000 micrograms/kg, i.v.) and the combination of the two drugs on positive chronotropic and dromotropic responses to norepinephrine (NE) released by stimulation of the sympathetic nerves in anesthetized, neurally decentralized, open-chest dogs after atropine was given. Stimulation of the intracardiac sympathetic nerves to the SA nodal region or to the AV nodal region selectively increased heart rate or decreased AV conduction time, respectively. ICI 118,551 inhibited the chronotropic or dromotropic response to each stimulation in a dose-dependent manner, but its inhibition of the dromotropic response was less than that of the chronotropic response. Atenolol similarly inhibited either the positive chronotropic or dromotropic response to each stimulation in a dose-related manner. The combination of atenolol and ICI 118,551 attenuated the responses to each stimulation more than atenolol alone. These data indicate that sympathetic nerve stimulation activates both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors of the SA and AV nodes and that the proportion of beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated effects on the AV node is less than that on the SA node. These results suggest that neurally released NE in part controls physiological functional cardiac responses mediated through beta 2-adrenoceptors, in addition to the responses predominantly mediated through beta 1-adrenoceptors.", 
    "2": "To study the long-term effects of pharmacological combination therapy, a comparison was made of the haemodynamic changes in patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension following a 4-week treatment of propranolol or nipradilol, a new nonselective beta-blocker with nitrovasodilating effect. Nipradilol (12 mg/dag, n = 12) significantly diminished wedged hepatic venous pressure (WHVP, 25 +/- 16%), the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG, 20 +/- 12%), and estimated hepatic blood flow (EHBF, 18 +/- 16%). Propranolol (30 mg/day, n = 11) also caused a significant reduction in WHVP (22 +/- 21%) and HVPG (24 +/- 21%), but not in EHBF. The percentage of portal pressure reduction and the frequency of nonresponders did not differ between the nipradilol and propranolol groups. Both agents reduced heart rate by approx. 20%. Nipradilol, however, did not cause a significant reduction in cardiac index (CI) versus a 14% reduction by propranolol. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and central venous pressure, an index of preload, were decreased slightly in the nipradilol group. When nonresponders were excluded, there was a significant correlation of the percentage of reduction between WHVP and CI or systemic vascular resistance, in the nipradilol group. These results indicate that nipradilol may have potent hypotensive effects on portal hypertension, similar but not superior to propranolol. Nipradilol, at the dosage used in the present study, did not appear to exert a nitrovasodilating effect to enhance the portal pressure reduction induced by beta-blocking action.", 
    "3": "The effects of beta-adrenoceptor blockade, duration of ischaemia and preceding ischaemic periods on ischaemia-induced changes in myocardial K+ balance were studied in 12 open-chest pigs. Coronary venous blood was directed through a shunt from the coronary sinus to the right atrium. Continuous recordings of arterial, shunt blood [K+] and shunt flow enabled us to compute myocardial K+ balance during and after consecutive 2-, 2-, 5-, 10- and 2-min periods of regional ischaemia separated by 30 min of reperfusion. beta-adrenoceptor blockade (propranolol 1 mg kg-1 i.v.) given between the first and second ischaemic period did not alter the effects of 2 min ischaemia on myocardial K+ balance. Total K+ losses induced by 2, 5 and 10 min of ischaemia were 67.1 (40.6-93.3), 106.7 (69.4-176.8) and 192.2 (117.7-332.6) mumol 100 g-1, respectively. Thus, the plateau observed in extracellular [K+] between 2 and 10 min of regional ischaemia could, at least partly, be explained by continuous drainage of K+ from ischaemic myocardium into the surrounding normally perfused tissue. The total K+ loss induced by the second and last 2-min ischaemic period were 67.1 (40.6-93.3) and 35.6 (23.1-53.6) mumol 100 g-1 (P less than 0.001), respectively. This reduction shows that ion homeostasis during ischaemia was greatly changed in myocardium which had been 'preconditioned' and 'stunned' by 5 plus 10 min of ischaemia. Total amount, maximal rate and duration of post-ischaemic K+ reuptake increased with the duration of the preceding ischaemia. Moreover, K+ re-uptake after 2 min of ischaemia and the number of sarcolemmal Na/K pumps ([3H]ouabain binding), were normal in stunned myocardium. From these observations we conclude that progressive stimulation of the Na/K-pump occurred when ischaemia was prolonged from 2 to 10 min, and that Na/K-pump function was preserved in stunned myocardium.", 
    "4": "Substances modulating calcium permeability of cell membrane (verapamil imidazol, 4-aminopyridine), decreasing motor activity (meprobamate) and blocking adrenoreceptors (clophelin, propranolol, droperidol, aminazine++ have been studied for their action on the monosynaptic discharge of the ventral roots (MD VR) reinforced due to chronic cutting of the spinal cord. It is found that verapamil and meprobamate depress more strongly MD VR of rats with chronic cutting of the spinal cord than of those with the acute one. Imidazol and 4-aminopyridine reinforcing MD VR of rats with acute cutting of the spinal cord have no influence on the analogous index of rats with chronic cutting of the spinal cord. Adrenoblockers do not change the amplitude of MD VR in both groups of the animals.", 
    "5": "It has been established that the lesion of the sciatic nerve, accompanied by a disturbance of normal neurotrophic provision of a kidney as a result of coming to the organ of the perverted nervous stimuli (by the neuro-conductive path through sympathetic nerves and by participation of the hypothalamus--hypophysis--peripheral glands system), leads to disturbance of functioning of mineral-corticoid receptors of kidneys. It has been also established that simultaneous pharmacological blockade of neuro-conductive and humoral pathways of transmission to the kidney of pathological stimuli from the central stump of the cut sciatic nerve prevents the development of trophic organ disturbances, tested by the state of the kidney mineral-corticoid receptor apparatus, while pharmacological stimulation of sympathetic nervous system leads to the greater disturbance of aldosterone reception by the cells of kidney channels. A valid conclusion can be made that propranolol is a substance, which may weaken possible non-adequate reactions of peripheral tissues to the action of physiologically active substances during the development of the consequences of the lesion of the nervous system and thus to prevent the development of neurogenic dystrophies.", 
    "6": "Chronic beta-blockade has evolved to an important therapeutic strategy in medicine. Not all its therapeutic effects may be explained by its direct action on the beta-adrenergic system. We therefore investigated if chronic beta-blockade in vivo or in isolated cell systems may modulate also inhibitory receptors of the adenylyl cyclase system. Chronic treatment with metoprolol for 6 days (10 mg/day) induced an increase of beta-adrenergic receptors in rat cardiac plasma membranes (53 +/- 8 vs 80 +/- 12 fmol/mg protein). Simultaneously the density of cardiac muscarinic M2 receptors decreased significantly from 150 +/- 17 to 110 +/- 12 fmol/mg protein without any change of the affinity of the receptors for their agonists or antagonists. By this mechanism chronic beta-blockade leads to an unexpected impairment of the muscarinic-mediated inhibition of the adenylyl cyclase. This transregulation of inhibitory receptors by chronic beta-blockade was not restricted to the heart but also reduced the muscarinic receptors of rat lung (35 +/- 4 vs 24 +/- 3 fmol/mg protein). Additionally, other inhibitory receptors of the adenylyl cyclase system such as the A1 adenosine receptors of rat brain were reduced by chronic beta-blockade (532 +/- 32 vs 444 +/- 26 fmol/mg protein). This transregulation of A1 adenosine receptors occurred only after chronic beta-blockade with the active stereoisomer (-)-metoprolol whereas the (+)-isomer was ineffective. The ability of the remaining A1 adenosine receptors to form the agonist-promoted high affinity state was unaltered. Their reduction, however, was sufficient to abolish the phenylisopropyl-mediated inhibition of the adenylyl cyclase. To evaluate if this regulation of various inhibitory receptors in different organs may represent a general cellular regulation mechanism, we investigated whether this transregulation also occurred in isolated cells. Isolated smooth muscle cells derived from the vas deferens (DDT1 MF-2) were cultivated in the presence of the beta-blocker atenolol (10(-5) M) for 3 days. Chronic beta-blockade in these isolated cells induced an increase of beta-adrenergic receptors and concomitantly a significant decrease of A1 adenosine receptors (460 +/- 42 vs 368 +/- 18 fmol/mg protein). The affinity of the A1 adenosine receptors for their agonists and antagonists and the ability of the remaining receptors to form the agonist-promoted high affinity state remained unaltered. In contrast, the reduction of receptor density greatly impaired the adenosine-mediated inhibition of the adenylyl cyclase. These data demonstrate that chronic beta-blockade leads to a functionally significant reduction of inhibitory receptors of the adenylyl cyclase system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "7": "Thrombolysis and PTCA offer reperfusion for limiting infarct size and reducing mortality in acute myocardial infarction patients. Heparin, aspirin, nitrates, beta-blockers and calcium antagonists are very important in supplementing these two primary reperfusion modes. The adjunctive role of these five pharmacologic agents is discussed.", 
    "8": "Topical beta-blockers reduce the intraocular pressure (IOP) by blockade of sympathetic nerve endings in the ciliary epithelium causing a fall in aqueous humour production. Two types of topical beta-blockers are available for use in glaucoma: nonselective, which block both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors; and cardioselective, which block only beta 1-receptors. Of the beta-Blockers commercially available, timolol, levobunolol, metipranolol and carteolol are nonselective, and betaxolol is cardioselective. Twice-daily timolol is probably the most effective agent in lowering IOP, although levobunolol is equally effective and can be used once daily with little difference in effect. Carteolol is used twice daily and any theoretical advantage in diminished side effects conferred by its partial beta-agonist activity compared with timolol has not been fully substantiated. Metipranolol is effective twice daily and does not have partial beta-agonist activity. Betaxolol has an effect comparable to timolol in lowering IOP, but is less effective in some patients. beta-Blockers can be used with other antiglaucoma medications, but their combined action with epinephrine (adrenaline) is suspect, particularly in the case of the nonselective beta-blockers, and the effect should be assessed in patients on an individual basis. Local stinging can be a problem in some patients with betaxolol. The most serious side effects of beta-blockers are the exacerbation of chronic obstructive airways disease with nonselective agents and the precipitation of bronchospasm in some patients. Betaxolol seems relatively free of adverse respiratory effects, although this may be dose-related and extreme caution should still be exercised in patients with any history of respiratory illness. Because of the lower risk of precipitating side effects, betaxolol is probably the beta-blocker of first choice for use in glaucoma; timolol or levobunolol are reserved for patients who do not respond satisfactorily to betaxolol and are quite free of respiratory disease.", 
    "9": "Resting metabolic rate was measured in 10 healthy volunteers (25 yr, 73 kg, 182 cm) for 1 h before and 4 h during intravenous (iv) fructose administration (20% at 50 mumol.kg-1.min-1) with (+P) or without (-P) propranolol (100 micrograms/kg, 1 microgram.kg-1.min-1) during the last 2 h. Some subjects were studied a further 2 h with fructose infusion and +P or -P in hyperinsulinemic (2.9 pmol.kg-1.min-1) euglycemic conditions. Glucose turnover ([3-3H]glucose, 20 muCi bolus and 0.2 muCi/min) was calculated over 30 min at 0, 2, 4, and 6 h. The thermic effect of iv fructose was approximately 7.5% and decreased to 4.9 +/- 0.4% (P less than 0.01) +P. During the euglycemic clamp the thermic effect was 6.2 +/- 0.9% (-P) and 5.3 +/- 0.9% (+P). Hepatic glucose production (HGP) was 11.7 mumol.kg-1.min-1 (0 h) and did not change after 2 h iv fructose (11.8 +/- 0.5 and 9.8 +/- 0.6 mumol.kg-1.min-1 -P and +P, respectively) but increased to 13.8 +/- 0.9 (-P) and 12.9 +/- 0.8 mumol.kg-1.min-1 (+P) (P less than 0.01) after 4 h. HGP was suppressed to varying degrees during the euglycemic clamp. It is concluded that 1) the greater thermic effect of fructose compared with glucose is probably due to continued gluconeogenesis (which is suppressed by glucose or glucose-insulin) and the energy cost of fructose metabolism to glucose in the liver. 2) There is a sympathetically mediated component to the thermic effect of fructose (approximately 30%) that is not mediated by elevated plasma insulin concentrations similar to those observed with iv glucose.", 
    "10": "beta-Adrenergic receptor (beta AR) subtypes differ in their affinities for some agonists and antagonists and thus may potentially impart different cellular effects based on this ligand-binding specificity. However, the possibility that there may be subtype-specific events subsequent to ligand binding has not been evaluated extensively. In particular, although beta ARs stimulate adenylyl cyclase by coupling to the guanine nucleotide-binding protein Gs, no studies have directly assessed the coupling efficiencies among isolated beta AR subtypes. We, therefore, permanently transfected the mammalian fibroblast cell line CHW-1102 with beta 1- or beta 2AR cDNAs and studied the coupling characteristics of these two receptor subtypes, each expressed at approximately 335 fmol/mg of protein. Both receptors mediated equivalent maximal increases in adenylyl cyclase activities (6.63 +/- 1.85-fold for beta 1AR versus 6.10 +/- 0.53-fold for beta 2AR; p = not significant). However, the isoproterenol dose-response curves for the beta 2AR were shifted to the left, compared with those for the beta 1AR (EC50 of 52.3 +/- 2.87 nM and 191 +/- 10.5 nM, respectively; p less than 0.05), resulting in an approximately 4-fold greater potency for the beta 2AR versus the beta 1AR. Thus, at the submaximal isoproterenol concentration of 30 nM, the beta 2AR stimulated adenylyl cyclase approximately 50% more than did the beta 1AR. This finding was not due to a difference in the affinities of isoproterenol for these receptors, which were found to be the same, as determined by competition binding studies with 125I-cyanopindolol in the presence of GTP. The ability of beta 1- and beta 2ARs to form the high affinity ternary complex was assessed in agonist competition studies without guanine nucleotide. We found that, whereas the proportion of receptors in the high affinity state was equivalent between the two receptor subtypes, the affinity of this state for isoproterenol was approximately 5-fold greater for the beta 2AR, compared with the beta 1AR (KH for beta 2AR, 11.8 +/- 3.1 nM; KH for beta 1AR, 61.7 +/- 18.3 nM; p less than 0.05). In addition, we examined physical and functional coupling of beta 1- and beta 2ARs to Gs using the agonist epinephrine, which also has equal binding affinity for both receptor subtypes. As with isoproterenol, epinephrine was more potent in stimulating adenylyl cyclase and promoted a higher affinity ternary complex for the beta 2AR. Thus, a greater degree of both physical and functional agonist-promoted coupling occurs between Gs and beta 2AR, compared with beta 1AR. We conclude that coupling to Gs by beta 1- and beta 2ARs is subtype selective and is a potentially important distinguishing feature among these members of the beta AR family.", 
    "11": "We compared the cost per drop and cost per year of therapy for five commercially available ocular beta-blockers (Timoptic, Betagan, Betoptic, Betoptic S, and Optipranolol) based on retail prices in Philadelphia, Pa; New Orleans, La; and San Francisco, Calif. Variations in bottle volumes and drop size combined to yield up to a 48% differential in number of drops per bottle. Average retail price variations were 28% within brands (between pharmacies), 29% between brands, and 29% between regions. Yearly costs were consistently less with larger bottles. Factoring drops-per-bottle, cost of brand, and cost by pharmacy, the cost of a year's supply of beta-blocker in 5-mL bottles in the least expensive region (New Orleans) ranged from $52.25 for Optipranolol to $278.91 for Betagan (534% of the price for Optipranolol). The marked differential in yearly cost among antiglaucoma medications should perhaps be a factor in the recommendations made by physicians and health-care providers.",

    "14": "beta-adrenergic blockade, although still considered an investigational therapy for the treatment of congestive heart failure, has been proven in several studies to improve ventricular function, including myocardial contractility and relaxation. In addition, since beta-blockade up-regulates myocardial beta-receptors, the myocardium becomes more responsive to graded doses of beta-agonists. Speculation regarding the possible mechanisms of these effects is presented. In addition, since beta-blockers have been shown to reduce neurohormonal activation, they may have a beneficial effect on survival. Although small pilot studies or subgroup analysis of larger studies suggest beta-blockade therapy improves survival in heart failure, this has yet to be proven. Large prospective trials are warranted to study this issue.", 
    "15": "As current data suggest, beta-blockers improve ventricular function and reduce neurohormonal activation in heart failure. beta-blockers should be considered as adjunctive therapy in patients with congestive heart failure.

    "17": "Choosing antihypertensive agents that protect patients against cardiovascular and other complications is a growing trend in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension. Calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are favored because they have neutral or positive effects on lipid levels and insulin resistance. The alpha 1 blockers, especially doxazosin mesylate (Cardura), are enjoying a resurgence in popularity because they have a beneficial effect on lipid levels. In terms of preserving patients' quality of life, the ACE inhibitors in particular have been shown to have a positive impact. It has been shown that systolic hypertension in elderly patients should definitely be treated, but the most appropriate agent has yet to be defined. Therapy should be tailored to the individual. The following questions should be considered when choosing an antihypertensive agent: (1) What are its side effects (especially metabolic ones)? (2) Does it require only once- or twice-a-day dosing? (3) Does it cause regression of left ventricular hypertrophy? (4) Does it prevent death from coronary artery disease? (5) How will it affect quality of life? (6) How much does it cost? The goal of therapy should be to provide adequate blood pressure control throughout the day, enhance compliance, and protect the heart, brain, and kidneys without adversely affecting metabolic state.", 
    "18": "The coupling of beta 1 and beta 3 adrenergic receptors to adenylyl cyclase was examined in membranes of isolated white adipocytes. The activation of adenylyl cyclase by isoproterenol (ISO) was biphasic. The high-affinity activation of adenylyl cyclase, which occurred at submicromolar concentrations of ISO, was mediated by beta 1 receptors, whereas low-affinity activation was mediated by beta 3 receptors. The relative activation of adenylyl cyclase by beta 3 receptors was less when ISO was used to stimulate activity, compared to when the beta 3-selective agonist BRL 37344 was used. These data indicate that both receptor subtypes can stimulate the same adenylyl cyclase in membranes of control cells, and that the activation of adenylyl cyclase by beta 1 receptors by low concentrations of catecholamines can obscure the activation by beta 3 receptors by high concentrations of catecholamines. Exposure of adipocytes to ISO at concentrations that either selectively stimulate beta 1 receptors or nonselectively stimulate both beta receptor subtypes greatly decreased the ability of beta 1, but not beta 3, receptors to activate adenylyl cyclase. In contrast, the exposure of cells to the beta 3-selective agonist BRL only slightly desensitized beta 1 receptors and did not affect beta 3 receptor activation of adenylyl cyclase. These data indicate that acute agonist exposure desensitizes beta 1, but not beta 3, receptors.", 
    "19": "The stimulation of adenylyl cyclase by catecholamines in neonatal brown adipose tissue (BAT) is markedly biphasic, suggesting the existence of receptors that have both high and low affinities for catecholamines. The identities of these receptors were examined by comparing responses in neonatal BAT membranes to those of Chinese hamster ovary cells which had been transfected to express the cloned rat beta 1 and beta 3 receptors. The results from these experiments indicate that high-affinity stimulation of adenylyl cyclase by catecholamines in BAT is mediated by beta 1 receptors, as evidenced by the potencies of norepinephrine and isoproterenol at this receptor and the potent blockade of the receptor by alprenolol. The low-affinity catecholamine receptor appears to be the beta 3 receptor, as indicated by the low potency of catecholamine agonists and the inability of low concentrations of alprenolol to block this activity. Furthermore, this receptor, like the cloned rat beta 3 receptor, was antagonized by (-)-4-(3-t-butylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy)benzimidazol-2-one (CGP 12177) and was stimulated by (R',R')-4-(2-[(2[(3-chlorophenyl)-2- hydroxyethyl]amino)propyl]phenyl)phenoxyacetic acid (BRL 37344). These results indicate that both beta 1 and beta 3 receptors couple to adenylyl cyclase in BAT and that activation of adenylyl cyclase in neonatal BAT is mediated primarily by beta 3 receptors. Beta 3 receptors were also clearly detected in weanling BAT with the beta 3-selective agonist BRL 37344. However, when catecholamines were used to stimulate activity, the activation of adenylyl cyclase by beta 1 receptors, which occurred at low concentrations of catecholamines, obscured the activation of adenylyl cyclase by beta 3 receptors, which occurred only at high concentrations.",

    "25": "Catecholamines have been proposed as a stimulus for the hypertrophic response to pressure overload of the heart and could also mediate the membrane lipid changes associated with cardiac hypertrophy. To address both of these possibilities, cardiac hypertrophy was induced by aortic constriction in the presence or absence of chronic alpha- or beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Heart weights and heart weight to body weight ratios in aortic-constricted rats of the adrenoceptor-blocked and vehicle-treated groups were elevated to the same extent when compared with values in sham-operated rats of each group. Analysis of the fatty acyl composition of the major phospholipid classes revealed that similar changes occurred in vehicle-treated, alpha-blocked, and beta-blocked aortic-constricted rats when compared with respective groups of sham-operated rats. Specifically, linoleic acid was reduced in the phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and cardiolipin (CL) fractions in all groups of aortic-constricted rats. This reduction was accompanied by increased docosahexaenoic acid, arachidonic acid, or palmitic acid in phosphatidylcholine; docosahexaenoic acid in phosphatidylethanolamine; and oleic acid in cardiolipin fractions. Adrenoceptor blockade did not prevent or attenuate the major changes in the fatty acyl composition of phospholipids or the increase in heart weight associated with aortic constriction. This suggests that a change in the level of adrenoceptor stimulation is not the stimulus for cardiac hypertrophy or the observed alterations in phospholipid composition in the pressure-overloaded rat heart.", 
    "26": "The beta-adrenergic blocking agent propranolol was shown in previous studies to increase orthotopic bone formation in rats. To understand the cellular mechanisms underlying this observation, propranolol was tested for its effects on osteoblastic cells, which possess adenylate cyclase-coupled beta-adrenergic receptors. The ability of propranolol to modulate parathyroid hormone (PTH) and isoproterenol effects on adenylate cyclase activity and on alkaline phosphatase expression was studied in the osteoblast-like rat osteosarcoma cell line ROS 17/2.8. At concentrations between 0.1 and 10 microM, DL-propranolol specifically inhibited adenylate cyclase stimulation by the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol, but did not alter either basal or PTH-stimulated activity. At these concentrations, propranolol also blunted the inhibition of alkaline phosphatase activity by isoproterenol but not PTH. Propranolol alone had minimal effects on ROS alkaline phosphatase activity at low concentrations (0.1-1 microM), but became inhibitory at high concentrations (10-100 microM). Thus, the direct effects of physiologically relevant propranolol concentrations on osteoblastic cells can be attributed principally to beta-adrenergic blockade. These findings further suggest that propranolol may enhance bone formation by preserving osteoblastic activity in the face of inhibition by beta-adrenergic agonists.", 
    "27": "Helical strips of bovine rostral cerebral arteries (anterior cerebral, middle cerebral, and internal carotid artery) responded to norepinephrine with contractions, whereas the caudal cerebral arteries (posterior communicating, posterior cerebral, and basilar artery) relaxed in response to the amine. After blockade of alpha-adrenoceptors, norepinephrine-induced rostral artery contractions were reversed to relaxations, which were smaller than those in the caudal arteries. Isoproterenol, dobutamine, and terbutaline produced greater relaxations in caudal than in rostral arteries, but forskolin relaxed these arteries to a similar magnitude. The isoproterenol-induced relaxation was not affected by removal of the endothelium. Maximal relaxations induced by terbutaline in caudal arteries were much inferior to those by isoproterenol, norepinephrine, and dobutamine. Relaxations caused by isoproterenol, norepinephrine, and terbutaline in the caudal arteries were attenuated by metoprolol, but not influenced by butoxamine. Relaxations mediated possibly by beta 1-adrenoceptor subtypes are greater in bovine caudal cerebral arteries than in the rostral arteries. The heterogeneity does not appear to be associated with the different ability of cyclic AMP to relax arterial smooth muscle but with the difference of beta-adrenoceptor populations and/or processes from the receptors to adenylate cyclase.", 
    "28": "Recent work has shown that alterations in the dynamic atrioventricular (AV) nodal response to changes in heart rate can significantly modify AV nodal function. The present study was designed to evaluate the nature and potential importance of sympathetic regulation of the rate-dependent properties of the AV node. Selective stimulation protocols and mathematical formulations were used to independently quantify AV nodal recovery, facilitation, and fatigue in 12 morphine-chloralose-anesthetized dogs. Vagal effects were prevented by bilateral vagal transection and intravenous atropine, and the sinus node was crushed to allow a broader range of pacing cycle lengths. In seven dogs with sympathetic nerves intact, beta-adrenergic receptor blockade increased the recovery time constant (tau rec) for the conduction of premature test beats from 47 +/- 2 (mean +/- SEM) msec (control) to 62 +/- 1 msec (p less than 0.001), whereas isoproterenol decreased tau rec to 38 +/- 1 msec (p less than 0.001). In addition, beta-blockade increased the maximum amount of rate-dependent AV nodal fatigue from 7 +/- 1 msec (at a cycle length of 198 +/- 9 msec [control]) to 17 +/- 2 msec (p less than 0.001). In five dogs with decentralized stellate ganglia, tau rec was decreased from 71 +/- 3 msec (control) to 57 +/- 4 msec and 48 +/- 2 msec (p less than 0.001 for each) by left stellate ganglion stimulation at 5 and 10 Hz, respectively. Maximum fatigue was similarly reduced from 16 +/- 1 msec (control) to 12 +/- 2 msec (p = NS) and 8 +/- 1 msec (p less than 0.01), respectively. Stellate ganglion stimulation, isoproterenol, and beta-blockade did not alter AV nodal facilitation. A mathematical model incorporating quantitative indexes of AV nodal function accurately accounted for tachycardia-dependent increases in the atrial-His activation interval, which were enhanced by beta-adrenergic receptor blockade and reduced by isoproterenol. Furthermore, this model showed that beta-adrenergic effects were increased by increasing heart rate, with the majority of the rate-dependent action being due to changes in the time course of AV nodal recovery. We conclude that beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation alters functional properties that govern the AV nodal response to changes in heart rate. These changes in functional properties alter the ability of the AV node to conduct impulses during tachycardia and, as such, could play a major role in the ability of sympathetic stimulation to promote and beta-adrenergic receptor blockade to prevent the occurrence of AV nodal reentrant arrhythmias.", 
    "29": "Acute, subacute, and chronic treatment with nebivolol, a novel beta 1-selective adrenergic antagonist, significantly lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate in patients with essential hypertension. No orthostatism and bradycardia were reported. A comparison between a normal control group and 23 hypertensive patients revealed that the ratio between the preejection period (PEP) and the left ventricular ejection time (LVET) of the systolic time intervals (STI) was significantly increased in the hypertensive patients, owing to a prolongation of the PEPc (PEP corrected for heart rate). Treatment with nebivolol 5 mg once a day significantly improved the PEP/LVET, in acute conditions from 0.42 +/- 0.023 to 0.39 +/- 0.018, after one month of treatment from 0.40 +/- 0.013 to 0.36 +/- 0.013 and after one year of treatment from 0.41 +/- 0.012 to 0.36 +/- 0.010, owing to a significant shortening of the PEPc. There was no correlation between changes of blood pressure and changes of STI. Diastolic dysfunction is an early finding in hypertension and may well be reflected in the prolongation of the PEPc. The improvement of left ventricular performance, as measured with STI, suggests that treatment with nebivolol may favorably influence the underlying diastolic dysfunction and be of therapeutic value for hypertensive patients with left ventricular damage.", 
    "30": "Histamine has a positive inotropic action in humans. Recent controversial data have suggested that histamine2 (H2) receptor blockade depresses overall left ventricular systolic performance in healthy volunteers. To explore the possibility that H2 receptors positively influence basal left ventricular contractile tone, 10 normal subjects were studied by using imaging and Doppler echocardiography and calibrated subclavian pulse data in a blinded, randomized, two-period crossover trial with measurements obtained at the end of each 7-day period. Oral drug administration consisted of either the potent H2 antagonist famotidine (40 mg/day) or placebo. Left ventricular circumferential end-systolic wall stress-rate-corrected velocity of fiber shortening (Vcfc) relations were generated over a range of loads with methoxamine. Contractility was assessed by using Vcfc at a common end-systolic wall stress. During each study, data were obtained before and during high dose intravenous esmolol administration to determine the contributions, if any, of sympathetic reflex responses. Famotidine did not alter blood pressure, left ventricular percent fractional shortening, circumferential end-systolic wall stress, stroke volume index, cardiac index, total vascular resistance or ventricular contractile state in comparison with placebo but did decrease heart rate by 3 beats/min (p less than 0.05). With beta-adrenergic blockade, no differences in contractility were evident between esmolol alone and famotidine plus esmolol. Thus, H2 receptor blockade with famotidine does not alter myocardial mechanics or cardiac sympathetic tone, suggesting that in humans basal left ventricular contractile state is not physiologically dependent on the H2-mediated effects of histamine.", 
    "31": "Mechanisms of death among patients who died within 18 h of enrollment in the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction Phase II (TIMI II) study were analyzed. Of 3,339 patients enrolled, 32 died within the 1st 4 h and 31 died within the subsequent 14 h. Thirteen of the 63 patients had shock at enrollment; 22 had advanced hemodynamic compromise without shock and 28 initially had minimal to no compromise. Prior infarction was present in 16 patients (25%). Pump failure was responsible for 39 early deaths (62%), ventricular rupture for 10 (16%), arrhythmia for 8 (13%) and complications of therapy for 6 (10%). Nine of 720 patients randomized to immediate intravenous beta-adrenergic blocking agent therapy had an early death compared with 6 of 714 assigned to deferred beta-blocker therapy. Thus, mortality is highest in the early hours after myocardial infarction, even in patients treated with thrombolytic therapy and is most frequently due to pump failure. These results imply that efforts to reduce mortality during this critical time period should be directed at prevention, limitation or palliation of early pump failure.",

    "33": "Using a quantitative autoradiographic technique with 125I-cyanopindolol (ICYP), the density and transmural distribution of beta adrenergic receptors were compared between eight cardiomyopathic BIO 14.6 Syrian hamsters with heart failure and six normal age matched controls (BIO 14.6HAM).", 
    "34": "Binding of ICYP to transmural slices of hamster myocardium was rapid, saturable, stereoselective, and displaceable by antagonists. The binding isotherm showed a significant increase in the total tissue content of beta adrenergic receptors in the failing myocardium of cardiomyopathic hamsters: 15.3(SEM 1.6) fmol.mg-1 protein v 9.4(1.2) fmol.mg-1 protein in normal myocardium of control hamsters (p < 0.05). There was no difference in receptor affinity. Quantitative autoradiography showed regional heterogeneity of beta adrenergic receptors in cardiomyopathic hamsters, with an increase of beta adrenergic receptor density in the septal and subendocardial regions. In addition, the regions with increased interstitial fibrosis corresponded to the sites of increased beta adrenergic receptor density.",

    "36": "The activity of central serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) systems has been reported to be affected by repeated, and to a lesser extent by acute, lithium chloride (LiCl) treatment. Because (1) acute LiCl administration increases sympathoadrenal function, and in turn plasma glucose levels, and (2) stimulation of either the 5-HT1A, the 5-HT1C or the 5-HT2 receptor subtype has adrenal catecholamine-releasing and hyperglycemic effects, we have investigated the influence of prior blockade of either of these receptor subtypes on plasma catecholamine and glucose responses to acute LiCl administration in conscious, catheterized rats. Acute administration of LiCl (1-8 mEq/kg IV) triggered dose-dependent increases in plasma epinephrine (Epi), norepinephrine (NE), and glucose levels throughout the 60-min analysis. In contrast, administration of NaCl (8 mEq/kg IV) did not alter plasma Epi or NE levels, nor did it affect plasma glucose levels. Prior blockade of 5-HT1A receptor and beta-adrenoceptors by means of (-)-propranolol (5 mg/kg IV), 10 min beforehand) did not affect plasma Epi and NE responses to LiCl (4 mEq/kg), but it did prevent the hyperglycemic effect of LiCl. Plasma Epi, NE and glucose responses to LiCl remained intact in rats pretreated with the 5-HT1C/5-HT2 receptor antagonist LY 53857 (1 mg/kg IV), 10 min beforehand). These results strongly suggest that LiCl-induced adrenal catecholamine release (and hyperglycemia) is not mediated by increased 5-HT release.", 
    "37": "There is evidence that one or more metabolites of arachidonic acid can produce positive inotropic effects and may also be implicated in the enhanced alpha 1-adrenoceptor responses in hearts from diabetic rats. We therefore carried out a study to investigate the possibility that arachidonic acid metabolites could be involved in the altered cardiac alpha 1-effect of norepinephrine (in the presence of propranolol) in chronic streptozotocin-diabetic rats. Our results have shown that in the presence of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin or the thromboxane synthetase inhibitor imidazole, the norepinephrine-stimulated positive inotropic effect and the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate were significantly increased in control hearts but were unaltered in hearts from diabetic rats. The addition of the prostacyclin synthetase inhibitor tranylcypromine reduced the norepinephrine-stimulated positive inotropic effect and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate formation only in diabetic hearts and had no effect in the controls. The nature and physiological significance of the enhanced positive inotropic effect and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate formation in the control heart with the addition of indomethacin and imidazole are still unclear. The effect of tranylcypromine may indicate the participation of prostacyclin in mediating the enhanced alpha 1-inotropic effect of norepinephrine in the chronic diabetic heart.", 
    "38": "A 3'-methyl-4-dimethylaminoazobenzene (3'-MeDAB) containing diet was given to 6 weeks old female Donryu rats, and the number of adrenoceptors and the response of adenylate cyclase in the hepatocytes were measured. The treatment with 3'-MeDAB led to rapid increases in [125I]iodocyanopindolol ([125I]ICYP)- and [3H]clonidine-binding sites to hepatic membranes without significant changes in the Kd values. The number or beta-adrenoceptors defined by [125I]ICYP binding sites was increased with a biphagic mode. The [3H]clonidine binding reached a peak 2 weeks after the start of the carcinogen diet and then began a slow descent. The alpha 2-adrenoceptor was defined by [3H]clonidine binding being selectively inhibited by an alpha 2-antagonist, yohimbine, but not by an alpha 1-antagonist, prazosin, or a beta-antagonist propranolol. Catecholamine responsiveness to adenylate cyclase in hepatocytes also increased during treatment with 3'-MeDAB. However, the efficacy of norepinephrine (NE) in activating cyclase was lower than that of isoproterenol (IPN) during 4 to 8 weeks of the carcinogen diet. The difference between the efficacies of IPN and NE resulted from inhibiting adenylate cyclase through alpha 2-adrenoceptors by NE. Therefore, we noticed that the increasing pattern of the number of beta-adrenoceptors did not always parallel IPN-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity and that the increase in the number of alpha 2-adrenoceptors preceded the difference between the efficacies of IPN and NE in activating adenylate cyclase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "39": "1. We have previously reported that the addition of noradrenaline to [3H]-inositol-labelled adult rat atria or isolated perfused hearts caused the release of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate, which was metabolized by dephosphorylation to inositol-4-monophosphate. Inositol-1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate and its dephosphorylation products were not detected. 2. In the current study, the addition of noradrenaline to [3H]-inositol-labelled adult rat cardiomyocytes caused the release of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate, which was metabolized in part by phosphorylation to inositol-1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate. 3. These results demonstrate that the isolation and culture of rat adult cardiomyocytes initiates enhanced generation of inositol-1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate. This change would be expected to enhance the calcium response of the cells to stimulation of alpha 1-adrenoceptors.",

We described the effect of untreated hyperthyroidism on Na+K+ATPase activity, ouabain binding sites and intracellular sodium concentration. We found a reduction in Na+K+ATPase activity and in number of ouabain binding sites with a concomitant increase in intracellular sodium. B-blockade therapy failed to restore normal pump activity and sodium concentration, where only thionamide treatment was successful when it was able to decrease free T3.", 
    "41": "Effects of protein kinase C (PKC) on bradykinin (BK)-induced intracellular calcium mobilization, consisting of rapid Ca2+ release from internal stores and a subsequent sustained Ca2+ inflow, were examined in Fura-2-loaded osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells. The sustained Ca2+ inflow as inferred with Mn2+ quench method was blocked by Ni2+ and a receptor-operated Ca2+ channel blocker SK&F 96365, but not by nifedipine. The short-term pretreatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), inhibited BK-stimulated Ca2+ inflow, and the prior treatment with PKC inhibitors, H-7 or staurosporine, enhanced the initial internal release and reversed the PMA effect. Moreover, 6 h pretreatment with PMA caused similar effect on the BK-induced inflow to that obtained with PKC inhibitors, whereas 24 h pretreatment was necessary to affect the internal release. On the other hand, the translocation and down-regulation of PKC isozymes were examined after PMA treatment of MC3T3-E1 cells by immunoblot analyses of PKCs with the isozyme-specific antibodies. 6 h treatment with PMA induced down-regulation of PKC beta, whereas longer treatment was needed for down-regulation of PKC alpha. Taken together, it was suggested that the BK-induced initial Ca2+ peak and the sustained Ca2+ inflow through the activation of a receptor-operated Ca2+ channel, are differentially regulated by PKC isozymes alpha and beta, respectively, in osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells.", 
    "42": "Hormonal and neural status are major determinants for cellular growth. The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of the adrenergic hormones on pre-adipocyte growth in primary cell culture. Stromal-vascular cells were obtained from the inguinal pad of young rats and grown in culture for two weeks. Cells were exposed to norepinephrine (NE) during the proliferative phase of growth, labelled by [3H]-thymidine incorporation and then placed on a differentiation promoting medium. Adipocytes and stromal cells were separated using a density gradient, and [3H]-thymidine content was determined for both cell types. NE reduced [3H]-thymidine uptake indicating a reduction in pre-adipocyte proliferation. NE-induced inhibition of pre-adipocyte growth was blocked by the presence of propranolol, whereas phenoxybenzamine had no effect, thereby suggesting that NE-inhibition is through beta-adrenoceptors. Pre-adipocytes were treated with NE for varying lengths of time to investigate whether cells were desensitized to chronic beta-adrenergic stimulation. In addition, adenosine deaminase (ADA) was also applied to eliminate adenosine which may accumulate during NE stimulation. Neither the duration of NE exposure nor ADA treatment affected adrenergic control of adipocyte growth. These studies indicate that NE reduces pre-adipocyte proliferation and therefore may be an important negative regulatory component of adipocyte growth.", 
    "43": "The nucleus paragigantocellularis (PGi) is the major excitatory glutamatergic input to the locus coeruleus (LC). Glutamate activation of the LC has previously been shown to produce beta-adrenergic-dependent potentiation of the perforant path- (PP) evoked population spike in the dentate gyrus (DG). The present study asks if electrical stimulation of the PGi, by activating the LC endogenously, can produce a parallel beta-receptor-dependent potentiation of the PP-evoked population spike. An optimal interstimulus interval (ISI) was determined for PGi-PP stimulation in urethane-anesthetized rats and propranolol was used to assess the role of noradrenergic beta-receptors. PGi stimulation potentiated the PP-evoked population spike at an optimal ISI of 30 ms. The population synaptic response slope and spike latency were not affected. Propranolol blocked the PGi-induced potentiation, as would be expected for beta-receptor-dependent modulation. The parallels between PGi- and LC-induced effects on the PP-evoked population spike suggest PGi stimulation offers an alternate method of LC activation for studies of LC's role in behavior.", 
    "44": "Post-training administration of the centrally acting muscarinic agonist oxotremorine (50.0 microgram/kg, ip) facilitated 48-hr retention, in mice, of a one-trial step-through inhibitory avoidance response. Oxotremorine-induced memory facilitation was not prevented by the simultaneous post-training administration of the central beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (2.0 mg/kg, ip). In contrast, post-training administration of atropine (0.5 mg/kg, ip), but not methylatropine (0.5 mg/kg, ip), completely prevented the facilitatory effects of the central beta-adrenoceptor agonist clenbuterol (30.0 micrograms/kg, ip) on retention. Low subeffective doses of clenbuterol (3.0 micrograms/kg, ip) and oxotremorine (6.25 or 12.5 micrograms/kg, ip) potentiated their effects and facilitated retention when given simultaneously immediately post-training. These results suggest that clenbuterol may induce memory facilitation through an increase of the release of acetylcholine in the brain. Post-training administration of a high dose of clenbuterol (1.0 mg/kg, ip) significantly impaired retention. Clenbuterol (1.0 mg/kg, ip)-induced impairment of retention was completely prevented by simultaneous post-training administration of oxotremorine (6.25, 12.5, or 50.0 micrograms/kg, ip). The centrally acting anticholinesterase physostigmine (21.5 or 68.0 micrograms/kg, ip) partially prevented clenbuterol-induced impairment of memory. The peripherally acting anticholinesterase neostigmine (68.0 micrograms/kg, ip) modified neither retention nor the amnestic effects of clenbuterol. Considered together, these findings are consistent with the view that brain muscarinic cholinergic mechanisms are involved in both the facilitatory and impairing effect of post-training clenbuterol on the modulation of memory storage.", 
    "45": "Age-related changes in regulation of receptor response have been observed in several tissues and include regulation of beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-receptor) responses. The role of cellular aging in age-related changes in receptor response is not clear. We have examined the effect of aging in vitro on human fibroblast beta-receptor function. MRC-5 (embryonic lung) fibroblasts were aged by replication to produce cells of early, middle and late stages corresponding to the following cumulative population doublings: 15-20, 35-45 and greater than 50, respectively. Fibroblast membrane beta-receptor responses to isoproterenol (ISO, 0.1 mM) did not differ between the three stages. Adenylate cyclase responses to prostaglandin E1 (PGE1, 1 microM), guanosine triphosphate (GTP, 0.1 mM) and 5'-guanylimidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p, 0.1 mM) were also similar between the stages. Beta-receptor density (Bmax) was unaffected by in vitro aging. Beta-receptor agonist affinity, an indication of the capacity for beta-receptor coupling to the nucleotide binding protein (NS), was also unaffected by cell aging. These findings suggest that cellular aging in fibroblasts alone is not accompanied by changes in beta-receptor function.",

Forskolin stimulated renin secretion per cell. ANP increased extracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate and suppressed basal renin output. Suppression of basal renin output was due to a reduced secretion rate per cell, without a change in cell growth. ANP suppressed isoprenaline-induced and dbcAMP-induced renin output by blocking increased cell growth, and forskolin-induced renin output by blocking renin secretion.",

    "50": "Obstetric hemorrhage may occur throughout pregnancy and the puerperium. The purpose of this study was to investigate the reactivity of isolated, suffused uterine arteries from obstetric patients with uncontrollable uterine bleeding and to compare those blood vessels with uterine arteries from patients undergoing cesarean hysterectomy for other medical reasons (control patients). The uterine arteries from the control patients (n = 9) responded with maximal or near-maximal constriction to norepinephrine (30 mumol/L, 3.6 +/- 1 gm), potassium chloride (75 mmol/L, 10.2 +/- 3 gm), prostaglandin F2 alpha (30 mumol/L, 1.8 +/- 1 gm), and arginine vasopressin (1 mumol/L, 18.8 +/- 2.6 gm). In uterine arteries from five patients with uncontrollable bleeding, the constrictor responses to the same drugs were markedly depressed: norepinephrine (30 mumol/L, 0.5 +/- 0.2 gm), potassium chloride (75 mmol/L, 1.9 +/- 0.8 gm); prostaglandin F2 alpha (30 mumol/L, 0 gm), and arginine vasopressin (1 mumol/L, 0.2 +/- 0.05 gm). Uterine arteries from two patients exhibited no constrictor responses to norepinephrine (30 mumol/L), potassium chloride (75 mmol/L), prostaglandin F2 alpha (30 mumol/L), or arginine vasopressin (1 mumol/L). The impaired responses to the vasoconstrictor drugs were not reversed by indomethacin (1 mumol/L), which is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthetase; methylene blue (10 mumol/L), which is a blocker of endothelium-derived relaxing factor activation of guanylate cyclase; or propranolol (1 mumol/L), a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist. The levels of adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate were not elevated in the uterine arteries from the patients with obstetric hemorrhage. The impaired reactivity to the multiple vasoconstrictors implies that a mechanism involved in constriction common to all of the constrictors is depressed or blocked. Furthermore, the depression or lack of reactivity of these isolated uterine arteries is not mediated by vasodilatory prostaglandins, endothelium-derived relaxing factor, beta-adrenergic receptors, or elevated levels of adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate. The results suggest that obstetric hemorrhage involves, in part, a lack of constrictor reactivity of the uterine vasculature.", 
    "51": "The effects of forskolin (FO) and a water-soluble derivative of FO, L858051 (7 beta-desacetyl-7 beta-[gamma-(N-methylpiperazino)-butyryl] forskolin), were compared on calcium currents (ICa) studied by the whole-cell patch-clamp technique in frog ventricular cardiac myocytes. Both FO and L858051 increased ICa, with half-times of 160 +/- 20 sec and 343 +/- 22 sec, respectively. The stimulation was blocked by internal perfusion with inhibitors of protein kinase A. The EC50 for stimulation of ICa was 0.3 microM for FO and 1.0 microM for L858051. The maximal stimulated current was the same for both drugs, 20.3 microA/cm2 and 23.1 microA/cm2, respectively. Internal perfusion with 30-500 microM guanylyl 5'-imidodiphosphate [Gpp(NH)p] suppressed ICa stimulation by low concentrations of FO or L858051. This suppression was due to a rightward shift in the concentration-response curve, with increases in the EC50 values to 11.4 microM for FO and 28.4 microM for L858051. Isoproterenol (ISO) was ineffective in increasing ICa after the FO-stimulated ICa had been reduced by Gpp(NH)p and FO had been washed out. In contrast, after the L858051-stimulated current had been reduced by Gpp(NH)p, ISO stimulated ICa significantly. This stimulation was blocked by inhibitors of protein kinase A and was due to a positive effect of L858051 not shared by FO. A brief application of L858051 after Gpp(NH)p had blocked the ISO response restored the ISO response for at least 30 min. This effect was mimicked by internal perfusion with low concentrations of L858051. We conclude that the ability of brief exposure of L858051, but not FO, to restore the response to ISO after Gpp(NH)p is due to the accumulation of L858051 intracellularly, due to its hydrophilicity. Because internal L858051 and FO are very ineffective in stimulating adenylyl cyclase, whereas internal L858051 can restore the ISO response blocked by Gpp(NH)p, we propose that FO compounds can affect adenylyl cyclase at two sites, one site that is accessible only from the extracellular side that stimulates catalytic activity and another that is accessible from the intracellular side that increases beta-agonist efficacy in the presence of Gpp(NH)p.", 
    "52": "The relationship between age and beta-adrenergic receptor sensitivity to the pharmacologically active S(-) enantiomer and the racemic mixture of propranolol was evaluated in 46 healthy male subjects (age range, 24 to 89 years). The in vivo apparent dissociation constants for S(-)- and R,S(+/-)-propranolol were determined on the basis of the unbound steady-state plasma concentration of each and the dose of isoproterenol needed to increase the heart rate of the subjects by 25 beats/min in the absence (I25) and then in the presence of a continuous propranolol infusion. The I25 was significantly correlated with age (r = 0.700, p less than 0.05). The apparent dissociation constant for S(-)- and R,S(+/-)-propranolol demonstrated a significant, although weak, increase with advancing age (r = 0.403 and r = 0.396, respectively; p less than 0.05). Although these findings confirm those of other studies, beta-receptor sensitivity to propranolol was only modestly decreased with age in this study.", 
    "53": "In both parotid and submandibular glands a parasympathetic non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic (NANC) nerve-evoked secretion of saliva was demonstrated. Saliva evoked by exogenous substance P was poor in protein, while saliva evoked by VIP was protein-rich. In a subthreshold dose for fluid secretion VIP released protein and potentiated the responses elicited by substance P, particularly regarding the output of protein. The two neuropeptides may contribute to the parasympathetic NANC secretion of saliva in the mink. Further, agonists responsible for the secretory NANC response are also likely to contribute to the secretory response of the glands to parasympathetic stimulation in the absence of autonomic receptor blockade in this species.", 
    "54": "A 3-month double-blind multicenter trial compared the efficacy and safety of perindopril, a new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, with atenolol in mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. A total of 190 patients, 49 of whom were diabetic, entered the perindopril-atenolol comparison. Of these, 163 had been previously treated and had a 4-week run-in period on placebo; 27 had previously been untreated and received placebo for 2 weeks. At entry, all patients who had a supine diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 95-115 mm Hg were randomized to receive perindopril 2 mg or atenolol 25 mg, once daily. Patients were assessed at 2 weekly intervals for the first month and then monthly for 2 more months. If supine DBP was greater than 90 mm Hg, treatment was increased by stepwise doubling of dose up to 8 mg perindopril or 100 mg atenolol once daily, and later by the addition of hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg, (indapamide 2.5 mg in diabetic patients) once daily. The two groups were homogeneous prior to treatment except for supine and erect heart rate, which were higher in the perindopril group than in the atenolol group (p less than 0.05). Mean supine DBP was 101.1 +/- 0.6 mm Hg in the perindopril group (n = 94) and 99.9 +/- 0.6 mm Hg in the atenolol group (n = 96). After 3 months' active treatment, 74% of patients in the perindopril group achieved a supine DBP of less than or equal to 90 mm Hg and 73% of patients in the atenolol group achieved the same goal. Monotherapy controlled supine DBP in 67% of the perindopril group and 63% of the atenolol group. The decrease in supine DBP was not significantly different between the two groups (-12.9 +/- 0.9 versus -14.7 +/- 0.9 mm Hg) but the decrease in erect DBP was lower in the perindopril group (-10.3 +/- 0.9 versus - 13.4 +/- 1.0 mm Hg, p less than 0.02). Heart rate was reduced in the atenolol group (p less than 0.001). Sixteen patients withdrew from the study; nine were attributed to adverse events, two in the perindopril group and seven, including one death, in the atenolol group. Cough was spontaneously reported by 13% patients of the perindopril group and 1% patients of the atenolol group. In 5% of the perindopril cases this was mild and associated with upper respiratory tract infection. The nature and incidence of other symptoms were similar with both drugs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "55": "Homologous desensitization of beta-adrenergic receptors, as well as adaptation of rhodopsin, are thought to be triggered by specific phosphorylation of the receptor proteins. However, phosphorylation alone seems insufficient to inhibit receptor function, and it has been proposed that the inhibition is mediated, following receptor phosphorylation, by the additional proteins beta-arrestin in the case of beta-adrenergic receptors and arrestin in the case of rhodopsin. In order to test this hypothesis with isolated proteins, beta-arrestin and arrestin were produced by transient overexpression of their cDNAs in COS7 cells and purified to apparent homogeneity. Their functional effects were assessed in reconstituted receptor/G protein systems using either beta 2-adrenergic receptors with Gs or rhodopsin with Gt. Prior to the assays, beta 2-receptors and rhodopsin were phosphorylated by their specific kinases beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK) and rhodopsin kinase, respectively. beta-Arrestin was a potent inhibitor of the function of beta ARK-phosphorylated beta 2-receptors. Half-maximal inhibition occurred at a beta-arrestin:beta 2-receptor stoichiometry of about 1:1. More than 100-fold higher concentrations of arrestin were required to inhibit beta 2-receptor function. Conversely, arrestin caused half-maximal inhibition of the function of rhodopsin kinase-phosphorylated rhodopsin when present in concentrations about equal to those of rhodopsin, whereas beta-arrestin at 100-fold higher concentrations had little inhibitory effect. The potency of beta-arrestin in inhibiting beta 2-receptor function was increased over 10-fold following phosphorylation of the receptors by beta ARK, but was not affected by receptor phosphorylation using protein kinase A. This suggests that beta-arrestin plays a role in beta ARK-mediated homologous, but not in protein kinase A-mediated heterologous desensitization of beta-adrenergic receptors. It is concluded that even though arrestin and beta-arrestin are similar proteins, they display marked specificity for their respective receptors and that phosphorylation of the receptors by the receptor-specific kinases serves to permit the inhibitory effects of the \"arresting\" proteins by allowing them to bind to the receptors and thereby inhibit their signaling properties. Furthermore, it is shown that this mechanism of receptor inhibition can be reproduced with isolated purified proteins.", 
    "56": "In order to determine if repeated injections of cocaine produced long-lasting alterations in catecholaminergic binding sites, rhesus monkeys were treated with saline (1.0 ml/15 kg) or cocaine (3.0-4.0 mg/kg) four times daily for 14 consecutive days and sacrificed two weeks after the last injection. The densities of dopamine D1 receptor binding sites, dopamine transporter binding sites and beta adrenergic receptor binding sites were significantly decreased in caudate nucleus to 51%, 17% and 61% of control, respectively, two weeks after repeated cocaine injections. There were no differences in D2 receptor binding site densities in the caudate, nor were there differences in binding sites between groups in the other brain regions examined: prefrontal cortex (D1, D2, dopamine transporter, beta), nucleus accumbens (D1, D2, dopamine transporter) and substantia nigra (D2). Behavioral observation showed that the cocaine-treated monkeys became sensitized to the repeated injections. Early in the regimen, these animals displayed stereotypic grooming, buccal movements and visual checking after each injection that differed significantly from the saline-treated animals. As the regimen progressed, the frequency of grooming decreased while the frequencies of visual tracking and splayed legs increased in a manner consistent with the development of behavioral sensitization. Together, these findings suggest that the caudate nucleus may be more sensitive than other dopamine-containing brain regions to long-lasting pre- and post-synaptic effects of repeated cocaine administration, and that the changes seen in dopaminergic neurons may be related to behavioral sensitization.", 
    "57": "Propranolol having been used for decades was compared with low dose theophylline and placebo in the treatment of essential tremor. Ten de novo patients with essential tremor were treated for three months in a blind cross-over study. Tremor assessed by volumetric method decreased significantly after one week propranolol (80 mg/day) administration, while it was reduced by theophylline (150 mg/day) after two weeks. There was no difference between the two treatments after four weeks. During the propranolol period tension and dizziness were observed in some cases. According the results both drugs are recommended for treating of essential tremor.", 
    "58": "1-O-Octadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate (octadecylacetyl-GP) and its deacetylation product were used as a model of phosphatidic acid and its lyso derivatives, respectively. The binding, transbilayer movement, and intermembranous transport, which should be related to its metabolism in guinea pig peritoneal polymorphonuclear leukocytes, were studied. The albumin extraction procedure (Tokumura, A., Tsutsumi, T., Yoshida, J., and Tsukatani, H. (1990) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1044, 91-100) was used for studying the transbilayer movement of [3H]octadecylacetyl-GP. The binding, translocation, and metabolism of octadecylacetylglycerol, a dephosphorylated product of octadecylacetyl-GP, in polymorphonuclear leukocytes were also investigated for comparison. The translocation of octadecylacetyl-GP was dependent on temperature, but not on its concentration (in the range of 1-100 nM). The rate of translocation of octadecylacetyl-GP was much slower than that of octadecylacetylglycerol. Treatment of polymorphonuclear leukocytes with N-ethylmaleimide did not affect the translocation of octadecylacetyl-GP. These results suggest that the transbilayer movement of octadecylacetyl-GP is driven by a diffusion process, not by a carrier protein. From these findings, the process of translocation of octadecylacetyl-GP is concluded to be a rate-limiting step in its metabolic conversion to triglyceride, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylcholine.",

The group first treated with atenolol showed no improvement in summed recall scores when results seen during atenolol therapy and placebo administration were compared (P = 0.10); however, this group had an improvement of 16.1 words (CI, 5.6 to 26.5 words), or of 16%, when the atenolol score was compared with the nifedipine score (P = 0.026). In the group first treated with nifedipine, 6 of 11 patients 55%) showed a decrease of 5 words or more during nifedipine therapy compared with placebo, whereas only 1 of the 14 patients (7%) in the group first treated with atenolol showed a similar decrease (P less than 0.01). On the digit symbol test (a psychomotor test), patients treated first with atenolol tended to improve, whereas patients treated first with nifedipine tended to decline. The difference between nifedipine and atenolol, in terms of the change from the score seen during placebo, was 4.3 codings (CI, 0.7 to 7.9 codings) or 10% (P = 0.043). No statistically significant differences were seen between nifedipine and atenolol therapy regarding the other measures of psychomotor ability, sustained attention, motor performance, verbal fluency, or abstract reasoning, and no effects of either drug on mood or psychopathologic symptoms were noted.",

    "66": "Circadian variation in the onset of cardiovascular events including sudden cardiac death, myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias has been described. The effect of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction on the circadian variation of ventricular premature complex (VPC) frequency was evaluated in 132 patients with frequent VPCs and reduced LV function after myocardial infarction. Patients were prospectively divided in 2 groups based on LV ejection fraction (EF) (those with LVEF less than or equal to 0.30, and those with LVEF between 0.30 and 0.45). Median hourly VPC frequencies and heart rates were compared between the 2 groups. Subgroup analyses based on treatment with beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents and on New York Heart Association functional class were also performed. In patients with LVEF greater than 0.30, a distinct circadian variation of VPCs, and the expected morning increase in VPC frequency were present. In contrast, a distinct circadian variation of VPCs was absent in patients with LVEF less than or equal to 0.30. A circadian variation of VPC frequency was also absent in patients with severe symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association class III-IV). Treatment with beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents was associated with a loss of the circadian variation of VPC frequency. The circadian variation of heart rate was also blunted in the group treated with beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents. The proportion of subjects manifesting a positive correlation between heart rate and VPC frequency was lower in subjects with LVEF less than or equal to 0.30 (26%) than in those with LVEF greater than 0.30 (46%) (p less than 0.05). Thus, circadian variation of VPC frequency is absent in patients with severe LV dysfunction.", 
    "67": "The status of Ca(2+)-channels and adrenoceptors in the hind leg skeletal muscle was examined in rats 8 weeks after inducing diabetes by an intravenous injection of streptozotocin (65 mg/kg). Scatchard plot analysis of the data on specific binding of 3H-nitrendipine with crude membranes from diabetic muscle revealed an increase in the density of Ca(2+)-channels without any significant change in their affinity for the ligand. An increase in the density of beta-adrenoceptors without any alteration in their affinity, as measured by 3H-dihydroalprenolol binding, was also evident in the diabetic muscle. The observed increase in the number of Ca2+ channels or beta-adrenoceptors seems specific since no change in the alpha-adrenoceptor density or affinity, as measured by 3H-prazosin binding, was seen in the diabetic membranes. These results support the view that higher activities of Ca2+ transport systems or regulatory mechanisms may be associated with hyperfunction of the diabetic skeletal muscle.",

The dissociation constants for the beta-adrenergic receptor were measured in membrane preparations of rat heart and lung. In membranes from the heart (which contain mostly beta 1-adrenergic receptors), the affinities of the derivatives and parent compounds were similar. By contrast, in membranes from the lung (which contain mostly beta 2-adrenergic receptors), the derivatives were more potent than the parent compounds. Thus, the cardioselectivities of the p-aminobenzyl analogues 8a and 8b were about one-sixth those of the respective parents.",

    "76": "The efficacy and safety of bepridil hydrochloride (HCl) and propranolol HCl monotherapy were investigated in a double-blind, parallel-group crossover study in 75 patients with chronic stable angina pectoris. For the first double-blind segment, both drugs reduced the frequency of weekly anginal attacks and nitroglycerin consumption. On exercise testing, bepridil was significantly more effective in terms of increasing time to angina and total work. Heart rate and ST-segment depression decreased to a greater degree with propranolol than bepridil. Bepridil produced a greater increase in QT interval than propranolol; corrected QT (QTc) interval was increased by bepridil and slightly decreased by propranolol. The incidence of adverse effects was roughly comparable for the two active drugs and higher than that for placebo during washout periods. It was concluded that bepridil, at a mean maintenance dosage of 324 mg/day, was at least as effective as propranolol in improving exercise tolerance--specifically time to angina and total work--and that tolerability of the 2 drugs was comparable. In another study, the efficacy and safety of bepridil combined with propranolol were compared with that of placebo plus propranolol in 56 patients who had not been well controlled on propranolol alone. The addition of bepridil significantly reduced the frequency of anginal attacks and weekly nitroglycerin consumption compared with baseline. The combination of propranolol and bepridil also produced significant improvements in total exercise time, time to angina, and total work compared with baseline. The QTc interval increased significantly from baseline in the bepridil combination group and decreased significantly in the propranolol plus placebo group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "77": "Abnormalities of left ventricular (LV) systolic performance develop during exercise in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) as a result of ischemia-induced regional wall motion abnormalities. Like patients with hypertension and those with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, patients with CAD display abnormalities of LV diastolic performance under basal conditions in the absence of ischemia. The purpose of these studies was to compare the effects of bepridil versus those of propranolol or diltiazem in patients with exertional angina pectoris. LV systolic and diastolic performance were assessed at rest and during peak upright bicycle exercise by first-pass radionuclide ventriculography. Compared with propranolol, bepridil increased exercise capacity, cardiac output, and stroke volume and decreased systemic vascular resistance. Compared with diltiazem, bepridil increased exercise capacity, peak filling rate, and early diastolic filling fraction and decreased systemic vascular resistance, heart rate, time to peak filling rate, and atrial filling volume. Bepridil therapy is associated with improved exercise capacity and decreased anginal frequency and nitroglycerin consumption. In addition, its use is accompanied by favorable changes in LV systolic and diastolic function at rest and during exercise. These changes are consistent with benefits resulting from resolution of myocardial ischemia as well as from positive lusitropic effects of bepridil on the ventricular myocardium.", 
    "78": "The effects of 5-HT1A receptor agonists 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), buspirone and ipsapirone on wheel-running activity in hamsters were investigated in comparison with those of GABAA receptor agonist muscimol and benzodiazepine triazolam. Intraperitoneal administration of 8-OH-DPAT, buspirone, ipsapirone, muscimol and triazolam at circadian time (CT) 8 (CT 12; onset of activity) induced a significant phase advance of wheel-running activity under constant light conditions. However, administration of these drugs at other CT points did not induce phase changes. The administration of trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP), a 5-HT1B receptor agonist, at CT8 produced a small phase advance. The phase advance induced by 8-OH-DPAT was blocked by pretreatment with (-)-pindolol, a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist. In addition, 8-OH-DPAT, buspirone and SM3997 accelerated the rate of re-entrainment to an 8-h phase advance in the light-dark cycle. These observations suggest that 5-HT1A receptors in the brain participate in the regulation of the circadian rhythm of wheel-running activity in hamsters.", 
    "79": "Bilateral injection into the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) of the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor antagonist yohimbine produced a dose-related (10-500 pmol) increase in arterial pressure, with a maximal response of approximately 60 mm Hg. Idazoxan, also an alpha 2-adrenergic receptor antagonist, produced a similar response although idazoxan was less potent than yohimbine. The pressor response elicited by these drugs was attenuated by stimulation of adrenergic receptors in the NTS by local administration of either clonidine or tyramine. Doses of yohimbine (200 pmol) or idazoxan (5 nmol) that maximally increased arterial pressure also completely inhibited the depressor and bradycardic responses to electrical stimulation of the aortic depressor nerve. These results indicate that tonic stimulation of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors in the NTS is required for baroreceptor reflex function.", 
    "80": "A newborn child of a diabetic mother is described, who developed neonatal hypertension after birth. Clinical signs were not specific and the diagnosis would have been missed if blood pressure had not been measured. The cause of the neonatal hypertension appeared to be a thrombus in the left renal artery, probably originating from the ductus arteriosus Botalli. Control of the neonatal hypertension according to a stepwise treatment regime was very difficult. Based on our experience and on study of the literature it is advised to start treatment in the acute stage with nifedipine orally or with sodium nitroprusside intravenously.", 
    "81": "Cardiovascular effect of norepinephrine (NE) in the habenular nucleus (Hb) and the underlying mechanism were investigated in urethane-anesthetized rats. NE microinjection into Hb produced a dose-dependent increase in mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate, an effect that could be attenuated by the pretreatment in Hb with alpha-receptor blocker phentolamine, but not by the pretreatment with beta-receptor blocker propranolol or physiological saline. Microinjection of kainic acid into Hb gave rise to a marked increase in mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate, but microinjection of lidocaine did not elicit significant cardiovascular effect. The above results suggest that NE in Hb plays an important role in cardiovascular control as a result of Hb excitation through activation of alpha-receptor.",

In order to prevent this severe complication labetalol, an alpha and beta blocking drug, was infused following the closure of the dura mater in half of the patients studied. For two hours after surgery blood pressure values in treated patients were constantly lower than those recorded in the control group, thus confirming the efficacy of this drug in preventing the cardiocirculatory effects of increased adrenalin and noradrenalin.", 
    "83": "Isotonic contractions of the rabbit jejunal artery were evoked by perivascular nerve stimulation with trains of 10 or 100 stimuli at 2 Hz or 10 Hz. Short trains of stimuli elicited contractions that were totally resistant to alpha-adrenoceptor blockade (0.1 mumol/l prazosin) but blocked by alpha,beta-methylene ATP (1 mumol/l). A substantial noradrenergic component of contraction comprising about 50% of the total could be evoked by adjusting the stimulation parameters (increasing the frequency and/or number of stimuli in a train). The noradrenergic and the purinergic components are derived from sympathetic nerves as both were blocked by TTX and the adrenergic neurone blocker guanethidine (3 mumol/l). It is concluded that the contraction of the rabbit jejunal artery to short trains of stimuli is predominantly purinergic, a noradrenergic component only being revealed at higher frequencies of stimulation or during longer trains of stimuli. The purinergic component of contraction is derived from sympathetic nerves and not from a separate population of purinergic nerves.",

The mean follow-up time of their glaucoma was 10.7 years, range 2 to 30 years. A mild burning feeling (in 50% in all treatment groups) and redness of the eyes (in 42% treated with timolol alone and in 50% with timolol combined with dipivephrine, pilocarpine or both) were the main complaints, followed by a slight reduction of vision (in 17% in the timolol group and in 56% with combined treatment) and mild watering of the eyes (in 42% of the timolol and in 31% of the combined treatment groups). Twenty-three percent of the patients did not have any side effects from their topical medication. Patients who admitted defaulting their topical treatment once a month amounted to 43% and once a week to 17%. Patients who admitted to never having missed a drop amounted to 40% of the sample; forgetfulness and haste were the main reasons for not applying the drops.",

    "88": "The role that the sympathetic nervous system plays in modulating physiological processes in the gastrointestinal tract is becoming clearer. It is now known that motor, secretomotor and vasomotor activity are all modulated independently by the system. Adrenoreceptor stimulation appears to reduce intestinal contraction (except at sphincters), both via alpha-receptors which inhibit neurotransmitter release and also by a direct beta-receptor mediated action on smooth muscle. There is also evidence for tonic activity in the beta-adrenergic pathway, since beta-antagonists tend to increase contraction pressures. In animals alpha-receptor-mediated pathways modulate fluid and electrolyte absorption, and alpha-adrenergic agonists enhance net absorption and reduce net secretion. In man there is also evidence for a beta-adrenergic pathway which controls secretomotor function. Carbohydrate absorption appears to be dependent on activity in a beta-adrenergic pathway, although this may be an indirect effect of changes in motor function. The time course of changes of both secretomotor and motor activity, induced by modulating sympathetic or adrenergic input, differ from the vascular changes indicating that the effects occur independently of each other. The gastrointestinal response to stressors is mediated, in part at least, by the sympathetic nervous system. Differences between individuals are likely to prove important. Since the sympathetic nervous system regulates gastrointestinal function both in the basal state and under stressful conditions, it will have effects on pathophysiological responses. Modification of such responses is likely to ameliorate symptoms, as has already been found for alpha-2-adrenergic agonists which have an antidiarrhoeal action.",

In acute (single dose) oral and parenteral studies a low order of toxicity was observed. Clinical signs observed at the higher doses included salivation, prostration, tremors, and convulsions. In multidose oral studies dilevalol produced an increase in mean absolute and/or relative heart weights observed as early as 1 month in the high-dose (300 mg/kg) rats and at all dose levels (35, 90, 220 mg/kg) in rats treated for 1 year. There were no microscopic changes that could be associated with the change in heart weight. Intraalveolar macrophages were observed in the lung tissue of rats treated for 3 months or 1 year with an increase in relative lung weights noted in the high-dose (220 mg/kg) group treated for 1 year. In a 2-year rat study, no evidence of oncogenicity was observed. On the basis of these studies, dilevalol has a low order of toxicity and lacks oncogenic potential in the rat.", 
    "91": "A double-blind randomized study comparing the effects of 1 year's treatment with atenolol (A) 50 mg or hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg plus amiloride 5 mg (Moduretic (M)) on the lipid profile was performed in 100 hypertensive men (mean age 47, range 22-64 years). After 4 weeks' wash-out and 4 weeks on placebo therapy subjects were randomized to either A or M therapy and followed up every third month for 1 year. If the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was greater than or equal to 95 mmHg at a subsequent visit, the doses were doubled (n = 17 for A and n = 12 for M) and, if DBP was still greater than or equal to 95 mmHg on double dose, nifedipine 20 mg b.d. was added (n = 15 for A and n = 27 for M, p less than 0.05). The lowering of heart rate (p = 0.0001) and DBP (p = 0.005) was more pronounced with A after 1 year. During that time no significant treatment differences were noted for total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol or apoproteins A and B. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol decreased from a mean of 1.19 (+/- 0.36) mmol l-1 to 1.13 (+/- 0.35) with A, and increased from 1.14 (+/- 0.30) mmol l-1 to 1.22 (+/- 0.28) with M, and this treatment difference was significant (p = 0.0002). The triglycerides increased from 2.0 (+/- 1.2) mmol l-1 to 2.3 (+/- 1.6) in the A group and did not change with M treatment (p = 0.02) for treatment difference). In view of similar effects on cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and apoproteins, the prognostic importance of the observed treatment differences on HDL cholesterol and triglycerides remains to be established."
