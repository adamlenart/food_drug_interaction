    "1": "Twelve healthy male volunteers participated in three weekly experimental sessions. Subjects were allocated to treatments and sessions on a double-blind basis. In each session either BIS 5 mg (BIS5), or BIS 10 mg (BIS10), or placebo was administered orally, and noradrenaline acid tartrate (0.1-33.33 ng min (-1) followed by phenylephrine hydrochloride (0.033-10 microg min(-l)) was infused into the dorsal hand vein. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were also measured.", 
    "2": "Both noradrenaline and phenylephrine produced dose-dependent venoconstriction: the geometric mean ED50 for noradrenaline was 3.21 ng min(-1) and for phenylephrine 135.04 ng min(-1); the potency ratio (noradrenaline/phenylephrine) was 42. Both BIS5 and BIS10 significantly decreased the venoconstriction to noradrenaline (ANOVA; P<0.005), and to phenylephrine (ANOVA; P<0.001). The antagonism of the venoconstrictor responses was also reflected in a significant increase in logED50 values for both noradrenaline (ANOVA; P<0.005), and phenylephrine (ANOVA; P<0.0025) in the presence of both doses of BIS. Both doses of BIS significantly decreased heart rate (ANOVA; P<0.0001), and systolic blood pressure (ANOVA; P<0.0025).",

    "4": "Evidence of efficacy and safety of beta-blockers after thrombolysis for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is equivocal. Newer beta-blockers such as carvedilol have not been tested in this setting.", 
    "5": "This study investigated the effects of acute (intravenous) and long-term (6 months, oral) treatment with carvedilol versus placebo in 151 consecutive patients with AMI. Exercise ECG, ambulatory monitoring, and two-dimensional echocardiography were performed before hospital discharge and at 3 and 6 months. All patients were followed up and cardiovascular events recorded. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare time from randomization with the occurrence of a cardiovascular event, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were calculated. Carvedilol was found to be safe, and it significantly reduced cardiac events compared with placebo (18 on carvedilol and 31 on placebo, P < .02). Fifty-four patients had heart failure at study entry; 34 received carvedilol. There were no adverse effects of carvedilol therapy and no excess events in this subgroup. Carvedilol produced significant reductions in heart rate (P < .0001), blood pressure (P < .005) at rest, and rate-pressure product at peak exercise (P < .003), but exercise capacity was unchanged. Left ventricular ejection fraction was not altered significantly by carvedilol, but stroke volume was higher at pre-hospital discharge examination (63 versus 53 mL; P < .01). Diastolic filling of the left ventricle (E/A ratio) was also improved (1.2 versus 0.9; P < .001). In a subgroup with left ventricular ejection fraction < 45% (n = 49 patients; 24 on carvedilol and 25 on placebo), carvedilol showed attenuation of remodeling.",

    "7": "The treatment of hypertension mainly with diuretics and beta blockers reduces cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, largely due to a decreased incidence of stroke, whereas the beneficial effects of antihypertensive therapy on the occurrence of coronary events have been less than expected from epidemiological studies. Furthermore, treated hypertensive patients still have a higher cardiovascular complication rate, compared with matched normotensives. This is particularly evident in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), a major independent risk indicator for cardiovascular disease. In addition to elevating blood pressure, angiotensin II (A-II) exerts an important influence on cardiac structure and function, stimulating cell proliferation and growth. Thus, to further reduce morbidity and mortality when treating hypertensive patients, it may be important to effectively block the effects of A-II. This can be achieved directly at the A-II receptor level by losartan, the first of a new class of antihypertensive agents. It therefore seems pertinent to investigate whether selective A-II receptor blockade with losartan not only lowers blood pressure but also reduces LVH more effectively than current therapy, and thus improves prognosis. The Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction (LIFE) in Hypertension study is a double-blind, prospective, parallel group study designed to compare the effects of losartan with those of the beta-blocker atenolol on the reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in approximately 8,300 hypertensive patients (initial sitting diastolic blood pressure 95 to 115 mm Hg or systolic blood pressure 160 to 200 mm Hg) with electrocardiographically documented LVH. The study, which will continue for at least 4 years and until 1,040 patients experience one primary endpoint, has been designed with a statistical power that will detect a difference of at least 15% between groups in the incidence of combined cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. It is also the first prospective study with adequate power to link reversal of LVH to reduction in major cardiovascular events. The rationale of the study, which will involve more than 800 clinical centers in Scandinavia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, is discussed, and the major features of its design and general organization are described. On April 30, 1997, when inclusion was stopped, 9,218 patients had been randomized.", 
    "8": "A new method was developed to automatically measure the thickness of a single ventricular myocyte of guinea-pig heart. A fine marker was attached on the cell's upper surface and changes in its vertical position were measured by focusing it under the microscope. When the osmolarity of the bath solution was varied, the cell thickness reached a new steady level without any obvious regulatory volume change within the period of observation up to 15 min. The cell thickness was 7.8 +/- 0.2 microns (n = 94) in the control Tyrode solution and was varied to 130.4 +/- 3.1% (n = 10), 119.1 +/- 1.1% (n = 50), 87.2 +/- 1.9% (n = 9), and 75.6 +/- 3.2% (n = 5) of control at 50, 70, 130, and 200% osmolarity, respectively. The application of a Cl- channel blocker, 500 microM anthracene-9-carboxylic acid (9AC) did not modify these osmotic volume changes. We discovered that the application of isoprenaline induced a regulatory volume decrease (RVD) in cells inflated by hypotonic solutions. This isoprenaline-induced RVD was inhibited by antagonizing beta-adrenergic stimulation with acetylcholine. The isoprenaline-induced RVD was mimicked by the external application of 8-bromoadenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate. The RVD was inhibited by blocking the cAMP-dependent Cl- channel (ICl, rAMP) with 9AC but was insensitive to 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-dissulphonate (DIDS). Taken together these data suggest an involvement of ICl, cAMP activation in the RVD. Whole cell voltage clamp experiments revealed activation of ICl, cAMP by isoprenaline under the comparable conditions. The cardiac cell volume may be regulated by the autonomic nervous activity.", 
    "9": "Our objective was to compare cardiovascular event rates in patients with mild or moderate hypertension who received nifedipine with active drug controls. We performed a MEDLARS search using the MeSH heading \"hypertension\" and the text word \"nifedipine\" to identify all articles that were published between 1966 and August 1995 in English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish languages and that involved human subjects. The computerized search was supplemented by a manual search of article bibliographies. Review of 1880 citations revealed 98 randomized controlled clinical trials that met protocol criteria. Articles were extracted independently by two doctors who were blinded for author, institution, and treatment regimen, using a structured, pretested extraction form. Differences of opinion were resolved by consensus. Fourteen events occurred in 5198 exposures (0.27%) to nifedipine and 24 events in 5402 exposures (0.44%) to other active drug controls. Unadjusted odds ratios for nifedipine versus controls were 0.49 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22-1.09) for definitive events (death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke, revascularization procedure) and 0.61 (95% CI, 0.31-1.17) for all events (definitive plus increased angina). The odds ratio for nifedipine monotherapy (sustained- or extended-release in 91% of exposures) was nonsignificantly higher for definitive and all events (odds ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 0.49-4.03 and odds ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.59-3.32, respectively). The odds ratio for nifedipine in combination with another drug was significantly lower for definitive and all events (odds ratio, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.01-0.66 and odds ratio, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.03-0.65, respectively). Differences in odds ratio for nifedipine monotherapy and combined therapy were statistically significant (P=.02 for definitive events and P=.001 for all events). Results support the safety of sustained- and extended-release nifedipine in the treatment of mild or moderate hypertension when it is used in combination with other drugs.",

The fill volume of each bottle and the amount of each medicine that was wasted upon dispensing also were determined. Additionally, 60 pharmacies in the United States were randomly chosen to determine the average cost of each preparation studied. Based on all data obtained, an average daily cost of each medicine was calculated.",

Brimonidine-treated subjects showed an overall mean peak reduction in intraocular pressure (IOP) of 6.5 mm Hg; timolol-treated subjects had a mean peak reduction in IOP of 6.1 mm Hg. Brimonidine lowered mean peak IOP significantly more than timolol at week 2 and month 3 (P < .03); no significant difference was observed between the groups for this variable at other visits throughout the 1-year course of the study. No evidence of tachyphylaxis was seen in either group. Allergy was seen in 9% of subjects treated with brimonidine. Dry mouth was more common in the brimonidine-treated group than in the timolol-treated group (33.0% vs 19.4%), but complaints of burning and stinging were more common in the timolol-treated group (41.9%) than in the brimonidine-treated patients (28.1%).

Ten of these 12 patients also developed severe pulmonary edema. Seven of the twelve were treated with beta blockers; 3 of whom suffered cardiac arrest. We propose a common mechanism: the vasoconstrictors caused systemic hypertension, increased left ventricular afterload, decreased left ventricular compliance, and decreased cardiac output. In those patients treated with beta blockers, decreased contractility and inability to increase heart rate further compromised cardiopulmonary function.",

The kinetics of drug release were analysed by applying the empirical exponential equation and by the calculation of the approximate contribution of the diffusional and relaxational mechanism to the anomalous release process by fitting the data to the coupled Fickian/Case II equation. The influence of glutaraldehyde cross-linking agent concentration, the poly(acrylic acid) content, the pH of the release medium and the particle size of the beads on the drug release kinetics were evaluated and discussed.",

    "21": "Although it is generally accepted that adrenergic influences contribute to arrhythmias during myocardial ischemia, it is still a matter of debate whether these arrhythmogenic effects are mediated via alpha- or beta-adrenergic receptors and which particular receptor subtype is involved. Controversial results may be due to ancillary properties of the adrenergic receptor antagonists used to resolve this question. Therefore, we compared the influence of various, structurally different alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents on the occurrence of ventricular fibrillation in rat isolated hearts. Regional ischemia was induced by ligature of the left coronary artery and ECG was monitored over 30 min of coronary occlusion. Myocardial ischemia precipitated ventricular fibrillation in a well reproducible manner with an incidence of about 80% in control hearts. Racemic propranolol (0.1-1 micromol/l) concentration-relatedly reduced the incidence of ventricular fibrillation from 71% in controls to 10%, whereas the beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents atenolol (10 micromol/l) and timolol (1 micromol/l) did not influence the occurrence of arrhythmias. Moreover, both stereoisomers of propranolol were equipotent in suppressing ischemia-induced ventricular fibrillation, indicating an action of propranolol independent of its beta-adrenoceptor blocking properties. Unselective antagonism of alpha-adrenoceptors by phentolamine decreased the incidence of ventricular fibrillation from 90% to 58% at 0.1 micromol/l and totally suppressed ventricular fibrillation at 1 micromol/l. The alpha1-selective antagonists prazosin and HEAT concentration-dependently (0.1-10 micromol/l) reduced the incidence of ventricular fibrillation from 83% to 0%, whereas the alpha2-selective antagonist RX 821002 revealed no antiarrhythmic effect. Furthermore, subtype specific antagonism of alpha1A-adrenoceptors by WB 4101 clearly reduced the occurrence of ventricular fibrillation in a concentration-dependent manner (0.01-1 micromol/l) from 66% to 17%. Conversely, CEC, known to block the alpha1B-adrenoceptor subtype, possessed no antifibrillatory effect. In conclusion, the contribution of catecholamines to ischemia-induced arrhythmias in rat isolated heart is primarily mediated via WB 4101-sensitive alpha1-adrenergic activation. Beta- and alpha2-adrenoceptor blockade did not affect ventricular fibrillation in this model. The antifibrillatory action of propranolol was rather due to ancillary properties of this agent.", 
    "22": "The novel selective imidazoline radioligand [3H]2-(2-benzofuranyl)-2-imidazoline (2-BFI) was used to characterize and assess further the nature of I2-imidazoline receptors in rat brain and liver. In the cerebral cortex, 2-BFI displayed high affinity (Ki = 9.8 nM) for a single class of [3H]2-BFI binding sites. Other imidazoline/guanidine compounds (e.g. aganodine, cirazoline and idazoxan) displayed biphasic competition curves, indicating the existence of high (KiH = 2.9-78 nM; R(H) = 61-83%) and low (KiL = 4.7-158 microM) affinity sites. The pharmacological profile for [3H]2-BFI binding (aganodine > cirazoline > 2-BFI > clonidine > amiloride > efaroxan) was typical of that for I2-sites. This profile was almost identical to that obtained against [3H]idazoxan (correlation between pKi values, r = 0.97) which indicated that the sites characterized with [3H]2-BFI in brain corresponded to I2-imidazoline receptors. The low affinity of amiloride against [3H]2-BFI (Ki = 900 nM) further indicated that these brain I2-sites belong to the I2B-subtype. [3H]2-BFI binding sites (Bmax = 72 fmol/mg protein) in brain were differentially modulated by treatment (7 days) with cirazoline (up-regulation: 25%) and the MAO inhibitor phenelzine (down-regulation: 31%), indicating that these I2-sites are regulated in vivo, as is the case for those labelled by [3H]idazoxan. Chronic treatment with 2-phenylethylamine, a phenelzine metabolite and endogenous amine, did not alter the density of brain of I2-imidazoline receptors labelled by [3H]idazoxan. Preincubation of liver membranes with the MAO inhibitor clorgyline (10(-7) M) abolished the binding of [3H]Ro 41-1049 (N-(2-aminoethyl)-5-(m-fluorophenyl)-4-thiazole carboxamide) to MAO-A, but it did not alter the binding of [3H]Ro 19-6327 (N-(2-aminoethyl)-5-chloro-2-pyridine carboxamide) to MAO-B or that of [3H]2-BFI to I2-sites. At 10(-4) M it also abolished MAO-B sites, but a substantial proportion of I2-sites (40%) remained intact. Preincubation of liver membranes at 60 degrees C also abolished MAO-A/B sites, whereas still 22% of I2-sites remained. The results indicate that [3H]2-BFI is a good tool for the identification of I2-imidazoline receptors and suggest further that certain I2-sites and MAO are different proteins.", 
    "23": "A number of clinical observations and first in vitro findings indicate that chronic cerebral ischemia influences immunologic status, such as the proliferative response of T lymphocytes. The purpose of the present report was to assess (1) whether changes of immune function are likewise detectable in patients with progressive subcortical vascular encephalopathy (SVE) by investigating the [Ca2+]i homeostasis of lymphocytes and (2) whether differences exist in calcium regulation between lymphocytes from SVE patients and from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. This is of great interest, since specific changes have been reported recently in AD patients.", 
    "24": "[Ca2+]i was recorded in 26 patients with SVE, 26 age-matched nondemented control subjects, and 26 age-matched patients with AD. Basal [Ca2+]i and [Ca2+]i after lymphocyte activation with the mitogen phytohemagglutinin (PHA) were measured with the fura 2 method. In addition, modulation of the Ca2+ signaling by the peptide beta-amyloid and the potassium channel blocker tetraethylammonium was studied.", 
    "25": "Basal [Ca2+]i was not different between patients and control subjects. After stimulation with PHA, however, a significant reduction of the Ca2+ response could be observed in lymphocytes of SVE patients compared with control subjects and with AD patients, providing evidence that the Ca2+ homeostasis of lymphocytes is impaired in SVE. The effect of the peptide beta-amyloid, the major constituent of senile plaques in AD brain, on Ca2+ signaling was similar in SVE patients and nondemented control subjects but typically reduced in cells of AD patients. Potassium channels were not involved in the impaired Ca2+ response of SVE lymphocytes after cell activation.", 
    "26": "[Ca2+]i is not only one of the most important second messengers in signal transduction of many cells but also an early event in the signal cascade of cell proliferation as a reaction to antigen recognition. This mechanism seems to be impaired in SVE. These findings may result in new insights regarding the pathogenesis of this disease and the possible involvement of inflammatory or immunologic disturbances.", 
    "27": "The aim of this study was to explore the cellular mechanisms underlying the impaired contractile response to beta adrenoceptor stimulation in diabetic hearts. Chronic diabetes was induced in rats by a streptozotocin injection. Four to six weeks later, papillary muscles isolated from diabetic hearts exhibited marked reductions in the positive inotropic responses to isoproterenol, norepinephrine and epinephrine. The contractile responses to forskolin, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and dibutylic cyclic AMP were also prominently depressed. The density of beta adrenoceptors was decreased by 50%. However, competitive binding studies with isoproterenol showed no difference in the proportion of beta adrenoceptors with high-affinity binding between control and diabetic myocardial membranes. Determination of the levels of the alpha subunits of Gs and Gi by immunoblotting revealed markedly less expression of Gi in diabetic myocardium. The abilities of isoproterenol, sodium fluoride, 5'-guanylyl imidodiphosphate and forskolin to stimulate adenylate cyclase were preserved well in membranes prepared from diabetic hearts. Nevertheless, neither stimulation of beta adrenoceptors with isoproterenol nor direct activation of adenylate cyclase with forskolin evoked any significant increase in the degree of phosphorylation of phospholamban in diabetic hearts. These results suggest that impaired contractile response to beta adrenoceptor stimulation is not caused by an alteration in the beta adrenoceptors-Gs-adenylate cyclase system, but is possibly caused by an alteration in cellular function beyond the step of adenylate cyclase activation.", 
    "28": "The purpose of our study was to investigate whether loss of myocardial contraction immediately after coronary occlusion was nonuniform, and if pretreatment with carvedilol, a vasodilating nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, could retard loss of contraction after coronary artery occlusion. Feline hearts were subjected to acute regional ischemia by total occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. The animals were either treated with vehicle (control group) or with carvedilol 1 mg/kg i.v. before left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion (n = 9 in each group). Regional contraction in the left anterior descending coronary artery perfused region of the heart was studied by cross-oriented sonomicrometry. In control animals, circumferential (subepicardial) contraction ceased after 10 sec, whereas longitudinal (subendocardial) contraction ceased immediately after left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion. Loss of contraction in animals treated with carvedilol was significantly slower compared to controls. Circumferential contraction ceased between 30 sec and 1 min, whereas longitudinal contraction ceased after 20 sec. In conclusion, loss of contraction during the first seconds after coronary occlusion was nonuniform, with most rapid dysfunction in the subendocardium. Pretreatment with carvedilol retarded loss of contraction in both axes.", 
    "29": "The purpose of this study was to elucidate the mechanism by which acetylcholine (ACh) promotes prostacyclin (PGI2) production in cultured coronary endothelial cells (CEC) of the rabbit heart. ACh-induced production of PGI2, measured as immunoreactive 6-keto-PGF1alpha, was enhanced by increasing the extracellular calcium (Ca++) concentration and reduced by Ca++ depletion. The receptor-operated Ca++ channel blocker SK&F96365, but not the voltage-dependent Ca++ channel blockers verapamil or nifedipine, attenuated ACh-induced 6-keto-PGF1alpha production and the associated rise in cytosolic Ca++. Thapsigargin, which depleted Ca++ accumulation from the intracellular Ca++ store, did not prevent the ACh-induced rise in cytosolic Ca++. In the absence of extracellular Ca++, ACh and ATP increased cytosolic Ca++ but did not alter 6-keto-PGF1alpha production. In permeabilized CEC, guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP-gamma-S) but not ACh enhanced 6-keto-PGF1alpha synthesis. ACh increased 6-keto-PGF1alpha production in the presence of GTP-gamma-S. These effects of GTP-gamma-S were attenuated by guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiotriphosphate). In the absence of extracellular Ca++, ACh or ATP increased cytosolic Ca++ in cells permeabilized with beta-escin and loaded with GTP-gamma-S; this effect was attenuated by guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiotriphosphate). The effect of ATP but not ACh to mobilize intracellular Ca++ or increase 6-keto-PGF1alpha was inhibited by pertussis toxin. The phospholipase C inhibitor D609, which attenuated ACh- and ATP-induced mobilization of intracellular Ca++, did not alter 6-keto-PGF1alpha production. The NO synthase inhibitor N-monomethyl-arginine also failed to alter ACh-induced 6-keto-PGF1alpha synthesis. These data suggest that, in CEC of the rabbit heart, ACh stimulates prostacyclin production via a pertussis toxin-insensitive G protein and by increasing the influx of extracellular Ca++ through a G protein-independent receptor-operated Ca++ channel.", 
    "30": "1. The effects of glibenclamide (GLB), a blocker of ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels, on diaphragmatic microcirculation in male Sprague-Dawley rats were assessed under basal conditions and after beta 2-adrenoceptor-agonist stimulation. In addition, forskolin was used to bypass beta-adrenoceptors and GTP-binding proteins (G-protein) to explore the possible mechanism of GLB effects. For comparison, the relationships between KATP channel activity and cyclic GMP-mediated vasodilator responses to acetylcholine (ACh) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) were also assessed. 2. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were anaesthetized with urethane and mechanically ventilated. The left hemi-diaphragm of each rat was prepared and microvascular blood flow (QLDF) was recorded with laser-Doppler flowmetry during continuous superfusion with bicarbonate-buffered, prewarmed Ringer solution. The drugs were topically applied to the surface of the hemi-diaphragm. 3. Salbutamol (0.32-32 microM), terbutaline (0.32 microM-0.32 microM) and forskolin (0.32-10 microM) each elicited a concentration-dependent increase in QLDF. 4. Baseline microvascular blood flow was unaffected by a 30 min suffusion of 1 microM GLB (295 +/- 51 mV vs 325 +/- 62 mV. P = 0.738). 5. The vasodilator response elicited by salbutamol (0.32 microM, 1 microM and 3.2 microM and 10 microM), was significantly attenuated by a 30 min superfusion with 1 microM GLB; this salbutamol-induced vasodilatation was mediated via an interaction with beta-adrenoceptor receptors, as in other experiments it was greatly inhibited by 30-min superfusion with propranolol (10 microM). 6. Similarly, following 30-min superfusion with GLB (1 microM), the terbutaline (1 microM, 3.2 microM and 10 microM)-induced vasodilator response was almost abolished and the vasodilator responses induced by incremental concentrations of forskolin (0.32 microM, 1 microM and 3.2 microM) were also significantly attenuated. 7. Cromakalim (1.5 microM, 3 microM and 3.2 microM) produced an increase of QLDF in a dose-dependent manner, which was virtually abolished by GLB (1 microM). In contrast, the vasodilator responses induced by acetylcholine (32 microM, 0.1 mM, and 0.32 mM) or sodium nitroprusside (3.2 microM, 10 microM and 20 microM) were independent of GLB (1 microM). 8. In conclusion, KATP channels may be functional, but tonically inactive in the resting diaphragmatic microcirculation and the vasodilator effect of beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists may be partly mediated by KATP channels; the activation of KATP channels may involve the accumulation of cyclic AMP in vascular smooth muscle cells.", 
    "31": "1. This study was designed to investigate the mechanism of the relaxation induced by vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) in medial strips of the porcine coronary artery, by determining the effect on the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), the [Ca2+]i-force relation and the involvement of G-protein. 2. Front-surface fluorometry of fura-2 revealed that U46619, a thromboxane A2 analogue, and the high K(+)-depolarization induced increases in both the [Ca2+]i and force of the medial strips. At a steady state of contraction, the extent of an increase in [Ca2+]i induced by 100 nM U46619 was similar to that induced by 30 mM K(+)-depolarization. VIP concentration-dependently (1 nM-1 microM) induced transient decreases in both the [Ca2+]i and force of the medial strips precontracted with 100 nM U46619. The decreases in the [Ca2+]i and force induced by VIP during the contraction with U46619 were much greater than those with 30 mM K(+)-depolarization. 3. The VIP-induced decreases in the [Ca2+]i and force were attenuated by K+ channel blockers such as tetrabutylammonium (TBA: non-selective K+ channel blocker), charybdotoxin (large conductance Ca(2+)-activated K+ channel blocker), and 4-aminopyridine (4-AP: voltage-dependent K+ channel blocker). However, neither glibenclamide (ATP-sensitive K+ channel blocker) nor apamin (small conductance Ca(2+)-activated K+ channel blocker) had any significant inhibitory effect. 4. In the 30 mM K(+)-depolarized strips, pretreatment with thapsigargin, a specific Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor of the Ca2+ store sites, completely abolished the VIP-induced decrease in [Ca2+]i, but partially attenuated the VIP-induced decrease in force. 5. VIP shifted the [Ca2+]i-force relation of the U46619-induced contractions to the right in a concentration-dependent manner. In the alpha-toxin-permeabilized strips, VIP decreased the force development at a constant [Ca2+]i level (pCa = 6.5) in a GTP-dependent manner, which was antagonized by guanosine-5'-O-(beta-thiodiphosphate) (GDP beta S). 6. We thus conclude that VIP relaxes the coronary artery via three mechanisms: (1) a decrease in [Ca2+]i by inhibiting the Ca2+ influx presumably through the membrane hyperpolarization mediated by the activation of the large conductance Ca(2+)-activated (charybdotoxin-sensitive) K+ channels and voltage-dependent (4-AP-sensitive) K+ channels; (2) a decrease in [Ca2+]i by sequestrating cytosolic Ca2+ into thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ store sites; and (3) a decrease in the Ca(2+)-sensitivity of the contractile apparatus through the activation of G-protein.",

    "33": "A 37-year-old white man took 11.2 g of sotalol hydrochloride tablets in a suicide attempt. The first serum d,l-sotalol concentration 3 hours after taking the first tablet was 20.6 mg/L and the last measured concentration 59 hours later was 1.8 mg/L. Logarithmic transformation of the concentration data indicated two separate monoexponential phases in the elimination curve, with half-lives of 30.1 and 11.6 hours.", 
    "34": "The shorter serum half-life in the later phase is comparable with that in four previously reported sotalol intoxications and within the normal range. The elimination rate increased in a temporal manner with an increase in systolic blood pressure about 30 hours after the patient was admitted. Since the sotalol elimination rate depends principally on renal function, we believe the initially slow elimination is due to a temporary reduction of the renal function caused by the systolic hypotension.", 
    "35": "An initial phase of slow sotalol elimination may occur after severe overdoses. In our patient this was probably due to hypotension. Thus, blood pressure should be monitored carefully.", 
    "36": "It has been reported previously that the addition of isoproterenol or forskolin stimulates the expression of the angiotensinogen (ANG) gene in opossum kidney (OK) 27 cells, an OK cell line with a fusion gene containing the 5'-flanking regulatory sequence of the rat ANG gene fused with a human growth hormone (hGH) gene as a reporter, pOGH (ANG N-1498/+18), permanently integrated into their genomes. To investigate whether the effect of isoproterenol or forskolin on the expression of the ANG gene is mediated via the nuclear 43-kD cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB), OK 27 cells were transiently transfected with an expression plasmid containing the cDNA for the 43-kD CREB (pRSV/CREB). The level of expression of the pOGH (ANG N-1498/+18) in OK 27 cells was estimated by the amount of immunoreactive hGH secreted into the culture medium. Transfection of pRSV/CREB alone stimulated the expression of pOGH (ANG N-1498/+18). The addition of isoproterenol or forskolin further enhanced the stimulatory effect of pRSV/ CREB on the expression of pOGH (ANG N-1498/+18). The enhancing effect of isoproterenol was inhibited by the presence of propranolol (an inhibitor of beta-adrenoceptors) and (R)-p-adenosine 3'5'-cyclic monophospho-orthioate (Rp)-cAMP (an inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A I and II). Transfection of pRSV/CREB had no effect on the expression of thymidine kinase growth hormone in OK 13 cells, an OK cell line with a fusion gene containing the promoter/enhancer DNA sequence of the viral thymidine-kinase gene fused with an hGH gene as a reporter, thymidine kinase growth hormone, permanently integrated into their genomes. These studies demonstrate that isoproterenol stimulates the expression of ANG gene via the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A and probably via the interaction of the 43-kD CREB with the 5'-flanking region of the ANG gene. Our data indicate that the nuclear 43-kD CREB may have a modulatory role on the expression of the ANG gene in OK cells.", 
    "37": "A recently conducted observational study of the prehospital treatment of uncontrolled atrial fibrillation brought to light therapeutic inconsistencies by emergency providers in dealing with this dysrhythmia. A review of the literature suggests that digoxin lacks efficacy in controlling ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation and that the slow onset of digoxin makes its use in the emergency setting questionable. Because of their demonstrated ability to rapidly slow ventricular rate, the calcium channel blocker, diltiazem, or the beta-adrenergic blocker, esmolol, should be the preferred agents for treating rapid atrial fibrillation in the emergency department or the paramedic ambulance.",

    "44": "The association beta-blockers plus isosorbide-5-mononitrate (I5M) has been proposed for the treatment of portal hypertension in patients with insufficient response to beta-blockers alone, according to hemodynamic criteria. The mechanism of action in these patients is not clearly defined. Fifteen patients with cirrhosis and esophageal varices were evaluated by hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurement and duplex-Doppler ultrasonography before and after 1 month of treatment with nadolol. Nine patients who did not exhibit a decrease in HVPG to 12 mm Hg or a percent decrease greater than 20% were classified as poor responders, and were studied again with the same methodology after 3 months of chronic administration of nadolol + I5M 20 mg twice per day. In poor responders, mean HVPG decrease after nadolol was 8.9% +/- 2.8%, and after the combination, it was 25.7% +/- 1.7% (P = .004). All patients except one became good responders to the association. Portal blood flow (PBF) decreased significantly after nadolol (P = .004), and remained unchanged after the addition of nitrates. Resistance to portal blood flow (RPBF) increased after nadolol (P = .02) and returned to baseline values during combined treatment (P = .03). In good responders, an adequate decrease in HVPG was associated with a decrease in PBF (P = .06) but no change in RPBF. A wide spectrum of combined changes in PBF and in RPBF after nadolol was observed in poor responders, ranging from no change in either parameter to a marked decrease in PBF counterbalanced by a marked increase in RPBF. The addition of I5M was followed in most cases by larger effects on resistance than on flow. Doppler parameters were not significantly correlated with the HVPG response to nadolol alone or associated with I5M. It is concluded that good hemodynamic responders to nadolol differ from poor responders in the lack of increase in RPBF after the drug. The addition of nitrates to nadolol is effective in decreasing portal pressure in most poor responders to nadolol alone. A decrease in outflow resistance is the main mechanism involved.", 
    "45": "Patients with tetralogy of Fallot may have episodes of paroxysmal hypoxic spells (\"tet spells\") or could be asymptomatic. In patients who have these episodes, treatment with a beta-adrenoceptor (betaAR) blocking agent can often ameliorate or attenuate the severity of the symptoms. Additionally, excitement, crying, and situations associated with increased sympathetic activity could provoke the occurrence of these hypoxic spells. We hypothesized that altered myocardial betaAR function may contribute to the development of paroxysmal hypoxic spells in the symptomatic tetralogy patient. Surgically excised right ventricular infundibular myocardial specimens from symptomatic (patients with spells) and asymptomatic patients were used to determine total beta1 and beta2 betaAR density and betaAR adenylyl cyclase activity. Symptomatic patients had a significantly greater number of total betaAR. The relative proportion of beta1 and beta2 receptors was comparable in both patient groups. betaAR-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity was found to be more enhanced in the symptomatic patient group. Our results indicate that infundibular betaARs may play a role in the development of paroxysmal hypoxic spells.", 
    "46": "Carvedilol competitively blocks beta 1, beta 2 and alpha 1 receptors. The drug lacks sympathomimetic activity and has vasodilating properties that are exerted primarily through alpha 1-blockade. Animal models indicate that carvedilol confers protection against myocardial necrosis, arrhythmia and cell damage caused by oxidising free radicals, and the drug has no adverse effects on plasma lipid profiles. Recent data have confirmed the antihypertensive efficacy of carvedilol in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Carvedilol has similar efficacy to other beta-blocking agents, calcium antagonists, ACE inhibitors and hydrochlorothiazide. Carvedilol also improves exercise tolerance and ischaemic symptoms in patients with stable angina pectoris. Significant reductions in serious cardiac events after acute myocardial infarction and in frequency and severity of ischaemic events in patients with unstable angina have also been demonstrated. Interest in the use of carvedilol in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) has culminated in the publication of a cumulative analysis of data from 1094 patients with mild to severe CHF who participated in the US Carvedilol Heart Failure Study Program (4 trials). After a median follow-up of 6.5 months, a significant overall reduction in mortality relative to placebo (3.2 vs 7.8%) was revealed in patients who had received carvedilol 6.25 to 50 mg twice daily (plus diuretics and ACE inhibitors). All-cause mortality, risk of hospitalisation for cardiovascular reasons and hospitalisation costs were also reduced significantly (by 65, 28% and 62%, respectively) in these trials. In addition, the Australia and New Zealand Heart Failure Research Collaborative Group showed a 26% reduction in the combined risk of death or hospitalisation with carvedilol 12.5 to 50 mg/day relative to placebo after a mean 19-month follow-up period in 415 patients with CHF (relative risk 0.74). Adverse events with carvedilol appear to be less frequent than with other beta-blocking agents, are dosage-related and are usually seen early in therapy. Events most commonly reported are related to the vasodilating (postural hypotension, dizziness and headaches) and the beta-blocking (dyspnoea, bronchospasm, bradycardia, malaise and asthenia) properties of the drug. Carvedilol appears to date to have little effect on the incidence of worsening heart failure. Concomitant administration of carvedilol with some medications requires monitoring. Carvedilol is therefore likely to have a beneficial role in the management of controlled CHF, but further clinical studies are required to show the place of beta-adrenoceptor blocking therapy in general in this indication, and the position of carvedilol relative to other similar agents. Carvedilol is also confirmed as effective in the management of mild to moderate hypertension and ischaemic heart disease.", 
    "47": "Acebutolol (AC) is a chiral beta-adrenergic blocking drug, possessing intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), and is useful clinically as the racemate in treating hypertension. Utilizing a stereospecific high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) assay, the enantiomeric disposition of AC and its major metabolite diacetolol (DC) are reported after intravenous administration of single 5, 15, 30, and 50 mg kg-1 doses of racemate to male Sprague-Dawley rats. The mean area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) values display a linear relationship with respect to the administered dose. No statistical differences are observed in apparent volume of distribution (Vd), terminal elimination half-life (t1/2), total body clearance (Clt), or renal clearance (Clr) with respect to dose administered. Generally, R-S ratios for AUC following AC administration are statistically different from unity (p < 0.05). However, for the 50 mg kg-1 doses the R-S ratio for AUC is not statistically different from one. For DC, the plasma disposition is nonstereoselective in plasma. The amount of R-DC recovered in urine, however, was greater than that of the antipode (R:S = 1.92 +/- 0.29). This study suggests that the enantiomeric disposition of intravenous AC is linear within the investigated range of 5-50 mg kg-1 racemate in rats.",

    "55": "The role of hypercorticism in the development of compromised beta-adrenergic signaling in adipose tissue was assessed in ob/ob mice adrenalectomized at 4 weeks of age and studied 1 and 3 weeks thereafter. Adrenalectomy prevented the rapid increase in body weight and fat deposition between 4 and 5 weeks of age in ob/ob mice and produced a phenotype indistinguishable from that of lean mice. However, adrenalectomized ob/ob mice became intermediate between lean and ob/ob mice by 7 weeks of age. Adipocyte beta3-adrenergic receptor (AR) messenger RNA levels were similar between lean and adrenalectomized ob/ob mice at both time points and were 4- to 8-fold higher than messenger RNA levels in ob/ob mice. As judged by maximal activation of adenylyl cyclase by a beta3-AR-selective agonist, adrenalectomy also restored functional activity of the beta3-AR to levels above or equivalent to those seen in lean mice at both time points. The present results suggest that development of hypercorticism at or before weaning in ob/ob mice represses expression of the beta3-AR and prevents the normal postweaning development of this signaling system in the adipocyte.", 
    "56": "Kallistatin is a serine proteinase inhibitor which binds to tissue kallikrein and inhibits its activity. The aim of this study is to evaluate if kallistatin has a direct effect on the vasculature and on blood pressure homeostasis. We found that an intravenous bolus injection of human kallistatin caused a rapid, potent, and transient reduction of mean arterial blood pressure in anesthetized rats. Infusion of purified kallistatin (0.07-1.42 nmol/kg) into cannulated rat jugular vein produced a 20-85 mmHg reduction of blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner. Hoe 140, a bradykinin B2-receptor antagonist, had no effect on the hypotensive effect of kallistatin yet it abolished the blood pressure-lowering effect of kinin and kallikrein. Relaxation of isolated aortic rings by kallistatin was observed in the presence (ED50 of 3.4 x 10(-9) M) and in the absence of endothelium (ED50 of 10(-9) M). Rat kallikrein-binding protein, but not kinin or kallikrein, induced vascular relaxation of aortic rings. Neither Hoe 140 nor Nomega-nitro--arginine methyl ester, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, affected vasorelaxation induced by kallistatin. Kallistatin also caused dose-dependent vasodilation of the renal vasculature in the isolated, perfused rat kidney. Specific kallistatin-binding sites were identified in rat aorta by Scatchard plot analysis with a Kd of 0.25+/-0.07 nM and maximal binding capacity of 47.9+/-10.4 fmol/mg protein (mean+/-SEM, n = 3). These results indicate that kallistatin is a potent vasodilator which may function directly through a vascular smooth muscle mechanism independent of an endothelial bradykinin receptor. This study introduces the potential significance of kallistatin in directly regulating blood pressure to reduce hypertension.", 
    "57": "The aim of our study was to evaluate whether inhibition of ACE (lisinopril 10-20 mg/day) can reduce the rate of decline in kidney function more than reducing blood pressure with conventional antihypertensive treatment (atenolol 50-100 mg/day), usually in combination with a diuretic. We performed a prospective, randomized, parallel study for 42 months, double blind for the first 12 months and single blind thereafter. Forty-three (21 lisinopril and 22 atenolol) hypertensive NIDDM patients with diabetic nephropathy were enrolled. Data from 36 patients (17 lisinopril and 19 atenolol, 60 +/- 7 years of age, 27 men) who completed at least 12 months of the study period are presented. At baseline, the two groups were comparable: glomerular filtration rate (51Cr-EDTA plasma clearance) was 75 +/- 6 and 74 +/- 8 ml x min(-1) x 1.73 m(-2), mean 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (A&D TM2420) was 110 +/- 3 and 114 +/- 2 mmHg, and 24-h urinary albumin excretion rate was 961 (range 331-5,727) and 1,578 (476-5,806) mg/24 h in the lisinopril and atenolol groups, respectively. The mean follow-up time was similar, 37 and 35 months in the lisinopril and atenolol groups, respectively. Mean ambulatory blood pressure was equally reduced in the two groups, 12 +/- 2 and 10 +/- 2 mmHg in the lisinopril and atenolol groups, respectively. Glomerular filtration rate declined in a biphasic manner with a faster initial (0 to 6 months) change of 1.25 +/- 0.49 and 0.81 +/- 0.29 ml x min(-1) x month(-1) followed by a slower sustained decline (6 to 42 months) of 0.59 +/- 0.10 and 0.54 +/- 0.13 ml x min(-1) x month(-1) in the lisinopril and atenolol groups, respectively. No significant differences were observed in either initial or sustained decline in glomerular filtration rate between the two groups. Urinary albumin excretion was reduced (% reduction of baseline) more in the lisinopril than in the atenolol group, at 55 (95% CI 29-72) and 15% (-13 to 34), respectively (P = 0.01). In conclusion, the relentless decline in kidney function characteristically found in hypertensive NIDDM patients with diabetic nephropathy can be reduced equally effectively by two antihypertensive treatments, the beta-blocker atenolol and the ACE inhibitor lisinopril.", 
    "58": "These experiments examined the effects of posttraining intraamygdala administration of the muscarinic agonist, oxotremorine, and the beta-noradrenergic antagonist, propranolol, on memory for reduction in reward magnitude. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (175-200 g) implanted with bilateral intraamygdala cannulae were food deprived (maintained at 80% of body weight) and trained to run a straight alley (six trials/day) for either ten 45-mg food pellets (high reward) or one 45-mg food pellet (low reward) for 10 days. In Experiment One, the animals in the high-reward group were than shifted to a one-pellet reward and immediately given intraamygdala infusions (0.5 microliter/side) of either oxotremorine (10 ng) or phosphate buffer. Shifted training continued for 4 more days and no further injections were given. Shifted animals given the buffer solution displayed an increase in runway latencies but returned to preshift latencies by the fifth day of shifted training. In contrast, animals given oxotremorine exhibited increased latencies through the fifth day. In Experiment Two, rats were trained as in Experiment. One but immediately following the shift received intraamygdala infusions of oxotremorine (10 ng), propranolol (0.3 microgram), both, or phosphate buffer. Shifted vehicle-injected rats returned to preshift performance by the fifth day of shifted training. Shifted propranolol rats returned to preshift latencies by the third day of shifted training. In contrast, the shifted oxotremorine and the shifted oxotremorine/propranolol rats displayed longer latencies than unshifted controls through 5 days of shifted training. The findings indicate that the muscarinic cholinergic and beta-noradrenergic systems within the amygdala interact in regulating memory and support the view that noradrenergic influences are mediated through cholinergic activation.", 
    "59": "Administration of fluoxetine (10 mg/kg i.p.) caused a significantly greater increase in extracellular 5-HT levels in hypothalamus of rats adapted to a reverse light period (lights off 9:00 am-9:00 pm) than those adapted to the regular cycle (lights off 6:00 pm-6:00 am). Sequential administration of the antagonist 5-HT1A/beta-adrenergic receptors (-)-pindolol at 0.1, 0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg s.c. significantly enhanced the fluoxetine-induced elevation of 5-HT levels in both groups of rats. (-)-Pindolol at 0.1 mg/kg potentiated the fluoxetine-induced elevation in 5-HT levels significantly higher in rats adapted to the reverse light cycle than in those accustomed to the regular light cycle. The greater effects of fluoxetine and the subsequent administration of (-)-pindolol in the reverse cycle group may relate to the difference in activity of 5-HT neurons in the dorsal raphe of conscious animals adapted to the two light periods.", 
    "60": "The influence of achiral modifiers on the chiral separation of propranolol is examined by cyclodextrin modified capillary zone electrophoresis. The improved chiral separation of propranolol is by molecules previously identified in our group as forming ternary complexes with cyclodextrin and pyrene. The polarity, chain size and heteroatom composition of the functional groups on the comodifiers was systematically varied in order to study the influence of these variables on the separation of propranolol. The improved chiral separation is accompanied by a decrease in retention time. The decrease in retention time is suggestive of a decrease in the association of beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) with propranolol which was verified by calculation of apparent association constants using fluorometric methods.", 
    "61": "Successful management of the patient with chronic stable angina requires correct stratification by assessing the risk of future coronary events. Patients at low risk for such events have a relatively good prognosis; revascularization procedures (balloon angioplasty or surgery) offer no benefit over medical management. Such patients should be offered medical therapy as their first option. The goals in management of chronic stable angina are (1) treatment of other conditions that may worsen angina; (2) treatment with aspirin and modification of risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) to improve outcome; and (3) effective relief of anginal symptoms. Most patients with stable angina will have CAD. It is well established that treatment with aspirin and modification of risk factors for CAD are beneficial in reducing cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Blood pressure reduction, lowering of blood cholesterol level, and smoking cessation are interventions of proven value and appear to correct defects (at least partially) in the endothelial function of the coronary blood vessels. Other interventions that are helpful are estrogen replacement treatment in postmenopausal women, and low-dose aspirin therapy-which is recommended for all patients who can tolerate it. For controlling symptoms and improving angina-free walking time, nitrates, beta blockers, and calcium channel antagonists are efficacious as first-line monotherapy for chronic stable angina in this group of patients. Nitrates may be of special use in patients with impaired left ventricular function, overt congestive heart failure, intermittent coronary vasoconstriction, or coronary artery spasm. In patients with concomitant hypertension or supraventricular tachycardia, beta blockers are helpful. Calcium channel antagonists may be useful in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, peripheral vascular disease, or hypertension. When optimal monotherapy with a given class of drug fails to control symptoms, alternative monotherapy with a different class of agent should be tried before combination therapy. Combination therapy with 2 or 3 agents is not always superior to optimal monotherapy. Patients who fail to respond to adequate medical therapy should be considered for a revascularization procedure.", 
    "62": "We studied the alpha1-adrenoceptor subtypes mediating the positive inotropic effects of phenylephrine and noradrenaline as well as endogenous noradrenaline released by tyramine in rabbit papillary muscle. In the presence of propranolol, both phenylephrine and tyramine produced a positive inotropic effect in a concentration-dependent manner. WB4101 (N-[2-(2,6-dimethoxyphenoxy]ethyl]-2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzodioxin+ ++-2-methanamine) and chlorethylclonidine each antagonized the positive inotropic effect of phenylephrine. On the other hand, only chlorethylclonidine significantly blocked the positive inotropic effect of tyramine. However, the presence of both antagonists was needed to block the positive inotropic effect elicited by the exogenous addition of the low concentration of noradrenaline. These data suggest that after extensive blockade of beta-adrenoceptors the positive inotropic effects of phenylephrine and exogenous noradrenaline result from stimulation of the alpha1A- and alpha1B-adrenoceptor subtypes, whereas that of endogenous noradrenaline is mediated via the alpha1B-adrenoceptor subtype. This could be explained by assuming that the alpha1B-adrenoceptor subtype population may be located on a space confronting more closely to the sympathetic nerve endings than the alpha1A-adrenoceptor subtype population.", 
    "63": "In HL60 granulocytes, 4beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) induced tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins with molecular weight of 100-115 kDa and 45 kDa. Furthermore, PMA-mediated phosphatidic acid (PA) production via phospholipase D (PLD) activation. In the presence of either butanol or ethanol, PMA-induced PA production was markedly reduced and instead a metabolically stable phosphatidylbutanol (PBut) or phosphatidylethanol (PEt) was produced by transphosphatidylation by PLD. Under the same incubation condition, these primary alcohols inhibited PMA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the 100-115 kDa proteins. Propranolol, which is often used as a selective inhibitor of PA phosphohydrolase (PAP) involving diacylglycerol (DG) formation from PA, did not affect tyrosine phosphorylation of the 100-115 kDa proteins. Moreover, incubation of HL60 granulocytes with Streptomyces chromofuscus PLD caused both PA production and tyrosine phosphorylation of the above proteins. Exogenous PA treatment also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the same proteins. Thus, the results presented here suggest that PA produced via PLD activation is involved in tyrosine phosphorylation of the 100-115 kDa proteins in HL60 granulocytes.", 
    "64": "The mortality rate after myocardial infarction is more than twice as large in diabetic patients than in patients without diabetes. Optimal blood sugar control in the acute phase and during follow-up might improve prognosis. The relative reduction in mortality and cardiac events after myocardial infarction by means of betablockers, ACE inhibitors and statins is the same for diabetics as for non-diabetes. However, because of the poorer prognosis, the absolute reduction in mortality is more than twice as high in diabetic as in non-diabetic patients. For this reason, diabetic patients comprise a target group for secondary prevention by means of betablockers, ACE inhibitors and statins after myocardial infarction.", 
    "65": "Activin is a member of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta superfamily, which comprises a growing list of multifunctional proteins that serve as regulators of cell proliferation and differentiation. Recently, activin was shown to regulate the neurotransmitter phenotype in peripheral neurons. It is also a potent survival factor for neurogenic clonal cell lines, retinal neurons and midbrain dopaminergic neurons. We have studied the effect of activin on hippocampal cells which show abundant expression of activin receptors or binding sites. Exposure of primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons to activin supported neuronal survival. This neurotrophic action of activin was blocked by treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein or the protein kinase C inhibitor calphostin C. However, the Ca2+/calmodulin kinase inhibitor KN-62 had no effect. Nicardipine, a blocker of the L-type Ca2+ channel, also inhibited the neurotrophic effect of activin. Furthermore, activin potentiated the depolarization-induced elevation in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). The neurotrophic effect and the potentiation of depolarization-induced increase of [Ca2+]i caused by activin were completely abolished by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. These results suggest that activin supports neuronal survival by increasing the expression of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel through the action of a tyrosine kinase and of protein kinase C, but not of Ca2+/calmodulin kinase.", 
    "66": "Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the lipolysis of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, and the gene coding for LPL is therefore a candidate gene in atherogenesis. We previously demonstrated that two amino acid substitutions in LPL, the Asn291-Ser and the Asp9-Asn, are associated with elevated triglycerides and lower HDL cholesterol and are present with greater frequency in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients than in normolipidemic control subjects. Conversely, a third frequent mutation in this gene, the Ser447-Stop, is reported by some investigators to underlie higher HDL cholesterol levels and would represent a beneficial genetic variant in lipoprotein metabolism. We therefore sought conclusive evidence for these allegations by investigating the effects of the LPL Ser447-Stop mutation on LPL and hepatic lipase (HL) activity, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides in a large group of CAD patients (n = 820) with normal to mildly elevated total and LDL cholesterol levels.", 
    "67": "Carriers of the Ser447-Stop allele (heterozygotes and homozygotes) had significantly higher postheparin LPL activity (P = .034), normal postheparin HL activity (P = .453), higher HDL cholesterol levels (P = .013), and lower triglyceride levels (P = .044) than noncarriers. The influence of the Ser447-Stop allele on LPL activity was pronounced in patients using beta-blockers (P = .042) and not significant in those not using them (P = .881), suggesting a gene-environment interaction between the Ser447-Stop mutation and beta-blockers.", 
    "68": "We conclude that the LPL Ser447-Stop mutation has a significant positive effect on LPL activity and HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels and that certain subgroups of CAD patients carrying the Ser447-Stop mutation will have less adverse metabolic effects when placed on beta-blockers. The LPL Ser447-Stop mutation therefore should have a protective effect against the development of atherosclerosis and subsequent CAD.", 
    "69": "1. Regulation of anion secretion by adrenoceptors in primary culture of mouse endometrial epithelium was investigated using the short circuit current (ISC) technique. 2. Adrenaline stimulated a sustained increase in the ISC in a concentration-dependent manner. The adrenaline-induced ISC could be inhibited by pretreatment with diphenylamine 2,2'-dicarboxylic acid (DPC) or replacement of external Cl- and HCO3-, but not by amiloride or replacement of Na+ in apical solution. 3. The concentration-dependent responses of the adrenaline-induced ISC to the Cl- channel blockers glibenclamide and DPC were examined and exhibited IC50 values of 380 and 960 microM, respectively. 4. The effect of various adrenoceptor agonists on the ISC was examined. The order of potency appeared to be isoprenaline > adrenaline > noradrenaline, while no response was elicited by the alpha-adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine, indicating a predominant involvement of beta-adrenoceptors. 5. The beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol was found to be much more effective than the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine in inhibiting the ISC responses induced by all adrenoceptor agonists examined. 6. The effect of adrenaline on the ISC was mimicked by an adenylate cyclase activator, forskolin, but suppressed by the adenylate cyclase inhibitor MDL 12,330A, indicating the involvement of cAMP. 7. Our results demonstrate that anion secretion by the mouse endometrial epithelium is regulated by beta-adrenoceptors and involves a cAMP-dependent mechanism.", 
    "70": "Tolbutamide methyl hydroxylation and S-warfarin 7-hydroxylation activities were reconstituted in systems containing recombinant human cytochrome P450 (P450 or CYP) 2C10(2C9) and the optimal conditions for the systems were compared with those of bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation by CYP1A1, theophylline 8-hydroxylation by CYP1A2, bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation by CYP2D6, chlorzoxazone 6-hydroxylation by CYP2E1, and testosterone 6 beta-hydroxylation by CYP3A4. CYP2C10 required cytochrome b5 (b5) for optimal rates of tolbutamide and S-warfarin oxidations and b5 could be replaced by apo-b5; apo-b5 and b5 effects on the reconstituted systems have already been reported in systems containing CYP3A4 for the oxidation of testosterone and nifedipine and for the rapid reduction of CYP3A4 by NADPH-P450 reductase (H. Yamazaki et al., 1996, J. Biol. Chem. 271, 27438-27444). Stopped-flow studies, however, suggested that apo-b5 as well as b5 did not cause stimulation of the reduction of CYP2C10 by NADPH-P450 reductase, while the reduction rates were dependent on the substrates in reconstituted systems. Chlorzoxazone 6-hydroxylation by CYP2E1 was stimulated by b5, but not by apo-b5, in reconstituted systems. Neither apo- nor holo-b5 increased bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation activity by CYP1A1 or 2D6 or theophylline 8-hydroxylation by CYP1A2. Interestingly, we found that testosterone 6 beta-hydroxylation by CYP3A4 was stimulated by CYP1A2 (and also by a modified form in which the first 36 residues of the native human protein were removed) and CYP1A1 as well as by b5, and such stimulations were not seen when other P450 proteins (e.g., CYP2C10, 2D6, or 2E1) were added to the reconstituted systems. In contrast, substrate oxidations by CYP2C10 and CYP2E1 were not stimulated by other P450 proteins. The present results suggest that there are differences in optimal conditions for reconstitution of substrate oxidations by various forms of human P450 enzymes, and in some P450-catalyzed reactions protein-protein interactions between P450 and b5 and other P450 proteins are very important in some oxidations catalyzed by CYP2C10, 2E1, and 3A4.",

    "80": "The sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) was used to assay central effects of pindolol (10 and 30 mg p.o.), a mixed beta(1/2)-adrenoceptor/5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(1A/1B) receptor blocker, in humans. Compared to placebo, pindolol produced a dose-related suppression of rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, including a prolongation of REM latency, and a decrease of REM time and REM density. At the higher dose, it also reduced EEG spectral power during non-REM sleep in portions of the delta, theta, and alpha frequencies (1.125-5.125 Hz, 7.125-9.625 Hz). By contrast, betaxolol (20 mg p.o.), a selective beta1-antagonist devoid of serotonergic affinity, affected neither REM sleep nor EEG power. REM sleep is, in part, under the inhibitory control of serotonergic neurons projecting from the dorsal raphe nucleus to pontine cholinergic/cholinoceptive cells. The EEG power spectrum induced by pindolol tended to be opposite to what has previously been reported for ipsapirone, a 5-HT1A agonist. Therefore, the present data, tentatively, are consistent with the contention that pindolol inhibits, possibly selectively, somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors in humans and may antagonize self-inhibition of midbrain raphe nuclei 5-HT neurons.", 
    "81": "Early heart failure is characterized by elevated plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) levels, but little is known about the direct effects of ANP on cardiac myocytes. In neonatal rat cardiac myocytes, ANP induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent and cell type-specific manner. Maximum effects occurred at 1 microM ANP, with a 4-5-fold increase in apoptotic cells, reaching a maximum apoptotic index of 19%. In contrast, the maximum apoptotic index of ANP-treated non-myocytes was 1.1 +/- 0.2%, equivalent to control cultures. ANP treatment also sharply reduced levels of Mcl-1 mRNA, a Bcl-2 homologue, coincident with the increase in the incidence of apoptosis. ANP induction of apoptosis was receptor-dependent and mediated by cyclic GMP: the effect was mimicked by 8-bromo-cGMP, a membrane-permeable analog, and by sodium nitroprusside, an activator of soluble guanylyl cyclase, and was potentiated by a cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor, zaprinast. Interestingly, norepinephrine, a myocyte growth factor, inhibited ANP-induced apoptosis via activation of the beta-adrenergic receptor and elevation of cyclic AMP. These results show that ANP is a specific effector of cardiac myocyte apoptosis in culture via receptor-mediated elevation of cGMP. Furthermore, at least in this model, ANP and norepinephrine may have opposing roles in the modulation of cardiac myocyte growth and survival.", 
    "82": "In dogs, rapid cardiac pacing, by way of a pacing electrode in the right ventricle, protects against ventricular arrhythmias when a coronary artery is occluded immediately after cessation of the pacing period. This represents a form of ischaemic preconditioning. The role of bradykinin in mediating the protective effects of rapid cardiac pacing in this model was investigated using a selective antagonist of bradykinin at B2 receptors (icatibant; HOE 140). In the presence of icatibant cardiac pacing (220 beats min(-1)) resulted in more severe ischaemia (as assessed by ST-segment elevation from the pacing electrode at the end of the stimulus) and to a higher incidence of ventricular arrhythmias during the pacing protocol. When the coronary artery was occluded under such conditions the antiarrhythmic protection afforded by cardiac pacing was not seen although other indices of reduced ischaemia severity (epicardial ST-segment mapping; changes in the degree of inhomogeneity of electrical activation within the ischaemic area) were not affected by icatibant treatment. These results suggest that bradykinin is an important trigger mediator involved in the protective effects of cardiac pacing. Whether this is due to the generation of endothelium-derived protective substances (such as nitric oxide and prostacyclin) or whether it results from a direct effect on B2 receptors in cardiac myocytes is unclear.",

    "84": "The PK-PD model of (+)-Met and (-)-Met was studied in anesthetized dogs. The plasma drug concentration-time profiles were most adequately described by two compartment model. Significant differences of Vd/F, CLs/F and AUC between (+)-Met and (-)-Met were observed. The peak times of plasma (+)-Met and (-)-Met concentration in dogs were 24 +/- 5 and 30 +/- 5 min, respectively. But the peak times of drug inhibitory effects on Vmax, dp/dtmax, LVSP, SBP and HR were about 90-120 min, showing the hysteresis loops. When using the effect compartment model, the counterclockwise hysteresis collapsed and the relationships between the effects and concentration in effect compartment were fit by using Sigmoid-Emax model.

    "90": "The aim of this paper was to examine if there were clinical studies supporting a beneficial effect of an even plasma concentration over 24 h for the most frequently prescribed beta 1-blockers in clinical practice, metoprolol CR/ZOK and atenolol. There are several studies showing that metoprolol CR/ZOK has a more even plasma concentration compared with atenolol and conventional metoprolol tablets when administered once daily. There are also studies showing that metoprolol CR/ZOK produces a more even beta 1-blockade over 24 h. This is determined by expressing the percentage reduction in exercise heart rate in relation to placebo at intervals throughout the 24-h period and comparing the results with those of atenolol and conventional metoprolol tablets. Clinical studies indicate that the low peak plasma concentration produced by metoprolol CR/ZOK leads to more beta 1 selectivity than atenolol and conventional metoprolol tablets. The loss of beta 1 selectivity at peak plasma concentrations may cause unwanted side-effects. The peak plasma concentration of atenolol coincides with increased general and leg fatigue, problems less evident when patients are on metoprolol CR/ZOK. The frequency and severity of other central nervous system related side-effects are comparable with metoprolol CR/ZOK and atenolol. In conclusion, there are several clinical studies supporting a beneficial effect of the even plasma concentration over 24 h achieved with metoprolol CR/ZOK.", 
    "91": "The introduction of pharmacological therapy has been one of the major advances in the treatment of the complications of portal hypertension. Many drugs have been shown to reduce portal hypertension in patients with cirrhosis. However, the most widely used drugs and the only ones for which there is sufficient evidence, are the beta-blockers. These drugs have been, up to now, the only accepted prophylactic therapy for oesophageal variceal bleeding and are also an alternative treatment to sclerotherapy or surgery to prevent variceal rebleeding. A reduction in portal pressure gradient by beta-blockers below 12 mmHg or by more than 20% of baseline values is associated with almost a total protection from oesophageal bleeding. Such a marked response in portal pressure is only achieved in some patients receiving propranolol. New pharmacological approaches with a greater portal pressure reducing effect may improve the beneficial effect of drugs in preventing variceal bleeding. The more promising approach is the combined administration of beta-blockers and isosorbide-5-mononitrate, which has been shown to potentiate the reduction in portal pressure and to be highly effective in initial randomized clinical trials.", 
    "92": "The role of catecholamines in immune changes associated with the metabolic stress of 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) was examined in this study. Male Lewis rats were pretreated with the nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist nadolol (0-0.5 mg/kg) and then received either a saline or 2-DG (500 mg/kg) injection. Nadolol attenuated the 2-DG-induced suppression of splenic T-cell mitogenic response and interferon-gamma production and increased nitric oxide production by macrophages in a dose-dependent manner. Conversely, nadolol did not attenuate the 2-DG-induced changes in immune parameters in peripheral blood leukocytes. These results suggest that the peripheral release of catecholamines is responsible for 2-DG-induced splenic immune alterations, whereas the peripheral release of catecholamine is not responsible for 2-DG-induced blood immune alterations. Furthermore, the neuroendocrine mechanisms responsible for splenic immune changes induced by the metabolic stress of 2-DG administration were the same as those involved in immune changes induced by physical and psychological stress. Thus, this study suggests that common neuroendocrine pathways exist for several types of stress-induced immunomodulations.", 
    "93": "The repeated administration of nicotine at small doses, which do not produce whole body tremor or convulsion, causes tremor only in the tail (tail-tremor) of rats. The tremor is accompanied by locomotor hyperactivity without rigidity and immobility of the whole body, suggesting that the nicotine-induced tail-tremor model is useful for studying the mechanism underlying tremor associated with movement. The tail-tremor induced by nicotine was suppressed by mecamylamine, a nicotinic antagonist, but not by atropine or scopolamine, muscalinic antagonists. Moreover, the tail-tremor was suppressed by the beta-blockers propranolol and pindolol, as well as the benzodiazepines diazepam and clonazepam. Tremor at rest is observed only in Parkinson's disease, which is improved with anti-muscalinic drugs. Essential tremor is one of the typical tremors connected with movement (postural and kinetic tremor) and is improved with beta-blocker. These findings and results suggest that nicotine-induced tail-tremor is useful for the study of essential tremor in animal models.", 
    "94": "1. We have studied the effects of bromoacetylalprenololmenthane (BAAM), a very slowly reversible beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, on the responses of the left ventricle of 5 and 22 week old Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) to isoprenaline. At 5 weeks the SHRs were prehypertensive and at 22 weeks they had hypertension-induced hypertrophy of the left ventricle. 2. The mean potency of isoprenaline on the left ventricle from 5 week old WKY was similar to that obtained on left ventricle with BAAM at 10(-6) M for 30 min, there was a parallel rightward shift of the isoprenaline concentration-response curves. Treatment with a higher concentration of BAAM (10(-5)M) caused non-parallel rightward shifts of the concentration-response curves, with a depression of the isoprenaline maximum responses. These data were used to derive affinity (KA) values for isoprenaline. The mean isoprenaline KA value on the left ventricle from 5 week old WKY was 2.44 x 10(-6)M, and similar KA values were obtained on the left ventricles from 22 week old WKY and 5 and 22 week old SHRs. On all the left ventricles tested, isoprenaline produced a half maximal response by occupying less than 1%, and a near maximal response by occupying about 5% of the available beta(1)-adrenoceptors. 4. This study has shown that there are no differences in the cardiac responses to isoprenaline at beta(1)-adrenoceptors, isoprenaline KA values or the beta(1)-adrenoceptor reserve for isoprenaline on the SHR left ventricle in prehypertension or in the early stages of hypertension-induced hypertrophy.", 
    "95": "1. The role of beta(3)-adrenoceptors in isoprenaline-induced relaxation of carbachol-precontracted ring segments of the rat lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) was examined. 2. Isoprenaline (10(-8)M-10(-5)M) relaxed ring segments of the LOS in a concentration-dependent manner. Propranolol (10(-7)M) had very little antagonist effect on isoprenaline-induced relaxation. 3. Dobutamine (10(-7)M-10(-4)M), salbutamol (10(-7)-10(-4)M) and BRL 37344 (10(-8)-10(-5)M) also relaxed carbachol-contracted ring segments of the LOS in a concentration-dependent manner. The relaxant responses to these agonists were similarly not antagonized by propranolol (10(-7)M). 4. Cyanopindolol (10(-6)M), produced a parallel rightward displacement of isoprenaline, dobutamine, salbutamol and BRL 37344 concentration-response curves with similar potencies. The pKB values range from 7.3 +/- 0.1 to 7.7 +/- 0.2. 5. The relaxant effect of isoprenaline in the rat LOS was not inhibited by NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NOARG; 3 x 10(-5)M), glibenclamide (10(-5)M) or tetraethylammonium (1 mM). 6. It was concluded that beta(3)-adrenoceptors mediate isoprenaline-induced relaxation in rat lower oesophageal sphincter and that activation of these receptors was not linked to either ATPase-, Ca(2+)-dependent K+ channels or to NO release.", 
    "96": "1. The purpose of this study was to examine effects of the beta(1)-adrenoreceptor antagonist esmolol (infused at 2 or 4 mg kg-1 body wt min-1) on heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, localized body temperature changes, survival times, and lethal body temperatures that occur during the exposure of anaesthetized rats to 35 GHz microwaves. 2. Forty Sprague-Dawley rats, anaesthetized with ketamine, were exposed to 35 GHz microwaves at a level that resulted in heating and death. During irradiation, a continuous increase in heart rate and a biphasic response in blood pressure (initial increase followed by a decrease) were observed in all groups of animals. 3. Esmolol caused a significant dose-dependent decrease in blood pressure, relative to saline-treated animals, but only a small attenuation of the heat-induced rise in heart rate. In experiments in which esmolol was infused and microwave exposure was continued until death, drug-treated animals survived for significantly shorter periods and died at significantly lower body temperatures. The change in survival may have been related to the lower blood pressure due to esmolol treatment.", 
    "97": "The effects of suppressing Na+ influx on the activity of ATP-sensitive K+ channels (K(ATP) channel) and intracellular ATP concentration in mouse pancreatic beta-cells were studied. Lowering extracellular Na+ concentration brought about a closing of K(ATP) channels. The activity of K(ATP) channels was markedly inhibited by the addition of amiloride, a blocker of Na+/H+-counter transporter. Mannoheptulose completely eliminated the inhibition otherwise induced by amiloride. Monensin, an electroneutral Na+/H+ antiporter, remarkably increased the activity of K(ATP) channels. Removing extracellular Ca2+ also caused inhibition of the channel activity. ATP measurement experiments using isolated islets revealed that the intracellular ATP concentration of islet cells was significantly increased by incubating either with amiloride or a low Na+ solution. The measurement of fluorescence excited at 360 nm demonstrated that both suppressing Na+ influx and inhibition of Na+/K+-pumps caused a transient increase in the reduced form of pyridine nucleotide. These findings indicate that a decrease in Na+ influx could cause an elevation in intracellular ATP concentration probably through inducing a fall in ATP consumption at the Na+/K+-pump sites.", 
    "98": "Involvement of receptor subtypes in the alpha 1-adrenoceptor mediated activation of Na/K/2Cl-cotransport and K+ channels was studied in isolated perfused spontaneously beating rat hearts stimulated by phenylephrine (30 mumol/l) in the presence of a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist (1 mumol/l timolol). The effects of alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation on K+ translocation mechanisms were studied by measuring the efflux of 86Rb+ (a potassium analogue). The effects of 50 mumol/l bumetanide (Na/K/2Cl-cotransport inhibitor) and 0.1-0.3 mmol/l 4-aminopyridine (inhibitor of K+ channels) were studied in the presence of alpha 1-adrenoceptor subtype selective antagonists. Bumetanide reduced the alpha 1-adrenoceptor mediated increase in 86Rb+ efflux by 53 +/- 16.4% (n = 14, P < 0.001) in hearts pretreated with the preferentially alpha 1B-adrenoceptor antagonist chloroethylclonidine (CEC, 10 mumol/l), and by 35 +/- 7.3% (n = 15, P < 0.001) in the presence of the preferentially alpha 1D-adrenoceptor antagonist BMY 7378 (1 mumol/l). In the presence of the preferentially alpha 1A-adrenoceptor antagonist 5-methylurapidil (10 mumol/l), however, bumetanide had no effect on the response to phenylephrine. 4-Aminopyridine reduced the phenylephrine stimulated 86Rb+ efflux in the presence of 5-methylurapidil, but the effect of the K(+)-channel blocker was eliminated in CEC treated hearts. Thus the effects of the two translocation inhibitors were influenced differently by the two subtype selective antagonists, showing that alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation activates a bumetanide sensitive Na/K/2Cl-cotransport mechanism in the rat heart mainly through the alpha 1A-receptor subtype while the 4-aminopyridine sensitive K+ channels, are mainly activated by the alpha 1B-adrenoceptor subtype.",

We also evaluated the involvement of beta-receptors in this response as well as the possible effect of cAMP and hydrogen peroxide in the process of lymphocyte activation by adrenaline. The results indicated that adrenaline is able to induce metabolic changes in lymphocytes that are related to enhanced proliferative capacity, but under physiological conditions fails to initiate the process, the catecholamine could, increase cell proliferation via increased production of H2O2 by macrophages, since this reactive oxygen intermediate can act as a trigger for lymphocyte activation.

Pretreatment with dopaminergic, muscarinergic acetylcholine receptor blockers and an opiate receptor antagonist blocked the anxiogenic response to CCK-8. The alpha and beta adrenoreceptor, the GABA receptor and the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor blockers were not able to modulate the 'anxiogenic-like' effect of CCK-8. The results suggest that the anxiogenic effects of CCK-8 are mediated via different neurotransmitters and the anxiogenic action can be prevented by receptor blockers to these transmitters.", 
    "105": "We determined whether chronic treatment with nipradilol, a beta-blocker with vasodilating action, reduces left ventricular cavity dilation (LV remodeling) following myocardial infarction and improves cardiac performance. Myocardial infarction was produced by coronary artery ligation in 16-week-old female rats and then the rats were treated for 3-4 months with nipradilol (10 mg/kg/day) or vehicle (0.5% carboxymethylcellulose). The effect of nipradilol on LV remodeling was evaluated by assessing the left ventricular end-diastolic volume index (LVEDVI) and passive pressure-volume relation curve. Since LVEDVI depends on the infarct size, LVEDVI was compared between the vehicle- and nipradilol-treated rats with similar infarct size (10-40%). At 3-4 months after myocardial infarct production, the left ventricular end-diastolic volume index in the vehicle-treated rats with myocardial infarction was significantly increased, compared with that in the sham-operated rats without infarction. The nipradilol-treated rats had a significantly smaller left ventricular volume index than the vehicle-treated rats (2.04 +/- 0.16 ml/kg in the vehicle-treated group vs 1.36 +/- 0.10 ml/kg in the nipradilol-treated group, P < 0.01). The maximum cardiac index achieved by volume loading as an index of cardiac performance was significantly greater in the nipradilol group than the vehicle group (254.5 +/- 12.6 ml/min kg in the vehicle group vs 347.9 +/- 20.2 ml/min kg in the nipradilol group, P < 0.01). These results suggest that chronic treatment of nipradilol attenuated left ventricular cavity dilation after myocardial infarction and improved cardiac performance.",

Total orthotopic heart transplantation with bicaval and pulmonary venous anastomoses offers synchronous contractions of the atria and a normal ventricular filling pattern, but requires longer ischemic time than standard orthotopic heart transplantation. To test if total orthotopic heart transplantation improves resting hemodynamics in pts with high preoperative pulmonary vascular resistance, we analyzed 65 pts with standard and 65 with total orthotopic heart transplantation transplanted between 12/88 and 7/94.

    "123": "Bradykinin is known to be present at sites of acute inflammation and to exert its potent inflammatory effects mainly via the bradykinin B2-receptor. Recently, bradykinin dependent processes have been described in cultured human decidual cells, so that bradykinin may expand the list of paracrine factors involved in labour induction. In this paper we present the results of in vitro studies giving evidence that these cells carry the bradykinin B2-receptor. By immunocytochemical methods the receptor protein was localized on decidual cells. Analysis of cellular extracts of cultured decidual cells by RT-PCR showed the presence of the specific mRNA coding for the bradykinin B2-receptor. Binding studies revealed a single, saturable and specific binding site for bradykinin of high affinity (Kd = 0.85 nM, Bmax = 436 fmol/mg protein). Competitive binding studies showed displacement of [3H]-bradykinin by HOE 140, but not by the ligands for the bradykinin B1-receptor, des-Arg10-kallidin and [Leu8]-des-Arg9-bradykinin. The results are consistent with the presence of the bradykinin B2-receptors.", 
    "124": "Renal nerve stimulation or circulating catecholamines activate the beta-adrenergic receptors that mediate direct effects on tubular transport. Three subtypes of beta-adrenergic receptors have been characterized: beta 1, beta 2, and beta 3. beta-Adrenergic-receptor effects on Na+ and Ca2+ transport in distal convoluted tubules (DCT) have not been established. The focus of this study was to 1) identify the subtypes of beta-adrenergic receptors in DCT cells and 2) examine functional responses to beta-receptor activation on adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) formation and Na+ and Ca2+ entry. To determine the subtypes of beta-receptors present, RNA isolated from immortalized mouse DCT cells was reverse transcribed, and the cDNA was amplified using primers designed to reported sequences for beta 1-, beta 2-, and beta 3-receptor subtypes. Products of the appropriate sizes were obtained with beta 1- and beta 2-primers. No product was observed with primers to the beta 3 sequence. Receptor products were confirmed by sequencing and are identical to reported mouse beta 1- and beta 2-receptor sequence. Receptor binding of[3H]dihydroalprenolol was 123 +/- 13 fmol/mg protein, and a 3:1 ratio of beta 1- to beta 2-receptors was observed with DCT cell membranes. Isoproterenol, a beta-receptor agonist, increased cAMP formation 8.5-fold. Pretreatment with the antagonist propranolol abolished agonist-induced cAMP accumulation. Isoproterenol significantly increased 22Na+ uptake to 345 +/- 23 compared with a basal rate of 256 +/- 12 nmol.min-1.mg protein-1 and was blocked with propranolol and beta 1- and beta 2-selective antagonists. Isoproterenol had no effect on 45Ca2+ entry into DCT cells. In summary, DCT cells express three times more beta 1- than beta 2-receptors and express no detectable beta 3-adrenergic receptors. beta-Receptors couple to adenylyl cyclase, and activation of beta-adrenergic receptors increases Na+ but not Ca2+ entry in DCT cells.", 
    "125": "Neonatal rat ventricular myocytes express both beta 1-and beta 2-adrenergic receptors linked to enhanced intracellular adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation and the modulation of contractile function. This study tests the hypothesis that muscarinic agonists act via distinct mechanisms to interfere with beta 1-and beta 2-adrenergic receptor actions. The beta 2-selective agonist zinterol (10(-7) M) elicits approximately a fourfold increase in cAMP accumulation, which is mimicked, both in magnitude and kinetics, by 10(-9) M of the mixed beta 1-receptor agonist/beta 2-receptor agonist isoproterenol. At these concentrations, isoproterenol and zinterol elicit equivalent inotropic and lusitropic (i.e., enhanced relaxation) responses. Carbachol inhibits all three responses (cAMP, inotropic, and lusitropic) elicited by isoproterenol. In contrast, carbachol does not interfere with the effect of zinterol to augment cAMP accumulation or to induce a positive inotropic response. However, carbachol inhibits the lusitropic response to zinterol via an action at an M2-muscarinic receptor linked to a pertussis toxin-sensitive pathway. Additional studies indicate that beta 2-receptor-dependent phosphorylation of troponin I and phospholamban is substantially attenuated by carbachol. We conclude that carbachol interferes with beta 1-receptor actions by reducing cAMP accumulation. In contrast, the anti-beta 2-receptor actions of carbachol are mediated by a mechanism that is distinct from inhibition of cAMP accumulation, involving an M2-muscarinic receptor coupled to a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein, which leads to inhibition of troponin I and phospholamban phosphorylation and inhibition of the beta 2-receptor-dependent lusitropic response.", 
    "126": "We recorded a series of ejecting left ventricular (LV) pressure (P)-volume (V) loops of in situ rat hearts during a gradual ascending aortic occlusion. The end-systolic (ES) P-V relationship (ESPVR) was upward convex curvilinear regardless of LV contractility. The ESPVR was shifted upward in an enhanced contractility by dobutamine and downward in a depressed contractility by propranolol; ESP at a midrange V of 0.1 ml/g LV on each ESPVR increased from 131 +/- 11 to 192 +/- 17 mmHg and decreased from 136 +/- 10 to 110 +/- 7 mmHg, respectively. Furthermore, we obtained an upward concave curvilinear pressure-volume area (PVA; a measure of total mechanical energy)-V (preload) relationship to assess LV work capability in each contractility. This relationship also shifted upward in enhanced contractility and downward in depressed contractility; the PVA at midrange V increased from 7.9 +/- 1.2 to 12.3 +/- 1.5 mmHg. ml.beat-1.g-1 and decreased from 8.2 +/- 0.9 to 6.4 +/- 0.8 mmHg.ml.beat-1.g-1.

    "127": "Autonomic control of atrial rate was evaluated in anesthetized dogs by electrical stimulation of stellate ganglia and/or cervical vagi before and after the intrinsic cardiac right atrial ganglionated plexus (RAGP) was injected with the nicotinic blocker hexamethonium or the membrane stabilizing chemical lidocaine, or the RAGP was surgically removed. Injections of lidocaine or hexamethonium into or surgical removal of the RAGP eliminated the bradycardia elicited by vagal stimulation without reducing the tachycardia induced by stellate stimulation. Yet, after surgical ablation of the RAGP, the tachycardia induced by sympathetic stimulation was still reduced by 94% by parasympathetic stimulation. After injections of hexamethonium or lidocaine into the RAGP were administered, the sympathetically induced tachycardia was reduced by 39 and 85%, respectively, by parasympathetic stimulation. After RAGP ablation, when atrial rate was increased by infusion of beta-adrenergic agonists, parasympathetic stimulation reduced atrial rate by 13%. Sinoatrial (SA) nodal parasympathectomy, produced by disrupting the RAGP, eliminates direct vagal control of the SA node while leaving prejunctional parasympathetic projections to sympathetic afferents innervating the SA node intact.", 
    "128": "The aims of this study were to determine the effect and mechanism of action of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP) on gallbladder muscle. Guinea pig gallbladder muscle strips were studied isometrically. In noncontracted muscle strips, PACAP-27 and PACAP-38 caused dose-dependent contractions, whereas vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) caused dose-dependent relaxation. PACAP-27 contractions were resistant to tetrodotoxin, atropine, and the substance P receptor antagonist [D-Arg1,D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P (Spantide) but were inhibited by the selective PACAP receptor antagonist PACAP-(6-38) and slightly increased with the VIP receptor antagonist [4-chloro-D-Phe6,Leu17]VIP. In cholecystokinin-precontracted muscle strips, both VIP and PACAP caused relaxations. This relaxant effect of PACAP-27 was inhibited by PACAP-(6-38) and [4-chloro-D-Phe6,Leu17]VIP, but not by tetrodotoxin. These studies suggest that PACAP has dual excitatory and inhibitory effects on guinea pig gallbladder muscle. The contractile effect of PACAP is a direct action on muscle through PACAP-preferring receptors. The relaxant effect of PACAP is seen in precontracted muscle strips and mediated through VIP/ PACAP-preferring receptors.", 
    "129": "To investigate the role of beta 3-adrenergic receptors in the suppression of leptin gene expression, we fasted F-344 rats to decrease leptin mRNA levels, refed the rats to stimulate leptin mRNA production, and examined the ability of the beta 3-adrenergic agonist CGP-12177 to prevent the rise in leptin mRNA levels. In the initial 2 h after CGP-12177 (0.75 mg/kg), there were significant reductions in both food consumption and leptin mRNA levels in epididymal, perirenal, and interscapular white adipose tissue. We were unable to detect leptin mRNA in interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT), whereas there was a significant increase in uncoupling protein mRNA levels in IBAT after CGP-12177. The suppression of leptin mRNA and food intake by CGP-12177 was confirmed in a second experiment using another rat strain, the F-344 x BN. Furthermore, refeeding after a period of fasting increased leptin mRNA, which was prevented by CGP-12177. These data indicate a role for beta 3-adrenergic-mediated regulation of leptin gene expression in nonmutant rodents and are consistent with other reports suggesting that beta 3-adrenergic agonists suppress food intake.", 
    "130": "To elucidate the penetrability of carteolol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist (beta-blocker) into the brain of rats, intracerebral and serum concentrations of the compound were determined in male rats receiving single or repetitive oral administration of carteolol hydrochloride at 30 mg/kg. The time-course of the intracerebral concentration of carteolol following single IV administration of the compound at 10 and 30 mg/kg was also studied in male rats. A high-performance liquid chromatography method was used to determine the intracerebral and serum concentrations. Following single oral dosing, the intracerebral concentration of carteolol reached a maximum of 0.074 microgram/g at 2 h postdosing and declined with a half-life of 3.7 h, and the Cmax and AUC of carteolol in the brain were 12.5% and 19.8% of those in serum. The intracerebral and serum concentrations of carteolol were determined in male rats receiving repetitive oral dosing of the compound once daily for 7 days. The concentration of carteolol in the brain and serum at 1 h postdosing varied within a range of 0.059-0.091 microgram/g and 0.321-0.443 microgram/ml, respectively, throughout the dosing period, showing no changes in the penetrability of the compound into the brain due to repeated dosing. The concentration of carteolol in the brain and serum increased in a dose-dependent manner in rats receiving a single IV administration of the compound. The elimination half-life of carteolol in the serum and brain was 0.6-0.8 h and 1.3-1.7 h, respectively, in rats following single IV dosing of the compound. The half-life in the brain was about twice as long as that in the serum. The brain to serum concentration ratio was 0.306:0.499. From the above results, it was concluded that carteolol is distributed from the circulation to the brain with low penetrability.", 
    "131": "One-dimensional (ID) and two-dimensional (2D) 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques have been used to investigate the chiral recognition process in capillary electrophoresis (CE) for seven different cyclodextrins (CDs) with the calcium channel blocker amlodipine as a model compound. These include five neutral CDs (alpha-CD, beta-CD, gamma-CD, hydroxypropyl-beta-CD and hydroxyethyl-beta-CD) and two anionic CDs (sulphobutyl-ether-beta-CD and carboxymethyl-beta-CD) where mixtures of amlodipine with each of the seven CDs were examined by 1D NMR in deuterated phosphate buffer at pD 3.4. The resonance shift of signals with added CD, relative to the CD-free position (shift displacement, delta delta) and shift non-equivalence (delta delta *) of enantiomeric signals shifted relative to each other after addition of CD were examined for non-overlapped protons of amlodipine. The possible correlations of NMR shift non-equivalence data with chiral separation in CE for amlodipine have been critically assessed. Qualitative differences in the 1D NMR shifts and enhanced enantioselectivity in CE were observed for amlodipine with sulphobutyl-ether-beta-CD. Further experiments on the through-space interactions using 2D rotating frame nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (ROESY) indicated that there was no association between internal glucopyranose hydrogen atoms and the aromatic hydrogens of amlodipine. This gives evidence for the aromatic ring not being included in this CD. Moreover, data from spin-lattice relaxation times (T1) measured for amlodipine in the free state and after addition of the anionic sulphobutyl-ether-beta-CD indicate that the aromatic moiety of amlodipine is not included into the sulphobutyl-ether-beta-CD cavity. There is evidence that it interacts with the sulphobutyl side chains, and may adopt a preferred orientation outside the sulphobutyl-ether-beta-CD toroid itself.", 
    "132": "A fluorescent chiral tagging reagent, 4-(3-isothiocyanatopyrrolidin-1-yl)-7-(N,N-dimethylaminosulfony l)-2,1, 3-benzoxadiazole [R(-)-DBD-PyNCS], has been used for the liquid chromatographic resolution of racemic pairs of beta-blockers. The reagents reacts with beta-blockers at 65 degrees C for 90 min in aqueous acetonitrile containing 0.05% triethylamine to produce the corresponding pair of diastereomers. No racemization occurs during the tagging reaction under these conditions. From results of the time-course study of oxprenolol the reactivities of the enantiomers of beta-blockers with R(-)-DBD-PyNCS are comparable. The optimum excitation and emission wavelengths of the resulting derivatives were ca. 460 and 550 nm, respectively. The derivatives of beta-blockers were efficiently resolved by a reversed-phase column with water-acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid as the eluent. The resolution (Rs) values of the diastereomers derived from 10 beta-blockers were in the range of 1.54-4.80. The Rs value for timolol was 0.643. The detection limits (signal-to-noise ratio of 2) were one or two orders of magnitude lower with beta-blockers having the iso-propylamino structure (15-300 fmol) than with those having the tert-butylamino structure (1.25-8.00 pmol). The proposed procedure was applied to the determination of R(+)- and S(-)-propranolol in rat plasma and saliva after oral administration of R(+)-propranolol hydrochloride or S(-)-propranolol hydrochloride.", 
    "133": "A fully automated method for the determination of the enantiomers of oxprenolol in human plasma was developed, involving dialysis through a cellulose acetate membrane, clean-up and enrichment of the dialysate on a short precolumn and subsequent chiral liquid chromatographic (LC) analysis. All sample handling operations were executed automatically by a sample processor equipped with a robotic arm (ASTED system). The trace enrichment column (TEC) was packed with octadecylsilica. After conditioning of the TEC with the LC mobile phase and pH 3.0 acetate buffer. After the enrichment step, the analyte was transferred by the LC mobile phase to the analytical column by means of a switching valve. The influence of different parameters of the dialysis process on the recovery of oxprenolol was first investigated using achiral LC conditions. The volume as well as the aspirating and dispensing flow rates of the acceptor solution were the main parameters studied. Oxprenolol was separated on a C18 stationary phase used for the enantioseparation of oxprenolol was a Chiralcel OD-R column which contained cellulose tris (3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate) coated on silica as chiral selector. The corresponding mobile phase consisted of a mixture of pH 6.0 phosphate buffer containing NaClO4 at 0.45 M concentration and acetonitrile (70:30 v/v). UV detection was performed at 273 nm. The method developed was validated. Recoveries for each enantiomer of oxprenolol were about 80%. The method was found to be linear in the 50-2500 ng ml-1 concentration range (r2 = 0.999 for both enantiomers) and good results with respect to intra- and inter-day reproducibility as well as accuracy were obtained.", 
    "134": "Epidermal keratinocytes express beta 2-adrenergic receptors on the cell membrane. The binding of the agonists to the beta 2-adrenergic receptors regulates activation of adenylate cyclase. This transmembrane signaling system has been regarded to be one of the important pathways for the functions of keratinocytes. We previously reported that beta-adrenergic stimulation induced a transient increase of intracellular Ca2+ in normal human epidermal keratinocytes. Thus we investigated the effects of epinephrine on another transmembrane signaling system, the phosphatidyl-inositol signal transduction pathway in pig epidermis. Treatment of pig pure epidermis with epinephrine resulted in a transient increase in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate with a peak at 30 s. Epinephrine induced translocation of protein kinase C from cytosol to the membrane fraction. The activation of protein kinase C, translocation of protein kinase C from cytosol to the membrane fraction, was confirmed using the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol. Moreover, the effect of epinephrine on the activation of protein kinase C was inhibited by preincubation with propranolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist. The increase in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and translocation of protein kinase C by epinephrine are consistent with the view that beta-adrenergic stimulation induces turnover of inositol phospholipid in pig epidermis.", 
    "135": "A case of type III aortic dissection which occurred fourteen months after heart transplantation is presented. Medical therapy was instituted to achieve controlled hypotension. The evolution was favorable and the patient could be discharged after one month. Hypertension and increased ejection fraction after transplantation could have been predisposing factors via an increase of the shear stress in the aorta.", 
    "136": "In a previous study, we have reported that thrombin stimulates phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis by phospholipase (PL) D, but has little effect on phosphoinositide hydrolysis by PLC in osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of the thrombin-induced arachidonic acid (AA) release in MC3T3-E1 cells. Thrombin stimulated AA release dose dependently in the range between 0.1 and 1 U/ml. Quinacrine, a PLA2 inhibitor, suppressed the thrombin-induced AA release. In addition, quinacrine also suppressed the thrombin-induced prostaglandin E2 synthesis in these cells. On the other hand, propranolol, which is known to inhibit phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase, did not affect the thrombin-induced AA release. 1(6-((17beta-3-Methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-yl)amino)hexyl)-1H- pyrrole-2,5-dione (U-73122), a PLC inhibitor, had no effect on the AA release by thrombin. In addition, 1,6-bis-(cyclohexyloximinocarbonylamino)-hexane (RHC-80267), a selective inhibitor of diacylglycerol lipase, had little effect on the thrombin-induced AA release. Neither propranolol, U-73122 nor RHC-80267 affect the thrombin-induced prostaglandin E2 synthesis. These results strongly suggest that thrombin induces AA release not by phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis by PLD nor phosphoinositide hydrolysis by PLC but mainly by PLA2 in osteoblast-like cells.", 
    "137": "Haemorrhage from oesophageal varices is a life-threatening event in patients with liver cirrhosis. About 40-80% of patients surviving the first bleeding suffer a recurrence within 1 year. This high recurrence rate substantially contributes to the mortality in patients with liver cirrhosis. Therefore, various treatment regimens in both primary and secondary prophylaxis were studied. Most experience in medical primary prophylaxis was collected with beta-blockers, mainly propranolol. Treating patients with oesophageal varices with propranolol significantly reduces the incidence of first variceal bleeding. However, the effect on mortality is marginal, and primary prophylaxis is generally not recommended in these patients. Several studies support the hypothesis that medical prophylaxis with beta-blockers is more effective in reducing the rate of first oesophageal bleeding in patients with a high risk of haemorrhage, such as those with very large varices with red spots. A score to assess an individual patient's risk of variceal bleeding would be helpful, but until such a score has been validated, no general rule for this treatment decision can be given. In secondary prophylaxis, both beta-blockers and endoscopic therapy (sclerotherapy or ligation of the varices) are effective in lowering the rate of rebleeding. However, the effect on mortality was not significant in most studies. Several studies comparing the efficacy of medical prophylaxis and endoscopic treatment showed advantages of the endoscopic therapy with a greater reduction in recurrent bleeding episodes. However, medical prophylaxis with beta-blockers has the important advantage of being immediately effective, whereas endoscopic procedures provide the best protection against recurrent bleeding after complete obliteration of the varices. Therefore, in the first weeks and months of endoscopic therapy, additional treatment with beta-blockers may further reduce the risk of rebleeding. Only half of all studies on this topic reported a significant advantage with this combined therapy. Therefore, it seems reasonable to restrict this approach to patients with a high risk of rebleeding, such as patients with large sclerotherapy-derived oesophageal ulcers.", 
    "138": "Three different capillary electrochromatographic methods for the enantiomer separation of beta-adrenergic antagonists (acebutolol, alprenolol, atenolol, metoprolol, pindolol, prenalterol, and propranolol) were applied using different cyclodextrins (beta-cyclodextrin, carboxymethyl-beta-cyclodextrin and dimethyl-beta-cyclodextrin) added to the electrolyte, a cross-linked protein-gel (cellobiohydrolase I) and a molecularly imprinted ((R)-enantiomer of propranolol) superporous polymer as chiral selectors. Through use of these different separation strategies, all the beta-adrenergic antagonists studied could be resolved into their enantiomers, although the three methods were carried out without extensive optimization. The protein and molecularly imprinted phases gave the highest selectivities whereas employing cyclodextrins resulted in the highest separation efficiency. Proteins and cyclodextrins are primarily natural products, albeit the cyclodextrins can be derivatized. In contrast, the molecularly imprinted chiral stationary phase can be highly customized when produced.",

Twenty-two subjects who had either a causal diastolic blood pressure of more than 105 mmHg or a left ventricular mass index (LVMI) of 125 g/m2 or more during follow-up were assigned to receive medical therapy. The other 31 men who did not meet either criterion were continuously followed-up without medication. Among the 22 treated men, the age-adjusted treadmill time (normalized treadmill time, TMTn) significantly decreased before the initiation of medication, while 31 untreated men showed no change in TMTn throughout the study. The 22 treated subjects were subsequently divided into two groups; 13 were given nifedipine and 9 were given acebutolol. All treated subjects were followed-up for more than 3 years. After treatment, the two groups showed similar reductions in blood pressure and LVMI, but a different outcome for TMTn: TMTn increased from 104 +/- 8% to 115 +/- 16% in subjects given nifedipine (p < 0.05) and decreased from 106 +/- 12% to 99 +/- 10% (p < 0.01) in those given acebutolol. Thus, the physical fitness of subjects who required medication significantly deteriorated without medication; their physical fitness improved after treatment with a calcium-channel antagonist and deteriorated after treatment with a beta-blocker.", 
    "140": "This was a randomized, cross-over experiment designed to determine which beta-adrenergic receptors, beta 1, beta 2, or both, regulate metabolic rate in humans. All subjects (3 women, 4 men) were administered a 7-d therapeutic dose of a selective beta 1-antagonist (atenolol 50 mg BID), a combined beta 1, beta 2-antagonist (propranolol 80 mg BID), and a placebo control (BID). Indirect calorimetry was determined before and after 1 h of submaximal exercise. Exercise was performed at 50% of the trial specific VO2peak because maximal exercise was significantly decreased in the presence of the nonselective beta 1, beta 2-antagonist (VO2peak placebo: 44.90 +/- 4.40 mL.kg-1.min-1 vs beta 1, beta 2-antagonism: 39.20 +/- 3.00 mL.kg-1.min-1; P < 0.05). Both the beta 1 and the combined beta 1, beta 2-adrenoreceptor antagonists reduced resting oxygen consumption to a similar extent (0.247 +/- 0.007 L.min-1 placebo, vs 0.218 +/- 0.007 L.min-1 beta 1-antagonism, vs 0.226 +/- 0.007 L.min-1 beta 1, beta 2-antagonism; P < 0.05). However, the 30-min and 60-min excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (mean EPOC) remained unchanged. It is concluded that the beta 1-receptors are regulating the effects of the sympathetic nervous system on resting but not exercise recovery metabolic rate. These metabolic side effects may suggest that changes need to be made in the nutritional requirements of patients using beta-adrenergic antagonists."
