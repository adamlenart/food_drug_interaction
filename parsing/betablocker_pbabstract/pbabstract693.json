Preliminary administration of oxotremorine and hemicholinium-3 averted PGE2 effect. The disorders of the thermo-regulation centers caused by excess PGE2 are likely to be counterbalanced by the central effect of some synaptically active drugs which affect in particular the function of cholinergic synapses and alpha-adrenoreceptors.", 
    "1": "The effect of Pindolol on myocardial infarct size was studied in 10 open chest dogs. In each animal a sequential occlusion and reperfusion of 2 medium-sized branches of the left coronary artery was performed in the same heart. After occlusion and reperfusion of the control artery the initial dose of Pindolol (0.25 mg/kg body weight) was administered. Thereafter the test artery was occluded, followed by a maintenance dose of Pindolol (0.3 mg/kg body weight). The drug caused a significant decrease in LVP and LV-dp/dt but no change in heart rate. MVO2 also decreased significantly. Regional myocardial blood flow was measured with the tracer microsphere method. Collateral flow in the perfusion area of the control artery was 11.2 +/- 5.9% and in the area of the test artery 10.0 +/- 4.4% of normal. No change in the endo/epi ratio as a result of treatment was observed. The area of infarction (p-nitroblue tetrazolium-reaction) was divided by the area of perfusion (angiography). Infarct size, expressed as the percentage of the perfusion area, was 48.2 +/- 22.2% in the region of the control artery and 43.0 +/- 23.9% in the region of the test artery. The difference was statistically not significant.", 
    "2": "With the help of a special clinico-pharmacological test arrangement on 5 test persons with healthy metabolism was proved that the oral treatment with the selective beta 1-blocker Cordanum (Talinolol, 0.3 g/die) and with the non-selective beta 1-beta 2-blocker Obsidan (Propranolol, 0.12 g/die) leads to a complete suppression of the insulin secretion which can be additionally mobilised via beta 2-adrenoreceptors in test persons with healthy metabolism. In contrast to Talinolol under the treatment ith the unspecific beta-blocker Propranolol a clear blocking of the beta 2-mediated glycogenolysis which can be evoked with the help of Orciprenalin and of the lipolysis evocable via beta 1-receptors was observed. Due to the more insignificant metabolic side-effects, with regard to an intact energy supply and the maintainance of the physical functional capacity, the selective beta 1-blocker Talinolol is preferred in the long-term therapy of cardiovascular diseases.", 
    "3": "Thirty-four patients with childhood glaucoma who had difficult management problems in spite of conventional glaucoma medications were entered into an investigational protocol designed at a time when timolol was not available commercially. Since controlled studies in adult glaucoma had demonstrated the efficacy of timolol, a trial of the drug in these difficult childhood cases seemed justified. The study was approved by the Human Studies Committees of the Children's Hospital Medical Center and the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, Boston, MA. These children have been followed for periods up to 2 1/2 years. In general, timolol was added to the maximum tolerated medical therapy. Definite improvement was noted in 10 patients, modest or equivocal improvement in 11, and in 13 no substantial benefit to their course occurred when timolol was added. youngsters over 5 years of age showed an average reduction in resting pulse rate of 6 beats/minute similar to that previously found in adult patients. Under 5 years of age no change in the resting pulse rate could be detected. One patient was discontinued from timolol for a possible adverse effect. The experience particularly in very young children is still quite limited, but the beneficial effects observed warrant further evaluation.", 
    "4": "Examination of 94 patients with stage II hypertensive disease and 20 rabbits with hypertension showed that in the hypokinetic type of hemodynamics separate medication with dibazol, papaverin hydrochloride and reserpine caused a reduction of arterial pressure in all cases due to a decrease in total peripheral resistance. In combination with phentolamine dibazol and papaverin hydrochloride caused no further decrease of arterial pressure whereas the hypotensive effect of reserpine in this case was intensified along the type of summation of hypotensive effects due to more significant decrease in total peripheral resistance. During beta-adrenostructure blocking in patients with hyperkinetic type of hemodynamics, arterial pressure dropped due to a decrease of the cardiac output. Medication with dibazol, papaverin hydrochloride and reserpine during beta-adrenergic block led to more marked drop in arterial pressure because these agents prevented an increase of total peripheral resistance encountered when only beta-adrenergic blocking agents are given.", 
    "5": "It is shown that treatment of patients with arterial hypertension with obsidan reduces arterial pressure because of a decrease in cardiac output; in treatment with pyroxan the arterial pressure is reduced due to decrease in total peripheral vascular resistance. Combined treatment with alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocking agents allows arterial pressure to be normalized with much lesser doses because the interrelationships of the principal hemodynamic values are normalized.", 
    "6": "In the canine pancreas alpha and beta adrenergic receptors exist on D cells with alpha stimulation inhibiting and beta stimulation increasing somatostatin release. There are no dopaminergic receptors on D cells. Stimulation of muscarinic receptors causes mild inhibition of somatostatin secretion. Autonomic receptors on the D cell may be physiologically stimulated in vivo via local ganglionic and/or central autonomic drivers.", 
    "7": "Previous reports suggest that in rabbit urinary bladder both noncholinergic nonadrenergic excitatory responses and the contraction produced by adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) are antagonized by indomethacin. We have attempted by further indirect testing on isolated detrusor strips to determine what role prostaglandins (PGs) might play in these processes. The second part of the biphasic contractile response to ATP was reduced to about 30% of control by PG synthesis inhibitors but the initial phase of the ATP response and te contraction produced by the beta, gamma-methylene analogue of ATP were unaffected. At concentrations that did not affect the response to acetylcholine but greatly suppressed the response to arachidonic acid, indomethacin antagonized the contraction evoked by field stimulation by about 30% at 1-2 Hz (largely noncholinergic and nonadrenergic). SC 19220, a putative PG receptor blocker, also produced about 25% reduction in the response to field stimulation but with only about 50% reduction in the response to arachidonic acid, PGE2, or PGF2alpha, SC 19220 also antagonized the frequency-response curve in atropine-treated strips. These findings lead us to suggest that beside maintaining tone and spontaneous activity in the bladder PGs mediate the slow tonic phase of the ATP response and may contribute to facilitatory modulation of noncholinergic nonadrenergic excitatory transmission.", 
    "8": "The haemodynamic effects of the new selective beta 1-receptor-agonist prenalterol were investigated in two groups each of 8 patients. Dosages of 500 microgram/5 min and 100 microgram/1 min were given after direct closure of atrial septal defect under neuroleptanalgesia. Prenalterol 500 microgram/5 min increased cardiac index (37.5%), heart rate (19%), stroke index (16.2%), mean arterial pressure (26.5%) and dp/dtmax (84.5%) significantly. Total systemic resistance, total pulmonary vascular resistance and mean pulmonary pressure remained constant. Filling pressures of both ventricles decreased slightly but significantly. Maximal hemodynamic changes after infusion of 100 microgram/1 min prenalterol were half as great as with 500 microgram/5 min and occurred 3 min earlier. The haemodynamic action of prenalterol was rather long lasting. One hour after cessation of the drug-infusion there were still detectable haemodynamic effects. In contrast to investigations in awake patients there was a greater increase in heart rate, which is referred to influences on the vagal reflex caused by anaesthesia.", 
    "9": "Early systemic hemodynamic adjustments to antihypertensive therapy with the cardioselective beta inhibitor, atenolol, were investigated in 12 hospitalized men, mean age 52 years, with uncomplicated mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. Twice daily measurements of cardiac output (CO) by CO2 rebreathing, blood pressure by cuff, and heart rate were performed in all subjects for 3 days before and 5 days after initiation of oral atenolol therapy (50 or 100 mg daily). Cardiac output by CO2 rebreathing was checked with dye dilution just before, and 4 hours and 4 days after the start of therapy. Plasma volume (radioiodinated albumin) was measured before therapy and on Day 5 of therapy. The CO results obtained with the two methods were not significantly different (r = 0.88, p less than 0.01, n = 12). A reduction in heart rate, 18 +/- 2 beats/min (mean +/- SE), occurred in all patients while taking atenolol. By 4 hours after the first dose of atenolol, CO fell from 5.49 +/- 0./30 to 4.24 +/- 0.21 liters/min (p less than 0.01), while the control mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 108 +/- 4 mm Hg was not significantly changed, 110 +/- 4 mm Hg. At 24 hours, CO returned near baseline (5.10 +/- 0.21 liters/min) but MAP was reduced (95 +/- 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) and remained so thereafter. CO remained at baseline at 48 hours (5.50 +/- 0.29 liters/min) but fell again (p less than 0.01) to 4.81 +/- 0.11 on Day 4 and to 4.68 +/- 0.25 liters/min on Day 5 of atenolol therapy. Plasma volume, 3110 +/- 100 ml before therapy, was reduced to 2850 +/- 100 by Day 5 of atenolol therapy (p less than 0.01). The findings indicate a delayed onset of the antihypertensive action of atenolol. The transient return to baseline of CO on Day 2 and 3 of atenolol therapy suggests a reverse autoregulatory adjustment to the initial fall in CO.", 
    "10": "The secretion of somatostatin-like immunoreactivity (SRIF-LI) by the isolated perfused rat stomach was studied in response to stimulation by catecholamines. Gastric SRIF-LI secretion was significantly stimulated in a dose-dependent manner by norepinephrine at 10(-6) and 10(-8) M, and the effect of norepinephrine (10(-8) M) was attenuated by the addition of propranolol (10(-6) M) but not of phentolamine (10(-6) M). SRIF-LI secretion was also stimulated by dopamine at concentrations of 10(-4) and 10(-6) M but not at 10(-8) M. The effect of dopamine (10(-6) M) was not altered by the addition of haloperidol (10(-4) to 10(-7)) or metoclopramide (10(-4) M), and bromocriptine (10(-6) M) was without effect on SRIF-LI secretion. These results suggest that gastric SRIF-LI secretion is stimulated by a beta-adrenergic mechanism and raise the possibility that gastric somatostatin contributes to the inhibitory effect of norepinephrine on gastric acid secretion.", 
    "11": "A beta-blocker, propranolol, was infused to control and irradiated rats the 1st and 3rd day after 2-kR X-ray irradiation. Blood pressure and mesenteric blood flow were recorded during infusion of biogenic amines (noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine and histamine). After beta-blockade, there was intensified increase in pressure and decrease in flow with increased overshoot after infusion of noradrenaline, no effect on the increase in pressure and flow after dopamine, but an enhanced increase in pressure and decrease in flow after serotonin. No effect on the decrease in pressure and flow was seen after acetylcholine, and a greater decrease in pressure and flow, after histamine. Irradiation altered the vascular reactivity, mainly for noradrenaline, serotonin and histamine.", 
    "12": "Initiation of prazosin therapy may be complicated by the first-dose response of acute postural hypotension and tachycardia. The effects of beta-blocker on the responses to oral prazosin were studied in eight normotensive men. After 1 mg oral prazosin there was a marked postural fall in blood pressure to a lowest mean standing systolic pressure of 88 +/- 7 mm Hg (mean +/- SD), associated with a tachycardia of 117 +/- 13 bpm, and an increase in mean plasma norepinephrine concentration to 9.6 +/- 7.9 nmole/l. There was a linear relationship (r = 0.93) between plasma prazosin concentration and hypotensive effect. Concurrent propranolol 80 mg or primidolol 100 mg (a cardioselective beta-blocker) increased the severity and duration of the postural hypotensive response, with lowest mean systolic blood pressure (BP) of 79 +/- 7 and 75 +/- 9 mm Hg. There was no effect on the orthostatic release of norepinephrine but there was attenuation of the postural tachycardia. Concurrent beta-adrenergic blocking therapy, selective or nonselective, intensifies the immediate postural hypotensive response to the initial dose of prazosin.", 
    "13": "To examine whether either the degree of existing beta adrenergic tone or the magnitude of beta adrenergic response during bronchoconstriction might account for the differences that exist between dogs in their pulmonary responsiveness to aerosol challenge with bronchoconstrictor agents, dose-response curves were performed in a group of dogs to either histamine or prostaglandin-F2 alpha, both before beta blockade with propranolol. Beta blocked had no significant effect on control values of dynamic compliance (Cdyn) or resistance of the lung (RL) or on pulmonary responsiveness to prostaglandin f2 alpha. Although propranolol did not have a significant effect on aerosol responsiveness to histamine for the group of dogs taken together, those dogs initially least responsive to aerosol histamine did become more responsive after beta blockade. This effect of beta blockade was statistically significant only for Cdyn and not for RL, suggesting enhancement of peripheral airway effects. We conclude that a beta adrenergic mechanism may contribute to the range of responsiveness found among dogs in their pulmonary responsiveness to histamine but that other as yet undefined factors must also contribute to the differences that exist among dogs in their pulmonary responsiveness to bronchoconstrictor agents.", 
    "14": "We investigated the effect of hypercholesterolemia on coronary and cardiac hemodynamic responses to intracoronary norepinephrine (NE) (0.01 to 10.0 micrograms/min as the bitartrate) in a Gregg cannula autoperfusion system. Coronary blood flow was measured by the radioactive microsphere technique in two groups of open-chest dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital: 10 controls and 8 that were fed a cholesterol-rich diet (CD) which doubled the serum cholesterol level. In the control dogs, NE in doses of 0.01 to 1.0 micrograms/min had no effect on coronary vascular resistance (CVR) but 10 micrograms/min caused a significant decrease to 0.58 +/- 0.12 of control. In the CD dogs, NE at doses of 1.0 and 10.0 micrograms/min significantly reduced CVR, to 0.72 +/- 0.06 and 0.52 +/- 0.11 of control, respectively. There was no consistent effect of NE, at these doses, on myocardial oxygen uptake, left ventricular stroke work index, or maximal positive dP/dt. In a second series of experiments we measured coronary flow with electromagnetic flowmeters in 11 chronically instrumented conscious dogs, 5 controls, and 6 CD. In the control dogs, intravenously administered NE hydrochloride, 0.01 microgram/min, reduced CVR to 0.74 +/- 0.07 of control, and 1.0 microgram/min increased CVR to 1.26 +/- 0.09 of control. In the CD animals, these effects were seen at a 10-fold lower NE dose, 0.001 microgram/min (0.83 +/- 0.11 of control) and 0.1 microgram/min (1.32 +/- 0.06 of control). The vasodilation was blocked by propranolol, and vasoconstriction by phentolamine. We conclude that NE at low doses activates beta-adrenoreceptors to reduce CVR and at higher doses activates alpha-adrenoreceptors to increase CVR; the vasoconstrictor response is inhibited in pentobarbital anesthetized dogs, and hypercholesterolemia sensitizes coronary vessels to both the dilator and constrictor effects of NE.", 
    "15": "Correlations of creatinine (Cc) and PAH (CPAI) clearance with urinary sodium (UNa) and solute (Uosm) concentrations were studied in man during hypotonic polyuria induced by 5% glucose infusion in different conditions of extracellular fluid volume. Dopamine (DA) was also infused, after an initial control period, in a subpressor dose (.1 microgram/kg.min). The correlations of Cc with both UNa and Uosm were positive in hydrosaline retention and were negative in hydrosaline depletion; DA infusion did not affect signs, but markedly increased the magnitude of both coefficients. In hydrosaline depletion with beta-adrenergic blockade the negative correlation of CPAI with Uosm was the most prominent; its coefficient was only slightly affected by DA. These findings support the hypothesis that in hydrosaline retention UNa and Uosm are controlled by glomerular filtration rate (GFR), while in hydrosaline depletion tubular (distal) fluid concentrations affect the GFR by the tubulo-glomerular feedback. In both conditions DA enhances the already operating functional features.", 
    "16": "This study was initiated to determine whether glycogen phosphorylase activation was defective in hearts of alloxan diabetic rats. When hearts were perfused by gravity flow for 1 to 10 min with various concentrations of epinephrine, activation of glycogen phosphorylase in the diabetic was significantly greater at every time and epinephrine concentration than that seen in the normal. Cyclic AMP accumulation and protein kinase activation by epinephrine in the diabetic were not appreciably different or were lower than the normal responses to the hormone. The effects of epinephrine on cAMP and protein kinase were blocked in both normal and diabetic hearts by propranolol. While the beta blocker prevented phosphorylase activation in the normal hearts, it did not block phosphorylase activation by epinephrine in the diabetic hearts. Likewise, the alpha agonist phenylephrine activated phosphorylase in the diabetic but not in the normal hearts. While glucagon produced the same phosphorylase hypersensitivity in diabetic hearts, the cAMP and protein kinase responses were not altered by diabetes. Phosphorylase phosphatase activity was found to be unaltered by either epinephrine or diabetes, whereas phosphorylase kinase activation by epinephrine in the diabetic was double the normal response. These data are consistent with a diabetes-related unmasking of an alpha effect on cardiac phosphorylase activation and an unexplained increase in the sensitivity of phosphorylase kinase activation by protein kinase.", 
    "17": "Local anaesthetics and antiarrhythmic agents produced changes in responses of rabbit platelets to ADP and thrombin that varied with the agent and its concentration. In high concentrations all local anaesthetics decreased aggregation rates. At lower concentrations several local anaesthetics increased aggregation rates. Depending on the agonist and local anaesthetic, increases were produced at all or only at low or high agonist concentrations. Local anaesthetics failed to influence shape change except at concentrations much greater than those which inhibited aggregation. Inhibition of aggregation by procaine was potentiated by small organic anions suggesting effects at different sites on the platelet membrane. The inhibitory effect of local anaesthetics was decreased by increasing Ca. Kinetic analysis indicated different mechanisms for this Ca effect, i.e., predominantly competitive for procaine or lidocaine and predominantly non-competitive for tetracaine or ethyl lidocaine. Local anaesthetics may affect aggregation by modifying the participation of Ca in this process.", 
    "18": "The effect of repeated Azosemide infusions (20 mg in 500 ml 5% glucose for one h) on urine volume and electrolyte excretion, and on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) was studied in a group of 15 patients with benign essential hypertension before and during treatment with the beta-adrenergic blocker Trimepranol. Azosemide alone had a marked but short-lasting diuretic and natriuretic effect. Repeated administration on three consecutive days led, however, to a progressive decrease in the natriuretic effectiveness of Azosemide, associated with an increase in plasma renin activity (from 0.413 o.032 to 1.631 0.438 pmol/l). Treatment with Trimepranol 20 mg/day enhanced and prolonged the diuretic and natriuretic response to Azosemide concomitantly with a reduction of its stimulatory effect of RAAS. There results suggest that stimulation of the RAAS might be responsible for the diminishing effectiveness of repeated Azosemide infusions and that the stimulation could be, at least partly, inhibited by a beta-blocker Trimepranol, resulting in a greater diuretic and natriuretic effect of Azosemide.", 
    "19": "Radioligands with high specific activity and high affinity have recently become available to study the beta-adrenergic receptor (BAR). BAR may be important in the placenta for mediating a variety of metabolic and hemodynamic effects of catecholamines including placental hormone synthesis and secretion, placental glycogenolysis, and placental blood flow. Little is known regarding the development of the BAR. We have used the tritiated radioligand dihydroalprenolol to study the ontogenesis of BAR in the fetal and maternal portions of the ovine placenta. The receptor number decreased from 415 fmoles . mg-1 of protein at 120 days' gestation to 226 fmoles . mg-1 at 145 days; this trend was highly significant (r = -0.822, p less than 0.01). Similar changes were noted in the dissociation constant. Downward regulation as a result of fetal neurosympathetic maturation is proposed as an explanation for this observation.", 
    "20": "Alinidine is a new drug which reduces heart-rate in animals by an unknown mechanism. Oral administration of 40 and 80 mg significantly reduced an exercise tachycardia in healthy people, with small reductions in heart-rate in the standing and supine positions. Alinidine 80 mg reduced arterial pressure in the standing and supine positions. The reduction in exercise tachycardia produced by 80 mg alinidine was similar to that after 40 mg propranolol, but alinidine had no effect on an isoprenaline tachycardia. These observations indicate that alinidine reduces heart-rate without blocking beta-adrenoceptors and may be useful in patients with angina and in patients with tachyarrhythmias.", 
    "21": "A questionnaire was distributed to doctors requesting reasons for cessation of therapy in patients on three drugs being intensively monitored. Adverse events were given as the reason in 20 percent of patients stopping treatment with perhexiline, 15 percent with sodium valproate and 43 percent with labetalol. These adverse events are listed and compared with those reported spontaneously to the medical assessor for the same period. Deaths reported do not appear to be drug related. Enquiry concerning reasons for cessation of therapy would appear to be a useful adjunct to spontaneous reporting of adverse events for drugs being monitored intensively. The number of additional adverse events derived from the questionnaires approximately equalled those from spontaneous reporting.", 
    "22": "The cardioselective betablocking agent metoprolol was used to treat 21 outpatients with essential arterial hypertension graded 1 and 2 of the OMS scale. The treatment was given orally for a mean duration of nine weeks at doses of 100 mg/day for two weeks and 200 mg/day for the remaining time. The treatment caused a significant reduction of systolic and diastolic arterial pressure (p less than 0.001), both in the erect and the lying down position. The heart rate was also significantly reduced both in the lying down (p less than 0.01) and the erect (p less than 0.05) positions. Metoprolol was shown to be effective and well tolerated as an antihypertensive agent; the treatment had to be interrupted in a single case because of dizziness, tiredness and dullness.", 
    "23": "The antihypertensive effects of the oral converting enzyme inhibitor captopril and of propranolol were evaluated in a single-blind trial of 12 weeks in 19 ambulatory men with moderated essential hypertension (supine diastolic blood pressure [DPB], 100 to 120 mm Hg after receiving placebo for two weeks) whose sodium intake was unrestricted. The captopril group included 12 patients and the propranolol group seven. After the initial dose-finding period of four weeks, supine DBP was significantly reduced in eight patients receiving captopril and in four of the patients receiving propranolol. In these patients DBP decreased throughout the following eight weeks. In the remaining patients from each group, DBP was not reduced by either drug given alone at maximum allowable dosages during dose-finding periods, nor by combined administration in following weeks. No adverse side effects attributable to captopril were noted, except in one patient in whom proteinuria developed after seven weeks. Captopril has potential value in the treatment of moderate essential hypertension.", 
    "24": "The ability of membrane perturbing drugs to inhibit the specific binding of [3H]/B4101 (2,6-dimethoxyphenoxyethyl)aminomethyl-1,4-benzodioxane) to the alpha 1-receptor of beef cortical membranes was determined. Except for quinidine and phenytoin, the IC50 for inhibition of specific [3H]WB4101 binding to the alpha 1-receptor correlated with the membrane/buffer partition coefficient of the drug. Almost all of the drugs inhibited specific ligand binding at concentrations approaching those reported necessary to stabilize membranes although both activities correlate well with reported membrane/buffer partition coefficients. The results suggest that specific receptor function can be modified by drug perturbation of the lipid microenvironment of the receptor macromolecule.", 
    "25": "In a total of 18 patients, 7 females and 11 male patients with ages ranging from 23 to 70 years (mean: 45.5 +/- 14.5) diagnostic His bundle studies incorporating programmed atrial and ventricular pacing for the induction of tachycardias was performed before and after betablockade with the cardioselective betablocking agent atenolol, in a dose of 5 mg given iv. over 3 to 5 minutes. In 7 patients the pacing procedure could be repeated following ergometric exercise in order to evaluate the influence of a raised sympathetic tone on the conditions initiating paroxysmal tachycardias. At rest, atenolol prevented the pacing induced tachycardias (20 dysrhythmias in 18 patients) in 3/5 individuals with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW)-syndrome, in 4/6 cases with atrial tachycardias, in 4/6 patients presenting atrial flutter, in 2/2 cases developing AV-nodal tachycardias and in 1/1 individual with ventricular tachycardia. Thus, in 13 out of 19 (68%) supraventricular dysrhythmias patients benefitted from atenolol by preventing or controlling the tachycardia. Ergometric exercise changed the tachycardia or echo zone in 5/8 arrhythmias after betablockade when compared to the controls before administration of atenolol (3/5 improvement by narrowing of the tach- or echo zone, 1/5 prevention of tachycardia, 1/5 impairment due to widening of the tachycardia zone). Considering only the prevention of tachycardias, the antiarrhythmic potency of atenolol was improved in one patient with pacing induced flutter and impaired in one individual with a WPW syndrome, by ergometric exercise. These results suggest that atenolol seems to provide a good antiarrhythmic action, especially in supraventricular tachycardias, and that an increased sympathetic tone during exercise may modify the antidysrhythmic strength of betablockade.", 
    "26": "Forced immobilization is a severe stress in rats which diminishes levels of epinephrine in specific nuclei in the hypothalamus and brain stem, suggesting that release of epinephrine is stimulated to a rate which exceeds the rate of its replacement. In the pineal gland, frog erythrocytes, C6 astrocytoma cells and rat brain, beta-adrenoceptor agonists appear to regulate the number of their receptors. Exposure to high concentrations of an agonist leads to apparent decrease in receptors reflected by a decrease in maximal specific binding of antagonists. The apparent decreases in receptors have been shown to be attended by decreases in physiologic responsiveness. In C6 astrocytoma cells, beta-agonists stimulate methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine to increase formation of membrane phosphatidylcholine which in turn appears to enhance activation of adenyl cyclase. Interference with the metabolism of phospholipids by exposure to phospholipase A2 inhibitor, mepacrine (quinacrine), prevents agonist-induced desensitization of beta-adrenoceptors in astrocytoma cells. In the present study repeated immobilization stress has been found to decrease significantly the number of beta-adrenoceptors in hypothalamus and brain stem while increasing the number of alpha 2-adrenoceptors. The desensitization of beta-adrenoceptors was prevented by treatment with mepacrine.", 
    "27": "Helically cut strips of dog renal and cerebral (basilar and middle cerebral) arteries contracted with prostaglandin (PG) F2 alpha relaxed in response to angiotensin II (AII; 10(-9) to 10(-7) M) in a dose-dependent manner. In renal arterial strips, the relaxation was preceded by a transient contraction. Both the relaxation and the contraction induced by AII were suppressed by [Sar1,Ala8]AII or [Sar1,Ile8]AII. Treatment with propranolol, atropine, hexamethonium, cocaine, aminophylline, cimetidine, or ouabain failed to alter the relaxing effect of AII. The peptide-induced relaxation was reversed to a contraction by aspirin or indomethacin. Treatment with tranylcypromine or 15-hydroperoxy arachidonic acid suppressed the relaxation induced by AII in renal and cerebral arteries but did not alter relaxations induced by PGI2 or K+ (5 mM). In experiments with superfused dog renal and coronary arteries and rat stomach strips, the renal arteries in response to AII released a prostaglandin like substance; the release was suppressed by [Sar1,Ala8]AII or indomethacin. It appears that the relaxation of isolated dog renal and cerebral arteries induced by AII is mediated by the release of PGI2, which is associated with stimulation of AII receptors.", 
    "28": "Dipivefrin, an epinephrine prodromal drug, was used in conjunction with timolol maleate to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of combined therapy. Seventeen patients who had used timolol maleate for at least six months added dipivefrin (Group 1) and seven patients who had used dipivefrin for at least six months added timolol maleate (Group 2). Intraocular pressure decreased further in both groups. Side effects were most prominent in Group 1.", 
    "29": "A variety of tests are being utilized today to diagnose the presence of ischemic heart disease, assess the prognosis of myocardial and valvular heart disease and evaluate the effects of various pharmacologic agents on cardiac performance. This review summarizes the current evidence regarding the response of left ventricular performance and size to atrial pacing, afterload stress and various forms of exercise. The responses in normal persons and in subjects with coronary heart disease is reviewed and, when applicable, the effects of various pharmacologic agents on exercise performance in these patient groups are examined.", 
    "30": "To provide improved inotropic agents for enhanced therapy of severe congestive heart failure (CHF), the hemodynamic efficacy of prenalterol (PN), a recently developed cardioselective beta-1 receptor agonist, was evaluated by cardiac catheterization in nine patients with refractory CHF due to chronic coronary disease. PN (4.8 mg intravenously) markedly augmented the cardiac index from 1.9 to 2.6 L/min/m2 (p less than 0.01) and substantially elevated stroke index from 24 to 30 ml/beat/m2 (p less than 0.001). Additionally, PN raised stroke work index 21 to 26 gm.m/m2 (p less than 0.005) and decreased total systemic vascular resistance from 1,702 to 1,260 dynes-sec cm(-5) (p less than 0.001). Concomitantly, heart rate, mean blood pressure, and left ventricular filling pressure were unaltered ( p greater than 0.05). Importantly, the heart rate-systolic blood pressure product was unchanged (p less than 0.05), and precipitation of cardiac dysrhythmias or myocardial ischemia was not observed. Thus PN produced considerable improvement of depressed cardiocirculatory performance without untoward effects and thereby appears a valuable new cardiotonic in the clinical management of severe low output ventricular dysfunction.", 
    "31": "The purpose of the present study was to compare the effect of equivalent decreases in heart rate produced by sotalol and bilateral vagal stimulation on regional myocardial blood flow and coronary perfusion pressure distal to a severe stenosis of the left circumflex coronary artery in anesthetized dogs. Tissue blood flow was measured with radioactive microspheres (15 mu). Vagal stimulation or beta adrenergic blockade produced by sotalol (1.0 mg/kg i.v.) reduced heart rate approximately 35 beats/min. This decrease in rate was accompanied by nearly equivalent increases (P less than 0.05) in diastolic perfusion time and subendocardial blood flow and in the ischemic region. Both interventions also significantly increased the oxygen supply-demand balance (distal diastolic pressure time index divided by the tension time index) in the ischemic region. These values returned to control after cessation of vagal stimulation or during atrial pacing to predrug heart rate. Coronary perfusion pressure distal to the stenosis increased significantly only in the sotalol-treated group. These results suggest that a decrease in heart rate and increase in diastolic perfusion time are important factors in the favorable redistribution of ischemic myocardial blood flow and increase in the oxygen supply-demand balance observed after beta adrenergic blockade with sotalol or after vagal stimulation. Whether these beneficial actions are solely due to the prolonged diastolic perfusion period or to reduced oxygen demand and a return to autoregulation in the ischemic area cannot be determined with certainty.", 
    "32": "The effects of acute volume loading were examined on indices of left ventricular (LV) function in conscious, unrestrained and intact, tranquilized baboons. Experiments were conducted 1-3 mo after implantation of ultrasonic transducers to measure LV internal diameter and wall thickness, and miniature LV pressure gauges and aortic and left atrial catheters. In 10 intact, tranquilized baboons, rapid volume loading with saline increased LV end-diastolic pressure by 23.7+/-2.6 mm Hg, LV end-diastolic diameter by 7.8+/-1.5%, LV stroke work by 37.5+/-7.8%, while mean arterial pressure and peak LV wall stress did not change significantly. Despite the increase in preload and activation of the Frank-Starling mechanism, LV dP/dt(max) and the maximum velocity of myocardial fiber shortening (LV dD/dt(max)) did not change. Volume loading after beta-adrenergic or combined beta-adrenergic and cholinergic blockades or volume loading with blood instead of saline also failed to augment LV dP/dt(max) and LV dD/dt(max) despite the increase in preload. In order to volume load the baboons in the conscious state, a radiofrequency (RF) interrogator system was devised, which upon receipt of a radio command, activated a battery operated pump to infuse 1,000 ml of saline i.v. to the baboons. In these experiments, preload rose, i.e., LV end-diastolic diameter increased by 13.9+/-2.1% and the Frank-Starling mechanism could be demonstrated, i.e., stroke work rose by 42.8+/-7.4%, but LV dP/dt(max) and LV dD/dt(max) did not change. After preload was depressed by hemorrhage, the rapid infusion of either blood or saline increased LV dP/dt(max) by 92.7+/-18.5% and LV dD/dt(max) by 64.3+/-10.1%. Thus, acute volume loading in the conscious baboons increased LV end-diastolic size and even stroke work substantially. However, preload dependency of LV dP/dt(max) and the maximum velocity of myocardial fiber shortening was only encountered at low levels of LV preload.", 
    "33": "We assessed the effects of acebutolol, a cardioselective beta blocker, on global and regional left ventricular function in 26 patients with chronic angina pectoris. All patients underwent rest and maximal supine bicycle exercise radionuclide angiography while on placebo and oral acebutolol (400 mg three times a day). Resting ejection fraction on placebo was 51 +/- 3% and on acebutolol was 54 +/- 3% (p less than 0.05). No resting ejection fraction decreased greater than or equal to 7%. Only one patient (resting ejection fraction 28% on placebo and 21% on acebutolol) developed signs of fluid retention. Exercise nuclear studies on placebo revealed responses consistent with coronary artery disease (abnormal ejection fraction response to exercise and regional wall motion abnormalities) in 24 of 26 patients. Peak exercise ejection fraction was of the same order on placebo and acebutolol (51 +/- 3% and 54 +/- 3%, p = NS). In four patients the ejection fraction response to exercise became normal and in five patients all regional wall motion abnormalities became normal on acebutolol. Cardioselective beta blockade with acebutolol in effective antianginal doses is safe and may improve resting and exercise ventricular function.", 
    "34": "Signs consistent with the propranolol withdrawal rebound syndrome may occur when propranolol hydrochloride administration is temporarily discontinued because of major noncardiac surgical procedures. The time course of the appearance of these signs indicates that the risk of the propranolol withdrawal rebound syndrome peaks about four to seven days after drug discontinuation. Continuation of propranolol up to the time of surgery appears safe from an anesthetic standpoint and may also help to postpone the risk of the withdrawal rebound syndrome until after oral propranolol therapy can be reinstituted.", 
    "35": "The authors successfully treated four patients who had irreversible CNS lesions and socially disabling aggressiveness and outbursts of rage, which had not been affected by high doses of major tranquilizers or anticonvulsants, with 320-520 mg/day of propranolol. Disorientation, memory impairment, and psychotic thought processes associated with the CNS lesions were not altered by the propranolol.", 
    "36": "The mean hepatic extraction ratio (ER) of propranolol depending on the inflowing blood concentration to the liver was estimated directly by simultaneous measurements of arterial, hepatoportal, and hepatic venous blood concentrations of the drug following intravenous, intraportal, and intraduodenal administration in the rat. It was shown that the inflowing blood concentration to the liver caused considerable variation depending on the route of administration. The mean hepatic extraction ratio of propranolol in the first pass through the liver (ER)fipv and that of the drug after escaping the hepatic first-pass metabolism (ER)ripv were assessed by simultaneous administration of intraportal unlabelled propranolol and intravenous 14C-propranolol over a 50-min period. Consequently, a relation of (ER)fipv less than (ER)ipv less than (ER)ripv was observed in higher propranolol doses, if (ER)ipv refers to the overall mean hepatic extraction ratio following intraportal administration of propranolol. The fraction of orally administered dose reaching the systemic circulation for a drug exhibiting nonlinear hepatic first-pass metabolism was discussed. The unusual AUC-dose relationship of propranolol reported previously in the rat could be explained on the basis of both the nonlinear hepatic first-pass metabolism and the nonlinear hepatic metabolism of drug surviving the hepatic first-pass metabolism.", 
    "37": "The metabolism of propranolol, alprenolol and oxprenolol was studied in the dog and rat; propranolol in five additional species, including man. Basic, phenolic and neutral metabolites were extracted from urine at pH 9.6 after enzymatic hydrolysis. Separation and identification of parent drug and seven metabolites each for propranolol, alprenolol and oxprenolol in the dog were accomplished by gas chromatography mass spectrometry as the trifluoroacetyl derivatives. A very uniform and predictable fragmentation pattern was observed for all 24 compounds. Seven new metabolites were identified. The metabolism of all three drugs was qualitatively the same, including N-dealkylation followed by N-methylation or deamination of the primary amines. The parent drugs as well as all of their sidechain metabolism products were also partially ring hydroxylated. N-Methylation was only found in the dog and is a minor metabolic pathway. The stereochemical composition of N-methyldesisopropylpropranolol and its immediate precursor N-desisopropylpropranolol showed a marked enrichment of the (+)-isomer.", 
    "38": "Chronic toxicity and recovery tests of labetalol hydrochloride, alpha-and beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, were carried out using male and female Wistar strain rats. The drug was orally administered at 50, 100 or 200 mg/kg/day for 9 months. In all the drug-treated groups, increase in salivation was observed from immediately after to 15 minutes after dosing through treatment period. Suppression of body weight gain was observed in male rats in the 200 mg/kg/day group. Food comsumption tended to be higher in all the drug-treated groups than in the control group. Similar trend was seen also in water comsumption, and increase in urine volume was noted in the groups treated with 100 and 200 mg/kg/day. In the serum biochemical examination, dose-dependent elevation in potassium level was noted in all drug-treated groups, but the values were within the range of physiological variation. In the 100 and 200 mg/kg/day groups, an increase was observed in the absolute heart weight and in its relative weight against body weight. Major abnormalities found in histopathological findings were; swelling of parenchymatous cells in liver and kidney, swelling of fibers and swelling or proliferation of interstitial cells in cardiac and skeletal muscles, and congestion in spleen. No notable abnormality was found in any examination item in the recovery test.", 
    "39": "Effects of local anesthetics (procaine, lidocaine, prilocaine, mepivacaine and bupivacaine) on the sinus node of the nerve-intact dog heart were studied in situ by means of selective perfusion of the sinus node through the sinus node artery. The agents caused a dose-dependent decrease in heart rate and the order of their potency in decreasing the heart rate was as follows, bupivacaine greater than lidocaine=mepivacaine=prilocaine greater than procaine. The decrease in heart rate produced by these local anesthetics was not affected by prior administration of atropine. With procaine and prilocaine, the decrease in heart rate was followed by an increase which was inhibited by propranolol given into the sinus node artery or was suppressed in reserpine-pretreated dogs. Tetrodotoxin also prevented the positive chronotropic effect of procaine. From these results the following conclusion can be drawn: the negative chronotropic effects of these agents are induced mainly by a direct inhibitory action on the sinus node, and partly by blockade of sympathetic tone, and the interaction with the postganglionic adrenergic nerves plays an important role in the induction of the positive chronotropic responses to procaine and prilocaine.", 
    "40": "In order to investigate the physiological role of endogenous opioid substances in the regulation of gonadotropin secretion, we studied the effect of Naltrexone (Nalt), a morphine antagonist, on serum luteinizing hormone(LH) concentrations in ovariectomized estrogen-treated rats. The site of action of Nalt and its interaction with other putative neurotransmitters on LH secretion were investigated in hypothalamic deafferentated rats and in animals treated with pharmacological inhibitors of the actions of neurotransmitter substances. Nalt injection increased serum LH levels at dosed 0.08 to 2 mg/kg BW. The response was dose-dependent but higher doses of Nalt had less effect. In inducing this response pattern, mediobasal connection between the anterior hypothalamus and the mediobasal hypothalamus was essential, but posterior input to the mediobasal hypothalamus was not necessary. Excepting alpha-adrenergic blocker, all the blockers used, i.e beta-adrenergic, serotonin, dopamine and acetylcholine blockers were effective in eliminating the LH release evoked by Nalt injection. These results suggest that endogenous opioid substances might inhibit LH secretion tonically through aminergic and/or cholinergic neurons and that the mediobasal neural connections to the mediobasal hypothalamus are indispensable for this inhibition.", 
    "41": "1. The effects of single oral doses of various sympatholytic drugs on the heart rate and blood pressure increases during isometric handgrip contraction were studied in six healthy subjects. 2. Bethanidine reduced both the systolic and diastolic increases in pressure. Clonidine reduced the systolic but not the diastolic increase. Oxprenolol alone or in combination with phentolamine or phenyoxybenzamine failed to influence the pressor response. 3. The increase in systemic blood pressure associated with sustained contraction of voluntary muscle appears to be relatively resistant to acute sympathetic adrenoreceptor blockade in man.", 
    "42": "The pharmacological responses of vascular adrenergic receptors to intravenously administered epinephrine, phentolamine, and propranolol were assessed by measuring muscle blood flow (MBF) changes in the tibialis anterior muscle using the xenon 133 clearance technique and were compared in 8 normal subjects and 11 patients with myotonic dystrophy. In cases with advanced involvement of the muscle, the resting MBF was reduced and was not significantly altered by epinephrine before or after alpha- or beta-receptor blockade. In patients in whom the tibialis anterior muscle was normal or only minimally affected clinically, a paradoxical reduction in the epinephrine-induced increase in MBF was found after alpha blockade by phentolamine, and the epinephrine-induced MBF increase was not completely blocked by propranolol as in the normal subjects. These findings point to functional alteration in the properties of vascular adrenergic receptors in muscle in myotonic dystrophy. While this may be another manifestation of a widespread cell membrane defect in the disease, the possibility that the changes are secondary to the myotonic state cannot be excluded.", 
    "43": "Untolerated or insufficiently effective Therapy in 32 patients (63 eyes) with primary open-angle glaucoma was discontinued and substituted with Timolol, and all patients were followed up over a period of 60 weeks. Timolol was well tolerated in all cases without any local or systemic side effects. Either alone or in combination with other medications Timolol brought about an adequate reduction in intraocular pressure in eyes which hitherto had no longer responded to conventional conservative therapy.", 
    "44": "Three families with the syndrome of hereditary prolonged QT interval affecting 12 members in two or three generations are described. Four patients with sinus bradycardia and frequent syncopal attacks were investigated by Holter-monitoring, His-bundle electrograms and exercise testing. Corrected QT intervals (QTc) were prolonged from 0.43 to 0.54 seconds at rest. In His-bundle electrograms, during atrial pacing at increasing rates the function of the entire conduction system seemed to be affected. Three patients were treated with pindolol and one patient with a permanent demand pacemaker and pindolol. During progressive exercise testing performed after drug therapy or pacemaker treatment, heart rate increased unsatisfactorily and QTc-intervals lengthened whereas atrial stimulation QTc-intervals remained unchanged. In the patient with a permanent demand pacemaker, electrocardiographic monitoring revealed a period of 25 seconds of ventricular tachycardia occurring at rest and ceasing spontaneously. In the past 1.2 years to 2.5 years (mean 2.1 years) of outpatient follow-up, the patients had normal exercise tolerance and syncopal attacks did not occur on pindolol 30 mg/day. Our findings suggest rather a hypersensitivity of the affected conclusion system in the presence of a normal activity of cardiac sympathetic nerves.", 
    "45": "The pharmacokinetics of timolol, after oral administration of single 20 mg doses to healthy subjects, has been studied using an original electron beam ionization GLC-mass spectrometry technique with computer -- controlled multiple ion detection. This method of mass fragmentography, tested with propranolol as an internal standard, permitted the measurement of timolol concentrations as low as 1 ng/ml with good precision and accuracy. It enabled the plasma level to be followed up to the twelfth hour after treatment. Individual variation was observed in bioavailability; the peaks plasma concentration (Cmax) of 50 to 103 ng/ml being achieved at different times(0.5--3h). The residual level after 12 h differed greatly between the subjects (0.8 to 7.2 ng/ml). The mean half-life of the terminal elimination phase was 2.62 +/- 0.17 h. Extra-renal elimination (metabolic and biliary) represented the main route of elimination, with a renal to body clearance ratio of 0.123. This level paralleled the percentage of unaltered timolol excreted in urine 24 h after its administration.", 
    "46": "Atenolol, Pindolol and Propranolol in single daily doses administered to 18 selected patients with mild essential hypertension achieved adequate control of blood pressure. Chlorothiazide had been initially administered twice a day without full control of blood pressure and this diuretic therapy was continued unaltered throughout the study. Methacholine challenge testing of respiratory function was performed during the placebo phase and with each beta adrenoreceptor-blocking drug. In the 18 non-asthmatic patients, the reduction in FEV1, was significant only for propranolol therapy when compared to placebo. Each beta adrenoreceptor-blocking drug was associated with small, but significant, increases in fasting plasma triglyceride concentrations and suppression of fasting immuno-reactive glucagon concentrations.", 
    "47": "A fixed combination tablet containing 5 mg of timolol, 25 mg of hydralazine, 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide and 37.5 mg of triamterene was prepared and its antihypertensive effect compared with placebo in a randomized double-blind cross-over study lasting 16-20 weeks. 37 patients entered the study and 32 of them completed it. The trial drug caused a highly significant drop in blood pressure in both the supine and standing positions (from 172/112 to 142/91 mm Hg supine and from 168/17 to 136/100 mm Hg standing). There was also a highly significant fall in heart rate. Three patients were nonresponders with maximal dose used (4 tablets daily) and two patients had to withdraw from the trial because of complications. In general the side effects recorded were mild and equally common both on placebo and the trial drug. The serum potassium level was well maintained. The serum urate concentration was increased, but no signs of gout were observed. The conclusion was that this fixed combination of timolol, hydralazine, hydrochlorothiazide and triamterene is effective and well tolerated in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension.", 
    "48": "The effects of 45 mg pindolol daily on blood pressure, heart rate, plasma renin activity, and plasma catecholamines were assessed on 11 hospitalized hypertensive patients. Blood pressure decreased significantly after nine days of treatment, but heart rate remained unchanged. Plasma renin activity was in the same average range before and during treatment, with individual values variably increasing, decreasing, or remaining unchanged. Blood pressure changes were independent from the baseline level of plasma renin activity or the change in renin activity observed during treatment. Plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine levels also remained unchanged during treatment. Lack of change in heart rate and hormonal levels may be attributed to the combined effects of the beta-antagonistic and partial agonistic properties of this agent. Thus, pindolol used as monotherapy at this dose significantly lowered blood pressure, but not to normal levels, with only minimal side effects. Because of its combined adrenergic agonistic and antagonistic effects, it may be a preferable alternative to pure antagonists in selected patients.", 
    "49": "Ten patients with ocular hypertension or glaucoma were treated over 4 months with the betablocker Metoprolol tartrate as 3% eye drops twice daily. Intraocular pressures were significantly lowered by the drug in all patients throughout the study. The mean initial IOP response was 36% relative decrease, the maintenance IOP decrease ranged between 23 and 30%. There was partial loss of the initial response within the first weeks of treatment. Topical Metoprolol treatment possibly affects systolic blood pressure and heart rate. There had been no objective side effects of Metoprolol treatment. The most common subjective side effects were burning, itching and tearing. The therapeutic significance of the results is discussed.", 
    "50": "In 53 chloralose-anesthetized dogs, the actions of glucose (10 mg/kg per min), insulin (0.025 U/kg per min) and potassium (0.025 mEq/kg per min) on the ventricular fibrillation and repetitive extrasystole thresholds were examined. Measurements were initially made in the control state and then repeated at 30, 60 and 120 minutes of infusion of glucose-insulin-potassium solution at a constant rate of 1.23 ml/min. The dogs received on the average 36 g of glucose, 44 U of insulin and 44 mEq of potassium over a 2 hour period. In the nonischemic myocardium, the infusion raised the threshold for ventricular fibrillation and repetitive extrasystole to a peak of 94 and 61 percent, respectively, without significantly changing serum potassium or circulating catecholamine concentration. In the ischemic myocardium, the incidence of spontaneous ventricular fibrillation during 10 minutes of coronary occlusion was reduced from 83 percent in the control state to 17 percent with glucose-insulin-potassium infusion. However, the infusion did not alter the incidence of ventricular fibrillation associated with reperfusion. Because cardio-cardiac sympathetic reflexes are elicited in response to coronary occlusion, the effect of glucose-insulin-potassium infusion on ventricular vulnerability during left stellate ganglion stimulation and norepinephrine infusion was investigated. The infusion completely prevented the reduction in the vulnerable period threshold during stellate stimulation and norepinephrine infusion. Furthermore, the peak protection afforded by the infusion was greater than that achieved with beta adrenergic blockade and was still present in catecholamine-depleted hearts. It is concluded that infusion of glucose-insulin-potassium solution protects against ventricular fibrillation in the normal and ischemic canine heart but not during reperfusion. This protection may be due in part to antagonism of adrenergic activity; however, the primary influence of the solution is mediated by extra-adrenergic mechanism.", 
    "51": "Eight patients who improved their exercise duration to angina or marked fatigue (greater than or equal to 25%) on timolol 10 to 30 mg twice daily over that on placebo 8 to 14 mo previously were subjects in a double-blind, randomized, crossover 4-wk study of the effect of timolol on exercise duration 2 and 12 hr after medication. One patient was discontinued from the study because unstable angina developed on placebo. Mean exercise duration on timolol over control was increased at 12 hr (p less than 0.02) and at 2 hr ( p less than 0.001) after drug. There was an increase in exercise duration greater than or equal to 25% on timolol over control compared with placebo in three of seven patients (43%) 12 hr after drug and in seven of seven (100%) 2 hr after drug. Timolol 10 to 30 mg twice daily prolongs exercise duration to angina or marked fatigue at 2 hr after drug and in some responders at 12 hr after drug.", 
    "52": "An intraperitoneal administration of large doses of L-5-hydroxytryptophan (L-5HTP) induced dose-dependently a behaviour characterized by backward walking in mice. D-5-hydroxytryptophan (D-5HTP) and L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) in the same doses failed to induce such behaviour. The backward walking induced by L-5HTP was blocked by a decarboxylase inhibitor, DL-alpha-methyl-DOPA, but was potentiated by a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), tranylcypromine or pargyline. An intracerebral injection of L-5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) induced a similar backward walking which was potentiated by a MAOI. The backward walking induced by L-5HTP was completely inhibited by 5-HT and dopamine (DA) receptor blockers, but was not inhibited by alpha- or beta-adrenergic blocker, antihistamine or anticholinergic drug. On the other hand, zimelidine and clomipramine, 5-HT uptake inhibitors, markedly potentiated the backward walking, while desipramine had no effect. From the results, it appears that excess amounts of 5-HT formed from L-5HTP produced the backward walking by directly stimulating the central 5-HT receptors, and DA is also involved in the behaviour. This behaviour may serve as a good model to assess the central serotonergic activity of drugs.", 
    "53": "The redistribution of lymphocyte surface immunoglobulin (Ig) induced by anti-Ig antibody or bound sheep erythrocyte antigen (capping) was inhibited reversibly by hydrocortisone succinate (2 x 10(-4) M). Capping inhibition was also effected by cholesterol and progesterone, favoring the hypothesis that the effect was mediated through changes in the physical properties of the cell membrane rather than hormonal action. Capping was also inhibited by propranolol at concentrations where it may exert a local anesthetic as well as a beta-adrenergic blocking effect (2 x 10(-4) M). Since a fourfold excess of the beta agonist isoproterenol failed to restore capping in the presence of propranolol, the local anesthetic mode of action is most likely. Nitroprusside, an inhibitor of contraction in vascular smooth muscle and platelets, failed to inhibit capping."
