This report reviews our experience with tilt testing all patients who presented with syncope during a 3-year period. All patients referred for evaluation of syncope who underwent tilt testing were retrospectively reviewed. Follow-up was obtained at return visits or by telephone interview. Sixty patients were identified. The average age was 13.5 +/- 3.0 years. Twenty-six patients (43%) had positive tilt tests. Follow-up was available for 56 patients. Twelve of these patients had causes other than NMS found for their symptoms. The remaining 44 patients all had histories consistent with NMS. Nineteen of these patients had positive tilt tests. All 44 patients reported either a decrease or no recurrence of syncope, and 41 patients reported a decrease or no recurrence of presyncopal symptoms. Recurrence of syncope or symptoms was not related to the results of the tilt test. Twenty-five of the 44 patients used conservative measures (extra fluids or supplemental salt) and only 3 patients were taking medications. The use of conservative measures or medications was not related to the tilt test results. Tilt testing has a high false-negative and false-positive rate and should not be used as the standard for identifying patients with NMS. The long-term follow-up of patients with NMS demonstrates that regardless of the results of the tilt test, almost all have improved or resolved symptoms with simple interventions.", 
    "1": "Propranolol, its 1\"-mono-, di-, and trifluorinated analogs, and other related compounds were analyzed under electrospray ionization ion trap collision-induced dissociation (ESI-CID) and electron impact (EI) conditions. Interesting trends were observed in the fragment ions formed in both cases. Under ESI conditions, the abundances of product ions easily explained by protonation on the amine nitrogen decreased relative to the abundances of those formed from the ether-protonated species as the number of fluorines increased from zero to three. Under EI conditions, the distribution of fragment ions was shifted away from those arising from a nitrogen-centered cation radical and toward those arising from an ether oxygen-centered cation radical. The changes observed in apparent molecular sites of protonation and of ion radical formation in the mass spectra are consistent with the electron-withdrawing effects of the sequentially added fluorines. These effects are correlated with changes in solution phase pK( a)'s of the fluorinated amines.", 
    "2": "Isoeugenolol (1.0, 3.0, 5.0 mg/kg, i.v.) produced a dose-dependent bradycardia and a decrease in blood pressure in anesthetized Wistar rats. Isoeugenolol inhibited the tachycardia effects induced by (-)isoproterenol, but had no blocking effect on the arterial pressor responses induced by (-)phenylephrine. In isolated guinea pig tissues, isoeugenolol antagonized (-)isoproterenol-induced positive inotropic and chronotropic effects on the atria and tracheal relaxations in a concentration-dependent manner. The apparent pA2 values for isoeugenolol on right atria, left atria and trachea were 7.63+/-0.03, 7.89+/-0.12 and 6.12+/-0.05, respectively, indicating that isoeugenolol was a highly selective beta1-adrenoceptor blocker. On the other hand, isoeugenolol produced a mild direct cardiac depression at high concentration and was without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA). In isolated rat thoracic aorta, isoeugenolol relaxed more potently the contractions induced by (-)phenylephrine (10 microM) and 5-HT (10 microM) than those by high K+ (75 mM). In isolated guinea pig trachea, isoeugenolol attenuated the carbachol (1 microM)-con-tracted trachea more significantly than those contracted with high K+. Furthermore, the binding characteristics of isoeugenolol and various beta-adrenoceptor antagonists were evaluated in [3H]CGP-12177 binding to rat ventricle, lung and interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT) membranes. The -log IC50 values of isoeugenolol for predominate beta1-, beta2- and beta3-adrenergic receptor sites were 5.82+/-0.09, 4.74+/-0.05 and 4.73+/-0.12, respectively. In conclusion, isoeugenolol was found to be a highly selective beta1-adrenoceptor antagonist with tracheal and vascular smooth muscle relaxant activities, but was devoid of alpha-adrenoceptor-blocking action.", 
    "3": "The role of serotonin autoreceptor antagonism in major depression has been a matter of intense debate in recent years. On the basis of animal experiments, it has been suggested that the blockade of this autoreceptor with pindolol during concomitant treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) would result in a rapid and augmented antidepressant effect, but it has also been argued that the possible augmenting effect of pindolol is due to the beta-blocking properties of this drug. Results from the first human studies have also been controversial. We used a national computer-based central register to study the cumulative incidence of the use of beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists and antidepressant drugs, as well as the point prevalence of disability pensions as a result of major affective disorders (296, DSM-III-R; F30-F34, ICD-10) at the end of a 3-year follow-up period. Our results from a very large database (total N = 30,485) indicate that the use of pindolol is associated with a marked reduction (from 29% to 52%) in the prevalence of disability pensions resulting from major affective disorders when compared with the use of other beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists. The use of pindolol was associated with a slightly lower rate of antidepressant use when compared with other beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists and especially when compared with propranolol. The results suggest that long-term therapy with pindolol treatment augments the pharmacologic effect of antidepressant drugs (especially SSRIs) among patients with major affective disorders. The finding that patients receiving pindolol have a lower prevalence of disability pensions resulting from major affective disorders indicates that the prevalence of severe treatment-resistant major affective disorders could be decreased markedly by using pindolol as the first-choice beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases whenever possible among those patients who have experienced at least one depressive episode and are receiving antidepressant treatment.", 
    "4": "The safety and pharmacodynamic compatibility of clopidogrel with medications commonly used in patients with atherosclerosis, such as, a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist (atenolol) and a calcium uptake inhibitor (nifedipine) were assessed. Atenolol and nifedipine interactions with clopidogrel were studied in patients with peripheral arterial obstructive disease taking a well-established regimen of nifedipine (N group of 6 patients) and in patients with coronary artery disease taking a well-established regimen of either atenolol (A group of 8 patients) or of atenolol and nifedipine (AN group of 8 patients). The study was conducted as a double-blind, randomized, crossover comparison of clopidogrel, 75 mg once daily, and placebo treatment for 7 days, with a 14-day washout between treatments. Pharmacodynamic interactions between atenolol and nifedipine, either alone or in combination, and clopidogrel were assessed primarily on the clinical control of angina or hypertension and, secondarily, by comparing the extent of inhibition of ADP (5 microM)-induced platelet aggregation achieved between the 3 groups. The mean number of anginal episodes per patient during the placebo week was 1.50, 9.0 and 11.5 in the A, N and AN groups, respectively; during the week of clopidogrel treatment, it was 1.39, 7.3 and 9.0, respectively, indicating no change in occurrence. Likewise, review of the use of nitrates (long or short acting) did not suggest any major change in usage during any period of the study. ECGs did not change between the three recording times (at screening and at the end of each treatment period). Vital signs were also unchanged throughout. Percent inhibition of platelet aggregation on day 7 was 31% in the N group, 39% in the A group, 28% in the AN group, and 33% overall. In conclusion, the coadministration of clopidogrel did not interfere with the clinical control of hypertension or angina established with atenolol or nifedipine, or both. Clopidogrel retained its full antiplatelet effect, and there were no safety problems caused by the coadministration.",

    "15": "Carvedilol ((+/-)-1-(carbazol-4-yloxy)-3-[[2-(o-methoxyphenoxy)ethyl]am ino]-2-propanol), a beta-adrenoceptor-blocking agent with vasodilator properties, has been reported to produce dose-related improvements in left ventricular function and reduction in mortality in patients with chronic heart failure. However, its electrophysiological effects have not been elucidated. We studied ion channel and action potential modulation by carvedilol in rabbit ventricular preparations using whole-cell voltage-clamp and standard microelectrode techniques. In ventricular myocytes, carvedilol blocked the rapidly activating component of the delayed rectifier K+ current (I(Kr)) in a concentration-dependent manner (IC50 = 0.35 microM). This block was voltage- and time-independent; a prolongation of the depolarizing pulses from a holding potential of -50 mV to +10 mV within the range of 100-3000 ms did not affect the extent of I(Kr) block. Carvedilol also inhibited the L-type Ca2+ current (I(Ca)), the transient outward K+ current (I(to)) and the slowly activating component of the delayed rectifier K+ current (I(Ks)) with IC50 of 3.59, 3.34, and 12.54 microM, respectively. Carvedilol (0.3-30 microM) had no significant effects on the inward rectifier K+ current. In papillary muscles from rabbits pretreated with reserpine, action potential duration was prolonged by 7-12% with 1 microM and by 12-24% with 3 microM carvedilol at stimulation frequencies of 0.1-3.0 Hz. No further action potential duration prolongation was observed at concentrations higher than 3 microM. These results suggest that concomitant block of K+ and Ca2+ currents by carvedilol resulted in a moderate prolongation of action potential duration with minimal reverse frequency-dependence. Such electrophysiological effects of carvedilol would be beneficial in the treatment of ventricular tachyarrhythmias.", 
    "16": "The atypical beta-adrenoceptors mediating relaxation in the guinea pig duodenum were studied using catecholamines (isoprenaline, noradrenaline and adrenaline), a selective beta3-adrenoceptor agonist BRL37344 ((R*,R*)-(+/-)-4-[2-[(2-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl)amino]propyl]phe noxyacetic acid sodium salt) and a non-conventional partial beta3-adrenoceptor agonist CGP12177A ((-)-4-(3-t-butylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy)benzimidazol-2-one)). Catecholamines and beta3-adrenoceptor agonists induced concentration-dependent relaxation in this preparation. Propranolol (1 microM) produced only small rightward shifts in the concentration-response curves of these agonists. In the presence of propranolol (1 microM), however, a non-selective beta1-, beta2- and beta3-adrenoceptor antagonist bupranolol caused a concentration-dependent rightward shift of the concentration-response curves for catecholamines and beta3-adrenoceptor agonists. Schild plot analyses of the effects of bupranolol against these agonists gave pA2 values of 6.02 (isoprenaline), 5.98 (noradrenaline), 5.93 (adrenaline), 6.51 (BRL37344) and 5.70 (CGP12177A), respectively, and all Schild slopes were not significantly different from unity. These results suggest that atypical beta-adrenoceptors are present in the guinea pig duodenum and involved in mediating the functional relaxant response.", 
    "17": "Violent behavior in psychiatric patients may result in long-term hospitalization. There is no FDA-approved psychopharmacologic treatment for aggression. In this study, 20 chronically aggressive hospitalized patients were administered 1 week of placebo followed by an open trial of increasing doses of propranolol. Patients who had an equivocal or definite clinical response were entered into an open add-on double-blind discontinuation study phase. Aggressive behavior was objectively documented throughout the study. After the open phase of the study, 7 patients had a greater than 50% decrease in aggressive behavior. Four patients entered the double-blind discontinuation phase. The clinical course of 3 of those patients was consistent with the positive response to propranolol. The results of this study are consistent with a therapeutic effect of propranolol in some patients with aggressive behavior. Further studies are indicated.", 
    "18": "The inotropic activity of 5-bromisatin (5-bromindolyn-2,3-dion) which possesses antihypoxic properties was studied on rhythmically stimulated papillary muscles of guinea pigs, and the changes in the force of their contractions were recorded. The inotropic efficacy (calculated according to ED50 value) of 5-bromisatin was approximately 5 times less than that of milprinon. The activity of the isatin drug was inhibited by about 30% by carbachol and prazosin and relieved by nifedipin. 5-bromisatin increases sharply (by 160%) the second component (P2) of the biphase contraction and its effect is independent of the receptor beta-adrenergic blocking agent dl-propanolol. On the basis of the obtained data it is concluded that Ca2+ ions entering by way of the slow (L-type) calcium channels both the cAMP-dependent and cAMP-independent routes are involved in the mechanism of 5-bromisatin activity.", 
    "19": "Diabetes mellitus, a disease with a wide prevalence, has major cardiovascular effects, being a risk factor for the development of ischemic heart disease and congestive heart failure. The aim of this open, multicenter study was to assess the antiischemic efficacy and tolerability of trimetazidine, a metabolic agent acting at the myocardial mitochondrial level, in diabetic patients with stable effort angina treated previously with a single conventional antianginal drug. Fifty diabetic patients (mean age 58 years) with proven coronary artery disease, stable effort angina for at least 3 months, and positive, comparable results of two initial treadmill exercise tests separated by a 1-week interval were included in the study. They continued their conventional antianginal monotherapy with a long-acting nitrate, beta-blocker, or calcium channel blocker. After stabilization, 4-week therapy with trimetazidine, three times daily, 20 mg was initiated in combination with previous treatment. The results showed a significant improvement in exercise tolerance (440.2 vs. 383.2 s; P < 0.01), time to 1-mm ST-segment depression (358.3 vs. 301.6 s; P < 0.01), time to onset of anginal pain (400.0 vs. 238.3 s; P < 0.01), and total work (9.39 vs. 8.67 metabolic equivalents, P < 0.01). Maximal ST-segment depression was attenuated compared with baseline (1.82 vs. 1.91 mm). Other findings included a significant decrease in the mean frequency of anginal episodes (3.06 vs. 4.79 per week; P < 0.01) and in mean nitrate consumption (2.29 vs. 4.2 doses/week). These results suggest that trimetazidine may be effective and is well tolerated as combination therapy for diabetic coronary artery disease patients uncontrolled with a single hemodynamic agent.",

There is a significant percentage of atrioventricular blocks produced by the ophthalmic beta-blockers that the patient does not recognize as treatment, and 60% of them are reversible. It is important to ask about the use of eye-drops in patients with bradycardia or atrioventricular block.",

In this study, we evaluated the effects of beta-blockade using the selective beta(2) antagonist ICI 118551 or the general beta-antagonist propranolol on insulin-induced cardiac and regional flow responses in normal rats. Insulin-induced responses were also examined following adrenalectomy. Rats were anaesthetized and the femoral vein and artery were cannulated for infusions, sampling or monitoring of MAP and heart rate (HR). The iliac, renal, and superior mesentery arteries were equipped with pulsed-Doppler flow probes. Blood samples were collected at selected intervals. Insulin decreased blood glucose, MAP and increased conductances. Pretreatment with propranolol not only antagonized the insulin-induced decrease in MAP and increased conductance but insulin also then increased MAP and decreased conductances. ICI 11851, like propranolol, antagonized the insulin-induced decrease in MAP and increased iliac and renal artery conductances. Adrenalectomy did not alter the maximum insulin-induced effects on MAP and conductances but prevented the rebound recovery phase. beta-blockade following adrenalectomy had the same effects as beta-blockade alone on the insulin-induced responses. We conclude that the insulin-induced decrease in MAP and the increased flow in the selective vascular beds are modulated by a sympathetic beta(2)-receptor-mediated pathway and this response is not due primarily to the release of adrenal catecholamine.", 
    "35": "The effect of cold exposure (0 degrees C, 1 h) on free fatty acid (FFA) mobilization and plasma glucose was studied in freely moving male rats injected with adrenergic blockers (phentolamine or propranolol) into the medial preoptic area (MPOA). The rats were implanted with chronic jugular catheters for blood sampling and with unilateral intracerebral cannulas placed just above the MPOA. Blood samples were taken 2 min before and 10, 20, 40 and 60 min after cold exposure. After cold exposure plasma glucose and plasma FFA levels rose rapidly, reaching a peak at 20 min post-stimulus. Previous administration of phentolamine (50 nmol), but not propranolol (100 nmol), into the MPOA blocked the glycemic response to cold exposure. On the other hand, previous administration of propranolol, but not phentolamine, into the MPOA blocked the increased FFA mobilization in response to cold exposure. On the basis of these results, we propose that MPOA alpha-adrenergic synapses relay impulses activating the sympathetic outflow expressed by neurally mediated hyperglycemia, and beta-adrenergic synapses relay impulses activating the sympathetic outflow to the adipose tissue, increasing FFA acid mobilization.",

Three healthy males were recruited and each subject was used as his own control. The 5-HT1A receptor occupancy was calculated for the frontal and temporal cortex and the raphe nuclei, using and a ratio analysis with the cerebellar cortex as the reference region. Maximal pindolol plasma concentration was reached within 3 h after drug administration. Two hours after pindolol administration, the regional 5-HT1A receptor occupancy was within the range 7-21% in the three subjects.

Pretreatment with indomethacin reduced the negative effect of TNF-alpha, while propranolol abolished the initial increase of contractility. The role of PAF and NO as mediators of TNF-alpha was suggested by: (1) the protective effect of L-NAME, but not of D-NAME, on electrical and mechanical alterations; (2) the stimulatory effect of TNF-alpha on nitrite production; (3) the inhibitory effect of WEB 2170 and CV 3988, on both the electromechanical alterations and the nitrite production; (4) the synthesis of PAF induced by TNF-alpha.

DL-Sotalol (0.1 mmol/l) reinforced local gradients and thus increased epicardial dispersion, whereas intramural recordings did not demonstrate any predominant effect in midmyocardial layers. Phenylephrine (1 mumol/l) notably augmented DL-sotalol effects. After [Mg++]o lowering, although dispersion was not significantly increased, DL-sotalol was associated with the spontaneous occurrence of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in seven out of nine experiments. When maps of repolarization of escape beats were compared with activation maps of first arrhythmic beats, an arc of functional dissociation was observed in the vicinity of a steep gradient of repolarization in two out of nine tachycardias.", 
    "45": "Epicardial dispersion of repolarization is increased by slow rates, DL-sotalol and phenylephrine but is not the only requirement for initiation of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. In combination with other factors, it helps continuation of the arrhythmia in this model.", 
    "46": "Flow-pressure curves and vascular impedance are commonly used to investigate pulmonary circulation, but they may be affected at low flow by reflex neurohumoral activation. We therefore investigated the mechanical effects and the reflex effects of decreased flow on pulmonary vascular resistance and impedance.", 
    "47": "In ten anaesthetized dogs, we compared flow-pressure curves generated in less than 10 s to prevent sympathetic activation (fast curves), or generated over 20-30 min to allow neurohumoral equilibration (slow curves), in hyperoxia (inspired oxygen, 40%) and in hypoxia (inspired oxygen, 10%), before and after adrenergic blockade by phentolamine and propranolol. Resistance was assessed from the flow-pressure relationship. Impedance was computed from instantaneous flow and pressure obtained with an ultrasonic flowmeter and a micromanometer-tipped catheter.", 
    "48": "At baseline, fast flow-pressure curves were steeper and had a lower pressure intercept. Transient low flow did not affect heart rate or pulmonary arterial elastance. Sustained low flow increased heart rate, resistance and elastance, suggesting baroreceptor-induced sympathetic stimulation. After adrenergic blockade, no difference persisted between effects of transient and sustained low flow. In hypoxia, slow and fast flow-pressure curves were similar. Hypoxia increased heart rate and resistance but did not decrease elastance, suggesting chemoreceptor-induced sympathetic stimulation. In hypoxia, differences between transient and sustained low flow were no longer significant, and were completely suppressed by adrenergic blockade. In two additional dogs, epinephrine infusion increased pulmonary vascular resistance and elastance.", 
    "49": "We conclude that (1) compared to transient low flow, sustained low flow is associated with increases in distal resistance and proximal elastance due to sympathetic stimulation and (2) these differences between the effects of transient and sustained low flow do not persist in hypoxia, because of an already present chemoreceptor-induced sympathetic stimulation.", 
    "50": "The reported increase in basal activity of hearts from transgenic mice (TG4) overexpressing the human beta 2-adrenoceptor (beta 2-AR) was explained by spontaneously active beta 2-ARs that stimulate the beta-adrenergic cascade in the absence of an agonist. In order to examine altered myocardial function on a cellular level, we have investigated L-type calcium current (ICa,L) and cell shortening in ventricular myocytes from TG4 hearts. Myocytes from littermates (LM) and wild type animals (WT) served as controls.", 
    "51": "Cardiac beta-AR density was measured by [125I]-iodocyanopindolol binding to ventricular membranes. ICa,L was assessed by standard whole-cell voltage clamp technique. Contractility was measured as cell shortening in ventricular myocytes and as force of contraction in electrically stimulated left atria.", 
    "52": "Overexpression of beta 2-ARs was confirmed by an almost 400-fold increase in beta-AR density. The beta 1:beta 2-AR ratio in WT mice was 71:29. Myocytes from TG4 and LM mice were similar in size as judged by membrane capacitance and two dimensional cell area. ICa,L amplitude was significantly lower in TG4 than in LM myocytes (with 2 mM [Ca2+]o -4.82 +/- 0.48 vs. -6.56 +/- 0.38 pA/pF, respectively). In TG4 myocytes, the ICa,L response to isoproterenol (1 microM) was almost abolished. Cell shortening was not different in physiological [Ca2+]o, but smaller in maximum [Ca2+]o when comparing TG4 to control myocytes. Basal force of contraction in left atria did not differ between TG4 and LM at any age investigated. In TG4 left atria the inotropic response to isoproterenol was also absent, whereas responses to high [Ca2+]o or dibutyryl-cAMP (1 mM) were present but reduced. The rate of spontaneous beating of right atria was elevated in TG4 mice.", 
    "53": "Since only spontaneous beating rate but neither basal ICa,L amplitude nor basal contractile activity were elevated, our data fail to reveal evidence for spontaneously active, stimulating beta 2-ARs in left atrium and ventricle. A contractile deficit unrelated to the beta-adrenoceptor pathway is evident in TG4 myocytes and left atria.", 
    "54": "Both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors (beta 1-AR and beta 2-AR) are functionally present in human and rat ventricular myocytes. The two receptor subtypes are differently regulated during the development of myocardial hypertrophy and failure. I(f) is expressed in human and rat ventricular myocytes. In hypertrophied myocytes isolated from old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) the density is much larger than in age-matched normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY). Due to the possible relevance of I(f) as an arrhythmogenic mechanism in the rat and human ventricle, we studied and compared the effects of beta 1-AR and beta 2-AR stimulation on I(f) in both hypertrophied and normal left ventricular myocytes of 18-month old SHR and WKY.", 
    "55": "The whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique was employed. Noradrenaline (NA, 1 microM) was used to stimulate beta 1-AR and isoprenaline (ISO, 1 microM) in the presence of the beta 1-AR antagonist CGP 20712A (0.1 microM) to stimulate beta 2-AR.", 
    "56": "In SHR, NA increased I(f) by causing a 10.8 +/- 0.9 mV (n = 10) positive shift in the voltage of maximal activation (V1/2); this effect was completely reversed by CGP 20712A. beta 2-AR stimulation was effective in seven out of 13 cells tested, where it caused a small positive shift in V1/2 (4.0 +/- 1.7 mV). Cyclopentyladenosine (CPA), a selective A1-receptor agonist, reversed the effect of NA; the antiadrenergic action of CPA was abolished in cells pre-incubated with pertussis toxin (PTX) to block inhibitory G proteins (Gi). In PTX-treated cells the shift in V1/2 caused by both beta 2-AR (9.6 +/- 1.7 mV, n = 6, p < 0.05) and beta 1-AR (17.6 +/- 1.9 mV, n =7, p < 0.05) was significantly greater than in control cells. Both beta-AR subtypes modulated I(f) activation also in WKY: beta 1-AR shifted V1/2 by 16.0 +/- 1.4 mV (n = 15) and beta 2-AR by 4.2 +/- 1.1 mV (n = 7). However, in PTX-treated WKY cells only the beta 2-AR effect was potentiated (shift in V1/2: 11.4 +/- 1.4 mV, n = 9, p < 0.01), while the beta 1-AR response was unchanged (18.9 +/- 4.2 mV, n = 5, n.s.).", 
    "57": "I(f) expressed in SHR hypertrophied ventricular myocytes is modulated by catecholamines mainly through the stimulation of the beta 1-AR subtype. The beta 1-AR response is, however, significantly lower than that observed in myocytes from normotensive rats, probably as a consequence of the presence of an increased inhibitory activity of Gi proteins. This post-receptorial control may be seen as a mechanism to limit the arrhythmogenicity of beta-AR stimulation in myocardial hypertrophy and failure.", 
    "58": "1,2-Diacylglycerol (1,2-DAG) and phosphatidic acid (PA) are produced by phospholipase C and D activity and play a key role as second messengers in receptor-mediated signal transduction. So far, little is known about alterations of endogenous 1,2-DAG and PA production during myocardial ischemia.", 
    "59": "Rat isolated perfused hearts were subjected to global ischemia, total lipids were extracted, and separated by thin-layer chromatography. The mass of PA and 1,2-DAG were quantified using laserdensitometric analysis of visualized lipids.", 
    "60": "Compared to normoxic control values (1,2-DAG 713 +/- 45 ng/mg protein, PA 171 +/- 11 ng/mg protein), the myocardial content of 1,2-DAG and PA was unaltered after 10 min of ischemia. Prolonged myocardial ischemia (20 min), however, which was accompanied by marked overflow of endogenous norepinephrine, significantly increased the mass of both second messengers (1,2-DAG 1062 +/- 100 ng/mg protein, PA 340 +/- 29 ng/mg protein). The increase in PA and 1,2-DAG in response to ischemia was abolished by inhibition of ischemia-induced norepinephrine release as well as by alpha1-adrenergic blockade but unaffected by beta-adrenergic blockade. While inhibition of diacylglycerol kinase did not affect ischemia-induced increase in PA and 1,2-DAG, inhibition of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C activity significantly suppressed ischemia-induced increase in 1,2-DAG but did not affect endogenous production of PA indicating phospholipase C-independent formation of PA and activation of both, phospholipase C and D, in the ischemic heart.", 
    "61": "Ischemia elicits an alpha1-adrenergic receptor-mediated increase in the mass of myocardial PA and 1,2-DAG. The increase in endogenous PA is suggested to be due to the activation of myocardial phospholipase D, whereas 1,2-DAG is formed predominantly by activation of phospholipase C in the ischemic heart.", 
    "62": "Beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents (beta-blockers) have been widely used for the treatment of angina pectoris. The average/standard therapeutic doses vary widely among beta-blockers with the maximum of about a 120-fold difference. In order to clarify the mechanism of this difference, we analyzed retrospectively the pharmacological effects of beta-blockers in consideration of the beta 1-receptor binding affinity and the vasodilative activity on the basis of pharmacokinetics and the receptor occupancy theory. The analysis was performed on eight beta-blockers without a vasodilative effect and on four beta-blockers with a vasodilative effect. The beta 1-receptor occupancies at the steady-state condition after oral administration of standard doses were calculated by the use of the data on the concentration of unbound agents in plasma and on the dissociation constant of receptors. The estimated receptor occupancies were 87 +/- 6% or 88 +/- 10% for the beta-blockers with or without a vasodilative effect, respectively, and a significant difference was not observed between these groups. These results suggest that the beta 1-receptor occupancies may be a principal indicator for the therapeutic effects for angina pectoris regardless of their vasodilative effects.",

The rank order of release rate, in the absence of HPMC, was NaCMC (Blanose) < NaCMC P 800 < NaCMC P 350 for matrices containing 95-285 mg NaCMC, and was dependent on their viscosity grades. The effects of changing the ratio of HPMC to NaCMC (Blanose) and the drug/total polymer ratio were examined. The release rates decreased as the proportion of NaCMC in the matrices increased. Zero-order release of propranolol hydrochloride was obtained from matrices containing 285 mg 3:1 NaCMC (Blanose)/HPMC. Differential scanning calorimetry was used to quantify the moisture uptake by the polymers at 37 degrees C. Wafers containing NaCMC (Blanose) or 1:1 HPMC/NaCMC (Blanose) absorbed water similarly. A study of the erosion rates of matrices containing polymer only indicated that NaCMC (Blanose) eroded more quickly than HPMC. When propranolol hydrochloride was included in matrices containing NaCMC (Blanose), the erosion was reduced as a result of the insolubility of a complex formed between NaCMC and propranolol hydrochloride. The interaction between propranolol hydrochloride and NaCMC (Blanose) was confirmed by both dialysis and by monitoring the release of sodium ions from the matrices.", 
    "64": "The lipophilic beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist propranolol has been studied to define its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics in hyperlipidemic patients. A total of 48 subjects were allocated to four study groups: (1) healthy volunteers, (2) hypercholesterolemic patients, (3) hypertriglyceridemic subjects, and (4) patients with a mixed form of hyperlipidemia. Propranolol was given orally as a single dose of 80 mg. Heart rate was measured during 12 hours. At each point, the concentrations of propranolol were estimated. Moreover, heart rate and arterial systolic blood pressure were examined at rest and after a submaximal exercise test 3 hours after administration of propranolol (i.e., at the peak of propranolol concentration in the blood serum). A significant increase in the area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) by 39% and a reduction of the volume of distribution and total body clearance by 48% and 46%, respectively, without a significant change in the half-life time, were observed in patients with hypertriglyceridemia in comparison with the control group. The acceleration of exercise heart rate and the elevation of systolic blood pressure were comparable in all groups in the study, whereas blood serum concentrations of propranolol in patients with hypertriglyceridemia (group 3) and the mixed form of hyperlipidemia (group 4) were markedly altered from those observed in normolipemic subjects. No relationship between the concentration of propranolol and the heart rate in the group with hypertriglyceridemia was seen. In the light of this study, the authors suggest that lipid metabolism disturbances do not affect the pharmacodynamics of propranolol.",

    "72": "The affinity and functional effects of isoxsuprine enantiomers were investigated to determine the enantiospecificity of the beta-agonistic and alpha-blocking effects. Functional assays on isolated smooth muscle preparations from equine common digital artery were performed to determine the apparent affinity (pD(2)) and intrinsic activity (alpha(E)) of (-)erythro-isoxsuprine (alphaS, betaR, gammaR) and (+)erythro-isoxsuprine (alphaR, betaS, gammaS). The affinity of two enantiomers for the different adrenoceptor types was studied by radioligand binding assays on membrane preparations from the same tissue, using (-)[(3)H]CGP12177 and [(3)H]prazosin. On noradrenaline-precontracted artery preparations (-)isoxsuprine was markedly more potent than (+)isoxsuprine in dilating preparations, indicating that the laevorotatory enantiomer has a very high apparent affinity for alpha-adrenoceptors. Binding studies confirmed that (-)isoxsuprine has a higher affinity than (+)isoxsuprine for alpha-adrenoceptors, while the (+) isomer competes for beta-adrenoceptors with an affinity similar to that of propranolol. As described for other beta-phenylethylamines, the two isoxsuprine enantiomers studied have different efficacies for alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors and the effects of the commercially available mixture of stereoisomers therefore depend on the density and functional importance of the adrenoceptor types present in the tissue studied. 1999 Academic Press.",

Negative inotropic effects of several beta-adrenoceptor (betaAR) antagonists on electrically-stimulated right atria, left atria, right ventricles and left ventricular papillary muscles from reserpine-treated rats were used as a measure of their inverse agonist activities. 2. Beta1AR antagonists acebutolol, atenolol and metoprolol, beta2AR antagonist ICI-181,551 and nonselective betaAR antagonists alprenolol, nadolol, propranolol and timolol produced negative inotropic effects, which were most marked on the right atria. 3. The nonselective betaAR antagonist pindolol did not exhibit inverse agonist activity but inhibited the negative inotropic activities of ICI-118,551, atenolol and propranolol. 4. The negative inotropic effects of lidocaine, nifedipine and pentobarbitone were similar on all the four myocardial preparations. 5. The positive inotropic efficacy of salbutamol on right and left atria but not on right ventricles and papillary muscles was comparable to that of isoprenaline. The antagonist activity of ICI-118,551 against isoprenaline was greater on right atria than on other cardiac regions. 6. Beta1AR proteins were expressed in all regions of the heart but of beta2AR were primarily localized in the right atrium. 7. It is concluded that beta2AR play a greater role in right atria than in other cardiac regions and almost all betaAR antagonists behave as inverse agonists.",

    "75": "(-)-Pindolol, which possesses significant affinity for 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, and beta 1/2-adrenergic receptors (AR)s, dose-dependently increased extracellular levels of dopamine (DA) and noradrenaline (NAD) versus 5-HT, in dialysates of the frontal cortex (FCX), but not accumbens and striatum, of freely-moving rats. In distinction, the preferential beta 1-AR antagonist, betaxolol, and the preferential beta 2-AR antagonist, ICI118,551, did not increase basal levels of DA, NAD, or 5-HT. Further, they both dose-dependently and markedly blunted the influence of (-)-pindolol upon DA and NAD levels. The selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, WAY100,635, slightly attenuated the (-)-pindolol-induced increase in DA and NAD levels, while the selective 5-HT1B antagonist, SB224,289, was ineffective. These data suggest that (-)-pindolol facilitates frontocortical dopaminergic (and adrenergic) transmission primarily by activation of beta 1/2-ARs and, to a lesser degree, by stimulation of 5-HT1A receptors, whereas 5-HT1B receptors are not involved. (-)-Pindolol potentiated the increase in FCX levels of 5-HT elicited by the 5-HT reuptake inhibitors, fluoxetine and duloxetine, and also enhanced their ability to elevate FCX levels of DA--though not of NAD. In contrast to (-)-pindolol, betaxolol and ICI118,551 did not affect the actions of fluoxetine, whereas both WAY100,635 and SB224,289 potentiated the increase in levels of 5-HT--but not DA or NAD levels--elicited by fluoxetine. In conclusion, (-)-pindolol modulates, both alone and together with 5-HT reuptake inhibitors, dopaminergic, adrenergic, and serotonergic transmission in the FCX via a complex pattern of actions at beta 1/2-ARs, 5-HT1A, and 5-HT1B receptors. These findings have important implications for clinical studies of the influence of (-)-pindolol upon the actions of antidepressant agents.", 
    "76": "Acetaldehyde (ACA), the major metabolite of ethanol, exerts both stimulatory and depressive actions on myocardial tissue. We have recently shown that ACA depresses myocardial contraction, cardiac myocyte shortening and intracellular Ca2+ transients in normal rat heart. The purpose of the present study was to determine the influence of hypertension on ACA-induced myocardial actions. Mechanical properties of left ventricular papillary muscles and ventricular myocytes isolated from both 25-week-old normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were evaluated using force-transducer and video edge-detection, respectively. Papillary muscles and cardiac myocytes were electrically stimulated to contract at 0.5 Hz. Contractile properties analyzed include: peak tension development (PTD), peak twitch amplitude (PTA), time-to-PTD/PTA (TPT/TPS), time-to-90% relaxation/relengthening (RT90/TR90) and maximal velocities of contraction/shortening and relaxation/relengthening (+/-VT/+/-dL/dt). Intracellular Ca2+ transients were measured as fura-2 fluorescence intensity (FFI) changes. ACA (1-30 mM) depressed PTD without affecting other mechanical indices in both WKY and SHR myocardium, with maximal inhibition of 64 and 69%, respectively. SHR myocytes exhibited increased cell dimension, baseline PTA and resting intracellular Ca2+ levels, compared to WKY counterparts. ACA (0.03-30 mM) depressed PTA without affecting TPT, TR90 and +/-dL/dt. The maximal inhibitions were 31 and 36% in WKY and SHR groups, respectively. Interestingly, ACA exerted a biphasic effect on FFI, displaying potentiation at lower doses (<3 mM) and inhibition at higher doses (>3 mM). The maximal increase in FFI changes were 19 and 22% at 0.3 mM and the maximal decreases were 37 and 29% at 30 mM ACA, in WKY and SHR myocytes, respectively. Neither resting intracellular Ca2+ levels (FFI) nor fluorescence decay time (FDT) were affected by ACA. The increase in FFI was attenuated by propranolol (1 microM), whereas the decrease in FFI was reversed by BayK 8644 (1 microM). These results suggest that hypertension does not appear to alter ACA-induced myocardial depression. The mechanism underlying ACA-induced myocardial actions may involve increased beta-adrenergic activity at low doses and reduced Ca2+ entry and/or release at high doses.", 
    "77": "Drug partitioning to liposomes has been suggested as a model for partitioning to biomembranes but has been lacking a rapid analytical assay useful for drug screening. A fast pH-metric titration method for the determination of liposome partitioning of ionizable drugs using small unilamellar phosphatidylcholine vesicles prepared by sonic homogenization has been successfully developed, enabling the use of high lipid-to-drug ratios. Liposome-water partition coefficients of diclofenac and propranolol were determined to study the impact of varying titration parameters, temperature, equilibration time, lipid, and liposome types on the partitioning. To validate this method, the results were compared to literature values generated with different techniques and to pH-metric titration results with large unilamellar vesicles. The rapid pH-metric assay gave liposome partitioning data for the two model compounds which were consistent with other analytical techniques and liposome types.", 
    "78": "The distribution of water within gels composed of a range of cellulose ether polymers of similar molecular weights (viscosity grades of 4000-6000 cP) but varying substitution types and levels was assessed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Water loosely bound to the polymer was detected as one or more events appearing at the low-temperature side of the main endotherm for the melting of free water in DSC scans. Polymer substitution types and levels, and added drugs (50 mM propranolol hydrochloride or 50 mM diclofenac sodium) influenced the appearance of these melting events. Hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC) and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC F4M) gels showed behavior different to that of the other polymers studied. It is thought that any water binding to HPC gels is tightly attached and is not visible as pre-endothermic events on DSC scans. The amount of water bound per polymer repeating unit (PRU) was influenced by and related to the degree of hydrophilic and hydrophobic substitution on the polymer backbone and by the inclusion of either drug. HPC gels had the highest bound water content after 96 h and this was probably related to the high percentage of hydrophilic hydroxypropoxyl substitutions in this polymer. In contrast, methylcellulose (MC A4M) had the lowest bound water content after 96 h storage, and this was explained by the lack of hydrophilic hydroxypropoxyl substitutions in the polymer.", 
    "79": "Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was employed to characterize the distribution of water in gels produced from a series of hydroxypropylmethylcelluloses (HPMC, Methocel K-series) of different molecular weights (i.e., different viscosity grades). The presence of loosely bound water was characterized as pre-endothermic events occurring at temperatures below the main melting endotherm of free water. Both the magnitude and occurrence of these pre-endothermic events were affected by polymer molecular weight and gel storage time. In addition, the amount of water bound to the polymer depended on polymer molecular weight and gel storage time. The temperature at which frozen water melted within the gels was dependent on polymer concentration, with a depression of extrapolated endothermic melting peak onset occurring with an increase in polymer concentration. The addition of propranolol hydrochloride or diclofenac sodium, as model drugs, affected both the occurrence of pre-endothermic events and the distribution of water within the gels.", 
    "80": "Cocaine is thought to stimulate the cardiovascular system by blocking peripheral norepinephrine reuptake.

    "81": "In 14 healthy cocaine-naive humans, we measured blood pressure, heart rate, and skin sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) with intraneural microelectrodes before, during, and for 90 minutes after intranasal cocaine (2 mg/kg, n=7) or lidocaine (2 mg/kg, n=7). Intranasal cocaine caused an initial but transient 3. 3-fold increase in skin SNA during the period of intranasal administration followed by a sustained 2.4-fold increase lasting for up to 90 minutes after cocaine. Unlike cocaine, intranasal lidocaine caused only a small transient increase in skin SNA due to local nasal irritation. The cocaine-induced increase in SNA was accompanied by decreased skin blood flow, increased skin vascular resistance, and increased heart rate. In 11 additional subjects, we showed that the cocaine-induced increase in heart rate was eliminated by beta-adrenergic receptor blockade (propranolol) but unaffected by muscarinic receptor blockade (atropine), indicating sympathetic mediation.", 
    "82": "These studies provide direct microneurographic evidence in humans that intranasal cocaine stimulates central sympathetic outflow.

    "83": "The chronic form of alcoholic skeletal myopathy is characterized by selective atrophy of Type II fibers and affects up to two thirds of all alcohol misusers. Plasma selenium and alpha-tocopherol are reduced in myopathic alcoholics compared to alcoholic patients without myopathy. Plasma carnosinase is also reduced in myopathic alcoholics, implicating a mechanism related to reduced intramuscular carnosine, an imidazole dipeptide with putative antioxidant properties. Together with the observation that alcoholic patients have increased indices of lipid peroxidation, there is evidence suggestive of free radical (i.e., unpaired electrons or reactive oxygen species) mediated damage in the pathogenesis of alcohol-induced muscle disease. Protein synthesis is a multi-step process that encompasses amino acid transport, signal transduction, translation and transcription. Any defect in one or more of the innumerable components of each process will have an impact on protein synthesis, as determined by radiolabelling of constituent proteins. Both acute and chronic alcohol exposure are associated with a reduction in skeletal muscle protein synthesis. Paradoxically, alcohol-feeding studies in rats have shown that the imidazole dipeptide concentrations are increased in myopathic muscles though alpha-tocopherol contents are not significantly altered. In acutely dosed rats, where protein synthesis is reduced, protein carbonyl concentrations (an index of oxidative damage to muscle) also decline slightly or are unaltered, contrary to the expected increase. Alcoholic cardiomyopathy can ensue from heavy consumption of alcohol over a long period of time. The clinical features include poor myocardial contractility with reduced left ventricular ejection volume, raised tissue enzymes, dilation of the left ventricle, raised auto- antibodies and defects in mitochondrial function. Whilst oxidant damage occurs in experimental models, however this issues remains to be confirmed in the clinical setting. In the rat, circulating troponin-T release increases in the presence of ethanol, a mechanism ascribed to free radical mediated damage, as it is prevented with the xanthine oxidase inhibitor and beta-blocker, propranolol. However, whilst propranolol prevents the release of troponin-T, it does not prevent the fall in whole cardiac protein synthesis, suggestive of localized ischemic damage due to ethanol.",

    "87": "The accelerated titration regimen for sotalol can shorten the time to attain the dosage usually required to effectively control arrhythmias, without excessive QT prolongation and the associated increased risk of torsades de pointes. The hospital stay of patients in whom antiarrhythmic therapy with sotalol is initiated can be shortened by 1 day if this accelerated titration regimen is used.", 
    "88": "Thyrotoxicosis periodic paralysis is a very rare complication of thyrotoxicosis in whites, but is more frequently reported in oriental and latin american populations and associates the clinical picture of hyperthyroidism with bouts of paralysis due to hypokalemia. The hypokalemia is due to a massive shift of potassium from the extra- to the intracellular compartment. In this paper the authors report a case of 34-years old white male with an history of hypokalemic periodic paralysis and hyperthyroidism, studied with potassium, thyroid hormone, TSH and thyroid antibodies sampling and thyroid ultrasonography with color-Doppler. The restoration of a euthyroid state with methimazole and propranolol was effective in preventing further episodes of paralysis. It is suggested that the mechanism for the development of the hypokalemic periodic paralysis is the intracellular blockade of potassium by the surplus of thyroid hormones.", 
    "89": "N-Acetylaspartate (NAA) is the second most abundant amino acid in the adult brain. It is located and synthesized in neurons and probably degraded in the glia compartment, but the transport mechanisms are unknown. Rat primary neuron and astrocyte cell cultures were exposed to the L isomer of [3H]NAA and demonstrated concentration-dependent uptake of [3H]NAA with a Km approximately 80 microM. However, Vmax was 23+/-6.4 pmol/mg of protein/min in astrocytes but only 1.13+/-0.4 pmol/mg of protein/min in neurons. The fact that neuron cultures contain 3-5% astrocytes suggests that the uptake mechanism is expressed only in glial cells. The astrocyte uptake was temperature and sodium chloride dependent and specific for L-NAA. The affinity for structural analogues was (IC50 in mM) as follows: L-NAA (0.12) > N-acetylaspartylglutamate (0.4) > N-acetylglutamate (0.42) > L-aspartate (>1) > L-glutamate (>1) > or = DL-threo-beta-hydroxyaspartate > N-acetyl-L-histidine. The naturally occurring amino acids showed no inhibitory effect at 1 mM. The glutamate transport blocker trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylate exhibited an IC50 of 0.57 mM, whereas another specific glutamate transport inhibitor, DL-threo-beta-hydroxyaspartate, had an IC50 of >1 mM. The experiments suggest that NAA transport in brain parenchyma occurs by a novel type of sodium-dependent carrier that is present only in glial cells.",

Recently, a series of oral second generation 5-HT 1B/1D agonists (eletriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan and zolmitriptan) have been developed and are reviewed in this paper. Their in vitro and in vivo pharmacological properties, clinical efficacy, drug interactions, and adverse effects are evaluated and compared to the gold standard in the treatment of acute migraine, sumatriptan.", 
    "91": "Besides reperfusion treatment, which is the most powerful approach to the underlying pathophysiological cause of myocardial infarction, adjunctive therapies should be considered to reduce clinical symptoms, and improve left ventricular function and mortality rates. Randomized clinical trials and overviews of adjunctive therapy with beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors showed that these treatments may further reduce mortality rates by approximately 10%. On the basis of this evidence, guidelines suggest that (1) all patients with acute myocardial infarction who do not have clear contraindications should be treated within 24 hours from the onset of symptoms with intravenous beta-blockers. If tolerated, the treatment should be continued for at least 2 to 3 years and perhaps longer; (2) ACE inhibitor treatment should be started during the first day after myocardial infarction in most patients after timely and careful observation of the patient's hemodynamic and clinical status and after administration of routinely recommended treatments (thrombolysis, aspirin, and beta-blockers). In the patients showing neither clinical symptoms nor instrumental signs of left ventricular dysfunction, ACE inhibitor treatment can be stopped at the time of hospital discharge and ventricular function reevaluated after an adequate period of time.", 
    "92": "Initiation of beta-blocker therapy is often limited by worsening congestive heart failure, which may manifest as worsening hemodynamics. Deleterious hemodynamic effects might be mitigated with the vasodilation of combined calcium channel/beta-blocker therapy.", 
    "93": "This prospective, randomized study assessed the safety and efficacy of metoprolol alone or combined with amlodipine on hemodynamic parameters at baseline, 2 hours after the first dose of study medication, and after 12 weeks of therapy in patients receiving background triple therapy for mild to severe heart failure. Functional, exercise, and hormonal status were assessed at baseline and end of study. Twenty-nine patients (mean age 50 +/- 12.1 years) were enrolled; 21 completed 12 weeks of treatment. Mean ejection fraction at baseline was 13.4% +/- 5.7%; 79% of patients had heart failure classified as New York Heart Association class III, and 66% had heart failure of idiopathic origin. Heart rate and blood pressure did not change with short-term therapy in either group. The first dose of both regimens produced significant increases in systemic vascular resistance and significant decreases in cardiac output and index and stroke volume and stroke work indexes; combination therapy acutely yielded small but statistically significant increases in pulmonary artery, pulmonary capillary wedge, and right atrial pressures. Long-term therapy with both regimens produced significant decreases in heart rate, systemic vascular resistance, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and significant increases in cardiac output and index and stroke volume and stroke work indexes. Combination therapy produced significant long-term decreases in blood pressure.", 
    "94": "There was no further measurable benefit with the addition of amlodipine to metoprolol compared with the effects of metoprolol alone. Therapy with metoprolol alone and the combination of metoprolol and amlodipine was well tolerated in patients with mild to severe heart failure, as evidenced by a lack of adverse effects on hemodynamic parameters over the short term and clinical and hemodynamic improvement with long-term treatment.", 
    "95": "1. The effects of the anti-malarial drugs mefloquine and halofantrine and of their major metabolites on metoprolol metabolism by rat liver microsomes have been investigated. 2. The observed Km and Vmax, and the formation kinetics of alpha-hydroxymetoprolol and O-demethylmetoprolol, two major metoprolol metabolites, were in keeping with published data. 3. In vitro, mefloquine competitively inhibited metoprolol biotransformation, whereas halofantrine did so in a mixed fashion. The mefloquine Ki of metoprolol alpha-hydroxylation and O-demethylation were 3.4 and 5.8 microM respectively, whereas those of halofantrine were 0.15 and 0.32 microM respectively. 4. The main metabolites, N-debutylhalofantrine and carboxymefloquine, were 4-10-fold less inhibitory than the parent drugs. The difference in inhibitory potency of parent drugs and metabolites was higher for halofantrine than for mefloquine. The potency order for metoprolol metabolism inhibition was halofantrine > mefloquine = N-debutylhalofantrine > carboxymefloquine. 5. A preliminary study with anti-malarial enantiomers showed a weak difference, in metoprolol metabolism inhibition between the enantiomers of halofantrine or mefloquine. 6. It is concluded that halofantrine is a potent inhibitor of metoprolol metabolism and that halofantrine metabolites or its enantiomers may have a different inhibitor potency than the parent drug: (1) the inhibition potency of these compounds should be studied in vitro and (2) their in vivo elimination half-life and plasma concentrations should be taken into be account to extrapolate this experimental results to in vivo.", 
    "96": "We evaluated whether elevated blood pressure (BP) levels with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) affect the in-hospital course, short-term, and 1-year outcome. Data were derived from a nationwide survey of 2,212 consecutive patients with AMI. Patients were stratified into 3 groups according to admission BP levels: 1,320 patients had normal BP, 840 patients had high BP, and 52 patients had excessive BP. In-hospital (7 days) course, short-term (30 days), and 1-year outcome was compared between the groups. The 3 groups were similar with respect to age, but patients with excessive BP were more likely to be women and have a history of systemic hypertension and diabetes mellitus. The rate of thrombolytic therapy was similar among the 3 groups, but patients with excessively elevated BP were treated during hospitalization much more often with beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and diuretics. The incidence of stroke, transient ischemic attack, and bleeding complications were comparable in the 3 groups. In-hospital mortality was 5.0% , 4.0%, and 1.9% in the normal, high, and excessively elevated BP groups, respectively (p = 0.19). The short-term rehospitalization or mortality rate was similar among the 3 groups. The 1-year mortality rate was 12.3%, 14.1%, and 10.2% in the normal, high, and excessively elevated BP groups, respectively (p = 0.61). A multivariate logistic regression analysis yielded age, women, and Killip class > or = 2 as the only significant predictors of mortality during follow-up. Thus, with the current medical therapy, excessively elevated BP levels with AMI is not associated with a worse short-term or 1-year outcome.",

    "98": "Therapeutical response to antihypertensive treatment is poorly predicted by individual clinical or biochemical characteristics. Some preliminary data indicate that therapeutical response to atenolol might depend on physical and/or sympathetic activity. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the blood pressure response to atenolol depending on physical and sympathetic activity.", 
    "99": "One thousand one hundred forty hypertensive patients were treated with the beta adrenorecepetor blocker atenolol in an open fashion during 3 months. Before the beginning of the treatment, we evaluated current weekly physical activity (direct interview), as well as sympathetic activity (direct interview and baseline heart rate).", 
    "100": "Age or physical activity did not correlate with blood pressure response to atenolol. Conversely, hypertensive patients with symptoms suggesting sympathetic overactivity (three or more of the following symptoms: palpitations, anxiety, diaphoresis, headache, tremor or weakness; n = 456), showed a more pronounced decrease in systolic (27.7 [13.4] vs 25.8 [14.3] mmHg; p = 0.0226) and diastolic (17.6 [8.3] vs 15.5 [8.6] mmHg; p = 0.0001) blood pressures (SBP and DBP), with respect to the remaining hypertensive patients (n = 719). Moreover, we found a statistically significant correlation between blood pressure fall with atenolol and baseline heart rate (r = 0.107, P < 0.001 for SBP, and r = 0.142, p < 0.001 for DBP).",

    "102": "Chitosans are potent nontoxic absorption enhancers after nasal administration but their effects on the intestinal epithelium in vivo has not been studied in detail. In this study, the effects of chitosans with varying molecular weights and degrees of acetylation on the absorption of a poorly absorbed model drug (atenolol) were studied in intestinal epithelial cell layers with or without a mucus layer and in an in situ perfusion model of rat ileum. The effects of the chitosans on epithelial morphology and release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) into the perfusate were investigated in the in situ model. The chitosans had pronounced effects on the permeability of mucus-free Caco-2 layers and enhanced the permeation of atenolol 10- to 15-fold, with different absorption kinetics for different chitosans, in accordance with previous results. In contrast, enhancement of atenolol absorption through rat ileum was modest. LDH release from the tissues perfused with chitosans did not increase, indicating that the chitosans were used at nontoxic concentrations. Morphological examination of the perfused ileal tissues revealed more mucus discharge from the tissues exposed to chitosans than from controls, which suggested that the discharged mucus may inhibit the binding of chitosan to the epithelial surface and hence decrease the absorption-enhancing effect. This hypothesis was supported by studies with intestinal epithelial HT29-H goblet cells covered with a mucus layer. The binding of chitosan to the epithelial cell surface and subsequent absorption-enhancing effects were significantly reduced in mucus-covered HT29-H cultures. When the mucus layer was removed prior to the addition of chitosan, the cell surface binding and absorption-enhancing effects of the chitosans were increased. We conclude that the modest absorption-enhancing effects of unformulated chitosan solutions in the perfused rat ileum are a result of the mucus barrier in this tissue. This effect may be overcome by increasing the local concentrations of both chitosan and drug, i.e,. through formulation of the chitosan into a particulate dosage form.", 
    "103": "ATP is the most important factor in glucose-induced insulin secretion in pancreatic beta-cells, but examination of intracellular differences in ATP concentration is difficult because ATP production and consumption occur simultaneously. In the present study, we measured the ATP concentration under the condition of a reduced ATP requirement by omitting extracellular Ca(2+) and inhibiting Na-K ATPase. The ATP concentration in islets incubated with 16.7 mM glucose in the absence of Ca(2+) for 30 min was increased by about 1. 9-fold more than in the presence of Ca(2+). The increment was extracellular Ca(2+)-dependent, and was completely abolished by the metabolic inhibitors dinitrophenol and iodoacetic acid. The Ca channel blockers including nitrendipine and Ni(2+) did not affect the ATP concentration in islets incubated with 16.7 mM glucose in the presence of Ca(2+). However, when thapsigargin and suramin, inhibitors of Ca-ATPase at the endoplasmic reticulum, were added to Ca channel blockers in the presence of ambient Ca(2+), the intraislet ATP content was increased, similarly to that under Ca-free conditions. But thapsigargin did not further augment the ATP concentration in the islet with 16.7 mM glucose in the absence of Ca(2+). On the other hand, the suppression of Na-K ATPase by ouabain rather reduced the ATP concentration augmented by omission of extracellular Ca(2+). In addition, vanadate, a blocker of Ca-ATPase at the plasma membrane, failed to increase the ATP concentration in the islets. These data suggest that the increment of ATP concentration in the absence of Ca(2+) is attributable to the reduced ATP requirement due to stopping of the Ca-ATPase activity at the endoplasmic reticulum, and that the intracellular ATP concentration is differently regulated by Na-K ATPase at plasma membrane and by Ca-ATPase at endoplasmic reticulum.", 
    "104": "Two series of analogues of riluzole, a blocker of excitatory amino acid mediated neurotransmission, have been synthesized: monosubstituted 2-benzothiazolamines and 3-substituted derivatives. Of all the compounds prepared in the first series, only 2-benzothiazolamines bearing alkyl, polyfluoroalkyl, or polyfluoroalkoxy substituents in the 6-position showed potent anticonvulsant activity against administration of glutamic acid in rats. The most active compounds displaying in vivo \"antiglutamate\" activity were the 6-OCF(3) (riluzole), 6-OCF(2)CF(3), 6-CF(3), and 6-CF(2)CF(3) substituted derivatives with ED(50) values between 2.5 and 3.2 mg/kg i.p. Among the second series of variously substituted benzothiazolines, compounds as active as riluzole or up to 3 times more potent were identified in two series: benzothiazolines bearing a beta-dialkylaminoethyl moiety and compounds with an alkylthioalkyl chain and their corresponding sulfoxides and sulfones. The most potent derivatives were 2-imino-3-(2-methylthio)- and 2-imino-3-(2-methylsulfinyl)-ethyl-6-trifluoromethoxybenzothiazolines (61 and 64, ED(50) = 1.0 and 1.1 mg/kg i.p., respectively). In addition, intraperitoneal administration of some of the best benzothiazolines protected mice from mortality produced by hypobaric hypoxia.",

Mass spectrometry was used to characterize the metabolites of propranolol, a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist containing numerous oxidation sites. Propranolol is extensively metabolized, with most metabolites appearing in urine. Urine samples were collected from young adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Structural identification of various metabolites was performed by LC/MS/MS, using a PE SCIEX triple quadrupole instrument (PE SCIEX API 3000). Metabolites were itemized using several LC/MS/MS techniques, including Q3 full scan and precursor and constant neutral loss experiments. A looped experiment technique revealed the presence of mono- and di-hydroxylated metabolites as well as regio isomers of hydroxy- and dihydroxy-propranolol glucuronides and propranolol glucuronic acid. Propranolol glucuronide was not observed, while the presence of dealkylated metabolites was suggested but not confirmed.", 
    "106": "It has been suggested that adrenergic agents might modulate the L-arginine-NO pathway. Sympathomimetic agonists enhance the basal release of NO, and noradrenaline increases the synthesis of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in the medial basal hypothalamus in vitro. In the present study possible involvement of NO in central stimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis by adrenergic agents was investigated in conscious rats. The nitric oxide synthase blocker N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME 2 and 10 microg) was administered intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) 15 min before the adrenergic agonist given by the same route; 1 h later the rats were decapitated. Plasma levels of ACTH and corticosterone were measured. L-NAME significantly diminished the ACTH and corticosterone response to phenylephrine (30 microg), an alpha1-adrenergic receptor agonist. These hormone responses to clonidine (10 microg), an alpha2-receptor agonist, were dose-dependently suppressed or totally abolished by L-NAME. A significant rise in the ACTH and corticosterone secretion induced by isoprenaline (10 microg), a beta-adrenergic receptor agonist, was only moderately diminished by pretreatment with L-NAME. These results indicate that NOS is considerably involved in central stimulation of the HPA axis by alpha1- and alpha2-adrenergic receptor agonists, and that NO mediates the stimulatory action of these agonists on ACTH and corticosterone secretion. The stimulation induced by beta-adrenergic receptors is only moderately affected by endogenous NO.",

    "109": "Mean with (SD) AUC(0-24h) (ng x h x ml(-1)) for carvedilol was 220 (120) and 618 (335) in CRI compared with 165 (83.5) and 413 (247) in controls on Days 1 and 9, respectively, primarily due to higher R-carvedilol concentrations. Mean with (SD) Cmax (ng x ml(-1)) for carvedilol were 53.4 (31.4) and 128 (63.3) in CRI compared with 46.7 (23.3) and 104 (58.9) in controls on Days 1 and 9, respectively. The difference in group mean values was characterized by considerable overlap in individual AUC(0-24h) and Cmax values between groups. There was no apparent difference in mean terminal elimination half-life for carvedilol between groups on each study day. Less than 1% of the dose was excreted in urine as unchanged carvedilol in both groups. Blood pressure and heart rate declined in both groups to a similar degree.", 
    "110": "Compared with controls, average AUC(0-24 h) values for carvedilol were approximately 40% and 50% higher on study Days 1 and 9 in patients with renal insufficiency, primarily due to higher R-carvedilol concentrations with only a small change (<20%) in S-carvedilol concentrations, the isomer possessing beta-blocking activity. These changes in pharmacokinetics are modest in view of the large interindividual variability. Carvedilol was well tolerated in both groups. Although the present study cannot provide a final conclusion, based on the results of the present study, no changes in dosing recommendations for carvedilol are warranted in patients with moderate/severe renal insufficiency.",

This effect could be enhanced in hypertensives treated with beta-blockers, in whom the vasoconstrictor effect of alpha-adrenergic stimulation is unbalanced. The purpose of this study was to investigate the cardiovascular response to pseudoephedrine in hypertensive patients treated with different types of beta-blockers.",

Normometabolic subjects with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension were recruited for this study, which included a 4-week, single-blind placebo washout phase and a 12-week double-blind treatment phase. After 12 weeks of treatment, both drugs demonstrated a significant decrease from baseline in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) apolipoprotein A-I (HDL-apoA-I) (nebivolol, P <.02; atenolol, P <.05). A significant reduction in HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) from baseline was also observed with nebivolol (P <.05). There were no significant differences between the drugs for these parameters, and the ratio low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)-to-HDL-C did not change significantly after 12 weeks of active treatment with nebivolol or atenolol. There were no significant changes in total cholesterol, HDL (2) -C, HDL (3) -C, LDL-C, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), total triglycerides, HDL-triglycerides (TG), LDL-TG, VLDL-TG, total apoB, LDL-B, VLDL-B (including the ratio LDL-C-to-LDL-apoB), or Lp(a) during treatment with both drugs. No significant differences in plasma apoA-I and apoC-III as well as in apoA-I-, C-III-containing lipoprotein particles (including the apoC-III ratio) were observed between the drugs, neither before nor after each active treatment. There were no significant differences between the drugs or within each treatment group in plasma glucose, insulin, or C-peptide concentrations after a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test. Mean clinic trough sitting systolic blood pressure (SBP)/diastolic blood pressure (DBP) significantly decreased from 150/98 mm Hg at baseline to 141/90 mm Hg at termination for nebivolol and from 160/99 mm Hg at baseline to 145/88 mm Hg at termination for atenolol. No significant between-treatment differences were observed for the mean clinic trough sitting SBP/DBP. Both drugs significantly increased the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) N-terminal plasma levels, whereas no changes were observed in ANF C-terminal plasma concentrations. A significant decrease (P <. 05) in the plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone levels was observed after administration of both drugs. A significant decrease (P <.05) in plasma cortisol levels was observed only after atenolol treatment. The incidence of adverse events reported during nebivolol treatment was comparable to that observed during atenolol treatment. Heart rate was significantly reduced by both drugs. There were no significant changes in hematology, biochemistry, or urinalysis studies. Neither nebivolol nor atenolol adversely affected lipid or carbohydrate metabolism in normometabolic hypertensive patients. Both treatments demonstrated adequate and similar antihypertensive effects and were well tolerated.", 
    "116": "In the present study we investigated the enantioselectivity in the pharmacokinetics of metoprolol administered in a multiple-dose regimen as the racemate. The study was conducted on 10 patients of both sexes with mild to severe essential hypertension, aged 28 to 76 years, with normal hepatic and renal function and phenotyped as extensive metabolizers of debrisoquine (urine debrisoquine to 4-hydroxydebrisoquine ratios of 0.28 to 6.56). The patients were treated with racemic metoprolol (two 100 mg tablets every 24 h) for 7 days. Serial blood samples were collected at times zero, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 22, and 24 h and urine at each 6 h period until 24 h after metoprolol administration. The plasma concentrations of the (-)-(S)- and (+)-(R)-metoprolol enantiomers were determined by HPLC using a chiral stationary phase (Chiralpak AD, 4.6 x 250 mm) and fluorescence detection. The enantiomeric ratios differing from one were evaluated by the paired t test and the results are reported as means (95% CI). No differences were observed between metoprolol enantiomers in half-lives and absorption, distribution and elimination rate constants. However, the following differences (p < 0.05) were observed between the (-)-(S) and (+)-(R) enantiomers: maximum plasma concentration, C(max), 179.99 (123. 33-236.64) versus 151.30 (95.04-207.57) ng/mL; area under the plasma concentration versus time curve, AUC(0-24)(SS), 929.85 (458.02-1401. 70) versus 782.11 (329.80-1234.40) ng h/mL; apparent total clearance, Cl(T)/f, 1.70 (0.79-2.61) versus 2.21 (1.06-3.36) L/h/kg, apparent distribution volume, Vd/f, 10.51 (6.35-14.68) versus 13.80 (6.93-20. 68) L/kg, and renal clearance, Cl(R), 0.06 (0.05-0.08) versus 0.07 (0.05-0.09) L/kg. The enantiomeric ratios AUC((-)-(S))/AUC((+)-(R)) ranged from 1.14 to 1.44, with a mean of 1.29.

    "118": "The stratum corneum, the rate-limiting barrier in transdermal drug delivery, is chiral in nature and enantiomers behave differently with respect to their transport across the skin, resulting in enantioselective permeation. The permeation characteristics of individual enantiomers of metoprolol free base (MB) were investigated using hairless mouse skin. The influence of chiral permeation enhancers, l-menthol and (+/-)-linalool, on the permeation of MB was also investigated. In the absence of enhancers, the permeation profiles of R- and S-MB from donor solutions containing either RS-MB or pure enantiomers are comparable (p < 0. 05). In presence of enhancers, l-menthol and (+/-)-linalool, the flux values were increased 2.4- to 3.0-fold, respectively, and the permeation profiles of R- and S-MB from donor solutions containing RS-MB are comparable (p < 0.05). However, when donor vehicle contains pure enantiomers, the permeation enhancing effect of l-menthol on S-MB was significantly higher (by 25%) than on R-MB (p < 0.05). Further, in presence of l-menthol, the flux of S-MB from donor solution containing pure S-MB was 35% higher than the flux of RS-MB from racemate. No such effect was seen with (+/-)-linalool. In all the investigations, no enantiomeric inversion was observed during the permeation process. The lag times were shorter in the case of l-menthol compared with (+/-)-linalool.", 
    "119": "Poor compliance with antihypertensive therapy is a major cause of unsatisfactory blood pressure control. The doctor has a key role in all steps that lead the patient to adopt a treatment and to take it as prescribed lifelong. Compliance with therapy is a parameter which is difficult to assess. There is often an important mismatch between the subjective views of physicians and patients regarding long-term drug taking. Electronic monitoring of compliance represents a valuable method to evaluate the \"real time\" compliance of the patient. Discussing a compliance recording with a patient may help to identify and solve problems linked with everyday adherence to antihypertensive treatment. Improving compliance is an important task not only for the doctors, but also for all healthcare providers.", 
    "120": "Three questions related to cancer and blood pressure are discussed. (i) Is cancer related in some way to hypertension, or to blood pressure? Several studies show a relation of blood pressure and cancer in populations. However, our own experience, based on a cohort of 15,411 subjects with BP measured in the 1970s and with 1,392 fatal cancers since, shows no relation of cancer risk and diastolic pressure. Nor were cancer numbers (n=72) observed in the 1,078 untreated hypertensives of the Glasgow Blood Pressure Clinic different from those expected (n=71.2) in a control population matched for age, sex and smoking habit. (ii) Do antihypertensive drugs promote cancer? Atenolol and calcium channel blockers have been suspected of this, but evidence of larger studies, including two of our own, is negative: relative risk for cancer in our patients taking CCB was 1.02 (CI 0.82-1.27). (iii) Do antihypertensive drugs protect against cancer? A study of ours based on the Glasgow Clinic raises this possibility: relative risk for incident cancer amongst 1,559 patients taking ACE inhibitor was 0.72 (CI 0.55-0.92).", 
    "121": "The need for drug combinations in the management of hypertension arises from the fact that the majority of hypertensive patients need at least two drugs to control the blood pressure to below 140/90 mmHg. The importance of achieving such goal blood pressures is emphasised by longitudinal studies demonstrating that the achieved blood pressure is the main determinant of outcome and from population surveys in a number of countries that reveal that in general, less than 30% of treated hypertensive patients have blood pressures below 140/90 mmHg. Good combinations of antihypertensive drugs use agents from different classes with different primary actions so that the hypotensive effects are fully additive while side effects are minimised. The particular value of combining drugs for treating hypertension is that it permits the use of low doses, which in turn improves adherence to therapy and control of hypertension. Effective combinations for the treatment of essential hypertension and of systolic hypertension in the elderly are discussed, as are the potential advantages of fixed low dose combinations.", 
    "122": "There are several lines of evidence implicating increased sympathetic activity not only in the maintenance of raised blood pressure but in the pathophysiology of hypertensive complications including atherosclerosis. Beta blockers are one of the best documented classes of drugs in terms of long term safety and improvement in outcome in hypertension. They are also well established to reduce reinfarction in patients after myocardial infarction and to improve survival in patients with congestive heart failure. Side effects of beta blockers are predictable and result from excess pharmacological activity. They can often be controlled by dose adjustments. Alpha blockers reduce peripheral resistance. They are as effective as other classes at lowering blood pressure although to date there is little or no long term outcome data with this class. Reduction of sympathetic activity with beta and/or alpha blockers should remain amongst the first choices for monotherapy (or add-on therapy) in essential hypertension.", 
    "123": "Thiazide diuretics have antihypertensive efficacy equivalent to that of the other major classes of antihypertensive drug, and are at least as well tolerated as judged by discontinuation rates and measures of quality of life. They are effective when given once daily, require no dose titration, have few contraindications, and have additive effects when combined with drugs of other classes. The dose-response relation for blood pressure is flat, whereas the subjective and biochemical side-effects are dose-dependent. They should be prescribed only at low dosage. Treatment regimens based on low-dose thiazide prevent stroke, coronary events, heart failure and renal failure in hypertension, and have proven safety. Thiazides are inexpensive. Low-dose thiazides should be preferred for routine first-line treatment of hypertension unless they are contraindicated or there is a compelling indication for an alternative class of drug.", 
    "124": "Established in 1968 the Glasgow Blood Pressure Clinic has over 11,000 patients on its computer record. Up to 1980, mortality from all-causes and from cardiovascular causes was high: relative risks compared with two local control populations were greater than 2.0. Since 1980, all-cause mortality has decreased to 1.31 (859 deaths, CI 1.23-1.39). Lower mortality from cardiovascular causes, particularly coronary heart disease, contributes to the decrease. Reasons for the decrease are under investigation currently. Referral of patients with slightly lower blood pressure contributes, as may better blood pressure control with newer antihypertensive drugs. ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers were introduced in 1980 and during the 16-year period to 1995, all-cause mortality has decreased most in patients taking ACE inhibitor. A decrease also occurred in patients taking antihypertensive drugs other than ACE inhibitor.", 
    "125": "Overviews (meta-analyses) of the major ongoing randomized trials of blood pressure lowering drugs will be conducted to determine the effects of: first, newer versus older classes of blood pressure lowering drugs in patients with hypertension; and second, blood pressure lowering treatments versus untreated or less treated control conditions in patient groups at high risk of cardiovascular events. The principal study outcomes are stroke, coronary heart disease, total cardiovascular events and total cardiovascular deaths. The overviews have been prospectively designed and will be conducted on individual patient data. The analyses will be conducted as a collaboration between the principal investigators of participating trials involving about 270,000 patients. Full data should be available in 2003, with the first round of analyses performed in 1999-2000. The combination of trial results should provide good statistical power to detect even modest differences between the effects on the main study outcomes.", 
    "126": "In 1998 the final results were presented of two large intervention trials in hypertension, the Hypertension Optimal Treatment Study (HOT) and the Captopril Prevention Project (CAPPP). Both were initiated from Sweden although the HOT Study was conducted in 26 countries worldwide and the CAPPP Study in Finland and Sweden. The HOT and CAPPP trials and their principal results will be reviewed briefly here. In addition a brief up-date will be provided of three ongoing intervention trials in hypertension that were also initiated from Sweden: the Swedish Trial in Old Patients with Hypertension-2 (STOP-Hypertension-), the Nordic Diltiazem (NORDIL) Study and the Study on Cognition and Prognosis in Elderly Hypertensives (SCOPE).", 
    "127": "In urethane-anesthetized rats, microinjection of angiotensin II (AII) into either the subfornical organ (SFO), nucleus paraventricularis (NPV), or rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVL), respectively, all induced pressor responses, but the heart rate remained unchanged. Preinjection of [Sar1, Thr8]-angiotensin II (ST-AII, an AII antagonist) into bilateral NPV blocked the SFO-pressor response to AII. Bilateral RVL pretreated with ST-All markedly attenuated the pressor response of the SFO or NPV to AII. Hexamethonium or methyl atropine (IV) also reduced the SFO-pressor response. The results show that All can activate the SFO, NPV, and RVL successively, thereby inducing the pressor response; both excitation of sympathetic nerves and inhibition of the cardiac vagus are involved in this response.", 
    "128": "To investigate the feasibility of a confocal Raman spectroscopic technique for the noninvasive assessment of corneal hydration in vivo in two legally blind subjects.", 
    "129": "A laser beam (632.8 nm; 15 mJ) was maintained on the cornea by using a microscope objective lens (x25 magnification, NA = 0.5, f = 10 mm) both for focusing the incident light as well as collecting the Raman backscattered light, in a 180 degrees backscatter configuration. An optical fiber, acting as the confocal pinhole for elimination of light from out-of-focus places, was coupled to a spectrometer that dispersed the collected light onto a sensitive array detector for rapid spectral data acquisition over a range from 2,890 to 3,590/cm(-1). Raman spectra were recorded from the anterior 100-150 microm of the cornea over a period before and after topical application of a mild dehydrating solution. The ratio between the amplitudes of the signals at 3,400/cm(-1) (OH-vibrational mode of water) and 2,940/cm(-1) (CH-vibrational mode of proteins) was used as a measure for corneal hydration.", 
    "130": "High signal-to-noise ratio (SNR = 25) Raman spectra were obtained from the human corneas by using 15 mJ of laser light energy. Qualitative changes in the hydration of the anteriormost part of the corneas could be observed as a result of the dehydrating agent.", 
    "131": "With adequate improvements in system safety, confocal Raman spectroscopy could potentially be applied clinically as a noninvasive tool for the assessment of corneal hydration in vivo.", 
    "132": "We examined the effects of hydroxyl radicals (OH.) on human myocardial contractility and on sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) activity and the effects of the beta-receptor antagonists metoprolol, carvedilol, and its metabolite BM-910228.", 
    "133": "Isometric force of contraction was determined in isolated human myocardium. H(2)O(2) 1 mmol/L and Fe(3+)-nitrilotriacetic acid (Fe(3+)-NTA) 0.1 mmol/L used for generation of OH. induced a decrease in basal force of contraction and an increase in diastolic tension in atrial and left ventricular myocardial preparations. After challenge with OH., the maximum positive inotropic response to Ca(2+) 1.8 to 15 mmol/L was decreased by 60% and by 39%, respectively. The effects of OH. could be blocked by catalase. Carvedilol and its metabolite BM-910228 attenuated the OH.-induced impairment of the inotropic response to Ca(2+) in atrial myocardial preparations. Metoprolol had no significant effect. The stimulation frequency (0.5 to 3.0 Hz)-dependent increase in force of contraction and decrease in diastolic tension were abolished after exposure of atrial trabeculae to OH. In parallel, SERCA activity was decreased by OH. concentration-dependently, as determined in myocardial membrane preparations. BM-910228 partially restored the force-frequency relationship and preserved SERCA activity.", 
    "134": "OH. radicals induce an impairment of contraction and relaxation and an attenuation of the force-frequency relationship in human myocardium accompanied by an inhibition of SERCA. Carvedilol and BM-910228 partly prevented OH.-induced contractile dysfunction. These observations could explain the improvement of ejection fraction in heart failure trials with carvedilol without a restoration of beta-adrenergic receptor density.", 
    "135": "Spontaneous and evoked activity of neurons in the sensorimotor cortex was recorded in cats with learned conditioned placing reaction before, during, and after the iontophoretic application of synaptically active substances. It was shown that apart from direct excitatory effect on the cortical neurons during its application, glutamate (Glu) exerted some modulatory influence on unit activity in subsequent 20 min. Noradrenaline suppressed the background and evoked activity through beta 1 adrenoreceptors. Activation of beta 2 adrenoreceptors by metaproterenol was accompanied by facilitation of the background and evoked activity during application and 10-20 min after. The joint application of Glu and metaproterenol improved facilitation of neuronal responses evoked by conditioned stimuli. Application of levodopa, like Glu, increased the background and evoked activity of many sensorimotor cortical neurons. The joint effect of Glu and levodopa was not substantially more intensive than the changes produced by the isolated application of any of these substances. A nonselective blocker of DA1 and DA2 receptors haloperidol either increased or did not change the background and evoked activity of some cortical neurons. In contrast to isolated application of Glu, simultaneous application of Glu and haloperidol to neocortex suppressed the neuronal responses associated with conditioned movements. The results suggest that the Glu-induced potentiation is substantially realized through molecular mechanisms common for Glu and dopamine, probably, through Gi-proteins. The conclusion is drawn that the adrenergic and dopaminergic inputs to neocortical neurons are involved in the Glu-mediated plastic changes in the cortex during conditioning.",

    "137": "20 postmenopausal 45-59-year-old women entered the trial of betaxolol. They had diastolic blood pressure 90-114 mm Hg. Beta-blockers were not contraindicated. Arterial pressure, heart rate, body mass, blood lipid spectrum, glucose and insulin levels were evaluated before the treatment, 1, 3 and 6 months after it.", 
    "138": "Betaxolol safely and effectively lowered blood pressure. Blood lipid spectrum remained unchanged. A transitory rise in fasting insulin levels did not worsen glucose tolerance despite a small gain in body mass. Menopausal syndrome relieved due to good effect of betaxolol on vasomotor disorders.", 
    "139": "Betaxolol has a good hypotensive effect in the absence of adverse effects on lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. A reduction of menopausal syndrome was also achieved.", 
    "140": "Brimonidine, a highly selective alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist, was studied to determine its ocular hypotensive effect and side effects in patients with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) while on continuing therapy with timolol. This was a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study in 15 patients with primary open-angle or pseudoexfoliation glaucoma on therapy receiving timolol 0.5% twice daily, with IOP greater than or equal to 22 mm Hg in one eye. IOP measurements, blood pressure and pulse rate were assessed on 2 days at a baseline and 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h later. A single drop of brimonidine 0.2% or placebo was added to treatment with timolol. The reductions in IOP at all time intervals observed with brimonidine + timolol were significantly greater than those with timolol + placebo. The maximum mean net decrease in IOP was 19.23 +/- 10.60% at 4 h. Statistically significant decreases in systemic blood pressure and pulse rate without clinical symptoms were observed in the group receiving brimonidine + timolol. This study suggests that a combination of brimonidine and timolol may have potential in the treatment of glaucoma. Further clinical trials with brimonidine are indicated to assess its further role as adjunctive agent.", 
    "141": "The slow delayed rectifier potassium current (I(Ks)) is unique in its slow activation and deactivation kinetics. It is important during cardiac repolarization, especially when the heart rate is fast. We compared the effects of quinidine, procainamide, sotalol, and amiodarone on I(Ks) and correlated the findings with the clinical reverse use-dependent effects of potassium channel blockers. Human minK RNA was obtained by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using explanted human heart. The RNA was injected into Xenopus oocytes for heterologous expression of I(Ks). A two-electrode voltage clamp technique was performed to investigate the I(Ks). We demonstrated that quinidine, sotalol and procainamide had no effects on I(Ks) up to a concentration of 300 microM while amiodarone inhibited I(Ks) in a concentration-dependent manner starting from 10 microM. The inhibition by amiodarone was state-dependent with gradual unblocking after depolarization. The degree of inhibition was 53% immediately after depolarization and 19% at the end of a 5-second depolarization. I(Ks) is 30 times more sensitive to amiodarone than to quinidine, sotalol, and procainamide. Quinidine, sotalol and procainamide have reverse use-dependent effects while amiodarone does not. This is compatible with the hypothesis that no inhibition of I(Ks) at clinical concentrations contributes to the clinical reverse use-dependent effects.", 
    "142": "The aim of our study was to examine the effects of different purine nucleotides [GTP, ITP, and xanthosine 5'-triphosphate (XTP)] on receptor/G protein coupling. As a model system, we used a fusion protein of the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor and the alpha subunit of the G protein G(s). GTP was more potent and efficient than ITP and XTP at inhibiting ternary complex formation and supporting adenylyl cyclase (AC) activation. We also studied the effects of several beta(2)-adrenergic receptor ligands on nucleotide hydrolysis and on AC activity in the presence of GTP, ITP, and XTP. The efficacy of agonists at promoting GTP hydrolysis correlated well with the efficacy of agonists for stimulating AC in the presence of GTP. This was, however, not the case for ITP hydrolysis and AC activity in the presence of ITP. The efficacy of ligands at stimulating AC in the presence of XTP differed considerably from the efficacies of ligands in the presence of GTP and ITP, and there was no evidence for receptor-regulated XTP hydrolysis. Our findings support the concept of multiple ligand-specific receptor conformations and demonstrate the usefulness of purine nucleotides as tools to study conformational states of receptors.", 
    "143": "In contrast to beta(1)-adrenoreceptor (beta(1)-AR) signaling, beta(2)-AR stimulation in cardiomyocytes augments L-type Ca(2+) current in a cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)-dependent manner but fails to phosphorylate phospholamban, indicating that the beta(2)-AR-induced cAMP/PKA signaling is highly localized. Here we show that inhibition of G(i) proteins with pertussis toxin (PTX) permits a full phospholamban phosphorylation and a de novo relaxant effect following beta(2)-AR stimulation, converting the localized beta(2)-AR signaling to a global signaling mode similar to that of beta(1)-AR. Thus, beta(2)-AR-mediated G(i) activation constricts the cAMP signaling to the sarcolemma. PTX treatment did not significantly affect the beta(2)-AR-stimulated PKA activation. Similar to G(i) inhibition, a protein phosphatase inhibitor, calyculin A (3 x 10(-8) M), selectively enhanced the beta(2)-AR but not beta(1)-AR-mediated contractile response. Furthermore, PTX and calyculin A treatment had a non-additive potentiating effect on the beta(2)-AR-mediated positive inotropic response. These results suggest that the interaction of the beta(2)-AR-coupled G(i) and G(s) signaling affects the local balance of protein kinase and phosphatase activities. Thus, the additional coupling of beta(2)-AR to G(i) proteins is a key factor causing the compartmentalization of beta(2)-AR-induced cAMP signaling.", 
    "144": "To measure the time effect profiles of a once daily administered combination tablet felodipine-metoprolol 5/50 mg (Logimax, Astra) and amlodipine 5 mg (Norvasc, Pfizer) on blood pressure and heart rate using 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.", 
    "145": "Randomized multicentre parallel-group study with a single-blind placebo run-in period of 4 weeks duration and a 6-week double-blind active treatment period.", 
    "146": "Out of 245 randomized outpatients (90 men, 155 women) with uncomplicated mild-to-moderate primary hypertension and mean sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 95-115 mmHg inclusive, 212 (102 on felodipine-metoprolol, 110 on amlodipine) were eligible for analysis. 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed at the end of the placebo run-in (baseline) and after 6 weeks active treatment (posttreatment).", 
    "147": "Both felodipine-metoprolol and amlodipine induced smooth and consistent reduction in DBP and systolic blood pressure throughout the 24-h period, hence not altering the diurnal rhythm. However, felodipine-metoprolol reduced all average blood pressures (24-h, day- and night-time) more than amlodipine (for 24-h average blood pressure 14.4/9.5 mmHg and 8.9/5.5 mmHg, respectively). Medians of individual diastolic trough-to-peak (T/P) ratios were similar for felodipine-metoprolol and amlodipine (54 and 50%, respectively), while for the systolic T/P ratios, the corresponding values were 74 and 35%, repectively; no significant difference between treatments was seen. As distinguished from amlodipine, both heart rate and rate pressure product were markedly decreased on felodipine-metoprolol throughout the 24-h period and even during the early morning hours. In general, both treatments were well tolerated.", 
    "148": "Both felodipine-metoprolol and amlodipine achieved optimal control of blood pressure during the inter-dosing interval in line with their pharmokinetic profiles. The vasodilatory adverse events were slightly more reported with felodipine-metoprolol combination, but due to more pronounced lowering of the average blood pressures and the potent additional effect on heart rate and rate pressure product, the efficacy/tolerability balance seems to be equal to or better than that obtained with monotherapy such as amlodipine."
