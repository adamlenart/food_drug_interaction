A total of 86 patients (61 men and 25 women with a mean age of 49.4 years and a mean blood pressure [and standard deviation] at entry into the trial of 155.5 [15.7]/101.0 [6.3] mm Hg) received enalapril, and 94 patients (63 men and 31 women with a mean age of 50.9 years and a mean blood pressure at entry of 156.6 [16.6]/101.2 [5.7] mm Hg) received atenolol. After a placebo run-in period the patients received increasing dosages of medication every 2 weeks until the target diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or less was achieved on two consecutive visits, the maximum dosage was reached, or the patient withdrew because of adverse effects. At 14 weeks the mean blood pressure was 141.6 (18.0)/90.1 (9.5) mm Hg in the enalapril group (61 patients) and 140.0 (17.1)/88.4 (8.7) mm Hg in the atenolol group (54 patients). The target diastolic blood pressure was achieved on completion of therapy (between weeks 10 and 14) in 67 (77%) of the patients receiving enalapril and 75 (79%) of the patients receiving atenolol. Compliance was similar in the two groups. Seven patients withdrew because of adverse effects, three in the enalapril group and four in the atenolol group. The results suggest that once-daily monotherapy with enalapril, 10 to 40 mg, is effective in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension and is as effective as and tolerated as well as once-daily therapy with atenolol, 50 to 100 mg.", 
    "1": "The synthesis is described of the enantiomerically pure (-)-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenylethylamino)-2-hydroxypropoxy] phenyl]-cis-crotonic acid nitrile (13b) (free base) and its hydrochloride (13c) (pacrinolol, Hoe 224 A) starting from p-hydroxyacetophenone (1) and racemic epichlorohydrin (2). The p-(2,3-oxidopropoxy)acetophenone (2) resulting from this reaction is C-homologisized to (8); reactions of this with homoveratrylamine (9) leads to (10a), the racemic structural analog of (13b). Resolution of the racemate is achieved by fractional crystallisation of the diastereoisomeric mandelates (13a) and (14a) to afford the enantiomerically pure title compound (13c) and its dextrarotatory optical antipode (14c). Structural confirmation of (13b) and (13c) was achieved through physicochemical and spectroscopic data especially from the 1H-NMR- and MS-spectra. Pacrinolol (13c) is a highly cardioselective beta-sympathicolytic with significant and long acting blood pressure lowering properties (intravenous and oral in the dog).", 
    "2": "On the basis of saturation binding studies on rat cardiac microsomes, which contained a mixed population of beta-adrenoceptor subtypes, [3H]CGP-12177 is presumed to be a non-selective beta-adrenergic radioligand. However, saturation binding studies carried out in the presence of subtype-saturating concentrations of the beta 2-selective antagonist ICI 118,551 and the beta 1-selective antagonist ICI 89,406, respectively, revealed a KD for beta 1-adrenoceptors of 0.33 +/- 0.02 nmol/l and a KD for beta 2-adrenoceptors of 0.90 +/- 0.14 nmol/l. Competition experiments with the highly selective antagonists revealed greatly different competition binding curves in the presence of either [3H]CGP-12177 or (-)[125I]iodocyanopindolol (ICYP), a beta-adrenergic radioligand considered to be as non-selective as [3H]CGP-12177. The following results are further suggestive for a selectivity of [3H]CGP-12177 for beta 1-adrenoceptors: (1) Using non-linear regression analysis, a significantly lower selectivity (expressed as the ratio of the IC50 for beta 2-adrenoceptors to the IC50 for beta 1-adrenoceptors) as well as a larger proportion of beta 1-adrenoceptors were calculated by competition of the beta 1-selective antagonist ICI 89,406 with [3H]CGP-12177 binding than by competition of ICI 89,406 with ICYP binding; (2) reducing the [3H]CGP-12177 concentration from 2 to 0.4 nmol/l, competition experiments with ICI 89,406 led to an increase in the estimated selectivity of the competitor and in the estimated proportion of beta 1-adrenoceptors; (3) reverse findings were obtained with ICI 118,551, a beta 2-selective antagonist.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "3": "To assess the importance of anti-adrenergic and anti-serotonergic activities of bunitrolol for its efficacy as an antihypertensive and antianginal agent, effects of this substance on the binding of adrenergic and serotonergic agents to the respective receptors of the rat brain, rat heart, dog brain, and/or dog aorta were examined using the radioligand binding assay methods. In addition, the pA2 values of bunitrolol as an antagonist against the positive chronotropic and inotropic actions (beta 1-adrenoceptor) of isoproterenol were also determined by pharmacological methods using the isolated guinea pig atria. To assess the specificity, pA2 values were also obtained in the isolated trachea (beta 2-adrenoceptor) using isoproterenol as an agonist and in the isolated aorta from the guinea pig and the rat using phenylephrine as an agonist (alpha 1-adrenoceptor). A strong inhibition by bunitrolol of 3H-dihydroalprenolol (3H-DHA) binding to beta-adrenoceptors was observed, while the inhibition of 3H-prazosin binding to alpha 1-adrenoceptors, 3H-serotonin binding to 5HT1-receptors. 3H-p-aminoclonidine binding to alpha 2-adrenoceptors, and 3H-ketanserin binding to 5HT2-receptors were found to be very weak. The rank order of antagonistic potencies of bunitrolol against the adrenergic receptors as assessed with pA2 values were beta 1 greater than beta 2 much greater than alpha 1. From these two different types of experiments, it is clear that the antihypertensive and antianginal effects of bunitrolol are mainly due to its beta-blocking actions, with the alpha 1-blocking action of this drug playing a minor role.", 
    "4": "1. Ketanserin or slow-release nifedipine were added to the treatment of 24 patients with hypertension uncontrolled by a thiazide diuretic plus beta-adrenoceptor antagonist in an observer-blind, randomised parallel-group study of 6 months duration. 2. At 6 months the mean falls in supine blood pressure were for ketanserin (mean daily dose 77 mg) 7/5 mm Hg and for nifedipine (mean daily dose 62 mg) 27/10 mm Hg. The difference between the treatments was significant for systolic blood pressure (P less than 0.02) and mean arterial pressure (P less than 0.05). Six nifedipine-treated patients reached target blood pressure, compared with one patient with ketanserin (P less than 0.02). 3. One patient taking nifedipine, and none taking ketanserin withdrew because of side-effects. The tolerability of the two drugs was broadly similar. 4. Ketanserin treatment was associated with significant changes in supine pulse rate (-8 beats min-1, P less than 0.05) and corrected QT interval (+27 ms, P less than 0.05). Nifedipine treatment had no effect on these variables. The change in pulse rate was significantly different between the groups. 5. In patients treated with a diuretic and beta-adrenoceptor blocker who required additional treatment ketanserin was significantly inferior to nifedipine.", 
    "5": "1. The beta-adrenoceptor antagonist activity, cardioselectivity and antilipolytic properties of Koe 3290 were investigated in healthy subjects. 2. Koe 3290 12.5, 25, 50 and 100 mg, atenolol 25, 50 and 100 mg and placebo were given in double-blind randomised order to eight subjects. All doses of both Koe 3290 and atenolol reduced supine, standing and exercise heart rate (P less than 0.02). From 2 to 8 h after administration the exercise heart rate after Koe 3290 100 mg was similar to that for atenolol 50 mg. 3. The cardioselectivity of Koe 3290 and atenolol was compared. Koe 3290 50, 100 and 150 mg, atenolol 50 and 100 mg and placebo were given to six subjects in a double-blind random order. Isoprenaline dose-response curves were constructed for cardiovascular parameters and finger tremor. 4. For doses which were equipotent at the beta 1-adrenoceptor (Koe 3290 100 mg and atenolol 50 mg) atenolol caused less attenuation of heart rate, diastolic blood pressure, forearm blood flow and finger tremor (P less than 0.02). 5. There was no difference in the isoprenaline-induced changes in serum free fatty acids, blood glucose, plasma lactate or potassium after Koe 3290 and atenolol. Koe 3290 attenuated the rise in serum insulin more than atenolol (P less than 0.02). 6. Koe 3290 is an effective beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug in man. It is not as cardioselective as atenolol and does not possess specific antilipolytic properties.", 
    "6": "1. The effects of single oral doses of three beta-adrenoceptor partial agonists (Ro 31-1118, flusoxolol and pindolol), two beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (propranolol and atenolol), two beta-adrenoceptor agonists (salbutamol and prenalterol) and placebo on sleeping heart rate, quality of sleep, supine heart rate, exercise heart rate, blood pressure, forearm blood flow and finger tremor were studied in eight healthy male volunteers. 2. Sleeping heart rate was increased by Ro 31-1118, flusoxolol, pindolol, salbutamol and prenalterol and decreased by propranolol and atenolol. 3. None of the drugs studied affected quality of sleep. 4. Supine heart rate was increased by flusoxolol, prenalterol and salbutamol, unaffected by Ro 31-1118 and pindolol and reduced by propranolol and atenolol. 5. Exercise heart rate was reduced by both beta-adrenoceptor antagonists and the three partial agonists and unaffected by salbutamol and prenalterol. 6. Systolic blood pressure was increased by Ro 31-1118, flusoxolol, salbutamol and prenalterol, unaffected by pindolol and reduced by propranolol and atenolol. Diastolic blood pressure was reduced by salbutamol and prenalterol. 7. Forearm blood flow was increased by Ro 31-1118, salbutamol and prenalterol, unchanged by pindolol and flusoxolol and decreased by atenolol and propranolol. 8. Finger tremor was increased by Ro 31-1118, flusoxolol, pindolol, salbutamol, and prenalterol. 9. beta-adrenoceptor partial agonists have different effects on the cardiovascular system and finger tremor to beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. 10. While Ro 31-1118 and flusoxolol are antagonists mainly at the beta 1-adrenoceptor they have agonist activity at both beta 1- and beta 2 adrenoceptors. 11. While pindolol is a non-selective antagonist its agonist activity is mainly at the beta 2-adrenoceptor.", 
    "7": "In rats with inflammation induced by turpentine injection, changes in drug disposition occur in-vivo and in the perfused isolated liver. Therefore the biotransformation of a low extraction drug, antipyrine, and of two high extraction drugs, lignocaine and propranolol, has been evaluated in the 9000g supernatant fraction of the liver of turpentine-treated rats. Aminopyrine N-demethylase activity and cytochrome P450 content were also measured. Turpentine treatment significantly reduced the in-vitro breakdown of the three drugs; aminopyrine N-demethylase activity and cytochrome P450 content were also decreased. Similar results were found in the proadifen-treated rats, except that in those, the cytochrome P450 content was slightly increased. The changes in drug disposition seen after turpentine-induced inflammation, could therefore be due in part to a change in hepatic enzymatic activity.", 
    "8": "The efficacy and safety of labetalol therapy were evaluated in 20 patients 60 years and older with isolated systolic or diastolic hypertension and 19 patients aged younger than 60 years with diastolic hypertension. After a two-week placebo washout period, labetalol was titrated for up to four weeks (100-400 mg bid) until blood pressure control was achieved (standing systolic less than 160 mm Hg or greater than or equal to 10% reduction from baseline, and standing diastolic less than 90 mm Hg or a decrease of 10 mm Hg from baseline). Mean decreases in standing systolic and diastolic blood pressure from baseline were statistically significant for both age groups (greater than or equal to 60 years, -23/-13; less than 60 years, -18/-12, P less than .01). Control criteria were met in 18 (90%) older and 15 (79%) younger patients who then entered a four-week maintenance period. Sixteen (80%) of the older patients and six (32%) of the younger patients maintained blood pressure control on 200 mg or less of labetalol bid (P less than .05). Three patients, two of whom withdrew from the study, were judged to have experienced adverse events that were drug related. It was concluded that labetalol was effective and well-tolerated antihypertensive therapy in both elderly and younger patients. In addition, significantly less medication was required to achieve blood pressure control in the elderly.", 
    "9": "A single-blind study was conducted in 52 hypertensive patients, aged 25 to 68 years, to compare the side effects of an equally effective antihypertensive regimen of propranolol and atenolol. All patients had a history of side effects with beta-blocker therapy. Patients were treated with propranolol 40 to 160 mg bid for 8 weeks, followed by atenolol 50 to 100 mg given once daily for 8 weeks, and then rechallenged with the required dosage of propranolol for 8 weeks. Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures were controlled during all three treatment phases. Side effects showed a definite trend toward improvement during the atenolol treatment phase. CNS side effects, in particular, showed significantly (P less than .05) reduced severity scores and overall incidence rates during the atenolol treatment phase. In conclusion, this study showed that at equally effective antihypertensive dosages the hydrophilic beta blocker atenolol produced significantly fewer CNS side effects than the lipophilic beta blocker propranolol.", 
    "10": "Direct ligand binding techniques have been used to compare beta-adrenergic receptors, muscarinic cholinergic receptors and imipramine binding sites in human tumoral and healthy lungs removed from eleven patients during operations. Beta-adrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic receptors are present in tumoral tissues but their concentrations were decreased compared to healthy tissues. Imipramine binding sites were absent. It is concluded that this type of studies could bring additional information to morbid anatomy analysis and be used to follow illness evolution.", 
    "11": "1. The effect of isoprenaline (10 microM at 37 degrees C for 30 min) pretreatment on [125I]-(-)-pindolol ([125I]-(-)-Pin) binding to beta 2-adrenoceptors on intact human platelets has been examined. 2. By use of saturation analysis, maximal binding capacity (Bmax) of [125I]-(-)-Pin binding in control and treated cells was assessed in the presence of 1 microM (-)-propranolol or 1 microM (+/-)-CGP 12177 which were taken to represent total or cell surface beta-adrenoceptors respectively. Assay incubations were performed at 37 degrees C and 4 degrees C, the latter to prevent recycling of internalised receptors. 3. Isoprenaline treatment resulted in an identical, highly significant, loss of binding sites (approximately equal to 25%) defined by (-)-propranolol at both assay temperatures as compared to control cells. Binding sites identified in the presence of (+/-)-CGP 12177 were reduced to a much greater extent (approximately equal to 70%), but this was only seen when assays were performed at 4 degrees C. 4. Agonist-induced changes in receptor numbers were concentration-dependent with half maximal receptor loss occurring at an isoprenaline concentration of approximately 2 x 10(-8) M. These effects were inhibited by the presence of a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist and absent if agonist pretreatment was performed at 4 degrees C. 5. Recovery experiments showed that the isoprenaline-induced reduction in total receptor number defined by (-)-propranolol was irreversible whereas the reduction in cell surface receptors defined by (+/-)-CGP 12177 was rapidly reversible (less than 40 min). 6. These data suggest that isoprenaline treatment of intact human platelets causes redistribution of beta 2-adrenoceptors. A proportion are sequestered away from the cell surface (internalised), becoming inaccessible to the hydrophilic ligand (+/-)-CGP 12177. A smaller proportion defined by (-)-propranolol are apparently totally lost from the cell (down regulated).", 
    "12": "Sixteen patients with mild to moderate hypertension were randomized to receive either atenolol 100 mg a day (group A: 2 females, 6 males, mean age 42.3 years) or betaxolol 20 mg a day (group B: 8 males, mean age 49.3 years), both drugs given once daily for one month with a wash out on the 5th day. Pretreatment blood pressure was significantly higher in group B than in group A: this disparity, linked with randomization, hampered the comparison of the antihypertensive efficacy of both drugs but not the comparison of their pharmacodynamics. The maximal effect on resting supine blood pressure occurred later with betaxolol (4th day) than with atenolol (1st day), while the effect on peak exercise-blood pressure and heart rate was rapidly maximal (1st day) for both beta-blockers. The duration of the antihypertensive action at rest seemed to be nearly similar, while the effects of betaxolol on exercising heart rate and blood pressure were more prolonged than those of atenolol: on the wash out day, plasma atenolol and betaxolol levels fell in a same way but the increase in peak systolic blood pressure was more marked in group A than in group B, so that the positive correlation we found between the plasma drug levels and the percentage of peak systolic blood pressure reduction, was much closer with atenolol (p less than 0.001) than with betaxolol (p less than 0.05).", 
    "13": "Inotropic effects via cardiac alpha-adrenoceptors were studied in electrically driven auricular strips (1 Hz, 37 degrees C) from patients treated with beta-blockers for months prior to open heart surgery. Marked alpha-mediated positive inotropic effects were demonstrated with adrenaline (A), noradrenaline (NA) and phenylephrine (PHE) in the presence of beta-blocker and with blockers of the muscarinic receptor and of the neuronal and extraneuronal uptake mechanisms for the catecholamines. In the presence of approximately 10(-6) M propranolol the maximal effects as well as the potencies (pD2-values) for A and NA were not significantly different while higher than for PHE. The alpha 1-blocker, prazosin (10(-6) M), markedly reduced the pD2-values but not the intrinsic activities (alpha-values) for A, NA and PHE in the beta-blocked preparations. Methoxamine, however, induced negative inotropic responses at normal and low frequencies (1, 0.5 and 0.1 Hz) of stimulation, suggestive of non-specific, cardiodepressant effects. Other agonists with alpha-effects in other types of tissue (oxymethazoline, xylomethazoline and clonidine) were without effects on the force and velocity of contraction in the auricular strips under the present experimental conditions. The results show alpha 1-type of adrenoceptor-induced inotropic effects for A, NA and PHE during beta-blockade in human auricular strips, indicating that cardiac alpha 1-receptors may have clinical importance by increasing the inotropy of the human myocardium treated with beta-blocking agents.", 
    "14": "The qualitative characteristics of the inotropic response to increase in extracellular calcium (Cao) were studied in isolated, electrically driven, isometrically contracting rat papillary muscles. All experiments were done in the presence of adrenergic receptor blockers. Cao was increased in a cumulative way by exchanging a small fraction of the incubation solution with a corresponding solution with higher calcium concentration (8 mmol l-1). At any Cao level there was an almost proportional increase in parameters describing different parts of the contraction-relaxation cycle as compared with results at the preceding lower Cao level. Time to peak tension was prolonged at high compared with low Cao levels. The response to increased Cao was very similar to the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-independent inotropic response elicited through activation of alpha-adrenergic receptors (alpha-type response, Skomedal et al. 1982) and strikingly different from the cAMP-dependent inotropic response elicited, for example, through activation of beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-type response, Skomedal et al. 1982). As the inotropic response to increased Cao is known to be cAMP-independent (D\u00f6nges et al. 1977), the present results demonstrate the interrelationship between the regulatory function(s) and the direct effector function(s) of calcium in the myocardium.", 
    "15": "Lignocaine (lidocaine) and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists are widely used after acute myocardial infarction. The therapeutic value of these agents depends on the achievement and maintenance of safe and effective plasma concentrations. Lignocaine pharmacokinetics after acute myocardial infarction (MI) are controlled by a number of variables. The single most important is left ventricular function, which affects both volume of distribution and plasma clearance. Other major factors include bodyweight, age, hepatic function, the presence of obesity, and concomitant drug therapy. Lignocaine is extensively bound to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, a plasma protein which is also an acute phase reactant. Increases in alpha 1-acid glycoprotein concentration occur after an acute MI, decreasing the free fraction of lignocaine in the plasma and consequently decreasing total plasma lignocaine clearance without altering the clearance of non-protein-bound lignocaine. Complex changes in lignocaine disposition occur with long term infusions, and therefore early discontinuation of lignocaine infusions (within 24 hours) should be undertaken whenever possible. Because the risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmia declines rapidly after the onset of an acute MI, lignocaine therapy can be rationally discontinued within 24 hours in most patients. Lignocaine has a narrow toxic/therapeutic index, so that pharmacokinetic factors are critical in dose selection. In contrast, beta-adrenoceptor antagonists' adverse effects are more related to the presence of predisposing conditions (such as asthma, heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, etc.) than to plasma concentration. The pharmacokinetics of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists are important to help assure therapeutic efficacy, to provide information about the anticipated time course of drug action, and to predict the possible role of ancillary drug effects (such as direct membrane action) and loss of cardioselectivity. Lipid solubility is the main determinant of the pharmacokinetic properties of a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist. Lipid-soluble agents like propranolol and metoprolol are well absorbed orally, and undergo rapid hepatic metabolism, with important presystemic clearance and a short plasma half-life. Water-soluble drugs like sotalol, atenolol, and nadolol are less well absorbed, and are eliminated more slowly by renal excretion. Clinical assessment of beta-adrenoceptor antagonism is more valuable than plasma concentration determinations in evaluating the adequacy of the dose of a particular beta-adrenoceptor antagonist.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "16": "Ischaemic heart disease is one of the most serious health problems in the Western world. Angina is the commonest symptom and its therapy is still palliative, although complete relief from symptoms can generally be achieved by appropriate drugs or revascularization procedures. The degree of disability caused varies and therapeutic choice depends on patient characteristics and causative factors in the production of angina. This article reviews the management of angina from ischaemic heart disease assuming other causes like valvular disease, congenital anomalies, arteritis and cardiomyopathies have been excluded.", 
    "17": "The affinity constants of inhibition (Ki values) for both beta 1- and beta 2-receptor subtypes were determined for four different beta-adrenoceptor antagonists by a radioligand binding technique in a human myocardial membrane preparation. The radioligand was the high affinity antagonist [125I]-(-)-iodocyanopindolol (ICYP), and the drugs tested were atenolol, metoprolol, ICI 141,292 and ICI 118,551. Different concentrations of the drugs at test were allowed to compete with a constant concentration of ICYP for the specific binding sites (beta-receptors). Ki values for beta 1- and beta 2-receptors for each beta-adrenoceptor antagonist were developed from these data by computer calculations. Atenolol and metoprolol were found to differ slightly regarding potency (absolute Ki values) and to be practically equal regarding relative selectivity (approx. 40; i.e. ratio between high and low Ki values), while ICI 141,292 was found to have slightly higher relative selectivity (approx. 60) and much higher potency. All these drugs exhibited highest affinity for the beta 1-receptor population. In contrast, ICI 118,551 exhibited a very high relative selectivity (approx. 300) with highest affinity for the beta 2-receptor subtype. The method represents a good supplement to physiological and clinical examinations of selectivity of beta-blockers, and offers several advantages regarding simplicity, specificity and accuracy.", 
    "18": "Anaphylactoid reactions (ARs) occurring in patients receiving propranolol have been described as unusually severe and having a \"sluggish\" response to epinephrine. Although the mechanism of ARs to iodinated radiographic contrast media is not IgE mediated, because of widespread use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, we undertook a prospective study to determine the incidence of AR to radiographic contrast media during cardiac angiography. Nine hundred fifty-two consecutive patients were divided into four groups according to concomitant chronic medications. Group I (447 patients) were receiving no beta-adrenergic blocking agents or calcium antagonists. Group II (216 patients) were receiving a beta-adrenergic blocking agent. Group III (147 patients) were receiving a calcium antagonist but not a beta-adrenergic blocking agent. Group IV (142 patients) were receiving both a calcium antagonist and a beta-adrenergic blocking agent. The reaction rates, respectively, in the four groups were 4.47%, 7.41%, 5.44%, and 4.93%. The rates of ARs were not associated with the use of concomitant medications in any of the groups (chi 2 = 2.531; p = 0.47). The probability of a type II error in comparison of groups I and II was 0.75 should the true incidence of reactions in patients receiving beta-adrenergic antagonists be 7.41%. No difference in the incidence of AR was observed between patients taking selective and nonselective beta-adrenergic blocking agents in group II. Specific ARs occurring in patients receiving beta-adrenergic blocking agents were usually mild and often without need for specific pharmacotherapy.", 
    "19": "Cicloprolol is a cardioselective beta-1 partial agonist; its haemodynamic and radionuclide (nuclear stethoscope) effects were determined in 22 patients with impaired left ventricular function due to coronary artery disease. Following a 20 min stable control period, the effects of four doses of cicloprolol (0.025, 0.025, 0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg at 10 min intervals) were measured at rest 5-10 min after each intravenous injection. The effects of the cumulative 0.2 mg/kg dosage were assessed during supine bicycle exercise and compared with a control exercise period. At rest there were significant increases in systolic arterial without change in mean blood pressure. The heart rate and cardiac index were unchanged. There was a significant increase in left ventricular ejection fraction with a reduction in filling pressure and volume. Patients with resting heart rate below 75 beats/min and with ejection fraction greater than 35% showed the greatest improvement. During supine bicycle exercise, ejection fraction was increased compared to control (31 +/- 2 to 36 +/- 2; P less than 0.01), cardiac volume reduced and exercise tachycardia attenuated. These data suggest that cicloprolol may be of value where beta-blockade is considered in the presence of underlying left ventricular dysfunction due to ischaemic heart disease.", 
    "20": "Plasma potassium concentration was measured at admission in 1234 patients who presented with acute chest pain. One hundred and ninety five patients were on beta blockers before admission. The potassium concentrations of patients admitted early (within four hours of onset of symptoms) were compared with those admitted later (4-18 hours after onset of symptoms). There was a transient fall in plasma potassium concentrations in patients not pre-treated with beta blockers. This was not seen in patients who had been on beta blockers before admission. Non-selective beta blockers were more effective than cardioselective agents in maintaining concentrations of plasma potassium. These findings suggest a mechanism for the beneficial effects of beta blockers on morbidity and mortality in acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "21": "The correlation between the presence of areas of jeopardized myocardium and the electrocardiographic patterns of anterior and inferior Q-wave and non-Q-wave infarctions was studied in 486 patients who had had stable symptoms for at least six months after a single myocardial infarction. Myocardial jeopardy was identified on a ventriculogram in the right anterior oblique position if normal or hypokinetic wall motion was seen in all segments distal to a lesion that caused stenosis of greater than 50% and less than 100% in the proximal or mid left anterior descending coronary artery (anterior jeopardy), or in the proximal or mid right coronary artery or proximal circumflex coronary artery in a left dominant circulation (inferior jeopardy). Patients with non-Q-wave anterior infarctions had a significant increase in the frequency of jeopardized myocardium when compared with patients with Q-wave inferior or anterior infarctions. The group with non-Q-wave anterior infarction also had a significantly lower percentage of myocardial segments with absent wall motion in the area of infarction than all other groups. This combination of coronary narrowing with retained wall motion may contribute to the increased frequency of reinfarction seen in some studies of non-Q-wave infarction.", 
    "22": "The hemodynamic effects of oral bucindolol, a non-selective beta-adrenergic blocking agent with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and direct vasodilating properties, were studied at rest and during handgrip exercise with a flotation-directed pulmonary artery catheter in 12 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. After the initial dose of 150 mg of bucindolol, blood pressure (BP) was significantly reduced and cardiac output was increased (from 5.9 +/- 0.8 to 6.8 +/- 1.6 liters/min) in the supine position and during exercise (p less than 0.05). Systemic vascular resistance was reduced (from 1,555 +/- 339 to 1,311 +/- 467 dynes s cm-5, p less than 0.01) at rest and without significant changes during exercise. There were increases in heart rate (13 +/- 13%, p less than 0.01) and right atrial (69 +/- 77%, p less than 0.05), pulmonary arterial (38 +/- 24 %, p less than 0.001) and pulmonary artery wedge pressures (62 +/- 46%, p less than 0.001) during exercise. Bucindolol did not change these variables at rest or during exercise. Bucindolol increased plasma norepinephrine levels both at rest (from 330 +/- 151 to 588 +/- 320 ng/liter, p less than 0.01) and during exercise (from 468 +/- 220 to 685 +/- 390 ng/liter, p less than 0.05). After 4 weeks of bucindolol with doses of 50 to 200 mg 3 times daily, BP was reduced in both supine and standing positions (mean arterial BP of 11 +/- 7% [p less than 0.001] and 11 +/- 6% [p less than 0.001], respectively), without changes in cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance or plasma norepinephrine level.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "23": "After refraining from smoking for at least 8 hours, 22 adult male habitual smokers underwent baseline electrophysiologic study including atrial and ventricular burst pacing and programmed premature stimulation with single extrastimuli. After smoking 2 of their usual brand of cigarettes in rapid succession, the electrophysiologic protocol was repeated. Nicotine, catecholamine and carbon monoxide concentrations all increased significantly. Smoking increased heart rate and improved atrioventricular conduction in the 13 patients receiving chronic beta-blocker therapy (mostly for angina pectoris); increases in heart rate and improvement in atrioventricular conduction were not different statistically from those seen in patients not receiving beta-blocker therapy, suggesting the possibility of a direct effect of nicotine or other components of tobacco smoke. Ventricular refractoriness was not altered and atrial and ventricular arrhythmias were not increased by smoking. Persistent sympathomimetic actions of cigarette smoking may explain in part the failure of beta-blocking drugs to reduce cardiac mortality risk in smokers after myocardial infarction.", 
    "24": "Flestolol is an ultrashort-acting beta-blocking drug with a half-life of 6.9 minutes. Its antiarrhythmic efficacy was studied in 21 patients with spontaneous and inducible supraventricular tachycardia: atrioventricular (AV) nodal tachycardia in 6 patients and orthodromic AV reciprocating tachycardia in 15. It increased the effective refractory period of the AV node in all patients with AV nodal tachycardia (fast pathway, p less than 0.02; slow pathway, p less than 0.01), but did not alter the anterograde (n = 8) or retrograde (n = 9) refractory periods of accessory pathways. Flestolol prevented initiation of tachycardia by causing block in anterograde AV nodal conduction. It was more effective in patients with AV nodal tachycardia (5 of 6) than in those with AV reciprocating tachycardia (4 of 15, p less than 0.03). In patients in whom it was ineffective, the mean tachycardia cycle length increased by 54 ms because of an increase in AH interval (p less than 0.0001, n = 11). The cycle length of tachycardia induced 30 minutes after infusion was similar to the cycle length in the control state (354 vs 355 ms, n = 16). Flestolol's kinetics permitted clinically indicated electropharmacologic testing of a second antiarrhythmic drug in 8 patients and control of ventricular rate until arrhythmia surgery in 1 patient with incessant tachycardia. No hypotension or toxicity occurred. Our findings indicate that flestolol's principal antiarrhythmic effects are on the AV node, similar to the effects of other beta-blocking drugs. Its ultrashort duration of action is an advantage during electropharmacologic testing.",

A total of 317 patients with acute myocardial infarction were treated an average of 2.7 hours after the onset of chest pain during the course of a nonrandomized pilot investigation with 150 mg of rt-PA given over 6 hours. This dose of rt-PA resulted in a high rate of infarct-related coronary artery patency (82 and 87% of patients catheterized an average of either 1 or 32 hours after entry, respectively) and a low 21 day mortality rate of 4.4%. Coronary angioplasty was performed successfully in greater than 90% of patients with appropriate anatomy and in greater than 50% of those treated with rt-PA. In 75 patients treated within 2 hours of the onset of chest pain only 2 (2.7%) were dead by 6 weeks. However, five cases of intracranial hemorrhage were noted, and the rt-PA dose was subsequently reduced to 100 mg given over 6 hours. The TIMI II design and the results of the TIMI II pilot study are discussed.",

The influence of some S-S and -SH active agents on the ligand binding used was also examined. The decrease in membrane sialic acid content did not alter the binding of ligand used. The degradation of membrane protein by proteases resulted in a time and enzyme type dependent decrease in the binding of 125I-HYP. It was found that the dithiotreitol pretreatment produced more profound decrease in ligand binding than reduced glutathione. Cysteine and mercaptoethanol were ineffective. The effect of dithiotreitol was dependent on the time of preincubation and on the agent concentration used. The decrease in ligand binding was also observed after the alkylation of -SH groups by iodoacetamide and N-ethylmaleimide.", 
    "33": "Using anesthetized dogs, the coronary vascular effects of neuropeptide Y (NPY) were studied and the action of alpha- or serotonergic receptor blockade on the action of NPY was evaluated. To demonstrate the biological significance of the action of NPY, the vasoconstrictor potencies of NPY and norepinephrine were compared. One to 5 nmol of intracoronary NPY reduced coronary flow in a dose-dependent manner. The action started rather gradually and lasted for 10 min or more. Since perfusion pressure and central venous pressure were unchanged, the decrease in coronary flow should be a result of coronary vasoconstriction. Intracoronary norepinephrine infusion caused vasodilatation but when dogs were pretreated with 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg of systemic propranolol, a vasoconstrictor effect was observed at a 5 times higher dose than with NPY. Furthermore, the action of NE was only transient, lasting for 30 sec or less. The vasoconstrictor action of NPY was not antagonized by phentolamine or by ketanserin. Since NPY is an endogenous polypeptide found in the sympathetic nerve terminals around coronary arteries, it may participate in the regulation of coronary flow.", 
    "34": "The effect of catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine, isoproterenol, and phenylephrine) on cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP) level in isolated catfish (Ictalurus melas) liver cells was studied in the presence or absence of alpha (phentolamine) and beta (propranolol)-receptor antagonists. All catecholamines increased the hepatocyte cAMP level: the rank of their potency was epinephrine = isoproterenol greater than norepinephrine greater than phenylephrine. Propranolol completely blocked the catecholamine effect; phentolamine was ineffective. Results confirm previous findings (L. Brighenti, A. C. Puviani, M. E. Gavioli, and C. Ottolenghi, 1987, Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 66, 306-313) that epinephrine and norepinephrine act via beta-receptor activation. However, the comparison of the effects of isoproterenol and phenylephrine on cAMP with those on phosphorylase alpha and on glycogen breakdown suggests that a more complex mechanism is possibly involved in the catecholamine effect on catfish glycogenolysis.", 
    "35": "On the basis of the homology between the amino acid sequences of the beta-adrenergic receptor (beta AR) and the opsin proteins we have proposed that the ligand binding domain lies within the seven transmembrane hydrophobic regions of the protein, which are connected by hydrophilic regions alternatively exposed extracellularly and intracellularly. We have systematically examined the importance of each of these regions by making a sequential series of deletions in the gene for the hamster beta AR which encompass most of the protein coding region. The ability of the corresponding mutant receptors to be expressed, localized to the cell membrane, and bind beta-adrenergic ligands has been analyzed, using transient expression in COS-7 cells. The hydrophobic regions and the hydrophilic segments immediately adjacent to the membrane cannot be removed without affecting the processing and membrane localization of the beta AR. However, most of the hydrophilic regions appear to be dispensable for ligand binding. In addition, we observed that substitution of the conserved cysteine residues at positions 106 and 184 dramatically altered the ligand binding characteristics of the beta AR, suggesting the occurrence of a disulfide bond between these two residues in the native protein. These data are discussed in terms of the tertiary structure of the beta AR.", 
    "36": "We have used radioligand binding techniques and subcellular fractionation to assess whether changes in expression of myocardial alpha 1- and beta-adrenergic receptors are mediated by a redistribution of receptors between various membrane fractions. Three fractions were prepared from the left ventricles of guinea pigs that underwent either 1 h of ischemia or injection of epinephrine (0.25 mg/kg ip): a crude membrane, a purified sarcolemma, and a light vesicle fraction. In control animals alpha 1-adrenergic receptors ([3H]prazosin binding) in light vesicles was only 25% of the total alpha 1-receptor density found in sarcolemmal and light vesicle fractions as compared with 50% for beta-adrenergic receptors ([125I]iodocyanopindolol binding sites). Although ischemia was associated with a 53% decrease in the number of light vesicle beta-adrenergic receptors and a 42% increase in the number of sarcolemma beta-receptors (P less than 0.05), there was no change in the number of light vesicle alpha 1-receptors, even though the number of sarcolemmal alpha 1-receptors increased 34%. Epinephrine treatment promoted internalization of beta-adrenergic receptors; sarcolemma beta-receptors decreased 37% and light vesicle beta-receptors increased 28% (P less than 0.025). For alpha 1-receptors, epinephrine treatment decreased the number of sarcolemmal receptors 41% (P less than 0.025) but failed to increase the number of receptors in the light vesicle fraction. The changes in receptor binding to beta-adrenergic receptors in sarcolemmal fractions were mirrored by parallel changes in isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. These results indicate that alpha 1- and beta-adrenergic receptors may undergo a different cellular itinerary in guinea pig myocardium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "37": "Proximal tubules were isolated from the rat kidney by collagenase digestion of the cortical tissue followed by Percoll gradient centrifugation. Microscopic and hormone-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity studies proved the purity of the preparation. [3H]Prazosin, [3H]rauwolscine, and [125I]iodocyanopindolol were used to identify and quantitate respectively the alpha 1-, alpha 2- and beta-adrenergic receptors. Proximal tubular (F4) particulate fraction was compared against other cortical nephron segment (F1, F2) fractions and the total collagenase-digested cortex particulate suspension (Ft). Proximal tubules were enriched in alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors compared with Ft (alpha 1-receptor, 100.4 +/- 4.5 vs. 87.4 +/- 4.9; alpha 2-receptor, 250 +/- 16.2 vs. 185.1 +/- 12 fmol/mg protein). The fractions enriched in glomeruli and distal tubular segments (F1, F2) had relatively low concentrations of alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors. In contrast, beta-adrenergic receptor concentration in the proximal tubules was approximately 25% of that in the Ft fraction and approximately 10% of that in the F1 fraction. Isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activities in the different fractions corroborated well with the pattern suggested by the [125I]iodocyanopindolol binding studies. Our results suggest that whole-cortex preparation radioligand binding studies may reflect proximal tubular alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenergic receptor changes quite well. They may, however, miss or give erroneous impressions about beta-adrenergic receptor changes occurring in different cortical nephron segments.", 
    "38": "Intracellular recordings of membrane potassium current were made from rat locus coeruleus in vitro. The effects of agonists at mu-opioid receptors were studied on neurons from rats that had been chronically treated with morphine; these were compared with actions on neurons from control rats. Tolerance to the opioid-induced increase in potassium conductance was observed, and this was more pronounced for normorphine than for [Met5]enkephalin and [D-Ala2, Mephe4, Gly5-ol]enkephalin: experiments with the irreversible receptor blocker beta-chlornaltrexamine indicated that normorphine had lower intrinsic efficacy than [Met5]enkephalin and [D-Ala2 MePhe4, Gly5-ol]enkephalin. This adaptation was not due to any change of the properties of the potassium conductance activated by mu-receptors because both full and partial agonists at alpha 2-adrenoceptors, which couple to the same potassium conductance, were unchanged in their effectiveness; nor was it associated with any change in the affinity of mu-receptors for the antagonist naloxone. Naloxone had no effect on the neurons other than simple competitive reversal of the action of the mu-receptor agonists. These results demonstrate that 1) the mechanism responsible for tolerance in locus coeruleus neurons is specifically associated with mu-receptors and/or their coupling to potassium channels, 2) the intrinsic efficacy of an opioid determines the degree of tolerance observed, and 3) tolerance and physical dependence can be dissociated at the cellular level.", 
    "39": "The effects of transmural nerve stimulation (TNS) on contractile responses of rat and guinea pig atria were analyzed pharmacologically. Isolated left atria were electrically driven through AgAgCl field electrodes and TNS was performed by brief introduction of defined stimulation patterns through the same electrodes. Step elevations in stimulating voltage induced biphasic inotropic responses in the left atria of both species: an initial negative component which was usually overwhelmed by a subsequent positive one. The transient negative inotropic response was induced by parasympathetic cholinergic nerve excitation, inasmuch as it was abolished by atropine. In the left atrium of the rat, the TNS-induced positive inotropic response was due exclusively to adrenergic nerve excitation through activation of beta-1 adrenoceptors. In contrast, analysis of the time course of responses in guinea pig left atria after nerve stimulation at 10 Hz revealed a positive inotropic response consisting of two phases; rapid and delayed phases were superimposed upon each other. The rapid phase was reduced by atenolol, a beta-1 antagonist, and attenuated further by prazosin, an alpha-1 antagonist. In the presence of both atenolol and prazosin, TNS of guinea pig left atria still induced a positive inotropic response but it had a slow onset and decay. This is termed the delayed phase response. TNS induced a similar delayed inotropic response in atria from surgically sympathectomized or reserpine-pretreated guinea pigs, from which catecholamine-fluorescence nerves and responses to tyramine were absent. These results demonstrate that TNS excitated adrenergic, cholinergic and nonadrenergic noncholinergic nerves in guinea pig left atria.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "40": "MCI-154 is a new positive inotropic agent with vasodilating property. Experiments were carried out in the canine isolated right ventricular muscle in order to elucidate whether or not cyclic AMP is involved in the positive inotropic effect (PIE) of MCI-154. MCI-154 (10(-7) to 10(-4) M) produced a concentration-dependent PIE amounting to 75% of the maximal effect of isoproterenol. MCI-154 did not affect the time to peak tension and had a tendency to shorten the relaxation time and total duration of contraction. Pindolol, reserpine-pretreatment or tetrodotoxin did not modify the PIE of MCI-154. MCI-154 increased the cyclic AMP levels only at 3 X 10(-4) M, whereas CI-914, of which chemical structure is similar to that of MCI-154, elevated definitely the cyclic AMP at the lower concentrations (10(-5) to 10(-4) M). Carbachol at a concentration known to decrease markedly the PIE of amrinone, milrinone and papaverine, did not affect the PIE of MCI-154. MCI-154 inhibited the activity of a crude phosphodiesterase (PDE) from the canine ventricular muscle and it enhanced the PIE of isoproterenol, which implied the involvement of cyclic AMP. However, the maximal inhibition of PDE by MCI-154 remained less than 18%. Amrinone, milrinone and papaverine inhibited more potently the PDE activity than MCI-154. These results suggest that the elevation of cyclic AMP levels is only partially involved in the PIE of MCI-154 in the canine right ventricular muscle, and that MCI-154 may have novel mechanisms of action different from those of amrinone, milrinone and CI-914 that are largely cyclic AMP-dependent.", 
    "41": "The effects of aging and of food restriction at different times during life on rat adipocyte responses to glucagon and epinephrine were explored by studying hormone-stimulated lipolysis, hormone binding, and phosphodiesterase activity. The times of food restriction were: (a) from 6 weeks of age, (b) limited to early life, and (c) beginning in young adult life. Hormone-sensitive lipolysis is lost with age. Food restriction from 6 weeks of age prevents this loss, and food restriction started in adult life causes the recovery of this lipolysis. Hormone binding studies reveal that: (a) changes in glucagon-stimulated lipolysis parallel changes in glucagon binding; (b) glucagon binding and glucagon-stimulated lipolysis correlate inversely with cell size; (c) changes in epinephrine-stimulated lipolysis are not due to changes in beta-adrenergic binding; and (d) neither beta-adrenergic binding nor epinephrine-promoted lipolysis correlate with fat cell size. Phosphodiesterase activity is not influenced by diet, making it unlikely to be a postreceptor component lost with age.", 
    "42": "The alpha 2- and beta-adrenergic receptor activities have been investigated in human adipocytes in relation to thyroid status. Adipocytes from 11 hypothyroid and 18 hyperthyroid were compared with 19 euthyroid (normal) subjects. The lipolytic and cAMP responses to isoproterenol and epinephrine were greatly enhanced in adipocytes from hyperthyroid subjects (P less than .01) and impaired in adipocytes from hypothyroid subjects (P less than .05). However, the antilipolytic effect of clonidine (alpha 2-agonist) and the effect of clonidine on cAMP were similar in all three groups. The alpha 2- and beta-receptor numbers were both slightly increased in hyperthyroidism, but the ratio between the alpha 2- and beta-receptors was unchanged in relation to normal subjects. On the other hand, the adrenergic binding to adipocyte membranes from hypothyroid subjects was reduced, and the beta-receptor binding was reduced even much more (50%) than the alpha 2-receptor binding (20%, P less than .01). Thus, the alpha 2- and beta-receptor ratio was almost doubled in hypothyroid adipocytes (P less than .01). The antagonist affinity against the adrenergic receptors (determined by propranolol and yohimbine, respectively) was unchanged in the three groups. Agonist binding determined in intact adipocytes revealed unaltered affinity of clonidine for the alpha 2-receptor in the three groups. In hyperthyroidism, though, there was enhanced affinity of isoproterenol in competition with the beta-receptor (P less than .05). It is concluded that the inhibitory alpha 2-receptor pathway functions normally in all groups, indicating that the alpha 2-receptors and the alpha 2-receptor-mediated pathway in human adipocytes are relatively unaffected by thyroid hormones.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "43": "The present study was undertaken to determine the effects of intracoronary administration of the veratrum alkaloid veratridine on coronary blood flow and resistance in conscious, chronically instrumented intact and sinoaortic denervated dogs. Ten dogs were instrumented with a Doppler flow probe on the left anterior descending coronary artery. A chronic catheter was placed in the left circumflex coronary artery and in the aorta and left atrium. A Konigsberg pressure cell was placed in the left ventricle, and pacing leads were attached to the left atrium and ventricle. While heart rate was kept constant, bolus intracoronary injections of veratridine (0.1-0.4 microgram/kg) were administered in the unblocked state after beta 1-receptor blockade, after alpha-receptor blockade, and after cholinergic blockade. In the unblocked state, late diastolic coronary resistance fell by 34.7 +/- 5.0%. The maximum response was achieved at a time when arterial pressure was not significantly different from control. After beta 1-blockade, coronary resistance fell by 29.1 +/- 7.9%. After combined alpha- and beta-blockade, coronary resistance fell by 25.4 +/- 6.5% in response to veratridine. The addition of atropine completely blocked the decrease in coronary resistance, changing it by an average of -0.10 +/- 2.5%. The responses in sinoaortic denervated dogs were similar to those in intact animals. The response was abolished by vagotomy. We conclude that cardiac receptor stimulation causes a reflex decrease in coronary resistance in the awake dog that is completely accountable by a cholinergic mechanism.", 
    "44": "This study was designed to examine the hypothesis that epinephrine has nonuniform effects on coronary microvascular diameters. Measurements of coronary microvascular diameter were completed in anesthetized, open-chest cat preparations in which the epicardial microcirculation was viewed through an intravital microscope using stroboscopic epi-illumination. Images of coronary microvessels were digitized and analyzed on a video monitor. With arterial pressure controlled, measurements in the absence and presence of beta-adrenergic blockade (propranolol 1 mg/kg) were obtained during epinephrine infusion (1-2 micrograms/kg/min). In the absence of beta-adrenergic blockade, epinephrine produced a 25% increase in myocardial perfusion. Under these conditions, coronary vasodilation was observed in all classes of coronary arterial and arteriolar vessels. In the presence of beta-adrenergic blockade, epinephrine produced a significant decrease in myocardial perfusion (-20%). Nonuniform effects on diameter were observed in arterial and venous segments of the coronary circulation. These data are consistent with the view that in the absence of beta-adrenergic blockade, the functional coronary hyperemia associated with epinephrine administration is produced by uniform coronary arterial and arteriolar dilation. In the presence of beta-adrenergic blockade, with metabolic effects controlled, epinephrine produced a decrease in myocardial perfusion, which is related to a nonuniform decrease in coronary microvascular diameters. Such heterogeneous effects on microvascular diameters result in a redistribution of coronary microvascular resistance.", 
    "45": "The relation between the induction of phosphatidylinositol labelling and ureagenesis by epinephrine (alpha 1-adrenergic action), vasopressin, and angiotensin II was studied in liver cells. It was observed that the alpha 1-adrenergic activation consistently induced a greater stimulation of ureagenesis than the vasopressor peptides. In contrast, vasopressin stimulated phosphatidylinositol labelling to a much greater extent than epinephrine or angiotension II. We suggest that in addition to phosphoinositide turnover, alpha 1-adrenergic action involves other factor(s) in its mechanism of signal transduction.", 
    "46": "Receptor-stimulated phosphatidylinositol turnover has been studied in isolated, perfused, [3H]inositol-labelled rat hearts by measuring accumulation of inositol phosphates in the presence of lithium chloride. Inositol phosphate accumulation was stimulated by norepinephrine (3 X 10(-5) M) and carbachol (10(-3) M), the increases averaging from 931 +/- 59 (n = 6, mean +/- SEM, cpm/g heart) to 4,165 +/- 609 (n = 6, p less than 0.01) for norepinephrine and to 1,853 +/- 354 (n = 6, p less than 0.05) for carbachol. The norepinephrine stimulation was antagonized by prazosin (10(-7) M) but not by propranolol (10(-7) M), indicating mediation via alpha 1-adrenoceptors. The carbachol stimulation was antagonized by atropine (10(-7) M). The stimulation by norepinephrine was significantly higher in right atria (837 +/- 151 to 6,614 +/- 1,210, n = 6, cpm/g tissue) than in other regions of the heart. Both norepinephrine and carbachol stimulated the formation of inositol monophosphate, inositol bisphosphate, and inositol trisphosphate with norepinephrine stimulation being detected as early as 15 seconds. Furthermore, the inositol trisphosphate was identified as the -1,4,5 isomer by anion exchange high-performance liquid chromatography. These data are consistent with the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate yielding inositol-(1,4,5)-trisphosphate. Inositol-(1,3,4)-trisphosphate was not detected in heart preparations, suggesting unusual metabolism of inositol-(1,4,5)-trisphosphate in heart tissue.", 
    "47": "The effects of nicardipine, a calcium channel blocking agent, injected into the cerebral ventricles, (i.c.v.), on the body temperature of unanaesthetized cats have been investigated. Nicardipine produced a biphasic effect on body temperature: a transient dose-dependent decline followed by a longlasting elevation. The fall, but not the rise, of body temperature was associated with a dose-dependent increase in respiration. Yohimbine, in small doses, but not prazosin and propranolol, when injected into the cerebral ventricles, attenuated the hypothermia evoked by i.c.v. nicardipine. However, all the antagonists, except yohimbine in large doses, depressed the hyperventilation induced by nicardipine. Calcium chloride (i.c.v.) reversed, while i.c.v. methysergide virtually had no effect on hyperthermia caused by i.c.v. nicardipine. Nicardipine virtually had no effect on body temperature of intracerebroventricular reserpine- and alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine-treated cats. It appears, therefore, that nicardipine at least in part evoked hypothermia through alpha-2 adrenoceptors located presynaptically, while nicardipine-induced respiratory changes are mediated also partly via alpha-adrenoceptors having mixed alpha 1 and alpha 2 properties. The hyperthermic effect of nicardipine, on the contrary, is mainly due to an action on voltage-dependent calcium ion channels. The contribution of the hyperventilation to the hypothermic effect of nicardipine cannot be of great importance, since the hypothermia was accompanied with hypoventilation when alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents were used.", 
    "48": "The morphological and functional effects of tunicamycin were studied in rat parotid glands at the stage of the reformation of secretory granules following secretory stimulation by isoproterenol. Tunicamycin inhibited the incorporation of (3H)-mannose into the acid-insoluble fraction but had no effect on total protein synthesis as determined by the incorporation of (14C)-leucine. Thus the administration of tunicamycin in vivo inhibits the synthesis of mannose-rich glycoproteins in a manner similar to that in an in vitro system. The ultrastructure of the acinar cell showed little change following treatment with this drug, except that the number of reaccumulated secretory granules was greater than in the control. Amylase secretion stimulated by isoproterenol was inhibited in tunicamycin-treated cells, but did not decrease following treatment with N6,2'-O-dibutyryladenosine 3'-5'-cyclic monophosphate, a secretory stimulator bypassing the beta-receptor. A radio-receptor assay using (3H)-dihydroalprenolol and direct localization using the fluorescent beta-adrenergic blocker 9-amino-acridin-propranolol showed a marked reduction in the binding activity of beta-receptor following treatment with tunicamycin. Thus the inhibition of N-linked glycosylation appears to produce profound effects on the beta-adrenergic receptor-adenylate cyclase complex of acinar cells, although the steps of the transport and the exocytotic discharge of secretory materials are not affected.", 
    "49": "To test whether a new formulation of a slow release oxprenolol (SLOx) can produce a steady 24-h antihypertensive effect, we recorded 24-h intraarterial blood pressure (Oxford technique) in eight ambulant inpatients (age 44.5 +/- 3.0 years, mean +/- SE) with a mild or moderate hypertension who were untreated since three weeks. The study was started seven days after hospitalization and was conducted according to a randomized doubleblind cross-over design. Blood pressure recordings were made after (a) a 7-day administration of SLOx in a single evening dose, and (b) a 7-day administration of placebo. This design allowed to determine the effect of SLOx without interference from nonspecific blood pressure lowering factors. Blood pressure effects of handgrip, submaximal cyclette exercise, and cold pressor test 20-24 h after the administration of SLOx and placebo were also evaluated. The blood pressure tracing was analyzed beat-to-beat by a computer which provided also the analysis of the heart rate data. The 24-h mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure measured during placebo were 144.6 +/- 6.4 and 81.1 +/- 3.9 mm Hg, the corresponding heart rate being 76.9 +/- 3.5 beats/min. SLOx reduced these values by 6.2, 10.6, and 4.8%, respectively, all effects being similarly evident throughout the blood pressure recording. The pressor responses to handgrip, cyclette exercise, and cold pressor test were not affected by SLOx. By contrast, the small tachycardic response to handgrip and the large tachycardic response to submaximal cyclette exercise were significantly reduced by the drug.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

We studied the in vivo effects of intra-arterial celiprolol (1-100 micrograms/min i.a.) on forearm blood flow (FBF). Forearm blood was measured by venous occlusion plethysmography. Possible vasorelaxant actions of celiprolol on human vascular smooth muscle were studied using segments of isolated human saphenous vein in vitro. The effect of celiprolol was investigated on resting tone or noradrenaline induced tone. Possible alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist effects of celiprolol were assessed using celiprolol as an antagonist of BHT933 induced constriction. Celiprolol was without significant effect on FBF and failed to relax isolated saphenous vein segments preconstricted with noradrenaline. The weak alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist action of celiprolol was demonstrable in human saphenous vein. This study does not provide evidence for a direct vasodilatory effect of celiprolol on human vasculature.", 
    "51": "Several studies indicate that myocardial ischemia causes a redistribution of beta-adrenergic receptors from a presumably intracellular compartment to the cell surface. However, a decreased adenylate cyclase and contractile responsiveness to beta-adrenergic stimuli has also been reported. The aim of the present study was to investigate possible ischemia-induced changes in myocardial beta-adrenoceptor coupling to adenylate cyclase. Myocardial ischemia was induced by hydraulic occlusion of the LAD in mongrel dogs anesthetized with isoflurane. After 90 min of ischemia, tissue samples were removed from the ischemic and nonischemic regions for tissue catecholamine determinations and for the preparation of particulate fractions from tissue homogenates. Saturation experiments on microsomal fractions obtained from the ischemic and control areas did not reveal any significant changes in the calculated dissociation constant for (-)[125I]iodocyanopindolol binding nor in the calculated receptor density. Likewise, the relative numbers of beta 2-adrenergic receptors were comparable in both preparations (approximately 20%). On the other hand, the proportion of beta-adrenoceptors stabilized in the high-affinity state by (-)isoproterenol was significantly reduced in the ischemic region when compared with the control myocardium (17 +/- 5 vs. 41 +/- 4%). This change was accompanied by a significant decrease in the intrinsic activity of (-)isoproterenol in stimulating adenylate cyclase activity. We propose that the initial uncoupling of the beta-adrenoceptor from its effector is a physiologically important, protective mechanism which guards the ischemic myocardium against the deleterious effect of excessive sympathetic stimulation.", 
    "52": "The effects of a number of interventions influencing sympathetic nervous activity on the severity of coronary artery reperfusion-induced arrhythmias in anaesthetised rats have been examined. Noradrenaline (0.1 microgram kg-1 min-1) reduced the mortality that usually occurred as a consequence of ventricular fibrillation. Isoprenaline (5 micrograms kg-1) did not significantly affect the severity of reperfusion-induced arrhythmias, although arrhythmias occurring during the 5-min period of ischaemia were exacerbated. The alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist nicergoline (0.25 and 0.5 mg kg-1 min-1) markedly suppressed both the ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation occurring upon release of the occlusion, whereas prazosin (1.0 mg kg-1) only slightly reduced the incidence of ventricular tachycardia. The beta-adrenoceptor antagonists atenolol and timolol did not significantly modify the severity of these reperfusion-induced arrhythmias. Pretreatment with reserpine (0.1 mg kg-1) or 6-hydroxydopamine (20 mg kg-1), which depleted myocardial catecholamine concentrations by 90%, had no effect on the indices of arrhythmic activity. Similarly, administration of L-thyroxine (1 mg kg-1) or propylthiouracil (50 mg kg-1) on 7 consecutive days prior to coronary artery occlusion did not alter the incidence of arrhythmias occurring upon reperfusion. Taken as a whole, these results do not suggest an important role for sympathetic nervous activity in the genesis of reperfusion-induced arrhythmias in anaesthetised rats.", 
    "53": "After a 2-week placebo period, 30 men, aged 60 years (mean), with mild or moderate hypertension were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: pindolol, 10 mg b.i.d.; epanolol, 200 mg b.i.d.; and epanolol, 400 mg q.d. At the end of the placebo period and of 4 weeks of active treatment, heart rate, blood pressure, plasma renin activity (PRA), and nonepinephrine (NE) concentration of subgroups of subjects, were measured during isoproterenol infusion (30 ng/kg.min-1 for 15 min) and submaximal ergometric exercise (89 W, mean). Sitting heart rates were reduced with 200 mg b.i.d. epanolol (p less than 0.01) but unchanged with pindolol and 400 mg q.d. epanolol. Reductions of systolic and diastolic blood pressures occurred in all treatment groups but were most pronounced with pindolol. Isoproterenol-induced cardioacceleration and rise in PRA and plasma NE concentration were abolished by pindolol but only attenuated by epanolol. Pindolol also abolished the isoproterenol-induced reduction in diastolic blood pressure; epanolol had no effect on it. The hemodynamic and hormonal responses to exercise were attenuated by pindolol and epanolol in proportion to their beta-blocking activities. In the doses used, epanolol had moderate beta 1-selective blocking action. The intrinsic sympathomimetic activity of epanolol is dose dependent.", 
    "54": "The effects of 5-hydroxypropafenone (5-OH-P), the main metabolite of propafenone, were studied in guinea pig papillary muscles obtained from untreated animals and from animals pretreated with 5-OH-P, 3 mg/kg for 24 days. In untreated muscles perfused with 2.7 and 5.4 mM K+, 5-OH-P depressed action potential amplitude and Vmax, reduced the resting membrane potential, and prolonged the effective refractory period (ERP), but had no effect on the duration of the action potential (APD), recovery time (RT), or ERP/RT ratio. 5-OH-P also shifted the membrane responsiveness curve downward and to the left (i.e., in hyperpolarizing direction), prolonged the ERP/APD ratio, depressed the amplitude and Vmax, and shortened the duration of the slow action potentials induced by isoproterenol in K+-depolarized muscles. Pretreatment with 5-OH-P had no effect on phase 0 characteristics or resting membrane potential, but it shortened the APD, ERP, and RT and decreased the ERP/APD ratio. Further addition of 5-OH-P produced similar but more marked changes than in untreated muscles. In papillary muscles perfused with 10 mM K+, the depressant effects of 5-OH-P on phase 0 characteristics and ERP/APD ratio were potentiated. A slight lengthening of the APD was also observed. Because all these effects are similar to those previously described with propafenone, it is concluded that 5-OH-P is an active metabolite which exhibits class 1 antiarrhythmic effects and which may be responsible for some of the cardiodepressant and antiarrhythmic effects previously described for propafenone.", 
    "55": "We studied the effect of metoprolol on the incidence of reperfusion-induced ventricular fibrillation in the isolated rat heart with transient coronary artery occlusion and reperfusion. When administered prior to ischemia, metoprolol produced a dose-dependent reduction in reperfusion-induced ventricular fibrillation. Thus, with 1, 10, 30, 50, 100, and 200 mumol/L metoprolol, total ventricular fibrillation (reversible plus irreversible) was reduced from its control incidence of 100% to 91%, 83%, 58% (p less than 0.05), 25% (p less than 0.001), 25% (p less than 0.001), and 0% (p less than 0.001), respectively. Heart rate was also reduced in a dose-dependent manner from its control value of 268 +/- 6 beats/min to less than 75% at the highest concentration of metoprolol. Coronary flow was unaffected by metoprolol. Doses of metoprolol (1 and 10 mumol/L) that had no significant effect on heart rate had no antiarrhythmic effect. In additional experiments with a higher dose of metoprolol (50 mumol/L), hearts were paced to the rate of the drug-free control group and the antiarrhythmic effect of metoprolol was lost. When drug-free control hearts had their heart rate reduced to that of the metoprolol-treated hearts, a similar antiarrhythmic effect was observed. When metoprolol was administered just prior to reperfusion, no antiarrhythmic effects were observed. In further studies, we investigated the effect of the early administration of metoprolol (50 mumol/L) on the relationship between the vulnerability to reperfusion-induced arrhythmias and the duration of preceding ischemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "56": "Thirty-two patients with atrial fibrillation and normal ventricular rates who complained of dizziness or loss of consciousness underwent 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. A control group of 25 patients in atrial fibrillation but without symptoms of dizziness or loss of consciousness was likewise investigated. All patients remained in atrial fibrillation; periods of ventricular standstill (mean, 2.9; range, 1.8-8.0) were present in 31 symptomatic patients but in only three of the control patients (mean, 1.9 s; range, 1.7-2.4). Twenty-three symptomatic patients with pauses greater than or equal to 2.0 s received a demand pacemaker. Following pacing, nineteen became completely asymptomatic; four patients continued to have dizziness but three of these, who also experienced syncope, no longer did so (mean follow-up, 13 months; range, 6-30). It is suggested that ventricular standstill may commonly occur in patients with controlled atrial fibrillation who complain of dizziness or syncope and that the majority will benefit from permanent cardiac pacing.", 
    "57": "Two isomers of hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) have profound effects on the acquisition of kindled seizures. The gamma-isomer (lindane, gamma-HCH) increases the rate of acquisition in a dose-related manner whereas the beta-isomer (beta-HCH) has the opposite effect, retarding the rate in a dose-related manner. There is evidence that adrenergic influences may play a role in seizure generalization and in this study we examined the effect of these two isomers of HCH on the binding of a ligand to beta-adrenoceptors. Tritiated dihydroalprenolol was used as the ligand in an assay using cortical tissue from rats after 10 days of treatment with 10 mg/kg, p.o. of isomers or corn oil. Results showed a statistically significant decrease in the number of beta-adrenoceptors in cortical tissue taken from gamma-HCH-treated rats. In contrast, there was a statistically significant increase in the number of beta-adrenoceptors cortical tissue taken from beta-HCH-treated rats. Neither treatment produced a significant change in KD. We concluded that the beta-adrenoceptor system in rat cortex is differentially affected by the isomers of HCH. Because the kindling model of epilepsy is sensitive to modulations in adrenergic function, this system may be involved in the pro- and anticonvulsant effects of these HCH isomers on kindling acquisition.", 
    "58": "The central representation of neurogenically mediated coronary vasoconstriction produced by activation of the sympathetic nervous system was examined in anesthetized cats instrumented for continuous recording of coronary and femoral blood flows, arterial pressure, and heart rate. Electrical stimulation in a small region of perifornical lateral hypothalamus increased arterial pressure, heart rate, and coronary blood flow; following the administration of propranolol, a transient coronary vasoconstrictor response was unmasked. The response was mediated over the sympathetic nervous system since it was blocked by stellate ganglionectomy and by the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor antagonist prazosin. Projections to and from the lateral hypothalamic site were identified by using anterograde and retrograde pathway-tracing techniques. Paraventricular nucleus projected to lateral hypothalamus, which in turn made connections in periaqueductal gray with projections terminating in lateral reticular formation of medulla. Coronary vasoconstrictor responses qualitatively identical to those produced by hypothalamic stimulation were found with activation of paraventricular nucleus and lateral reticular formation. Interruption of neuronal transmission in the medullary site blocked the response produced by activation of hypothalamic site. These data demonstrate that coronary vasoconstriction mediated over the sympathetic nervous system can be elicited from an interconnected pathway that links sympathoexcitatory sites in forebrain and brainstem.", 
    "59": "The effect of the divalent cation ionophore A23187 and the calcium channel-blocker verapamil on bile acid synthesis in isolated hepatocytes in the presence and absence of dibutyryl cyclic AMP was studied. Both A23187 (1 microM) and verapamil (0.04 mM) caused a small (approximately 15-20%) but consistent decrease in total bile acid synthesis in the cells. When hepatocytes were incubated with dibutyryl cyclic AMP (1 mM) production of total bile acid was increased by about 25%, and this effect was unchanged by A23187 but abolished by verapamil. The relative proportions of the individual bile acids produced were not affected by either A23187 or verapamil. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP (1 mM) lowered the ratio of the amount of conjugated cholic acid to conjugated chenodeoxycholic + beta-muricholic acid formed in the cells by about 50%. Neither A23187 nor verapamil was able to prevent this change. These results suggest that the stimulatory effect of dibutyryl cyclic AMP on total bile acid synthesis is dependent on mobilisation of calcium from intracellular stores, but its effect on the relative proportions of bile acid formed via the cholic acid versus the chenodeoxycholic acid pathway is independent of calcium movement.", 
    "60": "A liquid chromatographic method using a solid-phase extraction procedure for the quantification of sotalol in plasma and urine is described. Sotalol is eluted from an extraction column with ethyl acetate-acetonitrile (1:2) and, after separation by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography on a mu Bondapak C18 column, is quantified by fluorescence detection at excitation and emission wavelengths of 240 and 310 nm, respectively. The method has been demonstrated to be linear over the concentration ranges 10-6000 ng/ml in plasma and 0.5-100 micrograms/ml in urine. Mean inter-assay accuracy of the method for plasma ranged from 93 to 100% and for urine from 102 to 114%; precision ranged from 0.5 to 1.6% for plasma over a concentration range of 200-4000 ng/ml and for urine from 0.7 to 2.0% at concentrations of 2-50 micrograms/ml. Mass spectrometry confirmed the presence of sotalol in isolated chromatographic fractions of plasma and urine extracts from subjects given sotalol orally.", 
    "61": "Clinical, pharmacologic and biochemical evidence characterizes essential hypertension as a heterogeneous spectrum of pathophysiologic substances rather than the single entity it has long been presumed to be. Although the causes of essential hypertension remain obscure, 2 different mechanisms for long-term vasoconstriction that sustain diastolic hypertension in the experimental and clinical forms of primary aldosteronism and renovascular hypertension can also be identified and quantified among patients with essential hypertension. The first mechanism is renin independent, requires antecedent sodium retention and appears related to abnormal membrane transport of calcium. This vasoconstriction is identified by low plasma renin and ionized calcium and is correctable by sodium depletion or calcium channel or alpha blockade. The second vasoconstrictor mechanism is renin mediated and involves an increase in cytosolic calcium. This mechanism is quantifiable by the plasma renin level or the hypotensive response to an antirenin-system drug (converting enzyme inhibitor, beta blocker or saralasin). Depending on the state of sodium balance, these 2 mechanisms contribute reciprocally to maintenance of arteriolar tone in experimental models, in both normal and hypertensive people, and in patients with congestive heart failure. In these situations, at the extremes of the range of plasma renin values, one or the other mechanism predominates, whereas in the medium range of renin values both mechanisms can be operative. These interrelations provide a basis for applying more precisely tailored therapy and for stratifying patients pathophysiologically for further study.", 
    "62": "Blood platelet function was evaluated in 10 men, all 50 years old, with untreated, mild hypertension. Each patient was examined four times: At the beginning of the study, after 5 weeks on placebo treatment, after the following 5 weeks on propranolol 160 mg daily, and finally after a second period of 5 weeks on placebo. At baseline the plasma level of the platelet release product beta-thromboglobulin (BTG) was 41.6 (30.5-57.0) micrograms/l (median and 95% confidence interval). During the first placebo period BTG was normalized to 21.0 (14.1-25.9) micrograms/l. While systolic blood pressure and heart rate fell during beta-adrenergic receptor blockade, BTG remained unchanged throughout the rest of the observation periods. Platelet size increased significantly during treatment with beta-blocker. The present study indicates that the normalization of elevated platelet function which previously has been reported to occur during anti-hypertensive drug therapy, may be explained by patient adaptation to the blood sampling procedure.", 
    "63": "Liquid diets are commonly used as vehicles for chronic administration of ethanol to rodents. After mice had consumed an ethanol-free liquid diet for either seven or eight days, the number of cardiac beta-adrenoceptors and the maximum response of adenylate cyclase to isoproterenol were decreased. This change was associated with a decrease in the number of high-affinity agonist binding sites. When mice were fed ethanol in the liquid diet, there was a further decrease in the number of cardiac low-affinity agonist (isoproterenol) binding sites, but no further change in the biochemical response to isoproterenol. The data suggest that stress and/or nutritional factors can alter the number, the coupling and the function of cardiac beta-adrenoceptors and that chronic ethanol ingestion enhances certain aspects of these changes.", 
    "64": "Sleep disturbances are frequently associated with the use of antihypertensive drugs. They are observed mainly during the administration of drugs that affect central adrenergic mechanisms. Beta-adrenoceptor antagonists which readily penetrate into the brain (propranolol, pindolol) increase wakefulness and/or decrease REM sleep. Alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists (clonidine, guanfacine) markedly reduce the duration of REM sleep. The catecholamine depleting agent reserpine increases REM sleep during single or repeated-dose administration, while the MAOI phenelzine shows opposite effects. The 5-HT2 antagonist ritanserin, which is chemically related to the antihypertensive agent ketanserin, increases slow wave sleep while REM sleep is decreased. Sleep disturbances have not been reported during the administration of calcium entry antagonists. However, they seem to modify the effects of hypnotics and CNS stimulants. There are no formal studies on the effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and vasodilators on sleep in man.", 
    "65": "The relaxant effect of capsaicin was investigated on isolated segments of guinea pig ileum precontracted by histamine. Two types of relaxation could be distinguished. Low concentrations of capsaicin (0.033-3.3 microM) caused partial relaxation (type I) which was prevented by in vitro desensitization to capsaicin or by extrinsic denervation and reduced by tachyphylaxis to calcitonin gene-related peptide. At higher concentrations (10-100 microM) capsaicin caused relaxation (type II) to the baseline; this effect was insensitive to capsaicin desensitization or extrinsic denervation. Neither type of relaxation was inhibited by tetrodotoxin or by alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. We suggest that type I relaxation results from a specific effect of capsaicin on extrinsic sensory neurones of the gut while type II represents a non-specific smooth muscle depressant effect. Intrinsic enteric neurones are not involved in these effects.", 
    "66": "In the investigation of new antiarrhythmic drugs, comparative trials with clinically available antiarrhythmic agents provide a perspective from which to judge the new investigational agent. Two clinical investigations of moricizine HCl, each using a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover design, are summarized. In the first study, 18 patients with greater than or equal to 30 ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) per hour (mean 369 +/- 95) were given propranolol (120 mg daily) compared with moricizine HCl (816 +/- 103 mg daily). Propranolol suppressed 38% of VPCs in the study group, moricizine HCl, 81% of VPCs, and the combination of both drugs, 87%. Moricizine HCl was more effective than propranolol in suppressing VPCs at all individual levels greater than 70% (p less than 0.05, McNemar's test). The combination of moricizine HCl and propranolol was well tolerated. The second investigation used a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover design to compare the efficacy of disopyramide (600 mg daily) and moricizine HCl (800 mg daily) in 27 patients. Patients had greater than or equal to 40 VPCs/hr on a 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram. During moricizine HCl administration, the mean VPC frequency decreased from 524 to 151 VPCs/hr (71.2% reduction). In contrast, disopyramide reduced VPC frequency from 535 to 253 VPCs/hr (52.8% reduction) and demonstrated significantly greater side effects (p less than 0.05). Moricizine HCl was more effective than disopyramide in suppressing VPCs at all individual percent reduction levels greater than 70% (p less than 0.05, McNemar's test). Moricizine HCl was more effective in suppressing VPCs than either disopyramide or propranolol, with significantly fewer side effects.", 
    "67": "The effect of uranyl nitrate-induced acute renal failure on the brain uptake of DL-propranolol was investigated in rats with a series of tissue-sampling single-carotid injection techniques. When the buffer solution was used as an injection solution, the brain uptake index (BUI), the extraction ratio (ET), and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability-surface area product (PSapp) and PSu (corrected PSapp for the unbound fraction) in uremic rats were significantly lower than those in control rats. These parameters for DL-propranolol were decreased significantly in both control and uremic rats receiving injection of the uremic serum. The PSu values in both of the control and uremic rats injected with either control or uremic rat serum were significantly higher than those in rats injected with the buffer solution, suggesting the presence of a protein-mediated transport mechanism; that is, the conventional assumption that the fraction of the drug which is available for the uptake in vivo is equal to the unbound fraction as measured in vitro may not hold. In contrast, the brain extraction of D-[14C]glucose, [3H]inulin and [3H]water, which show no binding to serum protein, was not affected by the coinjection of either control or uremic rat serum. On the other hand, using either the ultrafiltrate from serum (control and uremic) or supernatant fraction from heat-treated serum (control and uremic) as the injection solution, no significant difference in the PSu value for DL-propranolol was observed between control and uremic serum. These results suggest that (1) the decrease in the PSu value for DL-propranolol in uremic rats may be attributed mainly to the presence of an endogenous inhibitory substance(s) for the brain uptake or to the decrease in the exchangeable fraction in vivo in the uremic serum; (2) the decrease in the PSu value for DL-propranolol may also be partly attributed to the change in the BBB permeability and/or surface area; (3) the inhibitor for the brain uptake may be characterized as a temperature-sensitive and nonfiltrable substance(s) at physiological pH; and (4) the ability of protein-mediated transport for DL-propranolol into brain was decreased in uremic rats.", 
    "68": "The 12-hour control of intraocular pressure obtained with 10 and 20 mg of nadolol twice daily was studied in a placebo-controlled trial. In this ten-week study involving 17 patients a significant reduction in intraocular pressure was obtained with both doses. The effect of 20 mg of nadolol twice daily on intraocular pressure, resting pulse rate, and blood pressure was consistently slightly greater than 10 mg twice daily, but the difference was not significant.", 
    "69": "1. In isolated perfused rat liver, the effects of alpha-adrenergic stimulation by phenylephrine (2 microM), such as an increase of portal pressure, glucose output, Ca2+ release into the perfusate and the characteristic K+ flux changes across the hepatocyte plasma membrane were almost completely abolished in the presence of amiloride (0.5 mM). 2. When the phenylephrine concentration was raised to about 100 microM, the effects of the alpha-adrenergic agonist on hepatic metabolism, Ca2+ and K+ fluxes, but not on the portal venous pressure, were restored, suggesting a competitive antagonism by amiloride. 3. Amiloride antagonized in a concentration-dependent manner noradrenaline-induced isometric contractions of strips of the rabbit pulmonary artery. The concentration-response curve of noradrenaline was shifted to the right, and the maximal response obtained was also depressed, suggesting a mixed competitive and non-competitive antagonism. The estimated amiloride-adrenoceptor-dissociation constant was 8 microM. 4. The affinity of amiloride to the alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor subtypes was determined by radioligand binding assays using [125I]BE 2254 binding to rat liver plasma membranes (alpha 1-subtype), [3H]yohimbine binding to human platelet membranes (alpha 2-subtype), (-)-[125I]iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) binding to rabbit lung membranes in presence of the beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118,551 (beta 1-subtype) and ICYP binding to rat lung membranes in presence of the beta 1-blocker atenolol (beta 2-subtype). In all systems, amiloride inhibited specific ligand binding concentration-dependently, the Ki values for amiloride were about 25, 52, 148 and 161 microM for alpha 1- alpha 2-, beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor subtypes, respectively. 5. It is concluded that amiloride in concentrations below those required for inhibition of the Na+/H+ exchanger is a potent antagonist of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors in a variety of experimental systems. Whether the adrenergic antagonism of amiloride is important for antihypertensive therapy, remains to be elucidated.", 
    "70": "The effects of beta 1- and beta 1 + beta 2-antagonists on the myocardial adaptation to exercise training were investigated in male Sprague-Dawley rats randomly divided into trained (treadmill, 1 hr/day, 5 days/week for 10 weeks at 27 m/min, 15% grade) without drug (TC), sedentary without drug (SC), trained treated with atenolol (TA) (10 mg/kg body wt, i.p.), trained treated with propranolol (TP, 30 mg/kg body wt, i.p.), and sedentary propranolol. Doses of both beta-antagonists were titrated to decrease the exercise heart rate by 25% compared to the controls. The heart weight and heart/body weight ratio were significantly greater in TC (1.28 +/- 0.07 g (P less than 0.01); 296 +/- 12 mg/100 g body wt (P less than 0.05) respectively) than in SC (1.09 +/- 0.04 g and 268 +/- 11 mg/100 g body wt), or in TP and TA. Myocardial mitochondrial protein was unchanged by training or beta-blockade. Citrate synthase and beta-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase activities were not altered. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase activity was increased in SP compared to SC. Training increased hexokinase activity only in TC (5.22 +/- 0.12 vs 4.26 +/- 0.23 mumol/min/g wet wt, P less than 0.01). Lactate dehydrogenase activity increased significantly (P less than 0.01) in both TC (383 +/- 14 mumol/min/g wet wt) and TA (372 +/- 14 mumol/min/g wet wt) compared to SC (276 +/- 14 mumol/min/g wet wt), but not in TP versus SP. These data indicate that (1) beta-adrenergic blockade prevents training-induced cardiac hypertrophy; (2) beta-antagonists have little effect on the myocardial oxidative capacity; and (3) while the training induction of myocardial hexokinase is inhibited by both beta 1- and beta 1 + beta 2-antagonists, myocardium may increase its ability to utilize lactate during exercise with training despite beta 1-blockade.", 
    "71": "The regulation of PGE2 (prostaglandin E2) and PGI2 (prostaglandin I2; prostacyclin) formation was investigated in isolated adipocytes. The formation of both PGs was stimulated by various lipolytic agents such as isoproterenol, adrenaline and dibutyryl cyclic AMP. During maximal stimulation the production of PGE2 and PGI2 (measured as 6-oxo-PGF1 alpha) was 0.51 +/- 0.04 and 1.21 +/- 0.09 ng/2 h per 10(6) cells respectively. Thus PGI2 was produced in excess of PGE2 in rat adipocytes. The production of the PGs was inhibited by indomethacin and acetylsalicylic acid in a concentration-dependent manner. The half-maximal effective concentration of indomethacin was 328 +/- 38 nM and that of acetylsalicylic acid was 38.5 +/- 5.3 microM. The PGs were maximally inhibited by 70-75% after incubation for 2 h. In contrast with their effect on PG production, the two agents had a small potentiating effect on the stimulated lipolysis (P less than 0.05). The phospholipase inhibitors mepacrine and chloroquine inhibited both PG production and triacylglycerol lipolysis and were therefore unable to indicate whether the PG precursor, arachidonic acid, originates from phospholipids or triacylglycerols in adipocytes. Angiotensin II significantly (P less than 0.05) stimulated both PGE2 and PGI2 production in rat adipocytes without affecting triacylglycerol lipolysis. Finally, it was shown that PGE2 and PGI2 were also produced in human adipocytes, although in smaller quantities than in rat adipocytes. It is concluded that the production of PGs in isolated adipocytes is regulated by various hormones. Moreover, at least two separate mechanisms for PG production may exist in adipocytes: (1) a mechanism that is activated concomitantly with triacylglycerol lipolysis (and cyclic AMP) and (2) an angiotensin II-sensitive, but lipolysis (and cyclic AMP)-independent mechanism.", 
    "72": "The effect of norepinephrine on fatty acid synthesis (3H2O incorporation into fatty acids), on fatty acid oxidation to CO2 and on ketogenesis was studied in isolated hepatocytes of fed rats. After incubation with norepinephrine (50 microM), lipogenesis was lower (5.7 +/- 1.1 nmoles 3H2O incorporated into fatty acids/mg dry weight/30 min) than in controls (7.5 +/- 1.7; n = 6, p less than 0.02). In contrast, (1-14C) palmitate conversion into total ketone bodies was increased to 10.9 +/- 1.8 nmoles/mg/30 min with norepinephrine, vs 8.5 +/- 1.6 in controls (p less than 0.05), and more (1-14C) palmitate was converted to 14CO2 with norepinephrine than in controls (1.48 +/- 0.10 nmoles/mg/30 min vs 1.06 +/- 0.11, p less than 0.05). The inhibitory effect of norepinephrine on lipogenesis was abolished by addition of the alpha 1-receptor blocker prazosin, but not by alpha 2 or beta-blockers. The results demonstrate that the ketogenic effect of norepinephrine is coupled with an inhibitory effect on lipogenesis which may be explained by diminished activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, diminished formation of malonyl-CoA and decreased activity of carnitine palmitoyl transferase I.", 
    "73": "This study was undertaken to compare the characteristics of beta-adrenoceptors in bovine airway epithelium and smooth muscle cells. [3H]Dihydroalprenolol (DHA) was used as the radioligand. There was a significant difference in both the affinity and the density of the specific [3H]DHA binding in both the membranes. The maximum number of binding sites was about two fold higher and the affinity about six fold greater in the epithelial membranes as compared to those in the smooth muscle membranes. Because the integrity of airway epithelium is very important for pulmonary function and airway epithelium is very rich in beta-adrenoceptors, it is possible that the beneficial effects of beta-adrenoceptor agonists in asthma and other airway diseases could, at least in part, be due to their action on epithelium.", 
    "74": "The haemodynamic effects of piretanide, acebutolol and nifedipine were tested and compared at rest and on exercise in an open study of patients with essential hypertension, grade II (WHO). All three drugs lowered the blood pressure significantly, both at rest and on exercise. There was no significant difference between the three drugs in their effect on resting blood pressure, but nifedipine and acebutolol were significantly more effective than piretanide in lowering it on exercise. Piretanide lowered the blood pressure by reduction in cardiac output and peripheral resistance, nifedipine entirely through a reduction of peripheral resistance, and acebutolol entirely through a reduction in cardiac output. Mean pulmonary arterial pressure, taken as a measure of left-ventricular filling pressure, was significantly reduced by piretanide and nifedipine, while it rose significantly under acebutolol. Taking into account the haemodynamics of essential hypertension (raised peripheral resistance, decreased cardiac output, frequently increased left-ventricular filling pressure), nifedipine most nearly fulfilled the role of an \"ideal\" antihypertensive agent.", 
    "75": "As hydrophobic interactions are involved in both reversed-phase liquid chromatography and plasma protein binding, the relationship between retention time and binding was investigated experimentally in two series of compounds. For betaxolol and its O-alkyl analogues, the nature of the O-alkyl group strongly influences the retention time on a Spherisorb CN 5-microns column. With 0.03 M acetate buffer (pH 5.6)-acetonitrile (60:40) as the mobile phase, k' values increase from 1.8 to 8.3 with a concomitant increase in plasma protein binding from 0.5% (R = H) to 88.2% (R = cyclopentylmethyl). The relationship between the free fraction and log k' is sigmoidal. In the second example, structural changes in the propyl side-chain of alpidem (a new anxiolytic) lead to minor variations in the protein binding: 98.9 to 84.9%. This slight decrease with the more polar metabolite is correlated with a sharp decrease in the k' values from 14.7 to 0.94 on a Supelcosil LC 18 DB column. Based on retention times, it should be feasible to predict qualitatively, if not quantitatively in some instances, plasma protein binding in a series of structurally similar compounds.", 
    "76": "The studies reported here demonstrate that opioid antagonism enhances memory in two classes of animals viz. Aves and Mammalia. In mice, immediate posttraining administration of naloxone produces a time-dependent improvement in retention tested one week later. This effect is stereospecific. As naloxone was approximately 1000-fold more potent when administered intracerebroventricularly compared to subcutaneously, it appears that it produces its effect within the central nervous system. Pretest administration of naloxone, at a dose that failed to alter acquisition, also improved test performance, suggesting that naloxone also improved recall. Similar improvement in retention was demonstrated with the more potent opioid antagonist, nalmefene, at a 500-fold lower dose. The dose response to naloxone in both the mouse and the chick and to nalmefene in the mouse had the characteristics of an inverted U, with high doses either being ineffective or suppressing memory retention. In mice, naloxone demonstrated anti-amnestic properties against both anisomycin, a protein synthesis inhibitor, and scopolamine, an acetylcholine receptor blocker. Administration of beta-funaltrexamine (B-FNA) 72 h prior to training did not alter acquisition but did enhance retention. In studies where the mu-opioid receptor was blocked with B-FNA, naloxone was unable to enhance retention. B-FNA failed to impair the memory enhancing properties of arecoline, fluoxetine or clonidine. This demonstrates specificity of the B-FNA ability to prevent naloxone from enhancing memory and suggests that the opioid antagonist effects on memory are mediated by the mu-receptor.", 
    "77": "The effect of beta-adrenoceptor blockade and activation on ischemic regional and microregional myocardial O2 supply/consumption parameters was assessed in 28 open chest, anesthetized dogs. Ten minutes after LAD occlusion, dogs were given i.v. saline, 2 mg/kg propranolol, 0.2 mg/kg pindolol, or 1 microgram/kg per min isoproterenol. Coronary blood flow was determined using radioactive microspheres before and 2 h after LAD occlusion while O2 supply/consumption parameters were determined using microspectrophotometry. Ischemia resulted in a 66% reduction in subendocardial flow in controls in the ischemic zone and no experimental treatment significantly altered this flow. Pindolol resulted in a significant improvement in the ischemic regional subendocardial/subepicardial flow ratio (from 0.69 in the control ischemic region to 0.88 during pindolol treatment). O2 extractions were significantly increased and O2 consumptions were significantly depressed in the ischemic regions of all groups. O2 extractions were increased to a lesser degree in the ischemic region with the use of pindolol and propranolol. Propranolol and pindolol both significantly decreased the proportion of veins with low (0-20%) O2 saturations in the ischemic region indicating an improved microregional distribution of blood flow and/or O2 consumption within the ischemic region.", 
    "78": "The contribution of an alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated component to the final inotropic response to noradrenaline in the absence and presence of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor stimulation (which exerts a 'functional' antagonism of effects mediated through beta-adrenoceptors but not through alpha-adrenoceptors) was evaluated by recording contraction and relaxation in isolated, paced rat papillary muscles. In the absence of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor stimulation, the alpha 1-selective adrenoceptor blocker prazosin (0.12 microM) did not significantly influence the dose-dependent response to noradrenaline with respect to either contractility or to relaxation. In the presence of concomitant muscarinic acetylcholine receptor stimulation by 10 microM carbachol, prazosin reduced by 32% (alpha = 0.028) the maximal increase in contractility (expressed as (dT/dt)max) evoked by noradrenaline compared to the absence of prazosin. Prazosin also did not influence the effect of noradrenaline upon relaxation under these conditions. Carbachol itself did not significantly reduce the maximal contractile response to noradrenaline. Thus cholinergic stimulation increases both relatively and absolutely the alpha-adrenergic inotropic component of noradrenaline. These observations indicate a ternary regulatory system of myocardial contractility through the autonomic receptors.", 
    "79": "Stages in the return of the toe-spreading reflex after sciatic nerve injury were examined using the rat. It was found that the earliest stages in the return of the reflex do not indicate nerve regeneration, but rather reflect the development of adrenalin sensitivity in denervated muscles. Probably systemic adrenalin released during the reflex-testing procedure causes muscle contractions which imitate a nerve-induced toe-spread reflex.", 
    "80": "In a rat model of chronic portal hypertension we studied ethanol-induced gastric mucosal damage and the effects of pretreatment by propranolol and sucralfate. Susceptibility to ethanol was increased in chronic portal hypertensive rats compared with sham-operated rats (55 +/- 8% vs. 25 +/- 4%). Both acute pretreatment (10 min) and chronic pretreatment (3 weeks) with propranolol reduced gastric mucosal injury induced by ethanol in portal hypertensive rats, compared with saline-treated rats. Acute and chronic pretreatment with propranolol had no protective effect in sham-operated rats. In portal hypertensive rats, sucralfate in two different doses (500 and 125 mg/kg) protected the gastric mucosa against ethanol-induced gastric injury compared with animals receiving saline (2 +/- 1% and 3 +/- 2% vs. 25 +/- 3%). Sucralfate at the higher dose did not reduce portal pressure in portal hypertensive rats. We conclude that: (1) chronic portal hypertension increases ethanol-induced gastric damage; (2) acute and chronic propranolol treatment reduces ethanol-induced gastric injury in portal hypertensive rats, probably by decreasing portal hypertension; (3) sucralfate has a cytoprotective effect in portal hypertensive rats without reducing portal pressure. These results suggest a potential application of sucralfate in patients otherwise treated by sclerotherapy.", 
    "81": "In order to elucidate the effect of beta-adrenergic blockade on liver metabolism and haemodynamics, splanchnic oxygen uptake, hepatic removal of indocyanine green (ICG) and splanchnic and systemic haemodynamics were studied in 13 patients with cirrhosis before and 1.5-2 h after an oral dose of 80 mg propranolol. All patients underwent hepatic vein catheterization and had a primed continuous intravenous infusion of ICG. Azygos vein catheterization was performed in six patients. Splanchnic (hepatic-intestinal) oxygen uptake (median control 68 ml/min vs. beta-blockade 56 ml/min, P less than 0.01), azygos venous oxygen saturation (76 vs. 67%, P less than 0.05), ICG clearance (263 vs. 226 ml/min, P less than 0.01), wedged-to-free hepatic vein pressure (16 vs. 13.5 mm Hg, P less than 0.01), hepatic blood flow (1.18 vs. 0.78 l/min, P less than 0.01), cardiac index (3.42 vs. 2.53 l/min . min 2, P less than 0.01), and heart rate (72 vs. 56 beats per min, P less than 0.01) decreased significantly after oral beta-blockade. The hepatic extraction ratio of ICG increased significantly (0.32 vs. 0.45, P less than 0.01), whereas estimated 'intrinsic' ICG clearance (289 vs. 300 ml/min, n.s.), arterial blood pressure, stroke volume, and systemic vascular resistance remained essentially unchanged. The results indicate that besides the well-known cardiovascular effects of propranolol, beta-adrenergic blockade may also reduce hepatic metabolic functions as evidenced by the significantly decreased splanchnic oxygen uptake. The raised hepatic extraction ratio of ICG may be caused by reduction in hepatic blood flow as well as in intrahepatic shunting."
