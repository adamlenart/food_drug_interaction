Twelve male patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension (blood pressure, 160/95 +/- 15/7 mm Hg; age range, 32 to 60 years) completed a randomized, double-blind, crossover study. Both drugs were well tolerated and, after 4 weeks of monotherapy, were associated with significant reductions in supine and erect BP. Hemodynamic responses to mental arithmetic were similar for both drugs, and neither agent affected mental performance as judged by psychomotor testing. The increase in heart rate during bicycle exercise was significantly greater with rilmenidine (50 vs. 41 beats/min, p = 0.04), and during the postexercise recovery phase, areas under the curve for diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were smaller after atenolol than after rilmenidine: 46,450 versus 51,400 mm Hg.s (p = 0.02) and 49,445 versus 63,597 beats/min.s (p = 0.001), respectively. In conclusion, rilmenidine and atenolol exert comparable antihypertensive effects both at rest and during mental and dynamic exercise. Although atenolol blunted the heart rate responses to dynamic exercise and the Valsalva maneuver, rilmenidine showed no interference with physiological hemodynamic responses of blood pressure and heart rate during tests of sympathetic and parasympathetic function.", 
    "1": "Platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) triggered signal transduction was investigated in human foreskin fibroblasts with endogenous PDGF beta-receptors, and porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) cells with stably transfected PDGF beta-receptors. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting showed that PDGF induced dose-dependent autophosphorylation of PDGF beta-receptor, and the PLC-gamma associates with autophosphorylated PDGF beta-receptors and becomes phosphorylated. Activation of PLC-gamma is known to induce fluctuations of the concentration of cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca2+]i). Microfluorometry and digital imaging were employed for measurements of the concentration of [Ca2+]i. In both cell types the growth factor induced four types of [Ca2+]i responses; no rise, a small and sluggish monophasic rise, a biphasic rise with an initial transient peak followed by a sustain elevation, and finally regular oscillations. The frequencies and amplitudes of the oscillatory responses were independent of agonist concentration after stimulation with PDGF-BB. Latency, the period from application of stimulus to the first [Ca2+]i peak, was reduced at higher concentrations of agonist. Also, the proportion of responding cells increased with higher concentrations of ligand. Oscillations of [Ca2+]i were elicited at submaximal concentrations of agonist. In PAE cells PDGF-BB triggered a single [Ca2+]i peak in absence of external Ca2+. Ligand-induced oscillations and sustained increases of [Ca2+]i were counteracted by the inorganic Ca2+ channel blocker Ce3+. These results show that similar types of [Ca2+]i responses occur in different cell types independently of whether the PDGF beta-receptors are expressed endogeneously or after transfection. Potentially, the different [Ca2+]i responses have distinct physiological consequences.", 
    "2": "The development of more sensitive and selective analytical techniques has greatly improved scientists' ability to study the PK, PD, and metabolism of drugs in pregnancy. This chapter has chronicled the evolution of the study of drug disposition in pregnant sheep in the laboratory. With the advent of more sensitive and selective analytical techniques, researchers have been able to progress significantly beyond measuring the extent of fetal drug exposure by a single-point determination. A number of interesting and significant advances have been made using highly selective and specific analytical techniques (i.e., gas chromatography-electron-capture detection, gas chromatography-nitrogen phosphoros-specific detection, and gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy). Researchers have characterized drug kinetics in multiple fluids from the pregnant sheep (amniotic fluid, fetal and maternal plasma and urine, and fetal tracheal fluid) and have demonstrated extensive accumulation of several basic drugs in the fluid produced by the fetal lung. With the simultaneous administration of labeled and unlabeled drug to the ewe and fetus researchers have, for the first time, examined the assumption that the clearance parameters determined from the model developed by Szeto and coworkers (1982) are not affected by the time interval between maternal and fetal infusions given on separate days. Also using SIL drug, researchers have characterized fetal hepatic first-pass drug clearance in a chronic preparation. With the establishment of a stereoselective assay for labetalol, scientists have begun to examine the fetal exposure to the individual enantiomers of racemic drugs in pregnancy. The availability of newer analytical tools and techniques (i.e., HPLC interfaced with tandem mass spectrometers) will further expand the study of drugs in pregnancy and challenge the creativity of future investigators in this field.", 
    "3": "The effectiveness of the tocolytic agent and other betamimetic drugs in the treatment of preterm labor remains controversial. Effectiveness or efficancy of ritodrine has not yet convincingly been proven. A major concern are the marked side effects of beta-mimetics. The calcium channel blocker nifedipine has been used for tocolysis shortly after its introduction in clinical practice and is considered to be a probable good alternative for ritodrine. The efficacy of nifedipine versus ritodrine in the treatment of preterm labor was assessed in a retrospective study. 32 patients received intravenous ritodrine and 29 oral nifedipine. As endpoints were used: postponement of delivery, maternal side effects and perinatal outcome. The results of this retrospective study suggest that nifedipine is more successful in postponing delivery than ritodrine. Maternal side effects seemed to occur more frequently and be more serious in patients treated with ritodrine as compared to nifedipine. Perinatal outcome seemed better in the nifedipine group than in the ritodrine group. The promising data from small prospective studies and the results of this retrospective study warrant further large prospective studies on the definitive place of nifedipine in the treatment of premature labor. Until the results of such a trial are available we advocate the use of nifedipine in case of preterm labor, especially in a patient with diabetes mellitus, ruptured membranes, cardiac disease or multiple pregnancy, in order to avoid the characteristic side effects of beta-mimetics.", 
    "4": "Conscious male Wistar SPF Riv:TOX rats were dosed intravenously with 2.5, 5, or 10 mg/kg rac-propranolol.HCl, or with 5 mg/kg of either (-)-(S)- or (+)-(R)-propranolol.HCl. Disposition of (-)-(S)- and (+)-(R)-propranolol after dosing of rac-propranolol was linear in the dose range examined. Total plasma clearance was not changed in animals dosed with the individual enantiomers compared to the animals that were dosed with rac-propranolol. However, for (-)-(S)-propranolol both volume of distribution and elimination half-life decreased, whereas for (+)-(R)-propranolol increases were observed for these characteristics, in animals dosed with the individual enantiomers. Our observations suggest that the (+)-(R)-enantiomer competes with (-)-(S)-propranolol for plasma protein binding sites, resulting in lower plasma protein binding of the (-)-(S)-enantiomer when the racemate is administered. From recent toxicological experiments, it was concluded that rac-propranolol is more toxic than the individual enantiomers in the rat, when dosed iv at the same total mass. It is concluded that the observed potentiation of toxic effects of propranolol enantiomers when administered as a racemate can at least partly be explained by a pharmacokinetic interaction.", 
    "5": "The influence of endotoxin-induced inflammation was studied on the pharmacokinetics of the enantiomers of the racemic drugs oxprenolol, propranolol, and verapamil in rabbits and dogs. Enantioselective pharmacokinetics were seen for oxprenolol and propranolol in the rabbit and for propranolol and verapamil in the dog. In the dog, the enantioselective differences in plasma concentrations are due to differences in both protein binding and metabolism, whereas in the rabbit the differences are due solely to differences in metabolism. In both species endotoxin treatment increases the plasma concentrations of the enantiomers of the three drugs; both protein binding and metabolism are influenced. In rabbits and in dogs, the influence of endotoxin on the disposition of the three drugs is less enantioselective than was previously observed in the rat.", 
    "6": "The tremor present in a small number of patients who present with features of both Parkinson's disease (PD) and essential tremor (ET) is ill-defined. We therefore studied 8 such patients with 'atypical' tremor and compared them clinically to 11 PD and 10 ET patients in a double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled trial. Tremor was assessed via accelerometry and surface EMG. Tremor frequency and the acute tremorlytic response to propranolol were not useful in discriminating between groups. Over 80% of atypical and PD patients showed alternating EMG, whereas 90% of ET patients had synchronous EMG activity. Tremor amplitude improved by > 90% in 38% of atypical, 27% of PD and none of the ET patients after single-dose L-dopa/benserazide (300/75 mg), a response which was significantly different between the ET and PD groups. Failure to differentiate electrophysiologically and pharmacologically between the atypical and other groups probably relates to clinical heterogeneity in the atypical group.", 
    "7": "Selected beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists are the antiglaucoma drugs of first choice in most cases. However, a number of significant central nervous system (CNS), cardiovascular and respiratory side-effects following topical ocular installation of beta-blockers have also been reported. Site- and stereo-specific delivery to the eye of beta-blockers was achieved by application of a sequential bioactivation of the chemical delivery system (CDS) analogs of these drugs, which are converted to the active beta-blockers only in the eye, thus systemic side effects are avoided. The corresponding ketoxime analogs of the various beta-blockers were successfully applied and one of them, Alprenoxime, was tested in humans. The main problem with these compounds, however, is formulation stability: Alprenoxime has a t90 of only 2-3 months. Thus, alternate structures were searched. Methoxime analogs of selected beta-blockers were synthesized and their chemical stability established at different pH's. Subsequently, their in vivo sequential enzymatic conversion was confirmed using HPLC. Comparative intraocular pressure (IOP) reducing activity of the methoximes were then studied using normotensive rabbits. The methoxime analogs showed significantly improved hydrolytic stability at pH approximately 7.0, the t90 is over 1 year. The in vivo sequential bioactivation, however, proceeds similarly to the oximes. The intermediate ketones and the active beta-blockers can be detected in the various eye compartments at different time intervals following topical administration of the methoximes. The mechanism of the eye-selective bioactivation and the results of the IOP reducing activity studies will be discussed.", 
    "8": "Vaninolol has been confirmed as a selective beta 1-adrenergic blocking agent. The new compound was studied for its effects on intraocular pressure (IOP), the ocular blood flow and the retinal function in this report. Vaninolol showed marked delay in IOP recovery demonstrating that the agent possessed an ocular hypotensive action. This effect is equipotent or slightly more active than L-timolol. In addition, effects of vaninolol on the ocular blood flow of ocular hypertensive eyes were determined using the colored microspheres technique. It was found that vaninolol improved the ocular blood flow in ciliary body and retina, but not in iris and choroid. Further, vaninolol is able to improve the b-wave recovery in electroretinography significantly, indicating that it is possible to develop a new agent for the treatment of ischemic retinopathy.", 
    "9": "The variations in the intracellular free calcium concentration, [Ca2+]i, have been studied in isolated acini of rat parotid gland with a fluorescent probe, fura-2. In unstimulated acini, [Ca2+]i amounted to a basal value of 180 nM. Isoproterenol used at a concentration of 200 microM, in the presence of a beta-adrenergic blocker, caused a net increase of [Ca2+]i to a mean of 90 nM above basal values. This increase was suppressed by phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic blocker. A weak increase of [Ca2+]i of 47 nM was also obtained when acini were incubated with 1 microM isoproterenol. This effect was suppressed with 0.1 microM propranolol which, at this concentration, specifically antagonizes the beta-adrenergic receptors. We conclude that isoproterenol at 1 microM, increases the [Ca2+]i by stimulating beta-adrenergic receptors. This effect is not reproduced by forskoline. Our results suggest that this isoproterenol effect on [Ca2+]i is independent of the formation of cyclic AMP. Moreover, when the isoproterenol concentration is high (200 microM), the increase of [Ca2+]i could be through an activation of alpha-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "10": "The beneficial effect of beta-blockade has been reported in acute myocardial ischemia as well as in the postinfarction period. Recent interest focused on the special effect of beta-blocking agents regarding the changes of lipid metabolism, free radical mediated reactions and arachidonic acid cascade. In previous experiments on dogs we have shown that ultrashort-acting beta-blocker (Brevibloc) could modify production of prostacyclin and thromboxane in ischemic heart tissue. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of Brevibloc on the function of isolated neutrophils and platelets during myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. In mongrel dogs the left descending coronary artery (LAD) was ligated for 1 or 2 hours followed by one hour reperfusion. Animals were divided into two groups: Group I control dogs (n = 21) no drugs were given; in Group II. (n = 20) short half-life beta-blocker esmolol HCl (Brevibloc) was administered intravenously. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) were isolated from venous blood before and after LAD ligature and following reperfusion. Spontaneous and phorbol myrystate acetate (PMA) stimulated superoxide radical generation of isolated PMN was measured. Platelets were separated at the same periods and maximal aggregation was determined in platelet rich plasma (PRP) after stimulation with collagen, adrenaline and ADP. There was no spontaneous radical production of PMN neither in the control, nor in the Brevibloc treated animals. Neutrophil superoxide production after activation in Group I was 9.54 +/- 0.3 O2-/min/1.5 x 10(6) before LAD ligature, and significant elevation was present following one hour reperfusion (14.8 +/- 0.8 O2-/min/1.5 x 10(6)). Increased production of neutrophils was inhibited by beta-blocker therapy (9.32 +/- 1.05, 8.25 +/- 0.82 respectively). Collagen and ADP stimulated platelet aggregation increased more than 20% during ischemia in Group I, which elevated further after reperfusion. Administration of Brevibloc diminished maximal aggregation in both cases, after 1-2 hours of LAD ligature and after reperfusion, compared to the initial value. Our findings suggested that ultrashort-acting beta-blocker has in vivo inhibitory action on neutrophil superoxide generation and platelet aggregation influencing the pathological cellular interactions.", 
    "11": "There is no known treatment capable of avoiding extension and rupture of aneurysms of the abdominal aorta. There has however been much work recently suggesting a favourable effect of beta-blockers. Early work with experimental animal models of aortic aneurysms showed that Propranolol has a protective effect on extension and rupture of these aneurysms. Studies of the biochemistry of the aortic wall have shown that Propranolol has an independent effect on blood pressure, stimulation lysyl-oxidase and production of intermolecular elastin bridges which strengthen the arterial wall. In man, Propranolol slows the progressive dilatation of the aorta in Marfan's disease. These data on atherosclerosis aneurysms are only part of the picture, but 3 studies have shown that slower widening of the aorta diameter is related to treatment with beta-blockers. In conclusion, the surgical indications for aneurysms in 1995 are unchanged from those in 1994. In cases where surgery is not indicated (patient refusal, operative risk too high, small aneurysms) could comprise a study group for a randomized evaluation against placebo of the effect of beta-blockers. A controlled study is required before therapeutic strategies can be modified.", 
    "12": "This report presents the conclusions of a Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee convened to evaluate the safety of residues of certain veterinary drugs in food and to recommend maximum levels for such residues in foods. The first part of the report considers the evaluation of veterinary drugs with a long history of use and the implications of veterinary drug use in aquaculture, and discusses the need for adequate data. A summary follows of the Committee's evaluations of toxicological and residue data on a variety of veterinary drugs: a beta-adrenoceptor-blocking agent (carazolol), seven antimicrobial agents (dihydrostreptomycin and streptomycin, enrofloxacin, gentamicin, neomycin, oxolinic acid and spiramycin) a glucocorticosteroid (dexamethasone), and a tranquilizing agent (azaperone). Annexed to the report are a summary of the Committee's recommendations on these drugs, including Acceptable Daily intakes and Maximum Residue Limits, and a list of further toxicological studies and other information required or desired.", 
    "13": "The effects of a combination regimen of metoprolol and beta 1-adrenoceptor agonist denopamine on resting and exercise heart rate have been studied in 10 normal volunteers. Maximal ramp upright bicycle exercise was performed three times at 1-week intervals. Two hours before each exercise test, 5 mg metoprolol plus 20 mg denopamine, 5 mg metoprolol plus a denopamine placebo, or two placebos were orally administered in a double-blind fashion. During exercise after placebo administration, heart rate increased in parallel with the exercise intensity. Compared to the placebo values, resting heart rate was significantly decreased by an average of 10 beats.min-1 by 5 mg metoprolol, whereas it was not altered by the combination regimen. During exercise, however, both the combination regimen and metoprolol alone showed a significant negative chronotropic effect, decreasing peak exercise heart rate by an average of 14 and 21 beats.min-1, respectively. Peak oxygen uptake was also significantly decreased by both regimens. We conclude that concomitant administration of 5 mg metoprolol and 20 mg denopamine exerts an effective beta-adrenoceptor blocking action during exercise but a minimal effect at rest in normal subjects. The combination regimen appears to have a favourable pharmacological profile for beta-adrenoceptor blocker therapy in patients with chronic heart failure.", 
    "14": "Isolation and purification of a lethal protein toxin from the Indian catfish Plotosus canius, Hamilton, venom is described. The purification procedure involved ammonium sulfate precipitate of crude venom followed by DEAE-ion exchange chromatography. The purified toxin (toxin-PC) was homogeneous on one-dimensional PAGE and PAS-negative, and had a molecular weight 15 Kd. Toxin-PC was lethal (LD50 225 micrograms/kg, intravenous, in mice) and cardiotoxic, having neuromuscular blocking activity. Toxin-PC produced cardiac arrest on isolated toad and guinea pig hearts. Prior administration of atropine and propanolol failed to counteract toxin activity on isolated heart preparations. On isolated chick biventer cervicis, toxin-PC produced total blockage of electrically-induced twitch response without affecting carbachol- and acetylcholine-induced contraction. The tension developed by the muscle was Ca++ ion-dependent. Neuromuscular blocking time was reduced when K+ ion concentration was increased in the medium. Antiserum raised against toxin-PC failed to antagonize lethal activity of toxin-PC in mice. Toxin-PC probably represents a major toxic component of catfish venom (P. canius), and was responsible for the pathophysiological changes.", 
    "15": "Coolia monotis is a benthic dinoflagellate previously thought to be non-toxic. We describe a new toxin, named cooliatoxin, purified from cultures of a strain of C. monotis isolated from Australia. Cooliatoxin is likely a mono-sulphated, polyether toxin (M = 1,062; i.p. LD50 = 1 mg/kg in mice) that induces hypothermia and respiratory failure in mice after a pronounced delay period during which there are no obvious signs of intoxication. These signs in mice are similar to those reported for the shellfish toxin named yessotoxin and the molecular weight of cooliatoxin corresponds to the mono-sulphated form of yessotoxin, suggesting that cooliatoxin may be an analogue of yessotoxin. Cooliatoxin has no effect on the mouse phrenic nerve or diaphragm musculature in vitro but causes initial stimulation and subsequent block of unmylenated nerves in vitro. In isolated guinea pig left atria, cooliatoxin (above 20 nm) induced a slow developing concentration dependent sustained inotropic response. Propranolol or tetrodotoxin reversed the positive inotropic effects, indicating that the majority of the cooliatoxin induced response was mediated by stimulation of nerves associated with the atrial musculature, resulting in the release of noradrenaline. Cooliatoxin induced transient contractions in isolated guinea pig vas deferens preparations. Atria and vas deferens preparations were tachyphylactic to a second equivalent dose of cooliatoxin applied after the effects of the first dose had diminished. The observed in vitro effects of cooliatoxin on peripheral nerves are unlikely to account for the lethal effects in mice and a central action of this toxin is suspected.", 
    "16": "The intention of this study was to supply additional information about direct effects of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist indorenate on the arterial blood pressure. The effects of indorenate were compared with those of buspirone and ipsapirone (all selective 5-HT1A agonists) on the blood pressure of pithed rats. These compounds increased the blood pressure in a dose-dependent fashion. The effects of either ipsapirone or buspirone were clearly inhibited with 100 micrograms/kg of prazosin (selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist), whereas 1 mg/kg of this blocker elicited only a mild inhibition of the pressor effect of indorenate. Pindolol (100 micrograms/kg; a beta-adrenoceptor and 5-HT1 receptor blocker) was unable to modify the effects of all the 5-HT1A agonists tested. In addition, the 5-HT2 receptor and weak alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocker ketanserin (10-100 micrograms/kg) antagonized the pressor effect of indorenate. Nevertheless, only a mild inhibition was observed in the case of both ipsapirone and buspirone. On the other hand, the latter drugs diminished the blood pressure of pithed rats intravenously infused with norepinephrine, but indorenate was inactive. However, in rats infused with quipazine, all the 5-HT1A agonists failed to reduce blood pressure. These results indicate that buspirone and ipsapirone behaved as partial alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonists. Furthermore, the results show that indorenate-elicited pressor effects are probably due to stimulation of 5-HT2 receptors. Thus, unlike ipsapirone and buspirone, indorenate did not show conclusively activity related with alpha 1-adrenoceptors.", 
    "17": "The use of the non-selective beta-blocker propranolol has been widely recommended to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with portal hypertension. We conducted a prospective, randomized controlled trial of metoprolol, a selective beta-blocker for prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding from portal hypertension in 29 non-selected patients with liver disease and previous gastrointestinal bleeding. Fifteen patients received placebo treatment for 40 +/- 18 months and 14 patients received metoprolol for 31 +/- 17 months. A sustained reduction in resting pulse was observed in those patients treated with metoprolol. There was no significant difference in acute re-bleeding episodes between the two groups. Of the 14 patients treated with metoprolol, three (21%) re-bled, all three requiring blood transfusion. Four (26.5%) of the 15 patients treated with the placebo re-bled, two cases with acute bleeding and the remaining two cases presented a positive stool guaiac test. All cases who bled during the metoprolol therapy required exclusion from the trial, and surgical procedures or sclerotherapy as well. After both metoprolol or placebo treatments, similar deterioration of standard liver function tests was observed. Further, at the end of the trial, 11 patients on metoprolol (78%) and four of the patients treated with the placebo (27%) required treatment for clinical portal-systemic encephalopathy (p < 0.01). The risk of poor sympathomimetic response after cardioselective beta 1-blocker during acute bleeding episodes and the appearance of hepatic encephalopathy deserve further investigation. The selective beta-blocker metoprolol seems to be an inadequate choice to prevent gastrointestinal re-bleeding in patients with portal hypertension.", 
    "18": "beta adrenergic receptors (R) on murine lymphocytes stimulated with concanavalin A (Con A) and tumor lymphoid cell line (BW5147) were characterized by beta radioligand binding of 125Icyanopindolol (125I-CYP). The functionality was also assesses by hormone-dependent changes in cyclic 3', 5', adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels on intact cell. Both types of cells displayed a reduced number of beta adrenergic receptors by 125I-CYP specific binding. However BW5147 cell line were unable to respond to beta agonist stimulation meanwhile the response of lymphocytes stimulated with Con A was lower than normal lymphocytes. Despite this difference both kind of cells displayed an increase in cAMP production induced by Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1). It can be concluded that functional beta R are absent in BW5147 cell line. The possible implication of alternative transmission pathway and neuroendocrine control in tumor lymphoid cells is discussed.", 
    "19": "Patients with diabetes mellitus have a exaggerated risk for cardio- and cerebrovascular complications. Hypertension is very common in these patients. To date, betablockers and diuretics are the only antihypertensive agents for which a reduction of cardio- and cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity in patients with or without diabetes mellitus has been proven. Metabolic effects of these substances are clinically irrelevant or non existent. Proposed advantages of the newer antihypertensive agents, such as reduction of insulin resistance or a specific nephroprotective effect of ACE-inhibitors, has not been proven yet in a scientific way.", 
    "20": "The potential effects of anti-glaucoma drugs, such as levobunolol and timolol, on blood flow in the posterior segment of the eye are of great interest in terms of changes in optic nerve head perfusion and prevention of visual field loss. These effects are related to the rate and extent of their absorption into the site of action. In this study, the concentrations of timolol and levobunolol in the aqueous humor, iris-ciliary body, vitreous humor, choroid-retina, and optic nerve were compared following instillation of a single drop of 0.5% ophthalmic solutions into albino rabbit eyes. Tissue drug and metabolite concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Dihydrobunolol (DHB) is an equipotent metabolite of levobunolol. In the anterior segment of the eye, levobunolol plus DHB concentrations were higher than timolol concentrations in aqueous humor and were comparable to those of timolol in iris-ciliary body. However, in the choroid-retina and optic nerve, timolol concentrations were greater than those of levobunolol plus DHB. Overall, the study demonstrates comparable concentrations of levobunolol and timolol in the anterior section of the eye. The low availability of levobunolol in the posterior segment as compared to timolol may be a key advantage for levobunolol in producing less adverse effect on blood flow in the choroid-retina and optic nerve.",

Intra-ocular pressure was greater than 21 mmHg with beta-blocker alone. One instillation of 2% carteolol-2% pilocarpine combination was given twice a day for one month. Before and after this treatment, intra-ocular pressure was measured at 9 am (12 hours after evening instillation) and at 11 am (2 hours after morning instillation).",

    "25": "Early substantial evidence of the low susceptibility to beta-adrenoceptor antagonists of non alpha-adrenergic responses reducing gut motility and tone was reluctantly accepted as indicating a third beta-receptor subtype different from the beta 1 and beta 2. This applied likewise to lipolysis until new selective \"lipolytic\" beta-agonists poorly effective at established beta-receptors were introduced. Shortly afterwards these \"lipolytic\" as well as certain newer and even more selective beta-adrenoceptor agonists were shown to be potent inhibitors of intestinal motility. The latter are the \"gut-specific\" phenylethanolaminotetralins whose availability as pure isomers attested to the stringent stereochemical requirements for selectivity at non-beta 1, non-beta 2 beta-adrenoceptors. Acceptance of the functionally based concept of a beta 3-adrenoceptor was boosted on structural grounds by molecular biology studies. Sequence analysis indicated the existence in humans and rodents of genes coding for a third subtype of beta-receptor that, when expressed in transfected heterologous cells, had a pharmacological profile distinct from the previously established subtypes. Finally, aryloxypropanolaminotetralins have been prepared as the first selective antagonists of beta 3-adrenoceptors, thus providing unambiguous conclusive evidence of the distinctive functional features of those abundant in the rat colon. The therapeutic potential in gastroenterology of the newer compounds targetable on the beta 3-adrenoceptor is suggested by their potent intestinal action in vivo in animal models without any of the cardiovascular or other unwanted effects of conventional beta-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists, and by the clinically confirmed importance of beta-adrenergic control of motor function throughout the alimentary canal. However, open questions include the incidence of species-related differences in beta 3-adrenoceptors, and as yet there are no data on gastrointestinal functions in humans under the influence of drugs designed to act selectively at these receptors.", 
    "26": "The effects of endothelins on cyclic AMP production have been studied in rabbit and human ciliary processes. Endothelins inhibit basal, isoproterenol-, and VIP-stimulated cyclic AMP production in rabbit ciliary processes and forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP production in rabbit and human ciliary processes. EC50s for inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP production using rabbit tissue were similar: ET-1, 70 nM; ET-2, 40 nM; ET-3, 70 nM; maximum inhibition was about 76% for each ligand. These data are consistent with the presence of an ETB receptor. Endothelin-like immunoreactivity in rabbit aqueous humor was measured to be 226 pg/ml.", 
    "27": "The effect on intraocular pressure (IOP) of a 2-week washout following long-term ocular therapy with topical levobunolol or timolol for an average period of 30 months was investigated in 20 patients (11 whites and 9 blacks) with early primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertensive glaucoma suspect status. The 2-week washout IOP was significantly lower than the pretreatment baseline IOP in the total 20 patients (P < 0.001), and in the 9 black patients (P = 0.004), but not in the 11 white patients (P = 0.065). However, the washout IOP was found to be significantly lower than the baseline IOP in the 5 whites with brown irides (P = 0.024) but not in the 6 whites with blue irides (P = 0.574). Thus, the 2-week washout following long-term ocular therapy with a topical beta 1-, beta 2-blocker appears insufficient to restore IOP to the pretreatment baseline level in blacks and in the whites with brown irides, whereas it may be adequate in the majority of the whites with blue irides.", 
    "28": "To clarify the mechanism for Cl- transport in swine tracheal submucosal gland cells, we measured chloride (Cl-) flux by means of a Cl(-)-sensitive fluorophore, 6-methoxy-N-(3-sulfopropyl)quinolinium (SPQ). An abrupt change of Cl(-)-free bath to a Cl(-)-containing (114 mM) solution induced the Cl- influx into the cells at a rate of 0.52 mM/s (p < 0.05). Removal of sodium (Na+) and the addition of 0.5 mM furosemide significantly reduced the rate of gradient-induced Cl- influx to 0.21 (p < 0.05) and 0.19 mM/s (p < 0.05), respectively. In gland tissue treated with 0.1 mM ouabain, the removal of external potassium (K+) in the presence of 5 mM barium significantly reduced the rate of Cl- influx to 0.21 mM/s (p < 0.05). An abrupt change from a Cl(-)-containing bath to a Cl(-)-free solution induced the Cl- efflux from the cells at a rate of 0.10 mM/s (p < 0.05). Acetylcholine increased the rate of gradient-induced Cl- efflux in a dose-dependent manner to 0.78 mM/s at 10(-6) M. This effect of acetylcholine was significantly diminished by diphenylamine-2-carboxylic acid (DPC, 10(-9) M), a Cl- channel blocker (p < 0.05). Isoproterenol (10(-5) M) had no effect on the Cl- efflux. These findings indicate that a Na-K-Cl co-transporter plays a major role in Cl- entry, and that Cl- efflux was activated by cholinergic receptor stimulation, but not by beta-adrenergic stimulation, via a DPC-inhibitable Cl- channel.", 
    "29": "A 61-year-old woman had proptosis, pulsation of the globe, orbital bruit and epibulbar congestion in the left eye. The cavernous sinus appeared enlarged by computed tomography. No trauma was noted. Despite the lack of carotid angiographic findings, the patient was diagnosed as having spontaneous carotid cavernous fistula. No surgery was performed. At the age of 67 years, the patient complained of pain in the left eye. Acute angle-closure glaucoma, choroidal detachment and exudative retinal detachment were concurrently found in the left eye. An ocular pulse on the tonography reading in the left eye was larger than in the right eye. Concurrent acute angle-closure glaucoma, choroidal detachment and exudative retinal detachment with carotid cavernous fistula, as found in our patient, may be rare.", 
    "30": "To investigate pattern electroretinogram changes in treated ocular hypertension, we evaluated pattern electroretinogram recordings of 48 hypertensive eyes following an 8-month timolol maleate therapy. During treatment, 27 of 48 eyes had normalized intraocular pressures (15-18 mm Hg), while 21 retained elevated values (21-25 mm Hg). Twenty-eight eyes with untreated hypertension (22-25 mm Hg) lasting at least 8 months, as well as 32 untreated, normotensive eyes served as controls. When compared to untreated normotensive controls, timolol-treated eyes with either elevated or normalized intraocular pressures showed reductions in the mean electroretinographic amplitudes. However, these amplitude reductions were substantially greater in treated eyes with elevated pressures as compared to those with normalized ones. Untreated hypertensive controls showed pattern electroretinogram reductions, with respect to normal values, that were comparable to those of treated hypertensive eyes, but larger than those of treated normotensive ones. These results indicate that, in treated ocular hypertension, pattern electroretinogram losses tend to be associated with moderately increased intraocular pressures in the range of 21-25 mm Hg. Electroretinographic abnormalities may be, at least in part, prevented only by lowering intraocular pressure into a normal range.", 
    "31": "A novel technique is described in which the effect of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists timolol and carteolol, and the vasodilators sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and verapamil on intraocular pressure (IOP) and the distribution of ocular flow in the bovine arterially perfused eye is investigated using radiolabelled microspheres. At maximum IOP-reducing dose timolol was found to significantly reduce perfusion in the choroid and, at higher dose, it was found to significantly reduce perfusion in the iris. By contrast, a maximal IOP-reducing dose of carteolol markedly reduced perfusion in the iris, ciliary body and choroid. Vasoconstriction induced by carteolol was not inhibited by the alpha-antagonist phentolamine. Against a background of vascular tone induced by noradrenaline, SNP and verapamil were found to significantly increase perfusion in the iris, ciliary body and choroid. The effects of these drugs upon the vasculature of the bovine perfused eye are varied and complex and may not bear a direct relationship to their ocular hypotensive effect.", 
    "32": "This study compared the effects on blood pressure and some metabolic variables of a 3-month period addition therapy of urapidil or metoprolol in 273 hypertensive non-responders to nifedipine sustained release (SR) monotherapy. This was a randomised, open-label, controlled, parallel-group comparative study, followed by another 3-month period during which all patients received the combination nifedipine SR-urapidil independently of the treatment they were previously randomized to. Both treatments caused significant falls in systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) when compared with the nifedipine SR monotherapy phase. The addition of urapidil to nifedipine SR caused a significant blood pressure reduction of 16.6/13.6 mmHg (p < 0.001), whereas after metoprolol the decrease was of 15.1/14 mmHg (p < 0.001). While in the overall population there was no statistically significant difference between the reduction caused by the two antihypertensive agents added to nifedipine SR, significant differences (DBP, p < 0.05; SBP, p < 0.01) were observed in the group of 51 patients aged at least 60 years. Total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol were significantly reduced (p < 0.001) after the addition of urapidil to nifedipine SR, while, on the contrary, the addition of metoprolol to nifedipine SR was followed by a significant rise (p = 0.001). The changes caused by the two agents were statistically different among them (p < 0.01). The non-atherogenic HDL-cholesterol did not change during the addition of urapidil or metoprolol to nifedipine SR, while, the HDL/total cholesterol ratio was significantly increased after the addition of urapidil (p < 0.01) and unmodified after the addition of metoprolol. Between-group analysis showed a significant difference (p = 0.005). Serum triglycerides did not change in the urapidil plus nifedipine SR group but significantly increased in the metoprolol plus nifedipine SR group (p < 0.001); between-group difference was not statistically significant. Plasma glucose was unchanged after the addition of urapidil whereas it was significantly (p < 0.001) increased in the metoprolol-added group with a between-group difference statistically significant (p < 0.05). When metoprolol was substituted by urapidil during the second 3-month period, the negative effects on glucose, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides were abolished while in the group already treated with urapidil plus nifedipine SR the favourable effects of urapidil plus nifedipine SR on total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and HDL/total cholesterol ratio were significantly increased compared with the end of the first 3-month treatment. The results of this study show that when urapidil and metoprolol are added to non-responders to nifedipine SR therapy there is a clinically and statistically relevant blood pressure reduction with both agents, with a therapeutic advantage for the combination urapidil + nifedipine SR in patients more than 60 years old. Moreover, the addition of urapidil was associated with a more favourable effect on serum lipids and glucose than that produced by the addition of metoprolol.",

    "35": "PHA-stimulated T cells from both groups expressed peaks of p-tyr after 15 min and 4 h. In T cells from psoriatics, the 15-min peak was smaller but the 4-hour peak reached an enormous maximum, which was 270% higher than the basic p-tyr value. PHA-stimulated T cells were additionally treated with psoriasis-provoking drugs (lithium, chloroquine, propranolol and ethanol) and the two immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A and FK 506. Lithium and propranolol were able to increase the p-tyr level after 15 min in PHA-stimulated T cells from psoriatics in contrast to controls. Chloroquine and ethanol did not have a significant effect on T cells of both groups. CsA markedly diminished the phosphorylation of intracellular tyrosines in T cells of psoriatics and controls, whereas FK 506 diminished the p-tyr level in controls only slightly.",

    "37": "Preoperative cardiac assessment may be difficult in patients with aorto-iliac and/or peripheral vascular disease because of severe physical limitation due to the disease itself, advanced age, locomotor problems or because of beta-blocker usage. 216 patients with aorto-iliac occlusive disease were studied; several cardiac risk scoring systems were determined for each patient. Preoperative echocardiography was performed in 182 patients and thallium-scanning in 63 patients. The results from the preoperative risk factor evaluations, echocardiographies and thallium examinations were correlated individually with the postoperative observed cardiac complications. Overall mortality was 2.8% (4 patients died from myocardial infarction). A total of 13 major postoperative cardiac events (10 myocardial infarctions and 3 life-threatening arrhythmias) were registered. No statistical correlation could be identified between the patient's clinical examination nor the scoring system and the occurrence of postoperative cardiac complications. 12 events occurred out of 13 patients who were shown to have a reversible defect on the preoperative thallium scan. These patients also presented hypokinesia or akinesia on the preoperative echocardiography. Thallium imaging and echocardiography represent a valid preoperative test to evaluate the risk of cardiac morbidity and mortality in vascular patients. Coronary angiography is recommended in patients suffering from progressive and/or unstable angina.", 
    "38": "We have previously shown that sotalol, a class III antiarrhythmic agent, helps spontaneous ventricular defibrillation in various mammalian species. Since we hypothesized that self ventricular defibrillation depends on a high degree of intercellular synchronization, and since the major electrophysiological action of sotalol causing prolongation of action potential duration (APD), cannot fully explain its defibrillating property, we carried out a series of studies to examine the effect of sotalol on intercellular myocardial coupling. Guinea pig right ventricular muscle preparations were superfused in a tissue bath and the spread of intracellularly injected fluorescent dye (Lucifer yellow CH) to the neighboring cells was studied under various conditions. When either the Ca2+ concentration of Tyrode's solution was elevated to 6 mM or the solution was made hypoxic by not bubbling O2 (n = 3 each), no spread of the injected dye was observed. The addition of 1 microM sotalol to the high Ca2+ solution or 0.5 microM to the hypoxic superfusate (n = 3 each) caused a wide spreading of the dye, thus strongly suggesting a marked improvement in the intercellular coupling. These results show an entirely new property of sotalol, i.e., enhancement of cellular synchronization, which may better explain its ability to cause spontaneous ventricular defibrillation than its class III action. Our previous demonstration of successful spontaneous ventricular defibrillation by several other agents that are known to enhance intercellular coupling but have contrasting actions on APD further substantiates our hypothesis.", 
    "39": "The physiological function of beta 2-adrenergic receptors in the neonatal and adult heart is incompletely understood, and possible age-dependent differences in beta 2-receptor actions have not been considered. We used isoproterenol (mixed beta 1- and beta 2-receptor agonist) and zinterol (beta 2-selective agonist) to compare beta-receptor subtype actions in neonatal and adult rat ventricular myocytes. When delivered as a bolus at a final concentration of 10(-7) mol/L, both isoproterenol and zinterol increased the amplitude and hastened the kinetics of the calcium and cell-shortening transients in neonatal myocytes. Under identical experimental conditions, isoproterenol increased the amplitude and accelerated the kinetics of the calcium transient and the twitch in adult myocytes, whereas zinterol did not. In the presence of CGP 20712A (beta 1-receptor blocker), a 100-fold higher concentration of zinterol increased the amplitude but prolonged the duration of the twitch in adult myocytes. To probe the mechanism for this age-dependent difference in beta 2-receptor responsiveness, we compared beta-receptor expression and stimulation of cAMP accumulation in neonatal and adult myocytes. beta-Receptor density was 44,339 +/- 5178 sites per cell in neonatal myocytes and 186,346 +/- 13,356 sites per cell in adult myocytes; the relative proportion of beta 2-receptors was comparable in each (16.7 +/- 2.3% and 16.9 +/- 0.9%, respectively). Isoproterenol induced a large increase in cAMP accumulation in neonatal and adult myocytes (20.0 +/- 1.0- and 20.6 +/- 2.6-fold over basal). In contrast, zinterol evoked a substantial increase in cAMP accumulation in neonatal myocytes but only a minor increase in adult myocytes. These studies provide evidence that at low agonist concentrations, beta 2-receptor activation contributes to the positive inotropic response by increasing cAMP and increasing the amplitude and hastening the kinetics of the twitch in neonatal, but not adult, myocytes. Moreover, these results suggest that age-dependent differences in beta 2-receptor coupling to more distal elements in the signaling cascade can influence myocyte beta 2-receptor responsiveness.",

    "41": "Intraocular pressure of 120 patients was measured the day before, as well as two to four, five to seven and 22 to 24 hours after uncomplicated cataract extraction. 47 patients were operated with phacoemulsification and sclerocorneal sutureless tunnel (phaco/tunnel). 61 patients with phacoemulsification and corneoscleral incision and suture (phaco/suture), and 12 patients with extracapsular technique (ECCE). 48 operations were done by inexperienced surgeons (less than 200 intraocular operations), 72 by experienced surgeons (300-2000 intraocular operations). Patients were treated with either levobunolol, acetazolamide, apraclonidine, or placebo. Each treatment group contained 30 patients.", 
    "42": "In all groups, the mean intraocular pressure increased to a maximum at five to seven hours after surgery. The pressure rise was significantly higher in the ECCE group (20.6 mm Hg) than in the phaco/suture group (10.5 mm Hg) and in the phaco/tunnel group (5.4 mm Hg, p always < 0.05). Eyes operated by inexperienced surgeons had a significantly (p < 0.005) greater pressure rise (12.9 mm Hg) than eyes operated by experienced surgeons (7.1 mm Hg). Treatment had no significant (p = 0.41) effect on the intraocular pressure rise.", 
    "43": "The intraocular pressure rise after cataract extraction strongly depends on the surgical technique and to a lesser extent, on the surgeon's experience.

    "44": "Body surface QRST isointegral maps in patients with long QT syndrome (LQTS) often show multipolar distribution. We recorded body surface maps in eight cases with LQTS. There were same day variations in the distribution of multipolarity and unipolarity in two of seven cases, and day-to-day variation in one of seven cases. In two of four cases, the distribution of the map changed from unipolarity to multipolarity following hand-pushing exercise. When two patients with same day variation or day-to-day variation were administered beta-adrenergic blocking agents, their QRST isointegral maps all showed unipolar distribution and had no variations. These findings suggest that QRST isointegral map can be a useful method for predicting the effectiveness of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs in idiopathic long QT syndrome.",

    "46": "The upstroke velocity and the conduction velocity of the action potential were recorded by conventional two-microelectrode techniques in the guinea pig ventricular papillary muscle superfused with normoxic and hypoxic Tyrode solution of various potassium concentrations ([K+]o 2.7-16.7 mM), stimulated at 0.2 Hz.", 
    "47": "Under normoxic conditions, the upstroke of action potentials is composed of two components, dV/dtmax,fast followed by dV/dtmax,slow, when the muscle were perfused with relatively high [K+]o (10.8-16.7 mM). The dV/dtmax,fast is a measure of the residual (mostly inactivated) sodium current, while the dV/dtmax,slow is a measure of calcium current. The conduction velocity at 13-17 mM [K+]o ranged from 30-40 cm.s-1 (slow conduction) with depolarised membrane potentials of about -60 mV. Isoprenaline in increasing concentrations (0.01-1 microM) did not significantly alter the conduction velocity but altered the ionic channels responsible for the slow conduction from residual sodium channel to calcium channel. In the presence of D600 (2 microM) or 1-verapamil (2.2 microM), isoprenaline (0.1 microM) rapidly decreased dV/dtmax,fast without increasing dV/dtmax,slow and a conduction block occurred. In the presence of pindolol (2 microM), all the effects of isoprenaline on dV/dtmax,fast, dV/dtmax,slow, and conduction velocity were abolished. Noradrenaline has the same effects as isoprenaline, although the potency was much less. Under hypoxic conditions, the effects of catecholamines on the dV/dtmax,fast was the same as under normoxic conditions.", 
    "48": "Catecholamines alter the ionic channel responsible for the slow conduction of reentry circuit from residual sodium to calcium channel, or vice versa, depending on the local concentrations of catecholamines. In the presence of a calcium antagonist, catecholamines strongly depress the (dV/dtmax,fast dependent) slow conduction, leading to a complete block of conduction, under both normoxia and hypoxia.", 
    "49": "Several studies have shown that long-term therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may reduce urinary protein excretion and decrease the rate of progression of renal disease in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus more effectively than conventional antihypertensive drugs. Only few studies, however, have been performed in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). To compare the effects of captopril with more conventional drugs on proteinuria and progression of renal disease, we conducted a prospective, 18-month study in 42 proteinuric (> 500 mg/day) NIDDM and, for comparison, in 31 nondiabetic patients with a variety of renal diseases (NDRD). Twenty-four NIDDM patients were treated with captopril and 18 with conventional drugs. Eighteen NDRD patients received captopril, and 13 received conventional drugs. Baseline proteinuria and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were not different among groups. The blood pressure decreased equally in all group of patients, irrespective of whether they received captopril or conventional drugs. Urinary protein excretion, however, decreased significantly only in NIDDM and NDRD patients treated with captopril. The GFR decreased only in patients treated with conventional drugs, but not in those treated with captopril. The rate of decline in GFR in NIDDM patients treated with captopril was significantly lower than in patients treated with conventional drugs. However, in NDRD patients treated with captopril, the rate of decline in GFR was not different from that in patients treated with conventional drugs. The reduction of urinary protein excretion was poorly correlated with changes in blood pressure or with changes in renal function and renal hemodynamics. Serum potassium increased significantly in patients treated with captopril.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

It also increased exercise capacity significantly as compared to placebo (P < 0.001). All the patients were followed up to the period of 9 months and no adverse effects were seen. We conclude that beta adrenergic blocking drugs like atenolol can be used as the only treatment for patients with mitral stenosis without congestive heart failure and in sinus rhythm, for long-term symptomatic relief.",

    "52": "1. The binding properties of beta 1-, beta 2- and beta 3-adrenoceptors were determined in isolated brown adipocytes of the rat rather than in membrane preparations from tissue homogenates, because typical brown adipocytes represent only about 40% of the various cells present in brown adipose tissue. Binding characteristics were assessed with the hydrophilic beta-adrenoceptor radioligand, (-)-[3H]-CGP 12177. The potent beta-antagonist, bupranolol (100 microM) was used to determine nonspecific binding. Characterization was essentially performed by saturation and competition studies. 2. The saturation curve of (-)-[3H]-CGP 12177 was clearly biphasic (Hill coefficient, nH = 0.57 +/- 0.11, P < 0.01) indicating the presence of two different beta-adrenoceptor populations of high (KD = 0.24 +/- 0.04 nM) and low (KD = 80 +/- 7 nM) affinity. The low affinity sites were more numerous (Bmax = 121,000 +/- 30,000 sites/cell) than the high affinity sites (Bmax = 12,000 +/- 1,000 sites/cell). 3. (-)-[3H]-CGP 12177 (25 nM) was displaced by adrenaline (Ad), noradrenaline (NA), isoprenaline (Iso), phenylephrine (Phe) and by the new beta 3 agonist, CL 316,243 (CL) in a biphasic pattern. The order of potency for (-)-[3H]-CGP 12177 displacement from the small population of high affinity sites (Iso > NA > Ad > CL > Phe was in agreement with a beta 1/beta 2-classification. In contrast, the potencies of the same agonists for displacing the radioligand from the low affinity binding sites (CL > Iso > NA > Ad > Phe) revealed the presence of a distinct population of adrenoceptors obeying a beta 3-classification. 5-HT did not displace (-)-[3H]-CGP 12177 (25 nM) when used at concentrations as high as 0.1 mM.4. The beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, (-)-bupranolol, was more effective than (-)-propranolol for displacing(- )-[3H]-CGP 12177 (25 nM) from the high (Ki= 0.029 =/- 0.011 and 0.19 +/- 0.07 nM, respectively and low (Ki= 0.27 +/- 0.04 microM and 1.6 +/- 0.2 lM, respectively) affinity binding sites. The selective beta 1 antagonist CGP 20712A efficiently displaced the radioligand from a small population (Ki = 65 +/- 19 pM)of binding sites, confirming the presence of beta 1-adrenoceptors.5. To evaluate whether beta 2-adrenoceptors could be identified in the population of high affinity binding sites, displacement studies were performed at a low concentration of (- )-[3H]-CGP 12177 (4 nM) that mainly labelled beta 1/beta 2-adrenoceptors. ICI 118 551 ( a selective beta 2-antagonist) and procaterol (a selective beta 2-agonist) displaced (- )-[3H]-CGP 12177 from its binding sites with very low affinity (Ki = 0.17 +/- 0.02 micro M and Ki = 11 +/- 2 micro M respectively).6. From these observations, we conclude that: (1) two kinds of binding sites with low and high affinities for (-)-[H]-CGP 12177 can be detected in intact brown adipocytes, (2) there are 10 times more low than high affinity beta-adrenoceptors, as determined by saturation or competition curve analysis, (3) the high affinity binding sites mainly correspond to beta1-adrenoceptors, whereas the low affinity sites represent beta 3-adrenoceptors, and (4) beta 2-adrenoceptors are undetectable.7. It is suggested that the low affinity beta 3-adrenoceptors represent the physiological receptors for noradrenaline secreted from sympathetic nerve endings when the concentration of the neurohormone in the synaptic cleft is very high and/or when the high affinity beta 1-adrenoceptors are desensitized by prolonged sympathetic stimulation such as chronic cold exposure.", 
    "53": "The long term effects of two dose regimens of latanoprost (PhXA41) administered to eyes concomitantly treated with timolol which had not adequately been controlled by timolol alone were compared. A total of 50 patients, 17 with primary open angle glaucoma and 33 with capsular glaucoma, were recruited from five clinics. All had glaucomatous visual field defects and an intraocular pressure (IOP) of at least 22 mm Hg despite treatment with 0.5% timolol twice daily. Patients were randomised to two treatment groups. In one group 0.006% latanoprost was given twice daily, in the other group placebo was given at 8 am and latanoprost at 8 pm for 3 months, with concomitant timolol treatment in both groups. Average daytime IOP (mean (SD)) at baseline (on timolol alone) and after 4 and 12 weeks' treatment was 24.8 (3.6), 16.8 (4.3), and 15.7 (2.4) mm Hg respectively with once daily application of latanoprost and 24.9 (2.9), 18.1 (3.0), and 18.0 (3.6) mm Hg respectively with latanoprost twice daily. No clinically significant side effects were observed during treatment. Latanoprost causes a marked and sustained IOP reduction in eyes which are also being treated with timolol. Latanoprost given once daily is at least as effective and probably superior to a twice daily dose regimen.", 
    "54": "Results on cardiac awareness in panic disorder are inconsistent. The present study attempted to clarify whether differences in instructions or the inclusion of patients taking antidepressant medication could account for these inconsistencies. 112 patients with panic disorder with agoraphobia were compared to 40 normal controls on the heartbeat perception task developed by Schandry (1981) [Schandry, R., Psychophysiology, 18, 483-488] using a standard instruction (\"count all heartbeats you feel in your body\") and a strict instruction (\"count only those heartbeats about which you are sure\"). Superior heartbeat perception for patients was only found with the standard instruction. Similarly, only with the standard instruction, patients taking medication affecting the cardiovascular system performed worse than patients without medication, as expected based on the relationship between stroke volume and heartbeat perception. The pattern of group differences indicates that agoraphobic patients have a better feeling for how fast their heart is beating than controls although these differences may be due to a tendency to interpret weak sensations as heartbeats. Furthermore, we tested in a subgroup of 40 patients whether cardiac awareness changes with exposure treatment. No changes in heartbeat perception were observed.", 
    "55": "The demonstration that the vast majority of acute transmural myocardial infarctions are caused by an occlusive thrombus in the coronary artery, together with the concept that myocardium can be salvaged for a period of time after the onset of such occlusion, has heralded a new era of management of this disorder. This involves an aggressive interventional approach aimed at restoring coronary artery patency early while decreasing myocardial oxygen demands. Abundant data show that coronary flow can be reestablished using either intravenous chemical thrombolytic agents (tissue-type plasminogen activator and streptokinase), percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, or coronary artery bypass grafting. Conjunctive aspirin or heparin therapy (or both) is effective in maintaining vessel patency once perfusion is restored. Myocardial oxygen demand can be reduced, where feasible, by pharmacotherapy and control of the patient's associated pain and anxiety. The beta-adrenergic blockers and nitrates are particularly suitable in this regard, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors favorably affect infarct expansion and ventricular remodeling. With such an approach, infarct size can be reduced, leading to improved left ventricular function--the prime determinant of morbidity and mortality in patients with acute infarction. The in-hospital mortality has fallen from about 30% three decades ago to less than 8% in many coronary care units.", 
    "56": "In anesthetized rats, injection of the beta 2-adrenoceptor (beta 2-AR) agonist clenbuterol (0.45 mumol/kg) caused a marked stimulation of 86RbCl (Rb) uptake by skeletal muscle, but had no effect on other tissues; soleus muscle showed the largest (144% increase) response. Injection of another beta 2-AR agonist (salbutamol 0.45 mumol/kg) had no effect on Rb uptake by any tissue except soleus muscle (83%). Both agonists increased body (colonic) temperature to the same extent. A 3-day treatment with salbutamol as a dietary admixture had no effect on body weight, muscle mass, or tissue Rb uptake, whereas the same treatment using clenbuterol produced significant increases in body weight and muscle mass and significant decreases in Rb uptake in three of the four muscle groups studied; Rb uptake in soleus was not affected. In another experiment, the short-term effect of clenbuterol injection on muscle Rb uptake was found to be resistant to a high dose (20 mg/kg) of the selective beta 2-AR antagonist ICI 118551. It was concluded that the selective effects of short-term administration of clenbuterol on muscle Rb uptake, coupled with its effects over 3 days on Rb uptake and muscle hypertrophy, implicate beta-AR modulation of cation transport (possibly via Na,K-adenosine triphosphatase [ATPase] activity) in the anabolic effects of clenbuterol on muscle protein deposition. Since the stimulation of Rb uptake by clenbuterol was resistant to high doses of a selective beta 2-AR antagonist and since salbutamol had little or no effect on muscle hypertrophy or Rb uptake, it is suggested that clenbuterol may exert its effects via an atypical beta-AR.",

Anxiety disorders that can be comorbid with alcoholism include panic disorder, social phobia, obsessive compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Psychotherapeutic and pharmacotherapeutic measures for each of these in the setting of alcoholism are suggested, and various possible interrelationships between anxiety disorders and alcoholism are considered. Although anxiety disorders may contribute to the underlying etiology of alcoholism in some cases, alcohol abuse tends to take on a life of its own. Treatment of an anxiety disorder can rarely, if ever, be expected to cure alcoholism. Therefore, the need to institute simultaneous treatment aimed at establishing and maintaining sobriety is emphasized. Research on anxiety disorders and alcoholism is as yet inadequate to fully answer many clinical questions about their relationship and their appropriate diagnosis and management. More research is needed in this area.", 
    "65": "We have previously reported that addition of 8-bromocyclic AMP enhances the stimulatory effect of dexamethasone on the expression of the angiotensinogen gene in mouse hepatoma cells in vitro. Isoproterenol is known to stimulate the synthesis of hepatic intracellular cyclic AMP via beta-adrenergic receptors. To study the possible effect of beta-adrenergic receptors on the expression of the angiotensinogen gene in mouse hepatoma cells, we transiently transfected them with a fusion gene with the 5'-flanking region of the angiotensinogen gene linked to a bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase coding sequence as a reporter, pOCAT (ANG N-1498/+18). The addition of isoproterenol (10(-9) to 10(-5) mol/L) alone had no stimulatory effect on the expression of pOCAT (ANG N-1498/+18). In the presence of dexamethasone (10(-6) mol/L), however, isoproterenol enhanced the stimulatory effect on the dexamethasone on the expression of pOCAT (ANG N-1498/+18). The enhancing effect of isoproterenol was inhibited by the presence of propranolol (beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptor antagonist) and ICI 118,551 (beta 2-adrenergic receptor antagonist) but not by the presence of atenolol (beta 1-adrenergic receptor antagonist). Furthermore, the addition of Rp-cAMP (an inhibitor of protein kinase A I and II) blocked the enhancing effect of isoproterenol. These studies demonstrated that isoproterenol enhances the stimulatory effect of dexamethasone on the expression of the angiotensinogen gene in mouse hepatoma cells via beta 2-adrenergic receptor and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase pathways. Our data may be important in understanding the molecular mechanism(s) of the stimulatory effect of catecholamines/glucocorticoid-induced expression of the angiotensinogen gene in the liver.", 
    "66": "Norepinephrine-induced thermogenesis was substantial in adipocytes from brown adipose tissue (BAT) of cold-acclimated guinea pigs but absent in adipocytes from BAT of warm-acclimated guinea pigs. There was no thermogenic response to any beta 3-adrenergic agonist (CL-316,243, ZD-7114, BRL-28410, CGP-12177). The receptor was characterized as a beta 1-adrenoceptor. Adrenergic agonists stimulated adenylate cyclase in membranes from BAT of both warm- and cold-acclimated guinea pigs also via a beta 1-adrenoceptor; beta 3-adrenergic agonists had no effect. Glucose transport by brown adipocytes from warm-acclimated guinea pigs was not stimulated by either norepinephrine or insulin. Cold acclimation induced the appearance of stimulation of glucose transport by norepinephrine in association with the appearance of a large capacity for thermogenesis, but there was little improvement in response to insulin. GLUT4 was present in membranes from BAT of both warm- and cold-acclimated guinea pigs. Insulin is known to have an antilipolytic effect on both BAT and white adipose tissue of guinea pigs. Thus there is a selective lack of insulin-regulated glucose transport that is not improved by cold acclimation. Guinea pigs may have a mutated component of the translocation mechanism for GLUT4. beta 3-Adrenoceptors appear to be absent in brown adipocytes of adult guinea pigs, as in white adipocytes of guinea pigs, yet are known to be present in the gut. Tissue-specific expression of beta 3-adrenergic receptors in guinea pigs may differ from that in rats, in which receptors are expressed in the adipose tissues and gut.", 
    "67": "Experiments were designed to characterize endothelin receptors in canine femoral veins and to determine whether their distribution or sensitivity could be altered by chronic changes in blood flow and oxygen tension in veins proximal to an arteriovenous fistula. Endothelium was removed from unoperated or fistula-operated femoral veins of anesthetized dogs. Veins were cut into rings and suspended in organ chambers for the measurement of isometric force or frozen for isolation of membrane proteins. Endothelin-1, endothelin-3, and sarafotoxin S6c caused concentration-dependent increases in tension in all rings. In rings of unoperated veins, maximal tensions were significantly less to endothelin-3 and sarafotoxin S6c than to endothelin-1. In rings of fistula-operated veins, maximal tensions to endothelin-1 and endothelin-3 were the same. Contractions to endothelin-1 or endothelin-3 in unoperated veins were not inhibited by an antagonist of endothelin-A receptors, BQ-123. Binding of 125I-labeled endothelin-1 (125I-endothelin-1) to membranes from veins without endothelium increased as a function of membrane protein. Affinity of receptors, as determined by competitive inhibition of 125I-endothelin-1 was as follows: endothelin-1 > endothelin-3 > sarafotoxin S6c. Competitive inhibition of 125I-endothelin-1 by endothelin-3 and sarafotoxin S6c was significant for a two-site binding model in all veins. The total number of binding sites was reduced significantly in fistula-operated veins; the relative proportions of high- and low-affinity binding sites did not change. Affinity of high- and low-affinity receptors increased in fistula-operated veins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "68": "The morpholine compound BRL-47672 has a chemical structure similar to that of clenbuterol and causes similar anabolic effects in rats but has no actions on beta 2-adrenoceptors in vitro. It has been argued therefore that beta 2-adrenoceptors do not mediate the anabolic effects of this family of compounds. In the present study BRL-47672 was shown to bind to rat beta 2-adrenoceptors with low affinity (dissociation constant 16 microM) relative to clenbuterol (48 nM) and to be a very weak activator of adenylyl cyclase activity in rat skeletal muscle membranes in vitro. In contrast, acute administration of the drug to anesthetized rats in vivo caused an increase in muscle adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate output, and chronic treatment of conscious rats for > 6 days caused a significant increase in weight gain (69%) accounted for by increased muscle growth. The anabolic effects of BRL-47672 were not counteracted by daily injections of the drug ICI-118551 (2 mg/day) but were prevented when the same beta 2-antagonist was administered in the diet (200 mg/kg feed, equivalent to 4.3 mg/day). The beta 1-adrenoceptor selective antagonist CGP-20712A fed in the diet (200 mg/kg feed) failed to attenuate the response to BRL-47672. These results support the conclusion that BRL-47672 has little direct action on beta 2-adrenoceptors but suggest that the compound is metabolized rapidly in vivo to a potent beta 2-agonist. Thus the stimulation of muscle growth by BRL-47672 is via beta 2-adrenoceptors, with no contribution to this response from beta 1- or beta 3-adrenoceptor activation.", 
    "69": "Due to the high level of expression of mRNA for the 5-hydroxytrytamine (5-ht7) receptor in the hypothalamus and the high affinity of 5-HT for this receptor, [3H]5-HT binding was performed in rat hypothalamus to determine whether 5-ht7 receptor binding sites are present in animal tissue. [3H]5-HT binding was performed in the presence of 100 nM pindolol, which is inactive at 5-ht7 receptors but prevents the binding of [3H]5-HT to 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptor binding sites. Under these conditions, [3H]5-HT bound to a binding site with an affinity of 1.94 nM. Displacement studies showed the pharmacology of the hypothalamic binding site to correlate well with the published pharmacology of the 5-ht7 receptor (r = 0.921). The treatment of rats with fluoxetine (5 mg/kg/day, orally) for 21 days caused a significant reduction in the number of hypothalamic 5-ht7 receptor binding sites. These data suggest that the 5-ht7 receptor binding site is expressed in rat hypothalamus and that this receptor binding site is down-regulated after a chronic increase in the synaptic level of 5-HT.",

    "71": "To determine the in vivo patterns of bcl-2 expression in neuroblastomas (NBs), tumor specimens derived from 17 children with NB or ganglioneuromas were immunohistochemically evaluated using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded material and antibodies specific for the Bcl-2 and N-Myc proteins, or various markers typically used to assess the differentiation status of these tumors, including neuron-specific enolase, S-100 protein, beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2M) and the intermediate filament proteins, vimentin, and neurofilament light- and medium-chains.", 
    "72": "Using two-color immunohistochemical methods, Bcl-2 protein was found exclusively in tumor cells that did not contain N-Myc, an oncoprotein previously associated with poor prognosis in NB. Levels of Bcl-2 immunostaining were heterogeneous in the undifferentiated small, round cells typically seen in tumors with aggressive histology, and ranged from essentially undetectable, to strong in intensity. Somewhat higher levels of Bcl-2 immunostaining were found in the slightly larger, more differentiated neuroblastic cells that had more generous cytoplasm in these neoplasms. In contrast to the heterogeneous levels of Bcl-2 seen in undifferentiated NBs, Bcl-2 immunoreactivity was uniformly present at high levels in tumor cells that were more differentiated and judged to be similar to immature ganglion cells at an intermediate stage of neuronal differentiation, based on morphologic characteristics and immunophenotyping with antibodies specific for various differentiation markers. The still more differentiated ganglionic cells seen in ganglioneuroblastomas and ganglioneuromas exhibited much less intense immunoreactivity with anti-Bcl-2 antibodies, suggesting down-regulation of bcl-2 during final terminal differentiation. In contrast to cells with neuronal features, the stromal Schwann cells were uniformly negative for Bcl-2 protein in all histologic grades of tumors. Thus, bcl-2 expression in NBs was limited to cells of the neuronal lineage and tended to be highest in tumor cells with the characteristics of ganglionic cell precursors. The expression of bcl-2 in the normal fetal and postnatal adrenal medulla and sympathetic ganglia paralleled that seen in NBs, consistent with previous suggestions that NB reflects a block in the normal differentiation process.", 
    "73": "Taken together, these findings indicate that the levels of the Bcl-2 protein are developmentally regulated in normal and neoplastic cells of the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system, and suggest that this oncoprotein may be useful as a differentiation marker for subclassification of NBs for prognostic purposes and for investigations of normal neuronal maturation. Furthermore, strong Bcl-2 immunoreactivity was detected in islets of residual tumor cells in 6 of 7 specimens obtained from 5 patients after therapy, suggesting that this oncoprotein may be cytoprotective for NB cells in vivo.",

Forearm blood flow was higher in the celiprolol group (p < 0.001). A stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that the beneficial effects of the beta-blockers were largely dependent on their effect on peripheral flow, in addition to reduction of the double product.",

Celiprolol contributes to nearly complete relief in three times as many patients as propranolol; after adjustment for double product, it did so in eight times as many patients. The similar effects of the two compounds on the double product, and the essentially different effects on peripheral flow, support the theory that celiprolol exerts its beneficial effect to a large extent through its vasodilatory property.",

    "83": "Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol has been implicated in the pathogenesis of glomerulosclerosis in diabetes and other forms of glomerular injury. In the present study we evaluated the effect of LDL on fibronectin synthesis in cultured rat mesangial cells (MCs) and the roles of protein kinase C (PKC) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) in mediating this LDL action. In MCs, 25 micrograms to 100 micrograms/ml LDL increased PKC activity within 15 minutes, as reflected by enhanced in situ phosphorylation of the 80 kd myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate protein, a specific endogenous substrate of PKC in MC. The same concentrations of LDL subsequently (18 to 72 hours) enhanced fibronectin synthesis, as reflected by increased incorporation of labeled methionine into fibronectin. GF 109203X, a selective inhibitor of PKC, blocked increases in both PKC activity and fibronectin synthesis induced by LDL in MCs. Furthermore, prior downregulation of PKC to less than 1% of basal activity by exposure of MCs to 0.5 mumol/L phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) also prevented LDL stimulation of fibronectin synthesis. The activation of PKC by LDL seen after 15 minutes of exposure was transient and was not observed after 4 or 48 hours of exposure of MCs to LDL. However, exposure to LDL for 48 hours, but not for 15 minutes or 4 hours, increased both maximal PKC responses to phorbol dibutyrate (PDBu) and tritiated PDBu binding to MCs by 30%. These findings suggest that chronic exposure to LDL increases the total PKC content in MCs and thereby might modulate responses to other PKC agonists. Neither the cyclooxygenase inhibitor piroxicam nor the thromboxane/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor blocker Sq-29548 altered LDL stimulation of fibronectin synthesis in MCs, suggesting that this action of LDL was not mediated by changes in MC eicosanoid generation. By contrast, antibody to TGF-beta blocked LDL stimulation of fibronectin synthesis in MCs. TGF-beta bioactivity, determined with the mink lung epithelial cell assay, was two to three times higher in the medium of MCs cultured with LDL for 24 to 48 hours as compared with corresponding control values. Total TGF-beta bioactivity examined after heat activation of latent TGF-beta was also two times higher in the medium of MCs exposed to LDL as compared with that of controls. Prior down-regulation of PKC by exposure of MCs to PMA blocked the increases in TGF-beta bioactivity induced by LDL.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "84": "Sotalol is the prototype class III agent that combines beta-blocking properties with the propensity to prolong the effective refractory period by lengthening the action potential duration. Its precise effect on the prevention of ventricular tachycardia-ventricular fibrillation (VTVF) compared to class I agents has not been evaluated in a blinded study. In a double-blind parallel-design multicenter study, the electrophysiologic and antiarrhythmic effects of intravenous and oral sotalol (n = 55) and procainamide (n = 55) were therefore compared in patients with VTVF inducible by programmed electric stimulation. Sotalol produced a greater effect on lengthening the ventricular effective refractory period (VERP). It prevented the inducibility of VTVF in 30% versus 20% for procainamide, but this was not significantly different. In an alternate therapy group (n = 41) of similar patients previously refractory to or intolerant of procainamide, intravenous sotalol prevented inducibility in 32%. The pooled overall sotalol efficacy rate was 31%. There was a significant relation between the increase in the VERP and the prevention of inducibility of VTVF (n = 56; p < 0.02). VERP of > or = 300 msec was critical for the prevention of VTVF inducibility. Thirteen sotalol and 6 procainamide responders from the randomized group and 30 from the nonrandomized groups completed 1 year of oral sotalol therapy follow-up. Life-table analysis of these patient in each group showed a trend in favor of sotalol; however, statistical analysis was not possible because of the small numbers of patients. Both sotalol and procainamide were well tolerated. In the randomized group there was one case of sudden death during treatment with sotalol and two cases of nonfatal torsades de pointes in the procainamide group and two in the sotalol group; in the nonrandomized alternate therapy group, there were 6 cases of nonfatal torsades de pointes. The data support the emerging role of sotalol in the control of symptomatic ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation.", 
    "85": "The rat gastric fundus is known to possess an \"atypical\" beta-adrenergic receptor that mediates relaxation to isoproterenol. The purpose of this study was to characterize the relationship between this \"atypical\" beta receptor in the rat stomach and the cloned rat beta 3 receptor by taking advantage of highly selective pharmacological and molecular biological probes of the beta 3 receptor. Nuclease protection analysis of RNA from the rat gastric fundus identified beta 3 receptor mRNA whose levels in the stomach were exceeded only by those in adipose tissue. Pharmacological analysis of the recombinant rat beta 3 receptor expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells indicated low affinity of propranolol with a Ki value of 2.3 microM. Therefore, 0.3 microM propranolol was chosen as a concentration that would completely block beta 1 and beta 2 receptors (Ki = 1-5 nM) but would leave beta 3 receptors largely intact in the rat stomach fundus. In the presence of propranolol, several beta-adrenergic receptor agonists relaxed the rat stomach fundus with a rank potency order of (R,R)-5-[2-[[2-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl]-amino]-propyl]1,3- benzodioxole-2,2-dicarboxylate (CL316,243) > isoproterenol > norepinephrine = epinephrine = dl-4-3[(1,1-dimethylethyl)amino]-2- hydroxylproproy]1,3 dihydro-2H-benzimidazol-2-one hydrochloride (CGP12177) > clenbuterol > terbutaline > pindolol.

However, hypertensive inbred spontaneously hypertensive rats bred in La Jolla exhibited no bradycardia. Peripheral methylatropine blocked bradycardia and unmasked tachycardia, which implies concurrent autonomic discharges on early trials. As shown here, vendor inbred Wistar-Kyoto rats from Charles River Laboratories (WKYCR) fail to show bradycardia. Because stress-induced parasympathetic responses are important to understanding arrhythmogenesis, we tested whether (WKYCR) and inbred spontaneously hypertensive rats from Charles River Laboratories (SHRCR) exhibit any parasympathetic activation by blunting sympathetic chronotropic responses with cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. WKYCR or SHRCR were pretreated with either nonselective propranolol, beta 1-selective metoprolol, beta 1-selective celiprolol (with beta 2-receptor agonist activity) or ICI 118,551, a selective beta 2-receptor antagonist. Neither propranolol nor metoprolol affected resting HR in WKYCR, but both decreased HR in SHRCR, whereas celiprolol raised resting HR only in WKYCR. Although control WKYCR nor SHRCR exhibited bradycardia, bradycardia was unmasked in both by all beta 1-selective agents but not by ICI 118,551. However, ICI 118, 551 reduced tachycardia responses over all trials in WKYCR, which suggests beta 2-adrenoceptor involvement in the stress-induced tachycardia.

The incidence and duration of complete A-V block after release of the aortic cross-clamp was monitored. Twenty-four percent of the patients developed complete A-V block that required temporary pacing for a mean time of 66 +/- 39 min. The volume of cardioplegia used was not significantly different between the patients who developed A-V block and the patients who had no block. The serum potassium level at the time of release of the aortic cross-clamp was within the normal range in both groups. Six factors were correlated with the development of A-V block: old age, preparation by a combination of beta-adrenergic blockers and calcium channel blockers, preoperative bradycardia, the number of vessels grafted, as well as the duration of ACC. Also, the serum potassium level at the time of release of the aortic cross-clamp was significantly higher in the patients who developed A-V block. The high incidence of A-V block in elderly patients undergoing multiple coronary vessel grafting during a prolonged ACC time suggests that suboptimal myocardial preservation may be the main predisposing factor.",

However, concern regarding the negative inotropic and chronotropic effects of beta-adrenergic antagonism persisting after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) has impeded the use of esmolol for this purpose during cardiac surgery. This is a randomized, double-blind prospective study of the effects of esmolol infused during CPB and the effects of hypothermic CPB on esmolol. Patients scheduled for CPB were randomized to receive intravenous esmolol (300.micrograms.kg-1.min-1 during CPB after a bolus of 2 mg/kg prior to CPB) or placebo. Infusion was stopped at 10 min after release of aortic cross-clamp. Hemodynamics were measured, as well as serum esmolol, catecholamines, lactate, and potassium. Postoperative variables measured included electrocardiographic changes, creatine kinase (CK)-MB fractions, post-CPB dysrhythmias and drugs, hospitalization time and cost, and mortality. Esmolol was administered to 16 patients and placebo to 14. Esmolol levels reached a high of 10.5 +/- 0.9 micrograms/mL during CPB, but decreased to 0.1 +/- 0.02 microgram/mL within 30 min after stopping infusion. Cardiac indices (cardiac index, stroke volume index, left cardiac work index, left ventricular stroke work index, right cardiac work index, and right ventricular stroke work index) were higher in the esmolol group for the first hour post-CPB (P < 0.05). Systemic arterial lactate and coronary sinus lactate were lower in the esmolol group after CPB (P < 0.05), but myocardial lactate extraction was not significantly different between groups. After CPB, hemoglobin was lower in the esmolol group (P < 0.05) due to longer CPB and aortic cross-clamp time (P < 0.05), but oxygen consumption was less than in the control group (P < 0.05). Post-CPB serum potassium was higher in the esmolol group (P < 0.05). Results are confounded by more chronically beta-adrenergically blocked patients randomized to the esmolol group (P < 0.05).

Platelet aggregability was measured by filtragometry ex vivo, which reflects platelet aggregability in vivo and by Born aggregometry in vitro. Platelet secretion in vivo was assessed by measurements of beta-thromboglobulin in plasma. Verapamil reduced plasma norepinephrine levels (from 2.6 +/- 1.0 to 2.2 +/- 1.0 nmol/L; p < 0.01) and attenuated platelet aggregability at rest (filtragometry readings were prolonged from 219 to 295 seconds; p < 0.05, n = 46). Aggregability in platelet-rich plasma was not influenced. Metoprolol did not significantly affect filtragometry readings (n = 58) or aggregability in vitro (there was a tendency toward enhanced adenosine diphosphate sensitivity; p = 0.08). beta-thromboglobulin levels were low (approximately 25 ng/ml) and not influenced by either treatment. Physical exercise (bicycle ergometry) increased platelet aggregability in vivo both before and after drug treatment. Verapamil also attenuated platelet aggregability after exercise, whereas metoprolol had no such effect. Platelet function was not seriously altered by mental stress (Stroop's color word test) despite significant effects on hemodynamics and plasma catecholamines either before or after treatment with either drug. Thus, verapamil attenuates platelet aggregability in patients with stable angina pectoris, whereas metoprolol has no such effect.",

Bisoprolol reduced the heart rate at onset of episodes by 13.7 +/- 1.4 beats/min from a baseline value of 99.5 +/- 1.2 beats/min (p < 0.001). Heart rate was unchanged with nifedipine. Bisoprolol had significantly higher responder rates than nifedipine. Doubling of the dose in phase 2 of the trial had small additive effects. Only bisoprolol showed a marked circadian effect by reducing the morning peak of transient ischemic episodes (by 68% at peak time, 8:00 to 8:59 AM).",

    "103": "We retrospectively examined baseline characteristics of 24 patients who underwent double-blind then open-label treatment with metoprolol to determine which characteristic predicted improvement in systolic and diastolic function. Degree of improvement in systolic function (22 patients) was defined by the change in left ventricular ejection fraction after 3 months of therapy. Degree of improvement in diastolic function (15 patients) was defined as the change in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and change in the slope of the isovolumetric relaxation rate-end-systolic pressure relation.",

Stepwise logistic regression demonstrated that only peak systolic pressure was an independent predictor of systolic improvement. Baseline heart rate, ventricular volumes, ejection fraction and adrenergic activation, as reflected by coronary sinus norepinephrine, did not predict response. Patients with the most diastolic impairment at baseline had the most favorable diastolic improvement. Those with the lowest myocardial respiratory quotient (most fatty acid utilization) at baseline also had the most marked reduction in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure.",

    "108": "To compare the efficacy of propafenone to atenolol in the prevention of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias (SVT) following cardiac surgery, 207 consecutive patients were randomly allocated to receive either propafenone 300 mg twice daily (105 patients) or atenolol 50 mg once daily (102 patients) orally for 7 days after operation. Double blinding was achieved using placebos. The end point was the development of a SVT which was symptomatic, recurrent, or lasting over 2 minutes, or the occurrence of adverse effects possibly attributable to the drugs. The groups were well matched for age, sex, bypass- and cross-clamp times, and other data. Thirteen patients in the propafenone group and 11 in the atenolol group developed SVT during the first week after operation. (P = 0.89, non significant, chi-squared with Yates' correction). In our study propafenone and atenolol were of approximately equal efficacy in preventing post cardiotomy SVT. Propafenone may have an advantage in being less negatively inotropic than atenolol; it could therefore be used in patients with poor left ventricular function or marginal haemodynamics when a beta blocker is contraindicated.", 
    "109": "Generalized and specific social phobias are common, chronic, and potentially debilitating conditions. In recent years, there have been major advances in the pharmacotherapy of social phobia; efficacy has become better established for a diverse group of medications. Controlled studies have shown substantial benefit from monamine oxidase inhibitors, both irreversible (phenelzine) and reversible (brofaromine and moclobemide). The serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor antidepressants have shown promise in case reports, uncontrolled studies, and double-blind trials (fluvoxamine and sertraline). The benzodiazepines have been extensively used to treat social phobia, although only recently has a controlled, double-blind study confirmed efficacy (clonazepam). The beta-adrenergic receptor blockers have been widely used on an as needed basis to treat specific social phobia (i.e., performance anxiety), although their value in generalized social phobia has not been convincing. Finally, pharmacologic approaches to social phobia must take into consideration the common coexistence of other psychiatric conditions.", 
    "110": "To understand the pathophysiology of diseased hearts, we devised a new regional myocardial function curve and investigated its properties. Regional work per unit volume of the myocardium (RWM) was calculated by integrating mean wall stress (sigma) with respect to the natural logarithm of the reciprocal of wall thickness [ln(1/H)] over a cardiac cycle. Regarding the end-diastolic ln(1/H) as the preload for the region of concern on the assumption that the myocardium is incompressible, we defined the relation between RWM and end-diastolic ln(1/H) as the regional myocardial function curve. In ten mongrel dogs, we measured left ventricular pressure, left ventricular internal diameter, and wall thickness with a catheter-tip micromanometer and ultrasonic dimension gauges during volume loading to obtain the regional myocardial function curve. We examined the sensitivity of the regional myocardial function curve to changes in contractile state (isoproterenol, propranolol) and changes in afterload (pressure loading by a balloon-occlusion catheter). The linear fit to the data points of the regional myocardial function curve under each condition always achieved a very good correlation coefficient (greater than 0.62). Isoproterenol increased the slope of the regional myocardial function curve from 9.7 +/- 0.9 (SEM) mJ/cm3 to 14.4 +/- 1.0 mJ/cm3 (P < 0.01), with no significant changes in the x-intercept, while propranolol decreased it to 5.6 +/- 1.2 mJ/cm3 (P < 0.01) with no significant changes in the x-intercept.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

It was demonstrated that the dynamics of the discharge activity of the neurons at particular stages of the behavioral act exhibited a contradictory character when neuromediators and their antagonists were applied. At the same time, differences in the impulse activity were more pronounced against the background of the application of propranolol and atropine than of norepinephrine and acetylcholine.", 
    "113": "The past 2 decades have witnessed an upsurge in the interest in anxiety disorders. Much research effort has been dedicated to panic disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. However, it is only very recently that we have begun to understand some of the basic principles about the psychopharmacology of social phobia. Drug classes thus far studied include beta-blockers, nonselective and irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and benzodiazepines. Beta blockers appear to be of use in specific social phobias, such as public speaking, whereas they are of little use in generalized social phobia. There is considerable evidence suggesting that MAOIs are effective in reducing both social anxiety as well as social avoidance in generalized social phobia. A disadvantage of the conventional irreversible MAOIs is their risk for hypertensive crises when combined with dietary tyramine. Thus far only a small number of studies with selective MAO-A inhibitors, such as moclobemide and brofaromine, have been conducted in social phobia, and the results indicate that both compounds are effective. Drugs exerting selective and specific actions on certain components of, for example, the serotonergic system, can now be studied, and it is hoped that the role of 5-hydroxytryptamine) and other neuronal systems in social phobia can be elucidated. In order to gain more information about selective serotonergic drugs, the first double-blind placebo-controlled study with fluvoxamine was recently published. Preliminary results indicate a reduction in social anxiety after a prolonged treatment period. Finally, the role of peptides in the treatment of social phobia is critically reviewed.

Using standard polysomnography, individuals were classified as either apneic (n = 15) or mild to nonapneic (n = 15) according to their respiratory disturbance index (RDI). Subjects were similar in terms of sodium excretion and blood pressure. Apneic subjects showed a decrease in beta 2-adrenergic receptor sensitivity (p = 0.01) [as determined by isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) production in lymphocytes] and an increased binding affinity to the beta receptor antagonist [125I]iodopindolol (p < 0.001). beta receptor density was also diminished in apneics, but not significantly (p = 0.08). Forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP was not significantly different between the groups, indicating a similarity in postreceptor Gs-adenylate cyclase activation. Across all subjects, RDI was negatively correlated with beta receptor sensitivity (r = -0.35, p = 0.05) and Kd (r = -0.54, p < 0.01) and positively correlated with systolic blood pressure (r = 0.37, p < 0.05). The findings indicate that sleep apnea is associated with a diminished beta 2-adrenergic receptor function but no change in postreceptor components and suggest a mechanism for the high comorbidity between sleep apnea and hypertension.",

The interaction of the expressed calcium channel with the non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker Ro 40-5967 was studied. Ro 40-5967 decreased isradipine binding by an apparent allosteric interaction and blocked the barium inward currents (IBa) in a voltage- and use-dependent manner in all cells. The steady-state inactivation curves were shifted to hyperpolarizing potentials in the presence of Ro 40-5967. The rate of channel inactivation was increased in CHO alpha 1 and CHO alpha 1 beta 3 cells. The shift in the steady-state inactivation curve and the increase in channel inactivation were less pronounced in CHO alpha 1 beta 1 cells than in the other cell lines. Low concentrations of Ro 40-5967 increased IBa by up to 198% in 33% of the CHO alpha 1 beta 1 cells. In addition, higher concentrations of Ro 40-5967 were required to inhibit IBa in 60% of the CHO alpha 1 beta 3 cells. These results suggest that the beta subunits modify the interaction of the non-dihydropyridine Ro 40-5967 with the expressed calcium channel alpha 1 subunit.", 
    "120": "Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade reduces the mortality rate after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in humans. However, the effects of beta blockade on left ventricular remodeling remain unknown. Therefore, in the present study we investigated the effect of prolonged beta-adrenergic receptor blockade with atenolol on left ventricular remodeling following AMI in rats. Myocardial infarction (MI) was produced in Wistar-Kyoto rats by ligating the coronary artery. Four groups of rats were studied: sham-operated (n = 10); atenolol (1 g/l in drinking water) treated sham-operated (n = 8); untreated MI (n = 11); atenolol treated MI (n = 10). Hemodynamic measurements were made about 3 weeks after the operation. Infarct size was similar in treated and untreated MI rats (31.2 +/- 2.5% cf. 33.5 +/- 2.0%). MI rats were characterized by increases in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), right atrial pressure (RAP), right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP), and left ventricular end-diastolic volume index (LVEDVI), as compared with sham-operated rats. In sham-operated rats, prolonged beta-adrenergic receptor blockade produced only a reduced HR. Atenolol-treated MI rats had a significantly higher LVEDP, RAP and LVEDVI than did rats with untreated MI. Prolonged beta-adrenergic receptor blockade with atenolol appeared to promote left ventricular remodeling after AMI. Thus, the treatment of AMI with beta-adrenergic receptor blockade in the clinical setting should be evaluated with respect to ventricular remodeling during prolonged therapy.", 
    "121": "Acute myocardial ischemia leads to a rapid increase of cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors in plasma membranes despite the release of large and desensitizing amounts of endogenous catecholamines. Part of this increase has been shown to occur at the expense of intracellular receptors. To investigate whether an additional expressional regulation of beta-adrenergic receptors due to an increase of mRNA levels is involved, the mRNA levels specific for beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors were determined after various periods of global ischemia in isolated perfused rat hearts. The subtype-specific quantification of mRNA for beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors was determined using reverse-transcription followed by PCR (RT-PCR) and RNA protection assays. RT-PCR resulted in single amplification products of the expected sizes (159 bp for beta 1-adrenergic receptors and 240 bp for beta 2-adrenergic receptors). The specificity of these amplification products was confirmed by specific restriction digests. Southern blot hybridizations with internal oligonucleotides and sequencing using the dideoxy chain termination method. For quantification purposes, the mRNAs of housekeeping gene GAPDH and of cardiac alpha-actin were determined as internal standards. Additionally, cRNAs specific for beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors were used as external standards. Brief periods of global ischemia induced a rapid increase in the steady state level of mRNA for beta 1-adrenergic receptors. There was a statistically significant rise already after 15 min by 57% compared to controls. After 30 min of ischemia the mRNA levels had almost doubled. After 60 min of ischemia, the mRNA levels specific for beta 1-adrenergic receptors tended to decrease, but remained significantly above normoxic controls. In contrast, the mRNA levels specific for beta 2-adrenergic receptors remained constant up to 60 min of global myocardial ischemia. To investigate, whether agonist occupancy of the receptors may contribute to this regulation, the effect of preperfusion with the beta-blocker alprenolol was determined. Contrary to expectation, beta-blockade did not influence the ischemia-induced increase of mRNA levels specific for beta 1-adrenergic receptors. These data demonstrate for the first time, that acute myocardial ischemia induces a rapid, and subtype-selective regulation of mRNA levels for beta 1-adrenergic receptors. However, occupation or activation of beta-adrenergic receptors by an agonist is not involved in this newly characterized regulation of mRNA for beta 1-adrenergic receptors in acute myocardial ischemia.", 
    "122": "It was previously shown in rats that administration of cocaine or d-amphetamine in moderate doses produced alterations in EEG characteristic for activation of D1 dopamine receptors, whereas large doses induced alterations resembling activation of D2 dopamine receptors. Since morphine, among other effects, enhances the dopaminergic transmission, it was investigated whether this effect might be apparent in the EEG which was recorded telemetrically in awake, not restrained rats. In a moderate dose (3 mg/kg IP), morphine produced a desynchronisation and a general decrease of power in all of the frequency bands except beta-2. This effect was antagonized by naloxone (0.5 mg/kg IP) but only in part by the blocker of D1 receptors SCH 23390 (0.2 mg/kg IP) and not by haloperidol in a dose which mainly blocks D2 receptors (0.1 mg/kg IP). The dose of morphine used (3 mg/kg IP) produced only slight signs of behavioural activation. The results suggest that the decrease in power observed after this dose of morphine was only in part due to an activation of dopaminergic mechanisms via D1 receptors and partly must be explained by other actions of morphine. A large dose of morphine (15 mg/kg IP) at the beginning produced catalepsy and muscular rigidity and subsequent behavioural activation; in the EEG during both behavioural phases a general increase in power in all of the frequency bands was observed which was most pronounced in the alpha-2 band (9.75-12.50 Hz).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "123": "Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the most common cause of death in Western industrialized countries. CHD is more common in individuals with clustering of coronary risk factors, e.g., hypertension and blood lipid abnormalities. There is a good rationale for the use of beta-blockers for prevention of myocardial infarction (MI) in high-risk groups, as beta-blockade decreases myocardial oxygen consumption and, by decreasing turbulent blood flow patterns, reduces endothelial shear forces, thus making plaque rupture (and the ensuing thrombotic events) less likely. Clinical trial data have shown beta-blockade to be effective in the prevention of cardiovascular end points. In both younger and older hypertensive patients there is a significant reduction in the incidence of stroke and in younger hypertensive patients there is about a 15% reduction in MI. Left ventricular hypertrophy (particularly by ECG) is significantly diminished. In secondary prevention of MI there is about 15% reduction after early and 25-30% reduction after late intervention with beta-blockers given post-MI. In both stable and unstable angina, beta-blockade appears to be beneficial not only in improvement of symptoms but also in prevention of hard cardiovascular end points. There are also promising data suggesting that beta-blockade is useful in endothelial protection and atheroma prevention, and benefits patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and heart failure. beta-Blockers have evolved from early nonselective agents, e.g., propranolol, to modern highly beta 1-selective agents, e.g., bisoprolol. beta 1-Blockade is the essential element that leads to the above cardiovascular benefits in addition to improving the quality of life (similar to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors).", 
    "124": "The use of antihypertensive agents in patients with renal insufficiency necessitates careful consideration of dosages, titration, and monitoring. Renal function must be estimated to appropriately make dosage adjustments for antihypertensives that exhibit extensive renal elimination. Thiazide diuretics are useful in mild degrees of renal insufficiency but loop diuretics become necessary as renal function deteriorates further. With either class, low dosages should be used to prevent hypovolemia, hyponatremia, and hypokalemia which may worsen renal blood flow. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have become popular because they may have unique renal protective properties. All ACE inhibitors except fosinopril require reduced dosages and/or less frequent administration in patients with renal insufficiency. It is often necessary to use a diuretic with an ACE inhibitor and special dosing considerations are important. Due to demographic and physiologic characteristics of patients with renal insufficiency, beta blockers are often reserved for patients with other indications for beta blockers such as ischemic heart disease. Several beta blockers are eliminated primarily by the kidney and dosage reductions are necessary for these agents. Calcium antagonists may also have renal protective effects. Because calcium antagonists are metabolized extensively, significant dosage adjustments are not necessary. Data suggest that antihypertensives may slow the decline in renal insufficiency. The pharmacokinetics of several antihypertensives change with renal impairment because of reduced elimination. Therefore, dosage adjustments, slower titration, and less frequent administration are often necessary.", 
    "125": "Prenatal alcohol exposure delays the development of thermoregulation in newborn rats. Newborns generate heat by the sympathetic nervous system's activation of nonshivering thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT). In this study, the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the development of the beta-adrenergic receptor system of BAT was investigated by assessing the number and pharmacological properties of beta-adrenergic receptors in BAT in 1-, 5-, 10-, and 20-day-old offspring. Pregnant dams were given either a liquid diet with 35% of the calories derived from alcohol, a liquid diet without alcohol for any effects of the liquid diet administration, or ad lib food and water. Offspring from the alcohol prenatal treatment group had a greater number of beta 1 adrenergic receptors compared to offspring from both from the pair-fed and lab chow control groups, which did not differ from each other. The greater number of receptor sites in 5-day-old subjects suggests that the number of binding sites in alcohol-exposed BAT cells continues to rise due to the absence of sufficient neurotransmitter, and perhaps reflects a delay in the arrival of sympathetic nervous system neurons. During the second and third postnatal weeks, when NE concentrations are rising and reaching asymptotic levels, the number of beta 1 adrenergic receptors in BAT of control subjects is decreasing. This expected compensatory \"downregulation\" response in receptor concentration was not seen in BAT from subjects exposed to alcohol prenatally. These findings may have important implications for understanding the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on developing plasticity in the peripheral nervous system.", 
    "126": "The principle functions of the heart are to accept blood from the systemic and the pulmonary circulatory system, pump and deliver it to the whole body tissues and lungs. The term \"heart failure\" is used to describe the pathophysiological state in which an abnormality of cardiac function is responsible for failure of the heart to pump blood at a rate commensurate with the requirements of the metabolizing tissues, or to do so only from an elevated filling pressure. Thus, for a long period, heart failure has been thought of as a mechanical disorder of the heart and vessels, and its treatment has been based on improving impaired cardiac function and hemodynamic disorder. Recently multi-center, randomized placebo-controlled survival trials revealed that pure inotropic agents such as phosphodiesterase inhibitors succeeded in mechanical improvement, yet not only failed to prolong the patient's life, but also increased mortality. A number of neurohumoral mechanisms, which are activated in heart failure, were thought to be compensatory ones. However, survival trials demonstrated that two types of drug interfering with the renin-angiotensin system and the sympathetic nervous system reduced mortality. Those drugs are angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta blockers. ACE inhibitors reduce the direct effects of angiotensin II on myocardial cells, which may lead to cell necrosis, imbalanced remodeling through fibrosis, and attenuate the progressive ventricular dilatation. Local tissue renin-angiotensin system may be potentially important in regulating the angiotensin II production in both heart and vessels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
