Polyethylene oxide (PEO 100K, 1M and 7M) was used as swelling agent and metoprolol tartrate (MPT) as model drug. The processability via HME and drug release profiles of EVA/MPT/PEO formulations were assessed. Solid state characteristics, porosity and polymer miscibility of EVA/PEO matrices were evaluated by means of DSC, X-ray tomography and Raman spectroscopy. The processability via HME varied according to the VA content: EVA 40 and 28 were extruded at 90\u00b0C, whereas higher viscosity EVA grades (EVA 15 and 9) required a minimum extrusion temperature of 110\u00b0C to obtain high-quality extrudates. Drug release from EVA matrices depended on the VA content, PEO molecular weight and PEO content, matrix porosity as well as pore size distribution. Interestingly, the interplay of PEO leaching, matrix swelling, water influx and changes in matrix porosity influenced drug release: EVA 40- and 28-based matrices extruded with PEO of higher MW accelerated drug release, whereas for EVA 15- and 9-based matrices, drug release slowed down. These differences were related to the distinct polymer flexibility imposed by the VA content (lower VA content presents higher crystallinity and less free movement of the amorphous segments resulting in a higher rigidity). In all cases, diffusional mass transport seems to play a major role, as demonstrated by mathematical modeling using an analytical solution of Fick's second law. The bioavailability of EVA 40 and 28 matrices in dogs was not significantly different, independent of PEO 7M concentration.",

Although dopamine deregulation has been observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, the dysfunction of this neurotransmitter has not been investigated in animal models of AD. The aim of this study was to assess, by in vivo microdialysis, cortical and hippocampal dopamine, norepinephrine, and glutamate release during the acquisition of object recognition memory (ORM) in 5- and 10-mo-old triple-transgenic Alzheimer's disease mice (3xTg-AD) and to relate the extracellular changes to 24-h memory performance. Five- and 10-mo-old wild-type mice and 5-mo-old 3xTg-AD showed significant cortical but not hippocampal dopamine increase during object exploration. On a 24-h ORM test, these three groups displayed significant ORM. In contrast, 10-mo-old 3xTg-AD mice showed impaired dopamine release in the insular cortex during ORM acquisition, as well as significant impairment in ORM. In addition, cortical administration of a dopamine reuptake blocker produced an increase of dopamine levels in the 10-mo-old 3xTg-AD mice and attenuated the memory impairment. These data suggest that activation of the dopaminergic system in the insular cortex is involved in object recognition memory, and that dysfunction of this system contributes to the age-related decline in cognitive functioning of the 3xTg-AD mice.",

Potent analogs of \u03b1-MSH, [Nle(4), D-Phe(7)]-\u03b1-MSH (NDP-\u03b1-MSH) and melanotan-II (MT-II), are widely used in pharmacological studies, but the hemodynamic effects associated with their systemic administration have not been thoroughly examined. Therefore, we investigated the hemodynamic actions of these compounds in anesthetized and conscious C57Bl/6N mice using peripheral routes of administration. NDP-\u03b1-MSH and MT-II induced mild changes in blood pressure and heart rate in anesthetized mice compared to the effects observed in conscious mice, suggesting that anesthesia distorts the hemodynamic actions of \u03b1-MSH analogs. In conscious mice, NDP-\u03b1-MSH and MT-II increased blood pressure and heart rate in a dose-dependent manner, but the tachycardic effect was more prominent than the pressor effect. Pretreatment with the melanocortin (MC) 3/4 receptor antagonist SHU9119 abolished these hemodynamic effects. Furthermore, the blockade of \u03b2(1)-adrenoceptors with metoprolol prevented the pressor effect and partly the tachycardic action of \u03b1-MSH analogs, while the ganglionic blocker hexamethonium abrogated completely the difference in heart rate between vehicle and \u03b1-MSH treatments. These findings suggest that the pressor effect is primarily caused by augmentation of cardiac sympathetic activity, but the tachycardic effect seems to involve withdrawal of vagal tone in addition to sympathetic activation. In conclusion, the present results indicate that systemic administration of \u03b1-MSH analogs elevates blood pressure and heart rate via activation of MC(3/4) receptor pathways. These effects and the consequent increase in cardiac workload should be taken into account when using \u03b1-MSH analogs via peripheral routes of administration.",

A previous microarray study reported that this gene is expressed by estrogen treatment in breast cancer. In this study, we examined the regulatory mechanisms and biological functions of estrogen-induced B4GALT1 expression. Our data showed that estrogen-induced expression of B4GALT1 is localized in intracellular compartments and in the plasma membrane. In addition, B4GALT1 has an enzyme activity involved in the production of the Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc structure. The result from a promoter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that 3 different estrogen response elements (EREs) in the B4GALT1 promoter are critical for responsiveness to estrogen. In addition, the estrogen antagonists ICI 182,780 and ER-\u03b1-ERE binding blocker TPBM inhibit the expression of estrogen-induced B4GALT1. However, the inhibition of signal molecules relating to the extra-nuclear pathway, including the G-protein coupled receptors, Ras, and mitogen-activated protein kinases, had no inhibitory effects on B4GALT1 expression. The knock-down of the B4GALT1 gene and the inhibition of membrane B4GALT1 function resulted in the significant inhibition of estrogen-induced proliferation of MCF-7 cells. Considering these results, we propose that estrogen regulates the expression of B4GALT1 through the direct binding of ER-\u03b1 to ERE and that the expressed B4GALT1 plays a crucial role in the proliferation of MCF-7 cells through its activity as a membrane receptor.", 
    "30": "Carvedilol (CVL), a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor, is insoluble under physiological conditions and hence its oral administration is difficult. Bile salts are widely used as drug delivery media for many hydrophobic drugs. CVL has a strong intrinsic fluorescence with a carbazole moiety. When excited at 320 nm, it exhibits dual emission at 347 and 357 nm. As the concentration of bile salt is increased there is an overall increase in the fluorescence intensity and also the ratio of the intensities at 347 and 357 nm (I(1)/I(2)) increases. This indicates that the CVL molecule can sense the non-polar nature of bile salts with increasing concentrations. It is showed that the new parameter (I(1)/I(2)) can be used as an indicative tool in determining the polarity of the medium. The increase in fluorescence anisotropy and fluorescence lifetimes is observed, indicating the micro-heterogeneity of the bile salt solutions as experienced by CVL molecules. The possibility of electrostatic interactions between CVL and bile salt micelles is ruled out in view of the results obtained here and their interaction is purely hydrophobic in nature. The results suggest that the CVL molecule associates with the steroidal moiety of bile salts through its carbazole moiety.",

Activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and sympathoadrenal system (SAS) with the release of cortisol and catecholamines appear to be responsible for altering the Th1/Th2 balance. Decreased expression and signalling of interleukin-12 (IL-12) and increased expression of T regulatory cells (Tregs) appear to play a central role in mediating this immune depression. Furthermore, Th2 cytokines increase the expression of arginase-1 (ARG1) in myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC's) causing an arginine deficient state, which further impairs lymphocyte function. Immunomodulating diets (IMDs) containing supplemental arginine and omega-3 fatty acids have been demonstrated to restore the Th1/Th2 balance after surgical trauma and to reduce the risk of infectious complications. \u03b2-adrenergic receptor blockage reverses the Th-1 to Th2 shift and preliminary data suggests that such therapy may be beneficial.",

Activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) exerts multiple effects on neural integration in dLGN; however, their direct influence on the primary sensory input, namely retinogeniculate afferents, is unknown. In the present study, we found that pharmacological or synaptic activation of type 1 mGluRs (mGluR(1)s) significantly depresses glutamatergic retinogeniculate excitation in rat thalamocortical neurons. Pharmacological activation of mGluR(1)s attenuates excitatory synaptic responses in thalamocortical neurons at a magnitude sufficient to decrease suprathreshold output of these neurons. The reduction in both NMDA and AMPA receptor-dependent synaptic responses results from a presynaptic reduction in glutamate release from retinogeniculate terminals. The suppression of retinogeniculate synaptic transmission and dampening of thalamocortical output was mimicked by tetanic activation of retinogeniculate afferent in a frequency-dependent manner that activated mGluR(1)s. Retinogeniculate excitatory synaptic transmission was also suppressed by the glutamate transport blocker TBOA (dl-threo-\u03b2-benzyloxyaspartic acid), suggesting that mGluR(1)s were activated by glutamate spillover. The data indicate that presynaptic mGluR(1) contributes to an activity-dependent mechanism that regulates retinogeniculate excitation and therefore plays a significant role in the thalamic gating of visual information.",

METHODS: Young Zucker obese (ZO) rats, a rodent model for overnutrition, and age-matched Zucker lean rats were treated with nebivolol (10 mg/kg/day; 21 days) and cardiac function was monitored by echocardiography and pressure volume loop analysis. Activation status of nutrient sensor serine/threonine kinases mammalian target for rapamycin (mTOR), and p70 S6kinase (S6K1) and S6K1-substrate RPS6, inflammatory marker Janus kinase 2 (Jak2) and its substrate STAT1, and energy sensor AMP-dependent kinase (AMPK) were monitored by determining phosphorylation status of pSer(2448) of mTOR, pThr(389) of S6K1, pSer(235/236) of RPS6, pTyr(1007/1008) of Jak2, pTyr(701) of STAT1, and pThr(172) of AMPK, respectively. RESULTS: Nebivolol reduced weight and improved cardiac function of ZO rats as shown by improvements in the myocardial performance index and a decrease in the diastolic parameter tau (\u03c4), the time constant of isovolumic relaxation. Nebivolol also attenuated excessive activation of the nutrient sensor kinases mTOR and S6K1 and their substrate RPS6 as well as the inflammatory marker Jak2 and substrate STAT1 in ZO myocardium (p < 0.05). Moreover, nebivolol reversed suppression of the energy sensor kinase AMPK in ZO hearts (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: We report for the first time that nebivolol regulates overnutrition-induced activation of cardiac mTOR and Jak/STAT signaling and reverses suppression of AMPK. Since it also suppresses weight gain, nebivolol appears effective in the treatment of overnutrition-related cardiac inflammation and diastolic dysfunction.",

All events were centrally adjudicated. Documented CAD was present in 2353 patients (57%). Patients with CAD were older and had more co-morbidities compared with those without CAD. Patients with CAD were more likely to receive a beta-blocker, but less likely to receive an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or aldosterone antagonist (P < 0.01). After risk adjustment, patients with documented CAD had similar mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97-1.30], but were at an increased risk for CV mortality/HF hospitalization (HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.12-1.41) due to an increased risk for HF hospitalization (HR 1.26, 95% CI 1.10-1.44).

The influence of process temperature; matrix composition; drug load, plasticizer level; and salt form of metoprolol: tartrate (MPT), fumarate (MPF) and succinate (MPS) on ease of processing and drug release were evaluated. Formulations composed of 70/30% Eudragit RL/MPT showed the fastest drug release, substituting part of Eudragit RL by RS resulted in slower drug release, all following first-order release kinetics. Drug load only affected drug release of matrices composed of Eudragit RS: a higher MPT concentration yielded faster release rates. Adding triethyl citrate enhanced the processability, but was detrimental to long-term stability. The process temperature and plasticizer level had no effect on drug release, whereas metoprolol salt form significantly influenced release properties. The moulded tablets had a low porosity and a smooth surface morphology. A plasticizing effect of MPT, MPS and MPF on Eudragit RS and Eudragit RL was observed via DSC and DMA. Solubility parameter assessment, thermal analysis and X-ray diffraction demonstrated the formation of a solid solution immediately after production, in which H-bonds were formed between metoprolol and Eudragit as evidenced by near-infrared spectroscopy. However, high drug loadings of MPS and MPF showed a tendency to recrystallise during storage. The in vivo performance of injection-moulded tablets was strongly dependent upon drug loading.",

Nevertheless, there is no standard treatment protocol for the dose and duration of GCSs. Long-term treatment with GCSs is associated with unwanted side effects such as growth suppression, behavioral changes, and reflux.

Two blinded investigators independently interpreted therapy results using the Hemangioma Activity Score (HAS). Side effects were determined according to reports in patient charts and parental questionnaires. The median duration of a short course of GCSs was 2 weeks (range 1-6 weeks). The number of courses was 2 (range 1-5). The median cumulative dose was 91 mg/kg. Growth stabilized in all patients, with a good response (>50% reduction in HAS) in 62% and a favorable response (30-50% reduction is HAS) in 23%. Twelve of the 21 children (57%) had minor side effects. Persistent side effects did not occur.

    "156": "We proposed that the higher incidence of sleep fragmentation, sympathovagal imbalance and baroreceptor reflex impairment during quiet sleep may play a critical role in late-sleep-related cardiovascular events. Polysomnographic recording was performed through wireless transmission using freely moving Wistar-Kyoto rats over 24 h. The low-frequency power of arterial pressure variability was quantified to provide an index of vascular sympathetic activity. Spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity was assessed by slope of arterial pressure-RR linear regression. As compared with early-light period (Zeitgeber time 0-6 h), rats during the late-light period (Zeitgeber time 6-12 h) showed lower accumulated quiet sleep time and higher paradoxical sleep time; furthermore, during quiet sleep, the rats showed a lower \u03b4% of electroencephalogram, more incidents of interruptions, higher \u03c3% and higher \u03b2% of electroencephalogram, raised low-frequency power of arterial pressure variability value and lower baroreflex sensitivity parameters. During the light period, low-frequency power of arterial pressure variability during quiet sleep had a negative correlation with accumulated quiet sleep time and \u03b4% of electroencephalogram, while it also had a positive correlation with \u03c3% and \u03b2% of electroencephalogram and interruption events. However, late-sleep-related raised sympathetic activity and sleep fragmentation diminished when an \u03b11-adrenoceptor antagonist was given to the rats. Our results suggest that the higher incidence of sleep fragmentation and sympathovagal imbalance during quiet sleep may play a critical role in late-sleep-related cardiovascular events. Such sleep fragmentation is coincident with an impairment of baroreflex sensitivity, and is mediated via \u03b11-adernoceptors.",

Management of HCM in general and HOCM in particular encompasses (1) activity restriction with avoidance of volume depletion, (2) prevention of sudden cardiac death, (3) control of symptoms, and (4) screening of relatives. Those patients at high risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) should be offered an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). Pharmacologic treatment of symptoms in patients with HOCM consists of negative inotropic drugs, namely beta blockers, and disopyramide; a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB), usually verapamil, may be used in patients with noncardiac side-effects of beta blockers. Patients who have a dual-chamber pacemaker (PM) or ICD should undergo a trial of pacing with short atrioventricular (AV) delay. For patients with intolerable symptoms despite optimal conservative therapy, septal reduction therapy (SRT) should be considered and should be performed by experienced operators in institutions with multidisciplinary HCM programs. Younger patients with extreme hypertrophy are usually offered septal myectomy, while older patients, and those with important comorbidities are usually directed to alcohol septal ablation (ASA). For patients for whom either therapy is appropriate, there should be a balanced discussion with the patients of the benefits and risks of the 2 procedures.",

The immunosensor was fabricated by modification of the screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCE) with nanocomposites made by skillful doping of bovine serum albumin conjugated chlorpyrifos-methyl antigen (BSA-Ag) and platinum colloid into silica sol-gel. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images and electrochemical measurements showed that platinum colloid domains in the nanocomposite material could enhance electron transfer and change the brittleness of the silica sol-gel. The immobilisation of BSA-Ag on the nanocomposite retained its immunoactivities, which allowed the immobilised BSA-Ag to effectively capture unbound Ab-HRP in the detection solution. A linear response to CM concentration was exhibited, ranging from 0.4 to 20ng/mL. Detection of CM with the presented method in soil or grape samples treated with CM matched the reference values well, which indicated that the proposed disposable immunosensor hold promising applications in environmental and food monitoring.", 
    "162": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common manifestation of symptomatic atherosclerosis that leads to a significantly elevated risk of cardiovascular events, including major limb loss, myocardial infarction, stroke and death. The prevalence proportions of PAD increase dramatically with age and appear to progress more aggressively in women than in men. Several studies have indicated that the use of secondary medical prevention is generally insufficient among PAD patients. However, current national and international guidelines recommend lipid-lowering and anti-platelet therapy, supplemented with aggressive blood pressure lowering treatment. We aimed to determine whether there were age-, gender-, geography or time related differences in the use of secondary medical prevention, following primary vascular reconstruction. We also sought to describe the prognoses for the same population, according to the association between the use of ACE/ATII inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists) or beta blockers and clinical outcomes (all cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, major amputation and/or recurrent vascular surgery) in a population-based, long-term follow-up study. We established a data base by linking four population based administrative and health-care registries. All Danish patients undergoing primary vascular surgical reconstruction due to atherosclerotic disease between 1997 and 2007 were included and identified in the Danish Vascular Registry; a total of 20,761 patients were followed during a median of 582 days (range of 30 to 4,379 days). Data regarding all prescriptions filled by the study population were obtained from the Medical Registry of the Danish Medicines Agency. Study I: Age- and gender-related differences. We found moderate to low use of secondary medical prevention. However, this use has increased in recent years and the age- and gender-related differences in use have been reduced or eliminated. Study II: Geographic or time related differences. The use of evidence-based secondary medical prevention, especially lipid-lowering drugs, increased substantially over time, regardless of socio-demographic and clinical factors. No substantial differences in pharmacological use according to location of residence were observed. Study III: Use of ACE/ATII and prognosis. We found the use of ACE inhibitors to be associated with lower all cause mortality but also an increased long-term risk of recurrent vascular reconstruction and myocardial infarction. Study IV: Use of beta blockers and prognosis. We found beta blocker use to be associated with a lower risk of major amputation, but also an increased risk of new myocardial infarction and stroke. No association were found regarding all cause mortality or the risk of recurrent vascular surgery. In conclusion, the use of secondary medical prevention following primary vascular surgery (between 1996 and 2006 in Denmark) shifted towards a more evidence-based treatment, as reduction in age-, gender- and geography related differences were observed early in the study period. However, recommendations for the current clinical guidelines suggest that additional improvement can be made. The treatment of hypertension in PAD patients is complex, and our results are also complex but indicate that ACE/ATII and beta blockers are safe for use in symptomatic PAD patients.",

    "164": "Oxidative stress has been paid increasing attention to as an important causative factor for diabetic vascular complications. Among possible various sources, accumulating evidence has indicated that NAD(P)H oxidase may be the most important source for reactive oxygen species production in diabetic vascular tissues. The mechanisms underlying activation and up-regulation of NAD(P)H oxidase has been supposed to be mediated by high glucose-induced protein kinase C (PKC) activation. In this review article, activation of local renin-angiotensin II system induced by chymase activation is also shown to amplify such a PKC-dependent activation of NAD(P)H oxidase. Additionally, human evidence showing the beneficial effect of antioxidants on diabetic vascular complications. Bilirubin has been recognized as a strong endogenous antioxidant. Here markedly lower prevalence of vascular complications is shown in diabetic patients with Gilbert syndrome, a congenital hyperbilirubinemia, as well as reduced markers of oxidative stress and inflammation. Lastly, statin, angiotensin II receptor blocker, chymase inhibitor, bilirubin and biliverdin, PKC \u03b2 isoform inhibitor, and glucagon-like peptide-1 analog, are shown to serve as antioxidants and have some beneficial effect on diabetic vascular complications, via inhibiting PKC-NAD(P)H oxidase activation, supporting the notion that this mechanism may be an effective therapeutic target for preventing diabetic vascular complications.", 
    "165": "G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) are important regulatory proteins for many G protein-coupled receptors, but little is known about GRK4 pharmacogenetics. We hypothesized that 3 nonsynonymous GRK4 single-nucleotide polymorphisms, R65L (rs2960306), A142V (rs1024323), and A486V (rs1801058), would be associated with blood pressure response to atenolol, but not hydrochlorothiazide, and would be associated with long-term cardiovascular outcomes (all-cause death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke) in participants treated with an atenolol-based versus verapamil-SR-based antihypertensive strategy. GRK4 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped in 768 hypertensive participants from the Pharmacogenomic Evaluation of Antihypertensive Responses (PEAR) trial. In whites and blacks, increasing copies of the variant 65L-142V haplotype were associated with significantly reduced atenolol-induced diastolic blood pressure lowering (-9.1\u00b16.8 versus -6.8\u00b17.1 versus -5.3\u00b16.4 mm Hg in participants with 0, 1, and 2 copies of 65L-142V, respectively; P=0.0088). One thousand four hundred sixty participants with hypertension and coronary artery disease from the INternational VErapamil SR/Trandolapril STudy (INVEST) were genotyped, and variant alleles of all 3 GRK4 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were associated with increased risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes in an additive fashion, with 486V homozygotes reaching statistical significance (odds ratio, 2.29 [1.48-3.55]; P=0.0002). These effects on adverse cardiovascular outcomes were independent of antihypertensive treatment. These results suggest that the presence of GRK4 variant alleles may be important determinants of blood pressure response to atenolol and risk for adverse cardiovascular events. The associations with GRK4 variant alleles were stronger in patients who were also ADRB1 389R homozygotes, suggesting a potential interaction between these 2 genes.", 
    "166": "Many drugs that target G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) induce or inhibit their signal transduction with different strengths, which affect their therapeutic properties. However, the mechanism underlying the differences in the signalling levels is still not clear, although several structures of GPCRs complexed with ligands determined by X-ray crystallography are available. Here we utilized NMR to monitor the signals from the methionine residue at position 82 in neutral antagonist- and partial agonist-bound states of \u03b2(2)-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2(2)AR), which are correlated with the conformational changes of the transmembrane regions upon activation. We show that this residue exists in a conformational equilibrium between the inverse agonist-bound states and the full agonist-bound state, and the population of the latter reflects the signal transduction level in each ligand-bound state. These findings provide insights into the multi-level signalling of \u03b2(2)AR and other GPCRs, including the basal activity, and the mechanism of signal transduction mediated by GPCRs.",

Accordingly, we assessed the hypothesis that carvedilol may reduce the severity of atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E (apoE)-deficient mice in addition to its hemodynamic effects. Atherosclerosis was induced in apoE-deficient mice fed a high-fat diet containing 0.3% cholesterol. Mice were orally treated with propranolol (30 mg/kg/day), metoprolol (75 mg/kg/day) and carvedilol (10 mg/kg/day) over eight weeks (each group n = 7-9). Fatty streak plaque developed in apoE-deficient mice, and was suppressed in mice treated with all three drugs. The accumulation of macrophages and expression of CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells in the lesions were decreased by the treatment of the drugs, of which carvedilol was the most effective. In addition, carvedilol reduced superoxide production in aortic walls detected by ethidium staining. There were no significant changes in blood pressure among the study groups. The heart rates in the treated groups were decreased by 4%-12% compared with the control group, with carvedilol yielding the highest suppression of heart rate. The \u03b2-blocker treatment did not significantly modify the serum lipid profiles. Carvedilol may suppress atherosclerosis via reducing superoxide production, in addition to the hemodynamic modifications in this animal model.",

The experiments were performed on cultured H9c2 cells exposed to ISO (10 \u03bcM) alone or combined with TTX (1 \u03bcM) for 48 h. Our results showed that ISO significantly increased cell surface area by 30 % and atrial natriuretic peptide gene expression by nearly twofold (p < 0.05 for both). These effects were associated with a significant reduction in the gene expression of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase isoforms \u03b12 and \u03b13, whereas the \u03b11 isoform was unaffected. Conversely, ISO increased Na(+)-H(+) exchanger 1 (NHE-1) gene expression by approximately 40 % and significantly increased [Na(+)]( i ) level by 50 % (p < 0.05 for both).

All these effects were prevented when identical experiments were carried out in the presence of TTX, but the expression of NHE-1. The expression of sodium channel protein type 5 subunit alpha was unaffected by either ISO or TTX.

    "199": "While high levels of glucose and saturated fatty acids are known to have detrimental effects on beta cell function and survival, the signalling pathways mediating these effects are not entirely known. In a previous study, we found that ADP regulates beta cell insulin secretion and beta cell apoptosis. Using MIN6c4 cells as a model system, we investigated if autocrine/paracrine mechanisms of ADP and purinergic receptors are involved in this process. High glucose (16.7\u00a0mmol/l) and palmitate (100\u00a0\u03bcmol/l) rapidly and potently elevated the extracellular ATP levels, while mannitol was without effect. Both tolbutamide and diazoxide were without effect, while the calcium channel blocker nifedipine, the volume-regulated anion channels (VRAC) inhibitor NPPB, and the pannexin inhibitor carbenoxolone could inhibit both effects. Similarly, silencing the MDR1 gene also blocked nutrient-generated ATP release. These results indicate that calcium channels and VRAC might be involved in the ATP release mechanism. Furthermore, high glucose and palmitate inhibited cAMP production, reduced cell proliferation in MIN6c4 and increased activated Caspase-3 cells in mouse islets and in MIN6c4 cells. The P2Y(13)-specific antagonist MRS2211 antagonized all these effects. Further studies showed that blocking the P2Y(13) receptor resulted in enhanced CREB, Bad and IRS-1 phosphorylation, which are known to be involved in beta cell survival and insulin secretion. These findings provide further support for the concept that P2Y(13) plays an important role in beta cell apoptosis and suggest that autocrine/paracrine mechanisms, related to ADP and P2Y(13) receptors, contribute to glucolipotoxicity.",

To study specifically the HRR impact, another set of animals received IVA and was submitted to rapid atrial pacing (200 bpm) to abolish HRR. IVA and PROPRA induced a similar HRR (IVA: 22-26%, PRORA: 20-21%, p<0.01 vs. control), which was associated with a significant increase in TOVF with IVA (2325s) compared to PROPRA (682s) and saline (401s). This effect was abolished by atrial pacing performed during ischaemia and throughout the entire experimental session. Only IVA partially prevented the decrease in phosphocreatine-to-ATP ratio (CrP/ATP) ratio and the ADP accumulation at the onset of ventricular fibrillation. Finally, CrP/ATP ratio levels were correlated with TOVF (r=0.74, p<0.001).",

In this study, we focused on the identification of the downstream targets of the TLR4 pathways. When THP-1 cells were treated with anti-\u03b2(2)GPI/\u03b2(2)GPI complex, enhanced TF expression was observed, along with induced phosphorylation of p38, ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 MAPKs. When the activity of MAPKs was blocked by their corresponding inhibitors (SB203580: p38; U0126: ERK; SP600125: JNK), the expression of TF was reduced significantly. Furthermore, the anti-\u03b2(2)GPI/\u03b2(2)GPI-induced phosphorylation of p38, ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 was inhibited significantly by TAK-242, a blocker of the signaling transduction mediated by the intracellular domain of TLR4; sc-204013, a specific inhibitor of IRAKs, was also able to partially inhibit the phosphorylation of the MAPKs. Our results demonstrated that MAPKs (p38, ERK1/2 and JNK1/2) were the crucial downstream targets of the anti-\u03b2(2)GPI/\u03b2(2)GPI-triggered TLR4 signaling pathways in THP-1 cells.

    "209": "The pathways inducing the critical transition from compensated hypertrophy to cardiac dilation and failure remain poorly understood. The goal of our study is to determine the role of Rac-induced signaling in this transition process. Our previous results showed that Thyroxin (T4) treatment resulted in increased myocardial Rac expression in wild-type mice and a higher level of expression in Zea maize RacD (ZmRacD) transgenic mice. Our current results showed that T4 treatment induced physiologic cardiac hypertrophy in wild-type mice, as demonstrated by echocardiography and histopathology analyses. This was associated with significant increases in myocardial Rac-GTP, superoxide and ERK1/2 activities. Conversely, echocardiography and histopathology analyses showed that T4 treatment induced dilated cardiomyopathy along with compensatory cardiac hypertrophy in ZmRacD mice. These were linked with further increases in myocardial Rac-GTP, superoxide and ERK1/2 activities. Additionally, there were significant increases in caspase-8 expression and caspase-3 activity. However, there was a significant decrease in p38-MAPK activity. Interestingly, inhibition of myocardial Rac-GTP activity and superoxide generation with pravastatin and carvedilol, respectively, attenuated all functional, structural, and molecular changes associated with the T4-induced cardiomyopathy in ZmRacD mice except the compensatory cardiac hypertrophy. Taken together, T4-induced ZmRacD is a novel mouse model of dilated cardiomyopathy that shares many characteristics with the human disease phenotype. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show graded Rac-mediated O(2)\u00b7(-) results in cardiac phenotype shift in-vivo. Moreover, Rac-mediated O(2)\u00b7(-) generation, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and myocardial fibrosis seem to play a pivotal role in the transition from cardiac hypertrophy to cardiac dilation and failure. Targeting Rac signaling could represent valuable therapeutic strategy not only in saving the failing myocardium but also to prevent this transition process.",

Recently, ASPP 049, a diarylheptanoid isolated from Curcuma comosa Roxb., has been identified as a phytoestrogen. This investigation determined the involvement of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling in the estrogenic activity of this diarylheptanoid in transfected HEK 293T and in mouse preosteoblastic (MC3T3-E1) cells using a TOPflash luciferase assay and immunofluorescence. ASPP 049 rapidly activated T-cell-specific transcription factor/lymphoid enhancer binding factor-mediated transcription activity and induced \u03b2-catenin accumulation in the nucleus. Interestingly, the effects of ASPP 049 on the transcriptional activity and induction and accumulation of \u03b2-catenin protein in the nucleus of MC3T3-E1 cells were greater compared with estradiol. Activation of \u03b2-catenin in MC3T3-E1 cells was inhibited by ICI 182,780, suggesting that an estrogen receptor is required. In addition, ASPP 049 induced phosphorylations at serine 473 of Akt and serine 9 of GSK-3\u03b2. Moreover, ASPP 049 also induced proliferation and expressions of Wnt target genes Axin2 and Runx2 in MC3T3-E1 cells. In addition, ASPP 049 increased alkaline phosphatase expression, and activity that was abolished by DKK-1, a blocker of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin receptor. Taken together, these results suggest that ASPP 049 from C. comosa induced osteoblastic cell proliferation and differentiation through ER\u03b1-, Akt-, and GSK-3\u03b2-dependent activation of \u03b2-catenin signaling. Our findings provide a scientific rationale for using C. comosa as a dietary supplement to prevent bone loss in postmenopausal women.", 
    "212": "In recent years substantial progress has been made in analytical methods for determining pharmaceutical residues in environmental samples. Although much work has attempted to establish the influence of sample matrix complexity on results through the determination of matrix effects (ME), extraction efficiency (EE) and absolute recovery of analytes (AR), comparison of these parameters is very complicated because different authors use different methods to obtain them. Moreover, there are few literature data describing the influence of aqueous matrices (tap water and waste water) on results obtained with GC-MS methods. For these reasons, the main aims of the present study were: (1) to critically review the determination of matrix effects and recovery parameters using the two most common techniques for analyzing drugs in environmental samples: gas and liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry or tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS, GC-MS/MS and LC-MS, LC-MS/MS); (2) to postulate a uniform method for determining ME, EE and AR using GC techniques; (3) to investigate the influence of different aqueous matrices on the solid-phase extraction, derivatization and final determination of drugs using GC. \u03b2-Blockers and \u03b2-agonists, drugs commonly found in the environment, were chosen as model compounds for this investigation. The values of ME, EE and AR obtained were compared with analogous (or similar) data obtained by other researchers using LC-MS measurements. All the results confirmed that GC-MS analyses are much less sensitive to the complexity of sample matrices than LC-MS, so GC-MS measurements appear to be a very good alternative to LC-MS methods of determining pharmaceutical residues in environmental samples.",

As a result SERS has so far achieved limited reproducibility. Therefore the aim of this study was to improve enhancement and reproducibility in SERS, and to achieve this, we have developed a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) based on Pareto optimality. In this MOEA approach, we tested a combination of five different colloids with six different aggregating agents, and a wide range of concentrations for both were explored; in addition we included in the optimization process three laser excitation wavelengths. For this optimization of experimental conditions for SERS, we chose the \u03b2-adrenergic blocker drug propranolol as the target analyte. The objective functions chosen suitable for this multiobjective problem were the ratio between the full width at half-maximum and the half-maximum intensity for enhancement and correlation coefficient for reproducibility. To analyze a full search of all the experimental conditions, 7785 experiments would have to be performed empirically; however, we demonstrated the search for acceptable experimental conditions of SERS can be achieved using only 4% of these possible experiments. The MOEA identified several experimental conditions for each objective which allowed a limit of detection of 2.36 ng/mL (7.97 nM) propranolol, and this is significantly lower (>25 times) than previous SERS studies aimed at detecting this \u03b2-blocker.", 
    "222": "The thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (THAL) reabsorbs \u223c30% of the filtered NaCl in a process mediated by the apical Na-K-2Cl cotransporter NKCC2. Stimulation of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors in the THAL enhances NaCl reabsorption and increases intracellular cAMP. We found that intracellular cAMP stimulates NKCC2 trafficking to the apical membrane via protein kinase A (PKA). Several cAMP-specific phosphodiesterases (PDE) have been identified in rat THALs, and PDE4 decreases cAMP generated by \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation in other cells. However, it is not known whether \u03b2-adrenergic receptors activation stimulates NKCC2 trafficking. Thus we hypothesized that \u03b2-adrenergic receptor stimulation enhances THAL apical membrane NKCC2 expression via the PKA pathway and PDE4 blunts this effect. THAL suspensions were obtained from Sprague-Dawley rats, and surface NKCC2 expression was measured by surface biotinylation and Western blot. Incubation of THALs with the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol at 0.5 and 1.0 \u03bcM increased surface NKCC2 by 17 \u00b1 1 and 29 \u00b1 5% respectively (P < 0.05). Preventing cAMP degradation with 3-isobutyl-methylxanthine (IBMX; a nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor) enhanced isoproterenol-stimulated surface NKCC2 expression to 51 \u00b1 7% (P < 0.05 vs. isoproterenol). The \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol or the PKA inhibitor H-89 completely blocked isoproterenol + IBMX-induced increase on surface NKCC2, while propranolol or H-89 alone had no effect. Selective inhibition of PDE4 with rolipram (20 \u03bcM) potentiated the effect of isoproterenol on surface NKCC2 and increased cAMP levels. We concluded that \u03b2-adrenergic receptor stimulation enhances surface NKCC2 expression in the THALs via PKA and PDE4 blunts this effect.", 
    "223": "Chronic heart disease induces remodeling of cardiac tissue and associated neuronal components. Treatment of chronic heart disease often involves pharmacological blockade of adrenergic receptors. This study examined the specific changes in neuronal sensitivity of guinea pig intrinsic cardiac neurons to autonomic modulators in animals with chronic cardiac disease, in the presence or absence of adrenergic blockage. Myocardial infarction (MI) was produced by ligature of the coronary artery and associated vein on the dorsal surface of the heart. Pressure overload (PO) was induced by a banding of the descending dorsal aorta (\u223c20% constriction). Animals were allowed to recover for 2 wk and then implanted with an osmotic pump (Alzet) containing either timolol (2 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7day(-1)) or vehicle, for a total of 6-7 wk of drug treatment. At termination, intracellular recordings from individual neurons in whole mounts of the cardiac plexus were used to assess changes in physiological responses. Timolol treatment did not inhibit the increased sensitivity to norepinephrine seen in both MI and PO animals, but it did inhibit the stimulatory effects of angiotensin II on the norepinephrine-induced increases in neuronal excitability. Timolol treatment also inhibited the increase in synaptically evoked action potentials observed in PO animals with stimulation of fiber tract bundles. These results demonstrate that \u03b2-adrenergic blockade can inhibit specific aspects of remodeling within the intrinsic cardiac plexus. In addition, this effect was preferentially observed with active cardiac disease states, indicating that the \u03b2-receptors were more influential on remodeling during dynamic disease progression.", 
    "224": "Somatostatin-14 (SST) inhibits insulin and glucagon secretion by activating G protein-coupled somatostatin receptors (SSTRs), of which five isoforms exist (SSTR1-5). In mice, the effects on pancreatic \u03b2-cells are mediated by SSTR5, whereas \u03b1-cells express SSTR2. In both cell types, SSTR activation results in membrane hyperpolarization and suppression of exocytosis. Here, we examined the mechanisms by which SST inhibits secretion from human \u03b2- and \u03b1-cells and the SSTR isoforms mediating these effects. Quantitative PCR revealed high expression of SSTR2, with lower levels of SSTR1, SSTR3, and SSTR5, in human islets. Immunohistochemistry showed expression of SSTR2 in both \u03b2- and \u03b1-cells. SST application hyperpolarized human \u03b2-cells and inhibited action potential firing. The membrane hyperpolarization was unaffected by tolbutamide but antagonized by tertiapin-Q, a blocker of G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K\u207a channels (GIRK). The effect of SST was mimicked by an SSTR2-selective agonist, whereas a SSTR5 agonist was marginally effective. SST strongly (>70%) reduced depolarization-evoked exocytosis in both \u03b2- and \u03b1-cells. A slightly weaker inhibition was observed in both cell types after SSTR2 activation. SSTR3- and SSTR1-selective agonists moderately reduced the exocytotic responses in \u03b2- and \u03b1-cells, respectively, whereas SSTR4- and SSTR5-specific agonists were ineffective. SST also reduced voltage-gated P/Q-type Ca\u00b2\u207a currents in \u03b2-cells, but normalization of Ca\u00b2\u207a influx to control levels by prolonged depolarizations only partially restored exocytosis. We conclude that SST inhibits secretion from both human \u03b2- and \u03b1-cells by activating GIRK and suppressing electrical activity, reducing P/Q-type Ca\u00b2\u207a currents, and directly inhibiting exocytosis. These effects are mediated predominantly by SSTR2 in both cell types.",

    "227": "F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy continues to gain increasing interest as a technique for real-time monitoring of biochemical and signaling events in live cells and tissues. Compared to classical biochemical methods, this novel technology is characterized by high temporal and spatial resolution. FRET experiments use various genetically-encoded biosensors which can be expressed and imaged over time in situ or in vivo. Typical biosensors can either report protein-protein interactions by measuring FRET between a fluorophore-tagged pair of proteins or conformational changes in a single protein which harbors donor and acceptor fluorophores interconnected with a binding moiety for a molecule of interest. Bimolecular biosensors for protein-protein interactions include, for example, constructs designed to monitor G-protein activation in cells, while the unimolecular sensors measuring conformational changes are widely used to image second messengers such as calcium, cAMP, inositol phosphates and cGMP. Here we describe how to build a customized epifluorescence FRET imaging system from single commercially available components and how to control the whole setup using the Micro-Manager freeware. This simple but powerful instrument is designed for routine or more sophisticated FRET measurements in live cells. Acquired images are processed using self-written plug-ins to visualize changes in FRET ratio in real-time during any experiments before being stored in a graphics format compatible with the build-in ImageJ freeware used for subsequent data analysis. This low-cost system is characterized by high flexibility and can be successfully used to monitor various biochemical events and signaling molecules by a plethora of available FRET biosensors in live cells and tissues. As an example, we demonstrate how to use this imaging system to perform real-time monitoring of cAMP in live 293A cells upon stimulation with a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor agonist and blocker.", 
    "228": "Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy of selected \u03b2-blockers for preventing cardiovascular (CV) events in patients following myocardial infarction (MI) or with heart failure (HF). However, the effectiveness of \u03b2-blockers for preventing CV events in patients with hypertension has been questioned recently, but it is unclear whether this is a class effect.", 
    "229": "Using electronic medical record and health plan data from the Cardiovascular Research Network Hypertension Registry, we compared incident MI, HF, and stroke in patients who were new \u03b2-blocker users between 2000 and 2009. Patients had no history of CV disease and had not previously filled a prescription for a \u03b2-blocker. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to examine the associations of atenolol and metoprolol tartrate with incident CV events using both standard covariate adjustment (n = 120,978) and propensity score-matching methods (n = 22,352).", 
    "230": "During follow-up (median, 5.2 years), there were 3517 incident MI, 3272 incident HF, and 3664 incident stroke events. Hazard ratios for MI, HF, and stroke in metoprolol tartrate users were 0.99 (95% CI, 0.97-1.02), 0.99 (95% CI, 0.96-1.01), and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.97-1.02), respectively. An alternative approach using propensity score matching yielded similar results in 11,176 new metoprolol tartrate users, who were similar to 11,176 new atenolol users with regard to demographic and clinical characteristics.", 
    "231": "There were no statistically significant differences in incident CV events between atenolol and metoprolol tartrate users with hypertension. Large registries similar to the one used in this analysis may be useful for addressing comparative effectiveness questions that are unlikely to be resolved by randomized trials."
