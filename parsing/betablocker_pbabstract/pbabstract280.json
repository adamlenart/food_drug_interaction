The beta-blockers used in the present study were bopindolol, active metabolite of bopindolol (18-502), atenolol, propranolol, pindolol, nadolol, alprenolol, oxprenolol, metoprolol, labetalol and acebutolol. The value of the partition coefficient of propranolol was the highest, and that of the beta1-selective blocker atenolol was the lowest. Although low correlation coefficients between hydrophobicity and inhibitory beta-blocking potencies determined by pharmacological experiments or displacemental potencies by the radioligand binding assay using 3H-CGP12177 and 125I-iodocyanopindolol were observed, significant relationships between hydrophobicities of these drugs and dissociating potencies from beta-ARs were observed. These results suggest that the hydrophobicity of drugs may be important for the slow dissociation from beta-ARs, but not for the beta-blocking action.", 
    "1": "The changes in beta-adrenergic receptors and in adenylate cyclase (AC) activity were investigated in parotid glands from rats with acute diabetic mellitus (DM) induced by a single injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 80 mg/kg). The animals were divided into three groups: control rats, DM rats, and insulin-treated DM rats. Experiments were performed 7 days after the injection of STZ. Amylase and norepinephrine (NE) contents in parotid glands were markedly decreased in DM rats in comparison with control rats. The density of beta-adrenergic receptor decreased in DM rats, but its affinity for ligand was unaffected. The effect of GTP on isoprenaline (ISO)-stimulated adenylate cyclase (AC) activity significantly decreased in DM rats, but forskolin-stimulated AC activity was unaltered. In addition, diabetes induced the blunted response of AC activity to ISO. The changes in AC activity and in amylase content induced by diabetes were restored by insulin, but those in NE content and receptor density could not. These observations indicate that diabetes decreases NE and amylase contents, receptor density, and receptor-AC coupling in parotid gland, and that these changes would occur in the earlier stage of acute STZ-induced diabetic state.", 
    "2": "In the present study we examined the effect of alpha-adrenergic regulation of active transepithelial Na+ absorption across the isolated frog skin epithelium. alpha-Adrenergic stimulation was achieved by addition of the adrenergic agonist noradrenaline in the presence of the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol. alpha-Adrenergic stimulation inhibited basal as well as antidiuretic hormone (ADH)-stimulated Na+ transport. The ADH-induced increase in Na+ transport was accompanied by a membrane depolarisation due to an increase in the apical Na+ permeability. The subsequent application of noradrenaline inhibited the Na+ transport and repolarised the membrane potential, suggesting that alpha-adrenergic stimulation had reduced the apical Na+ permeability. The inhibition was abolished by the alpha2-adrenergic antagonist yohimbine whereas it was insensitive to the alpha1-adrenergic antagonist prazosin. alpha-Adrenergic stimulation had no effect on the cytosolic free [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]i). Incubation of the epithelium in the presence of ADH increased the cellular adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) content, an increase which was abolished by alpha-adrenergic activation. The effect of alpha-adrenergic stimulation on cAMP production was abolished by the alpha2-adrenergic antagonist yohimbine. We conclude that the noradrenaline-induced inhibition of the ADH-stimulated Na+ absorption and cAMP content is mediated by activation of alpha2-adrenoceptors. The data further indicate that the principal cells of the epithelium do not express alpha1-adrenoceptors. The noradrenaline-induced inhibition of the ADH-stimulated Na+ transport was concentration dependent, with 0.24+/-0.03 microM eliciting a half-maximal response. This alpha2-adrenergic-mediated down-regulation of Na+ absorption is achieved at a concentration of noradrenaline which begins to activate the NaCl secretion via the skin glands. The alpha2-adrenoceptors therefore appear to have considerable physiological importance.", 
    "3": "A case history of a woman with gingival overgrowth (GO) induced by amlodipine is presented. A 49-year-old Japanese woman, who was taking amlodipine, had gingival overgrowth and swelling on examination. No specific periodontal treatment was provided to the patient for the GO; however, the amlodipine was replaced with an ACE inhibitor after consultation with her medical practitioner. Within two months, the suspension of amlodipine resulted in a significant improvement in her periodontal condition. Failure to control the hypertension caused the physician to re-prescribe amlodipine. After three months, the gingival overgrowth returned; however, its severity was less when compared with the original periodontal condition, due to reduction in drug dose and periodontal therapy. This experience suggests that temporary suspension of a drug which can induce GO can improve the periodontal condition without the aid of surgical treatment.", 
    "4": "This minireview deals with the role of intercellular communication and synchronization in the initiation and maintenance of ventricular fibrillation. It is proposed that myocardial cell junctions might represent a therapeutic substrate for the prevention of this fatal arrhythmia. This hypothesis is supported by the results of recent experimental studies involving elucidation of the mechanism of antiarrhythmic-defibrillating effects of sotalol. Enhancement of intercellular communication and myocardial synchronization are thought to play critical role in the mechanism of action of this drug.", 
    "5": "Carvedilol is a unique cardiovascular drug of multifaceted therapeutic potential. Its major molecular targets recognized to date are membrane adrenoceptors (beta 1, beta 2, and alpha 1), reactive oxygen species, and ion channels (K+ and Ca2+). Carvedilol provides prominent hemodynamic benefits mainly through a balanced adrenoceptor blockade, which causes a reduction in cardiac work in association with peripheral vasodilation. This drug assures remarkable cardiovascular protection through its antiproliferative/atherogenic, antiischemic, antihypertrophic, and antiarrhythmic actions. These actions are a consequence of its potent antioxidant effects, amelioration of glucose/lipid metabolism, modulation of neurohumoral factors, and modulation of cardiac electrophysiologic properties. The usefulness of carvedilol in the treatment of hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and congestive heart failure is based on a combination of hemodynamic benefits and cardiovascular protection.", 
    "6": "To explore the signaling mechanisms of the negative modulation of beta-adrenoceptors by kappa-Opioid receptors (kappa-OR) in the heart, the possibility of the interaction at the level of G protein and receptor was determined. Cholera toxin, an activator of the stimulatory G protein (Gs), elevated electrically induced intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) transients and induced ribosylation of the alpha-subunit of Gs (Gsalpha) in rat ventricular myocytes. The effects were significantly attenuated by U50,488H, a specific agonist of kappa-OR, and were abolished by nor-binaltorphimine, a selective kappa-OR antagonist. The content of Gsalpha, however, was not affected by U50,488H. Receptor binding experiments showed that neither Bmax nor Kd of the binding of [3H]CGP-12177, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, was affected by U50,488H. The current study provides the first evidence that kappa-OR stimulation inhibits the ribosylation of the alpha-subunit of the Gs protein, thus inhibiting the action of cholera toxin on the protein.", 
    "7": "Nebivolol is a highly selective beta1-adrenoreceptor-blocking agent with a peculiar pharmacodynamic profile. It has peripheral acute vasodilating properties that are mediated by modulation of the endogenous production of nitric oxide. In this study we analyzed the different signaling pathways implicated in the response of human umbilical vein endothelial cells to nebivolol. Its effect on endothelial transduction pathways was determined by assaying phospholipase C and A2 activities and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) production. Variations in intracellular calcium concentration were also measured. Our results showed that nebivolol activates a calcium-independent transduction pathway that implicates an increase in adenylate cyclase and phospholipase A2 activity. Beta1- or beta2-Adrenoreceptor antagonists do not inhibit the action of nebivolol. However, its action on cyclic AMP production is inhibited by bupranolol, a beta1-3-adrenoreceptor antagonist, and S-(-)-cyanopindolol, a selective beta3-adrenoreceptor antagonist. Nebivolol also dose-dependently increased nitrite production. This effect was inhibited by bupranolol, suggesting that the possible action of nebivolol on beta3-adrenoreceptor is involved in its vasodilating properties. This study suggests that nebivolol could behave as a beta3-adrenoreceptor agonist and induce some calcium-independent pathways implicating phospholipase A2 and adenylate cyclase. This agonistic activity of nebivolol seems to be responsible for its endothelium-dependent vasodilating activity.", 
    "8": "5-HT1A knockout (KO) mice display an anxious-like phenotype, whereas 5-HT1B KOs are over-aggressive. To identify serotoninergic correlates of these altered behaviors, autoradiographic measurements of 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B serotonin (5-HT) receptors and transporter (5-HTT) were obtained using the radioligands [3H]8-OH-DPAT, [125I]cyanopindolol and [3H]citalopram, respectively. By comparison to wild-type, density of 5-HT1B receptors was unchanged throughout brain in 5-HT1A KOs, and that of 5-HT1A receptors in 5-HT1B KOs. In contrast, decreases in density of 5-HTT binding were measured in several brain regions of both genotypes. Moreover, 5-HTT binding density was significantly increased in the amygdalo-hippocampal nucleus and ventral hippocampus of the 5-HT1B KOs. Measurements of 5-HT axon length and number of axon varicosities by quantitative 5-HT immunocytochemistry revealed proportional increases in the density of 5-HT innervation in these two regions of 5-HT1B KOs, whereas none of the decreases in 5-HTT binding sites were associated with any such changes. Several conclusions could be drawn from these results: (i) 5-HT1B receptors do not adapt in 5-HT1A KOs, nor do 5-HT1A receptors in 5-HT1B KOs. (ii) 5-HTT is down-regulated in several brain regions of 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B KO mice. (iii) This down-regulation could contribute to the anxious-like phenotype of the 5-HT1A KOs, by reducing 5-HT clearance in several territories of 5-HT innervation. (iv) The 5-HT hyperinnervation in the amygdalo-hippocampal nucleus and ventral hippocampus of 5-HT1B KOs could play a role in their increased aggressiveness, and might also explain their better performance in some cognitive tests. (v) These increases in density of 5-HT innervation provide the first evidence for a negative control of 5-HT neuron growth mediated by 5-HT1B receptors.", 
    "9": "KMUP 880723 (0.5, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/kg, iv) produced dose-dependent hypotensive and bradycardia responses in pentobarbital-anesthetized Wistar rats. KMUP 880723 (1.0 mg/kg, iv) also markedly inhibited both the tachycardia effects induced by (-)isoproterenol and arterial pressor responses induced by phenylephrine. In the isolated Wistar rat right atria, left atria, and guinea pig tracheal strips, KMUP 880723 competitively antagonized the (-)isoproterenol-induced positive chronotropic effects, inotropic effects, and tracheal relaxation effects in a concentration-dependent manner. The parallel shift to the right of the concentration-response curve of (-)isoproterenol suggested that KMUP 880723 was a beta(1)/beta(2)-adrenoceptor competitive antagonist. The apparent pA(2) values were 6.89+/-0.10 in the right atria, 7.02+/-0.09 in the left atria, and 6.59+/-0.11 in the trachea, indicating that KMUP 880723 was a nonselective beta-adrenoceptor blocker. In thoracic aorta experiments, KMUP 880723 also produced a competitive antagonism of norepinephrine-induced contraction with a pA(2) value of 7.14+/-0.06. In isolated rat thoracic aorta, KMUP 880723 more potently relaxed the contractions induced by norepinephrine (3 x 10(-6) M) than those by high K(+) (75 mM). In the radioligand-binding assay, the pK(i) values of [3H]CGP-12177 binding to rat ventricle and lung membranes were 6.56 and 6.40, respectively, and the value of [3H]prazosin binding to rat brain membranes was 6.66. These results further confirmed the alpha/beta-adrenoceptor blocking activities of KMUP 880723 reported in the functional studies. We conclude that KMUP 880723 is a nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with alpha-adrenoceptor blocking-associated vasorelaxant activity.", 
    "10": "The interaction between homologous C-type natriuretic peptide (dfCNP) and catecholamine release in cardiovascular control was assessed in the marine dogfish (Squalus acanthias). This was accomplished by evaluation of the dynamics of the dfCNP-elicited secretion of catecholamines in situ and in vivo. With an in situ saline-perfused postcardinal sinus preparation, it was demonstrated that perfusion with saline containing dfCNP (10(-9) mol x L(-1)) did not affect the secretion of either noradrenaline or adrenaline. However, the presence of dfCNP in the perfusate significantly enhanced carbachol-evoked secretion of noradrenaline. In vivo, intravascular injection of dfCNP (10(-9) mol x kg(-1)) caused a biphasic pressor-depressor response consisting of a brief increase in caudal artery blood pressure (P(CA)) followed by a prolonged reduction in P(CA). Furthermore, although systemic resistance initially increased, it was subsequently maintained at baseline values in the face of persistent decreases in both P(CA) and cardiac output. Bolus injection of dfCNP elicited significant increases in plasma noradrenaline levels that peaked within 10 min; plasma adrenaline levels were unaffected. The release of noradrenaline elicited by dfCNP was unaffected by prior blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) (with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril) or by pretreatment with the nicotinic receptor blocker hexamethonium. The delayed decrease in P(CA) was not observed in the hexamethonium-treated fish. Prior blockade of beta-adrenoreceptors (with sotalol) or alpha-adrenoreceptors (with prazosin) either significantly reduced (sotalol) or abolished (prazosin) the increase in plasma noradrenaline levels after dfCNP injection. The results of this investigation demonstrate that the elevation of plasma noradrenaline levels observed in vivo following dfCNP injection is not caused by a direct effect of dfCNP on catecholamine secretion from axillary body chromaffin cells. Furthermore, the dfCNP-mediated increase of plasma noradrenaline appears to be unrelated to changes in P(CA) and is insensitive to blockade of the RAS or nicotinic receptors. However, stimulation of adrenergic receptors, in particular the alpha-adrenoreceptors, appears to be a key mechanism underlying the dfCNP-elicited secretion of noradrenaline.",

    "12": "Patients (n=128) were randomized to sotalol (80 mg b.i.d.) or bisoprolol (5 mg x day(-1)). Patients with contraindications to beta-blockers, class III antiarrhythmic drugs or prior treatment with use of study medication for prevention of atrial fibrillation were excluded. Follow-up clinical evaluation was performed 1 day and 1 month after cardioversion and thereafter at 3-month intervals.", 
    "13": "There were no group differences in baseline clinical characteristics. After a follow-up of 12 months, 59% of all patients were still in sinus rhythm. The fraction remaining in sinus rhythm was calculated for the two groups by Kaplan--Meier analysis. During follow-up, 41% of patients on sotalol and 42% on bisoprolol developed atrial fibrillation (ns). In two patients (3.1%) on sotalol, life-threatening proarrhythmias (torsade de pointes tachycardias) occurred, whereas none were found in the bisoprolol group. Symptomatic bradycardias occurred in two patients on sotalol and three on bisoprolol.", 
    "14": "This study demonstrates that sotalol (160 mg x day(-1)) and bisoprolol (5 mg x day(-1)) are equally effective in maintaining sinus rhythm. Because of the side effects of sotalol, bisoprolol seems to be advantageous for maintenance of sinus rhythm after cardioversion of atrial fibrillation.", 
    "15": "The effects of diesel exhaust particles (DEP) on pulmonary functions and consequent diseases are well known, but there have been few reports concerning involvement of the cardiovascular system. In order to assess a direct action of DEP on cardiac tissue, the effects on blood pressure of intravenous administration of 12 or 120 mg/kg DEP to anesthetized rats were studied for a 15-min period. DEP (120 mg/kg) significantly lowered blood pressure for 25 s with no signs of arrhythmia or mortality, a phenomenon seen in guinea pigs. After 25 s blood pressure gradually returned to control levels and was maintained for 15 min. The 12-mg/kg DEP concentration did not markedly affect rat blood pressure. Pretreatment with atropine (24 mg/kg) blocked the DEP-induced fall in blood pressure, while pretreatment with propranolol (48 mg/kg) proved ineffective against DEP, suggesting involvement of the parasympathetic system. Data show that the rat is less sensitive to DEP-induced effects on blood pressure and may be a poor model to reflect cardiovascular changes.",

Incorporating the cost of drugs, physician visits, and adverse-event treatments, the model concluded that availability of telmisartan on formulary may shorten the mean time and costs to control. The stability of the initial findings over a range of sensitivity analyses lends credence to the model conclusions that availability of telmisartan on formulary improves the therapeutic options of care for hypertension.",

Stratification to high risk now includes those patients with only a minor degree of electrocardiographic ST depression (0.5 mm) or a significant elevation of cardiac troponin. High-risk patients are recommended to be treated with intensive medical and invasive management. Intermediate-risk patients may be best evaluated using an accelerated diagnostic strategy over an 8-12 h period before being reclassified as high or low risk.", 
    "19": "Advances have occurred rapidly in how the patient who presents with acute ST elevation myocardial infarction is managed. Nevertheless, due to availability and effectiveness, medical therapy continues to be the mainstay of treatment. Several drugs are of proven efficacy in decreasing myocardial loss and mortality. Thrombolytics, antiplatelets, and anticoagulants combine to decrease the thrombus overlying the active plaque and thus increase blood flow to the infarcting myocardium. Beta blockers, nitrates, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors diminish myocardial oxygen consumption and have been shown to decrease morbidity and mortality. Supportive therapies provide patient comfort and aid survival until definitive therapies are instituted. However, as advanced as treatments become, none are effective unless patients are educated to seek help quickly and emergency response systems are efficient. Health care providers must ensure patient education and prompt medical response in communities so that medical regimens can be as effective as possible.", 
    "20": "Dilation and inflammation of cephalic arteries and intracranial extra cerebral arteries cause the migraine headache. The migraine-associated symptoms result from the activation of the sympathetic nervous system caused by the pain. The migraine aura is caused by the neurophysiological phenomenon of spreading excitation/depression. The various mechanisms are tied together in the so-called \"parallel theory\" of the pathogenesis of the migraine attack. The abortive antimigraine medications act by constricting the dilated arteries through stimulation of the serotonin 1B receptor. The preventive antimigraine medications act by increasing the tone of the extacranial arteries, inhibiting the mechanism of neurogenic inflammation, or inhibiting pain transmission within the central nervous system.", 
    "21": "Vascular endothelial dysfunction may predict future atherosclerosis. Hence, an antihypertensive agent that reverses endothelial dysfunction and lowers blood pressure might improve the prognosis of patients with hypertension. We hypothesized that nebivolol, a vasodilating beta-blocker, could improve endothelial dysfunction. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the effects of nebivolol and atenolol on endothelial function.", 
    "22": "Twelve hypertensive patients with a mean ambulatory blood pressure of 154+/-7/97+/-10 mm Hg were randomized after a 2-week placebo run-in period (baseline) in a double-blind, crossover fashion to 8-week treatment periods with either 5 mg of nebivolol with 2.5 mg of bendrofluazide or 50 mg of atenolol with 2.5 mg of bendrofluazide. Forearm venous occlusion plethysmography and intra-arterial infusions of acetylcholine and N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) were used to assess stimulated and basal endothelium-dependent nitric oxide release, respectively. Sodium nitroprusside was used as an endothelium-independent control. Nebivolol/bendrofluazide and atenolol/bendrofluazide each lowered the clinic blood pressure to the same extent (132+/-7/82+/-6 and 132+/-9/83+/-8 mm Hg, respectively; P<0.001 from baseline). The vasodilatory response to acetylcholine was significantly increased with nebivolol/bendrofluazide (maximum percentage change in forearm blood flow [mean+/-SEM], 435+/-27%, P<0.001) but not with atenolol/bendrofluazide. Similarly, the endothelium-dependent vasoconstrictive response to L-NMMA was significantly improved only with nebivolol treatment (percentage change in forearm blood flow, -54+/-5%; P<0.001). The response to sodium nitroprusside was not different between treatments, suggesting that the endothelium-independent pathway was unaffected.", 
    "23": "Nebivolol/bendrofluazide increased both stimulated and basal endothelial nitric oxide release, whereas for the same degree of blood pressure control, atenolol/bendrofluazide had no effect on nitric oxide bioactivity. Thus, nebivolol may offer additional vascular protection in treating hypertension.", 
    "24": "Arotinolol, a clinically used alpha/beta-adrenergic blocker, has been demonstrated to be an anti-obesity agent. The anti-obesity effect of arotinolol was suggested to be the result of direct activation of thermogenesis in brown-fat cells. We tested the ability of arotinolol to stimulate thermogenesis (oxygen consumption) in isolated brown-fat cells and in intact animals. Arotinolol stimulated thermogenesis in brown-fat cells isolated from mouse and hamster. A relatively low sensitivity to the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (pK(B) approximately 6) indicated that arotinolol interacted with the beta3-adrenergic receptor. On the beta3-receptor, arotinolol was a very weak (EC50 approximately 20 microM) and only partial (approximately 50%) agonist, but arotinolol also demonstrated the properties of being a beta3-receptor antagonist with a pK(B) of 5.7. In intact animals, only the antagonistic action of arotinolol could be observed. Because arotinolol is only a very weak and partial agonist on the beta3-receptors, direct stimulation of thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue is unlikely to be sufficient to cause significant weight loss. It may be necessary to invoke additional pathways to explain the anti-obesity effects of chronic treatment with arotinolol.", 
    "25": "Although amiodarone has been referred to as a class III antiarrhythmic agent, it also possesses electrophysiologic characteristics of the three other classes (classes I and IV and minor class II effects). Previous studies have demonstrated that amiodarone inhibits Ca2+ channel current in intact cardiac myocytes. However, it is not clear whether this response reflects a pure class IV effect (direct Ca2+ channel inhibition) or a class II effect (beta-adrenergic receptor blockade) of amiodarone.", 
    "26": "In the current study, the effects of amiodarone on Ca2+ current were studied in the absence of sympathetic regulation using a Xenopus oocyte expression system. The L-type Ca2+ channel alpha1C subunit was coexpressed with the alpha2delta and beta2a subunits in enzymatically digested Xenopus oocytes. Ca2+ currents were recorded using the cut-open oocyte preparation.", 
    "27": "We found that perfusion of 10 microM isoproterenol produced no significant change in peak Ca2+ current (from 223+/-33 to 210+/-29 nA, mean+/-SEM, n=5, P=not significant), indicating the absence of a functional stimulatory sympathetic signal pathway in these oocytes. After 10 minutes of exposure to 10 microM amiodarone, Ca2+ current amplitude was significantly decreased from 174+/-33 to 100+/-26 nA (n=8, P<0.01; control group: 220+/-33 to 212+/-29 nA, n=5, P=not significant). These effects were similar to those of 10 microM nifedipine (201+/-48 to 108+/-48 nA, n=6, P<0.05), a typical Ca2+ channel blocker. On the other hand, neither amiodarone nor nifedipine significantly altered the Ca2+ current activation or inactivation kinetics.", 
    "28": "These results demonstrate that amiodarone inhibits Ca2+ current in the absence of a functional intrinsic beta-adrenergic stimulatory system and, therefore, represents a true class IV effect.", 
    "29": "The temporal trajectory of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-beta receptor activation within the dorsocaudal brainstem parallels that of the mild hypoxic ventilatory depression (HVD) seen in adult rats. We hypothesized that enhanced PDGF-beta receptor activity may account for the particularly prominent HVD of developing mammals. To study this issue, 2-, 5-, 10-, and 20-d-old rats underwent hypoxic challenges (10% O(2) for 30 min) after pretreatment with either vehicle (Veh) or the selective PDGF-beta receptor antagonist CGP57148B (intraperitoneal 100 mg/kg). The developmental characteristics and magnitude of the peak hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR) were not modified by the PDGF-beta receptor blocker. However, HVD was markedly attenuated by CGP57148B, and such effect, although still present, gradually abated with increasing postnatal age [p < 0.001, analysis of variance (ANOVA)]. Hypercapnic ventilatory responses were not affected by CGP57148B. The expression of PDGF-beta receptor in the dorsocaudal brainstem was assessed by immunoblotting and confirmed progressively decreasing expression with maturation. We conclude that PDGF-beta receptor activation during hypoxia is an important contributor to HVD at all postnatal ages but more particularly in the immature rat.",

The primary end point was a diurnal reduction of trough/peak intraocular pressure from a timolol 0.5% twice daily baseline.", 
    "32": "Both treatment regimens reduced intraocular pressure significantly at all time points (P <.001): brinzolamide plus timolol by -3.6 to -5.3 mm Hg (-14.2 to -21.9%), dorzolamide plus timolol by -3.6 mm Hg to -5.1 mm Hg (-14.1 to -21.2%). Clinically relevant intraocular pressure reductions (decreases 5 mm Hg or greater or absolute intraocular pressure values 21 mm Hg or less) were manifested by 50.0% to 89.3% of patients under brinzolamide plus timolol and by 43.9% to 85.4% under dorzolamide plus timolol. The treatments were equivalent in mean intraocular pressure-lowering. In general, both regimens were well tolerated. However, more patients (P =.001) experienced at least one adverse event with dorzolamide plus timolol (32.8%) as compared with brinzolamide plus timolol (14.7%); also, more patients (P =.001) experienced ocular discomfort (stinging and burning) after dorzolamide plus timolol (13.1%) than after brinzolamide plus timolol (1.7%).",

    "34": "Techniques for examining signals in the time and frequency domains are well-established tools. These tools have their limitations; they tell us in a broad sense where the signal component exists in the frequency domain, but they do not tell us how its frequency characteristics change over time. The time-frequency has become a powerful alternative for the analysis of signals. Among various time-frequency distribution methods, one of the most studied is the Wigner-Ville distribution. The aim of this study was to evaluate in conscious rats smoothed pseudo Wigner--Ville distribution (SPWVD) as an alternative to the fast Fourier transform (FFT) in RR intervals and in systolic blood pressure (SBP), before and after adrenergic and cholinergic receptor blockade. Fourteen Wistar rats equipped with telemetry probe were evaluated: (1) under control conditions; (2) after injection of saline (100 microl kg(-1) i.v.); (3) after atenolol (1 mg kg(-1) i.v.); (4) after atropine methyl nitrate (0.5 mg kg(-1) i.v.); and (5) after phentolamine (5 mg kg(-1) i.v.). FFT and SPWVD were applied to RR intervals and SBP time series. Six-minute time series of RR intervals, systolic and diastolic pressures were analysed. The bias and distribution of differences between FFT and SPWVD methods in RR intervals under base conditions were 1.4+/-0.4% (r2=0.94; P<0.01) in LF/LF+HF: 1.5+/-0.5% ( r2=0.92; P<0.01) in HF/LF+HF and 4.8+/-1.9% (r2=0.92; P<0.01) in LF/HF. In SBP the bias and distribution were 1.5+/-0.8% (r2=0.90) P<0.05) in LF/LF+HF and 1.7+/-0.6% (r2=-0.92; P<0.01) in HF/LF+HF. In the frequency domain analysis of RR intervals and SBP there was no difference between FFT and SPWVD. The agreement between the methods demonstrates that in stationary signals both methods can be used interchangeably. SPWVD may be an interesting tool to analyse biomedical signals; it provides a good resolution at high frequency and a good frequency resolution at low frequencies independently if signals remain stationary.", 
    "35": "Alteration of mechanical responses elicited by transmural nerve stimulation (TNS) was investigated in pylorus muscle of stomach isolated from mutant mice lacking expression of IP, type-1 receptor. In wild and mutant mice. TNS inhibited spontaneous contractions and generated an off-response at the cessation. The effects of inhibitors of neurotransmission revealed that in wild mice, acetylcholine and nitric oxide were involved as excitatory and inhibitory mediators, respectively. In mutant mice, a lack of nitroxidergic component with associated attenuation of cholinergic transmission was found. The off-response was inhibited by apamin in both mice. In mutant mice, spantide-sensitive excitatory response appeared in the presence of apamin. Acetylcholine and substance P enhanced while noradrenaline and sodium nitroprusside inhibited spontaneous contractions, in both wild and mutant mice; the actions were weaker in mutant mice than in wild mice for any agonists. The results indicate that pylorus smooth muscles receive cholinergic excitatory and nitroxidergic and non-adrenergic non-cholinergic inhibitory projections, and a lack of IP, type-1 receptor results in an impairment of cholinergic and nitroxidergic components, with no alteration of non-adrenergic non-cholinergic inhibitory projections. In addition, the mutation induces a substance P projection which is not detected in wild mice.", 
    "36": "Arrhythmias do not systematically prevent athletic activities. Symptomatic bradyarrhythmias may first require pacemaker implantation. Usually occurring on normal heart, supraventricular tachycardias are benign. When responsible for palpitations, exercise intolerance or syncope, they may benefit from the use of beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers or most frequently radiofrequency catheter ablation. Ventricular arrhythmias with underlying cardiac disease do not allow intense and sustained physical activities. In case of symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias without cardiac disease, the use of beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers or radiofrequency catheter ablation usually permits sport practice.", 
    "37": "Regular physical exercise belongs to the non pharmacological tools for the control of high blood pressure. When practising it almost daily at low intensity during 30 minutes, and mainly on a dynamic mode, blood pressure can decrease almost of the same order of magnitude as with an antihypertensive drug. In severe hypertension, blood pressure must be first controlled by drugs before starting the physical exercise training. An exercise test is preferable before exercise suggestion in sedentary people older than 40 years. In hypertensive people who enter sportive competition, diuretics and betablockers are forbidden. These agents can also reduce performance.", 
    "38": "Severe cardiac autonomic denervation occurs in the acute Chagas' disease in rats. The present study aims at verifying whether this denervation was accompanied by impairment of heart function. Scorpionic (Tityus serrulatus) crude venom was used for neurotransmitter release in isolated hearts (Langendorff's preparation). In control hearts, the venom induced significant bradycardia followed by tachycardia. In infected animals, despite the severe (sympathetic) or moderate (parasympathetic) cardiac denervation, the venom provoked similar bradycardia but the tachycardia was higher. The hearts of infected animals beat at significantly lower rate. Atropine prevented this lower rate. Our results demonstrated sympathetic dysfunction during the acute phase of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in rats, the parasympathetic function being spared.", 
    "39": "Neurons from the superior cervical ganglia (SCG) innervate the submandibular gland and release noradrenaline during the dark phase of the daily photoperiod. Since in the pineal, another structure innervated by sympathetic neurons, nocturnal activation of the SCG is associated with beta-adrenergic sub- and super-sensitivity rhythms, the possible existence of similar phenomena in the rat submandibular gland was assessed. Wistar female rats, kept on a 14:10 light/dark cycle (light from 06:00 to 20:00 h), were sacrificed at 09:00, 14:00, 20:00, 24:00 and 04:00 h. beta-Adrenoceptors were studied by 3H-dihydroalprenolol binding to membrane preparations. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) did not change as a function of time while significant daily variations in maximal binding values (Bmax) were observed with a peak at 20:00 h. Changes in Bmax correlated with a high response of adenylate cyclase to isoproterenol. In addition, when the response in salivary flow to isoproterenol was measured. a shift to the left (about 1 logarithmic unit) in dose-response curves was observed at 19:00-20:00 has compared to 08:00-09:00 h. These daily variations in isoproterenol responsiveness seem not to depend on the pattern of eating since a 24-h starvation or a nocturnal starvation for 16-18 days did not abolish the morning-evening differences in the salivary flow response to isoproterenol. Rather, the results suggest that the daily variations in isoproterenol response correlate with beta-adrenergic super- and sub-sensitivity phenomena associated with the circadian release of noradrenaline from SCG neurons.", 
    "40": "The effects of somatosensory nociceptive pinch stimulation of the hindpaw on mesenteric microvascular hemodynamics and systemic circulatory parameters were investigated in anesthetized rats using an intravital microscope-television system. Blood flow velocity in the terminal (18-40 microm in diameter) or precapillary (10-20 microm in diameter) arterioles of the mesentery was monitored by the dual sensor method developed by the authors. In the proximal terminal arterioles, blood flow velocity decreased substantially along with arteriolar constriction induced by pinching of the hindpaw for 30 s. In the distal terminal arterioles and precapillary arterioles, blood flow velocity increased after pinching. In the proximal terminal arterioles, the decrease of velocity in response to reflex vasoconstriction was abolished by intravenous injection of an alpha-blocker (phentolamine, 10 mg/kg). The increase in mesenteric precapillary arteriolar blood flow velocity (43+/-9%, p < 0.01) associated with the increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP) (22+/-1%, p < 0.01) was observed within a few seconds after the onset of the stimulation, and then the response in blood flow velocity returned to the baseline ahead of MAP response recovery after the end of the stimulus. These responses were diminished by alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade. The heart rate (HR) increase (4+/-1%, p < 0.01) induced by pinching was abolished by beta-adrenergicreceptor blockade (propranolol, 3 mg/kg, i.v.). There was a strong correlation between the increase in MAP and the decrease in renal blood flow measured by laser Doppler flowmeter (r = 0.87-0.98). Pinch stimulation of the rat hindpaw evoked changes in mesenteric arteriolar blood flow velocity that were mediated via the somato-sympathetic reflex vasoconstriction and the pressor response.", 
    "41": "The effect of ephedrine on beta3-adrenoceptos (beta3-AR) was studied in the isolated adipose tissue of Wistar rat. Incubation with D-ephedrine (0.1-10 microM) induced a concentration-dependent decrease of uptake of [14C]-deoxy-D-glucose into white adipose tissues (WAT). The inhibitory effect of D-ephedrine was potentiated by BRL 37344, the agonist of beta3-AR and concentration-dependently inhibited by SR 59230A, the selective antagonist of beta3-AR. The action of D-ephedrine on beta3-AR was further blocked by the antibodies for beta3-AR, but not the immunoglobulin. in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, D-ephedrine increased glycerol release from the isolated brown adipose tissues (BAT) and this action was also abolished by SR 59230A at concentration sufficient to block beta3-AR. Thus, these results suggest that D-ephedrine has the ability to activate beta3-AR both in WAT and BAT of Wistar rats in vitro.", 
    "42": "Recently, we have demonstrated that functional beta1-adrenergic receptors are the dominant beta-adrenergic receptor subtype in the stria vascularis and that beta1-adrenergic receptors stimulate K+ secretion in strial marginal cells. The goal of the present study was to determine whether nonstrial tissues in the cochlear lateral wall contain beta-adrenergic receptors and if so which subtype is present. Pharmacological tools were used to identify receptors in functional studies where cAMP production was measured. Further, receptors were identified as transcripts by cloning and sequencing of reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) products. Experiments were performed on gerbil nonstrial lateral wall tissues. Tissues stimulated with 10(-5) M isoproterenol produced 0.42 +/- 0.22 pmol cAMP per ear within 12 min (n = 14). The selective beta-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol stimulated cAMP production with an EC50 of (2 +/- 3) x 10(-7) M (n = 7). Isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP production was inhibited by the beta2-adrenergic receptor antagonist ICI 118551 with an IC50 of (7 +/- 7) x 10(-6) M, which corresponds to an affinity constant of 1 x 10(-7) M (pK(DB) = 6.89 +/- 0.23, n = 3). Isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP production was not inhibited by the highly selective beta1-adrenergic receptor antagonist CGP 20712A. The IC50 and the affinity constant for CGP 20712A were estimated to be >3 x 10(-4) and >6 x 10(-6) M, respectively. RT-PCR of total RNA isolated from nonstrial lateral wall tissues using primers specific for beta1-, beta2- and beta3-adrenergic receptors revealed products of the predicted sizes for the beta1- and beta2- but not for the beta3-subtype. Sequence analysis confirmed that amplified cDNA fragments encoded gene-specific nucleotide sequences. These results demonstrate that nonstrial lateral wall tissues contain transcripts for beta1- and beta2- but not for beta3-adrenergic receptors and that the beta2-adrenergic receptor is the dominant functional receptor subtype. The cellular localization and function of the beta2-adrenergic receptors remains to be determined.",

To elucidate the basis for this paradoxical immaturity in urine-concentrating ability, we investigated the function of Henle's loop and collecting ducts (IMCDs) in the inner medulla of neonatal rat kidneys.", 
    "44": "Analyses of individual renal tubules in the inner medulla of neonatal and adult rat kidneys were performed by measuring mRNA expression of membrane transporters, transepithelial voltages, and isotopic water and ion fluxes.

The V(Ts) in the thin descending limbs (tDLs) were zero on day 1. The V(Ts) in the tALs were strongly inhibited by luminal bumetanide or basolateral ouabain, suggesting the presence of a NaCl reabsorption mechanism similar to that in the thick ascending limb (TAL). The diffusional voltage (V(D)) of the tAL due to transepithelial NaCl gradient was almost insensitive to a chloride channel blocker 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)-benzoate (NPPB). The V(Ts) in the IMCDs were strongly inhibited by luminal amiloride. On day 1, both the tDL and tAL were impermeable to water, indicating the water impermeability of the entire loop. Diffusional water permeability (P(dw)) and urea permeabilities (P(urea)) in the IMCDs indicated virtual impermeability to water and urea on day 1. Stimulation by vasopressin (1 nmol/L) revealed that only P(dw) was sensitive to vasopressin by day 14. A partial isoosmolar replacement of luminal urea by NaCl evoked negligible water flux across the neonatal IMCDs, indicating the absence of urea-dependent volume flux in the neonatal IMCD. These transport characteristics in each neonatal tubule are similar to those in quail kidneys. Identification of mRNAs and immunofluorescent studies for specific transporters, including rAQP-1, rCCC2, rCLC-K1, rENaC beta subunit, rAQP-2, and rUT-A1, supported these findings.",

This hypotensive effect resulting from peripheral vasodilation persisted after nadolol or CAB while baroreflex activation was blunted or abolished. A biphasic response of cardiac output, characterized by a rise and a decline (P < 0.05) reflected a reduction in after- and pre-load. After CAB, SR58611 did not modify cardiac contractility. SR58611 stimulated lipolysis as reflected by a 4-fold increase in blood free fatty acids (FFA) (P < 0.0005). Under CAB, the rise of FFA was reduced (P < 0.01). In hypertensive dogs, SR58611 produced a dose-dependent decrease in mean AOP (from 168 +/- 32 to 125 +/- 35 mmHg; - 26%, P < 0.0001), that was greater than in normal dogs (P < 0.05). Reflex-mediated tachycardia also occurred but at higher blood pressure values. Blood FFA rose similarly (P < 0.0001). Under CAB, heart rate remained unchanged but SR58611 still induced a decrease (P < 0.0001) in mean AOP concomitantly with a rise of (dP/dt)/DP40 (P < 0.005), an effect not observed in normal dogs.",

    "51": "In the present studies, we initiated experiments to identify the signal transduction factors involved in activating phagocytosis, oxidative burst, and degranulation following the binding of IgG-opsonized SE to Fc receptors on the surface of avian heterophils. Peripheral blood heterophils were isolated and exposed to known inhibitors of signal transduction pathways for either 20min (chelerythine, genistein, or verapamil) or 120min (pertussis toxin) at 39 degrees C. The cells were then stimulated for 30min at 39 degrees C with SE opsonized with IgG purified from SE-immune chickens. Phagocytosis, luminol-dependent chemiluminescence (LDCL), and beta-D-glucuronidase release were then evaluated in vitro. The G-protein inhibitor, pertussis toxin, the protein kinase C inhibitor, chelerythine, and the Ca(++) channel blocker, verapamil, markedly reduced phagocytosis in a dose responsive manner. Genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, had no effect on the phagocytosis of the opsonized SE. Both pertussis toxin (66-98%) and verapamil (47-76%) had marked inhibitory effect on LDCL. Chelerythine (13-25%) and genistein (5-25%) had far less biologically significant effects on LDCL. Neither chelerythine nor genistein had a significant effect on degranulation. Verapamil (2-28%) and pertussis toxin (25-29%) had a moderate inhibitory effect on degranulation stimulated by IgG-opsonized SE. As was found with complement receptor mediated activation of heterophils, the binding of Fc receptors by the IgG-SE complex activated distinct signaling pathways that regulate the functional activities of avian heterophils. Pertussis toxin-sensitive, Ca(++)-dependent, G-proteins and protein kinase C-dependent protein phosphorylation play a major role in the phagocytosis of IgG-opsonized SE. Pertussis toxin-sensitive, Ca(++)-dependent, G-proteins appear to regulate LDCL following Fc receptor binding. The signal transduction inhibitors used in these studies did not affect Fc receptor mediated degranulation by avian heterophils.",

On the other hand, CO is required to calculate ITBV. Thus, concerns have been raised with respect to a mathematical coupling of data.

    "63": "Modulation of autonomic activity is considered to be a prognostic marker in patients with cardiovascular disease. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the modulation of sympathovagal balance after single-dose administration of carvedilol using various autonomic tests as challenges of sympathovagal balance. We conducted a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 18 male volunteers and applied a crossover design. While heart rate variability (HRV) remained unchanged in 24-hour measurements, modulatory effects on sympathovagal balance were demonstrated in controlled autonomic maneuvers at expected maximal drug levels of carvedilol: time-dependent HRV parameters indicative of vagal tone were increased during controlled breathing (15 cycles/min) in the supine body position by carvedilol. The percentage of successive normal RR intervals > 50 ms (pNN50) was increased to 39.8+/-5.1 vs. 32.7+/-4.7% in the placebo group (p < 0.05), root mean square successive differences (rMSSD) to 81.5+/-10.8 vs. 69.3+/-9.1 ms (p < 0.05 vs. placebo). In contrast, carvedilol versus placebo significantly reduced time- and frequency-domain parameters after an active standing-up procedure. This included rMSSD (26.5+/-2.8 ms vs. 34.9+/-3.8 ms), pNN50 (6.9+/-2.2% vs. 12.4+/-2.5%). total power (4329+/-592 ms2 vs. 6428+/-1158 ms2), low frequency (1472+/-179 ms2 vs. 2093+/-284 ms2) and high frequency power (251+/-42 ms2 vs. 353+/-92 ms2) of heart rate variability. Apparently, the effects of even small doses of carvedilol, too low to induce effects detectable in the 24-hour analysis of HRV testing, can be detected on controlled maneuvers of autonomic because of their ability to modulate autonomic balance. Under conditions of vagal stimulation, a potentially beneficial augmentation of HRV parameters indicative for this component is induced by carvedilol, while under conditions of sympathetic activation, carvedilol effects seem opposite. Interpretation of the latter results, in particular, requires further investigation.",

This model has the advantage of isolated preparations, with the absence of influence from circulating hormones and haemodynamic reflexes, and also that of in vivo preparations where direct nerve stimulation is possible without the need to use pharmacological agents. Data are presented characterising the preparation with respect to the effects of autonomic nerve stimulation on intrinsic heart rate and atrioventricular conduction at different stimulation frequencies.

    "72": "The pharmacology of neurogenic trigeminovascular vasodilator responses in the dura mater is of interest for understanding the pathophysiology of migraine and to develop new therapies for this disabling common condition. Aminergic mechanisms have been implicated in migraine through direct study of amines in patients, and by inference from the pharmacology of many effective anti-migraine compounds, particularly preventative agents. This study used intravital microscopy to assess the role of aminergic transmission in neurogenic dural vasodilatation (NDV) by measuring directly the diameter of dural arteries in sodium pentobarbitone anaesthetised rats. Electrical stimulation of a closed cranial window produces, by local depolarisation of nerves, dural vessel dilation that is monitored continuously on-line using video-microscopy and a video dimension analyser. This dural vasodilatation was not affected by pre-treatment with an alpha1-adrenoceptor agonist (phenylephrine, 1 and 5 microg/kg), or antagonist (corynanthine, 1 and 2 mg/kg), nor by an alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist (UK14,304, 5 microg/kg) or antagonist (yohimbine, 1 and 3 mg/kg). Similarly, we saw no effect of beta-adrenoceptor blockade (propranolol, 1 and 3 mg/kg). The lack of an inhibitory effect of UK14,304 the model of neurogenic dural vasodilation contrasts with its effect in neurogenic dural plasma protein extravasation model. The lack of inhibition of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in the neurogenic vasodilatation model contrasts with their usefulness as migraine prophylactics, and suggests that their mechanism of action in migraine is unlikely to be through sensory trigeminal fibre terminals at the neurovascular junction. Moreover, the data indicate that the adrenergic system does not play a significant role in neurogenic dural vasodilation.",

The arylalkylamine, (-)-pindolol, also behaved as an agonist with a maximal effect of 57% relative to (+)8-OH-DPAT (100%), and with a pEC50 of 7.2. The selective 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist, N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl)cyclo-hexane carboxamide (WAY100,635), blocked (+)8-OH-DPAT- and (-)-pindolol-induced MAPK activation with pK(B)s of 9.7 and 9.9, respectively, whereas the selective 5-HT(1B) receptor antagonist, 1'-Methyl-5-[2'-methyl-4'-(5-methyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)biphenyl-4-ylcarbonyl]-2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-5H-spiro[furo[2,3-f]indole-3,4'-piperidine] (SB224,289) was inactive. Pertussis toxin blocked the actions of (+)8-OH-DPAT and (-)-pindolol demonstrating implication of G(i)/G(o) proteins.

In recent years, results of several observational studies have suggested that these drugs may not be as safe or effective as other available therapies, such as diuretics and beta-blockers, in the prevention of cardiovascular events. The Nordic Diltiazem (NORDIL) and the International Nifedipine GITS Study: Intervention as a Goal in Hypertension Treatment (INSIGHT) studies were the first two randomized interventional trials in hypertensive patients that directly compared the effects of therapy based on calcium antagonists with those of diuretic and beta-blocker-based treatment on major cardiovascular endpoints. Both studies found that the effectiveness of calcium antagonist therapy was similar to that of diuretic and beta-blocker therapy for preventing the composite primary endpoint of fatal and nonfatal stroke, myocardial infarction, and other cardiovascular death. The two studies shared several nonsignificant trends for cause-specific events, including greater stroke prevention and lesser coronary event prevention in the calcium antagonist groups compared with the diuretic and beta-blocker groups. There is not yet sufficient evidence to prove whether cause-specific differences exist. Results of the NORDIL and INSIGHT studies support incorporating calcium antagonist-based therapy as an additional safe and effective approach for preventing blood pressure-related illness and death.", 
    "75": "Portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG) causes both acute and chronic blood loss from the gastrointestinal tract in patients with portal hypertension. Gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE) is a distinct condition also associated with portal hypertension that can cause acute and chronic upper gastrointestinal blood loss. These conditions frequently, but not invariably, are diagnosed by upper endoscopy. Although they are fairly prevalent, only 15% to 20% of subjects experience symptomatic gastrointestinal blood loss. Acute gastrointestinal bleeding from PHG should first be treated with octreotide (100 mg bolus intravenously, followed by a 50 mg/h continuous intravenous infusion). If the bleeding does not stop or slow down appreciably within 24 to 48 hours, propranolol may be administered orally to those patients who are hemodynamically stable. Propranolol should be started at 40 mg/d orally in two divided doses. If the patient can tolerate the propranolol and is still bleeding, the dosage may be titrated up to the maximum tolerated amount. For those subjects who are unable to tolerate beta-blockers or continue to bleed despite beta-blocker therapy, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is the next line of treatment. Portal decompressive surgery is reserved for those who are not candidates for TIPS and where the appropriate expertise is available. Prevention of chronic gastrointestinal blood loss from PHG should be attempted with beta-blockers, with the dosage titrated up to achieve a resting heart rate of approximately 60 beats per minute. In patients who do not respond to beta-blockers, a TIPS should be placed. The role of long-acting release octreotide in this setting is experimental. The primary treatment of actively bleeding GAVE as well as recurrent bleeding from GAVE is endoscopic ablation of the lesion using either argon plasma coagulation, neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser, or heater probe. TIPS and beta-blockers are ineffective for the long-term prevention of recurrent bleeding from GAVE. For selected patients with severe recurrent bleeding or uncontrollable acute bleeding from GAVE, an antrectomy with Billroth I anastomosis may be considered.",

Arterial blood was drawn for plasma lactate, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and gas analysis. Lactate, glycogen, glucose 6-phosphate, ATP, phosphocreatine, and intracellular Na(+) and K(+) were determined in extensor digitorum longus and soleus muscles. For comparison, muscles were exposed to epinephrine and/or ouabain in vitro.",

Adrenergic blockade significantly reduced plasma lactate concentration. In shocked rats, adrenergic blockade significantly reduced muscle lactate and glucose 6-phosphate accumulation. Intracellular Na(+):K(+) ratio was decreased in SN rats, implying increased Na(+)-K(+) pump activity. Adrenergic blockade raised the intracellular Na(+):K(+) ratio in shocked animals, implying decreased pump activity. Epinephrine exposure in vitro stimulated muscle lactate production, raised glucose 6-phosphate content, and significantly reduced soleus phosphocreatine stores.",

Adrenergic blockade concurrently reduced plasma lactate, muscle levels of lactate and glucose 6-phosphate, and muscle Na(+)-K(+) pump activity during shock. Rapid skeletal muscle aerobic glycolysis in response to increased plasma epinephrine levels may be an important contributor to increased glycolysis in muscle and increased plasma lactate during hemorrhagic shock.",

Mean DFT was significantly lower using the shorter P2 (9.5 +/- 4.5 J vs 11.3 +/- 5.2 J; P < 0.0001). According to subgroup analysis, the effect of changing P2 duration was only influenced by antiarrhythmic treatment. DFT decreased markedly using the shorter P2 in patients treated with amiodarone (10.7 +/- 4.9 J vs 13.4 +/- 5.6 J; P < 0.00001) or d,l-sotalol (6.1 +/- 3.3 J vs 9.1 +/- 4.6 J; P < 0.05).

LV monophasic APD at 50% and 90% repolarization (MAPD(50) and MAPD(90)) and refractoriness were determined at low (9+/-3 mL) and high (39+/-4 mL) load before and after beta-adrenergic blockade. During control, the MAPD(50) decreased from 193+/-26 to 184+/-26 ms with increased load, as did the MAPD(90) (238+/-28 to 233+/-28 ms), P</=0.04. Similar changes were observed in ventricular refractoriness. Treatment with propranolol completely abolished these load-induced effects. Myocardial catecholamine depletion with reserpine in 2 hearts also abolished changes in MAPD and excitability in response to increased preload.", 
    "89": "Increases in ventricular load mediate a decrease in ventricular APD and refractoriness through activation of the beta-adrenergic receptor. An increase in a cAMP-mediated K(+) current, possibly the slowly activating delayed rectifier I(Ks), may account in part for this form of mechanoelectrical coupling.", 
    "90": "FK409 decomposes and releases nitric oxide (NO) spontaneously when it is dissolved in phosphate buffer solution at 37 degrees C. With the use of this NO donor, the effect of exogenous NO on cardiac contractility was examined by assessing Emax. alpha-chloralose-anaesthetized dogs were instrumented for measurements of left ventricular (LV) pressure and volume and coronary blood flow (CBF) in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). FK409, 8-bromoguanosine-cyclic-monophosphate (8-Br-cGMP) and papaverine were infused into the LAD, and Emax was determined by transient inferior vena cava occlusion when CBF was increased and reached its peak. Neither drug affected heart rate nor LV pressure just before the measurement of Emax. FK409 increased CBF and decreased Emax in a dose-dependent manner. 8-Br-cGMP also increased CBF and decreased Emax in a dose-dependent manner. Pretreating with propranolol did not affect the effects of FK4098-Br-cGMP on CBF and Emax. Papaverine increased mean CBF but did not affect Emax. In conclusion NO attenuates cardiac contractility in vivo, while increasing CBF. This effect seems to be mediated by cyclic-guanosine monophosphate, a second messenger of NO.", 
    "91": "During ischemia, large amounts of catecholamine are released to the myocardium from the sympathetic nerve endings in the heart. It has not been clearly shown whether the released catecholamine has detrimental or beneficial effects on postischemic myocardial contractile function. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of endogenous catecholamine released during ischemia on myocardial contractile function, using ferret papillary muscles in a stimulated ischemia model. Papillary muscles were excised and mounted in organ baths containing oxygenated physiological salt solution at 37 degrees C. In order to eliminate the effect of endogenous catecholamine, a subset of animals was reserpinized for 2 days prior to the experiments. Muscles were stabilized for 1 h, and stretched to the length at which maximal isometric tension developed. Ischemia was simulated by changing the solution to liquid fluorocarbon bubbled with 95% N2 and 5% CO2. After 20 min of ischemia, the bathing medium was replaced with oxygenated physiological salt solution and developed tension was measured for 60 min. Pharmacologic agents with specific effects on myocardial autonomic pathways were used to investigate the cellular mechanisms of the observed effects. Tension recovery of reserpinized muscles was significantly better than control muscles (65.5 +/- 2.8% vs. 54.9 +/- 5.0%, P < 0.01). Exogenously administered beta-adrenergic antagonists did not attenuate stunning in control muscles; whereas forskolin and carbachol exacerbated stunning. These results indicate that catecholamine released during ischemia exacerbates myocardial stunning and overrides the effect of clinically relevant concentrations of beta-adrenergic antagonists, which may limit their ability to protect myocardium from acute ischemic insult. The effect of endogenous catecholamine was simulated by forskolin, but not attenuated by carbachol, which suggests that changes in the contractile apparatus activated by excess cyclic AMP were relevant to the mechanical dysfunction that developed.", 
    "92": "Heart failure treatment has markedly changed during the last few decades, with demonstration of benefit of afterload reduction by vasodilator therapy and introduction of the concept of the deleterious consequences of the neuro-hormonal compensatory stimulation. Blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors, initially contra-indicated in heart failure, provide a marked reduction of mortality and morbidity in combination with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, as demonstrated in many clinical trials. We performed a review of all clinical trials that compare beta-blockers vs. placebo in chronic heart failure. Beta-blockers with different pharmacological profiles have been tested, mainly metoprolol, bisoprolol, bucindolol and carvedilol. With progressive dose increment, tolerance of such treatment was generally good, left ventricular function improved, hospitalisations for heart failure were less frequent and mortality was reduced. The meta-analysis of the 16 randomised trials, with at least one death in each treatment group, provides a 24% relative risk reduction for such hospitalisations (95% CI=19%-29%) and 22% reduction for mortality (95% CI=16%-28%). Heterogeneity of beta-blocker effect for mortality was found and related to the non-significant benefit obtained in the BEST trial with bucindolol. When such a trial is excluded, the effect model analysis shows that relative risk reduction (beta-blocker induced benefit) is constant whatever the severity of the disease. The mechanism of beta-blocker induced benefit remains unclear, but is at least partly related to left ventricular function improvement and prevention of severe ventricular arrhythmias. In conclusion, beta-blocker treatment has become an established therapy for heart failure, in combination with diuretics and ACE inhibitors. Complementary informations will be needed to clarify the mechanism of benefit and to define the best therapeutic strategy according to the individual characteristics of patients with heart failure.", 
    "93": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are among the first-choice drugs for treating hypertension and congestive heart disease. It has been reported, however, that these drugs could induce chronic cough and airway hyperresponsiveness. The aim of this work was to assess in pigs the effects of bradykinin and tachykinins on citric-acid-induced coughing after ACE inhibitor pretreatment. Coughing was induced by challenging pigs with an aerosol of 0.8 M citric acid over 15 min. Coughs were counted by a trained observer for 30 min. The animals underwent two cough induction tests two days apart (days 1 and 3), the first being taken as a control. All drugs were injected intravenously 30 min before the second challenge. In the control group, no difference was observed between days 1 and 3. The ACE inhibitor enalapril (7.5 and 15 microg/kg) caused the cough frequency to increase significantly. In contrast, a dose-related decrease was observed with Hoe140 (icatibant), a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist (0.5 and 1 mg/kg). When both drugs were administered simultaneously (15 microg/kg for enalapril and 1 mg/kg for Hoe140), a significant increase was observed as compared with the control value obtained on day 1. When enalapril was combined with the three tachykinin receptor antagonists SR 140333 (NK1 receptor antagonist), SR 48968 (NK2 receptor antagonist) and SR 142801 (NK3 receptor antagonist), a significant decrease was observed as compared with control value obtained on day 1; the percentage of variation was also significantly different as compared with those observed in enalapril groups at both doses. These data suggest that ACE-inhibitor-induced enhancement of the cough reflex is mainly due to tachykinins and not to bradykinin in our pig model. Bradykinin, however, plays a major role in coughing induced by citric acid alone.",

Each of these drugs possesses at least one chiral center, and an inherent high degree of enantioselectivity in binding to the beta-adrenergic receptor. For beta-blockers with a single chiral center, the (-) enantiomer possesses much greater affinity for binding to the beta-adrenergic receptors than antipode. The enantiomers of some of these drugs possess other effects, such as antagonism at alpha-adrenergic receptors or Class III antiarrhythmic activity. However, these effects generally display a lower level of stereoselectivity than the beta-blocking activity. Except for timolol, all of these drugs used systemically are administered clinically as the racemate. As a class, the beta blockers are quite diverse from a pharmacokinetic perspective, as they display a high range of values in plasma protein binding, percent of drug eliminated by metabolism or unchanged in the urine, and in hepatic extraction ratio. With respect to plasma concentrations attained after oral or intravenous dosing, in most cases the enantiomers of the beta-blockers show only a modest degree of stereoselectivity. However, the relative magnitude of the concentrations of the enantiomers in plasma is not constant in all situations and varies from drug to drug. Further, various factors related to the drug (e.g., dosing rate or enantiomer-enantiomer interaction) or the patient (e.g., racial background, cardiovascular function, or the patient metabolic phenotype) may affect the stereospecific pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of beta-blockers. An understanding of the stereospecific pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of beta-blockers may help clinicians to interpret and predict differences among patients in pharmacologic responses to these drugs.",

One month after the addition of atenolol, all patients underwent a second ABPM session. There were no differences between the obese and lean subjects in baseline systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP), or mean arterial pressures (MAP) measured by office recording or ABPM. However, obese subjects had higher heart rates than lean subjects (87.5+/-2.4 v 76.8+/-4.9 beats/min).

The present study shows that in hypertensive patients with LVH, antihypertensive treatment with atenolol, enalapril and SR-V reduces LVH and decreases the prevalence of CA and TEMI. Treatment with HCTZ during the 6-month study did not alter LVH and did not appear to reduce CA and TEMI.",

Using multivariate models, we assessed the relation between physician characteristics and initiation of beta-adrenergic blocking agent therapy, controlling for patient characteristics and cardiac treatments.", 
    "137": "Sixty-two percent of patients filled a prescription for beta-adrenergic blocking agents within 7 days of hospital discharge. Physician characteristics, including specialty and region of hospitalization, were independently associated with the use beta-adrenergic blocking agents. Family practice physicians and other noninternists were much less likely than cardiologists to prescribe beta-adrenergic blocking agents. The other most important predictors of the use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents were region of hospitalization and patient age.",

    "139": "Moyamoya is a rare disease characterized by fibrous dysplasia of the internal carotid and proximal cerebral arteries, which has been described mainly in young Japanese. We present a case of Moyamoya disease with renal artery involvement in a young male patient with an African origin. A 15-year-old boy was referred to our hospital due to uncontrolled blood pressure, headache, somnolence, cognitive deficit and multiple lacunar infarcts in the computed tomography. Cerebral arteriography showed the absence of the normal vascular anatomy at the level of the circle of Willis. The intracranial vessels presented severe stenosis or were occluded and replaced by an extensive network of ectasic collateral vessels. Abdominal ultrasound examination identified asymmetric kidneys, and renal arteriography showed a tight stenosis of the ostium and proximal segment of right main artery, which was only partially relieved by balloon angioplasty. A saphenous bypass from aorta to the right renal artery re-established the renal blood flow. Blood pressure dropped after surgery and was controlled with low doses of diuretic and beta-blocker. After arteriography he presented right hemiplegia, with partial recovering in the following months. In conclusion, we described the first case of Moyamoya disease with concomitant renovascular disease in a young adult of African origin, an association that may be more frequent than usually suspected in clinical practice.", 
    "140": "There is controversy regarding the nervous control of retinal blood vessels in humans. Most in vitro studies indicate that the intraocular part of the central retinal artery lacks autonomic innervation. We investigated the response of retinal vessels to isometric exercise during blockade of beta-receptors (propranolol) or muscarinic receptors (atropine).", 
    "141": "Twelve healthy subjects performed squatting for 6 min during infusion of either propranolol atropine or placebo. Blood pressure and pulse rate were measured non-invasively. Retinal vessel diameters were measured continuously using the Zeiss Retinal Vessel Analyser.", 
    "142": "Squatting induced a significant increase in blood pressure and pulse rate, which was paralleled by a decrease in retinal vein and artery diameters. Atropine did not change the retinal vessel response to isometric exercise. Propranolol significantly blunted the exercise-induced vasoconstriction in retinal arteries.",

    "144": "The olfactory G protein G(alphaolf) differs from the short splice variant of G(salpha) (G(salphaS)) in 80 amino acids, but little is known about biochemical differences between G(alphaolf) and G(salphaS). We addressed this question by analyzing fusion proteins of the beta2-adrenoceptor (beta2AR) and G(alphaolf) and G(salphaS), respectively, using Sf9 insect cells as expression system. The fusion ensured defined receptor/G protein stoichiometry and efficient coupling. High-affinity agonist binding studies showed that G(alphaolf) possesses a lower GDP-affinity than G(salphaS) As a result, the agonist-free beta2AR and the beta2AR occupied by partial agonists were more efficient at promoting GDP-dissociation from G(alphaolf) than from G(salphaS) a assessed by guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) binding, adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity and GTP hydrolysis. Basal AC activity in the absence of GTP was almost sixfold lower in membranes expressing beta2AR-G(alphaolf) than in membranes expressing beta2AR-G(salphaS) at similar levels, reflecting the lower abundance of G(alphaolf-GDP) relative to G(salphaS-GDP). The maximum agonist-stimulated AC activity with beta2AR-G(salphaS) was more than twofold higher than with beta2AR-G(alphaolf), but the relative agonist-stimulation of AC with beta2AR-G(alphaolf) was much greater than with beta2AR-G(salphaS). The difference in maximum AC activity can be explained by more rapid deactivation of G(alphaolf-GTP) by GTP hydrolysis and GTP dissociation relative to G(salphaS-GTP). Taken together, there are biochemical differences between G(alphaolf) and G(salphaS), supporting different roles of these G proteins in vivo.",

After 17 days on average beta-blocker treated infants (propranolol:1,6 mg/kg/day) improved significantly with respect to Ross heart failure score (3.3+/-2.3 vs. 8.3+/-1.9, P=0.002), lower renin levels (338+/-236 vs. 704+/-490 microU/l, P=0.008) and lower mean heart rates in Holter ECG (118+/-10 vs. 142+/-11 beats/min, P<0.001). While digoxin and diuretic treated infants had unchanged mean heart rate (149+/-8 vs. 148+/-10 beats/min), less decrease of symptoms (Ross Score: 8.5+/-1.7 vs. 6.8+/-2.3, P=0.02) but a significant increase of renin levels (139+/-102 vs. 938+/-607 microU/l, P=0.001).",

At the beginning of the treatment the patient was in NYHA functional class IV and presented with severe global left ventricular hypokinesia with an ejection fraction of 15%. Carvedilol was started at a dose of 3.125 mg twice daily and progressively increased to 12.5 mg twice daily. Six months later the left ventricular volumes had become almost normal, wall motion abnormalities had completely reversed and the ejection fraction was markedly increased (62%). The patient was classified in NYHA functional class II. This case shows the recovery of left ventricular systolic function during the administration of carvedilol in an old patient with dilated cardiomyopathy and chronic congestive heart failure.", 
    "149": "The purpose of these studies was to identify the role of phospholipases in the activation of macrophages by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Tricyclodecan-9-yl-xanthogenate (D609), an inhibitor of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC); butanol, an inhibitor of phosphatidylcholine phospholipase D (PC-PLD); and propranolol, an inhibitor of phosphatidate phosphohydrolase, were used in the study. Treatment of RAW264.7 murine macrophage-like cells with LPS resulted in expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. The expression was partially inhibited by D609, butanol, or propranolol and was completely blocked by the combination of D609 and butanol. RAW264.7 cells constitutively produced low basal levels of diacylglycerol and phosphatidic acid; production of both was significantly increased after stimulation with LPS, reaching a peak in 2-3 min and remaining elevated after 30 min. In LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells, diacylglycerol was suppressed by each of the three inhibitors alone and almost abolished by D609 plus butanol or D609 plus propranolol. Phosphatidic acid was reduced to basal level by butanol after LPS stimulation for 2.5 min and by butanol plus D609 after LPS stimulation for 2.5 or 10 min. Taken together, these data indicate that activation of RAW264.7 cells by LPS can be mediated by the activities of both PC-PLC and PC-PLD.", 
    "150": "We searched for compounds that are pharmacologically active on ureteral motility for treating ureteral colic to ease retrograde access into the ureter and improve the clearance of stones or stone particles from the ureter. The effects of the alpha1-adrenergic receptor agonist phenylephrine, the nonselective beta and beta2-adrenergic receptor agonists isoproterenol and fenoterol, and the phosphodiesterase inhibitors papaverine (nonspecific) and rolipram (type IV) on the frequency and amplitude of ureteral contractions when administered intravenously or topically were investigated in pigs.", 
    "151": "A total of 52 pigs were anesthetized. A double lumen 6Fr catheter was inserted through each renal pelvis and into the ureter, allowing perfusion of saline or drug solution into the renal pelvis and the recording of contractions from the mid portion of the ureter.", 
    "152": "The alpha1 and beta-adrenergic receptors of the ureter are not tonically activated by endogenous epinephrine or norepinephrine. Phenylephrine administered intravenously at a dose of 0.01 to 3 mg./kg. and topically at 0.1 to 3 mg./ml. per minute increased contraction frequency 10 and 4-fold, respectively, and contraction amplitude 2-fold each in a dose dependent manner. Arterial blood pressure increased markedly during intravenous administration of phenylephrine but was minimally affected during topical application. The phenylephrine effects were reversed by the antagonist prazosin. Isoproterenol administered intravenously at a dose of 0.01 to 10 mg./kg. and topically at 0.1 to 200 microg./ml. per minute decreased contraction frequency to 13% and 31% of controls, respectively. Contraction amplitude was not affected by intravenous administration but decreased to 59% of controls when applied topically. These effects were also observed with a slight delay in the saline perfused contralateral ureter. The heart rate also increased, suggesting absorption of the drug by the urothelium. The isoproterenol effects were blocked by the antagonist propranolol. Fenoterol administered intravenously at a dose of 0.1 to 30 microg./kg. and topically at 0.003 to 1 mg./ml. per minute decreased contraction frequency to 14% and 10% of controls, and contraction amplitude to 84% and 65%, respectively. These effects on the drug perfused ureter were also observed on the contralateral saline perfused ureter but to a lesser extent. The fenoterol effects were blocked by the antagonist propranolol. Papaverine administered intravenously at a dose of 0.001 to 3 mg./kg. decreased contraction frequency to 33% of controls. Topically administered papaverine as well as intravenous and topically administered rolipram had no relevant effect on ureteral motility.", 
    "153": "Intravenous phenylephrine increases, and isoproterenol and fenoterol decrease the frequency and amplitude of ureteral contractions in the pig. The same effects are observed with the topical administration of phenylephrine, which causes a significant local but not systemic side effect. Topical administration of isoproterenol and fenoterol produced local as well as systemic effects, suggesting absorption by the urothelium. However, to our knowledge a drug that relaxes ureteral peristalsis in pigs without causing systemic side effects has not yet been identified.", 
    "154": "Persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (PHHI) is a genetic disorder characterized by excess secretion of insulin and hypoglycemia. In most patients, the disease is caused by mutations in sulfonylurea receptor-1 (SUR1), which, in association with Kir6.2, constitutes the functional ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channel of the pancreatic beta-cell. Previous studies reported that coexpression of the PHHI mutant R1394H-SUR1 with Kir6.2 in COS cells produces no functional channels. To investigate if the loss of function could be due to impaired trafficking of mutant channels to the cell membrane, we have cotransfected wild-type and mutant SUR1 subunits with Kir6.2 into HEK293 cells and examined their cellular localization by immunofluorescent staining. Our results show that unlike the wild-type subunits, which showed fluorescence at the cell surface, the mutant subunits displayed fluorescence in punctate structures. Co-immunostaining with antibodies against organelle-specific marker proteins identified these structures as the trans-Golgi network. Limited localization in clathrin-positive, but transferrin receptor-negative vesicles was also observed. The post-endoplasmic reticulum localization suggests that the mutation does not impair the folding and assembly of the channels so as to cause its retention by the endoplasmic reticulum. Diazoxide, a K(ATP) channel opener drug that is used in the treatment of PHHI, restored the surface expression in a manner that could be prevented by the channel blocker glibenclamide. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, R1394H-SUR1 formed functional channels with Kir6.2, indicating that the primary consequence of the mutation is impairment of trafficking rather than function. Thus, our data uncover a novel mechanism underlying the therapeutic action of diazoxide in the treatment of PHHI, i.e. its ability to recruit channels to the membrane. Furthermore, this is the first report to describe a trafficking disorder effecting retention of mutant proteins in the trans-Golgi network.", 
    "155": "We investigated the combination of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) with the beta-adrenoceptor/serotonin 1A (5-HT(1A)) antagonist pindolol, based on the concept that 5-HT(1A) receptor blockade would eliminate the need for desensitization of presynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptors and therefore hasten the onset of action and improve the efficacy of SSRIs. However, since pindolol plasma levels after 2.5 mg three times a day are about 60 nmol/L, and the K(i) for the 5-HT(1A) receptor is 30 nmol/L, it is questionable whether pindolol levels in the brain would be sufficient to antagonize 5-HT(1A) receptors. Using microdialysis in the guinea pig, we correlated brain and plasma levels of pindolol with its capability of augmenting paroxetine-induced increases in brain 5-HT levels. In addition, central beta-receptor antagonism of pindolol was studied by investigating blockade of beta-agonist-induced increases in brain cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) formation.", 
    "156": "Using microdialysis and jugular vein catheterization, we studied the ability of systemically administered pindolol to antagonize central 5-HT(1A) and beta-adrenoceptors, while simultaneously monitoring pindolol plasma and brain concentrations.", 
    "157": "Augmentation of paroxetine-induced increases in extracellular 5-HT levels in the ventral hippocampus was only observed at steady state plasma levels exceeding 7000 nmol/L (concurrent brain levels 600 nmol/L). In contrast, antagonism of beta-agonist-induced increases of brain cAMP levels was already observed at pindolol plasma levels of 70 nmol/L (concurrent brain levels < 3 nmol/L).", 
    "158": "At plasma levels that are observed in patients after 2.5 mg three times a day ( approximately 60 nmol/L), pindolol produces only a partial blockade of presynaptic 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors and does not augment the SSRI-induced 5-HT increase in the guinea pig brain. It is therefore very unlikely that the favorable effects of combining pindolol with SSRIs, as reported in a number of clinical studies, are due to 5-HT(1A) antagonism. Since pindolol completely blocks central beta-adrenoreceptors at clinically relevant plasma levels, it is possible that beta-adrenoceptor antagonism is involved in mediating pindolol's beneficial effects.", 
    "159": "We report the case of a 31-year-old man with Graves' disease who manifested malignant hyperthermia during subtotal thyroidectomy. His past medical history and family history were unremarkable. Before surgery, his condition was well controlled with propylthiouracil, beta-adrenergic blocker and iodine. During the operation, anesthesia was induced by intravenous injection of vecuronium and thiopental, followed by suxamethonium for endotracheal intubation. Anesthesia was maintained with nitrous oxide and sevoflurane. One hour after induction of anesthesia, his end tidal carbon dioxide concentration (ET(CO2)) increased from 40 to 50 mmHg, heart rate increased from 90 to 100 beats per min and body temperature began to rise at a rate of 0.3 degrees C per 15 min. Suspecting thyroid storm, propranolol 0.4 mg and methylprednisolone 1,500 mg were administered, which, however, had little effect. Despite the lack of muscular rigidity, the diagnosis of malignant hyperthermia was made based on respiratory acidosis. Sevoflurane was discontinued and dantrolene was given by intravenous bolus. Soon after the treatment, ET(CO2), heart rate and body temperature started to fall to normal levels. His laboratory findings showed abnormally elevated serum creatine phosphokinase and myoglobin but normal thyroid hormone levels. Since dantrolene is efficacious in thyrotoxic crisis and malignant hyperthermia, an immediate intravenous administration of dantrolene should be considered when a hypermetabolic state occurs during anesthesia in surgical treatment for a patient with Graves' disease.", 
    "160": "The aim of this study was the assessment of physiological venous reflexes in 40 glaucoma patients treated with topically applied timolol maleate 0.50% and betaxolol HCL 0.50%. They were divided into two groups of twenty each; one group being given timolol and the other betaxolol. The assessment of the venous tone was performed by testing venous reflexes. We found no statistically significant difference between timolol and betaxolol; however, when the influence of circulating catecholamines and the other vasoactive substances was excluded by suprasphygmatic insufflation of a pediatric cuff, a significant difference was found in the Valsalva's maneuver (125.5 +/- 8.1 vs 85.0 +/- 34.3 venoconstrictive units VCUs, p = 0.03). The IOP was significantly decreased in both treatment group, although the pressure reduction effect was more pronounced in the timolol group. Our study suggests that timolol and betaxolol have a slightly different mode of action on the venous side of circulation under topical medications. It is possible that the use of betaxolol topically may reduce a systemic venoconstriction."
