Methyl chloroform decreased vascular resistance even in intact preparations. Spontaneous blood flow in the intact femoral artery decreased following FC 11 and methyl chloroform administration in vagotomized preparations and was associated with marked decrease in mean aortic pressure. Blockade of alpha and beta adrenergic receptors with phentolamine and propranolol in the vagotomized preparation had no modifying influence of the effect of FC 11 and methyl chloroform. It may be concluded from this study that FC 11, FC 12 and FC 114 exhibit a vasodepressor activity on skeletal muscle vascular bed which is readily overcome by the hypotension-induced activation of the sympathetic system but which becomes evident when reflex activity is prevented by vagotomy. Methly choloroform exhibits a vasodepressor effect even in intact preparations probably because of concomitant depression of reflex activity through its general anesthetic action. A decrease in spontaneous femoral blood flow following FC 11 and methyl chloroform administration is referable to the accompanying severe hypotension notwithstanding concomitant vascular relaxation. Neither FC 11 nor methly chloroform directly liberate catecholamines from their sites of storage.", 
    "1": "Administration of propranolol directly into the anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery (LAD) resulted in a localized increase in myocardial contractile force in the area of the left ventricle perfused by the LAD. The onset of the positive inotropic response occurred within 30 seconds after drug administration with a duration of action of approximately 8 minutes and was associated with a significant increase in the coronary sinus/arterial ratio of norepinephrine. Contractile force in an area of the left ventricle perfused by the circumflex artery decreased concomitantly with the characteristic negative chronotropic action of propranolol. Pretreatment with reserpine abolished the positive inotropic effect of propranolol while ganglionic blockade with hexamethonium failed to alter the character of the response. Imipramine pretreatment not only blocked the positive inotropic effect of propranolol but resulted in an exaggerated negative inotropic effect in both areas of the left ventricle along with a significant fall in systemic arterial blood pressure. The data demonstrate that propranolol can evoke the release of norepinephrine from cardiac adrenergic nerve endings and raise the possibility that propranolol may be taken up by the amine uptake system.", 
    "2": "Repeated s.c. injections of L-adrenaline (4 X 0.5 mg/kg body weight) increased the urinary clearance of lithium in intact rats and in adrenalectomized animals. Adrenaline also increased the fractional excretion of lithium in adrenalectomized rats; an effect that was prevented by repeated s.c. injections of the alpha-adrenergic blocking agent phentolamine (4 X 1 mg/kg body weight). When administered alone, propranolol and phentolamine decreased the urinary clearance of lithium in adrenalectomized rats. The drug-induced changes in the urinary clearance of lithium were not directly related to the effects of the drugs on the urinary elimination of sodium, potassium, creatine and water. The results suggest that the action of adrenaline on renal lithium elimination in adrenalectomized rats might be mediated by alpha-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "3": "Evidence for the role of alpha-adrenoceptors in the production of a positive inotropic effect has been obtained chiefly in heart preparations stimulated at a low rate (1 or 1.4 Hz). However, our previous results suggested that the alpha-receptor-mediated positive inotropic effect could be frequency dependent. In the present study cumulative concentration-inotropic effect curves were obtained in guinea pig ventricle strips treated with adrenaline and stimulated at 1 and at 2.5 Hz. Phentolamine (3 X 10(-6) M) and practolol (10(-6) M) were employed as antagonists. Phentolamine antagonized the effect of low concentrations of adrenaline (10(-9)-10(-8) M) in preparations driven at 1 Hz, but did not modify the curve of the agonist at the higher stimulation rate. In preparations driven at 1 Hz, practolol antagonized the effect of adrenaline at concentration above 3 X 10(-8) M without affecting the curve at lower concentrations, the beta-blocker competitively anatagonized the effect of the agonist at 2.5 Hz. It was concluded that a shortening of the interval between beats abolishes the alpha-mediated positive inotropic effect.", 
    "4": "In experiments designed to determine the nature of the coronary dilator effect of serotonin the influence of intracoronary administration of the amine on coronary perfusion pressure, heart rate and ventricular contractile force was assessed in anesthetized open-chest dogs in which the left coronary artery was perfused with blood at a constant rate. Serotonin elicited dose-related decreases in coronary perfusion pressure and increases in contractile force, and lowered heart rate slightly. The dilator response was antagonized by methysergide, slightly potentiated by practolol and unaffected by reserpine. The inotropic effect was partially antagonized by methysergide and completely blocked by practolol and reserpine. It is concluded that serotonin induces coronary dilatation by direct stimulation of specific receptors that this effect is independent of the cardiac stimulation produced by the amine, and the latter response is mediated through beta1-adrenoceptors activated by released norepinephrine.", 
    "5": "40 patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia were allocated to two different treatment groups according to their year of birth. Those patients born on odd years were given 5 mg of practolol intravenously, those born on even years receiving 5 mg of verapamil, and if the tachycardia continued, the same injection was repeated after 5 minutes. If practolol treatment failed, the patient was given 5 mg of verapamil half an hour later, and vice versa. Verapamil restored sinus rhythm in 19 patients out of 20. Practolol proved effective in 8 out of 20. In patients who were switched over to the other treatment verapamil was effective in 9 out of 11 and practolol in 1 patient. Side effects were few. Marked hypotension occurred in 2 patients, in 1 patient after 5 mg of verapamil, and after 5 mg of practolol in the other. It is concluded that verapamil is a very effective agent in the treatment of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Selection of patients is emphasized to increase the safety of its use.", 
    "6": "The hemodynamic effects of verapamil and practolol were investigated in a group of 10 selected patients (7 with coronary artery disease) undergoing cardiac catherization. The drugs were given i.v. in a dose of 0.1 mg/kg, alone or in combination, before and after controling the heart rate by atrial pacing. Measured hemodynamic parameters included aortic and left ventricular pressure and its first derivative, cardiac output, and echocardiographically derived left ventricular dimensions. Each drug given individually caused minor hemodynamic changes, but the combination of practolol and verapamil when the heart rate was fixed by atrial pacing invaribly caused a reduction in LV dp/dt max which was independent of preload and afterload. It is concluded that both drugs have a mildly negative inotropic effect when administered at this dose intravenously to patients with normal or mildly impaired left ventricular function. The myocardial depression was more apparent when practolol preceded verpamil. Caution must be exercised when using these drugs in combination in patients with impaired myocardial function.", 
    "7": "The disposition of propoxyphene and propranolol was studied in children by means of two protocols which minimized the number of blood samples taken from each child. Propoxyphene and its metabolite, norpropoxyphene, were measured in two plasma samples obtained from different children at various times after a single oral dose. These data were pooled and a plasma concentration/time curve was obtained which was consistent with an average T 1/2 of 3.5 hr in this population. The bioavailability of tablets and a solution of propranolol was compared with a crossover design by obtaining plasma samples at the end of the dosage interval during chronic oral administration of various doses. No clear differences in the bioavailability of the two formulations could be detected. Both drugs showed marked interindividual differences in plasma concentrations following oral administration. These findings are consistent with the high hepatic extraction ratio and large presystemic (first pass) effect previously described in adults. The large individual variability supports the concept of monitoring plasma levels as an aid to therapy and demonstrates that the use of a weight-adjusted dose in children can be only an approximation for initial treatment.", 
    "8": "1 A method is described for measuring responses of dog tracheal musculature and vasculature in situ. 2 The upper two thirds of the trachea was perfused with blood through both cranial thyroid arteries at a constant pressure. The blood flow through the arteries was measured with an electromagnetic flowmeter. The response of the tracheal musculature was measured as a change in pressure in a water-filled cuff inserted into the trachea via the mouth. Drugs were injected close-arterially. 3 Acetylcholine produced dose-dependent increases in blood flow rate (vasodilatation) and in tracheal intraluminal pressure (tracheal constriction). These responses were antagonized by atropine. 4 Isoprenaline produced vasodilatation which was blocked by propranolol. Adrenaline and noradrenaline caused vasocontriction which was blocked by phentolamine. 5 All three catecholamines produced a decrease in tracheal intraluminal pressure (tracheal dilatation). The tracheal dilatation in response to adrenaline and noradrenaline was converted to constriction by propranolol. The tracheal constriction thus unmasked was abolished specifically by phentolamine. 6 From these results it is concluded that the tracheal musculature and vasculature contain muscarinic receptors, and excitatory alpha- and inhibitory beta-adrenoceptors. In the tracheal musculature beta-adrenoceptors predominate over alpha-adrenoceptors; the reverse is true in the tracheal vasculature.", 
    "9": "The clinical, left ventricular and coronary angiographic data, and the technetium-99m stannous pyrophosphate (99mTc-PYP) myocardial scintigraphic results are presented in 31 patients with unstable angina pectoris. One-third of these patients had positive 99mTc-PYP myocardial scintigrams in a pattern suggesting limited and diffuse subendocardial necrosis. The positive 99mTc-PYP myocardial scintigrams occurred without diagnostic electrocardiographic and cardiac enzyme changes suggestive of myocardial infarction; positive scintigrams seemed to occur more commonly in patients with continuing pain after admission and in those without previous history of myocardial infarction. The positive 99mTc-PYP myocardial scintigrams did not correctly predict coronary anatomical patterns except that positive scintigrams occurred only in patients with coronary artery disease. Neither did the positive scintigrams necessarily occur in that group of patients with the poorest ventricular function though the 2 patients with the lowest ejection fractions both had positive 99mTc-PYP myocardial scintigrams. Finally, when positive 99mTc-PYP scintigrams are the only evidence suggestive of limited subendocardial infarction in patients with unstable angina pectoris, they do not appear to have any prognostic significance in terms of longevity or response to pharmacological or surgical therapy, though the follow-up period so far is short.", 
    "10": "Specific effects of \"per se\" hydrostatic pressure on mean heart rate have been studied on eels (Anguilla anguilla L.), both untreated and treated with atropine and propranolol, and on isolated eel's heart. Because temperature brings, by itself, heart rate modifications in fish, a quantitative study was performed in order to take away the increment of heart rate due to the water warming, which cannot entirely be suppressed during compression. The specific effects of \"per se\" pressure have been identified as a bradycardia above 24.5 degrees C and as a tachycardia below this temperature. The use of atropine and propranol, which abolish extrinsic heart control, shows that pressure acts both through extrinsic mechanisms of heart control and through a direct action on autonomic cardiac cells. This effect of \"per se\" pressure on cardiac cells is interpreted according to chemical kinetics laws. The hypothesis that pressure acts at the molecular level, possibly by the means of reversible structure modifications of some molecules, is suggested.", 
    "11": "The effects of intra-arterial infusion of dopamine on superior mesenteric artery blood flow, intestinal flow, intestinal oxygen consumption, and capillary density were studied in anesthetized dogs before and after blockade of dopamine receptors with haloperidol and after beta-adrenergic receptor blockade with propranolol. Mesenteric blood flow to a distal segment of the small intestine was measured with an electromagnetic blood flow-meter and intestinal oxygen consumption was calculated from the measured arteriovenous oxygen difference across the intestine and total blood flow. Intestinal capillary density was estimated from the clearance of 86Rb. In normal animals prior to dopaminergic or beta-adrenergic blockade, dopamine caused a dose-related decrease in mesenteric blood flow, intestinal oxygen consumption, and 86Rb clearance. Only the lowest dose of the drug, 1 mug/Kg.-min., did not significantly change the intestinal capillary density. In dogs pretreated with the dopamine receptor, antogonist, haloperidol, dopamine (20 mug/Kg.-min.) caused a significant increase in blood flow and oxygen consumption and did not significantly alter the number of perfused intestinal capillaries. These increases in haloperidol-blocked animals administered dopamine were reversed by propranolol. Our results indicate that dopamine caused smooth muscle contraction in mesenteric arterioles and precapillary sphincters, thereby producing intestinal ischemia and hypoxia. These findings with haloperidol and propranolol indicate that dopamine stimulates at least two different receptors in the canine mesenteric vascular bed: a constrictor receptor blocked by haloperidol and a dilator receptor blocked by propranolol.", 
    "12": "In an attempt to elucidate the ECG changes associated with the SCMS, we have applied the propranolol test in 35 of our patients suffering from this syndrome. To the best of our knowledge this is the first such report in the English literature. Twenty-eight patients showed improvement and this points against an ischemic etiology. The test may be applied to differentiate ischemic ST-T changes from those associated with the SCMS. We have suggested the possibility of sympathetic overactivity and autonomic imbalance as the basis for the ECG and other features related to the SCMS. We have noted the striking similarities in the symptomatology and ECG changes associated with the SCMS and those of neurocirculatory asthenia. The implication of this was discussed.", 
    "13": "Atrioventricular conduction patterns suggestive of dual A-V nodal pathways have been reported in patients with and without a history of paroxysmal A-V nodal re-entrant tachycardia (PSVT). The purpose of this study was to determine whether significant association exists between this conduction pattern and the occurrence of PSVT in man. The pattern of A-V conduction was evaluated at similar pacing rates in 13 patients with documented PSVT and 135 patients with PSVT. Patients without PSVT were divided into groups with normal PR intervals (106 patients), PR intervals of 120 msec. or less (12 patients), and PR intervals of 200 msec. or greater (17 patients). Evidence of dual A-V nodal pathways was found in seven of 13 patients with PSVT and nine of 135 patients without PSVT, including eight of 106 patients with normal PR intervals, none of 12 patients with short PR intervals, and one of 17 patients with PR intervals of 200 msec. or greater. The incidence of dual A-V nodal pathways was significantly greater (P less than 0.01) in patients with PSVT when compared with all other groups. In two of four patients with PSVT, propranolol was found to unmask evidence of dual pathways; no evidence of dual pathways was produced by propranolol in 23 patients without PSVT. The data show that the pattern of dual A-V nodal pathways is common only in patients with PSVT and is significantly less frequent in patients without PSVT regardless of the presence of short or long PR intervals. The results of this study establish a strong association between this conduction pattern and the occurrence of PSVT in man.",

    "15": "The often emergent nature of life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias, the frequent seeming \"resistance\" of the abnormal heart rhythm to therapy, and the commonly encountered toxicity of antidysrhythmic agents combine to make treatment of cardiac dysrhythmias one of the strictest challenges to the practicing physician. Although electrophysiologic studies have markedly increased out understanding of dysrhythmogenesis and the actions of anti-dysrhythmic drugs, these numerous investigations have provided but little assistance to the practicing physician either as an intellectual framework or as a guide to patient care. The electrophysiologic classification of the antidysrhythmic drugs presented in this paper should be acceptable both to the electrophysiologist and the clinician since it is based on alterations in basic membrane properties and correlates well with clinical realities. It serves as a guide to initial drug selection, anticipated bioelectric complications, the use of alternative drugs, and combination antidysrhythmic therapy.", 
    "16": "Although ST segment deflections have been widely utilized as a means of assessing the degree of underlying ischemic injury, the relationship of QRS complex alterations to the ischemic process is poorly understood. In this study we made a beat-to-beat analysis of the QRS complex in terms of ventricular activation time (CT) and R wave voltage (V) in the acutely ischemic porcine myocardium and analyzed the relationship of these responses to changes in the area of ischemic involvement, altered myocardial energy demands, and plasma [K+]0 levels. With the onset of ischemia the QRS complex underwent a specific and reproducible biphasic sequence with an initial decrease in CT and V indicating a transient increase in the conduction velocity of the ischemic tissue. Subsequently both CT and V returned briefly to control and then increased dramatically, now indicating a marked decrease in conduction velocity. The time when CT first began to increase (Tc) was shortened by enlarging the area of ischemia or after an inotropic intervention and was lengthened by decreasing the area of ischemia or with administration of propranolol. Moreover Tc was found to be inversely proportional to plasma [K+]0 in the range 3.4-8.8 mM, above which the initial decrease in CT and V was no longer present. We conclude that this biphasic sequence of QRS alterations in early myocardial ischemia is attributable to a progressive leakage of potassium out of the ischemic cells which in turn alters both the time-course and transmural pathway of the activation process through the ischemic tissue. These changes are related to both inotropic state and the area of ischemic involvement.", 
    "17": "N-Dimethylisopropyl propranolol (DMP) is a quaternary derivative which lacks significant beta-adrenergic blocking and local anesthetic effects. It has been reported, nonetheless, to be effective in treating experimental arrhythmias and in limiting the extent of ST-segment elevations following experimental coronary occlusion. The present study examined the effects of DMP on the hemodynamics and myocardial oxygen demands of anesthetized dogs. After a single dose of 3 mg/kg, heart rate fell from 146 +/- 8 to 124 +/- 6 beats/min (P less than 0.0025), and aortic systolic pressure fell from 151 +/- 11 to 141 +/- 9 mm Hg (0.05 less than P less than 0.10), resulting in a 16.8% reduction in the tension-time index. Stroke volume was reduced by 10% despite a 54% increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, suggesting a negative inotropic effect. This was supported by a decrease in maximum extrapolated contractile element velocity from 9.10 +/- 1.05 to 6.61 +/- 65 units/sec (P less than 0.0025). Myocardial oxygen consumption was reduced from 12.0 +/- 1.4 to 9.9 +/- 1.5 ml/min/100 g tissue (P less than 0.05). Myocardial oxygen extraction was unchanged, indicating that the decrease in oxygen consumption resulted from a reduction in myocardial oxygen demand. When heart rate and systolic pressure were artificially restored to control levels, after the administration of DMP, myocardial oxygen consumption remained significantly below the control level. DMP, therefore, appeared to reduce myocardial oxygen demands primarily by its negative inotropic effect. This drug may have application in the treatment of ischemic heart disease.", 
    "18": "We compared the effects of arachidonic acid (AA), the bisenoic prostaglandin precursor, with those of prostaglandin F2a (PGF2a) and norepinephrine (NE) on pulmonary vascular resistance in the isolated (in situ), perfused canine lung lobe. The isolated lobe was perfused with autologous blood or an artificial perfusate under conditions of constant flow. Lobar artery and venous pressures were constantly monitored after bolus injections of AA, PGF2a, and NE into the inflow cannula. AA (100 mug/kg produced a significant increase in the pressure gradient (93.3 +/- 8.4%, SE) in the lobe. Similarly, PGF2a (1 mug/kg) significantly increased the pressure gradient (41.2 +/- 6.5%), as did NE (1 mug/kg, 41.6 +/- 3.2%). Aspirin (25 mg/kg) completely blocked the pulmonary vascular effect of AA, but did not affect the response to PGF2a, Linoleic acid, a control fatty acid, did not produce pulmonary vasoconstriction. The pressor effect of AA was not blocked by pretreatment with phentolamine, propranolol, cyproheptadine, or atropine. The use of an artificial perfusate free of cellular elements did not prevent the vasoconstrictor action of AA. The times to onset of action of the three agents were similar, and short. These results suggest that AA is converted into vasoactive intermediates or a prostaglandin, and the vasoactive intermediates or the prostaglandin act directly on precapillary pulmonary vascular smooth muscle rather than through platelet, plasma, adrenergic, or cholinergic mechanisms.", 
    "19": "We have attempted to evaluate the role of adrenergic nerves which arise from the superior cervical ganglia or which are intracerebral throughout their course, in the control of local cerebral blood flow (CBF). Hypothalamic blood flow (HBF) was measured in the conscious rabbit by the 133Xe-clearance technique. Stimulation of the upper brainstem, using 5-Hz, 3-V, 1-msec, square wave pulses, increased by HBF by a mean of 7.6 ml/100 g per min (P less than 0.005). This effect was abolished by the intrahypothalamic injection of the beta-adrenoreceptor blocker, propranolol, and by chemical sympathectomy of the hypothalamus or of the upper brainstem with 6-hydroxydopamine, but was not altered by bilateral cervical ganglionectomy. Intrahypothalamic injection of 0.1 mug of tyramine caused a mean decrease in HBF of 15.6 ml/100 g per min (P less than 0.001). This effect of intrahypothalamic injection of tyramine was abolished by bilateral cervical sympathectomy but not by chemical sympathectomy of the upper brainstem. These results support the idea that local CBF, at least in the hypothalamus, is mediated by two distinct pathways. The first consists of the sympathetic nerves which arise in the cervical ganglia, and which activate intrahypothalamic alpha-receptors to cause constriction. The second is an entirely intracerebral noradrenergic pathway which stimulates beta-receptors to cause vasodilation.", 
    "20": "1. The effect of ambient temperature on the properties of adrenoceptors mediating inotropic responses was assessed in isolated frog hearts on the basis of the effects and tissue uptake of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. 2. At temperatures of 23degree C and above inotropic responses to adrenaline were antagonized by propranolol (0-4-4-0muM), but were unaffected by phentolamine (26-5muM) and were potentiated by phenoxybenzamine (POB) (0-7-29-5muM). Below 17degree C the activity of propranolol was reduced at least tenfold, and the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists inhibited responses to both adrenaline and isoprenaline, but not those to CaCL2. 3. The responses of hearts exposed to POB at 14degree C and then tested, after thorough washing, at both 14 and 24degree C were similarly inhibited at both temperatures, i.e. the usual beta-adrenoceptor response did not appear at the higher temperature. Conversely, exposure to POB at 24degree C produced only potentiation at both test temperatures. 4. Parallel to the reciprocal changes in their blocking actions, significantly more (14C)propranolol was retained by hearts exposed at high temperatures and significantly more (3H)POB was bound to the myocardium at low temperatures. Changes in binding and in the pharmaco logical effects of both blocking agents occurred entirely within a relatively narrow temperature range (17-22degree C) Parallel to the change from alpha- to beta-adrenoceptor characteristics with increasing temperature, the sensitivity of the hearts to adrenaline increased about tenfold. 5. Phentolamine (26-5muM) effectively protected hearts from block by (3H)POB at 14degree C, unmasked a potentiation of responses to adrenaline equivalent to that produced by POB at 24degree C, and reduced binding of the label to approximately the level found in unprotected hearts exposed at the higher temperature. At 24degree C, phentolamine did not alter the potentiation produced by (3H)POB, and reduced binding only slightly. There was no significant temperature differential in the amount of (3H)POB bound in the presence of phentolamine. 6. The results presented indicate a close functional and, probably, morphological association of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors in the frog heart. It is suggested that the two classes of adrenoceptors may represent allosterie conformations of the same structure.", 
    "21": "The cardiovascular system of the anaesthetized dog has been used as an experimental model for studying the mechanisms of the haemodynamic responses to hypoxia. Together with aortic and left circumflex coronary artery blood flow (electromagnetic flow transducers), aortic and left ventricular pressures have been recorded and blood has been sampled from the aorta and the coronary sinus (PO2, PCO2, pH). During short periods of hypoxia an improvement of myocardial performance has been observed both before and after administration of a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker and a marked reduction of coronary sinus PCO2 has been noted. When hypoxia was caused by a mixture of nitrogen (95%) and CO2 (5%) an improvement of performance was observed only before administration of the beta-blocker. The slope of the relationship between PCSCO2 and cardiac performance was found to be similar before and after administration of the beta-blocker and also similar to that observed in studies of the response of the isolated heart muscle to acute hypocapnia. Besides beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation, a reduction of coronary sinus PCO2 (CO2 wash-out due to an increase of coronary blood flow) could be a factor contributing to the maintenance of myocardial performance in the face of hypoxia.", 
    "22": "1. The effects of secretin on inotropic and chronotropic activity were investigated in nine isolated canine atrium preparations which were suspended in a bath and perfused with arterial blood from a carotid artery of a heparinized donor dog. 2. Secretin administered into the cannulated sinus node artery in a dose range of 0-1-10 units produced a dose-related positive inotropic and a biphasic chronotropic effect. 3. The positive chronotropic and inotropic responses to secretin were not suppressed by treatment with alprenolol in doses which blocked responses to noradrenaline. 4. The negative chronotropic response to secretin was not blocked by atropine in doses which blocked the response to acetylcholine. 5. After treatment with glucagon, secretin produced dose-related negative chronotropic and a positive inotropic effects. Thus glucagon may antagonize the positive chronotropic effect of secretin. 6. From these results, it is concluded that secretin has a direct effect on atrial rate and contractility.", 
    "23": "Intravenous administration of dopamine caused a dose-dependent reduction in the lower esophageal sphincter pressure and contractions in the lowermost part of the body of the esophagus in the opossum. A dose of 5 mug per kg produced maximal response. The onset of contractions in the body occurred around 20 sec after the onset of the sphincter response. The effect of dopamine was different from isoproterenol, which caused no contractions in the body and caused reduction in sphincter pressure, and from phenylephrine, which also caused no contractions in the body but caused contraction of the sphincter. Moreover, the effect of 5 mug per kg of dopamine was blocked by haloperidol but not by phentolamine, propranolol, bilateral cervical vagotomy, or tetrodotoxin. These studies suggested the presence of selective dopamine receptors which mediated contraction of the esophageal body and relaxation of the sphincter muscle. Since vagal stimulation also causes contraction in the body and relaxation of the sphincter, it was possible that vagal effect on the esophagus was mediated by dopamine receptors. However, haloperidol did not block the effect of electrical stimulation of vagus nerve on body of the esophagus or the lower esophageal sphincter.", 
    "24": "In a double-blind crossover experiment 18 young men received on one occasion 6 doses of 40 mg propranolol and in the other placebo. Medication was given at 6 hour intervals. One hr after the last capsule was ingested subjects were measured with various physiological and behavioral tests. At the conclusion of testing mean plasma propranolol concentration was 67.6 ng/ml. Propranolol significantly reduced systolic blood pressure and heart rate. There was an increased variability on one behavioral measure but the results of other tests were not affected. The findings are discussed in terms of therapeutic use of this and other beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents.", 
    "25": "In 17 normal subjects we studied the changes evoked by five levels of expiratory pressure (EP) ranging from 2.5 to 30 mmHg in a number of circulatory variables during the last 10 s of a 30-s Valsalva maneuver. Variables studied included mean arterial (MAP) and pulse (PP) pressures; right atrial (RAP) and peripheral vein (PVP) pressures; cardiac output (CO); total peripheral resistance (TPR) and heart rate (HR). EP-circulatory response curves were obtained in each subject a) before autonomic block; b) after cardiac effector block (atropine + propranolol); c) after \"total\" autonomic block (atropine + propranolol; guanethidine + phentolamine). Mechanical effects were determined from results during \"total\" autonomic block. They included EP-related rises in RAP and PVP each to about 0.7 mmHg/mmHg applied EP, and falls in CO, MAP, and PP to levels of approximately 50%, 70%, and 80% of resting respectively at EP 30 mmHg, but no changes in TPR and HR. Reflex effects included EP-related rises in HR and in TPR and in MAP, to levels of 160%, 160%, and 115% of resting respectively at EP 30 mmHg. The afferent input profile is probably complex, and the role of the different receptor groups may vary at the different levels of EP.", 
    "26": "Two new cases of ventricular tachycardia (VT) in the infant are reported, and reviewed in the light of the 23 case histories found in the literature. The diagnosis rests upon eliminating a pre-excitation syndrome, which is so common in this age group. The VTs found in infants are rapid, irregular, and take many different forms. They often necessitate urgent treatment with electric shocks. Preventive treatment consists of a combination of procainamide and beta-blockers in relatively large doses. The search for an aetiological agent should include a haemodynamic and angiocardiographic study of all the chambers of the heart to exclude cardiomyopathy, tumours, papyraceous right ventricle and congenital heart defects. Where no cause can be demonstrated, preventive treatment should be given, with regular electrical testing and other follow-up investigations. An attempt to reduce the drug dosage should be made every 6 months, in hospital. In cases which prove resistant despite adequate treatment, it seems justifiable to carry out a pericardial exploration with the aim of diathermising the ectopic focus; this approach is suggested because of the poor natural history of this type of case.", 
    "27": "Eight patients with active thyrotoxicosis have been followed up to one year after the onset of antithyroid treatment. At different time intervals during the investigation period, TRH tests were performed and total T4 and T3 basal levels were measured. The TRH-induced TSH release was delayed in all patients in spite of a normalization of the circulating levels of thyroid hormones. The delay varied according to the patients and lasted, in some cases, for as long as 24 weeks after the normalization of the thyroid hormone levels. Administration of thyroid hormones, together with methimazole, did not seem to prevent the pituitary thyrotropes responsiveness; moreover, it did not provoke an inhibition of the TRH-induced TSH release once the thyrotropes reactivity was fully restored. The feed-back mechanism does not seem to be the main modulator of the pituitary responsiveness to TRH in these circumstances.", 
    "28": "The effect of propranolol on the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve (P-50) of coronary venous blood was studied in isolated canine hearts. I.v. administration of propranolol (0.5, 5.0 mg/kg) produced no significant change in P-50 over 4 hr. Following propranolol, an intracoronary infusion of nitroglycerin (10 mug/min) increased P-50. Addition of propranolol (5 X 10(-5) M to 1 X 10(-4)M) to central venous blood in vitro produced a significant increase in P-50. These data indicate that propranolol increases P-50 in vitro but does not increase P-50 in vivo, whereas nitroglycerin increases P-50 In vivo but not in vitro.", 
    "29": "Propranolol penetrates the blood brain barrier, whereas mainly the racemic form, Inderal, possesses beta-receptor blocking properties. A comparison between d-propranolol and Inderal might therefore indicate the relative importance of the beta blocking properties and possible \"central\" effects mediated by propranolol and of importance in migraine prophylaxis. The effects of propranolol in racemic form (Inderal) 40 mg q.i.d., d-propranolol 40 mg q.i.d. and placebo were compared in 20 migraine patients. Inderal as well as d-propranolol were significantly superior to placebo. Inderal seemed to be more effective than d-propranolol, but the difference was not statistically significant (P greater than 0.05). The results indicate that beta-receptor blocking properties, but possibly also properties other than the beta-blocking ones, may be of importance for the anti-migraine effect of propranolol.", 
    "30": "Effects of octopamine on sinus rate and atrial contractility were investigated using the isolated atrium preparation of the dog which perfused with heparinized arterial blood led from a support dog. When octopamine, dopamine or norepinephrine was administered into the cannulated sinus node artery, positive chronotropic and inotropic responses were dose-relatedly induced from 0.1 mug, 0.1 mug or 0.01 mug, respectively. The D.R.50 values (dose ratio at 50% maximum response) of octopamine, dopamine and norepinephrine are roughly 30-100: 30:1, respectively. The duration of action of octopamine was longest. Effects induced by octopamine were blocked by an adrenergic beta-blocking agent, alprenolol. Desmethyl-imipramine treatment significantly suppressed octopamine-induced effects but rather enhanced norepinephrine-induced ones. Octopamine-induced effects were not influenced by tetrodotoxin which blocked those induced by nicotine. From these results, it is concluded that positive chronotropic and inotropic responses to octopamine are mainly due to a tyramine-like action.", 
    "31": "Oxprenolol, a beta-blocker, is an effective antihypertensive when administered 3 or 4 times daily. We evaluated the antihypertensive effect of oxprenololgiven twice daily (bid). The subjects were 15 ambulatory men whose standing diastolic blood pressure (BP) was at least 100 mm Hg after 3 wk of treatment with hydrochlorothiazide and oxprenolol placebo. Oxprenolol 40 mg twice daily was then substituted for the placebo. On subsequent weekly vists oxprenolol was titrated to 80 and 160 mg bid if the standing diastolic BP was greater than 90 mm Hg. BLood pressures on the last visit on placebo were compared to those on the last visit on oxprenolol. Standing BP declined from 145 +/- 4/108 +/- 1 to 130 +/- 4/98 +/- 4 on a mean dose of 256 mg of oxprenolol (p less than 0.001 syst.; p less than 0.01 diast.). Recumbent BP fell from 146 +/- 4/107 +/- 1 to 138 +/- 5/93 +/- 2 (p less than 0.06 syst.; p less than 0.01 diast.). During the final week, 13 of the 15 patients were admitted to the hospital for 24-hr monitoring of BP. The 24-hr BP readings showed a mean coefficient of variation of 6.6% recumbent and 7.2% standing. we conclude that bid oxprenolol will maintain 24 hr BP control in most patients.", 
    "32": "Variant angina pectoris, usually not precipitated by exertion or emotional stress, often is more severe and lasts longer than classic angina. The pain tends to recur at about the same time each day. Arrhythmias, usually ventricular, occur in about 50% of cases during the peak of pain. Electrocardiograms show a characteristic ST segment elevation during pain, which is in contrast to the ST segment depression of classic angina pectoris. Pain may be due, at least in some cases, to a temporary increase in tonus of a single, large, narrowed coronary artery. Chemical changes in the myocardium and plasma catecholamine changes differ from those occurring in classic angina pectoris. The course of the disease is highly variable but the prognosis must be regarded as grave, since single large vessel disease, present in most cases, is associated with severe myocardial ischemia. Patients with variant angina pectoris should be studied early with coronary arteriography and considered for coronary artery bypass surgery if appropriate.", 
    "33": "A number of hemodynamic, pharmacologic, and metabolic interventions were found to change the extent of acute ischemic injury of the myocardium and subsequent necrosis following experimental coronary artery occlusion. Reduction in myocardial damage occurred by decreasing myocardial oxygen demands (beta-adrenergic blocking agents, intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation, nitroglycerin, decreasing afterload in hypertensive patients, inhibition of lipolysis, and digitalis in the failing heart); by increasing myocardial oxygen supply either directly (coronary artery reperfusion or elevating arterial pO2), or through collateral vessels (evevation of coronary perfusion pressure by alpha adrenergic agonists, intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation); or by increasing plasma osmolality (manitol, hypertonic glucose); presumably by augmenting anaerobi metabolism (glucose-insulin-potassium, hypertonic glucoxe insulin potassium, hypertonic glucose); by enhancing transport to the ischemic zone of substrates utilized in energy production (hyaluronidase); by protecting against autolytic and heterolytic damage (hydrocortisone, cobra venom factor, aprotinin). Augmentation of myocardial ischemic damage occurred as a consequence of increasing myocardial oxygen requirements (isoproterenol, glucagon, ouabain, bretylium tosylate, tachycardia); by decreasing myocardial oxygen supply either directly (hypoxia, anemia), through reduction of collateral flow (hemorrhagic hypotension, minoxidil), or by decreasing substrate availability (hypoglycemia). Pilot studies have been carried out in patients with hyaluronidase, nitroglycerin intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation, beta-blocking agents and Arfonad and have shown that these interventions may also reduce myocardial damage, which suggests that the concept of reduction in infarct size following coronary occlusion is applicable clinically.", 
    "34": "In a search for behavioural tests where certain behaviours related to dopamine and noradrenaline transmission can be recorded automatically we have developed and tested an automatic version of the hole board. The test measures two behaviour variables: the open field variable defined as the number of interruptions of photocell beams symmetrically covering an open field area and the 'hole' variable, defined as the number of head-dips into holes recorded by photocell beams positioned underneath the floor of the cage. The method was evaluated by observations of the rats concomitant with the automatic registrations. The animals were tested on dopamine agonistic drugs, which were found to decrease the 'hole' counts and cause an increase in the open field counts as compared to saline injected controls. d-Amphetamine which is known to increase the release of dopamine as well as of noradrenaline caused an increase in both the open field counts and the 'hole' counts. The increase in 'hole' counts caused by d-amphetamine was reduced when the animals were pretreated with a dopamine-beta-hydroxylase inhibitor (FLA 63) or a noradrenaline receptor blocker (phenoxybenzamine). These results suggests that the increase in the 'hole' variable was related to an increased noradrenaline transmission while the increase in the open field variable was related to an increased dopamine transmission. The lowest dose of apomorphine caused a behavioural inhibition which may be explained by a preferential stimulation of dopamine autoreceptors.", 
    "35": "Fragmented sarcoplasmic reticulum was prepared from the rabbit heart. The function of vesicles was characterized by the activities of Mg++ and ATP-dependent 'Calcium-Binding' and Ca-ATPase. A fluorescence probe, 1-anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonate (ANS) was employed to examine the physicochemical changes in vesicular membranes. Chlorpromazine, dl-propranolol and lidocaine inhibited Calcium-Binding activity and increased ANS-fluorescence. There was a good correlation between the changes in two parameters. The potency of three drugs on both parameters decreased in the above-mentioned order. These drugs, however, induced no change in the ANS-fluorescence associated by serum albumin or lecithin. The drugs would act presumably at lipid-protein interfaces in vesicles to increase ANS-fluorescence. Both Ca-ATPase and Basic-ATPase were inhibited by dl-propranolol. These results suggest that the inhibitory action of dl-propranolol on the calcium transport system is ascribable to direct physicochemical effects on vesicular membranes.", 
    "36": "The hypotensive actions of dl-propranolol and a new beta-blocking agent, dl-tert-butylamino-3-(2', 3'-dimethylphenoxy)-2-propanol hydrochloride (D-32) were studied in conscious normotensive and renal hypertensive dogs, using a cross-over design. The effects were compared with that of placebo (lactose 200 mg/head, p.o.) administered in a blind fashion. A marked reduction in systolic blood pressure, from 158 +/- 2.9 to 124 +/- 2.3 (mean +/- S.E.) mm Hg, was observed at 3 hr after administration of 50 mg/kg, p.o. of D-32 in renal hypertensive dogs but not in normotensive ones. In both normotensive and renal hypertensive dogs, 10 and 50 mg/kg, p.o. of D-32 caused a marked increase in heart rate. Intravenous infusion of p-OH D-32, a main metabolite of D-32 in dogs, at a rate of 1 mg/kg per min for 5 min into renal hypertensive dogs caused a significant, long-lasting fall in blood pressure and a sustained increase in heart rate, whereas that of D-32 (1 mg/kg per min for 5 min) failed to do so. Propranolol (10 and/or 50 mg/kg, p.o.) produced no significant changes in blood pressure and heart rate in both preparations. These results indicate that D-32 causes a fall in blood pressure in conscious renal hypertensive dogs mainly by a metabolite of D-32, p-OH D-32.", 
    "37": "Injection of meglumine diatrizoate (Renografin-76) into the selectively perfused sinus node artery of the dog produces bradycardia which is unaltered by autonomic blockade or by changes in sinus node artery pressure. Contrast agents and other hyperosmolar substances prolong the R-R interval in proportion to their osmolarity. Selective injection of contrast media into other cannulated segments of the coronary tree produces no change in heart rate. Transfemoral arteriography, however, produces bradycardia with both right and left coronary injections. Both direct and reflex sinus node depression occur with coronary arteriography in the dog. Direct effects are mediated by hyperosmolarity.", 
    "38": "The distribution of the monoamine oxidase (MAO) dependent binding of [14C] serotonin as well as of pre-formed [14C] 5-OH-indole-3-acetaldehyde to synaptic subfractions paralleled the gross distribution of MAO. The binding of [14C] serotonin and MAO activity in brain preparations was inhibited by CNS antidepressants (imipramine) or stimulants (caffeine), by hallucinogens (N,N-dimethyltryptamine), sedatives (chlorpromazine), and other drugs. The protein-lipid nature of the binding macromolecule was determined. The chemical nature of the acceptors was also investigated. Experiments with sodium borohydride indicated the partial formation of imines, those with SH-reactive compounds showed partial involvement of acceptor-SH groups in the binding.", 
    "39": "The effects of acute and chronic ethanol intake on the startle response was examined in male rats. Ethanol given IP produced a dose-dependent decrease in the amplitude of the startle response measured 30 min later. With a dose of 1 g/kg, the effect was evident at 15 min and had recovered substantially by 60 min. The effect of ethanol on the startle response was potentiated by pretreatment of the animals with pimozide, haloperidol, and p-chlorophenylalanine but not by propranolol, phenoxybenzamine, alpha-methyltyrosine, or pargyline. After 3 weeks on an ethanol-containing diet, the startle response was greater than that shown by rats on the control iso-caloric, sucrose-containing diet. After ethanol withdrawal, the startle response was further increased, with a peak about 9 to 12 hr after discontinuation of ethanol; thereafter, the response declined. This time course of heightened startle response during ethanol withdrawal corresponds to the time course of the activation of noradrenergic neurons during withdrawal. It appears that dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons are involved in the mediation of the startle response in rats.", 
    "40": "(+/-)-Propranolol hydrochloride (0.5 mg kg(-1) twice daily, subcutaneously, for 3 days or approximately 2.4 mg kg(-1) daily, orally, for 21 days) failed to produce ptosis or to affect responses to transmural stimulation of isolated vasa deferentia removed from treated mice. In guinea-pig isolated vasa deferentia responses to transmural stimulation through parallel electrodes were reduced by propranolol (1 to 20 mug ml(-1); blockade was concentration dependent, fast to equilibrium (45 min), easily reversed by washing but not reversed by (+)-amphetamine sulphate (0.2 mug ml(-1). At lower concentrations (0.04 and 0.2 mug ml(-1), propranolol marginally potentiated responses to transmural stimulation. In contrast, guanethidine (0.2 mug ml(-1)) produced a slow onset blockade which was completely reversed by (+)-amphetamine. The response to electrical stimulation through concentric ring electrodes was reduced by low concentrations of propranolol but this effect is ascribed to the known local anaesthetic actions of propranolol and no evidence of true adrenergic neuron blockade was found.", 
    "41": "The contractility of an isolated rabbit uterus was studied. It was found that when used in low concentrations (1.10(-9)-1.10(-7) g/ml) isoprenaline, while stimulating the beta-adrenoreceptors of the uterus, inhibits its contractions, whereas in high concentrations (1.10(6)-1.10(-5) g/ml) it is capable of intensifying uterine contractions owing to stimulation of the uterine alpha-adrenoreceptors. Dihydroergotoxin (1.10(-6) g/ml), a blocking agent of alpha-adrenoreceptors, averts and eliminates the stimulating effect of isoprenaline on the uterus. Propranolol and netalide, blocking agents of the beta-adrenoreceptors, abolish the already developed depressing action of isoprenaline on the contractile activity of the uterus, but fail to prevent this effect with their preliminary application.", 
    "42": "Isolated biopsy specimens of human peripheral arteries and veins, preincubated with 3H-(-)- noradrenaline (NA) to label the neural stores of NA, were used to study the Beta-adrenoceptors previously found to increase the secretion of 3H-NA evoked by electrical field stimulation of the adrenergic nerves of this tissue. The increase in nerve stimulation induced secretion of 3H-NA caused by 0.04 muM isoprenaline was prevented by 1 muM propranolol. This beta-blocking drug by itself slightly but significantly depressed the secretion of 3H-NA caused by nerve stimulation in the absence of isoprenaline. While the secretion of 3H-NA was not affected by known beta1-agonists, it was dose-dependently and reversibly increased by two different beta2-agonists. The effect of isoprenaline on 3H-NA secretion was not altered by a selective beta1-antagonist, but strongly reduced or abolished by a beta2-blocking drug. The results indicate that the beta-adrenoceptors involved in the control of NA secretion from the vasoconstrictor nerves of human omental blood vessels are only to a minimal extent stimulated by NA secreted from the nerves, and therefore do probably not mainly serve to mediate local positive feedback control of transmitter secretion; the receptors appear to be beta2 in nature.", 
    "43": "The effect of sympathetic nerve stimulation (NS) and injected noradenaline (NA) or isoprenaline (Iso) on PVO2, VO2 and PtO2 was studied in isolated canine subcutaneous adipose tissue. These effects were compared to those produced by mechanical blood flow reduction (clamping). Resting VO2 measured 13.0+/- 2.3 mumol X min-1 X 100 g-1. When blood flow was reduced by 20% or less there was no significant change of VO2. Reducing blood flow to 50% of control or less by NS caused a parallel reduction in VO2, while clamping reduced VO2 significantly less. NA gave effects similar to those of NS. After NS or NA there was a period of hyperemia and increased oxygen extraction which more than compensated for the decrease in VO2 during vasoconstriction. Such a net increase in VO2 was not produced by clamping. Control PtO2 averaged 29+/-2 mmHg. NA reduced it by 70% and clamping to the same blood flow level only by 14% (p less than 0.01). Thus, a mere reduction in blood flow has little effect on PtO2, while blood flow reduction combined with redistribution of blood flow and an increased oxygen deman can lead to tissue hypoxia.", 
    "44": "Cerebral hemispheric blood flow and metabolism were measured before and after therapy with intracarotid infusion of combined PBZ and PPL in 15 patients with recent cerebral infarction. HBF was unaltered despite decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure. Cerebral hemispheric oxygen comsumption and carbon dioxide production decreased while cerebral hemispheric lactate production increased. Biphasic cerebral uptake of tyrosine was observed during and immediately after PBZ and PPL infusion. CSF HVA increased, indicating altered DA turnover. CSF 5HIAA levels also increased, suggesting altered 5HT turnover after PBZ and PPL. Release of cyclic AMP from ischemic brain into cerebral venous blood seen in the steady state was abolished after therapy. Cerebral hemodynamic studies suggest a functional balance between monaminergic neurogenic influences in the control of cerebral circulation. Imbalance of such controlling factors in ischemic brain may lead to paradoxical vascular responses to induced hypertension and hypotension. PBZ and PPL enhance such responses perhaps by increasing central neurotransmitter turnover and release. Further shift toward cerebral anaerobic metabolism may occur in ischemic brain following the use of phenoxybenzamine and propranolol. Worsening of neurological deficit occurred in four cases. Combined therapy with PBZ and PPL does not appear beneficial in the therapy of patients with recent stroke.", 
    "45": "3H-l-Alprenolol, a potent competitive beta adrenergic antagonist, binds to sites in rat pineal gland membranes. The properties of these binding sites were compared to those of the receptors which mediate the beta adrenergic activation of pineal adenylate cyclase. Both sites are highly stereospecific. The l-stereoisomers of alprenolol and propranolol were at least two orders of magnitude more potent than the d-stereoisomers in inhibiting isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase or 3H-l-alprenolol binding. The dissociation constants (Kd) of the l-stereoisomers of both alprenolol and propranolol were 10 to 22 nM as determined by competition for binding sites or by inhibition of isoproternol-stimulated adenylate cyclase. Beta adrenergic agonists which stimulated adenylate cyclase also competitively inhibited the binding of 3H-l-alprenolol. They showed the same order of potency (isoproterenol greater than norepinephrine greater than or equal to epinephrine) and the same individual affinities in the two systems. Alpha adrenergic blockers were ineffective in inhibiting either adenylate cyclase stimulation or 3H-l-alprenolol binding. Isoproternol stimulation of adenylate cyclase acrivity, and 3H-l-alprenolol binding, were rapid and rapidly reversible. The 3H-l-alprenolol binding sites were saturable and bound 0.6 pmol of ligand per mg of added protein. The data suggest that the binding of 3H-l-alprenolol occurs at sites indistinguishable from the pineal beta adrenergic receptor.", 
    "46": "Twelve unselected males suffering from documented coronary insufficiency and moderately severe angina submitted to graded multistage treadmill exercise testing on 3 separate days, 3.5 hr after a single dose of 0,200, or 400 mg of acebulolol, a cardioselective beta blocker. Control measures included random allocation of 2 patients to each of 6 balanced sequences of administration, standardized double-blind conditions, and variance analysis for Latin-square design with repeated measures on each subject. Performance was evaluated by measuring time elapsed until anginal pain, peak heart rate, peak product of heart rate and blood pressure, and peak oxygen consumption. Mean values for all criteria were significantly atered by 400 mg of acebutolol. Seven out of twelve patients were classified as responders (i.e., exercise duration increased 100% or more). The response after acebutolol was correlated with the performance on placebo in the base of exercise duration, peak heart rate, and peak product of heart rate and blood pressure. It is concluded that: (1) performance criteria are useful predictors of response to beta blockade and (2) acebutolol is a potent antianginal agent when judged by an objective treadmill exercise test.", 
    "47": "Four children with syncope had a prolonged QT interval on the electrocardiogram. Neurologic studies were negative. One patient had associated deaf mutism, one had a family history of sudden death and prolonged QT interval, and two had ventricular arrhythmias while being monitored in the hospital. Treatment with propranolol hydrochloride eliminated the syncope in all patients, although the ECGs remained abnormal.", 
    "48": "Adenylate cyclase [ATP pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing), EC 4.6.1.1] activity of purified secretory vesicle membranes from the adrenal medulla is inhibited by I-isoproterenol and I-epinephrine, as well as by nerve growth factor (NGF). The effect of these agents was found to be dose-dependent and, in the case of the catecholamines, saturable. NGF was active at concentrations as low as 10(-8) M. Oxidized NGF was only minimally active, and insulin was completely inactive. Neither dopamine nor phenylephrine had activity. Inhibition of cyclase by either isoproterenol or epinephrine was blocked by I-propranolol, a specific beta-antagonist, but propranolol by itself had no effect on adenylate cyclase activity. The data indicate that the secretory vesicle membrane has beta-adrenergic receptors coupled to the adenylate cyclase. Propranolol was also found to block the NGF-induced inhibition of cyclase. We conclude that the granule membrane has beta-adrenergic receptors as well as NGF-reactive sites, and that the two may be functionally linked.", 
    "49": "A series of 1-(2-acyl-4-acylaminophenoxy)-3-isopropylaminopropan-2-ols has been synthesized and examined for beta-receptor blocking and antiarrhythmic activity. Several of these compounds are more than 20 times as active in blocking cardiac beta-receptors than vascular beta-receptors when given intravenously to anesthetized cats. The activities have been correlated quantitatively with partition and steric substitution constants. The observed relationships are consistent with a tentative proposal that the vascular receptor is situated in a more lipophilic environment than the cardiac receptor so that there is a differential transport effect between the two types of receptor.", 
    "50": "The synthesis of a number of 1-alkyl-7-(2-hydroxy-3-alkylaminopropoxy)-1,8-naphthyridin-2-ones is described. The compounds studied were prepared by reaction of 1-alkyl-7-hydroxy-1,8-naphthyridin-2-ones with epichlorohydrin. The substituted epoxy intermediates obtained were allowed to react with amines and gave the desired products. All the compunds prepared were devoid of beta-blocking activity.", 
    "51": "Normal CFW mice, when exposed to tobacco smoke, showed a significantly increased susceptibility to the lethal effects of histamine. The LD50 for mice subjected to smoke was 45 mg/kg of histamine, whereas in normal CFW mice the LD50 was 1,100 mg/kg. The histamine susceptibility of smoked mice was markedly diminished by injecting the animals with isoproterenol. Normal CFW mice, as well as sham control mice, exhibited an epinephrine-induced hyperglycemia, whereas the blood glucose values for smoked mice given epinephrine were essentially the same as those for sham mice given only saline. This observation indicates that tobacco smoke may contain a component which causes an autonomic imbalance, hence rendering the mice more susceptible to histamine. This tobacco smoke-induced allergy is probably related to a blockade of adrenergic receptors and not to an immunologic phenomenon.", 
    "52": "After 24 moderately severe hypertensive patients had been treated for 4 weeks with a placebo for timolol, alpha-methyldopa was added and titrated until control of the blood pressure or a total daily dose of 2 500 mg was achieved. At the 9th week, the dose of alpha-methyldopa was halved and either timolol or its placebo was titrated in double-blind fashion. Titration over a period of 4 weeks was followed by a further 5 weeks of stabilisation. In 22 patients whose responses were accepted for analysis, alpha-methyldopa caused a significant lowering of blood pressure, with a greater reduction in the upright posture and a reduction in pulse rate. The addition of timolol caused a highly significant further reduction in pulse rate and a significant reduction in blood pressure in 8 of 10 patients. Apart from a statistically significant increase in serum urea and creatinine with, however, retention of normal renal function, no other side-effects were attributable to timolol."
