The patients were divided into two subgroups: subgroup 1 of 26 patients with intensification of angina of effort, subgroup II of 34 patients with unstable angina. Combined pharmacological treatment was given: nitrates, B-adrenolytic drugs and nifedipine (Cordipin, Krka) Addition of Cordipin produced clinical and electrocardiographic improvement in 44 cases (73%): all patients in subgroup I and 18 (53%) in subgroup II. Cordipin was well tolerated, and produced no serious side effects.", 
    "1": "Eight mildly to moderately hypertensive subjects free of any antihypertensive medications and on a normal salt diet performed maximal supine arm exercise. Before starting the exercise, a right-sided cardiac catheterization was performed to measure hemodynamic parameters before and during exercise. All patients had normal increases in cardiac output for the level of exercise performed and the peripheral vascular resistance diminished appropriately. An increase in the right atrial and pulmonary artery wedge pressures during exercise could be explained by increased venous return. After the baseline testing, rest and exercise hemodynamics were repeated 2 hours after the administration of 400 mg of dilevalol, a new beta blocker. For the next 2 weeks the patients received 400 mg of the study drug twice a day, with repeat studies obtained thereafter. As with other beta blockers, dilevalol decreases the heart rate and cardiac output on exercise, but, in addition, it induces a decrease in the resting systemic vascular resistance. This action is similar to its isomer, labetalol.", 
    "2": "In studying the regulation of insulin secretion by phorbol esters, we examined their effects on the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), using the Ca2+ indicator fura-2 in the rat insulin-secreting beta-cell line RINm5F. [Ca2+]i was measured in parallel with the rate of insulin release. 50 nM 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), which may act via protein kinase C, stimulated insulin release and caused an increase in [Ca2+]i. Ca2+-free conditions eliminated the increase in [Ca2+]i and resulted in a reduced stimulation of insulin release by TPA. The Ca2+ channel blocker nitrendipine (300 nM) inhibited both the increase in [Ca2+]i and the increased rate of insulin secretion. Another phorbol ester, 4 beta-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate, which activates protein kinase C, also induced an increase in [Ca2+]i and in the rate of insulin release, while 4 alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate, which fails to stimulate protein kinase C, was without effect. Further studies with bis-oxonol as an indicator of membrane potential showed that TPA depolarized the beta-cell plasma membrane. From these results, it is concluded that TPA depolarizes the plasma membrane, induces the opening of Ca2+ channels in the RINm5F beta-cell plasma membrane, increases [Ca2+]i, and results in insulin secretion. The action of TPA was next compared with that of a depolarizing concentration of KC1 (25 mM), which stimulates insulin secretion simply by opening Ca2+ channels. TPA consistently elicited less depolarization, a smaller rise of [Ca2+]i, but a greater release of insulin than KC1. Therefore an additional action of TPA is suggested, which potentiates the action of the elevated [Ca2+]i on insulin secretion.", 
    "3": "The potency of the serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OHDPAT), to induce forepaw treading was increased 20-fold after co-treatment with the 5-HT2 agonist, 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI). DOI induced head twitches which were inhibited by 8-OHDPAT. The putative 5-HT1B agonist, 1-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazine (TFMPP), had a weak effect on the responses to DOI or 8-OHDPAT. The forepaw treading induced by 8-OHDPAT plus DOI was inhibited by high doses of (-)-alprenolol, ketanserin or ritanserin, but was not influenced by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, ICI 118.551, or the 5-HT3 antagonist, ICS 205-930. A non-effective dose of (-)-alprenolol increased the inhibitory effect of ketanserin and ritanserin. These results indicate a complex and different interaction between 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptors in the expression of two behavioural responses mediated by 5-HT.", 
    "4": "Ionic conductances present in the dendritic region of the cerebellar Purkinje neuron were studied using the single-channel and whole-cell recording methods. Several types of voltage-sensitive K+ channels including a Ca2+ activated K+ channel were found to be a prominent components of the dendritic membrane. All patches studied contained K+ channel types and most patches contained more than one K+ channel type. In cell attached recordings, K+ channel activity was associated with the late phase of spontaneous action potentials suggesting a functional relationship. These data demonstrate that voltage-sensitive ion channels contribute to dendritic excitability and suggest that the transduction and integration of synaptic signals may involve both active and passive ionic conductances.", 
    "5": "Noradrenergic fibers from the locus ceruleus were identified in close proximity to brain microvessels, and adrenoceptors exist in isolated brain capillaries. Yet, proof of innervation of brain microvessels by locus ceruleus remains elusive. We now demonstrate increased density of beta-adrenoceptors by pindolol binding in microvessels isolated from the norepinephrine-depleted cerebrum two weeks after locus ceruleus lesion or reserpine treatment. This finding of 'denervation supersensitivity' in brain microvessels implies that their adrenoceptors respond to norepinephrine from the locus ceruleus, and strongly suggests that the locus ceruleus innervates brain microvessels. These results may have important implications because blood-brain barrier dysfunction may be a factor in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer dementia and Parkinson disease, which are associated with locus ceruleus degeneration.", 
    "6": "Injections of 8-OH-DPAT (0.1-6 micrograms/kg) into the vertebral artery or into the cisterna magna (5 micrograms/kg) produced a dose-dependent decrease in blood pressure, heart rate and renal sympathetic nerve activity in intact anaesthetized dogs and baroreceptor-denervated dogs. 8-OH-DPAT reduced the renal sympathetic nerve activity without changing the blood pressure or heart rate in catecholamine-depleted animals. Methiothepin (0.2 mg/kg) injected into the vertebral artery reduced the blood pressure without changing the heart rate or renal sympathetic nerve activity in baroreceptor-denervated dogs. The pressor response to i.v. phenylephrine was largely attenuated. Subsequent administration of 8-OH-DPAT (3 micrograms/kg) into the vertebral artery failed to alter the sympathetic discharge. Methiothepin (0.2 mg/kg) injected into the vertebral artery reversed the sympatho-inhibitory effect of 8-OH-DPAT (3 micrograms/kg) injected by the same route without changing the blood pressure. (+/-)Pindolol (0.2 mg/kg) injected into the vertebral artery of baroreceptor-denervated dogs reduced the blood pressure and heart rate without changing renal sympathetic activity. Subsequent administration of 8-OH-DPAT (3 micrograms/kg) failed to alter the sympathetic discharge. Bilateral microinjection of 8-OH-DPAT (1 microgram) into the nucleus tractus solitarii or into the medullary raphe nuclei failed to alter the blood pressure, heart rate or renal sympathetic activity. In contrast, bilateral microinjections of 8-OH-DPAT into the ventrolateral pressor area (VLPA) (0.2 microgram) produced a marked decrease in blood pressure, heart rate and renal sympathetic nerve activity. These effects were prevented or reversed by microinjections of methiothepin (10 micrograms) at the same sites. These results indicate that the central sympatho-inhibitory effects of 8-OH-DPAT were due to the stimulation of 5-HT1A receptors located in the ventrolateral pressor area. 5-HT autoreceptors did not seem to be involved.", 
    "7": "We used an algebraic model of resting heart rate (HRr), HRr-mn (HRo), to compare resting parasympathetic (n) and sympathetic (m) influence, intrinsic heart rate (HRo), and resting autonomic balance (Abal) in ten endurance-trained (ET) and ten nontrained (NT) men. The values of m, n, and Abal were determined by selective pharmacological blockade with atropine and metoprolol. HRo was obtained during double blockade with atropine and metoprolol. HRo and HRr were significantly lower (P less than or equal to 0.04 and P less than or equal to 0.01, respectively) in the ET subjects (79.5 +/- 2.8 beats.min-1 and 54.7 +/- 3.0 beats.min-1, respectively) when compared to the NT subjects (86.6 +/- 2.5 beats.min1 and 70.2 +/- 3.1 beats.min-1, respectively). Parasympathetic influence (n) was greater in the ET subjects (P less than or equal to 0.04), while sympathetic influence (m) was slightly (P less than or equal to 0.05) less in the ET subjects. Consequently, the value of Abal was significantly less in the ET subjects (P less than or equal to 0.02), indicating that resting parasympathetic predominance was significantly greater in the ET subjects. We concluded that the exercise training bradycardia, observed in this group of subjects, was due to both a lower HRo and an Abal with an augmented parasympathetic dominance.",

    "9": "A double-blind, crossover, randomized placebo controlled study involving 15 patients with effort stable angina, was carried out to assess atenolol (A) 100 mg during an 8-week period. Thereafter, atenolol antianginal efficacy was evaluated in a 6-month follow-up open non-comparative study. No antianginal drugs other than A were administered except for isosorbide dinitrate 5 mg when necessary. At the end of the 2-week wash-out period, and at the end of each 2-week period during the crossover phase of the study, and every 12 weeks during the 6-month follow-up, an ergometric test was performed and the following parameters were evaluated: HR, SBP, DP, Total Work Load (TWL) and S-T changes. The Barlett's test was performed to assess variance homogeneity, while the Tukey Hd test was used to evaluate the parameters during the treatments. During atenolol, the reduction in SBP was close to statistical significance, HR and S-T were significantly reduced (p less than or equal to 0.05) whereas TWL was significantly increased (p less than or equal to 0.05). During long-term atenolol treatment, all cardiovascular parameters clearly improved in comparison to the placebo period, confirming the antianginal efficacy of atenolol, even in the long-term treatment.", 
    "10": "We compared reflex chronotropic responses to intravenously infused drugs in three groups of age-matched normotensive female rats, namely, Sprague-Dawley, lean Zucker, and obese Zucker. Initial mean pressures did not differ between rat groups, but heart rates tended to be lower in obese Zucker rats. Baroreflex impairment was already evident, because heart rate responses to infused phenylephrine (reflex bradycardia) or sodium nitroprusside (reflex tachycardia) were consistently weaker in obese Zucker than in other rats. Regardless of rat grouping, subsequent cholinergic blockade with atropine elevated, whereas beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol lowered, basal heart rates without affecting mean pressure. Reflex heart rate responses were all appreciably reduced after either type of autonomic blockade, and although the extent of inhibition varied between rat groups, the residual heart rate responses remaining after blockade were nonetheless always smaller in obese than in lean rats. This difference suggests that efferent sympathetic and parasympathetic mechanisms normally responsible for mediating heart rate reflexes were unevenly blunted in obese Zucker rats.", 
    "11": "The acute effect of labetalol hydrochloride, a combined nonspecific beta-adrenergic and postsynaptic alpha 1-adrenergic blocker, on maternal hemodynamics and organ perfusion was investigated in 10 hypertensive, term-pregnant, spontaneously hypertensive rats with the use of the radioactive-labeled microsphere technique. The normal fall in blood pressure during pregnancy was prevented by the reduction of litter size to two conceptuses on day 7 of gestation. Labetalol (1 to 6 mg/kg) effectively lowered mean arterial pressure 22% by decreasing cardiac output 16%; total peripheral resistance was not significantly decreased. Thus, the blood pressure lowering effect of labetalol was due primarily to its beta-adrenergic blocking effect. Regional flows to the carcass and splanchnic circulation were decreased 19% and 15%, respectively, after labetalol administration. Uterine wall and ovarian perfusion were significantly reduced, but placental perfusion was not significantly altered. Because labetalol lowers blood pressure without reducing placental perfusion, it may be a useful alternative to hydralazine for the treatment of hypertensive emergencies in pregnancy.", 
    "12": "Recently, gastrin releasing peptide (GRP) was demonstrated to occur within normal thyroidal C cells. In the present study, the effects of GRP on basal and stimulated thyroid hormone secretion were investigated in the mouse according to the McKenzie technique. Iodine-deficient mice were pretreated with 125I and thyroxine. GRP was found dose-dependently to increase the basal radioiodine levels after iv injection, reflecting a stimulation of basal thyroid hormone secretion. The effect was maximal at a dose level of 3.0 nmol/animal, and at 2 h after injection, when GRP had increased blood radioiodine levels to 152 +/- 8% compared with 96 +/- 5% in controls (P less than 0.001). GRP seemed to exert additive effects on thyroid hormone secretion with vasoactive intestinal peptide and with TSH at a threshold dose level. In contrast, GRP did not influence the stimulatory effects of either a half-maximal dose level of TSH or noradrenaline. Furthermore, neither L-propranolol nor methylatropine influenced the GRP-induced thyroid hormone secretion. It is concluded that GRP has the capacity to stimulate basal thyroid hormone secretion in the mouse.", 
    "13": "Transmural stimulation (TS) produced a frequency-dependent contraction of the longitudinal muscles from the lesser curvature of the guinea pig antrum, which was abolished by atropine. On the other hand, a response to TS of the strips from the greater curvature was biphasic: a rapid contraction followed by a relaxation, which was abolished by tetrodotoxin. By pretreatment with atropine, rapid contraction of the biphasic response evoked by TS in the greater curvature was abolished and relaxation was augmented. Relaxation to TS of the greater curvature was not affected by prazocine, yohimbine, phentolamine, propranolol, theophylline, apamin, alpha-chymotrypsin, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide receptor antagonist. Different innervation mechanisms were suggested to be present in the longitudinal muscles between the lesser curvature (innervated with excitatory cholinergic neurons) and the greater curvature (innervated with excitatory cholinergic neurons and nonadrenergic inhibitory neurons) of the guinea pig antrum.", 
    "14": "The effects of increasing doses of propranolol were studied in awake portal hypertensive rats in order to elucidate the relative effects of the beta-blocker on systemic and splanchnic circulation. Hemodynamic responses to 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 mg per min infusions of propranolol were compared with placebo in awake rats with portal hypertension due to portal vein stenosis. Heart rate significantly and progressively decreased from 356 +/- 13 to 293 +/- 10 beats per min (mean +/- S.E.). Cardiac output significantly decreased from 54 +/- 3 to 42 +/- 3 ml per min per 100 gm body weight at the highest dose. Significant decrease in portal tributary blood flow from 27 +/- 1 to 18 +/- 1 ml per min, at 0.4 mg per min dose, was due not only to the decrease in cardiac output but also to a significant increase in portal tributary vascular resistance from 269 +/- 17 to 368 +/- 31 dyne per sec per cm5 x 10(3). However, portal pressure showed only an insignificant decrease from 14.9 +/- 1.1 to 14.1 +/- 1.4 mmHg. The reduction in portal pressure being minimal, in spite of a significant decrease in portal tributary blood flow, is explained by an increase in combined hepatic and collateral resistance from 44 +/- 2 to 66 +/- 4 dyne per sec per cm5 x 10(3), p less than 0.05, at 0.4 mg per min dose. We conclude that the systemic and splanchnic effects of propranolol show discrepancy at two levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Cocaine hydrochloride always resulted in the accumulation of transudative ascitic fluid (saline controls, no measurable ascitic fluid; cocaine administration, 20.2 +/- 12.9 micrograms per mouse; ascitic fluid protein concentration, 23.5 +/- 8.5 g/L). Propranolol hydrochloride administered before or after intravenous cocaine hydrochloride resulted in a striking reduction in mortality (84 of 84 mice without propranolol died [mortality = 100%]; 7 of 39 mice with propranolol died [mortality = 18%]; P less than 0.001).",

    "21": "An understanding of the regulation of CRF secretion in rats is currently incomplete, in part due to the lack of sensitive in vitro models available for studying this neuropeptide. In particular, the effects of catecholamines on CRF secretion, and the receptor subtypes mediating these actions have long been the subject of much debate. A cultured cell model has been adapted for studying secretory responses of hypothalamic cells of 1-week-old rats. Between 7-16 days in monolayer culture the cells secreted detectable levels of immunoreactive CRF, and this release was paralleled by the appearance of punctate bead-like regions of immunoreactivity along fine cellular processes. CRF secretion was increased up to 4-fold by norepinephrine (EC50, approximately 0.5 microM). The increase in CRF secretion produced by norepinephrine was blocked by the beta-receptor antagonist propranolol, but not by the alpha-antagonist prazosin. Moreover, the beta-receptor agonist isoproterenol significantly elevated CRF secretion, whereas the alpha-agonist phenylephrine was without effect, except at high concentrations. Addition of phenylephrine, however, potentiated the effect of isoproterenol, but this response was still significantly less than that produced by norepinephrine. Forskolin (EC50, approximately 0.7 microM) and the active phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (EC50, approximately 40 nM) also increased CRF secretion by 3- to 4-fold. Inactive phorbol derivatives had no effect on CRF release from these cultures. The results indicate that cultured neonatal rat hypothalamic cells are a powerful model for the study of CRF release in vitro, and that norepinephrine acts directly at the isolated cell level to stimulate secretion of this peptide, primarily by activating beta-adrenoceptors. The results also suggest that at least two functional second messenger systems (adenylate cyclase and protein kinase-C) are involved in CRF secretion and are already functional in the neonatal hypothalamus.", 
    "22": "Experiments were performed on 54 anesthetized, open-chest dogs to observe the effect of cardiac sympathetic nerves and alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockades on changes of platelet function during the early phase of myocardial ischemia. It was shown that contents of TXB2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha after coronary occlusion were markedly increased, and the platelet count was reduced in the coronary venous blood of ischemic myocardium. It was found that the changes in parameters of platelet function after coronary occlusion were significantly relieved by topical application of lignocaine-soaked gauze pads to the ischemic area of the heart or by bilateral stellectomy for blocking impulse of afferent and efferent of cardiac sympathetic nerves, compared with changes in parameters of control group, P less than 0.01. On the other hand, changes in parameters of the control group could be restored by intravenous infusion of noradrenaline to dogs which bilateral stellectomy was performed on, but not by infusion of normal saline. Different effects of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockades on the changes in aforementioned parameters were found. The changing degrees in elevation of TXB2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and in decrease of platelet count were significantly relieved by intravenous infusion of yohimbine (an alpha 2-blocker), phentolamine (a nonselective alpha-blocker), and propranolol (a beta-blocker), but not by infusion of prazosin (an alpha 1-blocker). Results were compared with the control group, P less than 0.01. These results suggest that cardiac sympathetic nerves play an important role for the changes of platelet function during the early phase of myocardial ischemia and that, yohimbine and phentolamine may exert an improving effect by blocking alpha 2-receptors on the platelet membrane, and propranolol may directly contribute to stabilization of the platelet membrane.",

One-hundred and ninety-five males, 56.2 +/- 6.2 years old and one-hundred and seventy-eight females, 57.1 +/- 6.2 years old, coming from the IPPPSH and still under double-blind treatment with or without a beta-blocker (oxprenolol 160 mg SR), were studied by means of the Jenkins Activity Survey form C and several tests from the Cognitive Behavioural Assessment Battery (CBA-2.0). Seventy-four point eight percent of the patients showed a \"type A\" pattern, and 25.5% were in the extreme predictive interval for coronary heart disease according to WCGS. \"Type A\" pattern was not influenced by variables such as age, sex, education, job or previous pharmacological treatment. The patients studied did not show any particular psychological distress at the psychometric evaluation. However, special social and cultural characteristics and different therapies influenced some symptoms, such as anxiety, depression and somatic lamentation. According to this study: \"type A\" behaviour seems to be a steady feature of the hypertensive patient; furthermore, it seems to be due to a \"biological imprinting\" which can be considered a cause of hypertension; psychological distress depends on a particular set of environmental stimuli. In the first case an accurate prevention is needed while, in the second case adequate pharmacological and/or psychological therapies are needed.", 
    "24": "Data indicate a close association between a decrease in feeding-induced brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis and an increase in food consumption. The present study examines the hypothesis that feeding-induced BAT thermogenesis, or feeding-induced changes in BAT glycogen, a mobile form of energy store and a correlate of BAT thermogenesis, may modulate feeding behavior. We report that propranolol, which completely abolished meal-induced BAT thermogenesis, did not evoke intake of a larger meal. Though BAT glycogen concentration is a sensitive measure of the state of feeding, on a meal to meal basis it does not correlate with hunger and satiety. Hence the hypothesis is not supported by the current data. We also report that meal-induced BAT hypertrophy and glycogen deposition can be dissociated from meal-induced BAT thermogenesis.",

Lipoprotein lipase activity was almost doubled after prazosin (p less than 0.02) and practically unchanged after metoprolol, at a time and at a drug dosage when only minor changes in blood pressure and serum lipids were detectable. HDL cholesterol was slightly but significantly increased after prazosin (p less than 0.05). Heart rate was increased after prazosin (p less than 0.05) and decreased after metoprolol (p less than 0.01).", 
    "26": "Our previous studies indicate that the blockade of the sympathetic nervous system by spinal anesthesia or epidural anesthesia inhibits the release of TXA2 induced by limb ischemia with thigh tourniquet in patients with lower limb surgery. The present study was undertaken to confirm this phenomenon in anesthetized dogs. Twenty one anesthetized dogs underwent 60 min occlusion of the abdominal aorta and the inferior vena cava, followed by reperfusion. They were randomized into three groups: no treatment group and pretreatment groups with either 2 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine intrathecally or 4 mg.kg-1 of labetalol intravenously. In no treatment group plasma TXB2 levels were increased significantly after reperfusion. However, prior treatments with bupivacaine intrathecally or labetalol intravenously inhibited the increases in plasma TXB2 levels after reperfusion. These results suggest that limb ischemia stimulates the TXA2 production, which may be influenced not only by endothelial cell damage and the generation of oxygen free radicals but also by the activation of the sympathetic nervous system.", 
    "27": "The fall in blood pressure in response to atenolol 50 mg per day has been estimated using ambulatory BP and heart rate monitoring during the day in 35 mild to moderate hypertensive patients. The fall in pressure for the group averaged 18.2 +/- 11.3/11.5 +/- 8.3 mmHg. The 95% confidence internals were 14.5-22.0 mmHg systolic and 8.8-14.3 mmHg diastolic with the individual responses in diastolic pressure being related to the pretreatment variability of diastolic pressure (r = 0.65 P less than 0.001) and to the initial heart rate (r = 0.35 P less than 0.05). With atenolol treatment the BP fall is greater in patients with a more unstable BP. Blood pressure reduction is achieved by reducing the level of cardiac activity.", 
    "28": "Pineal melatonin synthesis is regulated by norepinephrine at beta-adrenergic receptors on pinealocytes. Melatonin released from the pineal is believed to be responsible for short photoperiod-induced gonadal regression. By blocking melatonin production at the beta-adrenergic receptor with beta-adrenergic antagonists, short photoperiod-induced gonadal regression was prevented. Propranolol or nadolol injected daily in the late afternoon prohibited short photoperiod-produced testicular regression in male Syrian hamsters. Likewise, propranolol and nadolol pellets were able to block short photoperiod-induced gonadal regression. Interestingly, in the presence of beta-adrenergic antagonists, gonadal regression was still produced by daily afternoon injections of melatonin. These results indicate that propranolol or nadolol can be used to \"pharmacologically pinealectomize\" hamsters and block the physiological action of the pineal.", 
    "29": "The objective of this study was to measure pressure gradients in the coronary circulation following the administration of three receptor-blocking drugs, propranolol, phentolamine, and atropine when administered singly and in sequence. As well, we examined the responses of these gradients to eight interventions: left stellate ganglion or left vagosympathetic trunk stimulation, administration of isoproterenol, acetylcholine, noradrenaline, adenosine, phenylephrine, or adrenaline. Using a multiple linear regression model we examined the actions and interactions of the receptor-blocking agents on hemodynamic variables and vascular gradients. Propranolol reduced heart rate as expected and blocked the responses to isoproterenol administration. As well, it abolished the epicardial coronary artery diastolic gradient. The gradient was restored when propranolol was the second receptor blocker administered but was abolished when it was the third. Phentolamine induced vasodilation with a decrease in coronary small vessel gradients. This effect persisted without regard to the sequence of administration. When it was the second or third agent it decreased the microcirculation and small vein gradients, an action it did not manifest when given singly. Atropine singly did not alter pressures or gradients; but as the second agent it altered the transmural, outflow tract, epicardial diastolic, and microcirculation and small vein diastolic gradients; and as the third agent the changes were in the transmural, epicardial systolic and diastolic, and small artery systolic and diastolic gradients. The pattern of responses was not predictable and that indicates that unique changes occur in the responses of the coronary circulation when multiple receptor-blocking agents are employed. Adrenergic control tends to dominate in the coronary arterial circulation, and muscarinic control in the coronary microcirculation and veins with considerable overlap.", 
    "30": "To determine the effects of concurrent beta 1-adrenoceptor blocker or calcium channel antagonist administration on the haemodynamic sequelae of an inhaled beta 2-selective adrenoceptor agonist bronchodilator, we examined echocardiographically the effects of fenoterol (400 micrograms) by metered dose inhaler following oral pre-treatment with (a) placebo, (b) atenolol or (c) diltiazem. Following placebo, fenoterol produced significant decreases in diastolic blood pressure (14% +/- 6%), total peripheral vascular resistance (TPR) (31% +/- 9%) and end-systolic stress (ESS) (15% +/- 21%). Cardiac output rose significantly (42% +/- 23%) as did heart rate (25% +/- 13%). After atenolol, responses to fenoterol were significantly blunted. Post-fenoterol heart rate, systolic blood pressure, % fractional shortening, stroke volume, ejection fraction, cardiac output and pressure/volume ratio increased significantly less after atenolol pre-treatment as compared to placebo pretreatment. TPR decreased significantly less. After diltiazem pre-treatment, the response to inhaled fenoterol was not different from that following placebo pre-treatment. We conclude that atenolol blunts the haemodynamic changes induced by fenoterol inhalation whereas diltiazem has little effect.", 
    "31": "1. The effect of variable alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) and albumin (HSA) concentrations on the binding of prazosin and propranolol was assessed in plasma after surgery and in mixtures of AAG/HSA with concentrations mimicking those found in vivo. 2. On the pre-operative day the binding of prazosin and propranolol was 94.8% and 89.0%, respectively and 97.3% and 93.2%, respectively, 5 days after surgery. 3. In solutions containing mixtures of highly purified AAG and HSA representing the pre-operative state, 88.6% and 83.9% binding of prazosin and propranolol was observed, whereas for solutions mimicking post-operative plasma, the equivalent values were 94.6% and 91.4%, respectively. 4. The ratios between bound and unbound concentrations of both drugs were closely correlated to the concentrations of AAG, but not to the concentrations of HSA. 5. The present study demonstrates that AAG is responsible for the binding variability of prazosin and propranolol in plasma from post-operative patients.", 
    "32": "We examined the left ventricular functional response to externally applied vibration using four canine open chest preparations. A sinusoidal 30 Hz vibration (2.7 mm in amplitude) was applied to the ventricular epicardium at each level of propranolol-induced myocardial depression. External vibration in control conditions induced no significant change either in peak left ventricular pressure (LVP) or in stroke volume (SV). With propranolol, 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg, peak LVP and SV were depressed by the application of external vibration, even though there was no significant change of these values in the nonvibrating condition compared to control. We conclude that the ventricular response to vibration depends on the underlying myocardial viability.", 
    "33": "In this study we investigated three possible mechanisms for the decreased airway responsiveness (AR) found in young lambs. To evaluate aerosol delivery, 6 adult sheep (9 mo-3 yr old) and 12 lambs (4-8 wk old) were challenged with aerosol (aH) and intravenous histamine (ivH). Awake animals were intubated and studied in a plethysmograph, which measured dynamic compliance (Cdyn), resistance of the lung, and functional residual capacity. AR to histamine was measured by administration of increasing concentrations of histamine until a significant change in lung mechanics occurred or until the maximum dose of histamine was given. In all six adult sheep, the response to both aH and iVH was a decrease in Cdyn. In two lambs Cdyn was decreased with both aH and ivH, in five lambs with neither, in three lambs with aH only, and in two lambs with ivH only. To examine the role of beta-adrenergic activity in determining AR, six adult sheep and six lambs received ivH and on a separate day ivH with propranolol pretreatment (p + ivH). The median effective dose of histamine that caused a reduction in Cdyn to 65% of normal saline control (ED65Cdyn) for the adult sheep given ivH was 3.60 (range 0.23-4.85) and 0.70 (range 0.49-8.0) micrograms.kg-1.min-1 for p + ivH (P = NS). The median ED65Cdyn for the six lambs was 8.0 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 for both ivH alone and p + ivH. To evaluate the role of airway smooth muscle (SM), AR to aH was quantitated in six adult sheep and six lambs, and then an open-lung biopsy was performed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "34": "We present the study protocol of the Spanish trial on sudden death (STSD) project, to be carried out in collaboration with 24 hospitals (see Annex). The objective of the project is to investigate the effect of antiarrhythmic treatment on the incidence of sudden death of postmyocardial infarction patients with potentially malignant ventricular arrhythmias. A comparison will be made of three patient groups classified according to ejection fraction (EF) and the presence or absence of ventricular arrhythmias. Patients with EF less than 20% and ventricular arrhythmias (group B.1.1) will be randomized into a captopril group and a captopril plus amiodarone group; patients with EF = 20-45% and ventricular arrhythmias (group B.2.1.) will be randomized into amiodarone, metoprolol and placebo groups, and patients with EF greater than 45% (group B.3) will act as controls. Over a projected study period of approximately 3 years we hope to recruit a minimum of 60 patients in the B.1.1. group and 800 patients in the B.2.1. group. Patients and controls will be followed up periodically for 3-4 years. With a series of this size we hope to be able to confirm the effectiveness of treatment with 80-90% accuracy (1-beta) and a level of statistical significance (1-alpha) of 95%.", 
    "35": "The effects of one month's treatment with each of nifedipine, verapamil, diltiazem, propranolol and placebo, given in random order, on fasting plasma glucose, haemoglobin Alc, serum fructosamine, immunoreactive insulin, cholesterol, and triglyceride were studied in a group of 19 patients with hypertension and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. The metabolic effects of the active drugs were generally small but fasting plasma glucose was increased by propranolol from 9.3 +/- 3.0 to 10.4 +/- 3.4 mmol/l (P less than 0.01) (mean +/- SD) and to 10.1 +/- 3.2 mmol/l (P less than 0.05) by nifedipine. Serum fructosamine was increased from 2.75 +/- 0.53 to 2.89 +/- 0.62 mmol/l (P less than 0.05) by diltiazem and to 2.91 +/- 0.65 (P less than 0.05) by propranolol. Verapamil increased fasting serum immunoreactive insulin: diltiazem and propranolol tended to reduce it. Propranolol but not the other drugs significantly increased serum triglyceride. Calcium antagonists may be preferable to beta adrenoceptor blockers for the treatment of hypertensive diabetics. Of the three calcium antagonists we studied, verapamil may have advantages over nifedipine and diltiazem.", 
    "36": "We studied the ocular hypotensive efficacy and safety of 0.5% levobunolol hydrochloride and 0.5% timolol maleate administered topically once daily for 3 months in 91 patients (46 in the levobunolol group and 45 in the timolol group) with primary or secondary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. In this randomized double-masked parallel clinical study, intraocular pressure (IOP) was successfully controlled in 78% of the patients who received levobunolol and 89% of those who received timolol. The overall mean decrease in IOP was 5.6 mm Hg (decrease of 23%) in the levobunolol group and 6.7 mm Hg (26%) in the timolol group, a nonsignificant difference. In both groups the overall mean IOP during treatment was significantly lower than the pretreatment value (p less than 0.001). For both treatment groups changes in heart rate and blood pressure were minimal. We conclude that both 0.5% levobunolol and 0.5% timolol administered once daily are effective and safe in lowering IOP in most patients with ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma.", 
    "37": "Medical treatment, intraocular pressure (IOP) and adverse drug reactions were recorded in a prospective multicentre study of 71 unselected, newly diagnosed cases of open-angle glaucoma. Eight ophthalmologists recorded standard information at five visits over a mean interval of 12.1 months. No limitations were imposed on the choice of drugs or interval between visits. The IOP was satisfactorily controlled throughout the follow-up period with the first drug prescribed in 36% of eyes. In an additional 10% to 13% the IOP was stabilized with alternative therapy, prescribed for approximately one-third of eyes per visit. A total of 27 patients reported 18 severe and 31 mild suspected adverse reactions during the follow-up period. Survival analysis showed that there was no significant difference between the proportions of patients continuing treatment with the first, second and third drug prescribed (half-life of treatment approximately 210 days in all three cases). However, when only changes for unsatisfactory pressure were considered, the half-life of treatment was significantly longer, 350 days (p = 0.02).", 
    "38": "Fifty-five patients completed a 5-week double-blind study comparing alprazolam, propranolol, and placebo in the treatment of panic disorder and agoraphobia with panic attacks. There was no concomitant behavioral treatment. Patient and therapist rating scales included Sheehan's Panic and Anxiety Attack Scales, the Marks-Sheehan Phobia Scale, the Hamilton Anxiety Scale, the Hamilton Depression Scale, and the Side Effects Checklist. The results generally support the efficacy of alprazolam, but not propranolol, in the treatment of panic disorder and agoraphobia with panic attacks. The significance of the results are discussed, as well as a number of the unique aspects of our procedures and patient population.", 
    "39": "A randomized controlled trial of propranolol was conducted in 36 adult cirrhotic patients after active esophageal variceal hemorrhage had been controlled. Seventy-eight percent of the 18 patients on propranolol and 72% of the patients on a placebo were of Pugh's class A. Of the patients treated with propranolol, 94%, 87%, 68% and 57% were free from rebleeding 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after entry, respectively. The corresponding figures in control patients were 81%, 59%, 30% and 15%, respectively. The percentages of patients free from rebleeding were significantly higher in the propranolol group than in the control group (P less than 0.05). No significant adverse effect was observed during the study, except for a patient who developed hepatic decompensation 14 months after propranolol therapy. It was concluded that propranolol was a safe and effective drug for the prevention of variceal rebleeding in patients with good liver functional reserve.", 
    "40": "The present study used recordings of visual potentials evoked by pattern reversal (VEPs) to investigate the central effects of three drugs used in migraine prophylaxis: the calcium channel blocker nifedipine, the beta-1-selective blocker metoprolol, and the nonselective beta adrenoreceptor blocker propranolol. The study involved 58 patients with common or classical migraine who were treated in a double-blind randomized study over a period of 7 months, while the effectiveness of prophylactic treatment was recorded in headache diaries that were subjected to time series analysis. VEPs were recorded at the beginning of a 2-month baseline period without treatment, after 4 months of treatment, and at the end of a 3-month washout period. At baseline, migraine patients had significantly higher VEP amplitudes and longer latencies than did a group of 87 healthy control subjects. Patients were separated by statistical analysis into responders and nonresponders to each prophylactic treatment. Nifedipine had no effects on the frequency, intensity, and duration of migraine attacks, nor on amplitude and latency of the VEPs. In contrast, the use of beta blockers resulted in a significant decrease in VEP amplitude, both in responders and nonresponders, whereas VEP latency remained unchanged. VEP amplitudes returned to the initial values at follow-up in the nonresponders, but stayed at lower levels in responders. Beta blockers thus appear to have a significant effect on the increased excitability of the visual system in patients with migraine, although their action is not directly related to their reduction of migraine frequency.", 
    "41": "It was recently reported that electrical stimulation of the hypothalamus could enhance the renin response to reductions in renal perfusion pressure. However, electrical stimulation of brain sites may activate neural pathways that never function physiologically. In the present investigation an external stress in the form of a jet of air to the face was applied to achieve a more physiological activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Conscious restrained rats, instrumented with pneumatic occluding cuffs around the aorta proximal to the renal arteries, were used to determine the relationship between renal perfusion pressure (RPP) and plasma renin activity (PRA) in the control state and in the presence of the stress. The jet of air produced a rightward shift in the relationship between RPP and PRA and also increased the slope, suggesting an enhanced sensitivity. Both the rightward shift and the increase in slope were absent in animals with bilateral renal denervation. In animals with adrenal enucleation, the rightward shift was still present but there was no significant increase in the sensitivity. These data suggest that an external activation of the central nervous system (by a stress) has the potential to modulate the responsiveness of the kidney to nonneural stimuli for renin secretion.", 
    "42": "We have reported that the renin response to systemic hypotension during a simultaneous increase in left atrial pressure (LAP) depends, in part, on intact renal nerves. Because efferent neural control of renin release is mediated by renal sympathetic nerves, we tested the hypothesis that withdrawal of renal sympathetic tone is an essential component of the inhibitory mechanism. In conscious dogs, the ascending aorta was partially constricted to produce a simultaneous decrease, of up to 30%, in renal perfusion pressure (RPP) and a rise in LAP. Sympathetic neural control of renin release was reversibly blocked with propranolol. Propranolol infusion did not affect the increases in LAP or atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) during ascending aortic constriction. There was no increase in renin (P greater than 0.1) during ascending aortic constriction, with or without propranolol infusion. Identical reductions in RPP during constriction of the abdominal aorta caused renin to rise (P less than 0.03). Therefore acute withdrawal of renal sympathetic tone is not necessary for the inhibition of the renin response to systemic hypotension by elevated LAP.", 
    "43": "In 1350 patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction, serum potassium was analysed in the emergency ward. The effect of metoprolol was compared with placebo in a double-blind randomized trial. Metoprolol increased serum potassium from 4.11 +/- 0.02 mmol/l to 4.27 +/- 0.02 mmol/l (P less than 0.001) during the 1st day after hospital admission, whereas serum potassium levels remained fairly constant in patients given placebo during the same time (4.11 +/- 0.02 to 4.14 +/- 0.02 mmol/l; P greater than 0.2). Similar results were obtained when analysing patients with a confirmed myocardial infarction separately. The effects appeared homogeneously distributed in subgroups related to sex, clinical history, infarct site, infarct size and delay time from onset of symptoms to start of treatment. We conclude that early treatment with the beta-1-selective blocker metoprolol in patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction increases serum potassium.", 
    "44": "The effects of oral verapamil, 320 mg daily, propranolol, 120 to 160 mg daily, and placebo were compared in 16 patients presenting with transient myocardial ischemia without evidence of coronary atherosclerosis or vasospasm on angiography (syndrome X). Testing was done according to a randomized double-blind crossover placebo-controlled trial consisting of 3 consecutive 7-day treatment periods with verapamil or propranolol or placebo. Patients underwent continuous 48-hour electrocardiographic monitoring before therapy (run-in phase) and during the last 2 days of each treatment period. A total of 391 episodes of diagnostic (greater than or equal to 0.15 mV) ST depression was recorded during the trial. Of these, 23 were symptomatic. None of the episodes occurred while the patients were asleep, 25% during exercise, 35% during minimal physical activity and 40% at rest. Rest included activities demanding mental arousal (conversation, reading or watching television). Heart rate at the onset of ST depression was higher (greater than or equal to 10 beats/min) than that observed in the 5 minutes preceding ischemia in 95% of the episodes. In the group as a whole, the average number of ischemic episodes per 24 hours was significantly reduced during propranolol therapy compared with placebo (0.7 +/- 0.6 vs 3.9 +/- 1.8; p less than 0.0005). No significant differences were seen during verapamil treatment (3.4 +/- 1.7 vs 3.9 +/- 1.8). It is concluded that transient myocardial ischemia in syndrome X is mostly precipitated by an increase in oxygen consumption, presumably due to a heightened sympathetic activity. Accordingly, beta blockers may represent the first line of treatment.", 
    "45": "1. Acute haemorrhage was simulated in five unanaesthetized rabbits, by inflating a cuff on the inferior vena cava so that cardiac output fell by 8.3% of its resting level per minute. Simulated haemorrhage was performed after sham treatment, after graded doses of intravenous and intracisternal naloxone, and after cardiac nerve blockade with intrapericardial procaine. 2. After sham treatment, the haemodynamic response to simulated haemorrhage was biphasic. During the first phase, systemic vascular conductance fell steadily, heart rate rose steadily, and arterial pressure fell only slightly. A second decompensatory phase began abruptly when cardiac output had fallen to approximately 55% of its resting level. Vascular conductance rose steeply, heart rate fell slowly, and arterial pressure fell precipitately. 3. Treatment with naloxone (intravenous, 0.04-0.4 mg kg-1; intracisternal, 0.2-2 micrograms kg-1) did not affect either phase of the haemodynamic response to simulated haemorrhage. 4. After treatment with larger doses of naloxone (intravenous, 4-8 mg kg-1; intracisternal, 4-69 micrograms kg-1), the first phase was unaffected, but the second phase no longer occurred. Throughout simulated haemorrhage, systemic vascular conductance fell steadily, heart rate rose, and arterial pressure was well maintained. The dose of intracisternal naloxone which prevented the second phase was 90-900 times less than the corresponding intravenous dose. The second phase was also prevented by cardiac nerve blockade. 5. We conclude that an endogenous opiate mechanism is responsible for the haemodynamic decompensation that occurs when cardiac output falls to a critical level. The mechanism is located within the central nervous system. It is triggered by a signal from the heart.", 
    "46": "(+/-) Propranolol (1-50 mg/kg), (+) propranolol (50 mg/kg) and pindolol (10-50 mg/kg) exhibited significant protective effects against MES (maximum electroshock seizures), whereas, timolol (1 mg/kg), the propranolol analog, UM-272 (1 and 10 mg/kg), and the beta-agonist, terbutaline (1 and 10 mg/kg) were ineffective. Cholinergic agents, physostigmine (0.01-1.0 mg/kg), and atropine (1 and 10 mg/kg), the serotonin antagonist, cyproheptadine (0.05 mg/kg), and the prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor, indomethacin (10 mg/kg), were also without effect on the MES extensor phase. Further, pretreatment of mice with terbutaline, atropine, cyproheptadine or indomethacin did not influence the anti-MES effect of propranolol to any significant extent. The results indicate that the observed anticonvulsant effects of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists are unrelated to noradrenergic or other central neurotransmitter systems and that a non-specific mechanism, probably a membrane stabilizing effect is involved.", 
    "47": "Drugs classified as beta-blockers have proved to be valuable in the treatment of patients with glaucoma. Timolol has become the most widely used ocular hypotensive agent. Actual and potential side effects associated with its non-selective beta-blockade have prevented its use in patients with reactive airways disease, and to a lesser extent, with various cardiovascular conditions. Betaxolol is a relatively selective beta-1 blocker which in most patients is almost as effective as timolol in lowering intraocular pressure, and may be partly additive with dipivefrin. It is probably safer in patients unable to tolerate non-selective beta-blockers. However, it needs to be used with caution in these patients, who are unpredictably susceptible to systemic side effects.", 
    "48": "An analysis of human peripheral blood intact mononuclear lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoreceptors showed that the hydrophilic radioligand 3H-CGP-12177 binds at various temperatures only to surface receptors. The density of receptors as determined by the binding of the lipophilic antagonist 125I-CYP at 37 degrees C is 2 times as high as that at 4 degrees C. The affinity of lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptors for 1-isoproterenol measured by the labeled ligand displacement at low (4 degrees C) temperatures is by two or three orders of magnitude higher than that at 37 degrees C. The thiol-alkylating agent, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) causes oppositely directed changes in the density of beta 2-adrenoceptors on intact lymphocytes depending on their original density. NEM increases the affinity of beta 2-adrenoreceptors for the hormone (1.5-12-fold). The state and regulation of human peripheral blood lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoreceptors depend on the hormonal status of patients at the moment of blood sample collection.", 
    "49": "1. In the anaesthetized dog external diameter of the left circumflex coronary artery and blood flow through that artery were measured to allow the effect of noradrenaline to be compared in large arteries and resistance vessels. 2. The injection of noradrenaline (0.5 micrograms kg-1) into the coronary artery, after bilateral vagotomy and antagonism of beta-adrenoreceptors, decreased large coronary artery diameter and coronary blood flow. Calculation of resistance in the large coronary artery and in the total left circumflex coronary vascular bed revealed that noradrenaline induced increases of 66% and 89% respectively. 3. Intra-coronary (i.c.) injection of the alpha 1-adrenoreceptor agonist phenylephrine (0.5-2 micrograms kg-1) decreased large coronary artery diameter and coronary blood flow. The alpha 2-adrenoreceptor agonist B-HT 920 (0.5-2 micrograms kg-1 i.c.) decreased coronary blood flow but did not significantly affect large coronary artery diameter. 4. Antagonism of alpha 1-adrenoreceptors with prazosin (10 micrograms kg-1 i.c.) abolished the noradrenaline-induced constriction of the large coronary artery but only partially attenuated the decrease in blood flow. The alpha 2-adrenoreceptor antagonist idazoxan (50 micrograms kg-1 i.c.) partially attenuated the noradrenaline-induced decrease in coronary blood flow but did not affect the large artery constriction. 5. It is concluded that noradrenaline constricts both large and small coronary arteries. Noradrenaline-induced constriction of the resistance vessels is more powerful than in the large artery. The constriction of large arteries in response to noradrenaline is mediated by alpha 1-adrenoreceptors. Postjunctional alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoreceptors are both involved in the constriction of the resistance vessels.", 
    "50": "To compare the intracellular distribution of beta-adrenoceptors in isolated myocytes of SHR with that of age-matched WKY and to examine changes in the distribution with aging, we measured the number of cell surface and total beta-adrenoceptors in 6-(young groups) and 37-week old (old groups) SHR and WKY. The number of surface beta-adrenoceptors was significantly lower in 6-week old SHR compared with that in age-matched WKY. But there was no difference in the number of total beta-adrenoceptors between the two groups. The number of surface beta-adrenoceptors in old groups was significantly reduced compared with that in the young groups, in both SHR and WKY. However, the number of total beta-adrenoceptors in the old groups did not show any difference from that in the young groups. Isoproterenol-stimulated c-AMP formation in 6-week old SHR was significantly lower than that of WKY of the same age. Isoproterenol-stimulated c-AMP formation in the old groups was significantly reduced than that of the young groups in both SHR and WKY. These results suggested that (1) there may be a difference in the intracellular distribution of cardiac beta-adrenoceptors between 6-week old SHR and WKY, (2) the intracellular distribution of cardiac beta-adrenoceptors may be changed with aging, and (3) intracellular distribution might be related to the difference in c-AMP formation to beta-agonist.", 
    "51": "B antagonists eye drops are most effective for the treatment of chronic open angle glaucoma. By this way of administration they have a very good systemic bioavailability. Bronchial, and cardiovascular effects of three of these topicals: timolol, carteolol and metipranolol have been evaluated in three parallel groups of asthmatic patients. The three topics induce bronchoconstriction without significant difference between them, and lower heart rate (sometimes very intensely) whatever the B antagonist studied. From these data, it is recommended to practitioners to follow carefully the rules of administration of B blockers, even in eye drops.", 
    "52": "A pressor response has been observed with propranolol, a nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, in animals given a nonselective alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist. This study investigates whether a pressor response to propranolol occurs in conscious unrestrained rats following a hypotensive response induced by phentolamine (nonselective alpha-antagonist), prazosin (selective alpha 1-antagonist) and (or) rauwolscine (selective alpha 2-antagonist), sodium nitroprusside (smooth muscle relaxant), or methacholine (muscarinic agonist). The rats were subjected to a continuous infusion of a hypotensive agent or normal saline followed by i.v. injection of propranolol. The infusion of phentolamine significantly decreased mean arterial pressure (MAP). Subsequent injection of propranolol restored MAP to the control level. Prazosin and rauwolscine each caused a small but not significant decrease in MAP which was reversed by propranolol. Concurrent infusions of prazosin and rauwolscine caused a significant decrease in MAP. Subsequent injection of propranolol caused a large pressor response which increased MAP to 20% above control MAP prior to the administration of drugs. Nitroprusside or methacholine each caused a significant decrease in MAP, but the hypotension was not antagonized by propranolol. The concurrent infusions of a low dose of nitroprusside and prazosin caused a significant decrease in MAP which was reversed by propranolol. The infusion of saline did not alter MAP, and propranolol did not cause a pressor response. It is concluded that propranolol antagonizes the hypotensive effect of an alpha-blocker but not that of sodium nitroprusside or methacholine. Our results suggest the presence of a specific interaction between alpha- and beta-antagonists.", 
    "53": "1. Seven atopic subjects received two injections of antigen and one of saline intradermally in the back on each of 4 separate days. They were pretreated with four different drug combinations: (a) adrenaline 0.3 mg subcutaneously over the deltoid muscle (b) subcutaneous adrenaline preceded by 5 mg of the specific beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118,551 orally (c) 8 mg of salbutamol orally (d) placebo. Tablets were given 2 h before and subcutaneous injections 15 min before the intradermal injections of saline and antigen. 2. The median flare response to intradermal low dose antigen and high dose antigen after pretreatment with adrenaline was 4% and 49% of the response seen following pretreatment with placebo (P less than 0.001). When adrenaline was preceded by ICI-118,551, the corresponding median flare responses were 2% and 44% (P less than 0.001) of the placebo response. The flare response after pretreatment with salbutamol was not significantly different from placebo. 3. Adrenaline suppressed the median weal response to the higher dose of antigen to 52% of the response after pretreatment with placebo (P less than 0.05). This suppression by adrenaline was blocked by pretreatment with ICI 118,551. The median weal response after the highest dose of antigen was suppressed by salbutamol to 66% of the response seen after placebo, although this was not significant even when a further three subjects were studied with either salbutamol or placebo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "54": "The adrenergic nervous system profoundly alters water excretion by both renal and extrarenal pathways. The effects of catecholamines on cultured rat inner medullary collecting tubule cells were studied. The beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol, increases cAMP from 19.5 +/- 2.3 to 79.4 +/- 14.4 fm/micrograms protein, P less than 0.001. The response to arginine vasopressin (AVP) is also greater in the presence of isoproterenol, but the increment is unchanged when compared to that seen in the absence of AVP. The agonist effect of isoproterenol is blocked by propranolol but not by the specific beta 1 antagonist, atenolol. The effect of alpha-adrenergic stimulation was studied by the use of norepinephrine (NE) in the background of the beta blocker, propranolol. NE decreases AVP-stimulated cAMP generation from 190 +/- 11 to 117 +/- 10 fm/micrograms, P less than 0.001, N = 6. The specific alpha 2 antagonist, yohimbine, but not the alpha 1 antagonist, prazosin, prevents the NE-induced decrease as AVP-stimulated cAMP is restored to 187 +/- 19 fm/micrograms. Similarly the selective alpha 2 agonist, clonidine, significantly inhibits both AVP- and isoproterenol-mediated cAMP generation. To define the site of alpha 2 inhibition in the adenylate cyclase (AC) complex the effect of pertussis toxin (PT) was investigated. After pretreatment with PT (1-1000 ng/ml), AVP-stimulated cAMP was not inhibited by NE. The alpha 1 agonist, phenylephrine, fails to inhibit AC or to increase cytosolic Ca in these cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "55": "We investigated the mechanism of ethanol-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction in lambs, by a pharmacological approach. We chronically instrumented 28 lambs to determine whether phentolamine (alpha-block), propranolol (beta-block), promethazine and cimetidine (H1- and H2-block), high-dose indomethacin, or low- and high-dose meclofenamate (cyclooxygenase block) altered the vasoconstriction. Ethanol alone increased pulmonary vascular resistance from 0.14 to 0.49 Torr.ml-1.kg-1.min (U). Only indomethacin (7-8 mg/kg po) and high-dose meclofenamate (7-8 mg/kg iv) abolished the pulmonary vascular response to ethanol infusion. Pulmonary vascular resistance was 0.14 U after ethanol plus indomethacin and was 0.2 U after ethanol plus high-dose meclofenamate (P = NS vs. base line). Low-dose meclofenamate (2 mg/kg) attenuated the vasoconstrictor response. Systemic vascular resistance increased moderately after ethanol and had a similar pattern of inhibition by cyclooxygenase blockade. Cardiac output and heart rate decreased nearly significantly after ethanol (P less than 0.06), a tendency that was also ablated by cyclooxygenase inhibition. Thus the acute cardiocirculatory response to ethanol involves an intact prostaglandin synthase system in lambs. To our knowledge, these data are the first documentation that cyclooxygenase enzyme blockade can eliminate the acute cardiac and vascular effects of ethanol in a whole-animal system.", 
    "56": "The effects of beta-blockade on muscle utilization of glycogen and triglycerides, as well as potassium metabolism, were studied in eight healthy male subjects performing long-duration exercise to exhaustion. Subjects were studied after treatment with either placebo (PLAC), beta 1-selective (atenolol, 100 mg/day, AT), or nonselective beta-blockade (nadolol, 80 mg/day, NAD) each for 1 wk according to a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design. NAD and AT caused identical decreases in exercise heart rates, but endurance (71 +/- 8 min with PLAC) decreased significantly more with NAD (-33 +/- 4%) than with AT (-14 +/- 6%). Muscle glycogen breakdown, taking exercise time into account, was unaffected by treatment. In contrast, muscle triglyceride utilization was completely blocked by NAD whereas it was unchanged with AT as compared to PLAC. Adipose tissue lipolysis was inhibited to a similar extent by the two beta-blockers. Serum potassium increased to higher levels at exhaustion and muscle potassium decreased to lower levels with NAD than with AT or PLAC. These results suggest that decreased utilization of muscle triglycerides combined with lack of an enhanced glycogenolysis to compensate as well as alterations in potassium metabolism contribute to the decreased exercise capacity with nonselective beta-blockade compared with beta 1-selective blockade.", 
    "57": "Endothelin is a newly described polypeptide derived from endothelial cells. The effects of porcine endothelin on the pulmonary vascular bed and systemic vascular bed were investigated in the anesthetized, intact-chest cat under conditions of constant pulmonary blood flow and left atrial pressure. Intralobar bolus injections of porcine endothelin (100-1000 ng) produced a mild vasoconstrictor response in the pulmonary vascular bed. The pulmonary vasoconstrictor response to endothelin was not altered when pulmonary vasomotor tone was increased by infusion of U46619. In contrast to this mild pulmonary vasoconstrictor response, endothelin decreased systemic arterial pressure. Moreover, injections of porcine endothelin into the right and left atria produced similar reductions in aortic pressure as well as similar increases in cardiac output and decreases in systemic vascular resistance. The systemic vasodilator response to porcine endothelin was not affected by beta 2-adrenoceptor blockade. The present data suggest that endothelin does not undergo significant first-pass pulmonary metabolism. The pulmonary vasoconstrictor response to bolus injections of porcine endothelin is not altered by changes in pulmonary vasomotor tone. In contrast, endothelin markedly dilated the systemic vascular bed independently of activation of beta 2-adrenoceptors. The present study provides the first report of the activity of endothelin on pulmonary and systemic hemodynamics in vivo. Moreover, the potent vasodilator activity of endothelin in the systemic vascular bed and its weak effect on pulmonary vessels suggest that endothelin may be more important in the regulation of peripheral vasomotor tone than the pulmonary vascular bed.", 
    "58": "Two potential treatments, immunosuppression for myocarditis and beta-adrenergic blockade for heart failure, have been advocated. However, definitive conclusions await the result of ongoing large, multicenter, randomized clinical trials. There is circumstantial evidence that myocarditis may be a common precursor of dilated cardiomyopathy. Animal studies of myocarditis suggest that critically timed immunosuppression may be an effective therapy. Although promising, clinical studies to date are small and mostly uncontrolled. Clinical studies have demonstrated that beta-blockers are generally well tolerated in heart failure, and long-term treatment may result in improved symptomatic and functional status. These effects may be due to antagonism of direct and indirect effects of chronic reflex sympathetic stimulation on the cardiovascular system, including down-regulation of the myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor. However, prolongation of survival has not been documented by any studies. Initiation of beta-blockade requires careful patient selection and titration with small initial doses of metoprolol.", 
    "59": "The introduction, more than twenty years ago, of beta-blockers in the treatment of arterial hypertension, represented a significant advance. With these medications, many hypertensive patients are effectively under control and malignant hypertension is practically inexistent. Today, the treatment of hypertension is markedly improved with the development of new, active medications, while the beta-blockers family has markedly evolved. The role of beta-blockers in the treatment of hypertension, must therefore be re-evaluated according to their properties as compared to those of other classes of antihypertensive medications. Indeed, there are standard contraindications to he use of beta-blockers, sometimes resulting in adverse reactions, either clinical (fatigue, sexual disorders, vasomotor syndromes)--much less frequent with the new molecules--or biological (especially serum lipid levels), the consequences of which remains ill-defined--some beta-blockers appear practically without any harmful effect. Actually, despite these drawbacks, usually minimal, there are numerous and strong arguments in favor of the use of beta-blockers in the treatment of hypertension: 1) their significant follow-up in the treatment of hypertension; this is a well-known argument; 2) their effectiveness in hypertension, as a single drug and single daily dose; 3) their cost, which is lower than that of new anti-hypertensive medications; 4) their cardio-protective role, demonstrated by experimental data (myocardial protection and anti-arrhythmic effect in experimental ischemia), and clinical data (improvement of left ventricular hypertrophy, control of blood pressure increase during exertion and stress, secondary prevention after myocardial infarction).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "60": "Data from 357 conscious stroke patients taking part in an acute intervention trial and assessed within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms, were used to investigate the prevalence and natural history of swallowing problems. Nearly 30% of patients with single-hemisphere strokes were initially found to have difficulty swallowing a mouthful of water, but in most of those who survived, the deficit had resolved by the end of the first week. Strong correlations were found between dysphagia and speech impairment (comprehension and expression) and with facial weakness, but there was no association with the side of the stroke. After controlling for other markers of overall stroke severity such as conscious level, urinary continence, white blood cell count and strength in the affected limbs, swallowing impairment still showed a significant inverse correlation with functional ability at 1 and 6 months. These results indicate that, even if dysphagia itself is not responsible for much excess mortality in acute stroke, it might still lead to complications which hamper functional recovery.", 
    "61": "Beta adrenergic blockers have been one of the most prescribed category of drugs during the past 15 years. Recently, many new beta blockers have been introduced because they have unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties that benefit patients. The purpose of this article is to review the pharmacological properties and clinical uses of beta blockers. The latter part of this review will discuss the anesthesia implications of this group of drugs.", 
    "62": "1. It has been suggested that impaired beta-adrenoceptor stimulation is a condition under which the functional role of cardiac alpha 1-adrenoceptors is enhanced. We therefore investigated the extent and time course of changes in alpha 1-adrenoceptor characteristics after chronic treatment with the beta-adrenoceptor blocker propranolol in rat heart. For comparison beta-adrenoceptors were also studied. The mechanism of the changes in adrenoceptor density was investigated with cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis. The functional significance of an increased alpha 1-adrenoceptor density was tested by measuring isometric force of contraction in the presence of phenylephrine or isoprenaline in right ventricular papillary muscles. 2. Rats were treated with propranolol (9.9 mg kg-1 daily) or 0.9% NaCl, applied with osmotic minipumps for 1, 2, 3 or 7 days. Propranolol treatment resulted in a maximally 28% increase of alpha 1-adrenoceptor density after 3 days (NaCl 95.9 +/- 3.5 vs. propranolol 123.0 +/- 1.6 fmol mg-1 protein, n = 6, P less than 0.01). This up regulation reached significant levels after 2 days of treatment and was reversible after cessation of treatment within two days. KD-values were the same for NaCl- and propranolol-treated rats. Changes of Bmax and KD in beta-adrenoceptor binding assays did not reach significant levels. 3. Cycloheximide (1.5 mg kg-1 i.p. daily for 3 days) inhibited the propranolol-induced increase in Bmax of alpha 1-adrenoceptors completely. In addition, cycloheximide also decreased the density of alpha 1- and beta-adrenoceptors also under control conditions. 4. pD2-values for the positive inotropic effect of phenylephrine and isoprenaline in isolated electrically driven papillary muscle were similar in NaCl- and propranolol-treated rats (phenylephrine: 5.41 + 0.11 vs. 5.41 + 0.19, n = 7; isoprenaline: 6.31 + 0.18 vs. 6.65 + 0.19, n = 7). The observed increase in alpha-adrenoceptor density in healthy rat heart may therefore not be high enough to enhance the phenylephrine-induced increase in force of contraction. 5. In conclusion, time course and effects of cycloheximide indicate that the increase in B,,,, of myocardial alpha 1-adrenoceptors is due to de novo synthesis of receptors. However, at least for the rat heart model, a functional significance of this increase could not be demonstrated.", 
    "63": "Twenty-five hypertensives with no history of myocardial infarction and with a radiologically determined heart enlargement were examined with M-mode echocardiography and compared with a normotensive control group (n = 41). All except two of the hypertensive patients were on a beta-blocker based antihypertensive treatment regime. The relative heart volume on X-ray was significantly larger in the hypertensives, 562 ml m-2 body surface area (BSA), compared to the normotensives, 408 ml m-2 BSA (P less than 0.001). Both left ventricular diameter (LVD) in end-diastole and end-systole and left arterial (LA) diameter were significantly larger in the hypertensives (56 vs. 51 mm, P less than 0.01; 35 vs. 31 mm, P less than 0.01; 46 vs. 42 mm, P less than 0.01, respectively) as was the LV mass (296 vs. 203 g, P less than 0.001). The end-systolic wall stress (ESWS) was significantly greater in the hypertensives. Despite these findings resting left ventricular fractional shortening was the same and showed a similar correlation with ESWS (r = 0.79 and r = 0.77, respectively) in both groups. Hence, left ventricular systolic performance was not impaired in the hypertensives compared to the normotensives. These results show that an enlarged cardiac silhouette on the chest X-ray in hypertensive subjects with beta-blocker based drug therapy must be interpreted with caution and must not, a priori, be judged as a sign of an impaired systolic cardiac function.", 
    "64": "The rationale for the use of new drugs in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension is based on the knowledge that these drugs can both achieve the same goals as old drugs and offer additional advantages. Available data indicate that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are as effective in reducing blood pressure as thiazide diuretics and beta-blockers, and that they maintain their effect without the development of tolerance. Therefore they may be expected to achieve at least the same prevention of target organ damage (heart failure, cerebral strokes, and arterial nephrosclerosis) as achieved by previous drugs and also to be effective when target organs have already been damaged. Moreover ACEIs seem to offer two possible advantages: cardioprotection and a favorable influence on the quality of life. Many experimental but indeed few clinical data suggest that these drugs can exert primary cardioprotection and that they might exert a beneficial therapeutic effect in hypertensives with coronary heart disease. Owing to the quality of their hypotensive effect, to the lack of detrimental effects on physical, psychical, and sexual activity, and to the positive influence on the sense of well-being, ACEIs seem to be better tolerated than previous drugs. However, although available data suggest that ACEIs can be considered a further advance in the treatment of hypertension, more extensive information is needed to confirm these promising results.", 
    "65": "While there is general agreement on the natural history, pathology, and pathophysiology of hypertension, there continues to be controversy over the selection of specific antihypertensive agents. All antihypertensive agents will, by definition, lower blood pressure, and factors beyond side effects and other difficulties associated with therapy form the basis of selecting specific agents. One of these factors is the effect of a given drug on core organ function. Propranolol was the first beta-adrenoceptor-blocking agent introduced for the treatment of hypertension. Initiation of therapy with propranolol may result in a decline in blood pressure more at the expense of cardiac function due to a concomitant rise in total peripheral resistance. Furthermore, propranolol may result in a decline in both glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal blood flow (RBF). In contrast, cardioselective beta-blockers or those with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity may not adversely affect renal function. It had been predicted that nadolol, a noncardioselective beta-blocker without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, should result in decreased renal function. In contrast, observations demonstrated a preservation or improvement in both RBF and GFR, suggesting the presence of an alternative effective mechanism. Recent additions to the beta-adrenolytic group of antihypertensive agents include drugs with concurrent beta-blockade and vasodilation. This vasodilatation may be achieved through agonist properties resulting in lesser increases in vasomotor tone and smaller, if any, decreases in cardiac output. Alternatively, vasodilation may be achieved by concomitant alpha-adrenoceptor blockade, such as with labetalol. This agent preserves GFR and RBF during therapy of hypertension, in patients with normal as well as diminished renal function and hypertension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "66": "Tertatolol is a new beta-adrenergic blocking agent that possesses unique actions on kidney function. In the present study, the effect of increasing doses of tertatolol (0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 mg) was examined in different groups of anesthetized rats and the results compared with injection of the vehicle. Bolus i.v. injections of tertatolol resulted in a dose-related elevation of urine volume (UV), from 4.1 +/- 0.3 to 6.0 +/- 0.4, 10.2 +/- 1.3, 13.8 +/- 1.2, 18.8 +/- 1.9 and 16.4 +/- 1.8 microliters/min, respectively. Similarly, urine Na increased from 0.4 +/- 0.1 to 0.8 +/- 0.2, 1.2 +/- 0.2, 2.2 +/- 0.3, 3.4 +/- 0.7 and 2.9 +/- 0.6 mueq/min. These changes were associated with a progressive rise in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from a mean control value of 1.15 +/- 0.10 to 1.28 +/- 0.09, 1.41 +/- 0.07, 1.50 +/- 0.10, 1.62 +/- 0.16 and 1.48 +/- 0.07 ml/min. No change in urinary phosphate excretion was observed. In a separate group of studies, the effect of tertatolol was compared with propranolol (1 mg): the maximal elevation on UV and urine Na was less than 25% of that obtained with tertatolol. Elevation of GFR was also 30% higher in animals receiving tertatolol. The effect of tertatolol on UV and urine Na resulted in part from the rise in GFR but also from tubular inhibition of Na transport, since fractional Na excretion increased from 0.24 +/- 0.09 to a maximal value of 1.76 +/- 0.10%. This tubular action presumably occurs beyond the proximal nephron, because no effect on urinary phosphate excretion was obtained during tertatolol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "67": "A brief review of the common systemic side effects of the various medications used to treat glaucoma on an outpatient basis has been presented. This review is not complete, and the variety of side effects that may be caused by these drugs is extensive. Because it is usual for glaucoma patients to use several different drugs concurrently, the range of possible side effects in a given individual is large and serious. Not only should the ophthalmologist be familiar with the side effects of these medications, but all physicians involved in the patient's care should be aware of the glaucoma medications being used and consider these medications when the patient has symptoms or complications. Because the patient rarely associates the use of an eyedrop with problems in his or her general health, it is especially incumbent upon the physician to suspect and recognize these problems. Physicians should also elicit problems that the patient may not even complain of so alterations in therapy may be made.", 
    "68": "We examined the effects of five beta-adrenergic blockers on the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine-stabilized triolein particles by purified human postheparin lipoprotein lipase (PHLpL) in order to evaluate the possible role of direct inhibition as a mechanism of drug-induced hypertriglyceridemia. The relative inhibitory potencies were observed in the following order: propranolol much greater than pindolol greater than metoprolol greater than atenolol greater than nadolol. There was a positive correlation between the octanol/water partition coefficients of these agents and their inhibition of lipoprotein lipase, suggesting that hydrophobicity may be one of the major determinants for PHLpL inhibition. The amount of the beta-adrenergic blockers required to produce 50% inhibition of human PHLpL was much greater than that required to inhibit purified bovine lipoprotein lipase.", 
    "69": "We have presented a case in which nifedipine-induced hypotension in a patient receiving beta blocker and nitrate therapy precipitated mesenteric angina, leading to emergency exploratory celiotomy. Although paradoxic angina is an unusual complication of this antianginal therapy, it should be considered in any patient who has acute abdominal pain and hypotension while receiving this therapeutic regimen.", 
    "70": "Human alveolar macrophages obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage were studied with the high specific activity beta-adrenergic ligand [125I]pindolol and found to possess a moderate density of beta-adrenergic receptors. Using macrophage membranes, the receptor density (Bmax) was 42 +/- 9 fmol/mg protein with an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 44 +/- 9 pM (mean +/- SEM). With intact macrophages, the Bmax = 5,643 +/- 942 sites/cell with Kd = 29 +/- 9 pM. Competition binding studies with subtype-specific antagonists revealed an exclusive population of beta 2-adrenergic receptors. Incubation of intact macrophages with the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol caused a 6-fold increase in intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP). Prostaglandin E1 and forskolin, which activate adenylate cyclase via different mechanisms, afforded typical marked increases in macrophage cAMP. Saturation binding, competition binding, and cAMP accumulation studies may all be performed from a single sample of about 2 x 10(7) cells, which can be obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage. This should facilitate studies of in vivo regulation of human alveolar macrophage beta-adrenergic receptors with regard to immune function and mediator release, and as a possible reflection of lung parenchymal receptors.", 
    "71": "We evaluated the clinical effectiveness of esmolol, an ultra-short-acting, cardioselective beta-adrenergic receptor blocker, in controlling sinus tachycardia and increased systolic blood pressure occurring perioperatively in 30 ASA physical status II or III patients having elective, non-cardiac surgery. Esmolol 80 mg I.V. bolus (N = 15) or placebo (N = 15) followed by 12 mg/min or placebo were infused in 30 isoflurane-anesthetized patients using a randomized double-blind study design. The bolus plus infusions were given when surgical stimuli caused heart rate to exceed 95 bpm or systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg. Esmolol significantly decreased heart rate (107 +/- 4, mean +/- SEM to 99 +/- 4, mean +/- SEM bpm) within 45 sec after starting the bolus plus infusion; the placebo had no effect, heart rate being 105 +/- 4 before and 106 +/- 3 bpm after the bolus plus infusion. Patients given esmolol continued to have heart rates significantly lower than patients given placebo injections throughout a six min infusion (Ex., at 5 min 81 +/- 3 vs 91 +/- 4 bpm). The study demonstrated no apparent effect of esmolol on blood pressure but that esmolol is effective in treating perioperative sinus tachycardia.", 
    "72": "A new class of indanones 4 easily obtained by aryne type condensations, followed by transposition of the benzocyclobutanols 3 thus formed, were transformed into the corresponding oximinopropanolamines 7. These compounds were studied for their potential beta-blocking properties. It was found that 7 have generally low beta 1-blocking properties. Their beta 2-blocking action varies from low to very high. Interestingly one of them (7b) has the highest beta 2 activity/beta 1 activity (343) value known to date.", 
    "73": "We ligated the left anterior descending coronary artery for 1 or 2 h in 31 purebred beagles. We did not detect any changes in beta-adrenergic receptor density or affinity when normal and ischemic zones were compared, either in the subendocardium or in the subepicardium. In the ischemic zones, there was a significant decline in all measures of adenylate cyclase activity, including activity mediated by the beta-adrenergic receptor. By contrast, after chronic beta-adrenergic blockade (1.5 mg/kg propranolol i.v. twice daily for 7 d), there was an increase in adenylate cyclase activity stimulated by (-)-isoproterenol relative to adenylate cyclase activity stimulated by guanyl-5'imidodiphosphate (GppNHp) in both normal and ischemic tissue, suggesting that one effect of chronic beta blockade may be to enhance coupling between the stimulatory guanine nucleotide regulatory protein (Gs) and the beta-adrenergic receptor, despite a reduction in the number or function of Gs units. Chronic beta blockade also led to up regulation of beta-adrenergic receptor density in subepicardial regions. After 20 min of reperfusion following 2 h of ischemia, adenylate cyclase activity tended to return to control levels, particularly in the subepicardium, where (-)-isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was not different from normal myocardium. We conclude that chronic beta-adrenergic blockade may have beneficial effects during prolonged episodes of myocardial ischemia by preserving signal transduction mediated by the beta-adrenergic receptor.", 
    "74": "It has been previously reported that enprofylline (3-propyl xanthine) prevents histamine-mediated edema formation in the guinea pig lung. To further assess the potential anti-inflammatory effects of enprofylline, we infused it intra-arterially into the canine forelimb before and during a local intra-arterial infusion of histamine (4 micrograms/min) while monitoring forelimb skin lymph parameters. Infusion of enprofylline at 2 mg/min significantly decreased forelimb arterial pressures and increased heart rate and pulse pressure. Subsequent infusion of histamine caused a further reduction in forelimb arterial pressures and an increase in lymph flow, protein concentration, and protein transport similar to that seen with the infusion of histamine alone. Infusion of enprofylline at 5 mg/min decreased forelimb arterial pressures and systemic pressure. Subsequent histamine infusion further reduced forelimb arterial pressures, but the increase in lymph parameters was markedly attenuated. Enprofylline infused at 10 mg/min also decreased forelimb arterial and systemic pressures, but subsequent histamine infusion was essentially without effect on lymph parameters. To assess the role of catecholamines in enprofylline-mediated attenuation of histamine edema formation, we infused enprofylline at 5 mg/min in the presence of a beta 2-receptor blockade produced by the intra-arterial infusion of ICI 118551. The effects of enprofylline and histamine on vascular pressures were similar to those seen in the absence of beta 2-receptor blockade, but lymph flow, protein concentration, and protein transport increased similar to that seen with histamine alone. These data indicate that enprofylline is capable of attenuating histamine-induced increases in microvascular permeability, but this action of enprofylline is of an indirect nature, mediated through the release of catecholamines.", 
    "75": "The importance of receptor-mediated Ca++ entry (RMCa++E) relative to Ca++ release and potential-dependent Ca++ entry (PDCa++E) in agonist-induced responses in rabbit aorta and renal artery was quantitatively delineated by utilizing a solution without added Ca++ containing low ethyleneglycol bis(beta-aminoethylether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) plus D600 to inhibit PDCa++E. Adding an approximate ED80 concentration of norepinephrine (NE; 3 x 10(-7) M), histamine (Hist; 3 x 10(-6) M), or serotonin (5HT; 3 x 10(-6) M) to this solution results in a transient increase in developed force that is attributed to release of a limited cellular pool of Ca++. (NE greater than Hist much greater than 5HT). When the concentrations are approximately equipotent (NE, 3 x 10(-7) M; Hist, 3 x 10(-5) M; 5HT, 10(-5) M) the Ca++ release component increases for Hist and 5HT such that NE = Hist greater than 5HT. Subsequent addition of Ca++ results in an increase in developed force that is sustained and represents RMCa++E. In aorta, RMCa++E can account for 91% of the total NE-induced developed force; for an equipotent concentration of Hist, 71%; and for an equipotent concentration of 5HT, only 37%. This capacity for stimulating RMCa++E is inversely related to the sensitivity of these agonists to the PDCa++E blocker, D600 (5HT much greater than Hist greater than NE). Chronic Mg++ potentiates control responses to NE in normal Ca++, but depresses the sensitivity to Ca++ in the RMCa++E concentration response relationship. The sustained response associated with RMCa++E is only minimally relaxed or inhibited by Mg++ (acute) and is completely inhibited or slowly and completely relaxed by La . In renal artery, a similar approximate ED80 concentration of NE (3 x 10(-6) M) results in a NE-induced transient response attributed to Ca++ release that is 60% less than that seen in aorta, whereas the RMCa++E component in renal artery accounts for 78% of the total response (only 10% less than in aorta). Thus, it appears that there are pharmacologically distinct Ca++ channels in some blood vessels that are differentially activated in a selective and potential-independent manner as a result of specific agonist-receptor interactions.", 
    "76": "Most of our knowledge about the modulation of platelet function by catecholamines is based on observations of acute in vitro actions. Little is known about the effects of chronically elevated or reduced adrenergic stimulation of the platelets. We therefore treated rats for 8 weeks with either adrenaline or the beta-blocker propranolol. Adrenaline (0.5 mg.kg-1.d-1) continuously administered from subcutaneously implanted osmotic mini pumps caused an increase in the sensitivity of the platelets towards ADP as stimulating agent. In contrast, chronic application of propranolol (10 mg.kg-1.d-1) via the drinking water led to a reduction in platelet aggregability. For animals treated with adrenaline, in accordance with the results of the aggregation experiments, the levels of c-AMP found in platelet rich plasma were reduced, both basally (by 33%) and after stimulation of platelet adenylate cyclase with prostaglandin E1 (by 39%). For the propranolol treated animals, the basal c-AMP concentrations remained unchanged. The levels of c-AMP attained after stimulation with prostaglandin E1 were diminished to a similar extent as for the adrenaline treated animals (by 38%). Although the in vitro addition of adrenaline to platelet rich plasma causes a beta-adrenoceptor mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation in the rat, the simulation seen after chronic adrenaline exposure in vivo, which is associated with decreases in both basal and stimulated c-AMP levels, suggests a functional preponderance of alpha-adrenoceptors over beta-adrenoceptors on the rat platelets. Although intraplatelet metabolic changes (blockade of stimulated c-AMP formation) after chronic application of propranolol should have resulted in enhancement of platelet aggregability, an inhibition of aggregation was observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "77": "Plasma concentrations of metoprolol after acute and repetitive administration of R/S-metoprolol to healthy volunteers were measured by a beta-adrenoceptor subtype-specific radioreceptor assay (RRA) and by an enantiospecific high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method. In the RRA, R/S-metoprolol showed a 20-fold beta 1-subtype selectivity: the S-(-)-enantiomer was 35-fold more potent than the R-(+)-enantiomer. A comparison between S-(-)-metoprolol concentrations detected in the plasma samples by HPLC and those detected by RRA yielded a 1/1 relationship, indicating that active metabolites are not present to a significant extent. These results were independent of the widely scattering metabolic clearance of metoprolol (with the potential of differences in the rate and extent of formation of active metabolites) in the volunteers. In general, HPLC methods can be validated by comparison with RRA in order to clarify whether active metabolites are present and--on the basis of the Ki value from RRA--whether the detection limit of the physicochemical procedure is sufficient to cover the therapeutically relevant range.", 
    "78": "An (125I) iodohydroxybenzyl pindolol (125IHYP) binding inhibition assay was performed. Various dilutions (1:5-1:500) of sera from asthmatics and controls were incubated with canine lung membranes for 60 minutes at 30 degrees C. 125IHYP was added to the membranes for 30 minutes at room temperature in the presence and absence of 10 microM 1-propranolol, and the samples were washed through a Gelman (Type A-E) glass fiber filter using a washing buffer. Radio activity was measured with Aloka gamma counter. In the presence of various serum dilutions from asthmatics, 125IHYP specific bindings of 0.16 fmol to 4.38 fmol were measured. 125IHYP binding was inhibited in a dose-related and nonspecific manner. Serum, albumin, L-histidine and L-cysteine also inhibited 125IHYP specific binding to beta-receptors. Percentages of inhibition of serum from asthmatics on 125IHYP specific finding to beta-receptors were -17.6% to +9.3%, which were compared with identical dilutions of control serum. There was no significant difference in 125IHYP binding inhibition assay between asthmatics and controls. From these results, development of autoantibody to beta-adrenergic receptors could not be detected in this study.", 
    "79": "High-altitude pulmonary arterial hypertension affects people with a long-term residence at altitudes over 2500 m above the sea level and is characterized by elevated pulmonary artery pressure (over 35/15 mmHg). In order to assess the role of beta-adrenoreceptors in the development of high-altitude pulmonary arterial hypertension, we studied the beta-adrenoreceptor density on mononuclear leukocytes in Kirghiz male natives of Eastern Pamir (3600-4200 m above sea level) with the diagnosis of high-altitude pulmonary arterial hypertension, and in healthy men. It was shown that patients with signs of right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) of the second and third grade have beta-adrenoreceptor density 4.5 times lower than control (2.27 +/- 0.22 vs. 9.85 +/- 1.28 fmol/10(6) cells). Values of Kd also proved to be lower, by 2.5 times (0.57 +/- 0.14 vs. 1.44 +/- 0.18 nM). Stimulation of adenylate cyclase by isoproterenol and other beta-agonists was lower in patients than in controls (+33% and +120%, respectively). These results demonstrate that the desensitization of beta-adrenoreceptors is present in patients with high-altitude pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with severe right ventricular hypertrophy. Patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension due to mitral stenosis do not have any signs of beta-adrenoreceptor desensitization associated with high plasma levels of catecholamines.",

The affinity of the erythrocytes' beta-adrenoreceptors to propranolol was enhanced and the parameters of their binding the fluorescent probe were changed. The data obtained suggest the possibility of using the erythrocytes for in vivo estimation of functional state of adrenoreactive system in animals and humans.", 
    "82": "Patients with borderline hypertension typically show enhanced sympathetic and decreased parasympathetic tone, characteristic personality traits (submissiveness, hostility) and hyperreactivity to mental stress. It has been proposed that the hypertensive personality results in a persistent 'defence reaction', enhancing sympathetic outflow from the central nervous system and reactivity to stress. But evidence from pharmacological intervention trials suggests that blood pressure reactivity is controlled independently of average baseline blood pressure. A study comparing the effects of the centrally-acting alpha 2-agonist, clonidine, and the selective beta 1-blocker, atenolol, demonstrated that both drugs had a comparable antihypertensive action on baseline blood pressure. However, neither agent affected stress responses to mental arithmetic, submaximal isometric handgrip exercise or cold pressor testing. We conclude that studies of stress reactivity, while of interest to students of circulatory control, are unlikely to yield insights into the causes of human hypertension.",

The paper offers speculations about the ways in which the biological and psychological aspects of affective disorder may be interrelated and the mechanisms of this interrelationship.", 
    "84": "In isolated buccal segment of the rabbit facial vein, electrical responses produced by perivascular nerve stimulation and exogenously applied noradrenaline (NA) were recorded from the smooth muscle cells using microelectrode. Perivascular nerve stimulation hyperpolarized the smooth muscle cell membrane. The hyperpolarization was converted to depolarization after application of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol, and the depolarization was blocked by alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists, yohimbine. These responses elicited by nerve stimulation were blocked by tetrodotoxin or guanethidine, but not by atropine. Exogenously applied NA mimicked the responses elicited by nerve stimulation. The amplitude of the beta-adrenoceptor-mediated hyperpolarization was increased in low potassium solution, decreased in high potassium solution, but unaltered by low sodium or low chloride solution, i.e., the hyperpolarization may be generated by an increase in potassium conductance of the membrane. An involvement of the apamin-sensitive (Ca-dependent) potassium channel or sodium-potassium ATPase in the hyperpolarization was ruled out."
