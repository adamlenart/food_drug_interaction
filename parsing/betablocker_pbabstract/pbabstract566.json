[3H]l-Propranolol uptake increased with increasing [3H]l-propranolol concentration from 10(-7) M to 10(-3) M and was not saturable in this concentration range. [3H]l-Propranolol uptake was equally inhibited by l- and d-propranolol, indicating that the uptake is not stereoselective. [3H]l-Propranolol uptake differed from [3H]norepinephrine uptake in two respects: [3H]l-propranolol uptake was 44-50 times greater than [3H]norepinephrine uptake at early non-equilibrium time periods, and [3H]l-propranolol uptake was not Na+ dependent and was not inhibited by desipramine, indicating that [3H]l-propranolol is not taken up by the biogenic amine transport system. In cells preloaded with [3H]l-propranolol, two agents, veratridine and tyramine, stimulated an increased release of [3H]l-propranolol into the medium. However, veratridine-induced [3H]l-propranolol release was inhibited only slightly by the Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin, and tyramine-induced [3H]l-propranolol release was not inhibited by desipramine. In addition, K+, carbachol and the physiological mediator of adrenal catecholamine release, acetylcholine, failed to evoke [3H]l-propranolol release. Therefore, it is unlikely that propranolol is released in response to physiological stimulation of adrenal chromaffin cells in animals administered propranolol in vivo. l-Propranolol inhibited [3H]norepinephrine uptake by chromaffin cells with an IC50 for l-propranolol of 5 X 10(-6) M; d-propranolol was equally potent for this effect at lower propranolol concentrations. By themselves, neither l- nor d-propranolol had any effect on [3H]norepinephrine release from the cells. However, l-propranolol inhibited carbachol-induced [3H]norepinephrine release with an IC50 for l-propranolol of 5 X 10(-7) M to 10(-6) M. At these lower concentrations, d-propranolol had no effect on carbachol-induced [3H]norepinephrine release, indicating that the inhibition by l-propranolol may be mediated via beta-adrenoceptors on chromaffin cells.", 
    "1": "Liver mitochondria isolated from rats immediately after exercise oxidize substrates more rapidly than do mitochondria from resting animals. In both fed and fasted rats, a 1-h period of exercise resulted in increased concentrations of malate in their livers and in the mitochondria isolated therefrom. This increase occurred in both untrained and exercise-trained rats. Because mitochondrial malate is known to facilitate mitochondrial uptake of other carboxylic substrates, it seems likely that the increased mitochondrial malate is responsible for the increased rate of oxidation. Rats injected with small amounts of malate (4.6 mumol/100 g body wt) yielded liver mitochondria with increased malate concentration and increased rates of oxidation of citrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, and succinate. The beta adrenergic antagonist propranolol (0.25 mg/100 g body wt) and the alpha 1 antagonist prazosin (same dose) did not abolish the effect of exercise on mitochondrial malate concentration or substrate oxidation.", 
    "2": "To evaluate the effects of propranolol on myocardial metabolism after coronary reperfusion, serial measurements of myocardial creatine kinase (CK) and calcium (Ca) contents and CK and lactic acid (LA) concentrations in coronary sinus blood were carried out in 33 open-chest dogs. The left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded for 60 minutes and was then reopened. Twelve of the dogs were given propranolol before occlusion. Reperfusion for 30 minutes in dogs with and without propranolol pretreatment resulted in reduced myocardial CK in the ischemic region and rapidly elevated plasma CK and LA. However, when compared with the control group, the propranolol-treated group showed smaller changes in myocardial CK and plasma LA. Myocardial Ca in the ischemic region was significantly higher than that in the nonischemic region in the control group, but not in the propranolol-treated group. It was concluded that propranolol was protective against myocardial damage resulting from coronary occlusion followed by reperfusion.", 
    "3": "Diltiazem and propranolol are independently useful antianginal agents with common negative chronotropic, dromotropic, and inotropic properties. Concern over the safety of the concurrent use of these two drugs led to an investigation of their intravenous combination in 19 patients with suspected coronary artery disease. Hemodynamics were recorded in both a sinus and atrial paced rhythms at baseline and again following administration of a loading dose of diltiazem (0.25 mg/kg) followed by continuous infusion (0.002 mg/kg/min). Propranolol was then added by intravenous bolus (0.07 mg/kg) and continuous infusion (0.0012 mg/kg/min), with reassessment of hemodynamics once steady state was achieved. Patients were stratified by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF): group 1 (LVEF = 62% to 69%), group 2 (LVEF = 49% to 59%), and group 3 (LVEF = 20% to 47%). The combination of drugs resulted in a 15% drop in heart rate (p less than 0.01) and a 15% prolongation in the PR interval (p less than 0.01) for the group of 19 patients. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was not significantly changed by diltiazem or its combination except in group 3. Cardiac output was lowered in all groups following diltiazem and propranolol (p less than 0.05). Untoward reactions included marked vasovagal reactions at the conclusion of the procedure in six patients. The combination of drugs resulted in profound sinus bradycardia with attendant 2:1 atrioventricular (AV) block in one patient. Diltiazem and propranolol were hemodynamically well tolerated in patients with preserved left ventricular function. Because of the additive negative dromotropic activities of these two drugs, ECG monitoring is warranted when they are acutely combined.", 
    "4": "Dyskinesia is usually lifelong and progressive; therefore, physicians generally see the disorder in elderly patients. Medical treatment must be carefully selected on the basis of the cause of the dyskinesia. Parkinsonian dyskinesia is well controlled by drug therapy. However, patients can become less responsive to a drug after years of use and may experience unwelcome side effects. Cerebellar tremor is extremely disabling because it worsens with activity, but no satisfactory therapy is available. Senile, essential, and familial tremors are also intensified by action, but they can often be suppressed with a mild tranquilizer or a beta blocker. Drug treatment of blepharospasm and spastic dysphonia has been disappointing: Facial or laryngeal surgery is sometimes required. Tardive dyskinesia is caused by neuroleptic drugs, so the only therapy for the disorder is withdrawal of the offending drug.", 
    "5": "The mutagenic effect of an antihypertensive drug, propranolol, was studied on somatic and germ cells of Swiss albino mice. The induction of a significant increase in the frequency of micronuclei in erythrocytes was observed at higher dose levels, whereas, in germ cells, propranolol failed to induce significant chromosomal aberrations at any dose tested.", 
    "6": "A 15 year old youth, who presented with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to documented ventricular fibrillation, was found to have nonobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Electrophysiologic study demonstrated inducible sustained atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. This rhythm, associated with hypotension and evidence of myocardial ischemia, spontaneously degenerated into ventricular fibrillation. No ventricular arrhythmias were inducible by programmed ventricular stimulation. Therapy with metoprolol and verapamil slowed the ventricular rate during atrial fibrillation and maintained hemodynamic stability, both during follow-up electrophysiologic study and during a subsequent spontaneous episode.", 
    "7": "The incidence of congestive heart failure was studied in the Beta Blocker Heart Attack Trial in which postmyocardial infarction patients between the ages of 30 and 69 years, with no contraindication to propranolol, were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n = 1921) or propranolol 180 or 240 mg daily (n = 1916) 5 to 21 days after admission to the hospital for the event. Survivors of acute myocardial infarction with compensated or mild congestive heart failure, including those on digitalis and diuretics, were included in the study. A history of congestive heart failure before randomization characterized 710 (18.5%) patients: 345 (18.0%) in the propranolol group and 365 (19.0%) in the placebo group. The incidence of definite congestive heart failure after randomization and during the study was 6.7% in both groups. In patients with a history of congestive heart failure before randomization, 51 of 345 (14.8%) in the propranolol group and 46 of 365 (12.6%) in the placebo group developed congestive heart failure during an average 25 month follow-up. In the patients with no history of congestive heart failure, 5% in the propranolol group developed congestive heart failure and 5.3% in the placebo group developed congestive heart failure. Baseline characteristics predictive of the occurrence of congestive heart failure by multivariate analyses included an increased cardiothoracic ratio, diabetes, increased heart rate, low baseline weight, prior myocardial infarction, age, and more than 10 ventricular premature beats per hour.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "8": "The case of a young man in hypertensive emergency following the ingestion of 840 mg of pseudoephedrine is reported. The hypertension, which peaked at 200/160 mm Hg and was associated with severe headache and diaphoresis, responded expeditiously to two initial intravenous doses of labetalol. No rebound was observed following the administration of an additional dose in the intensive care unit, after which an uneventful one-day hospitalization ensued. The toxicity of pseudoephedrine is briefly reviewed along with the pharmacology and use of labetalol. On the basis of previous experimental studies and the present report, labetalol is suggested as a promising agent in the treatment of hyperadrenergic-induced hypertensive emergencies.", 
    "9": "Normal right ventricular muscles and similar preparations obtained from cats with signs of subacute right ventricular failure (RVF) (3 to 14 days after pressure overload induced by pulmonary artery coarctation) were studied during stimulation (at 0.5 Hz) and exposure to high-K+ Tyrode's solution. Twitch force, rate of force development (dP/dt), and rate of relaxation (-dP/dt) were significantly lower in RVF muscles compared with control muscles; duration of the twitch was significantly longer. Time to peak force was unchanged. Amrinone (5.3 x 10(-4)M) increased twitch force and dP/dt in normal muscle; however, the drug had no significant effects on twitch force and dP/dt in RVF muscles. Also unlike its action in control muscle, duration of the twitch was reduced by amrinone in failed muscle. Amrinone reduced K+ contracture force similarly in control and RVF muscle. In control and RVF muscles, isoproterenol (1.0 x 10(-6)M) significantly increased twitch force and dP/dt and reduced K+ contracture, while ouabain increased twitch force, dP/dt, and K+ contracture. The differential effects of amrinone on RVF and control muscles may reflect cellular defects associated with experimental ventricular failure.", 
    "10": "Patients with angina pectoris, exercise induced myocardial ischemia, normal coronary arteries and no evidence of epicardial spasm, i.e. patients with syndrome x, have been suggested to haven inadequate increase in coronary blood flow during tachycardia, possibly due to a functional disorder of small coronary vessels. To evaluate the best medical management of this syndrome we studied 13 patients who showed the above set of findings. Patients were given propranolol (160 mg daily), diltiazem (360 mg daily) and placebo for 2 weeks, using a randomized single blind protocol. Upright bicycle ergometer testing was performed at the end of each period of treatment. Compared to placebo, diltiazem significantly (p less than 0.001) prolonged exercise duration (x +/- SD: 365 +/- 86 vs 303 +/- 89 sec) and time to onset of angina (358 +/- 88 vs 276 +/- 90 sec). Angina appeared in 7 patients with diltiazem vs 13 patients with placebo and occurred at a higher rate pressure product (26.3 +/- 3.5 vs 24.1 +/- 2.8 X 10(-3); p less than 0.02). Conversely, following propranolol exercise duration and time to onset of angina were unchanged and angina appeared in all patients at a lower rate pressure product (18.3 +/- 2.9 vs 24.4 +/- 3.6 X 10(-3); p less than 0.001). The most likely explanations for these findings are: propranolol counteracts beta 2-adrenergic receptors, thus further reducing coronary reserve. This may lower the anginal threshold; Diltiazem reduces smooth muscle tone in small coronary vessels. This may result in increased coronary reserve and exercise duration.", 
    "11": "In an isolated right atrial preparation, which was cross-perfused with heparinized arterial blood from a support dog, we investigated the effects of glucagon on heart rate and systemic arterial blood pressure of the support dog and on atrial rate and contractile force of the isolated perfused atrium when glucagon was injected into the external jugular vein of the support dog or into the sinus node artery of the isolated atrial preparation. Glucagon (0.3 to 3 micrograms/Kg i.v.) to the support dog dose-dependently induced a prominent increase in heart rate and a small increase in systemic arterial blood pressure. In the isolated, perfused atrium, marked positive chronotropic and slight, but significant, positive inotropic effects were evoked dose-dependently 1.5 min after intravenous injection of glucagon. These positive effects were not altered significantly by propranolol (1 mg/Kg i.v.). Direct injection of glucagon into the sinus node artery of isolated atria also induced marked positive chronotropic and small positive inotropic effects dose-dependently. CF/HR ratios, inotropic effect per chronotropic effect in isolated atria, of glucagon injected intravenously or intraarterially were less than 0.7 and they were much less than those of norepinephrine (more than 3.6). These results confirm that glucagon injected intravenously or regionally produces a prominent positive chronotropic effect and a small positive inotropic effect and suggest that glucagon may be less effective as a cardiotonic agent.", 
    "12": "This study documents our experience with labetalol administered by continuous intravenous infusion for severe hypertension. Infusions were performed in 14 hospitalized patients (15 infusions) with supine diastolic pressure greater than 125 mmHg or supine systolic pressure greater than 200 mmHg. Blood pressures were measured by intra-arterial recording or an Arteriosonde 1225 Doppler instrument standardized with a mercury sphygmomanometer. Patients initially received 2 mg/min continuous infusion; the infusion rate varied between 0.5 and 2.0 mg/min according to the protocol. The infusion was terminated when diastolic pressure decreased 30 mmHg or when 300 mg of the drug had been infused. Goal blood pressure was achieved in all but two infusions. Sedation was the most common adverse reaction, followed by nausea and diaphoresis. No patient required discontinuation or reduction in infusion rate secondary to side effects. We conclude that continuous intravenous infusion of labetalol offers an effective alternative to current parenteral therapy.", 
    "13": "The effects of single oral and intravenous doses of propranolol on blood pressure and hemodynamics were measured in normal volunteers. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased 10% within 3 hours after the oral dose and by 3%-5% after the intravenous dose. Cardiac output decreased 16% after the intravenous dose and 10% after the oral dose. Total peripheral resistance transiently increased by 23% after the intravenous, but not after the oral dose. Change in mean arterial pressure was positively correlated with change in total peripheral resistance after both the oral and intravenous doses. In contrast, change in mean arterial pressure was negatively correlated with change in cardiac output after the intravenous dose. Single oral and intravenous doses of propranolol lowered blood pressure within 3 hours after administration, and the reduction was correlated with change in total peripheral resistance and not with change in cardiac output. At least part of the adaptation in peripheral resistance occurs within the first 3 hours after both oral and intravenous single doses of propranolol.", 
    "14": "The antiarrhythmic potentiation that occurs with the coadministration of quinidine-propranolol has been attributed to propranolol-induced cardiac beta adrenergic receptor blockade. That this may not be the sole mechanism, however, is suggested by the finding that sotalol, pronethalol and practolol fail to potentiate quinidine in some antiarrhythmic tests. Thus, in the present experiments, the influence of bilateral stellectomy + vagotomy on quinidine-propranolol antiarrhythmic activity was studied in the anesthetized dog. Antiarrhythmic activity was determined as elevation of the electrical ventricular fibrillation threshold (VFT) when the left ventricle was stimulated directly with 60 Hz, 6 msec and varying mA for 2 sec. The increase in VFT produced by quinidine-propranolol (5 + 0.2 mg/kg, i.v.) was significantly reduced when the heart was subsequently denervated by bilateral stellectomy + vagotomy. The cardiac denervation did not significantly reduce the elevation of VFT that had been produced by prior administration of propranolol 0.4 mg/kg or sotalol. In other groups with prior bilateral stellectomy + vagotomy, the separate administration of propranolol 0.4 mg/kg or quinidine 5 mg/kg failed to significantly elevate the VFT although the VFT was increased by propranolol 0.8 mg/kg. The results indicate that the action of quinidine-propranolol to elevate the VFT may be dependent in part upon an intact nerve supply to the heart.", 
    "15": "In experiments on neurones of the isolated ganglia of the snail and surviving hippocampal slices from mice, studies have been made of the effect of Met- and Leu-enkephalins on neuronal sensitivity to acetylcholine and norepinephrine. It was shown that in some cases the enkephalins do not affect bioelectrical activity of the neurones, but changed their responses to acetylcholine and norepinephrine. It is concluded that during investigation of the effect of enkephalins on the nervous cells, alongside with changes in the bioelectrical activity, special attention should be paid to changes in chemoreceptive properties of the neurones.", 
    "16": "Effect of long-term oral administration of the converting enzyme inhibitor (2R, 4R)-2-(o-hydroxyphenyl)-3-(mercaptopropionyl)-4-thiazolidinecarboxylic acid (SA446) in combination with hydrochlorothiazide or propranolol on the development of hypertension was examined in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The development of hypertension in SHR was markedly suppressed by the treatment with SA446 (45 mg/kg, p.o.) for 17 weeks from 8 weeks of age, the pre-stage of hypertension. Long-term administration of hydrochlorothiazide (20 mg/kg, p.o.) also showed an obvious antihypertensive effect, but the effect was less potent than that of SA446. On the other hand, propranolol (20 mg/kg, p.o.) showed a slight or little antihypertensive effect. The combined administration of hydrochlorothiazide and SA446 produced a more potent antihypertensive effect than the administration of SA446 alone. On the other hand, the combined use of propranolol had no influence on the antihypertensive effect of SA446 by long-term administration in SHR. Plasma renin activities measured after 17 weeks treatment of the drugs indicated that the renin-angiotensin system was activated by hydrochlorothiazide. These results suggest that the antihypertensive effect of long-term administration of SA446 in SHR is enhanced by the combined administration of diuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide, which activates the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "17": "The cause of sex differences in the pressor response to l-adrenaline in adult rats (Tomori, 1986) was further examined using normal and castrated adult rats. Blood pressure was determined by the tail-cuff method. A prolonged elevation of blood pressure in male rats shown after an injection of l-adrenaline (50 micrograms/kg, s.c.) was almost completely suppressed by phentolamine (50 micrograms/kg, s.c.), and the slight l-adrenaline-induced increase in blood pressure in female rats was reversed to a decrease by phentolamine. Pretreatment with propranolol (200 micrograms/kg, s.c.) enhanced the pressor action of l-adrenaline in males and enhanced it to a greater extent in females. Castration resulted in a significant decrease in basal pressure in males and no change in females. Pressor responses to l-adrenaline in castrated male and female rats showed a minor alteration. In clonidine (20 micrograms/kg, s.c.)-treated normal rats, l-adrenaline induced an increase in blood pressure in males, but caused a decrease in females. In clonidine-treated castrated male rats, however, l-adrenaline administration induced a decrease in blood pressure. l-Adrenaline injection to yohimbine (1 mg/kg, s.c.)-treated rats induced a prolonged elevation of blood pressure in males and a transient elevation in females as shown in rats treated with l-adrenaline alone. In yohimbine-treated castrated rats, a decrease in the blood pressure was observed in males and a slight increase was observed in females after l-adrenaline administration. The present results suggest that the central pressor regulatory system is involved in the sex difference in pressor response to exogenous l-adrenaline and that androgens play a role to somehow maintain a higher pressor responsiveness to l-adrenaline in male rats.", 
    "18": "The relationship between dose and bioavailability of propranolol was determined in 12 healthy male subjects. The doses employed were 10, 40, 80 or 160 mg of propranolol HCl given three times daily for 4 days. Daily minimum plasma levels showed that there was no accumulation of the drug. In all subjects, non-linear relationships were observed between peak plasma level, or area under the plasma concentration-time curve, and dose. The between subject variation of these parameters was not dose related.", 
    "19": "Twelve male patients age 36-66, 8 on clinical doses of beta blocker, with old transmural myocardial infarction underwent rest and matched workload exercise before and 30 min after 20 mg sublingual nifedipine during cardiac catheterization. For the group, resting heart rate, aortic pressure, pulmonary wedge pressure, systemic vascular resistance, cardiac index, and left ventricular ejection fraction were normal. Exercise duration was 12.5 +/- 1.5 min. Comparing exercise before and after nifedipine, heart rate, cardiac index, and mean velocity circumferential fiber shortening increased, while mean aortic pressure, systemic vascular resistance, pulmonary wedge pressure, right atrial pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic volume and left ventricular end-systolic volume decreased with no significant change in double product, pulmonary arteriolar resistance and left ventricular ejection fraction. Therefore, for the range of left ventricular dysfunction in this study group and with 8 patients concurrently on beta blocker, nifedipine 20 mg s.l. produced significant improvement in hemodynamics at rest and exercise.", 
    "20": "The present study was designed to assess the short-term effects of beta-blocking antihypertensive treatment on leg blood flow in patients with peripheral artery disease. Seven patients with intermittent claudication were randomly allocated to treatment with atenolol 100 mg or pindolol 10 mg. Patients switched therapy after one month of treatment. Venous occlusion plethysmography on the calves was used to assess the effects on leg blood flow after one and two months of treatment. The average 10% reduction of the systolic and diastolic blood pressures was not associated with any reduction of blood flow at rest. There was on average 3.4 ml reduction of peak flow which had no influence on the painfree or total walking distance.", 
    "21": "Heavy male Sprague-Dawley rats die of ventricular fibrillation within 2 to 3 h after isoproterenol administration. Thus, the isoproteronol-treated heavy rat would be a useful model for screening drugs that may prevent sudden cardiac death. Isoproterenol (1 mg/kg s.c.) caused ventricular fibrillation in 79% of 121 vehicle-pretreated heavy rats (greater than 500 g); 82% of the fibrillating rats died, but the remaining 18% spontaneously reverted and survived. A protecting agent should increase the number of survivors by reducing the incidence of ventricular fibrillation and/or by increasing the incidence of spontaneous reversions. Pretreatment (i.p.) with quinidine (40 mg/kg), procainamide (40 mg/kg), phenytoin (40 mg/kg), clofilium (5 mg/kg), verapamil (10 mg/kg), or propranolol (10 mg/kg) reduced the incidence of isoproterenol-induced ventricular fibrillation and death; bretylium (10 mg/kg) and nicotinic acid (100 mg/kg) had no effect. A lower dose of propranolol (2.5 mg/kg) or clofilium (1.5 mg/kg) but not quinidine (10 mg/kg), procainamide (10 mg/kg), or phenytoin (10 mg/kg) also reduced the incidence of ventricular fibrillation. Only clofilium tended to increase the incidence of spontaneous reversions.", 
    "22": "A patient with chronic obstructive lung disease developed a severe mixed acidosis after treatment for glaucoma with a combination of carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and beta adrenergic blocking agent in normal doses.", 
    "23": "The clinical effect of the peripheral vasodilator prazosin (Adwersuten, GDR) was studied in 51 patients with second-stage essential hypertension. A single dose of 1 to 2.5 mg produced hypotensive effect in 48 (94.1%) patients, that lasted between 3 and 4 hours, with the lowest ABP drop occurring 1.5-2.5 hours after the administration. When prazosin was given as a course of monotherapy, its daily dose varied between 3 and 20 mg (6.7 +/- 0.6 mg). A marked hypotensive effect was obtained by the end of the first week in 91.4% of patients. A 28.6% decrease in total peripheral resistance was the principal hemodynamic effect of prazosin. No significant changes of heart rate were recorded on the group basis, while side-effects were noted in 7 (13.7%) patients (orthostatic hypotension and allergic response).", 
    "24": "Acute ischaemic heart failure was induced in 13 dogs by coronary embolisation. Severe dysfunction of the left ventricular (LV) performance was shown by a significant increase in LV end-diastolic pressure and significant decreases in maximum rate of LV pressure rise (LVdP/dtmax), stroke volume and cardiac output. 300 IU of fast-acting insulin was injected as a bolus dose in 7 dogs 90 min after the embolisation procedure. This was followed by infusion of glucose and potassium to maintain normal blood levels. After 15 min, insulin had significantly improved the performance of the failing left ventricle. Total peripheral resistance was decreased. Myocardial blood flow was significantly increased while myocardial oxygen consumption was unchanged. After beta receptor blockade with propranolol 0.5 mg kg-1 given intravenously, the improvement in cardiac performance was reduced, heart rate decreased, and a concomitant decrease in myocardial blood flow and oxygen consumption was recorded. Compared with values before treatment, the net effect of combined insulin and beta receptor blockade was unchanged LVdP/dtmax, LV end-diastolic pressure and cardiac output, significantly increased stroke volume and decreased heart rate, and moderately reduced total peripheral resistance and mean aortic blood pressure. Myocardial blood flow was unaltered, while myocardial oxygen consumption was significantly reduced. In the control group of 6 dogs propranolol was given before insulin, and similar haemodynamic alterations were found.", 
    "25": "A single-blind placebo-controlled study was conducted on black hypertensive patients with a once-daily dose of penbutolol (Betapressin; Hoechst); a non-selective beta-blocker. Of 29 patients who participated in a 4-week run-in period, 18 were entered into a 20-week trial of the active medication. Fourteen patients were adequately controlled, 2 did not respond satisfactorily and 2 dropped out of the study. On cessation of therapy all patients became hypertensive again. No significant changes in mean heart rates were observed during active medication as opposed to placebo. Penbutolol can therefore be used as a sole antihypertensive agent in blacks.", 
    "26": "The mortality and morbidity were assessed during a 2-year follow-up in an acute intervention trial in suspected acute myocardial infarction with metoprolol (a selective beta 1-blocker). On admission to the trial, the 1395 participating patients were randomly allocated to metoprolol or placebo for 3 months. Thereafter, if there was no contraindication, patients with infarction and/or angina pectoris were continued on metoprolol for 2 years. A lower mortality was observed after 3 months in patients randomised to metoprolol. The difference remained after 2 years. The difference in 2-year mortality rate was restricted to patients randomised early after onset of pain. Late infarction was observed more often in the placebo group during the first 3 months. When the two groups thereafter were treated similarly, the difference successively declined and did not remain after 2 years. A similar incidence of angina pectoris was observed in the two groups at each check up. During the early recovery period, more patients in the metoprolol group returned to work. No such difference was observed later on.", 
    "27": "Glycosuria, hyperglycemia, and nephrotic-range proteinuria developed in a 68-year-old patient after clonidine was added to a stable antihypertensive regimen, which included metoprolol, of three years' duration. He later became glucose-intolerant with fasting hyperglycemia. Clonidine has been reported to transiently impair glucose tolerance. Persistent diabetes in a previously normoglycemic patient following clonidine has not been reported, and it supports the possibility that clonidine and metoprolol may have additive effects in suppressing endogenous insulin secretion.", 
    "28": "A double-blind, randomized and placebo-controlled study was undertaken to assess the effects of metoprolol on controlled hypotension during halothane anaesthesia. Nineteen patients under-going middle ear or nasal septum surgery were studied. The aim was to achieve a 25% reduction of the mean arterial pressure in both groups. Metoprolol was given by mouth on two occasions in the 10-12 h before operation. In the group pretreated with metoprolol the halothane concentration was reduced by 35.5%. The duration of bleeding and its degree were reduced significantly. The time to awakening was shorter and of better quality after pretreatment with metoprolol. Rate-pressure product was less after pretreatment with metoprolol, and rebound hypertension was well controlled.", 
    "29": "Thirty hypertensive patients scheduled for cholecystectomy or hernia repair under general anaesthesia with thiopentone-fentanyl-nitrous oxide-pancuronium were divided into two groups of 15. One group received metoprolol tablets 200 mg in a slow release form, once daily for at least 2 weeks including the morning of surgery. In addition, metoprolol 15 mg was injected i.v. shortly before the induction of anaesthesia. The other group received placebo tablets and saline. Two patients in the treatment group and one patient in the placebo group were subsequently excluded, because of complications during treatment. Metoprolol significantly reduced arterial pressure both during undisturbed anaesthesia, during intubation and after extubation. A similar tendency was observed also during surgery, although it was not quite significant (P = 0.055). However, metoprolol had no effect on variations in systemic vascular resistance. Mean pulmonary arterial pressures during anaesthesia and surgery were significantly greater in the control, than in the metoprolol, group. Central venous pressure (CVP) and pulmonary arterial occlusion pressure (PAOP) increased significantly in both groups in response to the surgical stimulus. There was no significant difference between the groups in PAOP and CVP. One patient in the metoprolol group had marked bradycardia (minimum heart rate 26 beat min-1) after neostigmine and atropine; otherwise metoprolol pretreatment was tolerated well.", 
    "30": "To determine the relationship between hepatic glucose clearance and elevated epinephrine levels in sepsis, dogs with gangrenous cholecystitis were anesthetized and received either propranolol hydrochloride (mean dose, 0.29 mg/kg) or saline solution before intraduodenal glucose injection (2.5 g/kg). The amounts of glucose, insulin, and glucagon in the portal vein, the hepatic artery, and the hepatic vein were determined from the concentrations and the blood flows in these vessels over a two-hour period. Normal dogs served as controls. The amounts of glucose, insulin, and glucagon reaching the livers of both septic groups were the same. However, propranolol treatment increased the percent of glucose extracted by the liver without affecting the extractions of insulin or glucagon. Propranolol reverses the limitation of hepatic glucose extraction in sepsis by a direct effect. Whether the extracted glucose is utilizable as an energy substrate needs to be established.", 
    "31": "Thirteen patients with good left ventricular function undergoing coronary artery revascularization were studied to determine the cardiovascular effects of verapamil, 75-150 micrograms X kg-1, after a large dose (100 micrograms X kg-1) of fentanyl, with pancuronium for muscle relaxation. The patients were continued on their usual cardiovascular medications until the time of surgery, which included nitrates, beta adrenergic blockers, and nifedipine. Anaesthesia with fentanyl was associated with decreases in mean arterial blood pressure, systemic vascular resistance, left ventricular stroke work index, and circulating catecholamine levels. Mean values were not further changed by verapamil, but individual patients had additional modest decreases in blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance. Cardiac index, however, was well maintained. Plasma catecholamines remained depressed after verapamil under the study condition. Thus, in patients with good left ventricular function, clinically relevant doses of verapamil were well tolerated even in the presence of an anaesthetic that included large doses of fentanyl, with suppression of circulating catecholamine levels.", 
    "32": "The antianginal effects of nifedipine 20 mg three times a day and atenolol 100 mg once a day singly and in combination were investigated in 16 patients with angina pectoris. The amount of work that could be done before angina and ST depression appeared was significantly increased by atenolol and the combination but not by nifedipine. At peak exercise the number of leads on a 16 point precordial electrocardiogram map that demonstrated greater than or equal to 1 mm ST segment depression was significantly reduced from a mean (SD) of 5.0 (0.4) on placebo to 3.7 (0.6), 2.8 (0.4), and 2.3 (0.7) on nifedipine, atenolol, and the combination respectively. Mean resting left ventricular ejection fraction, assessed by gated radionuclide ventriculography, did not change during any active treatment phase but increased significantly during exercise only on nifedipine and the combination. The nifedipine/atenolol combination was the most effective treatment, and the data suggest that nifedipine may be used to best advantage in combination with a beta blocker.", 
    "33": "Using a glucose-responsive beta cell line, we tested the hypothesis that the free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) is the primary signal that couples a stimulus to insulin secretion, and examined the involvement of the extracellular Ca2+ pool in this process. Glucose or depolarization of the beta cell with 40 mM K+ stimulated a monophasic release of insulin directly proportional to the extracellular Ca2+ concentration. 40 mM K+ increased 45Ca2+ uptake and increased [Ca2+]i, which was measured with quin 2, 4.7-fold, from 56 +/- 3 to 238 +/- 17 nM. With high glucose, 45Ca2+ uptake did not increase, and [Ca2+]i was unchanged or fell slightly. There was a striking correlation between inhibitory effects of verapamil, the Ca2+ channel blocker, on insulin secretion and the rise in [Ca2+]i evoked by K+. Higher concentrations of verapamil were required to inhibit glucose- than K+-stimulated insulin secretion (dose giving half-maximal effect of 1.4 X 10(-4) M vs. 6.0 X 10(-7) M). Incubation in Ca2+-free, 1 mM EGTA buffer for 30 min lowered [Ca2+]i to 14 +/- 2 nM, and inhibited acute insulin release to both secretagogues. If high glucose was present in the Ca2+-free period, reintroduction of 2.5 mM Ca2+ in high glucose restored insulin secretion only to the basal rate. However, if low glucose was present during the Ca2+-free period, high glucose and 2.5 mM Ca2+ triggered a full first-phase insulin response. These data suggest that high glucose generates a non-Ca2+ signal that turns over rapidly and provide direct evidence that K+ triggers insulin release by drawing extracellular Ca2+ into the beta cell through verapamil-sensitive Ca2+ channels. However, an increase [Ca2+]i is not the primary signal that evokes glucose-stimulated insulin release in this beta cell line.", 
    "34": "The technique of in vitro labelling and autoradiography has been used to localize beta-adrenoceptors in sections of the splenic vascular bundle of the dog. Binding of (-)-[125I]-cyanopindolol (Cyp) to sections of splenic vascular bundle equilibrated within 150 min and slowly dissociated after addition of (-)-propranolol. The process was saturable with a dissociation constant (KD) of 40.3 +/- 4.4 pM and Bmax of 18.9 +/- 1.7 fM (in 6 sections). Binding to sections was stereoselective, the (-)-isomer of propranolol being 90 times more effective than the (+)-isomer in competing for (-)-[125I]-Cyp binding. Delineation of beta-adrenoceptor subtypes using the selective antagonists betaxolol (beta 1) and ICI 118,551 (beta 2) indicated that the receptors present were almost exclusively of the beta 2-subtype. Autoradiographic studies under the conditions evaluated in the biochemical experiments showed that beta-adrenoceptors are unevenly distributed in the dog splenic vein, artery and associated nerve bundles. High concentrations of receptors are associated with the splenic nerves and lower but still significant concentrations in the vasculature. Higher resolution studies with nuclear emulsion coated coverslips revealed concentrations of beta-adrenoceptors over cells adjacent to the lumen in veins. In arteries most beta-adrenoceptors were found associated with the medial layer with fewer receptors towards the intima or adventitia. Serial sections of either artery or vein incubated with (-)-[125I]-Cyp in the presence of (-)-propranolol showed low levels of non-localized binding.", 
    "35": "The distribution and binding characteristics of the radioligand (-)-[125I]-cyanopindolol (CYP) have been examined in slide mounted mouse kidney sections, using the technique of in vitro labelling and autoradiography. (-)-[125I]-CYP binding to sections was of high affinity (KD = 55.8 pmol/l, s.e.m. = 8.1, n = 4) to a single population of non-interacting sites (nH = 0.95, s.e.m. = 0.01, Bmax = 0.74 fmol/section, s.e.m. = 0.12, n = 4) and stereoselective with respect to the (-)- and (+)-isomers of both propranolol and pindolol. Autoradiographic studies showed that (-)-[125I]-CYP binding was localized to areas in the renal cortex and medulla. Both cortical and medullary binding were abolished by the inclusion of (-)-propranolol (1 mumol/l) in the incubation medium, whereas (-)-isoprenaline (200 mumol/l) selectively abolished cortical binding. Medullary binding could be prevented by the inclusion of the lipophilic compounds cinanserin (10 mumol/l), haloperidol (10 mumol/l) or phentolamine (10 mumol/l), either alone or together or by washing at 37 degrees C. These results suggest that medullary binding sites are lipid rather than receptor-related. In conclusion, in mouse kidney sections, (-)-[125I]-CYP binds to discrete areas in the cortex and medulla. Cortical binding sites have the molecular characteristics of beta-adrenoceptors while medullary binding sites are lipid-related. Caution should therefore be exercised when defining non-specific binding of lipophilic radioligands. The autoradiographic technique is useful for discriminating between receptor and non-receptor binding sites.", 
    "36": "The effects of serum, alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (AAG), serum lipoproteins (SLP) and human serum albumin (HSA) on 3H-(-)-dihydroalprenolol (3H-(-)-DHA) binding and (-)-isoproterenol ((-)-IPR) induced cyclic AMP (cAMP) elevation in human peripheral blood mononuclear leucocytes (MNL) were investigated. The saturable binding of 3H-(-)-DHA was decomposed into two classes of binding sites with maximum binding capacity of approximately 1400 and 30000 sites/cell and with dissociation constants (Kd) of approximately 0.7 and 65 nM. Stimulation of the MNL beta-adrenoceptors by (-)-IPR caused a concentration dependent cAMP accumulation (EC50 approximately 0.2 microM) with maximum level approximately 250% above basal. For all single leucocyte preparations, 30-35 min. exposure to serum, AAG and SLP increased the number of beta-adrenoceptors with 100-200% and the maximal responsiveness to (-)-IPR with 30-90%. The presence of proteins did not change the Kd or the EC50. (-)-Alprenolol inhibited concentration dependently the serum induced increment in (-)-IPR-responsiveness. Serum, AAG and SLP did also increase the number of low affinity binding sites with 25-40% without effect on the Kd. HSA had no consistent effect on beta-adrenergic binding or stimulation. The present study shows that serum, AAG and SLP influence the number and function of MNL beta-adrenoceptors in vitro.", 
    "37": "Acebutolol is a new hydrophilic, cardioselective beta-adrenergic-blocking agent that possesses partial agonist and membrane-stabilizing activities. In the treatment of mild to moderate essential hypertension, once-daily acebutolol as monotherapy provides effective control in a large majority of patients and produces a further reduction in blood pressure when used concomitantly with diuretics. Acebutolol is as effective as other beta-blocking agents, and in a large, double-blind, parallel study against propranolol was found to cause less reduction in heart rate, and fewer neurologic side effects and patient withdrawals due to adverse effects. Oral acebutolol is also effective in suppressing premature ventricular contractions, and in small numbers of patients generally beneficial results were obtained in supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias with intravenous administration. These salutary effects are attributable to beta blockade. Controlled clinical trials documented the antianginal actions of oral acebutolol in chronic stable angina pectoris; its efficacy in this regard is comparable to that of other beta-blocking agents. The drug produces smaller decreases in heart rate and cardiac output and alterations in peripheral vascular hemodynamics than beta-blocking drugs without partial agonist activity, and because of its cardioselectivity, it may be used cautiously in patients with bronchospastic disease. Acebutolol has minimal metabolic effects and does not elevate levels of blood lipids during long-term therapy; high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol increased with acebutolol in a small number of patients.", 
    "38": "Agonist and antagonist binding characteristics of beta-adrenoceptors in turkey erythrocyte ghosts were determined at different temperatures ranging between 7 degrees C and 42 degrees C. [3H]-DHA saturation binding experiments revealed that the antagonist-receptor interaction is entropy-driven with a small enthalpic contribution. Isoproterenol/[3H]-DHA competition binding followed the law of mass action at all the investigated temperatures. The agonist-receptor interaction is enthalpy driven with a small unfavorable decrease in entropy. This is consistent with the agonist's ability to favor an endoenergetic transconformation of the receptors. Only part of the agonist-bound receptors can undergo functional coupling to the stimulatory component of the adenylate cyclase system (Ns). This coupling process is associated with \"locking-in\" of the agonist and becomes persistent in the presence of the alkylating reagent N-ethylmaleimide. The number of agonist/N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive sites (i.e. coupling-prone receptors) increases with the temperature until it reaches a plateau value of 50% between 27-32 degrees C. Qualitatively similar data were obtained for rat lung and turkey erythrocyte membranes. These observations suggest that the whole receptor population can undergo agonist-mediated conformational changes but that only part of them can couple to Ns.", 
    "39": "The potassium entry blocker, 4-aminopyridine has been used to evaluate the importance of this cation in several tissues including the adrenal cortex. Since it inhibited corticosteroidogenesis, an important role for potassium entry in the control of this process has been implied. In the present in vitro study, 4-aminopyridine inhibited cortisol and corticosterone production and, at high concentrations, that of 11-deoxycortisol and 11-deoxycorticosterone. However, at lower concentrations, 11-deoxycorticosteroid production increased suggesting that 4-aminopyridine acts as an inhibitor of 11 beta hydroxylation. Its slight resemblance to metyrapone may suggest that it acts, at least in part, by competing for cytochrome P450. However, its use as a potassium inhibitor in studies of the adrenal cortex may give ambiguous results.", 
    "40": "This report describes a 78-year-old woman with insulinoma, treated with a combination of diphenylhydantoin and a calcium antagonist. The effectiveness of 200 mg of diphenylhydantoin and 180 mg of diltiazem was evaluated by measuring the levels of plasma glucose, immunoreactive insulin and immunoreactive insulin/plasma glucose after fasting or by the oral glucose tolerance test, and by the appearance of hypoglycemic symptoms. The mean concentration of fasting plasma glucose increased significantly during the treatment. The levels of immunoreactive insulin/plasma glucose and C-peptide immunoreactivity/plasma glucose significantly decreased. Symptomatically, no episode of hypoglycemia was noted during the combined treatment.", 
    "41": "The nature of beta adrenergic receptors in human cerebral arteries was characterized and alteration of these receptors after subarachnoid hemorrhage was examined using a radioligand binding assay. The specific 3H-dihydroalprenolol, a beta adrenergic antagonist, binding to human cerebral arteries was saturable and of high affinity (KD = 12.3 nM) with a Bmax of 790 fmol/mg protein. Ki values and Hill coefficients of adrenergic agents for 3H-dihydroalprenolol were as follows; propranolol, 4.1 X 10(-8)M, 1.01; isoproterenol, 1.7 X 10(-6)M, 0.80; epinephrine, 8.3 X 10(-6)M, 0.48; norepinephrine, 2.3 X 10(-5)M, 0.45; metoprolol, 6.8 X 10(-8)M and 7.9 X 10(-6)M, 0.62; butoxamine, 2.2 X 10(-8)M and 2.1 X 10(-6)M, 0.43. The analysis of inhibition of specific 3H-dihydroalprenolol binding by these adrenergic agents suggests that human cerebral arteries contain a high density of beta adrenergic receptors and that the receptors are classified into two types, namely beta 1 and beta 2 adrenergic receptors. The calculated beta 1/beta 2 ratio from Hofstee plots was approximately 4/6. KD and Bmax of 3H-dihydroalprenolol binding to the cerebral arteries after subarachnoid hemorrhage were compared with those of control group. KD and Bmax of 3H-dihydroalprenolol binding of subarachnoid hemorrhage group were 13.9 nM and 1140 fmol/mg protein, respectively. The calculated beta 1/beta 2 ratio was approximately 6/4. These data suggest that the density of total beta adrenergic receptors increased without any significant change in the affinity after subarachnoid hemorrhage and that the increase of beta 1 adrenergic receptors was dominant.", 
    "42": "Desensitization of lung beta-adrenoreceptors induced by 4 day in vivo isoprenaline administration to rats has been investigated both from a functional a biochemical viewpoint. Chronic isoprenaline treatment significantly reduced the relaxing activity of the beta-agonist when tested ex vivo in lung parenchymal strips and also impaired the adenylate-cyclase system. Moreover, the desensitization procedure decreased by about 30% beta-adrenoreceptor number. In vivo indomethacin treatment prevented the loss of pharmacological responsiveness of the tissue to isoprenaline and restored basal adenylate-cyclase activity. These data indicate that in vivo isoprenaline administration actually leads to pulmonary beta-adrenoreceptor desensitization. The involvement of arachidonic acid metabolites in this phenomenon is also discussed.", 
    "43": "We studied regional variation in canine trachealis smooth muscle sensitivity and responsiveness to methacholine as well as basal and methacholine-stimulated adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity. The trachea between the cricoid cartilage and the carina was divided into three segments of equal length (designated cervical, middle, and thoracic regions), each consisting of approximately 12-14 cartilage rings. Smooth muscle strips from each of the three regions were exposed to cumulative half-log increments of methacholine chloride. The sensitivity (-log EC50) and responsiveness (force per cross-sectional area and force per milligram protein) of the smooth muscle to methacholine in each region was determined from these data. Smooth muscle strips from cervical and thoracic regions were frozen before and after exposure to cumulative half-log increments of methacholine up to each region's previously determined EC50. Frozen samples were assayed for cAMP content or cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity. The relationship between resting tension and methacholine sensitivity and responsiveness were studied. For the size strips we used, 4 g resting tension set the average cervical and thoracic strips at 96 and 101% of their optimal length, respectively. The methacholine EC50 was not affected by a variation in resting tension. Sensitivity to methacholine was 7.1, 6.8, and 6.5 for cervical, middle, and thoracic regions, respectively. The responsiveness of the cervical and thoracic smooth muscle to methacholine was 16.4 and 16.3 g force/mm2, respectively, at an EC50 methacholine. Basal cAMP was lower in cervical smooth muscle than in thoracic. cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity ratios under both basal and EC50 methacholine-stimulated conditions were lower in cervical smooth muscle than in thoracic. We have observed in trachealis smooth muscle an inverse relationship between methacholine sensitivity and either cAMP or cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity. We suggest that cAMP and cAMP-dependent protein kinase play a role in the regulation of airway smooth muscle sensitivity to cholinergic agonists.", 
    "44": "Intracellular recordings from locus coeruleus neurons grown in explant cultures reveal age-related differences in the responses to iontophoretically applied noradrenaline. Cells grown in culture for more than 26 days exhibit a simple hyperpolarizing response while cells cultured for less than 26 days often have biphasic hyperpolarizing-depolarizing responses. Pharmacological studies with selective adrenergic agonists and antagonists show that the hyperpolarizations and hyperpolarizing parts of biphasic responses are mediated by alpha 2 adrenergic receptors while the depolarizing responses are mediated by alpha 1 receptors. These observations may reflect a population of neurotransmitter receptors which is transiently present during early postnatal development.", 
    "45": "We performed quantitative light microscopic autoradiography of [3H]dihydroalprenolol (DHA) binding to frozen sections of canine myocardium to test the hypothesis that there are differences in the density or affinity of beta-adrenergic receptors on various tissue compartments. In one study, with concentrations of [3H]DHA from 0.34 to 5.1 nM, specific binding to cardiac myocytes was saturable, whereas nonspecific binding was linear with ligand concentration. Arterioles had more specific grain counts than muscle cells (P less than 0.0001), and Scatchard analysis showed that the arterioles had a much higher affinity for [3H]DHA than myocytes. In a second study with lower concentrations of [3H]DHA (0.19-1.98 nM), binding to the arterioles saturated, whereas binding to the cardiac myocytes did not. Specific binding to arterioles was significantly higher (P less than 0.0001) than binding to myocytes at all concentrations of [3H]DHA. The dissociation constants for the subendocardial and subepicardial myocytes were 1.57 and 1.71 nM, respectively, while the dissociation constant for the arterioles was 0.26 nM. The maximum number of binding sites was 911 grains/0.9 X 10(-2) mm2 for subepicardial myocytes, 936 for subendocardial myocytes, and 986 for arterioles. The large nerves accompanying an epicardial artery also demonstrated specific [3H]DHA binding. Thus this study has demonstrated major differences in the distribution and affinity of beta-adrenergic receptors, which may help to explain various physiological responses to beta-adrenergic stimulation.", 
    "46": "The type and amount of adrenergic receptors in different tissues are important determinants of their response to adrenergic stimulation in normal and pathologic states. Autoradiographic analysis of receptor binding has the advantage that receptor sites can be localized over different tissue compartments. However, quantitative assessment of receptor sites through autoradiography can only be made by using radioactive standards. The purpose of this study was to investigate the use of an internal standard method for quantitative autoradiographic receptor studies by analyzing the binding of the beta-receptor antagonist, [3H]dihydroalprenolol, to canine cardiac tissue. Sections from dog heart were incubated in [3H]dihydroalprenolol to label the beta-adrenergic receptors in the absence of (total binding) and in the presence of (nonspecific binding), 10(-5) M (+/-) propranolol. Specific binding was calculated as total minus nonspecific binding. Half of the sections were scraped off of the slides and assayed by scintillation spectrometry, and half of the sections were set up for light microscopic autoradiography. The autoradiograms were exposed, developed and stained, and grain density was quantified by using an automated image analyzer. By plotting grain density per tissue section against cpm per tissue section for total, nonspecific and specific binding, curves for efficiency of the autoradiographs were obtained. There were no significant differences among the slopes of the three lines. Also, there were no significant differences among the efficiencies of the total, nonspecific and specific binding at different concentrations of [3H]dihydroalprenolol using a two way analysis of variance. Thus, grain counts from the autoradiographs can be used to estimate the concentration of beta-adrenergic receptors in cardiac myocytes. By using these methods it was calculated that canine cardiac myocytes have 5.12 X 10(9) receptor sites/mm3.", 
    "47": "Effects of stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system on pentagastrin-induced increases in gastric acid secretion and mucosal blood flow (MBF) were studied in anesthetized, gastric fistula rats. Gastric acid secretion and MBF were increased by i.v. infusion of a submaximal dose of pentagastrin (1.0 microgram/kg/min). Stimulation of the splanchnic nerve was carried out under the steady, increased state of pentagastrin-stimulated acid secretion and MBF. Stimulation of the splanchnic nerve significantly reduced gastric acid secretion, while MBF was little affected. Thus, the delta MBF/delta H+ ratio was significantly increased during this stimulation. Phentolamine, but not propranolol, abolished the inhibitory effects of splanchnic nerve stimulation on the pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion. In addition, prazosin, but not yohimbine, abolished the inhibitory effects of splanchnic nerve stimulation on the pentagastrin-induced gastric acid secretion. These results suggest that splanchnic nerves directly inhibit pentagastrin-induced gastric acid secretion through alpha-1 adrenoceptors, independently of changes in the MBF, in rats.", 
    "48": "A new in vitro radioligand binding assay is described for brown adipose tissue using the beta adrenergic antagonist [3H]CGP 12177 (4-(3-t-butylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy)-[5,7-3H]benzimidazol-2-one). Binding was saturable and stereoselectively inhibited by propranolol. There was 60 to 80% specific binding using either 30 microM l-isoproterenol or 10 microM l-propranolol to define nonsaturable binding. [3H]CGP 12177 was bound to partially purified membranes from collagenase-separated brown adipocytes with a Kd of 0.84 nM, as determined from kinetic studies, and 1.24 +/- 0.13 nM as found by equilibrium binding studies; maximum binding was 14.2 +/- 0.9 fmol/mg of protein. Membranes from whole-pad homogenates had a similar Kd of 1.17 +/- 0.14 nM but twice the maximum number of binding sites (28.5 +/- 4.4 fmol/mg of protein). Intact brown adipocytes had a Kd of 0.55 nM and a maximum binding of 29.4 +/- 1.5 fmol X 10(-6)/cell or 17,700 sites per cell. Competitive binding studies showed about 80% of the binding sites to be of the beta-1 and 20% of the beta-2 subtype. The pA2 values derived from inhibition of isoproterenol-stimulated in vitro oxygen consumption in intact brown adipocytes by the beta-1 selective antagonist metoprolol and beta-2 selective lCl 118551 were in close agreement with their respective K1 values at the beta-1 receptor as derived from competitive binding studies. These data strongly suggest that the beta-1 adrenoreceptor on brown adipose tissue is primarily responsible for the initiation of thermogenesis in this tissue.", 
    "49": "QRS-amplitudes and other ECG variables have been studied in 168 middle-aged men with uncomplicated, mild-to-moderate untreated primary hypertension. They were randomized to treatment with either the beta-adrenoceptor blocker metoprolol (n = 88) or the thiazide diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (n = 80). Significant reductions in combined precordial voltages (S1 + R5-6, S2 + R4, Smax + Rmax) were achieved on both regimens, probably reflecting a regression of hypertensive cardiac involvement. In the group treated with beta-blockers the reduction in all three combined voltage measurements was significant after one year's treatment. A longer period of treatment seemed to be necessary to achieve equal reductions with hydrochlorothiazide although a non-significant reduction was observed after the first year of follow-up in this group. A small increase in 1st degree AV-block was observed on both regimens, but no 2nd degree or total AV-block was recorded.", 
    "50": "A very sensitive method of 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerophosphocholine (platelet activating factor) quantitation is described. 1-O-Alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerophosphocholine is converted to 1-O-alkyl-2-acetylglycerol by treating with phospholipase-C which is in turn acylated with pentaflurobenzoyl chloride. The resulting diglyceryl ester of pentafluorobenzene is analysed by gas chromatography/negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry. With methane as the reagent gas the pentafluorobenzoyl acyl derivative yields mainly the molecular anion ([M]-.) representing more than 92% of the total ion current. Deuterium-labeled 1-O-hexadecyl-2-(2H3)acetyl-sn-glycerophosphocholine is used as the internal standard for quantitation. The standard curves are linear and typically have a correlation coefficient of greater than 0.999. Using 1 pg of the deuterium-labeled internal standard, quantities as low as 100 fg are measured.", 
    "51": "The cholinoceptor antagonists anisodamine and anisodine are widely used in the People's Republic of China for the management of acute circulatory shock but the mechanism of their beneficial effects is not fully known; we therefore investigated if these agents possessed adrenoceptor blocking properties. The antagonistic effect of anisodamine and anisodine against the specific binding of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor ligand [3H]-WB-4101 to cardiac and brain tissue membrane preparations and against the effects of phenylephrine on isolated aortic strips and left atria of rats were compared with classical muscarinic receptor and adrenoceptor blocking agents. Both anisodamine and anisodine possessed alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocking properties; the order of potency of various agents in displacing the binding of [3H]-WB-4101 to receptors and in antagonizing the effects of phenylephrine on aortic strips and left atria was: prazosin greater than atropine greater than anisodamine greater than scopolamine greater than anisodine. It is concluded that both anisodamine and to a lesser extent anisodine possess alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocking properties; this antagonistic activity of anisodamine may contribute to its salutary effects on the microcirculation. However, it is unlikely that anisodine produces a significant adrenoceptor blockade in the clinically used dose-range.", 
    "52": "In rabbit isolated pulmonary artery previously incubated with [3H]-noradrenaline, isoprenaline (0.3 microM) had no effect on the stimulation-induced outflow of radioactivity. However, if the phosphodiesterase inhibitor ICI 63,197 (30 microM) or the alpha-adrenoceptor blocker phentolamine (1 microM) was present, then isoprenaline significantly enhanced the stimulation-induced outflow, an effect blocked by propranolol (0.1 microM). ICI 63,197 (30 microM) but not phentolamine significantly enhanced the stimulation-induced outflow of radioactivity. In mouse isolated atria previously incubated with [3H]-noradrenaline and stimulated at a frequency of 10 Hz, isoprenaline had no effect on the stimulation-induced outflow of radioactivity; this is in contrast to its release-enhancing effects at stimulation frequencies of 4 Hz and 2 Hz. The facilitation of stimulation-induced outflow by isoprenaline at 4 Hz was blocked by propranolol (0.08 microM) which, by itself, had no effect on the stimulation-induced outflow. At a stimulation frequency of 2 Hz in mouse atria the facilitatory effect of isoprenaline (0.01 microM) was significantly greater in the presence of ICI 63,197 (30 microM) which, by itself, had no effect on the stimulation-induced outflow. Similarly, the facilitatory effect of isoprenaline was significantly greater in the presence of phentolamine (1 microM) but, in this case, phentolamine significantly enhanced the stimulation-induced outflow. These results suggest that facilitatory prejunctional beta-adrenoceptors are present in both rabbit pulmonary artery and mouse atria. The effects of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor ICI 63,197 suggest that they are linked to adenylate cyclase in both tissues and we propose that the ability of phentolamine to facilitate the release and enhance the effect of isoprenaline may be due to the blockade of alpha-adrenoceptor inhibition of adenylate cyclase. This latter proposition needs further investigation.", 
    "53": "The inhibitory effects of beta-blocking agents against the action of phospholipase (PLase) were investigated. Using micelles of dimyristoyl (-)-alpha-phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) as a substrate, myristic acid (MA) released from DMPC by PLase A2 was determined by gas chromatography. Beta-Blocking agents were divided into 4 groups depending on their inhibitory effects on PLase. Their inhibitory effects on PLase could be due to their displacing ability with Ca++ on membrane phospholipids, since Ca++ is an essential factor for the activation of PLase.", 
    "54": "The recognition of histopathologic substrates of myocardial contractile damage in human acute ischemia is still very poor, notwithstanding the impressive advances in the inherent clinical diagnostic technology and concepts. The first and foremost inotropic abnormality ensuing ischemia, easily taken for atonic in origin, actually consists of a pathologic contracture of the injured myocardium, depending upon abrupt fall of ATP, and defective extrusion calcium pump with persistence of actomyosin rigor-complexes. In sustained ischemia, further membrane damage exposes the myocell to massive calcium intrusion, with eventual precipitation of it and cell death (reperfusion stone-heart). In case of transient, \"hit and run\" ischemia, the \"stunned\" myocardium undergoes prolonged contractile abnormalities. In keeping with fundamentals in pathophysiology of contraction, ischemic myofibrils in human hyperacute infarct, showed spare I bands, accounting for contracture and followed by loss of the regular cross-striation register; then, groups of adjacent sarcomeres were seen to join into true \"contraction\" bands, with Z lines impinging upon A bands and obliterating the I bands. Coagulative denaturation of contractile proteins follows, presenting as irregular, amorphous degeneration stripes astride irreversibly damaged myocells. As such, these cells can be passively overstretched by the nearby functioning muscle. In turn, the fixed waviness of viable, acutely ischemic myocardium was thought to configure, histologically, the loss of ATP-dependent \"plasticity\" of myofilaments, in a state of contracture. The \"relaxant effect\" of inotropic-chronotropic-positive catecholamines, favoring diastole, has been also pointed out. The present microscopic findings are cogent to clinicopathologic problems of coronary ischemia-reperfusion, and sudden death from cardiogenic shock.", 
    "55": "In order to elucidate some aspects of cholinergic and adrenergic interaction in the dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus and its effect on systemic arterial pressure, carbachol and nicotine were injected into this area alone or preceded by regitine and propranolol. Both carbachol and nicotine induced hypotensive effects in normotensive anesthetized rats. Previous application of 20, 40, 80 and 160 nmol propranolol did not alter the hypotension induced, but doses of 20, 40 and 80 nmol regitine gradually attenuated the hypotensive effects of carbachol and nicotine.", 
    "56": "In anesthetized dogs, an intravenous injection of nipradilol produced a long lasting fall in mean arterial blood pressure which was accompanied by transient decreases in peripheral vascular resistance and sustained decreases in heart rate, cardiac output and left ventricular (LV) dP/dt. LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was not changed while LV diameters and central venous pressure were slightly increased. Under propranolol pretreatment conditions, nipradilol no longer affected the heart rate, but the drug still induced a transient reduction in peripheral vascular resistance, and sustained decreases in arterial blood pressure and cardiac output. Furthermore, indicators of LV preload (LVEDP, LV end-diastolic diameter and central venous pressure) were significantly reduced, suggesting a direct dilating action of nipradilol on capacitance vessels. In intact conscious dogs, nipradilol caused a sustained reduction in LVEDP, while propranolol increased LVEDP. After administration of nipradilol, coronary blood flow in anesthetized dogs decreased in association with diminished myocardial oxygen consumption, and large coronary vessel resistance also decreased. Nipradilol competitively antagonized the isoproterenol-induced positive chronotropic response (DR10: 0.04 mg/Kg, i.v.) and the phenylephrine-induced vasopressor response (DR10: 3.95 mg/Kg, i.v.). In conclusion, nipradilol, in contrast to propranolol, possesses the properties to decrease arterial blood pressure, LV preload and large coronary vessel resistance through its dilating action on arterial and venous vessels. It is proposed that nipradilol may be beneficial for the treatment of hypertension and coronary heart disease.", 
    "57": "CA1 pyramidal neurones were studied in rat in vitro hippocampal slices using standard intracellular and single-electrode voltage-clamp recording techniques to examine the actions of noradrenaline (NA). NA had two different effects on the resting membrane potential of pyramidal neurones; either a hyperpolarization accompanied by a decrease in membrane input resistance, or less commonly, a depolarization accompanied by an increase in input resistance. In many cells, both effects, a hyperpolarization followed by a depolarization were observed. The depolarization was mediated by a noradrenergic beta-receptor. The hyperpolarization was more difficult to characterize, but may result from alpha-receptor activation. NA reduced the amplitude and duration of the slow calcium-activated potassium after-hyperpolarization (a.h.p.) that follows depolarization-induced action potentials. This action of NA was mediated by beta 1-noradrenergic receptors. NA, in the presence of tetrodotoxin and tetraethylammonium, reduced the a.h.p. without reducing the size of the calcium action potential which preceded it. This was unlike the action of the calcium channel blocker, cadmium, which reduced the calcium action potential and the a.h.p. in parallel. Furthermore, NA did not reduce the amplitude of calcium or barium currents recorded under voltage clamp after blockade of potassium currents. A functional consequence of this blockade of the calcium-activated a.h.p. was a reduction of the accommodation of action potential discharge such that the excitatory responses of the neurone to depolarizing stimuli, such as glutamate application or current passed through the recording electrode, were enhanced. We conclude that the effects of NA on calcium-activated potassium conductance and on resting membrane potential can interact to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of hippocampal pyramidal neurone responsiveness.", 
    "58": "The hemodynamic effects of the slow release form of a calcium channel blocker, nifedipine retard, in essential hypertension patients after angiotensin II (AII) infusion were studied using nuclear ventriculography. Sublingual nifedipine lowered blood pressure that had been acutely raised by an infusion of AII to its baseline level. When used for 4 weeks, nifedipine retard maintained its blood-pressure-lowering effects without a change in heart rate, both when used alone and when used in addition to beta-adrenergic blockers. In the patients with untreated essential hypertension, nifedipine counteracted the lowering effect of AII on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), which was 67.5 +/- 8.9% at recumbency, 61.2 +/- 6.6% (+/- SD) during AII infusion, and 72.1 +/- 7.5% 30 minutes after sublingual nifedipine. These acute effects seem to result from a marked reduction in total peripheral resistance (TPR) and are accompanied by a rise in cardiac index (CI). The TPR, in dynes/sec/cm-5, was 1376.9 +/- 275.8 at recumbency, 2000.7 +/- 358 during AII infusion, and 1228.6 +/- 289 30 minutes after sublingual nifedipine. The corresponding figures for CI in liters/M2 BSA, were 4.02 +/- 0.77, 3.03 +/- 0.64, and 4.32 +/- 0.79. In patients receiving beta-blocker therapy (propranolol or atenolol) with inadequate control of blood pressure, similar results were obtained in LVEF (69.7 +/- 8.87% at recumbency, 63.7 +/- 11.9% during AII infusion, and 72.2 +/- 6.05% 30 minutes after sublingual nifedipine). The initial TPR was much higher than that of untreated essential hypertensive patients. Nevertheless, the increase obtained during AII infusion was counteracted by sublingual nifedipine. CI was decreased by AII.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "59": "The use of pharmacologic intervention in the management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome is briefly presented. The use of carbamazepine, a tricyclic anticonvulsant with clinical efficacy in depressive illness, in alcohol withdrawal treatment is reviewed. A comparative analysis between carbamazepine and major drugs used in alcohol withdrawal syndrome is made. This includes the evaluation of both clinical advantages and disadvantages in addition to identification of drug adverse reaction and interaction with alcohol. The mechanism of action of carbamazepine is also examined. Carbamazepine appears to possess a useful pharmacotherapeutic potential in the management of acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome, and its use in long-term treatment is suggested.", 
    "60": "Neurotransmitter mechanisms that mediate the effect of ethanol on urine output were examined in male rats. To establish the neuronal systems involved in the diuretic action of ethanol, urine output was evaluated in animals pretreated with various pharmacological agents. The intraventricular administration of norepinephrine (1.5-12 micrograms) increased the diuresis produced by a 1.25 g/kg dose of ethanol. Clonidine (2.5, 5.0 micrograms), an alpha 2-receptor agonist, also increased ethanol diuresis, while the alpha 1-receptor antagonist phentolamine (14 and 35 micrograms) reduced it. beta 1,2-Adrenergic blocker propranolol (5 and 10 micrograms) significantly depressed ethanol-induced urine output. Conversely the beta 2,2-noradrenergic agonist isoproterenol (5 and 10 micrograms) increased the diuretic action of ethanol. On the other hand dopamine (4-20 micrograms) and serotonin (8 and 20 micrograms) had no effect on ethanol diuresis when given intraventricularly. These results indicate that the diuretic action of ethanol involves noradrenergic mechanisms.", 
    "61": "Hyperthyroidism is frequently associated with myopathy. Beta-blocking agents, which are increasingly used in the treatment of hyperthyroidism, have been reported to have a possible beneficial effect on thyrotoxic myopathy. We have studied the myopathic changes in experimental hyperthyroidism in rats and the effect of the beta-blocking agents metoprolol and propranolol on these changes. During experimental hyperthyroidism, conversion of type 1 to type 2 fibres and accumulation of intracellular lipid, increased amounts of mitochondria, and reduced size of muscle fibers were noticed. None of these changes were prevented by metoprolol or propranolol. The results indicate that histochemical and morphological changes in skeletal muscle induced by thyroid hormone are not mediated by beta-receptors. The results of this investigation make dubious a beneficial effect of beta-blocking agents on thyrotoxic myopathy.", 
    "62": "The therapeutical procedure in case of acute cardio-circulatory failure due to intoxication by beta-blockers has gained great importance owing to suicidal and accidental poisonings with lethal outcome. The use of beta-adrenergic agonists is difficult because a not predeterminable overdosage has to be applied in consequence of the competitive inhibition of the beta-receptor. Cardiotonics with a non-adrenergic mechanism of action thus make expect a surer handling. A severe cardio-circulatory failure is provoked by talinolol in the anaesthetized dog. The therapeutical effect of 4 mg/kg Cordemcura, given i.v. is represented by comparing the parameters cardiac rate, dp/dtmax, filling pressure in the left ventricle, arterial pressure, cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and PQ time with a control group. The results prove a sure therapeutical effect, which is compared with other cardiotonics. A clinical use is recommended. The aptitude of the intoxication by beta-receptor blokkers as a model for the cardiac insufficiency is discussed.", 
    "63": "To investigate circadian variation of cardiac arrhythmias ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring was carried out before and after one week's treatment with a long acting beta-adrenoceptor blocker, nadolol, in 26 patients who presented with symptoms attributable to arrhythmias. Analysis of the 24 hour profile of premature ventricular contractions showed a significantly (P less than 0.05) higher frequency during midday to midnight than between midnight and midday. The frequency of supraventricular tachycardia was significantly (P less than 0.05) higher during the periods from 12.00 hours to 16.00 hours (11.0 +/- 12) and 16.00 hours to 20.00 hours (11.3 +/- 11) than during the periods of 00.00 hours to 04.00 hours (3.6 +/- 3) and 04.00 hours to 08.00 hours (6.0 +/- 8). The period of the highest incidence of all arrhythmias was between 16.00 hours to 24.00 hours, and that of lowest during the period between 04.00 hours to 12.00 hours (P less than 0.01). After one week's treatment with nadolol the frequency of all arrhythmias was strikingly reduced but their pattern of occurrence remained unchanged. These studies suggest that patients who present with symptoms attributable to arrhythmias tend to have these more frequently during the physical and mental activities of the day and evening presumably due to the accompanying sympathetic overactivity.", 
    "64": "The treatment of mild hypertension has been a subject of controversy because its benefits versus risks are not as well established as they are for moderate to severe hypertension. Results of several studies, however, now show that treatment reduces the frequency of stroke in those with milder blood pressure elevations. New guidelines published by the Joint National Committee recommend that treatment of mild hypertension begin with either a diuretic or a beta blocker. The effect on the most common complication of mild hypertension, that is, coronary heart disease (myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death), has, however, not been encouraging in studies in which diuretics have been used as first-line treatment. Two large-scale primary preventive studies compared the efficacy of diuretics and beta blockers in reducing coronary heart disease in hypertensive patients; results were in favor of beta blocker regimens in men. So far there is some evidence, but no hard scientific proof, that certain beta blockers offer advantages over diuretics in preventing myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death in hypertensive patients. A major concern with the use of diuretics is the risk of hypokalemia; this can be reduced when they are combined with beta blockers.", 
    "65": "The effects of bucumolol (BUC), nadolol (NAD) and nifenalol (NIF) on contractile forces and on action potentials (APs) were investigated in isolated guinea pig atrial and papillary muscles, respectively. Log 1/ED40 values for the negative inotropic effects of these drugs were 0.097, 10 and 0.74 mmol/l in this order. BUC (50 mumol/l), NAD (0.5 mmol/l) and NIF (0.2 mmol/l) produced about 60, 20 and 20% reduction of Vmax at 1 Hz. The frequency-dependent reductions at these and higher concentrations were greatest for BUC, intermediate for NAD and least for NIF. These potencies at certain frequencies were, as a whole, consistent with log P-potency relationship established in our previous papers (Harada et al. 1981; Ban et al. 1985). The reductions of Vmax in APs in response to premature stimuli during basic stimuli at the rate of 0.25 or 0.027 Hz decayed exponentially during diastolic intervals (DI). The time constants of these decay process (tau) estimated by linear and nonlinear regression analyses and by eye were 12.2-9.6 s for BUC (50-100 mumol/l) and 2.9-4.8 s for NAD (1-2 mmol/l) and 57-87 ms for NIF (0.2-1 mmol/l). In terms of the molecular weight (MW)-log tau relationship (Ban et al. 1985), these tau values are within the 95% fiducial limit for BUC and NAD and deviated from the lower fiducial limit for NIF. The frequency-dependent reductions of Vmax by these drugs were explained in terms of a function of tau and the intercept Ao.

    "66": "Under in vitro conditions, 3H-betaxolol was accumulated in rat atrial slices, reaching a tissue-medium ratio of 12.3 +/- 1.8 ml/g. This process was temperature-dependent, but ouabain-resistant. 3H-Betaxolol accumulated in atrial slices was subsequently released by electrical stimulation. The electrically-evoked release of 3H-betaxolol was abolished in the absence of calcium, and reduced in the presence of bretylium 10 microM. After surgical sympathetic denervation by stellate ganglionectomy there was a marked reduction in the endogenous content of noradrenaline and in the retention of 3H-noradrenaline in atrial slices. The concomitant decrease in the amount of 3H-noradrenaline released by electrical stimulation following denervation was modest, although statistically significant. Following sympathetic denervation, the tissue retention of 3H-betaxolol was not significantly affected, but the release of 3H-betaxolol by electrical stimulation was considerably reduced. After pretreatment with reserpine the amount of radioactivity released by electrical stimulation from slices labelled with 3H-betaxolol or 3H-noradrenaline was markedly reduced. The tissue retention of 3H-noradrenaline was reduced to a larger extent than that of 3H-betaxolol following the administration of reserpine. The simultaneous release of noradrenaline and betaxolol by nerve stimulation observed under our experimental conditions may represent a mechanism through which betaxolol can reach selectively the postsynaptic beta 1-adrenoceptors and reinforce beta-adrenoceptor blockade in the heart.", 
    "67": "The effect of long-term treatment with propranolol (45 patients), trasicor (15), visken (23) and combinations thereof with phentolamine and labetalol (12) on submaximum exercise tolerance was studied in patients with second-stage essential hypertension. Beta-adrenoblockers had no effect on total systemic oxygen consumption, but reduced significantly its myocardial consumption and brought down systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure at rest and during exercise. Differences were demonstrated in the hemodynamic mechanism of the decline in resting arterial pressure: under the effect of propranolol and trasicor, peripheral resistance increased insufficiently in response to a fall of the cardiac index; visken and labetalol depressed peripheral resistance without affecting the cardiac index. During exercise, all 4 beta-adrenoblockers reduced the cardiac index, mainly at the expense of a smaller pulse rate. An additional hypotensive effect of phentolamine that owes to reduced peripheral resistance was demonstrated.", 
    "68": "Thirty-nine patients with second-stage essential hypertension were treated with Beta-adrenoblockers of different classes for 2.5 to 3 years. Two groups of patients were distinguished: 23 patients showing a regression of left-ventricular myocardial weight (group 1) and 16 patients without such developments (group 2). A significant decrease in arterial blood pressure (by 20-24%) and heart rate (by 15 to 18%) was recorded in both groups. Total peripheral resistance was changed insignificantly in group 1 and by 9.7% (p less than 0.05) in group 2. The end diastolic volume decreased by 5.4% (p less than 0.05) in group 1, and increased by 4.7% (p less than 0.05) in group 2. The end systolic volume decreased by 10.6% (p less than 0.05) in group 1 and increased by 5% (p greater than 0.1) in group 2. Myocardial contractility declined significantly in both groups (by 9.5% and 10.6%, respectively). Intramyocardial tension dropped by 13-20% (p less than 0.001) in both groups. Therefore, the regression of left-ventricular myocardial hypertrophy was shown to have a favorable effect on cardiac function.", 
    "69": "The effect of labetalol (alpha- and beta- adrenoceptor blocking agent) on the respiratory organs of guinea pig was investigated in vivo and in vitro. The asthmatic symptoms which were induced by inhalation of histamine were relieved by pretreatment with labetalol (1-5 mg/kg, i.p.) in most cases. Propranolol, on the contrary, aggravated distinctly the histamine-induced asthma, although phentolamine and diphenhydramine relieved the asthma. Experiments carried out in vitro showed that labetalol relaxed the tonus of isolated tracheal preparation, shifting the histamine dose-response curve to the right and downward. The down shifting by labetalol was dose-dependent and much more sensitive than that by papaverine, and it disappeared after pretreatment of propranolol. Thus, it was considered that labetalol exerted a relaxing action on the tracheal preparation by a beta 2-adrenoceptor partial agonist action (intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, ISA). Since labetalol in high concentration also shifted the histamine dose-response curve parallel to the right as seen with phentolamine or diphenhydramine, it was considered that labetalol exerted not only an alpha-blocking action but also an antihistaminic action.", 
    "70": "The pharmacokinetics of two beta adrenoceptor blocking drugs, exaprolol and propranolol, in rats with interrupted enterohepatic circulation was studied. The tritium-labelled drugs were given intravenously to four groups of rats: control, bile-duct cannulated, bile-duct ligated, and pretreated with neomycin. Plasma levels and excretion were observed up to 96 h after administration. The pharmacokinetic parameters show an enhanced plasma elimination of both drugs at interrupted enterohepatic circulation compared to the control group. Significant changes were observed in the excretion pattern with bile-duct cannulated and bile-duct ligated rats, while the total radioactivity excreted in urine and faeces does not differ between control and neomycin pretreated rats.", 
    "71": "The authors report the electrophysiological study of severe catecholaminergic double tachycardia in a young athletic subject with an apparently healthy heart. The literature is reviewed and the mechanisms of double tachycardia are discussed, together with the role of the sympathetic nervous system and the therapeutic implications.", 
    "72": "Bevantolol hydrochloride, a beta adrenoceptor antagonist, can be categorized using conventional schemes as being cardioselective, devoid of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and having weak membrane-stabilizing and local anesthetic properties. The cardioselectivity of bevantolol was conferred by the incorporation of a 3,4-dimethoxyphenyl moiety into the terminal amino portion of the molecule. This portion of the molecule also appears to account for bevantolol's in vitro binding affinity at alpha-adrenoceptor sites; the in vivo significance of which remains unclear. In the various cardiovascular disease-state models, bevantolol's profile differed from that of propranolol, i.e., there was no initial pressor response in spontaneously hypertensive or renal hypertensive rats. In a myocardial ischemia model, bevantolol, unlike propranolol, increased contractile function in the ischemic myocardium. A ring hydroxylated urinary metabolite, which occurred only in trace amounts in human urine, had an interesting profile when studied in animals at pharmacologic doses. It ranked high in cardioselectivity (like bevantolol), but unlike bevantolol showed significant intrinsic beta sympathomimetic activity. The clinical significance of this metabolite, if any, remains to be established. Collectively the preclinical profile of bevantolol showed it to have an interesting profile for a beta adrenoceptor antagonist in a variety of pharmacologic test systems.", 
    "73": "Double-blind and long-term open-label studies have demonstrated a remarkably favorable safety profile for bevantolol. The drug was associated with a low incidence of adverse experiences similar to that observed with placebo. The adverse experiences were mostly mild to moderate and of the types found previously for other beta-blocking drugs. Very few patients withdrew from clinical studies because of adverse effects. Some patients continued on study for over four years. Bevantolol offers safe beta-blocking activity for the long-term treatment of angina and hypertension.", 
    "74": "Two multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies were conducted to determine in patients with hypertension the oral dose of bevantolol that would effectively reduce home diastolic blood pressure to less than 95 mm Hg. The two studies differed only in once-daily or twice-daily dose administration. In the 125 patients evaluated, the mean decreases in home diastolic blood pressure were significantly greater in patients receiving 100 to 400 mg/day of bevantolol (8 to 10 mm Hg) than in patients receiving placebo (2 to 3mm Hg) (p less than 0.05). Bevantolol administered once daily or twice daily was equally effective in the management of hypertension and was well tolerated in the doses studied.", 
    "75": "This multicenter study, conducted to determine the antihypertensive efficacy of bevantolol at different fixed doses compared with placebo was carried out at four separate institutions using a common protocol. One hundred thirty-nine patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension were enrolled. At doses of 200 to 400 mg/day bevantolol was clearly effective in lowering diastolic blood pressure and in maintaining this effect over the eight weeks of this double-blind study. Twice a day dosing is indicated since efficacy was evident 12 hours post-dosing. Bevantolol was well tolerated.", 
    "76": "The antianginal efficacy and safety of bevantolol was compared with placebo in 107 patients with angina pectoris of effort. The median frequency of angina attacks in these patients was 6 per week. Following a 6-week placebo-baseline phase, the patients were randomly assigned to groups receiving either 150 or 300 mg/day bevantolol (75 or 150 mg b.i.d.) or placebo for 6 weeks of double-blind treatment. During exercise tolerance testing at 2 hours postdose, the higher dose of bevantolol produced a marked increase in total work performed. Double product (HR X Systolic BP) at maximum common work load decreased significantly (p less than 0.001) in both bevantolol groups compared with the placebo group. In patients receiving 300 mg/day bevantolol, the proportion who stopped exercising because of angina or S-T depression decreased from 97% to 65%; the frequency of angina attacks decreased by one-half or more in 77% of those with 3 or more attacks per week; and 90% had an improvement in capacity to perform usual daily and occupational activities. A significant therapeutic effect was still present 12 hours postdose. Bevantolol was safe; fewer adverse reactions occurred in either drug group than in the placebo group. Bevantolol appeared to be an effective, well-tolerated drug in the management of angina pectoris.", 
    "77": "Bevantolol (the hydrochloride salt) has pharmacokinetic properties that are clinically advantageous. Bevantolol is well absorbed orally (greater than 70%); and the systemic bioavailability is 60%. Peak plasma concentrations are achieved 1 to 2 hours following an oral dose. Elimination is first-order with an average elimination half-life of 1.5 hours. Bevantolol exhibits linear pharmacokinetics within the therapeutic range (100 to 400 mg) with no change in half-life with chronic dosing. These properties result in predictable plasma levels and predictable drug response.", 
    "78": "Beta-blocker usage in the United Kingdom centers around propranolol and oxprenolol as noncardioselective drugs, atenolol and metoprolol as cardioselective agents, and pindolol or oxprenolol when partial agonist activity is desired. Any meaningful comparison of a novel beta blocker against the established drugs must be a variable-dose trial, for the optimum dose of any beta blocker that can be tolerated varies widely. Effective beta blockade is considered to have been achieved when the standing heart rate has been lowered to about 55 beats/minute.", 
    "79": "During the past decade, beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agents have proved to be valuable assets in our therapeutic armamentarium for management of both angina pectoris and essential hypertension. In ischemic heart disease, these agents reduce myocardial oxygen requirements by decreasing the force of myocardial contraction and by reducing heart rate. Consequently, decreased blood supply to portions of the myocardium is tolerated better. The beta-blockers are effective in reducing the frequency and severity of episodes of angina pectoris and in extending exercise tolerance. If needed, additional benefit may be gained by adding long-acting nitrates, or calcium-channel blockers or both."
