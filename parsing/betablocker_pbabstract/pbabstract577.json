    "0": "Stable angina is the most common form of presentation of ischemic heart disease, being more common in women (65%) than men (37%), while the reverse is true for the prevalence, being present in about 3.5% of men over 55 as opposed to 1.5% of women. The overall 10 year survival for individuals with stable angina at a mean age of 60 years is 58% for men and 68% for women. Prognosis is related to several factors: age, sex, the number of coronary vessels involved, collateral flow, ventricular function, and the extent of myocardium at risk. It is estimated that stable angina of recent onset is associated with single-vessel disease in about 40% of cases. Angina is a clinical diagnosis but, if doubt exists, one should exclude coronary atherosclerosis or spasm by cardiac catheterization and not rely on noninvasive techniques. Therapy for unstable angina or acute infarction receives considerable attention and is reasonably well defined, but such is not the case for stable angina. Conventionally, it consists of secondary prevention and prescription of nitrates, calcium blockers, or beta-blockers. There are several problems: No studies have been performed to assess efficacy in reducing the development of unstable angina. The group of drugs most appropriate for first-line therapy has not been identified. It has not been determined if nitrate tolerance is a major problem. The effect of beta-blockers on prognosis in patients with unstable angina has not been defined. A noninvasive means of identifying high and low risk patients with unstable angina has not been developed.", 
    "1": "Beta-Adrenergic blockers have not been widely used in patients with peripheral vascular disease because these drugs have been reported to worsen the symptoms of intermittent claudication. To test this assumption we studied the effects of a beta 1-selective and a nonselective beta-adrenergic blocker on postexercise calf blood flow and symptoms of claudication in 19 patients with mild-to-moderate peripheral vascular disease. Subjects received placebo for 3 weeks, and then were randomized to 120 mg/day propranolol or 150 mg/day metoprolol with the use of a crossover design. Blood flow in the calf was measured by strain-gauge plethysmography at rest and immediately after exercise on a bicycle ergometer at a low and a high workload. The symptoms of claudication were monitored during bicycle exercise and by patient diaries maintained between visits. Maximal exercise heart rate was reduced an equivalent amount by metoprolol (19 beats/min) and propranolol (16 beats/min). Mean arterial pressure was reduced by propranolol at rest and by both drugs with exercise. Calf blood flow was not affected by either drug compared with placebo at rest or at either workload. In addition, the symptoms of claudication were not worsened by either drug. We conclude that despite evidence of beta 1-adrenergic blockade and a lowering of arterial pressure, neither beta-adrenergic blocker adversely affected the peripheral circulation.", 
    "2": "Elements of three neurotransmitter systems were investigated in morphologically undifferentiated human Y-79 retinoblastoma cells in suspension culture. Specific gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) uptake, GABA binding, and glycine binding were absent from these cells, although the cells had been shown to exhibit an active uptake and release of [3H]glycine. Binding and competition studies using both alpha- and beta-adrenergic ligands indicated the presence of a beta-adrenergic receptor. This finding was confirmed by treatment of the cells with beta-agonists in competition with a beta-antagonist and with an alpha-antagonist; the level of cyclic AMP was competitively stimulated. Therefore, human Y-79 cells in suspension culture contain beta-adrenergic receptors, and not glycinergic or GABAergic ones. Thus, the Y-79 cells may be of use in studying the factors involved in developmental regulation of neurotransmitter function.", 
    "3": "Incubation of human mononuclear leukocytes (MLN) with isoproterenol rapidly desensitizes beta-adrenergic receptors, i.e. isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP accumulation decreases. This desensitization is accompanied by a redistribution of the receptor into a cellular environment to which hydrophilic compounds have limited access. We found that the total number of beta-receptors [defined as binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol (DHA) inhibited by 1 microM propranolol] was unchanged in the desensitized MNL. In control MNL, virtually all DHA binding was inhibited by 1 microM CGP-12177, suggesting that all of these receptors are on the cell surface, whereas in desensitized cells, only 33 +/- 2% (mean +/- SEM) of the DHA binding was inhibited by CGP-12177. We quantitated the sequestered receptors by subtracting the number of surface receptors from the total number of receptors. The sequestered receptors were homogeneous, with an affinity for DHA identical to that of surface receptors (Kd, 0.66 +/- 0.12 vs. 0.62 +/- 0.08 nM). The time courses of desensitization and sequestration were identical. The functional status of the sequestered receptors was assessed using the agonist zinterol, which (unlike catecholamines) is quite hydrophobic. Zinterol competed for DHA binding to both sequestered and surface receptors, whereas isoproterenol only competed for binding to the surface receptors. However, cAMP accumulation in desensitized MNL was reduced to the same extent regardless of whether isoproterenol or zinterol was used as the agonist. These results demonstrate that desensitization of intact cells to beta-agonists cannot be attributed to limited accessibility of the sequestered receptors to catecholamines, but, rather, that the sequestered receptors are not functionally coupled to adenylate cyclase.", 
    "4": "The effects of acute stimulation of the sympathetic activity by dynamic exercise on lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptor density [assessed by (-)-125iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) binding] and responsiveness [10 mumol/l isoprenaline-induced cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) increases] were studied in 10 normotensive (Pdiast < 90 mmHg) volunteers and in 10 patients with established essential hypertension (Pdiast > 95 mmHg). In normotensives, dynamic exercise on a bicycle (80% of maximum heart rate) for 15 min led to an increase in lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptor density from 1080 +/- 77 to 2033 +/- 152 ICYP binding sites/cell; concomitantly isoprenaline-induced increase in lymphocyte cAMP was enhanced. This effect appears to be mediated by beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation, since the exercise-induced increase in beta 2-adrenoceptor density was markedly attenuated by pretreatment of the volunteers with propranolol (5 mg intravenously 45 min before exercise), but not by pretreatment with the beta 1-selective antagonist bisoprolol (2.5 mg intravenously 30 min before exercise). In patients with essential hypertension, lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptor density (1512 +/- 101 ICYP binding sites/cell) was significantly higher than in controls (P < 0.05); the same held true for isoprenaline-induced cAMP increases. In these patients, however, dynamic exercise caused only a slight increase in lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptor density (to 1859 +/- 154 ICYP binding sites/cell) and in isoprenaline-induced cAMP increases. From these results it is concluded that in essential hypertension acute regulation of the beta-adrenoceptor/adenylate cyclase system is impaired.", 
    "5": "The International Prospective Primary Prevention Study in Hypertension (IPPPSH) was a long-term clinical trial designed to examine the effects of treatment on hypertension. It shows that in a population who at entry to the study had diastolic blood pressures of 100-125 mmHg, failure to achieve blood pressure control increases the risk of sudden death and myocardial infarction as well as stroke in both sexes and emphasizes the need to control blood pressure on a long-term basis. The absolute cardiac risk reduction associated with pressure control is greater for men than women below achieved diastolic pressures of 101-105 mmHg.", 
    "6": "In a group of 15 men with severe hypertension in a double-blind crossover trial, the new calcium antagonist felodipine has been shown to lower blood pressure as effectively as minoxidil when used in combination with a beta-blocker and a loop diuretic. Felodipine was well tolerated and may have a role in the management of severe hypertension.", 
    "7": "We examined possible predictors of the recurrence of high blood pressure (BP) in patients who remained normotensive after withdrawal of drug therapy. Thirty untreated male patients with WHO stage I essential hypertension (mean age 43 +/- 6 years) were randomly allocated to oxprenolol or nitrendipine groups. Before therapy, BP at rest, during mental arithmetic (MA) and during the cold pressor (CP) test was assessed. After 6 months of effective monotherapy, all drugs were withdrawn and casual BP was followed up for 5 months. Two weeks after cessation of therapy 26% were hypertensive again, after 4 weeks 28%, after 12 weeks 48% and after 21 weeks 74%. The two therapeutic groups did not differ in their BP increase after discontinuation of therapy. Predictors for the return of high BP were age, pretreatment BP, systolic and diastolic BP increase to the CP test. Analyses of covariance for age and pretreatment BP confirmed that reactivity to the CP test was a predictor of the return of hypertension.", 
    "8": "Since there is concern that the potentially useful antihypertensive combination of verapamil and propranolol might lead to adverse cardiovascular responses, we have investigated its effects, not only on blood pressure, but also on electrocardiographic and echocardiographic variables. Fourteen hypertensive patients participated in a double-blind, randomized, crossover comparison of verapamil 360 mg, propranolol 240 mg, verapamil 360 mg + propranolol 240 mg, and placebo, each given for 4 weeks. The antihypertensive effect of verapamil + propranolol was greater than that of either drug alone. Pulse rate was reduced by propranolol but not verapamil. However, addition of verapamil to propranolol led to further reduction in pulse rate. The PR interval was prolonged by verapamil + propranolol when compared with all other treatments. The active drugs increased ventricular dimensions and the effect of the combination was statistically significant. Thus, verapamil + propranolol is an effective antihypertensive combination, but heart rate, atrio-ventricular conduction and left ventricular function may be affected adversely, necessitating careful monitoring of therapy.", 
    "9": "Eleven patients, mean age 45 years, with previously untreated hypertension (WHO stage I) were treated over 16 months with pindolol in dosages of 5-30 mg/day. The effects on blood pressure and peripheral vascular resistance (PR) were studied before and after 2 and 16 months of treatment. Recordings were performed at rest, and after maximal vasodilatation obtained by ischaemic work to exhaustion with a hand-ergometer. Blood pressure was significantly reduced after both 2 and 16 months of treatment (P < 0.001). During treatment small reductions in heart rate were seen at rest but not after maximal vasodilatation (P < 0.02 and NS, respectively). At rest there was a great variability and no significant changes in PR. Peripheral vascular resistance after maximal vasodilatation was significantly reduced after both 2 and 16 months of treatment (P < 0.005 and P < 0.01, respectively). We conclude that long-term treatment with pindolol may give a regression of structural vascular changes.", 
    "10": "Comparative haemodynamic investigations with carvedilol and verapamil were carried out on conscious, instrumented dogs. Arterial blood pressure, right atrial pressure (RAP), cardiac output (CO), heart rate, stroke volume and total peripheral resistance (TPR) were determined after intravenous (i.v.) injection of incremental doses (0.01-3 mg/kg) of the drugs. Carvedilol reduced the blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner, concomitant with a reduction in TPR. The RAP and the CO were not affected, indicating that arterial vasodilatation was induced by carvedilol. Verapamil showed a decrease in the blood pressure with a reduction of CO and SV. Moreover, at high doses the RAP was increased, indicating a reduction of the cardiac performance. Thus, in our experimental model remarkable differences between the haemodynamic effects of i.v. injections of carvedilol and verapamil have been observed, whereas after oral administration blood pressure also decreases after verapamil due to a reduction of TPR.", 
    "11": "Acute hypotensive effects and the mechanisms of three beta-adrenergic blocking drugs with alpha-blocking activity were studied in comparison with those of prazosin, propranolol and hydralazine in the conscious spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). Prazosin lowered the blood pressure dose-dependently and inhibited the pressor response to phenylephrine. Three beta-adrenergic blocking drugs with alpha-blocking activity, labetalol (30 mg/kg), arotinolol (100 mg/kg) and nipradilol (100 mg/kg) also lowered the blood pressure to the same extent as prazosin (0.3 mg/kg), but the inhibition of the pressor response to phenylephrine produced by them was disproportionately slight. Propranolol (100 mg/kg) did not lower the blood pressure. These results suggest that the acute hypotensive effects of three beta-adrenergic blocking drugs with alpha-blocking activity were attributable only partially to the alpha-adrenergic blocking effect; a mechanism or mechanisms other than the alpha-adrenergic blocking effect must be invoked to explain the acute hypotensive effect produced by lower doses of these drugs in the conscious SHR.", 
    "12": "In pithed rats two recently-introduced beta-blockers, nipradilol and arotinolol, as well as labetalol shifted the pressor dose-response curve for phenylephrine to the right. Labetalol and arotinolol did not modify the pressor dose-response curve for clonidine, while nipradilol induced a definite rightward shift. These results indicate that labetalol and arotinolol are selective alpha 1-blockers, while nipradilol is a non-selective one. In addition, all the three beta-blockers produced complex changes in the blood pressure in pithed rats. A fall of the diastolic blood pressure induced by labetalol and nipradilol was preceded by a slight rise, while arotinolol produced a fall at lower doses and a rise at higher ones. The hypotension by labetalol was abolished after propranolol, while the hypertension was suppressed by prazosin, indicating that labetalol has an intrinsic beta- and alpha 1-sympathomimetic effect. The hypertension and the hypotension produced by nipradilol and arotinolol persisted even in the presence of propranolol and prazosin or propranolol and yohimbine.", 
    "13": "The peptic glands, which are located in the mucosa of the distal esophagus in the frog, respond to multiple stimuli. In vitro studies were performed, using mucosal sheets of the esophagus of Rana catesbeiana, during the summer months when the glands are fully responsive to determine whether the receptors for the stimuli [cholinergic, beta-adrenergic, and peptidergic (bombesin but not cholecystokinin)] are specific to the stimuli. Through the use of three classes of antagonist, we found that 1) atropine defined the muscarinic nature of the bethanechol stimulation, 2) propranolol defined the beta-adrenergic nature of stimulation by isoproterenol, and 3) the substance P analogue [D-Arg1,D-Pro2,D-Trp7,9,Leu11]substance P was specific for the peptide bombesin. No cross-inhibition was seen, and dibutyryl cGMP did not inhibit any of the three stimuli. Moreover, any two of the three stimuli in combination stimulated more pepsinogen than either alone but the same as the sum of the two individual responses. Both lines of evidence indicate that there are at least three independent receptor pathways for stimulation of pepsinogen secretion in these glands.", 
    "14": "In guinea-pig isolated trachealis isoprenaline (0.001-0.1 mumol l-1) caused concentration-dependent relaxation. Propranolol (1 mumol l-1) antagonized the effects of isoprenaline by more than 100 fold but did not modify the relaxant action of sodium nitrite. The tracheal relaxant actions of isoprenaline and ATP were unaffected by apamin (0.1 mumol l-1) but apamin profoundly antagonized the effects of noradrenaline and ATP on guinea-pig isolated taenia caeci. Tetraethylammonium (TEA; 8 mmol l-1) and procaine (5 mmol l-1) each evoked tracheal spasm but neither agent antagonized the isoprenaline-evoked relaxation of the trachealis. Trachealis exposed to K+-rich (120 mmol l-1) Krebs solution developed near-maximal tension. Both isoprenaline and sodium nitrite relaxed the K+-depolarized tissue though concentration-effect curves for both relaxants were moved to the right compared to those obtained in non-depolarized tissues. The maximal effect of sodium nitrite was markedly reduced. Intracellular electrophysiological recording showed that isoprenaline (0.01-1 mumol l-1) caused hyperpolarization and reduced or abolished slow wave discharge in trachealis muscle. These effects were accompanied by relaxation. Propranolol (1 mumol l-1) virtually abolished both the electrical and mechanical responses to isoprenaline (0.1 mumol l-1). Apamin (0.1 mumol l-1) did not alter the spontaneous electrical activity of trachealis cells or their electrical and mechanical responses to isoprenaline (0.1 mumol l-1). TEA (8 mmol l-1) caused depolarization and often increased slow wave amplitude and induced spike discharge. Isoprenaline (0.01 mumol l-1) failed to hyperpolarize TEA-treated trachealis cells. Higher concentrations of isoprenaline suppressed TEA-induced spasm, caused hyperpolarization and thereby increased slow wave or spike amplitude. Slow wave or spike frequency decreased as the hyperpolarization progressed but abolition of slow waves or spikes sometimes required more than 4 min exposure to isoprenaline. Procaine (5 mmol l-1) increased the amplitude of slow waves and induced spike discharge. Procaine markedly reduced the hyperpolarization induced by isoprenaline (0.1 and 1 mumol l-1) but had little effect on isoprenaline-induced relaxation. It is concluded that isoprenaline activates beta-adrenoceptors in guinea-pig trachealis and thereby evokes relaxation and hyperpolarization of the smooth muscle. The hyperpolarization does not involve the opening of apamin-sensitive K+-channels and it probably plays a supportive rather than a crucial role in the process by which isoprenaline-induced relaxation is achieved.", 
    "15": "Subtotal thyroid resection or hemithyroidectomy was performed for hyperthyroidism on two groups of patients: 84 treated before surgery with antithyroid drugs and thyroxin and 111 given only beta-blocking agents before surgery. These two patient groups were compared with reference to preoperative medication, operation, immediate postoperative course, and late results, with follow-up for 3 to 7 years. The advantages of beta-blockers compared with conventional antithyroid medication were lack of adverse reactions, rapid effect of treatment, considerably shortened preoperative treatment time, and fewer outpatient visits, with consequent financial benefit. No disadvantages of beta-blockers were found except that 18% of the patients required additional propranolol in the immediate postoperative period. There were no surgical complications in either group other than a mild persistent hypocalcemia in two patients from the beta-blocked group. The serum thyrotropin levels during the first 6 postoperative months were significantly higher in the patients treated with antithyroid drugs. The frequency of postoperative thyroid dysfunction showed no intergroup difference during the observation period. Signs of hypofunction, necessitating thyroxin supplementation, were observed in 28.6% of patients in the antithyroid drug/thyroxin group and in 25.7% in the beta-blocker group. Toxic recurrence occurred in 1.8% of the group that received beta-blockers and in 1.2% of the other patients. The study demonstrated that beta-adrenoceptor blockade is a safe method for preoperative treatment in hyperthyroidism, with advantages for patients and regarding costs.", 
    "16": "The usefulness of amperometric detection in pharmaceutical analyses was investigated for different groups of drugs. The UV response at 254 nm and that at the absorption maximum of the solute were compared with the electrochemical signal obtained. The minimum detectable concentration (nanograms on-column) of each substance is reported for the three different detection systems. This comparison was performed for 72 drugs (local anaesthetics, antipyretics, tricyclic antidepressants, sulphonamides, sex hormones, beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents, phenothiazines, alkaloids, diuretics and penicillins). The median limit of detection of the amperometric detector (see definition in the text) is 1.0 ng on-column and the median gain in sensitivity, compared with UV detection is 22.5.", 
    "17": "(-)[125I]Iodocyanopindolol ([125I]CYP) labels rat brain membrane sites which display high affinity for several serotonergic and beta-adrenergic compounds. The binding of [125I]CYP to these serotonergic recognition sites was evaluated in the presence of 30 microM (-)isoprenaline in order to suppress binding to beta-adrenoceptors. [125I]CYP binds in rat cortex membranes rapidly, reversibly and stereoselectively to a finite number of recognition sites: Bmax = 180 fmol/mg, KD = 230 pM. Similar affinity values of [125I]CYP were obtained in membranes from rat hippocampus and striatum. Kinetic, saturation and competition experiments suggest that under these conditions [125I]CYP binds to a single serotonergic recognition site named 5-HT1B. The pharmacological profile of 5-HT1B sites is characteristic of a 5-HT1 binding site and shows the following rank order of affinity for agonists: RU 24969, (5-methoxy-3-[1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridin-4-yl]1H-indole) greater than 5-CT, (5-carboxamidotryptamine) greater than 5-HT, (5-hydroxytryptamine, serotonin) greater than 5-OCH3-T, (5-methoxytryptamine) much greater than 2-CH3-5-HT, (2-methylserotonin) greater than 8-OH-DPAT, (8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-pro-pylamino)-tetralin). The rank order of affinity for antagonists is: (+/-)ICYP, ((+/- )-3-I-cyano-pindolol) greater than (-)21-009, (4-[3-ter-butyl-amino-2-hydroxy-propoxy]-indol-2-carbonic acid isopropyl ester) greater than (+)21-009 greater than (-)propranolol greater than metitepin greater than (-)pindolol much greater than ketanserin greater than spiroperidol greater than mesulergine. 5-HT1B recognition sites display low affinity for selective beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonists, e.g. atenolol, betaxolol, ICI 89-406 and ICI 118-551. The low affinity of 5-HT1B recognition sites for some 5-HT1A, 5-HT1C and 5-HT2 selective compounds (e.g. 8-OH-DPAT, mesulergine, ketanserin) suggests that 5-HT1B recognition sites are pharmacologically different from 5-HT1A, 5-HT1C and 5-HT2 recognition sites.", 
    "18": "The pharmacological characteristics of the binding of [3H]8-OH-DPAT ([3H]8-hydroxy-2(di-n-propylamino)tetralin, [125I]CYP ((-)[125I]iodocyanopindolol) (in the presence of 30 microM (-)isoprenaline) and [3H]mesulergine to 5-HT1 recognition sites were studied in rat and pig brain membranes. [3H]8-OH-DPAT bound in rat and pig cortex to the 5-HT1A recognition site characterized by high affinity for 5-CT (5-carboxamido-tryptamine), 8-OH-DPAT, 5-HT (5-hydroxytryptamine, serotonin) and low affinity for pirenperone, ketanserin and mesulergine. [125I]CYP bound in rat but not in pig cortex to the 5-HT1B site which shows high affinity for (-)21-009 (4[3-ter-butyl-amino-2-hydroxy-propoxy]indol-2-carbonic acid isopropyl ester), (+/-)ICYP (3-I-cyanopindolol), 5-HT, RU 24969 (5-methoxy-3-[1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridon-4-yl]1H-indole) and low affinity for 8-OH-DPAT, mesulergine and pirenperone. [3H]Mesulergine bound in pig choroid plexus and in rat cortex (besides binding to 5-HT2 sites in rat cortex) to the 5-HT1C recognition site characterized by high affinity for metergoline, mesulergine, 5-HT and methergine and low affinity for (-)21-009, ICYP, 8-OH-DPAT and spiroperidol. The pharmacological profile of 5-HT1A sites in rat and pig cortex appears to be identical; 5-HT1C sites in pig choroid plexus and rat cortex show no differences. In contrast, it was not possible to label 5-HT1B sites with [125I]CYP in pig brain membranes indicating that like 5-HT2 receptors, 5-HT1 recognition sites show species differences. The pharmacological profiles of the three 5-HT1 recognition sites are clearly different from one another. Furthermore, the pharmacological profile of each individual 5-HT1 recognition site is also different from that of the 5-HT2 receptors labelled with [3H]ketanserin in rat cortex membranes although some similarities exist between 5-HT2 and 5-HT1C sites. Finally, the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist (-)21-009 which has different affinities for 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B and 5-HT1C recognition sites, yielded triphasic competition curves for [3H]5-HT binding in rat cortex membranes providing evidence that [3H]5-HT labels three distinct 5-HT1 sites in these membranes.", 
    "19": "Effects of various sympathomimetic amines on the hepatic glucose mobilization were studied in anesthetized dogs. Phenylephrine (30, 100, 300 micrograms), isoproterenol (0.1, 1, 10 micrograms) and (-)-norepinephrine (0.5, 5, 50 micrograms) were injected into the common hepatic artery in three separate groups of dogs. Dose-dependent increases in hepatic venous glucose concentration were observed following the injections of these drugs. Aortic glucose concentration also increased significantly, but to a lesser extent as compared with that in hepatic venous blood. Peak responses were obtained 3 to 5 min after the drug administrations. The increases in hepatic venous glucose concentration induced by the injections of (-)-norepinephrine were significantly diminished to a similar extent in dogs treated with either phentolamine (2 mg/kg, i.v.) or (-)-propranolol (0.2 mg/kg, i.v.). The results indicate that in the dog liver in vivo, both hepatic alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors can be involved in the hepatic glycogenolysis. The glycogenolytic response to exogenously administered (-)-norepinephrine is mediated via alpha- as well as beta-adrenoceptors in the liver of anesthetized dogs.", 
    "20": "The radiolabeled agonist [3H]hydroxybenzylisoproterenol ([3H]HBI) and antagonist [125I]iodopindolol ([125I]IPIN) were used to investigate the properties of beta-adrenergic receptors on membranes prepared from L6 myoblasts and S49 lymphoma cells. The high affinity binding of (-)-[3H]HBI to membranes prepared from L6 myoblasts was stereoselectively inhibited by the active isomers of isoproterenol and propranolol. The density of receptors determined with (-)-[3H]HBI was less than that determined with [125I]IPIN. The binding of (-)-[3H]HBI was inhibited by guanine nucleotides, suggesting an agonist-mediated association of the receptor with a guanine nucleotide-binding protein, presumably the stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding protein (Ns) of adenylate cyclase. Results obtained in studies with membranes prepared from wild-type S49 lymphoma cells and the adenylate cyclase-deficient variant (cyc-) were similar to those obtained in experiments carried out with membranes prepared from L6 myoblasts. Thus, the high affinity binding of (-)-[3H]HBI to membranes prepared from wild-type and cyc- S49 lymphoma cells was stereoselectively inhibited by the active isomers of isoproterenol and propranolol, and was inhibited by GTP. Moreover, the density of sites determined with (-)-[3H]HBI was less than that determined with [125I]IPIN. These results suggest either that cyc- cells contain a partially functional Ns, or alternatively, that the inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding protein (Ni) is capable of interacting with beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "21": "During the recruitment phase of the MIAMI trial (December 1982 to March 1984), data on 26,439 patients eligible for inclusion were entered. Of these, 5,778 patients were included. Current treatment with either beta blockers or calcium-channel blockers (51%) was the most predominant reason for exclusion. The randomized and excluded patients differed. The randomized patients were younger and more often men. The mean age of the patients was 59 years in both the placebo and the metoprolol groups. The 2 groups were evenly balanced with regard to basic demographic variables. The median delay between onset of symptoms and randomization was 7 hours, and 25% of the patients were included within 4 hours. Previous clinical history and pharmacologic treatment given before admission were well balanced in the groups. Mean heart rate for the 2 groups before randomization was 83 beats/min and systolic blood pressure was 141 mm Hg. Approximately 15% of randomized patients presented with pulmonary rales. Before randomization 20% of the patients had normal electrocardiograms; 70% could be classified as having electrocardiographic signs of acute myocardial infarction; and 10% presented with other electrocardiographic abnormalities. Electrocardiographic signs at entry suggested a predominance of anterior wall infarctions. The randomized patients were not representative of eligible patients and the treatment groups were well balanced at entry.", 
    "22": "The central hemodynamic effects of metoprolol in acute myocardial infarction have been studied in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial. One hundred and ninety patients with acute myocardial infarction not previously on beta blockers with heart rate greater than 65 beats/min and blood pressure greater than 105 mm Hg and without clinical signs of serious heart failure were included. After insertion of a pulmonary artery catheter, patients were randomized to metoprolol, 15 mg intravenously, and 50 mg 4 times a day orally (n = 95) or placebo (n = 95) with a mean delay of 7.2 hours. Hemodynamic measurements were made at baseline and repeatedly during 24 hours. Heart rate, systolic blood pressure and cardiac index were all immediately reduced by 10 to 20% in the metoprolol group and the difference compared with placebo was maintained throughout the 24 hours (p less than 0.001). Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) in the metoprolol group increased from 13.7 +/- 6.7 to a peak of 15.5 +/- 5.5 mm Hg 30 minutes after injection. The difference compared with placebo was maintained for 8 hours (p less than 0.01). This increase was seen only in the patient group with initial PCWP below the median of 13 mm Hg. In patients with initial PCWP above the median a continuous decrease was observed in both the placebo and metoprolol groups. Thus high initial PCWP was not associated with intolerance to metoprolol. Based on hemodynamic measurements tolerance to metoprolol was good.", 
    "23": "Fifteen minutes after injection there was a fall in mean heart rate (18%, p less than 0.001), systolic blood pressure (10%, p less than 0.001) and rate-pressure product (27%, p less than 0.0001) in the metoprolol group of patients in the MIAMI trial. Hypotension and bradycardia not necessarily associated with withdrawal of drug were more common in the metoprolol group (p less than 0.001). Atrioventricular block I was more common in the metoprolol group (p less than 0.03), whereas no such difference was observed for atrioventricular block II and III, asystole or pacemaker implantations. Left ventricular failure was observed no more often in the metoprolol group. The occurrence of cardiogenic shock also did not differ between the groups. Cardiac glycosides were used more in the placebo group, but diuretic and furosemide usage did not differ. For all patients mean furosemide doses and number of diuretic injections were similar in both treatment groups. Atropine (4.1 vs 6.4%) and sympathomimetic (3.2 vs 4.6%) agents were used more often in the metoprolol group during days 0 to 5 (p less than 0.05). The trial medication was withdrawn temporarily more often in the metoprolol than in the placebo group (p less than 0.001). However, permanent withdrawal of trial medication occurred with a similar frequency overall in both groups. More patients were withdrawn from the study because of cardiovascular reasons in the metoprolol group (9%) than in the placebo group (5%, p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "24": "Forty-five patients in the placebo (1.5%) and 29 in the metoprolol (1%) groups, respectively, were receiving antiarrhythmic drugs on a long-term basis before entry into the trial. Before randomization, 2.2% (n = 64) of the placebo and 1.7% (n = 50) of the metoprolol patients developed ventricular fibrillation (VF) in the hospital. The corresponding figures for atrial fibrillation or flutter were 3% (n = 87) and 3.3% (n = 94). After randomization, there was no significant difference in the number of patients who developed VF in the placebo (n = 52) and the metoprolol (n = 48) groups. The total number of episodes of VF tended to be fewer in the metoprolol group (n = 67) compared with the placebo group (n = 96). The tendency was, however, not apparent until after 5 days. When the occurrence of VF was related to high- and low-mortality risk groups, any beneficial effect of metoprolol was confined mainly to the high-risk group. A similar proportion of patients underwent electric conversion for ventricular tachyarrhythmia in the 2 groups. Although antiarrhythmic drugs were intended to be given only for major ventricular tachyarrhythmias a large proportion of patients received such treatment. Significantly more patients were treated with antiarrhythmics in the placebo (21.5%) than in the metoprolol group (19.2%, p = 0.03) during the study period, but predominantly during the first 5 days. Atrial fibrillation or flutter and other supraventricular tachyarrhythmias were significantly less frequent in the metoprolol than in the placebo group, as was the use of cardiac glycosides.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The s-ASAT activity was corrected for the normal range from each center. The median s-ASAT activity was 4.9 arbitrary units in the placebo group versus 4.6 arbitrary units in the metoprolol group (p = 0.072). Univariate analyses indicated that the delay time between onset of symptoms and randomization and sympathetic activity at entry significantly influenced the effect of metoprolol. A similar decrease in serum enzyme activity after metoprolol treatment was observed independent of signs of infarct localization on the entry electrocardiogram.", 
    "26": "The effect of metoprolol on the development of an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) during days 0 to 3 and on late first and recurrent infarctions during days 4 to 15 has been investigated. Signs on electrocardiogram (ECG) were well balanced between the treatment groups at entry; 70% of patients had signs of suspected AMI and 19% of patients had normal ECGs. The remaining patients had abnormal ECGs but actual infarction could not be localized. The localization of suspected AMI was equivalently distributed in the 2 groups before randomization. Metoprolol altered the distribution of patients diagnosed during days 0 to 3 as having definite, possible or no AMI (p less than 0.02). In the placebo group, there were more patients with definite AMI (72.5% vs 70.5%) and less with possible AMI (5.6% vs 7.4) than in the metoprolol group. A larger proportion of patients developed a Q-wave infarction during days 0 to 3 in the placebo group (53.9%) compared with the metoprolol group (50.9%, p = 0.024). No difference in the effect of metoprolol regarding localization of the early AMI was observed. Late first myocardial infarction development (days 4 to 15) was observed in 20 patients (0.7%) in each group. Recurrent myocardial infarction tended to develop more frequently during days 4 to 15 in the placebo group compared with the metoprolol group (3.9% vs 3.0%, p = 0.08).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "27": "After 15 days there were 142 deaths in the placebo group (4.9%) and 123 deaths in the metoprolol group (4.3%), a difference of 13% (p = 0.29). The 95% confidence limits for the relative effect of metoprolol ranged from an 8% excess (-8%) to a 33% reduction (+33%) in mortality. There was generally a lower mortality rate for metoprolol-treated patients in most subgroups and a consistent tendency for a more pronounced difference between the treatment groups in those subgroups with a placebo mortality rate higher than the average for all placebo patients. Most deaths were cardiac and occurred among patients who developed a definite myocardial infarction (97%) and most of these had a Q-wave infarction (83%). Using a simple model, the placebo mortality was found to increase with increasing number of 8 risk predictors defined from prestudy experience, from 0% in patients with no risk predictors to 11.6% in patients with any 5 or more of these risk factors. Similarly, there was an increase in the difference between the treatment groups in favor of metoprolol with increasing number of placebo risk factors. Metoprolol had no apparent effect in a low-mortality risk group (less than or equal to 2 risk factors), but there was a difference in mortality of 29% in favor of metoprolol in a high-risk group (greater than or equal to 3 risk factors) comprising one-third of the trial population.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Fewer metoprolol-treated patients in the MIAMI trial were given narcotic analgesics (49% of the placebo patients vs 44% of the metoprolol patients, p less than 0.001), nitrates (55% vs 53%, p = 0.10) and calcium-channel blockers (12% vs 9%, p less than 0.001). A total number of 6,697 dose equivalents of narcotic analgesics were given to the placebo group compared with 5,493 dose equivalents to the metoprolol group, a difference of 18% (p less than 0.001). Mean dose equivalents were 2.3 and 1.9, respectively. The analysis of the total use of the 3 types of treatment for ischemic chest pain showed a significantly less frequent use of treatment for chest pain in the metoprolol group than in the placebo group (p less than 0.004). The relative difference in the incidence of drug treatment tended to be more striking for patients with maximal therapy, i.e., receiving high doses of narcotic analgesics, nitrates and calcium-channel blockers. There were 22% fewer patients receiving 4 or more doses of narcotic analgesics in the metoprolol group than in the placebo group. A multivariate analysis disclosed that site of suspected infarction, delay time, entry systolic blood pressure and metoprolol treatment all had a significant effect on the use of narcotic analgesics. There was a nonsignificant tendency for heart rate to be of importance. In the placebo group the use of narcotic analgesics increased with decreasing delay time and increasing systolic blood pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "29": "The effects of early intervention with metoprolol in patients with suspected or definite acute myocardial infarction (AMI) have been assessed in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled international study. Patients aged 75 years or younger were eligible for entry if they presented to a coronary care unit within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms of an AMI. Exclusion criteria included current treatment with a beta blocker or calcium-channel blocker, heart rate less than or equal to 65 beats/min, systolic blood pressure less than or equal to 105 mm Hg, contraindications and other administrative reasons. Treatment began with an intravenous loading dose (3 X 5 mg injections of metoprolol or placebo at 2-minute intervals) followed by an oral regime of 200-mg metoprolol daily or placebo. The study period was 15 days in addition to the day of randomization. The patients' clinical history and status at entry were documented. The following outcome variables were recorded: mortality, development of AMI, serum enzyme activity, electrocardiographic signs of AMI, late or recurrent AMI, arrhythmias, treatment of chest pain, concomitant treatment, adverse events and details of treatment with trial medication.", 
    "30": "To determine whether the onset of myocardial infarction occurs randomly throughout the day, we analyzed the time of onset of pain in 2999 patients admitted with myocardial infarction. A marked circadian rhythm in the frequency of onset was detected, with a peak from 6 a.m. to noon (P less than 0.01). In 703 of the patients, the time of the first elevation in the plasma creatine kinase MB (CK-MB) level could be used to time the onset of myocardial infarction objectively. CK-MB-estimated timing confirmed the existence of a circadian rhythm, with a three-fold increase in the frequency of onset of myocardial infarction at peak (9 a.m.) as compared with trough (11 p.m.) periods. The circadian rhythm was not detected in patients receiving beta-adrenergic blocking agents before myocardial infarction but was present in those not receiving such therapy. If coronary arteries become vulnerable to occlusion when the intima covering an atherosclerotic plaque is disrupted, the circadian timing of myocardial infarction may result from a variation in the tendency to thrombosis. If the rhythmic processes that drive the circadian rhythm of myocardial-infarction onset can be identified, their modification may delay or prevent the occurrence of infarction.",

Effects were also found in blinded birds, and following surgical and chemical interference with the neural connections of the pineal, indicating that the gland possesses intrinsic magnetic sensitivity. The results are in line with the concept that magnetic field detection is associated with photoreceptor activity.", 
    "32": "Norepinephrine and serotonin augment by about 2-fold the accumulation of cyclic [3H]AMP elicited by 2-chloroadenosine in [3H]adenine-labeled guinea-pig cerebral cortical slices. Histamine causes a 3-fold augmentation. The first two agents have no effect on cyclic AMP alone, while histamine has only a small effect alone. The augmentation of the 2-chloroadenosine response appears to be mediated by alpha 1-adrenergic, 5HT2-serotonergic and H2-histaminergic receptors. VIP-elicited accumulations of cyclic AMP are also augmented through stimulation of alpha 1-adrenergic, 5HT2-serotonergic and H1-histaminergic receptors. Activation of these amine receptors also increases the turnover of phosphatidylinositols in [3H]inositol-labeled guinea pig cerebral cortical slices. Norepinephrine causes a 5-fold, serotonin a 1.2-fold, and histamine a 2.5-fold increase in accumulations of [3H]inositol phosphates. 2-Chloroadenosine, vasoactive intestinal peptide, baclofen, and somatostatin have no effect on phosphatidylinositol turnover, nor do the last two agents augment accumulations of cyclic AMP elicited by 2-chloroadenosine. The data suggest a possible relationship between turnover of phosphatidylinositol and the augmentations of the cyclic AMP accumulations elicited by biogenic amines in brain slices.", 
    "33": "We studied the effect of a thromboxane A2-mimetic, U46619, on the contractile responses of canine bronchial smooth muscle to cholinergic stimulation in vitro. U46619 (3 X 10(-10) M), at a concentration that did not cause contraction, enhanced the effect of electrical field stimulation at all frequencies; histamine (10(-7) M) and prostaglandin F2 alpha (10(-7) M) did not. U46619 (3 X 10(-10) M) did not affect methacholine-induced contractions. U46619 may therefore increase the prejunctional release of acetylcholine.", 
    "34": "The beta-adrenergic receptor from several tissues has been purified to homogeneity or photoaffinity radiolabeled and its subunit molecular weight determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In this study we have examined the oligomeric structure of nondenatured beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptor proteins, as solubilized with the detergent digitonin. Model systems used were frog and turkey red blood cell as well as rat, rabbit, and bovine lung plasma membrane preparations. To correct for the effects of detergent binding, sedimentation equilibrium analysis in various solvents, as adapted for the air-driven ultracentrifuge, was used. With this approach an estimate of 6 g of digitonin/g of protein binding was determined, corresponding to a ratio of 180 mol of digitonin/mol of protein. Protein molecular weights estimated by this method were 43 500 for the turkey red blood cell beta 1 receptor and 54 000 for the frog red blood cell beta 2 receptor. Molecular weights of 60 000-65 000 were estimated for beta 1 and beta 2 receptors present in mammalian lungs. These values agree with estimates of subunit molecular weight obtained by SDS gel electrophoresis of purified or photoradiolabeled preparations and suggest beta-adrenergic receptors to be digitonin solubilized from the membrane as single polypeptide chains.",

    "36": "Ventricular preexcitation was diagnosed in 6 dogs and 7 cats examined because of weakness, syncope, or congestive heart failure, and as an incidental finding in 1 dog and 2 cats. Reciprocating tachycardias were documented in 8 of the cases. Six of the cats had a pathologic diagnosis of primary cardiomyopathy. Two of the dogs had an associated congenital heart defect. Reciprocating tachycardias were controlled in 4 cases with digoxin, in 2 cases with propranolol, and in 1 case with quinidine. Conduction through the accessory pathway was altered by quinidine (2 cases), digoxin, and propranolol (1 case each), resulting in a lengthened P-R interval and more normal QRS complex configuration.", 
    "37": "Ten healthy volunteers ingested a single 18-mg oral dose of sustained release nitroglycerin (TNG) (Giulini-Pharma) on three occasions: once in the control state, once during coadministration of propranolol (80-mg three times daily), and once during coadministration of metoprolol (100-mg twice daily). The degree of beta adrenergic blockade was evaluated by the metaproterenol infusion test. Plasma concentration of TNG and its major metabolite, 1,2-dinitroglycerin (DNG), during 12 h after each dose were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Intact TNG was not detected in the plasma of any patient. The major metabolite, DNG, was easily measurable in blood, and had a biphasic plasma concentration profile. Coadministration of the beta-blockers had no influence on any of the kinetic variables for DNG. The mean values during control, propranolol, and metoprolol trials of DNG elimination half-life were: 1.35, 1.10, and 1.09 h; total area under the curve: 42, 38, and 42 ng/ml X h; oral clearance: 6.6, 7.2, and 6.4 liters/min. Thus TNG when administered as a sustained release oral preparation is rapidly and completely transformed to DNG. There was no pharmacokinetic interaction between sustained release TNG and two commonly used beta-blocking agents, suggesting that any clinical interaction that may-occur between sustained release nitroglycerin and beta-blocking agents is pharmacodynamic rather than pharmacokinetic in nature.", 
    "38": "In mixed culture of Chinese hamster fibroblasts, clone 431, and transformed murine L fibroblasts, clone B-82, isoproterenol was found to protect only 431 cells against ionizing radiation. It was shown that 431 cells, in contrast to B-82 cells, possess beta-adrenoreceptors, and the radioprotective effect of isoproterenol can be realized only if this agent interacts with beta-adrenoreceptors coupled with the cAMP system. Since malignization often causes the disappearance of beta-adrenergic and other hormone receptors, the combined culturing and irradiation of the cells studied can be regarded as a model of the growth of malignant cells (B-82) among normal tissue cells (431 cells) under conditions of radiation therapy. A possibility of selective protection against radiation damage of normal tissue cells, with retention of the former radiosensitivity of tumor cells, is discussed.", 
    "39": "Highly selective beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents with a beta 1: beta 2-selectivity ratio of 0.015 to 3400 were used to characterize the beta-adrenoceptors present in rat kidney and to identify those mediating renin release. The results obtained with ICYP binding to kidney membranes revealed the presence of both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors in a ratio of 1:1. The pKD beta 1- and pKD beta 2-values of selective beta-antagonists obtained in rat kidney membranes correlated well with those found in guinea pig left ventricle (beta 1) and lung (beta 2), indicating that kidney receptor subtypes are pharmacologically identical with those in the ventricle and lung, respectively. In the isolated perfused rat kidney, the apparent pA2 values of beta 1-selective blockers for inhibition of isoprenaline-stimulated renin release correlated well with pKD beta 1, but not with pKD beta 2 values. These results clearly show that the beta 1-adrenoceptor subtype mediates renin release in the rat kidney.", 
    "40": "This study evaluated whether an ischemic exercise test response or functional capacity could be predicted from data available during hospitalization in patients discharged after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The value of exercise test variables for predicting death and new AMI within 1 year was also examined. Among 1,469 patients, 466 (32%) underwent treadmill exercise testing around the time of discharge. An ischemic exercise test response (ST-segment depression or angina) could not be predicted. Good functional capacity (more than 4 METs) could be predicted from age and ST-segment changes at rest. Among the 60% of the patients who were predicted to have functional capacity of more than 4 METs, only 15% had poor functional capacity at the time of testing. Multivariate analysis for predicting death and new infarction selected only functional capacity (continuous variable in METs), which classified 72% of the patients into a low-risk group with less than a 2% rate of death and new AMI in the first year. The high-risk group (29% of the patients) had an 18% rate of death or new AMI. It is concluded that functional capacity is the most important exercise test variable and that patients likely to have good functional capacity can be identified on the basis of age and ST-segment changes at rest. Further, the level of functional capacity on exercise testing can identify groups of patients with very low and relatively high risk of death or new AMI within 1 year.", 
    "41": "This open randomised parallel trial compared the antihypertensive efficacy of enalapril and atenolol given alone once a day or with hydrochlorothiazide in 20 patients with moderate to severe hypertension. Active treatment was over a 26 week period, consisting of an initial titration phase followed by a fixed dose phase. Both treatment regimes effectively lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressures. All patients on enalapril reached normotension (supine diastolic blood pressure less than or equal to 90 mmHg) compared with 78% on atenolol. Pulse rate was not appreciably changed by enalapril, but was significantly reduced by atenolol. No serious adverse reactions or significant changes in laboratory values were noted in either group. The commonest adverse reaction with enalapril was dizziness which occurred in two cases and resolved on dosage reduction. Enalapril with hydrochlorothiazide given once daily may provide a useful combination in the treatment of moderate to severe hypertension.", 
    "42": "Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is known to produce increases in total peripheral resistance (TPR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) and decreases in heart rate (HR), cardiac output (CO), and plasma renin activity (PRA). Some recent observations with AVP and synthetic analogues have suggested that under certain conditions, AVP can induce cardiovascular and reninsecretory responses in the opposite directions. To characterize the receptors mediating these responses, the effects of AVP, oxytocin, and synthetic neurohypophyseal analogues with specific antidiuretic, vasoconstrictor, or oxytocic activities were studied in conscious dogs. AVP and 2-phenylalanine-8-ornithine-oxytocin (Phe2Orn8OT, a selective vasoconstrictor agonist) produced similar responses when infused at 10 ng X kg-1 X min-1. That is, TPR and MAP increased, and CO, HR, and PRA decreased. Pretreatment with a selective vasoconstrictor antagonist, [1-(beta-mercapto-beta,beta-cyclopentamethylenepropionic acid) 2-(O-methyl)tyrosine]AVP, abbreviated d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)-AVP (10 micrograms/kg), blocked the actions of Phe2Orn8OT. However, in the presence of d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP, AVP actually decreased TPR and increased CO, HR, and PRA. An analogue with selective antidiuretic activity, 4-valine-8-D-AVP (VDAVP, 10 ng X kg-1 X min-1), produced the same effects as the combination of vasopressin plus d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP. Neither the effects of VDAVP nor of AVP plus antagonist were blocked by propranolol (1 mg/kg). These data indicate that vasopressin, by its antidiuretic activity, produces cardiovascular effects that are opposite to many of those produced by its vasoconstrictor action and that these effects are not dependent on mediation by beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "43": "A distinctive new type of autonomic-system-dependent urticaria was seen in two patients. This \"adrenergic\" urticaria is to be contrasted with cholinergic urticaria. Widespread pruritic, urticarial papules developed at times of stress, each papule being surrounded by a striking white halo. Associated with these lesions was an increase in plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline concentrations. In severe attacks large plaques of urticaria appeared as well. The halo hives could be replicated with an intradermal injection of noradrenaline, but not with acetylcholine. Treatment with a beta-adrenoreceptor-blocker, propranolol, prevented attacks.", 
    "44": "Cationic amphiphilic drugs like chlorpromazine, propranolol, and chloroquine inhibit lysosomal phospholipase A in vitro. Some workers have proposed that cationic amphiphilic drugs inhibit the activity of phospholipase A1 by forming substrate-drug complexes which cannot be degraded while others have reported competitive inhibition implying drug effects on the enzyme. To analyze the mechanism of inhibition, we examined the binding ability of these drugs to unilamellar vesicles of dioleoylphosphatidylcholine and correlated these results with a detailed kinetic analysis of phospholipase A. Chlorpromazine and propranolol bound to small unilamellar liposomes of dioleoylphosphatidylcholine substrate in a positive cooperative way consistent with two binding sites: a high-affinity site with low capacity and a low-affinity site with high capacity. The affinity of chlorpromazine for the high-affinity site was 2 times greater than that of propranolol (KA = 13 807 +/- 1722 vs. 8481 +/- 1078 M-1), and the saturation number for chlorpromazine was 3 times greater than for propranolol (N = 0.20 +/- 0.004 vs. 0.07 +/- 0.02 mol of drug/mol of phosphatidylcholine). Chloroquine did not bind to unilamellar liposomes of dioleoylphosphatidylcholine. We carried out detailed kinetic studies using purified lysosomal phospholipase A1 from rat liver. In the case of chloroquine inhibition, the Lineweaver-Burk double-reciprocal plots showed straight lines, but the slope replots were curved, indicating the formation of complexes having 2 mol of chloroquine/mol of enzyme (EI2 complexes). Thus, chloroquine is a competitive inhibitor which forms EI2 complexes with phospholipase A1. However, in the case of chlorpromazine and propranolol, the observed kinetic data do not fit to the same equilibrium used for the case of chloroquine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "45": "Inhibition of ritodrine-induced cardiac and peripheral vascular effects by the beta 1-adrenergic blocker metoprolol, was studied by electromagnetic flow measurements in anesthetized dogs. As expected, metoprolol inhibited the ritodrine-induced/increased cardiac workload and heart rate. Metoprolol also inhibited ritodrine-induced peripheral vasodilation. This leads to questions about the cardiac beta 1-adrenergic selectivity of metoprolol. Regarding earlier studies showing no interference in labor inhibition, the combination of ritodrine and metoprolol might be useful in treatment of preterm labor, while economizing cardiovascular performance centrally as well as peripherally.", 
    "46": "The accumulation of intermediates subsequent to impaired beta-oxidation of free fatty acid (FFA) has been suggested as a cause of cellular damage in ischemic myocardium. We investigated the effects of propranolol and diltiazem on carnitine metabolism in ischemic myocardium. Propranolol (0.2 mg/kg/min, i.v.) and diltiazem (0.1 mg/kg/min, i.v.) were administered for 5 min, the administration started 10 min before coronary occlusion. ECGs were continuously recorded throughout the experiment. Myocardial samples were prepared from both the non-ischemic and ischemic areas 40 min after coronary ligation. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), free carnitine, long chain acyl carnitine and long chain acyl CoA were assayed. Propranolol reduced the decrease of ATP and the accumulation of long chain acyl CoA, induced by myocardial ischemia. Diltiazem reduced the decrease of ATP and free carnitine, and the accumulation of long chain acyl carnitine in the ischemic area. Propranolol and diltiazem significantly reduced the grade of ventricular arrhythmia. These results suggest that the protective mechanisms of propranolol and diltiazem on myocardium are based, at least in part, on their beneficial effects upon myocardial carnitine metabolism.", 
    "47": "We studied the effects of propranolol on infarct size and hemodynamic impairment induced by 24 h-coronary ligation. The myocardial infarction produced by the left circumflex coronary artery ligation was more consistent than that induced by the left anterior descending coronary artery ligation, suggesting that the former is a more appropriate experimental model for pharmacological evaluations. Oral treatment with propranolol, 3-30 mg/kg, reduced infarct size and reduced the elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, which was shown to be most closely related with infarct size, in dogs with circumflex coronary artery ligation extending over 24 h. In conclusion, our results indicate that propranolol protects against the enlargement of infarct size and improves the impaired hemodynamics observed in myocardial infarcted dogs with occlusions extending over 24 h, as well as in dogs with less than 24 h-occlusions reported by numerous investigators.", 
    "48": "In functionally skinned muscle fibers from the rabbit, we studied the effect of propranolol on calcium activation of the contractile proteins and, in separate experiments, on calcium uptake and release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) while measuring physiological tension. Pieces from isolated papillary muscle (PM), soleus (SL) (slow-twitch skeletal muscle), and adductor magnus (AM) (fast-twitch skeletal muscle) were homogenized (sarcolemma disrupted). A fiber bundle from PM and single fibers from SL and AM were dissected from the homogenate and mounted on a photodiode tension transducer. To study Ca2+-activated tension development of the contractile proteins, we used high EGTA (7 mmol/l) to control the free calcium concentration. To study SR function, we used five different solutions to load the calcium into the SR and to release it from the SR with 25 mmol/l caffeine, thus producing a tension transient. In general, propranolol has similar mechanisms of action in the three muscle types. Propranolol (0.1-1.0 mmol/l) increased the submaximal calcium-activated tension development in all muscles but with PM = SL greater than AM, and this increase was correlated with increases in calcium binding to isolated troponin C. Propranolol increased the maximal calcium-activated tension development in PM and SL, but decreased that in AM. Propranolol at concentrations of 0.3-1.0 mmol/l decreased calcium uptake by the SR but did not change calcium release in any of the three muscles. In PM, however, propranolol at a concentration of 0.1 mmol/l increased calcium uptake by the SR. We conclude that propranolol induces decreases in muscle contraction mainly by decreasing calcium uptake by the SR.",

With respect to the preventive effect and spectrum of action selenofen-24 was shown to be advantageous on various experimental models of arrhythmias: aconitine, strophanthin, pituitrin or calcium chloride.", 
    "50": "Various blood pressure (BP)-regulating factors were assessed before and after 4 weeks of selective norepinephrine (NE) inhibition with the sympathetic neurone blocker, debrisoquine, in nine hypertensive, nine normotensive hemodialysis patients (HDP), and 11 normal subjects. On placebo, hypertensive HDP had an increased total blood volume (P less than 0.05) and exchangeable sodium (P less than 0.001), while both HDP groups had increased (P less than 0.05) plasma clearances of NE and angiotensin II (AII), and tended to have higher basal plasma NE, renin, and AII levels, and lower BP responses to NE or AII than normal subjects. Plasma epinephrine and the chronotropic dose of isoproterenol (CDI) did not differ significantly among groups. Debrisoquine lowered supine BP markedly in hypertensive HDP (on average from 181/107 to 148/88 mm Hg) and slightly in normotensive HDP (143/78 to 131/76 mm Hg), but not in normal subjects (116/74 to 120/79 mm Hg). In all groups, plasma NE, CDI, and NE pressor dose were reduced in parallel (by 35 to 75%; P less than 0.05 to less than 0.001), and the relation between stepwise increasing plasma NE and BP changes during NE infusion was commensurably displaced to the left (P less than 0.01). The remaining parameters were not changed consistently.", 
    "51": "HDP, as normal subjects, respond to decreased sympathetic outflow with increased alpha- and beta-receptor sensitivity. Hypertension in HDP depends strongly on a NE-related mechanism. The latter seems to complement renin-angiotensin, sodium and fluid volume in the pathogenesis of high BP.", 
    "52": "The development of delayed ventricular repolarization was studied in eight patients with clinical indication for chronic beta blockade. Their mean age was 74 years (range 69-81 years) and they all had permanent pacemakers for syncope. The ventricular repolarization time was assessed by means of the Q-T top interval during ventricular stimulation at different paced heart rates. In a group of seven other patients there was a close relationship between the right ventricular monophasic action potential duration at 90% repolarization (RV MAPD90) and the paced Q-T top interval (r = 0.90). After three weeks of treatment with 200 mg metoprolol daily, the paced Q-T top interval increased significantly (3-4%, P less than 0.001) at all paced heart rates, while after about two weeks of treatment a significant increase was seen only at the paced heart rate of 130 beats min-1 (P less than 0.01). Thus, the present study confirmed the development of delayed ventricular repolarization within three weeks of treatment with 200 mg metoprolol daily. The onset of this effect was first noticeable after about two weeks of treatment. Furthermore, the close relationship between the RV MAPD90 and the paced Q-T top interval implies that the paced Q-T top interval may be a reliable and useful feature to detect changes in the ventricular repolarization time.", 
    "53": "Previous studies using aversive training tasks have reported that retention is enhanced by post-training administration of epinephrine. This study investigated the effects of post-training administration of epinephrine on retention of an appetitive task. The results indicate that epinephrine can enhance retention performance in an appetitive task of both rats and mice. Pretraining injections of propranolol and phenoxybenzamine, alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists, attenuate the memory-enhancing effects of epinephrine. These results are consistent with the view that release of peripheral epinephrine may regulate storage of new information and may mediate memory modulation produced by a variety of treatments.", 
    "54": "The pharmacokinetics of bucindolol and its major metabolite, 5-hydroxybucindolol, have been studied in eight patients with mild/moderate hypertension. The mean terminal elimination half-life of bucindolol following acute oral dosing was 8.0 +/- 4.5 h, while the elimination half-life of the metabolite was 0.15 +/- 0.13 h. Because of the large intraindividual variation in the pharmacokinetics of the drug and metabolite, no significant differences in the kinetics following acute or chronic dosing were seen. There was very wide interindividual variability in the pharmacokinetics of bucindolol and 5-hydroxybucindolol, and large interindividual differences in the metabolic profiles as assessed by the areas under drug and metabolite concentration-time curves. This latter observation might be associated with a genetic polymorphism of drug metabolism.", 
    "55": "The responses of mesenteric microcirculation of the rat to circulating noradrenaline were studied by in vivo microscopy, using a photo-electric device placed on a television monitor to measure changes in diameter of individual vessels. Blood flow was measured in the anterior mesenteric artery with an electromagnetic flow transducer, mesenteric vascular conductance was computed on-line from mesenteric artery flow and arterial pressure. I.V. injection of noradrenaline induced a decrease in diameter of arterioles (less than 30 microns) which began simultaneously with the rise in arterial pressure and averaged 15% at 15-20 s. By contrast small and principal arteries (30-40 microns and 80-350 microns respectively) generally showed a diameter increase which averaged 10% and began at the peak of the pressor response. Venules and veins (12-560 microns) showed a diameter decrease which averaged 12-15% at 25-30 s. Meanwhile mesenteric vascular conductance fell by 65-75% in 10 s and rose to 30-50% above control in 25-30 s. The diameter increases of small and principal arteries were not reflex dilator responses initiated by the rise in systemic arterial pressure, nor due to beta-adrenoreceptor stimulation. However, local application of phentolamine abolished responses of all sections of the vascular tree indicating that they all depended on activation of alpha-adrenoreceptors. During I.V. infusion of noradrenaline small arteries showed a maintained increase in diameter which began at the peak of the pressor response, while arterioles initially decreased in diameter but then relaxed, often attaining resting diameter before infusion ceased. Meanwhile mesenteric flow and conductance decreased transiently, but then returned to near control levels, i.e. 'autoregulatory escape' occurred. It is argued that noradrenaline induced alpha-mediated contraction of all sections of the vascular tree; the tendency of arteries to constrict was counteracted by the rise in intravascular pressure caused by arteriolar constriction, active constriction of venous vessels may have been augmented by passive collapse secondary to arteriolar constriction. The secondary relaxation of arterial vessels reflects an inherent property of their smooth muscle to relax from the constrictor influence of noradrenaline and is more marked in proximal than distal vessels. It is proposed that the initial decrease in mesenteric vascular conductance in response to circulating noradrenaline may be attributed to active constriction of distal arterioles and the secondary increase in conductance ('escape') to secondary relaxation of more proximal arterial vessels.", 
    "56": "Metoprolol, a cardio-selective beta-adrenergic blocking agent, was studied in 25 patients to assess its effect on \"non-specific\" ST-segment and T-wave changes both at rest and during exercise. In two thirds of the patients with ST-T-abnormalities at rest, the changes disappeared completely after beta-blockade but reappeared during exercise in some of them. Only in 9 patients were the changes eliminated also during exercise implying that they were \"functional\", i.e., caused by increased sympathetic discharge. In those patients, where the ST-T-abnormalities were not affected at all by the beta-blockade, they were probably due to organic heart disease, whereas when they were reduced but not completely abolished, increased sympathetic tone as well as organic heart disease might be the cause. It is inferred that the diagnostic information is increased by studying the effect of beta-blockade not only at rest but also during exercise. Metoprolol seems to be well suited for the evaluation of \"non-specific\" ST-T-abnormalities, especially when non-selective beta-blockers should be avoided, e.g. in obstructive lung disease.", 
    "57": "The purpose of our prospective study was to evaluate the long-term effect of aggressive antihypertensive treatment on glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria in young female and male patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus with diabetic nephropathy and blood pressure greater than 90 mm Hg. Eight patients received treatment with metoprolol (200-400 mg/day), hydralazine (100-200 mg/day), and furosemide (80-500 mg/day). The untreated control group consisted of eight patients matched for age (mean 32 years), diabetes duration (mean 17 years), and sex (two female and six male patients). All patients except one had diabetic retinopathy. Glomerular filtration rate was measured after a single intravenous injection of 51Cr-labeled ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. Urinary albumin concentration was determined with a radial immunodiffusion method. The investigations were performed two to four times per year in each patient. The mean observation period was 59 and 27 months in the treated and untreated groups respectively. Due to a considerable rise in arterial blood pressure, it was considered unethical to prolong the observation in the untreated group. Arterial blood pressure rose from 140/96 +/- 4/1 to 150/100 +/- 3/2 mm Hg; albuminuria increased from 1517 +/- 502 to 1911 +/- 120 micrograms/min; and glomerular filtration rate decreased by a mean of 0.84 +/- 0.17 ml/min/mo in the untreated group. Antihypertensive treatment induced blood pressure reduction 151/100 +/- 3/2 to 131/87 +/- 2/1 mm Hg; diminished albuminuria 1467 +/- 515 to 729 +/- 65 micrograms/min; and caused a slow rate of decline in GFR, mean 0.37 +/- 0.08 ml/min/mo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "58": "The circulatory consequences of concurrent slow-calcium channel (nicardipine) and cardioselective beta blockade (metoprolol) were evaluated in 20 patients with angiographically proven coronary artery disease. The rest and exercise haemodynamic impact of intravenous nicardipine (10 mg) or metoprolol (10 mg) alone was determined by randomly allocating 10 patients to each drug; finally all patients were assessed on combination therapy. The plasma levels of nicardipine (17 +/- 3 to 53 +/- 6 ng ml-1) and metoprolol (36 +/- 5 to 97 +/- 16 ng ml-1) achieved at the time of each study were in the established therapeutic range. At rest nicardipine reduced systemic mean arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance index; cardiac and stroke volume indices increased without change in pulmonary artery occluded pressure. Metoprolol alone reduced systemic blood pressure, heart rate and cardiac index, and increased systemic vascular resistance index. Combination therapy reduced systemic arterial blood pressure and heart rate with relatively modest effects on cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance index and pulmonary artery occluded pressure. During dynamic exercise nicardipine reduced systemic mean and diastolic arterial pressure and stroke work index without change in other haemodynamic variables. Metoprolol reduced exercise systemic arterial pressures, heart rate and cardiac index, and increased systemic vascular resistance index and pulmonary artery occluded pressure. Combination therapy produced changes similar to those at rest; at peak nicardipine pharmacodynamic activity, the cardiac depressant actions of metoprolol were largely offset by the induced reduction in left ventricular afterload.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "59": "The effects of hypoxia on the actions of dl-sotalol 10(-4) mol . litre-1 were studied in rabbit papillary muscles at 32 degrees C. Superfusion for 30 min with a hypoxic solution (95% N2, 5% CO2) in the presence of 5 mmol . litre-1 glucose caused moderate shortening of control action potential duration from 208 +/- 3 to 138 +/- 9 ms (mean +/- SEM). In the presence of sotalol, hypoxia caused shortening of APD90 from 399 +/- 9 ms to 249 +/- ms, but the value after 30 min was still significantly greater than in controls (p less than 0.001). Superfusion with a hypoxic, glucose-free solution, however, caused profound shortening of APD90 in controls to 80 +/- 7 ms at 30 min. The highly significant lengthening of APD90 produced by sotalol in control conditions was abolished after 5 min hypoxia. The effects of hypoxia on the effective refractory period (ERP) paralleled those on APD90. Exposure to a hypoxic, acidotic, hyperkalaemic solution (80% N2, 20% CO2, pH 6.8; K+ 12 mmol . litre-1) produced moderate shortening of APD90 with convergence of the two groups. There was an increase in ERP, with the development of an equal degree of post-repolarisation refractoriness in the control and sotalol groups. The Class III effect of sotalol is preserved under mild but lost under severely hypoxic conditions. Using \"simulated ischaemic\" conditions, with controlled extracellular potassium concentrations, there was no difference in the relationship between APD90 and ERP in the control and sotalol groups.", 
    "60": "The effects of acute myocardial ischaemia on the Class III antiarrhythmic properties of dl-sotalol 10(-4) mol . litre-1 were studied in the isolated arterially perfused interventricular septum of the rabbit heart. Before ischaemia, sotalol increased mean action potential duration (APD90) from 267 +/- 6 to 406 +/- 19 ms (p less than 0.001 mean +/- SEM, n = 7 septa), and mean effective refractory period (ERP) from 222 +/- 7 to 291 +/- 10 ms. During 30 min zero flow global ischaemia, mean APD90 in the control group fell from 264 +/- 7 to 128 +/- 13 ms (n = 7). APD90 fell more rapidly in the sotalol group, so that the initial difference between the sotalol and control groups was abolished after 24 min ischaemia. In the sotalol group, ERP shortened rapidly during ischaemia, and was significantly less than in the control group after 30 min. These changes were associated with the development of substantial post-repolarisation refractoriness in the control but not in the sotalol group. There was a greater fall in action potential upstroke velocity in the controls than in the sotalol group. The results indicate that the Class III effect of sotalol gradually disappears during ischaemia. The effects on post-repolarisation refractoriness and upstroke velocity are compatible with the hypothesis that sotalol slows the rate of rise of extracellular potassium concentration in acute ischaemia. This is a potentially antiarrhythmic property.", 
    "61": "The study was carried out to determine whether the diminished release of norepinephrine (NE) upon sympathetic activation in the presence of sotalol can be attributed to the blockade of beta-adrenoceptors in the liver. NE release from the liver was measured in hepatic venous blood collected during direct hepatic nerve stimulation in anesthetized dogs. The mean basal NE concentration in hepatic venous and aortic blood was 0.046 +/- 0.003 and 0.244 +/- 0.041 ng/mL, respectively. NE release increased significantly as stimulation frequency increased, while aortic NE concentration remained unchanged. The increasing response of NE release upon stimulation in the vehicle control group remained stable during the whole experimental period. In dogs treated with sotalol (5 mg/kg, i.v.), NE release was reduced approximately by 30-43%, and the difference was statistically significant (P less than 0.01) at 8 Hz. (+/-)-Propranolol (2.5 mg/kg, i.v.) tended to diminish it, but the difference was not significant. (-)-Propranolol (0.1 mg/kg, i.v.) did not alter NE release at any frequency tested. The beta-blocking action of these drugs in the liver, as determined by the antagonism against the hepatic arterial vasodilating response to isoproterenol, was most effective with (+/-)-propranolol (100%), followed by (-)-propranolol (90%) and sotalol (70%). The results suggest that the inhibitory effect of sotalol on NE release may be related to a mechanism other than its beta-blocking action in the dog liver.", 
    "62": "In a placebo controlled open study in six healthy male volunteers (+)-sotalol in the dose range 0.125 mg kg-1-2.0 mg kg-1 intravenously, was found to have little or no beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity in comparison to the racemic mixture (+/-)-sotalol. The repolarization effects of (+)- and (+/-)-sotalol on the QTc interval however were comparable over the same dose range. The beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity and repolarization effects of sotalol appear to be unrelated.",

    "64": "The study was aimed at investigating the possible involvement of tonic activity of the adrenergic receptors in the medial preoptic area (mPOA) for maintenance of body temperature in rats. Differences in drug-induced changes in body temperatures during sleep and wakefulness--during the day and at night--were also investigated. Norepinephrine injected in the mPOA, produced a fall in body temperature, whereas phenoxybenzamine produced an increase. Saline and propranolol produced no alteration. Norepinephrine and phenoxybenzamine produced alterations in sleep-wakefulness also. These changes in sleep-wakefulness did not completely explain the thermal changes. The findings highlight the need for taking into account the basal activity and the time of application of drug in studies on thermo-regulation, using free moving animals.", 
    "65": "A high-risk subset of patients with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) and a predisposition to sudden cardiac death (SCD) has been proposed. We analyzed the results of programmed ventricular stimulation (PVS) in 20 patients with MVP and ventricular arrhythmias (ventricular premature depolarization in 6, ventricular couplets in 2, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia [VT] in 7, ventricular fibrillation [VF] in 5) and in 12 \"normal\" control subjects. With the use of an identical stimulation protocol from the right ventricular apex (twice diastolic threshold, three extrastimuli), 9 of 20 MVP patients and 1 of 12 normal subjects had inducible ventricular arrhythmias (p less than 0.05). When more aggressive attempts at ventricular stimulation were used, an additional five MVP patients had positive responses to PVS while no normal subjects did. In the MVP group, the following arrhythmias were induced: nonsustained polymorphic VT in 10, VF in three, and ventricular flutter in one. In all but two patients, triple ventricular extrastimuli were required to elicit this response. Two of the 10 MVP patients undergoing electropharmacologic testing had a successful antiarrhythmic regimen identified, while 13 patients were discharged on empiric antiarrhythmic therapy. At a follow-up of 19.8 +/- 13.1 months, all 19 MVP patients who could be contacted were alive. Five patients had symptomatic recurrences at follow-up including two SCD survivors (VT in one and VF in one). In conclusion, it was found that the majority of MVP patients with ventricular arrhythmias have inducible ventricular tachyarrhythmias during PVS and are more susceptible to this than patients without structural heart disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "66": "In a prospective study, 20 patients with a first acute myocardial infarction and no current treatment with diuretics or cardioactive drugs were randomized to treatment with intravenous timolol (10 patients) or placebo (10 patients). Plasma adrenaline, noradrenaline, and serum potassium were estimated at baseline (mean +/- SD 3.6 +/- 0.8 hours after the onset of the infarction) and 4 hours after the start of treatment. The patient selection criteria embraced a low-risk study population. Before treatment, the serum potassium concentrations correlated inversely with plasma adrenaline but not with plasma noradrenaline concentrations. A rise of serum potassium (mean +/- SD mmol/L) from 4.1 +/- 0.3 to 4.4 +/- 0.4 (p less than 0.05) in the placebo group and from 4.0 +/- 0.4 to 4.5 +/- 0.5 (p less than 0.05) in the timolol group was in multivariate analysis associated with infarct size, estimated as cumulative creatine kinase release, in the placebo group, and with the mean individual plasma adrenaline concentrations in the timolol group. By reversing the effect of adrenaline from a decrease to an increase in the serum potassium concentrations, timolol changes the relationships between circulating adrenaline, potassium, and infarct size.", 
    "67": "Acute hypoglycemia was induced using intravenous inulin in three groups of normal volunteers: (1) seventeen control subjects, (2) six subjects under beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol, and (3) eight subjects given propranolol plus sodium lactate as an exogenous substrate for gluconeogenesis. Under propranolol blockade the recovery from hypoglycemia was significantly impaired. This impairment was not prevented by the infusion of sodium lactate despite the production of an adequate elevation of blood lactate concentrations. These findings suggest that the impaired recovery from hypoglycemia during beta-adrenergic blockade is not mediated via a deficiency of lactate as substrate for hepatic gluconeogenesis.", 
    "68": "Epinephrine (10(-7) mol/L) addition to isolated canine hepatocytes activates glycogen phosphorylase from 12.3 +/- 0.4 to 28.6 +/- 2.6 U/g and glucose output from 42 +/- 3 to 170 +/- 24 nmol/mg/h. Preincubation of hepatocytes with propranolol (2 X 10(-5) mol/L) caused a 73% inhibition of phosphorylase activation and a 77% inhibition of the stimulation of glucose output by epinephrine. Phentolamine (2 X 10(-5) mol/L) on the other hand, caused a 16% inhibition of phosphorylase activation and a 27% inhibition of the stimulation of glucose output by epinephrine. These results were unaffected by the sex of the animal. In the dog the glycogenolytic effects of epinephrine appear to be mediated primarily by a beta-adrenergic mechanism.", 
    "69": "The effect of bladder filling on vesical blood flow was studied in anesthetized cats. The pelvic nerves were sectioned and the bladder venous outflow was recorded by a drop counter. Filling of the bladder induced a sustained increase in vesical blood flow, related to the bladder volume. Thus, injection of 10, 20 and 30 ml. of saline decreased bladder vascular resistance by 27, 47 and 52 per cent, respectively. This vasodilation occurred despite a steady state increase in bladder pressure by 25 to 50 cm. H2O. Upon emptying of the bladder, blood flow decreased towards control values. The response was unaffected by alpha-adrenoceptor blockade (phentolamine), beta-adrenoceptor blockade (propranolol) and muscarinic cholinoceptor blockade (atropine). The vasodilation was eliminated by papaverine, indicating that the response was not due to a rearrangement of the vessels at large bladder volumes. The vasodilation was not associated with any increase in the concentrations of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) or substance P in the venous effluent blood. Indomethacin significantly reduced the vasodilatation induced by filling. We conclude that local mechanisms, possibly involving release of prostaglandins, are involved in the vasodilation following bladder distension.", 
    "70": "In this study, pindolol, a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent marketed as a racemic mixture, was used as a model compound to investigate stereoselective renal clearance of organic cations in human beings. Six normal subjects received an oral dose of 20 mg racemic pindolol. Heart rate and blood pressure were measured throughout the study. A stereospecific high performance liquid chromatographic procedure was used to quantitate the concentrations of d- and l-pindolol in plasma and urine. Renal clearance and other pharmacokinetic parameters of both enantiomers were calculated and compared. The renal clearance of l-pindolol was greater than that of d-pindolol in all subjects. The renal clearance (mean +/- SD) was 240 +/- 55 ml/min for l-pindolol and 200 +/- 51 ml/min for d-pindolol (P less than 0.01). Since stereoselective binding to plasma proteins was not observed, differences in renal clearance between d- and l-pindolol were caused by either stereoselective renal transport, or stereoselective renal metabolism. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve, the amount of drug excreted, and the half-life of l-pindolol were greater than those of d-pindolol, which suggests that pindolol was also eliminated stereoselectively by nonrenal routes. The slopes of the resting heart rate vs. the plasma concentration of l-pindolol were significantly less than zero and were significantly correlated to the pretreatment heart rate, which supports the hypothesis that intrinsic sympathetic tone largely determines the effect of pindolol on the resting heart rate. The observation that pindolol is eliminated stereoselectively by the kidney may have clinical implications for other racemic drugs that are renally eliminated.",

    "72": "We have compared the effect of a new drug d-sotalol which has minimal beta-blocking action with the parent (beta-blocking) compound dl-sotalol on monophasic action potential (MAP) duration in open-chested dogs. In seven experiments d-sotalol was administered in intravenous bolus doses of 1.5, 3 and 6 mg/kg given at 10 min intervals. In a further seven experiments dl-sotalol was administered using the same dosage regimen. The animals were anaesthetized with chloralose and urethane. Atrioventricular block was created by injection of the bundle of His with 0.1 ml of 40% formalin in order to ensure capture by ventricular pacing. After prior beta-blockade with propranolol (0.25 mg/kg), simultaneous epicardial and endocardial MAP were recorded at paced heart rates of 100 and 150 beats/min after each bolus injection. d-Sotalol and dl-sotalol showed similar prolongation of MAP duration (measured at 90% repolarization) in both endocardial and epicardial recording at both paced heart rates. These results show that the dextro-isomer of sotalol possesses similar class III action to the parent compound and that this action is homogeneous with respect to left ventricular endocardium and epicardium at heart rates of 100 beats/min and 150 beats/min over a wide dose range. d-Sotalol may be a useful anti-arrhythmic agent in man.", 
    "73": "Our objective was to identify biologic determinants of propranolol serum levels in 1308 patients after myocardial infarction (MI). Patients had had their MI within the previous month. A steady-state propranolol dosage of 40 mg every 8 hours produced a mean trough concentration of 42 ng/ml with extremely great (fiftyfold) interindividual variability. Univariate and multivariate analyses suggested that this variability was the result of many biologic factors. Serum levels were higher in women, in older patients, and in patients receiving concomitant therapy with other antiarrhythmic drugs. Serum levels were also higher in patients with elevated serum creatinine and lactate dehydrogenase levels. Serum levels were lower in black patients than in white patients. Also, serum levels in smokers were lower than those in nonsmokers, but only markedly so in the outpatient setting (6 months after the MI). The influence of sex and race on drug disposition has not previously been reported for beta-blocking drugs. Although a genetic deficiency in the oxidative metabolism of propranolol has been indicated, the frequency distribution of serum propranolol levels did not demonstrate a bimodal distribution for genetically distinct populations.", 
    "74": "The effectiveness, safety, and pharmacodynamics of repeated doses of intravenous labetalol for rapid reduction of severe hypertension and of subsequent oral labetalol dosing were studied. Twelve patients with severe hypertension were admitted to the hospital after the withholding of antihypertensive therapy for 2 to 14 days. Thirty minutes after an injection of vehicle only, labetalol, 0.25 mg/kg body weight, was injected and followed by repeat injections of 0.5 mg/kg every 15 minutes until the supine diastolic blood pressure (BP) was reduced to less than 90 mm Hg or a total of 3.25 mg/kg had been administered. Twenty-four hours after the last injection, oral labetalol was started at an initial dosage of 100 or 200 mg b.i.d., then increased every 2 days until the standing diastolic BP was less than 90 mm Hg or a maximum daily dosage of 2400 mg was reached. The initial injection achieved mean falls in supine systolic/diastolic BPs of 11/7 mm Hg. Subsequent injections produced additional falls in a dose-related fashion; the mean falls after the last injection (total cumulative dose 2.7 mg/kg) were 40/20 mm Hg. The effect lasted for 12 hours or more in most patients and tended to be biphasic, with one peak at approximately 5 minutes and another much less pronounced peak at about 4 hours. There was no evidence of precipitous falls in BP. All patients were able to ambulate 6 hours after the last injection without symptoms of postural hypotension. Oral labetalol effectively and safely restored and maintained the BP reductions achieved with intravenous labetalol.", 
    "75": "We investigated the effect of pacing from the atrium and various ventricular sites on the left ventricular end-systolic pressure-volume relation following autonomic blockade in a total of 10 dogs chronically instrumented to measure left ventricular pressure and determine left ventricular volume from three ultrasonic endocardial dimensions. During ventricular pacing, left ventricular end-diastolic volume, stroke volume, and end-systolic pressure were decreased, while the end-systolic volume was relatively unchanged. Left ventricular end-systolic pressure-volume relations were generated by vena caval occlusions during pacing at a constant rate from the left atria, and the epicardium of the right ventricular free wall, right ventricular apex, and left ventricular free wall. The left ventricular end-systolic pressure-volume relations were described by straight lines for each site (r greater than 0.96 and SEE less than 2.9 mm Hg in all but one instance). Compared to atrial pacing, the left ventricular end-systolic pressure-volume relations were shifted (P less than 0.001) to the right during pacing from ventricular sites. During atrial pacing, the volume intercept of the left ventricular end-systolic pressure-volume relation was 16.0 +/- 7.2 ml (mean +/- SD), and increased to 18.7 +/- 7.8 ml (P less than 0.05) during pacing from the right ventricular free wall, to 19.6 +/- 7.7 ml (P less than 0.05) during pacing from the right ventricular apex, and to 20.0 +/- 7.5 ml (P less than 0.05) during pacing from the left ventricular free wall. These volume intercepts correlated roughly with the extent of dyssynchronous activation as estimated by the QRS duration (r = 0.59 to 0.93) and the time for left ventricular endocardial activation (r = 0.92 and 0.95). During ventricular pacing, the slope of the left ventricular end-systolic pressure-volume relation changed only slightly. Similar results were obtained during pacing from right ventricular endocardial sites. We conclude that alterations of the normal activation sequence produced by ventricular pacing depress left ventricular pumping function independent of loading conditions, as indicated by a rightward shift of the left ventricular end-systolic pressure-volume relation. The extent of this shift appears to be in proportion to the degree of dyssynchronous activation. The decreased stroke volume during ventricular pacing is due both to a decreased end-diastolic volume (decreased preload) and the rightward shift of the end-systolic pressure-volume relation (decreased pump function).", 
    "76": "The case of a patient with apparent cocaine toxicity and drug-mediated hypertension and tachycardia is presented. IV propranolol was used as the initial treatment for his hyperadrenergic state, resulting in a decrease in heart rate but a paroxsymal increase in blood pressure. The patient required nitroprusside for control of elevated blood pressure. A mechanism of unopposed alpha stimulation as a result of beta-2 receptor blockade is proposed, and a cautious approach to the use of propranolol in these patients is suggested.", 
    "77": "The influence of digitalis therapy on survivors of acute myocardial infarction was examined in the placebo-treated patients from the Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial (BHAT). Two hundred fifty (13%) of the 1,921 placebo-treated patients were receiving digitalis at the time of randomization. Patients receiving digitalis differed from those not receiving digitalis in such baseline characteristics as age, prior history of heart failure, prior myocardial infarction and angina pectoris. They also experienced a higher proportion of in-hospital complications including pulmonary edema, persistent hypotension, atrial fibrillation and heart failure in addition to a greater prevalence of complex ventricular premature beats. The total mortality rate over a mean 25 month follow-up period for digitalis-treated patients was 20.4% compared with 8.2% for patients not receiving digitalis; the odds ratio was 2.87 (p less than 0.05). When the mortality rates were adjusted for heart failure and ventricular premature beat complexity, patients receiving digitalis again demonstrated a higher mortality rate, although the adjusted odds ratio was now lower (1.70). When the patients receiving or not receiving digitalis were compared by a multiple logistic regression analysis adjusting for 17 independent variables predictive of mortality, the use of digitalis was no longer independently predictive of total mortality (adjusted odds ratio 1.07). These data indicate that patients receiving digitalis had more extensive cardiovascular disease and greater morbidity than patients not receiving digitalis. Their subsequent higher mortality rate was probably related to these factors rather than to digitalis therapy.", 
    "78": "The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of a 20 mg tablet preparation of nifedipine alone in twice daily dosage, in the treatment of moderate hypertension (95 greater than or equal to DBP less than or equal to 115 mmHg). Efficacy was defined as the ability to maintain treatment for 6 months with a fall in DBP of a least 5 mmHg after the first month, and with a DBP 100 mmHg from the second month. One hundred and seventy seven patients were recruited from november 1981 to december 1982, 55% during the first three months of the trial. There were 95 men (54%) and 82 women, with a mean age of 55.6 +/- 10 years. The DBP ranged from 96 to 111 mmHg in 80% of cases. The patients were randomly allocated in lots of 6, to three groups: placebo (58 patients), nifedipine (57 patients) and acebutolol (61 patients). The comparability of 21 parameters amongst these 3 groups was verified. After 1 month of placebo, 25 patients did not meet the criteria of inclusion and were excluded from the study. During this phase, 19 patients (10.5%) complained of at least one side effect. Of the 152 patients who received active treatment, 34 (22.4%) were \"wrongly included\", 17 did not complete the test period for undefined reasons and were considered to have been \"lost to follow-up\", and 6 patients \"deviated\" from the protocol. These 3 groups were taken into account in the statistical analysis of the graphs of non-failure."
