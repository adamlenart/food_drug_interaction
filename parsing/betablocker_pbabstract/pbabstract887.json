    "0": "1. A maintained inflation of the lungs caused a reflex reduction in total systemic vascular resistance in anaesthetized dogs under conditions in which the systemic circulation was perfused at constant blood flow and the arterial blood P(O2) and P(CO2) were maintained constant.2. The fall in systemic arterial perfusion pressure evoked by inflation of the lungs was accompanied by an increase in blood flow to the lower limbs and a reduction in their calculated vascular resistance. Since the fall in resistance occurred when the limb was perfused either at constant pressure or at constant blood flow, it must be due to vasodilatation.3. Lung inflation caused vasodilatation in skin, muscle, and in the splanchnic vascular bed. The responses in vertebral circulation were, however, small and variable.4. The vasodilator responses in the vascular territories studied were reflex in nature, being abolished by cutting the cervical vagosympathetic nerves, in which run the afferent fibres, or by interrupting the sympathetic pathways to the blood vessels.5. In the intact limb, muscle, skin and splanchnic vascular bed, the vasodilator responses to lung inflation were unaffected by atropine or propranolol, but were abolished by hexamethonium, dibenyline and bretylium tosylate, indicating that they were due predominantly to a reduction in the activity in sympathetic adrenergic vasoconstrictor fibres.", 
    "1": "1. Using a sensitive method for detecting and monitoring sweat secretion, a study has been made of the effects of adrenaline and noradrenaline on the cat's pad sweat gland activity in the anaesthetized cat.2. Intravenous or intra-arterial injections of adrenaline or noradrenaline only very occasionally caused these glands to secrete.3. The predominant effect of these drugs on glands which are already secreting in response to plantar nerve stimulation is inhibitory.4. The catecholamine inhibition could be reduced or blocked by phentolamine, but not by propranolol, dibenamine or phenoxybenzamine.5. It is concluded that these glands can be directly activated by intravascular injections of adrenaline or noradrenaline, but that the inhibitory effect of concomitant vasoconstriction usually prevents a response being detected at the skin surface.", 
    "2": "1. Exposure to glass of whole blood from anaesthetized foetal lambs (at 0.6-0.95 of term) causes the rapid development of a potent pulmonary vasodilator agent.2. The formation of the vasodilator agent on exposure to glass, its disappearance with time, and the inhibition of its production by soya bean trypsin inhibitor, suggest that it is bradykinin.3. Small doses of bradykinin ( approximately 1 ng/kg) cause pulmonary vasodilatation on close arterial injection. Neither this, nor the vasodilatation caused by glass-exposed whole blood, are affected by agents which block the vasodilator actions of acetylcholine, isoprenaline or histamine.4. Exposure of foetal plasma and/or red cells to glass rarely caused the development of a pulmonary vasodilator agent. Maternal plasma was always active. Injection of the buffy coat from foetal blood caused pulmonary vasodilatation.5. The capacity of plasma from sheep at different ages to produce kinin(s) was examined by assay on the isolated rat's uterus. In the foetus activity was very low; it increased with age.6. In adolescent lambs 5-14 weeks after birth injection of approximately 10 ng/kg bradykinin into the pulmonary artery caused only a trifling vasodilatation; this was greater when pulmonary vasoconstriction was induced by lung collapse, hypoxaemia and hypercapnia.7. The possible physiological consequences of these findings are discussed.", 
    "3": "1. The splenic artery flow, the splenic weight and the arterial blood pressure were recorded in cats anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone.2. Oscillations in splenic artery flow and splenic weight were observed. Following occlusion and release of the splenic artery, there was a brief increase in flow to above the pre-occlusion level and the oscillations in flow were greatly increased in amplitude. It is suggested that the brief increase is a consequence of the reduction of arterial pressure and that the oscillations are due to synchronization of rhythmic activity of smooth muscle within the spleen.3. Stimulation of the splenic nerves resulted in decreases in splenic artery flow and splenic weight. The size of the responses varied with the frequency of stimulation and maximum responses in both flow and weight were obtained at about 3 impulses/sec.4. After stimulation for 10 min, the splenic weight response was maintained while the flow response showed some recovery towards the control level.5. When the splenic artery flow was reduced to about half the control level for periods up to 2 hr, the flow and weight responses to stimulation of the splenic nerves remained unchanged; the significance of this after a haemorrhage is discussed.6. Intravenous administration of atropine or propranolol did not affect the responses to nerve stimulation. After phenoxybenzamine, nerve stimulation caused a smaller decrease in splenic weight, while the splenic artery flow increased to above the control level. This increase was unaffected by atropine but abolished by propranolol."
