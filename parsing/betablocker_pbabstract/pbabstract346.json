    "1": "Partition studies were performed by means of equilibrium dialysis at 37 degrees C over a broad pH range at a molar propranolol to lipid ratio in the membrane of 10(-6).", 
    "2": "As compared to the standard phosphatidylcholine (PhC)-liposome/buffer partition system PhE and OA have an enhancing effect on the apparent partition coefficient (D) of (RS)-[3H]propranolol between pH 6 and 11. Data analysis with Henderson-Hasselbalch equations revealed that the neutral propranolol has a higher affinity to membranes containing net neutral charged PhE than to pure PhC-liposomes. Net negatively charged PhE seems to have no significant influence on the partitioning. Deprotonated OA caused an increase in the true partition coefficient (P) of the protonated propranolol. Neutral OA showed no influence on the partitioning. From the fit D vs pH curves and from zeta potential measurements of the liposomes the intrinsic pKa values of the membranous lipids were calculated as 7.5 to 7.8 for OA and 9.7 to 9.8 for PhE.", 
    "3": "Since the pKa of membranous OA is close to the physiological pH and D depends on the ionisation state of OA, small pH changes around the physiological pH may cause large differences in drug-lipid membrane interactions.", 
    "4": "The relative contribution of the small and large intestine to paracellular absorption is a subject of some controversy. Direct comparison of paracellular permeability in different epithelia is complicated by variations in junctional density and/or the absorptive surface area.", 
    "5": "This study used a combination of morphometric analyses and in vitro absorption studies to define permeability characteristics in relation to the amount of paracellular pathway present in rat ileum, colon and the model epithelium, Caco-2.", 
    "6": "Mucosal to serosal amplification was higher in ileum (3.9) than colon (1.9) or Caco-2 (1). Tight junctional density (lp) of ileal crypts was approximately 3 fold greater (91 m/cm2) than that measured in ileal villi, colonic surface and crypt cells or Caco-2 monolayers (34-37 m/cm2). However, when the relative contributions of the crypts and villi was taken into account there was no significant difference in the mean lp per mucosal area for the three epithelia studied. Using these data to correct for morphometric differences the permeabilities of a range of small hydrophilic molecules (atenolol, D-PheAsp and PEG oligomers MW 282-634) was measured. Permeability of rat ileum and colon were virtually identical for all compounds studied. In contrast, Caco-2 monolayers showed a significantly lower permeability than intestinal tissues with the difference increasing markedly with molecular size.",

    "11": "Metabolic side-effects of antihypertensive drugs may increase the risk of coronary heart disease despite an adequate blood pressure reduction. Since combinations of different antihypertensive drugs are often necessary and frequently used, we performed a randomized study comparing the effects of a fixed combination of hydrochlorothiazide and sotalol (group A), or hydrochlorothiazide and captopril (group B) on blood pressure and on lipid and glucose metabolism in 40 men with essential hypertension over 1 year. Significant blood pressure reductions (p < 0.001) were achieved in both treatment groups: from 160/105 to 128/88 mmHg in group A (mean doses: hydrochlorothiazide 33 and sotalol 197 mg) and from 162/106 to 135/89 mmHg in group B (hydrochlorothiazide 33 and captopril 64 mg) after 12 months, respectively. No significant changes in body weight were observed in either treatment group. Triglycerides increased (p < 0.05) in both treatment groups (from 183 to 262 mg/dl in A, and from 160 to 196 mg/dl in B) and HDL cholesterol decreased (p < 0.001 and < 0.05) in both groups (from 45.1 to 35.7 mg/dl in A, and from 49.3 to 46.3 mg/dl in B), whereas LDL cholesterol increased significantly (p < 0.05) only in group A from 153 to 164 mg/dl. No significant changes were observed in total cholesterol nor in lipoprotein(a) concentrations in either treatment group. Fasting plasma glucose and hemoglobin A1 increased significantly (p < 0.05) only in group A after 1 year of treatment (from 91.6 to 98.0 mg/dl, and from 6.3 to 6.9%, respectively). Serum levels of creatinine and potassium decreased, and uric acid increased significantly under either combination. Our data show that the diuretic/beta-blocker combination has adverse effects on lipid and glucose metabolism after long-term therapy. The effects of the diuretic/ACE inhibitor combination on lipid metabolism are less pronounced and there are no adverse effects on glucose metabolism. However, the ACE inhibitor component could not completely counteract the metabolic effects of the diuretic. Both combinations have no effects on Lp(a). We conclude that the combination of hydrochlorothiazide with an ACE inhibitor has a better metabolic profile for the treatment of essential hypertension than the combination with a beta-blocker.", 
    "12": "Thirty-seven patients with mild to moderate hypertension were randomized in a double-blind, parallell-group study to receive either 6 mg of spirapril or 50 mg of atenolol. After 6 weeks of treatment, the daily dose of spirapril was increased to 12 mg and the daily dose of atenolol to 100 mg, if the target diastolic pressure < or = 90 mmHg was not achieved. The total treatment period was 12 months for both drugs. There were no changes in the lipid levels in the spirapril treatment group whereas the concentration of apoprotein A1 decreased significantly (p < 0.05) in the group treated with atenolol when compared with baseline. There was a tendency in the levels of serum cholesterol and triglycerides to increase and in the level of HDL cholesterol to decrease in the atenolol treatment group compared with baseline. Fasting blood glucose levels did not change significantly in the treatment group when compared with baseline. The 2-hour blood glucose level in the glucose tolerance test increased significantly after the 12-month therapy with both spirapril (p < 0.05) and atenolol (p < 0.05) when compared with baseline levels. There was also a tendency in the 2-hour insulin levels to increase in both the spirapril and the atenolol treatment group after the 12-month treatment period. In conclusion, spirapril had no effect on lipid metabolism whereas atenolol had some untoward effects. In the group treated with atenolol fasting blood glucose levels increased, but both spirapril and atenolol increased the 2-hour blood glucose levels in the glucose tolerance test.", 
    "13": "gamma 2-Melanocyte-stimulating hormone (gamma 2-MSH) and related melanotropins have been shown to have various cardiovascular effects, including acute, short-lasting increases in blood pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR). gamma 2-MSH, administered intravenously, dose-dependently increased MAP and HR with an ED50 of approximately 30 nmol/kg and a maximal effect on MAP of approximately 55 mm Hg and on HR of around 70 beats per minute. Intravenous (i.v.) pretreatment with the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin, caused the dose-response curve for the effect of gamma 2-MSH on MAP to shift to the right with a decrease in slope, whereas it had no effect on the dose-response curve for the effect on HR. I.v. pretreatment with the beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, metoprolol, had no effect on the dose-response curve for the effect of gamma 2-MSH on MAP, but it caused the dose-response curve for the effect of the peptide on HR to shift to the right with a decrease in slope. Neither i.v. nor intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of the vasopressin V1A receptor antagonist, SR 49059 ((2S) 1-[(2R 3S)-5-chloro-3-(2-chlorophenyl)-1-(3,4-dimethoxy-benzene-sulfonyl)- 3-hydroxy-2,3-dihydro-1H-indole-2-carbonyl]-pyrrolidine-2-carboxamide), had significant effects on the dose-response curves for the effects of the peptide on either MAP or HR. The doses of prazosin, metoprolol and SR 49059 were found to be effective in counteracting the effects of agonists for these receptors (phenylephrine, isoprenaline and [Arg8]vasopressin, respectively). Taken together, these results support the postulate that the effects of gamma 2-MSH are, at least partially, due to an increase in sympathetic outflow to the periphery (Gruber and Callahan (1989), Am J Physiol 257: R681-R694), and that this increase leads to increased activation of vascular alpha 1-adrenoceptors and cardiac beta 1-adrenoceptors. If, as was suggested by these authors, gamma 2-MSH acts via activation of a central vasopressin system, it is via a vasopressin receptor subtype other than the vasopressin V1A receptor, since i.c.v. administration of a selective vasopressin V1A receptor antagonist failed to interfere with the pressor and cardioaccelerator effects of gamma 2-MSH.", 
    "14": "Celiprolol is a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist which has desirable ancillary properties since it is relatively cardioselective and can exert direct vasodilator and bronchodilator effects. Here agonist and antagonist effects of celiprolol at cardiac beta 1- and vascular beta 2-adrenoceptors were determined under in vivo conditions in the rat. All experiments were carried out in catecholamine-depleted, pentobarbital anesthetized and vagotomized rats, placed under artificial respiration. I.v. administrations were made via the femoral vein. Blood pressure was measured from the cannulated right carotid artery and heart rate was recorded with a cardiotachometer. Celiprolol (10 micrograms/kg to 1 mg/kg i.v.) produced dose-related increases in heart rate and decreases in mean carotid artery blood pressure which were of longer duration than those mediated by standard agonists of beta 1-(isoprenaline) or beta 2-(salbutamol) adrenoceptors respectively. Although the maximal increase in heart rate by celiprolol (110 +/- 4 beats/min, n = 7) was approximately half that of isoprenaline (198 +/- 1 beats/min, n = 5), isoprenaline acted at doses 200-fold lower than celiprolol. Betaxolol (0.03-0.3 mg/kg i.v.), a beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, inhibited strongly and with similar potency the tachycardiac effects of celiprolol (DR10 = 45 micrograms/kg i.v.) as well as isoprenaline (DR10 = 45 micrograms/kg i.v.). On the other hand, the hypotensive effects of celiprolol and salbutamol were antagonized markedly and with similar potency by ICI 118,551, a relatively selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist (DR10 = 15 and 25 micrograms/kg i.v. respectively). In rats pretreated with celiprolol (0.03 to 0.3 mg/kg i.v.), the heart rate dose-response curves to isoprenaline were shifted to the right of those determined in matched groups of vehicle-pretreated animals. In this respect, celiprolol was half as potent as betaxolol in blocking cardiac beta 1-adrenoceptors. Furthermore, celiprolol also antagonized the hypotensive effects of salbutamol, but, in this respect, celiprolol was 90-fold less potent than ICI 118,551. In conclusion, these results clearly indicate that celiprolol has the ability of stimulating and blocking not only cardiac beta 1- but also vascular beta 2-adrenoceptors. The effects on cardiac beta 1-adrenoceptors as well as the agonism of beta 2-adrenoceptors are produced by similar doses of celiprolol. These doses are notably lower than those necessary to block beta 2-adrenoceptors. Thus, this pharmacological profile, which has also been demonstrated in humans, indicates that celiprolol is a modulator of cardiac beta 1-adrenoceptors with vascular beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist properties.", 
    "15": "The actions of several serotonergic ligands in use or under development for the treatment of migraine headaches were examined at recombinant human 5-HT1A receptors stably expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. Affinities (K(i)s) at this site were determined in competition binding experiments with [3H]-8-OH-DPAT ([3H](+/-)8-hydroxy-N,N-dipropylaminotetralin), whilst agonist efficacy was measured by stimulation of [35S]-GTP gamma S (guanylyl-5'-[gamma[35S]thio]-triphosphate) binding. Of the prophylactic antimigraine drugs tested, methysergide and lisuride behaved as efficacious agonists (Emax > or = 90% relative to 5-HT) whereas pitozifen and (-)propranolol acted as a partial agonist (60%) and an antagonist, respectively. This suggests that there is no correlation between agonism at 5-HT1A receptors and prophylactic antimigraine action. In contrast, serotonin, dihydroergotamine, sumatriptan, naratriptan and alniditan, which are effective in acute interruption of migraine attacks, each displayed high efficacy (Emax = 100, 100, 92.6, 79.3, 79.1% respectively) and marked affinity (Ki = 18.7, 0.6, 127, 26.4 and 3.0 nM respectively) at 5-HT1A receptors. EC50 values for agonist stimulation of [35S]-GTP gamma S binding correlated with respective Ki values at 5-HT1A receptors (r = 0.93) and the stimulation of [35S]-GTP gamma S binding by these compounds was antagonised by the selective 5-HT1A antagonist WAY 100,635 (N-{2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl}-N-(2-pyridinyl) cyclo-hexanecarboxamide; 100 nM). These data suggest that agonism at 5-HT1A receptors may be involved in some actions of drugs used in acute antimigraine therapy. In comparison with the above compounds, novel ligands targeted at 5-HT1B/1D receptors, such as GR125,743 (N-[4-methoxy-3-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)phenyl] -3-methyl-4-(4-pyridyl)benzamide) and GR 127,935 (N-[4-methoxy-3-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-phenyl]-2'-methyl-4'-(5-m ethyl-1, 2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)-biphenyl-4-carboxamide), only weakly activated [35S]-GTP gamma S binding (32.4 and 32.1% efficacy) and displayed moderate affinity at 5-HT1A receptors (Kis 53.1 and 49.8 nM) suggesting that they constitute useful tools to differentiate 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B/1D receptor-mediated actions. In conclusion, the present data indicates that several antimigraine agents exhibit marked 5-HT1A receptor activity and that although this is unlikely to be important for prophylactic action it may be relevant to the ancilliary properties of drugs used for acute migraine treatment.", 
    "16": "The basic mechanisms that cause aging are still poorly understood. Longitudinal prospective population studies using noninvasive examination techniques have improved our ability to differentiate between aging and disease. This review describes some general morphological and functional aging-related changes of the heart that have clinical relevance, and considers the possibility of drug treatment for the manifestations of aging per se. Digitalis has not been shown to improve the aging-related decline in myocardial strength and contractility. During aging, heart tissue stiffens and the speed and extent of diastolic filling decline. The latter is a limiting functional factor, particularly during increases in heart rate. Lowering peripheral vascular resistance, which is often increased in older people, might indirectly improve heart function. However, no drug has been shown to improve myocardial strength or lower tissue stiffness via a direct effect on the heart. It has been claimed, however, that calcium antagonists might improve diastolic filling. Morphological changes during aging are dominated by some left ventricular wall and septal hypertrophy, and left atrial and ventricular widening. Recent findings have suggested that angiotensin II might act as a growth stimulating factor, promoting cardiac hypertrophy. This has led to speculation that ACE inhibitors might contribute to the restructuring of the heart, not only in hypertension but also in patients with the common combination of slightly elevated blood pressure and aging-related myocardial hypertrophy. At present, it appears that improving exogenous factors (e.g. lifestyle, living circumstances and access to adequate medical care) offers greater opportunities for postponing cardiac aging than drugs that directly interfere with the physiological aging of the heart.", 
    "17": "Digitalis has been widely used in the treatment of cardiac disease for more than 200 years. The present article reviews the current role of digitalis in the management of heart failure and atrial fibrillation (AF) in light of recent study findings. Generally, first-line therapy for the management of heart failure due to systolic dysfunction should include an ACE inhibitor and a diuretic. In patients who remain symptomatic despite the use of these drugs, the addition of digoxin should be considered. Because digoxin has been shown to reduce the number of hospital admissions attributable to worsening heart failure, more liberal use of digoxin in the management of heart failure may be justified. Digoxin may be adequate as monotherapy for ventricular rate control in patients with chronic AF, particularly in sedentary and elderly patients. A beta-blocker or calcium antagonist (either alone or in combination with digoxin) is indicated when digoxin is ineffective for ventricular rate control. Digoxin is ineffective in restoring sinus rhythm, preventing paroxysms or controlling rate in paroxysmal AF. The elderly are at an increased risk of digoxin toxicity. Low dosages of digoxin appear to be effective in the treatment of heart failure due to systolic dysfunction and may reduce the incidence of digitalis toxicity in these patients. In elderly patients with AF and inadequate rate control who are receiving digitalis monotherapy, adding another atrioventricular nodal blocking drug may be more appropriate than increasing the digoxin dose, in order to avoid toxic digoxin levels.", 
    "18": "Obesity can modify the pharmacokinetics of lipophilic drugs. As beta-adrenoceptor blockers (BB) are often prescribed for obese patients suffering from hypertension or coronary heart disease, this study compares the pharmacokinetics of lipophilic beta-adrenoceptor blockers in obese and control subjects.", 
    "19": "Nine obese (157 +/- 24% of ideal body weight (IBW) mean +/- s.d.) and nine non-obese healthy volunteers (98 +/- 10% IBW), aged 32 +/- 9 years, were included in the study. Subjects were randomly given a single i.v. infusion of one of the following racemic beta-adrenoceptor blockers, whose doses (expressed as base per kg of IBW) were: propranolol (0.108 mg), labetalol (0.99 mg) and nebivolol (0.073 mg). The plasma concentrations of unchanged drugs were measured by h.p.l.c. The ionisation constants and lipophilicity parameters of beta-adrenoceptor blockers were assessed.", 
    "20": "The pharmacokinetic data for the three drugs were qualitatively similar. There was a trend towards a greater total distribution volume (Vss) in obese patients than in controls. However, Vss expressed per kg body weight was slightly smaller in obese patients. The relationship between Vss and lipophilicity of five beta-adrenoceptor was studied by combining the current results with those previously obtained with a moderately lipophilic drug (bisoprolol) and a hydrophilic one (sotalol). The Vss of the five drugs was positively and well-correlated (r2 = 0.90; P < 0.01) with their distribution coefficient at pH 7.4 (log D7.4), but not with their partition coefficients. The linear regression coefficients for lean and obese subjects were very similar.", 
    "21": "Lipophilic beta-adrenoceptor blockers seem to diffuse less into adipose than into lean tissues. All electrical forms of the drugs (i.e. cations, neutral forms, or zwitterions) present at physiological pH contribute to their tissue distribution, in both obese and lean subjects. Their tissue distribution in obese patients could be restricted by the sum of hydrophobic forces and hydrogen bonds they elicit with macromolecules in lean tissues.", 
    "22": "Although many of the behavioral effects of cocaine are widely believed to be mediated by blockade of dopamine transporters, recent studies suggest that norepinephrine (NE) may play a modulatory role. In this study, selective and nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists were administered alone or in combination with cocaine (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) to rats trained to discriminate a low dose (2.5 mg/kg) from a high dose of cocaine (10 mg/kg) in a two-lever, FR10 drug discrimination procedure. The central beta 2/beta 1-adrenergic antagonists (-)-propranolol and tertatolol, and the beta 2-adrenergic antagonist, ICI 118,551, produced high-dose appropriate responding in a dose-related manner when administered (i.p.) in combination with the low training dose of cocaine. In contrast, neither the peripheral beta 2/beta 1-adrenergic antagonist, nadolol, nor the central beta 1-adrenergic antagonist, beta-xolol enhanced the behavioral effects of the low dose of cocaine in a manner comparable with that produced by compounds with central beta 2-adrenergic antagonist properties. Also in contrast to findings obtained using beta-adrenergic antagonists, neither the alpha 1-adrenergic agonist cirazoline, nor the alpha 2-adrenergic ligands (+/-)-efaroxan and UK-14304 enhanced the behavioral effects of the low dose of cocaine. Overall, these results suggest that central beta 2-adrenergic receptors may play a modulatory role in the discriminative stimulus effects of cocaine.", 
    "23": "The effects of aging and diabetes on the distribution of beta-adrenoceptor subtypes in the gut were investigated in the BB rat. [125I]Cyanopindolol binding to 10-micron sections was evaluated using film autoradiography. Cyanopindolol binding to beta-, beta 1-, and beta 2-adrenoceptors was displaced by 1 microM propranolol, 50 nM ICI-89-406, and 100 nM ICI-118-551, respectively. beta-Adrenoceptor binding was highest in the circular muscle of proximal colon and lowest in the pylorus of 4- to 5-month-old rats. Aging (8- to 10-month-old vs. 4- to 5-month-old rats) was associated with increased beta-adrenoceptor binding in the pylorus and reduced binding in the proximal colon. Diabetes had a time-dependent effect on the level of beta-adrenoceptor binding. It was increased in the antral and pyloric stomach but longer periods of diabetes caused a reduction in beta-adrenoceptor binding in the pylorus. Those in the intestine were reduced time-dependently and involved beta 1- or beta 2-adrenoceptors or both.", 
    "24": "Surgical sympathectomy can relieve symptoms of angina in patients with refractory angina. However, in these high-risk patients this thoracic surgery may result in significant morbidity and mortality rates. Similar sympathetic blockade can now be produced with high thoracic epidural analgesia (HTEA). From September 1995 to August 1996, we treated 10 consecutive patients with HTEA. These eight men and two women, aged 58 +/- 5 years, with extensive three-vessel coronary disease and ejection fractions of 40% +/- 5%, had New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV angina despite medical therapy, including nitrates, beta-blockade, calcium channel blockade, and narcotics. HTEA was performed at the T1 through T4 levels with a catheter placed either percutaneously or surgically, with radiographic confirmation of catheter placement with an epidurogram or computed tomography scan. Bupivacaine (0.25% to 0.5%), an amide local anesthetic, was given as a bolus through the epidural catheter and then maintained either as a continuous infusion or an intermittent rebolus. The epidural catheter remained in place for 7 days in four patients, 14 days in three patients, and > or =90 days in three patients. Before consideration for HTEA, each patient was deemed unsuitable for or refused coronary bypass surgery and percutaneous coronary angioplasty and had NYHA class IV symptoms of angina. Seven of 10 patients required intravenous nitroglycerin and heparin and were unable to be discharged from the intensive care unit because of anginal symptoms. Two of these seven patients also required an intraaortic balloon pump for symptom control. After HTEA, all 10 patients had improved symptoms, with five patients improving to NYHA class II symptoms and five improving to NYHA class III. All seven patients receiving intravenous nitroglycerin, heparin, or intraaortic balloon pump support had these modalities discontinued. Six of these seven patients were subsequently discharged from the hospital. One patient died from a non-HTEA related cause. There were no HTEA-related deaths. There were three catheter-related complications necessitating catheter removal during 12 months of HTEA use. Local infection developed in one patient, one had catheter occlusion caused by fibrosis, and one patient had chronic back pain exacerbation from a paraspinous muscle spasm. No patient had a myocardial infarction or a significant arrhythmia. In patients with otherwise intractable angina pectoris, HTEA is an effective modality that produces symptomatic relief of angina pectoris and allows increased activity level.", 
    "25": "Several drugs are apparently effective in treating pathologic anger and aggression. Because many of the studies on aggressive populations allowed the use of concomitant medications, it is unclear whether the efficacy of each drug in a particular population is dependent on the presence of other medications, such as antipsychotic agents. Finally, one needs to be circumspect in inferring efficacy of a particular drug in aggressive patients with neuropsychiatric conditions other than the ones in which some efficacy has been established. Lithium appears to be an effective treatment of aggression among nonepileptic prison inmates, mentally retarded and handicapped patients, and among conduct-disordered children with explosive behavior. Certainly, lithium would be the treatment of choice in bipolar patients with excessive irritability and anger outbursts, and it has been shown to be effective in this population. Anticonvulsant medications are the treatment of choice for patients with outbursts of rage and abnormal EEG findings. The efficacy of these drugs in patients without a seizure disorder, however, remains to be established, with the exception perhaps of valproate and carbamazepine. In fact, dyphenylhydantoin did not appear to be effective in treating aggressive behavior in children with temper tantrums and was found to be effective in only a prison population. There is some evidence for the efficacy of carbamazepine and valproate in treating pathologic aggression in patients with dementia, organic brain syndrome, psychosis, and personality disorders. As Yudofsky et al point out in their review of the literature, although traditional antipsychotic drugs have been used widely to treat aggression, there is little evidence for their effectiveness in treating aggression beyond their sedative effect in agitated patients or their antiaggressive effect among patients whose aggression is related to active psychosis. Antipsychotic agents appear to be effective in treating psychotic aggressive patients, conduct-disordered children, and mentally retarded patients, with only modest effects in the management of pathologic aggression in patients with dementia. Furthermore, at least in one study, these drugs were found to be associated with increased aggressiveness in mentally retarded subjects. On the other hand, atypical antipsychotic agents (i.e., clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine) may be more effective than traditional antipsychotic drugs in aggressive and violent populations, as they have shown efficacy in patients with dementia, brain injury, mental retardation, and personality disorders. Similarly, benzodiazepines can reduce agitation and irritability in elderly and demented populations, but they also can induce behavioral disinhibition. Therefore, one should be careful in using this class of drugs in patients with pathologic aggression. Beta-blockers appear to be effective in many different neuropsychiatric conditions. These drugs seem effective in reducing violent and assaultive behavior in patients with dementia, brain injury, schizophrenia, mental retardation, and organic brain syndrome. As pointed out by Campbell et al in their review of the literature, however, systematic research is lacking, and little is known about the efficacy and safety of beta-blockers in children and adolescents with pathologic aggression. Although widely used in the management of pathologic aggression, the use of this class of drugs has been limited partially by marked hypotension and bradycardia, which are side effects common at the higher doses. The usefulness of the antihypertensive drug clonidine in the treatment of pathologic aggression has not been assessed adequately, and only marginal benefits were observed with this drug in irritable autistic and conduct disorder children. Psychostimulants seem to be effective in reducing aggressiveness in brain-injured patients as well as in violent adolescents with oppositional or conduct disorders, particu", 
    "26": "The present study deals with the effects of withdrawal of dopamine (DA) on the translocation of protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes and release of prolactin (Prl) in resting- and substance P (SP)-stimulated cultures of enriched rat pituitary lactotrophs. Following a brief tonic input (10 min), DA withdrawal induced a redistribution of PKC alpha- and beta-immunoreactivity (IR) to the particulate fraction with maximal levels, attained after 5 min, remaining translocated for 20 min. DA withdrawal prolonged the effect of SP-induced translocation of PKC alpha- and beta-IR. Similar effects were detected when the catalytic activity of PKC in response to DA withdrawal was evaluated. Thus, DA washout redistributed PKC catalytic activity and prolonged the effect of SP on catalytical PKC translocation to the particulate fraction. Pretreatment of cells with the protein kinase A inhibitor, rp-adenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphothionate (rp-cAMP), reduced the amount of PKC alpha- and beta-IR redistributed after DA withdrawal. Furthermore, this treatment also reduced the DA withdrawal effect on SP-mediated translocation of PKC alpha- and beta-IR. Methoxyverapamil, a blocker of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, completely inhibited the redistribution of PKC isozymes after DA withdrawal, but also reduced the potentiating effect of DA withdrawal on SP-induced redistribution of PKC isozyme-IR. In perifused enriched lactotrophs, DA withdrawal induced a release of Prl that lasted 45-55 min and prolonged the effect of SP on Prl secretion. rp-cAMP did not significantly affect Prl release due to DA removal, but the prolonging effect of DA withdrawal on SP-induced Prl secretion was abolished. Methoxyverapamil completely abolished the rebound release of Prl after DA withdrawal, and the potentiating effect of DA removal on SP-mediated Prl release was also diminished. Readdition of DA after DA withdrawal was able to suppress the translocation of PKC isozyme-IR and catalytic activity and to reduce the release of Prl to baseline levels. Moreover, readdition of DA reduced the potentiating effects of DA withdrawal on the same parameters after SP-stimulation of cells. On the basis of these results it is concluded that in resting cells following DA withdrawal prolactin is released and specific PKC isozymes and concomitant catalytic activity are translocated to the particulate fraction in enriched lactotrophs. While cAMP/PKA and influx of Ca2+ seem to work in concert in translocating PKC, influx of Ca2+ is the primary mechanism responsible for the rebound release of Prl after DA withdrawal. DA withdrawal exerts a potentiating effect on SP-induced PKC translocation and Prl release. It is suggested that the biochemical events involved in these processes are cAMP/PKA and Ca2+ influx.", 
    "27": "1. Previous studies indicate that prostacyclin (PGI2) increases the activity of baroreceptor afferent fibres. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that PGI2 inhibits Ca(2+)-activated K+ current (IK(Ca))in isolated baroreceptor neurones in culture. 2. Rat aortic baroreceptor neurones in the nodose ganglia were labelled in vivo by applying a fluorescent dye (DiI) to the aortic arch 1-2 weeks before dissociation of the neurones. Outward K+ currents in baroreceptor neurones evoked by depolarizing voltage steps from a holding potential of -40 mV were recorded using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. 3. Exposure of baroreceptor neurones to the stable PGI2 analogue carbacyclin significantly inhibited the steady-state K+ current in a dose-dependent and reversible manner. The inhibition of K+ current was not caused indirectly by changes in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. The Ca(2+)-activated K+ channel blocker charybdotoxin (ChTX, 10(-7) M) also inhibited the K+ current. In the presence of ChTX or in the absence of Ca2+, carbacyclin failed to inhibit the residual K+ current. Furthermore, in the presence of high concentrations of carbacyclin, ChTX did not cause further reduction of K+ current. 4. Carbacyclin-induced inhibition of IK(Ca) was mimicked by 8-bromo-cAMP and by activation of G-protein with GTP gamma S. The inhibitory effect of carbacyclin on IK(Ca) was abolished by GDP beta S, which blocks G-protein activation, and by a selective inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, PKI5-24. 5. The results demonstrate that carbacyclin inhibits ChTX-sensitive IK(Ca) in isolated aortic baroreceptor neurones by a G-protein-coupled activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. This mechanism may contribute to the PGI2-induced increase in baroreceptor activity demonstrated previously.", 
    "28": "Previous studies have shown that beta 1 selective agents have fewer adverse effects on exercise metabolism than nonselective beta blockers, and this has been attributed to their reduced blockade of beta 2 receptors. This study aimed at determining whether a beta blocker with partial agonist activity at beta 1 and beta 2 receptors (celiprolol) was better than a conventional beta 1 receptor-blocker (atenolol) in prolonging exercise capabilities.", 
    "29": "After four days of treatment with celiprolol 200 mg, atenolol 50 mg, or placebo, 22 healthy volunteers exercised on a treadmill for two hours at 50% of their maximal oxygen uptake. Resting heart rate and blood pressure were recorded before and after exercise. During exercise, fat oxidation, plasma free fatty acids, glycerol, glucose, and ammonia were measured together with heart rate and perceived exertion.", 
    "30": "Mean exercising heart rate was significantly lower in those taking either of the beta blockers than in those taking placebo, and significantly lower for those taking atenolol rather than celiprolol. Fat oxidation was significantly lower for those taking celiprolol (38.8 (SD 12.2)%, P < 0.01) and atenolol (36.6 (15.9)%, P < 0.01) compared with placebo (45.6 (14.1)%). For the first 15 minutes of exercise, fat oxidation was significantly lower for those taking atenolol (24.6 (12.8)%, P < 0.01) than celiprolol (29.6 (14.3)%). The rise in plasma free fatty acids and glycerol during exercise was also significantly attenuated by both beta blockers in comparison with the rise in those taking placebo (P < 0.01).", 
    "31": "Both celiprolol and atenolol reduced fat oxidation compared with placebo. For the first 15 minutes of exercise fat oxidation was preserved by celiprolol, but not atenolol. This preservation of fat oxidation during the early part of exercise may confer some small benefit to patients who take beta blockers and intend to exercise regularly. However, we did not detect significant differences between atenolol and celiprolol in overall mean fat oxidation or perceived exertion in this study.", 
    "32": "The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of Borg's rating of perceived exertion (RPE) scale to predict maximal exercise levels to control exercise intensity in patients taking atenolol for the treatment of essential hypertension. Normally, a standard formula (220-age) is used for calculating a percentage of exercise intensity, but beta blockade can cause reductions in maximal heart rate of between 20 and 30%.", 
    "33": "Patients were split into a control group-10 men and 10 women, aged 50 (SD 12) and 46 (9) respectively, who had risk factors for cardiovascular disease but were not taking any drugs, and a treatment group-11 men and 11 women, aged 53 (13) and 55 (13) respectively, who were established on 25-100 mg of atenolol. All patients performed two submaximal tests on a cycle ergometer. Test 1 was an estimation test, during which the RPE was reported for each increment in work rate. Test 2 was an RPE production test, during which the patient regulated the work rate according to his/her perception of effort at four predetermined points on the RPE scale (RPE 9, 13, 15, 17).", 
    "34": "In both tests the individual correlations (r) between RPE, heart rate, and work rate ranged from 0.96 to 0.99. Analysis of variance showed no significant difference in maximal heart rate and maximal power output for the control group when predicted from the regression lines of RPE versus heart rate and RPE versus power output in the estimation test. However, the prediction of maximal power output was lower in the women in the control group and patients in the treatment group when this was predicted from the effort production protocol (P < 0.01). When exercise intensity at each RPE was expressed relative to maximal power output there were no differences between treatment and control groups.", 
    "35": "The findings from this study confirmed the strong positive relation between RPE, heart rate, and work rate in these patients in both passive effort estimation and active effort production protocols. However, caution in applying these procedures is required because the prediction of maximal exercise levels may be lower when effort production procedures are used.", 
    "36": "Previous reports have suggested that dl-propranolol (PRL) suppresses DNA synthesis by blocking cAMP-mediated signaling in rat liver after partial hepatectomy (PH). Here, we examined if PRL negatively regulates the expression of genes involved in cell cycle progression. Immunoblotting assays showed that the protein levels of cyclins A and E, Cdk2, p21WAF1, and p27KIP1 did not significantly change in liver tissues from either vehicle- or PRL-injected rats after PH. However, the levels of PCNA and PCNA-mRNA markedly decreased in the remnant liver in response to PRL-injection. Similarly, PCNA-CRE binding activity of nuclear 43kDa CREB was suppressed, although the protein levels were not altered. We suggest that PRL negatively regulates the PCNA-gene transcription by interfering with the cAMP/PKA-mediated induction of CREB binding to the CRE-sequences and thereby suppresses DNA synthesis in regenerating rat liver.",

Toxicity was produced by perfusing the hearts with PROP (5 micrograms/mL) for 30 minutes. Subsequently, the hearts were treated for 30 minutes with buffer containing PROP plus experimental treatment. Three treatments were chosen: hypertonic sodium (Na) (160 mmol), to stimulate Na-Ca exchange, dantrolene (DAN) (10 mumol), to inhibit Ca release from sarcoplasmic reticulum, and combined hypertonic Na and DAN. The hearts were paced after 20 minutes of treatment. Heart rate (HR), left ventricular peak systolic pressure (LVP), the first derivative of LVP (dP/dt), and coronary flow were measured.", 
    "39": "PROP decreased HR and rendered the hearts refractory to pacing. PROP did not alter dP/dt. PROP increased LVP consistent with increased cytosolic Ca. Combined hypertonic Na and DAN treatment restored the ability to pace PROP-toxic hearts to the basal HR. Individually, hypertonic Na or DAN treatment partially restored the ability to pace toxic hearts. As experimental treatments increased HR, dP/dt and LVP decreased, consistent with decreased cytosolic Ca availability.",

Dissolution was performed by the USP monograph method on four formulations of metoprolol tartrate tablets (Lopressor plus fast, medium, and slow dissolving test formulations). Three general approaches to compare dissolution profiles were examined; they were ANOVA-based, model-independent, and model-dependent approaches. It is concluded that model-independent approaches and several model-dependent approaches yielded numerical results that can serve as objective and quantitative metrics for comparing entire dissolution profiles of the four metoprolol tartrate formulations. However, these methods presented complications. Some metrics were dependent on the length of the dissolution profile and the sampling scheme. Results from the pairwise procedures also depended on the pairing assignment of individual profiles. In spite of complications, these methods suggested wide dissolution specification limits. Wide dissolution specifications were rationalized through an analysis of in vitro-in vivo relationships, which indicated metoprolol dissolution from these formulations was not the rate-limiting step; hence, a range of dissolution profiles can be expected to yield equivalent plasma profiles.",

Heart rate, blood pressure, intraocular pressure, and ocular perfusion were measured at baseline, and then 30 minutes and 2 hours after treatment. Ocular perfusion was measured by Heidelberg Retina Flowmeter (Heidelberg Engineering GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany). We used 10 degrees measurement field and 10 x 10 pixels measurement frame. Four areas were measured, i.e., temporal upper, temporal lower, and nasal parts of the optic disc, and macula. In comparison to the baseline, the treated eyes had a slight reduction of blood flow, volume, and velocity 30 minutes after treatment, but these parameters came back close to the baseline value at 2 hours after treatment.

The number of human subjects noting pain upon instillation of various concentrations of sulfacetamide (3) was compared to the blinking responses of guinea pigs treated with 2.5%-17.5% sulfacetamide. The number of blinks was counted over a period of 5 minutes following (1) saline (0.9% NaCl), and (2) 30-60 minutes later a test solution.

The dose/response curves of both humans and guinea pigs were almost identical, showing a threshold at 5% sulfacetamide, followed by a linear increase, reaching a maximum at 12.5%-15% sulfacetamide. A 2.5% solution that elicited pain in 10% of human subjects yielded a B.I. = 1.04 +/- 0.05, whereas a 12.5% solution that elicited pain in 95% of human subjects yielded a B.I. = 1.61 +/- 0.13 (mean +/- S.E., n = 10, P < 0.05).

The positive chronotropic and inotropic effects of dobutamine induce myocardial ischaemia if significant coronary artery obstruction is present.

Most dobutamine stress protocols start at an infusion rate of 5 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 and increase to a peak dose of 40 or 50 micrograms.kg-1.min-1; to further increase heart rate, a bolus injection of 0.25-1.0 mg atropine is added. Test endpoints are the detection of new wall motion abnormalities, the occurrence of severe complications or achievement of the target heart rate. Viable myocardial regions have a positive inotropic reserve, which can be stimulated by dobutamine and detected by echocardiography. Indications for the use of dobutamine stress echocardiography are to prove stress-inducible myocardial ischaemia and to detect myocardial viability.

We have previously shown that continuous exposure to the beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, salbutamol inhibits mitogen-induced proliferation of airway smooth muscle cells. In the present study, the effects of variable durations and repeated periods of exposure to beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists on DNA synthesis in human cultured airway smooth muscle have been investigated to model some of the possible pharmacokinetic profiles of these agents following inhalation. DNA synthesis was measured by [3H]-thymidine incorporation. 2. Shorter periods of exposure (up to 2.5 h) of airway smooth muscle cells to salbutamol (100 nM) commencing 30 min before thrombin (0.3 u ml-1) stimulation had no effect on the subsequent increase in [3H]-thymidine incorporation. However, inhibition by salbutamol was evident with a 4.5 h exposure and was maximal after an 8.5 h exposure. Similar patterns of results were observed when fenoterol (100 nM) was used in place of salbutamol as the beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist or when epidermal growth factor (300 pM) was used in place of thrombin as the mitogen. Salbutamol had no effect on thrombin-stimulated [3H]-leucine incorporation after 8.5 h of exposure, but a statistically significant effect was observed after 48 h of exposure. 3. Experiments in which DNA synthesis was measured up to 52 h after the addition of thrombin indicated that exposure to salbutamol during the first 8 h of mitogen stimulation delayed rather than inhibited the DNA synthesis. 4. Addition of salbutamol (100 nM) at different times either before or up to 24 h after the addition of thrombin indicated that [3H]-thymidine incorporation (measured between 24 and 28 h after thrombin) could be significantly attenuated when salbutamol was added as late as 18 h after the addition of thrombin. 5. The effects of more prolonged exposure to salbutamol were investigated by the addition of salbutamol for either 15 or 24 h per day for a total of 3 days. There were no significant differences in the level of inhibition of thrombin-stimulated [3H]-thymidine incorporation between continuous and intermittent salbutamol over the 3 day period and the inhibition was also not different to that achieved with a single continuous exposure to salbutamol over 28 h. 6. These results indicate that although exposure to beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists during the first 8 h of mitogen stimulation does not have a sustained inhibitory effect on DNA synthesis, repeated intermittent or prolonged continuous exposures to salbutamol do inhibit DNA synthesis, without evidence of marked desensitization.",

    "95": "To examine the physiological role of melatonin in sleep, nocturnal melatonin secretion was suppressed using 100 mg oral atenolol in two studies. In Study 1, nocturnal sleep was recorded in 8 young men over 4 nights. Subjects received atenolol on one of the last 2 nights and showed significantly increased total wake time (TWT) and wakefulness after sleep onset (WASO), as well as decreased REM sleep and slow-wave sleep (SWS). When melatonin (total 5 mg) was given after atenolol on the other night, the changes in TWT, WASO, REM, and SWS were reversed. In Study 2, sleep onset latencies (SOL) and core temperature (Tc) of 10 young men were measured for 3 nonconsecutive nights. In a cross-over design, atenolol given on one night significantly suppressed urinary 6-sulphatoxymelatonin (6s-aMT) production and increased hourly measures of Tc and SOL relative to baseline night values. Oral melatonin (3 mg), administered after atenolol, reversed the changes in Tc and SOL. These results suggest that endogenous melatonin may assist in the maintenance of normal sleep architecture (Study 1) and also increase nocturnal sleep propensity by hypothermic effects (Study 2).",

The method is based on a loop-type interface and concurrent eluent evaporation technique. On-line liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) is used to extract the analytes from aqueous eluent to organic solvent before injection onto the GC, and the two phases are separated with a sandwich-type phase separator. The LC is used for cleanup, and the GC is used for the final separation and detection of the analytes. Total analysis time is less than 45 min, which is much less than those of traditional analysis methods. Recoveries in LC cleanup and on-line LLE are excellent. A marked increase in the recoveries with on-line LLE is obtained by heating the aqueous eluent and the extraction coil. Linearity and repeatability of the method are good for both serum and urine, and the limits of quantitation for the analytes are 18-44 ng/mL.", 
    "101": "The purposes of these studies were: 1) to determine the effects of various doses of propranolol, a nonspecific beta-adrenergic antagonist, on ventilation, oxygen consumption, and body temperature in hamsters, and 2) to test the hypothesis that in hamsters the stimulatory effects of naloxone, an opioid receptor antagonist, on ventilation and oxygen consumption occur, at least in part, through the release of catecholamines that act via beta-adrenergic receptors. Propranolol, a non-specific beta adrenergic receptor antagonist, at a 20 mg/kg depressed body temperature, oxygen consumption, tidal volume, and ventilation relative to saline. The lower dose of 10 mg/kg had only transitory effects on tidal volume at 60 min and ventilation at 30 min post-injection-Naloxone (1 mg/kg) relative to saline stimulated ventilation and oxygen consumption. These effects were blocked by propranolol pretreatment. The results of these experiments demonstrate that in the hamster, 1) body temperature, oxygen consumption, and ventilation appear to be modulated by beta-adrenergic receptors, and 2) the stimulatory effects of naloxone on oxygen consumption and ventilation may occur through the interaction of endogenous opioids and beta-adrenergic receptor systems.", 
    "102": "Previous studies have shown that glutathione (GSH) plays a central role in the protection against peroxynitrite (ONOO-) toxicity. The present study evaluated the changes of the GSH cytoprotective system against ONOO- in hypercholesterolemia and determined the effects of carvedilol, a beta-blocker with free radical-scavenging activity, on these hypercholesterol-induced changes. New Zealand White rabbits were fed either a normal diet, a high-cholesterol diet, or a high-cholesterol diet supplemented with either carvedilol or propranolol. Eight weeks later, the rabbits were killed, and the thoracic aortas were isolated. Total GSH content of aortic tissue, vasorelaxation response of aortic rings to exogenous ONOO-, No regeneration from ONOO- by aortic homogenate, and ONOO(-)-induced aortic tissue injury were examined. Hypercholesterolemia decreased tissue GSH content (0.52 +/- 0.08 versus 0.86 +/- 0.04 mumol/g in control, P < .01), attenuated the vasorelaxation response to ONOO- (40 +/- 4.1% versus 76 +/- 3.2%, P < .01), reduced NO regeneration from ONOO- (387 +/- 40 versus 662 +/- 51 pmol, P < .01), and potentiated ONOO(-)-induced vascular tissue injury (37 +/- 4.4% versus 14 +/- 2.6% of increase in lactate dehydrogenase release after 3-morpholinosydnonimine exposure, P < .01). Treatment of the hypercholesterolemic rabbits with carvedilol, but not propranolol, significantly preserved tissue GSH content (0.79 +/- 0.05 mumol/g, P < .01 versus nontreated hypercholesterolemic rabbits), restored the vasorelaxation to ONOO- (61 +/- 2%, P < .01), increased NO regeneration from ONOO- (583 +/- 39 pmol, P < .01), and attenuated ONOO(-)-induced tissue injury (19 +/- 1.8%, P < .01). These results suggest that hypercholesterolemia impairs the GSH-mediated detoxification mechanism against ONOO- and renders the vascular tissue more susceptible to oxidative injury. Carvedilol, a novel vasodilating beta-blocker with antioxidant activity, significantly preserved this self-defense system and protected tissue from oxidant injury.", 
    "103": "In this report, we have examined the radioligand binding and second messenger signalling characteristics of beta-adrenoceptors in the guinea-pig brain. [125I]-Iodocyanopindolol ([125I]ICYP)-labelled sites in the cerebellum and cerebral cortex were of similar densities (Bmax 34 and 24 fmol x mg(-1)) and affinities (K(D) 20 and 55 pM), respectively. Analysis of competition for [125I]ICYP binding in the cerebellum was compatible with the presence of a beta2-adrenoceptor. In this tissue, isoprenaline evoked a cyclic AMP stimulation, and also potentiated cyclic GMP accumulations evoked in the presence of a nitric oxide donor, consistent with mediation via a beta2-adrenoceptor. The [125I]ICYP binding profile in the cerebral cortex did not comply with those previously described for beta-adrenoceptor subtypes, and isoprenaline failed to alter significantly cyclic AMP accumulation in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, or neostriatum, even in the presence of forskolin or a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Isoprenaline was also without effect on cyclic GMP accumulation or phosphoinositide turnover in the cerebral cortex. These results suggest that the guinea-pig cerebellum expresses a functional beta2-adrenoceptor coupled to cyclic AMP generation, and potentiation of cyclic GMP accumulation. However, the guinea-pig cerebral cortex displays binding sites that exhibit beta-adrenoceptor-like pharmacology but fail to show functional coupling to cyclic AMP, cyclic GMP, or phosphoinositide signalling systems.", 
    "104": "The sulfur-containing amino acid homocysteic acid (HCA) is present in and released from nervous tissue, exerting excitatory effects on neurons by predominantly activating NMDA receptors. It is interesting that HCA appears to be exclusively localized in glial cells, not in neurons. This profile of glial localization and excitatory action on neurons has led to the hypothesis that HCA could participate in intercellular communication in the brain as a \"gliotransmitter.\" To test this hypothesis further, we searched for specific, receptor-mediated stimuli that could induce release of HCA from cultured astrocytes. For this reason we tested the effect of noradrenaline and vasoactive intestinal peptide, two transmitters known to interact with specific receptors on astrocytes, on the release of HCA from these cells. Noradrenaline and the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol induced an efflux of HCA from astrocyte cultures. Further stressing the beta-adrenergic mediation of this effect is the blockade by atenolol of the HCA release evoked by isoproterenol. The stimulation of HCA release from astrocytes was not observed with the alpha-noradrenergic agonist methoxamine and with vasoactive intestinal peptide. These results taken together further strengthen the role of HCA as a gliotransmitter. Its efflux from glia could be controlled by noradrenaline, activating beta-adrenergic receptors on astrocytes. The present study provides the first evidence for an influence of beta-adrenergic receptor activation on the release of an excitatory amino acid from astrocytes and further supports the notion that glial-neuronal interactions play a role in synaptic transmission.", 
    "105": "Lysosomes, isolated from rat liver after 70% partial hepatectomy (PHX), were found, by Western blotting, to contain a considerable amount of serum albumin. The level of intralysosomal serum albumin after PHX showed biphasic patterns: it increased immediately after PHX, peaked at 30 min, rapidly declined within a few hours, rose again with a peak at 15 hr, and gradually declined thereafter. At 15 hr after PHX, the content of lysosomal proteins in the liver increased to twice the level of unoperated control, and the electron-microscopic observation of the isolated lysosomes revealed numerous large membrane-delimited structures with ground substances of variable electron opacities. The increase in the intralysosomal serum albumin at 30 min and 15 hr was accompanied by changes in the buoyant densities of endosomes in Percoll density gradients. At both time points, the density profiles of endosomes isolated from hepatectomized rats shifted to the denser direction, suggesting that PHX activates fusion and/or maturation of endosomes. Formaldehyde-treated bovine serum albumin is known to be taken up by the liver by receptor-mediated endocytosis. The uptake of the modified heterologous albumin was shown to be activated as early as 30 min after PHX. Both the uptake of serum albumin into lysosomes and the shift of buoyant density profile of endosomes after PHX were inhibited by the administration of adrenergic receptor antagonists, particularly by the alpha r-antagonist prazosin. Further, the concentration of catecholamines in rat serum, particularly that of norepinephrine, was found to increase immediately after PHX, relative to that in serum from sham-operated rats. These results suggest that the elevation of serum norepinephrine levels after PHX activates endocytosis and facilitates delivery of endocytosed serum albumin to lysosomes, where albumin is digested to yield amino acids for possible use in protein synthesis during liver regeneration.", 
    "106": "Insulin-like growth factor-1, IGF-1, is believed to be an important anabolic modulator of cartilage metabolism whose action is mediated by high affinity cell surface receptors and bioactivity and bioavailability regulated, in part, by IGF-1 binding proteins (IGFBPs). Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) stimulates collagen and proteoglycan synthesis in cartilage via an autocrine feedback loop involving IGF-1. We determined whether the eicosanoid could regulate IGFBP-4, a major form expressed by chondrocytes and, as such, act as a modifier of IGF-1 action at another level. Using human articular chondrocytes in high-density primary culture, Western and Western ligand blotting to measure secreted IGFBP-4 protein, and Northern analysis to monitor IGFBP-4 mRNA levels, we demonstrated that PGE2 provoked a 2.7 +/- 0.3- and 3.8 +/- 0.5- (n = 3) fold increase in IGFBP-4 mRNA and protein, respectively. This effect was reversed by the Ca(++) channel blocker, verapamil, and the Ca(++)/calmodulin inhibitor, W-7. The Ca(++)ionophore, ionomycin, mimicked the effects of PGE2. The phorbol ester, PMA, which activated phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C (PKC) in chondrocytes, had no effect on IGFBP-4 production. Cyclic AMP mimetics and PKA activators, IBMX, and Sp-cAMP, inhibited the expression of the binding protein as did the PGE2 secretagogue, interleukin-1 beta (IL-beta). The inhibitory effect of the latter cytokine was mediated by a erbstatin/genistein (tyrosine) sensitive kinase. Dexamethasone, an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase (COX-2) expression and PGE2 synthesis, down-regulated control, constitutive levels of IGFBP-4 mRNA and protein, eliminating the previously demonstrated possibility of cross-talk between glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and PGE2-receptor signalling pathways. The results suggest that extracellular signals control IGFBP-4 production by a number of different transducing networks with changes in Ca(++) and calmodulin activity exerting a strong positive influence, possibly maintaining the constitutivity of IGFBP-4 synthesis under basal conditions. PGE2 activation of the IGF-1/IGFBP axis may play a pivotal role in the metabolism of cartilage and possibly connective tissues in general. Eicosanoid biosynthesis may be a rate-limiting step in cartilage repair processes.",

Locally applied beta-blocking agents are partially resorbed from the nasal mucosa. Concentrations which give rise to systemic effects occur invariably. Several reports exist of congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, severe respiratory symptoms, depression, hallucinations and confusion provoked by topical use of beta-blockers, especially timolol. It is impossible to estimate from the literature how often the various adverse effects occur. One has the impression, however, that adverse effects in the pulmonary and central nervous systems have not been fully considered. Between 1986 and 1995 the Norwegian Medicines Control Authority received reports on adverse reactions related to topical use of beta-blockers in 17 patients. Six of these patients had cardiovascular and four of them severe respiratory symptoms. The latter group also included three fatal cases. The adverse effects seem to occur most frequently in the elderly, and it has been suggested that timolol should not be used in elderly people. Adverse effects related to treatment with topical beta-blockers are probably underreported in Norway.", 
    "112": "We investigated whether or not insulin and cAMP-elevating agents induce the proliferation of adult rat hepatocytes during the early and late phases of primary culture. Adult rat hepatocytes synthesized a significant amount of DNA when cultured in the presence of 10(-7) M insulin for 3 h. Under these conditions, the number of nuclei increased within 4 h. Hepatocyte DNA synthesis and proliferation were not essentially affected by the initial plating densities. Other cAMP-elevating agents, such as glucagon, forskolin and dibutyryl cAMP, as well as beta-adrenoceptor agonists (i.e., metaproterenol and isoproterenol) alone had no effect on either hepatocyte DNA synthesis or proliferation in primary culture. In contrast, these agents potentiated both processes at concentrations as low as 10(-7) M when cultured in combination with 10(-7) M insulin. The stimulatory effects of beta-adrenoceptor agonists and other cAMP-elevating agents were significantly blocked by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor, H-89 (N-[2-(p-(bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide dihydrochloride; 10(-7) M). The mitogenic effect of insulin upon hepatocytes was almost completely suppressed by genistein (5 x 10(-6) M), wortmannin (10(-7) M) and by rapamycin (10 ng/ml). These results show that insulin rapidly induced the proliferation of adult rat hepatocytes in primary culture. The mitogenic effects of insulin were potentiated by beta-adrenoceptor agonists and cAMP-elevating agents. The effects of beta-adrenoceptor agonists and cAMP-elevating agents may be mediated through cAMP-dependent protein kinase. In addition, the activation of receptor tyrosine kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase and p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase may be involved in the insulin signal transduction pathway.",

Acupuncture stimulation decreased heart rate, or gave no significant response. The decreased response of heart rate following acupuncture was attenuated by administration of atropine and propranolol. Therefore, the acupuncture-induced response of decrease in heart rate was concluded to be a result of a reciprocal coordination of an increase in cardiac vagal activity and a decrease in cardiac sympathetic activity.",

During a median follow-up time of 3.2 years (2132 patient-years), 32 patients suffered a CV death, 21 had a nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), and 77 underwent revascularization. Plasma levels of tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) activity and antigen (ag), plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) activity at test, and TPA responses to exercise were determined at baseline and after 1 month's treatment and were related to subsequent fatal and nonfatal CV events. Univariate Cox regression analysis revealed that elevated levels of TPA-ag at rest (P < .05), high PAI-1 activity (P < .05), and low TPA-ag responses to exercise (P < .05) were associated with increased risk of subsequent CV death. After adjustment for baseline risk factors, TPA-ag independently predicted CV death or MI. In addition, PAI-1 activity independently predicted CV death or MI in male patients.

The bitter-tasting denatonium ion has been proposed to act via two different G-protein-regulated pathways, one involving inositol 1,4, 5-trisphosphate and raised intracellular calcium levels, the other involving phosphodiesterase and membrane depolarization via a cyclic nucleotide-suppressible cation channel. The aim of the present study was to examine these transduction mechanisms in taste cells of the mudpuppy Necturus maculosus by calcium-imaging and whole-cell recording. Denatonium benzoate increased intracellular calcium levels and induced an outward current independently of extracellular calcium. The denatonium-induced increase in intracellular calcium was inhibited by U73122, an inhibitor of phospholipase C, and by thapsigargin, an inhibitor of calcium transport into intracellular stores. The denatonium-induced outward current was blocked by GDP-beta-S, a blocker of G-protein activation. Neither resting nor denatonium-induced intracellular calcium levels were affected by inhibition of phosphodiesterase (with IBMX) or adenylate cyclase (with SQ22536) or by raising intracellular cyclic nucleotides directly (with cell permeant analogs). Our results support the hypothesis that denatonium is transduced via a G-protein cascade involving phospholipase C, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, and raised intracellular calcium levels. Our results do not support the hypothesis that denatonium is transduced via phosphodiesterase and cAMP.", 
    "130": "Amyloid plaques in Alzheimer disease are primarily aggregates of Abeta peptides that are derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Neurotransmitter agonists that activate phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis and protein kinase C stimulate APP processing and generate soluble, non-amyloidogenic APP (APPs). Elevations in cAMP oppose this stimulatory effect and lead to the accumulation of cell-associated APP holoprotein containing amyloidogenic Abeta peptides. We now report that cAMP signaling can also increase cellular levels of APP holoprotein by stimulating APP gene expression in astrocytes. Treatment of astrocytes with norepinephrine or isoproterenol for 24 h increased both APP mRNA and holoprotein levels, and these increases were blocked by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol. Treatment with 8-bromo-adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate or forskolin for 24 h similarly increased APP holoprotein levels; astrocytes were also transformed into process-bearing cells expressing increased amounts of glial fibrillary acidic protein, suggesting that these cells resemble reactive astrocytes. The increases in APP mRNA and holoprotein in astrocytes caused by cAMP stimulation were inhibited by the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A. Our study suggests that APP overexpression by reactive astrocytes during neuronal injury may contribute to Alzheimer disease neuropathology, and that immunosuppressants can inhibit cAMP activation of APP gene transcription.", 
    "131": "This research uses the diastolic decay constant (tau) to investigate the short term mechanism responsible for vasomotor control, mainly the alpha-sympathetic control system. Previous studies have shown that vasomotor control is altered in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) preceding the phase of overt hypertension. The diastolic decay, according to the two element Windkessel model, displays an exponential shape with a decay constant, tau, depending on both the vascular resistance and the compliance. In our experiments, we used tau to characterize vasomotor activity and its control in the normotensive rats as well as in the spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) prone to hypertension. The beat to beat value of tau was evaluated from a continuous arterial blood pressure (ABP) signal, measured in the tail artery of the conscious, unrestrained rat. Four months old prehypertensive SHR were compared to their age matched normotensive controls (WKY). To study vasomotor regulation, we computed gains and delay times by investigating the compensatory response in tau to changes in mean ABP (MBP). These parameters are expected in the short term to be neurally controlled by the sympathetic system, mainly alpha-sympathetic. Our set of experiments consisted of changing MBP by performing successive injections in bolus of increasing doses of the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II. This procedure was repeated under double cardiac autonomic blockade of the vagal and beta 1 = sympathetic limbs. Our results show that, under baseline conditions, the absolute gain and delay times of tau are reduced in SHR compared to WKY. Double cardiac blockade decreases the absolute gain in both strains, while abolishing the baseline strain differences. These results reinforce our assumption that, in SHR, the alpha-sympathetic system is in a basic state of excitation even prior to the onset of overt hypertension and therefore reacting with reduced sensitivity (lower gain) to changes in MBP.", 
    "132": "Sustained stimulation of the beta2-adrenoceptor leads to a desensitization of the receptor-mediated adenylyl cyclase stimulation. While desensitization promoted by nanomolar concentrations of isoproterenol involves the phosphorylation of the beta2-adrenoceptor by protein kinase A alone, both protein kinase A- and beta-adrenoceptor kinase-mediated phosphorylation leading to the binding of beta-arrestin contribute to the desensitization evoked by micromolar concentrations of agonist. In the present study, we assessed the influence of receptor density on the patterns of desensitization induced by these two different levels of stimulation. Murine L cells were transfected with a cDNA encoding the human beta2-adrenoceptor and clonal cell lines expressing various levels of beta2-adrenoceptor were used for the study. In cell lines expressing the highest number of receptor, approx. 150000 sites/cell (approx. 3000 fmol/mg of membrane proteins), pretreatment with micromolar concentrations of isoproterenol causes a desensitization pattern characterized by a reduction in both the potency and the efficacy of isoproterenol to further stimulate the adenylyl cyclase activity. In contrast, desensitization induced by 10 nM isoproterenol resulted only in a decrease in the potency of isoproterenol. This distinct pattern of desensitization is not seen in cells expressing 12000 receptors/cell (approx. 200 fmol/mg of membrane proteins) and, in that case, pretreatment with 10 nM isoproterenol leads to a reduction in both the sensitivity and the maximal response. Similar effects on the beta-adrenoceptor-stimulated adenylyl cyclase were observed in these cells following treatment with dibutyryl cAMP. Receptor density therefore dramatically influences the pattern of desensitization evoked by low level of stimulation. The results also demonstrate that although different molecular events are involved in the desensitization evoked by different levels of stimulation, its phenotypic expression can be qualitatively identical in cells expressing a relatively small number of receptors. Hence, protein kinase A-mediated desensitization cannot be qualitatively distinguished from the beta-adrenoceptor kinase-mediated process in these cells.", 
    "133": "The long QT syndrome (LQTS) combines a prolonged QT interval with an enhanced risk of polymorphous ventricular arrhythmias that may lead to syncope and sudden cardiac death. It may be congenital or acquired (the latter sometimes caused by drugs). Congenital LQTS is a rare disease, usually discovered during the clinical evaluation of understood syncopes or at cardiological examination after an unexpected sudden cardiac death of a close relative. The syncope frequently occurs during physical exercise, fear or sudden loud noises. In patients with symptomatic LQTS, the mortality 10 years after the first syncope amounts to approximately 50%. A prolonged QT interval indicates abnormal repolarization or deceleration of the depolarization. An increase of the sympathetic tone, e.g. during physical exercise and emotions, causes prolongation of the QT interval. Congenital LQTS has been associated with genetic mutations, for instance on chromosomes 3 and 7. Treatment consists af administration of beta-blockers, sympathectomy and, if necessary, implantation of an automatic cardioverter/defibrillator.", 
    "134": "Kinins are proinflammatory peptides that dilate vessels, increase vascular permeability, contract smooth muscles, and provoke pain. The known mammalian kinin receptors are classified as two subtypes, i.e. the B1 receptor triggered by [des-Arg9]bradykinin and inhibited by [des-Arg9,Leu8]bradykinin, and the B2 receptor stimulated by bradykinin and antagonized by HOE140. Here we report the cloning of a non-mammalian kinin receptor gene amplified from genomic chicken DNA. The protein predicted from the open reading frame shows 31 and 49% sequence identity to the human B1 and B2 receptors, respectively, suggesting that it represents a G protein-coupled receptor of the kinin receptor family. The recombinantly expressed chicken receptor had IC50 values of 4.7 nM for the authentic ligand, ornithokinin ([Thr6,Leu8]bradykinin), 3.8 nM for HOE140, and >/=10 microM for bradykinin, [des-Arg9]bradykinin, and [des-Arg9,Leu8]bradykinin. Ornithokinin and HOE140 at nanomolar concentrations stimulated intracellular inositol phosphate accumulation and induced a significant transient rise in intracelluar free Ca2+, whereas bradykinin was ineffective even at 100 nM. Hence the principal B2 receptor antagonist HOE140 is a potent agonist of the chicken kinin receptor. This unique pharmacological profile classifies the ornithokinin receptor as a novel subtype among kinin receptors and will facilitate further molecular studies on ligand binding and receptor activation.", 
    "135": "INTRAHIPPOCAMPAL administration of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist scopolamine at a dose of 3.2 micrograms/side significantly increased the number of errors (attempts to pass through two incorrect panels of the three panel-gates at four choice points) in the working memory task with a three-panel runway setup, whereas 0.32 microgram/side scopolamine did not affect working memory errors. The beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (10 mg/kg, i.p.) had no effect on working memory error, but it produced a significant increase in working memory errors when administered in combination with intrahippocampal scopolamine at the behaviourally ineffective dose (0.32 microgram/side). The increase in working memory errors induced by intrahippocampal administration of 0.32 microgram/side scopolamine to rats treated with 10 mg/kg propranolol was decreased by concurrent injection of the cholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine (3.2 micrograms/side). D-Cycloserine (the partial agonist at the glycine bindings site on the NMDA receptor/channel complex) at a dose of 10 micrograms/side reduced the increase in working memory errors induced by intrahippocampal 0.32 microgram/side scopolamine combined with 10 mg/kg propranolol. These results suggest that neural mechanisms regulated cooperatively by hippocampal muscarinic and beta-adrenergic transmission underlie working memory performance, and that modification of NMDA function contributes to such interactive regulation of working memory processes in the hippocampus.",

From the second week of life onwards they had a goitre and hyperexcitability, tachycardia and failure to thrive were noted. In addition, twin I had mild exophthalmos. As thyrostatic treatment of the mother was very difficult, intrauterine hypothyroidism or transitory hyperthyroidism had presumably occurred in the twins.",

Twin I, whose symptoms were more severe, also received propylthiouracil (5 mg/kg.d) until euthyroidism had been achieved. Although twin II became euthyroid spontaneously, she gained weight only slowly and microcephaly developed together with definite motor and mental retardation.

    "140": "A cirrhotic patient with large varices and red color signs at endoscopy, and a portal pressure greater than 12 mmHg, has a high risk of bleeding from those varices in the near future. Prophylactic therapy with a nonselective beta-adrenergic blocking drug or long acting nitroglycerin reduces the risk of developing the first bleed and increases life expectancy. The acute variceal bleed requires prompt resuscitation with volume replacement, early initiation of vasoactive drugs (octreotide, somatosatin, or vasopressin plus nitroglycerin) to reduce portal pressure and decrease splanchnic flow, and early diagnostic endoscopy to determine the cause of bleeding. Variceal banding or sclerotherapy is successful in controlling the acute bleed in up to 90% of cases. Beta-adrenergic blocker therapy should be instituted once the bleed has been controlled and banding/sclerotherapy continued until the varices have been obliterated. In the patient with recalcitrant or recurrent bleeding, TIPS, selective shunt surgery, or liver transplantation may be options depending on the specifics of the particular case.", 
    "141": "Patients with large esophageal varices who are deemed compliant and have no contraindications to beta-blocker therapy should be started on nonselective beta-adrenergic blockers (Fig. 5). The dose should be titrated to a 25% decrease in resting heart rate, a resting heart rate of 55 to 60 beats per minute, or development of symptoms, in which case the dose should be decreased until the patient's symptoms abate. If available, measurements of the HVPG at baseline and 3 months can be very helpful in ascertaining the response to treatment and in making the appropriate adjustments (e.g., adding a second drug). Sclerotherapy or endoscopic variceal ligation are the preferred therapies for treatment of acute esophageal variceal bleeding. Concomitant use of vasoactive drugs can supplement endoscopic treatment. They offer the advantage of early administration as soon as the diagnosis is suspected while awaiting endoscopy. Unlike endoscopic treatment, they decrease portal pressure and are the only established treatment for nonvariceal sources of bleeding related to portal hypertension. Once the index bleed is controlled, the patient should be started on treatment to reduce the high risk of recurrent variceal hemorrhage (Fig. 6). For patients with well-compensated cirrhosis, pharmacologic therapy may be desirable. For less compliant patients or patients with decompensated cirrhosis, an endoscopic technique, such as variceal ligation, may be preferable. Combinations of pharmacologic agents or pharmacologic agents and endoscopic procedures may offer hope for better control, but their efficacy needs to be demonstrated in RCTs. For patients who rebleed despite maximal pharmacologic or endoscopic therapy, a TIPS procedure, surgically created shunt, or liver transplantation should be considered, with the decision based on the patient's condition and the local availability of these options.",

    "151": "In order to investigate the role of beta 3 adrenoceptors in the regulation of gastric acid secretion we studied the effects of compound SR58611A (a selective agonist for atypical beta adrenoceptors), alone or in combination with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, in the gastric fistula of a conscious cat. The effects of SR58611A were compared with those of clenbuterol, a selective agonist for beta 2 adrenoceptors. Intravenous infusion of SR58611A (0.3-3 mumol/kg/h) caused a dose-dependent, but partial, inhibition of the acid secretory response to 2-deoxy-D-glucose 100 mg/kg i.v., maximum effect not exceeding 40%. Clenbuterol (0.03-0.1 mumol/kg/h) caused a similar effect (maximum inhibition about 50%) at doses approximately 30 times lower. The acid secretion induced by the histamine H2-receptor agonist dimaprit (1 mumol/kg/h) was minimally affected by both beta adrenoceptor agonists. The inhibitory effect of SR58611A (3 mumol/kg/h) on 2-deoxy-D-glucose-induced acid secretion was not modified by pretreatment with the non-selective beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor blocker propranolol, administered at doses (1.5 mumol/kg iv) that completely blocked the inhibitory effect of clenbuterol (0.1 mumol/kg/h). In contrast, bupranolol (10 mumol/kg i.v.) (a drug endowed with beta 3 antagonistic properties) prevented the inhibitory effects of both SR58611A and clenbuterol. The present data provide functional evidence that, besides beta 2-, also beta 3-adrenoceptors can have negative effects on gastric acid secretion, particularly when it is stimulated by indirect stimuli, like 2-deoxy-D-glucose. This gastric antisecretory activity may represent an additional mechanism for the physio-pharmacological control of gastric acid secretion.", 
    "152": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the therapeutic effects of tetrandrine and propranolol, alone or in combination, on portal hypertensive rats. Portal hypertension was induced by partial portal vein ligation in Sprague-Dawley rats. Animals were allocated into one of the four groups: vehicle group (0.1 N.HCl, 0.7 ml/day), tetrandrine group (50 mg/kg/ day), propranolol group (30 mg/kg/day), and tetrandrine (50 mg/kg/day) plus propranolol (30 mg/kg/day) group. Drug or vehicle was administered by gavage for consecutive 9 days. After 9 days of treatment, the portal venous pressure and mean arterial pressure in each treatment group were significantly lower than those in the vehicle group. The cardiac index was not changed by tetrandrine alone, but reduced in the two groups receiving propranolol alone or in combination. Total peripheral resistance was significantly decreased in the tetrandrine group and significantly increased in the tetrandrine plus propranolol group as compared with the vehicle group. Our results suggested that tetrandrine or propranolol alone induced portal hypotensive effects, with propranolol achieving better antihyperdynamic effects in terms of cardiac index, and in combination propranolol effects predominated over those of tetrandrine.", 
    "153": "Several studies have shown in essential hypertension alterations of the transmembrane red blood cells sodium fluxes, as an involvement, especially in the early phases, also of the adrenergic system. In this study we evaluated the behaviour of red blood cells fluxes of sodium before, during and after the cold pressor test, a method used also to evoke an adrenergic stimulation, in twenty hypertensive subjects, 14 males and 6 females, with an average age of 43.2 +/- 5.7 years, with normal weight and without cardiovascular complications and metabolic diseases. The behaviour of the Na+ total efflux (Na+ TE), of the Na+/K+ pump, of the Na+K+ cotransport (Na+/K+ CT), of the Na+/Li+ counter transport (Na+/Li+ Cnt), of the Na+ passive permeability (Na+ PP), of the intracellular Na+ (I Na+) and of the plasmatic noradrenaline (NE) was evaluated basally, at the third minute during cold pressor test (CPT) and 20 minutes after the end of the test. The test, which the same method, was repeated after a 30 day treatment with propranolol at the dose of 240 mg/day in three daily administrations. The beta-blockade caused, besides the reduction of both the systolic and diastolic pressure values, a significant increase in the Na+/K+ CT (from 248 +/- 41 to 314 +/- 71 mmol/l/cells/h, p < 0.001) and a decrease in the Na+ PP (from 0.039 +/- 0.004 to 0.023 +/- 0.007 hr-1, p < 0.00001), probably directed towards the reduction of the accumulation of intracellular Na+, that could compete, among the other mechanisms, with the anti-hypertensive action of the beta-blockers. The CPT caused, before the beta-blockade, a significant depression of the Na+/K+ pump (from 2057 +/- 149 to 1610 +/- 101 mmol/l/cells/h, p < 0.00001) and of the Na+ TE (from 2640 +/- 397 to 2032 +/- 179 mmol/l/cells/h, p < 0.00001) inversely correlated to the levels of NE (r = -0.60, p < 0.003), with a consequent increase in I Na+ (from 6.2 +/- 0.6 to 7.5 +/- 1.5 mmol/l/cells, p < 0.001), showing how the adrenergic activation in hypertensive subjects is able to interfere with the systems of transmembrane transport with an inhibitory attitude, that is expressed by an increase in the levels of I Na+. The beta-blockade was able to outweigh the depression of the Na+/K+ pump (from 1843 +/- 584 to 1728 +/- 640 mmol/l/cells/h, p: ns) and the reduction of the Na+ TE, preventing the accumulation of I Na+ (from 6.3 +/- 1.6 to 6.6 +/- 1.3 mmol/l/cells, p: ns). Such data show an increased susceptibility of the Na+ transport systems to the adrenergic stimuli in hypertensive subjects with a tendency to favor the accumulation of I Na+ and that the beta-blockade is able to antagonize the effects, with a maintenance of the intracellular levels of Na+.", 
    "154": "This study examined ninety-six patients with essential arterial hypertension (WHO grade I-II) who had been under treatment for a period of at least one year before participating in the study. When the study began the patients received no drug treatment for one month. At the end of this washout period their basal situation was evaluated and drug treatment was begun (26 patients on calcium antagonists, 39 on beta-blockers and 31 on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors). The patients were evaluated again after one and two years of uninterrupted treatment with the chosen medication. The results obtained indicate that in a basal situation hypertensive patients have higher blood viscosity and erythrocyte rigidity values than the control group. Regardless of the drug treatment used, the patients experienced during the study a progressive deterioration of their hemorheological situation consisting of an increase in red blood cell rigidity and increased blood viscosity. These results indicate the importance of evaluating the hemorheological parameters of hypertensive patients and suggest that it may be advisable to include in their treatment some kind of medication that prevents progressive rheological deterioration.",

    "156": "The inadequacy of the QT interval to shorten following heart rate increase is a feature of the inherited long QT syndrome and may have a role in the genesis of the typical arrhythmias associated with this syndrome (torsade des pointes). The aim of our study was to evaluate whether drugs that prolong the QT interval, such as amiodarone and D-sotalol, may also impair the ability of the QT interval to adapt to sudden heart rate changes. Experiments were carried out on isolated perfused guinea pig hearts (Langendorff preparation). Driving frequency was changed, in steps, every two minutes (Hz: 2.5-3-2.5-3.75-2.5-5-2.5), while epicardial ECG was continuously recorded on magnetic tape. QT interval was automatically measured by means of a beat-by-beat analysis program. D-sotalol was added to the perfusion medium at a concentration of 4 micrograms ml-1, while amiodarone was administered, before in vitro evaluation, for seven days (50 mg kg-1 per day, intraperitoneally). In control experiments two phases of QT adaptation were identified: an abrupt QT shortening at the first beat after frequency change (QT1), followed by a gradual, exponential QT shortening that reached a new steady state in about 1 min (half life: 13 sec). The electrical restitution curve (the relation between QT1 and the corresponding diastolic interval) had a rate constant of 57 +/- 8 ms. Neither drug changed the slow component of QT adaptation. However, both drugs increased the ability of QT to shorten upon premature stimulation: D-sotalol by increasing the rate constant of the restitution curve and amiodarone by decreasing the y-intercept. Our results indicate that D-sotalol and amiodarone do not impair QT shortening during tachycardia but, on the contrary, they may favour QT adaptation, thus reducing the likelihood of the potentially lethal 'R on T phenomenon'. This may be an additional mechanism by which these drugs can exert their antifibrillatory action.", 
    "157": "The value of the tilt test in assessing unexplained syncope in children and adolescents was investigated in 79 patients (41 girls and 38 boys, 12.3 +/- 2.9 years). The test was performed with a tilt of 60 degrees for 45 minutes. A pharmacological provocation with isoprenaline was carried out in negative passive test. The tilt test was considered to be positive in cases of symptomatic falls of the systolic blood pressure with or without bradycardia. Asystole was defined as a ventricular pause > or = 5 seconds. During the investigation, 52 patients (66%) reproduced symptoms related to vasovagal syncope in 45 patients (57%) or panic attack in 7 others (9%). Of the 45 presenting vasovagal syncope, 7 had a cardio-inhibitory reaction with asystole of 11.2 +/- 3.3 seconds. The other responses were vasodepressive in 17 patients and mixed in 21 patients. A comparative study did not reveal any significant difference between patients with a positive or negative test including those with panic attacks. Seventy-five patients were followed up for an average of 32 +/- 22.3 months. Preventive therapy was prescribed in 34 patients because of the frequency or severity of their symptoms. At the end, 10 patients (13%) had at least one recurrence of syncope, 3 in the group with panic attacks, 5 in non-treated patients (irrespective of the result of the tilt test) and only 1 in the group of 23 patients treated with beta-blockers. The authors conclude that with a diagnostic return of 66% in this series, the tilt test seems to be the non-invasive investigation of choice in unexplained syncope in children and adolescents. In addition, true vasovagal syncope can be differentiated from psychogenic."
