In both anesthetized and conscious animals, the diatrizoate compound caused an early (3--10 sec after injection) decrease in peak dp/dt and dp/dt/LVP40, followed by late (10--20 sec after injection) increases in these variables. The predominant early and later effects of the calcium metrizoate compound were increases in parameters of LV contractile state. Metrizamide produced no significant early alterations, but later induced a small increase in these variables. The positive inotropic actions of each of the contrast materials were attenuated by beta adrenergic blockade. The early effects of the contrast materials were similar in the presence of segmental ischemia. The late positive inotropic effects in response to the diatrizoate compound and metrizamide were not observed in the ischemic state, while the positive inotropic response induced by the calcium metrizoate compound was significantly reduced. Thus intracoronary administration of sodium meglumine diatrizoate produced direct myocardial depression, followed by adrenergically mediated myocardial stimulation. Calcium metrizoate caused prominent direct and adrenergically mediated augmentation in contractile state. Metrizamide induced the least alteration in LV contractile state.", 
    "1": "Mechanical and electrical responses of spontaneously contracting muscle strips from oestrogen dominated rabbit uterus were investigated by the sucrose gap method. The effects of isoprenaline and dibutyryl-c-AMP in the presence and absence of propranolol were tested. It has been shown previously that the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline inhibits the spontaneously contracting uterus even in the presence of the beta-blocker propranolol. The rise in c-amp which is caused by isoprenaline, is, however, blocked by propranolol. The aim of this investigation was to study further the role of c-AMP in the isoprenaline-induced relaxation of the uterus. Isoprenaline (10(-6) M) consistently abolished spikes and mechanical contractions, usually accompanied by hyperpolarization. Propranolol (3 X 10(-6) M) markedly reduced the incidence of hyperpolarization, but did not affect the other actions of isoprenaline. Hyperpolarization does not seem to be a prerequisite for inhibition of uterine contraction. Dibutyryl-c-AMP mimicked the actions of isoprenaline. No positive evidence to support a hypothesis of a c-AMP-independent mechanism was found. Therefore a possible explanation of the results could be that isoprenaline increases c-AMP in a small intracellular pool, mediating electrical and mechanical responses but not influenced by propranolol.", 
    "2": "The cardiovascular, blood gas, acid-base and metabolic changes occurring during operative stress were studied in 10 elderly, metabolically healthy patients, suffering from idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia, who underwent electrocoagulation of the gasserian ganglion under neuroleptanalgesia. In a group of 12 patients undergoing the same operative procedure and anesthesthetic management, we investigated the effects of administration of a beta blocking agent on these parameters. Intraoperative rises of blood pressure and tachycardia were prevented by intravenous administration of 0.4 mg Pindolol (Visken), whereas increases in the blood glucose levels at the end of the operation were the same. The increase of glycerol, free fatty acids and ketone bodies was markedly reduced after pretreatment with the beta blocker compared with the controlgroup. In the patients without beta blocker treatment pH and standard bicarbonate at the end of the operation were lower as the result of the stimulation of ketogenesis.", 
    "3": "Repeated injections of rat with 1-thyroxine (50 microgram/kg daily for 5 five-day weeks) retarded the weight gain of the animals and increased the absolute and relative size of the heart, adrenals and interscapular brown adipose tissue. In the myocardium and thigh muscle, thyroxine treatment resulted in elevated activity of oxidative enzymes, succinate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase, while the activities of glycolytic enzymes remained unchanged. Glycogen content of the heart was decreased following thyroxine regime. In the brown fat, on the other hand, thyroxine injections resulted in a reduction of the activity of oxidative enzymes. This reduction can be accounted for by the decreased protein (enzyme) content of the tissue due to deposition of fat. Furthermore, thyroxine treatment delayed the body cooling of the rats swimming in water at 25 degrees C and enhanced hyperthermic response to injected noradrenaline. All these changes, which were not observable in rats treated with daily alprenolol (20 mg/kg) injections, were as pronounced in rats injected with alprenolol together with thyroxine as in rats injected with thyroxine only. It is concluded that beta blockers do not antagonize the metabolic changes due to hyperthyroidism.", 
    "4": "The responses of the nasal capacitance vessels of the cat were recorded following intra-arterial injections of beta-adrenoceptor agonists and histamine H1-and H2-receptor agonists. Isoprenaline evoked vasodilation and propranolol (beta-adrenoceptor antagonist) caused a parallel shift to the right of the isoprenaline log dose-response curve. Histamine, 2-(2-aminoethyl)pyridine (H1-agonist) and 4-methylhistamine (predominantly H2-agonist) all evoked vasodilation. Metiamide (H2-antagonist) produced a further small parallel shift to the right of the histamine log dose-response curve after the administration of mepyramine (H1-antagonist). It is concluded that the nasal capacitance vessels of the cat contain beta 2-adrenoceptors and H1-and H2-histamine receptors.", 
    "5": "1. The disposition and metabolism of 1-(4-carbamoyl[14C]methylphenoxy)-3-isopropylaminopan-2-ol (atenolol, Tenormin) has been studied in man following oral and intravenous doses. 2. Approx. 50% of an oral dose was eliminated in urine; the major radiolabelled component was atenolol (approx. 90%). Faecal extracts also contained largely unchanged atenolol, with small amounts of more polar metabolites. Biliary excretion of atenolol and its metabolites is not a major route of elimination in man. Metabolism of the compound is not extensive and route-dependent modes of metabolism do not appear to complicate the position. 3. Atenolol appeared to be the only major radiolabelled component in blood. 4. Oral doses of atenolol are incompletely absorbed (range 46-62%), even when formulated as a solution. 5. 1-[4-(C-Carbamoylhydroxymethyl)phenoxy]-3-isopropylaminopropan-2-ol was a minor urinary metabolite, which has only one tenth the activity of the parent compound as a beta-adrenergic blocking agent in the rat. 6. Pharmacological activity in man appears to be due to atenolol alone.", 
    "6": "1-(4-iodophenoxy)-3-isopropylaminopropan-2-ol (IIP) is a potent beta-adrenergic antagonist which has been labelled to high specific activity with 125I and used to bind to rat myocardial membranes. The characteristics of binding were consistent with the known properties of beta-receptors. Thus, binding was highly stereospecific for the L-stereoisomer since L-propranolol was two orders of magnitude more potent than the D-isomer in competing for these sites. The beta-adrenergic agonists isoproterenol, epinephrine and norepinephrine competed for binding with potencies paralleling their pharmacological potencies as beta-adrenergic effectors. The dissociation constant for binding of IIP was 4--5 nM as measured either by direct binding studies or by its inhibition of isoproterenol stimulated adenylate cyclase. Binding was saturable with 0.06 pmoles of IIP per mg of membrane protein binding at saturation. 125IIP is a high affinity, high specific activity ligand suitable for use as a selective probe for the detection and quantitation of cardiac beta-receptors. Its introduction should help solve the problems involved in the investigation of myocardial beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "7": "1 Cardiovascular and airways response to two non-cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, propranolol and pindolol (with partial agonist activity) and two cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, acebutolol (with partial agonist activity) and atenolol, were compared in twelve patients with asthma. 2 All four drugs produced a significant reduction in resting pulse rate and prevented the increase in heart rate following inhaled isoprenaline (1,500 microgram). 3 Seven patients in clinical remission showed no significant bronchoconstrictor response to any of the drugs. In the remaining five patients, bronchoconstriction was greatest following propranolol (mean reduction in FEV1 26.6%) and least following atenolol (mean reduction in FEV1 6.5%). 4 The bronchodilator response to inhaled isoprenaline was blocked by propranolol and pindolol but not by acebutolol and atenolol. 5 Partial agonist activity did not appear to be clinically useful.", 
    "8": "All beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs that have been described share the common property of being competitive inhibitors. They differ in their associated properties, the presence or absence of cardioselectivity, membrane stabilizing activity, and partial agonist activity. Recently some beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs have been reported which also possess alpha-adrenoceptor blocking activity. The associated properties have been used as a basis for classifying beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs (Fitzgerald, 1969, 1972). The presence or absence of cardioselectivity is most useful for dividing beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs. The non-selective drugs (Division I) can be further divided according to the presence or absence of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) and membrane stabilizing activity (Fitzgerald's groups I-IV). Group I possess both membrane activity and ISA, e.g. alprenolol, oxprenolol, group II just membrane action, e.g. propanolol, group III ISA but no membrane action, e.g. pindolol. Fitzgerald placed pindolol in group I but should be placed in group III as it possesses a high degree of beta-adrenoceptor blocking potency in relation to its membrane activity (Prichard, 1974). Finally drugs in group IV have neither ISA nor membrane action, e.g. sotalol, timolol. The cardioselective drugs (Division II) can be similarly sub-divided into groups I-IV according to the presence or absence of ISA or membrane action (Fitzgerald grouped all these together as group V). Lastly there are new beta-adrenergic receptor blocking drugs which in addition have alpha- adrenergic receptor blocking properties (Division III).", 
    "9": "In a previous study, we showed that increasing minute ventilation (VE) in rabbit lung by adding a dead space augmented pulmonary surfactant in the airspaces by a cholinergically mediated mechanism. Using the same model in the present study of 148 rabbits, we found that increasing VE augmented airspace phospholipid, the main component of surfactant, from 2.50 +/- 0.61 (mean +/- SD) mg per g of lung during normal VE to 3.15 +/- 1.22 (mean +/- SD) mg per g of lung during increased VE (P = 0.02). Both blocking beta-adrenergic receptors with propranolol or sotalol and inhibiting prostaglandin synthetase with indomethacin or sodium meclofenamate prevented the expected increase in phospholipid during increased VE (P is less than 0.05). The beta-2 agonist, terbutaline, increased phospholipid by 43 per cent during normal VE (P is less than 0.01), and propranolol blocked this increase (P is less than 0.05). Isoproterenol, arachidonic acid, prostaglandins E1, E2, F2alpha, and a cyclic endoperoxide analog of prostaglandin H2 (U-46619) injected during normal VE failed to increase phospholipid. We concluded that acetylcholine (previous study), beta-adrenergic mediators, and prostaglandins are involved in controlling alveolar surfactant during increased VE.", 
    "10": "Eighty-nine new referral hypertensive out-patients and 46 new referral non-hypertensive chronically physically ill out-patients completed a mood rating scale at regular intervals for one year. The results showed a high prevalence of depression in both groups of patients, with no preponderance in the hypertensive group. Hypertensive patients with psychiatric histories had a higher prevalence of depression than the comparison patients. This was accounted for by a significant number of depressions occurring in methyl dopa treated patients with psychiatric histories.", 
    "11": "Binding of [3-H]-dihydroalprenolol ([3-H]-DHA) to rat cardiac membranes was rapid and reversible (k1 = 0.633-0.701 x 10(6) M(-1) S(-1) And k(-1) = 0.0017-0.0043 s(-1). 2 [3-H]-DHA bound to a single class of binding sites with an equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd25degreesc) of 5.7+/-1.1 x 10(-9) M. 3 This binding was specific and the order of potency of adrenoceptor agonists in competing for the binding sites was (-)-isoproterenol greater than (+/-)-isoproternol greater than (+)-isoproterenol greater than (-)-adrenaline greater than (-)-noradrenaline. This was in agreement with the beta1 nature of the cardiac beta-receptors. 4 Cardioselective beta-blockers (i.e. metoprolol, acebutolol and practolol) were shown to have lower binding site affinities, when compared to other blockers. This may be related to steric hindrance by the side-chain at the aromatic end of these molecules.", 
    "12": "A method to determine the serum concentration of the beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent, nadolol, by GLC--selected ion monitoring mass spectrometry of the tri(trimethysilyl) ether derivative is described. A basic solution of serum was extracted, known amounts of internal standard were added to the extract, and the extract was back-extracted into acidic media and lyophilized. The resulting solids were reacted with N-trimethylsilylimidazole. Coded serum samples of 12 subjects, given nadolol alone or in combination with a second drug, were analyzed. The ions at m/e 86 and 100 were monitored to establish the relative concentration ratio of nadolol and the internal reference N-methylnadolol. No interferences from blood components or other administered drugs were observed. A detection level of 6.95 ng/ml of serum was found.", 
    "13": "The physiopathology of hypertension is not fully understood, though the haemodynamic pictures accompanying the various arterial forms have been established. Clinical employment of antihypertensive drugs should tend to correct these pictures and the extent to which this is true is examined in the light of the latest evidence with respect to the drugs most commonly used.", 
    "14": "The efficacy of single daily doses of acebutolol, alone or combined with chlorexolone, was investigated in a group of 20 ambulant patients with uncomplicated hypertension of mild-to-moderate severity. severity. Patients were seen at fort-nightly intervals when doses were adjusted. Blood pressure was measured in all instances at 2 and 8 hours after medication, and after it had stabilized, at 26 hours after the last dose. The results indicate that a single dose of acebutolol alone produces significant lowering of supine and erect blood pressures for 24 hours (P less than 0,005). Combining chlorexolone with acebutolol does not improve the hypotensive effect of the beta-blocker significantly, but makes a smaller dose effective.", 
    "15": "Taurine influx in the perfused rat heart was characterized and the effect of isoproterenol on this process determined. Hearts were perfused by the Langendorff technique with [3H]-taurine in a non-recirculating system. The rate of taurine influx was constant for at least 20 min and the process was saturable. A Km of 45 micron indicated that taurine influx is mediated by a high affinity transport system. Competition between taurine and beta-alanine, but not alpha-amino acids, for influx indicated that the transport sites are specific for beta-amino acids. Isoproterenol (4 X 10(-7) M) stimulated the rate of taurine influx, but propranolol (1 X 10(-8) M) blocked this stimulation. The enhancement of influx by isoproterenol was specific for beta-amino acids in that alpha-amino acid influx was not affected. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP (1 X 10(-3) M) and theophylline (1 X 10(-3) M) also stimulated taurine influx, whereas alterations in heart rate had no effect on the rate of taurine influx. The results are suggestive of a beta-adrenergically activated, cyclic AMP-mediated mechanism controlling isoproterenol-stimulated taurine influx.", 
    "16": "Dopamine was injected in graded doses into the hepatic artery of the anaesthetized dog: the typical response was an initial vasoconstriction followed by a more protracted vasodilatation. The vasodilatation was unaffected by propranolol, but was antagonized by haloperidol. The initial hepatic arterial vasoconstriction was inhibited both by haloperidol and by phentolamine. The experiments suggest that the initial vasoconstriction was due to alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation and that the secondary vasodilatation was the result of the stimulation of dopamine receptors. In separate experiments, dopamine was injected into the hepatic portal vein of the dog. The only response seen was a dose-dependent portal vasoconstriction which was antagonized both by haloperidol and by phentolamine. Since both of these antagonists attenuated the portal vasoconstrictor effects of intraportal phenylephrine, it is probable that the portal vasoconstriction effect of dopamine is due to alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation.", 
    "17": "In selected beta1- (heart, lipolysis) and beta2-adrenoceptor (trachea) systems, the interaction of racemic-trimetoquinol (TMQ) and the erythro- and threo-diastereomers of 1-(3',4',5'-trimethoxy-alpha-hydroxybenzyl)-6,7-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (alpha-hydroxy TMQ) was investigated. Each tetrahydroisoquinoline possessed agonist activity in these beta-adrenoceptor systems. The rank order of potency observed for these compounds was racemic-TMQ greater than erythro-alpha-hydroxy TMQ greater than threo-alpha-hydroxy TMQ. Using isolated fat adipocytes, a favorable correlation was observed between the elevation in c-AMP and pharmacological response for the TMQ stereoisomers and diastereomers of alpha-hydroxy TMQ. The rise in intracellular c-AMP produced by (-)- and (+)-TMQ in fat cells was blocked by the presence of propranolol, and not in the presence of phentolamine. Since considerably higher concentrations (greater 10(-4) M) of these compounds were required to produce a significant inhibition of c-AMP phosphodiesterase activity in adipose tissue, it is proposed that the lipolytic response is a result of stereoselective interaction of these tetrahydroisoquinolines at the level of membrane-bound adenylate cyclase.", 
    "18": "Fifteen hypertensive patients with well controlled blood pressure on antihypertensive regiments consisting of a diuretic (in all but one) and a thrice-daily regimen of oxprenolol, were switched to an equal total daily dose of slow-release oxprenolol given once daily. Other drugs were continued unchanged. Observations on blood pressure and heart rate during half-day tests (lying, standing and post-exercise) indicated a little loss of control of the blood pressure towards the end of the 24-hour period when the next daily dose was due. Ectopic beats associated with exertion were observed more frequently at the end of the 24-hour period. Maximum advantage would seem to be gained by giving slow-release oxprenolol as a twice daily regimen with two-thirds of the daily dose in the morning and one-third at night.", 
    "19": "Labetalol, a combined alpha-blocking and beta-blocking agents, was administered by intravenous bolus to six severely hypertensive patients. The blood pressure response was unsatisfactory in every case. It is concluded that intravenous administration of labetalol is not useful in hypertensive emergencies which occur in patients who are already receiving other antihypertensive agents.", 
    "20": "Twenty-two hypertensive patients from a large clinic, who were resistant to conventional therapy, were entered into this study. Most patients previously had received beta-blocking drugs, thiazide diuretics, alpha-methyl-dopa, or vasodilator drugs (hydrallazine or prazosin) which failed to control their blood pressure. The therapy with vasodilator drugs was discontinued, and the therapy with labetalol (a drug with both alpha-blocking and beta-blocking effect) was commenced. Subsequently, as the blood pressure came under control, other drugs that the patients were taking were also withdrawn. In 13 of the 22 patients, labetalol enabled the blood pressure to be controlled at acceptable levels. In six patients, the response was not considered to be sufficient to justify continuation of labetalol therapy. In three patients, the drug was withdrawn because of postural hypotension in one patient, intractable diarrhoea in another, and an allergic-type skin rash in the third. In certain patients, postural changes in blood pressure were observed, but this rarely produced symptoms. It is suggested that, if blood pressure control is not achieved with a thiazide diuretic and a beta-blocking drug, then labetalol should be introduced and the beta-blocking drug should be withdrawn.", 
    "21": "A) Definition and classification. Cardiomyopathy is defined as a dysfunction of cardiac muscle of unknown origin and classified according to genetic, morphological and functional criteria as follows: 1. cardiomyopathy of autosomal dominant inheritance with asymmetric septal hypertrophy (ASH) a) obstructive b) non obstructive 2. cardiomyopathy of autosomal dominant inheritance without ASH 3. cardiomyopathy of autosomal recessive inheritance 4. sporadic cardiomyopathy. It is assumed that at least the cardiomyopathies listed here are heterogeneous groups that have to be subdivided as soon as further discriminating findings--structural or enzymatic--are available. B) Diagnosis, prognosis, treatment. The diagnostic methods are evaluated, the prognosis and the treatment of the cardiomyopathies are reviewed.", 
    "22": "Thyroid hormones may participate in the regulation of beta-adrenergic receptors in skeletal muscle sarcolemmal membrane. Since skeletal muscles are not innervated by sympathetic nerve endings, the biochemical mechanism involved in the control of beta-adrenergic receptors by thyroid hormones appears to be mediated by thyroid-induced regulation of serum levels of catecholamines.", 
    "23": "In 35 patients with moderate or severe essential hypertension (EH) four groups could be identified by plasma angiotensin II (AII) (formula: see text) and by exchangeable sodium (ENa) (formula: see text) determination. In 6 patients with high AII (135.9 pg/ml +/- 26.29) and normal ENa (98.83% +/- 1.40) propranolol significantly lowered both blood pressure (BP) and AII, suggesting that these forms of EH are renin dependent. In 15 patients with normal AII (36.43 pg/ml +/- 2.27) and high ENa (124.23 +/- 2.78) and in 6 patients with low AII (8.36 pg/ml +/- 3.39) and high ENa (125.16% +/- 5.71) the maximal hypotensive effect was achieved after ENa reduction with thiabutazid. These forms of EH appear to be volume-sodium dependent. In 8 patients with increase of both AII (76.53 pg/ml +/- 5.72) and ENa (112% +/- 1.72), propranolol associated with thiabutazid lowered the BP, AII and ENa suggesting that these cases are mixed forms. ENa determination appears to be a reliable index for renin profiling; such a renin-sodium profile allows to identify some pathophysiologic forms of arterial hypertension.", 
    "24": "Arrhythmias were studied at the early stage after rapid ligation of the left ventricular artery on an experimental model of arrhythmia in rabbits. The rabbits were subjected to thoractomy and ligation of the left ventricular artery under direct visualization. The electrocardiographic and hemodynamic parameters were recorded. Electrocardiographic signs of infarction and changes in rhythm were recorded in 60% of the animals. The rate of cardiac contractions and the arterial pressure decreased after the ligation. In the group in which practolol was applied the rate of arrhythmias dropped to 25%. The effect of adrenergic beta-block on acute occlusion of the coronary artery is discussed.", 
    "25": "Experiments on anesthetized dogs have shown that intravenous infusion of 1 mg/kg of propranolol has no essential effect on the threshold of ventricular fibrillation, but considerably reduces the duration of the vulnerable period. Ligation of the coronary artery during propranolol infusion does not cause a reduction in the fibrillation threshold or prolongation of the period of vulnerability; propranolol inhibits the fibrillatory effect of ligation of the vessel. Infusion of propranolol after ligation of the coronary artery leads to the return of the fibrillation threshold and the duration of the period of vulnerability to the initial values. Prolongation of the period of vulnerability after ligation of the coronary artery and its reduction after propranolol infusion occur due to shifts in the internal boundary of the period. There is a direct correlative relationship between the duration of the vulnerable period and the body mass of the dogs: the greater the mass of the animal, the longer the duration of the period of vulnerability.", 
    "26": "The precursors of ventricular fibrillation and asystole developing after ligation of a branch of the coronary artery and adrenalin injection were studied in 30 albino rats. The comparative efficacy of antiarrhythmic agents (ajmalin, lidocaine, isoptin, visken) in the prevention of ventricular fibrillation induced by electric current was determined in 40 rats. Ventricular extrasystole and tachysystole as well as the block of the bundle of His branch were the most common precursors of ventricular fibrillation. In some experiments fibrillation was preceded by complete atrioventricular block, cardiac fibrillation, sinus bradycardia, nonparoxysmal ventricular tachycardia, and excaped ventricular contractions. Ventricular asystole was most frequently preceded by complete atrioventricular block and the bundle of His branch block. Among the antiarrhythmic agents studied, ajmalin proved most effective in prevention of ventricular fibrillation; it raised the fibrillation threshold in all animals. Lidocaine, which produced a prophylactic effect in 50% of experiments, was second in effectiveness. Changes in the ventricular fibrillation threshold due to the effect of these agents were statistically significant on the average. Isoptin and visken proved to be less effective.", 
    "27": "A chronic hypertensive patient was treated with alpha-methyldopa and diuretics throughout the 30 weeks of her second unsuccessful pregnancy. Treatment with propranolol and hydralazine was effective in controlling her blood pressure and was continued throughout her next two pregnancies, both of which were successful. No adverse reactions were observed in either the mother or the infants. The possibility that this combined treatment is beneficial to both mother and child in such cases should be further explored.", 
    "28": "The influence of adrenergic agents, epinephrine and clonidine, on plasma immunoreactive insulin and plasma glucose concentrations was studied in mice. Subcutaneous injection of epinephrine in fasted mice did not alter the plasma glucose concentration (PG), while plasma immunoreactive insulin concentration (IRI) tended to increase gradually. Intravenous injection of glucose markedly increased IRI. Glucose-induced IRI increase was inhibited by a subcutaneous injection of epinephrine in spite of high elevation of PG. This inhibition of glucose-induced IRI increase by epinephrine was reversed after treatment with an alpha-adrenergic blocking agent, phentolamine. Propranolol, an beta-adrenergic blocking agent suppressed IRI to a greater extent as compared with IRI induced by simultaneous injection of glucose and epinephrine. These results indicate that beta-adrenoceptor stimulating action accelerates the insulin release induced by glucose while alpha-adrenoceptor stimulating action inhibits it. Subcutaneous injection of clonidine in fasted mice slightly decreased IRI and increased PG. The response of PG to clonidine was dose-dependent. Glucose-induced IRI increase was inhibited by an intravenous injection of clonidine, and PG was elevated under the same conditions. The inhibition of glucose-induced IRI increase by clonidine was reversed when phentolamine was given, and under these conditions, PG showed no change. Propranolol treatment did not result in a recovery of the inhibition of glucose-induced IRI increase by clonidine. When compared with the results of epinephrine treatment, it may be concluded that clonidine shows alpha-adrenoceptor stimulating action in the secretion of insulin from beta-cells of the endocrine pancreas.", 
    "29": "The minimum current required to induce ventricular fibrillation was determined in 22 sodium pentobarbital anesthetized open chest dogs in the presence of the d- or l-isomers of propranolol at concentrations of 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/kg. The hearts were paced from the right atrium at a constant basic cycle length of 350 msec and the current was delivered during the vulnerable period to the right ventricle as a 120 msec train of 4 msec square wave pulses at 100 Hz. The l-isomer of propranolol increased the ventricular fibrillation threshold (VFT) above control values at all concentrations; the maximum increase ranged from 17.8 to greater than 420.8% change from control. In contrast, the d-isomer caused only a small increase in the ventricular fibrillation threshold with the maximum increase ranging between 14.0 and 65.2% change from control. The maximum increase in VFT for the racemic mixture of propranolol was 44.7 to greater than 500.0% above control and was similar to the l-isomer alone. Since the beta-blocking potency of the l-isomer is 100 times the potency of the d-isomer we conclude that propranolol's action in increasing the ventricular fibrillation threshold is dependent on its beta-blocking effect.", 
    "30": "Histamine, 2-methylhistamine (a specific H1-agonist), 5-HT, PGF2alpha, SRS-A, bradykinin (BK) and carbachol contract bronchial and tracheal smooth muscles of the horse. Isoprenaline, PGE1, E2, dimaprit and 4-methylhistamine (last two = specific H2-agonists) relaxed airways which were partially contracted to carbachol. Mepyramine (a specific H1-antagonist) selectively antagonized contractions to histamine. In the presence of mepyramine, histamine caused relaxation of airways partially contracted to carbachol. Metiamide and burimamide (specific H2-antagonists) specifically antagonized or reversed histamine-induced bronchorelaxation. However the H2-antagonists, indomethacin and propranolol each failed to block histamine-induced relaxations in trachea. Thus, the results of this study show: (i) preponderence of H1-receptors-mediating contractions in horse airways; (ii) presence of H2-receptors-mediating bronchorelaxation and (iii) the existence of an atypical (relaxant) response (resistance to H2-antagonists; indomethacin and propranolol) in the horse trachea.", 
    "31": "Electromechanical intervals of right and left ventricles were examined in newborn lambs (9 hours to 42 days). The electromechanical interval of the left ventricle did not change with maturation, while that of the right ventricle became progressively longer, resulting in an increasing ventricular mechanical asynchrony. We postulate that the pattern of developing mechanical asynchrony described may occur secondary to postnatal changes in ventricular morphology.", 
    "32": "Eleven patients with essential hypertension were given hydralazine (25 mg b.i.d.) for 2 weeks, hydralazine and propranolol (80 mg b.i.d.) for the next 2 weeks, and propranolol alone for the last 2 weeks. The changes in the renal and systemic circulation elicited by the drugs were studied before start of medication and bi-weekly during the treatment, using non-invasive radioisotope techniques. Hydralazine alone did not alter mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), cardiac index (CI), effective renal plasma flow (ERPF), peripheral renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone (Aldo) but when propranolol was added MAP fell 15.2%, HR 22.5% and CI 18.4%, while ERPF was unchanged. When hydralazine was withdrawn and propranolol was given alone, ERPF decreased 13.2%. Plasma aldosterone was unchanged, whereas PRA decreased during propranolol treatment. The reduction in ERPF elicited by propranolol, was highly significant (P less than 0.01). From the test sequence it appears that dihydralazine prevents this effect of propranolol on kidney function. These findings might have a direct bearing on the choice of antihypertensive treatment.", 
    "33": "Reversible aortic insufficiency was produced in six dogs before and during aortic contrictions at control myocardial inotropy, during high and low inotropy induced by calcium infusion and propranolol administration, respectively. Myocardial chord lengths (MCL) of the left ventricular wall were continuously recorded by ultrasonic technique. Activation of the Frank-Starling mechanism during aortic insufficiency was verified by an increase in end-diastolic length and systolic shortening of MCL. Efficiency of the Frank-Starling mechanism was calculated as the quotient between the rise in systolic shortening and the rise in end-diastolic MCL. At control blood pressure, the efficiency of the Frank-Starling mechanism was 59 +/- 3, 76 +/- 6 and 53 +/- 6% at control, high and low inotropy, respectively. After raising systolic ventricular pressure 30-40 mmHg by aortic constriction, the efficiency of the Frank-Starling mechanism decreased at control inotropy to 41 +/- 7 and at low inotropy to 32 +/- 9% but did not decrease significantly at high inotropy (70 +/- 6%). During periods with aortic insufficiency, left ventricular afterload is increased and it is concluded that the apparent greater efficiency of the Frank-Starling mechanism at high than at low inotropy. At either level of inotropy and afterload examined and at constant heart rate, the Frank-Starling mechanism was activated on a beat to beat basis.", 
    "34": "Postnatal development of autonomic control of heart rate was evaluated in the sinus nodes of isolated, perfused right atria obtained from 21 sibling puppies in three different litters between 3 and 11 wk postpartum. Age-related changes in response to autonomic blockade indicated that propranolol administered after atropine had its most profound direct depressive effect on less mature atrial cells. In the youngest sinus nodes the familial antimuscarinic action (increase in sinus rate) of atropine was regularly preceded by a brief period of cholinomimetic action (a marked slowing of sinus rate) in the youngest sinus nodes. These two opposing effects of atropine underwent a developmental change during the 2-mo study. The cholinomimetic action diminished, whereas the antimuscarinic action increased as a function of age.", 
    "35": "To assess the effects of sudden withdrawal of propranolol on inpatients with coronary artery disease, 102 patients admitted for cardiac catheterization were evaluated. Criteria for inclusion in the study were angiographically documented coronary artery disease, propranolol therapy at a mean daily dose of at least 80 mg and abrupt discontinuation of propranolol therapy before catheterization. There were 55 patients (mean age 52.5) who discontinued propranolol therapy (mean daily dose 127 mg) and a control group of 47 patients (mean age 53) who continued to receive propranolol (mean daily dose 143 mg). The criteria for morbidity were death, myocardial infarction or change in pain pattern. In the withdrawal group there were no deaths, one myocardial infarction judged to be related to catheterization and only one instance of a change in pain pattern. Thus, propranolol rebound appears to occur infrequently among hospitalized patients with reduced activity.", 
    "36": "Use of a screening VMA procedure rather than a specific assay may yield false-positive results. Plasma catecholamine levels should be obtained in the unstressed, supine patient. Pharmacologic tests are less reliable than chemical tests. In the presence of a pheochromocytoma, phenoxybenzamine should be administered before any manipulative procedures, as well as prior to surgery. This agent should be given along initially; propranolol may be added preoperatively.", 
    "37": "In the present experiments we have attempted to determine whether one or more of the biogenic amines are involved in the prehatching and hatching behavior of the chick. Injection of reserpine first induces a depression in ongoing spontaneous motility on day 16 of incubation. Prior to this, reserpine has no apparent effect on embryonic behavior. Reserpine injections on days 17-19 induce a similar behavioral depression that lasts for at least six hours; by 24 hours post-injection the behavior of reserpine-treated embryos is comparable to controls. Injection of reserpine on day 20 (post-pip) delays hatching by about nine hours. Injection of reserpine into the yolk-sac of eggs prior to incubation also delays hatching by eight to nine hours. It is unlikely that the well-known cardiovascular effects of reserpine are involved in the above behavioral results since spinal embryos also exhibit a behavioral depression following reserpine treatment. Biochemical estimation of norepinephrine (NE) in the brain of reserpine-treated embryos suggest that it is release, not depletion, of the catecholamines that is responsible for the behavioral effects. Additional suport for this notion comes from experiments in which 16- or 18-day old embryos were injected with NE, L-dopa or amphetamine. In each case, a behavioral depression similar to that produced by reserpine resulted. Clonidine, a NE agonist induces a depression in certain aspects of embryonic behavior (Types 1 and 2), but also selectively enhances a corrdinated motor pattern (type 3 motility) involved in prehatching behavior (tucking). Clonidine first evokes this behavior pattern one or two days prior to its spontaneous appearance on day 16. After pipping on day 19 or 20 clonidine no longer activates Type 3 behavior, even if injected during the actual hatching process (climax). Since the alpha-adrenergic blocking agent phenoxybenzamine blocks the effect of clonidine on Type 3 tucking behavior, whereas the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol does not, we suggest that tucking and the attainment of the hatching position are mediated by an alpha-adrenergic mechanism in the brain and/or spinal cord. Furthermore, since clonidine affects the Type 3 behavior associated with tucking, but not the somewhat similar coordinated behavior involved in hatching and emergence from the shell (climax), we propose that this later behavior pattern be given a new name, Type 4 motility.", 
    "38": "Eleven adult mongrel dogs were divided into two groups. Group 1 animals served as controls and Group 2 received propranolol (6 mg/kg/day) orally in divided doses for 15 to 21 days. Prior to cardiopulmonary bypass, cardiac output, first derivative of left ventricular pressure (dp/dt), peak systolic pressure, heart rate, and central venous pressure were recorded. The animals were then placed on cardiopulmonary bypass and subjected to 30 minutes of global ischemia at the myocardial temperature of 32 degrees C. Following cessation of cardiopulmonary bypass the baseline studies were repeated. In Group 2 animals following the repeat studies, glucagon was administered at a rate of 0.13 microgram/kg/min. The cardiac index and dp/dt were decreased by 43.3% (p less than 0.001) and 40.5% (p less than 0.001) in comparison to Group 1 animals. In Group 2 dogs, after bypass and glucagon infusion, cardiac index increased by 38% (p less than 0.02), dp/dt rose by 78% (p less than 0.05), and peak systolic pressure increased by 24.8% (p less than 0.05). These studies show the benefit of glucagon in the treatment of low cardiac output in the presence of beta-adrenergic blockade.", 
    "39": "We evaluated propranolol effects on blood pressure, plasma renin activity, and erythrocyte production in nine chronically hemodialyzed and four nondialyzed patients with hypertension and high plasma renin concentrations. Propranolol, at a maximum daily dose of 240 mg, controlled blood pressure in 12 of the 13 patients. During propranolol treatment of dialyzed patients, mean blood pressure fell from 133 +/- 1 to 113 +/- 4 mm Hg (P less than 0.005) and plasma renin activity from 3093 +/- 423 to 689 +/- 218 ng/dl 3h (P less than 0.001). Similar results were obtained in nondialyzed patients. In both groups hematocrit and red cell mass were unchanged, although ferrokinetic measurements suggested a decrease in erythropoiesis. Thus propranolol alone reduces blood pressure and renin activity in chronically dialyzed patients with hypertension and high renin concentrations. No hematologic complications or other side effects were observed. These findings suggest that propranolol may be an effective alternative to bilateral nephrectomy in the control of renin-dependent hypertension in selected patients.", 
    "40": "The development of systemic hypertension, in an eight-year-old girl, after resection of a large arteriovenous malformation, is described. The hypertension was related to an elevated plasma renin activity and was controlled with propranolol. A possible mechanism for the rise in plasma renin activity is postulated.", 
    "41": "In vivo and in vitro techniques have been used to study the effect of catecholamines on gastrin release. The i.v. infusion of epinephrine in dogs produced a significant rise in plasma gastrin concentration. This response was prevented by the administration of propranolol to block beta-adrenergic receptors. The infusion of isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic agonist, produced a significant rise in gastrin levels, while phenylephrine, an alpha-adrenergic agonist, had no effect. In in vitro studies using isolated pieces of rat antrum, isoproterenol stimulated acute phase release of gastrin, whereas phenylephrine was again without effect. The studies indicate that catecholamines directly influence G cell function.", 
    "42": "Among patients with acute myocardial infarction and a normal heart rate and blood pressure, a high incidence of sympathetic overactivity was recorded during transport. The combined administration of atropine and sotalol had no significant effect on the mean maximum heart rate on movement. However, this drug combination prevented excessive slowing of the heart rate. Sotalol caused a significant reduction in the mean maximum heart rate on movement. The side-effects were minimal. 10% of patients who received sotalol required atropine for the correction of bradyarrhythmia.", 
    "43": "Maximal exercise test was performed in 15 patients with essential hypertension before and after 10 days of treatment with oral propranolol in daily doses of 320 mg. After the treatment, heart rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure significantly fell both at rest and after the test; a greater, though not significantly, workload was tolerated; a significant decrease was observed in the product of heart rate and systolic blood pressure, together with a marked reduction in electrocardiographic ischemic changes. Propranolol treatment, besides being an effective antihypertensive agent, improved ischemic changes induced by exercise and cardiac performance in hypertensive patients, also in the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy.", 
    "44": "1. Anion exchange and t.l.c. were used to collect the polar drug metabolites present in urine of dogs treated orally with [14C]bunolol. 2. A new metabolite, 5-hydroxytetralone, was isolated, purified, and identified by u.v.,i.r. and mass spectroscopy. 3. 5-Hydroxytetralone represented 1.7% dose excreted in urine collected for 24 h after bunolol administration. 4. Properties of the metabolite are discussed in relation to the question of whether 5-hydroxytetralone was excreted as a conjugate.", 
    "45": "Starting from the interference between the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system and cardiovascular pathology in arterial hypertension (AH) we have made a correlative study of the cardiovascular system and plasmatic aldosterone in normal and hypertensive subjects under conditions of stimulation (ACTH) and inhibition (propranolol). After administration of ACTH (one of the physiologic mediators of stress) increased values for plasmatic aldosterone were found. Negative cardiovascular effect: arrhthmia, angor, AH, cardiac asthma, under the condition of preexisting cardiovascular pathology or altered steroidogensis, were also noticed. Inhibition with propranolol does not have conclusive effects in AH with normal aldosterone. The best effect were noticed in that hypertension which implies the RAA pressor system in its pathogeny, irrespective of etiology, the reduction AT occurring in parallel with decline in plasmatic aldosterone values and total peripheral resistance (RPT). Administration of propranolol in AH with activated RAA system irrespective of etiology represents a pathogenic treatment able to prevent efficiently the major complications of AH.", 
    "46": "Amphetamine-induced stereotyped behavior in animals is proposed as a model for schizophrenia. Chronic amphetamine administration produces stereotyped behavior and a paranoid schizophreniform syndrome in man, whereas in animals a behavioral sensitization to stereotypy is evoked. We now show that phenylethylamine (PEA), an amphetamine-like stimulant concentrated in the limbic system of human brain, produces stereotypy in rats with a behavioral sensitization when chronically administered. In comparing amphetamine-induced stereotypy with PEA-induced stereotypy, we found that the alpha-adrenergic blocking agents phentolamine and phenoxybenzamine selectively antagonize PEA stereotypy, whereas the beta-adrenergic blocking agent propranolol fails to alter significantly stereotypies evoked by PEA or amphetamine administration. Catecholamine depletion by alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine administration blocks stereotypies induced by both PEA amphetamine, whereas selective norepinephrine depletion antagonizes only PEA stereotypy; the amino acid precursors of both norepinephrine and dopamine potentiate stereotypies. Therefore, PEA-elicited stereotypy, but not amphetamine-elicited stereotypy, is dependent upon norepinephrine; the significance of this for the PEA animal model of schizophrenia is discussed.", 
    "47": "The present experiments were undertaken to study the balance between vascular alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors in canine subcutaneous adipose tissue during sympathetic nerve stimulation and noradrenaline injections. Propranolol potentiated and prolonged the vasoconstrictor response to close i.a. injections of noradrenaline. The vasoconstriction induced by brief nerve stimulation (0.5 to 8 Hz) was, however, unaltered by the beta-adrenoceptor blockade. During prolonged nerve stimulation the vasoconstrictor response was well maintained at 1.5 Hz but at 4 Hz there was a gradual escape. The escape phenomenon at 4 Hz was diminished by propranolol. The beta1-selective antagonist practolol, like propranolol, potentiated and prolonged the vasoconstriction induced by noradrenaline injections and reduced the vasoconstrictor escape during prolonged nerve stimulation at 4 Hz. Furthermore, the vasodilatation induced by noradrenaline injection or nerve stimulation during alpha-adrenoceptor blockade was diminished by practolol. Practolol also blocked the lipolytic response to noradrenaline and nerve stimulation. The beta2-selective antagonist H35/25 blocked the effects of the beta2-selective agonist salbutamol but failed to alter noradrenaline as well as nerve stimulation induced vascular and lipolytic beta-adrenoceptor responses. The present results provide further support for the hypothesis that vascular beta-adrenoceptors in adipose tissue are humoral (noninnervated), preferentially activated by circulating noradrenaline. Moreover, both vascular and lipolytic beta-adrenoceptors activated by noradrenaline in adipose tissue are best classified as beta1-adrenoceptors.", 
    "48": "Vascular reactions in the cat lower leg in response to short-term (10 min) hemorrhagic hypotension (approximately 80 mmHg) were studied before and after regional blockade of the beta-adrenoceptors. In the muscle region with intact beta-adrenoceptors, hemorrhage raised vascular resistance by about 80% and caused a dilatation of the precapillary sphincters, the latter effect evidenced in terms of a 35% increase of the capillary filtration coefficient. Concomitantly, an absorption of extravascular fluid to the blood stream occurred, a process tending to compensate for the reduction of intravascular fluid volume. After regional beta-blockade there was quite a marked augmentation of the hemorrhage induced increase of vascular resistance whereas the inhibition of precapillary sphincter tone and the transcapillary fluid absorption were almost abolished. These observations indicate that bleeding is associated with a significant beta-adrenergic dilator influence in both the resistance vessels and precapillary sphincters of skeletal muscle and that the beta-dilator mechanism may be essential for the important, compensatory fluid gain from the extravascular to the intravascular space during hemorrhage. The observed beta-adrenergic mediation of the net transcapillary fluid absorption could be ascribed to resetting of the pre-/postcapillary resistance ratio, leading to decreased capillary hydrostatic pressure, and to the dilator influence in the precapillary sphincters, leading to an increased number of the patent capillaries available for the transcapillary fluid exchange.", 
    "49": "When increasing reticulocytosis (up to 80%) was induced in rats by treatment with acetyl-phenylhydrazine (up to 70 mg/kg on 3 consecutive days) synthesis of cAMP stimulated by isoprenaline in intact red blood cells and in the related membrane preparations increased up to 100-fold. At the same time the density of beta-adrenoreceptor sites (measured by ligand binding with (3H)(-)-dihydroalprenolol) in the related membrane preparations was only increased about 5-fold. There was however a linear correlation between the increase of isoprenaline-stimulated enzyme activity and the receptor density in membrane preparations. The results indicate that mature red cells contain beta-adrenoreceptor sites but little or not adenyl cyclase activity. Thus, during the maturation process of these cells, enzyme activity and receptor densities decrease at different speeds indicating a different turnover of these two entities of the cytoplasmic membrane.", 
    "50": "This study evaluated the effects of adrenergic agents on immunoreactive calcitonin (iCT) secretion in normal man, and compared the time course and magnitude of these adrenergic effects with those caused by modifying calcium (Ca) ion concentration. Ca infusion (15 mg Ca++/kg iv in 4 h) significantly increased plasma iCT within 1 h, reaching 140 +/- 8% of baseline at 4 h. EDTA (50 mg/kg iv in 2 h) significantly decreased plasma iCT within 15 min, with nadir value of 53 +/- 4.9% of baseline at 2 h. The beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol, significantly increased plasma iCT with 5 min, reaching 136 +/- 5.9% of baseline at 30 min. The alpha-adrenergic antagonist, phentolamine, significantly increased iCT within 15 min, reaching 132 +/- 8.6% of baseline at 45 min. The beta-adrenergic antagonist, propranolol, significantly suppressed iCT with 15 min, reaching 51.8 +/-6.3% of baseline at 2 h. Therefore, 1) the adrenergic system (without induced change in serum Ca) can modify CT secretion to as great a degree as can change in Ca ion concentration induced by standard Ca and EDTA infusion tests and 2) even basal secretion of CT can be modified by adrenergic influences. These data strongly suggest 1) that the adrenergic system is an effective modifier of CT secretion and 2) that the adrenergic system, as well as Ca ion concentration, may play an improtant physiological role in control of CT secretion in man.", 
    "51": "HLA antigen frequencies were determined in patients who had suffered adverse reaction to the beta-adrenergic blocking agent, practolol. No statistically significant differences were observed between these patients and control groups. The latter were selected to include two separate groups, normal random healthy population controls, and controls who had taken practolol with no apparent adverse effects. Patients suffering from the very severe form of reaction, sclerosing peritonitis, were analysed separately from those with other lesion e.g. ocular symptoms, but did not show any significant differences. Altered HLA antigen frequencies were observed for those control patients whose primary diagnosis was hypertension but this was considered to be due to selection bias."
