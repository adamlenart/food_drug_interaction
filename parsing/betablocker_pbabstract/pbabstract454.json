    "0": "The effects of propranolol and hemodilution on myocardial performance and oxygen delivery were evaluated in 36 anesthetized rats. Oral propranolol treatment consisted of 64 mg/kg/d for 6 weeks prior to the experiments, whereas intravenous (IV) propranolol treatment consisted of 5 micrograms/kg/min for 60 minutes after hemodilution. The hematocrit was reduced to 20% by a hetastarch-for-blood exchange. Animals were divided into six equal groups as follows: (1) no oral drug (water), no hemodilution, no IV drug (saline); (2) oral water, hemodilution, IV saline; (3) oral water, no hemodilution, IV propranolol; (4) oral water, hemodilution, IV propranolol; (5) oral propranolol, no hemodilution, IV saline; and (6) oral propranolol, hemodilution, IV saline. Left ventricular (LV) pressure, maximal dP/dt, ascending aortic blood flow, and response to preload (peak cardiac and stroke volume indices) and afterload (LV-developed pressure) stress were measured. In group 2, hemodilution significantly increased cardiac index, stroke volume index, and dP/dt, and decreased blood pressure, peripheral resistance, and oxygen delivery compared with group 1. Compared with group 2, IV propranolol after hemodilution in group 4 significantly decreased cardiac index, dP/dt, LV-developed pressure, and peak cardiac index, and increased peripheral resistance. Stroke volume index and peak stroke volume index after preload stress remained elevated in group 4, despite the negative inotropic effects of IV propranolol. Oral propranolol in group 6 did not prevent the hemodilution-induced increase in stroke volume index and peak stroke volume index in response to preload stress, although it did decrease cardiac index and dP/dt compared with group 2. Oxygen delivery was reduced in the hemodiluted animals in proportion to the decrease in hemoglobin, regardless of propranolol treatment. It is concluded that reduced myocardial contractility and cardiac performance by nonselective pharmacological beta-adrenoceptor blockade does not interfere with the compensatory increase in stroke volume index after hemodilution.", 
    "1": "Guinea pig papillary muscles were preincubated in the presence of 5 x 10(-9) mol/L unlabeled noradrenaline or adrenaline then incubated with (3H)-noradrenaline and superfused. Electrical field stimulation with 180 pulses delivered at 1 or 3 Hz was used to induce overflow of radioactivity. Comparison of the effects of preexposure of the tissue to adrenaline or noradrenaline revealed that adrenaline incubation caused an enhancement of stimulation-evoked overflow of (3H)noradrenaline and a reduction of the effect of exogenously added isoprenaline. Furthermore, the selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118,551 (10(-7) mol/L), but not the selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 89,406 (10(-7) mol/L), reduced electrically evoked overflow of (3H)noradrenaline in tissue preincubated with adrenaline but not in tissue preincubated with noradrenaline. The overflow-reducing effect of ICI 118.551 occurred at stimulation with 3 Hz but not at stimulation with 1 Hz. The present results support the hypothesis that noradrenergic transmission in guinea pig papillary muscle is facilitated via beta 2-adrenoceptors, and that adrenaline may serve as transmitter in this positive feedback mechanism after its incorporation into sympathetic nerves.", 
    "2": "The response of the bladder base to filling and voiding was studied in a surgical dog model in which the bladder base was separated from the main body and closed to form a chamber. In the bladder distension phase there was a reduction in pressure in the bladder base chamber, which implies relaxation of the bladder base. In the expulsion phase the reflex bladder body activity took place with an increase in bladder base pressure, indicating contraction. Relaxation and contraction were blocked by propranolol and phentolamine respectively and both responses were abolished by trimetaphan. It was concluded that the bladder base activity in the micturition cycle is a reflex action mediated via the sympathetic nervous system.", 
    "3": "Although the effect of beta blockers on heart rate (HR) at rest, during exercise, and by ambulatory electrocardiography during the day and night has been studied extensively, data on the effect of these drugs on heart rate during the various stages of sleep are not available. We performed overnight polysomnography and exercise testing in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Latin square crossover study of four beta blockers with different ancillary properties (atenolol 100 mg daily, metoprolol 100 mg, pindolol 10 mg, and propranolol 80 mg), on 30 healthy men aged 23-40 years (29.4 +/- 4.3) (mean +/- SD). At rest pindolol increased HR by 4.7 beats/min +/- 13.1 (p less than 0.05), while beta blockers without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) decreased HR (p less than 0.0001) by 6.1 +/- 8.8 (atenolol), 5.8 +/- 8.4 (propranolol), and 5.0 +/- 9.4 (metoprolol). Exercise at 125 W increased HR on placebo by 76.4 +/- 18.4 beats. Compared to placebo all beta blockers were associated with lower (p less than 0.0001) exercise HR by 18.3 +/- 23.2 atenolol, 21.1 +/- 15.5 metoprolol, 16.8 +/- 14.1 pindolol, and 20.8 +/- 13.1 propranolol [not significant (NS) among beta blockers]. Thus the effect of beta blockers on heart rate was magnified during exercise. Mean and maximum HR were higher in rapid eye movement (REM) than in nonREM (NREM) sleep (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "4": "Age-related changes in alpha 1-, alpha 2-, and beta-catecholamine receptors on membrane of rat epididymal fat cells were investigated. Both young (6 weeks old, weight about 190 g) and aged (20 weeks old, weight about 490 g) Sprague-Dawley male rats were used. For the alpha 1-adrenoceptor binding experiment, we developed a novel analytical method using the hydrophilic alpha 1-receptor selective antagonist, [3H]bunazosin. The binding of [3H]bunazosin to its binding sites was rapid, reversible, saturable, and stereospecific. Scatchard binding analysis showed a single class of binding site. The sites were characterized as alpha 1-adrenoceptors by inhibition experiments using various agonists and antagonists. The number of maximum binding sites (Bmax) of alpha 1-receptor binding was 37.0 +/- 6.5 (young) versus 24.0 +/- 3.2 (aged) fmol/mg protein (P less than 0.01). [3H]Rauwolscine and [3H]CGP-12177 were used for alpha 2- and beta-receptor binding, respectively. In alpha 2-receptor detection using [3H]rauwolscine as a ligand, Bmax increased markedly from 19.8 +/- 4.9 to 86.2 +/- 19.5 fmol/mg protein (P less than 0.01). In contrast, Bmax for beta-receptor decreased from 69.7 +/- 9.7 to 45.4 +/- 13.9 fmol/mg protein with increasing rat age (P less than 0.05). Kd showed no change in each of the binding experiments between young and aged rats. The cell volume increased from 0.07 +/- 0.02 to 0.15 +/- 0.06 nl. It is implied that anti-lipolytic activity strengthened on the whole mainly with the marked increase of alpha 2-receptor number and decrease of beta-receptor number.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "5": "Cocaine inhibits the 5-HT2-mediated (+/-)-DOI-induced head-twitch response (HTR) in mice in a dose-dependent manner. In order to investigate the possible inhibitory mechanism(s) of cocaine on 5-HT2 receptor function, we studied the effects of the selective adrenergic alpha 2 receptor antagonist yohimbine and the beta-adrenergic/5-HT1 receptor antagonist alprenolol, and the 5-HT3 antagonist ICS 205-930 on the inhibitory action of cocaine on the (+/-)-DOI-induced HTR. Neither yohimbine (0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg) nor alprenolol (10 mg/kg) pretreatment had any significant effect on the (+/-)-DOI-induced HTR. However, both antagonists prevented the inhibitory effects of cocaine on the (+/-)-DOI-induced HTR. The 5-HT3 antagonist ICS 205-930 neither produced HTR nor decreased the (+/-)-DOI-induced HTR frequency. The present results suggest that cocaine inhibits 5-HT2 receptor function by increasing the synaptic concentration of norepinephrine and serotonin via inhibition of their uptake and thus indirectly stimulating the respective inhibitory adrenergic alpha 2 and serotonergic 5-HT1A receptors. Furthermore, cocaine's 5-HT3 antagonist properties appear not to play a role in the inhibition of head-twitch behavior.", 
    "6": "The most commonly observed effect of beta-blockade on cardiovascular function has been a reduction in heart rate both at rest and during exercise. The body attempts to compensate by increasing stroke volume and (or) increasing the extraction of O2 from the blood to maintain O2 delivery to the muscle. This paper examines the roles of muscle mass involved in the exercise as well as the time course of change in cardiac output and peripheral blood flow in an attempt to understand whether O2 supply is limited by beta-blockade. Experiments are reported in which the kinetics of cardiac output response at the onset of submaximal cycle exercise were slowed in subjects taking oral propranolol. Taken in consideration with other data from our laboratory and with data in the literature, it was concluded that beta-blockade does impair O2 transport. The degree of impairment is dependent on the total muscle mass involved and the metabolic demand.", 
    "7": "beta-Adrenoceptor blockers are widely used clinically and can be classified as nonselective (beta 1 and beta 2) or selective (beta 1). Impairment of exercise performance is a well-known side effect of this group of drugs. This paper reviews mechanisms that could potentially be responsible for this impairment. In addition to cardiovascular and metabolic effects, beta-blockade inhibits Na(+)-K+ ATPase pumps controlling ion movement between muscle and plasma and thus may contribute to muscle fatigue through this mechanism. To investigate the relationship between the change in plasma [K+] and exercise performance, we studied healthy male subjects taking propranolol. Eight subjects performed maximal incremental cycle ergometer exercise tests during control (no drug), low dose (LD) (40 mg daily), and high dose (HD) (265 +/- 4.3 (SE) mg daily) of propranolol. The control plasma [K+] (5.8 +/- 0.12 mequiv./L) during exercise was significantly lower than either the LD (6.4 +/- 0.05 mequiv./L) or HD (6.1 +/- 0.16 mequiv./L) values. There was no significant difference between plasma [K+] for the LD and HD of propranolol. However, maximum oxygen uptake was reduced only while taking the HD of propranolol. Six of the subjects also performed three 30-s bouts of high intensity exercise on an isokinetic cycle ergometer while taking the LD and HD of propranolol. There was no significant difference between doses for the increase in plasma [K+] (LD, 7.8 +/- 0.35 mequiv./L vs. HD, 7.6 +/- 0.36 mequiv./L) during exercise. However, exercise performance was significantly reduced during HD compared with LD. These results suggest that the increases in plasma [K+] with propranolol did not play a direct significant role in the reduced performance observed during the HD.", 
    "8": "The pharmacology of ethylenediamine (EDA) actions in the rat small intestine was examined using isolated gut-bath preparations of proximal segments of the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. EDA evoked concentration-dependent tetrodotoxin-insensitive relaxations of the intestine, evidently by direct action on the muscularis. Such actions were simultaneous on the longitudinal and circular muscle layers. Investigation of EDA actions on the circular muscle showed that EDA actions were unrelated to any intrinsic GABAergic mechanisms. Moreover, EDA interacted with muscle sites distinct from ATP, histamine, bradykinin, muscarinic, and adrenergic receptors. The ability of EDA to relax the intestinal musculature was generally greater than the smooth muscle relaxant papaverine and substantially better than nicotinic stimulation of the intrinsic inhibitory neurones. It would appear that EDA may be useful as a direct acting smooth muscle relaxant for the study of the physiology-pharmacology of the rodent small intestine.",

Measurements of beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade (reduction of exercise heart rate) and of beta 2-adrenoceptor blockade (attenuation of isoprenaline responses) were made at baseline, and at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 h after drug ingestion. 2. Mean values for Cmax and tmax were as follows: B10 (33 ng ml-1, 3.7 h), B40 (84 ng ml-1, 4.0 h), B80 (179 ng ml-1, 3.7 h); A50 (261 ng ml-1, 2.7 h), A200 (1369 ng ml-1, 2.0 h). 3.

There were similar trends for attenuation of heart rate and DBP responses to isoprenaline. 4. Ratios of beta 1:beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonism were calculated (as % reduction EHR divided by IT100 dose ratio); to provide an index of beta 1-adrenoceptor selectivity at peak and 24 h: B10 7.7 to 8.5, B40 5.8 to 6.2, B80 4.5 to 4.0; A50 10.5 to 7.6, A200 6.1 to 8.8.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

At a dose of 5 mg, Bisoprolol had virtually no beta-2 blocking activity as measured by free fatty acid (FFA) release during terbutaline infusion. At a dose of 10 mg, Bisoprolol had a small but statistically insignificant effect on FFA release similar to 50 mg Atenolol. At a dose of 20 mg, Bisoprolol had significant beta-2 blocking activity. At lower doses, therefore, Bisoprolol is a very selective beta-blocker.", 
    "15": "Diastolic dysfunction is a relatively common problem that may be mild and asymptomatic or may present with congestive heart failure and severe disabling symptoms. It is frequently due to coronary artery disease or left ventricular hypertrophy and it is especially common in the older population. The pathophysiology is related to increased left ventricular passive stiffness and impaired or slowed myocardial relaxation. Patients with diastolic dysfunction are best treated with calcium channel blocking agents or beta-blocking agents (drugs that are generally avoided in patients with significant systolic dysfunction). Most treatment is based on symptomatic relief, and therefore periods of cautious trial and error are the rule. Congestive symptoms are treated with agents that reduce pulmonary venous pressure; in general positive inotropic agents and arterial vasodilators are not useful in heart failure that is due to diastolic dysfunction.",

The isradipine dose necessary to normalize BP (both at rest and post-exercise) was 1.25 mg twice daily (2 x 1/2 tablet) in 50% of patients and 2.5 mg twice daily (2 x 1 tablet) in 25%. In the remaining 25% of patients, isradipine was combined with 1 mg/day bopindolol. There were virtually no accompanying side effects; in particular, reflex tachycardia was negligible or absent.

    "18": "The direct effects of propranolol and metoprolol were studied on cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes by recording cellular contraction with a video signal analyzer of cells movements. The experiments were performed on 3-d-old cultures forming a synchronously beating monolayer. The spontaneous beating frequency of preparations depended on cultures and varied from 100 to 330 beats/min with a peak for the interval 140 to 149 beats/min. Propranolol and metoprolol were tested at 1, 5, 10 microM and 10, 50, 100 microM, respectively. At these doses the two beta-blockers induced chronotropic and inotropic effects in the same range. The two agents induced rapid and short-lasting negative inotropic effects, which were dose-dependent and delayed negative chronotropic effects even with the lowest doses. In some preparations paradoxal effects were evidenced: an increase of the amplitude or frequency of the contractions was observed. The results obtained with 5 microM propranolol or 50 microM metoprolol could be separated in two groups depending on the basal beating rate (less than or greater than to 150 beats/min). In cultures with a rapid frequency, the drugs had a marked negative chronotropic effect and, surprisingly, a positive inotropic effect was observed. These findings confirm the interdependence of the two parameters frequency and amplitude of contraction on this model, and evidence the interest of taking into account the control parameters before any interpretation.", 
    "19": "1. The effects of electrical stimulation and microinjections (90 nl) of the 5-HT1A receptor agonists, flesinoxan and 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), and glutamate into the raphe obscurus on blood pressure, heart rate and phrenic nerve activity (central inspiratory drive) were investigated in rats anaesthetized with alpha-chloralose. 2. Electrical stimulation of the raphe obscurus caused a rise in blood pressure which was associated with bradycardia, while glutamate (2.7 nmol) caused only a rise in blood pressure. 3. Flesinoxan (1.3 nmol) and 8-OH-DPAT (0.7 nmol) increased blood pressure by 9 +/- 1 and 14 +/- 2 mmHg, respectively and did not affect heart rate. For both agonists the effect on blood pressure was shown to be dose-dependent; again no effect on the heart rate was observed over the dose-ranges chosen. 4. Microinjections of the non-selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonists, (+/-)-pindolol (2.7 nmol) or methiothepin (5.2 nmol), into the raphe obscurus prevented the increase in blood pressure caused by microinjection of flesinoxan. However, (+/-)-pindolol caused a sustained rise in blood pressure of 15 +/- 1 mmHg while methiothepin caused a transient rise in blood pressure. Neither drugs affected heart rate. The ability of methiothepin to attenuate the pressor effect of flesinoxan was found to be partially reversed after 30 min. 5. It is suggested that activation of 5-HT1A receptors within the raphe obscurus can cause sympatho-excitation.",

Blood pressure and heart rate (HR) were measured at the beginning of each examination, and end-tidal pCO2(PeCO2) was monitored. The HR decreased significantly in both the PRP and ATN groups (P less than .01), whereas no changes were recorded for both PeCO2 and mean arterial blood pressure (MABP). The comparisons of the CBF differences among groups (ANOVA with the significance levels adjusted by the Bonferroni's correction) showed a significant increase in CBF after ATN as compared with both placebo (P less than .02) and PRP (P less than .01), whereas no significant differences were seen after PRP as compared with placebo.

    "21": "Laryngoscopy and intubation cause an adrenergic response manifested by tachycardia and hypertension. Various pharmacological agents, including fentanyl, have been administered prior to induction in an attempt to attenuate the adrenergic response but they all have limitations. Esmolol, an ultrashort-acting cardioselective beta blocker, has been administered by infusion to successfully protect surgical patients from the stresses of intubation. The objective of our study was to determine if esmolol would be equally effective when administered in a bolus with and without fentanyl. Forty-four ASA I and II females undergoing elective surgery were randomly divided into four groups and received the following agents prior to intubation: Group 1-esmolol 1 mg/kg and fentanyl 2 micrograms/kg, Group 2-placebo (normal saline), Group 3-esmolol 1 mg/kg and Group 4-fentanyl 3.5 micrograms/kg. Groups 1 and 4, which received fentanyl, demonstrated significantly less elevation in blood pressure. Esmolol appeared to attenuate increases in heart rate. Esmolol has a tissue distribution time of 2 minutes and an elimination half-life of 9 minutes. The window of its availability to the tissues is narrow, and timing of bolus administration is more critical than in administration by infusion. Doses in excess of 1 mg/kg appear to be necessary for effective control of heart rate. However, when used with fentanyl, esmolol provides effective protection against the adrenergic response to laryngoscopy and intubation.", 
    "22": "The influence of methylene blue, an inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase, on responses to ventilatory and precapillary hypoxia was investigated in the intact-chest cat under conditions of controlled blood flow and constant left atrial pressure. Because methylene blue increased vascular tone, responses to hypoxia were compared when lobar arterial pressure was raised to similar levels with U 46619 and with methylene blue. When lobar arterial pressure was raised with U 46619, ventilation with 7.5% O2 increased lobar arterial pressure significantly. Infusion of methylene blue in concentrations that raised lobar arterial pressure to a value similar to that attained with U 46619 prevented the pressor response to hypoxia, and a significant depressor response was unmasked. The depressor response to hypoxia in the methylene blue-treated animal was not altered by meclofenamate but was blocked by propranolol. A reduction in lobar arterial perfusate PO2 induces an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance in the cat, and this response was prevented by methylene blue. During methylene blue infusion, the vasodilator response to acetylcholine was reduced, whereas the response to isoproterenol was not altered. Although the response to hypoxia was prevented, the pressor response to prostaglandin F2 alpha was not changed. The response to ventilatory hypoxia was enhanced by propranolol or ICI 118551, suggesting that the response is modulated by circulating catecholamines that are probably of adrenal origin. The effects of methylene blue on vascular tone and responses to hypoxia and acetylcholine were reversible, and responses returned to control value after the infusion was terminated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "23": "Thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT) is stimulated by catecholamine activation of adenylate cyclase through the beta-adrenergic receptor. Recently it was reported that the beta-adrenergic antagonist CGP-12177A stimulates oxygen consumption in BAT. To investigate the mechanism of action of CGP-12177A in BAT, we assessed the inhibitory and stimulatory affects of CGP-12177A on the adenylate cyclase system in myocardial and BAT membranes from rats. CGP-1277A inhibited isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in a dose-dependent manner, with an inhibitory constant (Ki) of 1.94 +/- 0.18 microM in BAT and 0.49 +/- 0.11 microM in the heart. However, in the absence of isoproterenol, CGP-12177A stimulated adenylate cyclase in BAT with two components of activation, and half-maximal stimulation occurred at 1 microM and 1.5 mM. In contrast, CGP-12177A did not stimulate adenylate cyclase activity in heart membranes. Propranolol inhibited the isoproterenol-stimulated activity with a potency that was one log less in BAT compared with heart. Propranolol fully blocked the high-affinity component but only weakly blocked the low-affinity component of CGP-12177A-stimulated activity in BAT. Pindolol was also less potent in BAT but inhibited the CGP-12177A-stimulated activity in a manner similar to the inhibition of the isoproterenol-stimulated activity, suggesting the CGP-12177A activation was beta-receptor mediated. Binding curves of [125I]iodocyanopindolol ([125I]ICYP) in competition with CGP-12177A demonstrated a shift to lower affinity in the presence of beta,gamma-imidoguanosine 5'-triphosphate, indicating that CGP-12177A has agonist properties with respect to the [125I]ICYP binding site.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "24": "The interaction of [(-)-4-(3-t-butylamino-2-hydroxy-propoxy)benzimidazol-2-one] (CGP 12177) (CGP) with receptors that couple to adenylate cyclase was examined in membrane homogenates from rat interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT). Although typically regarded as a beta adrenoceptor antagonist, CGP stimulated adenylate cyclase activity with an activation constant of about 3 microM. Consistent with its classification as an antagonist, CGP inhibited norepinephrine-stimulated cyclase activity and did so at concentrations that had little or no stimulatory effect. CGP also inhibited activity stimulated by the atypical agonist [(R*,R*)-4-[2-[[2[(3-chlorophenyl)-2- hydroxyethyl]amino]propyl]phenyl]phenoxyacetic acid (BRL 37344), but only at CGP concentrations that stimulated activity when tested alone. The beta-1-selective antagonist ICI 89,406 blocked norepinephrine-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity, but did not inhibit the activity stimulated by CGP. Together, these results indicate that CGP modulates IBAT adenylate cyclase by interacting with two receptors. One is the beta-1 receptor of which CGP is a high-affinity antagonist. The second appears to be an atypical receptor of which CGP is a partial agonist.", 
    "25": "Intracellular Ca++ ([Ca++]i) is one of the most important second messengers of extracellular signals that induce cellular responses. In epidermal keratinocytes, both extracellular and intracellular Ca++ are reported to be important to cell differentiation and proliferation. Several mechanisms that increase [Ca++]i have been elicited in various tissues; however, in epidermal keratinocytes they remain unknown. Thus, we investigated the [Ca++]i modulation in cultured human epidermal keratinocytes and the stimulation that increases the concentration. The [Ca++]i concentration of keratinocytes was increased immediately and transiently by epinephrine. Methoxamine hydrochloride and clonidine (alpha-1- and 2-adrenergic agonists) did not induce an increase in [Ca++]i. The beta-antagonist, propranolol, inhibited the [Ca++]i increase induced by epinephrine and salbutamol (a beta-2-agonist). These results reveal that the beta-adrenergic stimulation induces an immediate and transient [Ca++]i increase in human keratinocytes. Beta-adrenergic stimulation is known to induce adenylate cyclase activation, which results in cyclic AMP accumulation through stimulatory guanosine 5-triphosphate (GTP) binding proteins in the keratinocytes. Also, epinephrine is reported to inhibit cultured epidermal cell proliferation. The effect of epinephrine has been demonstrated by cyclic AMP accumulation; however, beta-adrenergic stimulation revealed a [Ca++]i increase in keratinocytes in our study. One of epinephrine's regulatory effects on epidermal cell proliferation is assumed to occur through the [Ca++]i increase as well.", 
    "26": "The Trial of Antihypertensive Interventions and Management is a multicenter randomized trial designed to examine the diastolic blood pressure response of various combinations of pharmacological and dietary interventions in the treatment of mild hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 90-100 mm Hg). Eight hundred and seventy-eight participants at 110-160% of ideal weight were randomly allocated to nine drug/diet treatment groups receiving either a placebo, chlorthalidone (25 mg), or atenolol (50 mg), combined with a usual, a weight loss, or a low sodium/high potassium diet. The primary outcome was diastolic blood pressure change from baseline to 6 months. Seven hundred and eighty-seven participants had follow-up data. The mean baseline diastolic blood pressure was 93.8 mm Hg; 55.9% of the participants were male, and the weight loss diet group lost an average of 4.7 kg. Multiple comparisons were accounted for in the analysis. A significantly greater lowering of diastolic blood pressure (12.4 mm Hg) was achieved in the atenolol group compared with either the low sodium/high potassium diet group (7.9 mm Hg, p = 0.001) or weight loss group (8.8 mm Hg, p = 0.006). Adding weight loss to chlorthalidone significantly enhanced blood pressure lowering (15.1 mm Hg) when compared with the diuretic alone (10.8 mm Hg, p = 0.002), but adding a low sodium/high potassium diet (12.2 mm Hg, p = 0.029) did not. In the short-term treatment of mild hypertension where diastolic blood pressure is the sole consideration, drugs outperform diet, and weight loss is beneficial, especially with diuretics.", 
    "27": "In the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) Phase II trial, patients received intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) and were randomized to either a conservative or an invasive strategy. Within this study, the effects of immediate versus deferred beta-blocker therapy were also assessed in patients eligible for beta-blocker therapy, a group of 1,434 patients of which 720 were randomized to the immediate intravenous group and 714 to the deferred group. In the immediate intravenous group, within 2 hours of initiating rt-PA metoprolol was given (5 mg intravenously at 2-minute intervals over 6 minutes, for a total intravenous dose of 15 mg, followed by 50 mg orally every 12 hours in the first 24 hours and 100 mg orally every 12 hours thereafter). The patients assigned to the deferred group received metoprolol, 50 mg orally twice on day 6, followed by 100 mg orally twice a day thereafter. The therapy was tolerated well in both groups and the primary end point, resting global ejection fraction at hospital discharge, averaged 50.5% and was virtually identical in the two groups. The regional ventricular function was also similar in the two groups. Overall, there was no difference in mortality between the immediate intravenous and deferred groups, but in the subgroup defined as low risk there were no deaths at 6 weeks among those receiving immediate beta-blocker therapy in contrast to seven deaths among those in whom beta-blocker therapy was deferred. These findings for a secondary end point in a subgroup were not considered sufficient to warrant a recommendation regarding clinical use. There was a lower incidence of reinfarction (2.7% versus 5.1%, p = 0.02) and recurrent chest pain (18.8% versus 24.1%, p less than 0.02) at 6 days in the immediate intravenous group. Thus, in appropriate postinfarction patients, beta-blockers are safe when given early after thrombolytic therapy and are associated with decreased myocardial ischemia and reinfarction in the first week but offer no benefit over late administration in improving ventricular function or reducing mortality.", 
    "28": "We investigated the contractile response of isolated rabbit middle cerebral artery (MCA) segments to electrical field stimulation (EFS). The dynamics of the EFS contraction were compared with a similar-sized branch of rabbit ear artery. In comparison with the ear artery, the EFS contractions of the MCA displayed a longer latency and a higher stimulus frequency threshold. Greater stimulation train lengths were required to attain equilibrium, and the time course of EFS response--including force development, plateau, and return to rest tension--was significantly slower than in the ear artery. Morphological and pharmacological studies of the MCA showed that it receives sympathetic adrenergic innervation: whole-mount preparations displayed catecholamine histofluorescence; electron micrographs of MCA sections revealed a population of varicosities containing chromaffin positive large and small vesicles; and EFS contractions were blocked by tetrodotoxin (30 nM) and guanethidine (5 microM) and by chronic surgical sympathectomy. Exposure to prazosin (10 microM) or phenoxybenzamine (1 microM) blocked norepinephrine contractions but did not significantly influence the EFS contraction. Procedures and drugs that antagonized the responses to neuropeptide Y, serotonin, or histamine were also ineffective in blocking the EFS contraction. The involvement of ATP could not be assessed, since the purinergic P2 agonist alpha,beta-methylene ATP was ineffective in blocking ATP-mediated contractions. The EFS contraction, however, could be blocked by a combination of neuropeptide Y desensitization and phenoxybenzamine (30 nM) or prazosin (0.1 microM). These results suggest that norepinephrine and neuropeptide Y are released from sympathetic nerves and mediate EFS contraction by occupation of postjunctional alpha-adrenoceptor and neuropeptide Y receptors. Since the blockade of only one of these components does not diminish the response to EFS, the adrenergic neuroeffector system in this artery may involve complex prejunctional regulatory mechanisms.", 
    "29": "To assess the relation between increases in contractile function and oxygen consumption (VO2) during increased coronary flow (Gregg's phenomenon), we measured the end-systolic pressure-volume relation and the relation between VO2 and left ventricular systolic pressure-volume area (PVA, a measure of total mechanical energy output) in blood-perfused, isovolumically contracting rabbit hearts during control and intracoronary adenosine infusion. During adenosine infusion at a constant perfusion pressure (93 +/- 11 mm Hg), coronary flow increased by 99 +/- 76% (p less than 0.01), and the slope of the end-systolic pressure-volume relation, Emax (ventricular contractility index), increased by 18 +/- 15% (p less than 0.01). When compared at the same left ventricular volume, PVA increased by 20 +/- 14% (p less than 0.01) and VO2 by 19 +/- 15% (p less than 0.01) with adenosine. The VO2-PVA relation was linear under each condition (both median r = 0.98). With increased coronary flow, the VO2-intercept of the VO2-PVA relation (unloaded VO2) increased by 22 +/- 18% (p less than 0.01) without a change in the slope; that is, a parallel upward shift was observed, indicating that the contractile efficiency (energy conversion efficiency of the contractile machinery) remained constant. These increases in Emax and unloaded VO2 were not eliminated by beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol. We conclude that increased coronary flow with adenosine at a constant perfusion pressure augments both Emax and the nonmechanical energetic cost for excitation-contraction coupling and basal metabolism via nonadrenergic mechanisms, without changing contractile efficiency.", 
    "30": "A physiologic response such as mucin secretion from epithelial cells in vivo may be under the control of several endogenous substances such as acetylcholine, norepinephrine, and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). These substances may simultaneously activate distinct membrane receptors that exist on the same epithelial cells, and this activation may result in reciprocal physiologic responses or functional antagonism. To test whether simultaneous activation of the VIP and muscarinic receptors or of beta-adrenoreceptors and muscarinic receptors affect mucin secretion in a reciprocal manner, we studied some characteristics of the resultant physiologic response in human epithelial cells secreting radiolabeled mucin-like glycoprotein (MLGP). Both basal and methacholine (M.chol)-induced MLGP secretion could be blocked by VIP (1 pM to 1 microM) and by isoproterenol (ISO) (0.1 nM to 10 nM) in a concentration-dependent and reversible manner. In a membrane preparation from the same cells, VIP (1 to 1,000 nM) and ISO (0.1 to 10 microM) stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in a concentration-dependent and nonadditive manner. In the same membrane preparation, no effect of M.chol was observed on this response to VIP or to ISO. It is proposed that functional antagonism at the cellular level between basal or cholinergic-stimulated mucin secretion and either activated beta-adrenergic or VIP receptors may play a crucial role in modulation of mucin secretion from epithelial cells.", 
    "31": "Labetalol has been advocated to rapidly decrease blood pressure in preeclamptic women and to blunt the hemodynamic response to tracheal intubation. To assess labetalol's actions in a setting of uterine vasoconstriction, saline or labetalol (1 mg/kg) was infused into maternal venous catheters in 12 pregnant ewes receiving continuous maternal intravenous infusions of norepinephrine. Norepinephrine increased maternal mean arterial pressure (MAP) to 120 +/- 4% of control and decreased uterine blood flow to 45 +/- 6% of control. Labetalol, but not saline, altered these parameters: it decreased MAP to 101 +/- 3% and increased uterine blood flow to 70 +/- 7% of prenorepinephrine values. In the second protocol, to assess the degree of labetalol-induced fetal adrenergic blockade, 7 pregnant ewes received, on separate days, saline or labetalol (0.3, 1.0, 3.0 mg/kg) via a maternal venous catheter. Maternally administered labetalol produced minor (less than 12%) decreases in maternal and fetal MAP, without significantly altering heart rate (HR). At each labetalol dose, the degree of alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade, determined by phenylephrine and isoproterenol challenge, was greater in the ewe than in the fetus. In the near-term pregnant ewe, intravenous (iv) bolus administration of labetalol ameliorated the effects of increased circulating norepinephrine on maternal MAP, uterine blood flow, and fetal pH and arterial O2 tension (PaO2), and produced less adrenergic blockade in the fetus than in the mother.", 
    "32": "The nadir of SaO2 during an obstructive apnea is dependent upon the apnea's duration and the rate of fall of saturation (dSaO2/dt). We postulated that a low Q, such as in patients with congestive heart failure with sleep apnea, or a reduction in Q, as seen in some humans during obstructive sleep apnea, might steepen dSaO2/dt. The mechanism postulated was lowering of SvO2 with increased pulmonary capillary blood oxygen uptake and faster depletion of alveolar oxygen. This study examines dSaO2/dt following the onset of apnea in eight spontaneously breathing adult baboons. Nonrepetitive obstructive apneas (30, 45, and 60 seconds) were created by clamping an indwelling cuffed endotracheal tube at the end of expiration. Following baseline measurements, the animals were given a bolus of a rapid-acting beta-adrenergic blocker followed by continuous infusion to reduce cardiac output and to limit the cardiovascular response to obstructive asphyxia. Fiberoptic catheters were used for continuous monitoring of SaO2, SvO2, and cardiac output. Esophageal pressure and relative thoracic gas volume (Respitrace) were monitored to insure equivalence of lung volume at the onset of apnea. Beta-adrenergic blockade reduced resting Q by a mean of 25 percent. The blocked vs unblocked dSaO2/dt was 0.73 vs 0.72 percent/s, 0.76 vs 0.73 percent/s, and 0.70 vs 0.71 percent/s for 30-second, 45-second, and 60-second apneas, respectively. Thus, mean dSaO2/dt for all durations of apneas was unaffected by beta-adrenergic blockade. We concluded that dSaO2/dt is not influenced by limited Q preceding or induced by obstructive asphyxia.", 
    "33": "beta-Adrenergic blockers have had widespread use in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Some agents of this class have been shown to reduce the incidence of total mortality, cardiovascular mortality, sudden death, and nonfatal reinfarction in survivors of acute myocardial infarction. The mechanism for this cardioprotective action is not known. Antiarrhythmic action and hemodynamic alterations have been suggested as possible mechanisms. An anticoagulant mechanism is another possibility, although the antiplatelet effects of beta-blockers are weak. It is now believed that antithrombotic effects may be related to the prevention of coronary artery plaque rupture and the subsequent propagation of an occlusive arterial thrombus rather than a direct anticoagulant action. The therapeutic ability beta-blockers to attenuate the hemodynamic consequences of catecholamine surgers, as they do in aortic dissection, may protect a vulnerable plaque from fracture, reducing the risk of coronary thrombosis, myocardial infarction, and death. Celiprolol, a third-generation beta 1-selective adrenergic blocker with partial beta 2-agonist activity, is comparable to other beta-blockers in antihypertensive and antianginal activity. It has additional actions that may be beneficial to patients: (1) it does not adversely affect lipids and lipoproteins; (2) it does not appear to depress the myocardium in patients with left ventricular dysfunction; (3) it can lower serum fibrinogen levels; and (4) it can cause regression of myocardial mass in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy.", 
    "34": "Hypertension often is associated with concomitant conditions such as chronic obstructive lung disease, diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, and peripheral vascular disease. Moreover, other cardiovascular risk factors, including dyslipidemias and abnormalities of glucose and insulin metabolism, are common in patients with hypertension. Conventional beta-blockers used for antihypertensive therapy can have adverse effects in patients with airway disease, diabetes, and peripheral vascular disease, and can exaggerate the other risk factors. Newer beta-blockers such as celiprolol, which have selective partial agonist activity expressed at beta 2-receptors, appear to avoid these problems. Celiprolol exhibits antianginal and antihypertensive efficacy without adversely effecting left ventricular systolic function or exercise performance. It also may cause regression of left ventricular hypertrophy. The stimulatory action of celiprolol on vascular beta 2-receptors enhances regional flow and may increase walking distance in patients with claudication. The reduction in renal vascular resistance demonstrated by this drug is associated with preservation of renal blood flow and function. Spirometric measurements of airway function are unchanged during celiprolol treatment. Similarly, there are no adverse effects on lipid or glucose concentrations. These new developments in beta-blocker pharmacology indicate that this class of agents could be used in patients with hypertension with concomitant diseases or risk factors other than high blood pressure.", 
    "35": "The objective of treating patients with hypertension is not simply to reduce blood pressure but rather to prevent the associated morbidity and mortality. Recent assessments of clinical trials have shown that while the risk of stroke is consistently lower with antihypertensive therapy, the same degree of success has not been demonstrated for coronary artery disease (CAD). Although there are many explanations of why we have not done as well in preventing CAD, one possibility is that the therapy used in clinical trials, primarily thiazide diuretics and beta-adrenoreceptor blockers, has increased the patient's risk of developing coronary atherosclerosis or lethal arrhythmias. Four classes of antihypertensive agents are recommended for initial therapy--thiazide diuretics, beta-adrenoreceptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and calcium entry blockers. The metabolic effects of thiazide diuretics include electrolyte disturbances (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hyponatremia), dyslipidemia (increased triglycerides), abnormalities of glucose metabolism (hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and peripheral insulin resistance), and hyperuricemia. beta-Adrenoreceptor blockers have many of the same metabolic adverse reactions. beta-Adrenoreceptor blockers without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) also cause dyslipidemias (lowered high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and increased triglycerides) and abnormalities of glucose metabolism (hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and peripheral insulin resistance). beta-Adrenoreceptor blockers with ISA and third-generation beta-blockers with selective partial agonist activity (celiprolol and dilevalol) do not cause dyslipidemia and to date do not appear to induce abnormalities in glucose metabolism. ACE inhibitors may decrease triglycerides and increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and captopril may improve insulin sensitivity. Calcium entry blockers are metabolically neutral.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "36": "The expected reduction in coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality has not been observed in intervention trials with antihypertensive agents, and attention has focused on the lipid and lipoprotein effects of antihypertensive agents. Diuretics, especially thiazides, chlorthalidone, and the loop diuretics, increase total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels with generally no significant change in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Selective and nonselective beta-blockers decrease high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and increase triglyceride levels, whereas those with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity do not significantly alter lipid and lipoprotein levels. Celiprolol, a beta-blocker with vasodilatory effects, appears to favorably affect lipid and lipoprotein levels as do the alpha 1-adrenergic blockers. The other commonly used antihypertensive agents do not produce significant effects.", 
    "37": "Celiprolol is a new-generation beta-blocker with ancillary properties that include partial beta 2-agonism and direct vasodilating activity. The effects of atenolol and celiprolol on maximal exercise capacity and on both respiratory variables and subjective indices of breathlessness and fatigue during submaximal exercise were compared in a placebo-controlled crossover study of 12 trained volunteers. Both atenolol and celiprolol equally and significantly reduced exercise capacity and maximal oxygen consumption. During constant submaximal exercise at 70% maximal oxygen uptake, however, differences emerged between the two beta-blockers. Atenolol was associated with a significantly higher minute ventilation than placebo. In contrast, values for minute ventilation and respiratory exchange ratio with celiprolol were similar to values with placebo. During the early stages of exercise, treatment with atenolol was also associated with higher scores for the subjective indices of breathlessness and fatigue. Thus submaximal exercise, which may be physiologically more relevant to the everyday activities of patients, may demonstrate potentially useful differences between drugs that are not seen during maximal exercise testing.", 
    "38": "Celiprolol is a new antihypertensive agent that represents a new generation of beta-blockers. It combines cardioselective beta-adrenergic antagonism (beta 1) with a mild vasodilation via vasoselective beta-adrenergic agonism (beta 2). Results of animal studies show that celiprolol has beta 1-antagonist potency similar to that of propranolol and atenolol, and cardioselectivity slightly greater than that of atenolol. Celiprolol does not produce bronchoconstriction but has mild propranolol-resistant bronchodilatory properties in cats. The compound also relaxes vascular smooth muscle in a propranolol-sensitive fashion, suggesting a mechanism of beta 2-agonism. The beta 2-agonism results in a selective downregulation in beta 2-receptor number and response in tissue culture, as well as in peripheral tissue from celiprolol-treated volunteers. The decreases in beta 2-receptors are blocked by concomitant treatment with propranolol. Celiprolol is devoid of cardiac depressant activity and in fact has mild cardiostimulatory actions. The cardiostimulation is not via beta 1-stimulation, since it is not abolished by beta-blocking doses of propranolol. In a model of severe myocardial ischemia, celiprolol attenuates the ischemia-induced myocardial acidosis and improves the regional segment function. These results are suggestive of myocardial protection. In summary, celiprolol distinguishes itself from other beta-blockers by virtue of its cardioselectivity, vasorelaxation via beta 2-agonism, and the lack of bronchoconstriction and cardiodepression. These properties observed in animal studies have also been documented in clinical trials.", 
    "39": "The factors to be considered in selecting antihypertensive agents have traditionally centered around balancing efficacy against adverse side effects. The former can be achieved by a variety of agents alone or in combination. The latter not only involves safety but is also concerned with whether an otherwise safe agent is tolerated by the patient so compliance with the treatment regimen can be achieved. A relatively new consideration is how antihypertensive agents affect other disease states that may or may not be associated with hypertension. For example, how a drug may affect diabetes, gout, myocardial hypertrophy, atherosclerosis, and coronary events must be evaluated. These concerns taken together answer the question of why yet another antihypertensive agent may be needed in the pharmacologic armamentarium.", 
    "40": "Intact human neuroepithelioma SK-N-MC cells bound the beta-adrenergic antagonist (-)-[3H]-CGP 12177 with a KD of 0.13 nM and a Bmax of 17,500 sites/cell. When the cells were exposed to beta-adrenergic agonists, they accumulated cyclic AMP in the following order of potency: isoproterenol much greater than norepinephrine greater than epinephrine, which is indicative of a beta 1-subtype receptor. Membranes prepared from the cells bound (-)-3-[125I]iodocyanopindolol with a KD of 11.5 pM. Inhibition of agonist-stimulated cyclic AMP production and competition binding experiments indicated that the beta 1-selective antagonists CGP 20712A and ICI 89,406 were much more potent than the beta 2-selective antagonist ICI 118,551. Analysis of the displacement curves indicated that the cells contained only beta 1-adrenergic receptors. Northern blot analysis of SK-N-MC mRNA using cDNA probes for the beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors revealed the presence of a very strong beta 1-adrenergic receptor mRNA signal, while under the same conditions no beta 2-adrenergic receptor mRNA was observed. Thus, SK-N-MC cells appear to express a pure population of beta 1-adrenergic receptors. When the cells were exposed to isoproterenol, there was no observable desensitization during the first hour. After longer exposure, desensitization slowly occurred and the receptors slowly down-regulated to 50% of control levels by 24 h. Other agents that elevate cyclic AMP levels, such as forskolin, cholera toxin, and cyclic AMP analogues, caused no or little substantial receptor loss.", 
    "41": "Early exposure of developing postsynaptic receptors to the appropriate neurotransmitter is thought to be important for establishing the pattern of receptor development and function. We have examined the role of fetal catecholamines in central nervous system beta-adrenergic receptor maturation by administering the beta-adrenergic antagonist, propranolol, throughout gestation via continuous maternal infusion in rats. After birth, we examined beta-receptor binding of [125I]pindolol in three brain regions. In the cerebral cortex, receptor binding was relatively normal in the propranolol group during the immediate postpartum period, but eventually became elevated in young adulthood. Binding characteristics were not significantly affected in midbrain + brainstem or cerebellum. These data support a role for fetal catecholamines in the programming of subsequent receptor development, but in a fashion selective for specific brain regions.", 
    "42": "Rat liver ornithine decarboxylase induction by dexamethasone or laparatomy, which is dramatically impaired by catecholamine depletion, is not affected by alpha-and beta -adrenergic blockers administered simultaneously 1 h prior to steroid injection or operation. However, if blockade is maintained for 24 h, an effect comparable to that of catecholamine depletion is obtained. Reciprocally, the response of the decarboxylase to catecholamines is severely compromised in adrenalectomized rats. Under the same conditions, induction of tyrosine aminotransferase by dexamethasone is not significantly affected by catecholamine availability, which altogether demonstrates that rat liver ornithine decarboxylase activity is specifically governed by the interaction between glucocorticoids and catecholamines.", 
    "43": "In the presence of 5 microM-DL-propranolol and in HCO3(-)-containing buffers, 1 microM-adrenaline acutely stimulated protein synthesis by about 25% in the anterogradely perfused rat heart. This stimulation was opposed by low (1-10 nM) concentrations of prazosin, but not by similar concentrations of yohimbine, suggesting involvement of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor. Under the same conditions, adrenaline raised intracellular pH (pHi) by about 0.1 unit. The increase in pHi induced by adrenaline was prevented by 5 nM-prazosin, but not by 5 nM-yohimbine, again suggesting involvement of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor. Since an increase in pHi stimulates protein synthesis in the heart [Sugden & Fuller (1991) Biochem. J. 273, 339-346], the increase in pHi induced by adrenaline may be involved in its stimulation of protein synthesis. Adrenaline also increased phosphocreatine concentrations. As discussed, the increase in pHi induced by adrenaline may be responsible for this effect. Using second-order polynomial regression analysis, we showed that rates of protein synthesis were significantly correlated (P less than 0.0001) with phosphocreatine concentrations. We discuss two possible reasons for this correlation: (i) increases in pHi stimulate protein synthesis and separately raise phosphocreatine concentrations, or (ii) the increase in protein synthesis rates is a consequence of the raised phosphocreatine concentrations induced by the increase in pHi. Rates of protein synthesis were not significantly correlated with ATP/ADP concentration ratios, nor with any of the following: ATP, ADP, AMP or total adenine nucleotide concentrations. In freshly isolated adult rat cardiomyocytes, the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine (1 microM) prevented stimulation of protein synthesis by 0.3 microM-adrenaline (and by 1 microM-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or 1 m-unit of insulin/ml). The results are discussed within a mechanistic framework initiated by stimulation of the hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids by alpha 1-adrenergic agonists.", 
    "44": "The availability of thrombolytic agents for use in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction is an important step in the management of a common, often debilitating, and potentially lethal disorder. However, despite the proven benefits of coronary thrombolysis, the importance of adjunctive treatment modalities is being increasingly recognized. Beta-adrenergic blockers, calcium antagonists, nitrates, magnesium, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors each exert favorable cardiovascular properties that may offer additional benefits. Clinical trials combining thrombolytic and adjunctive pharmacologic agents offer hope for further advances in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "45": "Use of methanol as a solvent in a toxicological screening procedure with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry may be associated with artifact formation. Artifacts with a molecular ion of [M + 12]+ are formed from various drugs, such as amphetamine, propafenone, flecainide, beta-blockers and prilocaine. The mechanism of artifact formation was studied by mass spectral techniques, labelling and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. It was shown that the artifacts were generated by the addition of formaldehyde and subsequent loss of water. Formaldehyde is probably formed by thermal dehydrogenation of methanol in the injection port of the gas chromatograph.", 
    "46": "We have previously reported that the response of cultured chick cerebellar neurons to glutamate is enhanced by noradrenaline (NA) or isoproterenol and suppressed by clonidine. The present study was carried out to further specify the adrenergic receptor subtypes involved in the facilitatory effect of NA or isoproterenol and the suppressive effect of clonidine, and to examine the intracellular mechanisms underlying these modulatory effects of NA. The clonidine effect, which was mimicked by NA iontophoresed with large ejecting currents, was blocked by yohimbine and tolazoline (alpha 2 antagonists) and also by dibutyryl cyclic AMP or forskolin which augmented the glutamate response by itself. Prazosin, an alpha 1 receptor antagonist did not block the clonidine effect. NA- or isoproterenol-induced facilitation, which was mimicked by denopamine (beta 1 agonist), was antagonized by acebutolol (beta 1 antagonist) and not by ICI 118,551 (beta 2 antagonist). Pretreatment of neurons with pertussis toxin for more than 24 h blocked the suppressive action of clonidine without affecting the facilitatory action of isoproterenol. Furthermore, intracellular injection of GDP beta S inhibited the modulatory effects of either clonidine or isoproterenol. These results indicate that the facilitatory and inhibitory modulatory effects of NA may be mediated by beta 1 and alpha 2 receptors linked to cAMP systems, respectively, and the former is coupled with the stimulatory G protein (Gs) and the latter is with the inhibitory G protein (Gi).", 
    "47": "The correlations of 11 indexes of heart rate variability were examined with pharmacologically determined cardiac vagal tone in 15 normal subjects at supine rest. After sympathetic influences by intravenous propranolol were eliminated, RR interval variability was measured for 10 minutes under controlled respiration (0.25 Hz), and cardiac vagal tone was determined as the decrease in mean RR interval following complete vagal blockade with atropine. Time domain indexes (standard deviation, coefficient of variance and mean successive difference) correlated strongly with vagal tone (r = 0.87, 0.81 and 0.92, respectively; p less than 0.001 for all). The same was true for frequency domain indexes for the high-frequency (0.25 Hz) component calculated both by autoregressive spectrum analysis (square root of power and coefficient of component variance) and by fast Fourier transform (mean amplitude) (r = 0.91, 0.85 and 0.86, respectively; p less than 0.0001 for all). However, frequency domain indexes for the low-frequency spectral component (0.03 to 0.15 Hz) correlated less strongly (r = 0.69, 0.55 and 0.70, respectively), and the fraction of power [power/(total power greater than 0.03 Hz)] of both components showed no correlation. Principal component analysis showed that the first 6 indexes with strong correlations contained solely the first principal component closely related to vagal tone, whereas the remaining 5 indexes also contained the second component unrelated to vagal tone. These results indicate that most of the time and frequency domain analyses in use provides an accurate and common measure of cardiac vagal tone at rest.", 
    "48": "Numerous studies have assessed the ability of exercise modalities to predict patient outcome after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Implicit in the use of these prior data to assess the prognosis of patients currently undergoing exercise studies is the assumption that patients selected for exercise assessment are similar over time and that the data generated in the past are therefore applicable to the current patient populations. This study retrospectively assessed the clinical, exercise, and rest and exercise radionuclide angiographic data in 791 consecutive patients referred for exercise radionuclide angiography within 1 month after AMI during a 5-year period to determine if the clinical and exercise characteristics of patients referred for exercise evaluation after infarction have changed significantly over time. Most parameters examined demonstrated significant increasing trends, including thrombolytic therapy at the time of AMI, revascularization procedure between AMI and exercise assessment, age, beta-blocker usage, Q-wave AMI, inferior infarction, exercise double product, exercise capacity, significant ST-segment depression with exercise, peak ejection fraction, and change in ejection fraction with exercise. These data indicate that the characteristics of patients selected to undergo exercise after AMI in a large referral center have changed significantly over time. If these data are applicable to other referral centers and to other exercise testing modalities, previously published results regarding exercise assessment after AMI will need to be reconfirmed in patients currently selected for testing, since these results may no longer be applicable in this current era of aggressive medical and interventional management.", 
    "49": "The high-affinity binding of the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, [3H]dihydroalprenolol, was measured in homogenates of frontal cortex (Brodmann's areas 8 and 9) of suicide victims and matched controls. Suicides were classified as violent if gunshot, hanging, or jumping was the cause of death and as nonviolent if carbon monoxide poisoning or drug overdose was the cause of death. No significant difference were found between controls and nonviolent or violent suicide victims with regard to the number of beta-adrenergic receptors (Bmax), or the binding affinity (Kd) of the receptor. Beta-Adrenergic receptor binding was not significantly affected by sex, age, race, or postmortem interval. Serotonin-2 receptor binding (Bmax) in homogenates from the same tissue specimens was previously reported to be significantly increased in violent suicides (Arora and Meltzer 1989). In these sample groups, suicide by violent means appears to be associated with an increase in the number of serotonin-2, but not beta-adrenergic, receptors in frontal cortex.", 
    "50": "The role of central nervous system (CNS) cholinergic and noradrenergic mechanisms in the pathogenesis of depression and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hyperactivity is examined using the Behavioral Despair rat model of depression. Immobility (IM), the analog of depression in this model, and plasma corticosterone (C) were increased by physostigmine (PHYSO). Neostigmine (NEO), which does not cross the blood-brain barrier, produced the same peripheral cholinomimetic effects and motor inhibition as PHYSO, but did not change IM. PHYSO's effects on C and IM were blocked by metoprolol pretreatment and partially blocked by clonidine pretreatment. PHYSO increased acetylcholine in the striatum. In this animal model of depression, cholinergic and noradrenergic mechanisms are interactively involved in the regulation of behavioral depression and the HPA axis.",

In conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats, carvedilol (0.03-3.0 mg/kg, iv) produced a dose-dependent reduction in blood pressure with no significant effect on heart rate. Because cardiac output was relatively unaffected, the antihypertensive response of carvedilol was associated with a dose-dependent reduction in total peripheral vascular resistance. Submaximal antihypertensive doses of carvedilol were chosen for mechanism of action studies in pithed rats. Carvedilol (0.3 mg/kg, iv) produced a significant inhibition of the beta 1 adrenoceptor mediated positive chronotropic response to isoproterenol. This same dose of carvedilol also inhibited, but to a lesser degree, the beta 2 adrenoceptor mediated vasodepressor response to salbutamol in pithed rats whose blood pressure was elevated by a constant intravenous infusion of angiotensin II. Thus, carvedilol blocks both beta 1 and beta 2 adrenoceptors at antihypertensive doses, with modest selectivity being observed for the beta 1 adrenoceptor subtype. Carvedilol produced significant inhibition of the alpha 1 adrenoceptor mediated pressor response to cirazoline in the pithed rat, but had no effect on the alpha 2 adrenoceptor mediated pressor response to B-HT 933, suggesting that carvedilol is also an alpha 1 adrenoceptor antagonist at antihypertensive doses. Carvedilol had no effect on the pressor response elicited by angiotensin II, indicating a lack of nonspecific vasodilator activity. The vasopressor response to the calcium channel activator, BAY-K-8644, which is mediated through the opening of voltage dependent calcium channels and the subsequent translocation of extracellular calcium, was significantly inhibited by carvedilol (1 mg/kg, iv), suggesting that carvedilol is also a calcium channel antagonist, consistent with our previous in vitro studies. In anesthetized spontaneously hypertensive rats, the antihypertensive activity of carvedilol was nearly abolished by combined pretreatment of the rats with high doses of the alpha 1 adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin (1 mg/kg, iv), and the nonselective beta adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol (3 mg/kg, iv), suggesting that the majority of the antihypertensive response produced by carvedilol may be accounted for by blockade of beta and alpha 1 adrenoceptors. We therefore conclude that carvedilol, at antihypertensive doses, is an antagonist of beta 1, beta 2, and alpha 1 adrenoceptors, and also of calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "59": "The evaluation and treatment of hypertension in the African-American patient with an elevated blood pressure presents a diagnostic challenge. We are less able to rely on young age and resistance to treatment as indications for more extensive evaluation of secondary causes of hypertension; thus, greater reliance on history, physical examination, and clinical judgment is required if we are to identify potentially treatable causes. The treatment of hypertension in the African-American patient also presents a therapeutic challenge. Thiazide diuretics remain the drugs of first choice for treating hypertension in the African-American hypertensive. The calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are attractive alternatives to thiazides in patients uncontrolled by or intolerant of thiazides or who have specific indications for these agents (eg, angina, severe diastolic dysfunction). Beta-blockers should not be denied to African-American hypertensives if indications for their use exist. Although beta-blockers may be less effective as monotherapy, 50% of African-American hypertensives can be so controlled. Resistance to beta-blockers may be eliminated by administering them with a diuretic. The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), like CCBs, are well tolerated, but also lack long-term primary prevention data. As is the case with beta-blockers, ACEIs are less effective in African-American hypertensives when used as monotherapy. ACEIs have particular value in therapy for African-American hypertensives with concomitant congestive heart failure and may protect against progression of diabetic nephropathy. Finally, all hypertensives, especially African-American hypertensives, should have access to treatment prior to the development of end organ damage. The cost of early intervention is minimal compared with the economic consequences of neglect.", 
    "60": "Carvedilol (Kredex) is a multiple action, antihypertensive agent that may also prove to be useful in the treatment of angina and congestive heart failure. Carvedilol combines in one molecule both beta-adrenoceptor blocking and vasodilating activities. Inasmuch as beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents are known to be cardioprotective and thereby reduce infarct size, it is logical to assume that carvedilol, likewise, would possess this desirable activity. Furthermore, the additional vasodilating activity of carvedilol could contribute to further reductions in infarct size by reducing myocardial work (and therefore myocardial oxygen demand) through reductions in both afterload and myocardial wall tension. As such, we have investigated the ability of carvedilol to reduce infarct size in a canine model of acute myocardial infarction. Carvedilol (1 mg/kg i.v.) or its vehicle, dimethylformamide, were administered 15 min before left circumflex coronary artery (LCX) occlusion. Following 1 h of LCX occlusion, dogs were reperfused through a critical stenosis and then allowed to recover for 24 h. Carvedilol-treated animals exhibited a 78% reduction in infarct size compared to vehicle controls, such that the percentage of the left ventricle infarcted was reduced significantly from 16.2 +/- 4.1% in control animals to 3.6 +/- 1.3% in animals treated with carvedilol (p = 0.017, n = 6). Stained tissue sections of the left ventricle were photographed, digitized and color-enhanced using an Image Analysis Computer System, and three-dimensional reconstruction of the left ventricle, including the infarcted areas, was performed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "61": "Over the past 30 years, knowledge of the natural history and effects of therapy in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy has expanded greatly, but progress has been hampered by its variable patterns of expression. Many but not all patients show symptomatic improvement with medical treatment. Chronic beta blockage does not appear to affect long-term survival, whereas results with calcium channel blockade by verapamil have been encouraging; however, they await confirmation, and verapamil may be hazardous in some patients with severe left ventricular (LV) outflow tract obstruction and elevated LV end-diastolic pressure. Reported beneficial effects of amiodarone on survival also require further study. Surgical therapy has become the treatment of choice for medically refractory patients with proven outflow tract obstruction. In several centers, the operative risk is low, and long-term follow-up demonstrates prolonged symptomatic relief. It is hoped that work currently underway will provide more definitive information on the long-term effects of the role of calcium channel blockers, antiarrhythmic medications, and the long-term effects of surgical therapy on survival of patients with this disorder.", 
    "62": "The effects of chronic lithium treatment on adenylate cyclase activity in intact rat brain were examined using in vivo microdialysis. Basal extracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) increased in a dose-dependent manner after norepinephrine was added to the perfusate. Chronic lithium treatment increased basal brain extracellular fluid cyclic AMP levels, while decreasing the magnitude of the cyclic AMP response to stimulation with 100 microM norepinephrine.", 
    "63": "The antihypertensive effects, as assessed by clinical and ambulatory blood pressure measurement, of nifedipine slow-release (SR), atenolol and the two in combination were evaluated in 28 known hypertensives in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised cross-over trial. Clinical blood pressure was significantly lower on combination therapy (P less than 0.025) than on either agent alone, although all therapeutic agents reduced blood pressure significantly when compared with placebo (P less than 0.01). All ambulatory blood pressure measurements obtained on any therapeutic agent were significantly lower than those obtained on placebo (P less than 0.01). The mean daytime (08h00-17h00) ambulatory blood pressure measurement as well as the percentage of this monitoring period during which patients were hypertensive were significantly lower (P less than 0.01) on combination therapy than on nifedipine SR. A similar pattern was observed for 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurements. Headache was the most significant adverse effect. This was most common with nifedipine SR, less common with combination therapy and least common with atenolol. Combination therapy with nifedipine SR and atenolol is therefore a viable therapeutic alternative in the treatment of patients with benign essential hypertension.", 
    "64": "The turkey beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR), the m1 and m2 forms of the human muscarinic cholingeric receptor (MAChR) and several other mutant and wild-type G protein-coupled receptors were produced in insect Sf9 cells by infection with recombinant baculoviruses. Maximal expression for most receptors was 5-30 pmol receptor/mg protein (2-15 nmol/liter culture). The receptors displayed typical ligand binding characteristics. The beta-AR was glycosylated; electrophoretic behavior of the two MAChRs also suggested glycosylation. The beta-AR stimulated endogenous adenylyl cyclase in response to beta-adrenergic agonists. The beta-AR and both MAChRs were purified and coreconstituted with various purified G proteins in phospholipid vesicles. The recombinant beta-AR catalyzed the agonist-dependent activation of Gs by guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) with the same efficiency as did the natural beta-AR. The m2 MAChR efficiently catalyzed GTP gamma S binding to Go and to the recently identified G protein Gz (Gx). The m2 MAChR also catalyzed the activation of Gj,1 and Gj,3 weakly. Activation of these same G proteins by the ml MAChR was much less efficient, consistent with its known selectivity for pertussis toxin-insensitive G proteins (\"Gp\") that have not yet been isolated. The beta-AR and m2 MAChR were characteristically stimulated by reduction of disulfides. These results demonstrate the general utility of the baculovirus system for production of large quantities of native G protein-coupled receptors.", 
    "65": "The binding of agonists and antagonists to the beta-adrenergic receptor (beta AR) is postulated to involve an ionic interaction between the amine group of the ligand and the carboxylate side chain of Asp113 in the third hydrophobic domain of the receptor. To explore the importance of this interaction in the binding of ligands to the beta AR, a Ser residue was substituted for Asp113, and the ability of this mutant receptor to respond to compounds which could potentially interact with the hydroxyl side chain of the Ser residue was assessed. The mutant receptor was fully activated by catechol-containing esters and ketones, compounds which did not activate the wild-type beta AR. The demonstration that the molecular substitution of a single amino acid residue can alter the ligand binding specificity of the beta AR provides evidence that the chemical nature of this residue is a critical determinant in the recognition site of the receptor. Further, the ability to modify the specificity of a receptor by the replacement of amino acids at the binding site demonstrates the potential for the rational design of drugs which function specifically at genetically engineered receptors.", 
    "66": "The implications of apolipoproteins A-I and A-II for the prognosis of 178 non-diabetic men after acute myocardial infarction were studied. During a mean follow-up period of 4 years, one or more \"coronary events\" (nonfatal myocardial infarction, fatal coronary heart disease, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, deterioration of exercise ECG) were recorded in 37 patients. Serum levels of apolipoproteins A-I and A-II did not discriminate between patients with and without coronary events. This applied to the entire sample as much as to subgroups defined by presence or absence of interventions (coronary artery bypass graft surgery, long-term therapy with beta-blockers or lipid-lowering drugs). We conclude that coronary events in the first years after myocardial infarction cannot be predicted by apolipoprotein A-I or A-II levels.", 
    "67": "The effect of the anxiogenic \u03b2-carboline, FG-7142, on defense and approach-attack behavior in the cat was investigated. FG-7142 (10 mg/kg) enhanced defensive responses to rats and mice when tested 10 and 20 min after injection. At the same time, FG-7142 suppressed approach and attack responses to prey. Behavioral effects of FG-7142 were blocked by the specific benzodiazepine receptor blocker RO-15-1788 (10 mg/kg). One or two administrations of FG-7142 were sufficient to produce a lasting (up to 105 days) enhancement of defensive response to rats but not to mice. Defensive response to conspecific threat vocalizations was also lastingly increased. Two injections of FG-7142 produced a lasting suppression of approach-attack on rats only, whereas one injection of FG-7142 did not. The lasting suppression of some measures of approach-attack was found to be independent of the fear-enhancing properties of FG-7142. Tests of the effects of RO-15-1788 on the lasting after-effects of FG-7142 revealed at least two mechanisms which mediate the lasting changes in behavior, one which is dependent upon the benzodiazepine receptor and one which is not. The implications of these findings for rodent models of anxiety which use response suppression to assess fearful 'anxiogenic' effects of drugs are discussed.", 
    "68": "This study was a multicenter, double-blind comparison of the antianginal efficacy and safety of amlodipine and placebo as adjunctive therapy with constant recommended maintenance doses of beta-blockers. Patients with stable exertional angina pectoris were randomized to placebo or amlodipine at a starting dose of 5 mg once daily. The amlodipine dose was adjusted to 10 mg daily after 2 weeks if angina attacks were not abolished. Antianginal efficacy was assessed throughout the study with angina diaries, investigators' and patients' global evaluations, and with bicycle exercise tests during a placebo run-in period (baseline) and after 2 and 6 weeks of double-blind treatment. On baseline-final analysis, the exercise time to angina onset increased by 13% with amlodipine compared to 6% with placebo (p < 0.05). The total exercise time increased by 11% on amlodipine compared with 2% on placebo, though this difference did not reach statistical significance. Angina attack frequency and nitroglycerin consumption were both reduced by adding amlodipine to beta-blocker treatment. Amlodipine in combination with beta-blocker therapy was well tolerated, with a low incidence of side effects and laboratory test abnormalities. The study showed clearly that addition of amlodipine to beta-blocker therapy in patients with stable angina pectoris was well tolerated and gave improved antianginal efficacy.", 
    "69": "Analysis of diary card data from 33,999 angina attacks recorded in 1,022 patients with chronic stable angina showed a clear circadian pattern to the frequency of angina that resembles patterns previously described for myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death, with a peak in the morning. The majority of angina attacks were preceded by physical exertion and the circadian pattern was more pronounced for exertional angina than nonexertional angina. In this study, treatment with beta-blockers did not prevent the morning peak of angina attacks.", 
    "70": "Intracellular recordings and current and single-electrode voltage-clamp techniques were used to study the membrane responses of CA1 pyramidal neurons to bath application of l-homocysteic acid (l-HC) in the rat hippocampal slice preparation. In control artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF), l-HC (25 - 250 microM) depolarized the membrane and induced a burst-like firing pattern. Both the membrane depolarization and the burst firing were blocked by the N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor antagonists d-(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (AP-5, 50 microM), d-(-)-2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid (AP-7, 50 microM) and (+/-)-3-(2-carboxy-piperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP, 20 microM). In ACSF containing tetrodotoxin (1 microM), l-HC (100 - 300 microM) induced at resting membrane potential a depolarization which was associated with a small increase in input conductance. These effects were unaffected by 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX, 10 - 20 microM) but were fully blocked by AP-5, AP-7 (50 microM) and CPP (10 - 20 microM). In voltage-clamp experiments, l-HC induced slow inward currents which were voltage-dependent between - 70 and - 30 mV and reversed polarity near 0 mV. The l-HC-induced inward current was unaffected by CNQX (10 - 20 microM) but was strongly reduced by AP-5 or AP-7 (50 microM). The l-HC-induced inward current was temperature-dependent. Between - 60 and - 70 mV, its amplitude increased by 320% when the temperature was lowered from 33 to 22 degrees C. The l-HC-induced current was also potentiated by the specific l-HC uptake blocker beta-p-chlorophenylglutamate (Chlorpheg, 0.5 - 2 mM). These data suggest that l-HC preferentially activates NMDA receptors in CA1 hippocampal neurons.", 
    "71": "This study was designed to assess the effects of cocaine on coronary arterial smooth muscle and to determine whether previously reported cocaine-induced coronary vasospasm is mediated by substances released from the endothelium or by increased adrenergic receptor stimulation. Concentration-response relationships for cocaine (0.1-300 microM) and norepinephrine (0.1-300 microM) were studied in vitro using 2 mm segments of bovine proximal left anterior descending coronary artery. Each segmental ring was mounted in a 70 ml tissue bath for the measurement of isometric tension. Cocaine (3-300 microM) caused significant, concentration-dependent, increases in developed tension (p less than 0.05). Removal of the endothelium or pretreatment with prazosin (0.1 microM) or propranolol (1 microM) did not significantly alter this action of cocaine. In contrast to cocaine, norepinephrine (10-300 microM) caused significant decreases in developed tension (p less than 0.01). These findings suggest that cocaine-induced contraction of bovine coronary vascular smooth muscle is not mediated by endothelium derived contracting substances or norepinephrine.", 
    "72": "The effects of sotalol, a beta-adrenoceptor blocker and class III antiarrhythmic agent, on transmembrane ionic currents were examined in single rabbit and guinea pig ventricular myocytes using whole-cell voltage-clamp techniques. In neither of these species did 60 microM sotalol appreciably effect the inward rectifier, the transient outward or the inward calcium currents. In addition, sotalol did not elicit a slowly inactivating component of the sodium current as did 1 microgram/ml veratrine. In guinea pig ventricular myocytes, sotalol also significantly depressed the outward delayed rectifier current. An outward delayed rectifier current was not observed in rabbit ventricular myocytes examined at room temperature; and, under these conditions sotalol did not lengthen action potential duration. Sotalol induced lengthening of cardiac action potential duration can, therefore, be explained by depression the outward delayed rectifier current.", 
    "73": "The short-term effect of 0.8 mg/kg of intravenous bolus of labetalol upon maternal and fetal hemodynamics was investigated in 10 healthy women at 38 weeks of gestation admitted to the hospital for elective cesarean section. The maximum effect occurred within 35 min after labetalol. At that point, the mean arterial pressure had decreased by 16%, and a slight decrease was observed in maternal heart rate. As to the flow velocity waveforms, no significant change was found in mean systolic/diastolic (S/D) ratio of uterine artery, umbilical artery or fetal middle cerebral artery. However, in 2 subjects with a large decrease in blood pressure also the uterine artery S/D ratio decreased.", 
    "74": "A review of current knowledge of essential tremor and its treatment is presented. Its prevalence in Africa is not known but it is quite common in those over 40 years in most communities of the world. The condition is characterised by slowly progressive postural tremor of the arms and head without an identifiable organic cause. It is often misdiagnosed as Parkinson's disease. Current treatment is with beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, but this treatment is not completely satisfactory. Further studies are required on its pathophysiological mechanisms and new therapeutic directions.", 
    "75": "Intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) is thought to act as a second messenger of transmembrane signalling systems. However, no measurement of [Ca2+]i has been made in intact epidermal keratinocytes. We have developed a method for measuring [Ca2+]i in human keratinocytes from pure epidermal sheet by the application of digital imaging fluorescence microscopy with the use of Fura 2-AM. Normal human pure epidermal sheets were obtained by dispase treatment. Epinephrine and salbutamol induced transient [Ca2+]i increases. Propranolol, a beta-antagonist, inhibited this response, while prazosin and yohimbine (alpha 1- and alpha 2-antagonists, respectively) did not affect the response. Histamine and adenosine, also receptor agonists of the epidermal adenylate cyclase system, induced a similar [Ca2+]i increase, as did forskolin, a direct activator of adenylate cyclase. These data coincide with those previously presented for cultured human epidermal keratinocytes, and reveal that adenylate cyclase activation induces an increase of [Ca2+]i in intact epidermal cells. This technique enables the kinetics of [Ca2+]i in various skin disorders to be investigated.", 
    "76": "Transitory hearing impairment has been well documented in humans during basilar migraine attacks. Ischemia induced by activation of central nervous system adrenoreceptors by cAMP is one of the mechanisms that has been implicated, as well as calcium metabolism alterations. Propranolol-HCl has proven to be an effective treatment. Massive local adrenaline release is regarded as the primum movens mechanism triggering the liberation of other beta-receptor activators resulting in sterile edema and exudate. This exudate can be visualized (via ophthalmoscope) and is viewed as pathognomonic of a migraine attack. We investigated both the action of adrenaline and Propranolol-HCl on brainstem auditory potentials in 3 groups of young rats. The first group was perfused intra-arterially with adrenaline. The second group received the same treatment plus a prophylactic daily dose of Propranolol-HCl. The third group served as the control and received Propranolol-HCl, but was perfused with a Ringer solution. Alterations in blood flow and hearing sensitivity (BERA) following perfusion occurred in the first group only. Propranolol seems to exhibit a protective action during experimental attempts to induce migraine-like attacks in rats.", 
    "77": "Quality of life has been assessed in a double-blind four week study comparing felodipine 5, 10, 20 mg and placebo added to metoprolol by adding two self-administered questionnaires to the conventional procedure for the evaluation of adverse events. None of the aspects related to general well-being was affected by felodipine. The subjective symptoms reported were mostly dose-related and so here mainly observed at the highest dose. Some of them, e.g. headache, were transient. It is concluded that felodipine in combination with metoprolol CR did not negatively influence the feeling of well-being of the patients. When the drug was given in low, individually adjusted doses, the symptoms normally associated with Ca antagonists were likely to be minimised.", 
    "78": "Thirty patients with newly diagnosed chronic open angle glaucoma were initially treated with once daily oral Nadolol at a dose of 20 mg. This was increased to 40 mg where control was considered inadequate. Topical therapy was then added as necessary if control was still not maintained. Significant decreases in intra-ocular pressure (IOP) were achieved with a dose of 20 mg, but there was no significant further reduction when the dose was increased to 40 mg. One patient was controlled throughout the study period with 40 mg Nadolol daily and 4% Pilocarpine four times daily. At best, only temporary control was achieved in the remaining 29 patients. Intra-ocular pressures were measured 24 hours after the previous dose of Nadolol in 13 patients who were controlled for a minimum of 1 month on Nadolol alone and then again 3 hours after their normal dose. Control of IOP was lost in all patients at 24 hours pre-dose but was regained by 3 hours post-dose. Four patients were withdrawn because of mild side effects attributable to the beta-blocking action of Nadolol. The treatment regime used in this study was ineffective at controlling the IOP in the group of patients studied. A once daily regime of Nadolol does not control IOP over a full 24 hours.", 
    "79": "The effect of a single dose of 200 mg dilevalol, beta-adrenoceptor blocker with additional vasodilating properties, and 200 mg oxprenolol on haemodynamic changes induced by emotional stress have been compared in 12 male young Caucasian patients with newly diagnosed labile hypertension. No difference was noted in the stress-induced increase of total peripheral resistance (TPR) following administration of the two substances (11% versus 6%). However, dilevalol revealed a vasodilating action by decreasing TPR at rest (from 1004 to 951 dyn.s.cm-5) and diastolic blood pressure (BP) (from 87 to 75 mm Hg) whereas TPR at rest remained unchanged after the intake of oxprenolol.", 
    "80": "In a randomised double-blind crossover study, seven healthy males were concomitantly given metoprolol 100 mg o.d. as a controlled release formulation, and omeprazole 40 mg o.d. or placebo, for 8 days. Plasma levels of the R- and S-enantiomers of metoprolol were determined on the 8th day of each treatment. The subjects were also characterised by their metabolic capacity to hydroxylate debrisoquine. Concomitant omeprazole treatment had no significant influence on the steady-state plasma levels of the two enantiomers of metoprolol. All subjects were characterised by extensive debrisoquine hydroxylation, i.e. extensive metoprolol metabolism. As metoprolol is metabolised to a great extent by debrisoquine hydroxylase (IID6), it is concluded that concomitant omeprazole treatment will probably have a negligible influence on the metabolism of the relatively large number of drugs mainly metabolised by this isoenzyme of the cytochrome P450 family.", 
    "81": "The interference by nicardipine and verapamil with the response to vasoactive stimuli, such as lower body negative pressure and angiotensin II, has been evaluated in the forearm of hypertensive patients. Forearm blood flow was monitored during the intraarterial infusion of either drug at rates equieffective on basal flow. Nicardipine blunted the peak forearm vasoconstrictor action of lower body negative pressure and a comparable result was obtained when angiotensin II was administered intraarterially. In spite of a comparable increase in forearm flow, nicardipine was more potent than verapamil in inhibiting vasoconstriction following both stimuli. Thus, nicardipine suppressed regional vascular reactivity, probably by blockade of the influx of extracellular calcium, in response to receptor activation, since both alpha-adrenergic and angiotensin II receptor-mediated vasoconstrictor responses were attenuated. However, the results of the comparison with an unrelated calcium entry blocker, such as verapamil, may suggest that nicardipine, and possibly other dihydropiridine derivatives, preferentially antagonize agonist-mediated vasoconstriction in the human forearm.", 
    "82": "The effects of morphine on memory have been shown to be dependent on the strain of animal used and on the experimental parameters. Memory was assessed in a passive avoidance task using Swiss albino (ICRC) mice. Morphine at doses of 1, 3 and 10 mg kg-1 was administered immediately after foot shock (memory retention) or 23.5 h after foot shock (memory retrieval). Retest step-down latencies measured 24 h later showed that morphine did not affect memory retention but dose-dependently impaired retrieval of memory. Administration of naloxone 0.1 mg kg-1 antagonised the effects of morphine and impaired memory retention. Propranolol 0.3 mg kg-1 along with morphine 3 mg kg-1 impaired memory retention only while haloperidol 0.1 mg kg-1 improved the impairment of memory retrieval caused by morphine 3 mg kg-1. Glucose did not alter the effects of morphine on memory. There was no per se effect of morphine, naloxone, propranolol, glucose and haloperidol on memory at the doses used. The effect of morphine on memory retention is mediated by opioid mechanisms; however, adrenergic and dopaminergic mechanisms possibly modulate retention and retrieval of memory, respectively.", 
    "83": "To assess the ability of biofeedback (BFB) in controlling hypertension a study was made of 40 hypertensive patients selected by means of the cardiovascular response to an arithmetic test. The patients were divided into four treatment groups: 10 patients were treated with diuretic therapy (D-T), 10 with beta-blocker therapy (Bb-T), 10 with BFB treatment, while 10 had no treatment at all (N-T). The BFB treatment consisted of 36 sittings where patients were requested to control muscular contraction, peripheric temperature and heart rate (HR) by means of a correlated acoustic signal. The results for blood pressure and HR reductions were compared during a 12-month follow-up period. The results for systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and HR indicate the efficacy of BFB for selected patients and suggest the possibility of using BFB treatment in the first stages of suspected neurogenic hypertension.", 
    "84": "The article deals with the action of reserpine and propranolol on the intellectual working capacity and psychic state in hypertensive disease patients working under the extreme neuroemotional stress conditions. It was established that treatment with propranolol improved specific indices in the psychic state and professionally related functions of memory and attention thus contributing to intellectual working capacity. Treatment with reserpine hampered mental activity, including the functions of memory and attention.", 
    "85": "Heart rate responses, elicited reflexly by elevating blood pressure with phenylephrine or lowering it with sodium nitroprusside, were compared in groups of rats aged 4 and 14 months. All tests were done while the rats were awake to avoid artefacts due to anesthesia. Parasympathetic and sympathetic contributions were assessed by repeating baroreflex tests after cholinergic blockade with atropine or beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol. Magnitude of reflex bradycardia and tachycardia was initially smaller in the 14-month-old rats than in the younger rats thereby indicating that baroreflex sensitivity had diminished with age. After beta-adrenergic or cholinergic blockade, adjusted means (obtained by covariance analysis) for reflex tachycardia did not differ significantly between rat groups, but those for reflex bradycardia were significantly smaller in the 14-month-old rats than in the younger rats. Selective attenuation of reflex bradycardia after either cholinergic or beta-adrenergic blockade indicates that concurrent parasympathetic activation and sympathetic withdrawal during reflex bradycardia were also reduced in 14-month-old rats. These results suggest that as autonomic mediation of reflex bradycardia diminishes with age, old rats may no longer be able to slow the heart as easily whenever blood pressure rises, but they can still accelerate it whenever blood pressure falls.", 
    "86": "The effects of obsidan on lactate and glucose levels, the indices of ABB and electrolyte metabolism in blood and lymph at various times after development of the acute myocardial infarction were studied experimentally on dogs. It was stated that the earliest and most expressed changes of biochemical values were observed in the lymphatic system, thus pointing to its important role in the resorption and transport of the metabolic products from ischaemic myocardium. The use of obsidan during the development of acute myocardial infarction corrects substantially the disturbed metabolic processes in the blood and lymph.", 
    "87": "Urinary output of endogenous monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitory activity, was significantly raised in serial samples collected across a migraine attack compared with collections during attack-free periods and in healthy controls, which did not differ from each other. There was a highly significant correlation in output between isatin, a major fraction of the MAO inhibitory activity, and output of the MAO inhibitory activity itself. However, although there was a tendency towards increased isatin excretion during migraine attacks, it failed to reach statistical significance.", 
    "88": "1. Norepinephrine (NE) and clonidine produce a phasic, dose-dependent contraction of the isolated guinea-pig terminal ileum. 2. The effect of NE was blocked by prazosin which produced a parallel rightward shift of the concentration-effect curve to NE, with a significant depression of maximum effects. 3. Yohimbine and indomethacin noncompetitively blocked, whereas practolol potentiated, the contractile effect of NE. 4. The contractile effect of clonidine was not antagonized by indomethacin or atropine. 5. These results suggest that the isolated guinea-pig terminal ileum has excitatory receptors sensitive to clonidine stimulation and excitatory alpha receptors sensitive to blockade by prazosin, and that the activation of the latter may be related to the activation of endogenous prostaglandin synthesis."
