Previous studies show that 1 mg/kg of this plasticizer can leach into the blood during one dialysis session. It is rapidly metabolized in the liver. Mono(2-ehtylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), its main metabolite can be detected as well. After oral administration to rodents, both compounds caused a variety of adverse biological effects such as testicular atrophy, peroxisome proliferation and hepatic peroxisomal enzyme induction. Male wistar rats were treated intraperitoneally by DEHP and MEHP using twice the dose of that involved in human exposure during a dialysis session. Propranolol metabolism by hepatocytes was investigated after fresh isolation from treated and untreated rats by means of reverse phase HPLC. The choice of propranolol as a substrate was made because of its rather quick liver metabolisation. Phenobarbital was chosen in the study as a reference of enzymatic inducer to evaluate the inducing effect of DEHP and MEHP. Propranolol was metabolized by the hepatocytes of both treated and untreated rats. Hepatocytes isolated from rats treated by phenobarbital, MEHP and DEHP were shown to have a higher speed constant of metabolism indicating a rapid metabolism of propranolol. Under these conditions, in fact, propranolol metabolisation was found to be respectively 6, 2.7, 2 times faster than the propranolol metabolisation of untreated rats. The hypothesis that DEHP and MEHP are enzymatic inducers, particularly cytochrome P450 (CYP) inducers of the xenobiotics metabolism on the intact liver after IP administration has become been found to be valid. The results obtained in this study confirm the value of isolated hepatocytes as an in vivo drug metabolism predictive model.",

It has a long duration of action and a high degree of vascular selectivity. In addition to calcium channel-modulated vasodilation, lacidipine displays antioxidant activity greater than that of other dihydropyridine calcium antagonists. In randomised, well-controlled trials, lacidipine 2-6 mg orally once daily had antihypertensive efficacy similar to that of other long-acting dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, thiazide diuretics, atenolol (a beta-blocker) and enalapril (an ACE inhibitor). Lacidipine was effective in elderly patients (including those with isolated systolic hypertension), African Nigerian patients and patients with concurrent type 2 diabetes mellitus. During long-term treatment for 4 or 5 years in patients with isolated systolic hypertension or essential hypertension, the incidence of cardiovascular events and mortality with lacidipine was similar to that with chlorthalidone or atenolol. The European Lacidipine Study on Atherosclerosis (ELSA), in which 2334 patients with hypertension were randomised to 4 years of therapy with lacidipine 4-6 mg/day or the beta-blocker atenolol 50-100 mg/day, demonstrated significantly lower atherosclerotic progression and plaque formation with lacidipine compared with atenolol in patients completing the full 4 years of the study. Between-group differences in favour of lacidipine for the primary efficacy variable (mean change in carotid artery intima-media thickness) did not reach statistical significance in the intent-to-treat population. The tolerability profile of lacidipine (headache, flushing, pedal oedema, dizziness and palpitations) is similar to that of other dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, but with a lower incidence of peripheral oedema. Data from the ELSA study suggest that the incidence of serious adverse events during long-term lacidipine therapy is similar to that with atenolol.",

In 2 dialysis sessions after admission, when a BS polysulfone membrane was used, she experienced anaphylactoid shock with severe hypotension leading to syncope, dyspnea and vomiting, just after the start of hemodialysis. After the anaphylactoid shock, her dialyzer membrane was changed to a cellulose triacetate membrane and she did not suffer from such attacks.

    "28": "Glaucoma is a pathological condition whose most important risk factor is increased intraocular pressure (IOP). The medical treatment of glaucoma essentially consists of compounds that are able to decrease the IOP. The compounds discussed in this review act in a different way, beta-blockers mainly inhibit the production of aqueous humor, whereas latanoprost decreases the resistance in the outflow channels. beta-Blockers are compounds with a well-known efficacy and safety profile and they are fairly inexpensive. Their systemic and local side effects are mainly cardiovascular and pulmonary adverse events, dry eye and keratopathy. Latanoprost, which has recently been introduced into the market, has been shown to be equally as effective, or better in lowering IOP in patients than timolol, although it is more expensive. Systemic reported side effects are anecdotal; local hyperaemia, keratopathy, hypertrichosis, increased pigmentation of eyelashes and iris, uveitis and cystoid macular oedema have been reported. A comparison of costs reveals that a 1-year therapy with timolol ophthalmic solution starts from 11.00 Euros and can reach 146.00 Euros for the most expensive preservative-free 1-day dispenser packages (approximately 13.5 times higher). For latanoprost once-daily administration, the cost for 1 years therapy is 98.55 Euros, approximately six times higher than generic or brand 0.5% timolol applied twice-daily. What are the factors influencing a change in therapy from beta-blockers to latanoprost? The only good reason is represented by a further deterioration in the visual field. This may occur, despite a significant reduction in IOP, because the reached IOP is not sufficient enough to avoid further deterioration because the patient's work or social activities do not allow a correct daily dosage of the compound (bad compliance); or as a result of treatment suspension, because of the development of systemic and/or local side effects. Changes in therapy must always be related to a failing control of the disease, as any therapeutic modification leading to an increase in the number of visits and additional examinations, consequently enhances the costs.",

The rhodopsin-based homology models were assessed for agreement with experimental results for beta-adrenergic receptors, and compared with receptor models developed using de novo modeling techniques. While the de novo and homology-derived receptor models are generally quite similar, there are some localized structural differences that impact the putative ligand-binding site significantly. The de novo receptor models appear to provide much better agreement with experimental data, particularly for receptor complexes with agonist ligands. The de novo receptor models also yield some interesting and testable hypotheses for the structural basis of beta-adrenergic receptor subtype ligand selectivity.",

Inhibitor studies revealed a striking difference between the rolC- and rolB-gene-transformed cultures in their sensitivity to verapamil, an L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker. The rolC culture possessed a 2-fold lowered resistance to the inhibitor than the normal culture, while the rolB culture was 4-fold more resistant to the treatment. Additionally, growth of the rolC culture was totally inhibited when the culture was grown in Ca(2+)-free medium, whereas growth of the rolB culture was reduced by less than half. We interpreted these results as evidence for a lack of calcium homeostasis in both transgenic cultures. Anthraquinone (AQ) production was not inhibited in the normal or transformed cultures by the Ca(2+) channel blockers verapamil and LaCl(3), or by diphenylene iodonium, an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, or by the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine. These results indicate that the induction of AQ production in non-transgenic and transgenic cultures does not proceed through the activation of the common Ca(2+)-dependent NADPH oxidase pathway that mediates signal transduction between an elicitor-receptor complex via transcriptional activation of defense genes. Okadaic acid and cantharidin, inhibitors of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A, caused an increase in AQ production in transgenic cultures. Okadaic acid stimulated AQ accumulation in the non-transformed culture, whereas cantharidin had no effect. These results show that different phosphatases are involved in AQ synthesis in normal and transgenic cultures of R. cordifolia.",

Papilar diameter in both eyes were identical (7-7.5 mm) during the whole experiment. We suggest that the interaction of L-arginine.HCl with Timoptol causes formation of the new metabolite which is, in fact already effective component; this new substance decreases production of aqueous humor of corpus ciliare and the IOP is decreased in this way in physiological conditions. Utilization of this knowledge in clinical conditions could contribute to better utilization and more harmless use of antiglaucomatics in glaucoma disease therapy.

Pituitary glands were obtained from mature gilts, which were ovariectomised (OVX) one month before slaughter. Ovariectomised gilts, assigned to four groups, were primed with: (1) vehicle (OVX); (2) and (3) oestradiol benzoate (EB; 2.5 mg/100 kg b.w.) at 30-36 h (OVX+EB I) and 60-66 h (OVX+EB II) before slaughter, respectively; and (4) progesterone (P4; 120 mg/100 kg b.w.) for 5 consecutive days before slaughter (OVX+P4). Isolated anterior pituitary cells were submitted to 3.5 h incubation in the presence of GnRH, alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonists [phenylephrine (PHEN) and isoproterenol (ISOP), respectively], or alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockers [phentolamine (PHENT) and propranolol (PROP), respectively]. The culture media were assayed for PRL (exp. I) and beta-endorphin-like immunoreactivity (beta-END-LI) (experiment II). In experiment I, GnRH did not influence PRL release by pituitary cells in all experimental groups. Some of tested doses of adrenergic agonists, PHEN and ISOP, increased PRL release from pituitary cells of OVX gilts, but not from those of OVX+EB I animals. In the OVX+EB II group, PHEN alone, but ISOP with PROP, potentiated PRL secretion by the cells. In OVX+P4 animals, PHEN alone or in combination with PHENT and also ISOP alone or with PROP enhanced PRL output from the cells. In experiment II, addition of GnRH increased beta-END-LI release from pituitary cells only in the OVX+EB II group. PHEN and PHENT potentiated beta-END-LI secretion by pituitary cells in OVX+EB II and OVX+P4 groups, while ISOP and PROP increased beta-END-LI secretion by the cells of OVX and OVX+EB II animals. In turn, in the OVX+EB I group, effect of PHENT and PROP on PRL secretion by pituitary cells was inhibitory. In conclusion, our results suggest that adrenergic agents can modulate PRL and beta-END secretion by porcine pituitary cells in a manner dependent on the hormonal status of gilts.",

The included studies for both overdoses were not blinded, had limited numbers of animals, and some had inadequate glucagon regime.",

    "58": "The aging of the population of the United States (US) will bring with it higher numbers of patients with coronary heart disease and heart failure (HF). Because HF already imposes severe economic and medical burdens on our health care system, it is imperative to optimize primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular (CV) disease. In most cases, HF develops as a result of either long-standing hypertension or a myocardial infarction (MI). Other than cardiac death, HF represents the last stage in the progression of CV disease, which begins with CV risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, and smoking. These risk factors lead to the development of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy or an MI (or both), which lead to LV dysfunction and, finally, to HF. The prognosis of HF is poor, the 5-year survival rate being approximately 25%. Heart failure may be due to either LV systolic or diastolic dysfunction, the latter having a normal ejection fraction. Because CV disease is progressive, interventions are possible at all stages along the CV continuum. Beta-blockers (betaB) are recommended agents at several stages of CV disease. Large-scale trials have shown that betaB significantly reduce risks for morbidity and mortality in patients with HF. Ongoing studies should help to clarify further the optimal cardioprotective therapies in patients with HF.", 
    "59": "Diabetes is the number one cause of end-stage renal disease in the United States. Most patients with diabetic renal disease also have hypertension and additional cardiovascular (CV) risk factors. The leading cause of death among these patients is CV events. Treatment of hypertension in patients with diabetes is therefore of particular relevance. The goals of antihypertensive therapy are to lower blood pressure (BP), to slow the progression of kidney disease, and to reduce the risk of CV events. The recommended target BP in patients with chronic kidney disease, with or without diabetes, is <130/80 mm Hg. The majority of these patients will require more than one antihypertensive agent to control their BP; most will need more than two drugs. Data from numerous randomized clinical trials show that patients with diabetic kidney disease should receive an agent that blocks the renin-angiotensin system in combination with a diuretic, beta-blocker (betaB), or calcium channel blocker. Beta-blockers have an important dual role to play in the management of patients with diabetic kidney disease: to help achieve target BP, and to provide optimal cardioprotection in these patients who are at high risk for cardiac events.",

The prolonged infusion of 1,3-dipropyl-8-sulfophenylxanthine (DPSPX), a non-selective antagonist of adenosine receptors, induces hypertension, an increase in plasma renin activity and morphological cardiovascular changes. 2. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of losartan, a selective AT1 receptor antagonist, and atenolol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, on DPSPX-induced hypertension. 3. Male Wistar rats (250-300 g, n = 4-6) were treated for 1 or 4 weeks with: saline i.p.; DPSPX (90 microg kg(-1) h(-1)) i.p.; losartan (15 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) p.o.; atenolol (25 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) p.o.; DPSPX (90 microg kg(-1) h(-1)) i.p. + losartan (15 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) p.o.; DPSPX (90 microg kg(-1) h(-1)) i.p. + atenolol (25 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) p.o. Blood pressure was measured by the 'tail-cuff' method in conscious animals. Fragments of the mesenteric and tail arteries were processed for morphological study and the mean diameter of the vascular smooth muscle cells was determined. 4. DPSPX increased blood pressure. Losartan and atenolol prevented this rise but had no effect on blood pressure of control rats. DPSPX-treated groups showed hypertrophy of the vascular smooth muscle cells and proliferation of subintimal cells. Losartan but not atenolol prevented these changes. Losartan had no effect on the vascular morphology of control rats, while treatment with atenolol for 4 weeks induced hypertrophy of the vascular smooth muscle cells. 5. Both losartan and atenolol counteract the development of DPSPX-induced hypertension but only losartan prevents the alterations in vascular morphology.",

The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) changed significantly during the first and third month after implantation and then improved during the sixth month. Concomitantly, the maximum and the average urinary flow rate deteriorated significantly. The variations in postvoid residual were less significant. An initial IPSS of > 8 and previous alpha-blocker treatment were identified as significant predictive factors of urinary morbidity, as were the TPBT dose received by 90% of the target volume and by 30% of the urethra, and the volume of prostate receiving 144 Gy.",

Haemodynamics were assessed using fluorescein angiography by means of a scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO). Visual function and visual field indices were evaluated during all drug treatment phases.",

At baseline examination, blood pressure, heart rate, intraocular pressure (IOP), SLO angiograms, and contrast sensitivity (CS) were analysed. Patients then randomly received timolol, dorzolamide or latanoprost treatment for 4 weeks. Patients then returned and all procedures were repeated and assessed. Arteriovenous passage times (AVPs), peripapillary arterial and venous diameters were assessed from SLO angiograms, using digital image processing. Calculated ocular perfusion pressure was determined for each treatment phase.",

Arteriovenous passage times were significantly shortened after dorzolamide application compared to baseline (p = 0.009), whereas neither timolol nor latanoprost treatment resulted in significant AVP changes. Peripapillary arterial and venous diameters, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate and ocular perfusion pressures were not significantly altered during any treatment phase. Contrast sensitivity testing at 6 cycles/degree (c.p.d.) revealed a significant rise after dorzolamide compared to timolol (p = 0.007).",

    "76": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an inherited cardiac disease characterized by unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy, typically involving the interventricular septum. Hypertrophy may be present in infants, but commonly develops during childhood and adolescence. Management of children with HCM aims to provide symptomatic relief and prevention of sudden death, which is the primary cause of death. Unfortunately, no randomized comparative trials to date have assessed different treatment options in HCM. Medical treatment with negative inotropic agents (beta-adrenoceptor antagonists [beta-blockers], verapamil) is the first therapeutic choice in all symptomatic patients. Beta-blockers also appear to have prognostic merit in children. Surgical myectomy is effective in reducing symptoms in children with left ventricular (LV) obstruction who are unresponsive to medical treatment, although a repeat operation may be needed in a substantial proportion of patients due to relapse of LV obstruction. The recently introduced percutaneous septal ablation can also be regarded as a feasible alternative in this cohort. Technical limitations of both invasive therapeutic options should be carefully considered, preferably in experienced centers. Results of recent randomized trials indicate that dual chamber pacing, once considered a therapeutic option for patients with HCM, should only be used as treatment for conduction abnormalities. Regular clinical risk stratification for sudden death is of vital importance for the prevention of sudden death in young patients. Familial history of sudden death at a young age, LV hypertrophy >3 cm, unexplained syncope, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in Holter monitoring, and abnormal blood pressure response during exercise are currently considered clinical risk factors for sudden death. Each factor has a low positive predictive accuracy, but patients having two or more of these risk factors are deemed as high risk. Secondary prevention of sudden death in patients successfully resuscitated from cardiac arrest and/or sustained ventricular tachycardia warrants treatment with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). Primary prevention of sudden death in patients considered to be at high risk should aim at the management of obvious arrhythmogenic mechanisms (paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, conduction system disease, accessory pathway, myocardial ischemia), and the prevention and/or management of ventricular tachyarrhythmias with amiodarone and/or ICD implantation, respectively. The choice of treatment in children is greatly influenced by technical aspects, such as adverse effects of amiodarone, and ICD implantation difficulties or complications. Amiodarone could also be used as a bridge in children at high risk, until they reach adulthood, possibly achieving a lower risk status, or until their physical growth permits ICD implantation as long-term therapy.", 
    "77": "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are a frequently prescribed group of highly effective drugs of which the most well-known side effect is gastrointestinal peptic ulcer. However, NSAIDs have additional renal, cardiovascular, hematological, dermatological, and neurological side effects. Although the spectrum of side effects is slightly different between the conventional NSAIDs and the recently developed cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitors, their overall spectrum is quite similar. Aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge about NSAIDs and their effects on patients with cardio- or cerebrovascular disorders. NSAIDs interact with many drugs which are used in patients with cardio- or cerebrovascular disorders: They attenuate the effects of diuretics, betablockers, ACE inhibitors and AT-2 blockers, thus leading to uncontrolled hypertension or aggravation of heart failure. They increase digoxin levels, potentiate the effect of oral anticoagulants and interact with platelet inhibitors, thus leading to a higher bleeding risk. There are indications that NSAIDs may induce hypertension in normotensives and that COX-2 inhibitors may lead to an increased rate of myocardial infarction and strokes. Based on these data it is recommended that NSAIDs should be avoided in patients with cardio- or cerebrovascular disorders and alternative pharmaceutical, physical or surgical therapy should be applied. If NSAIDs are inevitable, their side effects should be well monitored; they should be prescribed with caution when given in combination with diuretics, betablockers, ACE inhibitors, AT-2 blockers, digitalis, oral anticoagulants and platelet inhibitors. COX- 2 inhibitors should be avoided in patients with known coronary or cerebrovascular disorders. In patients with uncontrolled hypertension or worsening of heart failure, unreported NSAID-use should be considered. Generally, there is a need to develop further analgetic drugs without the described side effects for patients with cardio- and cerebrovascular disorders.", 
    "78": "Beta-blocker therapy has been shown to be associated with an increase in the plasma concentration of A-type natriuretic peptide (ANP). Whether the plasma concentration of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), which is mainly derived from ventricular tissue, is also increased and whether this increase is caused by increased production or decreased metabolism by down-regulation of the natriuretic peptide-clearance receptor remains to be established. In a double-blind crossover study effects of 8 weeks' treatment of bisoprolol,10 mg once daily, and losartan, 50 mg once daily, on plasma concentrations of ANP, BNP, and N-terminal (Nt)-ANP and ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) were measured in 24 hypertensive patients. With bisoprolol plasma concentrations of ANP and BNP increased (P < 0.001) by 93 +/- 88% (mean +/- SD) and 148 +/- 117%, whereas these parameters did not change with losartan. Nt-ANP, which is not metabolized by the NP clearance receptor, increased by 83 +/- 45%, and increments in ANP and Nt-ANP were related (r =0.77, P < 0.001). The decrease in ABP was greater with bisoprolol than with losartan. Monotherapy with bisoprolol, but not with losartan, is associated with substantial increments in plasma concentrations of ANP, Nt-ANP, and BNP. As the magnitude of the increase in ANP and Nt-ANP was comparable, the beta-blocker-induced increase in NPs is not likely to be explained by a decrease in NP clearance receptor density.", 
    "79": "Atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, AV-nodal reentry tachycardia with rapid ventricular response, atrial ectopic tachycardia, and preexcitation syndromes combined with atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachyarrhythmias are typical arrhythmias in intensive care patients. Most frequently, the diagnosis of the underlying arrhythmia is possible from the physical examination, the response to maneuvers or drugs, and the 12-lead surface electrocardiogram. In all patients with unstable hemodynamics, immediate DC-cardioversion is indicated. Conversion of atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm is possible using antiarrhythmic drugs. Amiodarone has a conversion rate in atrial fibrillation of up to 80%. However, caution in the use of short-term administration of intravenous amiodarone in critically ill patients with recent-onset atrial fibrillation is absolutely necessary, and the duration of therapy should not exceed 24 to 48 hours. Ibutilide represents a relatively new class III antiarrhythmic agent that has been reported to have conversion rates of 50% to 70%; it seems that ibutilide is even successful when intravenous amiodarone failed to convert atrial fibrillation.", 
    "80": "Newer studies compared the outcome of patients with atrial fibrillation and rhythm- or rate-control. Data from these studies (AFFIRM, RACE) clearly showed that rhythm control is not superior to rate control for the prevention of death and morbidity from cardiovascular causes. Therefore, rate-control may be an appropriate therapy in patients with recurrent atrial fibrillation after DC-cardioversion. Acute therapy of atrial flutter in intensive care patients depends on the clinical presentation. Atrial flutter can most often be successfully cardioverted to sinus rhythm with energies less than 50 joules. Ibutilide trials showed efficacy rates of 38-76% for conversion of atrial flutter to sinus rhythm compared with conversion rates of 5-13% when intravenous flecainide, propafenone, or verapamil was administered. In addition, a high dose (2 mg) of ibutilide was more effective than sotalol (1.5 mg/kg) in conversion of atrial flutter to sinus rhythm (70% versus 19%).", 
    "81": "There is general agreement that bystander first aid, defibrillation, and advanced life support is essential for neurologic outcome in patients after cardiac arrest due to ventricular tachyarrhythmias. The best survival rate from cardiac arrest can be achieved only when (1) recognition of early warning signs, (2) activation of the emergency medical services system, (3) basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation, (4) defibrillation, (5) management of the airway and ventilation, and (6) intravenous administration of medications occurs as rapidly as possible. Public access defibrillation, which places automatic external defibrillators in the hands of trained laypersons, seems to be an ideal approach in the treatment of ventricular fibrillation. The use of automatic external defibrillators by basic life support ambulance providers or first responder in early defibrillation programs has been associated with a significant increase in survival rates. Drugs such as lidocaine, procainamide, sotalol, amiodarone, or magnesium were recommended for treatment of ventricular tachyarrhythmias in intensive care patients. Amiodarone is a highly efficacious antiarrhythmic agent for many cardiac arrhythmias, ranging from atrial fibrillation to malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and seems to be superior to other antiarrhythmic agents.",

The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the impact of carvedilol on cardiac adrenergic neuronal function using 123I-MIBG scintigraphy and on left ventricular function using equilibrium radionuclide angiography in children with DCM. Seventeen patients (11 female, six male; mean age 39 +/- 57 months, range 1-168 months) with DCM and left ventricular dysfunction underwent 123I-MIBG cardiac scintigraphy and equilibrium radionuclide angiography before and after a 6-month period of carvedilol therapy.

Propranolol was considered effective when the result of the second (on drug) TT was negative or the time to syncope occurrence was longer than during baseline TT. During the whole procedure systolic BP (SBP), mean BP (MBP), diastolic BP (DBP) and HR were measured. These parameters were analysed in four different time-intervals: period I - between 13th and 15th minute of supine rest preceding the passive phase of TT, period II - between first and third minute of the passive TT, period III - following propranolol injection, between 13th and 15th minute of supine rest preceding second TT, and period IV - between first and third minute of second TT, either passive (if positive) or after NTG administration. Both, mean values and differences (Delta) in analysed parameters between various time-intervals (II-I, III-I, IV-II and IV-III) were taken into account.", 
    "106": "Intravenous propranolol occurred effective in preventing syncope during second TT in 29/37 (78%) patients. The DeltaSBP, DeltaMBP and DeltaDBP values calculated from periods III and IV were significantly different between patients with or without protective effects of propranolol. The cut-off values which were computed to obtain the highest value of total predictive accuracy (the highest value of the sum of sensitivity and specificity) were -5 mmHg for DeltaSBP, -4 mmHg for DeltaMBP and -2 mmHg for DeltaDBP. A stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that DeltaSBP of -5 mmHg or less had the highest value in the prediction of a positive response to propranolol, reaching a sensitivity of 72%, specificity of 88%, positive predictive value of 95% and negative predictive value of 48%.", 
    "107": "Propranolol-induced changes in blood pressure values may predict the effectiveness of beta-blockade in preventing syncope during second TT performed after intravenous infusion of propranolol.

    "108": "We investigated whether antibody production to antigens arising in the subarachnoid space is depressed acutely after spinal cord injury (SCI), and whether such depression is due to abnormal catecholamine levels. To assess antibody responses, ovalbumin (OVA) was injected into the spinal subarachnoid space (i.t.) of rats via an indwelling catheter after SCI at T4 or laminectomy (LAM). Antibody responses tested at days 0, 7, and 14 (d0, d7, d14) postinjury revealed that SCI animals exhibited an antibody response significantly lower than LAM animals on d7, but one that reached control levels by d14. ELISPOT assays indicated that the cervical lymph nodes, known to be innervated by superior cervical ganglia (SCG), processed i.t. OVA. The reduction in antibody production after SCI could not be mimicked with surgical deafferentation of the SCG. However, blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors prior to SCI did reverse the decrease, suggesting an adverse effect of the surge of catecholamines that accompanies the injury. Surgical removal of sympathetic inputs to the cervical lymph nodes prior to SCI failed to reverse the effect on antibody production, suggesting a systemic source of catecholamines. We conclude that antibody responses against i.t. antigens are attenuated acutely after SCI due to the massive release of systemic catecholamines that accompanies SCI.", 
    "109": "The effect of hydrocortisone (50 mg/kg body wt i.p.) under beta-adrenergic receptors blockade (four subcutaneous injections of propranolol in single dose of 5 mg/kg body wt with 3 h interval) on phagocytic activity and oxygen dependent microbicidal activity in NBT-test of peripheral blood phagocytic cells in male Wistar rats was investigated. It was established that hydrocortisone stimulated neutrophil phagocytic activity through 6, 24 and 48 h after hormone injection and decreased oxygen-dependent microbicidal activity of phagocytic cells in NBT-test. Hydrocortisone in vitro (500 ng/ml) decreased neutrophil phagocytic activity that indicated on realization of stimulating effect of hydrocortisone in vivo through complex of other indirect mechanisms. Administration of hydrocortisone led to depression of eosinophil phagocytosis and lesser decrease in monocyte phagocytic activity. Hydrocortisone effects were significantly modified under blockade of beta-adrenoceptors that indicated on its mediation by endogenous catecholamines through modulation of beta-adrenoceptor expression.", 
    "110": "Catecholamines stimulate cardiac contractility through beta(1)-adrenergic receptors (beta(1)-ARs), which in humans are polymorphic at amino acid residue 389 (Arg/Gly). We used cardiac-targeted transgenesis in a mouse model to delineate mechanisms accounting for the association of Arg389 with human heart failure phenotypes. Hearts from young Arg389 mice had enhanced receptor function and contractility compared with Gly389 hearts. Older Arg389 mice displayed a phenotypic switch, with decreased beta-agonist signaling to adenylyl cyclase and decreased cardiac contractility compared with Gly 389 hearts. Arg389 hearts had abnormal expression of fetal and hypertrophy genes and calcium-cycling proteins, decreased adenylyl cyclase and G alpha(s) expression, and fibrosis with heart failure This phenotype was recapitulated in homozygous, end-stage, failing human hearts. In addition, hemodynamic responses to beta-receptor blockade were greater in Arg389 mice, and homozygosity for Arg389 was associated with improvement in ventricular function during carvedilol treatment in heart failure patients. Thus the human Arg389 variant predisposes to heart failure by instigating hyperactive signaling programs leading to depressed receptor coupling and ventricular dysfunction, and influences the therapeutic response to beta-receptor blockade.",

Our goal was to use newly discovered APP 5' UTR directed compounds to limit amyloid-beta (Abeta)-peptide output in cell culture systems. The APP 5' UTR folds into a stable RNA secondary structure (Gibbs free energy: DeltaG = -54.9 kcal/mol) and is an important regulator of the amount of APP translated in response to IL-1 (Nilsson et al., 1998; Rogers et al., 1999) and iron (Rogers et al., 2002). Seventeen drug \"hits\" were identified from a library of 1,200 FDA preapproved drugs (Rogers et al., 2002). Six of the original 17 compounds were validated for their capacity to suppress reporter gene expression in stable neuroblastoma transfectants expressing the dicistronic reporter construct shown in Fig. 2. These six leads suppressed APP 5' UTR driven luciferase translation while causing no effect on the translation of dicistronic GFP gene translated from a viral IRES (negative control to ensure specificity during drug screens). In this report, we show that paroxetine (serotonin reuptake blocker) and dimercaptopropanol (Hg chelator) exerted significant effects on APP expression (steady-state levels of APP), whereas Azithromycin altered APP processing. None of these three compounds altered APLP-1 expression. In the future, we will identify further novel compounds that influence Abeta levels, either via translation inhibition or by changing the activity of proteins coupled between APP translation and APP processing.", 
    "116": "Erythrocytic mechanisms involved in malarial infection are poorly understood. We have found that signaling via the erythrocyte beta2-adrenergic receptor and heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (Galphas) regulated the entry of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Agonists that stimulate cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate production led to an increase in malarial infection that could be blocked by specific receptor antagonists. Moreover, peptides designed to inhibit Galphas protein function reduced parasitemia in P. falciparum cultures in vitro, and beta-antagonists reduced parasitemia of P. berghei infections in an in vivo mouse model. Thus, signaling via the erythrocyte beta2-adrenergic receptor and Galphas may regulate malarial infection across parasite species.",

    "121": "Vagal mechanoreceptors to the guinea-pig oesophagus, recorded extracellularly, in vitro, fired spontaneously at 3.3 +/- 0.2 Hz, (n = 75, from 57 animals), and had low thresholds to circumferential stretch. In this study, we have investigated whether mechanotransduction by intraganglionic laminar endings (IGLEs) directly relies on mechano-gated ion channels, or whether it is due to chemical activation by neurotransmitters (glutamate or ATP) released from other cells during mechanical distortion. Rapid distortion of focal transduction sites (IGLEs) evoked action potentials with a latency of < 10 ms. Antagonists to ionotropic (AP5, memantine and 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX)) and metabotropic glutamate receptors (N-phenyl-7-(hydroxyimino)cyclopropa[b]chromen-1a-carboxamide (PHCCC) and (RS)-a-methyl-4-phosphono-phenylglycine (MPPG)) did not affect mechano-transduction. Glutamate, NMDA and the selective mGluR group II and III agonists, (2R, 4R)-APDC and L-AP4, had no effect on spontaneous or stretch-induced firing. The P2X purinoreceptor agonist, alpha,beta-methylene ATP, caused concentration-dependent excitation of vagal mechanoreceptors (EC50 = 22.2 microM) which was blocked by the non-selective P2 antagonist PPADS (30 microM). On its own, PPADS affected neither stretch-induced firing nor spontaneous firing. Neither Ca(2+)-free solution (1 mM EDTA, 3.6 mM Mg(2+)) solution nor Cd(2+) (100 microM) blocked stretch-induced firing. Thus chemical transmission is not involved in activation of vagal mechanoreceptors. The blocker of stretch-activated channels, Gd(3+) (300 microM), did not inhibit stretch-induced firing. However, benzamil (100 microM) significantly inhibited spontaneous and distension-evoked firing in a stretch-dependent manner; proportionally greater inhibition was seen with larger stretches. The results suggest that IGLEs of vagal tension receptors directly transduce mechanical stimuli probably via benzamil-sensitive, Gd3+-insensitive, stretch-activated ion channels, and that chemical transmission is not involved in transduction.",

Thirty-three patients (30.8%) had postoperative AF.

    "125": "We measured the effects of electrical stimulation of the central cut end of the lingual nerve on lower lip blood flow (LBF) and on arterial blood pressure in urethane-anesthetized, artificially ventilated, cervically vagosympathectomized rabbits. Different effects were observed depending on the stimulus frequency. Increasing the stimulus frequency above 5 Hz produced progressively larger ipsilateral LBF increases until the optimal frequency was reached at 20 Hz. In contrast, stimulation at above 0.5 Hz evoked progressively larger decreases in both contralateral LBF and arterial blood pressure until the optimal frequency was reached at around 10 and 2 Hz, respectively. Thus, the optimal stimulus frequencies for the ipsilateral LBF increase and the arterial blood pressure decrease were widely different. The lingual nerve-evoked change (i.e., fall) in arterial blood pressure showed a significant correlation with the contralateral LBF decrease, but not with the ipsilateral LBF increase. Prior administration of hexamethonium at 10 mg/kg markedly reduced both the ipsilateral LBF increase and arterial blood pressure decrease, although it was more effective against the former than against the latter. Pretreatment with scopolamine (muscarinic-receptor antagonist, 0.1 mg/kg), phentolamine (alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist, 0.1 mg/kg), or propranolol (beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, 0.1 mg/kg) failed to affect either response. However, 1.0 mg/kg phentolamine significantly reduced both responses (P<0.05). These results indicate that, in the rabbit, the LN-evoked reflex increase in ipsilateral LBF is (a) largely independent of any concomitant arterial blood pressure change and (b) probably due to active vasodilatation mediated via parasympathetic mechanisms. In contrast, the evoked decrease in contralateral LBF was proportional to the decrease in arterial blood pressure, suggesting that the former was secondary to the latter.",

Molecular investigation indicated that carvedilol specifically downregulated NF-kappaB but not activator protein 1 DNA-binding activity in activated T cells. The inhibitory effect was likely due to its antioxidative property. Meanwhile, carvedilol prevented stimuli-induced IkappaBalpha degradation. Such an effect was mediated through the inhibition of IkappaBalpha kinase activity. The inhibitory specificity on NF-kappaB by carvedilol was also demonstrated in transfection assays.",

At 1 year, mortality remained significantly lower in the highest tertile countries (8.4% vs 10.6% vs 9.9%, P=0.001). Following adjustment for baseline patient characteristics, Cox regression analysis confirmed an excess of 30-day and 1-year mortality in the lowest and intermediate tertiles compared to the highest tertile.

The rats given isoproterenol (150 mg kg(-1) daily, i.p.) for 2 d showed significant increase in serum and heart lysosomal hydrolases activity. Isoproterenol administration to rats resulted in decreased stability of the membranes, which was reflected by the lowered activity of cathepsin-D and beta-glucuronidase in mitochondrial, nuclear, lysosomal and microsomal fractions. Pretreatment with nicorandil (2.5 mg kg(-1) daily, p.o.) and amlodipine (5.0 mg kg(-1) daily, p.o.) for 3 d significantly prevented these alterations and restored the enzyme activity to near normal. These findings demonstrate that the pretreatment with nicorandil and amlodipine could preserve lysosomal integrity and hence establish the cardioprotective effect of the combination.",

    "152": "In many cells, ATP-sensitive K+ channels (KATP channels) couple metabolic state to excitability. In pancreatic beta cells, for example, this coupling regulates insulin release. Although KATP channels are abundantly expressed in the brain, their physiological role and the factors that regulate them are poorly understood. One potential regulator is H2O2. We reported previously that dopamine (DA) release in the striatum is modulated by endogenous H2O2, generated downstream from glutamatergic alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-receptor activation. Here we investigated whether H2O2-sensitive KATP channels contribute to DA-release modulation by glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). This question is important because DA-glutamate interactions underlie brain functions, including motor control and cognition. Synaptic DA release was evoked by using local electrical stimulation in slices of guinea pig striatum and monitored in real time with carbon-fiber microelectrodes and fast-scan cyclic voltammetry. The KATP-channel antagonist glibenclamide abolished the H2O2-dependent increase in DA release usually seen with AMPA-receptor blockade by GYKI-52466 [1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine hydrochloride] and the decrease in DA release seen with GABA-type-A-receptor blockade by picrotoxin. In contrast, 5-hydroxydecanoate, a mitochondrial KATP-channel blocker, was ineffective, as were sulpiride, a D2-receptor antagonist, and tertiapin, a G protein-coupled K+-channel inhibitor. Diazoxide, a sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1)selective KATP-channel opener, prevented DA modulation by H2O2, glutamate, and GABA, whereas cromakalim, a SUR2-selective opener, did not. Thus, endogenous H2O2 activates SUR1-containing KATP channels in the plasma membrane to inhibit DA release. These data not only demonstrate that KATP channels can modulate CNS transmitter release in response to fast-synaptic transmission but also introduce H2O2 as a KATP-channel regulator.", 
    "153": "It is becoming increasingly clear that signaling via G protein-coupled receptors is a diverse phenomenon involving receptor interaction with a variety of signaling partners. Despite this diversity, receptor ligands are commonly classified only according to their ability to modify G protein-dependent signaling. Here we show that beta2AR ligands like ICI118551 and propranolol, which are inverse agonists for Gs-stimulated adenylyl cyclase, induce partial agonist responses for the mitogen-activated protein kinases extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 thus behaving as dual efficacy ligands. ERK1/2 activation by dual efficacy ligands was not affected by ADP-ribosylation of Galphai and could be observed in S49-cyc- cells lacking Galphas indicating that, unlike the conventional agonist isoproterenol, these drugs induce ERK1/2 activation in a Gs/i-independent manner. In contrast, this activation was inhibited by a dominant negative mutant of beta-arrestin and was abolished in mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking beta-arrestin 1 and 2. The role of beta-arrestin was further confirmed by showing that transfection of beta-arrestin 2 in these knockout cells restored ICI118551 promoted ERK1/2 activation. ICI118551 and propranolol also promoted beta-arrestin recruitment to the receptor. Taken together, these observations suggest that beta-arrestin recruitment is not an exclusive property of agonists, and that ligands classically classified as inverse agonists rely exclusively on beta-arrestin for their positive signaling activity. This phenomenon is not unique to beta2-adrenergic ligands because SR121463B, an inverse agonist on the V2 vasopressin receptor-stimulated adenylyl cyclase, recruited beta-arrestin and stimulated ERK1/2. These results point to a multistate model of receptor activation in which ligand-specific conformations are capable of differentially activating distinct signaling partners.", 
    "154": "The post-Golgi trafficking of rhodopsin in photoreceptor cells is mediated by rhodopsin-bearing transport carriers (RTCs) and regulated by the small GTPase rab8. In this work, we took a combined pharmacological-proteomic approach to uncover new regulators of RTC trafficking toward the specialized light-sensitive organelle, the rod outer segment (ROS). We perturbed phospholipid synthesis by activating phospholipase D with sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) or inhibiting phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase by propranolol (Ppl). S1P stimulated the overall rate of membrane trafficking toward the ROS. Ppl stimulated budding of RTCs, but blocked membrane delivery to the ROS. Ppl caused accumulation of RTCs in the vicinity of the fusion sites, suggesting a defect in tethering, similar to the previously described phenotype of the rab8T22N mutant. Proteomic analysis of RTCs accumulated upon Ppl treatment showed a significant decrease in phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate-binding proteins ezrin and/or moesin. Ppl induced redistribution of moesin, actin and the small GTPase rac1 from RTCs into the cytosol. By confocal microscopy, ezrin/moesin and rac1 colocalized with rab8 on RTCs at the sites of their fusion with the plasma membrane; however, this distribution was lost upon Ppl treatment. Our data suggest that in photoreceptors phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate, moesin, actin, and rac1 act in concert with rab8 to regulate tethering and fusion of RTCs. Consequentially, they are necessary for rhodopsin-laden membrane delivery to the ROS, thus controlling the critical steps in the biogenesis of the light-detecting organelle.", 
    "155": "Hypertension and hyperuricaemia are common side-effects of cyclosporin A (CsA) treatment in renal transplant recipients. While it is well established that the calcium channel blocker amlodipine can control CsA-induced hypertension effectively in this patient population, recent evidence suggests amlodipine might also reduce hyperuricaemia. The present study was designed to compare the effects of the calcium channel blocker amlodipine (5-10 mg/day) and the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist tertatolol (5-10 mg/day) on CsA-induced hyperuricaemia in post-renal transplant recipients with hypertension.", 
    "156": "Forty-eight hypertensive renal transplant recipients on a stable dose of CsA were randomized in a double-blind, parallel-group manner to receive either amlodipine (n = 24) or tertatolol (n = 24) for 60 days. The primary outcome measure was the change from baseline in serum uric acid concentration. Secondary analyses of efficacy were based on changes in renal function and blood pressure.", 
    "157": "Amlodipine significantly decreased serum uric acid levels from 483 +/- 99 to 431 +/- 110 microM/l (P < 0.001), while tertatolol significantly increased uric acid from 450 +/- 98 to 476 +/-84 microM/l (P = 0.006). Amlodipine also significantly increased glomerular filtration rate (P = 0.0048) and the clearance rate of uric acid (P = 0.023) and it reduced the fractional proximal tubular reabsorption of sodium (P < 0.001), compared with tertatolol. Renal plasma flow and filtered fraction were unaffected by both treatments, as was trough CsA blood concentration. Amlodipine lowered systolic blood pressure to a significantly greater extent than did tertatolol (P = 0.007). The time-dependent profile of diastolic blood pressure did not differ significantly between treatment groups. Both drugs were well tolerated.",

    "159": "The pathomechanisms that cause renal damage in diabetes have not been completely clarified. Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-i) is highly effective but fails to completely prevent end-stage renal disease. The effects of ET(A)-receptor blockers (ET(A)-RB) on renal damage are controversial and have rarely been investigated in type 2 diabetes. We compared the influence of the selective ET(A)-RB LU135252 and the ACE-i Trandolapril on renal structure in the SHR/N-cp rat model of type 2 diabetes. Three-month-old male SHR/N-cp rats were left untreated or received daily either Trandolapril or LU135252. The experiment was terminated after 6 months. The glomerulosclerosis index; tubulointerstitial damage index; and glomerular geometry, glomerular cell number, and capillary density were investigated. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen and desmin expression of podocytes, renal mRNA expression of endothelin (ET-1) and transforming growth factor-beta, blood pressure, and urine albumin excretion were measured. The glomerulosclerosis index was significantly higher in untreated diabetic animals than in the groups that were treated with ACE-i and ET(A)-RB. There were analogous changes in tubulointerstitial damage index. Treatment with either substance comparably lowered urinary albumin excretion in diabetic SHR/N-cp. Podocyte and endothelial cell numbers per glomerulus decreased in untreated diabetic animals; this was prevented by the ACE-i but not by the ET(A)-RB. Glomerular capillary length density was lower in SHR/N-cp, and this was normalized by ACE-i only. Increased expression of desmin and proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression of podocytes in the SHR/N-cp was abrogated by ACE-i but not by ET(A)-RB. Treatment with ACE-i or ET(A)-receptor antagonist resulted in less structural and functional alterations, but the ET(A)-RB was inferior to the ACE-i. This is particularly the case for podocyte changes pointing to angiotensin II-dependent pathomechanisms.", 
    "160": "Partially coated perforated systems (PCPS) based on low-viscosity hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) as the polymeric material were formerly designed, prepared and evaluated in terms of in vitro behaviour. These systems proved to afford the pursued linear release with model drugs (metoprolol tartrate and benfluorex) of different solubility. To the aim of exploring the mechanisms concurring in the definition of zero-order kinetics, studies of drug release, polymer dissolution and medium penetration were performed on PCPS and constant release area systems (CRAS). According to the obtained results, PCPS release kinetics has to be mainly attributed to the progressive outward erosion of the core and to the related variation of the release area. The special geometry of the system, in fact, involves a gradual increase in the release surface, which allows the diffusional path lengthening to be offset. By properly selecting the shape and dimensions of the device as well as the physico-chemical characteristics of the hydrophilic polymer, the advantage of a zero-order release kinetics with programmable rate can be achieved.",

We randomly assigned patients candesartan (n=1276, target dose 32 mg once daily) or placebo (n=1272). At baseline, 55% of patients were also treated with beta blockers and 17% with spironolactone. The primary outcome of the study was the composite of cardiovascular death or hospital admission for CHF. Analysis was done by intention to treat.",

    "165": "A cell culture model of human corneal epithelium (HCE-model) was recently introduced [Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 42 (2001) 2942] as a tool for ocular drug permeation studies. In this study, passive permeability and esterase activity of the HCE-model were characterised. Immortalised human corneal epithelial cells were grown on collagen coated filters under air-lift. The sensitivity of transcellular permeability to lipophilicity was tested in studies using nine beta-blockers. The size selectivity of the paracellular route was investigated using 16 polyethylene glycol oligomers (PEG). An effusion-like approach was used to estimate porosity and pore sizes of the paracellular space in HCE membrane. Permeability and degradation of fluorescein diacetate to fluorescein in HCE-cells was used to probe the esterase activity of the HCE-model. Drug concentrations were analyzed using HPLC (beta-blockers), LC-MS (PEGs), and fluorometry (fluorescein). Permeabilities were compared to those in the excised rabbit cornea. Penetration of beta-blockers increased with lipophilicity according to a sigmoidal relationship. This was almost similar to the profile in excised cornea. No apical to basolateral directionality was seen in the permeation of beta-blockers. Paracellular permeability of the HCE-model was generally slightly higher than that of the excised rabbit cornea. The HCE-model has larger paracellular pores, but lower pore density than the excised cornea, but the overall paracellular space was fairly similar in both models. The HCE-model shows significant esterase activity (i.e. fluorescein diacetate was converted to free fluorescein). These data on permeability of 27 compounds demonstrate that the barrier of the HCE-model closely resembles that of the excised rabbit cornea. Therefore, the HCE-model is a promising alternative corneal substitute for ocular drug delivery studies.",

Treatment success was defined as either cardioversion to sinus rhythm or a reduction in the ventricular rate to < or =90 b.p.m. at 24 h after the start of therapy. Time to treatment success and the occurrence of adverse effects were considered secondary outcomes.",

The average duration of the esmolol and diltiazem infusions were 19.3 +/- 8.5 h and 20.1 +/- 11.3 h, respectively. Based on the combined efficacy endpoint of cardioversion or ventricular rate control, esmolol was significantly more effective than diltiazem (90% vs 77%; p = 0.038). Time to treatment success was significantly better for esmolol than diltiazem at all time points (1, 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 h post-treatment). The overall incidence of adverse effects was 44% with esmolol and 60% with diltiazem (p = 0.04).

    "174": "The management of hypertension has evolved over the past decade. Isolated systolic blood pressure elevation, the most common form of uncontrolled hypertension, is recognized as a significant risk factor for vascular complications in patients with hypertension. Nutritional management of hypertension has moved beyond simply restricting sodium intake to ensuring that patients consume adequate amounts of the major food groups, particularly those containing calcium, potassium, and magnesium. Selective aldosterone receptor blockers are a new class of antihypertensive medication, and the angiotensin-receptor blocker class has several new additions. However, the main-stay of treatment remains a diuretic or a combination of a diuretic and either a beta blocker or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Hypertension is a significant risk factor for vascular complications of diabetes, and the target blood pressure in patients with diabetes or chronic renal disease and hypertension should be lower than that in patients with hypertension alone. Controlling hypertension in elderly patients can reduce their complications at least as much as it does those of younger patients with hypertension.",

There was a significant increase in despair behavior (immobility period) in saline treated mice on successive days. Treatment with potent antioxidants carvedilol (5 mg/kg, i.p.) and melatonin (10 mg/kg, i.p.) produced a significant reduction in immobility period. Similar results were observed with herbal products St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum L) (10 mg/kg, p.o.) and GS-02 (20 mg/kg, p.o.). Fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor produced a significant effect only on first and second day of its treatment. Biochemical analysis revealed that chronic swim test significantly increased lipid peroxidation and catalase levels in whole brains of mice. There was a decrease in the levels of super oxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione reductase (GSH) in the brain. Administration of carvedilol, melatonin, GS-02 and St. John's Wort restored the levels of lipid peroxidation and glutathione. The enzymes SOD and catalase were also restored. Fluoxetine affected the biochemical variables not to the same extent as other treatments. The findings of the present study suggest that oxidative stress might play a significant role in the pathophysiology of CFS. Thus antioxidants and herbal products like St. Johns wort and GS-02 could be useful in the treatment of CFS.",

So far, the AUREC investigators have identified subgroups of patients with a particular high risk of recurrence: patients with a history of venous thrombosis, elevated levels of coagulation factors VIII, IX and XI, pulmonary embolism or superficial venous thrombosis and a history of venous thrombosis and hyperhomocysteinemia. Patients with a history of venous thrombosis and mutations in genes encoding for coagulation factors (factor V Leiden, factor II, G20210A) do not have an enhanced risk of recurrence and, thus, do not qualify for extended secondary thromboprophylaxis. At present, interventional trials are in progress in patients with high factor VIII or hyperhomocysteinemia in order to investigate if these patient groups might benefit from extended oral anticoagulation or vitamin supplementation, respectively.",

In SHR cardiomyocytes, either beta-AR subtype-mediated inotropic effect was markedly diminished, whereas G(i) proteins and the beta2/beta1 ratio were increased. Disruption of G(i) signaling by pertussis toxin (PTX) enabled beta2- but not beta1-AR to induce a full positive inotropic response in SHR myocytes. Furthermore, screening of a panel of beta2-AR ligands revealed that the contractile response mediated by most beta2-AR agonists, including zinterol, salbutamol, and procaterol, was potentiated by PTX, indicating concurrent G(s) and G(i) activation. In contrast, fenoterol, another beta2-AR agonist, induced a full positive inotropic effect in SHR myocytes even in the absence of PTX.",

The left anterior descending artery in Wistar rats were ligated to establish ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) models. The model animals were divided into two groups: I/R group, the model rats not subject to other treatments except ischemia-reperfusion (n = 8); carvedilol-treated group (n = 8), I/R model rats treated with carvedilol. Eight rats in the sham-operated group were subjected to only experimental open operation. The number of apoptotic cardiomyocyte was determined by TUNEL staining. Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization histochemistry (ISHH) were used to detect the expression of bcl-2 and bax genes. Image processing system was used to quantitatively dispose the positive metric substances of both immunohistochemistry and ISHH through the average optical density (OD) value. The results showed that the number of the apoptotic cells were 36.18 +/- 9 (I/R group), 0-1 (sham-operated group) and 9.5 +/- 3 (carvedilol-treated group) in each visual field respectively with the difference being very significant among the groups (P < 0.001).
