    "0": "The effects of beta- and alpha-adrenoreceptor blockade on renal function are reviewed briefly, and a detailed analysis of the effects of labetalol, an antihypertensive drug that blocks both alpha and beta adrenoreceptors, is presented. In most published studies, no significant change in any parameter of renal function is seen during labetalol therapy. Data from our institution are presented in detail demonstrating the effects of labetalol on renal function in 17 patients with either normal renal function or varying degrees of renal impairment. No consistent change in glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, filtration fraction, maximal concentrating ability, or free-water clearance is observed. Renal vascular resistance tends to fall in those patients with relatively normal renal function and tends to change inconsistently in patients with more impaired renal function. Labetalol appears, in summary, to have little negative impact on renal function.", 
    "1": "The prognostic value of abnormalities resulting from predischarge submaximal treadmill exercise testing was evaluated in 222 patients after myocardial infarction. The presence of the following variables--ST segment depression and elevation, an abnormal blood pressure response, limited exercise duration, angina pectoris, ventricular arrhythmias--were predictive of subsequent cardiac events (P less than 0.001) among the 154 patients with one or more of these abnormalities. When the presence or absence of specific variables was assessed, only an abnormal blood pressure response, limited exercise duration (P less than 0.001), and ST segment elevation and shift (P less than 0.05), were significantly associated with cardiac death. Exercise-induced angina was predictive only of the development of subsequent angina (P less than 0.05), and ST depression was associated only with future coronary surgery (P less than 0.01). Ventricular arrhythmias had no independent prognostic value. Markers of left ventricular dysfunction elicited by submaximal exercise testing are therefore valuable in identifying patients at high risk of death after infarction. Hallmarks of residual reversible myocardial ischaemia are of limited prognostic importance. The test result may be useful in selecting patients for coronary angiography.", 
    "2": "The intraocular pressure response to ACC-9447, a topical beta adrenergic antagonist, in six drug concentrations from 0.2% to 4.0%, was evaluated in 17 normal human subjects. ACC-9447 employs a new strategy for reducing systemic effects of ocular drugs by exploiting physiologic blood esterases to deactivate the drug rapidly after systemic absorbtion. Each patient received the test drug in one eye and placebo in the fellow eye. Intraocular pressure was measured nine times over the subsequent 24-hour period. The tests were repeated for six increasing concentrations over six weekend days. Although the eyes receiving ACC-9447 exhibited a significant 24-hour reduction in pressure from baseline, the effect was not different in placebo-treated eyes. Further studies are planned in ocular hypertensive patients using matched patient rather than fellow eye controls.", 
    "3": "We have characterized and quantified the binding of [3H]CGP-12177 to beta-adrenergic receptor sites in slices (300 microns) of rat cerebral cortex. The receptors are stereospecific, saturable and of high affinity. Binding of [3H]CGP is readily reversible and demonstrates appropriate drug specificity. This assay method allows the demonstration of isoproterenol-induced down-regulation (internalization) of beta-adrenoreceptors. Receptor recycling is observed at 37 degrees C in the absence of beta-agonist but can be blocked by low temperature (0 degree C) or by monensin. beta-Adrenoreceptors can also be labeled and quantified in intact, single pineal glands of rat, mouse and hamster. Rat pineals contain approximately 10 times more binding sites than do hamster or mouse pineals and up to 8 times more sites than found in rat cerebral cortex. Rat pineal [3H]CGP binding can be up- and down-regulated but not to the same degree as seen in brain slices. This assay method is simple, rapid and provides new opportunities for the study of other receptor types in intact tissue.", 
    "4": "The mechanisms of the actions of the beta-adrenergic partial agonist (befunolol) were studied in isolated guinea-pig taenia caecum. Befunolol, 2-acetyl-7-(2-hydroxy-3-isopropylaminopropoxy)benzofuran hydrochloride was found to be a typical partial agonist in guinea-pig taenia caecum. The pD2-value of befunolol was in agreement with its pKA-value obtained with photoaffinity labeling, but was different from its pA2-value against isoprenaline and pKI-value obtained from the inhibition of specific [3H]-dihydroalprenolol binding. The Scatchard plot of the specific [3H]-befunolol binding showed two affinity sites of the receptor in the absence of Gpp(NH)p, but the low affinity site was reduced while the high affinity site was not affected in the presence of Gpp(NH)p. The pKD-value of the high affinity site of befunolol was in agreement with its pA2-value, and the pKD-value of the low affinity site was in agreement with its pD2-value or pKA-value. These results suggest that the beta-adrenergic partial agonist may interact with two different sites: an agonist binding site and an antagonist binding site.", 
    "5": "Thirty-four untreated patients with essential hypertension WHO I-II, 17 patients under treatment with beta-blockade, and 32 healthy controls with a wide range of exercise capacity were studied at loadless pedaling (W0) and at the work load eliciting a blood lactate concentration corresponding to 4 mmol X l-1 (onset of blood lactate accumulation or OBLA). At W0 the treated patients had approximately the same systolic blood pressure (SBP) as the healthy controls, while the untreated patients had a higher SBP than the controls. At WOBLA the SBP was higher in the untreated patients than in both the treated patients and the healthy controls. On an individual basis it was found in the healthy controls and the untreated patients that the SBP at WOBLA showed a slight and insignificant increase versus SBP at W0, whereas the difference in SBP between WOBLA and W0 (\"exercise SBP increase\") demonstrated an inverse relationship (P less than 0.001-0,01) versus W0. It was suggested that for both healthy controls and untreated patients the exercise SBP depended on a \"basal\" level as depicted by W0 and a further SBP increase due to the exercise load. The difference between the two groups was that the patients with untreated hypertension displayed their relationships at higher pressure levels indicating the presence of a hyperkinetic drive. The treated patients appeared to have a lower increase in SBP between W0 and WOBLA than any other group, suggesting an unfavorable effect of the beta-blockade.", 
    "6": "Beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents may have, in addition to their primary action, also ancillary effects on the cell membrane. In the present paper the non-specific interaction of exaprolol with the ATPase systems in isolated rat heart sarcolemmal membranes was investigated. When preincubated with sarcolemmal membranes in vitro, exaprolol in concentrations below 10(-4) mol.l-1 had no significant effect on sarcolemmal Mg2+-, Ca2+- and (Na+ + K+)-ATPase activities. At exaprolol concentration of 10(-4) mol.l-1 the Mg2+- and Ca2+-ATPase activities became inhibited whereas the (Na+ + K+)-ATPase activity was markedly stimulated. A kinetic analysis of these interactions revealed a non-competitive inhibition of Mg2+- and Ca2+-ATPase. In the case of (Na+ + K+)-ATPase a synergistic type of stimulation characterized by an exaprolol-induced conversion of an essential sulfhydryl group in the active site of the enzyme to the more reactive [S-] form has been observed thus increasing the affinity of the enzyme to ATP. Exaprolol concentrations exceeding 5 X 10(-4) mol.l-1 induced an overall depression of the investigated enzyme activities.", 
    "7": "Pretreatment of anaesthetized rats with intravenously administered beta-adrenoceptor antagonists or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduced the incidence and severity of ventricular arrhythmia which resulted from acute coronary artery ligation. The beta-adrenoceptor antagonists preferentially suppressed the immediate (Phase 1A) arrhythmia while the NSAIDs suppressed the delayed (Phase 1B) arrhythmias. Combined administration of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists and the NSAIDs produced a more pronounced antiarrhythmic effect than either of the drugs alone.", 
    "8": "The prevalence of side-effects of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists among hypertensive patients was assessed by two methods. Using visual analogue scales, scores for tired legs, cold digits and vivid dreaming were significantly higher in patients taking beta-adrenoceptor blockers than in patients not taking beta-adrenoceptor blockers. When measured by numerical scales, from 1 to 10, these symptoms showed no relation to beta-adrenoceptor blocker treatment. The visual analogue scales were more sensitive than the numerical scales because the scores were distributed more evenly over the analogue scales.", 
    "9": "Simple tests of verbal reasoning and mental arithmetic, taken under mildly stressful conditions, have been shown to give a reproducible test of intellectual function within groups of normal subjects. Using these tests, in two separate examinations, a double-blind cross-over study was performed on 35 medical students to assess the effects of acute beta-adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol on intellectual function. With placebo treatment, students recorded an average total score of 231.3 marks, with average scores of 108.9 marks on the mental arithmetic paper and 122.4 marks on the verbal reasoning paper. Treatment with propranolol was associated with an improvement in total score of 9.2 +/- 3.9 marks (P less than 0.05), an improvement in mental arithmetic score of 5.6 +/- 2.3 marks (P less than 0.05) and an improvement in verbal reasoning score of 3.6 +/- 2.4 marks (NS). Eighteen out of the 35 students said that they were mildly anxious before one examination and 13 students said they were anxious before both examinations. Those students who admitted anxiety seemed to benefit the most, in terms of improved examination performance, from treatment with propranolol.", 
    "10": "Bopindolol is a potent and specific beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with partial agonist activity. In animal experiments it blocks both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors and possesses a long duration of action. In the present study in healthy volunteers bopindolol was about ten times more potent than pindolol in reducing isoprenaline-induced and exercise-induced tachycardia. In experiments on exercise-induced tachycardia an oral dose of 2 mg produced a near maximum reduction of exercise heart rate, occurring within 2 to 3 h of administration. With higher doses (up to 12 mg) the maximum effect was reached earlier (between 1 and 2 h). The long duration of action of bopindolol observed in animal studies was confirmed in man. Twenty-four hours after 4 and 10 mg bopindolol more than 2/3 of the maximum effect was still present. After 48 h 38% of the maximum effect of 4 mg and 50% of that of 12 mg remained. Even at 72 and 96 h exercise-induced tachycardia was still significantly lowered after both doses of the drug. When bopindolol was administered once daily for 5 days there was a slight increase in the maximum reduction of exercise-induced tachycardia during treatment with 1 mg/day but not with 4 mg/day, which produced a near maximum effect.", 
    "11": "The ventricular anti-arrhythmic action of 20 mg of betaxolol per day was evaluated in 14 patients treated in monotherapy for a fortnight, by means of repeated Holter recordings. A significant decrease in the number of ischemic ventricular extrasystoles was observed during the diurnal and nocturnal periods. Repetitive ventricular events were also reduced. Betaxolol therefore appears to have a direct anti-arrhythmic action which is not related to its action on the heart rate. The other effects of beta-blocker treatment were also observed: a decrease in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure and sinus bradycardia.", 
    "12": "To study the influence of chronic propranolol therapy on hemodynamic and metabolic adaptations associated with endurance training, five dogs given 250 mg X d-1 propranolol therapy (P) and five control dogs (NP) were endurance trained for 7 wk using a continuously increasing treadmill workload. The P group was also evaluated pre- and post-training off the drug (P-OD) to separate drug and training effects. Training lowered mean heart rate score (HR) to a standardized multistage dog treadmill test in the NP and P-OD (P less than 0.05) and had no effect on the HR of the P group while on propranolol. At a fixed submaximal workload there were also slight reductions in cardiac output in the P group which were more pronounced (P less than 0.10) following training, and a corresponding increase in a-vDO2. Pre- and post-training metabolic studies were performed at rest, during a fixed submaximal workload, and following 30 min of recovery. During exercise, blood glucose levels were significantly lower in the P group both before and after training. While NP showed no significant change in high-density lipoprotein bound cholesterol after training, the P-OD group demonstrated a significant fall in high-density lipoprotein bound cholesterol after training (P less than 0.05). These data indicate that endurance exercise training done in the presence of chronic beta-adrenergic blockade produces training-induced hemodynamic adaptations to exercise, but beta-blockade inhibits the changes in serum lipids and lipoprotein fractions normally seen in response to an exercise conditioning program.", 
    "13": "The putative central 5-HT receptor agonist, 5-methoxy-3(1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridin-4-yl)-1H-indole succinate (RU 24969), was found to be a potent inhibitor of the continuous K+ evoked efflux of [3H]5-HT from superfused rat frontal cortex slices (pD2 7.45). The effects of RU 24969 were attenuated by the putative 5-HT autoreceptor antagonists, methiothepin, quipazine and (-)-propranolol but not by the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, idazoxan. It is concluded that RU 24969 inhibits K+ evoked efflux of [3H]5-HT from rat frontal cortex slices by stimulation of the 5-HT autoreceptor. Moreover, since RU 24969 potently displaced ligand binding to the 5-HT1 and 5-HT1B recognition sites but was only weakly active at the 5-HT2 receptor, the results lend support to the claim for a pharmacological resemblance between the 5-HT autoreceptor and the 5-HT1 recognition site and in particular the low affinity 5-HT1B subtype.", 
    "14": "The pharmacologic treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy encompasses measures such as temporary administration of amino acids and calories for those who may be undernourished and avoidance of drugs such as alcohol, nicotine, amphetamines and high doses of tricyclic antidepressants. Anticoagulants should be used in patients with persistent failure or marked dilatation of the cardiac chambers since about 20% suffer from major embolic complications. In patients with ventricular tachycardia, R-on-T, or multifocal ventricular ectopic beats, class I antiarrhythmic drugs, or if unsuccessful, amiodarone should be administered since the risk of sudden death is substantial. In addition to digitalis and diuretics, the use of vasodilators is generally accepted to be of clinical value for reduction of symptoms in heart failure. Reports concerned with long-term clinical and hemodynamic effects with drugs such as prazosin, captopril and the combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate are conflicting and, so far, there is no evidence that any vasodilator prolongs survival. The beta-agonists, such as prenalterol, are limited in their usefulness by tachycardia induction, a tendency to provoke serious arrhythmias, tremor and anxiety as well as hemodynamic tolerance development. While the noncatecholamine inotropics such as milrinone may provide symptomatic relief in severe congestive heart failure, they also increase heart rate, induce ventricular arrhythmias and are associated with high one-year mortality rates. The beneficial effect of long-term beta-blockade, which we first reported in 1975 to include a decrease in functional class, increase in exercise tolerance, improvement in physical findings, increase in ejection fraction and enhanced survival, has been met with scepticism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "15": "A 58-year-old woman with diabetic autonomic dysfunction was well treated for orthostatic hypotension with pindolol. After eight months however, symptoms recurred in spite of continued treatment with pindolol. Addition of prenalterol, a beta-blocking agent with very high intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, had a marked clinical effect on her orthostatic hypotension. Before treatment with prenalterol, stroke volume and left ventricular enddiastolic volume markedly decreased during tilt, as demonstrated by radionuclide angiography. After short-term prenalterol treatment, the orthostatic decreases of stroke volume and left ventricular end-diastolic volume were less pronounced. During continued prenalterol treatment, both symptoms and haemodynamic changes recurred in the erect position. Beta-receptor density in her lymphocytes decreased from elevated levels before prenalterol to subnormal levels, when the clinical effect had disappeared. The data suggest that the tolerance development to prenalterol may be explained by the decrease in beta-adrenergic receptor density.", 
    "16": "Treatment of gravid rats (days 6-15 of gestation) with the beta-sympathomimetic doxaminol resulted in wavy ribs and bent limbs in the offspring. The fetuses also exhibited defective mineralization. These anomalies were produced by pharmacologically effective doses of the drug. Prior treatment with the beta-receptor blocker carazolol prevented their formation, so that the beta-sympathomimetic action of doxaminol is evidently a causative factor. Various hypotensive agents whose activity is not mediated by beta-receptors failed to produce abnormalities. This eliminates the possibility of a non-specific etiology such as diminished placental perfusion. The cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin lowered the incidence of wavy ribs. Furosemide, a loop diuretic that stimulates renal prostaglandin synthesis, increased the incidence of abnormalities when combined with doxaminol. The nature of the anomalies found suggests that 1) fetal compression by the myometrium and 2) defective mineralization are prerequisites for their development. The first condition could be produced via the complex mechanism of beta-sympathomimetic-induced stimulation of prostaglandin synthesis. Defective mineralization can result directly from cAMP-mediated activation of osteoclasts and possibly be further promoted by beta-sympathomimetic-mediated prostaglandin action on the osteoclast. The pathological findings in the fetal rat skeleton cannot be correlated with corresponding findings in human neonates whose mothers were subjected to prolonged therapeutic uterine relaxation with beta 2-sympathomimetics, for example. Since the anomalies in the rat disappear spontaneously in the post-natal period, their clinical relevance appears to be slight.", 
    "17": "4'-Hydroxypropranolol sulfate was recently identified as a major metabolite of propranolol (Inderal). In order to confirm the structure and to further study disposition and biological activity, we have synthesized 8 with use of 1,4-naphthoquinone as the starting material. Reduction and alkylation with benzyl iodide gave 4-(benzyloxy)naphthol. Sulfation and chlorosulfuric acid in N,N-dimethylaniline gave potassium 1-(benzyloxy)-4-naphthol sulfate. Catalytic hydrogenation, alkylation with [[[(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl]oxy]methyl]oxirane, and amination in isopropylamine gave 8. Racemic 8 was found to be 100-1000 times less potent than racemic propranolol as a beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent in the dog.", 
    "18": "The effects of tertatolol, a new and powerful beta adrenoceptor blocking drug, on post- and prejunctional beta receptors were investigated; canine vascular tissues (saphenous veins, coronary arteries and splenic arteries) and guinea-pig trachea and atria were used. At concentrations below 10(-5) M, tertatolol did not alter basal tension or contractile responses to electrical stimulation, norepinephrine, K+ or prostaglandin F2 alpha; at doses at or above 10(-5) M the drug-evoked contractions which were reduced by phentolamine and were absent in denervated veins. Tertatolol at 10(-5) M and 3 X 10(-5) M augmented the basal efflux of [3H] norepinephrine in saphenous veins labeled with the 3H-transmitter. In veins, 10(-5) M of tertatolol depressed the contractions caused by electrical stimulation without affecting those to exogenous norepinephrine; this concentration of the drug also inhibited the stimulation-induced overflow of [3H]norepinephrine. The major part of the present study was designed to test the beta receptor blocking properties of tertatolol and to compare its effects with those of propranolol. Tertatolol inhibited, in a concentration-dependent manner, the relaxations caused by isoproterenol in saphenous veins, splenic arteries and coronary arteries and the relaxations evoked by norepinephrine and epinephrine in coronary arteries; the potency of tertatolol was higher than that of propranolol. In trachea and right atria of the guinea-pig, tertatolol inhibited, in a concentration-dependent manner, the dose-response curves to isoproterenol; the relative potency of tertatolol was higher than that of propranolol. In dog saphenous veins, previously incubated with [3H]norepinephrine, tertatolol (10(-7)M) blocked the increased stimulation-evoked overflow of the 3H-transmitter induced by isoproterenol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "19": "The influence of chronic beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade on haemodynamic and metabolic responses was examined in eight young hypertensive subjects during a 40 min submaximal bicycle test at 50% of maximal capacity. The patients were randomly allocated to one placebo and one treatment period of 6 weeks. During treatment atenolol (Tenormin, 100 mg) was given twice daily. Arterial pressure, cardiac output, leg blood flow, oxygen uptake and different metabolites in the blood were determined. The heart rate was reduced by beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade by 30% during exercise, and the decrease was related to plasma concentration of the drug. Cardiac output was decreased by approximately 10%, but the negative chronotropic effect was partly compensated for by a higher stroke volume. Blockade leg blood flow was reduced by 10%, but more oxygen was extracted, giving an unchanged oxygen uptake. Blood concentration and leg uptake of glucose were not influenced by the treatment, but plasma free fatty acids were reduced by 30-40%. Leg lactate release was decreased to half the value in the unblocked situation. Plasma renin activity did not increase at the beginning of exercise, but after 40 min an increase was seen, though only to half of the pretreatment value. It is concluded that beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade during submaximal exercise reduces blood flow to the working muscles and that this reduction is the result of a lower cardiac output. Aerobic metabolism is unchanged as a result of increased oxygen extraction, but less fat is used as lipolysis is inhibited. Glucose uptake by the working muscles is unchanged by beta 1-blockade, but there is evidence for an increased carbohydrate metabolism. As for non-selective blockade, atenolol decreases lactate release but this could be the result of non-specific action on the beta 1-receptor and/or increased carbohydrate oxidation. Furthermore, the beta 1-adrenoceptors seem to have a major influence on the renin release during exercise.", 
    "20": "Elevations in the levels of total serum cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoproteins increase the risk of coronary artery disease and atherogenesis. High-density lipoproteins (HDLs) are beneficial in removing lipid from tissues. High-risk men adhering to a diet and/or receiving cholestyramine to lower their elevated lipid levels had lowering of cardiac mortality. Hypertension is also a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and for accelerated atherosclerosis. The benefit of blood pressure reduction may not be consistent in decreasing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality among all mildly hypertensive persons. Many antihypertensive agents may raise undesirable lipid fractions and/or lower HDL levels, enhancing the risk of cardiovascular disease, while others have few negative effects. Thus, the antihypertensive agent chosen may modify lipid levels and cardiovascular risk in hypertensive patients.", 
    "21": "The prolonged QT interval syndromes consist of two forms, one congenital and one acquired. The congenital form is probably due to an imbalance in the sympathetic nervous system supply to the heart. It is a preventable cause of sudden death both at an early age and during anesthesia. Recognition of congenital forms of prolonged QT interval and treatment with beta-adrenergic blockers have reduced the mortality. Special care in the perioperative period is necessary to prevent anesthetic-related deaths. The acquired form has many causes. These may be present preoperatively or they may occur intraoperatively. It is important that patients with ALQTS are recognized early and the underlying cause treated.", 
    "22": "beta-Adrenergic agonist-sensitive adenylate cyclase activity and binding of the beta-adrenergic antagonist(-)-[125I]iodopindolol were studied in rat liver during development of male Fischer 344 rats ages 6-60 days. In liver homogenates maximum adenylate cyclase response to beta-adrenergic agonist (10(-5) M isoproterenol or epinephrine) decreased by 73% (P less than 0.01) between 6 and 60 days, with most of the decrease (56%; P less than 0.01) occurring by 20 days. beta-adrenergic receptor density (Bmax) showed a corresponding decrease of 66% (P less than 0.01) by 20 days without subsequent change. Binding characteristics of stereospecificity, pharmacological specificity, saturability with time, and reversibility were unchanged with age. GTP-, fluoride-, forskolin-, and Mn2+-stimulated adenylate cyclase activities also decreased during development, suggesting a decrease of activity of the catalytic component and/or guanine nucleotide regulatory component of adenylate cyclase. These results indicate that the developmental decrease of beta-adrenergic agonist-sensitive adenylate cyclase activity may result from decreased numbers of beta-adrenergic receptors. Developmental alterations of nonreceptor components of the enzyme may also contribute to changes of catecholamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase.", 
    "23": "Exercise-induced bronchospasm, a very common component of asthma, may be quite bothersome and interfere with activities. The etiology appears to be related to the degree of heat loss in the tracheobronchial tree and to release of mediators from the mast cells. Exercise-induced asthma can be effectively treated, preferably with preventive medications such as beta 2 agonists or cromolyn (Intal). In the future, drugs such as nifedipine (Procardia) may also be useful, but as yet no calcium channel blocker has been approved for this indication.", 
    "24": "Weight reduction was compared with metoprolol (200 mg daily) in a randomised placebo-controlled trial of first-line treatment of mild hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 90-109 mm Hg) in 56 overweight patients aged under 55 years. After 21 weeks of follow up the weight-reduction group had lost an average of 7.4 kg. The fall in their systolic pressure of 13 mm Hg was significantly greater than that in the placebo group (7 mm Hg) but not different from that in the metoprolol group (10 mm Hg). Their fall in diastolic pressure (10 mm Hg) was greater than that in both the metoprolol (6 mm Hg) and placebo (3 mm Hg) groups. At the end of the follow-up period 50% of patients in the weight-reduction group had a diastolic pressure of less than 90 mm Hg. In the metoprolol group there was a decrease in high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and an increase in the ratio of total to HDL-cholesterol; in the weight-reduction group there was a decrease both in total cholesterol and in the ratio of total to HDL-cholesterol. Thus in this study population weight reduction produced significant and clinically important reductions in blood pressure but not the adverse effects on plasma lipids commonly associated with antihypertensive drug therapy.", 
    "25": "Prompt control of heart rate is important for successful treatment of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias early after open heart surgery when sympathetic tone is high and ventricular response rates may be rapid. Esmolol, a new ultrashort-acting (9 minute half-life) beta-receptor blocking agent, was given by continuous intravenous infusion for up to 24 hours in 24 patients (21 with isolated coronary bypass surgery and 3 with valve replacement) 1 to 7 days after surgery. Atrial fibrillation was present in 9 patients, atrial flutter in 2 and sinus tachycardia in 13. Eleven patients had received intravenous digoxin (average dose 0.6 mg, average serum level 1.19 mg/100 ml) before esmolol infusion without adequate control of the supraventricular tachyarrhythmia. After a 1 minute loading infusion of esmolol (500 micrograms/kg per min), maintenance dose, titrated to heart rate and blood pressure response, varied from 25 to 300 micrograms/kg per min. After esmolol administration, at an average dose of 139 +/- 83 micrograms/kg per min, mean heart rate decreased from 130 +/- 15 to 99 +/- 15 beats/min. Within 5 to 18 minutes after initiation of therapy, all patients had achieved a 15% reduction in heart rate at a maintenance dose of 150 micrograms/kg per min or less. A 20% reduction in heart rate was attained in 19 of the 24 patients, and conversion to sinus rhythm occurred during esmolol infusion in 5 of the 11 patients with atrial flutter or fibrillation. Transient asymptomatic hypotension (less than 90/50 mm Hg) was seen in 13 patients, requiring cessation of esmolol therapy in 2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "26": "The beta-adrenergic and calcium channel blocking drugs, which individually and combined have proven efficacious in the treatment of angina pectoris, appear to have opposing effects on coronary artery vasomotion. Previous studies have shown that beta-adrenergic blockade may potentiate and calcium channel blockade reverse coronary vasoconstriction during adrenergic cold stimulation in patients with coronary artery disease. To assess the coronary hemodynamic effects of combined drug therapy, thermodilution coronary sinus and great cardiac vein flow and mean arterial pressure were measured during serial cold pressor testing, both before and after 0.1 mg/kg of intravenous propranolol and again after the addition of 10 mg of sublingual nifedipine in 21 patients (9 without [group A1] and 12 with [group A2] greater than 50% narrowing of the left anterior descending coronary artery). In an additional 15 patients (6 patients without [group B1] and 9 with [group B2] left anterior descending artery stenosis), serial cold pressor testing was performed reversing the drug order. Despite significant increases in mean arterial pressure (p less than 0.01) during cold pressor testing, coronary sinus resistance responses after propranolol plus nifedipine were not statistically significant for any group. However, regional coronary resistance responses differed between patients with and without left anterior descending artery stenosis. In group A1, great cardiac vein resistance was unchanged after propranolol plus nifedipine. In group A2, great cardiac vein flow decreased significantly after propranolol plus nifedipine from 8 +/- 17 to -4 +/- 12% (p less than 0.01 versus control), and great cardiac vein resistance increased from 4 +/- 21 to 15 +/- 19% (p less than 0.01 versus control). A similar significant response was observed for groups B1 and B2. Regional coronary vasoconstriction during adrenergic stimulation after combined drug therapy was only observed in patients with significant left anterior descending artery stenosis. These data suggest that in some patients with severe coronary artery disease, combined beta-adrenergic and calcium channel blockade modified regional coronary responses to adrenergic stimulation with an inhomogeneous distribution of blood flow to potentially ischemic regions without affecting total coronary blood flow. These data also imply that an improvement in anginal symptoms after combined drug therapy may be due primarily to mechanisms that reduce myocardial oxygen demand rather than to improved myocardial oxygen supply.", 
    "27": "The effects of propranolol, 20 to 30 mg/day, on neuroleptic-induced akathesia were compared with those of lorazepam, 2 mg/day, and periods of no treatment. Raters were blind to treatment condition. As reported in prior open studies, propranolol was found to be dramatically effective in reducing akathesia induced by neuroleptic treatment.", 
    "28": "In urethane-anesthetized rats electrical stimulation of the A1 noradrenergic region in the ventrolateral medulla produced excitatory (27%), excitatory-inhibitory (24%), or inhibitory (34%) responses of spontaneous activity of phasically firing units in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. The latency of excitatory responses was significantly shorter in those followed by inhibition, suggesting the existence of two distinct excitatory pathways. The latency of inhibitory responses, however, was not different between primary and postexcitatory inhibitory responses. Effects of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists on responses of phasically firing PVN units to stimulation of the A1 region were tested. The excitatory responses that were not followed by inhibition were significantly attenuated by intraperitoneal phenoxybenzamine, whereas the other responses were not affected. Both primary and postexcitatory inhibitory responses were significantly attenuated by intravenous propranolol, whereas neither type of excitatory response was affected. These results suggest that the medullary (A1 region) inputs to phasically firing PVN units are mediated by alpha-adrenergic (excitatory), beta-adrenergic (inhibitory), and nonaminergic (excitatory) pathways.", 
    "29": "Effects of selective beta-adrenoceptor agonists on rectosigmoid motility during prolonged rectal distension were studied in 12 healthy volunteers in a double-blind, randomized fashion. Continuous distension was performed with a balloon in the proximal part of the rectum. Pressure was recorded by this balloon and by a catheter in the sigmoid. Contractile activity was quantified for three consecutive periods of 25 min. On separate days prenalterol (beta-1 agonist), terbutaline (beta-2 agonist), and placebo, respectively, were administered intravenously preceded by a control period. Terbutaline, 0.5 mg intravenously, was followed by a significant decrease of sigmoid motility from 4.3 +/- 1.5 (SEM) kPa X min to 2.9 +/- 1.0 kPa X min (P less than 0.01) and of rectal motility from 4.3 +/- 1.3 to 2.4 +/- 0.7 kPa X min (P less than 0.05). After placebo a slight, but not significant, increase of contractile activity was seen compared to the initial control period. The effects of prenalterol, 1.0 and 4.0 mg intravenously, on motility did not differ from that of placebo infusion. Both drugs caused a dose-dependent increase of systolic blood pressure and of heart rate. The study shows that beta-2-adrenoceptor stimulation decreases rectosigmoid colonic pressure in man, while effects of beta-1 stimulation on motility index do not differ from that of placebo.", 
    "30": "Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was introduced as an esterase inhibitor in the determination of two extremely labile, ultrashort-acting beta-blockers-esmolol and flumolol--in whole blood. SDS was much more efficient than previously used agents in preventing hydrolysis. The assay comprises solvent extraction, perfluoroacylation, and capillary gas-chromatography with electron-capture detection. The limit of detection (the concentration at which the coefficient of variation is 10-15%) for the drugs is 5 nmol/L of whole blood.", 
    "31": "The effects of orally administered diltiazem combined with maximally tolerated doses of beta-blockers and nitrates were assessed in 12 patients, who during stress testing exhibited persistent effort angina and continued objective evidence for inducible myocardial ischemia. Patients performed multistage semisupine exercise on a bicycle ergometer during equilibrium-gated radionuclide angiography after consecutive 2 week treatment periods of placebo or diltiazem 90 mg qid (mean dose 340 mg/day) combined with maximally tolerated propranolol (mean dose 178 mg/day) and isosorbide dinitrate (mean dose 137 mg/day). All medications (including diltiazem or placebo) were administered four times daily for the duration of the study. Diltiazem or placebo was administered according to a double-blind design, with randomized cross-over at the end of each 2 week treatment period. The average number of angina attacks decreased during the double-blind cross-over phase of the trial (7 +/- 7 episodes/week at baseline vs 4 +/- 3 on placebo vs 2 +/- 2 on diltiazem; p = .08). Angina pectoris was abolished during peak exercise in eight of 12 patients on diltiazem (p less than .05 vs placebo). Diltiazem increased total exercise duration from 276 +/- 92 to 310 +/- 78 sec (p less than .005 vs baseline). Diltiazem likewise increased the time to onset of angina from 231 +/- 84 sec at baseline to 305 +/- 77 sec (p less than .005), as well as the time to the onset of 1 mm ischemic ST segment depression (p = .01). Diltiazem decreased heart rate at rest, during submaximal workload, and at peak exercise (p less than .05), and decreased systolic blood pressure at peak exercise only (p less than .05). A significant decline in rate-pressure product at submaximal and peak exercise was noted (p less than .05). At any given workload there was significantly less ST segment depression during submaximal (p = .05) and peak exercise (p less than .025).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "32": "Forskolin, a direct activator of adenylate cyclase, stimulates cAMP production in islet cells. The effects of forskolin on the release of somatostatin, glucagon, and insulin were studied using the isolated, perfused dog pancreas. It was found that concentrations ranging from 0.075 microM-1 microM stimulated the secretion of somatostatin, glucagon, and insulin in a dose-related manner. The effects of 0.15 microM and of 0.6 microM forskolin were modulated by the prevailing glucose level with higher D and B and lower A cell responses at high (11 mM) than at low (2.8 mM) or zero glucose. In the absence of extracellular Ca++, forskolin (1 microM) possessed no stimulatory effect on pancreatic hormone secretion. Perfusion of 1 microM atropine, 1 microM propranolol, and 1 microM phentolamine had no effect on forskolin-mediated (0.3 microM) hormone output from pancreas. The phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine (25 microM) elicited qualitatively similar hormone response to forskolin. In conclusion, the experiments demonstrate that forskolin is a potent, reversible, stimulus of pancreatic hormone secretion. Its effects are apparently not mediated via the sympathetic or parasympathetic nerve endings in pancreas. Forskolin may prove to be a valuable pharmacological tool in probing the role of the adenylate cyclase-cAMP system in pancreatic hormone secretion.", 
    "33": "Pretreatment of lymphocytes (16 hr, 37 degrees C) with adrenaline at final concentrations of 10(-7) to 10(-9) M, followed by removal of the drug, increased natural killer (NK) cell activity vs K562 leukemic cells in a 4-hr 51Cr-release assay. The most efficient concentration of adrenaline was 10(-8) M; mean increase of NK activity over base-line activity for all donors examined was 30%. However, the individual response to adrenaline pretreatment was variable; in some donors, the effect was equal to maximal interferon (IFN) stimulation. Effects of adrenaline pretreatment were consistently reduced to base-line activity by co-incubation with the nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol at 100-fold higher concentrations. The enhancing effect of adrenaline (10(-8) M) pretreatment was also observed after 1-hr pretreatment; this effect was prevented by simultaneous incubation with propranolol but was not affected by dex-propranolol. Direct addition of adrenaline to lymphocyte/target cell mixtures was inhibitory at 10(-6) M adrenaline concentration. The inhibitory effect of adrenaline in this assay was again completely prevented by propranolol and unaffected by dex-propranolol. The observed stimulatory effect of adrenaline pretreatment could not be ascribed to IFN production. Data presented indicate a dual effect of adrenaline on NK cell activity and suggest both a positive and a negative beta-adrenoceptor-mediated regulation of human NK cells.", 
    "34": "The influences of beta adrenergic transmission on the regulation of paradoxical sleep (PS) were analysed in the rat. Pharmacological experiments have used beta 1,2 as well as preferential beta 1 or beta 2 compounds. The blockade of the beta 1 adrenoceptors induced a dose-related PS decrease, and stimulation of these preblocked receptors prevented this PS insomnia. SWS was generally not affected. It is concluded that beta 1 neurotransmission is directly involved in the regulation of PS.", 
    "35": "A rapid and sensitive automated system for measuring cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) synthesized from either radiolabelled adenine or adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) in intact and broken cell tissue preparations, respectively, is described. After incubation with radiolabelled precursor, tissue samples are deproteinized and then injected directly onto a reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic column. The column effluent fraction which contains cAMP is collected into scintillation vials and assayed for tritium by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Since the high-performance liquid chromatographic and fraction collection procedures are automated, over fifty samples can be analyzed in duplicate in a single day. The utility of this assay is illustrated by investigations of the effects of beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation on cAMP synthesis in tissue slices prepared from rat cerebral cortex and dopamine on cAMP synthesis in striatal membrane preparations.", 
    "36": "The solvent relaxation properties of the dansyl group attached to two lipids (dansylphosphatidylethanolamine and dansylphosphatidylserine), a fatty acid (dansylundecanoic acid), and two drugs (dansylbenzocaine and dansylpropranolol) were compared in a variety of different lipid systems. Several methods for characterising solvent relaxation were compared in detail for dansylpropranolol in bilayer vesicles of egg phosphatidylcholine. It was shown that the relaxation process is non-monoexponential; nevertheless, for comparative purposes, a model was adopted in which the lifetime associated with the negative exponent in a two exponential decay analysis, obtained at a particular energy on the red edge of emission, was taken as an approximation to a 'solvent relaxation' rate. A negative exponent, indicative of solvent relaxation processes, occurring in the nanosecond time-scale, was found only for dansylpropranolol, dansylPE and dansylundecanoic acid. On addition of the spin probe, 5-doxylstearate, the negative exponent was unaffected in liquid-crystalline phase lipids but was no longer found in gel-phase lipid in the case of dansylpropranolol, while for dansylPE the relaxation time was reduced. On the basis of these types of measurement it was possible to distinguish between different lipid environments using the same probe or between different dansyl environments of the different probes in the same lipid in cases where this would have been difficult or impossible solely on the basis of steady-state or fluorescence lifetime measurements.", 
    "37": "The plasma renin concentration was measured after anesthesia in control and in pertussis toxin-treated rats. The anesthetics increased renin secretion and this effect was markedly magnified in rats treated with pertussis toxin. Propranolol partially blocked the increase in plasma renin concentration produced by anesthetics. It is concluded that the adrenergic system is involved in this effect and that pertussis toxin magnifies it by potentiating the beta-adrenergic action.", 
    "38": "A semi-empirical conformational analysis is used to compute the conformation of (+)-propranolol inserted in dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine. In a first step, the minimal conformational energy of the isolated molecule at the hydrocarbon-water interface is calculated as the sum of the contributions resulting from the Van der Waals, the torsional, the electrostatic and the transfer energies. Five pairs of conformers of minimal energy are determined. They are compared to data available from other experimental approaches. In a second step, they are assembled with dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine at the interface. Although propranolol is considered in its protonated form, the electrostatic interaction with dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine is negligible as compared to the Van der Waals interaction. The area occupied per propranolol molecule is between 0.53 and 0.64 nm2/molecule. In the most probable modes of insertion of propranolol into the lipid layer, the naphthyl moiety of the compound interacts with the lipid acyl chains. The protonated amino group is located in the vicinity of the phosphate residue possibly causing an electrostatic interaction.", 
    "39": "As part of an investigation into the expression of neurotransmitter receptors on astroglia, we have developed a method to label beta-adrenergic receptors on immunocytochemically stained cultured cells using autoradiography of 125I-labelled beta-adrenergic receptor ligands. The current investigation was undertaken to determine whether the binding of [125I]pindolol (*IPIN) to immunocytochemically stained cultured cells, as measured by quantitative autoradiography, would fulfill the usual pharmacological criteria for specific beta-adrenergic receptor binding. *IPIN binding experiments were carried out on individual astroglia obtained from neonatal rat cerebral cortex and grown as primary cultures on polylysine-coated glass slides. Autoradiographic silver grains on cells which stained for the intracellular astroglial marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), were quantified by a microcomputer-based video digitizing system. We determined that competition for *IPIN binding by propranolol and isoproterenol was stereospecific, that specific binding of *IPIN was saturable, and that *IPIN binding sites were lost after isoproterenol-induced desensitization. These results provide convincing evidence that we can quantitatively examine beta-adrenergic receptors on single cells. The use of computerized video methods greatly facilitates the rapid quantitation of autoradiographic grains associated with immunocytochemically identified cells. This study is a unique demonstration of receptor binding parameters derived from single cells in a known population, and represents a novel approach to the problem of assessing cell-type specific receptors on neural cells in mixed primary cultures.", 
    "40": "The relationship of hepatic ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity to cyclic AMP levels and nutritional status was studied in the pre-weanling rat. Previous studies demonstrated that 2 hr without food causes a loss of hepatic ODC induction after glucagon or catecholamine injection. Isoproterenol or glucagon administration produced increased hepatic cyclic AMP and tyrosine aminotransferase activity which were not prevented by nutritional deprivation. Blockade of hepatic beta 2 receptors by the selective antagonist ICI 118,551 prevented increased cAMP levels and ODC activity after isoproterenol administration. Blockade of beta 1 receptors by atenolol did not prevent increased cAMP levels or ODC induction by isoproterenol although it did block activation of cardiac ODC. The phosphodiesterase inhibitor RO20-1724 increased hepatic cAMP levels as well as ODC and TAT activities, although the increase in ODC activity was attenuated by nutritional deprivation. RO20-1724 also potentiated the induction of hepatic ODC after glucagon or isoproterenol administration. Administration of 8-bromo cAMP elevated hepatic ODC activity regardless of nutritional status but also elevated serum levels of growth hormone and corticosterone. Hepatic ODC induction by glucagon or beta 2 agonists can be dissociated from changes in cAMP levels during nutritional deprivation.", 
    "41": "The effect of dopamine (DA) on 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) generation in the rabbit portal vein was investigated. Dopamine added to homogenates of rabbit portal vein increased the concentration of cAMP. DA-elicited cAMP increase was exclusively inhibited by DA antagonists fluphenazine and haloperidol suggesting the existence of DA receptors (of the DA1 subtype) in the portal vein.", 
    "42": "Doses of dobutamine (steady-state infusions) required to increase inotropy (as measured by isovolumic indices of contractility) were lower than those required to produce tachycardia in the anaesthetized cat. When compared to isoprenaline, dobutamine produced less tachycardia for common increases in inotropy and thus demonstrated inotropic selectivity in this model. Dobutamine also produced mild pressor effects which were potentiated by beta-adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol. In efforts to define the role of the partial agonist activity of dobutamine for alpha-adrenoceptors in the production of selective inotropy the effects of dobutamine infusions were observed in cats pretreated with the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine. In phentolamine-treated cats dobutamine did not demonstrate inotropic selectivity and showed a relationship between increased inotropy and tachycardia which was not significantly different from that obtained with isoprenaline. In contrast, phentolamine did not change the relationship between isoprenaline-induced tachycardia and increased inotropy. These data suggest that the agonist activity of dobutamine for alpha-adrenoceptors could be responsible for selective inotropy in the anaesthetized cat probably by baroreceptor-mediated reflex modulation of heart rate and/or possible stimulation of inotropic cardiac alpha-adrenoceptors.", 
    "43": "In the present study 12 of 13 untreated pigs died of ventricular fibrillation during three 10 min episodes of left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion interrupted by 20 min of reperfusion. The selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist bevantolol in a dose of 1.5 mg X kg-1, but not 0.5 mg X kg-1, offered nearly complete protection against this fatal arrhythmia. Evidence is also presented that bevantolol enhanced the recovery of regional myocardial function after these ischaemic events.", 
    "44": "Substance P (SP), bombesin (BB) and bradykinin (BK) induce dose-dependent contractions of the rat and guinea-pig urinary bladders (RUB, GPUB). The three peptides differ in their affinities and intrinsic activities, BB being the most active both in terms of affinity (pD2 8.33 in the RUB and 8.83 in the GPUB), SP (8.03 and 7.53), BK (7.20 and 7.35), and of intrinsic activity. The myotropic effects of BB and SP are not modified by antagonists of neurotransmitters and autacoids that occur in peripheral organs, but that of BK is reduced in the presence of both the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase inhibitors. Undeca- and octapeptide antagonist analogues of SP and SP-(4-11) show similar pA2 values against BB and SP and are inactive against BK: the compound [D-Pro4, Lys6, D-Trp7,9,10, Phe11] SP-(4-11) is however more active (pA2 6.36 in the RUB and 6.18 in the GPUB) against BB than against SP (pA2 5.33 and 5.65 respectively), while it is inactive against BK. These results confirm data from the literature as to the ability of some tachykinin-antagonists to act against BB and shows chemical modifications that can improve the antagonist potency selectively against BB.",

    "46": "In 1979, 51 general practitioners in the Northern region identified 336 patients aged 30 to 59 who had angina pectoris. Information was obtained on their treatment and how angina affected their daily lives. This study reviews the same patients after an interval of four years. Of the 307 who were not lost to follow up, 38 (12%) had died and 44 (14%) were free from angina in the last year. Drugs seemed to be used to their best advantage, with a fourfold increase in the use of the newer calcium antagonists and long acting trinitrate preparations. Many patients still suffered from angina, which was severely affecting their daily lives, but only 41 patients had had exercise electrocardiograms recorded or more detailed investigations; this includes 16 (6%) patients who had had coronary artery bypass surgery.", 
    "47": "To assess potential cardiac effects of nifedipine and beta-blocker interactions, 10 men receiving chronic beta-blocker therapy for angina underwent hemodynamic, electrophysiologic and left ventricular (LV) functional analyses at the time of cardiac catheterization before and after buccal administration of 10 mg of nifedipine. Although this combination is usually well tolerated, there have been occasional reports suggesting that the combination of nifedipine and beta-blocking agents may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension or exacerbation of angina. All patients had class II or III stable angina pectoris and were receiving at least 160 to 240 mg/day of propranolol or equivalent doses of beta-blocker therapy. Nifedipine produced no acute electrophysiologic changes, including heart rate, PR interval, AH interval, HV interval, sinus node recovery time or heart rate at which atrioventricular nodal block occurred. Hemodynamic effects included no significant change in mean right atrial pressure (7 +/- 1 vs 5 +/- 1 mm Hg), while mean pulmonary artery pressure decreased significantly (20 +/- 2 vs 17 +/- 1 mm Hg, p less than or equal to 0.05). In addition, LV end-diastolic pressure decreased significantly from 16 +/- 2 to 10 +/- 1 mm Hg (p less than or equal to 0.05), with a nonsignificant decrease in mean aortic pressure from 93 +/- 5 to 86 +/- 4 mm Hg. Likewise, no significant change occurred in cardiac index (3.2 +/- 0.4 vs 3.0 +/- 0.4 liters/min/m2) or systemic vascular resistance (1,157 +/- 247 vs 1,170 +/- 236 dynes/s/cm-5).

    "48": "The acute intravenous (IV) (0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 microgram/kg/min over 10 minutes each) and chronic oral (60 mg/day) administration of nifedipine was examined in 9 patients with significantly impaired left ventricular (LV) function (ejection fraction [EF] on radionuclide scanning was 0.20 to 0.40) who were already receiving beta-blocker therapy (greater than 25% reduction in peak exercise heart rate) with atenolol, 100 to 200 mg/day. The mean control LV end-diastolic pressure (EDP) at cardiac catheterization and EF for the group as a whole were 30 +/- 3 mm Hg (range 20 to 42) (mean +/- standard error of the mean) and 28.5 +/- 2.4%, respectively. Three of the 9 patients had hemodynamic deterioration and LV failure at some stage during the study, and their mean LVEDP and EF were 38 +/- 3 mm Hg (range 33 to 42) and 22.6 +/- 2.7%, respectively. In the 6 patients who tolerated the full treatment protocol, the mean LVEDP and EF were 26.5 +/- 2.0 mm Hg (range 20 to 35) and 31.5 +/- 2.8%, respectively. Seven patients received IV nifedipine, which had a negative inotropic action but did not precipitate cardiac decompensation. Chronic oral administration of nifedipine in combination with atenolol precipitated LV failure only in those with the lowest EF and highest LVEDP; usually LV failure was present with atenolol alone. Extensive infarction, frequently complicated by LV failure at the time, LVEDP greater than 32 mm Hg and control resting EF less than 30% were associated with LV failure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "49": "Nifedipine is a potent coronary vasodilator in the resting state and an effective afterload-reducing agent. This study was undertaken because of the concern that the addition of nifedipine to beta-blocker therapy could produce serious untoward hemodynamic consequences. Although this combination is usually well tolerated, occasional reports suggest that the combination of nifedipine and beta-blocking agents may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension or exacerbation of angina. Further, there is a need to know if the addition of nifedipine to therapy with maximally tolerated doses of long-acting nitrates and beta blockers would provide further symptomatic relief without excessive adverse effects. Finally, the effect of adjunctive nifedipine on global left ventricular performance at rest and during exercise was examined. Sixteen patients, all of whom had 3 or more episodes per week of angina pectoris despite therapy with long-acting nitrates and beta blockers, were selected. Radionuclide ventriculography was performed at rest and during exercise; global ejection fractions (EFs) were determined by manually tracing the left ventricular end-diastolic perimeter with an electronic cursor. In the first phase, beta blockers and nitrates were used; in the second phase nifedipine, 10 mg every 6 hours, was added and titrated to reduce systolic blood pressure at rest by at least 10 mm Hg or until intolerable adverse effects occurred. When nifedipine was added to therapy, the difference between global EF at rest and during exercise was reduced from - 0.15 to + 0.02 (p less than 0.00001); exercise duration was increased from 431 seconds to 532 (p less than 0.001), with only 8 patients limited by angina, compared with 16 during the initial therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "50": "Two adenylate cyclase inhibitors: 9-(tetrahydro-2-furyl)adenine and 2'5'-dideoxyadenosine decreased cAMP levels in LH-stimulated immature rat Leydig cells by 20-40%, independent of the concentration of LH. Steroid production was not correlated with this decrease in cAMP, but was increased (146%). The phorbol ester 4 beta-phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate stimulated steroidogenesis and the phosphorylation of a 17 kD and a 33 kD protein, which was also stimulated by LH, whereas the inactive phorbol ester 4 beta-phorbol-12,13-diacetate did not have any effects. Moreover, the Ca2+-channel blocker diltiazem inhibited LH effects, but had no direct effects on the cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme. It is concluded that cAMP may not be the only second messenger in LH action, and that other second messenger systems are probably also involved.", 
    "51": "In a prospective randomized double-masked crossover study in ten healthy volunteers, conducted to determine if the intraocular hypotensive effect of timolol eyedrops was significantly affected by the concomitant use of the topically administered prostaglandin inhibitor, indomethacin, we found that significant ocular hypotension was achieved with timolol alone. This was not changed by the concurrent administration of indomethacin. The results provide further evidence that prostaglandins are not involved in the control of normal intraocular pressure.", 
    "52": "To determine the efficacy of nifedipine combined with propranolol in the treatment of hypertension, 23 patients with essential hypertension uncontrolled while they were receiving propranolol, 120 mg/d, entered a dose response trial of four 8-week periods while continuing propranolol therapy. Therapy during the four periods consisted respectively of a placebo, 30 mg/d of nifedipine, 30 or 60 mg/d of nifedipine, and 30 or 60 mg/d of nifedipine along with only 60 mg/d of propranolol. Studies of forearm blood flow and venous compliance were carried out in nine of the patients. Ten patients dropped out after the first period. The mean blood pressures while the patients were recumbent after the first, second and third periods were 163 +/- 17/100 +/- 6, 147 +/- 13/89 +/- 10 and 141 +/- 19/84 +/- 10 mm Hg respectively. There was no evidence of tolerance in the four patients who received 30 mg/d of nifedipine during the third period. There was a significant dose-diastolic pressure response (p less than 0.0006) without a change in heart rate in the eight who received 60 mg/d of nifedipine during this period. After 16 weeks of therapy with nifedipine 11 patients had a diastolic pressure less than 90 mm Hg while recumbent. While mean blood pressure and heart rate for the group were not significantly increased at the end of the fourth period, in three of the patients the diastolic pressure while recumbent increased to over 90 mm Hg. This suggests that 120 mg/d of propranolol is the minimum dose required for concomitant therapy. Adverse symptoms were mild and transient. Forearm plethysmography showed that nifedipine induced arteriolar but not venous dilation and that propranolol attenuated the vasodilator effect of nifedipine. The author concludes that nifedipine was safe and effective in combination with propranolol in this group of patients with essential hypertension.", 
    "53": "The intradermal injection in rat skin of washed, thrombin-activated platelets produces an increase in vascular permeability, the intensity of which increments with the platelet concentration. Pretreatment of the recipient animals with serotonergic antagonists, including the specific 5-HT2 receptor blocker ketanserin, potently inhibits the platelet-mediated and the 5-HT-induced vascular defect. Amine depletion of platelets or skin tissues with reserpine reduces the response to platelets. Platelet prostanoid and lipoxygenase derivatives play no major role in the vascular response to platelet. The permeability increase induced by exogenous 5-HT and by activated platelets is reduced by alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation with noradrenaline or phenylephrine and by beta 2-stimulation with terbutaline or isoprenaline, and is potentiated by adenosine; this points to a modulation of permeability by blood flow changes and to a direct beta-adrenergic effect at the endothelial cell membrane. This study demonstrates a predominant role for 5-HT in the platelet-mediated vascular permeability increase in a sensitive species like the rat.", 
    "54": "18 students of human medicine were checked during their state examinations when they were or were not administered the beta-receptor blocker Propranolol. In the present examinations under psychic stress Propranolol has no ascertaining influence on the experience parameters, but on somatic reactions in the cardio-circulatory system, the haematological system as well as in the influence on a series of laboratory-chemical parameters. While slighter heart rate, lower blood pressure, a slighter decrease of the absolute number of lymphocytes and a lower plasma cortisol level refer to less distinct reactions of demand under influence of Propranolol, in the region of the lipid parameters HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol changes develop in the sense of an at least situational increased atherogenic risk.", 
    "55": "A series of six beta-adrenergic blocking drugs including propranolol, bufetolol, bunitrolol, pindolol, labetalol and acebutolol were examined for effects on adenylate cyclase, guanylate cyclase and calmodulin-dependent phosphodiesterase from heart. The adrenergic blocking agents had no apparent effects on basal activities of adenylate cyclase, guanylate cyclase and phosphodiesterase. The drugs blocked the enhancement of adenylate cyclase activity by isoproterenol, but not by guanine nucleotide or fluoride. The inhibitory effects of beta-antagonists were overcome by sufficiently large doses of isoproterenol. Sodium azide specifically required catalase whereas NaNO2 required cysteine to activate myocardial guanylate cyclase. Among beta-adrenergic blocking drugs tested, both pindolol and acebutolol inhibited the stimulation of guanylate cyclase by NaNo2 or N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). However, other beta-blocking drugs did not significantly affect the activation by NaN3, NaNO2 and MNNG. Several beta-antagonists, such as labetalol, bunitrolol, pindolol and acebutolol were also effective in blocking the activation of phosphodiesterase by calmodulin. The inhibitory effects of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs, i.e. pindolol and acebutolol upon either nitroso compound-stimulated guanylate cyclase or calmodulin-activated phosphodiesterase display little correlation with their potency as beta-adrenergic blocking agents. These data suggest that beta-antagonists may have another site of action which is not directly related to the control of catecholamine metabolism.", 
    "56": "Incubation of turkey erythrocyte and rat lung membranes with the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol in the presence of the group specific reagent N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) causes the apparent inactivation of a well defined fraction of the beta-adrenergic receptors. This inactivation process requires the coupling between the receptors and the guanine nucleotide binding regulatory component of the adenylate cyclase system. Accordingly, only the isoproterenol/NEM sensitive receptor population is susceptible to undergo this functional coupling. Incubation of the treated membranes in alkaline buffer and/or in the presence of GTP reactivates the receptors. The reactivated receptors show the initial binding properties for both isoproterenol and the radiolabelled antagonist [3H]-dihydroalprenolol and are still dithiothreitol sensitive. Moreover the reactivated receptors can again couple to the regulator in the presence of agonists. The present study makes it possible to discriminate between the different models advanced for the N-ethylmaleimide action and is valid for beta 1- as well as beta 2-adrenergic receptors. The reagent appears indeed to freeze the hormone-receptor-regulator complex by alkylating the latter component, as previously proposed by Korner et al. (1982) J. biol. Chem. 257, 3389-3396. It is also suggested that the existence of a limited fraction of coupling-prone receptors results from differences in the membrane microenvironment or from a structural heterogeneity of the receptors rather than from a stoichiometric limitation of the regulator concentration.", 
    "57": "In the nucleus dorsomedialis hypothalami (NDM), it has so far been possible to visualize serotonin (5-HT) neurons by 5-HT immunohistochemistry only after inhibition of the monoamine oxidase and loading with tryptophan. We report here that the intraventricular administration of dopamine, noradrenaline (NA) and adrenaline as well as isoproterenol and, to a lesser extent, apomorphine, similarly permitted 5-HT immunostaining of these neurons in pargyline-pretreated rats, and that additional pretreatment with propranolol prevented the NA-induced effect. Hence, it is proposed that the 5-HT content in the presumed serotoninergic neurons of the NDM could be under dopaminergic and/or beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated catecholaminergic influence."
