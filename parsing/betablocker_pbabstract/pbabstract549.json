    "0": "Evidence for the existence of factor(s) other than blood pressure responsible for modulation of myocardial hypertrophy accompanying hypertension is well documented. A factor that has been isolated from the myocardium of the spontaneously hypertensive rat and partially purified has been shown to stimulate protein synthesis in vitro. Three indexes of protein synthesis, namely incorporation of 3H-leucine into myocyte myosin, specific activity of the leucyl tRNA, and rate of protein synthesis, also were observed to significantly increase on exposure to this factor, which may play a key role in the modulation of myocardial hypertrophy that accompanies hypertension. Evidence has also been presented demonstrating the role of unknown factors that control the shift of myosin isozymes from V1 (a high-ATPase, high-contractile protein type) to V3 (a slow ATPase type myosin), and vice versa. This study demonstrates that the modulation of the myocardial mass can be controlled at different levels: first at an intrinsic intracellular level by the mechanism of a local growth factor, and then at the level of the contractile protein, the quality rather than quantity of which was found to be important. Both of these were observed to be modulated by factor(s) independent of blood pressure and myocardial mass. However, it remains to be determined what is responsible at the genetic level for transmitting the signal that selects what type of protein will be synthesized and whether there is a common pathway among all the controlling factors.", 
    "1": "The use of diuretic drugs, which previously has been found to be associated with the incidence of cataract, is further investigated to elucidate the nature of the association. Diuretic drugs with different modes of action are considered separately. The degree of association of each correlates with the mean plasma urea level which itself is associated with cataract. However, the association is with cataract in general rather than with any specific type of lens opacity.", 
    "2": "We evaluated the effect of betaxolol on the pulmonary function tests of nine patients with glaucoma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) requiring beta-blocker therapy. The results of pre-treatment pulmonary function tests were compared to results after two weeks of betaxolol therapy. The mean ratio of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV-1) to forced vital capacity (FVC) was 59.33 +/- 13.30%. After two weeks of betaxolol therapy, the resulting mean FEV-1/FVC was 57.89 +/- 13.89%, a statistically insignificant difference (P greater than 0.05). The mean FEV-1 was 1.94 +/- 0.83 liters, compared to 1.91 +/- 0.78 liters after two weeks of betaxolol. The mean FVC was 3.19 +/- 0.91 liters, compared to 3.23 +/- 0.89 liters after two weeks of betaxolol. These differences were, also, not statistically significant (P greater than 0.05). This prospective study supports previous reports suggesting that betaxolol has potential advantages for those patients at risk for developing pulmonary side effects from beta-blocker therapy. This report represents the largest single-center series of patients who have been studied in this fashion.", 
    "3": "Changes in intraocular pressure (IOP) following topical administration of falintolol (0.5%-0.25%), a new beta-blocking agent, were studied in conscious albino rabbits with alpha-chymotrypsin-induced ocular hypertension. The drug produced a reduction in IOP equal to that of timolol. A longer duration of activity was noted with falintolol. The rate of transport of topically applied falintolol through the isolated bovine cornea under conditions simulating normal physiology was linear up to three hours and twice as fast as timolol from 3 to 6 hours. Since topical ocular application of beta-adrenergic antagonists useful in glaucoma therapy can also cause a number of troublesome systemic side effects, several conclusive preclinical investigations were carried out with falintolol. Of major concern was the effect falintolol might have on the pupil, cornea, and heart rate when administered topically. The results show that falintolol does not produce any noteworthy side effects and is capable of being an effective beta-blocking agent in open-angle glaucoma therapy.", 
    "4": "Celiprolol (5%) was compared to timolol (0.5%) and placebo in patients with primary open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. A total of 28 patients participated in this double blind study and received treatment for two weeks. Intraocular pressure decreased an average of 4.4 mmHg with celiprolol and 7.1 mmHg with timolol two hours after instillation. This was maintained 12 hours after administration of timolol but not after celiprolol. There was a small but statistically significant decrease in pulse rate 2 hours after administration of timolol (from 72 to 64 beats per minute) which was not observed after celiprolol. Side effects were mild and similar for all 3 groups.", 
    "5": "The ocular beta-adrenoceptor antagonist activity of dihydrolevobunolol (DHLB), the major ocular and systemic metabolite of levobunolol was investigated by determining its ability to block isoproterenol-induced ocular hypotension in normotensive rabbits. Topically-applied 0.001% and 0.01% DHLB virtually abolished the response to isoproterenol, indicating a beta-blocking potency similar to that of timolol. Thus, the ocular metabolism of levobunolol leads to the formation of a highly potent beta-adrenoceptor antagonist that may contribute to its clinical efficacy.", 
    "6": "The isometric developed tension (IDT) and the pharmacological response of isolated myocardium from T. cruzi infected Albino Swiss mice in the acute and chronic Chagas' disease, were studied. The animals were infected with 7 X 10(4) trypomastigotes, form of T. cruzi, Tulahuen strain for the acute infection and with 45 parasites for the chronic stage. The isolated myocardium from acute and chronic chagasic mice reached IDT levels similar to normal hearts. The addition of norepinephrine (NE) to acute ventricles led to lower IDT values than in control group; this hyporeactivity to NE was absent in the chronic stage. On the other hand, epinephrine (EPI) effects on acute and chronic ventricles lead to significantly higher IDT values when compared with their controls. Propranolol blocked the higher effect of EPI in isolated myocardium from the acute stage, but the hyperreactivity described in the chronic stage could not be inhibited by the beta receptors antagonist. The agonist and antagonist tested act on cardiac plasma membrane beta receptors and their actions modify transmembrane calcium fluxes, so that the present study shows that Chagas' disease modifies the normal behavior of adrenergic beta cardiac receptors in different degree depending on the stage of the trypanosomiasis.", 
    "7": "A previous study has demonstrated that timolol maleate (0.5%), a non-selective beta-adrenergic antagonist, produces in emmetropes a significant reduction in accommodative convergence (AC) during the initial four minutes of a near-vision task. The present study has examined the effect of timolol on AC for three refractive groups (each comprising N = 20): emmetropes, early-onset myopes (EOMs), i.e. myopia onset prior to 15 years of age and late-onset myopes (LOMs), i.e. myopia onset after 15 years. A double-blind protocol was adopted between timolol and a saline control. AC was derived from accommodation stimuli of 3.3, 4.1 and 4.8 D with changes in heterophoria being assessed using a Maddox rod and tangent scale. The relationship between the ocular hypotensive effect of timolol and anterior corneal curvature was also investigated using a Goldmann applanation tonometer and a two-position keratometer (Haag-Streit). Timolol produced a significant reduction in AC in emmetropes but did not induce significant changes in AC in LOMs or EOMs. The timolol-induced reduction in IOP did not result in any changes in anterior corneal curvature.", 
    "8": "The synthesis of a series of oxypropanolamines of 3,4-dihydro-3-oxo-2H(1,4)benzothiazine is reported. Some of these compounds proved more potent than propranolol and carteolol as beta-adrenergic blocking agents in in vitro tests. The 8-(3-tert-butylamino-2-hydroxy)propoxy-3,4-dihydro-3-oxo-2H(1,4) benzothiazine fumarate (XVI a), which gave better results, confirmed its remarkable activity in in vivo tests.", 
    "9": "The effect of repeated footshock on the sensitivity of the isolated rat pacemaker to the chronotropic effect of catecholamines was studied. Footshock stress caused subsensitivity to noradrenaline and supersensitivity to isoprenaline. The subsensitivity to the neurotransmitter was abolished by cocaine, whereas supersensitivity to isoprenaline was unchanged after blockade of the extraneuronal uptake. The pA2 value of metoprolol was increased by repeated footshock. Butoxamine reversed the supersensitivity to isoprenaline and the alteration of the pA2 value. Repeated footshock stress appears to cause prejunctional subsensitivity to noradrenaline and to increase the function of postjunctional beta 2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "10": "It was found that phenylephrine and methoxamine had two effects (one was inhibitory and the other was augmentative) on isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic AMP in rat parotid slices. The augmentation was abolished by alpha-adrenergic antagonists or by omission of calcium in the medium. Cyclic AMP accumulation by norepinephrine (NE) was significantly decreased by omission of calcium in the medium. Calmodulin antagonists, trifluoperazine and W-7, decreased NE-induced cyclic AMP accumulation, but another calmodulin antagonist, carmidazolium, did not. Phorbol ester such as 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate, 13-acetate and phorbol 12, 13-dibutyrate, did not augment the effect of isoproterenol. These results suggest that although the influx of calcium is required in the alpha-adrenergic agonists-induced augmentation, calmodulin and protein kinase C may not be intermediates in this process. Calcium ions (10(-7) and 10(-6) M) slightly increased the activity of adenylate cyclase, but calcium (10(-6)-10(-4) M) dose-dependently inhibited the effect of isoproterenol. Therefore, calcium ions do not participate in the augmentation by directly modulating the activity of adenylate cyclase. The inhibitory effect was not affected by alpha-adrenergic antagonists. The activation of adenylate cyclase by isoproterenol was inhibited by phenylephrine with higher inhibition being obtained in lower concentrations of isoproterenol. Phenylephrine in the presence of isobutylmethylxanthine increased the amount of cyclic AMP and this effect was inhibited by propranolol, but not by phentolamine. [3H]-CGP 12177 binding of the parotid membrane was inhibited by alpha-adrenergic antagonists. These results suggest that the inhibitory effect of phenylephrine and methoxamine may be mediated by beta-adrenergic receptor.", 
    "11": "The artificial coronary artery occlusion results immediately in ST-segment elevation (ST-E), therefore the ST-E in acute myocardial infarction is considered to be the result of acute coronary occlusion. But in the early phase of myocardial infarction a significant correlation between ST-E and occlusion of the coronary artery does not exist. The early ST-E seems to be predominantly the consequence of sympathico-adrenergic induced metabolic processes in the ischemic myocardium. The beta receptor blockade during the first 90 minutes after the onset of infarction decreased the ST-E by 73 +/- 6% within one hour. Treatment with beta receptor blockers in the acute phase in all patients with first anterior wall infarcts accompanied with ST-E leads to a favorable prognosis. Early ST-E can therefore be considered as a sign of sympathico-adrenergic induced changes in myocardial metabolism. Thus the beta receptor blockade in the acute phase (of anterior wall infarctions) seems to be therapeutically indicated.", 
    "12": "Recently it has been demonstrated that blood pressure in the elderly decreases after a meal. To evaluate the influence of antihypertensive treatment on postprandial blood pressure reduction in the elderly, the effects of a breakfast (405 kcal) on blood pressure and heart rate were studied in 15 healthy normotensive elderly subjects (mean age 79.5 +/- 6.0 years), in 10 healthy hypertensive elderly subjects (mean age 80.2 +/- 5.7 years) and in 22 hypertensive elderly subjects (mean age 71.4 +/- 5.0 years) treated with antihypertensive medication (diuretics, beta-blockers, vasodilators). In the three groups there was a fall of mean arterial blood pressure of 9.3 +/- 1.9%, 13.8 +/- 1.9% and 7.9 +/- 1.3%, respectively, at 40 min after the start of the breakfast. In all three groups heart rate increased significantly. It is concluded that antihypertensive treatment with the regimens used in this study does not induce an additional fall of blood pressure postprandially. However, the influence of eating should be avoided in the assessment of antihypertensive drug effects in the elderly.", 
    "13": "Epanolol is a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with partial agonist activity, a property which could be useful in reducing the fatigue associated with beta blockers. In a double-blind, randomized, crossover study we have investigated the effects of metoprolol 100 mg b.d., epanolol 100 mg b.d., and epanolol 200 mg b.d. on blood pressure, heart rate, and exercise-induced fatigue in 10 hypertensive men. Fatigue was measured subjectively by the Borg rating scale and objectively by blood lactate concentrations. Resting and exercise heart rates were lower with metoprolol than with either dose of epanolol. Preexercise standing diastolic blood pressure was lowered by metoprolol, but there were no other treatment effects on blood pressure. Exercise-induced fatigue was not altered by any treatment, whether measured subjectively or objectively. These results do not support the hypothesis that partial agonist activity improves exercise tolerance in hypertensive patients treated with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists.", 
    "14": "In a double-blind study, 128 patients with essential hypertension, refractory to beta-blocker monotherapy, were randomised to 1 of 4 treatment groups. Felodipine 2.5 mg twice daily, 5mg twice daily, 10mg twice daily or matched placebo twice daily were administered in addition to the beta-blocker for 4 weeks. Mean supine blood pressure before randomisation to treatment was 167/104 +/- 20/7mm Hg. After 4 weeks of treatment, supine blood pressures 2 hours after dose were 161/98 +/- 20/10mm Hg (P), 152/92 +/- 23/8mm Hg (felodipine 2.5mg), 142/87 +/- 18/7mm Hg (felodipine 5mg) and 142/86 +/- 17/7mm Hg (felodipine 10mg). The falls in systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly greater for all 3 felodipine groups than for placebo. Blood pressure reductions were less marked 14 hours after dosage: 161/100 +/- 20/9mm Hg (P), 160/97 +/- 24/9mm Hg (felodipine 2.5mg), 153/97 +/- 21/11mm Hg (felodipine 5mg), and 157/94 +/- 19/9mm Hg (felodipine 10mg); but the two higher doses of felodipine produced a significantly greater sustained fall in blood pressure than placebo. There was a correlation between the dose of felodipine and its antihypertensive effect. Standing blood pressures were reduced to the same extent as supine measurements. Heart rate was not significantly affected. Bodyweight did not increase during the study. Side effects of felodipine therapy were minor, and mostly attributable to the vasodilatory properties of the drug. Only 4 patients withdrew because of side effects. It is concluded that felodipine is an effective and well tolerated antihypertensive drug, and that 5mg twice daily is a suitable starting dose in hypertensive patients refractory to beta-blocker monotherapy. It may be necessary to increase this dose to 10mg twice daily in selected patients.", 
    "15": "A study was carried out of 22 patients with essential hypertension who were treated with metoprolol (100 mg/day) and placebo for 4 weeks. Felodipine (n = 11) or prazosin (n = 11) were then added in increasing doses (felodipine 5, 10, 20 mg bid; prazosin 1, 2, 4 mg bid) for 2 weeks until a diastolic blood pressure of less than or equal to 90 mm Hg was achieved. Acute haemodynamic and hormonal responses to 80 degrees tilting (measurements after 4 minutes' tilt) were obtained immediately prior to randomisation to felodipine or prazosin, and after 6 to 8 weeks of treatment. At randomisation, 80 degrees tilt produced no change in blood pressure and only a small increase in pulse rate. There was no significant change in the plasma renin-angiotensin system, vasopressin or adrenaline concentrations. Plasma noradrenaline concentration rose in response to 80 degrees tilt. Following substitution of felodipine (n = 11) or prazosin (n = 11) for placebo, and continuation of metoprolol, blood pressure fell. 80 degrees tilt caused no change in the plasma renin-angiotensin system, vasopressin or adrenaline concentration. Plasma noradrenaline concentration rose in response to tilt, as before. Felodipine is an effective antihypertensive agent when used with metoprolol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "16": "Felodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist which has a positive inotropic effect in the dog in vivo. However to date, no inotropic effects have been described in man. Thus, the solvent for the intravenous administration of the drug was infused, followed by the active solution, in 9 beta-blocked patients undergoing coronary angiography; heart rate was held constant by atrial pacing. Haemodynamic variables were measured with the Mills combined left ventricular catheter-tip manometer and aortic electromagnetic blood velocity transducer. In all patients, peripheral vasodilatation was observed. In 8 patients, this was accompanied by a 9 to 50% increase in maximum rate of rise of left ventricular pressure indicating a small positive inotropic effect.", 
    "17": "The acute antihypertensive effects of the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, felodipine, were investigated in 12 male patients aged 43 to 64 years with uncontrolled blood pressure on combined treatment with a thiazide diuretic, a beta-blocker and hydralazine. Central and renal haemodynamics were monitored after acute oral administration (0.075 mg/kg) of felodipine in combination with the beta-blocker and diuretic. Six patients were continued on long term oral felodipine (mean dose 20 +/- 24 mg/day) in combination with the other drugs for 6 to 18 months. Ambulatory blood pressure was measured repeatedly and renal function re-examined once during long term felodipine therapy. In the 6 patients on long term therapy, systolic blood pressure was reduced from 190 +/- 17 to 149 +/- 24 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure from 116 +/- 12 to 89 +/- 14mm Hg (p less than 0.001). No significant change in heart rate was observed (65 +/- 4 vs 62 +/- 10 beats/min). Renal plasma flow significantly increased from 284 +/- 97 to 425 +/- 131 ml/min/m2 (p less than 0.01) but glomerular filtration rate was unchanged (72 +/- 20 vs 80 +/- 22 ml/min/m2). Hence, the filtration fraction was significantly reduced and normalised in all patients (0.26 +/- 0.04 vs 0.20 +/- 0.03) [p less than 0.05]. Bodyweight was unchanged. It is concluded that felodipine is a highly potent vasodilator with a favourable effect on renal function and is suitable for long term therapy in patients with severe primary hypertension.", 
    "18": "The efficacy and tolerability of felodipine and prazosin were compared in a double-blind randomised parallel group study of 100 patients with moderately severe essential hypertension, treated concomitantly with a beta-blocking drug. After a 2- to 8-week run in phase (beta-blocking drug plus placebo), patients with a diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 95mm Hg were randomly given felodipine (n = 50) or prazosin (n = 50). After an initial dose of either felodipine 2.5mg bid or prazosin 0.5mg bid for 3 days, the drugs were titrated at 2-week intervals (felodipine 5, 10, 20mg bid, prazosin 1, 2, 4mg bid) if the supine diastolic blood pressure was greater than or equal to 90mm Hg. Treatment was continued for 8 weeks. Baseline supine blood pressures of each group were similar (177/104mm Hg, felodipine; 176/103mm Hg, prazosin). At week 6, supine blood pressures in the felodipine group were 144/82mm Hg and 161/90 in the prazosin group. The reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly greater for the felodipine group than the prazosin group in both the supine and standing positions at all visits after baseline. At 8 weeks, supine diastolic blood pressure less than 90mm Hg was achieved in more patients in the felodipine (36/47) than in the prazosin group (20/43, p less than 0.01). The total number of adverse reactions was similar in both groups. During active therapy, a greater number of patients experienced vascular adverse reactions (oedema and flushing) with felodipine (23) than with prazosin (12). Most events were mild and did not necessitate withdrawal from therapy. There were no clinically significant changes in laboratory variables in either treatment group. Felodipine was an effective, well tolerated hypotensive agent when used concomitantly with a beta-blocking drug. In the doses used it was more effective than prazosin at reducing blood pressure.", 
    "19": "A carbohydrate disturbance or diabetogenic effect may occur even in people with normal metabolism as an undesired side effect with a great number of drugs. According to present nomenclature a distinction should be made between a \"decrease of glucose tolerance\" and the appearance of a (manifest) \"diabetes mellitus.\" Instead the term \"borderline diabetes\" is often used in American literature. Particularly with already existing glucose tolerance disturbances, or hereditary disposition, a further deterioration can lead to diabetes mellitus that may not always disappear after discontinued use of the drug. In this context, the glucocorticoids, the saluretics and the oral contraceptives have special clinical interest. In a table are listed several drugs having a minor, or only sporadically observed, or questionably unfavorable influence on glucose tolerance. Some contain diabetogenic toxins and chemical substances that are used for experimental diabetes inducement (in animals). Extensive literature concerning the influence of female sexual hormones or oral contraceptives on the carbohydrate metabolism seems contradictory. Several mechanisms are discussed: peripheral insulin resistance, increased secretion of growth hormones and insulin, increased peripheral insulin decomposition, and inhibition of glucose decomposition via the pentose-phosphatic shunt. Glucose tolerance disturbances caused by oral contraceptives are described by some authors as occurring in 25% to 75% of all cases. Other authors found no or only rarely such an effect. The composition of the test group, the kind of ovulatory inhibitor, and the length of usage period evidently play a great role. Earlier, the estrogens, especially for higher dosages, were attributed a diabetogenic effect. However, lately the gestagens have come more to the fore. After many years of pill usage, a greater incidence of pathological glucose tolerance was registered for combination than for sequential preparations. It would appear that for (younger) diabetics (without late complications) that the most suitable contraceptive should consist of a sequential preparation with a low estrogen admixture (below 50 mg). Which gestagen and which dosage would result in the smallest long-term effect on glucose tolerance remains to be clarified.", 
    "20": "The effects of nipradilol, a new beta-blocking agent with vasodilating properties, on exercise tolerance were examined in eight patients with stable effort angina. Symptom-limited treadmill tests were performed two hours after administration of oral nipradilol (9 mg) or placebo in a double-blind manner. Exercise time to the onset of angina was significantly longer after nipradilol than after placebo (6.8 +/- 2.5 min versus 5.0 +/- 1.2 min, P less than 0.05). Exercise duration after nipradilol was not statistically different from that after 0.3 mg of sublingual nitroglycerin (7.2 +/- 1.9 min). Nipradilol significantly decreased heart rate both at rest and during exercise (P less than 0.01). Systolic blood pressure at rest did not change after nipradilol. However, an increase in systolic blood pressure during exercise was inhibited by nipradilol. The pressure rate product was significantly lower after nipradilol than after placebo. It is concluded that nipradilol improves exercise tolerance in patients with stable effort angina by decreasing the myocardial oxygen consumption during exercise.", 
    "21": "Twenty-four patients with bilateral chronic open-angle glaucoma received three treatments: (1) artificial tears (control) in both eyes, (2) artificial tears in one eye and one drop of timolol (0.05%) in the other, and (3) artificial tears in one eye and one drop of betaxolol (0.05%) in the other. Twelve patients always received the test medication in the left eye and 12 in the right eye. The patients were examined and questioned about ocular symptoms at the time of drug administration and at 1, 5, 30, and 60 minutes. Irritation was noted in five treated eyes after artificial tears, in three after timolol, and in 11 after betaxolol. The incidence of irritation after initial treatment was significantly lower than expected for timolol than for artificial tears or betaxolol (P less than 0.01).", 
    "22": "1. Hypertension is associated with a distension of the large arteries and consequently a marked reduction in arterial compliance, which does not result merely from the mechanical effects of elevated arterial pressure but also from early functional and/or structural changes in the arterial walls. This suggests that one of the aims of antihypertensive therapy should be to reverse these arterial abnormalities in the hope of protecting the patient from the atherosclerotic complications of hypertension. 2. Studies have been carried out to compare the effects of equieffective antihypertensive doses of pindolol and propranolol on the arterial circulation in patients suffering from essential hypertension. After 3 months therapy pindolol produced a dilatation of the brachial artery with an increase in arterial compliance and blood flow. In contrast, propranolol, despite comparable antihypertensive effects, did not influence brachial artery circulation. 3. These different effects on the arterial circulation presumably reflect the differing pharmacological properties of the two beta-adrenoceptor antagonists and suggest that the intrinsic sympathomimetic activity of pindolol may be responsible for the qualitative differences in the arterial responses to the two drugs. 4. The results reviewed here reveal that even when two drugs of the same class are used to treat patients with essential hypertension the effects of these agents on arterial haemodynamics can vary greatly and are unrelated to the degree of blood pressure lowering. Thus, pindolol, in contrast to propranolol, not only lowers blood pressure but also reverses some of the changes in arterial haemodynamics which are characteristic of hypertensive disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "23": "1. beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) are characterized by lesser depression of cardiac performance during low levels of sympathetic stimulation than beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents lacking ISA. Studies of the effects of ISA on cardiac output and on the determinants of myocardial oxygen demand during submaximal exercise are described and distinct differences between beta-adrenoceptor antagonists with and without ISA emerge. 2. At doses which produce similar effects on maximal exercise heart rate, and resting and exercise systolic blood pressure, pindolol, a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent with substantial ISA, allows a higher submaximal exercise cardiac output and submaximal heart rate X systolic blood pressure product than does propranolol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist without ISA. 3. These findings may have clinical relevance in specific groups of patients such as those with arterial hypertension, where the preservation of cardiac function may allow for a more physiologic exercise response. Implications in patients with coronary artery disease and chronic heart failure await further study.", 
    "24": "1. Pindolol is a beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug with ISA (also called partial agonist activity). This means that in addition to blocking the effects of beta-adrenoceptor agonists, it produces some stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors. 2. In vitro studies with pindolol show that its maximum stimulant action is similar to that of isoprenaline in tissues possessing mainly beta 2-adrenoceptors, but is negligible in tissues possessing mainly beta 1-adrenoceptors. This suggests selective stimulation of beta 2-adrenoceptors. 3. In man the arteriodilator effects observed after intra-arterially infused pindolol at concentrations within the same range as those producing an antihypertensive effect also suggest a stimulant action on vascular beta 2-adrenoceptors. 4. The fact that pindolol prevents the reduction of resting heart rate and cardiac output observed after drugs lacking ISA at first sight suggests stimulation of cardiac beta 1-adrenoceptors. However, human atria possess not only beta 1- but also beta 2-adrenoceptors, stimulation of which would produce the same effect. 5. Although all beta-adrenoceptor antagonists lower blood pressure, recent experiments have shown that those agents with combined beta 1-adrenoceptor blocking activity and ISA at those receptors are less effective. This observation lends weight to the thesis that pindolol does not stimulate beta 1-adrenoceptors since it lowers blood pressure as effectively as drugs lacking ISA. 6. The evidence available therefore suggests that although pindolol blocks both beta 1- and beta 2-subtypes, it selectively stimulates beta 2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "25": "1. Sloths are very responsive to epinephrine and norepinephrine; i.v. injection of 1 microgram/kg elevates systolic pressure 80 and 90% respectively. 2. Doses as low as 0.01 microgram/kg of epinephrine as well as norepinephrine raise diastolic pressure. 3. Similarity of effects of these catecholamines can be explained on the basis of the low proportion of skeletal muscle (35 vs 45% in most mammals) and a small liver which reduces the proportion of beta 2 dilators to alpha constrictors responding to epinephrine. 4. Slowness of reflexes allows clear separation of early (0-20 sec), direct accelerating heart rate effect (up 15% with 1 microgram/kg of norepinephrine) and later (20-60 sec), reflex bradycardia (down 30% from control level). 5. Sloths are more sensitive to the vasodilating effects of isoproterenol or less sensitive to beta 1 cardiac stimulating effects than most laboratory mammals; doses as low as 0.1 microgram/kg cause a fall in mean arterial pressure not overcome by increased heart rate.", 
    "26": "Neural and humoral mechanisms involved in the reflex pressor response during mechanical stimulation of the stomach of rats were investigated. The arterial blood pressure response was prevented by inhibition of alpha-adrenergic vasoconstriction using either an alpha-adrenergic blocker or a ganglionic blocker. In addition, there was a small decrease in the response after nephrectomy. However, there were no alterations in the response after beta-adrenergic blockade, bilateral adrenalectomy, inhibition of converting enzyme activity with enalapril or bilateral cervical vagus nerve transection. The heart rate was not modified after either intervention. After vagotomy the time of recovery of the basal blood pressure was significantly prolonged. It can be concluded that the blood pressure response to mechanical stimulation of the stomach wall is of neural rather than of humoral origin and mainly involves activation of alpha-adrenergic receptors. Vagal efferent pathways could be also involved.", 
    "27": "Systemic effects of two topical B adrenergic blocking agents, carteolol and metipranolol, recently introduced in the treatment of open angle chronic glaucoma, were investigated in two groups of 10 asthmatic patients, according to a controlled trial device. Saline eye drops as placebo, then, 30 mn later beta blocker eye-drops, were instillated at usual dose. Heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, vital capacity (VC) and expiratory outflow (FEV1), were checked every 15 mn during 90 mn. They did not vary under placebo. After carteolol and metipranolol, heart rate decreased more than 10% in 7 out of 10 patients in each group (extreme individual changes: -16.7 and -25.0%). Bradycardia was always sino atrial. FEV1 was lowered in 3 patients with carteolol and in 6 with metipranolol (extreme individual values: -32.3 and -31.8%). If time is not taken in consideration, the lowest values were -8.6 +/-4.6% with carteolol and -17.9 +/- 3.3% with metipranolol. CV was reduced only in 1 patient under carteolol and 2 patients under metipranolol. Systemic blood pressure remained unchanged. 7 patients complained of ocular pain when metipranolol was instillated. Comparison of both ocular topics shows that metipranolol lowers heart rate and FEV1 more than carteolol, which has a sympathomimetic intrinsic activity. These two drugs have the same clinical efficiency. Our results point out the risks outcoming from their systemic diffusion, and the absolute necessity to comply with the general rules of good use of beta blockers, even with eye drops, mainly the contra-indications and the strict adjustment of individual doses.", 
    "28": "Spleen cells of mice and lymph node lymphocytes of rats were cultured with epinephrine, norepinephrine and alpha- and beta-adrenergic drugs to determine effects on lymphokine secretion. After an incubation of 4.5 h it was found that the naturally occurring catecholamines and adrenergic drugs (isoprenaline, orciprenaline, terbutaline, norfenephrine, phenylephrine, clonidine, dobutamine) could induce the secretion of charge-changing lymphokines and lymphokines that stimulate the migration of lymphocytes. The beta-blocker propranolol inhibited the lymphokine secretion evoked by epinephrine and by beta-adrenergic agonists, whereas the alpha-blocker phentolamine antagonized the effects elicited by alpha-adrenergic drugs. Phenylethylamine also induced a significant secretion of lymphokines. Two non-phenylethylamines had no effect. The stimulatory capacity of adrenergic agonists, the inhibitory activity of the appropriate antagonists and the comparison with two non-phenylethylamines support the hypothesis on specific influence of catecholamines on the lymphocyte function.", 
    "29": "1. Plasma lactate and pyruvate were increased more markedly in fed rats than in fasted rats exposed to an 8000 m altitude. 2. The increase in plasma lactate and pyruvate was enhanced and inhibited by the alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist prazosin and the beta-blocker propranolol, respectively, in fasted rats exposed to an 8000 m altitude. Blood glucose was not changed by adrenergic blockades under the same conditions. 3. Prazosin and propranolol showed no effect on glycolytic metabolites in plasma in fed rats submitted to an 8000 m altitude. Blood glucose of fed rats was increased by alpha 1-blockade during severe hypoxia. 4. In fasted rats whose energy metabolism depends on oxidation mainly, alpha 1- and beta-adrenergic receptors can participate in the stimulation of respiration and the glycogen degradation, respectively, during an exposure to severe hypoxia. In fed rats energy metabolism depends on glycolysis, which utilizes blood glucose as the substrate preferentially during hypoxia.", 
    "30": "Five hypertension intervention trials (HDFP, MRFIT, Australian National BP Study, IPPPSH, MRC) were analyzed for the effect of smoking on antihypertensive therapy and final outcome in coronary and all-cause mortality. In addition, an observational study of primary screenees for MRFIT was reviewed. Thus, the hypertensive population evaluated in this paper amounts to 135,851 patients. HDFP revealed that smokers had about twice the mortality rates compared to nonsmokers regardless of the treatment group to which they were randomized. The annual incidence of events in the Australian Study among nonsmokers in the placebo group was even lightly lower than in smokers under active therapy. The results of the MRFIT showed that smoking had a particularly deleterious impact on those hypertensives whose cholesterol levels were elevated. In this group, the coronary death rates were 10 times higher than in nonsmokers with lower cholesterol levels. Although the treatment with beta-blockers reduced the coronary event rates in the MRC and in IPPPSH, this beneficial effect was absent in smokers. However, in trials in which diuretic treatment is effective in nonsmokers, it is equally effective in smokers.", 
    "31": "In patients with uncomplicated mild to moderate hypertension, studies employing a double-blind randomized cross-over factorial design have been used to obtain more precise estimates of the hypotensive and biochemical effects of individual antihypertensive drugs and of their interactions when used in combination. Order and carry-over effects have been controlled. In studies with beta-blockers and diuretics, the hypotensive effects of the individual drugs have been confirmed and in combination their effects are additive. With the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril (20 mg daily) the hypotensive effect was additive with that of a diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg daily). When enalapril was combined with the beta-blocker atenolol (50 mg daily) there was little additional hypotensive effect, despite similar hypotensive effects of the individual agents separately. The mechanism of this attenuated effect is unclear. The design is suitable for evaluation of other antihypertensive combinations.", 
    "32": "In the present study the prescription patterns and cost of antihypertensive drugs in two outpatient clinics located in two different countries (Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland, and M\u00fcnster, FRG), were analyzed from 1975 till 1985 by using representative random samples of hypertensive outpatients. Throughout the observed period the leading positions were held by diuretics and beta-blockers, whereas central sympatholytics and ganglion blockers nearly disappeared. A rapid increase in the use of calcium antagonists occurred within the last 2 analyzed years. Drugs in fixed combination containing reserpin showed a constant decrease during the observed period, whereas beta-blocker-containing combination drugs increased in both clinics. The comparison between the two clinics revealed only minor differences in the prescription pattern of the various known classes of antihypertensive drugs. However, marked differences were observed within given classes between the preferred products. Both in Z\u00fcrich and M\u00fcnster the mean annual drug cost per patient doubled from 1975 to 1985. Especially during the last few years these changes took place with a remarkable rapidity, obviously the result of a more intense promotion of new antihypertensive drugs.", 
    "33": "A study on 26 patients with chronic angle glaucoma was completed after 17 weeks. The IOP was satisfactorily stabilized on patients treated with Metipranolol drops. In the Timolol group, the IOP rose again after the 9th week and, at the completion of the study, the difference between the averages of the two groups is significant. No systemic effect was noted as well in the Metipranolol group as in the Timolol group.", 
    "34": "A double blind randomised study was made to compare the efficiency in decreasing intra ocular pressure of Metipranolol 0.1% or 0.3% versus placebo in three groups of 15 patients with chronic open angle glaucoma with or without visual field defects. The results demonstrate that Metipranolol 0.1% significantly lowers the intra ocular pressure in comparison with placebo. But this lowering is less that the one with 0.3% and is markedly reduced after 9 hours. The action of Metipranolol 0.3% is more durable and is still observed at 24 hours with a drop of nearly 20% in comparison with the initial intra ocular pressure. In the three groups, no significant variation of pulse and arterial pressure could be noticed during this 24 hours study.", 
    "35": "The effects of 3 weeks of treatment with the beta-receptor blocking agent propranolol and a placebo on glucose tolerance, insulin secretion and peripheral insulin sensitivity have been evaluated in 7 normoglycaemic hypertensive patients by an oral glucose tolerance test and the insulin clamp technique. Significant changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were observed at the end of propranolol treatment, but there were no associated changes in glucose tolerance, insulin secretion or peripheral insulin sensitivity. No difference was observed in glucagon, growth hormone and free fatty acids between propranolol and placebo treatment. The results support the view that the hypothetical pancreatic glucoreceptor, at least in non-acute studies, is not affected by beta blockade. In addition, there was no effect on tissue sensitivity to insulin.", 
    "36": "The acute and short term antihypertensive effect of flosequinan was determined in 16 hypertensive patients whose blood pressure was inadequately controlled despite treatment with a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent and a diuretic. Erect and supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure was significantly reduced by flosequinan over the treatment period as compared to placebo. Heart rate was unchanged by flosequinan. Adverse effects were limited to mild headache in 3 patients and taste disturbance in 1 patient, possibly due to salivary excretion of the drug. Flosequinan is a potentially useful vasodilator for the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "37": "Methoxamine and alpha-methyl-noradrenaline were administered to six healthy male subjects on separate days as rapid bolus injections until blood pressure increased by approximately 30 mmHg; Valsalva's Manoeuvre was carried out on each occasion. Propranolol (80 mg) or placebo was administered (random order, double-blind, weekly intervals) and the observations were repeated after 2 h. Baroreceptor sensitivity (delta R-R interval ms/mmHg systolic BP) was less (p less than 0.05) with alpha-methyl-noradrenaline than methoxamine. Propranolol abolished the differences in baroreceptor-mediated bradycardia following alpha-methyl-noradrenaline and methoxamine, and shifted the baroreceptor sensitivity regression lines (p less than 0.05) to the left. During the release phase of Valsalva's Manoeuvre baroreceptor sensitivity was increased following propranolol. The smaller baroreceptor-mediated bradycardia response observed with alpha-methyl-noradrenaline does not support the hypothesis that pre-synaptic alpha-adrenoreceptors have a physiological role in the modulation of baroreceptor function in man, and may be due to alpha-methyl-noradrenaline having beta 1-agonist activity.", 
    "38": "One of the attributes of beta-adrenergic blocking agents that has distinguished these drugs from each other is degree of lipophilicity. While this feature may play a role in facilitating passage across the blood-brain barrier, it is essential to realize that crossing the barrier is not necessarily synonymous with the ability to cause central nervous system (CNS) effects. Several studies have found some degree of CNS side effects, particularly tiredness and fatigue, with atenolol, a hydrophilic beta blocker. Pindolol, a moderately lipophilic beta blocker, has been reported to cause greater disturbances on electroencephalogram (EEG) than propranolol, the most highly lipophilic beta blocker. The investigational agent bevantolol exhibits a moderate degree of lipophilicity and a low frequency of CNS side effects. Drug-induced increases in plasma catecholamine levels, the possible saturation of CNS receptor sites at relatively low drug levels, and the specific structural details of beta-blocker molecules have been suggested as possible contributory factors in determining the degree of CNS effects.", 
    "39": "The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of flestolol, a new short-acting, beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, were examined in nine healthy subjects after a constant intravenous infusion of 5 micrograms/kg/min for 72 hours. Flestolol blood levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. In all subjects, flestolol blood concentration attained steady state 30 minutes after initiation of infusion. The mean +/- standard deviation steady-state concentration of flestolol was 31.1 +/- 12.0 ng/mL. The elimination half-life averaged 7.2 minutes. The mean +/- standard deviation total body clearance was 181 +/- 66 mL/min/kg. The apparent volume of distribution and the area under the curve averaged 1.89 L/kg and 2.23 micrograms-hr/mL, respectively. Flestolol did not cause any significant change (P greater than .05) in the heart rate or systolic or diastolic blood pressure from the baseline. Flestolol significantly (P less than .05) attenuated the isoproterenol-induced increase in heart rate and systolic blood pressure and decrease in diastolic blood pressure in comparison with baseline. The average maximum reduction in isoproterenol tachycardia was in the range of 63% to 79% during flestolol infusion. There was a rapid recovery from beta blockade after termination of flestolol infusion; the recovery averaged 96% 20 minutes after the infusion was stopped. We conclude that flestolol exhibits a very short half-life and is cleared mainly by extrahepatic routes. It is an effective beta blocker and possesses a short duration of action.", 
    "40": "The effects of beta 1 and beta 1/2 blockade on exercise capacity were studied in 9 healthy normotensive subjects. Progressive maximal bicycle ergometer tests, followed by an endurance test at 80% of maximal work load, were performed during randomized, double-blind 3 day treatment periods with placebo, atenolol (beta 1) and oxprenolol (beta 1/2). The reduction of maximal work capacity (ca. 10%) was similar with atenolol and oxprenolol, despite a more pronounced maximal heart rate reduction with atenolol (from 175 +/- 2 to 132 +/- 3 beats.min-1) than with oxprenolol (to 138 +/- 2 beats.min-1). Exercise time during the endurance test was reduced from 36 +/- 4 min with placebo to 27 +/- 3 min with atenolol (p less than 0.05) and 24 +/- 3 min with oxprenolol (p less than 0.01) (atenolol vs. oxprenolol: p less than 0.05). During the endurance test, plasma glycerol and non-esterified fatty acid concentrations were reduced with both atenolol and oxprenolol. The glycerol reduction was more pronounced with oxprenolol than with atenolol, plasma NEFA concentrations being similar. Plasma glucose and lactate concentrations were reduced by oxprenolol but not with atenolol. These data show that submaximal exercise capacity at work loads representing similar relative exercise intensities is reduced during non-selective and beta 1-selective beta blockade. This reduction may be related to the effects of beta 1 blockade on energy metabolism, with possibly an additional effect of beta 2 blockade.", 
    "41": "1. Adenosine and its derivatives induced dispersion of leucosomes in leucophores of the medaka, Oryzias latipes. 2. Among the purines used, 5'-N-ethylcarboxiamideadenosine was the most effective and its potency was far greater than that of adenosine, N6-L-phenylisopropyladenosine and N6-cyclohexyladenosine. 3. Methylxanthines inhibited the purine action competitively, but beta adrenergic antagonists and dipyridamole did not. 4. Beta adrenergic agonists and forskolin synergistically augmented the purine action, while Li+ blocked it competitively. 5. The results suggest that medaka leucophores possess A2 adenosine receptors on the cell membranes, the stimulation of which induces leucosome-dispersion response by increasing the cellular level of cyclic AMP through activation of adenylate cyclase activity.", 
    "42": "In a series of investigations we have evaluated efferent renal nerve activity in hypertensive man. Net renal release of noradrenaline, calculated as the arterio-venous gradient for noradrenaline across the kidney times flow, was taken as an index of local adrenergic activity. Renal blood flow, under various circumstances, was determined by xenon-washout. At rest noradrenaline release was variable but enhanced release, indicative of increased sympathetic activity, invariably was found during isometric exercise. The latter was associated with renal vasoconstriction. Further studies, employing intrarenal infusions of either the alpha-1 antagonist doxazosin or the alpha-2 antagonist yohimbine in doses that do not produce systemic effects, demonstrate that adrenergic vasoconstriction both at rest and during isometric exercise is accomplished mainly through alpha-2 receptors. It may be that an alpha- adrenoceptor mediated vascular response also determines the efficacy of chronic beta-blockade.", 
    "43": "We studied the changes in blood plasma electrolytes during acute and short-term treatment with four different beta-adrenergic-blocking agents in 31 patients with hyperthyroidism. Serum phosphate increased during the first four hours and remained elevated after one week both after cardioselective (acebutolol) and non-cardioselective (oxprenolol, pindolol and timolol) beta-blockade (p less than 0.05). Albumin decreased after four hours but no change was found after one week. Serum creatinine increased after one week in the acebutolol-treated group, while sodium, potassium and albumin-corrected calcium in serum did not change. The hyperphosphatemic effect may be due to blockade of beta 1-adrenoceptors, since the effect of the cardioselective acebutolol was no less than that of the non-cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor blockers.", 
    "44": "Fifty hypertensive patients on beta-blocker therapy with supine blood pressure greater than or equal to 95 mmHg were included in a parallel group, double-blind study for 12 weeks to compare blood pressures, metabolic and adverse effects of additional treatment with diuretics. Hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) 25 mg daily was added to one group and furosemide 30 mg daily in a slow-release preparation, Lasix Retard (LR), to the other. Blood pressure decreased significantly and similarly in both groups from about 155/101 to about 144/95 mmHg (p less than 0.01). Diastolic blood pressure was lowered to less than or equal to 90 mmHg in 29% of the HCT patients and in 59% of the LR patients. Serum potassium decreased significantly from 4.05 mmol/l to 3.62 mmol/l on HCT, while the decrease on LR from 4.13 mmol/l to 4.05 mmol/l was not significant. Serum urate increased significantly, although within the normal range, on HCT. No change in fasting blood glucose or HbA1C was observed in any group. The patients were asked to report 40 different possible side-effects on a visual analogue scale at every visit. The side-effects already observed on beta-blockers did not change consistently on additional therapy with either HCT or LR. Thus, additional treatment with HCT or LR to patients already treated with beta-blockers results in an equal further blood pressure reduction, but in contrast to treatment with HCT, addition of LR does not affect serum potassium concentrations.", 
    "45": "The influence of contractile activity, insulin, catecholamines and diabetes mellitus on the acute as well as long-term regulation of glucose transport into skeletal muscle was investigated. In Paper I, glucose uptake was determined in the perfused hindlimb preparation; in Papers II-VI the glucose transport process was studied independently of glucose metabolism by determining the uptake of the non-metabolizable glucose analogue 3-O-methylglucose into isolated rat epitrochlearis muscles. The main findings are: Acute regulation of muscle glucose transport: 1. Muscle contraction-induced glucose uptake does not require the presence of insulin. 2. Exercise and a maximal insulin stimulus have additive effects on glucose transport. 3. Catecholamines decrease non-insulin-mediated glucose transport in the absence of albumin, whereas in the presence of albumin an enhancement occurs. 4. The effects of catecholamines are abolished during beta-adrenergic blockade, but remain unaffected during alpha-adrenergic blockade. Long-term regulation of muscle glucose transport: 5. The rat epitrochlearis muscle, a thin, predominantly fast-twitch muscle of the forearm, was shown to be a suitable preparation for the study of factors regulating glucose transport capacity on a long-term basis, since it maintains energy stores and tissue oxygenation for periods of at least 14 h. 6. Sustained insulin deficiency results in marked decreases in basal (40-45%), contraction-induced (50-60%), and insulin-stimulated (65-70%) glucose transport into rat epitrochlearis muscle. 7. The decreased contraction-induced glucose transport capacity can be prevented by frequent exercise during the period of insulin deficiency. 8. The decreased insulin responsiveness of the muscle glucose transport system can be reversed either by treating previously untreated diabetic rats with insulin or by in vitro incubation of the muscles for 12-14 hours. 9. The in vitro normalization of the insulin-stimulated glucose transport capacity (a) does not require the presence of serum or insulin, (b) occurs despite high (30 mM) concentrations of glucose, (c) is incomplete in the presence of diabetic serum and (d) is blocked to the amount of 30-80% in the presence of protein synthesis inhibition. On the basis of these findings, the following is concluded: Muscle contraction can activate the glucose transport system independently of insulin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "46": "The central adrenergic blocking activity of adimolol (ADL) was studied in rats and mice in the tests which can differentiate beta-, alpha 1-, and alpha 2-adrenolytic effects. Clenbuterol- and salbutamol-induced sedation in rats (open field test) and clenbuterol-induced hyperthermia (at high ambient temperature) were antagonized by low doses of ADL (0.1-1.0 mg/kg ip). ADL (10 mg/kg ip) attenuated the clonidine-induced aggression in mice, and its higher doses (20 and 40 mg/kg ip) depressed the hind limb flexor reflex of the spinal rat and counteracted the stimulatory action of clonidine. ADL at doses from 2.5 to 40 mg/kg ip affected neither the clonidine-induced sedation in rats and mice (locomotor activity, open field test), nor the hyperthermia (at high temperature). The hypothermia (at a room temperature of 21 degrees C) induced by clonidine was partially antagonized. The Ki values for ADL displacement of 3H-dihydroalprenolol and 3H-prazosin binding in the rat cerebral cortex were 1.2 nM and 951 nM respectively. These results indicate that ADL is a potent antagonist of central beta-adrenoceptors and has a weaker alpha 1-adrenolytic action. The central alpha 2-antagonistic effect is either very weak or absent.", 
    "47": "The influences of 8 different beta-blockers on the tear film stability-measured on the breakup time (BUT) of normal and healthy volunteers-was compared. All beta-blockers led to BUT reduction, however, the lowest influence was observed with levobunolol. The duration of this effect was compared with that of levobunolol, timolol and metipranolol. While the minor BUT alterations induced by levobunolol recovered after 30 min and were completely restored after 1 h, those of the two other beta-blockers lasted for over 2 h. The combination of timolol 0.5% with different artificial tears containing mainly polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) 1.4%, methylcellulose and polyacrylic acid initially led also to BUT reduction. The best results were obtained with PVA 1.4%.", 
    "48": "1. Benzodiazepines and strong analgesics raise considerably the ventricular fibrillation threshold and thus electrically stabilize the heart in the early stage of myocardial ischaemia. 2. Benzodiazepines markedly potentiate the electrostabilizing effect of the beta-blocker metipranolol. 3. Trimecaine per se does not electrically stabilize the heart in the first hour of ischaemia. When combined with a benzodiazepine, trimecaine stabilizes the heart also in this early stage of myocardial ischaemia. 4. Infusion of a benzodiazepine (midazolam) combined with fractionated administration of a potent analgesic (fentanyl) does not produce pronounced changes in the haemodynamics and ventilation of healthy subjects. 5. Benzodiazepines and strong analgesics exert a favourable effect on the neurovegetative stress response in the early stage of acute myocardial ischaemia. They can be therefore recommended as a component in the treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "49": "The influence of alpha- and beta-receptor antagonists combined with drugs which act as antagonists at muscarinic and nicotinic receptor sites on epileptic focus produced by topic penicillin application was investigated. The beta-receptor blocking agent caused a faster and more intense activity of epileptogenic focus in comparison with activity in control animals, but the number of seizures decreased relatively for 25%. N-receptor antagonists diminished the facilitating effect of the beta-receptor antagonist on focal activity. Combination of m- and beta-receptor antagonists did not influence the spike activity of the focus. Treatment with alpha-receptor antagonists enhanced spikes and number of seizures only insignificantly. The combination of alpha- and n-receptor blocking substances does not influence the development of the epileptic process. The alpha-receptor antagonist together with the m-receptor blocking drug induces a facilitation of spike activity.", 
    "50": "Because of results in animal experiments which demonstrated a partial beta 2-adrenoceptor activity of labetalol on rat uterine smooth muscle the present study was conducted in human preparations. The following results were obtained: 1. Rhythmic uterine contractions with a defined steady-state amplitude and frequency were elicited spontaneously and after methylergometrine. 2. Labetalol reduced amplitude of contractions dose-dependently after 3 h of incubation. Frequency was unaffected. 3. The tocolytic effect of labetalol is apparent only at high concentrations, above those used in the treatment of hypertension. 4. Neither beta 2-specific adrenoceptor blockade with ICI 118,551 nor alpha-blockade with phentolamine changed amplitude of contraction, either alone or in combination with labetalol. 5. Labetalol has little tocolytic effect on human myometrium in vitro. This effect is unrelated to alpha- or beta-antagonism, but seems to depend on a direct smooth muscle depressant effect. In conclusion, from the present in vitro experiments using human myometrial preparations, it seems unlikely that labetalol would interfere with the normal process of labor when used for the treatment of pregnancy hypertension.", 
    "51": "A randomized double-blind trial was performed with betaxolol, a beta 1-selective and long-acting beta-blocker, in patients with a recent first uncomplicated acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Patients were treated between the 3rd and 14th day after the onset of AMI with either a single oral dosage of 20 mg betaxolol or placebo. The effects on heart rate, ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias were studied by continuous 24 hours ECG recordings on the 7th and between the 9th to 12th after the onset of AMI and by a submaximal exercise test on the 12th day. Hourly mean, peak and minimal heart rate were during the whole day significantly lower in the active treatment group. In betaxolol treated patients diurnal variations in heart rate were definitely changed. No differences in the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias were found between both groups; auricular fibrillation was more common in placebo treated patients. Heart rate and pressure rate product were significantly higher during exercise in the placebo group. During exercise ventricular arrhythmias were infrequent in both groups. The clinical tolerance of betaxolol was excellent.", 
    "52": "1. Effects of noradrenaline and the related compounds adrenaline, dopamine, octopamine, tyramine, clonidine and isoprenaline were studied in isolated heart preparations from the cuttlefish Sepia officinalis L. 2. All analogues produced a positive inotropic affect, with noradrenaline being the most potent substance. The chronotropic effects of the tested compounds differed widely. 3. The action of substances of the phenylethanolamine group were not antagonized by propranolol but were partly antagonized by phentolamine. 4. Serotonin and its analogues also produced cardio-excitation. These effects were blocked by cyproheptadine but not by methysergide. 5. These results indicate the presence of two different receptors in the Sepia myocardium: one type reacting with noradrenaline most effectively and a second type being stimulated by serotonin.", 
    "53": "We studied the effects and mode of action of epinephrine on the oxidative phosphorylation of rat liver mitochondria. With either succinate or beta-hydroxybutyrate as substrate, i.v. injection of 1.5 microgram/100 g epinephrine increased the respiratory rates by 30-40% in state 3 (with ADP), and by 20-30% in state 4 (after ADP phosphorylation), so that the respiratory control ratio (state 3/state 4) changed little. The respiratory stimulation by epinephrine was maximal 20 minutes after its injection. The action of epinephrine on mitochondria was blocked by pretreatment of the animals with the alpha 1-antagonist prazosin but not by treatment with the beta-antagonist propranolol. I. v. injection of 10 micrograms/100 g phenylephrine evoked the same mitochondrial response as epinephrine. I. v. administration of 50 micrograms/100 g dibutyryl cyclic AMP enhanced glycaemia but did not affect mitochondrial respiration. Epinephrine therefore has an alpha 1-type of action on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.", 
    "54": "The stainless steel cannula inserting method was used to observe effects of nipradilol and prazosin on responses to periarterial electrical nerve stimulation and intraluminal administration of noradrenaline or phenylephrine in isolated and perfused canine mesenteric arteries. With small doses, nipradilol slightly potentiated vasoconstrictor responses to noradrenaline, but not periarterial stimulation. With a relatively large dose, nipradilol almost uniformly suppressed both periarterial stimulation-induced and noradrenaline- or phenylephrine-induced vasoconstriction. On the other hand, prazosin inhibited noradrenaline-induced vasoconstriction at small doses but not periarterial nerve stimulation-induced vasoconstrictions. At any doses, prazosin strongly inhibited noradrenaline-induced constrictions more markedly than periarterial stimulation-induced constrictions. It is concluded that nipradilol has a dominant inhibitory property on periarterial nerve stimulation-induced constriction in isolated canine mesenteric arteries.", 
    "55": "CGS 10078B (CGS; 1-[2,3-dihydro-1,4-(2S)-benzodioxin-2-yl]-5-[2,3-dihydro-1,4-(2R)- benzodioxin-2-yl]-3-(1R,5S)-aza-1,5-pentanediol methane sulfonate) is an agent with alpha- and beta-receptor and calcium channel blocking actions. To study its antiarrhythmic activity, cats were anesthetized with alpha-chloralose, ventilated, and given atropine and gallamine. CGS (10 or 20 mg/kg, i.v.) was infused 15 min prior to ouabain. Bolus injections of ouabain (25 micrograms/kg, i.v.) were given every 15 min until death (D). Some cats were pretreated with reserpine (R; 5 mg/kg, i.p.) 24 h prior to the experiment. In other cats 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA; 20 mg/kg, i.v.) was administered 3 days prior to CGS 20 mg/kg and ouabain. Data were compared with those of Lathers [Eur. J. Pharmacol. 64: 95, 1980], i.e., with 12 cats who received only ouabain and with 11 pretreated with timolol (T; 5 mg/kg, i.v.) prior to ouabain. After CGS (10 or 20 mg/kg, i.v.), but just prior to the first dose of ouabain, the blood pressure (BP) was decreased (p less than 0.05) from control (165 +/- 6 vs. 96 +/- 7, and 136 +/- 5 vs. 90 +/- 10 mm Hg, respectively). Comparable heart rate (HR) values were also decreased (p less than 0.05) from 225 +/- 17 to 166 +/- 14 and from 193 +/- 8 to 152 +/- 6 beats/min. 11 min after T, BP and HR had decreased (p less than 0.05) from 133 +/- 6 to 103 +/- 7 mm Hg and from 134 +/- 4 to 104 +/- 6 beats/min, respectively. Ouabain did not influence these decreases in BP and HR. CGS (10 or 20 mg/kg, i.v.) increased (p less than 0.05) the time to ouabain-induced arrhythmia (AR) and D. The magnitude of the protection appeared to be similar to that afforded by T. R given prior to CGS (20 mg/kg, i.v.) also increased the time to ouabain-induced AR and D while 6-OHDA increased the time to AR. The CGS protection against ouabain-induced AR was still present in animals pretreated with R or 6-OHDA. This indicates that the antiarrhythmic affect is not dependent upon adrenergic neuronal blockade.", 
    "56": "32 patients with stable angina pectoris who had been receiving a controlled-release formulation Durules of isosorbide 5-mononitrate (Imdur) 60 to 120 mg daily with concomitant beta-blocker therapy for at least 1 year were entered into a study to evaluate possible rebound phenomena from the abrupt withdrawal of isosorbide 5-mononitrate and to determine whether nitrate tolerance had developed. Isosorbide 5-mononitrate was abruptly withdrawn and substituted with placebo for 2 weeks, after which the active drug was reintroduced. No deterioration of exercise performance could be detected during withdrawal of therapy, but an increase was seen after reinstitution. No tolerance was found for systolic blood pressure and ST segment changes or for the number of anginal attacks and short-acting glyceryl trinitrate tablets consumed. Three patients had to be hospitalised because of a sudden deterioration of symptoms on withdrawal of isosorbide 5-mononitrate. It was concluded that isosorbide 5-mononitrate in Durules has a beneficial effect and that tolerance does not appear to be clinically relevant.", 
    "57": "In a multicentre double-blind crossover study the clinical efficacy and tolerability of a controlled-release formulation, Durules, of isosorbide 5-mononitrate (Imdur) 60mg once daily was compared with placebo over 2 weeks in 70 patients with stable exercise-induced angina pectoris who were receiving concomitant long term beta-blockade. Isosorbide 5-mononitrate significantly improved exercise capacity and signs of myocardial ischaemia, while reducing the number of anginal attacks and consumption of short-acting glyceryl trinitrate tablets compared with beta-blocker therapy alone. During an open follow-up period of 1 year, there was no attenuation of the antianginal efficacy of isosorbide 5-mononitrate. The drug was well tolerated during both phases of the study, and the only significant adverse effect was headache, which rapidly disappeared during continued treatment.", 
    "58": "Ventricular arrhythmias are the major cause of death in patients with coronary heart disease. By suppressing the arrhythmias, antiarrhythmic agents have the theoretical potential of preventing sudden arrhythmic deaths. A large number of randomized, controlled clinical trials of these agents have been conducted during the early hospital phase after an acute myocardial infarction as well as after discharge. Included in this review are approximately 20 mortality trials of antiarrhythmic drugs, including beta blockers, which have been conducted in the United States and Australia. Results of the trials of antiarrhythmics reported to date have not demonstrated an effect on patient survival or risk of sudden death. Three possible explanations exist. First, these agents do not improve prognosis, which is contrary to massive evidence from animal, clinical, and epidemiologic studies. Second, drug treatment prolongs life, but benefit has not been observed in the trials. This explanation is plausible, since the completed trials have methodologic limitations. Third, control of ventricular arrhythmias helps some patients but harms others. Larger, properly designed trials are needed to resolve the uncertainty about the value of antiarrhythmics in the prevention of sudden death. The short- and long-term trials of beta blockers have documented an effect on survival. The benefit seems to be explained primarily through a reduction in sudden or instantaneous death. Whether this effect is mediated through a reduction in ventricular ectopies or an elevation of the fibrillation threshold is debated, as is the effect, if any, of beta-2 blockade on the incidence of ventricular fibrillation.", 
    "59": "Progress in understanding the epidemiology and mechanism of sudden cardiac death (SCD) has been rapid over the past two decades. This, together with the availability of drugs with actions that potentially may counter the pathophysiology of sudden death, has led to myriad trials aimed at prolonging life for high-risk individuals. European countries have contributed a major share both to the development of these drugs and to subsequent tests of their efficacy. Ventricular fibrillation (VF), either unheralded or secondary to fresh myocardial ischemia, is by far the most common cause of SCD. The classes of drugs with profiles that might be expected to influence the occurrence of VF directly are antiarrhythmics, calcium channel blockers, platelet-active agents, and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. Twenty-four of the European trials that employed agents from these groups have special significance because of their design and size. Studies of two of the calcium channel blockers have not demonstrated any life-saving potential to date. One platelet-active agent - aspirin - has shown favorable trends. Results with the use of antiarrhythmic agents have been disappointing, probably because their adverse effects, including arrhythmogenesis in some patients, have countered the antiarrhythmic effects that other patients have achieved. Nevertheless, evidence suggests that lidocaine can reduce the incidence of VF; this can reasonably be equated with life-saving potential whenever defibrillation is not available. Trials with beta-blocking drugs have been the most encouraging; seven of the 11 trials that have been considered demonstrated a significant reduction in sudden death, which was variously defined, and a strong trend toward reduction was observed with another. None of the trials showed an unfavorable trend. The results of completed trials now offer practical guidance to physicians with responsibility for the care of patients with ischemic heart disease, especially those who have features that indicate high risk.", 
    "60": "The effects of plasma thrombocytopoietin are investigated in test mice against the background of nonselective beta adrenergic impacts. The changes in the thrombocytopoiesis are accounted for by the thrombocytes count and by the percentage of 75selenomethionine incorporated in the newly-formed thrombocytes. Plasma thrombocytopoietin is found to stimulate markedly thrombocytopoiesis on the background of beta-adrenergic stimulation with isoprenaline. Pretreatment with propranolol totally prevents this stimulation. Independent treatment with propranolol as a background of thrombocytopoietin considerably inhibits thrombocytopoiesis. The effects of thrombocytopoietin are found to depend on the state of the beta-adrenoreceptors: their stimulation has a synergic effect on thrombocytopoietin, while their blocking impedes its realization. The data established are indirect proof about the existence of beta-adrenoreceptors in the megakaryocyte series and probably in its precursors as well.", 
    "61": "Some indices of relaxation and rapid filling were evaluated in the course of a six-month treatment with non-selective beta-blocker in 30 patients with hypertonic disease, (HD), degree II, with echocardiographically confirmed left-ventricular hypertrophy and normal systolic function. The phase analysis of the early diastole, performed according to Alvarez and Goodwin, reveals a progressive shortening of the period of isovolumetric relaxation and lengthening of the period of active suction with no change in the summed up period of rapid relaxation; the period of rapid filing is lengthened on account of the active suction. The evaluated via computer analysis (echo-computer--NIEMT-MA, Sofia) parameters of rapid filling of M-type echogram of left ventricle (maximum velocity of increase of left-ventricular dimension, mean velocity of fraction of rapid filling) increase progressively. The dynamics of the indices of diastolic function described, reflect the diminution of the restriction of ventricular filling and its shifting to the early diastole.", 
    "62": "Noradrenaline-elicited accumulation of cyclic AMP and effects of an alpha-, beta-adrenoceptor, or adenosine receptor antagonist on the accumulation were examined in slices of different areas of rat cerebral cortex in which ferrous chloride solution was injected unilaterally into the sensorimotor cortex to induce epileptiform activity. The cyclic AMP accumulation was altered regionally in relation to both lateral dominance of electrographic isolated spike activity and variance of the epileptic process. Involvement of a beta-adrenergic, and possibly alpha-adrenergic, mechanism in the alterations in the cyclic AMP accumulation was indicated.", 
    "63": "Eight healthy men were randomly assigned in a latin square order to receive single doses of placebo, tertatolol 5 mg, propranolol 80 mg and atenolol 100 mg at 7-day intervals. Resting heart rate and pulmonary function were measured 10 min before and over the 240 min following dosing, and then 15 min after inhalation of salbutamol 200 micrograms and ipratropium bromide 40 micrograms. The three beta-blockers caused similar reductions in resting heart rate throughout the study, whereas placebo had no effect. The three beta-blockers, like placebo, produced no significant change in pulmonary function during the 240 min after dosing. The bronchodilator response to salbutamol after atenolol and placebo was preserved, whereas it was reduced after administration of either of the non-selective beta-blockers, tertatolol and propranolol. An unequivocal response of the airways to ipratropium bromide was observed after tertatolol and propranolol, which was much greater than after atenolol. No response was observed after placebo. Thus, despite bronchial beta 2-blockade, by non-selective beta-blockers, bronchodilatation was definitely produced by ipratropium bromide, confirming the predominant role of the parasympathetic system in the autonomic innervation of normal human airways.", 
    "64": "Sixty patients were treated for 1 year for essential uncomplicated hypertension, 30 with beta-blockers alone (BB) and 30 with BB and chlorthalidone (CTD). BB did not affect serum K+ or Mg++. In the BB-group there was a statistically significant trend towards retention of Mg++ in a loading test, but the effect was clinically marginal. BB + CTD reduced serum K+ and Mg++ and caused significant Mg++ depletion, as shown by the Mg++ loading test. All the effects were highly significant and were clinically important. The metabolic perturbations due to CTD are potentially dangerous and make this drug unattractive as 'first choice' treatment for hypertension.", 
    "65": "The placental transfer of beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents has been well established in the last years. Randomized and/or controlled studies have given a less pessimistic view of the consequences of these drugs on the fetal and neonatal adaptation. In fact, the beta-blockers are able to produce hypotension, bradycardia, respiratory troubles in the newborn infant, troubles which are generally slight when the neonates are full-term. However, even if in good clinical conditions, this kind of neonate should be carefully monitored for at least the first 2 days of life.", 
    "66": "Despite the well-established correlation between coronary heart disease (CHD) and hypertension, conventional antihypertensive therapy with diuretics and beta-adrenergic blockers has failed to provide protection against CHD. A possible explanation for this failure is the unfavorable effect such drugs have on lipid metabolism. To compare the lipid profiles of commonly used antihypertensive drugs, a survey was made of selected studies from the literature. Diuretics and selective and nonselective beta-blockers were found to have adverse effects on blood lipids. Beta-blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, labetalol, methyldopa, and calcium channel blockers are lipid neutral, whereas alpha-adrenergic blockers seemed to have a favorable effect on lipid metabolism. Controlled clinical trials with drugs that have no adverse effects on lipid metabolism are needed to establish the long-term clinical importance of such agents.", 
    "67": "The effect of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists on the receptor-mediated low density lipoprotein (LDL) binding and internalization was studied in vitro in human skin fibroblasts. The cellular uptake of 125I-labeled human LDL was dose dependently elevated by some, but not all, of the drugs used. This effect of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists was positively related to their lipophilicity, and was prevented by cycloheximide and by alpha-amanitin. Scatchard analysis of the saturable LDL binding indicates an increased number of LDL binding sites. Our studies show that the stimulating effect of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists on the high affinity LDL binding and internalization in human skin fibroblasts involves DNA transcription and new protein synthesis, and identify drug lipophilicity as a major determinant of this action. This effect could be relevant in vivo in adipose tissue which accumulates lipophilic drugs and derives its cholesterol mainly from circulating LDL.", 
    "68": "We have examined the effects of 7 days treatment with beta adrenoceptor antagonists in 8 healthy volunteers in a placebo controlled, crossover study. We investigated three beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (atenolol, oxprenolol, and propranolol), which have differing profiles of selectivity and partial agonist properties (intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, ISA). We studied adrenaline-induced hypokalaemia, the vasodilator response to an infusion of adrenaline (0.06 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1 for 90 min), and lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptor number, determined by (-) [125I]-iodocyanopindolol binding, and measured these variables both before and after 7 days of treatment. The beta 2-mediated depressor response to adrenaline infusion was abolished by propranolol and oxprenolol but persisted after atenolol. In contrast, the hypokalaemia induced by adrenaline was abolished by all three beta-blockers. Lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptor number increased significantly following propranolol treatment, but not after oxprenolol for atenolol. We conclude that up-regulation of lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptors is dependent on beta 2-receptor blockade and is modified by ISA. The reversal of the hypokalaemic response by atenolol suggests that beta 1 receptors may contribute to the former effect. Alternatively, since different populations of beta 2-adrenoceptors differ in their susceptibility to antagonists there may also be differences in agonist coupling to beta 2-responses between tissues.", 
    "69": "Tissue distribution of acebutolol was studied in 33-week-old normotensive (WKY) and Okamoto stroke-prone (SHR-SP) rats, 30 min after an i.v. administration, by using 14C-acebutolol. Plasma level of acebutolol was higher in WKY than in SHR-SP. Aorta, kidney, liver and muscle radioactivity/plasma radioactivity ratios were higher in SHR-SP than in WKY. The brain/plasma radioactivity ratio was very low and similar in the two groups. The drug distribution was the same in the two groups except in medulla + corpus trapezoides where drug concentration was greater in SHR-SP. These results, compared with previous ones, show an age-related evolution in pathological state in SHR-SP. They point out a specific concentration of the beta-blocking drug in a defined part of the brain, namely medulla + corpus trapezoides.", 
    "70": "A direct radioligand binding technique utilizing the beta-adrenergic antagonist [3H]dihydroalprenolol was employed in the identification and characterization of Trypanosoma cruzi beta-adrenergic receptors. [3H]DHA binding was saturable (Bmax = 1.5 pmol/10(6) cells) with an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 127 nM. Binding of [3H]DHA was displaced by propranolol in a concentration-dependent manner. The relative potency order of adrenergic ligands in displacing [3H]DHA binding was: propranolol greater than or equal to alprenolol greater than epinephrine. 5-Hydroxytryptamine, phentolamine and catechol had no effect. The experimental results support the suggestion that beta-adrenergic receptors are present in the pathogenic protozoa Trypanosoma cruzi.", 
    "71": "During the 1st h of extrauterine life, the adenine nucleotide content of the rat kidney is modified: the ATP level increases (+30%) while ADP and AMP are lowered (-30 and -50%, respectively). This leads to a high value of energy charge in the newborn kidney (0.89 vs. 0.80 in the fetus). It was possible to obtain in utero a similar modification of ATP, ADP, AMP concentrations by injections to the fetuses of cAMP, dibutyryl cAMP, or isoprenaline. Conversely, the postnatal changes in adenine nucleotide content could be prevented by administration to the fetus, just before birth, of beta- or beta 1-adrenoreceptor antagonists. Therefore the rise of kidney energy charge following parturition appears to be under hormonal control. Glucagon had no effect on kidney adenine nucleotide content. It is strongly suggested that the catecholamines released at the time of parturition are the triggering factor of this evolution."
