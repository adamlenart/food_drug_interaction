    "0": "Patients with severe effort angina were studied hemodynamically and left ventricular function curves were obtained during successively increasing myocardial ischemia provoked by exercise. The mean left ventricular function curve of 57 patients showed a slow increase in stroke work index with increasing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure at the beginning of exercise and stroke work index reached a maximum value of 0.79 (+/- 0.21) J/beat/m2 BSA at a left ventricular end diastolic pressure 30 (+/- 7) mm Hg. Despite a continuous increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure to 37 (+/- 6) mm Hg at the breaking point, stroke work index fell to its lowest value (0.64 +/- 0.21) J/beat/m2 BSA. A repeated exercise 20 min after the first in 10 patients did not influence the exercise tolerance or the left ventricular function curve. Although all the drugs nitroglycerin, propranolol and verapamil significantly increased the exercise tolerance none of the drugs enabled the patients to reach a significantly higher stroke work index. Only after nitroglycerin was there a significant increase (p greater than 0.05) of left ventricular power. After coronary bypass surgery with successful revascularization, however, there was a marked increase of both stroke work index and left ventricular power during exercise. Thus the increased exercise tolerance after surgery was accompanied by an increased left ventricular work and power but after medication no such effect on stroke work index and left ventricular power was seen. It is therefore suggested that the increased exercise tolerance after the anti-anginal drugs studied is a result of their different mechanisms of unloading the left ventricle.", 
    "1": "The widespread use of antiarrhythmic agents to control severe life-threatening arrhythmias evidenced the possibility of a worsening of arrhythmias induced by the same drugs. We performed a retrospective analysis studying the worsening phenomenon in patients who underwent pharmacological invasive and non invasive antiarrhythmic tests to choose the drug to be administered in the chronic treatment. Particularly we reviewed: 101 acute pharmacologic non invasive tests for \"stable\" ventricular ectopic beats using computerized automatic continuous recording system which allows quantitative and qualitative evaluation of arrhythmias. The drugs tested were: Propafenone (25 patients), Disopiramide (25 patients), Tocainide (11 patients), Lorcainide (8 patients), Lorajmine (13 patients), Nadolol (9 patients). In accordance with Vallebit et al., we considered arrhythmias worsening criteria: the onset of non sustained or sustained ventricular tachycardia; an increase of four fold the number of ventricular ectopic beats and/or ten fold the repetitive forms. A worsening of arrhythmias was observed in 4/101 (3.9% patients); 1/9 treated with Nadolol, 1/25 with Propafenone, 1/35 with Disopiramide, 1/13 with Lorajmine. For one young patient the worsening phenomenon could be considered a toxic picture, because of the very high drug plasmatic levels (Lorajmine) observed for the whole duration of the sustained VT induced from the drug. For the remaining 3 patients the response resambles a paradox effect. 34 pharmacologic invasive tests in 30 patients with common recurrent ventricular tachycardia, during electrophysiologic endocavitary study. The drugs tested were: Propafenone (12 patients), Amiodarone (11 patients), Ajmaline (4 patients), Tocainide (3 patients), Lorcainide (2 patients), Lorajmine (1 patient), Disopiramide (1 patient).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "2": "In vitro rat diaphragms initially demonstrated a decrease in the force of the twitch contraction (FC) in response to field electrode stimulation when exposed to an unbuffered increase in PCO2 (UIPCO2). These diaphragms tended to regain their initial FC upon addition of a beta-agonist even while the increased PCO2 perdured. The effect of the agonist could be reversed by propranolol. Four hemidiaphragms were bathed in a medium containing curare and exposed to UIPCO2. Their tension values were compared to the opposite sides bathed without curare and exposed to UIPCO2 of the same intensity and duration. There was no statistically significant difference in the response. Subsequently 10 rat diaphragms were each systematically challenged by UIPCO2, buffered increases in PCO2 (BIPCO2), unbuffered decreases in bicarbonate (UDHCO3), and buffered decreases in bicarbonate (BDHCO3) first without and then with isoproterenol (10(-6) M). Without isoproterenol all four challenges after 15-min exposure produced a decrease in FC, the least by BIPCO2; the largest, by UDHCO3. Upon addition of isoproterenol, FC actually increased during BIPCO2; the decreases in FC in response to UIPCO2 and UDHCO3 were abolished; the FC in response to BDHCO3 was still decreased, but less severely. The effect of the isoproterenol was not due to its following the four challenges without isoproterenol. The different magnitudes in the FC response and the presumed lack of uniform change in intracellular pH during the four challenges suggest the possibility that different components in the sarcolemma, or in the excitation-contraction coupling mechanisms responsible for the genesis of the FC are affected by the four challenges, but the nerve or neuromuscular junction may also be affected.", 
    "3": "The influence of 1 week's total fasting on the lipolytic effect of adrenergic agonists and on the binding of adrenergic antagonists was examined in isolated adipocytes of subcutaneous specimens removed from the hypogastric and the femoral sites in seventeen obese women. In the femoral adipocytes the lipolytic sensitivity to isopropyl noradrenaline decreased 30-fold (P less than 0.01) during fasting. The specific binding of the radioligands (-)-[3H]-dihydroalprenolol and (-)-[125I]-cyanopindolol decreased significantly during fasting, essentially owing to a reduction in the receptor density. In adipocytes from the hypogastric region no such changes were found. For both tissue regions fasting induced a right-ward shift in the dose-response curve for the inhibitory effect of the alpha 2 agonist, clonidine, on theophylline-induced lipolysis, corresponding to a 10-fold decrease in sensitivity. There was also a significant decrease of about 20% in the alpha 2-adrenoceptor density, as estimated with the radioligand [3H]-yohimbine. The results suggest that the regulation of the lipid mobilization in man by the sympathetic nervous system during fasting occurs not only through an increase in the level of circulating noradrenaline but also through changes in the adrenergic receptor density of the adipocytes.", 
    "4": "The threshold of the initiation of myocardial ischemia was determined for conscious rabbits with the help of a special preliminary implanted appliance, which made it possible to perform the occlusion and reperfusion of the coronary artery. Nitroglycerin and propranolol were shown to increase the threshold of the initiation of ischemia, while dipyridamole was discovered to reduce it. The method described is offered for evaluation of the drug antianginal effect, since it is adequate and easily reproduced.", 
    "5": "Of 531 patients admitted to the Duke Coronary Care Unit with unstable angina (UA) from June 1981 to September 1982, 100 had persistent angina despite optimal medical therapy of nitrates, propranolol, and nifedipine. At catheterization, 70% of the refractory patients had left main (LM) or three-vessel disease (TVD), 68% had left ventricular end-diastolic pressures of greater than 12 mmHg, and 24% had ejection fractions (EF) of less than 0.40. Twenty-four patients were greater than 65 years of age, and 53 had associated major diseases. Forty-eight patients (Group I) had no evidence of myocardial infarction in the 30 days before catheterization, whereas 52 patients had an infarction precipitating the unstable angina within the preceding 30 days (Group II). Emergent coronary artery bypass grafting was performed in all 100 patients irrespective of ventricular function, hemodynamic status, or coronary anatomy. Management protocols included prompt surgical intervention, preoperative stabilization with the balloon pump in LM or TVD, meticulous myocardial protection, and complete coronary revascularization. An average of 3.6 grafts were placed in each patient. There were two hospital deaths in Group I, and two in Group II. Two-year survival was 90% in Group I and 88% in Group II, and 81% of surviving patients were NYHA Class I or II. Thus, refractory UA denotes particularly severe coronary disease with a high incidence of LM, TVD, and depressed EF. Baseline clinical characteristics, criteria for operation, and expected results in the postinfarction group seem to be similar to the unstable angina group in general. Cardiac anatomic and functional variables no longer constitute operative contraindications. Aggressive operative management is safe, and the current risk may be less dependent on coronary anatomy and ventricular function than previously appreciated.", 
    "6": "Hemodynamic and humoral events after intraoperative discontinuation of nitroprusside were studied in subjects without and with pretreatment with intravenous propranolol, 0.1 mg X kg-1. Nitroprusside-induced hypotension was associated with increases in heart rate, cardiac output, plasma renin activity (PRA), and catecholamine levels; these changes were prevented by propranolol. In subjects pretreated with propranolol, dose requirements of nitroprusside for hypotension of comparable degree and duration decreased 40%. On discontinuation of nitroprusside, mean systemic pressure rose to 100.2 mm Hg--a level higher than prehypotension and awake values--because of increased systemic vascular resistance. Hemodynamic events were associated with persistent elevations of PRA and catecholamine levels. These rebound changes were maximal 15 min after nitroprusside withdrawal and returned to control levels 30 to 60 min later. Pretreatment with propranolol completely prevented rebound hemodynamic events after nitroprusside. Persistent elevations of PRA and catecholamine levels after nitroprusside action subsided were responsible for the effects of withdrawal.", 
    "7": "Healthy subjects received single doses of diazepam (5 to 10 mg iv), lorazepam (2 mg iv), or alprazolam (1 mg orally) on two occasions, once in the control state and once with propranolol, 80 mg three times a day. Compliance with the propranolol regimen was verified by measurement of serum propranolol levels (overall means: 100 ng/ml) and by reduction in sensitivity to intravenous metaproterenol to one-thirtieth that of the control value. Propranolol prolonged diazepam elimination t1/2 (58 and 49 hr), reduced its clearance (0.20 and 0.24 ml/min/kg), and increased the 168-hr AUC for desmethyldiazepam, the major metabolite of diazepam (5.63 and 4.81 micrograms/ml . hr). Propranolol had no significant effect on lorazepam t1/2 (13.2 and 12.7 hr) or clearance (1.33 and 1.36 ml/min/kg), nor on alprazolam t1/2 (15.9 and 18.5 hr) or clearance (1.1 and 0.8 ml/min/kg). Thus propranolol induces a small but significant reduction in clearance of diazepam, biotransformed mainly by the oxidative reaction of N-demethylation. Propranolol does not impair lorazepam clearance by glucuronide conjugation nor that of alprazolam by aliphatic hydroxylation.", 
    "8": "Norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin directly stimulated glucagon secretion by isolated perifused hamster islet. Propranolol blocked norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin-stimulated glucagon release, suggesting that norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin may modulate glucagon secretion via a beta-adrenergic mechanism. Dopamine and serotonin may exert their action directly via the beta receptor, stimulate residual adrenergic nerve terminals, or the release of other islet biogenic amines. We conclude that part of the stimulating effect of norepinephrine on glucagon release is beta adrenergically mediated and that dopamine and serotonin may affect glucagon secretion either directly or through the release of neurotransmitters that lead to glucagon release. Thus the intra-islet released dopamine and serotonin may contribute to the islets paracrine system by stimulating intra-islet adrenergic neurons.", 
    "9": "The bronchodilatory effect of histamine was evaluated in a conscious guinea-pig model of cholinergically mediated bronchoconstriction. The H1, bronchoconstrictor, property of histamine was masked using high doses of the H1-antagonist chlorpheniramine (30 mg/kg), and the bronchodilatory activity evaluated by observing the increase in latency to collapse induced by aerosol methacholine. Under these conditions, histamine (1.0, 3.0 or 10.0 mg/kg, i.p.) delayed methacholine-induced collapse in a dose-dependent manner. Cimetidine, an H2-receptor antagonist (10 to 100 mg/kg), did not delay collapse either in the presence or absence of an H1-antagonist. However, when cimetidine was administered prior to histamine, the bronchodilatory activity of histamine was abolished. A similar abolition of histamine bronchodilation was observed if propranolol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, was administered prior to histamine. Propranolol alone had no effect on methacholine-induced bronchospasm. These data suggest that the major bronchodilatory property of histamine may be mediated indirectly via catecholamine release through an H2-receptor mechanism.", 
    "10": "Studies were carried out in 15 patients with renal insufficiency and hypertension to compare the long-term effects of methyldopa and propranolol on renal hemodynamics. Inulin and PAH clearance measurements were made under baseline conditions and four to six months of antihypertensive therapy with each of the two drugs. Eight of the 15 patients (group I) were started on methyldopa and then switched to propranolol; and in the other seven (group II), the sequence was reversed. There were no statistical differences in blood pressure or inulin or PAH clearances under baseline conditions between the two groups of patients. Blood pressure was controlled equally with the two drugs in combination with furosemide. In group I, there was no significant effect of either antihypertensive drug on inulin clearance, but PAH clearance was significantly higher during methyldopa than propranolol therapy. In group II, the same higher PAH clearance was found with methyldopa, even though the sequence of drug administration was opposite to that of group I. Challenge with iv furosemide resulted in a greater 3-hour natriuresis during methyldopa than propranolol treatment. The observations indicate that glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is not significantly affected by long-term treatment with methyldopa or propranolol but that renal plasma flow (RPF) is higher during treatment with methyldopa in patients with renal insufficiency and hypertension. The higher RPF apparently enhances the acute natriuretic effect of iv furosemide.", 
    "11": "In a long-term multicenter open randomized study of 103 patients with glaucoma or intraocular hypertension, oral propranolol combined with 2% pilocarpine was compared with 0.5% topical timolol also combined with 2% pilocarpine, with respect to the effects on intraocular pressure and other signs of glaucoma. The results showed that the hypotensive effects were highly significant and equal for both treatments. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in the amount of cupping of the nerve head or the visual field defects developing during treatment. An additive hypotensive effect was recorded when both propranolol and timolol were combined with pilocarpine, which indicates the development of tolerance to both beta-blockers. Pulse rate and blood pressure were moderately reduced in both groups, both significantly more so in the propranolol group. The investigation indicates that when combined with pilocarpine the 2 adrenergic beta-receptor blockers are equally effective. We believe that oral propranolol can improve drug compliance in the treatment of glaucoma.", 
    "12": "In 179 patients with anterior myocardial infarction the electrocardiographically estimated infarct size was related to serum enzyme activity. A precordial map containing 24 precordial positions and the peak activity of heat stable dehydrogenase (LD; EC 1.1.1.27) were used. A positive correlation was found between the area at risk (initial sum of ST-elevation) and the peak LD activity (r = 0.48 - 0.55; p less than 0.001). When the final Q-and R-wave amplitude were related to peak enzyme activity a better correlation was observed (r = 0.56 - 0.68; p less than 0.001). The sum of R-waves (sigma R) and the sum of Q-waves (sigma Q) in the 24 precordial leads were related to sigma R and sigma Q in five precordial standard leads. A good correlation was found between the two ECG methods (r = 0.75 - 0.83; p less than 0.001), indicating that an increased number of precordial leads gives information regarding the extent of infarction similar to that obtained with the routinely used standard leads. It is concluded that in the individual patient, serum enzyme activity and the final Q-and R-wave changes can give different information about infarct size. If, however, these two independent methods are used in a large number of patients in intervention studies they will probably give similar information about relative influence of the intervention on the mean infarct size.", 
    "13": "Ten patients with effort angina were studied in a randomized double-blind cross-over trial in order to investigate the effect of sustained release propranolol (LA) and conventional propranolol (Prop) formulations on exercise tolerance. LA was given once daily and Prop three times daily. Treadmill exercise tests were performed using the Bruce protocol and the plasma propranolol levels were measured. The following results were obtained: LA proved to have an anti-anginal effect similar to Prop. No adverse reactions were observed after administration of either of the drugs. Similar suppressive effect of the heart rate, blood pressure and double product at rest and on exercise was seen after LA and Prop while the exercise capacity was increased. The plasma level of propranolol was higher at 2 hours after Prop than LA administration, but there was no difference between LA and Prop at 4 and 24 hours after administration. The plasma propranolol level at 4 hours after LA correlated with the percent reduction in exercise heart rate and with the percent reduction in the double product. Our study suggested that once-a-day administration of LA could improve patients' compliance and adds another choice to the list of clinically useful beta-blockers for the treatment of angina pectoris on effort.", 
    "14": "The effect of topical timolol maleate on exercise performance was investigated in a randomized double-blind study. Healthy young subjects underwent two graded maximal exercise evaluations on a treadmill. The evaluations were given one week apart. Before each trial, the subjects were given a single drop of either placebo or 0.5% timolol maleate in each eye. The results indicate that topical timolol has a statistically significant effect on both maximal heart rate and time to exhaustion. However, we found that the drug had no effect on the physiologic parameters of Vo2, respiratory rate, Vco2, or respiratory quotient.", 
    "15": "To determine the effect of beta blockade with propranolol on myocardial oxygen demands and postoperative arrhythmias in patients having coronary bypass operations, 50 patients with chronic stable angina undergoing operation were randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive either propranolol (60 mg every 6 hours) or a placebo. Drug administration began 24 to 48 hours prior to operation and continued through the operative period and for one month after operation. There were no deaths. Two perioperative myocardial infarctions occurred, both in patients receiving a placebo. Myocardial oxygen demand as measured by the rate-pressure product (heart rate X mean arterial pressure) was significantly reduced during induction of anesthesia (7,658 +/- 451 versus 5,786 +/- 340; p less than 0.002) and during sternotomy (8,400 +/- 550 versus 6,756 +/- 384; p less than 0.02) in propranolol-treated patients. In the first two postoperative days, nitroprusside was required for control of hypertension of 10 patients in the placebo group but in only 3 patients given propranolol (p less than 0.05). Postoperatively, 15 of the 26 patients who received a placebo had 45 episodes of arrhythmia. Seven of the 24 propranolol-treated patients had 17 episodes (p less than 0.04). We conclude that propranolol given perioperatively in doses large enough to induce beta blockade significantly reduces myocardial oxygen demands in the vulnerable period during induction of anesthesia and sternotomy, reduces the need for antihypertensive therapy in the immediate postoperative period, and causes a marked reduction in the incidence and frequency of both supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias in the postoperative period.", 
    "16": "Portal hypertension related to hepatic cirrhosis produces significant alterations in portal blood flow, pressures, blood volume, and systemic hemodynamics. These alterations decrease portal blood flow to the hepatic parenchyma with measurable decreases in hepatic parenchymal function. The development of bleeding esophagogastric varices and the methods used to treat this complication are all unsatisfactory either in the short or long term. Portal systemic shunting, in particular, further decreases portal flow to the liver with deleterious effects on hepatic cellular function. Pharmacologic methods to decrease the risk of variceal bleeding are the most promising recent development in the care of these patients.",

    "18": "Failure of a plasma glucagon rise in response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia was demonstrated in normal subjects taking therapeutic doses of the nonselective beta-adrenergic blocker, propranolol, for 7 days before testing. This is the first study to examine glucose homeostasis in normal subjects exposed to chronic propranolol therapy and helps to explain the development of spontaneous hypoglycemia in patients, either diabetic or nondiabetic, during beta-adrenergic receptor blockade. Previous studies of the acute parenteral effects of propranolol administration failed to show any significant effect on glucagon secretory dynamics in response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia. In the present study, however, chronic oral administration of propranolol resulted in severe impairment of the expected glucagon rise in response to hypoglycemia and was associated with severe hypoglycemia in one normal subject.", 
    "19": "Intraoperative beta blockade has been evaluated as an adjunct to hypothermic cold blood potassium cardioplegia by quantitating serum creatine kinase MB release. Randomization of 80 patients having coronary artery bypass grafting and 18 patients having valve replacement with or without bypass grafting resulted in 46 of the former and seven of the latter receiving propranolol 0.05 mg/kg 4 to 5 minutes before aortic cross-clamping. Among patients having bypass grafting, infarct size (in gram-equivalents) was 7.9 +/- 0.7 gm-Eq for the propranolol group and 10.3 +/- 0.8 (p less than 0.05) for the control group. Ischemic times were 71.6 +/- 2.8 and 78.3 +/- 3/4 minutes (p = NS), respectively. In valve replacement, infarct size was 9.9 +/- 1.9 gm-Eq for those receiving propranolol and 12.6 +/- 2.0 (p = NS) for the control subjects; ischemic times were 99.4 +/- 12.5 and 80.5 +/- 5.7 minutes, respectively. When the two groups receiving propranolol were combined, infarct size was 8.2 +/- 0.6 gm-Eq versus 10.9 +/- 0.7 (p less than 0.01). When ischemic time was plotted against infarct size, analysis by linear regression revealed a significant correlation for patients receiving propranolol and having bypass grafting (p less than 0.01) and for all patients receiving propranolol (p less than 0.01). These data demonstrate a modest reduction of infarct size with intraoperative propranolol as an adjunct to our standard management of patients having aortic cross-clamping. Quantitation of creatine kinase MB release is the best clinically available method for assessing alterations in techniques of myocardial preservation.", 
    "20": "The histamine H2-agonist dimaprit was found to increase the response of rat spleen cells to the T-cell mitogen Concanavalin A, when present at concentrations of 10(-5) and 10(-4)M. Higher concentrations of dimaprit were cytotoxic. The enhanced response seemed to be associated with an inhibitory effect of dimaprit on T-suppressor cell activity rather than with a direct mitogen-like stimulation of lymphocyte proliferation or with an interference with monocyte/macrophage functions. The stimulatory effects of dimaprit were not reversed by the H2-receptor antagonist, cimetidine, nor by the beta-receptor antagonists metoprolol and H 35/25. Addition of the H1-receptor antagonist, mepyramine, further increased the stimulatory effect of dimaprit on lymphocyte responsiveness.", 
    "21": "In isolated tissues and anesthetized animals, beta- and alpha-adrenoceptor blocking properties of arotinolol were studied in comparison with those of other typical adrenoceptor antagonists. The following order of beta-adrenoceptor blocking activities were obtained in isolated tissues: arotinolol = pindolol greater than propranolol = oxprenolol = alprenolol greater than or equal to labetalol for beta 1-adrenoceptors (guinea-pig right atrium) and pindolol = oxprenolol = arotinolol greater than propranolol greater than labetalol for beta 2-adrenoceptors (guinea-pig trachea). In anesthetized cats, arotinolol was about 9 and 25 times more potent than propranolol, about 30 and 100 times more potent than labetalol in blocking beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors, respectively. Furthermore arotinolol showed a competitive antagonistic effect on phenylephrine-induced contraction of isolated rat aortic strips. The relative order of alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocking potencies was as follows: prazosin greater than phentolamine greater than labetalol greater than arotinolol = yohimbine. Presynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptor blocking action of arotinolol was also assessed in isolated rat vas deferens and arotinolol was revealed to be a much weaker presynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist. In anesthetized rats arotinolol was 4-5 times less potent than labetalol and about 26 times less potent than phentolamine in blocking alpha 1-adrenoceptors. Thus, as for the selectivity for 2 subtypes of alpha-adrenoceptors, arotinolol showed a selectivity for alpha 1-adrenoceptors over presynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "22": "The antiarrhythmic effect of nadolol, a long-acting, nonselective beta antagonist without intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane-stabilizing properties, was evaluated in 36 patients with ventricular dysrhythmias as determined by three baseline 24-hour Holter recordings at a time when subjects were receiving placebo. Nadolol was administered once daily at a dose of 40 to 80 mg and increased at weekly intervals to a maximum daily dose of 640 mg. Thereafter the drug was stopped gradually and placebo was given again for a period of 2 weeks. Nadolol was effective in reducing premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) in 17 of 36 patients (48%), in reducing ventricular couplets in 24 of 27 patients (89%), and in reducing nonsustained runs of ventricular tachycardia in all 13 subjects. Serum nadolol levels obtained at dosages resulting in a 75% reduction in PVCs varied from 58 to 853 ng/ml. In the majority of the subjects studied, a nadolol dosage of 160 mg/day or less was effective for arrhythmia suppression.", 
    "23": "Carvedilol (BM 14190) is a new antihypertensive compound which combines beta-adrenoceptor blocking and precapillary vasodilating properties but is devoid of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. The acute and long-term effects on blood pressure and regional haemodynamics (forearm plethysmography) were studied with carvedilol 25 mg b.i.d. or 50 mg b.i.d. Comparisons were made with propranolol 80 mg b.i.d. in a randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial comprised of 30 patients with essential hypertension. After a four-week placebo period active therapy was given for four weeks. Carvedilol administered acutely reduced blood pressure at both doses, delta 13/6 mmHg (P less than 0.001/P less than 0.01) and 17/10 mmHg (P less than 0.001/P less than 0.01). Resistance in the forearm fell significantly with the higher dose. This was in contrast to propranolol which only reduced heart rate acutely, and as expected caused a rise in forearm resistance. After four weeks both compounds had reduced blood pressure significantly and to the same extent. Blood flow was still significantly reduced with propranolol in contrast to the findings with carvedilol. We conclude that carvedilol given orally has a useful antihypertensive effect both acutely and during prolonged treatment. It is well tolerated and its haemodynamic profile is attractive.", 
    "24": "Eccrine sweat secretion is studied during physical stress after the administration of a B-blocking agent: Butofilolol. 20 voluntary normotensive subjects, age 24 + 2 ans are submitted to 2 exercises stress test (ergometric bicycle) performed at on week interval. Butofilolol is administrated at a posology of 200 mg, 24 hours and 2 hours, before the test as well as placebo (double blind). Local sweat output is measured 1 min after stress and in the interscapulary region with an evaporimeter. Sweat weight, sweat electrolyte concentrations (sodium, chloride) are analysed from filters papers placed on the forehead. With butofilolol, significative increases of sweet output (+13%), sweat weight (+20%), and sodium (+20%), chloride (+26%) elimination are observed. The subjective observation of the effects of B-blocking agents is confirmed. The way of action of Butofilolol discussed.", 
    "25": "A more precise knowledge of cardiovascular activity in rats needs its direct recording for long periods of time, in conscious unrestrained animals. A system has been developed, which allows direct recording of blood pressure (BP) in freely moving rats, by means of a floating catheter chronically inserted in the abdominal aorta, connected to a rotating swivel, and then to a pressure transducer. A mini-computer performs on-line processing of BP curves, and stores the values of 5 cardiovascular parameters on hard disk: systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressures, heart rate and dp/dt max. Off line processing allows graphic and statistical analysis of the data. Simultaneously recording from two rats is very useful in pharmacology because a treated animal and a control one are studied at the same time and in the same conditions. This methodology was used to evaluate the effects of a chronic treatment (2 mg/kg, ip, during 8 days) and of single injections (0.5 and 3 mg/kg, iv) of a new antihypertensive substance, CM 40441a, in 15 W old males SHR.", 
    "26": "Left ventricular infarction (AMI) was produced in experimental animals and the contractile response to beta-adrenergic and H2-histaminergic stimulation by isoproterenol and impromidine tested in the isolated perfused heart preparation. Adenylate cyclase activity as well as binding characteristics of [3H]-dihydroalprenolol ([3H]-DHA), [3H]-methyl-tiotidine ([3H]-TIOT) and [3H]-quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]-QNB) to cardiac beta 1-, H2- and cholinergic muscarinic receptors were determined in sarcolemmal membrane preparations of the right ventricle of the same hearts. In addition, an attempt was made to elucidate the therapeutic value of post-AMI treatment with impromidine in the presence and absence of beta-blockade, in contrast to administration of prenalterol and the conventional therapy with beta-sympathomimetic drugs, e.g. dobutamine. Three days post-AMI the dose-response curve for isoproterenol of right ventricular dP/dtmax was significantly depressed, while the inotropic effect of impromidine was not impaired. Stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity by isoproterenol was reduced by 80% whereas impromidine and NaF stimulation rates were unaltered. Receptor-binding studies indicated a 90% loss and 10-times lowered affinity (KD) of the remaining beta-receptors while specific [3H]-TIOT- and [3H]-QNB-binding was unchanged. Administration of dobutamine increased mortality rates and extension of infarct size, led to a further decrease in contractile response to isoproterenol, induced complete insensitivity of adenylate cyclase to isoproterenol stimulation and caused pronounced additional reduction of number and affinity of [3H]-DHA-binding sites. In contrast, all above alterations were prevented by treatment with either prenalterol or combined administration of impromidine plus metoprolol. It is concluded, that these alterations in the non-ischemic, uninvolved myocardium post-AMI are the result of catecholamine-induced specific damage of sarcolemmal beta-receptors. Furthermore, treatment with H2-agonists in combination with beta-blocking agents may have beneficial effects, whereas conventional therapy with beta-sympathomimetic drugs tends to worsen the already depressed function of the beta-adrenergic stimulation mechanism.", 
    "27": "Our previous investigations have indicated that beta 2-adrenergic regulatory mechanisms contribute to important compensatory hemodynamic adjustments in hemorrhage. In the present study an attempt was made to examine, by comparative observations after standardized fatal hemorrhage on cats with intact and 'selectively' blocked beta 2-adrenoceptors (ICI 118,551), whether such compensatory effects are crucial for survival. On the average, the survival time after bleeding was 686 min in cats with intact and 427 min in cats with blocked beta 2-adrenoceptors (p less than 0.05), the difference thus approaching 4.5 h. It is suggested that the reduced survival time after beta 2-blockade, at least partly, can be ascribed to interference with the circulatory beta 2-adrenergic control in hemorrhage aimed at improving tissue perfusion.", 
    "28": "The clinical effect of beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs lasts longer than the respective half lives in plasma will suggest. This apparent discrepancy is easily explained by a superposition of the function of plasma concentration kinetics and the function for competitive antagonism at beta-adrenoceptors according to the law of mass action. By taking clinical data from the literature and by using results from ligand binding studies simultaneously, this was confirmed. Furthermore, it can be stated: 1) The plasma concentrations are representative for the drug concentration at the beta-adrenoceptor sites: Dissociation of beta-blockers from the receptor site is a much faster process than elimination from plasma and thus does not prolong effects. 2) Extent of beta-adrenoceptor blocking effect in vivo can be predicted from ligand binding studies based on the respective drug concentration in plasma. If the kinetics of the drug in plasma is known, the time course of effect can be delineated. 3) Only deviations from the above function describing the time course of effect may be indicative for active metabolites or additional compartments of drug distribution. Furthermore, deviations should occur if additional drug effects (e.g. partial agonist activity) are present. In general, any drug acting on the basis of the law of mass action should obey the described relation between the time course of plasma concentration and clinical effect (e.g. cardiac glycosides).", 
    "29": "The beta-receptors were isolated from rat cardiac myocytes and characterized. Isolated myocytes were prepared from adult rat hearts and characterized for viability. Membrane proteins were solubilized from myocytes with 1% Triton X-102. The solubilized membrane proteins were fractionated by DEAE-Sephacel ion exchange column chromatography. Two major protein peaks were obtained. The second protein peak sample was found to contain beta-receptors to which 125I-15-(4'-azido-3'-iodobenzyl)-carazolol (125I-ABC) was specifically bound. This sample was labeled covalently with 125I-ABC by UV irradiation. The radiolabeled sample was applied to a Sepharose CL-6B gel column. Two radiolabeled protein peaks, one with a molecular weight of approximately 570,000 and the other with a molecular weight of approximately 95,000 were found. When the 570,000-dalton complex was subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) under reducing conditions, it was dissociated into a component with a molecular weight of 66,000. The 95,000-dalton complex was dissociated into a 58,000-dalton component upon SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. An excess amount of isoproterenol and propranolol decreased photolabeling of the beta-receptors with 125I-ABC by 60% and 40%, respectively.", 
    "30": "We compared the ventilatory effects of prenalterol (beta 1-selective adrenoceptor agonist) with those of salbutamol (beta 2-selective adrenoceptor agonist) in 6 healthy volunteers. Two intravenous doses of prenalterol (1 mg/60 min, 2 mg/60 min) and of salbutamol (300 micrograms/60 min, 600 micrograms/60 min) were given in random order in 4 separate sessions of 60 minutes each. Pulmonary ventilation per minute (V'E) increased only on the high dose of salbutamol. Mouth occlusion pressure (P0.1) did not vary either on prenalterol or on salbutamol. Only the high dose of salbutamol induced (1) an increase in tidal volume (VT) without changes in respiratory rate (RR), (2) an increase in mean inspiratory flow (VT/Ti) without changes in the fraction of inspiratory time to total cycle duration (Ti/Ttot). During forced expiration, salbutamol elicited a small bronchodilating effect at the level of both large (FEV1, FEF25-75, FEF50) and small (FEV3, FEF75-85, FEF75) airways. Prenalterol induced a very small dilatation of the large airways, and a somewhat more pronounced effect at the level of the small airways. Neither the indexes of ventilatory pattern nor those of bronchial tone showed any statistical or biological differences between values on prenalterol and values on salbutamol. However, both the former and the latter indexes showed a trend to be higher on salbutamol than on prenalterol. Results suggest that salbutamol-induced increase in pulmonary ventilation per minute in subjects without bronchial obstruction is likely the result of a reduced bronchomotor tone at rest, leading to an increase in tidal volume because of the rise in the VT/Ti ratio.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "31": "The binding characteristics of 3H-dihydroalprenolol and 125I-iodocyanopindolol have been compared in a particulate fraction from regenerating rat liver. When total 3H-dihydroalprenolol binding and inhibition of total 3H-dihydroalprenolol binding by (-)isoprenaline, (-)alprenolol and (+/-)cyanopindolol was investigated, it was found that all agents were bound to two classes of saturable binding sites. In the inhibition studies, the presence of two binding components was not obvious until the data were transformed into Hofstee plots and these were decomposed, except in the case of (+/-)cyanopindolol. Only (+/-)cyanopindolol was found to distinguish clearly between the two saturable binding sites identified by 3H-dihydroalprenolol, as indicated by a broad plateau in the inhibition curve. When 125I-iodocyanopindolol was used as radioligand, only one saturable binding site was identified, even in the presence of less selective inhibiting ligands. The lower affinity component of 3H-dihydroalprenolol binding could be inhibited by 10 microM phentolamine. However, binding experiments with 3H-prazosin indicated that the lower affinity component was not identical with the alpha-adrenoceptor. Phentolamine did not influence 125I-iodocyanopindolol binding. Thus, due to its higher specific activity and a high degree of selectivity, 125I-iodocyanopindolol appears to be the ligand of choice.", 
    "32": "Previous studies in man have shown that hyperventilation consistently enhances the amplitude of the electroretinogram (ERG) b-wave, but has little effect on the a-wave. The present study examined this phenomenon in the dog; central (centrifugal) and peripheral (sympathetic) neural effects and changes in arterial pO2 and blood pH were excluded as physiologic bases for the phenomenon. It was concluded, therefore, that the underlying mechanism must be decreased pCO2 (hypocapnia), although the specific site of action and the method by which the ERG b-wave is enhanced remain topics for future research.", 
    "33": "Agents with predominantly adrenergic antagonistic properties (the alpha-blockers, phentolamine and tolazoline, and the beta-blocker propranolol), and those with suspected alpha-blocking capabilities [hydralazine and 3,3'-(4,4'-biphenylene)bis(2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium chloride) (neotetrazolium chloride); I] were added individually to a bath containing an isolated Mercenaria mercenaria heart. Two and one-half minutes later, dopamine was added to the bath as the second drug and cardiac responses were noted. Pretreatment with saline controls, followed by dopamine 2.5 min later, produced results that were identical with those which occurred after the administration of dopamine alone, i.e., marked stimulation and cardiac arrest. Pretreatment with phentolamine and I were the only procedures that prevented dopamine-induced cardiac arrest. Phentolamine, tolazoline, and hydralazine generally produced positive inotropic responses when initially added to the bath, whereas propranolol mimicked the effects caused by the addition of dopamine alone or after saline pretreatment. The M. mercenaria heart appears to possess an adrenergic receptor of an alpha-configuration.", 
    "34": "The effects of propranolol and related drugs were investigated on ouabain-induced ventricular tachycardia (VT) in dogs with intact and ablated vagi. Propranolol and UM-272 completely antagonized the ouabain VT in dogs with intact vagi, whereas timolol was ineffective. Bilateral vagotomy completely abolished the effect of UM-272 and reduced the effect of propranolol. Diphenylhydantoin, however, reversed ouabain VT in dogs with both intact and ablated vagi. It is inferred that the vagus plays a significant role in the arrhythmolytic effect of propranolol and UM-272.", 
    "35": "In transmurally stimulated guinea-pig ileal preparations, the pA2 values obtained with the selective beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonists atenolol and ICI 118,551 were independent of the beta-adrenoceptor agonist used [-)-isoprenaline or fenoterol) and were similar to values reported in isolated cardiac tissue. On the basis of these results, the relaxant responses to beta-adrenoceptor agonists in guinea-pig ileal preparations appear to be mediated by an homogeneous population of beta 1-adrenoceptors.", 
    "36": "The risk of malignant arrhythmias during myocardial infarction is greatly increased in patients with diuretic-induced hypokalaemia. In our study an increased risk was seen also in hypokalaemic patients not treated with diuretics. This indicates that hypokalaemia as such could trigger malignant arrhythmias. The frequency of hypokalaemia was much higher (22.5%) in diuretic-treated infarct patients than in those not treated with diuretics (12.9%). Thus, hypokalaemia should be avoided in diuretic-treated patients with increased risk of myocardial infarction. The incidence of malignant arrhythmias in hypokalaemic patients was 13.2% in those treated with non-selective beta-blockers on admission versus 26.1% in those treated with selective beta-blockers; corresponding figures in infarctions with serum potassium concentrations above 3.6 mmol/L were 9.4% and 10.4%, respectively. Non-selective beta-blockers reduced the frequency of malignant arrhythmias in hypokalaemic infarctions. This was in contrast to selective beta-blockers, which had no favourable effect on the frequency of malignant arrhythmias in hypokalaemic infarctions. Non-selective beta-blockers did not completely counteract the hypokalaemia. Still, the risk of malignant arrhythmias decreased. Thus, our study indicates that apart from hypokalaemia, some additional mechanism specifically linked to adrenaline stimulation in important for the development of malignant arrhythmias in acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "37": "Neuropharmacological analysis of previously revealed antihypoxic activity of benzodiazepines (BDZ) has been performed in experiments on mice exposed to hypoxia. Antihypoxic effect of diazepam is shown to be antagonized by the central BDZ receptor blocker, Ro 15-1788. A certain degree of antihypoxic activity also abolished by Ro 15-1788 is exhibited by hypothetical ligands of BDZ receptors: inosin, nicotinamide, ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate. The effect of dipyridamole, a drug with high affinity for BDZ receptors of the peripheral type is not antagonized by Ro 15-1788, another evidence of Ro 15-1788 affinity precisely to the central BDZ receptors. GABA-mimetics (muscimol and GABA cetyl ester) were also found to have marked antihypoxic activity. Unlike BDZ receptor agonists, this effect is reduced by bicuculline and not by Ro 15-1788. The data obtained suggest that antihypoxic activity of BDZ is caused by their direct interaction with the central BDZ receptors, probably with the type which is not modulated by GABAA receptors.", 
    "38": "The effect of nadolol, a peripherally acting beta-adrenergic blocker, on resting, postural, and intention tremor was examined in 8 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease whose motor symptoms, other than tremor, were well controlled with conventional medications. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design, patients received 80 to 320 mg of nadolol for six weeks while continuing their previous therapeutic regimen. Accelerometer readings showed a 34% reduction (p less than 0.025) in tremor distance, but no change in tremor frequency, during nadolol therapy. Maximum benefit was achieved with a dose of 240 mg, when resting tremor improved 54%, postural tremor 32%, and intention tremor 54%. Physician ratings and patient reports supported the accelerometer results. Nadolol appears to be a safe, effective adjunct to current dopaminergic and anticholinergic therapy for severe tremor in Parkinson's disease.", 
    "39": "This study was conducted to investigate the possible involvement of the vascular renin-angiotensin system in the isoproterenol (ISO)-induced facilitation of adrenergic neurotransmission in the mesenteric vasculature. The isolated, perfused mesenteric vascular beds from normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were used for these studies. ISO at concentrations from 10(-9) to 10(-6) M caused significantly greater enhancement of the pressor response to periarterial nerve stimulation (PNS) in preparations from SHR than in those from WKY. The pressor responses to exogenous norepinephrine (NE) were, however, inhibited by ISO to a similar degree in preparations from both WKY and SHR. The enhancement of the PNS response produced by ISO was markedly attenuated by propranolol at 5 X 10(-7) M (nonselective beta receptor blocker) and by ICI 118,551 at 5 X 10(-7) M (selective beta-2 receptor blocker), whereas practolol at 5 X 10(-6) M (selective beta-1 receptor blocker) caused a potentiation of the ISO-induced enhancement of responses to PNS in preparations from both WKY and SHR. All three beta blockers generally abolished the ISO-induced inhibition of the pressor responses to exogenous NE. The selective beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonists, salbutamol (3 X 10(-8) to 3 X 10(-7) M) and terbutaline (10(-7) to 3 X 10(-7) M), caused significantly greater enhancement of the PNS response in preparations from SHR than in those from WKY, whereas the selective beta-1 agonist, dobutamine, caused only inhibition of the PNS responses in preparations from both WKY and SHR. These three agonists all tended to reduce the pressor responses to exogenous NE. The ISO-induced enhancement of the responses to PNS was also significantly reduced by either captopril (5 X 10(-6) M) or [Sar1-Ile8]angiotensin II (5 X 10(-7) M) in preparations from SHR. Neither captopril nor [Sar1-lle8] angiotensin II had an effect on the pressor response to NE infusion or on the ISO-induced inhibition of NE responses. Angiotensin I produced an enhancement of the pressor responses to PNS and to NE infusion with the effect being greater on the response to PNS than to NE in the preparations from SHR but not in those from WKY. This enhancement of the PNS response by angiotensin I was abolished by either captopril (5 X 10(-7) M) or [Sar1-Ile8]angiotensin II (5 X 10(-7) M) in preparations from both WKY and SHR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "40": "The subdivision of alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor-mediated pressor responses to different agonists based upon the influence of beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilatation was further investigated in the pithed normotensive rat. The effect of salbutamol (4.18 X 10(-6) mol/kg) on the alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated increase in diastolic pressure due to dopamine and amidephrine as well as on the alpha 2-adrenoceptor-mediated pressor response to azepexole, DP-6,7-ADTN, M-7, TL-99 and dopamine was assessed. The alpha 1-pressor responses to amidephrine and dopamine were only slightly attenuated by salbutamol. The alpha 2-adrenoceptor-mediated increase in diastolic pressure due to B-HT 933 was strongly antagonized by salbutamol in contrast to the effect of dopamine, DP-6,7-ADTN and M-7. TL-99 occupied in intermediate position. The data do not support the existence of distinctly different subtypes of alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors but favor the hypothesis that both alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors are activated in a unique way by each of their respective agonists.", 
    "41": "The effects of prazosin, labetalol, and medroxalol were studied in the rabbit sino-atrial node, Purkinje cells and papillary muscles. At concentrations producing similar bradycardia, labetalol and medroxalol reduced the maximum rate of depolarization (Vmax) and overshoot potential in the sinus node. Prazosin had no such effects. These large and highly significant reductions in Vmax and overshoot in sinus node cells were observed at concentrations of medroxalol and labetalol which had no negative inotropic effect. If depolarization in the sinus node was due to the second inward current, this would imply that such currents in the sinus node and contracting cardiac muscle are pharmacologically distinct. All three drugs prolonged action potential duration in the sinus node, Purkinje cells and papillary muscles in a dose-related manner. Recovery after 1 h in drug-free solution from the effects of medroxalol and labetalol was only partial in the sinus node, but almost complete in Purkinje cells and papillary muscle. Recovery from prazosin was complete in all tissues. All three drugs depressed Vmax in Purkinje cells and papillary muscles in a dose-related manner, and recovery was complete. It is concluded that all three drugs had class 1 and class 3 antiarrhythmic actions, which could contribute to their protective effects in ischaemia and reperfusion independently of blockade of myocardial alpha-adrenoceptors.", 
    "42": "A study of forearm arterial and venous hemodynamics by pulsed Doppler velocimetry and plethysmography was performed in 21 patients with essential hypertension, aged 16 to 54 years, before and after short-term nadolol administration at a dose of 0.05 mg/kg. Because of a large intersubject variability in the responses of the hemodynamic parameters to nadolol, an unconventional statistic approach was used to divide the overall population of patients into two homogeneous groups. The first included nine patients (group 1) and the second 12 patients (group 2). In patients of group 1, nadolol significantly decreased the systolic blood pressure (p less than 0.001), venous tone (p less than 0.01), and brachial artery flow (p less than 0.05). In patients of group 2, nadolol did not affect any forearm parameters. Each group of patients was compared to an age- and pressure-matched group of patients receiving propranolol at equiblocking doses. Contrary to nadolol, propranolol was found to increase significantly the forearm vascular resistance in patients of groups 1 and 2 (90 +/- 19%, p less than 0.001; 63 +/- 10%, p less than 0.001, respectively). Thus the hemodynamic beta-blocking effects of nadolol in the forearm were less marked than those of propranolol, suggesting that the effects of acute beta blockade by nadolol could be offset by other effects, such as a peripheral partial-agonist effect.", 
    "43": "The effect of nadolol, a peripherally acting beta-adrenergic blocker, on resting tremor was examined in eight patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. With the use of a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of crossover design, patients received 80 to 320 mg of nadolol for 6 weeks while continuing their previous treatment regimen. Accelerometer readings showed a progressive reduction in tremor amplitude, but no change in tremor frequency, with increasing nadolol dosage. Maximum benefit was achieved at 240 mg, when resting tremor improved 50% (p less than 0.01). Physician ratings confirmed these findings. The results suggest that response to beta-adrenergic blockade may not be limited to postural or intention tremor and that such agents may not reliably differentiate between the tremor of Parkinson's disease and essential tremor.", 
    "44": "Twelve cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension and esophageal varices were treated with nadolol for 1 month, and the effects on renal and hepatic hemodynamics and function were studied. A significant decrease in cardiac output, portohepatic gradient, and effective hepatic blood flow was found, whereas mean arterial pressure, liver function, effective renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, and urinary sodium and potassium excretions were not affected. In seven patients esophageal varices were also reduced. A significant correlation was found between the decrease in portohepatic gradient and that in cardiac output. The percentage of cardiac output distributed to the kidneys was significantly increased after nadolol treatment. In conclusion, nadolol seems to have properties useful for the treatment of portal hypertension in patients with liver cirrhosis.", 
    "45": "For a comparison of propranolol and nadolol pharmacokinetics and clinical effects, 20 newly diagnosed patients with thyrotoxicosis were randomly selected to receive as sole therapy, either propranolol, 40 mg every 6 hours for 14 days, or nadolol, 80 mg each morning for 14 days. The study was repeated when the patients were in the euthyroid state. There was a similar and highly significant degree of beta blockade and amelioration of symptoms of thyrotoxicosis at the end of the dosage interval (trough), i.e., 24 hours after nadolol or 6 to 8 hours after propranolol. Trough and peak serum levels of propranolol were significantly lower when the patients were in a thyrotoxic state than when they were in a euthyroid state, whereas the pharmacokinetics of nadolol were not appreciably altered by thyrotoxicosis. In thyrotoxicosis, trough levels of propranolol and nadolol were significantly inversely correlated with derived creatinine clearance values. In the symptomatic treatment of thyrotoxicosis, nadolol, a once-daily nonmetabolized beta blocker, has certain advantages compared with propranolol. It is preferred by patients, is more convenient, and probably aids compliance.", 
    "46": "Forty-eight patients (13 men and 35 women) took part in a double-blind randomized study. All patients received a placebo daily for 4 weeks (period A), at the end of which the frequency and severity of headaches experienced by each patient were assessed. Patients then received an active drug for 12 weeks (period B). Sixteen patients received nadolol, 80 mg/day; 16 received nadolol, 160 mg/day; and 16 received propranolol, 160 mg/day. The frequency and severity of headaches in the three groups were tabulated at the end of period B, as were the side effects. Only three subjects dropped out during the study, and one of these needed abdominal surgery. All three groups reported improvement, the most noticeable being in those patients who received 80 mg of nadolol daily.", 
    "47": "The effects of 40 mg nadolol versus 2 mg diazepam on performance anxiety of 33 young music students were determined. The study had a double-blind, crossover design and was placebo controlled. Nadolol attenuated the rise in pulse rate caused by anxiety and improved those aspects of string playing that can be adversely affected by tremor. There was also a tendency for other functions requiring coordination and judgment to improve. No effect on anxiety was noted for nadolol or for 2 mg diazepam. Diazepam, however, did cause some minor deterioration of performance that was not related to anxiety change. These findings, taken with others, suggest that beta-adrenoceptor-blocking drugs such as nadolol have an important role in the correction of anxiety-induced disturbances of performance. Indeed, their use under such circumstances probably is preferable to that of the benzodiazepines.", 
    "48": "Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), renal blood flow (RBF), and renal vascular resistance (RVR) were determined before and during an infusion of propranolol (18 mg/kg/hr) or nadolol (30 mg/kg/hr) in anesthetized Munich-Wistar rats with normal cardiac function. Eight rats treated with propranolol had significant reductions in MAP (110 to 98 mm Hg; p less than 0.05) and HR (316 to 242 bpm; p less than 0.01), accompanied by a 24% decrease in RBF (5.9 to 4.5 ml/min; p less than 0.05) and a 22% increase in RVR (19.4 to 23.7 mm Hg/ml/min; p less than 0.05). Although nadolol also reduced MAP (104 to 93 mm Hg; p less than 0.01) and HR (315 to 268 bpm; p less than 0.05) in eight other rats, RBF and RVR remained unchanged from baseline levels. Thus, despite similar decrements in MAP and HR, propranolol decreased renal perfusion, whereas nadolol maintained it in animals with noninfarcted myocardium. These parameters were also evaluated in rats with congestive heart failure induced by myocardial infarction at least 3 weeks prior to their receiving either propranolol (18 mg/kg/hr; n = 6) or nadolol (30 mg/kg/hr; n = 6). In the basal state, rats with congestive heart failure had significantly (p less than 0.05) lower MAP, HR, and RBF and higher (p less than 0.01) RVR compared with control rats. Propranolol and nadolol induced comparable falls (p less than 0.05) in MAP and HR. Whereas RBF tended to fall with propranolol (3.3 to 2.4 ml/min), renal perfusion was well maintained with nadolol (3.4 to 3.8 ml/min).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "49": "Renal and systemic hemodynamic effects of nadolol, a nonselective beta-adrenergic-blocking agent, were determined over a 2-year period in eight patients with essential hypertension. Arterial pressure and heart rate remained significantly reduced for the full 2 years in all eight patients. Renal blood flow and plasma volume remained unchanged, and renal vascular resistance significantly decreased. Serum creatinine levels decreased from pretreatment values, suggesting improved glomerular filtration rates. These data demonstrate the favorable renal hemodynamic effects of nadolol monotherapy in patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension during a prolonged treatment program.", 
    "50": "Two-hundred ninety-one patients with hypertension and 313 patients with angina pectoris were enrolled and treated with nadolol for up to 2 years. The efficacy of nadolol in hypertension and angina was maintained over the 2-year period. Discontinuation because of an adverse reaction occurred with 8.3% of the hypertensive patients and 8.6% of the angina patients. The observed reactions were typical of those which occur with beta-blocking drugs. Serum creatinine levels fell significantly (p less than 0.05) after 12 months of treatment for both the angina and hypertensive patients. After 24 months of treatment the serum creatinine levels had decreased 20% from baseline (p less than 0.001). Blood urea nitrogen levels fell in the angina patients after 12 months of treatment but not in the hypertensive patients. Nadolol is safe and effective for the long-term treatment of both hypertension and angina. Renal function, as measured by serum creatinine levels, improved with long-term treatment.", 
    "51": "The duration of action of three beta blockers (atenolol in nine patients, nadolol in 18 patients, and pindolol in 11 patients) administered once a day was studied in three cohorts of patients with angina on effort. Compared with single-blind run-in placebo, all three beta blockers decreased angina frequency (p less than 0.01), exercise tolerance (p less than 0.01), heart rate recorded by ambulatory ECG, and submaximal heart rate when a treadmill exercise stress test was performed 3 hours after administration of the daily dose (p less than 0.0001). Twenty-four hours after the dose, the percentage of the maximal heart rate-attenuating effect was highest for nadolol (pharmacokinetic half-life, 15.5 hours), followed by atenolol and then by pindolol (half-life, 5.5 hours). A linear relationship between the logarithm of plasma concentration of beta blocker and the heart rate at submaximal exercise (r = 0.72 and p = 0.0001 for nadolol; r = 0.50 and p = 0.0001 for pindolol) was observed. The data suggest that in the treatment of angina on effort, beta blockers should be prescribed according to their pharmacokinetic properties to achieve adequate suppression of the heart rate during exercise.", 
    "52": "Nadolol, a long-acting beta-adrenergic-blocking agent, was evaluated in 20 patients with chronic atrial fibrillation by means of a randomized, double-blind, crossover study. Patients were required either to demonstrate resting heart rates in excess of 80 bpm or to show a rate of 120 bpm or an increment of greater than 50 bpm during mild treadmill exercise provocation (3 minutes, 1.75 mph, 10% grade). With placebo the group averaged a heart rate of 92 +/- 19 bpm, determined by 24 hours of ambulatory ECG recordings; this rate was significantly reduced to 73 +/- 16 bpm (p less than 0.001) with nadolol (mean dosage, 87 +/- 43 mg/day). During standardized exercise testing, heart rates increased to 153 +/- 26 bpm with placebo and to 111 +/- 24 bpm with nadolol (p less than 0.001), representing 65% and 52% increments, respectively. Digoxin blood levels averaged 0.8 +/- 0.5 ng/ml with placebo and were similar with nadolol (0.9 +/- 0.4; p = NS). Total exercise time on a modified Bruce treadmill protocol was 466 +/- 143 seconds with placebo and was significantly decreased by nadolol (380 +/- 143; p less than 0.01). During initial dose titration with nadolol, one patient was dropped from study for intolerable fatigue and one for worsened claudication. No patients were dropped from the double-blind treatment periods, although two patients receiving nadolol and one patient receiving placebo complained of moderate fatigue. We conclude that nadolol is a safe and effective agent for the control of spontaneous and exercise-provoked heart rates in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation who were already receiving digoxin treatment.", 
    "53": "Beta-adrenoceptor-blocking agents reduce beta-adrenergic activity and depress sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodal conduction. These agents are thus useful for controlling supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. For the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias, beta-adrenoceptor-blocking agents possess antifibrillatory properties, depress diastolic depolarization of ectopic pacemaker activity, reduce electrical instability associated with prolongation of the QT interval, and are specifically effective in suppressing ventricular arrhythmias that are rate (tachycardia) dependent and/or caused by catecholamine-sensitive automaticity. Furthermore, beneficial hemodynamic effects of beta-adrenoceptor blockade on ischemic myocardium may also contribute to the antiarrhythmic potency of these agents.", 
    "54": "The effects of nadolol (N) and propranolol (P) were studied in atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Interpretation of the results should take into account the dependence of the arrhythmia on the sympathetic tone, and the drug effect on the sinus node frequency. The day/night ratio of the sinus rate is too sensitive a marker of beta blockade to evidence a difference between the two drugs at usual dosages. In contrast, even slight differences (2 to 4 bpm/24 hr) in the absolute value of cardiac frequency may be significant in homogeneous groups of patients treated with high, moderate or low dosages of P or N and, for the latter, on a short- or long-term basis. In 22 of 23 cases of idiopathic adrenergic-dependent atrial tachycardia or fibrillation that were resistant to P (160 mg/day), N (160 mg/day) was effective on a short-term basis, whereas 11 cases of vagally induced atrial flutter-fibrillation were more aggravated by N than by P. However, after 2 weeks to 2 months, 15 of 22 adrenergic-dependent atrial tachyarrhythmias escaped from the initial control, and type I antiarrhythmic agents had to be combined with N. The absence or loss of efficacy of the beta-blocking treatment coincides with the different short-term effects of P and N on the sinus rate and with the different short-term and long-term effects of N. Better efficacy of N over P was also found at the ventricular level when two groups of adrenergic-dependent (nine patients) or nonadrenergic-dependent (10 patients) ventricular tachyarrhythmias of nonischemic origin were compared. At this level, no escape phenomenon was observed. In conclusion, the antiarrhythmic effect of beta blockers essentially depends on the mechanism of the arrhythmia itself. The changes in the sinus rate values reflect the degree of beta blockade, and the antiarrhythmic efficacy depends not only on the dosage but also on the nature of the drug used.", 
    "55": "The pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of nadolol were evaluated in hypertensive patients maintained on long-term hemodialysis. In nine patients the plasma elimination half-life of unchanged nadolol averaged 26 hours following a single 40 mg oral dose during the interdialytic period. Nineteen patients received nadolol once after each dialysis session. In addition, 12 of the 19 patients also received hydralazine and/or furosemide daily. Predialysis blood pressures and heart rates were significantly lower with nadolol than with combination or single therapy with conventional antihypertensive drugs, including other beta blockers. Nadolol administered only after each dialysis session (i.e., two or three times a week), in conjunction with hydralazine and/or furosemide, is an effective antihypertensive agent in hypertensive patients receiving long-term hemodialysis.", 
    "56": "A series of studies on various therapeutic aspects of beta-adrenergic-blocking drugs was carried out by the Veterans Administration Cooperative Study Group on Antihypertensive Agents. In one study the diastolic blood pressures of 49% of 132 men with mild to moderate hypertension were controlled (less than 90 mm Hg) with once-daily nadolol. In a similar group, 85% were controlled with nadolol plus bendroflumethiazide, both given once daily. Nadolol alone was as effective as diuretic alone, although in another study comparing propranolol and hydrochlorothiazide, the latter was somewhat more effective. In both trials black patients tended to respond better to the diuretic, whereas white patients responded better to the beta blocker. Although high-renin hypertensive patients tended to respond better to the beta blocker and low-renin patients to the diuretic, the relationships were not close enough to provide a dependable guide to treatment. Sixty percent of patients whose blood pressure was not controlled on the nadolol-containing regimens reached goal blood pressure (less than 90 mm Hg) with the addition of hydralazine, 25 to 100 mg twice daily.", 
    "57": "Plasma levels of nadolol and propranolol following a single 80 mg dose of each beta blocker in the presence and absence of cimetidine were determined in 12 healthy male subjects. Cimetidine increased (p less than 0.01) the area under the plasma concentration-time curve and peak plasma levels of propranolol by 46% and 35%, respectively. Nadolol kinetics were not altered significantly by cimetidine, except for a reduction in time to reach peak concentrations. The higher blood levels of propranolol during administration of cimetidine were not associated with any changes in resting blood pressure or heart rate compared with propranolol alone. Cimetidine had no effect on elimination half-lives or apparent mean residence times for either beta blocker.", 
    "58": "First, blood pressure and heart rate variability was studied in 89 normotensive and hypertensive ambulatory subjects with the use of an intra-arterial monitoring device. Short- and long-term variabilities were analyzed by computer. Absolute variabilities (standard deviations) were greatest in patients with hypertension, but relative variabilities (variation coefficients, i.e., standard deviations as percent of means) were slightly lower in the subjects with more severe hypertension. Second, the effect of nadolol on 24-hour blood pressure and heart rate values and on their variability was assessed in seven ambulatory patients with essential hypertension by means of the same intra-arterial device and computer analysis. Two recording sessions were performed (1) without treatment and (2) after 10 days' administration of nadolol once a day (dose range, 80 to 320 mg). Nadolol, given once a day, was shown to reduce blood pressure uniformly throughout the 24-hour period without loss of activity in the hours farthest from administration. The lack of alteration in relative blood pressure variability suggests that nadolol lowers blood pressure without interfering with the mechanisms involved in cardiovascular homeostasis. Reduction in heart rate variability after nadolol suggests less chance of tachycardia episodes in patients with angina and/or arrhythmias receiving nadolol.", 
    "59": "All of the beta blockers act by antagonizing the actions of the endogenous adrenergic agonists epinephrine and norepinephrine at the beta-adrenergic receptors. However, a number of pharmacologic differences exist between the various agents. Some drugs, such as atenolol and metoprolol, are relatively selective for the beta-1-adrenergic receptors, requiring higher concentrations to block beta-2-adrenergic receptors than are required to block beta-1 receptors. It should be noted, however, that these selective beta blockers all block beta-2 receptors when their concentrations are high enough. When patients with asthma must receive a beta blocker, low doses of a selective drug should be used. Recent studies, however, have suggested that the use of a nonselective beta blocker may be desirable to antagonize some beta-2-mediated metabolic effects, such as hypokalemia, induced by epinephrine. Pindolol is the only beta-receptor antagonist available in the United States with intrinsic sympathomimetic, or partial agonist, activity. Such drugs, because of their partial agonist activity, cause some sympathetic stimulation under conditions of low endogenous sympathetic tone, such as while subjects are at rest in the supine position. Under conditions of higher sympathetic tone, pindolol blocks the effects of the endogenous agonists, producing the characteristic effects of a beta blocker. Membrane-stabilizing activity was first recognized with propranolol, and the value of this property has been a source of controversy ever since, but recent studies suggest that propranolol may induce electrophysiologic effects by mechanisms other than beta blockade. Pharmacokinetic differences between the drugs are also of importance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "60": "Because of the growing number of elderly in the population, hypertension in this age-group is becoming an increasingly important issue. Hypertension carries greater risk in the elderly, and the benefits of treatment of diastolic hypertension appear to be at least as great in this age-group as in younger populations. The benefits of treating systolic hypertension remain to be determined. On the basis of available information, hypertension in the elderly should be treated in a fashion similar in general to that used in younger patients. However, great care must be taken to minimize side effects, postural hypotension in particular. Special consideration of the physiologic, pharmacologic, behavioral, and socioeconomic factors in the elderly will help guide therapy design.", 
    "61": "We describe the synthesis and pharmacological properties of two new series of aliphatic and alicyclic beta-adrenergic blockers, most of them containing a cyclopropyl ring. They belong either to 2-hydroxy-3-(tert-butylamino)propyl ether A or 2-hydroxy-3-tert-(butylamino)propyl ketoxime ether B derivatives. The O-[2-hydroxy-3-(tert-butylamino)propyl] dicyclopropyl ketoxime 5 exhibited a beta-adrenergic antagonist activity comparable to that of propranolol. It was found that ketoxime ethers B generally showed higher potency than the corresponding ethers A. We confirm that the presence of an aromatic nucleus is not crucial for the beta-adrenergic activity. Structure-activity relationships among these series are discussed.", 
    "62": "The haemodynamic effects of extradural blockade were investigated in 25 hypertensive patients divided into three groups: 11 treated patients receiving lumbar extradural blockade (LT), nine treated hypertensive patients receiving thoracic extradural blockade (TT), and five untreated patients receiving lumbar extradural blockade (LU). Haemodynamic measurements were performed before and after the establishment of the extradural blockade, and repeated with the patients under light general anaesthesia. Mean upper level (T7) and range (T4-S1) of sensory blockade were similar in the two lumbar extradural groups, and mean segmental spread in the TT group was T4-L1. Changes from baseline to lowest arterial pressure showed a 22% (P less than 0.01) decrease in MAP in the LT group, 18% (P less than 0.05) in the TT group, and 42% (P less than 0.05) in the LU group. The decrease in arterial pressure was associated with a decrease in SVR in the LT group, and also with a decrease in cardiac output in the LU group. Three of the five untreated hypertensive patients demonstrated unacceptable decreases of arterial pressure, associated with abrupt and severe bradycardia, and required immediate treatment (head-down tilt, atropine and methoxamine). These complications were not observed in any of the treated hypertensive patients (P = 0.018).", 
    "63": "The displacement by some beta-adrenoceptor ligands of the specific (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol binding to membranes of the bovine musculus trapezius, a rich and homogeneous source of beta 2-adrenoceptors, appeared to be pH-dependent. This phenomenon was in contrast to the pH-dependency of the (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol receptor-binding and could be related to the ionization characteristics of the compounds. It was shown quantitatively that of the four ionic species of the ligands commonly present at physiological pH, the cation governs beta 2-adrenoceptor affinity.", 
    "64": "L6E9 myoblasts infected with Trypanosoma cruzi undergo desensitization to beta-adrenergic catecholamines in a manner distinct from uninfected control myoblasts. Following incubation of intact cells with isoproterenol for 2 h, homogenates prepared from differentiated, high density uninfected L6E9 cells retain isoproterenol-dependent adenylate cyclase activity. In addition, previous exposure to isoproterenol is accompanied by a decrease in the number of beta-adrenergic receptors. Homogenates of high density L6E9 cells infected with T. cruzi retain their adenylate cyclase responsivity to isoproterenol but demonstrate a marked decrease in beta-adrenergic receptors. Following desensitization infected cell homogenates lose their responsiveness to isoproterenol and demonstrate a more marked decrease in beta-receptors. There does not appear to be any effect of T. cruzi infection on affinity of beta-adrenergic agonists for the beta-receptor or on changes in agonist affinity associated with desensitization. Infection of low density undifferentiated cells results in no apparent change in adenylate cyclase activity or in beta-receptors. Their behavior in the setting of desensitization--decreased whole cell cyclic AMP, decreased adenylate cyclase, unchanged beta-receptors--is also not affected by infection. The pattern of desensitization to beta-adrenergic agonists in high density infected cells shares several properties with the pattern of desensitization in low density uninfected cells, suggesting that infection may be associated with part of the more primitive cellular response pattern.", 
    "65": "We have previously shown that gluconeogenesis, assessed by glycerol clearance, is increased in hyperthyroid man. The mechanism underlying this change is uncertain but many of the metabolic changes found in hyperthyroidism are thought to be due to increased catecholamine sensitivity of peripheral tissues. To test the hypothesis that enhanced gluconeogenic capacity from glycerol in hyperthyroidism might be mediated via a beta-adrenergic mechanism we have estimated glycerol clearance in thyrotoxic subjects before and during treatment with a non-selective beta-adrenergic blocking drug propranolol (Inderal LA). Control subjects of similar age and weight were also tested. In hyperthyroid subjects, blood glucose and blood glycerol concentrations were increased but blood lactate, pyruvate and alanine concentrations were normal. Glycerol clearance was increased and followed a double exponential decay with a shortened second component half-time. Endogenous glycerol production was increased three fold. Following beta-blockade blood glucose and blood glycerol concentrations fell although blood glucose concentrations remained above normal values. Glycerol clearance and endogenous glycerol production were also decreased but remained significantly higher than in control subjects. Serum thyroxine and serum triiodothyronine concentrations showed no significant change although mean values fell by 10% and 17% respectively. We conclude that the increase in gluconeogenic capacity from glycerol in hyperthyroid subjects is mediated in part by a beta-adrenergic mechanism.", 
    "66": "Opiate receptor blockade, or forced imbibition of 2% NaCl to deplete pituitary dynorphin decreases 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), but not insulin-induced hyperphagia, indicating a possible role for dynorphin in the eating associated with endogenous opiates. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade decreases vasopressin release induced by 2-DG but not by insulin. Because vasopressin and dynorphin are sometimes co-localized, it was hypothesized that naloxone-sensitive feeding might be selectively inhibited by beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol. Propranolol in doses as low as 2.5 mg/kg inhibited 4 hr feeding induced by 2-DG (400 mg/kg). Propranolol did not significantly affect feeding induced by ketocyclazocine administration (3.0 mg/kg) or by 24 hr food deprivation. Feeding stimulated by insulin (10 U/kg) was significantly inhibited by propranolol (2.5 mg/kg) only when the propranolol was reinjected during the period 2 hr after insulin injection, when the induced feeding was greatest. In summary, propranolol inhibited opiate-related (2-DG) as well as opiate-independent (insulin) hyperphagias. It also failed to inhibit food intake resulting from the opiate related stimulus of 24 hr food deprivation. Therefore, naloxone sensitive hyperphagias were not specifically inhibited by beta-adrenergic blockade, indicating that vasopressin-associated dynorphin is not involved in opiate related feeding.", 
    "67": "Bi-temporal injections of puromycin that primarily affect the hippocampal-entorhinal areas consistently induce amnesia of aversive maze-learning in mice for 3 days after training but are consistently ineffective if given 6 or more days after training. At these later times, additional puromycin sites covering widespread areas of the forebrain are necessary to induce amnesia. Consistent with other evidence, these observations are interpreted to indicate that the locus of the memory trace becomes more widespread during the 6-day period. A single subcutaneous injection of (-)-propranolol (50 micrograms/kg) given either before or 2 days after training suppressed engram spread for 60-90 days, at which time engram spread spontaneously occurred. This effect of propranolol was stereospecific. Suppression of engram spread persisted for a prolonged period in spite of the rapid recovery (about 4 hr), following treatment, of the normal level of specific binding of 3H-dihydroalprenolol in membrane preparations of the cerebral hemispheres and of 125I-pindolol in selected areas of the forebrain, diencephalon and brainstem.", 
    "68": "beta-Adrenergic receptor (beta AR)-specific, agonist-induced desensitization of adenylate cyclase can be shown in most mammalian cells examined to involve at least three reactions. An initial 'uncoupling' reaction leads to a 40-60% loss of catecholamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity at a time when no detectable loss of beta AR has occurred. This process precedes by 45-90 sec the appearance of beta AR in cytoplasmic vesicles. Such beta AR exhibit ligand binding properties consistent with their existence on the inside of membrane vesicles; thus, they appear to be formed by a process of agonist-induced beta AR internalization (endocytosis). A third process results in the loss of beta AR, at least in some cases due to receptor degradation. In general, agonist-induced desensitization or down-regulation reactions do not require protein synthesis. Recovery from the desensitized states does not require protein synthesis, whereas recovery from beta AR down-regulation (degraded receptors) requires new receptor synthesis. Agonist-induced beta AR desensitization and down-regulation reactions appear to have much in common with the process of polypeptide hormone-induced receptor down-regulation. The availability of a large number of ligands (agonists, partial agonists and antagonists) for the beta AR should allow the use of this receptor system to gain unique insights into the general processes of ligand-induced, cell surface receptor endocytosis.", 
    "69": "In anaesthetized rabbits, electrical stimulation of the hypothalamus in areas analogous to the defence area in cats produces the 'defence reaction.' This response includes signs of arousal and a large increase in blood flow to skeletal muscle in the hind limb caused by a vasodilatation in the skeletal muscle vasculature. The vasodilatation is a sympathetic response, and it is not dependent upon muscle activity in the hind limb. The muscle vasodilatation is insensitive to alpha-adrenoceptor, beta-adrenoceptor, cholinoceptor and histamine receptor antagonists. Intra-arterial injections of the purinoceptor agonists, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine, mimic the vasodilatation produced by electrical stimulation. The P1-purinoceptor blocker, aminophylline, attenuates adenosine-induced vasodilatation, but it does not affect the vasodilatation produced by ATP or hypothalamic stimulation. The P2-purinoceptor blocker, antazoline, attenuates the vasodilatation produced by both ATP and hypothalamic stimulation. Our results suggest that the muscle vasodilatation produced by hypothalamic stimulation is mediated by purinergic nerves which release ATP and act on P2-purinoceptors.", 
    "70": "Levels of cAMP were decreased and cGMP increased in progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS) fibroblasts compared with normal fibroblasts. PSS cells took up unusually large quantities of Ca++. The epinephrine-induced increases in cAMP were diminished sixfold and epinephrine-induced Ca++ uptake was abnormal in PSS cells. Considerable heterogeneity was observed in rheumatoid arthritis fibroblasts. Membrane-bound abnormalities in (PSS) cells may be of importance in the defective control of collagen production in progressive systemic sclerosis.", 
    "71": "There is some controversy regarding whether stimulation of renin release by the beta-adrenergic system is dependent on prostaglandin (PG) production. We have examined this problem in renal cortical slices of the dog and have obtained the following results: (1) Isoproterenol (4 X 10(-6) M) stimulated renin release, but had no effect on the formation of 6-keto PGF1 alpha, a stable metabolite of PGI2; (2) Indomethacin (2 X 10(-5) M) had no effect on isoproterenol stimulated renin release, but inhibited 6-keto PGF1 alpha formation; (3) Dibutyryl cyclic AMP (10(-3) M) stimulated both renin release, and 6-keto PGF1 alpha release. Indomethacin (2 X 10(-5) M) did not inhibit dibutyryl cyclic AMP-stimulated renin release, but did inhibit the production of 6 keto PGF1 alpha. These results indicate that the beta-adrenoceptor mediated renin release does not depend on the formation of PGI2, but renin release is dependent on cyclic AMP formation.", 
    "72": "Beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists are widely used in many clinical situations to regulate beta-adrenergic stimulation. However, responsiveness to beta-stimulation may be reduced by the process of desensitization. We have established an in vivo mammalian model system, the rat lung, to study the cellular and biochemical basis for beta-agonist induced desensitization. After in vivo administration of a beta-agonist [(-)isoproterenol] the adenylate cyclase becomes rapidly insensitive to further stimulation by beta-agonists with no change in basal or NaF-stimulated activity. The in vivo desensitization can be blocked by the simultaneous administration of a beta-antagonist [(+/-)propranolol] and the process displays the pharmacological characteristics typifying the beta 2 receptor of rat lung. This indicates that the in vivo desensitization is itself a receptor-mediated event. The processes of de- and resensitization are very rapid with onset within 5 min, maximal effect at 10 min, and complete reversal by 2-3 h. The change of adenylate cyclase sensitivity is paralleled by a translocation of approximately 40% of the beta-receptors from the plasma membrane fraction to a light membrane fraction, which has very low activities of plasma membrane marker enzymes. The receptors translocated to the light membrane fraction as well as those remaining in the plasma membranes are uncoupled with loss of their ability to form the high affinity, nucleotide sensitive, physiologically active state of the receptor. During resensitization the receptors in the plasma membrane fraction are recoupled before all the translocated receptors have returned. This suggests that translocation and uncoupling of the receptors are two distinct, probably independent processes. During the entire process of de- and resensitization no structural change of the receptor protein residing in the plasma membranes or light membrane fraction can be demonstrated as visualized by photoaffinity labeling.", 
    "73": "Desensitization of beta-receptor-linked adenylate cyclase occurs after prolonged occupancy of the beta-receptors by their agonists. We have followed the development and recovery from \"down\"-regulation of beta-receptors in enzymatically dissociated cardiac myocytes by using the hydrophilic antagonist [3H]-CGP-12177 to identify surface-bound beta-receptors. After in vitro incubation with (-)-isoproterenol, almost 50% of the beta-receptors are lost within 10 minutes. Isoproterenol-mediated cyclic adenosine monophosphate accumulation by isolated myocytes was also decreased after a 15-minute preincubation with isoproterenol. \"Lost\" beta-receptors can, however, be recovered when isoproterenol-pretreated, washed cardiac myocytes are incubated at 37 degrees C, 85 +/- 7% of the lost beta-receptors have returned to the cell surface after 20 minutes of incubation. The requirements for such recycling were investigated. Receptor recovery does not depend on de novo protein synthesis, since it is unaffected by prior exposure to cycloheximide. It is, however, dependent on cellular energy, because it is prevented by adenosine triphosphate depletion and involves a lysosomal step since it is inhibited by the lysomotropic agent, chloroquine. In addition, the Golgi apparatus and the microtubules are involved in the beta-receptor recycling to the cell surface, as evidenced by the inhibitory effects of monensin and colchicine, respectively. The mechanism of isoproterenol-induced down-regulation of cardiac beta-receptors involves a rapid, reversible cycling to and from the cytosol and the cell membrane. This intracellular receptor traffic is energy dependent, requires several structures, including lysosomes and microtubules, and may be modified by pathological processes involving the heart.", 
    "74": "To evaluate the degree of physical activity in hemodialysis patients, working capacity was assessed by bicycle ergometry in 16 hemodialysis patients (mean age 47 +/- 12 [SD] years). The mean length of dialysis treatment was 21 +/- 17 months. The laboratory and clinical findings were as follows (mean values +/- SD): urea 34 +/- 6 mmol/l; creatinine 1127 +/- 169 mumol/l; potassium 5.7 +/- 0.63 mmol/l; calcium 2.25 +/- 0.22 mmol/l; phosphate 1.76 +/- 0.54 mmol/l; hemoglobin 8.54 +/- 1.02 g/dl; hematocrit 26.1 +/- 2.9%; blood pressure 140 +/- 18/86 +/- 9 mm Hg; nerve conduction velocity 39.5 +/- 6.5 m/sec. Mean working capacity was 58 +/- 31 W (41 +/- 24% of normal values) and the specific working capacity (watts/kg body weight) was 0.79 +/- 0.54. The duration of exercise testing was 4.9 +/- 2 min. The ergometry had to be discontinued because of the following reasons: leg fatigue (10 patients); general fatigue (3); dyspnea (1); attainment of maximal heart rate (2). The maximal blood pressure during exercise testing was 149 +/- 21/86 +/- 14 mm Hg and the maximal increase in heart rate 117 +/- 34 beats/min. In patients treated with a beta-blocker agent for hypertension, maximal increase in blood pressure was comparable to normotensive patients. There was a negative correlation between working capacity and the age of the patients (r = 0.77; p less than 0.01). A positive correlation was found between working capacity and the serum creatinine level (r = 0.52; p less than 0.05).", 
    "75": "The antihypertensive activity of two fixed beta-blocker combinations was compared in a randomized double-blind study. 18 patients with degree I or II hypertension and hyperuricaemia were treated with a once daily dose for 4 weeks. 9 patients received 200 mg celiprolol. HCl +25 mg chlorthalidone, and 9 patients were treated with 100 mg atenolol + 25 mg chlorthalidone. Both substances produced a similar reduction in blood pressure and heart rate. There was a significant rise in the serum uric acid level in both treatment groups.", 
    "76": "Calmidazolium, a lipophilic cation and putative calmodulin-specific antagonist, inhibited potently the calcium ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) vesicles isolated from skeletal muscle. Based on steady-state measurements of catalytic activity over a range of MgATP, calmidazolium, and SR protein concentrations, the calculated values of the inhibition constant (KI) and binding stoichiometry were 0.06 microM and 770 nmol/mg protein, respectively. SR CaATPase inhibition apparently is not a general property of lipophilic cations since the hydrophobic anion tetraphenylboron inhibited catalysis, whereas its cationic analog, tetraphenylarsonium, did not. Enzyme inhibition by calmidazolium was noncompetitive with respect to the substrates Ca2+ and MgATP. In the presence of other SR CaATPase inhibitors, calmidazolium was competitive with respect to quercetin and noncompetitive with respect to trifluoperazine and propranolol. While calmidazolium inhibited enzyme phosphorylation by MgATP, catalysis was more sensitive to the inhibitor. Binding of calmidazolium to SR membranes produced morphological changes seen by electron microscopy as membrane thickening and loss of resolution of surface detail. Our results show that calmidazolium is a high-affinity, noncompetitive inhibitor of skeletal SR CaATPase activity, and they suggest that this inhibition is based on binding to the membrane phospholipids rather than specific antagonism of enzyme activation by calmodulin.", 
    "77": "Pure beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-AR) isolated from guinea pig lung and pure guanine nucleotide binding regulatory protein (NS) of adenylate cyclase isolated from human erythrocytes have been inserted into phospholipid vesicles, resulting in the functional coupling of these two components. The reconstitution of receptor and NS interactions results in the establishment of a guanine nucleotide sensitive state of the receptor that binds agonists with high affinity. Competition curves of isoproterenol for labeled antagonist binding to vesicles containing both beta-AR and NS are biphasic and reveal two affinity states, one of high (approximately 2 nM) and the other of low affinity (approximately 300 nM). In the presence of guanine nucleotides, the competition curves become monophasic and are shifted to a single low-affinity state for the agonist similar to the situation observed in membrane preparations. In addition, the interactions of the receptor and NS lead to the induction of a GTPase activity in NS. The GTPase activity can be stimulated by beta-adrenergic agonists such as isoproterenol (2-5-fold) and is completely blocked by antagonists such as alprenolol in a stereoselective manner. The established hormone responsive activity retains the beta 2-adrenergic specificity conferred by the pure receptor, and similar extents of stimulation (up to 4-fold) are observed with pure receptor from frog erythrocytes, indicating a similar efficiency of coupling between receptors from different species and NS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "78": "The beta 2-adrenergic receptors from hamster, guinea pig, and rat lungs have been solubilized with digitonin and purified by sequential Sepharose-alprenolol affinity and high-performance steric-exclusion liquid chromatography. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography of iodinated purified receptor preparations reveal a peptide with an apparent Mr of 64 000 in all three systems that coincides with the peptide labeled by the specific beta-adrenergic photoaffinity probe (p-azido-m-[125I]iodobenzyl)carazolol. A single polypeptide was observed in all three systems, suggesting that lower molecular weight peptides identified previously by affinity labeling or purification in mammalian systems may represent proteolyzed forms of the receptor. Purification of the beta-adrenergic receptor has also been assessed by silver staining, iodinated lectin binding, and measurement of the specific activity (approximately 15 000 pmol of [3H]dihydroalprenolol bound/mg of protein). Overall yields approximate 10% of the initial crude particulate binding, with 1-3 pmol of purified receptor obtained/g of tissue. The purified receptor preparations bind agonist and antagonist ligands with the expected beta 2-adrenergic specificity and stereoselectivity. Peptide mapping and lectin binding studies of the hamster, guinea pig, and rat lung beta 2-adrenergic receptors reveal significant similarities suggestive of evolutionary homology.", 
    "79": "The effect of norepinephrine on phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine formation was investigated in short-term incubations with freshly isolated rat hepatocytes. In the presence of dl-propranolol, norepinephrine decreases the incorporation of [methyl-14C]choline into phosphatidylcholines in a dose-dependent manner. At a concentration of 50 microM, norepinephrine (plus 20 microM propranolol) inhibits the incorporation of [methyl-14C]choline over a wide range of choline concentrations (59% inhibition at 5 microM choline; 34% inhibition at 1 mM choline). Norepinephrine also decreases the incorporation rates of [1-14C]palmitic acid and [1-14C]oleic acid into phosphatidylcholines. The effect of norepinephrine is mediated through an alpha-adrenergic receptor. Norepinephrine (plus propranolol) does not decrease the uptake or phosphorylation rate of [methyl-14C]choline. Pulse-label and pulse-chase studies indicate that the conversion rate of phosphocholine to CDP-choline, catalyzed by CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase, is diminished by norepinephrine. In contrast with the inhibitory effect of norepinephrine on phosphatidylcholine synthesis, this hormone stimulates the formation of phosphatidylethanolamines from [1,2-14C]ethanolamine. This increased incorporation rate is apparent at ethanolamine concentrations above 25 microM. A combination of norepinephrine and propranolol decreases, however, the synthesis of phosphatidylcholines from [1,2-14C]ethanolamine. The results indicate that alpha-adrenergic regulation dissociates the synthesis of phosphatidylcholines from that of phosphatidylethanolamines.", 
    "80": "Oxprenolol, a fat-soluble beta-adrenergic blocker, promoted as an anxiolytic agent to alleviate peripheral symptoms associated with anxiety, and lorazepam, a 1,4-benzodiazepine anxiolytic drug, may both depress central nervous system (CNS) function. It is generally accepted that ethanol, when concurrently ingested, potentiates the CNS-depressant effects of drugs. The effects on CNS function of oxprenolol, lorazepam and placebo alone and in combination with ethanol were determined by a Leeds Psychomotor Tester and we concluded that oxprenolol in combination with ethanol is less hazardous to people operating power tools/machines or driving motor vehicles than the combination of lorazepam with ethanol."
