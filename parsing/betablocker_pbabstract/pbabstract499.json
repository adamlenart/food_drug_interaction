The effect of beta-adrenoceptor blockade on the hepatic arterial response to portal vein occlusion was investigated in 6 anaesthetized dogs. A side-to-side portacaval shunt was established to prevent loss of venous return and arterial blood pressure during periods of portal occlusion. Measurements of hepatic arterial and portal venous blood flows were made by use of electromagnetic flow probes. 3. Intravenous propranolol injection, at a dose sufficient to block the vasodilator effect of low doses of exogenous adrenaline, did not alter the magnitude of the hyperaemic response of the hepatic artery. Propranolol also produced no change in baseline portal venous pressure. 4. It is concluded that hepatic beta-adrenoceptors are unlikely to be involved in the arterial response to portal occlusion. The absence of any reduction in basal portal venous pressure by propranolol is of interest in view of the current application of the drug in the treatment of patients with portal hypertension.", 
    "1": "This study was designed to determine whether thyroid hormone (T4) produces cardiac hypertrophy and alters ventricular function by direct effects on the heart or by alterations in adrenergic stimulation or changes in the peripheral circulation. Rats were treated with captopril (4 mg/ml of drinking water), propranolol (0.5 mg/ml of drinking water), hydralazine (80 mg/l of drinking water) or the combination of captopril and propranolol with and without T4 (15 micrograms/100 g b.w. i.p.). After 10 days, T4 increased (P less than .01) heart rate, left ventricular (LV) dP/dt and LV weight/body weight, but did not alter LV systolic pressure (SP) or enddiastolic pressure (EDP). Compared to treatment with T4 alone, captopril plus T4 decreased LV SP (P less than .05) and LV EDP (P less than .01); however, heart rate, LV dP/dt and LV weight/body weight were unchanged. Treatment with T4 plus propranolol decreased heart rate and LV EDP (P less than .05) compared to T4 alone; however, LV SP, LV dP/dt and LV weight/body weight were unchanged (P greater than .05). Hydralazine did not alter (P greater than .05) heart rate, LV SP, LV EDP or prevent the development of increased LV weight/body weight when given with T4; however, LV dP/dt was slightly decreased (P less than .05). Treatment with the combination of captopril and propranolol did not alter (P greater than .05) heart rate, LV SP, LV EDP or LV dP/dt and also failed to prevent the development of increased LV weight/body weight and LV dP/dt when given with T4.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "2": "We have studied the mechanism of release of plasminogen activator (PA) activity induced by epinephrine in the perfused rat hindleg model. Epinephrine perfusion at the dose of 12.5 microM caused a slighter effect on PA activity but an immediate increase in the perfusion pressure. At 25 microM, epinephrine induced a marked increase in PA activity that reached the maximum level at the end of the drug perfusion. The same response was induced by repeated stimulations with epinephrine (25 microM) only if the second stimulus was given 20-25 min apart from the first one. PA release could be blocked by propranolol (300 microM), a nonspecific beta-blocker, and not by phentolamine, a nonspecific alpha-blocker, unless used at very high concentrations (1,250 microM). Perfusion with dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (DbcAMP) alone induces an immediate and transient increase in PA activity, but no potentiation could be demonstrated if theophylline was perfused together with epinephrine. The released PA has been characterized on the basis of molecular weight and immunological criteria as t-PA- and u-PA-like molecules in basal conditions. Epinephrine perfusion induced an increase only in the t-PA-like protein. These data indicate that the release of t-PA-like activity observed after epinephrine perfusion is mainly mediated by beta-receptors and is independent from its vasoactive action.", 
    "3": "The function of beta-adrenoceptors in the human internal mammary artery was studied in vitro to predict the way in which the internal mammary artery graft would respond to beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists given in the perioperative period. Ring segments of the distal internal mammary artery obtained from patients not receiving beta-blocker therapy were mounted in organ baths and isometric wall force was measured. For comparison, similar experiments were conducted on segments of canine coronary artery, a vessel known to have powerful beta-adrenoceptor function. All arteries were precontracted with potassium or the thromboxane mimetic agent, U46619, before isoproterenol cumulative concentration-relaxation curves were constructed. In the human internal mammary artery, the maximum relaxation induced by isoproterenol was only 14% of the potassium-induced contraction and 24% of the U46619-induced contraction. These responses were weak compared with 54% and 86% for beta-adrenoceptor relaxation measured in corresponding experiments in the canine coronary artery. In all experiments, propranolol antagonized the relaxation induced by isoproterenol. These studies suggested that the human internal mammary artery has only a small number of beta-adrenoceptors. We conclude that beta-adrenoceptors would contribute little to the reactivity of the human internal mammary artery graft to sympathomimetic drugs.", 
    "4": "The rate of DNA synthesis in mouse brown adipose tissue was followed with injections of [3H]thymidine. Cold exposure led to a large increase in the rate of [3H]thymidine incorporation, reaching a maximum after 8 days, whereafter the activity abruptly ceased. A series of norepinephrine injections was in itself able to increase [3H]thymidine incorporation. When norepinephrine was injected in combination with the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine or with the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, the stimulation was fully blocked by propranolol. It is suggested that stimulation of DNA synthesis in brown adipose tissue is a beta-adrenergically mediated process and that the tissue is an interesting model for studies of physiological control of DNA synthesis.", 
    "5": "Chronic ethanol ingestion by mice resulted in the loss of high-affinity beta-adrenergic agonist binding sites and a significant decrease in activation of adenylate cyclase by guanine nucleotides and beta-adrenergic agonists in the hippocampus, although no significant change was noted in the total number of beta-adrenergic receptors, as defined by the binding of the antagonist [125]iodocyanopindolol. In cerebellum, chronic ethanol ingestion resulted in a 16% decrease in the total concentration of beta-adrenergic receptors and in a decrease in the affinity for agonist of the high-affinity beta-adrenergic agonist binding sites. However, neither the amount of the high-affinity agonist binding sites nor the activation of adenylate cyclase by agonist was affected. The different responses to ethanol in hippocampus and cerebellum may result from quantitative differences in distribution of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors in the tested brain areas and/or differential effects of ethanol on stimulatory guanine nucleotide binding protein in these brain areas.", 
    "6": "The fat and protein composition of human milk changes dramatically in the first several weeks postpartum. In order to investigate the possible effect of this compositional change on the milk-to-plasma drug concentration ratio (M/P), the following experiment was performed. Milk samples were collected from five healthy lactating women on days 3, 5, 7, and 14 postpartum; blood samples were obtained on these days, as well as on day 1. Serum and skim milk unbound fractions (fp and fm, respectively) and the skim milk-to-whole milk drug concentration ratio (S/M) were determined in vitro in the above samples for diazepam, propranolol, and etretin, an aromatic retinoid. In addition, the composition of these milk and serum samples was also assessed. Using a previously proposed mathematical model for the distribution of drugs between milk and plasma, M/P was calculated from values for fm, fp, S/M, milk pH, and literature values for the pKa values of the compounds. The M/P was calculated for each subject on each day of sample collection. Total serum protein and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) levels increased in the first two weeks postpartum. Mean diazepam fp values fell from 0.020 to 0.014 during this period, while propranolol fp values changed inversely with serum AAG levels. Milk whey and total proteins decreased as lactation progressed, but changes in fat levels were not statistically significant. Calculated propranolol M/P increased during the study period, predominately due to changes in milk pH and propranolol S/M.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "7": "The intravenous administration of low doses of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) or of the selective 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A) receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) depresses the firing activity of dorsal raphe 5-HT-containing neurons, presumably via the activation of 5-HT1A receptors. The present studies were undertaken to determine the effect of different types of 5-HT receptor antagonists on this effect of LSD and 8-OH-DPAT. (-)-Propranolol (2 mg/kg i.v.), methiothepin (2 mg/kg i.p., twice daily for 4 days followed by an additional dose of 2 mg/kg i.p., prior to the experiment), pelanserine (0.5 mg/kg i.v.), and indorenate (125 micrograms/kg i.v.) failed to block the effects of either LSD or 8-OH-DPAT on the firing activity of 5-HT neurons of the dorsal raphe nucleus. However, spiperone (1 mg/kg i.v.) significantly reduced the effect of both LSD and 8-OH-DPAT. These results indicate that, among the five putative 5-HT receptor antagonists tested, only spiperone can antagonize the suppressant effect of 5-HT receptor agonists on the firing of dorsal raphe 5-HT neurons.", 
    "8": "We have studied the effects of long-term treatment with different antihypertensive drugs on blood pressure and mesenteric resistance vessel structure of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), both during treatment and after withdrawal of treatment. Young SHR were treated from 4 to 24 weeks with five different drugs: perindopril (1.5 mg/kg per day), captopril (60 mg/kg per day), hydralazine (25 mg/kg per day), isradipine (42 mg/kg per day) and metoprolol (130 mg/kg per day). At 24 weeks, 24-h mean blood pressures (MBP), measured invasively, were 121 mmHg (perindopril), 137 mmHg (captopril), 140 mmHg (hydralazine), 149 mmHg (isradipine) and 146 mmHg (metoprolol), compared to control values of 177 mmHg (SHR) and 132 mmHg (Wistar-Kyoto rats, WKY). Mesenteric resistance vessel structure, measured as media:lumen ratio (m:l), was also reduced to different extents: to WKY-level by perindopril (m:l = 4.4%), to midway between SHR- and WKY-levels by captopril, hydralazine and isradipine (m:l = 5.9%), and not at all by metoprolol (m:l = 6.8%). When treatment was discontinued, low MBP (ca 151 mmHg) persisted for 12 weeks in rats treated with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (perindopril and captopril), but rose rapidly in rats which had received the other treatments. At 3-12 weeks after withdrawal of treatment vascular structure was closely correlated with the blood pressure expected from the SHR- and WKY-control values, as were the left ventricle: body weight ratios. The results suggest that the ability of a drug to control vascular structure during treatment is not in itself a predictor of a persistent effect on blood pressure after withdrawal of treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "9": "The effect of nadolol versus placebo on both flushing provoked in a laboratory setting and spontaneous flushing was studied in 15 patients with erythematous telangiectatic rosacea. The intensity of the flushing reactions was assessed in the laboratory by the cutaneous perfusion index method with laser-Doppler velocimetry. No effect of nadolol on the flushing reactions provoked in the laboratory was detected.", 
    "10": "The correlation between the alterations of free intracellular calcium concentrations and the essential arterial hypertension has been largely investigated. Calmodulin, a cytoplasmic protein with low molecular weight, is one of the factors known to be able to affect the activity of calcium-dependent enzymes. The authors have investigated the effect of calcium and calmodulin on the plasmatic membrane of intact erythrocytes in a group of patients with essential arterial hypertension. To this purpose, the ionophor A23187, propranolol at low concentrations and a few calcium channel blocking drugs, alone or associated with calmodulin have been used. The results demonstrate that calmodulin, capable of blocking calcium outside the cell, can exert its effect only when propranolol is also present in the erythrocytes of normotensive but not in the hypertensive patients. The authors discuss some pathogenetic hypotheses.", 
    "11": "The \"dynamic\" left ventricular outflow obstruction syndrome, which is found in 4.5 to 11 p. 100 of patients who underwent mitral valve repair by Carpentier's technique, seems to be due to the association of two different sets of circumstances. The first set is anatomical; the syndrome is thought to result from the implantation of a semi-rigid valve ring, from the excessive length of the mitral valve system in relation to the size of the ventricular cavity, and from excessive correction of mitral regurgitation with subsequent excessive reduction in caliber of the left ventricular outflow tract, change in the interrelation between outflow tract and ventricular filling and strongly anterior position of the mitral valve. The second set is functional; it is due to a more than 20 p. 100 reduction in caliber of the left ventricular outflow tract on the one hand, and to a more than 2.5 m/s increase in blood flow velocity on the other hand. These two phenomena may be produced by a decrease in left ventricular volume as a result of hypovolaemia, tachycardia or more rapid circulation. Treatment of the syndrome consists of correcting the associated abnormalities by prescribing a diet with a normal sodium content, together with an appropriate anti-arrhythmic agent and a beta-blocker.", 
    "12": "We wanted to examine how adenosine stimulates ventilation in man. Bolus doses of adenosine were given i.v. in an antebrachial vein in multiples of 2.65 mg. The minute ventilation was increased by adenosine 5.3 to 15.9 mg (median values) from control 12.6 +/- 1.9 l min-1 to 42.5 +/- 4.7 l min-1 in a dose-dependent manner. The adenosine receptor antagonist theophylline, 58.3 +/- 3.3 (mean +/- SEM) mumol l-1 plasma, inhibited the response by approximately 25%. Dipyridamole 10 mg, an adenosine uptake blocker, enhanced the effect of adenosine by approximately 60%. The ventilation was not affected by metoprolol, atropine, naloxone or cromolyn sodium but was attenuated by hyperventilation. The respiratory stimulation started before chest pain and cardiovascular effects such as AV-block were encountered. It is concluded that this respiratory stimulation shows characteristics of adenosine receptor mediated responses but the location of such adenosine receptors is uncertain. The findings are compatible with a stimulatory or facilitating effect of adenosine on afferent pathways.", 
    "13": "Forty-eight anginal patients (mean age: 50.3 +/- 1.6 years) were included in the study, carried out in 6 centres. Both the continuous regimen of propranolol (PR) administration (4 or 3 times daily) and the intermittent regimen (twice daily) were associated with a significant drop in the frequency of anginal attacks and the quantity of nitroglycerine pills consumed (p less than 0.05). PR, used for 12 weeks in a regimen, determined by means of paired bicycle ergometric tests, produced an antianginal effect in 85% of anginal patients, the effect being absolute in 35% of those. However, in the \"twice-daily\" regimen of PR administration, paired bicycle ergometry, conducted in the course of treatment, revealed that antianginal effect was not stable within 12 hours. Treatment courses with higher daily PR doses failed to produce any significant drop in the frequency of anginal attacks as compared to the effect, already achieved with an earlier dose.", 
    "14": "1. The effects of the sulphonylureas glibenclamide, glipizide and tolbutamide on relaxant responses to the K+ channel activator, cromakalim (BRL 34915), were investigated in rabbit isolated mesenteric artery. The interaction between glibenclamide and pinacidil, another K+ channel activator, was also studied. 2. Glibenclamide produced progressive parallel shifts to the right of the cromakalim and pinacidil concentration-response curves. The calculated pA2 values were 7.16 +/- 0.03 against cromakalim and 6.66 +/- 0.05 against pinacidil. 3. Glipizide and tolbutamide also produced parallel shifts to the right of the cromakalim concentration-response curve to yield pA2 values of 5.59 and 3.98 respectively. 4. Glibenclamide had little inhibitory effect upon vasorelaxant responses to the Ca2+ channel blocker, nifedipine. 5. The results suggest that cromakalim and pinacidil activate an ATP-sensitive K+ channel in vascular smooth muscle which may differ from that of the pancreatic beta-cells.", 
    "15": "In order to study the involvement of the adrenal medulla in stress-induced inhibition of gonadotrophin secretion, we measured plasma concentrations of LH, FSH and corticosterone in adult male rats subjected to chronic restraint after surgical ablation of the adrenal medulla. In intact animals, chronic restraint (6 h daily over 4 days) induced a significant (P less than 0.05) decrease in plasma concentrations of LH, whereas plasma concentrations of corticosterone showed the expected significant (P less than 0.01) increase. Adrenomedullectomy did not significantly modify basal plasma concentrations of LH or corticosterone. In these rats, there was no significant decrease of LH after stress, while the increase in corticosterone was as significant as in sham-operated animals (P less than 0.01). In order to confirm the role of adrenomedullary catecholamines in stress-induced gonadotrophin inhibition another group of rats was treated s.c. with the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol (2 mg/kg twice daily). These rats showed an attenuated inhibition of LH during stress similar to that observed in adrenomedullectomized rats. Levels of FSH were significantly reduced after stress in the saline-treated group, while there were no differences between stressed or unstressed rats in the propranolol-treated group. These results may be considered as evidence that medullary catecholamines, acting through beta-receptors, are factors involved in gonadotrophin inhibition during chronic stress.", 
    "16": "Angiographic, angioscopic and pathologic reports have recently demonstrated a high incidence of intracoronary thrombus in patients with unstable angina. To determine if thrombolysis could be beneficial when combined with maximal medical therapy, 40 patients with rest angina, angiographically documented coronary artery disease and pacing-induced ischemia were randomly assigned to intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA, 150 mg/8 h) or placebo in a prospective double-blind trial. All patients received nitrates, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent, a calcium channel blocker, aspirin and heparin. Pacing thresholds for ischemia and quantitative coronary stenosis were measured before and after infusion of the study medication. Intracoronary thrombus was identified angiographically before infusion of the study medication in 16 patients; 7 received rt-PA and 9 received placebo. The ischemic pacing threshold in patients treated with rt-PA increased from 112 +/- 4 beats/min at baseline to 127 +/- 5 beats/min (p = 0.007) by the end of the infusion versus an insignificant change in patients who received placebo (from 116 +/- 4 to 119 +/- 4 beats/min, p = NS). In patients with intracoronary thrombus, the ischemic pacing threshold increased 26 +/- 7 beats/min with rt-PA treatment versus 0 +/- 3 beats/min with placebo (p = 0.004). In contrast, in patients without thrombus, there was no difference in ischemic pacing threshold increments between treatment groups (7 +/- 11 beats/min for rt-PA versus 6 +/- 5 beats/min for placebo, p = NS).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "17": "Whether C cells cosecrete calcitonin (CT) and CGRP was examined by exposing cultured rat medullary thyroid carcinoma 6-23 cells for 2 h to high medium Ca and to agents with a potential for affecting Ca-dependent secretion. In every experiment exposure of cells to high medium Ca (2.0-2.5 mM) provoked an increased release of both peptides that was highly correlated (r = 0.73). With other test substances, also, changes in both hormones occurred in parallel. The Ca-channel activator, BAY-K-8644 (10 microM) increased secretion, and this was inhibited by the Ca channel blocker, nitrendipine (10 microM). The Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin (5 microM), increased release, and the calmodulin-Ca channel inhibitor, phenytoin (100 microM), inhibited Ca-induced release. The active 4 beta isomer of phorbol-12,13-didecanoate (0.1 microM), but not the inactive 4 alpha isomer, increased secretion. The findings suggest that pathways mediating C cell secretion include plasma membrane Ca channels, intracellular [Ca2+], calmodulin, and protein kinase C. The results show that the secretory process in rat C cells involves the release of CGRP as well as CT.", 
    "18": "In human-isolated ventricular myocardium the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine has a positive inotropic effect but its mechanism is largely unknown. We studied the effects of phenylephrine in trabeculae isolated from three nonfailing human hearts. We found that the force of contraction rose concentration-dependently (1-300 mumol/L), maximally, to about 235% of control (at 100 mumol/L). The inositol phosphates were increased to 195-262%, whereas the phosphatidylinositol phosphate and phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate decreased to 69-73% of control. The present results suggest that the alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated increase in inositol trisphosphate and the positive inotropic effect may be causally related in the normal human heart.", 
    "19": "The aim of this study was to examine the electrophysiological effects of isoprenaline, phenylephrine, and noradrenaline on sheep Purkinje fibers in vitro, superfused either with a normal or with a modified physiological salt solution (PSS) designed to mimic some of the conditions occurring during mild myocardial ischemia (hyperkalemia, hypoxia, and acidosis). Intracellular microelectrode recording techniques were used to record resting and action potentials. Noradrenaline (10(-7) to 10(-5) M) and phenylephrine (10(-7) to 10(-5) M) prolonged the action potential of normal fibers in a concentration-dependent manner, the effect of phenylephrine being greater than that of noradrenaline. The only effect of isoprenaline (10(-7) to 10(-5) M) was a slight hyperpolarization. The modified PSS caused marked reductions in resting membrane potential, upstroke, and duration of the action potential. On these depressed fibers isoprenaline, noradrenaline, and phenylephrine all prolonged the action potential, and in the case of noradrenaline the duration of the abbreviated action potential was restored beyond control. This effect of noradrenaline and isoprenaline was more marked under ischemic than normal conditions, whereas the opposite was true of phenylephrine. In the presence of effective alpha- or beta-adrenoceptor blockade, the noradrenaline-induced prolongation of the \"ischemia\"-abbreviated action potential was attenuated. In some of the preparations exposed to simulated ischemia, noradrenaline caused inexcitability. In conclusion, isoprenaline, phenylephrine, and noradrenaline exhibited different electrophysiological effects on mildly \"ischemic\" sheep Purkinje fibers compared to their effects on normal fibers.", 
    "20": "Platelet aggregability is known to be enhanced and platelet-survival time shortened in smokers when compared with nonsmokers. Up to now it is unknown which of the substances in tobacco smoke are responsible for these effects. To evaluate a possible role of nicotine, rats were chronically treated with the alkaloid (10 mg/kg/day), continuously released from subcutaneously implanted osmotic minipumps. Surprisingly, after 8 weeks, platelet sensitivity toward the aggregating stimulus adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP) was markedly reduced. The mean ADP concentration required to induce half the maximum rate of aggregation (EC50) was 0.88 mumol/L in nicotine-treated animals, as compared with 0.67 mumol/L in controls (p less than 0.002). Platelet aggregability remained normal when the rats were treated simultaneously with nicotine and the beta blocker propranolol (3.5 mg/kg/day); for these animals, the mean EC50 for ADP was 0.73 mumol/L. These results are suggestive of a catecholamine-mediated action of nicotine. However, neither the basal levels of cAMP in platelet-rich plasma, nor the cAMP levels attained after stimulation of platelet adenylate cyclase with prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), were affected by 8 weeks of treatment with nicotine or nicotine plus propranolol. No effect on platelet aggregation was observed when the rats were treated with nicotine for only 2 weeks, or when nicotine or nicotine plus cotinine were added to platelet-rich plasma in vitro in concentrations equal to those attained in vivo after 8 weeks. Thus, prolonged application of nicotine in vivo caused an inhibition of ADP-induced rat platelet aggregation presumably mediated by beta-catecholaminergic stimulation of platelets.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "21": "(-)Isoprenaline was continuously administered to rats at a rate of 0.4 mg/kg/h for 7 days via subcutaneously (s.c.) implanted osmotic minipumps. This treatment induced cardiac hypertrophy and a marked decrease in basal as well as catecholamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in a ventricular plasma membrane fraction. The total number of beta-adrenoceptors was downregulated by one-half the amount of the receptor sites obtained in a control group. However, in the isoprenaline-treated group, the beta 2-adrenoceptors constituted a significantly smaller proportion of the total beta-adrenoceptor population (28%) than in the control group (50%). Transformation of these relative into absolute values indicates that prolonged isoprenaline treatment induced a significantly higher downregulation of beta 2- than of beta 1-adrenoceptors. The fact of a different beta-adrenoceptor desensitization pattern in response to in vivo administration of nonselective beta-adrenergic agonists therefore must be taken into consideration when desensitization is used as a method for determination of subtype selectivity of an agonist per se. However, we were unable to detect the \"lost\" beta-adrenoceptors in a light vesicular fraction. In our study, this fraction was not separable from plasma membranes, as substantiated by levels of plasma membrane markers as high as in the plasma membrane fraction and by a guanine nucleotide-dependent adenylate cyclase activity.", 
    "22": "We hypothesized that the antiarrhythmic efficacy of propranolol during acute myocardial ischemia could be dose related. Propranolol was administered in two equally divided doses 30 min before and 10 min after ligation of the anterior descending coronary artery (CAL) in anesthetized open-chest pigs. Only the lowest dose of propranolol, i.e., 0.1 mg/kg intravenously (i.v.) (plasma level 22 +/- 2 ng/ml) decreased the incidence of ventricular fibrillation (VF), i.e. 3 of 12 versus 16 of 20 in control group (p less than 0.01). VF incidence with propranolol 0.5 or 3 mg/kg was 4 of 6 and 8 of 9, respectively (both NS vs. control group). Propranolol 0.1 mg/kg did not change left ventricular (LV) blood flow. Propranolol 3 mg/kg reduced blood flow in the peripheral ischemic myocardium to 13.2 +/- 1.2 versus 19.2 +/- 1.4 ml/100 g/min in control group (p less than 0.01), and in the midischemic zone to 4.4 +/- 0.5 versus 7.0 +/- 0.9 ml/100 g/min in control group (p less than 0.001). Propranolol 0.1 mg/kg prevented a disparity of levels of cyclic AMP from arising between ischemic and non-ischemic myocardium, whereas propranolol 3.0 mg/kg did not. Furthermore, LV mechanical function was suppressed by propranolol 3 mg/kg. Only the lowest dose of propranolol (i.e., 0.1 mg/kg) decreased the incidence of VF in this model.", 
    "23": "The purpose of this study was to find out whether transesophageal pacing could be utilized for assessment of sinus node function in patients with sick sinus syndrome (SSS). In 17 patients with SSS (study group) we compared the results of sinus node tests obtained both in the basal state and after pharmacological autonomic blockade by endocavitary stimulation and, 24 hours later, by transesophageal pacing. In another group of 17 patients with SSS (control group), we compared the results obtained by two endocavitary studies. In \"study group\", sinus cycle length (SCL) and corrected sinus node recovery time (CSRT) did not show significant differences between the two studies both in the basal state and after autonomic blockade, whereas sinoatrial conduction time (SACT) was more prolonged during esophageal pacing (P less than 0.01). In \"control group\", sinus node measures did not show significant differences between the two studies. In the \"study group,\" the following coefficients of correlation were obtained in the basal state; SCL, r = 0.65, CSRT, r = 0.57, SACT, r = 0.52 and after autonomic blockade: SCL, r = 0.95, CSRT, r = 0.62 and SACT, r = 0.53. In the basal state, the correlation for SCL and CSRT between the two studies was lower in the \"study group\" than in the \"control group\" (P less than 0.05), whereas after autonomic blockade the correlation for sinus node measures did not show significant differences between the two groups of patients. These data suggest that transesophageal study influences the autonomic tone regulating the sinus node; however, it is not responsible for important variations in sinus node measures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "24": "A rabbit antiserum raised against anti-alprenolol mAb 14C3 detects common antigenic determinants (ADC3) in 10 out of 14 anti-alprenolol mAb that use different germ-line VH and/or Vk genes. The anti-14C3 antiserum binds only to H chains in immunoblots, therefore suggesting that at least part of the ADC3 determinants may be encoded by H chain V region genes. Analysis of VH gene family usage among the anti-alprenolol mAb reveals that the expression of ADC3 correlates with utilization of VH genes that belong to the J558 gene family, regardless of the JH, Vk, and Jk genes. To determine whether the ADC3 determinants are general V region markers or whether they are unique to anti-alprenolol antibodies, we have extended our analysis to a random panel of antibodies that also use VH genes of the J558 family. Among 23 mAb of various specificities, 14 react with the anti-14C3 antiserum in immunoblot and in ELISA, irrespective of antibody specificity. Adsorption of the antiserum on one of these positive antibodies results in a loss of reactivity toward both anti-alprenolol and unrelated antibodies. Therefore, several but not all antibodies that use a J558 VH gene also express the complete set of epitopes defining ADC3. These results strongly suggest that ADC3 are markers of a subset of J558 VH gene products. The anti-14C3 antiserum may thus constitute a \"serologic probe\" for identification of a VH gene subgroup from the J558 gene family.",

In contrast, similar studies performed on rabbit cardiac sarcolemma favored a one site model consistent with the presence of beta 1-adrenoceptors. Consequently, rabbit mononuclear leukocytes may provide a useful model for studying selective modulatory mechanisms of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "26": "This study involved 113 patients (mean age 50 +/- 14 years) with diastolic blood pressure above 95 mmHg. The patients abstained from taking any antihypertensive drug and received a placebo for one week before entering felodipine, a new calcium antagonist (5 mg x2/day for 2 weeks, then 10 mg x2/day) or atenolol (100 mg/day). There was no significant difference between the two treatment groups. Atenolol tended to be more effective in young subjects and felodipine in subjects aged 60 years or more. Heart rate was more reduced by atenolol than by felodipine (P less than 0.01). Undesirable side-effects were recorded by means of an open questionnaire. Their incidence was 23 per cent during the week under placebo and 84 per cent and 80 per cent respectively during treatment with felodipine or atenolol. The most frequent side-effects were oedema of the ankles and headache under felodipine, fatigue and headache under atenolol. Alkaline phosphatase levels were higher in the felodipine group (P less than 0.05), and a slight rise in blood potassium level (0.2 mmol/l) was noted in the atenolol group (P = 0.001), but these values remained within normal limits.", 
    "27": "Depleting the mitochondrial matrix of divalent cations with the ionophore A23187 activates a pH-sensitive, anion uniport pathway which can transport many anions normally regarded as impermeant (Beavis, A. D., and Garlid, K. D. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 15085-15093). Addition of valinomycin to respiring mitochondria can also induce the uptake of a wide variety of anions; however, the mechanism of anion transport during this \"respiration-induced\" swelling is less certain. In this paper, I demonstrate that both of these processes are inhibited by a variety of cationic amphiphiles including propranolol, quinine, amiodarone, imipramine and amitriptyline, and the benzodiazepine R05-4864. Although the IC50 values for the two processes are not equal, the ratio of IC50 values for the two processes appears to be the same for all drugs. Measurements of net transmembrane proton fluxes that occur during the assays reveal that respiration-induced swelling is associated with extensive proton ejection, the peak of which coincides with the maximum rate of anion transport. Moreover, from measurements of matrix buffering power, it is estimated that the matrix pH is 3 units more alkaline during respiration-induced swelling than during A23187-induced swelling. It is also shown that the IC50 for A23187-induced transport is pH-dependent in a manner consistent with modulation of drug binding by protonation of two sites. These findings allow the difference in IC50 values for the two types of assay to be explained by the pH dependence of the binding constant for the drug. Furthermore, the pH gradient generated during respiration-induced swelling is so large that the electrical component of the proton-motive force will be negligible. Thus, despite the fact that the mitochondria are \"energized,\" rapid electrophoretic anion influx is possible. These data provide evidence that the transport of anions in these two types of assay occurs via the same pathway.", 
    "28": "The effect of propranolol on the accumulation of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) in the isolated, perfused working rat heart was investigated. Ischemia was induced by lowering the afterload pressure to 0 mm Hg for 20 min and for reperfusion, the pressure was raised to the pre-ischemic pressure (60 mm Hg) for 20 min. The heart was frozen for biochemical studies immediately after ischemia or reperfusion. Ischemia decreased mechanical function, increased the levels of palmitoleic, arachidonic and linoleic acids, left oleic, lauric, myristic, palmitic and stearic acids unchanged, decreased the levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), creatine phosphate (CrP) and the energy charge potential (ECP), and increased the level of lactate. Propranolol (10(-5) or 3 x 10(-5) M) restored mechanical function and inhibited the changes in NEFA, ATP and ECP caused by ischemia. It is suggested that propranolol inhibits the decrease in mechanical function and high energy phosphates caused by ischemia, and thereby inhibits the accumulation of NEFA, especially of the unsaturated fatty acids such as arachidonic acid, during ischemia.", 
    "29": "Treatment of rats for 21 days with tetrabenazine, a drug which depletes monoamines and is used behaviorally to screen for antidepressants, significantly decreased 5-HT2 receptor density, increased alpha 1-adrenoceptor density but did not alter beta-adrenoceptor density in homogenates of frontal cortices labeled with [3H]ketanserin, [3H]prazosin and [3H]dihydroalprenolol, respectively. These effects were not opposite to those of the antidepressant drug imipramine which decreased both 5-HT2 and beta-adrenoceptor density and did not alter alpha 1-adrenoceptor density. Some evidence for antagonistic interactions between the two drugs was found in that imipramine partially prevented the tetrabenazine-induced increase in alpha 1-adrenoceptor density and tetrabenazine partially prevented the imipramine-induced decrease in beta-adrenoceptor density. Neither drug altered phosphoinositide hydrolysis coupled to alpha 1-adrenoceptors. While the effects of tetrabenazine are frequently attributed to its reserpine-like action of depleting monoamines, these results provide the first indication that tetrabenazine alters 5-HT2 and beta-adrenoceptor density in a manner different from that of reserpine.", 
    "30": "A randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to compare the effects of treatment with prazosin, propranolol, or hydrochlorothiazide on the following variables: blood pressure, cognitive and psychomotor skills, cardiovascular reactivity to natural and laboratory challenges, and serum lipid and lipoprotein levels. Side effects were recorded and patients evaluated how they felt during their treatment. Sixty-nine men, 35 percent black, aged 25 to 55 (mean 51.3) years, with diastolic blood pressures between 90 and 104 mm Hg (mean, 93.3 mm Hg), completed the study. There were no differences between active treatment groups in the proportion of patients with controlled blood pressure during the maintenance phase of the study. In the cognitive and psychomotor tests, the hydrochlorothiazide group showed significantly less improvement from baseline than the other treatment groups on the block design subscale of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised, and there was a trend for the propranolol group to have less improvement from baseline than the other groups on the digit span subscale. There were no other significant pretreatment to post-treatment changes in the other cognitive or psychomotor tests, the Russell Revision of the Wechsler Memory Scale, or a number of computerized reaction-time and signal-detection tasks. In the reactivity testing, there was a significantly lower increase in heart rate in the prazosin group compared with placebo during the second laboratory challenge of the Stroop Color Interference Test. Post-treatment declines in ambulatory blood pressure were seen in all of the drug treatment groups in average and maximal diastolic and systolic blood pressures. Both propranolol and hydrochlorothiazide treatment resulted in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels that were higher than baseline and the hydrochlorothiazide treatment had significantly increased total cholesterol levels. In contrast, the prazosin-treated group experienced no adverse changes in these parameters. Overall, the propranolol group had significantly more moderate and severe side effects than did the other three groups. Considering the pattern of blood pressure control, cognitive and psychomotor effects, changes in lipid levels, and magnitude of side effects, prazosin seems to have the most advantageous profile in this study of the three anti-hypertensive agents evaluated.", 
    "31": "The efficacy and tolerability of the alpha-blocker prazosin was compared with that of atenolol, a beta-blocker, in the long-term treatment of uncomplicated, essential hypertension. Twelve patients were randomly assigned to prazosin treatment and 15 to treatment with atenolol. Drug therapy was titrated to reduce diastolic blood pressure by 10 mm Hg or to below 89 mm Hg, whichever was lower. If monotherapy with either study drug failed to do this, hydrochlorothiazide was added to the regimen. Once blood pressure control was established, patients received maintenance therapy at that dosage and were followed for up to 12 months. Blood pressure, side effects, and plasma lipid levels were monitored during this period. Seventy-five percent of patients receiving prazosin monotherapy attained blood pressure goals, compared with 60 percent of patients given atenolol monotherapy. With the addition of low-dose hydrochlorothiazide, those patients not having an adequate response to monotherapy attained blood pressure control. Blood pressure reductions were maintained without dosage adjustment throughout the maintenance period; patient acceptance was good, and there was no evidence of tolerance. Treatment with atenolol produced slight increases in plasma triglyceride levels and little change in total or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. In contrast, patients treated with prazosin demonstrated no adverse effects with regard to lipid levels. Although a higher percentage of patients reached goal blood pressure with prazosin monotherapy than with atenolol, the response rates were comparable when hydrochlorothiazide was added to the regimens.", 
    "32": "A 24-week, crossover, comparison study was conducted to observe the effects of alpha-blockade with prazosin and beta-blockade with propranolol on blood pressure and plasma lipoprotein levels in 15 hypertensive cigarette smokers. Before treatment, mean sitting blood pressure was 140/100 mm Hg and rose to 147/105 mm Hg after the patients smoked two cigarettes. Treatment with prazosin and propranolol lowered sitting blood pressure to 127/89 mm Hg and 129/91 mm Hg, respectively (not significant), and did not alter the pressor response to smoking. The total cholesterol level at baseline was 207.3 +/- 11.0 mg/dl. This increased to 210.5 +/- 10.2 mg/dl with propranolol treatment and decreased to 201.0 +/- 11.1 mg/dl with prazosin treatment. The low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level was 132.5 +/- 8.1 mg/dl at baseline, 136.9 +/- 8.3 mg/dl with propranolol treatment, and 129.4 +/- 9.0 mg/dl with prazosin treatment (0.05 less than p less than 0.10 between-group comparison). The data indicated that whereas prazosin and propranolol are equally effective in controlling blood pressure in hypertensive cigarette smokers, effects on plasma lipoproteins also may need to be considered when selecting a first-step antihypertensive agent in this coronary-prone population.", 
    "33": "Hypertension and diabetes mellitus frequently coexist and are independent risk factors for reduced peripheral perfusion. Antihypertensive medications that reduce blood pressure and improve peripheral perfusion would have advantages in diabetic hypertensive patients. In a randomized, two-placebo-period, single-blind, two-way, crossover study, finger and forearm blood flow, lipid levels, and blood pressure control were determined in 19 diabetic hypertensive patients given prazosin and atenolol, with each drug and placebo period lasting four weeks. Both drugs reduced blood pressure (sitting, 157/95 to 142/84 mm Hg for atenolol and 155/95 to 138/82 mm Hg for prazosin; standing, 154/94 to 144/84 mm Hg for atenolol and 154/94 to 133/81 mm Hg for prazosin). Lipid levels did not change, except that low-density lipoprotein levels decreased from 148 to 127 mg/dl with prazosin. Atenolol did not change forearm or finger blood flow or vascular resistance. Prazosin increased blood flow and reduced vascular resistance in both finger and forearm. In conclusion, prazosin demonstrated a potentially more appropriate hemodynamic profile than atenolol in diabetic hypertensive patients in this study.", 
    "34": "Preliminary results are presented for the first 13 patients to complete an ongoing crossover study comparing the effects of prazosin and propranolol on blood pressure control, in which blood lipid profiles were monitored. The study population consisted predominantly of white men (mean age, 67.5 years) with mild-to-moderate hypertension and coexisting hypercholesterolemia (mean plasma cholesterol level, 244 mg/dl). Both agents resulted in statistically significant reductions in diastolic blood pressure. It is recognized that with prazosin use, there are generally no adverse changes noted between pre- and post-treatment lipid levels. The results of this study demonstrated a 243.5 mg/dl total cholesterol level at baseline and 229.5 mg/dl maintenance levels following prazosin treatment. In contrast, the results following propranolol treatment showed a tendency to increase plasma levels of triglycerides and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and to reduce levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein2 cholesterol. Because of a great deal of variability in lipid responsiveness to the study drug, none of the above changes attained statistical significance. Additional data from this ongoing study are required to confirm these preliminary observations.", 
    "35": "Fourteen male patients (mean age +/- SD, 52 +/- 11 years) with a history of hypertension (systolic blood pressure, 148 +/- 10 mm Hg; diastolic blood pressure, 99 +/- 2 mm Hg) were enrolled in a cross-over trial of prazosin and atenolol, with a minimum of eight weeks of treatment with each drug. Measures of lipoprotein metabolism included levels of: total plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein2 cholesterol. Lipoprotein mass was measured by analytical ultracentrifugation in low-density to very low-density lipoprotein flotation rate intervals of 0 to 12, 12 to 20, and 20 to 400, and high-density lipoprotein flotation rate intervals of 0 to 3.5 and 3.5 to 9.0. Apolipoproteins A1 and B, postheparin lipoprotein and hepatic lipase activities, and magnitude of postprandial lipemia also were determined. Mass of intermediate-density lipoproteins (flotation rate, 12 to 20) was significantly lower (p = 0.05) following prazosin therapy compared with atenolol therapy. Other lipid parameters, including triglycerides and low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, were not significantly different for the two drug treatments.", 
    "36": "We evaluated maximal performance during cycle ergometry and treadmill exercise in 14 hypertensive male joggers treated with prazosin or atenolol in an unblinded, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Maximal oxygen uptake was measured during both exercise modalities; cardiac output was measured only during cycle ergometry using the acetylene rebreathing technique. Both drugs reduced resting systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Prazosin reduced total peripheral resistance during submaximal exercise but had little effect on maximal cycle and treadmill performance. Atenolol, in contrast, reduced treadmill duration, maximal oxygen uptake, and heart rate compared with placebo. Atenolol also increased stroke volume and the arterial venous oxygen difference and reduced cardiac output during cycle exercise. Both drugs produced similar reductions in exercise diastolic pressure, but exercise systolic pressure was lower only during atenolol treatment. Prazosin was better tolerated by the subjects and was preferred by 10 of the men. We conclude that both drugs effectively reduced resting blood pressure, but that atenolol decreased exercise cardiac output and may impede exercise performance in physically active hypertensive subjects.", 
    "37": "The long-term effects of prazosin and propranolol therapy were compared over the course of one year in 93 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Thirty-four of the 44 patients randomly assigned to receive prazosin therapy and 38 of the 49 patients assigned to propranolol therapy received monotherapy for one year, whereas the remaining patients received concomitant hydrochlorothiazide therapy. Blood pressure was significantly decreased (p less than 0.01) in all treatment groups throughout the study compared with baseline measurements. The blood pressure responses to treatment were not shown to differ among patients with low, normal, or high renin levels on entry. No significant differences from baseline were noted among treatment groups with regard to lipid profiles. In summary, prazosin and propranolol were shown to have comparable long-term blood pressure-lowering effects when given as monotherapy in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension.", 
    "38": "Twenty hypertensive patients entered a crossover, placebo-controlled study of prazosin and labetalol that was designed to compare treatment effects on blood pressure control and lipid parameters. Both drugs significantly reduced sitting and standing systolic and diastolic blood pressures (p less than or equal to 0.01). No significant differences were noted between treatment groups in total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. However, a trend toward an increase in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels was seen during therapy with labetalol, whereas in contrast, no such effect was seen during treatment with prazosin.", 
    "39": "To study the mechanisms by which adrenergic antagonists affect blood pressure and plasma lipid levels, the effects of alpha-blockade with prazosin were compared with those of beta-blockade with propranolol in 23 normolipidemic, mildly hypertensive patients. Plasma lipoprotein composition, apolipoproteins, and some of the processes involved in lipid synthesis and clearance from plasma were investigated also. Patients entered an eight-week placebo period during which they were free of all antihypertensive medications. They were then randomly assigned under double-blind conditions to treatment with either prazosin (mean dose, 5 mg per day) or propranolol (mean dose, 133 mg per day) for eight weeks. Doses of both drugs were titrated to achieve either a decrease in diastolic blood pressure of 10 mm Hg or more or a reduction of diastolic blood pressure to less than 85 mm Hg, whichever was lower. Total plasma cholesterol decreased by 9 percent during prazosin treatment and increased by 7 percent during propranolol treatment (p less than 0.005 between treatments). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased by 12 percent with prazosin and increased by 12 percent with propranolol (p less than 0.005). Apolipoprotein B decreased by 17 percent with prazosin and increased by 15 percent with propranolol (p less than 0.005). There were no significant changes in total high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, its subfractions high-density lipoprotein2 or high-density lipoprotein3, or in apolipoprotein A1 and apolipoprotein A2. Plasma very low-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein triglycerides were not significantly affected by either treatment. Plasma post-heparin lipase activities, which clear triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol from plasma, were not altered significantly. Since regional blood flow could affect the clearance of plasma lipoproteins, measurements were taken of forearm blood flow, forearm vascular resistance, and maximal forearm vasodilatory potential during reactive hyperemia. The adrenergic antagonists had no effect on these measurements, nor did they affect cellular cholesterol synthesis as measured by the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase in blood mononuclear cells. The results of this study demonstrate differing actions between alpha- and beta-adrenergic antagonism. Alpha-blockade produced significantly lower levels of plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein B than beta-adrenergic antagonism without changes in high-density lipoproteins.", 
    "40": "A 23-year-old woman was hospitalized because of life-threatening monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) of 150 beats/min. An intravenous bolus of lidocaine was without effect but 25 mg ajmaline converted the tachycardia to sinus rhythm. A total of 70 mg ajmaline was subsequently infused because of frequent ventricular premature systoles. During this treatment polymorphic VT with very wide QRS complexes developed, but spontaneously disappeared after ajmaline had been discontinued. The case demonstrates the need for taking into account the potential risk of a proarrhythmic effect of anti-arrhythmic drugs.", 
    "41": "Relationship between blood pressure and brain renin was studied in four groups of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY); as controls (n = 5), administered captopril (n = 5), trichlormethiazide (n = 5) and atenolol (n = 5). 1) Inactive renin in the hypothalamus of captopril-administered SHR was significantly lower than that of control SHR and captopril-administered WKY. On the other hand, active renin in the hypothalamus, thalamus and striatum of captopril-administered SHR was significantly lower than that of control SHR and captopril-administered WKY. 2) Inactive renin in the hypothalamus of trichlormethiazide administered SHR was significantly lower than that of control SHR and trichlormethiazide-administered WKY. On the other hand, active renin in the hypothalamus, thalamus and midbrain of trichlormethiazide-administered SHR was significantly lower than that of control SHR and trichlormethiazide-administered WKY. 3) Inactive renin in the hypothalamus of atenolol-administered SHR was significantly lower than that of control SHR and atenolol-administered WKY. On the other hand, active renin in the hypothalamus, thalamus and midbrain of atenolol-administered SHR was significantly lower than that of control SHR and atenolol-administered WKY. These results suggest that the production and/or activation of renin in the hypothalamus, thalamus, midbrain and striatum play an important role in the initiation and/or development of hypertension of SHR by the local generation of angiotensin II.", 
    "42": "In the awake restrained rat the intrathecal (i.th.) administration of 8.1 pmol-8.1 nmol of bradykinin (BK) and kallidin (KD) enhanced the reaction time (RT) to a noxious radiant heat stimulus in a dose-dependent manner. The fragments BK-(1-8) and BK-(1-7) were active only at doses higher than 10 nmol and the following rank order of potency was observed: BK greater than KD much greater than BK-(1-8) greater than BK-(1-7). The increment of tail-flick latency was greatest at 1 (BK) or 6 (KD) min and the RT returned to basal levels within 15 min post-administration. The effect of BK (81 pmol) was unaffected by the prior i.th. administration of propranolol and naloxone but was significantly potentiated by prazosin (P less than 0.05). In contrast, the response to BK was significantly blocked (P less than 0.001) by phentolamine, idazoxan and yohimbine as well as by treatment with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) at a dose of 20 micrograms (i.th.) 1 week earlier. The latter pretreatment reduced the antinociceptive effect of i.th. tyramine (7 mumol) and potentiated that to noradrenaline (NA) (0.6 nmol) (P less than 0.01) while it preserved both the antinociceptive effect of neurokinin B (8 nmol) and the hyperalgesic effect of substance P (6.5 nmol). A biochemical analysis revealed that 6-OHDA treatment reduced the NA content in the lumbar spinal cord by 60% without affecting the levels of serotonin, dopamine, adrenaline or their main metabolites. There were also significant reductions in NA content in cervical (44%) and thoracic (55%) spinal cord. Pretreatment with 6-OHDA for a longer survival period (2 weeks) caused a further decrease of NA in the lumbar spinal cord (88%); however, the serotonin and dopamine levels were reduced in all regions examined. These results suggest that BK (kinins) may inhibit spinal nociceptive sensory transmission and produce analgesia by acting presynaptically on terminals of bulbospinal NA-containing fibers.", 
    "43": "A number of long-term clinical trials involving over 40,000 patients have been performed to study the effectiveness of antihypertensive therapy in controlling high blood pressure and in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension. Only diuretics and beta blockers have been studied in long-term trials to determine their efficacy in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The Hypertension Detection and Follow-Up Program (HDFP), Medical Research Council (MRC) trial, European Working Party on Hypertension in the Elderly (EWPHE) trial, Australian Therapeutic Trial in Mild Hypertension, and the Veterans Administration Cooperative Study all showed a reduction in stroke rate. The EWPHE and HDFP trials were the only studies to show a statistically significant reduction in mortality from myocardial infarction. All of these were diuretic-based; in addition, the MRC trial also used a beta blocker as first-step therapy in 1 cohort. The International Primary Prospective Prevention Study in Hypertension and Heart Attack Primary Prevention in Hypertension (HAPPHY) trials compared beta-blocker and non-beta-blocker or diuretic-based therapies and found no significant difference between the treatment groups in the incidence of stroke or cardiac events. Neither study had a control group, so it was impossible to determine if there was any reduction in stroke or cardiac events. The Metoprolol Atherosclerosis Prevention in Hypertension trial, an extension of the HAPPHY trial, showed that smokers receiving the beta blocker metoprolol had a significantly lower cardiovascular mortality rate than those randomized to a diuretic drug. However, subgroup analysis of the HAPPHY data showed no differences in the effect of beta blockers and diuretics in smokers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "44": "Current guidelines recommend initiating antihypertensive therapy at a diastolic blood pressure greater than 90 mm Hg when nonpharmacologic measures have been unsuccessful. The risk of heart attack and stroke is increased regardless of whether the elevation of blood pressure is primarily systolic alone, diastolic alone, or both. In treating mild to moderate hypertension and in prevention and wellness programs in normotensive persons with a family history of the disease, the initial approach should be nonpharmacologic. Patients who remain hypertensive should proceed to drug therapy. Low-dose thiazide diuretics remain the preferred first step in elderly patients. In patients younger than age 40 years, especially those with tachycardia, a beta blocker may be used as the first step. Treatment should be initiated with less than a full dose, only proceeding to a full dose if necessary. If there is any appearance of extrasystoles, or a decrease in potassium levels to below 3.5 mEq/liter in the elderly, a potassium-sparing diuretic combination should be used. Although there is growing evidence that the effects of diuretic drugs on potassium may contribute to arrhythmias and sudden death, there is also increasing data suggesting that conserving electrolytes during diuretic therapy may obviate these ill effects.", 
    "45": "Although it is a common belief that all antihypertensive agents are equally effective in reducing blood pressure, there is some evidence to the contrary, both in the general population and when specific patient demographics are considered. In black patients, beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to be less effective at reducing blood pressure than the thiazide diuretics. After age 60, the percentage of responders to beta blockers is less than with calcium antagonists, and a higher percentage of elderly patients also achieve normotensive blood pressure levels with diuretic therapy than with beta blockers. When a thiazide diuretic is added to an ACE inhibitor, beta blocker or calcium antagonist, the number of normotensive responders increases significantly. Combinations of some other agents (i.e., an ACE inhibitor plus a beta blocker) may not, however, improve efficacy. Diuretics, beta blockers and ACE inhibitors are all generally well tolerated, with a 9 to 10% incidence of subjective side effects. The use of calcium antagonists and especially the centrally acting adrenergic inhibitors may result in more frequent adverse effects. Data from long-term, diuretic-based clinical trials do not support the statement that diuretic therapy results in sustained elevations in lipid levels. These trials have shown cholesterol levels to be at or below baseline after long-term diuretic therapy. The use of beta blockers, on the other hand, may result in long-term elevation of triglyceride levels and a slight decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Calcium antagonists and ACE inhibitors do not affect lipid levels, and alpha blockers may actually lower cholesterol levels and increase high-density lipoprotein levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "46": "The widespread use of Holter monitoring has demonstrated that the majority of ischemic episodes occur during activities that do not require exertion. These episodes tend to occur at only minimal increases in heart rate above resting levels, well below the level of myocardial oxygen demand required to produce ischemia on formal exercise tolerance testing. In all likelihood, therefore, most ischemic events in ambulatory patients are due to a combination of flow-limiting coronary stenosis and superimposed vasoactive or thrombotic elements. Asymptomatic ischemic events are common in subsets of patients with angina pectoris. Traditionally, treatment with calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, and long-acting nitrates has been aimed at reducing episodes of angina pectoris. Despite a reduction in anginal symptoms, however, it is likely that patients continue to experience silent ischemia, particularly at rest and during activities of daily living. The strategy for treatment in such patients should include the abolition of the patients' \"total ischemic activity.\" It is conceivable that more aggressive anti-ischemic therapy may improve prognosis, as patients with ambulatory ST-segment depression experience frequent cardiac events. Other potential benefits of more aggressive treatment include the prevention of myocardial hibernation, which occurs as a result of a chronic ischemic state, and a reduction in episodes of myocardial stunning. This approach may lead to protection against transient and chronic left ventricular dysfunction, which is associated with a poor prognosis in patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease.", 
    "47": "Patients with silent myocardial ischemia can be classified as one of three clinical types: those who are totally asymptomatic (type 1), those who are asymptomatic after a myocardial infarction (type 2), and those who demonstrate both asymptomatic and symptomatic episodes (type 3). Total ischemic activity may be similar in any given patient, but the ratio of symptomatic to asymptomatic episodes will differ. Prognosis appears dependent on the degree of total ischemic activity plus the extent of coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction. The effects of therapy can be monitored with exercise testing and/or Holter monitoring. Using the latter technique, the largest multicenter study to date, the Nifedipine Total Ischemia Awareness Program, has demonstrated the advantages of adding a calcium antagonist to nitrate and/or beta-blocker therapy regimens in order to maximize the reduction in total ischemic activity in angina patients.", 
    "48": "The interaction of quinine with K+ and Na+ transport mechanisms has been investigated in Ehrlich ascites tumor cells. Quinine affects both Ca2+-dependent K+ channel and total K+ influx. Activation of Ca+-dependent K+ channels by propranolol is abolished by quinine (1 mM). In addition, quinine inhibits the ouabain-sensitive component of K+ influx with an apparent Ki of 0.32 +/- 0.02 mM and the furosemide-sensitive component with a Ki of 0.24 +/- 0.01 mM. Furthermore, a significant fraction (52%) of Na+ influx is inhibited by quinine. The same component is sensitive to amiloride, suggesting that it represents Na+/H+ antiport. Concomitant with the inhibition of K+ and Na+ transport, quinine stimulates ATP hydrolysis by 57%. The results suggest that quinine exerts broad, nonspecific effects on cellular mechanisms which serve to regulate cation transport in Ehrlich cells.", 
    "49": "A placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study was conducted to determine the effects of nifedipine (60 to 90 mg per day) monotherapy and propranolol (240 mg per day) monotherapy on symptoms, angina threshold, and cardiac function in patients with chronic stable angina. Following a two-week placebo period, patients were randomly assigned to receive either nifedipine or propranolol for a five-week treatment period, after which they crossed over to the alternative regimen. All 21 patients were men with chronic stable angina pectoris, 13 of whom had symptoms both at rest and on exertion. New York Heart Association functional class improved in patients taking either nifedipine or propranolol, and nitroglycerin consumption decreased with both treatments compared with placebo. Nifedipine significantly delayed the onset of chest pain and 1 mm of ST-segment depression during bicycle exercise; increases with propranolol were smaller and not statistically significant. Nine patients had a preferential clinical response to nifedipine compared with six patients to propranolol; this was unrelated to the presence or absence of pain at rest or to any baseline hemodynamic finding. Nifedipine and propranolol were equally effective in relieving exertional ischemia as shown by improvement in radionuclide ejection fraction at identical work loads. Exercise wall motion, assessed by a semiquantitative wall motion score, also improved with both drugs. Propranolol treatment decreased exercise cardiac output by 14 percent (p = 0.01) through its effect on heart rate. In contrast, nifedipine treatment had no effect on cardiac output. Thus, nifedipine is more effective on several measurements than propranolol when administered as single drug therapy in stable angina and has the advantage of preserving cardiac output during exercise.", 
    "50": "Glycinergic mechanisms have been implicated in central cardiovascular regulation. However, the inhibitory amino acid's role in the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS), the site of termination of cardiovascular afferents, has not been clarified. Thus, we sought to determine if the microinjection of glycine into the NTS alters arterial pressure and heart rate. Microinjections of glycine, like glutamate, confined to the NTS decreased arterial pressure and heart rate in a neurally mediated, dose-dependent manner. The glycine antagonist strychnine completely blocked these effects of glycine but did not itself alter arterial pressure or heart rate, or interfere with the baroreceptor reflex. The acute hypotensive, bradycardic response to glycine was followed by a period during which glycine essentially eliminated the cardiovascular responses to the microinjection into the NTS of glutamate, an amino acid reputed to be a transmitter in the baroreceptor reflex arc. These data suggest that glycine is involved in cardiovascular regulation by the NTS but do not support its being an integral transmitter in the baroreceptor reflex.", 
    "51": "Clinical experience with the calcium channel-blocking agents has established their efficacy in the therapy of painful and silent myocardial ischemia. Questions have arisen, however, about side-effect characteristics of these medications as clinical practice has led to utilization of higher doses of individual drugs than employed in large numbers of patients in early clinical trials as well as combinations with other antianginal agents including beta-blockers. A study was undertaken to examine the published literature regarding side effects associated with high-dose versus low-dose therapy with nifedipine and diltiazem and the use of these agents in combination with beta-blockers. This investigation demonstrated that utilization of high-dose diltiazem (more than 240 mg per day) as opposed to low-dose diltiazem (no more than 240 mg per day) was associated with an increased incidence of atrioventricular block, and increased peripheral vasodilatory effects. In contrast, the use of high-dose nifedipine (more than 60 mg per day) was not associated with atrioventricular block. At clinically high dosage levels, the incidence of peripheral edema was comparable for both nifedipine and diltiazem, although low-dose nifedipine resulted in a significantly greater incidence of edema compared with low-dose diltiazem. This analysis also demonstrated that bradyarrhythmia is associated with the combination of a beta-blocking agent and either low- or high-dose diltiazem, but not with nifedipine-beta-blocker combinations. Clinical experience suggests caution in the combined use of diltiazem and a beta-blocking agent because of the demonstrated additional adverse negative chronotropic and dromotropic effects. No additional adverse electrophysiologic effects have been noted for nifedipine-beta-blocker combinations. The literature analysis supports and mirrors widespread clinical experience obtained since nifedipine and diltiazem were introduced. It should be noted, though, that combination therapy with calcium channel blockers and beta-blockers should be done with caution, since there have been occasional reports of congestive heart failure or exacerbation of angina with this combination.", 
    "52": "To study the effect of propranolol on the Ca2+- or Pb2+-activated K+ permeability in human erythrocytes, K+ effluxes were compared with single-channel currents. The results demonstrate that propranolol has a twofold effect: (1) it renders the channel protein more sensitive to Ca2+ or Pb2+; and (2) it simultaneously inhibits channel activity and slightly reduces single-channel conductance. The number of active channels is not affected.", 
    "53": "To determine the effects of intravenous metoprolol on left ventricular (LV) function in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), 16 patients were studied within 48 hours of Q-wave AMI (mean ejection fraction 47 +/- 6%, mean pulmonary artery wedge pressure 22 +/- 6 mm Hg) with high fidelity pressure and biplane cineventriculography before and after intravenous metoprolol (dose 12 +/- 4 mg). Heart rate decreased from 90 +/- 13 to 74 +/- 11 beats/min (p less than 0.001), pulmonary arterial wedge pressure and LV end-diastolic pressure were unchanged (22 +/- 6 to 21 +/- 6 and 27 +/- 8 to 26 +/- 8 mm Hg, respectively), despite impaired LV relaxation (P = Poe-t/T) after intravenous metoprolol (T from 59 +/- 13 to 72 +/- 12 ms, p less than 0.001). Peak systolic circumferential LV wall stress decreased after beta-adrenergic blockade (330 +/- 93 to 268 +/- 89 g/cm2, p less than 0.05) and LV contractility decreased (dP/dtmax from 1,480 +/- 450 to 1,061 +/- 340 mm Hg/s, p less than 0.001). The ejection fraction decreased (48 +/- 7 to 43 +/- 7%, p less than 0.05) due to an increase in LV end-systolic volume (85 +/- 19 to 93 +/- 19 ml, p less than 0.05) since LV end-diastolic volume was unchanged (161 +/- 30 to 163 +/- 30 ml, difference not significant). In patients with Q-wave AMI, intravenous metoprolol reduces the major determinants of myocardial oxygen demand including heart rate, contractility and peak systolic wall stress. Further, despite decreased heart rate, (+)dP/dtmax, ejection fraction, isovolumic relaxation, LV end-diastolic pressure and end-diastolic volume remain unchanged.", 
    "54": "Within the framework of the control of cardiovascular diseases the prophylaxis of the sudden heart death is an actual problem of health policy and medicine. Since the most frequent cause of the sudden heart death is the coronary heart disease, elements of the primary and secondary prophylaxis of the coronary heart disease are also of importance for the prevention of the sudden heart death. Central points of the prophylaxis of the sudden heart death are the improvement of the prehospital care and the shortening of the prehospital times of delay in acute myocardial infarction as well as the recognition, registration and care of risk persons. Nowadays the demand is existing more to fulfil these tasks in the daily practice. The actual possibilities of the medicamentous prophylaxis are analysed and discussed. More and more comprehensive knowledge about the prophylactic effect of the beta-receptor blockers as to the reduction of the frequency of the sudden hearth death is existing. They are most effectful in persons with a high risk particularly after an acute myocardial infarction. Though beta-receptor blockers shall cause changes of the serum lipids, on the basis of a more fundamental analysis of literature can be stated, since there is no clue to it, that beta-receptor blockers further the development of arteriosclerosis. On the contrary there are references for the fact that the development of arteriosclerosis is delayed. For this reason the demand has to be made to fully use the therapeutical potential of the beta-receptor blockers in the therapy of the chronic cardiovascular diseases and their complications.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "55": "The effects of galanin and somatostatin on insulin release, membrane potential, and cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration [( Ca2+]i) were investigated using beta-cells isolated from obese hyperglycemic mice. Whereas insulin release was measured in a column perifusion system, membrane potential and [Ca2+]i were measured with the fluorescent indicators bisoxonol (bis-(1,3-diethylthiobarbiturate)trimethineoxonol) and quin 2, in cell suspensions in a cuvette. Galanin (16 nM) and somatostatin (400 nM) suppressed glucose-stimulated insulin release in parallel to promoting repolarization and a reduction in [Ca2+]i. The reduction in [Ca2+]i comprised an initial nadir followed by a slow rise and the establishment of a new steady state level. The slow rise in [Ca2+]i was abolished by 50 microM D-600, a blocker of voltage-activated Ca2+ channels. Both peptides suppressed insulin release even when [Ca2+]i was raised by 25 mM K+. Under these conditions the inhibition of insulin release was partly reversed by an increase in the glucose concentration. Addition of 5 mM Ca2+ to a cell suspension, incubated in the presence of 20 mM glucose and either galanin, somatostatin, or the alpha 2-adrenergic agonist clonidine (10 nM), induced oscillations in [Ca2+]i, this effect disappearing subsequent to the addition of D-600. The effects of galanin, somatostatin, and clonidine on [Ca2+]i were abolished in beta-cells treated with pertussis toxin. In accordance with measurements of [Ca2+]i, treatment with pertussis toxin reversed the inhibitory effect of galanin on insulin release. The inhibitory action of galanin and somatostatin on insulin release is probably accounted for by not only a repolarization-induced reduction in [Ca2+]i and a decreased sensitivity of the secretory machinery to Ca2+, but also by a direct interaction with the exocytotic process. It is proposed that these effects are mediated by a pertussis toxin-sensitive GTP-binding protein.", 
    "56": "The bronchopulmonary effects of fentanyl were studied in mechanically ventilated, paralyzed guinea pigs that had been anaesthetized with pentobarbitone sodium. Fentanyl did not alter the resting bronchial tone but enhanced the bronchoconstrictor effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine in a dose-related manner. The enhancement induced by 20 micrograms kg-1 fentanyl was suppressed by pretreatments with 0.5 mg kg-1 naloxone or 5 mg kg-1 propranolol, but did not change after 3 mg kg-1 atropine. The bronchoconstrictor responses to histamine were also enhanced by 20 micrograms kg-1 fentanyl. These results suggest that fentanyl-induced airway hyperreactivity is not mediated by an increase in vagal tone but is due to a reduction in the central sympathetic drive and/or in the levels of circulating catecholamines, which occurs through stimulation of opiate receptors.", 
    "57": "Sprague-Dawley rats were first trained on an inhibitory avoidance task (IA) and then, two weeks later, on a Y-maze discrimination task (YMD). Bilateral intra-amygdala injections were given through implanted cannulae immediately post-training. Retention was evaluated one week following training on each task. Naloxone (0.1, 0.3 or 1.0 microgram) facilitated retention performance in both tasks. The most effective doses were 0.1 microgram for the IA task and 0.3 microgram for the YMD task. Since naloxone (0.1 microgram) did not affect retention when administered via cannulae implanted in either the caudate-putamen or cortex dorsal to the amygdala, the effects of intra-amygdala naloxone is not due to diffusion of the drug to these brain regions. Intra-amygdala injections of the beta 1,2-adrenoceptor blocker propranolol (0.3 microgram) blocked the memory enhancing effects of intra-amygdala naloxone (IA: 0.1 microgram; YMD: 0.3 microgram) administered concurrently immediately post-training. We interpret these findings as indicating that the enhancing effects of intra-amygdala naloxone are mediated by the activation of beta-noradrenergic receptors within the amygdala. Such effects are presumably due to blocking of inhibitory effects of opioid peptides on the release of norepinephrine.", 
    "58": "Nebivolol is a chemically novel, potent and selective beta 1-adrenoceptor-blocking agent that acutely lowers arterial blood pressure in hypertensive patients and rats without depressing, or even enhancing, left ventricular function. These properties could be compatible with a partial agonistic effect of beta-adrenoceptor-blocking agents. It was the aim of the present study to investigate whether nebivolol has intrinsic sympathomimetic properties. The study was performed on reserpinized dogs and spontaneously hypertensive rats, and on various isolated tissues from various species. Unlike pindolol and practolol, nebivolol did not exert a stimulating effect on the heart rate and left ventricular function in reserpinized animals and/or in isolated atria of reserpinized rats at doses that are clinically active. Nebivolol did not induce relaxation of isolated coronary arteries and saphenous veins at concentrations that block beta-adrenoceptors. These findings indicate that nebivolol is devoid of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity at clinically relevant doses.", 
    "59": "We characterized beta-adrenoceptors in rat sinoatrial node (SA) and stellate ganglia by incubating consecutive tissue sections with [125I]iodocyanopindolol, with or without the beta 1-selective (CGP 20712A) or the beta 2-selective (ICI 118,551) antagonists, followed by quantitative autoradiography. In the stellate ganglia, ICI 118,551 displaced more than 90%, and CGP 20712A less than 5%, of the binding sites. CGP 20712A displaced about 50% of the binding sites in the SA, and about 65% in the rat atria. The SA has a high percentage of beta 2-adrenoceptors and the stellate ganglia contains almost exclusively beta 2-adrenoceptor binding sites, implicating beta 2-adrenoceptors in the control of heart rate in the rat.", 
    "60": "The effect of cathinone and amphetamine on brown adipose tissue thermogenesis and its modification with propranolol and timolol has been studied in rats. Both cathinone and amphetamine produced significant dose dependent increases in intracapsular brown adipose tissue (IBAT) and rectal temperatures. Amphetamine was found to be three times more potent as compared to cathinone, on a dose basis. Pretreatment of animals with propranolol and timolol individually inhibited cathinone and amphetamine induced hyperthermia. These findings suggest the involvement of beta adrenergic receptors in cathinone and amphetamine induced thermogenesis.", 
    "61": "This study has characterised the distribution of bufuralol 1'-hydroxylase activity in various organs of male and female Sprague-Dawley rats. Microsomes were prepared from the liver, kidney, brain, kidney, spleen and adrenals of male and female rats. Measurement of 1'-hydroxybufuralol produced by the incubation of racemic, (+) and (-) bufuralol with the microsomes was by HPLC. The specific activity (nmol/min/mg protein) of bufuralol 1'-hydroxylase in various tissues were: liver (M 12.3; F 10.2), kidney (M 12.3; F 11.7), brain (M 8.9; F 9.0), adrenal (M 0.9; F 0.3), lung (M 4.6; F 3.6) and spleen (M 8.8; F 10.0). Stereoselective preference (+/-) of the isozyme for (+) bufuralol was: Liver (M 2.2; F 2.2), kidney (M 2.2; F 2.1), brain (M 1.0; F 0.9), lung (M 0.74; F 0.95) and spleen (M 1.0; F 1.32).", 
    "62": "The role of three-iodine-thyronine, noradrenaline (NA), adrenaline (A), reserpine and propranolol in extinguishing of trace-effects of the long-term cold adaptation was studied in rats. A possibility to control the process of the temperature disadaptation through administration of different hormonal drugs, was shown. Three-iodine-thyronine and NA proved to be the most effective in this respect. Weakening of sympathetic-adrenal effects by means of combined reserpine and propranolol during the disadaptation accelerated the process of extinguishing of practically all the trace-effects of the long-term cold adaptation.", 
    "63": "1. In a placebo-controlled study of the antiarrhythmic and electrophysiological properties of atenolol and mexiletine, programmed electrical stimulation (PES) was performed in three groups of six conscious greyhounds, 7-30 days after coronary artery ligation. 2. In the placebo group, repeated PES challenge resulted in the consistent induction of ventricular tachycardias (VT) in 4/6 dogs and ventricular fibrillation in 2/6. Atenolol prevented arrhythmia induction in 4/6 dogs, one continued to demonstrate a VT and one died (P less than 0.05 compared with placebo). In the mexiletine group 5/6 dogs continued to demonstrate a VT and one died. 3. Electrocardiographic parameters were not affected by any treatment. There was no change in blood pressure in any group but when compared with placebo, heart rate fell (P less than 0.05) after atenolol (256 micrograms kg-1) and increased (P less than 0.05) after mexiletine (16 mg kg-1). Effective (ERP) and functional (FRP) refractory periods did not change after mexiletine, but ERP was prolonged (P less than 0.05) after atenolol. 4. The results indicate that atenolol but not mexiletine is effective in preventing re-entrant arrhythmias in this conscious canine model. Antiarrhythmic efficacy may be related to a fall in heart rate and/or a prolongation of refractoriness.", 
    "64": "Two multiple dose crossover pharmacokinetic studies were carried out to determine the steady-state bioavailability of newly formulated generic propranolol HCl tablets relative to Inderal tablets. In Study I, 24 healthy volunteers were dosed with 4 x 10 mg test tablets, 1 x 40 mg test tablet, 4 x 10 mg Inderal tablets, and 40 mg of propranolol HCl in solution. In Study II, 24 healthy volunteers were dosed with 1 x 80 mg test tablet, 1 x 80 mg Inderal tablet, and 80 mg of propranolol HCl in solution. Both studies were of randomized design with each formulation administered every 8 h for 15 doses. Serial plasma samples were obtained for 8 h after morning doses on Days 4 and 5 of each treatment period and assayed for propranolol using a validated HPLC method. Mean plasma concentration-time data for test tablets and reference tablets were superimposable in both studies. Pharmacokinetic parameters from Days 4 and 5 were combined for statistical analysis since subjects were determined to have reached steady-state. Mean AUC, Cmax, tmax, and Cmin values were not statistically different between test tablets and Inderal tablets in either study. Based on these findings, the test tablets demonstrated the same rate and extent of propranolol absorption as did corresponding Inderal tablets. Therefore, the test tablets and Inderal tablets were determined to be bioequivalent.", 
    "65": "The purpose of this study was to dissociate the authentic and artifactual effect of in vivo heparin on drug protein binding using protamine as an inhibitor of ex vivo lipolysis. A mixture of ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA, 5 mg ml-1) and protamine in the concentration range of 0 to 7.5 mg ml-1 was added to blood samples from 23 cardiac catheterized patients before (control) and 10 min after 3000 IU of intravenous heparin. In control samples, protamine does not interfere with the protein binding of lidocaine (L), quinidine (Q) or propranolol (P) when plasma pH is readjusted to 7.4. In the absence of protamine, heparin induced a significant increase in the free fraction by 40, 130, and 30 per cent for L, Q, and P, respectively (p less than 0.001), while free fatty acid (FFA) levels increased 2 to 6 fold. When protamine was present, the heparin-induced elevation in free fraction was significantly lower for L (16 per cent) and Q (77 per cent) but not for P; FFA levels were decreased at all protamine concentrations. Residual increases in free fraction and FFA levels compared to control values may represent the true in vivo effect of heparin at the peak activity of lipoprotein lipases. For L and Q, variations in free fraction were strongly associated with variations in FFA, but for P, no significant correlation was observed (r = 0.492). These results indicate that variations in free fraction of L and Q caused by heparin are, to a large extent, artifactual but may be prevented by use of protamine in collection tubes (5 to 7.5 mg ml-1). For P, the increase in free fraction was not mediated by variations of FFA indicating that another mechanism must be involved.",

    "67": "Fifteen patients were studied by echocardiography, apexcardiogram and carotid pulse tracings in four ways: basally; on propranolol 40 mg, three times daily; on disopyramide 200 mg single dose, three days after propranolol discontinuation; and on both drugs. The following data were measured: systolic anterior mitral motion slope, systolic anterior mitral distance from the septum, outflow tract diameter, the A wave to the total apexcardiographic excursion ratio, carotid pulse contour and left ventricular ejection time index. Propranolol did not produce any significant changes while disopyramide was much more effective in changing the data in a direction suggesting diminution of left ventricular outflow gradient. The combination of propranolol and disopyramide had the greatest influence. Fourteen patients received the two drugs for 12.3 +/- 4.3 months with improvement of NYHA class.", 
    "68": "The effect of short- and long-term administration of carteolol on renal function has been examined in healthy subjects and in hypertensive patients with or without renal failure. In healthy subjects neither a single dose of 10 mg carteolol nor continuous administration of 20 mg/day for 7 days had any effect on creatinine clearance and renal blood flow. In all subjects the clearance rate of carteolol was about 400 ml/min and its fractional excretion of carteolol exceeded 300%, suggesting that the drug is secreted actively from renal tubules. Twenty-three hypertensive patients with or without renal dysfunction were given carteolol 10 to 20 mg/day for more than 50 weeks in addition to their standard antihypertensive regimens, which were left changed. Laboratory results were compared with the mean values of 50 weeks before and after the addition of carteolol, and none, including plasma creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and electrolytes, were significantly changed. Neither the estimated glomerular filtration rate nor the effect of the drug on blood pressure changed significantly during this prolonged treatment. It is concluded that carteolol had no effect on renal function in healthy subjects and in hypertensive patients with or without renal failure.", 
    "69": "The pharmacokinetic interaction between diltiazem and three beta-adrenoceptor blockers propranolol, metoprolol and atenolol was investigated in healthy volunteers given diltiazem 30 mg or placebo t.d.s. for 3 days, followed by a single dose of propranolol 20 mg, metoprolol 40 mg or atenolol 50 mg. The AUCs of propranolol and metoprolol were significantly increased after diltiazem and it significantly prolonged the elimination half-life of metoprolol. In contrast, it did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of atenolol. Propranolol significantly decreased the resting pulse rate after diltiazem pretreatment as compared to placebo. The results indicate that diltiazem impaired the clearance of propranolol and metoprolol, which are principally metabolized by an oxidative pathway, and that the kinetic interaction between diltiazem and propranolol may partly be related to the significant reduction in the pulse rate produced by the latter.", 
    "70": "Beta-adrenergic blockade with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) causes less depression of resting and submaximal heart rate (HR) than non-ISA beta-blockers. The effects of these drugs on exercise haemodynamics have not been well studied. We evaluated effects of pindolol, propranolol and placebo during rest and steady-state exercise on cardiac output, oxygen consumption, calf blood flow, HR and blood pressure in 18 healthy subjects. Pindolol 5 mg and propranolol 80 mg given twice daily, reduced maximal exercise HR by 50 and 52 beats.min-1 respectively, confirming similarity of beta 1-blockade. Resting cardiac output was unchanged in all three groups after one week of therapy. Cardiac output, measured during steady-state exercise decreased in the propranolol group (18.3 vs 15.6 l.min-1) with no significant changes in pindolol (15.7 vs 16.01.min-1) or placebo (18.6 vs 17.3 l.min-1). The rise in cardiac output, from rest to exercise, was similarly attenuated by propranolol but not by pindolol or placebo. Exercise stroke volume increased 12% on pindolol (123-140 cc) and decreased 7% on propranolol (143-133 cc). Neither drug had a detrimental effect on exercise calf blood flow compared to placebo. Thus, unlike propranolol, pindolol with ISA, maintains a normal cardiac output during submaximal exercise.", 
    "71": "This study examined the ability of a skeletal muscle-powered assist ventricle to augment cardiac output in 10 dogs with experimentally induced heart failure. Heart failure was induced with the use of the beta-blocking agents atenolol and propranolol. A \"skeletal muscle ventricle\" was then surgically constructed by wrapping the rectus abdominis muscle, with an intact neurovascular supply, around a double open-ended compressible pouch. The skeletal muscle ventricle was then interposed in a left ventricular apicoaortic conduit. The motor nerves to the skeletal muscle ventricle were stimulated by a custom designed pulse generator and caused tetanic contraction of the ventricle during diastole of every fourth natural heart beat. Stimulation was continued for 60 min. Cardiac output, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, mean blood pressure, left ventricular end diastolic pressure, and central venous pressure were then monitored prior to, during, and several times after skeletal muscle ventricle stimulation to evaluate assist ventricle function. There was an increased cardiac output in all 10 dogs at all recording times during skeletal muscle ventricle assistance compared to the cardiac output prior to stimulation of the assist ventricle. The mean increase in cardiac output after 30 min of assist ventricle stimulation was 31.0 +/- 14% (P less than 0.01), and at 60 min was 8.0 +/- 1% (P less than 0.05). The mean diastolic blood pressure after 1 and 30 min of skeletal muscle ventricle assistance (50.0 +/- 2.9 and 48.6 +/- 2.2 mm Hg, respectively) was increased (P less than 0.05) vs the preassistance value (44.9 +/- 2.8 mm Hg).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "72": "Atrial fibrillation due to hyperthyroidism is characterized by a rapid ventricular response which is typically resistant to digoxin therapy. We report a patient with atrial flutter-fibrillation who developed cyclic sinus node dysfunction with profound ventricular pauses in response to small doses of digoxin, verapamil, and propranolol, which resolved with discontinuation of the medications. Caution is necessary to avoid paradoxical ventricular slowing when treating hyperthyroid-induced atrial fibrillation.", 
    "73": "A 59-yr-old man was given over a 30-month period a cumulative dose of 36 g of propranolol for treatment of angina pectoris. He then presented with respiratory disease, having all the clinical, radiologic, and functional characteristics of interstitial pneumonitis. No other cause of pneumonitis was found. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) showed a lymphocytic alveolitis with lymphocyte subset inverted ratio. After a 9-wk period of drug withdrawal, clinical and radiologic improvement was observed along with resolution of BAL abnormalities. Propranolol therapy was resumed for 6 wk and induced the recurrence of BAL abnormalities. Propranolol treatment was finally stopped, and 15 wk later, clinical symptoms abated, chest roentgenogram and pulmonary function tests were improved, and BAL data returned to normal. This observation seems to exemplify the possible diagnostic value of coupling provocation test with BAL cell data in some hypersensitivity pneumonitis induced by drugs. In addition, these data support the role of a cell-mediated immunologic mechanism in the pathogenesis of propranolol-induced pneumonitis.", 
    "74": "Altered autonomic tone as well as humoral factors can change the intrinsic rate of the cardiac pacemaker. To study the relationships of neurogenic and humoral factors on intrinsic heart rate (IHR) we used sinoaortic deafferentation (SAD) to increase sympathetic activity, lesion of nucleus ambiguus to reduce central parasympathetic activity, and one-kidney, one-clip (1K1C) renal hypertension to transiently increase the activity of the renin-angiotensin system and the combination of 1K1C hypertension with SAD. In conscious rats, IHR was determined using combined blockade with atropine and propranolol. Rats with 1K1C hypertension (7th day) showed increased mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and IHR. Rats with SAD (4th day) demonstrated increased MAP and HR, but in contrast, had decreased IHR. Lesion of nucleus ambiguus increased HR and decreased IHR. When 1K1C hypertension was combined with SAD an additional increase in MAP and HR occurred, whereas IHR was reduced compared with renal hypertension alone. These data suggest that IHR is influenced greatly by autonomic tone and that the tachycardia in renal hypertension is linked to increased IHR that is dependent on integrity of the baroreflex.", 
    "75": "R224-R230, 1989.--[125I]iodocyanopindolol ([125I]ICYP) and [3H]rauwolscine were used to quantitate, respectively, the beta- and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors in freshly isolated bovine cerebral microvessels and in pericyte cultures derived from these microvessels. Morphological and immunocytochemical criteria distinguished the pericytes from endothelial cells. Competitive binding studies established the specificity of the radioligand binding. The maximal number of binding sites (Bmax) for [125I]ICYP in the pericytes constituted only 8% of that in the microvessels (3.5 +/- 1.3 vs. 44.4 +/- 6.6 fmol/mg protein). In contrast, the Bmax for [3H]rauwolscine in the pericytes was 50% of that in the microvessels (55.4 +/- 11.8 vs. 111.1 +/- 9.5 fmol/mg protein). The dissociation constants for both [125I]ICYP and [3H]rauwolscine were similar in the two preparations. No alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, as defined by the specific binding of [3H]prazosin, were identified either in the pericytes or microvessels. Overall, our results suggest that pericytes contribute minimally to the total beta-adrenoceptor number of cerebral microvessels, and thus the beta-adrenoceptors must be located predominantly on endothelial cells. However, the contribution of pericytes to the total alpha 2-adrenoceptor number of the microvessels may be substantial.", 
    "76": "The effects of adrenodemedullation and/or adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists on plasma epinephrine (E) and norepinephrine (NE) concentrations during exercise were investigated in rats. Exercise consisted of strenuous swimming against a countercurrent for 15 min in a pool with water of 33 degrees C. Before, during, and after swimming, blood samples were taken through a permanent heart catheter. E was not detectable in plasma of adrenodemedullated (Adm) rats. A marked reduction in the normal exercise-induced increase in plasma NE concentrations occurred in both Adm rats as well as in intact rats injected with the beta 2-selective adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118551. Intravenous infusion of either E or the beta 2-selective agonist fenoterol restored the increase in plasma NE in Adm rats. Injection of the alpha 2-selective antagonist yohimbine in combination with infusion of the beta 2-selective agonist fenoterol into Adm rats caused an enormous increase in plasma NE. It is concluded that all NE in plasma as released during exercise originates from the peripheral nerve endings of the sympathetic nervous system. Adrenal E influences the release of NE via activation of presynaptic beta 2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "77": "The present study evaluates possible effects of adrenal catecholamines, released by splanchnic nerve stimulation, on adrenal medullary blood flow (MQ) and adrenal catecholamine secretion (CS). Twelve pentobarbital-anesthetized mongrel dogs were subjected to three identical splanchnic nerve stimulations (5 V, 20 Hz, for 3 min) at 30-min intervals, and MQ (radiolabeled microsphere technique) and CS (high-performance liquid chromatography) were measured before and during each nerve stimulation. Animals were assigned to one of three groups and administered either saline, pindolol (1 and 4 mg/kg), or prazosin (1 and 4 mg/kg) before the second and third nerve stimulation, respectively. In the saline control group, each nerve stimulation resulted in similar increases in MQ and CS. Pindolol attenuated nerve stimulation-induced increases in MQ and CS by 50%, but had no effect on medullary catecholamine concentration. Prazosin augmented nerve stimulation-induced MQ, CS, and medullary catecholamine concentration by 35%. These data suggest that adrenal adrenergic receptors modulate elicited CS and mediate changes in adrenal medullary vascular tone.", 
    "78": "We examined type II 5'-iodothyronine deiodinase activation by adrenergic agonists in dispersed brown adipocytes from euthyroid and hypothyroid rats. In euthyroid cells, basal deiodinase activity was 30-100 fmol I-.h-1.10(6) cells-1 and increased four- to fivefold during exposure to norepinephrine, an effect that was enhanced by alprenolol. In cells from hypothyroid rats, norepinephrine caused a three- to fourfold greater deiodinase stimulation than occurred in euthyroid cells but alprenolol inhibited the response. In euthyroid cells, phenylephrine caused greater stimulation than did norepinephrine, but this was inhibited by alprenolol. Isoproterenol and 8-bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-BrcAMP) inhibited the phenylephrine response but were modestly stimulatory alone. Although both alpha 1- and beta-adrenergic agonists increased deiodinase activity modestly in hypothyroid cells, in combination they caused a marked synergistic stimulation. This synergism was induced by 8-BrcAMP and forskolin, as well as by isoproterenol. The stimulation of deiodinase in both cell types was due to an increase in Vmax without an alteration in the Km and required mRNA synthesis. The markedly greater deiodinase response of the hypothyroid brown adipocyte to catecholamines may serve to enhance the impaired thermogenic response of this tissue to cold exposure.", 
    "79": "Effects of beta-adrenergic blockade on regional myocardial dysfunction induced by coronary artery occlusion were studied in chronically instrumented, conscious dogs before (n = 8) and after (n = 7) collateral development. Intravenous atenolol or propranolol produced no beneficial effects on systolic shortening in the area rendered ischemic during 2 minutes of circumflex occlusion, before collateral development. After the collateral development by repetitive 2-minute coronary occlusions, regional asynergy recovered to the preocclusive level during 2 minutes of occlusion. Both atenolol and propranolol significantly improved the peak reductions of regional shortening by 19 +/- 9% and 18 +/- 9%, respectively (p less than 0.05 versus without beta-blockade). These beneficial actions of beta-blockade were again noted during atrial tachypacing at matched heart rates of 160 +/- 11 beats/min. Thus the beneficial effects of beta-blockade on regional asynergy during coronary occlusion depend on the level of functional state of the collaterals and cannot be totally accounted for by the reduction in heart rate or by the cardioselectivity.", 
    "80": "The aim of the study was to determine whether regional beta-adrenergic blockade via the coronary sinus limited myocardial damage after coronary artery occlusion in the canine model. Accordingly, open-chest anesthetized dogs were randomly allocated to one of three groups: a control group and groups treated with propranolol (in doses of 0.02, 0.2, and 2.0 mg/kg) given either intravenously or via the coronary sinus. The hypoperfused zone (i.e., risk area) and the extent of myocardial damage were assessed by autoradiography and triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining, respectively. Myocardial damage expressed as a percent of the hypoperfused zone was 84 +/- 5% in the control group (n = 9) and 78 +/- 7% (0.02 mg/kg, n = 7, NS), 63 +/- 6% (0.2 mg/kg, n = 7, p less than 0.05), and 62 +/- 7% (2.0 mg/kg, n = 9, p less than 0.02) in the groups receiving intravenous propranolol and 73 +/- 6% (0.02 mg/kg, n = 7, NS), 58 +/- 7% (0.2 mg/kg, n = 7, p less than 0.01), and 44 +/- 9% (2.0 mg/kg, n = 9, p less than 0.001) in groups receiving propranolol via the cardiac veins. There was a significant enhancement of myocardial salvage with increasing doses of propranolol delivered via the cardiac veins (linear regression trend, p less than 0.05). In contrast, myocardial damage expressed as a percent of the hypoperfused zone remained comparable with propranolol doses of 0.2 and 2.0 mg/kg administered intravenously (linear regression trend, NS).", 
    "81": "(1) regional beta-adrenergic blockade via the cardiac veins afforded significant myocardial salvage and (2) the regional administration of propranolol resulted in significant reduction of myocardial damage in a dose-dependent fashion.", 
    "82": "Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) were treated with a combination of a beta 1-blocker (metoprolol) and a calcium antagonist (felodipine) from 1 to 4 or from 4 to 6 months of age. The main trunk and peripheral branches of the mesenteric arterial tree were fixed by immersion and embedded in plastic. The total length of the internal elastic membrane and the media area were measured in cross-sectioned arteries. The ratio between media thickness (m) and luminal radius (ri) was then determined for a calculated, standardized condition, assuming a smooth and circular internal elastic membrane. The treatment caused a significant decrease in blood pressure and a reduction in m/ri ratios in the mesenteric arterial trunk as well as in mesenteric arterial branches when initiated in young as well as in adult SHR and SHRSP, i.e. the therapy efficiently prevents as well as reverses hypertensive arterial changes. The m/ri ratios in the superior mesenteric arterial trunks were significantly smaller in treated 4-month-old SHR and SHRSP than in WKY, although their blood pressures were not fully normalized. There was a marked increase in luminal radius in the young treated rats, possibly secondary to a therapy-induced increase in splanchnic blood flow.", 
    "83": "This article reports a modified liquid chromatographic fluorescence assay that has proved in our laboratory to give robust performance for the purposes of therapeutic drug monitoring. The sample preparation involves extraction of alkalinized plasma into 1-pentanol/chloroform and back extraction into HCl. Acceptable reproducibility and accuracy data are presented over the concentration range normally encountered in patient samples. The detection limit (25 ng/ml) is approximately one-tenth the lowest calibration standard used in our laboratory for quantitating patient pre-dose specimens, making the method applicable to pharmacokinetic studies.", 
    "84": "In order to evaluate whether the changes in the electrical systole/electromechanical systole ratio (QT/QS2) may reflect the effects of beta-adrenergic stimulation on the heart, we studied the variations of this ratio induced by active standing. We studied 45 healthy volunteers aged 15 to 82 years, subdivided into three groups; Group 1 (mean age 22 +/- 4 years), Group 2 (mean age 44 +/- 6 years), and Group 3 (mean age 74 +/- 6 years). Fifteen subjects repeated the test after propranolol administration (0.1 mg/kg iv). Resting QT/QS2 ratio increased slightly, but not significantly, with age. Upright position significantly increased QT/QS2 ratio in all groups. Changes in heart rate (r = -.43), electromechanical systole (r = .55) and QT/QS2 were significantly correlated with age. Propranolol prevented the increase in QT/QS2 ratio induced by active standing. Therefore, QT/QS2 changes induced by standing are correlated with age and are inhibited or reduced by beta-blockade. QT/QS2 changes can be used to monitor adrenergic activity, even if their value is limited by the overlapping responses of the individual cases.", 
    "85": "The relative contributions of the debrisoquin and mephenytoin isozymes of hepatic cytochrome P-450 to the stereoselective metabolism of propranolol have been studied in a panel of volunteers of known oxidative phenotypes. Six subjects were extensive metabolizers of both debrisoquin and mephenytoin (EM). Four subjects were poor metabolizers of debrisoquin but rapid for mephenytoin (PMD). Five subjects were poor metabolizers of mephenytoin but rapid for debrisoquin (PMM), and one individual had a deficiency for both test compounds (PMD/M). Partial metabolic clearances of each propranolol enantiomer to 4-hydroxypropranolol (4-OH-P), the sulfate, and glucuronide conjugates of 4-OH-P, naphthoxylactic acid (NLA) and propranolol glucuronide, were estimated after a single oral dose of racemic propranolol (80 mg). The partial metabolic clearance of both enantiomers to total 4-OH-P in the PMD group was 75% less than in the EM and PMM groups, indicating the contribution of the debrisoquin isozyme to this route of metabolism. The R/S ratios for the clearance to 4-OH-P were similar between EM and PMD (2.5 +/- 0.5 vs 2.5 +/- 0.4, respectively), implying that the different enzymes involved in ring hydroxylation (i.e., the debrisoquin isozyme and other hydroxylases) have similar stereoselective preferences. The partial metabolic clearance to NLA was 55% less in the PMM group than in the EM and PMD groups, indicating that S-mephenytoin 4-hydroxylase contributes to the metabolic conversion of propranolol to NLA. The R/S ratios for the clearance to NLA were close to unity in all groups. The partial metabolic clearance to propranolol glucuronide also did not exhibit stereoselectivity and was similar in all groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "86": "Liver dextromethorphan O-demethylation to dextrorphan is associated with the debrisoquin type of oxidation phenotype in humans. We studied dextromethorphan oxidation in vitro using human liver microsomes to investigate the kinetics of the polymorphic monooxygenase (cytochrome P-450 db1) and factors that may influence its activity. In microsomal preparations from six extensive metabolizers the reaction parameters were: Michaelis-Menten constant = 3.4 +/- SD 1.0 mumol/L and maximum rate of metabolism = 10.2 +/- 5.3 nmol x mg P-1 x hr-1, vs 48 mumol/L and 2.2 nmol x mg P-1 x hr-1, respectively in microsomes prepared from the liver of one poor metabolizer. The reaction was inhibited by nonspecific monooxygenase inhibitors such as SKF 525-A (Ki = 100 nmol/L) and cimetidine (Ki = 40 mumol/L), by known substrates of the polymorphic isozyme such as [+]-bufuralol (Ki = 7.5 mumol/L), debrisoquin (Ki = 25 mumol/L), and sparteine (Ki = 45 mumol/L), and by the selective cytochrome P-450 db1 inhibitor quinidine (Ki = 15 nmol/L). This assay permits in vitro screening for candidate substrates or inhibitors of the polymorphic isozyme.", 
    "87": "Propafenone is a new class 1 antiarrhythmic agent. The drug is extensively metabolized. 5-Hydroxylation and N-dealkylation constitute major metabolic pathways. Recently it has been demonstrated that the in vivo metabolism of propafenone is controlled by the debrisoquin/sparteine polymorphism. To elucidate which of the above metabolic reactions is catalyzed by cytochrome P-450db1, the formation of 5-hydroxypropafenone and N-desalkylpropafenone was studied in the microsomal fraction of four human kidney donor livers previously characterized with regard to their ability to hydroxylate the beta-adrenergic antagonist bufuralol. The l'hydroxylation of bufuralol is catalyzed by the P-450db1 responsible for polymorphic debrisoquin/sparteine oxidation. The formation of 5-hydroxypropafenone but not N-desalkylpropafenone was closely related to bufuralol l'hydroxylation. Incubation with LKM1 antibodies, which selectively recognize P-450db1, inhibited 5-hydroxypropafenone formation completely whereas N-dealkylation was unimpaired. Propafenone was a strong competitive inhibitor of bufuralol l'hydroxylation. Thus it can be concluded that 5-hydroxypropafenone is formed by the cytochrome P-450 isozyme involved in polymorphic bufuralol oxidation.", 
    "88": "Invasive and noninvasive investigations suggest that the hemodynamics of pregnant hypertensive patients are heterogeneous. Nineteen pregnant patients were evaluated before changes in antihypertensive therapy. Cardiac output was measured by Doppler technique. Blood pressure was measured by automated cuff. Systemic vascular resistance was calculated. Two distinct groups were identified on the basis of differences in cardiac output (p less than 0.0001) and systemic vascular resistance (p less than 0.0001). Those with high resistances were treated with hydralazine. A modest antihypertensive effect was achieved (-6.9 mmHg, p = 0.01), but systemic vascular resistance was dramatically reduced, (-534 dyne.sec.cm-5, p less than 0.0001) and was associated with a compensatory increase in cardiac output (2.0 liters/min, p less than 0.0001). Those with a high cardiac output were treated with atenolol. An antihypertensive effect was achieved, (-17.0 mm Hg, p = 0.008), which was associated with a reduction in cardiac output (-2.8 liters/min, p less than 0.0001).",

He had taken a long-acting propranolol product the previous evening that had been prescribed for migraine headaches. After administration of epinephrine subcutaneously in the ED, he developed a severe adverse reaction, characterized by profound hypertension and bradycardia. This potentially serious drug interaction is described, and relevant literature is reviewed.", 
    "90": "The isolated perfused human pancreas was employed as a model in which electrical stimulation of the celiac mixed neural bundle was performed in the presence and absence of selective neural antagonists. Stimulation of the celiac neural bundle in the presence of hyperglycemia resulted in augmentation of pancreatic polypeptide release. Cholinergic stimulation appears to predominate, whereas beta-adrenergic fibers stimulate pancreatic polypeptide-cell secretion, and alpha-adrenergic fibers inhibit pancreatic polypeptide release. During euglycemia, both cholinergic stimulation and gastric inhibitory polypeptide infusion resulted in a marked release of pancreatic polypeptide. These stimulatory effects were additive, which suggests a linked hormonal and neural mechanism of pancreatic polypeptide release after a meal. In this in vitro human model, our data confirm that the splanchnic innervation of the pancreas has a potent regulatory role in pancreatic hormone release in man.", 
    "91": "We present seven cases of tremor caused by mild head injury without loss of consciousness. The interval between head trauma to onset of symptoms was 1 to 4 weeks. A posture and kinetic tremor of the hands and head occurred unassociated with other neurologic signs. Myoclonic-like jerking was frequently present. Neuroimaging studies were normal. Clonazepam administration resulted in tremor reduction in three patients and propranolol decreased tremor in one patient. A tremor, similar to essential tremor, can be a rare complication of head trauma."
