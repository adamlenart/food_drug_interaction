Guinea pig hearts were perfused at 37 degrees C and constant pressure with oxygenated Tyrode solution. Ca paradox was induced by 10 min Ca free perfusion followed by 10 min Ca repletion. 10(-6) M d-sotalol was administered either during Ca depletion or during Ca repletion period. Electrical activity and ventricular contraction were simultaneously recorded and subcellular alterations were analysed. The contraction terminated in 5 min of Ca free perfusion and electrical activity disappeared within 5 min of Ca repletion. Nonuniform injury of myocardial tissue was observed. The majority of cardiomyocytes were irreversibly injured and profound dissociation of intercellular junctions was detected. Administration of d-sotalol during Ca free period preserved electrical activity and restored ventricular contraction accompanied by apparent protection of the ultrastructure, including intercellular connections. Uniform patterns of sarcomeres reflected synchronous contraction and protection of junctional couplings. In conclusion, d-sotalol attenuates Ca paradox injury. It seems that the protective effect of d-sotalol is most likely related to inhibition of potassium efflux antagonizing Na loading during Ca depletion period, as well as to attenuation of excess of [Ca2+]i via acceleration of sarcoplasmic Ca exchange during Ca repletion.", 
    "1": "We have used a telemetry system to record heart rate, body temperature, electrocardiogram (ECG), and locomotor activity in awake, freely moving mice lacking thyroid hormone receptor (TR)-beta or TR-alpha1 and -beta (TR-alpha1/beta). The TR-alpha1/beta-deficient mice had a reduced heart rate compared with wild-type controls. The TR-beta-deficient mice showed an elevated heart rate, which, however, was unresponsive to thyroid hormone treatment regardless of hormonal serum levels. ECG revealed that the TR-beta-deficient mice had a shortened Q-Tend time in contrast to the TR-alpha1/beta-deficient mice, which exhibited prolonged P-Q and Q-Tend times. Mental or pharmacological stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system resulted in a parallel increase in heart rate in all animals. A single injection of a nonselective beta-adrenergic-receptor blocker resulted in a parallel decrease in all mice. The TR-alpha1/beta-deficient mice also had a 0.4 degrees C lower body temperature than controls, whereas no difference was observed in locomotor activity between the different strains of mice. Our present and previous results support the hypothesis that TR-alpha1 has a major role in determining heart rate under baseline conditions and body temperature and that TR-beta mediates a hormone-induced increase in heart rate.",

We measured serial regional cerebral blood flow using radiolabeled microspheres in animals with two different volumes of injected blood (2.8 mL [Group A, n = 6] and 4.4 mL [Group B, n = 6]) and compared them with control animals (n = 6). Intravenous labetalol was administered 90 mins after administration of hematoma, while maintaining cerebral perfusion pressure >65 mm Hg. Regional cerebral blood flow measurements were repeated 10 and 30 mins after labetalol administration.

    "9": "The sympathetic nervous system occupies a prominent role in heart failure both as a marker of severity of disease and also as an important factor in its progression. Beta blocker therapy, once thought heretical in heart failure, has consistently improved cardiac function and slowed progression of disease. Large clinical trials of mild to moderate heart failure show improved survival as well as reduction in hospitalization. Beta blockers now have stronger data in heart failure than converting enzyme inhibitors, and should be considered standard therapy in mild-moderate heart failure. Ongoing trials are addressing beta blocker therapy in advanced heart failure and comparisons between agents.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of two beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agents, propranolol and atenolol, on cell proliferation rates in the kidneys of male F344 rats. Immunohistochemical expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and mitotic index have been examined in formalin-stored kidneys from F344 rats used in an initiation-promotion study of carcinogenesis. Cell proliferation rate was quantified in the proximal tubule epithelium. Non-initiated rats and rats initiated with a single dose of diethylnitrosamine (DEN, 200 mg/kg, i.p.) were continuously treated with propranolol (75-100 mg/kg) or atenolol (300 mg/kg) by gavage and were sacrificed after 2, 4, 8 or 21 months of experimentation. There were two control groups, one untreated (D1) and one given distilled water by gavage (D1). Control group D1 showed significantly lower cell proliferation rates than the D0 group. In non-initiated rats, propranolol had a weak enhancing effect on cell proliferation, most evident after 4 months, while atenolol had a clear enhancing effect most evident after 8 months of promoting regimen. Treatment with DENalone resulted in a significant increase in cell proliferation rate as compared to group D1. In DEN-initiated rats given propranolol, there was a borderline significant increase in cell proliferation rates, compared to rats given DEN alone, after 8 months of promoting regimen. Atenolol had no effect. Because of the differences in body weight gain and food consumption observed among the various groups, it is suggested that the state of nutrition may have obscured the effects of beta-blockers on cell proliferation rates.",

After a mean follow-up of 13+/-10 months a PVS was again performed in patients, who had no evidence of progressive cardiac disease, who did not experience any arrhythmia recurrences or who were drug compliant.

Patients in the RAP and BAP groups were continuously paced at a rate of 100 pulses per minute for 96 h or until the onset of sustained AF (>10 min).

There were no serious complications related to pacing, although in three patients the pacemaker appeared to induce AF by pacing during atrial repolarization.",

    "27": "We studied 142 male subjects (30-69 yr) at a health care center in Kyoto, Japan. Electrocardiographic data were collected from subjects in a recumbent position for 10 min in the morning. Analysis was done by classifying the subjects into four age groups. In a pharmacological experiment carried out in December 1996, tone was verified to reflect the cardiac vagosympathetic balance, and entropy the total autonomic neural efferent activity. We assessed the heart rate variability through the tone-entropy (T-E) analysis that was described previously. In essence, two indexes, tone and entropy, were defined on a distribution of successive variations of heart period.", 
    "28": "No significant differences were detected in clinical conditions among the four age groups. Tone increased and entropy decreased significantly with age. The aging process was expressed as a curvilinear path in T-E space. Compared to the pharmacological experiment, it was observed that aging degenerated the heart function from an ordinary to a denervated one. The same aging path was superimposed in the opposite direction on the heart recovery path after dynamic exercise in which cardiac vagosympathetic balance tended toward vagus division, corresponding with restoration of total autonomic activity.", 
    "29": "An age-related reduction in cardiac autonomic function was consistent with previous reports. The vagosympathetic balance was altered with this reduction: vagal predominance was impaired significantly in proportion to the withdrawal of total cardiac autonomic activity.", 
    "30": "Social phobia has a direct effect on the ability of the individual to interact with others in social or work situations and as a result is associated with a high level of dysfunction. The level of impairment is as severe as that found in other chronic disorders such as depression and is increased by a cascade of comorbidity, which complicates management. Efficacy in social phobia was reported with the MAOIs and this led to the investigation of reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase-A (RIMA) which offer a safer alternative. The efficacy of moclobemide has been shown in social phobia and the effect is more clear cut in patients with more severe symptoms. The better effect in severe social phobia has also been reported with the SSRI paroxetine. Effective treatment of social phobia appears to be able to overcome the substantial chronicity of illness which is frequent in sufferers. The introduction of these treatments should encourage people with social phobia to seek medical help for this hitherto much neglected disorder.", 
    "31": "Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and ATP are cotransmitters of norepinephrine (NE). Modulation of ATP-mediated purinergic neurotransmission by NPY was investigated in rat perfused kidney. Beta,gamma-Methylene-L-ATP (beta,gamma-mATP; 1.0 to 1.5 microM, n = 8), NE (0.1 microM, n = 8), and NPY (0.1 microM, n = 14) increased perfusion pressure by maximally 12 +/- 1, 17 +/- 2, and 9 +/- 1 mmHg, respectively. In the presence of NPY, responses to ATP and NE were dramatically enhanced. Renal nerve stimulation in the presence of the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine (1 microM) induced pressor responses of 54 +/- 5 mmHg (n = 6). Alpha-blockade-resistant responses were abolished by the P2-purinoceptor blocker suramin (300 microM) and thus mediated by ATP. Purinergic responses were also reduced significantly (50%) by the NPY-Y1 receptor blocker BIBP 3226 (1 microM). NPY (0.1 microM) potentiated purinergic pressor responses and enhanced ATP release from 0.7 +/- 0.2 to 4.1 +/- 0.9 pmol (n = 4) associated with a significant increase of soluble ATPase activity. All NPY effects were prevented by BIBP 3226. Pressor responses to renal nerve stimulation delivered at short time intervals, mimicking enhanced sympathetic drive to the kidney, were not constant but showed a progressive rise, which was prevented by BIBP 3226. In this study, it is suggested that purinergic vasoconstriction in rat kidney depends on concomitantly released NPY. NPY by itself is only a weak vasoconstrictor but acts as a modulator of renal vascular resistance by enhancing the effects of its sympathetic cotransmitters, especially during sympathetic overactivity.",

All residents were healthy men under age 30 years. Prior to commencement of the study, all participants had successfully been administered a test dose of propranolol without side effects. The study took place over a 10-week period. At the conclusion of each case, both the resident and attending surgeon observer independently completed a form grading, on a sliding scale: (1) amount of overall tremor; (2) amount of tremor during placement of the first 3 sutures after lens or nucleus extraction; (3) anticipated difficulty of the case; (4) actual difficulty with the case; and (5) anxiety (surgeon only). In addition, the type of procedure performed, complications encountered, and surgeon side effects were recorded. The data were analyzed with a 2-way analysis of variance for unbalanced data.",

As judged by the resident surgeon, there was a highly significant effect of propranolol in decreasing anxiety (P = .0058), reducing surgical tremor overall (P < .0001), and reducing tremor while placing the first 3 sutures following lens extraction (P < .0001). There was no treatment-by-surgeon interaction for any of the measures. Complications and difficulty of the case, as judged by both the resident and attending surgeons, were not significantly different in the propranolol versus placebo groups (P > .05). There were no side effects reported or observed in any of the surgeons.",

    "37": "Previous work has shown that spontaneous and stimulated vagal activity is diminished in heart failure (HF) despite upregulation of functional postsynaptic cholinergic mechanisms. We therefore examined function of the postganglionic neuron in the paced canine model of HF as a possible site for diminished control.", 
    "38": "We measured sinus cycle length changes in response to electrical stimulation of preganglionic and postganglionic parasympathetic neurons innervating the sinoatrial node in control and HF dogs (both, n=8). Cervical vagus stimulation (preganglionic) demonstrated attenuated responses in the HF group at all levels of stimulation (P<0.05). Stimulation of the right atrial fat pad, containing both postganglionic nerves and terminals of preganglionic neurons, showed no such difference between control and HF (200+/-25 versus 192+/-18 ms). To ensure that preganglionic input and different levels of baseline sympathetic activity did not contribute to the group difference, similar stimulations were done in the presence of ganglionic and beta-adrenergic blockade. Under these conditions, postganglionic stimulation showed smaller changes in sinus cycle length, but the HF group response remained significantly higher than in controls (76+/-10 versus 20+/-2 ms; P<0. 01), indicating that the difference was independent of preganglionic input and sympathetic activity.", 
    "39": "A component of attenuated parasympathetic control in HF is located within the peripheral efferent limb. This defect is located within the parasympathetic ganglion. Future work should be focused on determining mechanisms of attenuated ganglionic transmission so that means targeted at restoring vagal activity can be developed.",

The authors discuss theoretical prerequisites for the administration of beta-blockers in chronic heart failure. They give an account of indications, contraindications and mode of treatment. The dosage pattern for different preparations is given. The authors summarize the results of major studies with beta-blockers: MDC, CIBIS, ANZ, US Carvedilol Trials and they outline the trends of future research and indications for treatment with beta-blockers.", 
    "41": "Therapeutic trials in hypertension taught us that a strategy based on a thiazide diuretic, or a beta-blocker as first-line drug, has reduced significantly the incidence of stroke (relative risk reduction: -35%), major coronary events (-14%), cardiovascular death (-18%) and heart failure (-42%). The level of cardiovascular risk, taking into account classical risk factors, multiplied by relative risk, offers the best estimate of therapeutic absolute benefit. In terms of prevention, being treated seems to be more important than the level of blood pressure that has been reached.", 
    "42": "The seven transmembrane helices of serpentine receptors comprise a conserved switch that relays signals from extracellular stimuli to heterotrimeric G proteins on the cytoplasmic face of the membrane. By substituting histidines for residues at the cytoplasmic ends of helices III and VI in retinal rhodopsin, we engineered a metal-binding site whose occupancy by Zn(II) prevented the receptor from activating a retinal G protein, Gt (Sheikh, S. P., Zvyaga, T. A. , Lichtarge, O., Sakmar, T. P., and Bourne, H. R. (1996) Nature 383, 347-350). Now we report engineering of metal-binding sites bridging the cytoplasmic ends of these two helices in two other serpentine receptors, the beta2-adrenoreceptor and the parathyroid hormone receptor; occupancy of the metal-binding site by Zn(II) markedly impairs the ability of each receptor to mediate ligand-dependent activation of Gs, the stimulatory regulator of adenylyl cyclase. We infer that these two receptors share with rhodopsin a common three-dimensional architecture and an activation switch that requires movement, relative to one another, of helices III and VI; these inferences are surprising in the case of the parathyroid hormone receptor, a receptor that contains seven stretches of hydrophobic sequence but whose amino acid sequence otherwise shows no apparent similarity to those of receptors in the rhodopsin family. These findings highlight the evolutionary conservation of the switch mechanism of serpentine receptors and help to constrain models of how the switch works.", 
    "43": "beta-Adrenergic receptors (beta-ARs) are members of the superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors that mediate the effects of catecholamines in the sympathetic nervous system. Three distinct beta-AR subtypes have been identified (beta1-AR, beta2-AR, and beta3-AR). In order to define further the role of the different beta-AR subtypes, we have used gene targeting to inactivate selectively the beta2-AR gene in mice. Based on intercrosses of heterozygous knockout (beta2-AR +/-) mice, there is no prenatal lethality associated with this mutation. Adult knockout mice (beta2-AR -/-) appear grossly normal and are fertile. Their resting heart rate and blood pressure are normal, and they have a normal chronotropic response to the beta-AR agonist isoproterenol. The hypotensive response to isoproterenol, however, is significantly blunted compared with wild type mice. Despite this defect in vasodilation, beta2-AR -/- mice can still exercise normally and actually have a greater total exercise capacity than wild type mice. At comparable workloads, beta2-AR -/- mice had a lower respiratory exchange ratio than wild type mice suggesting a difference in energy metabolism. beta2-AR -/- mice become hypertensive during exercise and exhibit a greater hypertensive response to epinephrine compared with wild type mice. In summary, the primary physiologic consequences of the beta2-AR gene disruption are observed only during the stress of exercise and are the result of alterations in both vascular tone and energy metabolism.", 
    "44": "To assemble expert clinical experience and judgment regarding the treatment of anxiety disorders in a systematic, quantitative manner, particularly with respect to changes during the preceding five years.", 
    "45": "A panel of 73 internationally recognized experts in the pharmacotherapy of anxiety and depression was constituted by multistage peer nomination. Sixty-six completed a questionnaire in 1992, and 51 of those completed a follow-up questionnaire in 1997. This report focuses on the experts' responses to questions about therapeutic options relevant to seven vignettes describing typical cases of different anxiety disorders.", 
    "46": "The preferred initial treatment strategy in 1992 was a combination of medication with a psychological therapy for all vignettes except simple phobia, where a psychological procedure alone was favored. There was little change in 1997, primarily some decrease in the choice of psychological therapy and some increase in the choice of medication for social phobia. Experts recommending a medication in 1992 most often chose as first-line treatment a benzodiazepine anxiolytic (BZ) for panic disorder (PD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), simple phobia, and adjustment disorder. They recommended a beta-blocker most often for social phobia and a tricyclic anti-depressant (TCA) for agoraphobia and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Nearly a fourth chose a combination of medications, usually a TCA plus a BZ. In 1997, the expert panel's most frequent recommendation for agoraphobia, PD, and OCD changed to a specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI); and they also recommended these compounds more often for GAD, social phobia, and simple phobia. Fewer experts chose BZs or TCAs. However, in 1997 many again chose a combination of medications, often a BZ plus a SSRI, so that, overall, there was only a small decline in recommendations for BZs. As second-line medications (1997 only), the experts recommended SSRIs most often for most vignettes, but a TCA for PD and GAD. Recommendations for a combination of medications rose substantially for most vignettes, usually a BZ plus an antidepressant.", 
    "47": "Combined cognitive-behavioral therapy plus medication was highly favored by the experts as the initial treatment strategy for anxiety disorders. During the preceding five years, SSRIs displaced older antidepressants as the experts' first-line choices for the pharmacotherapy of anxiety disorders. In case of an unsatisfactory response, the experts' second-line choices more often were an older antidepressant or a combination of an antidepressant plus a BZ. According to the experts' judgements, the BZs, especially combined with an antidepressant, remain mainstays of pharmacotherapy for anxiety disorders.", 
    "48": "It has previously been shown that the androgen, 5beta-dihydrotestosterone (17beta-hydroxy-5beta-androstan-3-one, 5beta-DHT), is able to produce an endothelium-independent vasodilating effect in rat aorta. The present study analyzed the mechanisms underlying the above vasodilator effect of 5beta-dihydrotestosterone, with particular emphasis on verifying a possible interaction with GABA(A) receptors, beta-adrenoceptors and Ca2+ channels. Rat aortic rings without endothelium were isometrically recorded. 5Beta-dihydrotestosterone produced a concentration-dependent relaxation on the contractions induced by noradrenaline (NA; 0.3 microM) or K+ (KCl; 60 mM), with the latter being more sensitive to 5beta-dihydrotestosterone-induced relaxation than the former; the concentration-response curves showed that 5beta-dihydrotestosterone is significantly more potent than 17beta-estradiol(1,3,5(10)-estratrien-3,17beta-diol) to induce vasodilatation. The vasodilating effect of 5beta-dihydrotestosterone on noradrenaline-induced contraction was resistant to blockade by the GABA(A) receptor antagonists, picrotoxin or bicuculline, and the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol, a finding that excludes an interaction of the steroid with GABA(A) receptors and beta-adrenoceptors. Interestingly, the contractions evoked by calcium in depolarized tissues were substantially inhibited by 5beta-dihydrotestosterone, implying that this steroid could be an endogenous calcium channel blocker; consistent with this finding, 5beta-dihydrotestosterone was able to relax tissues precontracted with the calcium channel opener, Bay K 8644. Moreover, although the rings precontracted with noradrenaline and potassium were almost equipotently relaxed by 5beta-dihydrotestosterone. Nifedipine was more potent than 5beta-dihydrotestosterone to block the potassium-induced contraction, but the steroid was more effective than nifedipine to prevent noradrenaline-induced contraction. The above results suggest that 5beta-dihydrotestosterone causes relaxation of rat aorta by acting directly on the membrane of smooth muscle cells; this non-genomic action may be explained in terms of a blockade of voltage- and receptor-dependent calcium channels, a mechanism that restricts the availability of extracellular calcium in the contractile machinery.",

AD was diagnosed using NINCDS-ADRDA criteria (McKhann et al., 1984), vascular dementia was diagnosed using draft ICD-10 criteria (World Health Organization, 1987) and the Ischemic Scale (Hachinski et al., 1975), major depression was diagnosed using an algorithm based on DSM-III-R criteria (American Psychiatric Association, 1987). The sample for the present study consisted of 481 subjects with AD and 140 with vascular dementia.",

The latter was studied for a hypotensive action and cardiohemodynamic effects as regards baseline type of circulation and pacing regimen. Proxodolol hypotensive action in hyperkinetic circulation is attributed primarily to a fall in the ejection (beta-adrenoblock), in hypo- and eukinetic circulation type--to reduction in cardiac postload (alpha-adrenoblock). In isolated ventricular stimulation proxodolol cardiodepressive effect was more pronounced than in atrial stimulation.

In order to delineate the direct drug effects from vascular insufficiency inherent in hypertensive states, the study was conducted on a normotensive animal model. The adverse effects of these drugs were estimated as changes in sexual behaviour and intracavernous pressure response of electrical stimulation in the treated rats compared to normal age-matched controls (n = 10, each group). Copulation studies indicated significant impairment of sexual function in the groups on propranolol and clonidine. The cavernous pressure response to nerve stimulation at the end of sixteen weeks further reinforced the gross compromise on sexual function in these two treated groups. In contrast, the captopril administration produced only marginal alterations to the responses recorded. The results from this study clearly indicate that propranolol and clonidine interfere with sexual behaviour and nerve mediated response to erection whereas captopril which is devoid of significant effects on these parameters, may be a better therapeutic option.",

    "64": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most frequent cardiac arrhythmia. However, despite manifold publications reflecting numerous clinical trials about treatment of AF, the management of this arrhythmia is still under controversial discussion, in daily clinical work as well as in research. The present study concentrates on three major questions: 1. How frequent are recurrences of AF in long-term follow-up? Most of the previous studies used the occurrence of symptoms as a surrogate parameter for recurrences of AF, despite the expected high rate of asymptomatic relapses. In the present study a daily transtelephonic ECG transmission enables a rhythm monitoring independent of symptoms. 2. Is the frequency of AF recurrences significantly reduced by antiarrhythmic medication? A direct comparison of class I and III antiarrhythmic drugs, which still are most frequently used for this indication, and of placebo will answer this question. 3. How safe is the long-term treatment for the prevention of AF recurrences with special respect to proarrhythmic effects? The daily transtelephonic ECG transmission enables a quantitative and qualitative monitoring of tachy- and bradyarrhythmias independent of symptoms. Additionally, the daily analysis of ECG measures may detect parameters predicting subsequent life threatening arrhythmias. The study design provides a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, multicenter parallel group comparison. In Germany and in the Czech Republic about 90 hospitals will include 900 patients with documented chronic AF, age 18 to 80 years, if they are eligible for electrical cardioversion without concomitant antiarrhythmic drug therapy and if they are anticoagulated for at least three weeks prior to inclusion. Neither the size of the left atrium nor the duration of chronic AF are exclusion criteria. A few hours after successful electrical cardioversion the patients are randomised either to sotalol (2 x 160 mg) or quinidine + verapamil (3 x 160 mg + 3 x 80 mg) or placebo. Starting at the day after cardioversion, the patient is asked to record and transmit electrocardiograms of one minute duration at least once a day using his personal transtelephonic ECG recording unit (Tele-ECG recorder, credit card size), in case of symptoms as often as necessary. The ECGs can be transmitted at any time by any regular phone without additional equipment using a toll free number. A custom made, computer based, fully automated receiving centre is handling the patient calls interactively with voice control, including a voice recording of the patient's symptoms. The ECG tracings and the patient's voice messages are subsequently computer based analysed by experienced technicians. All ECG measures are stored in a database. In case of AF recurrence, any other relevant arrhythmia or additional abnormalities (e.g. QT prolongation) the correspondent hospital is immediately informed by fax. In case of AF recurrence, a subsequent Holter recording discriminates in paroxysmal and permanent AF. Study medication is ended if either permanent AF or the third episode of paroxysmal AF are detected or after 12 months of follow-up. Regular follow-up visits are performed monthly. Major endpoints are the time to first recurrence of AF or the time to death, secondary parameters are the number of AF recurrences, the time to end of medication and AF related symptoms. The recruitment started in the last days of 1996. Until the end of June 1998, 424 patients have been randomised. It is expected to end recruitment in spring 1999 and to close the study in spring 2000. Final results will be available in summer 2000.", 
    "65": "The indication to treat symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is discussed controversely. Successful medical treatment may result in the reduction of symptoms by improving hemodynamics in a reduction of thromboembolic events. However, several antiarrhythmic drugs are also known to increase the risk of proarrhythmic events. A randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled multicenter trial with 1000 patients to be recruited was designed to compare the effects of two antiarrhythmic drugs frequently used in Germany for the treatment of atrial fibrillation, Sotalol and the fixed combination of chinidin and verapamil (Cordichin). Patients with symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter will be observed for a period of one year. The occurrence of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is documented by transtelephonic ECG monitoring. Patients with document an ECG once daily, and recording is mandatory in case of symptoms. ECGs are transmitted to a central data base for analysis. This clinical trial is designed to answer the following questions: (1) What is the average rate of spontaneous events of symptomatic atrial fibrillation? (2) Is it possible to reduce the frequency of symptomatic events by chronic antiarrhythmic drug administration? (3) What is the long-term frequency for the occurrence of severe side-effects under antiarrhythmic medication? The primary endpoint is defined as the time to first recurrence of symptomatic arrhythmia after reaching steady-state plasma concentrations of the study medication. The trial started in November 1997 and is planned to be finished by the end of 1999.", 
    "66": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a disease with different etiological, morphological, functional, clinical and therapeutic aspects. Recent investigations indicate that HCM is considerably widespread in the population (1:500). The causes seem to generate from familial or sporadic abnormalities (mutations). Depending on the clinical aspect, the complaints, and on the basis of morphologic and hemodynamic investigational results, we mainly have to consider two types of medical and surgical management. 1. Hypertrophic nonobstructive cardiomyopathy (HNCM) Patients may have no hemodynamic or morphologic deviations, but may be identified by familial moleculargenetic investigations. Others may have different types of rhythm disturbances which may indicate a higher risk of sudden death. Depending on the degree of hypertrophy, the clinical impairment indicates medical therapy with beta-blockers, Ca antagonists, and antiarrhythmic drugs. In the case of clinical deterioration and manifestation of myocardial insufficiency diuretics, digitalis, ACE inhibitors, and catecholamines are indicated. Further impairment may lead to heart transplantation or as a bridging procedure to implantation of a left ventricular or biventricular assist device until a suitable donor heart is available. 2. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) Symptomatic patients may have different localizations of the left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) in the subaortic area (typical form) and in midventricular position of the LV (atypical form). The first therapeutic step is always medical therapy with beta-blockers, Ca antagonists, and antiarrhythmic drugs. Further deterioration toward clinical class III (NYHA) despite long-term medication until recently was generally accepted as indication for transaortic subvalvular myectomy (TSM). Today mostly two other techniques are preferred--if possible Double chamber pacing (DCP) (atrial triggered ventricular pacing), Transcoronary ablation of septal hypertrophy (TASH) (by selective injection of alcohol, 95%, into the first septal branch). Especially in younger patients, after syncope, life-threatening tachyarrhythmias, and after resuscitation, the implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator may be necessary. Comparative prospectively randomized studies between different therapeutic regimens for HOCM are not available. Retrospective analyses of patients after TSM show a considerable clinical improvement. The risk of sudden death is relatively low, but not excluded. Patients after TSM demonstrate advantages concerning the survival rate despite the more deteriorated condition against those after medical therapy only. According to the new interventional techniques, long-term results are not yet available, of course. However, the long-term results after TSM may serve as a comparative standard which have at least to be reached by DCP and/or TASH.", 
    "67": "Recent reports suggest that cardiac pacing incorporating a rate-drop response algorithm is associated with a reduction in the frequency of syncopal episodes in patients with apparent cardioinhibitory vasovagal syncope. The detection portion of the algorithm employs a programmable heart rate change-time duration \"window\" to both identify abrupt cardiac slowing suggestive of an imminent vasovagal event and trigger \"high rate\" pacing. The purpose of this study was to develop recommendations for programming the rate-drop response algorithm. Pacemaker programming, symptom status, and drug therapy were assessed retrospectively in 24 patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope of sufficient severity to warrant consideration of pacemaker treatment. In the 53 +/- 19 months prior to pacing, patients had experienced an approximate syncope burden of 1.2 events/month. During follow-up of 192 +/- 160 days, syncope recurred in 4 patients (approximate syncope burden, 0.3 events/month, p < 0.05 vs. pre-pacing), and pre-syncope in 5 patients. In these patients, rate-drop response parameters were initially set based on electrocardiographic and/or tilt-table recordings, and were re-programmed at least once in 14 (58%) individuals. A 20 beat/min window height (top rate minus bottom rate), a window width of 10 beats (61% of patients), and 2 or 3 confirmation beats (79% of patients) appeared to be appropriate in most patients. Treatment intervention rate was set to > 100 beats/min in 89% of patients, with a duration of 1 to 2 min in 79%. In conclusion, a narrow range of rate-drop response parameter settings appeared to be effective for most individuals in this group of highly symptomatic patients.",

    "69": "Thermal analysis of propranolol/oleic acid mixtures prepared by solvent evaporation enabled construction of the binary system phase diagram. This allowed both physical and chemical interactions to be identified, including complex formation at the equimolar composition. An incongruent melting complex with a characteristic reaction point was identified in excess oleic acid compositions, a common property of fatty acid/fatty acid salt binary systems. The equimolar complex was confirmed to be propranolol oleate using infrared spectroscopy. Wide-angle X-ray powder diffractometry demonstrated that propranolol oleate possessed long-range positional order ( approximately 25 A d spacing) accompanied by a degree of disorder over shorter d spacings. Such a pattern suggested mesophase formation, explaining the unctuous nature of propranolol oleate at room temperature. Accurate measurement of the long-range d spacing was achieved using small-angle X-ray scattering, permitting differentiation of the three different phases identified (phase I: 25.4 A, phase II: 24.6 A, phase III: 25.4-25.5 A). The implications of drug fatty acid salt formation and also mesomorphism in pharmaceutical systems are discussed.", 
    "70": "When the hematopoietic growth factor granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor was incubated with neutrophils adherent to plastic tissue culture plates or plates coated with extracellular matrix proteins, a rapid (3 min) but transient formation of phosphatidic acid was observed. This stimulation was dependent on the dose of GM-CSF, with an EC50 of 140 pM, and was further enhanced (up to 350%) with the PA phosphatase inhibitor propranolol in a dose-dependent manner. Conversely, GM-CSF was unable to trigger any PA formation in neutrophils maintained in suspension, even in the presence of soluble fibronectin. However, GM-CSF did prime the cells for enhanced PA formation in the presence of a secondary stimulus (fMet-Leu-Phe or PAF). GM-CSF also caused a time-dependent stimulation of diacylglycerol formation in adherent, but not suspended, cells and elicited a time-dependent stimulation of phosphatidylethanol formation, with a concomitant decrease in the formation of PA only at early (< 7 min) times. These observations were consistent with a rapid activation of the enzyme phospholipase D in adherent cells stimulated with GM-CSF. Additional data indicated that the source of DAG was PLD coexisting with PLC, especially at later times ( > 7 min) of stimulation with GM-CSF. Finally, the formation of PA and PEt, and to a minor extent, DAG, were inhibited by the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor erbstatin in conditions in which tyrosine phosphorylation occurred. Taken together the data indicate that GM-CSF rapidly activates PLD in adherent cells, which is responsible for the generation of PA. Thus, PLD activation is an early event in neutrophil signal transduction following exposure of adherent cells to GM-CSF.", 
    "71": "An acute treatment of mice with clenbuterol, a beta-adrenergic agonist, produced a marked increase of polyamines levels in heart, particularly during the early phase of administration of the drug. A single dose of 1.5 mg/kg caused as much as a 10 fold induction in activity of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and 3 to 4 fold increase in levels of putrescine, spermidine and spermine in mouse heart. Maximum changes were observed 3 to 4 hours post-administration of clenbuterol. This treatment did not produce any change in S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase activity. The induction of cardiac ODC by clenbuterol was also dose dependent with a peak at about 5 micromol/kg. Co-administration of difluoromethylornithine, an irreversible inhibitor of ODC, or propranolol, a nonspecific beta-antagonist, with clenbuterol completely prevented the induction of ODC activity as well as the increase in polyamine levels in heart. However, pretreatment with alprenolol or metoprolol, the specific beta1 and beta2-antagonists, respectively, produced only partial prevention. The cardiac ODC from controls as well as clenbuterol treated mice exhibited similar affinity (Km) for its substrate, ornithine, while maximum enzyme activity (Vmax) was about 14 fold higher in clenbuterol treated mouse heart than in the control. Clenbuterol produced no change in the level of specific ODC mRNA or the protein, but the enzyme from the drug-treated mouse heart was considerably more stable than the control. Pretreatment of mice with either cycloheximide or actinomycin D followed by administration of clenbuterol could not prevent the induction in ODC activity suggesting that de novo biosynthesis of the enzyme protein or ODC mRNA was not responsible for induction of ODC activity. Post-translational changes in ODC may be responsible for an early increase of ODC activity due to clenbuterol treatment.", 
    "72": "The selectivity of Ca2+ over Na+ is approximately 3.3-fold larger in cGMP-gated channels of cone photoreceptors than in those of rods when measured under saturating cGMP concentrations, where the probability of channel opening is 85-90%. Under physiological conditions, however, the probability of opening of the cGMP-gated channels ranges from its largest value in darkness of 1-5% to essentially zero under continuous, bright illumination. We investigated the ion selectivity of cGMP-gated channels as a function of cyclic nucleotide concentration in membrane patches detached from the outer segments of rod and cone photoreceptors and have found that ion selectivity is linked to gating. We determined ion selectivity relative to Na+ (PX/PNa) from the value of reversal potentials measured under ion concentration gradients. The selectivity for Ca2+ over Na+ increases continuously as the probability of channel opening rises. The dependence of PCa/PNa on cGMP concentration, in both rods and cones, is well described by the same Hill function that describes the cGMP dependence of current amplitude. At the cytoplasmic cGMP concentrations expected in dark-adapted intact photoreceptors, PCa/PNa in cone channels is approximately 7.4-fold greater than that in rods. The linkage between selectivity and gating is specific for divalent cations. The selectivity of Ca2+ and Sr2+ changes with cGMP concentration, but the selectivity of inorganic monovalent cations, Cs+ and NH4+, and organic cations, methylammonium+ and dimethylammonium+, is invariant with cGMP. Cyclic nucleotide-gated channels in rod photoreceptors are heteromeric assemblies of alpha and beta subunits. The maximal PCa/PNa of channels formed from alpha subunits of bovine rod channels is less than that of heteromeric channels formed from alpha and beta subunits. In addition, Ca2+ is a more effective blocker of channels formed by alpha subunits than of channels formed by alpha and beta subunits. The cGMP-dependent shift in divalent cation selectivity is a property of alphabeta channels and not of channels formed from alpha subunits alone.", 
    "73": "The Cooperative Cardiovascular Project (CCP) is a nationwide quality improvement project (quality indicator measurement, feedback, remeasurement) in Medicare acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients sponsored by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA). In Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont, 3,472 baseline records were abstracted from 76 hospitals from January 1994 to February 1995. After feedback, 2,270 remeasurements were collected from October 1996 to May 1997. At remeasurement, performance improved significantly for \"ideal\" candidates (defined by the CCP) on five quality indicators--aspirin during hospitalization 88% to 93% (p < .001), thrombolytic timing 60% to 69% (p < .01), discharge aspirin 83% to 90% (p < .001), discharge beta-blockers 69% to 82% (p < .01), and calcium channel blocker avoidance 83% to 93% (p < .05). Reperfusion, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and smoking cessation advice did not improve significantly. This study demonstrates that evidence-based indicators, nationally designed data collection, and locally based interventions can significantly improve AMI care.", 
    "74": "As phospholipase D (PLD) activation has been associated with mitogenic signalling in several cell types, we tested an association between adrenergic activation of PLD and cellular proliferation in primary cultures of rat cortical astrocytes. In 2-week old cultures, PLD activation by noradrenaline (EC50: 0.49 microM) was inhibited by prazosin, a specific antagonist at alpha1-adrenergic receptors (IC50: 0.23 microM). Adrenergic PLD activation was not affected by genistein, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinases, or by Ro 31-8220, an inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC), but was dose-dependently depressed in the presence of brefeldin A (1-100 microg/ml), an inhibitor of ARF activation. In experiments measuring cell proliferation, noradrenaline potently (EC50: 20 nM) reduced [3H]thymidine incorporation to 20-30% of basal values. This action was mimicked by the beta-specific agonist isoprenaline and was inhibited by the beta-antagonist propranolol in a concentration-dependent manner. The alpha1-adrenergic agonists, phenylephrine and methoxamine, also reduced DNA synthesis. The adrenergic inhibition of astroglial DNA synthesis was not reduced, but further potentiated in the presence of brefeldin A, ethanol, and 1- and 2-butanol; 1-butanol, a substrate of PLD, was equally effective as 2-butanol, a non-substrate. We conclude that adrenergic PLD activation in astrocytes is not involved in mitogenic signalling. The involvement of ARF in the activation of PLD via alpha1-adrenoceptors indicates a role in protein trafficking.",

    "86": "The interaction of recently characterized cardiodepressant mediators with catecholamines and adenosine after myocardial ischaemia was investigated using a model of sequential perfusion of two isolated guinea-pig hearts. Sequential perfusion was initiated after 10, 20, and 30 min (group I, II, and III) of global ischaemia in the first heart. At the onset of sequential perfusion LVdP/dtmax and min of Heart II decreased by 46 and 44% in group I, by 28 and 34% in group II, and increased by 60 and 24% in group III. Infusion of the beta1-receptor antagonist metoprolol (2.8 micromol L(-1)) into Heart II did not modulate contractile changes after 10 min of ischaemia in Heart I, prevented the attenuation of the cardiodepressant effect after 20 min of ischaemia, and completely reversed the positive inotropic effect after 30 min of ischaemia. The A1- and A2-receptor antagonists DPCPX (2 micromol L(-1)) and DMPX (20 micromol L(-1)) enhanced the positive inotropic and lusitropic effects in Heart II (LVdP/dtmax +154%, LVdP/dtmin +71%) during sequential perfusion after 30 min of ischaemia in Heart I. It is concluded that the effects of cardiodepressant mediators released after myocardial ischaemia are counteracted by a time-dependent release of catecholamines. Endogenous cardiac adenosine, in turn, attenuates the modulatory effects of catecholamines.",

    "91": "Intracellular recording techniques were used to evaluate the effects of norepinephrine (NE) on the membrane properties of superficial layer (stratum griseum superficiale and stratum opticum) superior colliculus (SC) cells. Of the 207 cells tested, 44.4% (N = 92) were hyperpolarized by > or = 3 mV and 8.7% (N = 18) were depolarized by > or = 3 mV by application of NE. Hyperpolarization induced by NE was dose dependent (EC50 = 8.1 microM) and was associated with decreased input resistance and outward current which had a reversal potential of -94.0 mV. Depolarization was associated with a very slight rise in input resistance and had a reversal potential of -93.1 mV for the single cell tested. Pharmacologic experiments demonstrated that isoproterenol, dobutamine, and p-aminoclonidine all hyperpolarized SC cells. These results are consistent with the conclusion that NE-induced hyperpolarization of SC cells is mediated by both alpha2 and beta1 adrenoceptors. The alpha1 adrenoceptor agonists, methoxamine and phenylephrine, depolarized 35% (6 of 17) of the SC cells tested by > or = 3 mV. Most of the SC cells tested exhibited responses indicative of expression of more than one adrenoceptor. Application of p-aminoclonidine or dobutamine inhibited transsynaptic responses in SC cells evoked by electrical stimulation of optic tract axons. Inhibition of evoked responses by these agents was usually, but not invariably, associated with a hyperpolarization of the cell membrane and a reduction in depolarizing potentials evoked by application of glutamate. The present in vitro results are consistent with those of the companion in vivo study which suggested that NE-induced response suppression in superficial layer SC neurons was primarily postsynaptic and chiefly mediated by both beta2 and beta1 adrenoceptors.", 
    "92": "The expression and activity of factors influencing early neuronal development are altered by ethanol. Such factors include growth factors, for example, platelet-derived growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor (for cell proliferation), and cell adhesion molecules (for neuronal migration). One agent, transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1), may affect both events. We tested the hypothesis that ethanol alters myriad TGFbeta1-mediated activities [i.e., cell proliferation and neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) expression] using B104 neuroblastoma cells. TGFbeta1 inhibited the proliferation of B104 cells as evidenced by decreases in cell number and [3H]thymidine ([3H]dT) incorporation. TGFbeta1 induced sustained activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), which are part of the family of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Treatment with PD98059 (a MAPK kinase blocker) abolished TGFbeta1-regulated inhibition of [3H]dT incorporation. TGFbeta1-mediated growth inhibition was potentiated by ethanol exposure. Ethanol also produced prolonged activation of ERK, an effect that was partially eliminated by treatment with PD98059. On the other hand, TGFbeta1 up-regulated N-CAM expression, and this up-regulation was not affected by treatment with PD98059. Ethanol inhibited the TGFbeta1-induced up-regulation of N-CAM expression in a concentration-dependent manner. Thus, TGFbeta1 affects ERK-dependent cell proliferation and ERK-independent N-CAM expression in B104 cells. Both activities are sensitive to ethanol and may underlie the ethanol-induced alterations in the proliferation and migration of CNS neurons.",

Low temperature, concanavalin A, H89 and ICl 118,551 blocked the decline in 125I-ICYP binding during the first hour following exposure probably representing receptor sequestration to a compartment or change to a form incapable of ligand binding. Compared to controls, receptor binding 4 and 24 hours following exposure was reduced 56 +/- 8.7% and 72 +/- 8.8%, respectively (p < 0.05), and was blocked by ICl 118,551 but not CGP12177. Isoproterenol-induced, but not forskolin-stimulated, cAMP accumulation was reduced 35% 24 hours following exposure (p < 0.05). 125I-ICYP binding in intact L6 cells 4 and 24 hours after exposure were respectively 56 +/- 8.9 and 61 +/- 13% of controls (p < 0.05). Following agonist exposure, CHO cell membranes expressing human beta 2ARs exhibited 125I-ICYP binding 85 +/- 2.0% and 6 +/- 2.8% of control values 4 and 24 hours, respectively (p < 0.05). A model predicting that full occupation of the beta 2AR activates receptor degradation explains our results that agonist-induced down-regulation of beta 2AR does not require continuous presence of the agonist.",

Improvement in hemodynamic parameters was initially documented in three methodologically sound studies involving 156 patients. Follow up was limited to 16 weeks. A placebo-controlled, double-blind trial involving 1094 patients showed beneficial effects on overall mortality of 4.6% in absolute terms after a median follow up of 6.5 months. This benefit was not found in another trial involving 415 patients followed on average for 19 months. Results for symptom-based criteria conflict. When treatment is introduced very gradually, adverse effects (malaise) seem to be minor and infrequent. Carvedilol's place in the treatment of heart failure is not yet precisely documented.", 
    "97": "The inherited long QT syndrome is caused by mutations of at least 5 ion channel genes. Mutations of the cardiac sodium ion channel gene and 3 potassium channel genes have been identified to this time. A genetic locus on chromosome 4 has been identified, but no gene has been discovered as of yet. More than 120 mutations of the genes have been discovered. The majority of cases are inherited by autosomal dominant transmission. Syncope occurs in approximately two-thirds of gene carriers, with sudden death in 10% to 15% of untreated patients. The primary electrophysiologic disturbance is delayed recovery of the action potential, because of diverse physiologic perturbations dependent upon the specific ion channel and mutation. The delayed recovery predisposes individuals to the development of early afterdepolarizations and initiation of torsade de pointes arrhythmias. The torsade produces the syncope and sudden death. Patients with self-terminating torsade have syncope, whereas those whose torsade degenerates to ventricular fibrillation experience sudden death. The torsade maintenance appears to be because of complex reentry or repetitive triggered beats, both of which have been proposed as capable of explaining the unique and characteristic QRS morphology of torsade. It is proposed that the degree of dispersion of recovery at the time of torsade determines whether the torsade degenerates to ventricular fibrillation or self-terminates. The signs of long QT syndrome are prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram and abnormalities of T wave morphology. QTc values average 0.49 seconds and vary somewhat by genotype. Approximately 12% of long QT gene carriers have a normal QTc, < or =0. 44 seconds. Thus, a normal QTc interval does not exclude long QT syndrome. T wave morphology is relatively characteristic for each genotype. Diagnosis is likely with a QTc > or =0.48 seconds in females and > or =0.47 seconds in males. Values between 0.41 and 0.46 seconds require additional evaluation, as the disorder can neither be excluded nor made with those QTc intervals. Diagnosis is enhanced by identification of T wave abnormalities consistent with long QT syndrome. The principal treatment is beta-blocker therapy. Appropriate dosing, with ascertainment of efficacy and compliance with administration, are the key elements in therapeutic success. Molecular physiology-based strategies are being considered, including the use of sodium channel blockers in LQT3 and potassium administration in LQT1 patients.", 
    "98": "There is a sexual dimorphism in blood pressure: men tend to have higher blood pressures than women with functional ovaries, whereas ovariectomy or menopause tends to abolish the sexual dimorphism and cause women to develop a \"male\" pattern of blood pressure. Synthetic estrogens and progestins, found in oral contraceptives, tend to elevate blood pressure, whereas naturally occurring estrogens, used in postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy, lower it or have no effect. Women are more likely than men to be aware of their hypertension, to be treated with antihypertensive drugs, and to have their blood pressure controlled. Antihypertensive therapy induces similar blood pressure reductions in men and women. However, men experience larger reductions in total cardiovascular risk with successful treatment of high blood pressure, because their absolute risk of coronary events at baseline is so much higher. Special considerations that can dictate antihypertensive treatment choices for women include increased vulnerability to the adverse effects of some drugs, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced cough, calcium channel blocker-induced edema, and minoxidil-induced hirsutism. Beta-adrenergic blockers tend to be less effective in women than in men, and diuretics are particularly useful in women because they protect against hip fracture. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers are contraindicated during pregnancy or if pregnancy is planned because of the risk of fetal developmental abnormalities.",

The LiChrospher ADS RP-18 precolumn has been found to be more suitable for the sample clean-up. Serum samples were directly injected into the chromatographic system. Proteins and other endogenous compounds were removed by washing with 10% 2-propanol in water and the analytes separated on the Gromsil ODS AB analytical column. The chromatograms were detected at 246 nm. The method validation confirms the suitability of the column-switching system for the quantitation of propafenone and its metabolite. The presented assay shows good linearity with high correlation coefficients (0.992-0.999), high recoveries (96.6+/-6.1-103.5+/-5.8) and excellent values of the repeatabilities (1.23-4.5%). The limits of quantitation are 25-40 ng/ml for the injection volume of 50 microl.

The diphasic dialysis technique is a semi-permeable membrane technology developed for the direct extraction of relatively low-molecular-mass analytes such as clenbuterol. In this case, we used sodium citrate buffer to homogenize the digested hair, dichloromethane was used as the extraction solvent at 37 degrees C, and stirring was applied at 150 rpm for 4 h. The analysis was carried out using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The calibration curve for clenbuterol in hair was linear in the range from 12.5 to 400 ng g(-1). The detection limit of clenbuterol was 5 ng g(-1) and the quantification limit was 12.5 ng g(-1), in hair. A good inter-day reproducibility was obtained (R.S.D. = 7.08%).

The procedure makes use of C18 columns and micellar mobile phases of sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), propanol, and phosphate buffer at pH 3. The adequate resolution of most drugs is obtained with a chemometrics approach where the retention is modeled as a first step using the retention factors in only 5 mobile phases. Afterward, an optimization criterion that takes into account the position and shape of the chromatographic peaks is applied. A mobile phase of 0.11M SDS--8% propanol could resolve mixtures of 8 drugs and was adequate for the analysis of the combinations of diuretic and beta-blocker usually prescribed. However, a mobile phase of larger elution strength, such as 0.15M SDS--15% propanol, is preferred for the analysis of mixtures of amiloride-metoprolol, amiloride-labetalol, and triameterene-propranolol. The method is sensitive enough for the routine analysis of diuretics and beta-blockers at therapeutic urine levels with limits of detection in the 0.5-28-ng/mL range. Urinary excretion studies show that the detection of most drugs is possible up to 24-72 h after their ingestion.", 
    "107": "Pepsanurin is a peptidic fraction resulting from pepsin digestion of plasma globulins, that inhibits ANP renal excretory actions. We studied whether kinin-like peptides mediate the anti-ANP effect by testing if pepsanurin: 1) was blocked by the kinin B2 receptor antagonist HOE-140, 2) was produced from kininogen, and 3) was mimicked by bradykinin. Anti-ANP activity was assessed in anesthetized female rats by comparing the excretory response to two ANP boluses (0.5 microgram i.v.) given before and after i.p. injection of test samples. Pepsanurin from human or rat plasma (1-5 mL/kg), and bradykinin (5-20 micrograms/kg), dose-relatedly inhibited ANP-induced water, sodium, potassium and cyclic GMP urinary excretion, without affecting arterial blood pressure. The same effect was exerted by pepsin hydrolysates of purified kininogen, whereas hydrolysates of kininogen-free plasma had no effect. HOE-140 (5 micrograms, i.v.) did not alter baseline, or ANP-induced excretion, but blocked the anti-ANP effects of pepsanurin. Histamine (15 micrograms/kg) plus seroalbumin hydrolysates did not affect ANP response, despite inducing larger peritoneal fluid accumulation as compared with pepsanurin or bradykinin. We concluded that kinins cleaved from kininogen mediate the anti-ANP effects of pepsanurin by activation of kinin B2 receptors, independently of changes in systemic arterial pressure or peritoneal fluid sequestration.",

In this study we investigated glucocorticoid receptor gene expression in the rat hippocampus following acute stress. A significant decrease in glucocorticoid receptor mRNA levels was observed in the hippocampus less than 1 h after the onset of stress. This decrease was inhibited by administering either MK-801, diazepam or propranolol prior to exposure to stress. The effect of diazepam on the stress-induced decrease in hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor mRNA was reversed by Ro-15-1788, suggesting that it is mediated by central benzodiazepine receptors, i.e. GABA-A. These results indicate that NMDA, GABA-A and beta-adrenergic receptors are involved in the mechanism of the stress-induced decrease in glucocorticoid receptor mRNA levels in the rat hippocampus.", 
    "117": "We investigated the role of adrenergic receptors in histamine (HA)-induced release of corticotropin (ACTH) and prolactin (PRL) in conscious male rats. Specific alpha- or beta-receptor antagonists were administered intracerebroventricularly in doses of 1 mmol at time -20 min, and HA (270 nmol), the H1 receptor agonist 2-thiazolylethylamine (2-TEA; 2,180 nmol) or the H2 receptor agonist 4-methylHA (4-MeHA; 790 nmol) were administered intracerebroventricularly at -15 min. The animals were decapitated at 0 min, and plasma was analyzed for ACTH and PRL. Administration of HA and the histaminergic agonists stimulated ACTH secretion equally, while only HA and the H2 receptor agonist stimulated PRL secretion. Pretreatment with the adrenergic receptor antagonists had no effect on the ACTH response to the histaminergic compounds. In contrast, the PRL response to HA or 4-MeHA was inhibited or prevented by the alpha-receptor antagonists phenoxybenzamine and phentolamine, the alpha1-receptor antagonist prazocin, the beta-receptor antagonist propranolol and the beta1-receptor antagonist atenolol, whereas the alpha2-receptor antagonist yohimbine or the beta2-receptor antagonist ICI-118-551 had no effect. The study indicates that histaminergic neurons interact with the catecholaminergic neuronal system in regulation of PRL secretion, and that this interaction is dependent upon activation of alpha1- and beta1-receptors. In contrast, histaminergic neurons stimulate ACTH secretion independently of adrenergic receptor activation.", 
    "118": "The majority of the findings concerning arterial physiology and pathophysiology originate from studies with experimental animals, while only limited information exists about the functional characteristics of human arteries. Therefore, the aim of the present work was to compare the control of vascular tone in vitro in mesenteric arterial rings of corresponding size (outer diameter 0.75-1 mm) from humans and Wistar-Kyoto rats. The relaxations to acetylcholine (ACh) were clearly less marked in the mesenteric arteries of humans when compared with rats. However, when calcium ionophore A23187 was used as the vasodilator, the endothelium-mediated relaxations did not significantly differ between these species. The NO synthase inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) attenuated the relaxations to ACh and A23187 in both groups. The endothelium-independent relaxations to the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline and the nitric oxide (NO)-donor nitroprusside were somewhat lower in human arteries, while vasodilation induced by the K+ channel opener cromakalim was similar between humans and rats. Arterial contractile sensitivity to noradrenaline and serotonin was slightly lower in human vessels, whereas contractile sensitivity to KCl was similar between these species. The contractions induced by cumulative addition of Ca2+ with noradrenaline as the agonist were effectively inhibited in both groups by the calcium channel blocker nifedipine, the effect of which was clearly more pronounced in human arteries. In conclusion, the control of vascular tone of isolated arteries of corresponding size from humans and rats appeared to be rather similar. The most marked differences between these species were the impaired endothelium-mediated dilation to ACh and the more pronounced effect of nifedipine on the Ca2(+)-induced contractions in human arteries.", 
    "119": "Numerous synthetic agonists selectively stimulate beta3-adrenoceptors (ARs). The endogenous catecholamines, noradrenaline and adrenaline, however, stimulate all the beta-AR subtypes, and no selective physiological agonist for beta3-ARs has been described so far. The aim of this study was to investigate whether any naturally occurring amine can stimulate selectively beta3-ARs. Since activation of lipolysis is a well-known beta-adrenergic function, the efficacy and potency of various biogenic amines were compared with those of noradrenaline, isoprenaline, and beta3-AR agonists 4-(-{[2-hydroxy-(3-chlorophenyl)ethyl]-amino} propyl)phenoxyacetate (BRL 37,344) and (R,R)-5-(2-{[2-(3-chlorophenyl )-2-hydroxyethyl]-amino} propyl)-1,3-benzo-dioxole-2,2-dicarboxylate (CL 316,243) by testing their lipolytic action in white fat cells. Five mammalian species were studied: rat, hamster and dog, in which selective beta-AR agonists act as full lipolytic agents, and guinea-pigs and humans, in which beta3-AR agonists are less potent activators of lipolysis. Several biogenic amines were inefficient (e.g. dopamine, tyramine and beta-phenylethylamine) while others (synephrine, phenylethanolamine, epinine) were partially active in stimulating lipolysis in all species studied. Their actions were inhibited by all the beta-AR antagonists tested, including those selective for beta1- or beta2-ARs. Octopamine was the only amine fully stimulating lipolysis in rat, hamster and dog fat cells, while inefficient in guinea-pig or human fat cells, like the beta3-AR agonists. In rat white fat cells, beta-AR antagonists inhibited the lipolytic effect of octopamine with a relative order of potency very similar to that observed against CL 316,243. Competitive antagonism of octopamine effect resulted in the following apparent pA2 [-log(IC50), where IC50 is the antagonist concentration eliciting half-maximal inhibition] values: 7.77 (bupranolol), 6.48 [3-(2-ethyl-phenoxy)-1[(1 S)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphth-1-ylaminol]-(2S)2-propanol oxalate, SR 59230A, a beta3-selective antagonist], 6.30[erythro-D,L-1(7-lethylindan-4-yloxy)-3-isopropylamino-+ ++butan-2-ol, ICI 118,551, a beta2-selective antagonist] and 4.71 [(+/-)-[2-(3-carbomyl-4-hydroxyphenoxy)-ethylamino]-3-[4-(1- methyl-4-trifluoromethyl-2-imidazolyl)-phenoxy]2-propanolmethane sulphonate, CGP 20712A, a beta1-selective antagonist]. Octopamine had other properties in common with beta3-AR agonists: stimulation of oxygen consumption in rat brown fat cells and very low affinity in displacing [3H]CGP 12,177 binding to [beta1- or beta2-ARs in dog and rat adipocyte membranes. In Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing human beta3-ARs, octopamine inhibited [125I]ICYP binding with only twofold less affinity than noradrenaline while it exhibited an affinity around 200-fold lower than noradrenaline in CHO cells expressing human beta1- or beta2-ARs. These data suggest that, among the biogenic amines metabolically related to catecholamines, octopamine can be considered as the most selective for beta3-ARs.", 
    "120": "Exercise induces a selective redistribution of CD62L(-) T lymphocytes. This study examined the effects of beta adrenergic receptor blockade on this phenomenon. Twelve healthy men were exercised to exhaustion on a treadmill prior to and following 1 week of treatment with the nonselective beta antagonist propranolol or the beta1 selective antagonist metoprolol. Dynamic exercise resulted in a significant lymphocytosis (p < 0.001). CD8(+)CD62L(-) T cells showed a greater than 3-fold increase in response to exercise (p < 0.001) as compared to CD8(+)CD62L(+) T cells, which showed a more modest increase. Treatment with the nonselective beta antagonist propranolol significantly attenuated the preferential increase of circulating CD8(+)CD62L(-) lymphocytes (p = 0.01) but had no effect on CD8(+)CD62L(+) T cells. Treatment with the beta1 selective antagonist metoprolol did not affect the response of either subset. Our findings replicate a prior study indicating that CD62L expression influences T lymphocyte trafficking in response to exercise and extends those findings by showing that this phenomenon is mediated, in part, via the beta2-adrenergic receptor.", 
    "121": "Nisoldipine coat-core (nisoldipine CC), an extended-release once-daily formulation, is an effective treatment for mild-to-moderate hypertension, providing sustained blood pressure control over the 24-hour dosing interval. Nisoldipine CC is highly vascular selective. It causes neither reflex tachycardia nor symptomatic bradycardia; it lacks significant negative inotropy at therapeutic doses; and it does not affect circadian variation in blood pressure or heart rate. Data suggest that the lack of reflex sympathetic activation in response to the blood pressure-lowering effect of nisoldipine CC is due to the smooth onset of action of nisoldipine CC, causing resetting of the baroflex. The neutral heart rate profile of nisoldipine CC confers potential therapeutic advantages over several other calcium channel blockers, in particular, the short-acting agents, in the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "122": "The clinical benefits of beta-blockers in heart failure are currently subject to intense debate and are being investigated. The economic impact of beta-blockade, however, has largely remained unexplored. The Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study (CIBIS), while failing to show statistically significant reduction in mortality over conventional therapy, demonstrates that the administration of bisoprolol adjuvant to standard therapy leads to a significant reduction in hospital admission. The present study is a cost minimisation analysis based on CIBIS data for the UK and is restricted to direct costs only. The costs of bisoprolol medication and inpatient treatment of heart failure are considered. The 'base case' analysis and the sensitivity analyses carried on all cost driver parameters show that administering bisoprolol to heart failure patients adjuvantly to the standard therapy is at least cost neutral. Additional drug costs incurred by bisoprolol are compensated by the inpatient treatment costs of heart failure avoided. All other non-quantifiable clinical benefits such as improvement of New York Heart Association functional class are positive extras to patients and the National Health Service.",

    "124": "Fifty seven nulliparous patients admitted in active labor were randomly divided into two groups: a control group consisting of 23 patients, and a treatment group consisting of 34 patients given 2 mg of propranolol intravenously every 4 hours until delivery. Total length of labor, time from first administration of medication to delivery, incidence of cesarean section, APGAR scores, maternal and fetal morbidity were assessed.", 
    "125": "A total of 4 cesarean sections were performed in each group (11.7% in the treatment group and 17.3% in the control group). The rate of cesarean section due to dystocia was 6.25 and 13.6% respectively (P = .367). Statistical significance was not reached due to the small number of subjects (students t test analysis). There was no increase in the incidence of low APGAR scores, intensive care unit admissions, abnormal heart rate patterns during labor, cesarean sections for fetal distress or maternal morbidity in the treated group.", 
    "126": "Intravenous administration of 2 mg of propranolol every four hours is safe and not associated to increased neonatal or maternal morbidity. A 50% decrease in the incidence of cesarean sections can be documented among nulliparous patients treated with propranolol although the small numbers and overall low incidence of cesarean section in our population (14%) did not permit these differences to reach statistical significance.", 
    "127": "The efficacy of sustained-release osmotic tablets of nifedipine in the symptomatic treatment of stable angina is poorly documented. The safety of nifedipine remains uncertain, as high-dose treatment with immediate-release preparations increased mortality in trials involving coronary patients. In angina, nifedipine can be used only in combination with a betablocker, and only to treat patients with no recent history of myocardial infarction, or unstable angina. In stable angina with inadequate symptom control by betablockers, it is no more effective than other dihydropyridines also indicated in the treatment of angina, i.e. amlodipine and felodipine. Furthermore, medium-term data on amlodipine are relatively reassuring. Nifedipine appears a little more effective than sustained-release nitrate derivatives, but less safe.", 
    "128": "Effects of propranolol on the pharmacokinetics of cyclosporine were investigated after intravenous and oral administration of the drugs to control rats and rats with uranyl nitrate-induced acute renal failure (U-ARF). Effects of intravenous propranolol, 3 mg/kg, on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous cyclosporine, 3 and 30 mg/kg, to control rats, and 30 mg/kg, to rats with U-ARF seemed to be negligible. However, the effects of orally administered propranolol, 10 mg/kg, on the area under the blood concentration-time curve (AUC) of oral cyclosporine were significant after oral administration of cyclosporine, 10 and 100 mg/kg, to control rats. For example, the AUC of cyclosporine increased significantly (33.1 versus 24.7 microg h/ml) at cyclosporine oral dose of 10 mg/kg, however, the value decreased significantly (167 versus 235 microg h/ml) at cyclosporine oral dose of 100 mg/kg. Effects of orally administered propranolol, 10 mg/kg, on the pharmacokinetics of orally administered cyclosporine, 100 mg/kg, seemed to be negligible in rats with U-ARF.", 
    "129": "Although beta-adrenergic-blocking drugs suppress the renin system (RAAS), plasma angiotensin II (Ang II) responses during beta-blockade have not been defined. This study quantifies the effects of beta-blockade on the RAAS and examines its impact on prorenin processing by measuring changes in the ratio of plasma renin activity (PRA) to total renin. In normotensive (N = 14) and hypertensive (N = 16) subjects, blood pressure (BP), heart rate, PRA, plasma prorenin, plasma total renin (prorenin + PRA), ratio of PRA to total renin (%PRA), plasma Ang II, and urinary aldosterone were measured before and after 1 week of beta-blockade. Plasma renin activity, Ang II, and urinary aldosterone levels were similar for normotensive and hypertensive subjects. Plasma renin activity correlated with Ang II. Total renin, which is proportional to (pro)renin gene expression, was lower in hypertensive subjects and was inversely related to BP. Beta-blockade decreased BP and heart rate in both groups, with medium- and high-renin hypertensive subjects responding more frequently than those with low renin. Beta-blockade consistently suppressed PRA, Ang II, and aldosterone. Total renin was unchanged, thus, %PRA fell. These results indicate that beta-blockers suppress plasma angiotensin II levels, in parallel with the marked reductions in PRA and urinary aldosterone levels in normotensive and hypertensive subjects. The suppression of Ang II levels was comparable to that produced during angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. However, by reducing prorenin processing to renin, beta-blockers do not stimulate renin secretion, unlike ACE inhibitors and Ang II receptor antagonists. This unique action of beta-blockers has important implications for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.", 
    "130": "We have previously shown that interleukin-1 beta relaxes vascular smooth muscle by the NO-dependent and independent mechanisms (Takizawa et al.: Eur. J. Pharmacol. 330: 143-150, 1997). In this study, we investigated the mechanism of NO-independent relaxation. Treatment of the rat aorta with interleukin-1 beta for 24 hr inhibited the high-K+ induced contraction by decreasing cytosolic Ca2+ level ([Ca2+]i). The relationship between [Ca2+]i and tension in intact muscle and the pCa-tension curves in permeabilized muscle suggested that Ca2+ sensitivity of contractile element was not changed after the interleukin-1 beta-treatment. After a treatment with interleukin-1 beta for 24 hr, contractile effects of phenylephrine (1 microM-10 microM) were markedly inhibited in the presence of L-NMMA (100 microM) applied to inhibit NO synthesis. A blocker of ATP-sensitive K+ channel, glibenclamide (1 microM), partially recovered the interleukin-1 beta-induced inhibition. In contrast, a blocker of Ca(2+)-activated K+ channel, charybdotoxin (0.1 microM), was ineffective. These results suggest that membrane hyperpolarization due to activation of ATP-sensitive K+ channels may partly be responsible for the NO-independent mechanism of interleukin-1 beta-induced inhibition of vascular smooth muscle contraction.", 
    "131": "Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is defined as an atrial fibrillation that terminates spontaneously. It is desirable that atrial fibrillation should be terminated immediately after onset, and should be prevented from re-initiation to avoid atrial electrical remodeling or atrial stunning after cardioversion. Antiarrhythmic agents are used for these reasons. The important factors for pharmacological cardioversion of atrial fibrillation are thought to be prolongation of atrial refractory and suppression of conduction time in the atrium. Therefore, class Ia and Ic antiarrhythmic drugs, including bepridil as class IV because of its characteristics of class Ia, are administered to restore sinus rhythm. Verapamil and diltiazem, or beta adrenergic blocker, or digitalis decreases the ventricular response during atrial fibrillation for disturbance of atrioventricular nodal conduction, and then cardioversion of atrial fibrillation may occur. Suppression of supraventricular extrasystoles and atrial conduction time, or prolongation of atrial refractoriness will be needed to maintain sinus rhythm. Class I, III, or bepridil as class IV excepting lidocaine and mexiletine are used to prevent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. In general, sodium channel blocker is superior for defibrillation and potassium channel blocker is superior for prophylaxis of atrial fibrillation. Considering efficacy, antiarrhythmic agents should be selected depending on the following factors: cardiac function, renal or hepatic function, underlying heart disease, exercise-induced or enhanced mental condition, cholinergic induced, drug-resistant atrial fibrillation or not.", 
    "132": "The sudden conversion of a stable atherosclerotic plaque to an unstable and life-threatening atherothrombotic lesion which is known as plaque rupture is the potential mechanism for the development of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Accordingly, secondary prevention of ACS could be achieved with the prevention of the plaque rupture and thrombus formation. Coronary angioplasty and coronary bypass surgery have a limited value in the long-term prevention of ACS. Coronary risk factor modification is certainly the important strategy for secondary prevention. The drug treatment with lipid lowering agents, especially 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, beta-adrenergic receptor blockers, antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants, have been proven to be effective for the secondary prevention of myocardial infarction. Estrogen for postmenopausal women has also been reported to be beneficial. However, calcium channel blockers except verapamil, nitrates and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are not recommended for the secondary prevention of ACS.", 
    "133": "Acute coronary syndromes result from fissure, erosion or rupture of a vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque. The characteristics of a vulnerable plaque include a large lipid pool, an abundance of inflammatory cells and mediators, a reduced smooth muscle cell and collagen content and a thin overlying fibrous cap. Potential therapeutic strategies at achieving plaque stabilization have targeted these features. Lipid lowering agents, beta-adrenergic blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and antioxidants have been shown to reduce the incidence of acute coronary syndromes, presumably through plaque stabilization. Matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors as well as macrolide antibiotics and gene therapy approaches show promise in achieving plaque stabilization. The evidence supporting plaque stabilization by these agents and the mechanisms by which these agents stabilize plaques are discussed in detail in this review.", 
    "134": "Atherosclerotic plaque rupture and resulting intracoronary thrombosis are thought to account for most acute coronary syndromes. These syndromes include unstable angina, non-Q-wave myocardial infarction (MI) and Q-wave MI. In addition, many cases of sudden cardiac death may be attributable to atherosclerotic plaque disruption and its immediate complications. Our understanding of the atherosclerotic process and the pathophysiology of plaque disruption has advanced remarkably. Despite these advances, event rates after acute coronary syndromes remain unacceptably high. This review will focus on the pathophysiology underlying atherosclerotic plaque development, the sequellae of coronary plaque rupture, and current therapies designed to treat the acute coronary syndromes. It is hoped that as our understanding of the atherosclerotic plaque improves, treatment strategies for the acute coronary syndromes will advance.", 
    "135": "The Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) Study had two objectives: (1) to define the optimal target blood pressure when treating hypertensive patients (i.e. the level of blood pressure associated with the lowest incidence of major cardiovascular events such as fatal and non-fatal stroke and myocardial infarction and other cardiovascular mortality); and (2) to assess the effect of a low dose of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) compared with placebo on major cardiovascular events.", 
    "136": "The HOT study recruited 18 790 hypertensive subjects aged 50 to 80 years with diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between 100 and 115 mmHg (mean DBP 105 mmHg). Subjects were randomly assigned to be treated with the goal of reaching one of three target DBPs: < or = 90 mmHg (n = 6264), < or = 85 mmHg (n = 6264), or < or = 80 mmHg (n = 6262) using felodipine as initial therapy with the addition of other agents according to a 5-step regimen. In addition, subjects were randomly assigned to receive either 75 mg/day aspirin (n = 9399) or placebo (n = 9391).", 
    "137": "DBP was reduced by 20.3, 22.3, and 24.3 mmHg in the < or = 90, < or = 85, and < or = 80 mmHg target groups, respectively. The incidence of all major cardiovascular events (fatal and non-fatal stroke, myocardial infarction, and other cardiovascular mortality) decreased, although not significantly, in relation to the randomized target blood pressure. There were 84, 64, and 61 fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarctions in the < or = 90 mmHg, < or = 85 mmHg, and < or = 80 mmHg groups, respectively (P = 0.05). The overall effect of aspirin on cardiovascular events was positive, most noticeably on fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarctions; aspirin reduced events by 36%. There were seven fatal episodes of bleeding (two cerebral) in the aspirin group compared with eight (three cerebral) in the placebo group, and 129 versus 70 non-fatal major episodes of bleeding in the two groups, respectively. The lowest incidence of all major cardiovascular events combined was found at an achieved DBP of 82.6 mmHg and at an achieved systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 138.5 mmHg. In the subgroup with diabetes mellitus at baseline (n = 1501), the effect of intensive lowering of blood pressure was especially noticeable.", 
    "138": "Most cardiovascular end-points showed a declining frequency in relation to target blood pressure. The optimal protection against combined major cardiovascular end-points was observed in the range 80-85 mmHg for DBP and in the range 130-140 mmHg for SBP. It is worth noting that 92% of all subjects reached a DBP of < or = 90 mmHg and that side-effects gradually declined from 16.9% at 3 months to 2.2% at the end of the study. A substudy showed that quality of life was linked to the level of blood pressure obtained: the lower the blood pressure, the better the quality of life.", 
    "139": "The effect of isradepin, ramipril, ednyt, and beta-adrenoblockers on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and free-radical oxidation in patients with insulin-independent diabetes mellitus was studied. Isradepin caused an increase in high-density lipoproteins (HDLP) in the blood serum and the content of esterified cholesterol in HDLP, and reduced the arterogenicity coefficient. Rampiril reduced the basal level of glycemia and insulin. Treatment with ednyt lead to increase in the content of HDLP and the content of free cholesterol in them. In the course of treatment isradepin normalized chemoluminescence of the serum and urine, rampiril that of serum, and beta-adrenoblockers the chemoluminescence of the blood. The favorable changes induced by the drugs under study allow them to be recommended for the treatment of arterial hypertension in patients with insulin-independent diabetes mellitus.",

Increased HR by application of 0.04 mg/kg atropine (para-tone), and by 0.004 microgram/kg/min isoproterenol divided by 0.004 (beta-sens) were evaluated, beta-tone was obtained by subtracting HR after application of propranolol (0.2 mg/kg) from that of atropine. Basal beta-sympathetic activity was evaluated by beta-sec that was obtained by beta-tone/beta-sens. Increased SBP by application of 0.4 microgram/kg/min phenylephrine divided by 0.4 (alpha-sens) was evaluated. alpha-tone was obtained by subtracting minimum SBP after 0.2 mg/kg phentolamine from SBP after application of propranolol. Basal alpha-sympathetic activity was evaluated by alpha-sec, that was obtained by alpha-tone/alpha-sens.",

The parameters of the functions of parasympathetic and beta-sympathetic receptors (para-tone, beta-sens, beta-tone, beta-sec) showed no significant differences between the groups, alpha-sens was attenuated (P < 0.01) and alpha-sec was augmented (P < 0.0001) significantly in group S.",

    "146": "A 22 year old man was diagnosed as having Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (JLNS), which includes a prolonged QTc, congenital neural deafness, and syncopal attacks or sudden death. In spite of medication with beta blocker, syncopal attack increased in frequency since his sister suddenly had died of JLNS. Because left stellate ganglion block improved the QTc dispersion, left cardiac sympathectomy was scheduled under the video-assisted thoracic surgery. After the premedication with midazolam, anesthesia was induced with thiamylal, and maintained with nitrous oxide, sevoflurane, and fentanyl. Serious arrhythmias were not observed throughout the perioperative period. Sympathetic trunk was successfully resected from the top of 1st ganglion to the bottom of 4th ganglion of left thoracic sympathetic trunk. Horner's sign did not appear after the surgery. Although the shortening of QTc was not significant, QTc dispersion during exercise was improved, and syncopal attack was not observed until 6 months after the surgery.", 
    "147": "With beta-blocker use becoming more prevalent in treating chronic heart failure (CHF), the choice of drugs raises important theoretical and practical questions. Although the second-generation compound metoprolol is beta1-selective, the third-generation compound carvedilol is beta-nonselective, with ancillary pharmacological properties including alpha-blockade and antioxidant effects. A prospective comparison of these 2 agents can address the issue of optimal adrenergic blockade in selecting agents for therapy in CHF.", 
    "148": "Sixty-seven patients with symptomatic stable heart failure were randomly assigned to receive either carvedilol or metoprolol in addition to standard therapy for CHF. Measured variables included symptoms, exercise, ejection fraction, and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) as an indirect marker of free radical activity. Metoprolol and carvedilol were well tolerated, and both patient groups showed beneficial effects of beta-blocker therapy in each of the measured parameters, with no between-group differences. Ejection fraction increased over 6 months from 18+/-6.3% to 23+/-8.7% (P<0.005) with metoprolol and from 19+/-8.5% to 25+/-9.9% (P<0.0005) with carvedilol (P=NS between groups).

    "150": "Hemorrhagic shock is associated with lactic acidosis and increased plasma catecholamines. Skeletal muscle increases lactate production under aerobic conditions in response to epinephrine, and this effect is blocked by ouabain, a specific inhibitor of the cell membrane Na+/K+ pump. In this study, we tested whether adrenergic antagonists can block lactate production during shock.", 
    "151": "Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 g) were pretreated with phenoxybenzamine (2 mg/kg, i.v.) and/or propranolol (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) before hemorrhaging to a mean arterial pressure of 40 mm Hg for 1 hour. Skeletal muscle perfusion, plasma lactate, and catecholamines were measured at baseline, 55 minutes after shock, and 1 hour after resuscitation. In a separate study, extensor digitorum longus and soleus muscles were incubated in Krebs buffer (95:5, O2:CO2) with 10 mmol/L glucose. One of each muscle pair was incubated in the absence or presence of epinephrine and of one or both adrenergic blockers. Medium lactate concentration was then measured.", 
    "152": "The combination of alpha- and beta-blockers significantly reduced plasma lactate levels during hemorrhage. In contrast, beta-blockade alone was associated with a significant increase in plasma lactate and epinephrine. None of the blockers altered tissue perfusion. Epinephrine stimulation of muscle lactate production in vitro was completely blocked by propranolol.", 
    "153": "Epinephrine release in response to hypotension is a primary stimulus for muscle lactate production in this model of hemorrhagic shock. Hypoxia alone does not explain the increased lactate levels because tissue perfusion was not altered by the adrenergic antagonists. These observations challenge the rationale behind lactate clearance as an end point for resuscitation after hemorrhagic shock.", 
    "154": "To investigate whether a low heart rate is necessary to maintain improvement in myocardial function after long-term treatment with a beta-blocker in patients with heart failure.", 
    "155": "Forty-eight patients with congestive heart failure were investigated: 30 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy participating in a placebo-controlled trial (15 on placebo, 15 on metoprolol), and 18 patients treated by metoprolol in an open protocol. Investigations of spontaneous heart rate and of matched paced heart rates were performed at baseline and after 3, 6 and 12 months of follow-up by radionuclide angiography. There were significant signs of improvement in systolic indices of the spontaneous heart rate in the metoprolol-treated group (peak ejection rate: 0.98 to 1.32 end-diastolic volume.s-1, P = 0.015) as compared to placebo (1.14 to 1.19 end-diastolic volume.s-1, not significant). Similar effects were observed during the matched paced heart rate (peak ejection rate: metoprolol 0.91 to 1.38 end-diastolic volume.s-1, P = 0.037; placebo 1.22 to 1.12 end-diastolic volume.s-1, not significant). No effects were observed in the early peak filling rate. Left ventricular volumes decreased during metoprolol treatment, both for the spontaneous heart rate and during matched pacing.", 
    "156": "These data imply that beta-blocker treatment improves the force-frequency relationship of myocardial performance. A lower heart rate is not necessary to maintain cardiac function on a short-term basis, once myocardial recovery has occurred.", 
    "157": "The use of beta-blockers in heart failure for a long time was regarded as contra-indicated because of their negative inotropic effects. Nevertheless, there is growing evidence that beta-blockers slow down the progression of left ventricular dilatation that characterizes heart failure. In addition changes in left ventricular ejection fraction after several months of beta-blocker treatment appears to have predictive value for survival. This beneficial effect of beta-blockade in chronic heart failure needs to be assessed further. The presumed benefit of beta-blockade with betaxolol (CAS 63659-18-7), a highly selective beta-blocker with long duration of action in chronic heart failure (CHF) will be assessed in BETACAR, a comparative study versus carvedilol (CAS 72956-09-3). The design of this study is provided in this article.", 
    "158": "UK-1745, a derivative of furoindolinone, is a novel cardiotonic agent that was designed to have both beta-adrenoceptor-blocking and cardiotonic activity. The aim of this study was to clarify the mode of action of UK-1745 in the canine and rabbit myocardium. UK-1745 elicited a weak but definite concentration-dependent positive inotropic effect in association with a decrease in the total duration of contraction: in particular, a decrease in the relaxation time in isolated canine right ventricular trabeculae. The maximum positive inotropic effect of UK-1745 was achieved at 3x10(-5)m and amounted to approximately 15% of the maximum response to isoproterenol. The EC50 for the positive inotropic effect of UK-1745 was 3.3x10(-6)m. Carbachol, a muscarinic receptor agonist, at 3x10(-6)m completely inhibited the positive inotropic effect of UK-1745. UK-1745 shifted the concentration-response curve for isoproterenol to the right with pA2 value of 5.70. By contrast, UK-1745 at 3x10(-7)to 3x10(-5)m shifted the concentration-response curve for forskolin to the left. In aequorin-loaded ventricular trabeculae, UK-1745 induced a positive inotropic effect that was accompanied by an increase in Ca2+ transients. It did not affect the relationship between the amplitude of Ca2+ transients and peak force as compared with that associated with elevation of the extracellular concentration of Ca2+ ions ([Ca2+]o). The level of cyclic AMP in tissue was not significantly increased at 3x10(-5)m UK-1745. The present results indicate that UK-1745 exerts a positive inotropic effect mainly via a cyclic AMP-dependent mechanism but, in addition, it has beta-adrenoceptor-blocking activity over the same range of concentrations. A drug with such a pharmacological profile might have the potential advantage of avoiding Ca2+ overload and superfluous oxygen consumption, which may contribute to the unfavorable effects of novel cardiotonic agents that act purely by inhibition of phosphodiesterase III.", 
    "159": "The genetic factors that underlie idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM) have not yet been elucidated. Since beta1-adrenoceptors are downregulated in patients with IDCM, and since beta-blocker therapy is consistently beneficial in this setting, we hypothesized that genetic variation in the beta1-adrenoceptor might affect susceptibility to and/or severity of IDCM. As no intragenic polymorphism was available, a systematic screening of the gene was first performed. The organization and sequence of the human beta1-adrenoceptor gene were established using polymerase chain reaction, single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and sequencing. The gene comprises 1434 bp and no intron was observed. We found a unique and frequent polymorphism (C1165G) which predicts an Arg389Gly substitution. The association of this polymorphism with IDCM was then analysed using the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism method in the CARDIGENE population, a clinically well-characterized population of IDCM. Genotypic distribution was in agreement with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. There were no differences in the beta1-adrenoceptor allele frequencies between IDCM (n=426; C/G=0.76/0.24) and age- and sex-matched control subjects (n=395; C/G=0.78/0.22). Within the patient group, no association was observed with the severity of the disease. In conclusion, the genomic organization of beta1-adrenoceptor is described here for the first time. We found a unique and frequent polymorphism in the coding sequence of the gene. No association was observed between IDCM and the genetic variant. Its possible involvement in other cardiac diseases related to the beta1-adrenoceptor remains to be analysed.", 
    "160": "The effect of propranolol on the occurrence of hypoglycaemic symptoms was assessed in insulin-dependent diabetic patients with hypoglycaemia unawareness. A double-blind, randomised parallel group study (2:1 fashion) was conducted over 4-week period. The propranolol group (n = 9) received 20 mg (week 1 and 2) and 30 mg (week 3 and 4) twice daily, and the other group (n = 5) a matched placebo for 4 weeks. Patients included had experienced at least two severe hypoglycaemic episodes (coma or seizures) during the previous year, which were characterised by a lack of adrenergic symptoms and required the assistance of another person. The mean number of hypoglycaemias during the study period was similar in both groups (placebo: 13 +/- 2 propranolol: 11 +/- 1), whereas the number of totally asymptomatic hypoglycaemias (< 0.6 g/l) was lower on propranolol than on placebo (3 +/- 1 vs 8 +/- 3, NS) and the number of symptomatic hypoglycaemias was higher (7.2 +/- 2 vs 4.6 +/- 1, NS). Subjective evaluation of treatment by the investigators showed 0/5 successes in the placebo group and 5/9 in the propranolol group (chi2 = 4.32, p = 0.038). The main advantage of propranolol over placebo was an increased incidence of sweating. The ratio [number of hypoglycaemias with sweating/total number of hypoglycaemias] being higher with propranolol (0.28 +/- 0.08 vs 0.06 +/- 0.02, p = 0.06). This pilot study suggests that beta-blockers may be useful in restoring adrenergic symptoms during hypoglycaemia in insulin-dependent diabetic patients without warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia. This beneficial effect seems to be predominantly related to an increase in hypoglycaemia-induced sweating. A larger study is needed to confirm or invalidate these preliminary results."
