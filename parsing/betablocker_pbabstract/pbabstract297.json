This study examines whether these risk factors predict CHD among older Japanese-American men. With use of the Honolulu Heart Program Lipoprotein Exam 3 (1980 to 1982) as baseline, and 12-year follow-up for CHD events, a nested, case-control study was designed. One hundred forty-five incident CHD cases were identified and matched to 2 controls each. LDL particle diameter (size) was determined by gradient gel electrophoresis. A 10-angstrom (A) decrease in LDL size at baseline was associated with increased risk of incident CHD (relative risk 1.28, 95% confidence interval 1.01 to 1.63). After adjustment for baseline risk factors, the LDL size association was no longer statistically significant (relative risk 1.13, 95% confidence interval 0.86 to 1.49). When principal components analysis was used to define a composite variable for LDL size, triglycerides, and HDL cholesterol, this component predicted CHD independent of smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes, and beta-blocker use (p <0.01). Therefore, this prospective analysis of data from older, Japanese-American men demonstrated that decreased LDL size is a univariate predictor of incident CHD, and that a composite risk factor of LDL size, triglyceride, and HDL cholesterol was a risk factor for CHD independent of other risk factors.", 
    "1": "The aim of this study was to elucidate time dependence in the development of rebound effect and to quantify the cardiovascular effects of chronic l-propranolol infusions in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressures were monitored both during exercise performance and later by using telemetry. The pharmacodynamics were determined after different infusion lengths of l-propranolol (4 mg/kg/day) or placebo for 4, 8, or 12 days. A pronounced reduction in heart rate over time was found, which was interpreted as a positive influence of exercise on heart rate and was less marked in drug-treated animals. A mechanism-based model that accounts for competitive antagonism, spare receptors, the positive influence of exercise on heart rate, and circadian variations was used to describe the data. An empirical effect compartment model with an E(max) model was related to a circadian baseline and describes the relationship between plasma concentrations and reduction in blood pressures. The potencies for exercise and postexercise systolic blood pressure were similar with EC(50) values of 48 and 56 ng/ml, and the corresponding maximal effects were 17.8 and 21.9%, respectively. The EC(50) values and maximal effects for diastolic blood pressure were 26 and 5 ng/ml and 20.6 and 21.0%, respectively. The effect of l-propranolol could be quantified by a mechanism-based model in the presence of a positive influence of exercise on the heart rate. The effect of l-propranolol on the blood pressures is best described by an effect compartment model with circadian variations.", 
    "2": "We have previously shown racial differences in propranolol kinetics, with the largest differences appearing to be in its 4-hydroxylation. The purpose of this study was to identify and confirm the cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP) with propranolol 4-hydroxylase activity, describe their enzyme kinetics, and determine whether there were racial differences in their catalytic activity. Eleven human recombinant, expressed CYPs were screened, but only CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 possessed propranolol 4-hydroxylase activity. Subsequent studies were conducted in human liver microsomes, including correlation, inhibition, enzyme kinetics, and racial comparison studies. Significant correlations were noted between propranolol 4-hydroxylation and ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylation (marker of CYP1A2 activity), with marked improvement in the correlations when CYP2D6-mediated propranolol 4-hydroxylation was inhibited with quinidine. Inhibition studies showed that quinidine inhibited approximately 55% of propranolol 4-hydroxylation and furaphylline (CYP1A2-selective inhibitor) inhibited about 45% of propranolol 4-hydroxylation. Median (range) parameter estimates of (S)-4-hydroxypropranolol [(S)-HOP] formation were a V(max) value of 307 (165-2397) and 721 (84-1975) pmol/mg of protein/60 min for CYP1A2 and CYP2D6, respectively, and a K(m) value of 21.2 (8.9-77.5) and 8.5 (5.9-31.9) microM for CYP1A2 and CYP2D6, respectively. CYP1A2- and CYP2D6-mediated propranolol 4-hydroxylation was about 70 and 100% higher (P <.05 for both), respectively, in African-Americans compared with Caucasians. In summary, we found that both CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 catalyze formation of 4-hydroxypropranolol and that both enzymes exhibited racial differences in this reaction. The observed racial differences in drug metabolism may have relevance to drug efficacy, toxicity, or carcinogen activation for CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 substrates.", 
    "3": "Pharmacological responses to aryloxypropanolamines were examined in cells expressing rat or human beta(1)-adrenergic receptors (ARs) using adenylyl cyclase assays. The aryloxypropanolamines CGP 12177 and LY 362884, originally developed as beta(3)-AR agonists, were found to stimulate the beta(1)-AR. Interestingly, both CGP 12177 and LY 362884 exhibited an anomalous biphasic effect on beta(1)-AR. Low concentrations of either CGP 12177 or LY 362884 potently blocked isoproterenol-induced stimulation of beta(1)-AR, whereas higher concentrations of these compounds stimulated the beta(1)-AR. The unusual interaction of these aryloxypropanolamine ligands with the beta(1)-AR was further characterized using beta-AR antagonists. Activation of beta(1)-AR by CGP 12177 or LY 362884 was observed to be significantly more resistant to blockade by beta-AR antagonists compared with activation by catecholamines. These results suggest that catecholamines and aryloxypropanolamines interact with distinct active conformations of the beta(1)-AR: a state that is responsive to catecholamines and is blocked with high affinity by CGP 12177 and LY 362884, and a novel state that is activated by aryloxypropanolamines but is resistant to blockade by standard beta-AR antagonists. Moreover, dependence of antagonist affinity on agonist structure is unprecedented, and its implications on the use of beta-AR agonists such as CGP 12177 in receptor classification are discussed.", 
    "4": "To determine the health care resource use and costs of patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension in the Netherlands during the first 2 years after primary diagnosis, we performed a study based on retrospective chart review. Data of 200 patients and their health care resource use were collected in five hospitals. Unit-prices were calculated using micro costing in two hospitals. The mean 2-year costs per patient were estimated to be US$ 877. Outpatient visits to the ophthalmologist and medications were the cost-driving factors, and were responsible for 40 and 30% of total costs, respectively. Total costs were considered to be low, when compared to the estimated costs per patient in Sweden and the USA. In multiple least-squares regression only baseline IOP-value, the change in IOP-value between baseline and the next visit and the hospital of treatment were significantly related with total costs. The variation in costs between patients largely depended on whether or not a patient had undergone surgery.", 
    "5": "Recent data indicated that disposition of oral digoxin is modulated by intestinal P-glycoprotein. The cardioselective beta-blocker talinolol has been described to be secreted by way of P-glycoprotein into the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract after oral and intravenous administration. We therefore hypothesized that coadministration of digoxin and talinolol may lead to a drug-drug interaction based on a competition for intestinal P-glycoprotein.", 
    "6": "Pharmacokinetics of digoxin (0.5 mg orally), talinolol (30 mg intravenously and 100 mg orally), and digoxin plus talinolol orally, as well as digoxin plus talinolol intravenously, were assessed in five male and five female healthy volunteers (age range, 23 to 30 years; body weight, 60 to 95 kg) in a changeover study with at least a 7-day washout period. Digoxin and talinolol were analyzed by fluorescence polarization immunoassay and HPLC, respectively.", 
    "7": "Oral coadministration of 100 mg talinolol increased the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from 0 to 6 hours and the AUC from 0 to 72 hours of digoxin significantly by 18% and 23%, respectively (5.85+/-1.49 versus 7.22+/-1.29 ng x h/mL and 23.0+/-3.3 versus 27.1+/-3.7 ng x h/mL, for both P<.05) and the maximum serum levels by 45%. Renal clearance and half-life of digoxin remained unchanged. Coinfusion of 30 mg talinolol with oral digoxin had no significant effects on digoxin pharmacokinetics. Digoxin did not affect the disposition of talinolol after both oral and intravenous administration.", 
    "8": "We observed a significantly increased bioavailability of digoxin with oral coadministration of talinolol, which is most likely caused by competition for intestinal P-glycoprotein.", 
    "9": "Cardiac hypertrophy is a major predictor of heart failure and of morbidity and mortality in developed countries. Many hormones and growth factors induce cardiac hypertrophy via activation of members of the phospholipase C (PLC) family. The expression pattern of the PLCbeta isozyme subfamily was investigated in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes after stimulation with different hypertrophic stimuli. Under control conditions and after stimulation with norepinephrine, cardiomyocytes expressed similar amounts of PLCbeta3 mRNA. In the presence of fetal calf serum (FCS), additional expression of PLCbeta1 was induced. Growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) both induced a substantial increase in PLCbeta3 mRNA expression. The response to GH could not be abolished by the IGF-I receptor blocker IGF-I analogue indicating an IGF-I-independent action of GH. The upregulation of PLCbeta3 by IGF-I was abolished by preincubation of cardiomyocytes with the IGF-I receptor antagonist IGF-I analogue, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein, the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) inhibitor PD 98059, the phosphatidylinositol-3- (PI-3) kinase inhibitor wortmannin and the p70 S6 kinase inhibitor rapamycin. Induction of the immediate early genes c-myc, c-fos, and c-jun by IGF-I was abolished by preincubation with antisense oligos against PLCbeta3. It is concluded that the expression of PLCbeta isozymes in cardiomyocytes is differentially regulated by different hypertrophic stimuli. The upregulation of PLCbeta3 by IGF-I is dependent on the activity of tyrosine kinase, ERK, PI3 kinase, and p70 S6 kinase and PLCbeta3 expression seems to be required for the induction of immediate early genes by IGF-I. The involvement of the PLCbeta subfamily in signal transduction of receptors other than G-protein-coupled receptors is suggested.", 
    "10": "1. Perforated patch recordings were used to determine how plating atrial cells on laminin alters beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) regulation of L-type Ca2+ current (ICa,L). 2. Isoproterenol (isoprenaline; ISO; 0.01 microM), a non-selective beta-AR agonist, elicited a greater stimulation of ICa,L in cells plated on laminin (+79 +/- 16 %; n = 17) than on glass (+33 +/- 5 %; n = 23). Also, desensitization to ISO was greater in cells on laminin (-16 +/- 2 %) than on glass (-3 +/- 1 %). Atenolol (0.1 microM), a selective beta1-AR antagonist, inhibited the effects of ISO in cells on glass but not laminin. Conversely, 0.1 microM ICI 118,551, a selective beta2-AR antagonist, inhibited the effects of ISO in cells on laminin but not glass. With beta2-ARs blocked, ISO-induced stimulation of ICa,L was greater in cells on glass than laminin. 3. Zinterol (0.01-0.1 microM), a selective beta2-AR agonist, elicited a greater stimulation of ICa,L in cells on laminin than on glass. The effects of zinterol were blocked by ICI 118,551. 4. ISO-induced stimulation of ICa,L was greater in cells plated on an alphabeta1-integrin antibody than on glass. Also, addition of 20 microM cytochalasin D to cells on laminin prevented the enhanced effects of ISO typically elicited in cells on laminin alone. 5. We conclude that laminin binding to alphabeta1-integrins, in conjunction with the actin cytoskeleton, reduces beta1-AR and enhances beta2-AR signalling which regulates ICa,L. This novel mechanism may contribute to remodelling of beta-AR signalling in the failing heart.", 
    "11": "To analyze the recent change in the long-term survival of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), the present study comprised consecutive 111 patients with ejection fraction <50% and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter >58 mm. who were admitted to hospital from January 1983 to December 1994. The patients were divided into 2 groups: group A who were diagnosed before 1989 and group B diagnosed after 1990. Basic characteristics at diagnosis, including age, NYHA functional class, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and ejection fraction, were similar between these 2 groups. Calculated survival rate at 5 years was 90.0% in group B in contrast to 62.3% in group A. Event-free survival also improved in group B. In group B, beta-blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors were more frequently used than in group A (p<0.0001) whereas digitalis and other positive inotropic agents were significantly less used. Left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly improved during the follow-up period in patients treated with beta-blockers compared with those not treated with beta-blockers. These data indicate a significant improvement in the survival of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy after 1990, which may be explained by the change of medical treatment, especially the use of beta-blockers.", 
    "12": "The increase of extracellular 5-HT in brain terminal regions produced by the acute administration of 5-HT reuptake inhibitors (SSRI's) is hampered by the activation of somatodendritic 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors in the raphe nuclei. The present in vivo electrophysiological studies were undertaken, in the rat, to assess the effects of the coadministration of venlafaxine, a dual 5-HT/NE reuptake inhibitor, and (-)pindolol on pre- and postsynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptor function. The acute administration of venlafaxine and of the SSRI paroxetine (5 mg/kg, i.v.) induced a suppression of the firing activity of dorsal hippocampus CA(3) pyramidal neurons. This effect of venlafaxine was markedly potentiated by a pretreatment with (-)pindolol (15 mg/kg, i.p.) but not by the selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist metoprolol (15 mg/kg, i.p.). That this effect of venlafaxine was mediated by an activation of postsynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptors was suggested by its complete reversal by the 5-HT(1A) antagonist WAY 100635 (100 microg/kg, i.v.). A short-term treatment with VLX (20 mg/kg/day x 2 days) resulted in a ca. 90% suppression of the firing activity of 5-HT neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus. This was prevented by the coadministration of (-)pindolol (15 mg/kg/day x 2 days). Taken together, these results indicate that (-)pindolol potentiated the activation of postsynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptors resulting from 5-HT reuptake inhibition probably by blocking the somatodendritic 5-HT(1A) autoreceptor, but not its postsynaptic congener. These results support and extend previous findings providing a biological substratum for the efficacy of pindolol as an accelerating strategy in major depression.", 
    "13": "A novel strategy for improving the treatment of depressive illness is augmentation of antidepressants with a 5-HT1(1A) autoreceptor antagonist. However, trials using the 5-HT1(1A)/beta-blocker pindolol are proving inconsistent. We report how positron emission tomography (PET) and in vitro autoradiography can inform trials of antidepressant augmentation. We show that in healthy volunteers, in vivo, pindolol (n = 10) and penbutolol (n = 4), but not tertatolol (n = 4) occupy the human 5-HT(1A) receptors, at clinical doses. Pindolol, as well as the beta-blockers penbutolol and tertatolol, has high affinity for human 5-HT(1A) receptors in post-mortem brain slices (n = 4). Pindolol shows preference for 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors versus the post-synaptic receptors both in vitro and in vivo. Our data reveal that pindolol doses used in antidepressant trials so far are suboptimal for significant occupancy at the 5-HT(1A) autoreceptor. Penbutolol or higher doses of pindolol are candidates for testing as antidepressant augmenting regimes in future clinical trials.", 
    "14": "Strenuous, anaerobic exercise leads to an increase of leukocytes that are mobilized from the marginal pool. We have analyzed in human peripheral blood the effect of exercise on the number of CD14(+)CD16(+) monocytes as determined by two-color immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. We show herein that this type of monocyte responds with a dramatic up to 4.8-fold increase. Mobilization does not occur after 1 min at 100 or 200 W but 1 min at 400 W leads to a twofold increase of the CD14(+)CD16(+) monocytes immediately after exercise. The numbers remain high at 5 min and gradually decrease to reach the initial level at 20 min postexercise. After 20 min of rest, the CD14(+)CD16(+) monocytes can be mobilized again by a second exercise. The CD14(+)CD16(+) monocytes appear to be mobilized from the marginal pool where they preferentially home because of a higher expression of adhesion molecules like CD11d and very late antigen-4. Exercise goes along with an increase of catecholamines, and mobilization of the CD14(+)CD16(+) monocytes can be substantially reduced by treatment of donors with the beta-adrenergic receptor blocker propranolol. Mobilization of CD14(+)CD16(+) monocytes by a catecholamine-dependent mechanism may contribute to the increase of these cells in various clinical conditions.",

    "16": "From 1987, eligible patients were randomized to an ICD, amiodarone, propafenone, or metoprolol (ICD versus antiarrhythmic agents randomization ratio 1:3). Assignment to propafenone was discontinued in March 1992, after an interim analysis conducted in 58 patients showed a 61% higher all-cause mortality rate than in 61 ICD patients during a follow-up of 11.3 months. The study continued to recruit 288 patients in the remaining 3 study groups; of these, 99 were assigned to ICDs, 92 to amiodarone, and 97 to metoprolol. The primary end point was all-cause mortality. The study was terminated in March 1998, when all patients had concluded a minimum 2-year follow-up. Over a mean follow-up of 57+/-34 months, the crude death rates were 36.4% (95% CI 26.9% to 46.6%) in the ICD and 44.4% (95% CI 37.2% to 51.8%) in the amiodarone/metoprolol arm. Overall survival was higher, though not significantly, in patients assigned to ICD than in those assigned to drug therapy (1-sided P=0.081, hazard ratio 0.766, [97.5% CI upper bound 1.112]). In ICD patients, the percent reductions in all-cause mortality were 41.9%, 39.3%, 28. 4%, 27.7%, 22.8%, 11.4%, 9.1%, 10.6%, and 24.7% at years 1 to 9 of follow-up.",

    "18": "Electrical storm (ES), defined as recurrent multiple ventricular fibrillation (VF) episodes, often occurs in patients with recent myocardial infarction. Because treating ES according to the Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) guidelines yields a poor outcome, we evaluated the efficacy of sympathetic blockade in treating ES patients and compared their outcome with that of patients treated according to the ACLS guidelines.", 
    "19": "Forty-nine patients (36 men, 13 women, mean age 57+/-10 years) who had ES associated with a recent myocardial infarction were separated into 2 groups. Patients in group 1 (n=27) received sympathetic blockade treatment: 6 left stellate ganglionic blockade, 7 esmolol, and 14 propranolol. Patients in group 2 (n=22) received antiarrhythmic medication as recommended by the ACLS guidelines. Patient characteristics were similar in the 2 groups. The 1-week mortality rate was higher in group 2: 18 (82%) of the 22 patients died, all of refractory VF; 6 (22%) of the 27 group 1 patients died, 3 of refractory VF (P<0.0001). Patients who survived the initial ES event did well over the 1-year follow-up period: Overall survival in group 1 was 67%, compared with 5% in group 2 (P<0.0001).", 
    "20": "Sympathetic blockade is superior to the antiarrhythmic therapy recommended by the ACLS guidelines in treating ES patients.

    "21": "Carvedilol is a vasodilating beta-blocker and antioxidant approved for treatment of mild to moderate hypertension. angina, and congestive heart failure. Metoprolol is a beta1-selective adrenoceptor antagonist. When carvedilol and metoprolol were recently compared in clinical trials for heart failure, each showed beneficial beta-blocker effects such as improved symptoms, quality of life, exercise tolerance, and ejection fraction, with no between-group differences. When thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) levels were measured in serum as an indirect marker of free radical activity, there were also no between-group differences. However, we had noted superior cardioprotection by carvedilol in comparison to metoprolol in ischemia and reperfusion models. We therefore examined antioxidant activity directly in cells and tissues. Here we show that in cultured rat cerebellar neurons, and in brain and heart membranes, carvedilol has far greater antioxidant activity than metoprolol, which is essentially inactive as an antioxidant in these model systems. The antioxidant activity of carvedilol could be explained by a greater degree of lipophilicity, as measured by its ClogP value of 3.841 as contrasted to a ClogP value of 1.346 for metoprolol. Alternatively, the molecular structure of carvedilol favors redox recycling, which the structure of metoprolol does not. Therefore, carvedilol could have additional pharmacologic effects that are favorable for long-term therapy.", 
    "22": "Recent data indicate that the estrogen receptor (ER) blocker tamoxifen (TAM) can induce cell death in malignant melanoma cells. However, as shown in the present study and several other studies melanoma cells usually do not express classical ERs. In the present study we investigated whether the cytotoxic effect of TAM on melanoma cells could depend on interference with the expression or function of the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), a plasma membrane receptor important for cell survival in this tumor cell type. Several melanoma cell lines were included in the analysis. Administration of TAM at a concentration of 15 microm or more resulted in cell death of the melanoma cells within 48 h. TAM treatment was correlated to a slight to moderate inhibition of IGF-1 binding to IGF-1R. Since it has been reported that TAM can increase the release of IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) we then investigated whether this mechanism could underly the decreased IGF-1 binding. However, we could demonstrate that the amount of released IGFBPs were unchanged or decreased in TAM-treated cells. Whereas TAM did not have any strong effect on IGF-1 binding and the expression of IGF-1R at the cell surface, it was was found to efficently block tyrosine phosphorylation of IGF-1R beta-subunit. Taken together, our data suggest that TAM-induced cytotoxicity of malignant melanoma cells can be due to inactivation of IGF-1R.", 
    "23": "Social phobia is a common disorder associated with significant psychosocial impairment, representing a substantial public health problem largely determined by the high prevalence, and the lifelong chronicity. Social phobia starts in early childhood or adolescence and is often comorbid with depression, other anxiety disorders, alcohol and substance abuse or eating disorders. This cascade of comorbidity, usually secondary to social phobia, increases the disability associated with the condition. The possibility that social phobia may be a trigger for later developing comorbid disorders directs attention to the need for early effective treatment as a preventive measure. The most recent drug class to be investigated for the psychopharmacological treatment of social phobia is the SSRI group for which there is growing support. The other drug classes that have been evaluated are monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), benzodiazepines, and beta-blockers. The SSRIs represent a new and attractive therapeutic choice for patients with generalized social phobia. Recently the first, large scale, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy of drug treatment in generalized social phobia has been completed with paroxetine. Paroxetine was more effective in reducing the symptoms than placebo and was well tolerated. Many now regard SSRIs as the drugs of choice in social phobia because of their effectiveness and because they avoid the problems of treatment with benzodiazepines or classical MAOIs.",

Isoprenaline and terbutaline were more potent on circular than taenia strips; CGP 12177 and SR 58611A weakly and partially relaxed taenia but had little effect on circular strips. The potency of isoprenaline on circular strips was greatly reduced by the beta(1) selective antagonist CGP 20712 (10(-7) mol/l), and less so by ICI 118551 (10(-7) mol/l, beta(2) selective). CGP 20712 and ICI 118551 together (both 3 x 10(-6) mol/l) had no effect on taenia relaxation by SR 58611A and rendered isoprenaline and terbutaline virtually inactive on circular strips, although not on taenia, which was relaxed at higher than control concentrations and maximally by isoprenaline. Propranolol, a beta(1), beta(2) non-selective antagonist, at high concentrations (10(-5) mol/l) prevented taenia relaxation by CGP 12177 and SR 58611A; its quantitative antagonism of isoprenaline (in common with that of CGP 12177 used as an antagonist) was competitive in circular strips but not on taenia.",

    "31": "Neonatal handling is known to induce long-lasting changes in behavioral and neuroendocrine responses to stress. Since the central noradrenergic system participates in the adaptive responses to stressful conditions we have analyzed the effects of postnatal handling on beta-adrenoceptor binding sites and isoprenaline- and forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation in cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum of rats at 1 and 3 months of age. Handled animals showed reduced emotional reactivity and lower ACTH and corticosterone secretion after stress. Binding studies using [(3) H]CGP12-177 revealed increased beta-adrenoceptor binding sites in handled rats in cerebellum and cerebral cortex with no changes in hippocampus, and decreased affinity in all cerebral regions. Handling reduced basal levels of cyclic AMP in hippocampus and cerebellum but not in cerebral cortex. The concentration-response curves of cyclic AMP to isoprenaline were displaced to the right in cerebellum of handled rats without differences in Emax; however, Emax was significantly reduced in cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Direct stimulation of the catalytic subunit of adenylyl cyclase by forskolin reduced the efficiency in hippocampus and cerebellum, but not in cerebral cortex of handled animals. It is concluded that neonatal handling reduces the binding properties of beta-adrenoceptor and its primary biochemical responses in the young rat brain, which may account for the reduced responsiveness to stress attained in the handled rats, and may explain the persistence of the effect. The present study emphasizes the role of the central noradrenergic system in modulating the behavioral and neurendocrine responses to neonatal handling.",

However, as current clinical practice has changed radically from the time when the majority of these trials were conducted, further trial evidence would be desirable.", 
    "37": "The MERIT-HF study was designed to investigate the effect of once-daily dosing of metoprolol succinate CR/XL added to standard therapy in patients with chronic heart failure. A screening programme, aiming at identifying eligible patients for the study was used by 231 out of 313 sites, resulting in 8912 screened patients. These patients were older, more often women, had marginally higher ejection fraction and were more often in NYHA class IV compared to the finally randomised patients. There was a positive correlation between the number of screened and randomised patients and due to the high inclusion rate the number of randomised patients was increased from 3200 to 3991 patients. The clinical events were defined by a manual and were based on identical classifications made independently by two members of an Independent Endpoint Committee. Data from the case report form and the classifications made by the Endpoint Committee were in accordance for hospitalisation due to worsening heart failure on 722 occasions. On 207 occasions the data from the case report forms and the classification made by the committee differed regarding this clinical event. The Independent Safety Committee monitored safety aspects of the study by using asymmetric group sequential procedures. The study was stopped early on recommendation from the Independent Safety Committee, when the second pre-specified interim analysis (50% of total number of expected deaths) showed that the criterion for stopping due to benefit had been met and exceeded. In conclusion, a screening programme facilitated patient recruitment and showed the characteristics of the background population, the event classification was improved by using an independent endpoint committee, and the safety monitoring allowed an early closure of the study due to mortality benefit, without jeopardising the final analyses of the results.", 
    "38": "Carvedilol has been shown to be beneficial for patients with heart failure, but it is not clear how it should be initiated in routine clinical practice, particularly in the elderly. This study is a retrospective review of 19 patients of age 80+/-4 years with heart failure, who had Carvedilol treatment initiated in a routine outpatient clinic. No patient experienced a worsening of their heart failure or required admission to hospital. There was a mean reduction in heart rate of 11 beats/min. Carvedilol was tolerated by 68% of the patients. Thus, Carvedilol can be safely initiated in a routine outpatient clinic in appropriately selected elderly patients.", 
    "39": "The cardiovascular actions of python bradykinin (BK) and substance P (SP) have been investigated in the anesthetized ball python, Python regius. Bolus intra-arterial injections of python BK (0.03-3 nmol/kg) produced concentration-dependent increases in arterial blood pressure, heart rate (HR), and cardiac output concomitant with small decreases in systemic resistance and stroke volume. Intra-arterial injection of 3 nmol/kg python BK produced a tenfold increase in circulating concentration of norepinephrine, but epinephrine levels did not change. BK-induced tachycardia was attenuated (>90%) by the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist sotalol, and the hypertensive response was attenuated (>70%) by the alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist prazosin, indicating that effects of python BK are mediated at least in part by activation of the extensive network of adrenergic neurons present in vascular tissues. Bolus intra-arterial injections of python SP in the range 0. 01-30 pmol/kg produced concentration-dependent decreases in arterial blood pressure and systemic peripheral resistance concomitant with increases in cardiac output and stroke volume but with only minor effects on HR. The data suggest that kinins play a physiologically important role in cardiovascular regulation in the python.", 
    "40": "The genetically, seasonally, and diet-induced obese, glucose-intolerant states in rodents, including ob/ob mice, have each been associated with elevated hypothalamic levels of norepinephrine (NE). With the use of quantitative autoradiography on brain slices of 6-wk-old obese (ob/ob) and lean mice, the adrenergic receptor populations in several hypothalamic nuclei were examined. The binding of [(125)I]iodocyanopindolol to beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenergic receptors in ob/ob mice was significantly increased in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVN) by 30 and 38%, in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) by 23 and 72%, and in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) by 10 and 15%, respectively, relative to lean controls. The binding of [(125)I]iodo-4-hydroxyphenyl-ethyl-aminomethyl-tetralone to alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors was also significantly increased in the PVN (26%), VMH (67%), and LH (21%) of ob/ob mice. In contrast, the binding of [(125)I]paraiodoclonidine to alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors in ob/ob mice was significantly decreased in the VMH (38%) and the dorsomedial hypothalamus (17%) relative to lean controls. This decrease was evident in the alpha(2A)- but not the alpha(2BC)-receptor subtype. Scatchard analysis confirmed this decreased density of alpha(2)-receptors in ob/ob mice. Together with earlier studies, these changes in hypothalamic adrenergic receptors support a role for increased hypothalamic NE activity in the development of the metabolic syndrome of ob/ob mice.", 
    "41": "Hormones and growth factors induce in many cell types the production of phosphatidic acid (PA), which has been proposed to play a role as a second messenger. We have previously shown in an acellular system that PA selectively stimulates certain isoforms of type 4 cAMP-phosphodiesterases (PDE4). Here we studied the effect of endogenous PA on PDE activity of transiently transfected MA10 cells overexpressing the PA-sensitive isoform PDE4D3. Cell treatment with inhibitors of PA degradation, including propranolol, induced an accumulation of endogenous PA accompanied by a stimulation of PDE activity and a significant decrease in both cAMP levels and protein kinase A activity. Furthermore, in FRTL5 cells, which natively express PDE4D3, pretreatment with compounds inducing PA accumulation prevented both cAMP increase and cAMP-responsive element-binding protein phosphorylation triggered by thyroid-stimulating hormone. To determine the mechanism of PDE stimulation by PA, endogenous phospholipids were labeled by preincubating MA10 cells overexpressing PDE4D3 with [(32)P]orthophosphate. Immuno- precipitation experiments showed that PA was specifically bound to PDE4D3, supporting the hypothesis that PDE4D3 activation occurs through direct binding of PA to the protein. PA binding site on PDE4D3 was characterized by engineering deletions of selected regions in the N-terminal regulatory domain of the enzyme. Deletion of amino acid residues 31-59 suppressed both PA-activating effect and PA binding, suggesting that this region rich in basic and hydrophobic residues contains the PA binding site. These observations strongly suggest that endogenous PA can modulate cAMP levels in intact cells, through a direct activation of PDE4D3.", 
    "42": "The three known subtypes of beta-adrenoreceptors (beta(1)-AR, beta(2)-AR, and beta(3)-AR) are differentially expressed in brown and white adipose tissue and mediate peripheral responses to central modulation of sympathetic outflow by leptin. To assess the relative roles of the beta-AR subtypes in mediating leptin's effects on adipocyte gene expression, mice with a targeted disruption of the beta(3)-adrenoreceptor gene (beta(3)-AR KO) were treated with vehicle or the beta(1)/beta(2)-AR selective antagonist, propranolol (20 microgram/g body weight/day) prior to intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections of leptin (0.1 microgram/g body weight/day). Leptin produced a 3-fold increase in UCP1 mRNA in brown adipose tissue of wild type (FVB/NJ) and beta(3)-AR KO mice. The response was unaltered by propranolol in wild type mice, but was completely blocked by this antagonist in beta(3)-AR KO mice. In contrast, ICV leptin had no effect on leptin mRNA in either epididymal or retroperitoneal white adipose tissue (WAT) from beta(3)-AR KOs. Moreover, propranolol did not block the ability of exogenous leptin to reduce leptin mRNA in either WAT depot site of wild type mice. These results demonstrate that the beta(3)-AR is required for leptin-mediated regulation of ob mRNA expression in WAT, but is interchangeable with the beta(1)/beta(2)-ARs in mediating leptin's effect on UCP1 mRNA expression in brown adipose tissue.",

    "64": "In this crossover trial, 20 patients with POAG (n = 10) or OHT (n = 10) were treated with timolol, latanoprost, and dorzolamide for 1 month. The treatment sequence was randomized. All patients underwent measurements for four 24-hour tonometric curves: at baseline and after each 1-month period of treatment. The patients were admitted to the hospital, and IOP was measured by two well-trained evaluators masked to treatment assignment. Measurements were taken at 3, 6, and 9 AM and noon and at 3, 6, and 9 PM and midnight by handheld electronic tonometer (TonoPen XL; Bio-Rad, Glendale, CA) with the patient supine and sitting, and a Goldmann applanation tonometer (Haag-Streit, Bern, Switzerland) with the patient sitting at the slit lamp. Systemic blood pressure was recorded at the same times. The between-group differences were tested for significance by means of parametric analysis of variance. The circadian IOP curve of a small group of untreated healthy young subjects was also recorded using the same procedures.

    "67": "Serial echocardiographic investigations were carried out on patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, to evaluate treatment effects on left ventricular (LV) performance during therapy with either metoprolol or captopril. Thirty-two patients (23 males and 9 females) with mild to moderate symptoms of heart failure (NYHA II-III) and a mean age of 49 years were included in the investigation. The patients were investigated with Doppler echocardiography before treatment, after 3 and 6 months of treatment (either metoprolol or captopril) and 1 month after withdrawal of treatment. Intra- and inter-investigator reproducibility was acceptable, with a coefficient of variation of less than 5% for LV dimensions. A reduction in LV dimensions was seen in both treatment groups. In the metoprolol group there was also an increase in LV stroke volume and fractional shortening. The non-invasive data were in accordance with invasive measurements of stroke volume and LV filling pressure. In patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and mild to moderate symptoms of heart failure, echocardiography seemed to be sufficiently reproducible to be used for determination of treatment effects in a longitudinal heart failure study. Both metoprolol and captopril were well tolerated and had favourable effects on LV performance.", 
    "68": "Coronary heart disease and beta-blocker treatment can increase the use of the Frank-Starling mechanism during exercise. The aim of the study was to assess whether this could be influenced by physical training. Male patients on beta-blocker treatment after myocardial infarction were randomised to four weeks of training (ET, n = 19) or to a control group (Ctr, n = 18). Cardiac output (CO) at rest and at identical submaximal exercise levels in each patient were determined by radionuclide ventriculography at baseline and after the intervention period. CO was calculated as end diastolic volume (EDV) x ejection fraction x heart rate, and deltaCO and deltaEDV as change in parameter from rest to exercise. The mean (SD) deltaCO decreased from 6.5 (2.1) L/min(-1) to 5.1 (2.4) in ET patients and increased from 5.0 (1.7) to 5.8 (2.7) in Ctr, p = 0.004. deltaEDV decreased from 30 (30) mL to 12 (35) in ET and increased from 11 (20) to 36 (33) in Ctr, p = 0.005. When adjusting for baseline dissimilarities between the groups in a multivariate linear regression analysis, these differences were still statistically significant, p = 0.018 and p = 0.044, respectively. Physical training reduces the CO increase needed to perform identical submaximal exercise, and this is accompanied by less left ventricular dilatation, with a potential for reducing exercise-induced ischaemia.", 
    "69": "Myocardial contractile function after coronary artery bypass graft surgery is often depressed and may require inotropic support, particularly in patients on treatment with beta-adrenergic and Ca2+ blockers. In view of the increase in cytosolic Ca2+ during early reperfusion, use of Ca2+ sensitizing agents may be preferable to adrenergic agonists for enhancement of contractile function after cardioplegic arrest. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of the Ca2+ sensitizer, levosimendan, as an inotrope on the mechanical recovery of hearts after normothermic and hypothermic cardioplegic arrest in the absence and presence of Ca2+ and beta-blockers. Isolated perfused working guinea pig hearts were perfused in the absence or presence of propranolol (10(-6) M) and/or nifedipine (10(-8) M), subjected to 45 minutes of normothermic or 180 minutes of hypothermic cardioplegic arrest, reperfused, and exposed to increasing concentrations of levosimendan (10(-9) to 10(-6) M). Levosimendan (10(-7) to 10(-6) M) has positive inotropic, chronotropic, and vasodilatory effects on normoxic perfused control hearts, as well as during reperfusion after 45 minutes of normothermic cardioplegic arrest. Similar effects were elicited in the presence of the blockers. Levosimendan had no stimulatory effect during reperfusion of hearts subjected to prior hypothermic arrest. Except for the increase in heart rate, the effects of levosimendan on functional performance during reperfusion were comparable with those of adrenaline. Levosimendan elicits a positive inotropic and chronotropic response during reperfusion of hearts after normothermic cardioplegic arrest, both in the absence and presence of Ca2+ and beta-adrenergic blockers.", 
    "70": "Elevated blood pressure is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular illness and death. Efforts to reduce that risk have led to recommendations for a wide array of nondrug and drug therapies. Choosing the optimal first-line drug for hypertensive patients should address a hierarchy of treatment goals: decrease in morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension, decrease in blood pressure, good tolerance, dosing convenience and low cost. This article examines the evidence for beta-blockers as a class of first-line antihypertensive drugs in light of these treatment goals. The evidence indicates that beta-blockers are probably not as effective in reducing morbidity and mortality as low-dose thiazide diuretics and that there may be significant differences in effectiveness among various beta-blockers.",

An ascending, multiple-dose study was completed in 20 male patients with stable New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV CHF. The pharmacokinetics of carvedilol, S(-)-carvedilol, R(+)-carvedilol, and the active metabolites of carvedilol was assessed at steady state after twice-daily oral administration of carvedilol for 7 days at 6.25, 12.5, 25, and 50 mg doses. Carvedilol exhibited stereoselective pharmacokinetics in CHF patients with dose-proportional increases in steady-state plasma concentrations of carvedilol and its enantiomers. Mean AUC and Cmax values for carvedilol were up to twofold higher in patients with Class IV CHF as compared to those with Class III CHF. Steady-state plasma concentrations of the active metabolites also increased in a dose-proportional manner and were typically 10% or less of that observed for carvedilol. In general, carvedilol was adequately tolerated by adult male CHF patients at the dose levels (6.25-50 mg) evaluated in this study as adverse events were consistent with those frequently observed in patients with CHF.", 
    "72": "An automated liquid chromatographic/tandem mass spectrometric (LC/MS/MS) method is presented for the screening and confirmation of 16 beta-blocking drugs in clinical and autopsy urine samples. The described method involved C(18) solid phase extraction, LC separation and MS analysis on a triple-stage quadrupole mass analyser. Samples were initially pre-screened for the presence of any beta-blocking drugs using LC/MS with selected ion monitoring. Any compounds tentatively identified as beta-blocking drugs on the basis of their LC retention time and protonated molecular ion were then automatedly subjected to a second analysis in which the relevant MS/MS product ion mass spectra were acquired. These product ion mass spectra were then automatically searched against a 400-substance mass spectral library containing previously acquired beta-blocking drugs. The results demonstrated that library search of beta-blocking drugs in urine with MS/MS product ion mass spectra was more reliable and produced fewer false negatives than library searching with mass spectra derived from single-stage quadrupole MS. The limits of identification in the MS/MS product ion scan ranged from 0.02 mg l(-1) for carvedilol to 1.2 mg l(-1) for pindolol, the majority of the values being below 0.2 mg l(-1).",

    "77": "Cationic colloidal gold (CCG), a polycationic histochemical probe, was used to analyze the distribution of glomerular basement membrane (GBM) polyanions, mainly heparan sulfate proteoglycan in spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR) with or without salt loading and antihypertensive treatment with propranolol. The changes of mean GBM width and anionic sites distribution were assessed by electron microscopy. Plasma and urinary nitrates (NO(x)) were measured by nitrite (NO2) + nitrate (NO3), stable metabolites of NO. SHR had decreased NO production and increased GBM width (27%) compared with the control Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. The chronic high dietary salt intake resulted in a significant increase in blood pressure, proteinuria, and renal function in the SHR rats. The chronic high salt dietary intake resulted in a decrease in NO in the WKY and a further reduction in NO production in the SHR. The GBM anionic sites count was similar in the SHR and WKY nonsalt-loaded groups, 13.5 +/- 0.5 and 12.8 +/- 0.4 CCG counts/microm GBM, respectively, but significantly lower in both salt-loaded SHR and WKY, 9.9 +/- 0.55 (P < .01) and 9.6 +/- 0.55 (P < .01) CCG counts/microm GBM, respectively. Antihypertensive treatment with propranolol in the salt-loaded SHR group resulted in lower blood pressure, a further decrease in NO production, but no significant changes in GBM width and anionic sites count. It is concluded that chronic high salt intake may be deleterious to the permselectivity of the GBM. A low NO production state that results from chronic salt loading in already hypertensive rats will result in more severe organ (renal) damage, most probably by the addition of the loss of GBM permselectivity to the existing pathomorphologic changes.",

The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of atenolol (beta1-blocker agent) and irbesartan (angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist) on plasma levels of hemostatic/fibrinolytic and endothelial function markers in a cohort of previously untreated hypertensives. Fifty-four patients were randomly assigned to atenolol 25 to 150 mg (26 patients) or irbesartan 75 to 300 mg (28 patients). The plasma levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 antigen, thrombomodulin, tissue factor pathway inhibitor antigen, fibrinogen, and factor XII were determined before and after 6 months of therapy. Age, gender distribution, body mass index, lipid profile, and baseline values of the measured markers were similar in both groups. Baseline values for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, as well as the reduction after treatment, were not significantly different between the two groups. Treatment with irbesartan was associated with a significant decrease in the levels of all the parameters. Similar findings were observed in the atenolol group, except for factor XII and tissue factor pathway inhibitor levels, which were not significantly decreased in this group. The reduction, however, of fibrinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and thrombomodulin was significantly greater in the irbesartan than in the atenolol group. In conclusion, the results indicated that, despite an equally controlled blood pressure, 6-month therapy with irbesartan was associated with a more favorable modification of hemostatic/fibrinolytic status than atenolol.",

The commercial ristocetin A CSP (Chirobiotic R) was subsequently studied in packed column SFC with similar results where the enantiomers of warfarin (R(s) = 2.2), coumachlor (R(s) = 2.5) and thalidomide (R(s) = 0.6) were separated. Interestingly, differences were observed between the two differently immobilised CSPs where the enantiomers of dichlorprop and ketoprofen, which were separated on the 'in-house' CSP, could not be separated on the commercial phase.", 
    "86": "Currently available antidepressants have a delayed onset of action and there is considerable interest in developing new products which exhibit a shorter time to response. Previous authors have suggested using a cure model to characterize the time to response for the combination of the patients who respond and the patients who do not respond. In this paper, we use the cure model and propose a Cramer-von Mises statistic to compare the time to response distributions for patients who respond to therapy. The asymptotic null distribution of the statistic is derived. A bootstap procedure is also proposed for sample sizes typical in antidepressant clinical trials. Results of the simulation study suggest that for common designs and sample sizes used in such trials, the statistic has reasonable size and power properties as long as censoring is moderate.", 
    "87": "Abnormal fat metabolism plays an important role in the pathogenesis of obesity-related type 2 diabetes mellitus. This study examined whether free fatty acid levels (FFAs), like insulin levels, oscillate rapidly in plasma. Peripheral and portal blood samples from dogs were assayed for FFA, glycerol, glucose, and insulin. FFA and glycerol showed correlated oscillatory profiles, with about 8 pulses/hour. Omental lipolysis was also pulsatile, with about 10 pulses/hour, and insulin levels oscillated rapidly in plasma with about 7 pulses/hour. We applied an insulin clamp, beta-adrenergic blockade, or both together, to determine the driving force behind the FFA oscillation, and we analyzed our findings by approximate entropy (ApEn) for which lower values suggest regular pulses and higher values suggest disorder. Under basal conditions, ApEn was 0.3 +/- 0.2. With insulin not oscillating, FFA still cycled at about 9 pulses/hour and the ApEn was 0.2 +/- 0.1. In contrast, beta-blockade, either in the presence or absence of an insulin clamp, removed the FFA oscillation in three of nine dogs. In the other six dogs, the oscillatory profile was unchanged, but ApEn was significantly higher than basal values, suggesting that the regularity of the profile was disrupted. These results suggest that the FFA oscillation is driven by the central nervous system, not by insulin.",

Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis demonstrated the presence of beta(2)- but not beta(1)-adrenergic receptors on endothelial cells. In the absence of calcium, metabolized nebivolol failed to increase NO production, suggesting a role for calcium-dependent NO synthase.

The suppressive effect of adrenaline on NO production was mediated via beta1 and beta2 adrenergic receptors since isoprenaline (a non-selective beta1 and beta2 agonist), dobutamine and salbutamol (selective beta1 and beta2 agonists, respectively) had similar effects on the NO response. In addition, the inhibitory effect of adrenaline on NO was abrogated by both propranolol (a non-specific beta blocker) and atenolol (a specific beta1 inhibitor).

The LVEDP in Group-C2 was significantly lower than that in Group-V (7.4+/-1.4 and 12.2+/-1.2 mmHg, respectively, P<0. 05). The area of myocardial fibrosis in Group-C2 was smaller than that in Group-V (12+/-1 and 31+/-2%, P<0.01).

In patients without complications who were receiving drug treatment, 25% of physicians would not intensify therapy for a persistent diastolic BP of 94 mm Hg, and 33% would not intensify therapy for a systolic BP of 158 mm Hg. Physicians were generally less aggressive in older patients. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were the most common first-line drug choice. Forty-one percent of physicians had not heard of or were not familiar with the JNC guidelines.

    "117": "The superior ovarian nerve (SON) arrives at the ovary through the suspensory ligament and innervates mainly the ovarian stroma. Most neurones from which the SON fibres originate are located in the complex coeliac and mesenteric ganglia. Taking into account that other ganglia have been shown to have alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors, and that the coeliac ganglion receives adrenergic fibres from other sympathetic paravertebral and preaortic ganglia, we utilised adrenergic agonists and antagonists specific to the ganglion, to analyse the role of the alpha and beta receptors in ovarian physiology. To that end, it was necessary to develop and standardise an in vitro coeliac ganglion-SON-ovary (coeliac ganglion-SON-O) experimental system that would enable study of the release of steroids in the ovary in the absence of humoral factors. We investigated the effect of adrenergic agents on the liberation of progesterone in the different stages of the oestrous cycle. To this end we placed the coeliac ganglion and the ovary in different compartments, connected through the SON, to produce a system being studied as a whole. Combined neural and hormonal (luteinising hormone (LH)) effects were also examined. Non-specific stimulation with KCl in the ganglion compartment evoked different responses in terms of release of progesterone, depending on the physiological conditions of the cycle; this demonstrated the sensitivity and viability of the system. During pro-oestrus, stimulation of the ganglion compartment with adrenergic agents such as the agonist noradrenaline or the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, did not modify the release of progesterone. In contrast, the alpha-adrenergic antagonist, phentolamine, induced a strong inhibitory response. During the oestrous stage, noradrenaline was inactive, but phentolamine and propranolol exerted a strong stimulus throughout the experiment. On dioestrus day 1 (D1), both noradrenaline and propranolol increased the release of ovarian progesterone, whereas phentolamine had the opposite effect. Finally, on dioestrus day 2 (D2), what was noteworthy was the pronounced inhibitory effect of noradrenaline, whereas phentolamine was inactive and propranolol showed its greatest stimulatory effect. In order to compare the combined neural and endocrine effects on the ovarian release of progesterone, the experiment was carried out during stages D1 and D2, when the corpora lutea are at their peak of activity. Adrenergic agents were added to the ganglion and LH in a final concentration of 50 ng/ml was added to the ovarian comparment. Different effects were observed indicating a differential response to these agents in stimulated and basal conditions. We conclude that the in vitro coeliac ganglion-SON-ovary system is a functional entity because it possesses its own autonomic tone. This is verified because different basal values of progesterone appear in the different stages of the oestrous cycle. In similar fashion, variations of progesterone induced via the neural pathway were observed under different experimental conditions. In contrast, on D2, noradrenaline added to the ganglion compartment had an inhibitory effect on the liberation of ovarian progesterone. This would indicate that, during this phase, noradrenaline may not be the neurotransmitter released in the ovarian compartment, but that other inhibitory molecules might participate in the observed effects. Finally, during D2, the neural input would condition the ovarian response to LH, facilitating the decrease in progesterone necessary to start a new cycle. The experimental scheme is, in our opinion, a valuable tool for the study of peripheral neural participation in ovarian physiology.", 
    "118": "Airway epithelial cells express beta(2)-adrenergic receptors (beta(2)-ARs), but their role in regulating airway responsiveness is unclear. With the Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP) promoter, we targeted expression of beta(2)-ARs to airway epithelium of transgenic (CCSP-beta(2)-AR) mice, thereby mimicking agonist activation of receptors only in these cells. In situ hybridization confirmed that transgene expression was confined to airway epithelium, and autoradiography showed that beta(2)-AR density in CCSP-beta(2)-AR mice was approximately twofold that of nontransgenic (NTG) mice. Airway responsiveness measured by whole body plethysmography showed that the methacholine dose required to increase enhanced pause to 200% of baseline (ED(200)) was greater for CCSP-beta(2)-AR than for NTG mice (345 +/- 34 vs. 157 +/- 14 mg/ml; P < 0.01). CCSP-beta(2)-AR mice were also less responsive to ozone (0.75 ppm for 4 h) because enhanced pause in NTG mice acutely increased to 77% over baseline (P < 0.05) but remained unchanged in the CCSP-beta(2)-AR mice. Although both groups were hyperreactive to methacholine 6 h after ozone exposure, the ED(200) for ozone-exposed CCSP-beta(2)-AR mice was equivalent to that for unexposed NTG mice. These findings show that epithelial cell beta(2)-ARs regulate airway responsiveness in vivo and that the bronchodilating effect of beta-agonists results from activation of receptors on both epithelial and smooth muscle cells.", 
    "119": "Hypo- and hyper-corticosteronisms have adverse effects on ovarian endocrine and exocrine functions. In the present study, the mechanism by which corticosterone in excess or insufficiency impairs steroidogenesis in granulosa and thecal cells was investigated in adult albino Wistar rats. In this regard, rats were administered with corticosterone-21-acetate (2 mg/100 g b.wt., s.c., twice daily) or metyrapone (11beta-hydroxylase blocker) (10 mg/100 g b.wt., s.c., twice daily) for 15 days and a group of corticosterone/metyrapone treated rats was withdrawn of treatment and maintained for another 15 days and killed during their diestrus phase. Administration of corticosterone-21-acetate while elevated the serum corticosterone levels, metyrapone diminished the same. Administration of metyrapone reduced the serum levels of LH and estradiol; corticosterone reduced the levels of FSH in addition to LH and estradiol. In vitro production of progesterone and estradiol by the granulosa and thecal cells was decreased due to altered corticosterone status. Whereas administration of corticosterone significantly reduced the activity of 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (3beta-HSD) in granulosa and thecal cells, it reduced the activity of 17beta-HSD only in granulosa cells. While metyrapone treatment reduced the activity of 17beta-HSD in granulosa as well as thecal cells, it reduced the activity of 3beta-HSD only in thecal cells. The findings of the present investigation clearly demonstrate that excess or insufficiency in corticosterone affects steroidogenic process in the ovary. This is achieved by decreasing the levels of gonadotropins probably by their diminished synthesis and secretion and by interfering at the signal transduction process of these gonadotropins.", 
    "120": "Using a number of agonist and antagonist compounds, we attempted to characterize the responses and receptors involved in the effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in the in situ blood perfused rat mesentery. An intra-arterial (i.a.) bolus injection of 5-HT increased mesenteric perfusion pressure in a dose-dependent way but did not change the systemic blood pressure. The selective 5-HT(2) receptor agonists alpha-methyl-5-HT, 1-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazine dihydrochloride (m-CPP) and (+/-)-1-(4-iodo-2, 5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-aminopropane hydrochloride (DOI), caused a local vasoconstrictor effect in the autoperfused vascular mesenteric bed. Intra-arterial injection of 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT) and 1-(m-chlorophenyl)-biguanide (m-CPBG) did not modify the mesenteric perfusion pressure. The vasoconstrictor effect elicited by 5-HT and alpha-methyl-5-HT was significantly decreased by ritanserin and by a selective 5-HT(2B/2C) receptor antagonist, N-3-pyridinyl-3, 5-dihydro-5-methyl-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']dipyrrole-1(2H)-carboxamide hydrochloride (SB 206553), but was not modified by prazosin, propranolol, indomethacin or enalapril pretreatment. Our data suggest that the vasoconstrictor serotonergic response induced in the in situ autoperfused rat mesenteric vascular bed is mainly mediated by activation of 5-HT(2B) and/or 5-HT(2C) receptors.", 
    "121": "Recent investigations have found that tetracyclic antidepressants like imipramine (IMP) have high-affinity sites not only in brain but also in mammalian lung. In the present study, we examined the effects of IMP on the Cl(-) secretion produced by isoproterenol (ISP), a beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) agonist, in Calu-3 human airway cells. ISP applied in the basolateral solution generated a sustained short-circuit current that was abolished by diphenylamine-2-carboxylate, a Cl(-) channel blocker. IMP (0.01-1 mM) applied in the apical or basolateral solution for 30 min significantly inhibited the ISP-induced responses in a concentration-dependent manner, and the inhibitory effects of this drug were remarkable when applied from the apical rather than the basolateral side. ISP-induced responses were mimicked by forskolin- and 8-bromo-cyclic AMP-induced ones, but which were insensitive to IMP. These results indicate that IMP desensitizes the beta-AR on the basolateral membrane from the cytosolic side in Calu-3 cells.",

    "123": "We recruited 168 patients with ischaemic or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, with complex ventricular arrhythmias. Patients able to tolerate low doses of carvedilol were randomized to treatment with carvedilol or placebo for 6 months. Carvedilol treatment improved ventricular function and reduced the incidence of arrhythmic episodes. Notably, by the end of the first month of treatment, the antiarrhythmic efficacy of the drug was significantly greater in patients with ischaemic than in those with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, an effect that could probably be attributed to the anti-ischaemic properties of carvedilol. After 3 months, at a time when ejection fraction was significantly improved in all treated patients, the antiarrhythmic efficacy of carvedilol was similar in the two study groups.", 
    "124": "Carvedilol antiarrhythmic efficacy was paralleled by the improvement in ejection fraction, independent of the aetiology of heart failure.

    "129": "The efficacy of atrial pacing in suppressing early reinitiation of atrial fibrillation was studied in 12 of 45 (29%) patients with early reinitiation of atrial fibrillation after successful cardioversion. These patients were randomized to undergo either repeated defibrillation alone or repeated defibrillation followed by high right atrial pacing at 500 ms in a crossover fashion. In patients with persistent early reinitiation of atrial fibrillation despite atrial pacing at 500 ms and repeated defibrillation, atrial pacing at 300 ms was tested. Lastly, if early reinitiation of atrial fibrillation persisted, administration of intravenous sotalol (1.5 mg. kg(-1)) was tested. Atrial pacing at 500 ms after defibrillation prevented early reinitiation of atrial fibrillation in five of 12 (42%) patients, and was significantly more effective than repeated defibrillation (0/9 patients, 0%, P<0.05). During atrial pacing at 500 ms, the density of atrial premature depolarizations (APDs) was significantly decreased (2.4+/-2.4 APDs. min(-1)vs 16.4+/-9.8 APDs. min(-1), P<0. 05) and the coupling interval of atrial premature depolarization was significantly increased (420+/-32 ms vs 398+/-19 ms, P<0.05) as compared to no pacing. In the remaining seven (58%) patients, atrial pacing at 500 ms failed to prevent early reinitiation of atrial fibrillation, but significantly decreased the density of atrial premature depolarization (3.4+/-2.4 APDs. min(-1)vs 14.2+/-4.8 APDs. min(-1), P<0.05) and delayed the onset of early reinitiation of atrial fibrillation (33+/-17s vs 11+/-11 s, P<0.05). Atrial pacing at 300 ms decreased the coupling interval of atrial premature depolarization as compared to no pacing and during atrial pacing at 500 ms (P<0.05), but without early reinitiation of atrial fibrillation suppression. Administration of intravenous sotalol was effective in preventing early reinitiation of atrial fibrillation in five of seven (71%) patients where pacing failed to suppress early reinitiation of atrial fibrillation.", 
    "130": "The results of this study suggest that atrial pacing can be useful when combined with transvenous defibrillation in patients with early reinitiation of atrial fibrillation.", 
    "131": "We have used the patch-clamp technique to study the effects of changing extracellular ATP concentration on the activity of the small-conductance potassium channel (SK) on the apical membrane of the mouse cortical collecting duct. In cell-attached patches, the channel conductance and kinetics were similar to its rat homologue. Addition of ATP to the bathing solution of split-open single cortical collecting ducts inhibited SK activity. The inhibition of the channel by ATP was reversible, concentration dependent (K(i) = 64 microM), and could be completely prevented by pretreatment with suramin, a specific purinergic receptor (P(2)) blocker. Ranking of the inhibitory potency of several nucleotides showed strong inhibition by ATP, UTP, and ATP-gamma-S, whereas alpha, beta-Me ATP, and 2-Mes ATP failed to affect channel activity. This nucleotide sensitivity is consistent with P(2)Y(2) purinergic receptors mediating the inhibition of SK by ATP. Single channel analysis further demonstrated that the inhibitory effects of ATP could be elicited through activation of apical receptors. Moreover, the observation that fluoride mimicked the inhibitory action of ATP suggests the activation of G proteins during purinergic receptor stimulation. Channel inhibition by ATP was not affected by blocking phospholipase C and protein kinase C. However, whereas cAMP prevented channel blocking by ATP, blocking protein kinase A failed to abolish the inhibitory effects of ATP. The reduction of K channel activity by ATP could be prevented by okadaic acid, an inhibitor of protein phosphatases, and KT5823, an agent that blocks protein kinase G. Moreover, the effect of ATP was mimicked by cGMP and blocked by L-NAME (N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester). We conclude that the inhibitory effect of ATP on the apical K channel is mediated by stimulation of P(2)Y(2) receptors and results from increasing dephosphorylation by enhancing PKG-sensitive phosphatase activity.", 
    "132": "The relative contributions of ANG II and bradykinin (BK) to the renal regional blood flow responses during angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition remain unclear. This study was performed to evaluate renal cortical (CBF) and medullary blood flow (MBF) responses to intrarterial administration of enalaprilat (33 microg. kg(-1). min (-1)) after blockade of the ANG II AT(1 )receptors with candesartan (100 microg) in 7 dogs fed a low-salt diet (0.01%) for 5 days. Laser-Doppler flowmetry was used to measure relative changes in CBF and MBF. Candesartan alone increased CBF (+20 +/- 2%) and MBF (+22 +/- 7%). Enalaprilat infusion after candesartan administration resulted in further increases in both CBF (+21 +/- 5%) and MBF (+41 +/- 8%). However, the relative changes in MBF were significantly greater (P < 0.01) than those in CBF. Administration of the BK B(2) receptor blocker icatibant (300 microg) after enalaprilat returned CBF and MBF to values seen with candesartan alone. These data support a substantive role for BK potentiation during ACE inhibitor-induced renal vasodilation in dogs maintained on a low-sodium diet, with a relatively greater effect on MBF compared to CBF.", 
    "133": "The binding site of 7-hydroxystaurosporine (UCN-01) on alpha-acid glycoprotein (AGP) was studied by fluorescence and ultracentrifugation experiments. Three ligands, propranolol, warfarin and progesterone were employed as marker ligands and quinaldine red was employed as a fluorescent probe. The presence of UCN-01, pro- pranolol, warfarin and progesterone resulted in a significant quenching of the fluorescence of quinaldine red, when bound to AGP, depending upon the potency of the binding to AGP. The construction of Klotz plots indicated that the displacement effects of propranolol, warfarin and progesterone on UCN-01-AGP binding were competitive in nature. These data suggest that the binding site of UCN-01 on the AGP partly overlaps the binding site for basic drugs, acidic drugs, as well as steroid hormones.", 
    "134": "The cytokine interleukin (IL)-1beta induces a biphasic effect in rat pancreatic islets, with an early and transitory stimulation of insulin release followed by progressive functional suppression. To clarify the mechanisms involved in these effects, we have recently performed a differential display of messenger RNA (mRNA) by RT-PCR (DDRT-PCR) on rat beta-cells exposed for 6 or 24 h to IL-1beta. Among the different IL-1beta-induced genes, there was an early and transient increase in phospholipase D-1 (PLD1) expression. PLD1 can induce phosphatidic acid formation and subsequent activation of protein kinase C, a process which stimulates insulin release. In the present study, we characterized the regulation of PLD isoforms by IL-1beta in pancreatic beta-cells. By using different combinations of primers and RT-PCR, we observed that IL-1beta induces an early increase (2 and 6 h) in the expression of both alternatively spliced isoforms of PLD1 (PLD1alpha and 1b). Prolonged exposure to IL-1beta (12 and 24 h) caused a decrease of PLD1a mRNA expression compared with control beta-cells, and lead to a return of PLD1b mRNA to basal level. NG-methyl-L-arginine (LMA), a blocker of the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), prevented this late inhibitory effect of IL-1beta, suggesting that IL-1beta-induced decrease in PLD1a expression is NO-mediated. IL-1beta induced an early (2-6 h) and sustained (16-24 h) increase in PLD1a mRNA expression in insulin-producing RINm5F cells. This was paralleled by a cytokine-induced increase in PLD1 protein expression and enzyme activity. RINm5F cells, but not primary beta-cells, expressed PLD2, and the expression of this gene was not affected by IL-1beta. In conclusion, we have shown that the cytokine IL-1beta regulates PLD1 expression in primary and clonal beta-cells. The early induction of PLD1 probably contributes to the early stimulatory effects of IL-1beta on islet insulin release.", 
    "135": "Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a CRF secretagogue for human placental cells in culture. We have studied the involvement of intracellular calcium and calcium-dependent signaling in the NPY-induced CRF release in trophoblastic cells. The incubation of trophoblasts with NPY for 3 and 8 h led to a dose-dependent increase in CRF secretion. Also, NPY stimulated synthesis of this peptide hormone upon an 8-h incubation period. BIBP3226, a selective Y1 receptor antagonist, and pertussis toxin (PTX) eliminated these effects. NPY-stimulated CRF secretion was mostly prevented by loading cells with BAPTA-AM, suggesting that elevation of intracellular calcium is responsible for the increase of CRF secretion. However, this calcium chelator had no effect on CRF synthesis. Furthermore, U-73122, a phospholipase C-betas (PLC) inhibitor or xestospongin C, an inositol triphosphate receptor (InsP3-R) blocker, have partially prevented the effect of NPY on CRF synthesis and secretion. Therefore, the increase in CRF synthesis and secretion rely in part on the release of calcium from intracellular store. Interestingly, SKF 96365, an inhibitor of store operated calcium (SOC) influx, also partially blocked the NPY stimulatory effect on CRF release but not its synthesis, suggesting that calcium influx is also involved in this stimulation. In the syncytiotrophoblast, known to possess a NPY-activated protein kinase C (PKCs) activity, NPY also stimulated calcium calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) and extracellular regulated kinase (ERK1/2) activities. In the present study, we observed that bisindolylmaleimide (BIM), a nonspecific PKCs inhibitor partially prevented the NPY-induced CRF release. On the other hand, autocamtide-2 related inhibitory peptide (AIP), a CaMKII inhibitor, prevented most of the stimulatory effect of NPY on both CRF synthesis and release. Go6976, an inhibitor of the conventional and mu PKCs and PD 098059, an inhibitor of the ERK cascade, had no effect on neither CRF synthesis nor release. Altogether, these results support a Y1 receptor-mediated PTX-sensitive induction on CRF synthesis and release by NPY from human placental trophoblasts. The stimulation of CRF synthesis by NPY seems to depend mainly on a PLC-beta to InsP3-R axis and on CaMKII activity. Also, the release of CRF depends on the PLC-beta to InsP3-R axis and CaMKII activity but also entails the participation of a calcium-independent PKCs.",

    "137": "One hundred and six patients (57 men, mean age 40.8 [SD 6.6] years) never treated with antihypertensive treatment were included. At the beginning and after one year, blood pressure biochemical profile and urinary albumin excretion (UAE) were measured. After the initial evaluation, 53 patients received angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and 53 beta-blockers (BB). Hydrochlorothiazide was added to achieve the blood pressure target < 140/90 mmHg.", 
    "138": "The average of UAE was 32.1 (43.1) mg/24 h, and 41 (39%) patients had microalbuminuretics. After 12 months of treatment, a significative fall of systolic BP (-20.6 [8.03] mmHg, p < 0.001), and diastolic BP (-14.18 [10.34] mmHg, p < 0.001) were observed, whereas baseline glucose increases (3.08 [11.07] mg/dl, p = 0.006). The changes of UAE were only related with the baseline UAE values. Neither, age, sex, baseline diastolic BP and changes in diastolic BP were significantly related with the changes in UAE. In spite of similar mean BP reduction (medial BP 17.4 [10.9] vs 14.8 [10.4] mmHg), UAE only was reduced in patients treated with ACEi (LogUAE: 0.203 [0.872] mg/24 h; p < 0.04). In addition, in patients treated with BB a significative increase in baseline glucose (4.4 [12.3] mg/dl; p = 0.013) and uric acid (1.18 [4.18]; p = 0.031) were observed.",

    "140": "Sudden cardiac death remains a leading cause of death in the United States. It is usually due to ventricular arrhythmia, either ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. The probability of life threatening ventricular arrhythmia correlates closely with underlying structural heart disease. In any patient presenting with a ventricular arrhythmia, a careful search for underlying causes is required, and treatment should be considered primarily if it will prolong survival. Treatment of patients without underlying heart disease who are experiencing ventricular ectopy, and/or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, consists of reassurance and education. If symptoms are severe, a beta-blocker is an appropriate choice for drug treatment. Patients with ventricular arrhythmia and structural heart disease are generally best managed in conjunction with a cardiologist.",

Class I indications for the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors during acute myocardial infarction are (1) patients within the first 24 hours of onset of a suspected acute myocardial infarction with ST segment elevation in two or more anterior precordial leads or with clinical heart failure in the absence of significant hypotension or contraindications to the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, (2) patients with myocardial infarction and a left ventricular ejection fraction of less then 40%, (3) and patients with clinical heart failure on the basis of systolic pump dysfunction during and after convalescence from acute myocardial infarction.

He was treated with nitrates, heparin, beta-blockade and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Because of the presence of some blood while vomiting no thrombolysis was given and abdominal echography was performed. This revealed a nodular mass at the right adrenal gland. Urinary catecholamines and abdominal magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the suspected diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. Before adrenectomy, a coronary angiography under alpha blocker therapy was performed, which demonstrated no significant coronary artery disease, although the patient showed ST-elevations on ECG. Pathological examination of the adrenal tumor was compatible with a diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. Postoperatively urinary catecholamines dropped dramatically, and the ECG normalised slowly over time. After 8 months the patient is still well. Blood pressure is well controlled with no antihypertensive drugs and exercise testing shows no evidence of myocardial ischaemia.", 
    "144": "Ultrasound examinations of the heart and major peripheral arteries have been performed as separate procedures; both potentially limited by suboptimal views in certain subjects and the inability to obtain ideal pictures of particular intracardiac structures. Transvenous ultrasound may offer new advantages in certain areas, we therefore studied six adult baboons using a single-plane 5.5-10 MHz transducer mounted on a 10 French (10F) catheter, introduced via the right femoral vein and positioned under fluoroscopic control. Imaging and Doppler studies were performed to delineate cardiovascular anatomy as well as ventricular function response to positive (dobutamine) and negative inotropic (esmolol) agents. The procedure was safe and feasible in all cases. Clear and novel two-dimensional and flow information were obtained from the iliac arteries, descending aorta, both renal artery origins, ascending aorta, including the aortic arch, main pulmonary artery and its bifurcation, as well as head and neck vessels. Novel intracardiac views were obtained, including right ventricular long axis, left ventricular apex and 'flask' views of the left ventricle. Excellent dynamic information for left ventricular function was also available [e.g. myocardial Vmax of the anterior left ventricular wall was 6.8+/-2.5 cm/s at rest, 14.6+/-5.5 cm/s after dobutamine (P=0.009) and 4.5+/-1 cm/s after esmolol (P=0.03 compared with control)]. We conclude that, in adult primates, transvenous ultrasound safely and reliably provides novel information of cardiovascular structure and function.",

Several recent studies have shown that silent myocardial ischaemia (SMI) is a common manifestation of CAD, especially in the elderly. As many as 40% of elderly patients with no prior history of CAD may have underlying asymptomatic disease and up to 50% of elderly patients with known CAD might have evidence of SMI. The results of studies in elderly patients with CAD have also shown that SMI might exist despite antianginal therapy that is considered adequate for symptom control. In order to diagnose such residual SMI, the clinician would need to perform 24- to 48-hour Holter monitoring in the ambulatory setting while the patient is performing routine daily activities. Although a number of anti-ischaemic drugs have been evaluated for the treatment of SMI, available data suggest that beta-blocker given alone or in combination with a nitrate compound or calcium antagonist provides the best therapeutic choice. The long term benefit of SMI suppression in elderly patients has not been established. Future studies need to evaluate the clinical benefits of therapy given for SMI in the elderly.",

    "159": "We previously reported that nicotine-induced nitric oxide (NO)-mediated cerebral neurogenic vasodilation was dependent on intact sympathetic innervation. We hypothesized that nicotine acted on sympathetic nerve terminals to release norepinephrine (NE), which then acted on adrenoceptors located on the neighboring nitric oxidergic (NOergic) nerve terminals to release NO, resulting in vasodilation. The adrenoceptor subtype in mediating nicotine-induced vasodilation in isolated porcine basilar arterial rings denuded of endothelium was therefore examined pharmacologically and immunohistochemically. Results from using an in vitro tissue bath technique indicated that propranolol and preferential beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonists (ICI-118,551 and butoxamine), in a concentration-dependent manner, blocked the relaxation induced by nicotine (100 microM) without affecting the relaxation elicited by transmural nerve stimulation (TNS, 8 Hz). In contrast, preferential beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists (atenolol and CGP-20712A) did not affect either nicotine- or TNS-induced relaxation. Results of double-labeling studies indicated that beta(2)-adrenoceptor immunoreactivities and NADPH diaphorase reactivities were colocalized in the same nerve fibers in basilar and middle cerebral arteries. These findings suggest that NE, which is released from sympathetic nerves upon application of nicotine, acts on presynaptic beta(2)-adrenoceptors located on the NOergic nerve terminals to release NO, resulting in vasodilation. In addition, nicotine-induced relaxation was enhanced by yohimbine, an alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist, which, however, did not affect the relaxation elicited by TNS. Prazosin, an alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, on the other hand, did not have any effect on relaxation induced by either nicotine or TNS. The predominant facilitatory effect of beta(2)-adrenoceptors in releasing NO may be compromised by presynaptic alpha(2)-adrenoceptors.", 
    "160": "We developed a technology for heart rate (HR) variability (HRV) analysis in the mouse for characterization of HR dynamics, modulated by vagal and sympathetic activity. The mouse is the principal animal model for studying biological processes. Mouse strains are now available harboring gene mutations providing fundamental insights into molecular mechanisms underlying cardiac electrical diseases. Future progress depends on enhanced understanding of these fundamental mechanisms and the implementation of methods for the functional analysis of mouse cardiovascular physiology. By telemetric techniques, standard time and frequency-domain measures of HRV were computed with and without autonomic blockade, and baroreflex sensitivity testing was performed. HR modulation in the high-frequency component is predominantly mediated by the parasympathetic nervous system, whereas the low-frequency component is under the influence of both the parasympathetic and sympathetic systems. The presented technology and protocol allow for assessment of autonomic regulation of the murine HR. Phenotypic screening for HR regulation in mice will further enhance the value of the mouse as a model of heritable electrophysiological human disease.",

At follow-up, one third of the patients had blood pressure values similar to those before active treatment. The reason for this is unclear, but inconsistent compliance may play a part in the lack of durability of the improvements. Our results indicate that effects seen in short-term clinical trials may not translate to long-term benefits in clinical practice."
