    "0": "The hypotensive mechanisms of pindolol in anesthetized and conscious rats were investigated. Pindolol caused a fall in blood pressure in anesthetized, conscious and spinal rats, though in conscious rats a higher dose of the drug was required to produce such a response. This hypotension with pindolol in anesthetized and conscious rats was markedly inhibited by pretreatment with the drug itself or other beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs. A similar phenomenon also occurred when isoproterenol was injected intravenously in anesthetized and conscious rats. The relationship between the hypotensive actions of four beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs in anesthetized rats and their intrinsic beta-sympathomimetic actions in isolated catecholamine-depleted tracheal preparations was determined. Order of hypotensive potencies was the same as that of their intrinsic beta-sympathomimetic action, namely, pindolol greater than carteolol greater than bufetolol in equilibrium propranolol (p less than 0.05). These results suggest that the hypotension with pindolol is mediated through a decrease in the peripheral vascular resistance due to an intrinsic beta-sympathomimetic action of the drug.", 
    "1": "Effects of a newly synthesized beta-blocker, 5-(3-tert-butylamino-2-hydroxy) propoxy-3,4-dihydrocarbostyril (OPC-1085) were compared with those of propranolol. OPC-1085 had a potency about 3 times greater than that of propranolol in blocking the positive inotropic and chronotropic effects of isoprenaline on the isolated guinea pig atrium. At a concentration of over 3 X 10(-5) M OPC-1085 produced negative inotropic and chronotropic effects. However, these effects were about 10 times weaker than those of propranolol. Suppressing effects on the rate of rise and on the maximum driving frequency of action potentials were also more than 10 times less than those of propranolol. There was almost no change in the action potential of vagus nerve after a 10 min treatment with OPC-1085 (10(-5) M), while the action potential was reduced to 60-70% with propranolol (10(-5) M).", 
    "2": "1 The beta-adrenoceptor blocking effects of penbutolol were compared with those of propranolol and a placebo in a double-blind trial involving six healthy volunteers. 2 Heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) were measured at rest and during vigorous exercise before and at intervals up to 7 h after oral administration of the drugs. In addition, plasma renin activity (PRA) at rest and plasma levels of penbutolol and propranolol were determined. 3 Penbutolol proved to be a non-cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug, antagonizing exercise-induced tachycardia, reducing exercise-induced increase in PEFR and decreasing PRA. The beta-adrenolytic potency of penbutolol was shown to be four-fold that of propranolol but the duration of its effect was similar. 4 The peak plasma level of penbutolol was reached 1 h after administration and its half-life was 4.5 h. 5 Comparison of plasma levels and biological activity of penbutolol revealed that after oral administration this drug is transformed into an active metabolite in man.", 
    "3": "Propranolol (1-isopropylamino-3-(1-naphtoloxy)-propan-2-ol) a beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent was found to cause changes of transmembraneous pH in liposomes prepared from Soy-lecithin and cardiolipin. When the external pH was neutral and the internum of the liposomes acidic, the drug decreased the pH gradient. When the externum was acidic and the internum neutral, the gradient was increased by the drug. The effect of butacaine was similar to that of propranolol, while procaine, timolol and practolol were ineffective. It is suggested that the charged form of propranolol is bound to the membrane and dislocates protons from binding sites in the membrane and that the uncharged form of propranolol penetrates the membrane. After penetration it could associate with protons in the intraliposomal compartment and hence increase the pH of the interior. Depending on the direction of the pre-existing proton gradient propranolol would thus be able to increase or decrease the pH difference across the liposomal membrane.", 
    "4": "The authors report results of a series of thirty four cases of algo-neuro-dystrophy treated with beta blockers. This treatment produced favorable results in thirty out of the thirty four cases and the mode of action is discussed.", 
    "5": "1. The competitive alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent labetalol, in concentrations up to 10(-4) M, produced dose-dependent increases in transmitter overflow from the isolated blood perfused spleen of the cat following nerve stimulation at 10 and 30 Hz. 2. At concentrations above 10(-4) M labetol produced a pronounced decrease in transmitter overflow. 3. Labetalol (1.5 X 10(-4) M) increased the recovery of 3H label in the venous blood following the close-arterial infusion of [3H]-(-)-noradrenaline indicating that the drug inhibits uptake of the amine. 4. Both labetalol (3.8 X 10(-5) M) and piperoxan (7.4 X 10(-6) M) produced parallel shifts to the right of the dose-response curves to noradrenaline and oxymetazoline in isolated strips of cat splenic capsule. In this preparation both drugs acted as competitive postsynaptic alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agents. 5. Labetalol (3.3 X 10(-5) M) increased the transmitter overflow following stimulation of the splenic nerves with 200 impulses at 10 Hz. The overflow could be further increased by subsequent addition of piperoxan (7.2 X 10(-6 M). Piperoxan (5.7 X 10(-6) M) alone produced a marked increase in transmitter overflow which could be further increased by subsequent addition of desmethylimipramine (DMI; 3.2 X 10(-5) M). Cocaine (1.5 X 10(-5) M) or DMI (5.4 X 10(-5 M) produced a small increase in transmitter overflow which was not further increased by addition of labetalol (2.8 X 10(-5) M). 6. Labetalol produced a biphasic effect on the responses of the isolated blood perfused spleen of the cat to nerve stimulation. With low doses (up to 10(-4) M) vascular responses were potentiated and with high doses (greater than 10(-4) M) inhibited. The potentiation was related to uptake blockade and the inhibition to decreased transmitter overflow and postsynaptic alpha-adrenoceptor blockade. 7. Labetalol appears to act as a postsynaptic alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist in the isolated blood perfused spleen of the cat with little effect on presynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors. The moderate elevation of transmitter overflow by the drug is related to the inhibitory effect of the drug on neuronal uptake rather than on presynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors.", 
    "6": "1. The technique of microelectrophoresis was used to compare the actions of a range of adrenoceptor agonists on single cortical neurones in the rat anaesthetized with halothane. 2. Phenylephrine and methoxamine were exclusively excitatory, whereas salbutamol was entirely depressant. Noradrenaline and isoprenaline could evoke both excitatory and depressant responses. Lower doses of isoprenaline usually evoked depressions, whereas higher doses, on the same cell, evoked excitatory responses. 3. The alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agents, phentolamine and phenoxybenzamine, reversibly antagonized excitatory responses to adrenoceptor agonists, without affecting depressant responses to adrenoceptor agonists or excitatory responses to acetylcholine. 4. The beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents, propranolol and sotalol, reversibly antagonized both depressant and excitatory responses to adrenoceptor agonists, without affecting responses to acetylcholine. When the effect of sotalol on excitatory and depressant responses to adrenoceptor agonists was compared on the same cell, the depressant responses could be selectively antagonized, without affecting the excitatory responses. 5. It is concluded that (a) responses of cortical neurones to adrenoceptor agonists are mediated by both alpha- and beta-receptors; (b) these alpha- and beta-receptors give rise to opposite effects: the alpha-receptors being excitatory and the beta-receptors being inhibitory; and (c) responses of many neurones reflect the presence of both types of receptor.", 
    "7": "A series of bis(2-hydroxy-3-isopropylaminopropyl) ethers of nuclear-substituted catechols (1-7) has been synthesized and examined in vitro for beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity, antagonism of ouabain-induced arrhythmias, and local anesthetic activity. Both tracheal and right atrial beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity are markedly decreased by alkyl substitution in position 3 of parent catechol diether 1. Substitution in position 4 still lowers the affinity to cardiac arrhythmias and local anesthetic activity increases with introduction of alkyl substituents in the 3 as well as in the 4 position. In contrast with biological activities, the partition coefficient 1-octanol-phosphate buffer, pH 7.40, of 1 did not change significantly by 3- and 4-methyl substitution. Stepwise multiple regression analyses were performed using log P or pi values in combination with pKa(m), E8, or sigma. With cardiac beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity the optimal equation contained E8 and pi parameters, tracheal activity appeared to depend mainly on the E8 parameter, whereas for antiarrhythmic and local anesthetic activities the lipophilicity of the substituents appeared to be the determinant factor.", 
    "8": "Plasma levels of penbutolol (HOE 893d) were determined in eight healthy adult male subjects after oral administration of 50-mg capsules. Fast absorpiton of the drug from the gastrointestinal tract was indicated by the rapid increase in plasma levels during the absorption phase, with a peak time at about 1 hour after dosing in all subjects. After the peak level, plasma concentrations declined biexponentially, with an average half-life of 2.5 and 27 hours for the fast and slow disposition phases, respectively. These values were in good agreement with data previously found for this drug. Cumulative excretion of intact drug in the urine of the eight subjects during 72 hours after dosing was less than 4 per cent, except for one subject who excreted 9.82 per cent of the dose. Large individual variations were found for area under the plasma level curves, disposition rates, and amounts of intact drug excreted in the urine. Significant pharmacologic effects were noted in all eight subjects at the 50-mg dose level, and mild side effects were evident in one half of these subjects. The average drop in blood pressure and pulse rate for all subjects was 26/18 mm Hg and 19 beats per minute, respectively.", 
    "9": "Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) manifest growth failure which may antecede abdominal symptoms by some years. Eight of ten children with documented IBD had records of decreasing growth velocities. Investigation of growth hormone reserves showed excessive rather than impaired responses. Mean basal GH level was 6.2 +/- 0.75 (SEM) ng/ml. During sleep, the mean GH level rose to 26.0 +/- 4.7 ng/ml and following propranolol-glucagon stimulation, to 46.0 +/- 4.5 ng/ml. All values were significantly higher than levels obtained in a control population of 25 children investigated for short stature who were not GH deficient. The mean peak GH response following insulin in the IBD group (10.8 +/- 3.8 ng/ml), however, did not differ from the mean peak response in the control group (13.5 +/- 3.3 ng/ml). Growth failure in patients with IBD is not the result of GH deficiency and is not an irreversible phenomenon. On the contrary, judicious use of glucocorticoids aimed at the control of the disease usually produces compensatory growth acceleration (\"catch-up growth\").", 
    "10": "We studied the autonomic control of resting heart rate of systemic and pulmonary vascular blood pressures (BP) in chronically instrumented neonatal lambs 1-8 weeks of age. The maximum response to ganglionic blockade and sympathetic and parasympathetic antagonists was taken as an index of the magnitude of the total neural, adrenergic, and cholinergic tones. The reactivity of the circulatory parameters to adrenergic and cholinergic agonists also was investigated. All findings were compared with those in adult nonpregnant sheep studied concomitantly and with data previously obtained from term fetal lambs. The results of our studies show: (1) resting heart rate declines spontaneously throughout the 8 weeks of neonatal life approaching that of adult sheep; (2) the progressive bradycardia is not related to changes in the parasympathetic or sympathetic tone; (3) resting systemic BP is under strong neurohumoral control during the first two to three weeks of neonatal life; the control decreases progressively, becoming similar to that of adult sheep; (4) resting pulmonary artery pressure of neonatal and adult sheep has no neurohumoral control; (5) the systemic BP response of the neonate to autonomic agonists is greater than that of the term fetus and is similar to that of the adult; (6) in neonatal and adult sheep, compared to the term fetus, the pressor response to norepinephrine is accompanied by a baroreceptor-mediated bradycardia, and acetylcholine-induced systemci hypotension is accompanied by a \"paradoxical\" tachycardia mediated through beta-adrenergic stimulation; (7) in contrast to our finding for the fetus, the pulmonary vascular pressure of neonatal and adult sheep is unresponsive to autonomic agonists.", 
    "11": "We determined age-related differences in automaticity and responsiveness of cardiac Purkinje fibers from adult and neonatal dogs to graded concentrations of epinephrine, isoproterenol, and phenylephrine. Purkinje fibers were studied with standard microelectrode techniques during superfusion with Tyrode's solution at 37 degrees C. Control spontaneous rates for adults and neonates did not differ significantly. There was a biphasic response to all agonists such that rate decreased at low and increased at high concentrations. The decrease was greater with phenylephrine and epinephrine than with isoproterenol. The increase in rate was greater with isoproterenol and epinephrine than with phenylephrine. Propranolol shifted the dose-response curves downward and to the right for all agonists; phentolamine, shifter the curves upward and to the left. Epinephrine and isoproterenol dose-response curves for the neonates were upward and to the left of those for adults. Phenylephrine curves were identical for adults and neonates. Thus there are alpha- and beta-adrenergic effects on Purkinje fiber automaticity; the former decrease and the latter increase rate. Furthermore, the effects on automiticity of beta-adrenergic amines are greater in the neonates than in the adult.", 
    "12": "The utility of using beta blocking drugs, specifically Pindolol, as a prophylaxis for arrhythmia during cardiac microcatheterism according to Grandjean's technique has been observed. The drug is even more useful when it is considered that it does not affect dp/dt value.", 
    "13": "Some aspects of bronchomotricity in bronchial asthma, with special emphasis on pharmacological and immunological data, are presented. Personal results on beta-adrenergic blockade and stimulation on simultaneous administration of histamine and beta-blocking and stimulating drugs and on the correlation between immunological factors as immunoglobulin IgE concentration, histamine binding power and alpha-1-antitrypsine deficiency and bronchial asthma are presented and discussed.", 
    "14": "To investigate the possible interaction of a beta adrenergic blocking agent and marihuana, six healthy experienced marihuana smokers received the two drugs separately and in combination. Propranolol (120 mg per os) reduced resting HR and BP; there were no changes in performance on tasks designed to test psychomotor speed, attention, memory and learning. Marihuana (10 mg delta9-THC), administered in smoke, induced the typical subjective state (\"high\") with marked increases in HR, BP and conjunctival injection; it impaired performance on a learning test without significantly affecting attention. Pre-treatment with propranolol blocked effectively the cardiovascular effects of marihuana; it prevented the learning impairment and, to a lesser degree, the characteristic subjective experience.", 
    "15": "3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA) were measured in the corpus striatum, nucleus accumbens and tuberculum olfactorium of the rat brain, 4 antidepressants, 4 anesthetics, dipropylacetate, ethosuximide and metoclopramide induced a rise of DOPAC and HVA levels in the 3 brain regions. No change was observed after carbamazepine, diazepam or propranolol treatment. Combined treatment with a maximally effective dose of haloperidol and morphine, oxotremorine or probenecid produced an additional rise of DOPAC and HVA levels, while no additional rise was seen with chloral hydrate, chlorimipramine, ether, halothane, metoclopramide or sulpiride. The potency of drugs to increase DA metabolism in corpus striatum relative to mesolimbic structures was estimated. Atypical neuroleptics such as sulpiride could be differentiated in this respect from classical neuroleptics such as chlorpromazine, fluphenazine and thioridazine, by their ability to produce a relatively large increase of metabolite levels in the mesolimbic regions. The heterogeneous group of 14 non-neuroleptics however produced regional changes which were very similar to those of the atypical neuroleptics. DA metabolism in mesolimbic regions, in contrast to striatal tissue, seems to respond more to atypical neuroleptics and non-neuroleptics than to typical neuroleptics.", 
    "16": "The effect of harmaline (HME) was analyzed in rat atrial strips superfused in vitro. A dual inotropic action was found: the positive component was due to a transient catechol-mediated enhancement of the velocity of development of tension (dT/dt) and to a prolongation of the duration of the rising phase of the contraction (TPT). The negative component was due to a depression of dT/dt, which overcame the persistent TPT-prolonging effect of HME, and it was abolished by rising the [K]0. It is concluded that: (1) the positive inotropic effect of HME depends on its actions on the dT/dt and TPT; (2) the enhancement of dT/dt is due to an adrenergic mechanism, which stimulates the Ca2+-dependent slowly activated current (Is); (3) a negative inotropic effect becomes evident whenever the dT/dt is depressed by the drug, regardless of the persistence of the TPT-prolonging effect; (4) the depression of the dT/dt is not due to an inhibition of Is.", 
    "17": "The investigation of 3 day old notochords by the fluorescence method of Falck and Owman showed an increase of the fluorescence after treatment of the chick embryos at 48 hrs of incubation, with nicotine sulfate or carbachol. The addition of norepinephrine or L-Dopa emphasized the formaldehyde induced fluorescence. The simultaneous treatment with a cholinergic agent and atropine, propranolol or reserpine decreased or suppressed the fluorescence. These results demonstrate the existence of a relationship between the treatment with a cholinergic agent and the amount of chordal biogenic amines.", 
    "18": "The effect of several \"membrane stabilizing\" agents was examined on spontaneously occurring frog miniature end-plate potentials (MEPPs). No consistent parallel was observed between the ability of agents to act as \"membrane stabilizers\" and their ability to alter MEPP frequency, Vinblastine, chlorpromazine and haloperidol increased MEPP frequency; the concentration of haloperidol which increased MEPP frequency consistently reduced the magnitude of the muscle resting membrane potential. Strychnine, methoxyflurane and practolol decreased MEPP frequency. Similarly, there was no consistent pattern of drug effects on the mean quantal content m of the end-plate potential. Chlorpromazine did not change m, and it is known that vinblastine does not influence m. Strychnine, methoxyflurane, haloperidol and practolol brought about a decline in m.", 
    "19": "A correlation study between the antihypertensive effect and the plasma level of pindolol was performed in 10 patients with permanent essential hypertension. Pindolol was given orally (20 mg/day) during 9 days. The highly significant fall in blood pressure (delta SBP and delta DBP) is directly correlated negatively correlated, to the pretreatment pressure (p less than 0.02 for deltaSBP and p less than 0.05 deltaDBP) and negatively correlated to the pindolol plasma level (P less than 0.001 for delta SBP and p less than 0.05 for delta DBP). Multiple regression analysis shows, for delta SBP, a stronger influence of plasma level than of basal blood pressure. These results suggest that pindolol could have a specific effect in some hypertensive patients.", 
    "20": "The effects of insulin on myocardial contractility (MC) and metabolism were studied in 18 newborn lambs. Cardiac work and rate were kept constant. Following insulin (80 units, intravenously), contractility increased and remained elevated for 1 hour. This was not prevented by beta blockade or glucose infusion. Myocardial extraction and uptake of glucose and nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) increased, the arterial concentration of both decreased. But after glucose fell to less than 20 per cent of control, uptake of both glucose and NEFA declined as did MC. It is concluded that in the neonate insulin increases MC as well as substrate uptake.", 
    "21": "The effects on the firing of single dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra (and adjacent ventral tegmental area) of a representative group of catecholamine agonists and antagonists were studied in rats using single cell recording and microiontophoretic techniques. Microiontophoretic application of DA or the DA agonist apomorphine depressed the firing of these cells; the DA antagonist trifluoperazine blocked this effect. However, the alpha-agonist clonidine had no depressant effect and the beta-agonist isoproteronol had only a weak depressant action on DA neurons. Furthermore, the alpha-antagonist piperoxane and the beta-antagonist sotolol were completely ineffective in blocking the depressant effects of DA. These results show that DA-sensitive receptors on the soma of DA neurons are pharmacologically distinct from alpha or beta adrenoreceptors. Because of their location and selective responsiveness to DA agonists, the catecholamine receptors on the soma of DA neurons appear best classified as DA \"autoreceptors\".", 
    "22": "Effects of sympathomimetic amines without and with alpha and beta-adrenergic blocking agents on the heart rate and arterial and venous blood pressures in the 3-day-old chick embryo were studied. No chronotropic effect was observed. Norepinephrine caused a biphasic change in systolic and diastolic arterial pressures, the lower doses effecting a fall, and the higher doses a rise in these pressures. With phenylephrine a sharp rise in systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressures was seen. Isoproterenol caused a dramatic fall in systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressures. In the presence of phenoxybenzamine, the pressor effect of high doses of norepinephrine was reversed, the pressor effect of phenylephrine was abolished, and the hypotension with isoproterenol was enhanced. After propranolol, the hypotensive effect of low doses of norepinephrine was reversed, the pressor response to phenylephrine was unchanged, and the depressor effect of isoproterenol was abolished. These findings suggest the presence of functioning alpha- and beta-receptors in the 3-day-old chick embryo. Additionally, they suggest that the alpha-receptors develop more slowly in the chick embryo.", 
    "23": "Sixteen patients with essentialy hypertension were treated with propranolol 160 to 640 mg daily for three months. Significant decreases both in recumbent and standing blood pressure were observed after three days treatment and subsequently. Reduction of blood pressure was more pronounced when the dose of propranolol was increased. However, neither the mean dose nor the plasma concentration of propranolol could be correlated with the mean decrease in blood pressure. There was great interindividual variation in the plasma concentrations of propranolol produced by the same daily dose. The initial stimulation of plasma renin activity and the therapeutic response to propranolol could not be correlated.", 
    "24": "The efficacy and toxicity of tolamolol and methyldopa in hypertensive patients has been compared by a dose-titrated, double-blind, cross-over study. Thirteen patients completed the trial. Within the dose ranges investigated (tolamolol - 300 mg/day - 900 mg/day; methyldopa - 750 mg/day - 2250 mg/day)both drugs produced significant falls in laying and standing, systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Although the hypotensive effects of methyldopa were more marked than tolamolol, these only achieved conventional (P less than 0.05) levels of significance for lying blood pressure. There were no objective changes in haematological or biochemical indices during treatment with either drug, but patients complained of tiredness, weak limbs and mouth dryness significantly more during methyldopa treatment, than during either placebo or tolamolol therapy.", 
    "25": "The authors review the literature on the undesirable side effects of beta blockaders (excluding the cardiovascular system) and report the new therapeutic propects in psychiatry and in various metabolic disorders. The necessity of sufficient follow up made us choose propanolol as reference product without neglecting acebutolol, pindolol and oxprenolol.", 
    "26": "The anticonvulsant activity of propranolol and two selected metabolites, propranolol glycol and N-desisopropylpropranolol were compared in mice against 4 types of experimentally induced seizures: pentylenetetrazol, strychnine, low frequency and maximal electroshock. Both metabolites possessed significant anticonvulsant activity with propranolol glycol being 1/2 to 1/3 as potent and N-desisopropylpropranolol being 1/6 as potent as propranolol. The possible contribution of these two active metabolites to the acute anticonvulsant efficacy of propranolol was assessed in time course studies. Maximal anticonvulsant activity occurred between 2.5--10 min after propranolol (5-20 mg/kg, i.v.) and was significantly diminished after 30 min. Following propranolol, brain levels of both metabolites were extremely low ( less than 10 ng/g) at the onset of anticonvulsant action and reached peak levels between 15-30 min at which time anticonvulsant activity was already declining. In contrast, brain levels of propranolol were similar in time course to that observed for its anticonvulsant effect and there was significant positive correlation between these two parameters in 3 of the 4 seizure models. These data indicate that although these two metabolites are pharmacologically active, they do not contribute significantly to the acute anticonvulsant actions observed after propranolol administration.", 
    "27": "The effects of i.v. and intracoronary (i.c.) nitroglycerin, i.v. propranolol, and the combination of propranolol and nitroglycerin on myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2) and lactate utilization were studied in situ ischemic working dog hearts. I.v. nitroglycerin reduced MVO2 9% which was associated with the peripheral vasodilatory actions of the drug. I.c. nitroglycerin which had no detectable effects on the peripheral vasculature had no significant effect on MVO2. I.v. propranolol caused an 8% reduction in MVO2 and this action was associated with a negative chronotropic and a slight negative inotropic effect. However, the combination of propranolol and nitroglycerin which was more effective than either drug alone, reduced MVO2 18% thereby indicating that the effects of the two drugs on oxygen consumption are additive. These results support the concept that the reduction of MVO2 seen with nitroglycerin is principally due to peripheral vasodilatory actions of the drug while that seen with propranolol is due to that drug's effect on the heart and the effects of the two agents are complementary.", 
    "28": "The effect of atrioventricular (A-V) conduction of N6-2'-0-dibutyryl cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (dibutyryl cyclic AMP) was investigated in comparison with those of norepinephrine, cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP), adenosine-5'-monophosphate (5'-AMP), and adenosine by the use of the isolated, blood-perfused A-V node preparation of the dog. Single injections of dibutyryl cyclic AMP (3-300 micronmol) and norepinephrine (0.1-1 nmol) into the posterior septal artery of the preparation (the upper part of the A-V node is mainly perfused through this artery) produced a dose-dependent decrease in the A-V conduction time. The time to the peak effect and the duration of the effect of dibutyryl cyclic AMP were much longer than with norepinephrine. The positive dromotropic effect of dibutyryl cyclic AMP was resistant to the beta-adrenoceptor blocking action of propranolol. Unlike dibutyryl cyclic AMP, cyclic AMP (above 30 nmol), 5'-AMP and adenosine (above 1 nmol) injected into the posterior septal artery prolonged the A-V conduction time in a dose-dependent manner. The results indicate that dibutyryl cyclic AMP has a mode of action on A-V nodal cells which differs distinctly from that of either norepinephrine or cyclic AMP, 5'-AMP, and adenosine.", 
    "29": "Hypoglycemia developed in fasted rats during forced swimming. This hypoglycemia was mostly abolished by phentolamine, an alpha-adrenolytic agent, or by hexamethonium; was potentiated by propranolol, a beta-adrenolytic agent, of by 5-methoxyindole-2-carboxylic acid, a gluconeogenic inhibitor; and was not affected by anti-insulin serum. The turnover rate of blood glucose estimated from the decay curve of blood [14C]glucose increased significantly during exercise. There was a slight but significantly increase during exercise in the transfer of 3-O-methyl-[14C]glucose into muscle and adipose tissues, when it was corrected for by [3H]mannitol transfer to the same tissues. It is concluded that the alpha-receptor-mediated action of endogenous catecholamine stimulates peripheral glucose utilization leading to hypoglycemia during exercise. The action of alpha- and beta-adrenergic mechanisms, directly on peripheral tissues or via insulin secretion, in fine regulation of blood glucose level is discussed.", 
    "30": "Prazosin hydrochloride, a new antihypertensive agent, is said to be of mild-to-moderate potency when used as a sole agent in mild-to-moderate hypertension and when used in conjunction with other agents in severe hypertension. In our study of 14 patients comparing hydrochlorothiazide with prazosin, the antigypertensive effect of prazosin was less than that of hydrochlorothiazide. The greatest application of prazosin may be in conjunction with thiazide diuretics and beta-adrenergic blocking agents as the second or third drug.", 
    "31": "The AA., on the basis of their recent studies, offer a new hypothesis on the role of calcitonin, as a regulator of phosphorus metabolism. In addition the AA. confirm the clear interrelationship between calcitonin and other hormones as gastrin and autonomous nervous system.", 
    "32": "The administration of beta blockers has been useful in the treatment of essential hypertension. The anti-hypertensive effect of the beta-blocker sotalol was evaluated in 28 patients with essential hypertension. In all of the patients a determination of urinary aldosterone and plasma renin activity, before and after, three months of treatment with sotalol was done. In the pre-treatment tests, five patients (18%) had elevated renin values, in 13 (6%) renin was normal, and in 10 (36%) the renin activity in plasma was low. Treatment with sotalol caused normalization or significant lowering of diastolic pressure in the majority of cases with high or normal plasma renin. Patients with low plasma renin activity had less satisfactory results with the drug. Since there was no correlation between the lowering of arterial pressure and the degree of depletion of renin, we can conclude that anti-hypertensive mechanism of sotalol does not come from the decrease in secretion of renin. However our results suggest that patients with high renin respond better to treatment with sotalol, than cases with low renin levels.", 
    "33": "The results of experiments conducted with the nervous regulation of the heart intact indicate that body adaptation to physical exercises results in an increased capacity of the cardiac mechanisms responsible for the regulation of both the force of the contractions, and the rate of adapted animals, revealed when the neuroregulation was switched off, in contrast to those of non-adapted animals, indicate the enhancement of the autoregulation mechanism of the heart muscle under the effect of physical training.", 
    "34": "1. The positive chronotropic and inotropic actions of dopamine and noradrenaline have been compared in anaesthetized dogs and isolated guinea-pig atria. 2. Inotropic activity was measured with a strain-gauge arch in vagotomized dogs or estimated from max (dp/dt) in dogs with denervated hearts. 3. The effects of propranolol and haloperidol on the concentration-response curves to both amines were studied in isolated atria. 4. In anaesthetized vagotomized dogs noradrenaline was more potent than dopamine but dopamine appeared to have a selective inotropic action, less apparent with noradrenaline. In denervated hearts, doses of noradrenaline and dopamine which caused similar increases in max (dp/dt) also caused similar increases in heart rate. 5. In isolated atrial preparations, concentrations of dopamine and noradrenaline which produced similar increases in force of contraction also had similar chronotropic effects. 6. Propranolol produced a shift to the right of the concentration-response curves to both dopamine and noradrenaline but the antagonism of noradrenaline was quantitatively greater. Haloperidol had not effct in concentrations below those found to cause general tissue depression. 7. It is concluded that neither dopamine nor noradrenaline show any real difference in their relative inotropic and chronotropic activities in the absence of autonomic innervation.", 
    "35": "1. The effect of amitriptyline on cardiovascular variables has been studied in anaesthetized dogs. 2. In small doses (0.25 mg/dg) amitryptyline caused small increases in heart rates, contractility, blood pressure, coronary blood flow and aortic flow. 3. Large doses produced initial depressant effects on myocardial reflex rises in these and rate and blood pressure, which were followed by secondary reflex rises in these measurements. 4. The depressant effects were dose-related and were accompanied by marked increases in coronary flow and smaller increases in ortic flow. 5. The secondary reflex rises in cardiac parameters were abolished by propranolol and that of the blood pressure was much reduced.", 
    "36": "A depotentiating effect of prednisolone, benactyzine, reserpine, propranolole and large doses of serotonin on the development of the intoxication was shown to occur in combination with inhibition of the biogenic amines accumulation in various tissues of cats with botulinic paresis. The same phenomenon was observed in intoxicated animals maintained without pharmacological treatment.", 
    "37": "Effects of vasopressin on SA nodal pacemaker activity and atrial contractility were investigated, using 5 isolated, blood-perfused canine atrium preparations. Vasopressin produced a dose-related positive chronotropic and negative inotropic effect, which was not influenced by treatments with an adequate dose of atropine or an adrenergic beta-blocking agent, alprenolol. From these results, it is concluded that vasopressin has a direct stimulating property on SA nodal pacemaker activity and a direct suppressive property on atrial contractility.", 
    "38": "Barium examination of the small bowel revealed fixation, dilation, separation of bowel loops and delayed small intestinal transit in nine patients with practolol induced peritonitis. The diagnosis may be first suggested by this examination, and a history of prolonged therapy with beta-blocking agents should be sought in patients showing these changes where no other cause for them can be found. Symptoms may develop up to a year following cessation of therapy so that further cases may still come to light despite the withdrawal of practolol for long-term use. Small bowel barium examination is indicated in patients who have received practolol therapy and who develop suspicious alimentary symptoms.", 
    "39": "I. Two experiments were done with Pietrain and Large White pigs (about 50 kg body-weight) to determine whether fat mobilization is enhanced in the stress-sensitive Pietrains (which also produce pale, soft, exudative (PSE) meat). 2. In Expt I, plasma glucose and insulin concentrations and free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations and composition were measured in five Pietrains and five Large Whites after feeding, during an infusion of norepinephrine (2.5 microng/kg body-weight per min), 16 and 21 h after the withdrawal of food and following insulin administration (0.3 IU/kg body-weight). The entry rate of oleic acid was measured 4 h after feeding. Body composition and longissimus dorsi pH measurements were made on killing the pigs 4 d after the experiment. 3. After feeding, the Pietrans tended to have lower concentrations of glucose and insulin in plasma compared with the Large Whites, and higher concentrations of FFA. The Pietrans also had a faster entry rate of oleic acid into body tissues. In fasting (16 h) these differences in hormone and metabolite concentrations were also present and relationships between them and body development could be detected. Pietrains had higher concentrations of FFA and lower concentrations of insulin than Large Whites at a particular stage of the development of fat and muscle (subcutaneous fat weight divided by longissimus muscle weight). 4. The fatty acid composition of FFA resembled that of the backfat triglycerides in fasting and during norepinephrine infusion but not in the fed state. In particular the proportion of fatty acid 18:I was low in the fed pigs and that of 18:2 was high. The contrast in FFA composition between the fed and stimulated state was greater in the Large Whites. 5. The Pietrains were less sensitive to the antilipolytic action of insulin. Glucose and FFA concentrations were similar in both breeds during the norepinephrine infusion although insulin concentrations were increased to a larger extent in Large Whites at the termination of the infusion. 6. In Expt 2, anaesthetized Pietrain and Large White pigs were given constant infusions of norepinephrine alone (2.5 microng/kg body-weight per min) and norepinephrine + propranolol (2, 10 and 20 microng/kg body-weight per min) or phentolamine (2 and 10 microng/kg body-weight per min). The aim was to determine whether the breeds differed in their sensitivity to norepinephrine when conscious responses to the hormone were prevented. 7. When norepinephrine alone was infused, fat mobilization was greater in the Pietrain pigs and glucose concentrations were greater in the Large Whites. Propranolol markedly reduced the lipolytic action of norepinephrine, particularly in the Pietrain pigs studied, and phentolamine reduced its glycogenolytic action, particularly in the Large White pig. 8...", 
    "40": "Effect of fibrinogen degradation products on the rat blood vessels. Acta Physiol. Pol. 1977, 28 (2): 153--159. It was found that fibrinogen degradation products (FDP) exert a slight hypotensive effect and increase the flow of Tyrode's solution through isolated hindpaw of rat. The investigated peptides failed to change significantly the action of noradrenaline and had an additive effect with isoprenaline. Propranolol reduced the effects of FDP and isoprenaline. It is suggested that the described effects may be due to stimulation of the vascular beta-adrenergic receptors by FDP.", 
    "41": "The effects of propranolol on circulating free fatty acids (FFA) and cholesterol were studied in rabbits. The first injection (5 mg/kg) of the beta-blocking agent strongly stimulates FFA mobilization. The effect lasts less than 3 hours in fasting animals and more than 6 hours in fed animals. Propranolol also causes a drop in plasma cholesterol in fed rabbits. After prolonged treatment (5 mg/day/10 days), basal FFA levels were higher than in controls while plasma cholesterol levels of fed animals were lower than in normal rabbits.", 
    "42": "I. Interactions of angiotensin II and norepinephrine in the rat hypothalamus and other brainstem were studied by intraventricular perfusion or/and intravenous administration. (1) Intravenous administration of angiotensin reduced the hypothalamus norepinephrine content. (2) Intraventricularly perfused angiotensin reduced the hypothalamus norepinephrine but did not alter that in other parts of brainstem. Hypothalamus norepinephrine was reduced more by intravenous administration of angiotensin than by intraventricularly perfused angiotensin. II. The involvements of adrenergic mechanism in the central pressor effect of angiotensin II were studied through observation of blood pressure changes following injection of angiotensin II, phentolamine and propranolol into the rabbit lateral ventricle of rabbit brain.(1) Intraventricular administration of phentolamine suppressed the central mediated pressor respons of angiotensin. (2) Simultaneous intraventricular administration of propranolol enhanced the angiotensin pressor effect in anesthetized rabbits.", 
    "43": "Experiments were conducted on the myenteral plexus of the isolated stips of the small and large intestine; the presence of adrenosensitive cells which reacted to the application of different adrenaline (A) and noradrenaline (NA) concentrations by a distinct acceleration of the activity rhythm was demonstrated. NA with a greater range of action than A (from 10(-9) to 10(-5 g/ml) has the most marked effect. Introduction into the irrigating solution of phentholamine eliminated the mentioned effects in the majority of cases. \"Silent\" neurons without any spontaneous activity responded to the A and NA administration along with those possessing this activiy. As supposed, catecholamines could take a direct part in the modulation of the processes realized by the ganglionic neurons of the myenteral plexus.", 
    "44": "The parasympathetic and sympathetic components of the autonomic systems as they relate to cardiovascular function were studied on dogs with achalasia of the esophagus. This was accomplished by administering the parasympathomimetic drugs methacholine (0.2 mg/kg, subcutaneously), 2 doexy-D-glucose (100 mg/kg, intravenously (IV), the parasympatholytic drug atropine (0.2 mg/kg, IV), the sympathomimetic agent epinephrine (2.5 microng/kg, IV), and the beta adrenergic blocker propranolol (0.5 mg/kg, IV); and then measuring cardiac output, stroke volume, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, pulse pressure, central venous pressure, total peripheral resistance, PaCO2, PaO2, pH, and base deficit. Cardiovascular responses to the administration of the parasympathomimetic drugs, methacholine and 2 deoxy-D-glucose, or the parasympatholytic drug, atropine, were similar to those observed in normal dogs. Cardiovascular responses to the administration of the sympathomimetic drug epinephrine and the sympatholytic drug propranolol or beta blocker were also consistent with those observed in normal dogs. It can be interpreted from this pharmacologic evidence that parasympathetic and sympathetic innervations to the cardiovascular system are present in dogs with achalasia of the esophagus. Fewer cardiovascular variables were significantly altered in dogs with achalasia than in normal dogs. Since this was true for both the sympathetic and the parasympathetic values, it is interpreted as reflecting their general health rather than a specific lesion.", 
    "45": "ST-T wave changes in the electrocardiogram detected during routine examination and aggravated by erect posture, hyperventilation, and exercise in apparently healthy young individuals have been termed vasoregulatory abnormalities. No evidence of ischaemic heart disease has been found in such subjects. Ten young healthy air crew with vasoregulatory abnormalities were subjected to maximal exercise on treadmill and procedure repeated after 120 mg propranolol daily for 3 days. After one week, they were subjected to a stress of positive acceleration (+gz) in a human centrifuge at 2-5 g and 3-5 g for 15 seconds each at a constant rate of rise of 0-1 g/s and the electrocardiogram was monitored during and in the post-acceleration phase. The procedure was repeated after propranolol 120 mg daily for 3 days. The stress of positive acceleration resulted in pronounced prominence of P waves and inversion of T waves (as has been reported in normal subjects) with minimal ST depression in the electrocardiogram. ST segment depression during exercise, at heart rates corresponding to those achieved during peak centrifuge runs, was significantly more pronounced. The ST, P, and T wave changes were returned to normal after propranolol. It is concluded that minimal ST segment depression after stress of positive acceleration as compared with conspicuous ST segment depression during exercise at corresponding heart rates, and their normalisation after propranolol, rules out ischaemia as an aetiological factor in subjects with vasoregulatory abnormalities.", 
    "46": "The hydrolysis of lipoprotein triglycerides is catalyzed by lipoprotein lipase (LPL), an enzyme found in many tissues. We have examined tissue LPL activity (LPLA) in rats with experimentally-induced hyperthyroidism. In younger, lighter rats, hyperthyroidism was accompanied by a decrease in LPL in adipose tissue whereas heart and diaphragm muscle LPL activities were increased. These changes are consistent with the hypothesis that the hypercatabolism and increased beta-adrenergic activity of hyperthyroidism result in characteristic changes in tissue LPLA. In older, heavier hyperthyroid animals, however, adipose tissue LPLA was increased and heart and diaphragmatic LPLA were similar to control activities. Propranolol feeding abolished the thyroxine-induced increase in adipose tissue LPLA. In euthyroid animals of similar size the response of muscle LPLA to short-term starvation was also attenuated. These changes in tissue LPLA may provide a mechanism for shunting triglyceride fatty acids away from adipose tissue for utilization by muscle in the hyperthyroid state. During growth and aging, these adaptations are modified.", 
    "47": "Propranolol has been utilized safely and successfully in the preparation for thyroidectomy in four pregnant patients with thyrotoxicosis. No ill effects were noted in mothers or infants. No change in fetal heart function was noted while two mothers were receiving propranolol. The major advantage of propranolol over the thiourea drugs is the rapidity with which the patient can be prepared for operation. Preparation with beta blockage can be accomplished in five to ten days. This limited experience suggests that propranolol is probably the drug of choice for preparation of the gravid thyrotoxic patient for whom thyroidectomy is planned.", 
    "48": "Hemodynamics and plasma renin activity were measured in 20 ambulatory hospital inpatients with untreated mild to moderate essential hypertension. The control measurements were made after a period of four to seven days just on a diet containing 10 mEq sodium per day. The measurements were repeated following a week of oral propranolol hydrochloride therapy plus the low salt diet. Heart rate (P less than .001), mean arterial pressure (P less than .001), cardiac output (P less than .05), and plasma renin activity (P less than .05) were reduced in the majority of these patients following propranolol therapy but stroke volume increased (P less than .05). Corrected ejection time and total peripheral resistance did not show significant change. The antihypertensive effect of propranolol could not be related to its hyporeninemic effect or to the fall in cardiac output. Under the experimental conditions of this study, no single parameter, either hemodynamic or plasma renin activity, was predictive of a definite antihypertensive response to propranolol therapy.", 
    "49": "In 79 patients with essential hypertension, treatment with propranolol hydrochloride and chlorthalidone together produced significantly greater falls in both systolic and diastolic blood pressures than were obtained with either drug alone. There were no differences between patients in the high, normal, and low renin subgroups in their responsiveness to this combination. Although plasma renin level during combined treatment was twice as high as it was in the untreated control, aldosterone excretion actually decreased. These divergent changes may have been influenced by the renin-raising and aldosterone-lowering effects of the marked hypokalemia observed during combined treatment. By comparison with patients whose blood pressures fell, treatment in nonresponding patients produced even greater body weight reductions and significantly higher renin and aldosterone values. It is possible that increased activity of the renin axis, triggered by excessive volume depletion and perhaps by changes in potassium balance, were responsible for sustaining the high levels of blood pressure in those patients failing to respond to treatment.", 
    "50": "In isolated trout heads, perfused at constant pressure, epinephrine (10(-6) M) was found to double water and urea efflux but increased Ringer perfusion rate by only 33%. Drastic changes in perfusion rate (by clamping) produced smaller changes of both efflux rates. Epinephrine-stimulated increase in water and urea efflux, and perfusion rate, was blocked by propranolol (beta-blocker) but not by phentolamine (alpha-blocker). Both blockers together canceled out all epinephrine effects. Epinephrine increased water influx across isolated unperfused gill arches, the effect again being blocked by propranolol but not by phentolamine. Both blockers together canceled any epinephrine effect. We conclude that epinephrine alters branchial vascular flow and functional surface area via alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors, but also increases branchial permeability to water and probably urea, via beta-adrenergic receptors. To test the validity of the perfused head technique, water and urea efflux rates were compared with in vivo values.", 
    "51": "The present study examines the effects of alpha- and beta-adrenergic antagonists (phentolamine and propranolol, respectively) and agonists (phenylephrine, isoproterenol) on the neurally induced temperature changes and membrane potentials of interscapular brown adipocytes. These studies, performed in vivo with anesthetized rats, indicate that both alpha- and beta-adrenergic components are associated with the biphasic temperature changes observed following sympathetic activation of the tissue. Specifically, the initial transient temperature decrease seen after brown fat stimulation appeared to reflect vasoconstriction mediated primarily via alpha-receptors, while the subsequent rise in tissue temperature was associated primarily (though perhaps not entirely) with beta-adrenergic pathways. In contrast, the redistribution of ions across the membrane of the brown adipocyte, a phenomenon manifested as a membrane depolarization, was elicited by phenylephrine (an alpha-agonist) as well as by isoproterenol (a beta-agonist), with the magnitude of the isoproterenol-induced depolarization being comparable to that of the phenylephrine-induced effect.", 
    "52": "The mechanics of left ventricular contraction were investigated in terms of instantaneous mural force, mid-wall circumferential fiber shortening velocity (dL/dt), and fiber length (L) in seven servo-regulated hearts. The steady-state response of series of variably preloaded or afterloaded allasotonic contractions were utilized. Norepinephrine (0.55-1.38 mug/min) or propranolol (0.07-0.14 mg/min) were given to alter inotropic background. For any given contractile state and initial L, maximum dL/dt was not attained instantly but after a finite time of ejection (39 ms +/- 0.2 SE; range, 24-60) and from a lesser length (92% +/- 0.5 SE; range, 83-99) than present at end diastole. Beyond this initial period instantaneous dL/dt was dependent on both instantaneous force and length while independent of time after contraction and initial L. Instantaneous dL/dt also varied with contractile state, e.g., dL/dt was less after propranolol and greater after norepinephrine. Peak dL/dt for all conditions was a function of the extent of shortening (r = 0.90). Thus, the trajectory describing instantaneous force, velocity, and length provides a useful description of both the mechanical behavior and contractile state of the ventricular myocardium."
