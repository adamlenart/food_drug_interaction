    "1": "A modified parallel factors analysis (PARAFAC) algorithm with a penalty diagonalization error (PDE), newly proposed by the present authors, was utilized to simultaneously resolve drug mixtures of propranolol (PRO), dipyridamole (DIP) and amiloride (AMI) without any loss of sensitivity. The analyses were performed in aqueous solution. The experimental results demonstrated that the profiles of the spectra and the concentrations could be accurately resolved using the PDE algorithm with a high sensitivity and stable repeatability. That is to say, the closely overlapping problem of the spectra could be easily solved. Furthermore, simultaneous determinations of three kinds of tablets, which contain PRO, AMI and DIP, respectively, were successfully performed with satisfactory results.", 
    "2": "Dobutamine stress echocardiography is a time-consuming test, often requiring atropine at the end of the protocol to achieve target heart rate (HR). We examined whether earlier administration of atropine in appropriate patients would shorten test time and increase the likelihood of achieving peak HR.",

Of these, 120 patients with an inadequate HR response [mid-30 microg/kg/min HR<100 (age <50) or <90 (age >50); or mid-40 microg/kg/min stage HR<120 (age <50) or <110 (age >50)] were included in the analysis. The remaining patients were used in a model to define which patients are likely to require atropine.", 
    "4": "The 61 patients receiving early-atropine had decreased test-time relative to the 59 not receiving early-atropine (17:05 vs. 18:24 min:sec, P=0.014) accompanied by a 10% reduction in total dobutamine dose (P=0.008). Their HR at end of 40 microg/kg/min was 123+/-18 vs. 105+/-17 respectively, P<0.0001. Only 7% of the early-atropine group failed to reach target HR vs. 15% not receiving early-atropine. By multivariate analysis, age (P<0.0001), HR at end of 30 microg/kg/min stage (P<0.0001), beta-blocker use (P=0.009) and baseline HR (P=0.04) were predictors of need for atropine.",

    "6": "To evaluate the effect of acute beta-blockade in combination with differing heart rates on longitudinal and circumferential regional myocardial function using Doppler myocardial imaging and two-dimensional-echocardiography.", 
    "7": "In seven pigs the following echocardiographic indices were measured at baseline, after beta-blockade both without and with atrial pacing: wall thickening fraction, fractional shortening, myocardial peak systolic velocity, transmyocardial velocity gradient and systolic velocity time integral of the posterolateral wall in short-axis view; mitral valve plane excursion, myocardial peak systolic velocity and systolic velocity time integral of the posterolateral wall in an apical five-chamber view. Peak systolic velocities and velocity gradients decreased significantly following acute beta-blockade but no further decay occurred at high heart rate due to pacing. The velocity time integrals and mitral valve plane excursion showed a tendency to decrease following beta-blockade but only after pacing were they significantly reduced. The wall thickening fraction and fractional shortening showed a significant reduction after beta-blockade but no further decay after pacing.", 
    "8": "Changes in systolic velocities and velocity gradients were independent of heart rate reduction under high dosage beta-blockade, whereas wall thickening fraction, mitral valve plane excursion and velocity time integrals changed due to pacing.", 
    "9": "Apoptosis as defined by contemporary science describes a form of cell death that involves discrete genetic and molecular programs, de novo protein expression and unique cellular phenotype. Evidence for the existence of apoptosis in the human heart has been reported in various cardiac diseases, including ischemic and non-ischemic heart failure, myocardial infarction and arrhythmias. Among the most potent stimuli that elicit cardiomyocyte apoptosis are: oxygen radicals (including NO), cytokines, (e.g., TNFalpha, FAS) neurohormonal factors (angiotension II), cardiotoxic drugs (e.g., doxorubicin) and mechanical, stretch situations. Several complex signal transduction pathways have been implicated in execution of cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Most prominent are: 1) Tyrosine kinase receptors (TRK) induced signaling involving stress or mitogen activated protein kinases (SAPK/MARK) and sphingolipids metabolites (ceramide); 2) G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling (Galphai, Galphaq) and 3) NF(K) B activation. Apoptosis of cardiac myocytes may contribute to progressive pump-failure, arrhythmias and cardiac remodeling. The recognition of diverse molecular targets associated with cardiomyocyte apoptosis provide new opportunities for pharmacologic manipulation, that may lead to discovery and development of therapeutic strategies for treatment of heart failure, arrhythmias and myocardial infarction.", 
    "10": "There is concern over the safety of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) in acute coronary disease. We sought to determine if patients taking calcium channel blockers (CCBs) at the time of admission with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) had a higher case-fatality compared with those taking beta-blockers or neither medication. Clinical and drug treatment variables at the time of hospital admission predictive of survival at 28 days were examined in a community-based registry of patients aged under 65 years admitted to hospital for suspected AMI in Perth, Australia, between 1984 and 1993. Among 7766 patients, 1291 (16.6%) were taking a CCB and 1259 (16.2%) a betablocker alone at hospital admission. Patients taking CCBs had a worse clinical profile than those taking a beta-blocker alone or neither drug (control group), and a higher unadjusted 28-day mortality (17.6% versus 9.3% and 11.1% respectively, both P < 0.001). There was no significant heterogeneity with respect to mortality between nifedipine, diltiazem, or verapamil when used alone, or with a beta-blocker. After adjustment for factors predictive of death at 28 days, patients taking a CCB were found not to have an excess chance of death compared with the control group (odds ratio [OR] 1.06, 95% confidence interval [CI]; 0.87, 1.30), whereas those taking a beta-blocker alone had a lower odds of death (OR 0.75, 95% CI; 0.59, 0.94). These results indicate that established calcium channel blockade is not associated with an excess risk of death following AMI once other differences between patients are taken into account, but neither does it have the survival advantage seen with prior beta-blocker therapy.", 
    "11": "We have shown that chronic treatment with carteolol, a non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, improved left ventricular (LV) function and survival in an avian model of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). The aim of the present study was to compare ex vivo heart function with and without beta-agonist and antagonist challenge. We investigated whether intracoronary infusion of a beta-blocker, carteolol or beta-agonist, isoproterenol decreased contractility. In the DCM group, isoproterenol resulted in a significantly greater increase in heart rate (71% vs. 28% compared to control hearts). To investigate the mechanism for the increase in heart rate, we exposed spontaneously beating neonatal cardiomyocytes to serum immunoglobulin (IgG) isolated from DCM animals. Serum IgG resulted in a significant increase in spontaneous beating rate in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes that was blocked by pre-treatment with a beta-blocker. Carteolol challenge did not significantly change heart rate but did significantly increase LV peak pressure in DCM hearts (62%) while coronary artery flow remained unchanged (2.7+/-0.1 vs 2.7+/-0.5 ml/min/g). These results show that 1) beta-receptor stimulation results in a greater tachycardic response in DCM animals, and 2) carteolol challenge improves myocardial contractility in hearts from DCM animals independent of heart rate or changes in coronary artery flow.", 
    "12": "Forty-two newly diagnosed patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism were randomly assigned to receive 131I therapy after pretreatment with methimazole (21) or beta-blocker alone (21) and prospectively evaluated, to determine possible effects of methimazole on 131I treatment outcome. After randomization, 8 patients were excluded from the study (5 from pretreatment group and 3 from nonpretreatment group). Radioactive iodine (baseline dose 15 mCi, adjusted for goiter size and/or 131I uptake) was administered after pretreatment with methimazole (30 mg initial dose for at least 2 months and stopped 6 days before treatment) and beta-blocker or pretreatment with beta-blocker alone (atenolol 50-100 mg/d). All but one patient in each group became hypothyroid. A similar length of time was required by both groups to achieve hypothyroidism (112 days, [95% confidence interval [CI] = 28 to 196 days) in the pretreated group and 106 days, [95% CI = 45 to 167 days] in nonpretreated patients). Free thyroxine (T4) normalized 44 +/- 39 days after therapy in the nonpretreated group and 35 +/- 30 days in the pretreated group (p = 0.57) and decreased to subnormal levels 80 +/- 70 days in nonpretreated and 65 +/- 32 days in pretreated patients (p = 0.46). We conclude that pretreating patients with methimazole before radioactive iodine therapy does not interfere with the final outcome. Similar cure rates and time required to achieve hypothyroidism after radioiodine were observed when patients were pretreated with methimazole compared to nonpretreated patients.", 
    "13": "Because of the known limitations of the Bazett and other heart rate correction formulas, it has been proposed that studies of drug induced QT interval changes should use several different heart rate correction formulas and that the consistency of findings by a majority of such formulas should be considered as valid. The aim of this article was to show that such an approach is inappropriate. Using the database of the EMIAT trial, data of QT and RR intervals were taken from electrocardiograms of the first postrandomization visit of 1,402 patients. Of these, 309 were on amiodarone and beta-blockers, 395 on amiodarone and off beta-blockers, 318 on beta-blockers and off amiodarone, and 380 off amiodarone and off beta-blockers. An investigation of drug induced QT interval changes was modeled by evaluating the corrected QT (QTc) interval differences between patients on and off amiodarone, and on and off beta-blockers. A set of 31 previously published heart rate correction formulas was used. In addition to calculating the QTc difference between on and off drug for each formula, the success of heart rate correction was judged by computing correlation coefficients between QTc and RR intervals (ideally corrected QTc values should be independent of heart rate). The difference between on and off drug QT intervals was also evaluated by logarithmic regression models between uncorrected QT and RR intervals in data taken from patients on and off treatment. The QTc interval prolongation on amiodarone was confirmed by all heart rate correction formulas but the extent of the prolongation differed from formula to formula and ranged from 13.6 to 30.9 ms. Of the 31 formulas, 3 reported QTc interval shortening on beta-blockers (up to -11.8 ms) and 28 reported QTc interval prolongation (up to +16.8 ms). The distribution of the results provided by the different formulas suggested that beta-blocker treatment led to a QTc interval prolongation by approximately 7 ms (e.g., +7.4 ms by the Fridericia formula, P = 0.002). The on treatment QTc changes obtained by different formulas were closely correlated to their correction success. Formulas that provided QTc intervals almost independent of the RR intervals estimated approximately 20 ms QTc prolongation on amiodarone and no QTc change on beta-blockers. QT/RR regression analysis confirmed that while amiodarone led to substantial QT prolongation, there was no change of QT interval on beta-blockers beyond the change in heart rate. The study showed that the concept of \"majority voting\" by different heart rate correction formulas is inappropriate and may lead to erroneous conclusions.", 
    "14": "The calcium ion influx through voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs) has a vital role in the control of neurotransmitter release and membrane excitability. Prepulse facilitation is a phenomenon in which a strong depolarizing pulse induces a form of the VDCCs that exhibits an increased opening probability in response to a given test potential; this persists for several seconds after repolarization. It has been reported that prepulse facilitation occurs via dissociation of the guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins (G-proteins) from the VDCCs and that recovery from facilitation involves rebinding of the G-proteins. The heterotrimeric G-proteins act as switches that regulate information processing circuits connecting cell surface G-protein-coupled-receptors to a variety of effectors. In this study, we have studied the characterization of G-protein subtypes in prepulse facilitation of VDCCs currents (Ica) in hamster submandibular ganglion (SMG) neurons, using whole-cell patch clamp recordings. Under control conditions, with GTP (0.1 mM) in the recording pipette, the rate of prepulse facilitation was 19.0 +/- 1.9% (n = 13). Intracellular dialysis with GDP-beta-S (0.1 mM), G-protein blocker, and pretreatment of neurons with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) (100 microM for 2 min), Gi/o blocker, attenuated the rate of prepulse facilitation. Intracellular dialysis of anti-Gq/11-antibody did not alter it. These results suggest that prepulse facilitation of VDCCs is due to Gi/o-types of G-protein, but not to the Gq/11-type, in SMG neurons.", 
    "15": "Calcium channel blockers, widely used for the treatment of hypertension and angina, could prevent cardiovascular complications in patients with diabetes. They can improve cardiac remodelling in animal models of a variety of cardiovascular diseases. Here, we examined the therapeutic effect of benidipine, a long-acting calcium channel blocker, on cardiac remodelling in Otsuka-Long-Evans-Tokushima-Fatty (OLETF) rats, a Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus model.", 
    "16": "The methods for morphometric analysis included double staining for coronary capillaries, dye-binding staining for collagen content and Masson's trichrome staining for perivascular fibrosis.

    "17": "OLETF rats showed an increased coronary capillary density, a reduced venular capillary proportion, an increased cardiac collagen content and prominent cardiac perivascular fibrosis. In OLETF rat hearts, significant increases in vascular expressions for VEGF, bFGF and TGF- beta(1) were found. Furthermore, the apoptosis signalling pathways, involving eNOS and apoptotic markers, were markedly altered, and coronary endothelial cell apoptosis was lower. These alterations with the exception of eNOS expression were significantly blocked by benidipine treatment.", 
    "18": "The suppressive effect of benidipine on overproduction of angiogenic growth factors could prevent cardiac angiogenesis and fibrosis, resulting in an improvement of cardiac remodelling in diabetes. As VEGF and bFGF potently block endothelial cell apoptosis execution, physiological apoptosis revived by benidipine treatment could also contribute to coronary vessel regression.",

    "20": "A retrospective study of 14 patients who developed periorbital dermatitis while using topical dorzolamide hydrochloride was undertaken. Six patients underwent patch testing for sensitivity to Trusopt, dorzolamide hydrochloride, and the preservative benzalkonium chloride.", 
    "21": "The periorbital dermatitis occurred after a mean period of 20.4 weeks of commencing dorzolamide hydrochloride therapy. 13 patients had used preserved topical beta blocker treatment for a mean period of 34.2 months without complication before the introduction of dorzolamide. In eight (57.1%) the dermatitis resolved completely after discontinuing dorzolamide but in six (42.9%) resolution of the dermatitis did not occur until the concomitant preserved beta blocker was stopped and substituted with preservative free drops. Patch testing for sensitivity to Trusopt, dorzolamide hydrochloride, and benzalkonium chloride was negative.", 
    "22": "These findings suggest that dorzolamide can cause severe periorbital dermatitis. Although the dermatitis may resolve when dorzolamide is discontinued, this does not always occur and in some patients all topical medication containing benzalkonium chloride needs to be stopped.", 
    "23": "The role of oxytocin in parturition in mice was investigated. Pup birth profiles, blood samples and brains were collected from parturient mice observed under red light conditions in a reversed light:dark photoperiod. Peripheral administration of an oxytocin antagonist in a dose-dependent manner delayed the birth of subsequent pups, indicating that oxytocin is required for a normal pup birth profile. Oxytocin neurones were activated during birth as shown by both increased immediate early gene ( Fos) expression in oxytocin neurones in the supraoptic nucleus and increased plasma oxytocin concentrations during birth. In addition, the nucleus of the tractus solitarius and the olfactory bulbs, sites that process inputs to oxytocin neurones, become activated during parturition. Exposure to stress during parturition halted subsequent deliveries; at this stage plasma oxytocin concentrations were not higher than those of virgin mice, and birth was restored by administration of oxytocin. Administration of beta-adrenergic antagonist (propranolol) also restored stress-delayed birth, whereas administration of ritrodrine (beta-agonist) delayed birth in non-stressed mice, indicating that adrenergic mechanisms contribute to stress-delayed births in mice. Administration of morphine (mu-opioid agonist) delayed births transiently, but naloxone (opioid antagonist) did not prevent stress-delayed birth, indicating that endogenous opioids do not appear to contribute to neuroendocrine or uterine mechanisms that promote birth in mice. Therefore, despite evidence in oxytocin knockout mice that oxytocin is not essential for parturition in this species, the results of the present study indicate that oxytocin neurone activity and secretion contribute to the birth process in normal mice.",

Patients were then blindly randomized to receive either oral dofetilide 500 microg twice daily or oral sotalol 160 mg twice daily, for 3 to 5 days. Suppression of inducible ventricular tachycardia on the drug was then assessed by programmed electrophysiological stimulation. After a wash-out period of at least 2.5 days, the patients received the alternative treatment for 3 to 5 days. Suppression of inducible ventricular tachycardia on the alternate drug was again determined by programmed electrophysiological stimulation. Selection of long-term treatment was allocated blindly according to programmed electrophysiological stimulation results.",

Forty-six patients (35.9%) were responders to dofetilide compared with 43 (33.6%) to sotalol (P=ns). Only 23 patients responded to both dofetilide and sotalol. Adverse events, deemed to be treatment related, were seen in 2.3% of patients receiving dofetilide and 8.6% of patients receiving sotalol (P=0.016). Three patients on dofetilide had torsade de pointes. Two patients receiving sotalol died during the acute phase (one was arrhythmic death, and the other was due to heart failure). During the long-term phase, two of 42 patients (4.8%) receiving dofetilide and three of 27 patients (11.1%) receiving sotalol withdrew from treatment due to lack of efficacy.

In rats that received a single drop of timolol in one eye, the tissue concentrations were higher in the treated eye than in the untreated eye in all cases except for vitreous. In these experiments, timolol levels in plasma were either low or not detectable. Increasing timolol doses administered intraperitoneally resulted in corresponding increased tissue and plasma concentrations.",

A clear dose-response relationship exists in all ocular tissues studied after an intraperitoneal dose of timolol. High doses of timolol were required to achieve measurable concentrations of drug in the ocular tissues via our high performance liquid chromatography assay suggesting that a significant hepatic first-pass effect may be involved after an intraperitoneal injection of timolol.",

More Finns were on beta-blockers both preoperatively (93 vs. 68%, P<0.001) and postoperatively (97 vs. 66%, P<0.001). However, AF was more frequent among Finns (38 vs. 29%, P=0.037) and present on 4.6% of cases when transferred postoperatively. No USA patients had AF at time of discharge. Mean length of stay was 8.6 days at USA, and not affected by AF. The incidence of in-hospital death, strokes and multiorgan failures was similar. Multivariable analysis, adjusted for site and selection biases (propensity analysis) revealed increasing age [OR=1.063 (1.042, 1.084), P<0.0001] and use of radial arteries [OR=2.175 (1.071, 4.417), P=0.032) to be independent predictors to the incidence of postoperative AF.",

    "47": "In this study, we performed a screening of the specificities of rat cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms for metabolic reactions known as the specific probes of human CYP isoforms, using 13 rat CYP isoforms expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells or B-lymphoblastoid cells. Among the metabolic reactions studied, diclofenac 4-hydroxylation (DFH), dextromethorphan O-demethylation (DMOD) and midazolam 4-hydroxylation were specifically catalyzed by CYP2C6, CYP2D2 and CYP3A1/3A2, respectively. These results suggest that diclofenac 4-hydroxylation, dextromethorphan O-demethylation and midazolam 4-hydroxylation are useful as catalytic markers of CYP2C6, CYP2D2 and CYP3A1/3A2, respectively. On the other hand, phenacetin O-deethylation and 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylation were catalyzed both by CYP1A2 and by CYP2C6. Benzyloxyresorufin O-dealkylation and pentoxyresorufin O-dealkylation were also catalyzed by CYP1A2 in addition to CYP2B1. Bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation was extensively catalyzed by CYP2D2 but also by CYP2C6 and CYP2C11. p-Nitrophenol 2-hydroxylation and chlorzoxazone 6-hydroxylation were extensively catalyzed by CYP2E1 but also by CYP1A2 and CYP3A1. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct further study to clarify whether these activities in rat liver microsomes are useful as probes of rat CYP isoforms. In contrast, coumarin 7-hydroxylation and S- and R-mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylation did not show selectivity toward any isoforms of rat CYP studied. Therefore, activities of coumarin 7-hydroxylation and S- and R-mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylation are not able to be used as catalytic probes of CYP isoforms in rat liver microsomes. These results may provide useful information regarding catalytic probes of rat CYPs for studies using rat liver microsomal samples.",

    "50": "Beginning in 1997, a trained medical staff member of the Pharmacovigilance Center, Rostock, prospectively screened all hospital admissions to the Departments of Internal Medicine of the 2 hospitals in Rostock (40,000 hospital admissions). ADRs leading to hospital admission were registered, evaluated and reported.", 
    "51": "A total of 1,441 ADRs were recorded by the Pharmacovigilance Center Rostock in the period up to December 2000. 12% (n = 173) of all ADRs involve the cardiovascular system; 83 patients (5.7% of all ADRs) suffered from bradycardia. Bradycardia was the most frequent cardiovascular ADR observed. Of these patients, 88% were receiving 3 - 10 different drugs. Drugs suspected of causing bradycardia were: digitalis (n = 62), beta-blockers (n = 47), calcium channel blockers with negative chronotropic effect (n = 45), and antiarrhythmic drugs (n = 3). 54 patients had received more than I of these drugs concomitantly as outpatients, increasing the risk of drug interactions: 18 patients received digitalis + calcium channel blocker; 14 patients digitalis + beta-blocker; 7 patients beta-blocker + calcium channel blocker; 12 cases digitalis + beta-blocker + calcium channel blocker.",

    "53": "Selective blockade of the inward rectifier potassium channel I(K1) by barium, or of the rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium channel I(Kr) by D,L-sotalol, prolongs repolarization and reduces the defibrillation threshold (DFT). This study hypothesized that combination I(K1) and I(Kr) channel block would produce concentration-dependent additive effects on DFT and ventricular refractoriness. A range of barium and D,L-sotalol concentrations, alone and in combination, were examined with respect to DFT, ventricular effective refractory period (VERP), and ventricular fibrillation cycle length (VFCL) in 133 Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts. Barium produced a concentration-dependent reduction of DFT (-49+/-4%), with concentration-dependent increases in VERP (26+/-6%) and VFCL (42+/-18%). D,L-Sotalol produced a concentration-dependent lowering of DFT (-53+/-6%) with a concentration-dependent increase in VFCL (34+/-8%) but not VERP. Low (1.6 microM), intermediate (3.1 microM), and high (12.5 microM) barium concentrations combined with varying D,L-sotalol concentrations produced equal or smaller decreases in DFT compared with corresponding doses of barium or D,L-sotalol alone. Except at the lowest concentrations of barium (1.6 and 3.1 microM) (p < 0.05), there was no significant additive interaction between barium and D,L-sotalol on VERP or VFCL. Combination I(K1) and I(Kr) channel block by barium and D,L-sotalol does not produce additive reduction of DFT.",

    "55": "The objective was to evaluate the clinic interest of the esmolol in the attenuation of the hemodynamic response to suspension microlaryngoscopy (mls). It was a prospective, randomized and double blind study, having included 29 patient ASA II and III, distributed in two groups, having received respectively before laryngoscopy: group A (n = 15), esmolol in intravenous (i.v.) at the dose of 150 micrograms.kg-1 and DS group (n = 14), 10 ml of normal saline at 0.9%. Has been achieved a general anaesthesia i.v. based on propofol, fentanyl and atracurium. After tracheal intubation, it has been assured an artificial ventilation. The two groups were comparable for the demographic and anesthetic characteristics. A significant decrease of the mean arterial pressure (-11%) and of the prp (product systolic arterial pressure heart rate) have been raised during the mls, in the group esmolol, whereas the variations of the cardiac frequency were comparable. In order to assure a better hemodynamic control during the mls, it seems important, in addition to the adjustment of the recommended dose of esmolol, to cover the whole duration of the endoscopic act by a continuous drip.",

    "57": "Change in intraocular pressure (IOP) of albino rabbits was measured after a single application of carboxy-PTIO (c-PTIO), an NO trapping agent. Next, IOP change was measured every hour for 5 hours after the instillation of 0.25% nipradilol into one of the eyes with and without c-PTIO pretreatment of both eyes. IOP change induced by desnitro-nipradilol was also examined. The outflow facility and uveoscleral outflow were determined by two-level constant pressure and anterior chamber perfusion methods before and at 3 hours after the application of nipradilol with and without c-PTIO pretreatment.", 
    "58": "Topical administration of c-PTIO showed no significant effect on IOP. Unilateral instillation of nipradilol reduced IOP significantly compared with control eyes with a maximum reduction of 3.6 mmHg and effect duration of 3 hours. Pretreatment with c-PTIO partially inhibited the reduction during an earlier period (1 approximately 2 hours) and completely at 3 hours. IOP change by desnitro-nipradilol was similar to that by nipradilol with c-PTIO pretreatment. Nipradilol increased both outflow facility and uveoscleral outflow at 3 hours, whereas pretreatment with c-PTIO inhibited both of these outflows.",

In six patients, the blood pressure on 'best' drug was at least 10 mmHg lower than on any other. Response to the 'best' drug was highly correlated (r = 0.79) with its previous administration. By contrast, there were only weak correlations between responses to pairs of drugs, except for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (A) with beta-blocker (B), and calcium blocker (C) with diuretic (D) - each r = 0.71, P < 0.005).

    "68": "Racemic propranolol attenuates cardiac hypertrophy secondary to abdominal aortic banding-induced pressure overload by a mechanism independent of its effect on cardiac work load. This was only observed, however, using doses of propranolol that were much higher than those needed to induce beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Thus, the question remains as to whether the antihypertrophic effect of propranolol depends on its ability to antagonize cardiac beta-adrenoceptor-mediated action (positive chronotropic effect, trophic effect) or on beta-adrenoceptor-independent action.", 
    "69": "In a rat model of chronic pressure overload induced by abdominal aortic banding, we evaluated the effects on left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) of the propranolol isomers, L-propranolol and D-propranolol, which compared to L-isomer is approximately 50-fold less potent as a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, but is similarly potent as a membrane-stabilizer, as well as of timolol, a non-selective beta-adrenergic antagonist devoid of membrane stabilizing activity, and disopyramide, which is a membrane stabilizer, but not a beta-adrenoceptor blocker.", 
    "70": "Compared to sham-operated rats, banded rats had 30% greater left ventricular to body weight (LVW/BW) ratio (P < 0.01). The increase in LVW/BW ratio was significantly attenuated by treatment with 40 and 80 (but not 10) mg/kg per day of L-propranolol. Left ventricular hypertrophy was also prevented by D-propranolol, 40 and 80 mg/kg per day, and disopyramide, 50 mg/kg per day, whereas timolol, 30 and 60 mg/kg per day, showed no antihypertrophic effect. In separate groups of banded rats in which the reduction in heart rate induced by propranolol (80 mg/kg per day) was prevented by chronic cardiac pacing at 375 b.p.m., hypertrophy was again prevented, indicating that the effects of L-propranolol on LVH are not related to a reduction in cardiac work load.",

The angiotensinogen T174M and M235T, the angiotensin-converting enzyme I/D, the AT1-receptor A1166C and the aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) -344 C/T polymorphisms were analysed and related to the change in left ventricular mass (LVM). Patients with the angiotensinogen 174 TM genotype treated with irbesartan responded with the greatest reduction in LVM (-23 +/- 31SD g/m2 for TM and +0.5 +/- 18 g/m2 for TT, P = 0.005), independent of blood pressure reduction. Both the angiotensinogen 235 T-allele (P = 0.02) and the AT1-receptor 1166 AC genotype responded with the greatest reduction in LVM when treated with irbesartan (-0.1 +/- 19 g/m2 for AA and -18 +/- 30 g/m2 for AC, P = 0.02), independent of blood pressure reduction. These polymorphisms were not associated with the change in LVM during treatment with atenolol.",

This highlights the role of the RAAS for left ventricular hypertrophy and the potential of pharmacogenetics as a tool for guidance of antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "75": "Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of choline (75-300 microg) produced a dose-dependent increase in blood glucose levels. Pre-treatment with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, mecamylamine (50 microg, i.c.v.) blocked the hyperglycemia induced by choline (150 microg, i.c.v.), but the response was not affected by pre-treatment with the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, atropine (10 microg, i.c.v.). Pre-treatment with the neuronal choline uptake inhibitor, hemicholinium-3 (20 microg, i.c.v.), attenuated the hyperglycemia induced by choline. The hyperglycemic response to choline was associated increased plasma levels of adrenaline and noradrenaline. The hyperglycemia elicited by choline was greatly attenuated by bilateral adrenalectomy, and entirely blocked by either surgical transection of the splanchnic nerves or by pre-treatment with the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist, phentolamine. These data show that choline, a precursor of acetylcholine, increases blood glucose and this effect is mediated by central nicotinic acetylcholine receptor activation. An increase in sympatho-adrenal activity appears to be involved in the hyperglycemic effect of choline.", 
    "76": "Numerous studies have shown that alterations in sympathetic nervous system (SNS) function produced by beta-adrenergic receptor blockade or chemical sympathectomy can produce changes in T and B lymphocyte function and both innate and acquired immune responses. However, fewer studies have investigated changes in immune response following SNS alterations in animal models of disease. We tested whether blocking SNS activity using 6-OHDA or the beta-receptor antagonist nadolol alters the typical pattern in production of T helper 1 (Th1) and Th2 cytokines seen in cultures of spleen cells from C57BL/6 mice infected with murine AIDS (MAIDS). We found that neither method of sympathetic blockade affected cytokine response to MAIDS. We also found that the norepinephrine concentration and content of the spleen were reduced dramatically by the MAIDS infection itself at 3 and 6 weeks after LP-BM5 inoculation. This finding has not been previously reported in mice with MAIDS and suggests that the viral infection itself produces a functional sympathectomy in the spleen, a target of that infection.", 
    "77": "We clarified whether the intraocular pressure (IOP) response elicited by stimulation of the cervical sympathetic nerve (CSN) is influenced by changes in the baseline of IOP level and by beta-adrenergic blockade. The CSN was stimulated electrically for 30 seconds (10 V, 0.1-100 Hz, 2 milliseconds pulse duration) in urethane (100 mg/kg i.v.)-chloralose (50 mg/kg i.v.)-anesthetized, paralyzed cats. The IOP was monitored manometrically, and a controlled saline infusion was delivered into the anterior chamber to gradually increase IOP. CSN stimulation was delivered at the various baseline IOP levels so obtained. When required, a beta-adrenergic blocker timolol (2%) was delivered into the conjunctival cul-de-sac. The normal IOP in our cats was 25+/-3 mmHg. This value decreased transiently on CSN stimulation. The amplitude of this IOP response depended on stimulus frequency and the pre-stimulus baseline IOP level. Topical administration of timolol increased the IOP response to CSN stimulation at a given baseline level. These results suggest that beta-adrenergic blockade increases the alpha-adrenergic mediated-IOP reduction elicited by CSN stimulation at given baseline IOP level.", 
    "78": "We investigated the effects of beta1-adrenoceptor blockade and M2-muscarinic receptor antagonist in rabbits which have developed dilated cardiomyopathy-like changes after immunization with the peptides from the second extracellular loop of human beta1-adrenoceptor (beta1-peptide) and M2-muscarinic receptor (M2-peptide). Ten rabbits, which were immunized with beta1-peptide once a month for one year, were treated with bisoprolol and 10 rabbits, which were immunized with M2-peptide, were treated with otenzepad. Although both groups treated with receptor blockade or antagonist showed an increased titer of anti-beta1-adrenoceptor or anti-M2-muscarinic receptor antibodies, myocardial damages were markedly less than those in beta1-peptide- or M2-peptide-immunized rabbits. This study indicates that anti-beta1-adrenoceptor and anti-M2-muscarinic receptor antibodies are of pathogenic importance in the development of human dilated cardiomyopathy, and that beta-adrenoceptor blockade, bisoprolol, and M2-muscarinic receptor antagonist, otenzepad, might be clinically useful for treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy.",

During an average follow-up of 20 months, the mortality rates were 19.8 percent in the conventional-therapy group and 14.2 percent in the defibrillator group. The hazard ratio for the risk of death from any cause in the defibrillator group as compared with the conventional-therapy group was 0.69 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.51 to 0.93; P=0.016). The effect of defibrillator therapy on survival was similar in subgroup analyses stratified according to age, sex, ejection fraction, New York Heart Association class, and the QRS interval.",

    "83": "Previous studies have shown that the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporine A attenuates arterial baroreceptor function. This study investigated whether the modulatory effect of cyclosporine on baroreceptor function involves inhibition of the baroreflex-facilitatory effect of testosterone. The role of cardiac autonomic control in cyclosporine-testosterone baroreflex interaction was also investigated. Baroreflex curves relating bradycardic responses to increments in blood pressure evoked by phenylephrine were constructed in conscious, sham-operated, castrated rats and in testosterone-replaced castrated (CAS + T) rats in the absence and presence of cyclosporine. The slopes of the curves were taken as an index of the baroreflex sensitivity (BRS). Short-term (11-13 days) cyclosporine treatment or castration reduced plasma testosterone levels and caused similar attenuation of the reflex bradycardia, as indicated by the significantly smaller BRS compared with sham-operated values (-0.97 +/- 0.07, -0.86 +/- 0.06, and -1.47 +/- 0.10 beats/min/mm Hg, respectively). The notion that androgens facilitate baroreflexes is further confirmed by the observation that testosterone replacement of castrated rats restored plasma testosterone and BRS to sham-operated levels. Cyclosporine had no effect on BRS in castrated rats but caused a significant reduction in CAS + T rats. Muscarinic blockade by atropine caused approximately 60% reduction in the BRS in sham-operated rats, an effect that was significantly and similarly diminished by castration, cyclosporine, or their combination. beta-Adrenergic blockade by propranolol caused no significant changes in BRS. These findings suggest that cyclosporine attenuates baroreflex responsiveness via, at least partly, inhibition of the testosterone-induced facilitation of cardiomotor vagal control.", 
    "84": "In adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes, noradrenaline exerts dual effects on protein synthesis: increases via alpha(1)-adrenoceptors and decreases via beta(1)-adrenoceptors. Carvedilol and bucindolol are beta-blockers with additional alpha(1)-adrenoceptor blocking activities. We studied the effects of carvedilol and bucindolol on noradrenaline-induced protein synthesis (assessed by [(3)H]phenylalanine incorporation) in adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes. Radioligand binding studies with [(125)I]iodocyanopindolol and [(3)H]prazosin revealed that carvedilol had a much higher affinity to alpha(1)-adrenoceptors than bucindolol (beta(1)-/alpha(1)-adrenoceptor ratio for carvedilol, 1:2.7; for bucindolol, 1:43). Noradrenaline-evoked increases in protein synthesis were enhanced by propranolol (1 microM) and beta(1)-adrenoceptor-selective antagonists bisoprolol (1 microM) and CGP 20712A [1-[2-((3-carbamoyl-4-hydroxy)phenoxy)-ethyl-amino]-3-[4-(1-methyl-4-trifluoromethyl-2-imidazolyl)phenoxy]-2-propranol methanesulfonate] (300 nM). Carvedilol (100 pM-10 microM) inhibited 1 microM noradrenaline-induced increase in protein synthesis with monophasic concentration-inhibition curves independent of whether CGP 20712A was present or not; K(i) values for carvedilol were 5 to 6 nM. In contrast, bucindolol (100 pM-10 microM) inhibited l microM noradrenaline-induced increase in protein synthesis with a bell-shaped concentration-inhibition curve; it increased noradrenaline-induced protein synthesis at 10 nM, although at concentrations >100 nM it was inhibited. In the presence of 300 nM CGP 20712A or 1 microM propranolol, however, bucindolol inhibited 1 microM noradrenaline-induced increase in protein synthesis with monophasic concentration-inhibition curves; K(i) values were 40 to 75 nM. On the other hand, both carvedilol and bucindolol inhibited 1 microM phenylephrine-induced protein synthesis with monophasic concentration-inhibition curves; K(i) values were 4 (carvedilol) and 45 nM (bucindolol). These results indicate that, at low (beta-adrenoceptor blocking) concentrations, bucindolol can enhance noradrenaline-induced protein synthesis whereas it is inhibited by carvedilol.",

    "91": "Molecular interactions of androgens with the plasma membrane may produce rapid cardiovascular effects that cannot be explained by the classic genomic mechanisms. In this sense, 5 alpha- and 5 beta-dihydrotestosterone-induced an acute positive inotropic effect in isolated left atrium of rat, an effect which may be due to cAMP-dependent mechanisms. To prove this, intracellular levels of cAMP, after exposure to androgens in the organ bath, and binding to beta(1)-adrenoceptors were evaluated. After a 4-min exposure, 5 alpha- and 5 beta-dihydrotestosterone increased cAMP levels from 3.83+/-0.61 to 6.15+/-1.1 and 11.18+/-2.4 pmol cAMP/mg of protein, respectively. These increases were inhibited by atenolol and not modified by treatment of the rats with reserpine. The androgen-induced cAMP increase seems to be produced via an extracellular interaction, because positive inotropism and raised levels of cAMP were produced by 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone conjugated with bovine serum albumin (BSA). In addition, it is independent of beta(1)-adrenoceptor activation, because neither androgen displaced [(3)H]dihydroalprenolol binding. Therefore, the androgens induced a positive inotropic effect via a postsynaptic effect that increases intracellular levels of cAMP. This effect is modulated by transcriptional mechanisms or by a protein with a short half-life.", 
    "92": "1. The effect of vasodilatory beta-adrenoceptor blockers on regional blood flow in the major organs of anaesthetized rats was investigated using radioactive microspheres. The administration of propranolol and saline was used as a control. 2. Intravenous injections of carvedilol (2 mg/rat), celiprolol (20 mg/rat) and bopindolol (1 mg/rat) equally decreased systemic blood pressure (SBP) by approximately 20 mmHg, whereas propranolol (1 mg/rat) decreased SBP only slightly but not significantly. 3. Heart rate was significantly decreased by carvedilol, celiprolol, bopindolol and propranolol. 4. Coronary blood flow was markedly increased by carvedilol, but not by the other three drugs. 5. Cardiac output tended to decrease following the administration of all four drugs. 6. Total peripheral vascular resistance was not significantly affected by carvedilol, celiprolol and bopindolol, but was markedly increased following propranolol. 7. Renal blood flow was markedly increased by carvedilol. 8. Blood flow in the brown fat was markedly increased by carvedilol and bopindolol, but not by celiprolol and propranolol. 9. These findings indicate that the newer vasodilatory beta-blockers, such as carvedilol and bopindolol, have a beneficial effect on the regional circulation in contrast with the classical beta-blocker propranolol. 10. The regional haemodynamic effects observed in the present study following intravenous injection of the beta-blockers may help explain the clinical experience that vasodilatory beta-blockers increase insulin sensitivity and decrease mortality in patients with congestive heart failure.", 
    "93": "Various cardiac lesions such as hypertrophy, disarray and fibrosis similar to HCM, were often found in the heart of methamphetamine (MA) abusers. Myolysis, eosinophilic changes, contraction band necrosis and small round cell infiltration were also observed. Male ddy mouse were administered MA 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every day for 4 weeks. Their hearts revealed many cardiac changes such as hypertrophy, myolysis, contraction band necrosis, disarrangement of myofibers, saw-like cytoplasm, side-to-side connection of cardiac cells and vascuolative degeneration microscopically, and crysterosis of mitochondria, enlargement of sarcoplasmic reticulum and hypercontraction electronmicroscopically. These changes are thought to be similar to that of MA abusers, so it is certified that MA has toxic effect on the heart. Moreover, these changes could not be found when beta-blocker or calcium antagonist was premedicated. To elucidate the mechanisms of MA cardiac toxicity, we have designed some experiments. When MA (15 mg or 20 mg/kg) was administered on rats, cardiac lipid peroxidates, as a marker of free radical, increased rapidly. When rats were feeded for 7 weeks with Vitamin E deficient diet, 10 mg/kg MA administration was enough to increase lipid peroxidates. Simultaneous ECG observation revealed various arrhythmia such as VPB, A-V block and intraventricular conduction delay. In the investigation of contractile protein, although we could not find differences in the isozyme pattern of myosin heavy chain between MA groups (1 mg/kg for 8 and 12 weeks) and control group, Mg2+ ATPase activity of myocardial actomyosin at 0.1 microM Ca2+ increased significantly in 12 weeks MA group. We also found MA induced cardiac toxicity in cultured myocytes. Primary cultured adult rat myocytes were exposed to MA (1 x 10(-5) M and 1 x 10(-3) M) for 1 to 24 h in the presence and absence of 1 x 10(-5) M propranolol. After 24-h MA treatment, cellular granulation, swelling and hypercontraction and release of CPK were observed both with and without propranolol treatment. These findings suggest that MA may exert direct toxic effects on the heart.", 
    "94": "In the current study, first the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced stimulation of the PDGF-beta receptor kinase in human cardiac fibroblasts was examined, and then the possibility of counterbalancing this signal transduction by carvedilol, a beta-blocker with alpha1-blocking properties, was investigated. Human cardiac fibroblasts were cultured from myocardial biopsy samples taken from patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. The stimulation of the PDGF-beta receptor kinase by recombinant human PDGF (BB) in the cells and the inhibitory effect of carvedilol (1, 5, 10, and 20 microM) were investigated by analyzing PDGF-induced PDGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation using Western blotting and by measuring DNA synthesis with a colorimetric assay. In human cardiac fibroblasts, the PDGF receptor kinase could be stimulated with PDGF (100 ng/ml) and inhibited with carvedilol (5 microM). In addition, carvedilol at a concentration of 5 microM significantly decreased DNA synthesis by approximately 50%. The inhibition of PDGF-stimulated mitogenesis by carvedilol at concentrations of 10 and 20 microM was 64 or 75%, respectively. Other beta-adrenoceptor antagonists such as propranolol (10 microM) and metoprolol (10 microM) did not significantly affect the PDGF-induced beta-receptor autophosphorylation. These findings provide novel experimental support for the known beneficial clinical effects of carvedilol in the treatment of chronic heart failure associated with myocardial fibrosis.", 
    "95": "1. In arterial hypertension, aortic wave reflections contribute to determining central systolic and pulse pressures. The present study assessed the central pressure alterations at the level of the common carotid artery following 1 month treatment with perindopril or atenolol and investigated during the 8 h following drug intake. 2. Twenty patients suffering from permanent hypertension were included after a 4 week run-in placebo period in a double-blind, randomized cross-over study comparing the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril with the beta-blocker atenolol during a 4 week treatment period. 3. Before and during the 8 h after drug intake, serial measurements included brachial artery systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SBP and DBP, respectively; mercury sphygmomanometer), carotid artery SBP and pulse pressure (PP; applanation tonometry), aortic pulse wave velocity (Complior; Colson, Les Lilas, France) and arterial wave reflections from the aorta (applanation tonometry; Sphygmocor; PWV Medical, Sydney, NSW, Australia). 4. Both treatments decreased brachial and carotid artery SBP, DBP and PP. Heart rate and pulse wave velocity decreased following atenolol (P < 0.001). Pulse wave velocity was reduced slightly following perindopril (NS). Arterial wave reflections were significantly (P < 0.001) decreased with perindopril in comparison with atenolol, but this effect on wave reflections was not associated with a larger decrease in carotid artery PP. 5. Thus, during chronic treatment, ACE inhibition and selective beta1-adrenoceptor blockade resulted in a similar decrease in brachial and carotid artery PP, but only atenolol reduced heart rate. Aortic pulse wave velocity was reduced with both drugs, but atenolol appeared more effective in improving aortic stiffness. Arterial wave reflections were decreased only following perindopril. 6. Central pulse pressure was improved following 1 month treatment with an ACE inhibitor or beta-adrenoceptor blockade following a decrease in arterial wave reflections with perindopril and a higher decrease in regional aortic stiffness with atenolol.",

The objective of this article is to provide practicing physicians with examples of perioperative beta-blocker use in practice by using several hypothetical cases. Although current evidence describing the effectiveness of perioperative beta-blockade may not address all possible clinical situations, it is possible to formulate an evidence-based approach that will maximize benefit to patients. We describe how information from several sources can be used to guide management of patients with limited exercise tolerance, those at highest risk for perioperative cardiac events, patients who are taking beta-blockers long-term, and those with relative contraindications to beta-blockade. Even though fine points of their use remain to be elucidated, perioperative beta-blocker use is important and can be easily applied in practice by any physician involved with the care of patients perioperatively.",

All studies sought to achieve beta-blockade before the induction of anesthesia by titrating doses to a target heart rate. Of studies reporting myocardial ischemia, numbers needed to treat were modest (2.5-6.7). Similarly modest numbers needed to treat were observed in studies reporting a significant impact on cardiac or all-cause mortality (3.2-8.3). The most marked effects were seen in patients at high risk; the sole study reporting a nonsignificant result enrolled patients with low baseline risk.

This results in an abnormal Ca2+ leak through RyRs, possibly leading to cardiac dysfunction. In the present study, we assess whether beta-blockers can correct this defect in RyR in tachycardia-induced heart failure and thereby improve cardiac function.", 
    "109": "SRs were isolated from dog left ventricular muscles (normal group, 4 weeks of rapid right ventricular pacing with or without propranolol [P(+) or P(-)]). End-diastolic and end-systolic diameters both increased less in P(+) than P(-), associated with a smaller decrease in fractional shortening in P(+). In SR from P(-), a prominent Ca2+ leak was observed, and FK506 (which dissociates FKBP12.6 from RyR) did not induce an additional Ca2+ leak. However, there was no appreciable Ca2+ leak in SR from P(+), although FK506 induced a Ca2+ leak as in normal SRs. In SR from P(+), an FK506-induced conformational change in RyR, which was virtually absent in SR from P(-), was observed as in normal SRs. Both the stoichiometry of FKBP12.6 versus RyR, assessed by [3H]FK506 and [3H]ryanodine binding assays, and the protein expression of FKBP12.6, assessed by Western blot analysis, were restored by propranolol toward the levels seen in normal SRs.", 
    "110": "Low-dose propranolol corrects the defective interaction of FKBP12.6 with RyR (restoration of RyR conformational change and prevention of Ca2+ leak from RyR), apparently resulting in an attenuation of intracellular Ca2+ overload and hence preventing the development of left ventricular remodeling in heart failure.",

The management of IHD in diabetic patients remains a difficult challenge. However, some of these treatments are not as effective or well-tolerated in diabetic patients as in non-diabetic patients. An important effect of diabetes, that in turn influences cardiac function, is the switch from carbohydrate oxidation to free fatty acid and ketone oxidation. The correction of the alterations to cardiac metabolism associated with DM may represent a new approach to the management of IHD in these patients. Results obtained in anginal patients with the metabolic agent trimetazidine and in infarcted patients with glucose-insulin-potassium (GIK) are consistent with this hypothesis.",

The greatest rise in LV EF, reduction of the end diastolic volume, end systolic volume of the left ventricle and functional class was observed in group 1.

A total of 5010 patients with heart failure of NYHA class II, III or IV were randomly assigned to receive 160 mg of valsartan or placebo twice daily. Further angiotensin antagonism by valsartan did not improve survival but was beneficial in terms of morbidity and mortality, because of reduced rate of hospitalization, significant improvements in NYHA class, ejection fraction, signs and symptoms of heart failure, and quality of life. Valsartan had highly favourable effects in patients not receiving ACE inhibitors but an adverse effect in patients receiving both ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers.

Normo-albuminuric essential hypertensives, <50 years old, who had not been previously treated with antihypertensive drugs and who did not have diabetes mellitus were included. After the initial evaluation, patients were treated using only nonpharmacological measures (n=62), beta-blockers (n=38), ACE inhibitors (n=64), calcium channel blockers (n=8), and several classes (n=15). Measurements were taken for office blood pressure, biochemical profile, and 24-hour urinary albumin excretion at the beginning of the study and were measured yearly during an average of 2.7+/-1.2 years of follow-up. Among the 187 patients included, 22 (11,7%) developed microalbuminuria (progressors, 4.4/100 patients/y). No differences were present between progressors and those who remained normo-albuminuric (nonprogressors) in terms of age, gender, body mass index, disease duration, blood pressure values, biochemical profile, familial history of diabetes or hypertension, smoking habits, or the presence of EKG left ventricular hypertrophy. The group with the lowest progression rate was the patients treated with ACE inhibitors (n=5; 2.9/100 patients/y), followed by the diet group (n=5; 3.3/100 patients/y) and the beta-blockers group (n=5; 4.1/100 patients/y). When we excluded patients treated with calcium channel blockers or those who changed over time between different classes of treatment, no significant differences in the incidence of microalbuminuria were observed among the groups. Progressors showed higher slopes of fasting glucose (4.78+/-11.4 versus 0.50+/-6.8 mg/y, P<0.02) and uric acid (0.58+/-0.93 versus 0.05+/-1.10 mg/y, P<0.03) compared with the slopes of nonprogressors. Both the slopes for glucose and systolic blood pressure over time were associated independently with the slope of the logarithm of urinary albumin excretion when adjusted for age, gender, and treatment groups. Cox proportional hazard model for progression of microalbuminuria showed that baseline urinary albumin excretion (risk ratio [RR]=1.06; confidence interval [CI] 95%, 1.01 to 1.11), slope for systolic blood pressure (RR=1.11; CI 95%, 1.03 to 1.20), and slope for glucose (RR=1.08; CI 95%, 1.03 to 1.14) were independently associated to the development of microalbuminuria. In conclusion, in a group of young adults with essential hypertension that had not been previously treated, the main factors influencing the occurrence of microalbuminuria during antihypertensive treatment were the values of microalbuminuria at baseline and the slopes for systolic blood pressure and fasting glucose.", 
    "119": "RyR2 function is regulated by highly conserved signaling pathways that modulate excitation-contraction (EC) coupling. cAMP dependent protein kinase (PKA) phosphorylation of RyR2 plays an important role in regulating channel function in response to stress signaled by the sympathetic nervous system (the classic \"fight or flight response\") (1). PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 induces dissociation of the regulatory protein FKBP12.6 resulting in channels with increased sensitivity to Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release. Under normal physiological conditions (no cardiac damage) PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 is part of an integrated physiological response that leads to increased EC coupling gain and increased cardiac output. PKA-hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 in failing hearts is a maladaptive response that results in depletion of FKBP12.6 from the RyR2 macromolecular complex and defective channel function (pathologically increased sensitivity to Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release) that may cause depletion of SR Ca2+ and diastolic release of SR Ca2+ that can initiate delayed after depolarizations (DADs) that trigger ventricular arrhythmias (1). RyR2 mutations in patients with catecholaminergic induced sudden cardiac death provide further evidence linking the sympathetic nervous system, RyR2 and ventricular arrhythmias (2-4). The chronic hyperadrenergic state of heart failure is associated with defective Ca2+ signaling in part due to PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2.",

    "125": "The objective of this study was to analyse the influence of the composition of the core of the pellets on the in vitro drug release profile. The different materials (drugs and fillers) were chosen according to their relative solubility. Pellets were prepared by a standardised process of extrusion/spheronisation. A selected fraction size (1-1.4 mm diameter) of pellets of each preparation was coated with Surelease (an aqueous dispersion of ethyl cellulose) to give 5% weight gain. The dissolution studies were performed and data analysed in terms of the Area under the Curve (AUC) of the % dissolved as function of time and Mean Dissolution Time (MDT). ANOVA was applied in order to identify the influence factors and the relationship of cross effects. Canonical analysis and multiple regression were employed to quantify these relationships. The film coat was found to be the major factor controlling the drug release. The results however, show that both drug and filler solubility influenced the drug release profile. Some of the unusual results could only be explained if consideration was given to the physical characteristics of both powder and pellets. In particular, the specific surface area of calcium phosphate compared with other fillers played an important role on the release profile of the model drug.",

We have now used autoradiographic receptor binding techniques to determine the location of 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B binding sites in the laminated optic tectum. 5-HT1A binding sites, as labeled with [3H]8-hydroxy-dipropylaminotetralin (8-OH-DPAT), were highest in the superficial, retinorecipient layers of the tectum, intermediate in layers 6 and 7 and low in the remaining layers. Binding densities in all of these layers were unaffected by optic nerve lesion. 5-HT1B binding sites were visualized using [125I]iodocyanopindolol (ICYP). Binding densities were highest in the plexiform layers 5 and 7 and intermediate in layers 6 and 8. Binding sites were present at low levels in layer 9; however, optic nerve lesion resulted in a strong upregulation of these sites in this layer. Pharmacological manipulation of receptor activation resulted in changes in the activity-dependent visual map that is created at the tectum by retinal ganglion cell terminals. Chronic treatment of the tectum with SB-224289, a selective antagonist of 5-HT1B receptors, disrupted the topographic map. In contrast, exposure to WAY-100635, a selective antagonist of 5-HT1A receptors, refined it. We conclude that both 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors are present in the adult frog tectum and that changes in their activation levels can produce changes in retinotectal transmission levels that drive visual plasticity in opposite directions.", 
    "127": "A method is described for measuring the activity of G(s)-coupled receptors in a nonradioactive homogeneous membrane-based assay. This method has several major advantages over currently used methods for measuring functional activity of G(s)-coupled receptors. The assay is high throughput (>150,000 data points/day using a single reader). Dimethyl sulfoxide tolerance is high ( approximately 10%). Compared to complex cell-based assays, there is limited potential for nonspecific compound action. This resulted in low compound hit rates in robustness screening, where hit rates from a simulated screen were 1.0% (antagonist screen) and 0.1% (agonist screen). No continuous cell culture is required for the assay, reducing cell culture overheads and allowing the screen to run every day. Automation is simple and requires no temperature- or humidity-controlled incubation. No radioactivity is required. The method relies on measurement of cyclic AMP (cAMP) generation by fluorescence polarization assay using commercially available reagents. Membranes (1-2 microg protein per well, containing anti-cAMP antibody) are transferred to 384-well plates containing 1 microl test compound. For antagonist screens, agonist is added 15 min later. After 30 min incubation at room temperature, one further assay reagent (fluorescein-cAMP in a buffer containing detergent) is added. The signal may be read after 1 h and is stable for greater than 12 h. Typical Z' for the assay is approximately 0.5.", 
    "128": "The multidrug transporter MDR1 (P-glycoprotein)-mediated interaction between digoxin and 29 antihypertensive drugs of various types was examined by using the MDR1 overexpressing LLC-GA5-COL150 cells, which were established by transfecting MDR1 cDNA into porcine kidney epithelial LLC-PK1 cells. These cells construct monolayers with tight junctions, and enable the evaluation of transcellular transport. The MDR1 was highly expressed on the apical membrane (urine side). The basal-to-apical and apical-to-basal transcellular transport of [3H]digoxin in LLC-GA5-COL150 cells was time- and temperature-dependent. The basal-to-apical transport of [3H]digoxin was markedly increased, whereas the apical-to-basal transport was decreased in LLC-GA5-COL150 cells, compared with the host LLC-PK1 cells, suggesting that [3H]digoxin was a substrate for MDR1. Most of the Ca2+ channel blockers used here markedly inhibited basal-to-apical transport and increased apical-to-basal transport. Exceptions were diltiazem, nifedipine and nitrendipine, which hardly showed inhibitory effects on transcellular transport of [3H]digoxin. Alpha-blocker doxazosin and beta-blocker carvedilol also inhibited transcellular transport of [3H]digoxin, but none of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and AT1 angiotensin II receptor antagonists used here were active. These observations will promote understanding of the digoxin-drug interactions resulting from their actions on MDR1, and which may aid in avoiding these unexpected effects of digoxin.",

Numerous measures of cardiac remodeling and neurohormonal activation, however, have proven to be reliable predictors of disease progression and therapeutic response. These findings have contributed significantly to the current understanding of heart failure pathophysiology and approach to treatment. Specifically, measures such as left-ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) and, potentially, b-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) concentrations may correlate with disease progression and parallel the mortality reductions observed with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and beta-blocker therapy.",

After adjustment for age, the peak exercise capacity measured in metabolic equivalents (MET) was the strongest predictor of the risk of death among both normal subjects and those with cardiovascular disease. Absolute peak exercise capacity was a stronger predictor of the risk of death than the percentage of the age-predicted value achieved, and there was no interaction between the use or nonuse of beta-blockade and the predictive power of exercise capacity.

Rats were instrumented with chronic artery and vein catheters and assigned randomly to four diabetic groups pretreated with vehicle (D), L-NAME (D+L), the alpha(1)- and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists terazosin and propranolol (D+B), or L-NAME, terazosin, and propranolol (D+LB). After baseline measurements were taken, rats were pretreated; 6 days later, streptozotocin was administered and 3 wk of diabetes ensued. D+L rats had a marked, progressive increase in arterial pressure that by day 20 was approximately 60 mmHg greater than in D rats. The pressor response to L-NAME was significantly attenuated in diabetic rats cotreated with adrenergic blockers. During week 1 of diabetes, plasma renin activity (PRA) increased and then returned to control levels in D rats. PRA increased progressively in D+L rats, and chronic adrenergic receptor blockade restored the biphasic renin response in D+LB rats. These results suggest that the sympathetic nervous system may be involved in the hypertensive response to onset of diabetes in L-NAME-treated rats, possibly through control of renin secretion.",

    "149": "Patients prescribed beta-blockers had significantly lower mean C-reactive protein concentrations than did patients in whom these were not prescribed (by 1.2 mg/L, or 40% difference in geometric mean concentration; P <0.001). This association remained significant (P = 0.03) after excluding patients with contraindications to the use of beta-blockers, and adjusting for the probability of beta-blocker therapy (propensity score) and other clinical predictors of C-reactive protein concentration, including body mass index, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, family history of coronary artery disease, and angiographic severity. No differences among types or dosages of beta-blockers were evident.",

    "152": "We examined the care of 112,900 fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries aged > or = 65 years who resided in one of 320 metropolitan statistical areas and who were admitted with an acute myocardial infarction between February 1994 through July 1995. Use of recommended medical treatments and 30-day survival were determined for areas with low (<10%), medium (10% to 30%), and high (>30%) managed care market share.", 
    "153": "After adjustment for severity of illness, teaching status of the admission hospital, and area characteristics, areas with high levels of managed care had greater use of beta-blockers (relative risk [RR] for greater use = 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06 to 1.29) and aspirin at discharge (RR = 1.05; 95% CI: 1.02 to 1.07), but less appropriate coronary angiography (RR = 0.93; 95% CI: 0.86 to 1.01) and reperfusion (RR = 0.95; 95% CI: 0.85 to 1.03) when compared with areas with low levels of managed care.", 
    "154": "Medicare beneficiaries with fee-for-service insurance who resided in areas with high managed care activity were more likely to have received appropriate treatment with beta-blockers and aspirin, and less likely to have undergone coronary angiography following admission for myocardial infarction. Thus, the effects of managed care may not be limited to managed care enrollees.", 
    "155": "There are reports of serious hypotension or circulatory shock when sildenafil citrate, a selective cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, which was developed for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, is given to patients taking certain coronary vasodilators. We thus examined the interaction of sildenafil with various coronary vasodilators including nitric oxide (NO) donors in isolated porcine coronary artery. Sildenafil caused concentration-dependent relaxations of the artery precontracted with U46619 (9,11-dideoxy-9 alpha,11 alpha-methanoepoxy-prostaglandin F(2alpha)). Incubation with the NO synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine or the soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor ODQ (1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-alpha]quinoxalin-1-one) significantly shifted the concentration-response curve for sildenafil to the right without affecting the maximum response, indicating that some part of the relaxant response to sildenafil may be the result of the inhibition of phosphodiestrase type 5-induced degradation of cyclic GMP (cGMP) that is produced through guanylate cyclase activation by NO released spontaneously. The relaxant effects of the vasodilators with an NO donor property, isosorbide dinitrate, sodium nitroprusside, nicorandil and nipradilol, were significantly enhanced by sildenafil, as shown by a significant leftward shift of their concentration-response curves. In contrast, the relaxant responses to the drugs without a property as an NO donor, diltiazem, celiprolol and pinacidil, were not affected by sildenafil. The cGMP level of the tissue was elevated after adding sildenafil, and the cGMP-generating effect of a combination of sildenafil and sodium nitroprusside was higher than that of each drug alone. The cyclic AMP level determined simultaneously was not changed by sildenafil. These results suggest that sildenafil potentiates specifically the relaxant responses of porcine coronary artery to the drugs which behave as an NO donor, providing basic evidence that the benefit of sildenafil in the treatment of erectile dysfunction can be limited by a risk of marked vasodilation when used together with NO-related coronary vasodilators.", 
    "156": "We report a case of a child with familial long QT syndrome (Jervell Lange-Nielsen) who had multiple electrical storms in the presence of b blocker and implantable cardioverter device (ICD) therapy. Discontinuation of ICD therapy and addition of oral amiodarone to b blockade therapy resulted in freedom from electrical storms.", 
    "157": "Specific ion channel mutations underlie the congenital long-QT syndrome (LQTS). However, the mechanisms by which dysfunction at the molecular level translates into functional electrical instability leading to torsade de pointes (TdP) in LQTS are poorly understood.", 
    "158": "The cellular basis of TdP was investigated using a novel approach of transmural optical imaging in the canine wedge preparation (n=14). The spatial organization of repolarization and arrhythmogenesis were determined in a surrogate model of LQT2. Action potentials were recorded simultaneously from 128 sites spanning the transmural wall of the left ventricle. In LQT2, QT interval prolongation was paralleled by an abrupt rise in transmural dispersion of repolarization (DOR) from 2.7 plus/minus 0.9 ms/mm (controls) to 12.2 plus/minus 2.1 ms/mm (LQT2). Islands of midmyocardial (M) cells formed zones of increased refractoriness in LQT2, producing steep spatial gradients of repolarization that were directly responsible for conduction block and self-sustained intramural reentrant circuits underlying TdP.", 
    "159": "These data provide direct evidence supporting the functional expression of M cells in intact myocardium and a central role for M cells in the development of reentrant TdP arrhythmias in LQTS.",

    "161": "We looked at evidence of clinical deterioration in the Metoprolol CR/XL Randomized Intervention Trial in Congestive Heart Failure (MERIT-HF) by analyzing events and symptoms during the first 90 days. During titration, the Kaplan-Meier curves for the combined end point of all-cause mortality/all-cause hospitalization were similar in all patients randomized, with no significant difference in favor of placebo at any visit or in any of the analyzed subgroups (New York Heart Association class II, III/IV, or III/IV with ejection fraction <0.25, heart rate less-than-or-equal 76 bpm, and systolic blood pressure less-than-or-equal 120 mm Hg). The curves started to diverge in favor of beta-blockade after 60 days. Low heart rate was the main factor that limited titration. In New York Heart Association class III/IV, 5.9% of the patients receiving placebo discontinued study medicine during the first 90 days compared with 8.1% of those receiving metoprolol CR/XL (P=0.037 unadjusted, P=NS adjusted); corresponding figures in those with New York Heart Association class III/IV and ejection fraction <0.25 were 7.1% and 8.0% (P=NS). From day 90 until the end of the study, more patients in the placebo group discontinued study medicine in all subgroups. There was no change in diuretic or ACE inhibitor dosing with beta-blocker titration. Most patients reported no change in symptoms of breathlessness or fatigue during the titration phase.",

We identified 630 patients with unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction hospitalized between 1996 and 1999. We frequency matched these case patients to 10,486 control subjects according to clinic location, and randomly assigned each an \"index date.\" The computerized pharmacy database at each center was used to ascertain beta-agonist use.

    "165": "In comparison with patients who had not filled a beta-agonist prescription during the 90 days prior to their index date, patients who had filled a beta-agonist prescription had an increased risk of experiencing an acute coronary syndrome. The increased risk of an acute coronary syndrome persisted after adjusting for age and cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes, and smoking history. Moreover, there was a dose-response relationship with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 1.38 for one to two metered-dose inhaler (MDI) canisters (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.86 to 2.23), an OR of 1.57 for three to five MDI canisters (95% CI, 1.01 to 2.46), and an OR of 1.93 for six or more MDI canisters (95% CI, 1.23 to 3.03). After stratifying for receipt of a beta-blocker prescription, the adjusted OR in subjects who did not receive a beta-blocker was 1.55 for one to two MDI canisters (95% CI, 0.60 to 3.99), an OR of 4.07 for three to five canisters (95% CI, 2.17 to 7.64), and an OR of 3.83 for six or more canisters (95% CI, 2.02 to 7.29).

Patients in Group 2 (n=72) received totally 1200 mg intravenous/24 h amiodarone which the 300 mg - bolus dose/1 h was given as soon as the operation had been finished. On the next day patients were administered 450 mg/24 h amiodarone i.v. and 600 mg/day in three doses P.O. were given until discharge.

The medical resource consumption from CIBIS II was combined with Swedish cost data for medication and hospitalisations. Costs of added years of life, i.e. consumption net of production, were also included in the analysis. The health effects were measured in terms of gained years of life. The results of the analysis show that the cost-effectiveness of bisoprolol compares favourably with that of other cardiovascular treatments. Without the inclusion of costs of added years of life, the cost-effectiveness was in the range of SEK 3,351-13,096 per gained year of life, and with the costs of added years of life included, the cost-effectiveness was in the range of SEK 137,533-147,278 per gained year of life.", 
    "181": "Recent advances in the recognition and the treatment of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) have lead to an improvement in patient survival and definition of newer guidelines. Current strategies for the treatment of patients with non-ST-elevation ACS include anti-ischemic and antiplatelet medications. While aspirin, beta-blockers, heparin and nitrates are still common practice, the advent of newer anticoagulants (low molecular weight heparins) and antiplatelet agents (glycoprotein llb/IIIa inhibitors and thienopyridines like ticlopidin and clopidogrel) and, possibly, aggressive lipid lowering with statins have added significant benefits to the treatment options with a better prognosis for these patients. Moreover, aggressive medical strategies seem to be justified not only in high-risk patients but also in those that undergo an early invasive approach.", 
    "182": "Controlled clinical trials, performed in more than 16,000 patients to date, have consistently shown the beneficial effects of long-term beta-blocker therapy in patients with chronic heart failure. However, it is not clear whether this represents a class effect or it is specific only to some agents. Beneficial effects on the prognosis of the patients with mild to moderate heart failure have been shown with metoprolol, bisoprolol, and carvedilol. However, these beta-blockers differ in their pharmacological characteristics. Metoprolol and bisoprolol are selective for beta 1-adrenergic receptors and are devoid of ancillary properties. Carvediol, at doses of 50 mg daily, blocks all beta 1-, beta 2-, and alpha 1- adrenergic receptors, and has associated antiproliferative and antioxidant activities. These differences cause a different acute hemodynamic response with a reduction in cardiac output and a tendency to a rise in pulmonary wedge pressure with selective agents and no change in cardiac output and a slight decrease in pulmonary pressures with carvedilol. Accordingly, when the therapy is started, the most frequent side effects are worsening heart failure with metoprolol and bisoprolol and hypotension and dizziness with carvedilol. It is still controversial whether these differences may also influence the long-term effects of therapy. Differently from selective beta-blockers, carvedilol does not upregulate beta 1-receptors, blocks all adrenergic receptors, decreases cardiac norepinephrine release, thus providing a more comprehensive blockade of the cardiac adrenergic drive. These properties have caused a larger increase in LV function and a lack of improvement in maximal exercise capacity with carvedilol, compared to selective beta-blockers. It is however, unclear whether these differences may also influence the patients' outcome.", 
    "183": "Treatments for acute myocardial infarctions (AMIs) have advanced over the past few decades. Although AMIs are considered medical emergencies, continuing research has provided protocols and guidelines that significantly decrease mortality and reinfarction rates. Beta-blockers and aspirin are considered standard treatment for post-AMI patients; however, studies involving the elderly reveal that this population is less likely to receive beta-blocker and aspirin therapy. This article discusses current recommendations and treatments for post-AMI elderly patients."
