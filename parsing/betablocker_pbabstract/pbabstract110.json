    "1": "Chronotropic incompetence (CI) is common in heart failure (HF) patients and is associated with worsening outcome. Detecting and tracking functional CI during activities of daily living could provide insight into its contribution to HF symptoms and facilitate effective HF patient management. HF patients (n\u2009=\u2009180, NYHA Class III/IV, ejection fraction (EF) \u226440%) were enrolled in a multi-center prospective monitoring study and had an external multi-sensor system applied to the chest and replaced weekly during a 90-day study. Medical information was collected at baseline and study close. Heart rate, respiration, activity, and body fluid data from the system were transmitted at regular intervals and used for offline analysis. Patients were primarily male (70%), with 61\u2009\u00b1\u200913\u00a0years mean age, 25\u2009\u00b1\u20095\u00a0kg/m(2) BMI, and 28\u2009\u00b1\u20097% EF. By correlating age-adjusted activity level and heart rate adaptation with a proprietary algorithm, functional CI was detected in 45% and ruled out in 29% of patients under conditions of daily living. In the remaining patients (26%), functional CI assessment was indeterminate due to insufficient age-adjusted activity level. Functional CI and No-CI groups were not significantly different in terms of baseline demographics, characteristics or HF outcome over the study period. \u03b2-blocker use was 16% in the CI group and 82% in the no-CI group (p\u2009<\u20090.001), and therefore, could not explain the manifestation of functional CI. This proof-of-concept study suggests that a chronotropic response that may be functionally debilitating during activities of daily living in HF patients can be detected and tracked in a point-of-care telemonitoring approach using a non-invasive, adherent device.", 
    "2": "Treatment with the selective \u03b2(3)-adrenoceptor agonist BRL 37344 increased circulating levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) in mice without causing hepatocellular injury. To clarify whether this was a \u03b2(3)-adrenoceptor-mediated effect, the inhibitory effect of the selective \u03b2(3)-adrenoceptor antagonist SR 59230A on the increase in circulating transaminase levels induced by BRL 37344 was examined. A single intraperitoneal dose of BRL 37344 alone initially increased insulin and non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) dose-proportionally at 0.5 hr post-dose, findings considered attributable to \u03b2(3)-adrenoceptor-stimulating effects. Levels of the gluconeogenic precursors pyruvate (PA) and lactate (LA) were increased corresponding to the change in insulin. Thereafter, glucose (GLU) level was decreased at 4 and 8 hr post-dose, suggesting disruption of glucose homeostasis. In association with these changes in glucose metabolism, transaminase levels were increased maximally at 4 hr post-dose. The transaminase changes were not accompanied by increases in circulating levels of other hepatocellular enzymes, including guanine deaminase (GUA), glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), or any morphological hepatocellular injury. Intraperitoneal pre-treatment with SR 59230A partly inhibited the effects of BRL 37344 alone, indicating that the increase in levels of circulating ALT by BRL 37344 was attributable to a \u03b2(3)-adrenoceptor-stimulating effect. In conclusion, the \u03b2(3)-adrenoceptor agonist BRL 37344 was shown to increase circulating transaminase levels in mice accompanied with dynamic changes in glucose metabolism. These findings suggest the possibility that circulating transaminase levels are increased as pharmacological effects of drugs disrupting glucose metabolism, and that hepatotoxic markers should be selected considering these effects to distinguish between acceptable pharmacology and toxicity.",

When the model drugs were nasally administered to rats, 5 of the 17 model drugs were delivered to a significant extent to the brain via the direct pathway. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that the correlation between various physicochemical properties and F(a, direct) was not statistically significant, indicative of a lack of primary physicochemical determinants in the direct transport pathway. Transporters such as rOAT3 and rOCT2 were expressed at significant levels in rat olfactory epithelia, and uptakes of standard substrates were significantly decreased in HEK293 cells expressing rOAT3 and rOCT2 in the presence of the five model drugs that were delivered to appreciable extents to the brain via the direct pathway.

The chromatographic separation in both mixtures was achieved by using an RP-C8 (octylsilyl) analytical column. For Mixture I, a mobile phase composed of acetonitrile-0.05 M disodium hydrogen phosphate-triethylamine (50 + 50 + 0.2, v/v/v), pH 2.5, was used; the detector wavelength was 247 nm. For Mixture II, the mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile-0.05 M disodium hydrogen phosphate (50 + 50, v/v), pH 4.0, and the detector was set at 220 nm. Quantification of the analytes was based on measuring their peak areas. Both mixtures were resolved in less than 6 min. The reliability and analytical performance of the proposed HPLC procedures were statistically validated with respect to linearity, range, precision, accuracy, selectivity, robustness, LOD, and LOQ. The linear dynamic ranges were 2.5-150 and 2.5-500 microg/mL for chlordiazepoxide HCI and mebeverine HCI, respectively, and 0.25-200 and 0.25-150 microg/mL for carvedilol and hydrochlorothiazide, respectively.

In this study the effect of pretreatment of carvedilol on adrenaline-induced changes in the serum electrolytes (Mg2+, K+, Ca2+, Na+) was evaluated in rats. Adrenaline was administered at a dose of 2 mg/kg body weight subcutaneously 2 injections 24 hours apart and serum electrolytes were estimated at 12 hours, 24 hours and 7 days after the 2nd injection of adrenaline. Adrenaline administration initially caused hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia and hyponatremia, which were restored to normal spontaneously within 7 days. Pretreatment of carvedilol orally at a dose of 1 mg/kg body weight for 2 weeks significantly prevented initial reduction in serum electrolyte levels induced by adrenaline. It was concluded that prophylactic use of carvedilol might prevent the serious consequences of myocardial infarction as sudden cardiac death due to arrhythmia caused by electrolyte changes.",

    "34": "This study investigated the effect on the uterus of the aqueous fraction of the partitioned methanol crude extract of the leaves of Anthocleista djalonensis (AD) and the possible mechanism of AD activity. AD inhibited the concentration-response curves induced by oxytocin and CaCl2 on the rat uterus in vitro and significantly reduced the EC50 in a concentration-dependent manner (p\u00a0< 0.05). A similar effect was observed with salbutamol and verapamil on the concentration-response curves obtained for oxytocin and CaCl2. The inhibitory effect of AD was not attenuated in the presence of propranolol. AD, salbutamol, and verapamil also produced a concentration-dependent relaxation on K+-induced sustained uterine contraction. In Ca2+-free medium, AD and salbutamol similarly inhibited oxytocin-induced contraction, but verapamil failed to produce this effect. The present results suggest that AD, being a mixture of phytochemicals, probably exerts inhibitory activity on in vitro uterine contractions of the nonpregnant, diethylstilboestrol-treated rat by multiple mechanisms that do not involve interaction with &beta;-adrenergic receptors and do not solely depend on inhibition of calcium influx.", 
    "35": "Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a cholestatic liver disease with high propensity to develop into cholangiocarcinoma. The hepatobiliary disorder of PSC is due to progressive fibrosis surrounding the intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts. Until now, no effective medical therapy exists. To study the progression of sclerosing cholangitis after inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system by blockade of the \u03b2-adrenoceptors, we used the Mdr2(-/-) mouse model, which develops periportal fibrosis similar to human PSC. Liver tissues of Mdr2(-/-) mice untreated or treated with the \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol were analyzed for inflammation and fibrosis progression at different time points by histological scoring and immunostaining for \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), CD45 and S100A4. Transaminases and hydroxyproline contents were determined. Expression of angiotensinogen, endothelin-1, TGF-\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, CTGF and procollagen 1A1 was studied by real-time PCR on laser-microdissected areas of acinar zones I and II-III. After 3 months, periportal fibrosis had developed in Mdr2(-/-) mice, but immunostaining revealed no sinusoidal and only minor periportal contribution of myofibroblasts with prominent fibroblasts. Propranolol treatment of Mdr2(-/-) mice improved liver architecture. Additionally, inflammation and fibrosis were significantly reduced. After 3 months of treatment, the antifibrotic effect of the \u03b2-blockade was most obvious. The transcript levels of procollagen 1A1, TNF-\u03b1, TGF-\u03b2, CTGF and endothelin-1 were markedly repressed in the portal areas of treated mice. Taken together, these data show that propranolol efficiently delays progression of sclerosing cholangitis. Therefore, the blockade of \u03b2-adrenoceptors is a promising option to support future therapeutic strategies in the treatment of human PSC.",

    "41": "Several substances such as growth hormone (GH), erythropoietin (Epo), and anabolic steroids (AS) are improperly utilized to increase the performance of athletes. Evaluating the potential cancer risk associated with doping agents is difficult since these drugs are often used at very high doses and in combination with other licit or illicit drugs. The GH, via its mediator, the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), is involved in the development and progression of cancer. Animal studies suggested that high levels of GH/IGF-1 increase progression of androgen-independent prostate cancer. Clinical data regarding prostate cancer are mostly based on epidemiological studies or indirect data such as IGF-1 high levels in patients with prostate cancer. Even if experimental studies showed a correlation between Epo and cancer, no clinical data are currently available on cancer development related to Epo as a doping agent. Androgens are involved in prostate carcinogenesis modulating genes that regulate cell proliferation, apoptosis and angiogenesis. Most information on AS is anecdotal (case reports on prostate, kidney and testicular cancers). Prospective epidemiologic studies failed to support the hypothesis that circulating androgens are positively associated with prostate cancer risk. Currently, clinical and epidemiological studies supporting association between doping and urological neoplasias are not available. Nowadays, exposure to doping agents starts more prematurely with a consequent longer exposition period; drugs are often used at very high doses and in combination with other licit or illicit drugs. Due to all these elements it is impossible to predict all the side effects, including cancer; more detailed studies are therefore necessary.",

    "49": "The mechanisms of sinoatrial node (SAN) dysfunction in heart failure (HF) remain unclear. We hypothesized that impaired rhythmic spontaneous sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release (Ca(2+) clock) plays an important role in SAN dysfunction in HF. HF was induced in canine hearts by rapid ventricular pacing. The location of pacemaking sites was determined in vivo using computerized electrical mapping in acute open-chest preparations (normal, n = 3; and HF, n = 4). Isoproterenol (Iso, 0.2 \u03bcg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1)) infusion increased heart rate and shifted the pacemaking site to the superior SAN in all normal hearts. However, in failing hearts, Iso did not induce superior shift of the pacemaking site despite heart rate acceleration. Simultaneous optical recording of intracellular Ca(2+) and membrane potential was performed in Langendorff-perfused isolated right atrium (RA) preparations from normal (n = 7) and failing hearts (n = 6). Iso increased sinus rate, enhanced late diastolic Ca(2+) elevation (LDCAE), and shifted the pacemaking sites to the superior SAN in all normal but in none of the HF RAs. Caffeine (2 ml, 20 mmol/l) caused LDCAE and increased heart rate in four normal RAs but in none of the three HF RAs. Iso induced ectopic beats from lower crista terminalis in five of six HF RAs. These ectopic beats were suppressed by ZD-7288, a specific pacemaker current (I(f)) blocker.

    "50": "The main clinical manifestations of advanced chronic heart failure (CHF), e.g. in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), are reduced systolic and diastolic functions, increased arterial elastance and arterio-ventricular uncoupling, accompanied and exacerbated by an excessive sympathetic activation and extensive abnormalities in the \u03b2AR signaling. Loss of cardiomyocytes due to apoptosis is one mechanism that undoubtedly contributes to cardiac remodeling and functional deterioration associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Research during the last decade on the single cardiomyocyte level strongly suggested that selective stimulation of \u03b2(1) AR activates the proapoptotic signaling pathways, while selective stimulation of \u03b2(2) AR is antiapoptotic, but its precise mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Extensive research in the rat model of DCM following induction of myocardial infarction (MI) showed that prolonged treatment with of \u03b2(2) AR agonist, fenoterol, in combination with a \u03b2(1) AR blocker, metoprolol, is more effective than \u03b2(1) AR blocker alone and as effective as \u03b2(1) AR blocker with ACE inhibitor with respect to survival and cardiac remodeling. This combined regimen of \u03b2(2) AR agonists and a \u03b2(1) AR blocker might be considered for clinical testing as alternative or adjunct therapy to currently acceptable CHF arsenal.

In this study, overloaded peak shapes resulting after injection of carefully pH matched samples close to the pK(a) of the chosen solute are investigated primarily on two columns; one hybrid silica C18 column (Kromasil Eternity) and one purely polymeric column (PLRP-S), the latter lacking C18 ligands. It was found that distorted peaks of the basic test compound appear even though there is no difference in pH between the injected sample solution and the eluent; the previous explanation to why these effects occur is based on a pH mismatch. Thus, the unusual band shapes are not due to an initial pH difference. Furthermore, it was observed that the effect does not appear on polymeric columns without C18 ligands, but only on columns with C18 ligands, independently of the base matrix (silica, hybrid silica, polymeric).", 
    "52": "Ventricular tachycardia (VT) may be monomorphic or polymorphic. Although commonly related to organic heart disease, a significant percentage of VTs are idiopathic (occurring in patients with otherwise normal hearts). Correctly identifying the substrate and mechanism of the tachycardia is essential for proper management. Although therapy for monomorphic VT associated with structural heart disease focuses on tachycardia suppression and reduction of sudden cardiac death (SCD) risk, idiopathic monomorphic VT generally does not entail an increased risk of SCD and treatment is aimed primarily at symptom reduction. Polymorphic VT associated with ischemia or an acquired precipitant that prolongs the QT interval should prompt reversal of underlying cause, in contrast to the congenital arrhythmia syndromes, which demand genetic testing to define the underlying problem. This review describes the diagnosis, mechanisms, etiology, and management of monomorphic and polymorphic VT, with attention to recent advances in biological understanding and the most current therapeutic recommendations.",

To assess the impact of digoxin therapy on outcomes in the current era of heart failure therapy, the authors analyzed data representing 5010 patients enrolled in the Valsartan Heart Failure Trial (Val-HeFT) to examine the relationship of baseline digoxin use and all-cause mortality, first morbid event, and heart failure hospitalizations. At baseline, 3374 patients (67%) were receiving digoxin therapy and 1636 (33%) were not. Patients receiving digoxin had features of worse heart failure with higher New York Heart Association class and lower blood pressure, ejection fraction, and \u03b2-blocker use (32.1% vs 40.8%). Digoxin use was associated with worse mortality (21.1 vs 15.0%, P<.001), first morbid event (34.6 vs 21.7, P<.001), and HF hospitalization rate (19.1 vs 10.1%, P<.001). After adjustment for baseline group differences including medical therapy and baseline rhythm, patients receiving digoxin remained at a higher risk for all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-1.57), first morbid event (HR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.15-1.59), and heart failure hospitalization (HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.12-1.78). These results remained materially unchanged with propensity matched analysis.

They may also modulate \u03b2-adrenoceptors, causing functional responses in rat atria and tracheal smooth muscle. The aim of this study was to determine whether polyamines interact with human \u03b2(1)- and \u03b2(2)-adrenoceptors and the functional consequences of such an interaction. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with human \u03b2(1)- and \u03b2(2)-adrenoceptors were used to evaluate the effect of polyamines binding to \u03b2-adrenoceptors, cAMP production and morphological changes, which were pharmacologically validated by investigating the effects of the \u03b2-adrenoceptor agonists, isoproterenol and salbutamol. Polyamines interacted with human \u03b2(1)- and \u03b2(2)-adrenoceptors, as shown by the displacement of [(125)I]iodocyanopindolol in the binding assay. Putrescine showed higher affinity to \u03b2(1)- than \u03b2(2)-adrenoceptors. Spermidine and spermine produced partial displacement (approximately 50%) and, at the highest concentration, the effect was reversed. Putrescine and spermine acutely increased cAMP and, in a serum-free medium, induced a stellate-like form in cells, which was inhibited by propranolol, a \u03b2-blocker. A 10 to 15 h incubation with putrescine produced a spindle-like form and spatial organization via \u03b2-adrenoceptor activation, evidenced by the antagonizing effect by propranolol and lack of effect in wild-type CHO cells. Additionally, it decreased cell proliferation independently of \u03b2-adrenoceptor activation. Spermine caused cell death via fetal bovine serum-dependent and -independent mechanisms. The results suggest that putrescine may act as a non-selective and low affinity agonist of human \u03b2(1)- and \u03b2(2)-adrenoceptors, eliciting morphological changes. These findings may be of importance in physiology and in diseases involving \u03b2-adrenoceptor functionality.",

The efficacy and safety of once-daily extended-release carvedilol (carvedilol CR) combined with the ACEI lisinopril in a double-blind, randomized, factorial design study were studied. Patients (N=656) with stage 1 or 2 hypertension were randomized evenly to 1 of 15 groups for 6 weeks: carvedilol CR monotherapy 20 mg, 40 mg, or 80 mg/d; lisinopril monotherapy 10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg/d; or 1 of 9 combinations of carvedilol CR plus lisinopril initiated simultaneously. Primary efficacy measures (assessed by ambulatory BP monitoring [ABPM]) were change from baseline in 24-hour mean diastolic BP (DBP) and in trough (20-24 hours) DBP. Continuous efficacy variables were assessed using analysis of covariance. Whether any combination dose was superior to its monotherapy components was assessed using the Hung AVE procedure. Despite the presence of additional BP lowering observed with most of the combinations compared with their monotherapy components, the Hung AVE test was not significant for either primary efficacy measures. Post hoc analyses of the high-dose combination groups (carvedilol CR/lisinopril regimens of 80/10 mg, 80/20 mg, 80/40 mg, 20/40 mg, and 40/40 mg) showed a significant treatment difference compared with both carvedilol CR 80 mg and lisinopril 40 mg for 24-hour mean DBP but not for trough DBP. With the exception of dizziness, individual adverse events did not increase with ascending doses or combinations. The superiority of initiating combination treatment with carvedilol CR and lisinopril compared with the monotherapy components was not demonstrated with the ABPM measurements. Nonetheless, the post hoc assessment combining all high-dose groups did produce significant 24-hour mean BP reduction when compared with the high-dose monotherapy groups.

Hypertension plays a critical role in the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), but it has also been postulated that antihypertensive drugs that block the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) show class-specific renoprotective actions beyond their blood pressure (BP)-lowering effects. 2. Because this notion has recently been questioned, in the present study we compared the effects of a RAS-dependent antihypertensive therapy (a combination of trandolapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and losartan, an angiotensin-II (AngII) receptor subtype 1A receptor antagonist) with a 'RAS-independent' antihypertensive therapy (a combination of labetalol, an alfa- and beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist with the diuretics, hydrochlorothiazide and furosemide) on the progression of CKD after 5/6 renal ablation (5/6 NX) in Ren-2 renin transgenic rats (TGR), a model of AngII-dependent hypertension.

When equal lowering of BP was achieved, leading to normotension, cardio- and renoprotective effects were equivalent irrespective of the type of antihypertensive therapy. 4.

The extraction ratios (E) for all drugs were significantly lower (p<0.05) in fibrotic than in normal livers and the decrease in E was consistent with the decrease in intrinsic clearance and permeability-surface area product. In addition, other than for furosemide, the mean transit times for all drugs were significantly longer (p<0.01) in the fibrotic livers than in normal livers. Pharmacokinetic model and stepwise regression analyses suggest that these differences arise from a reduction in both the transport of drugs across the basolateral membrane and their metabolic clearance and were in a manner similar to those previously found for another group of drugs.", 
    "101": "Left ventricular remodelling is a progressive process, which starts immediately after acute myocardial infarction and evolves in the chronic phase of heart failure. It is characterized by left ventricular chamber dilatation and increased wall stress, which results in alteration of the contractile properties of the non-infarct zone and impairment of the systolic and diastolic performances of the left ventricle. Neurohormonal activation and increased sympathetic stimulation are among the factors that have been linked to the development and progression of left ventricular dysfunction after acute myocardial infarction. The present review will address recent insights from new patents and experimental studies of drugs, which ought to prevent left ventricular remodelling. Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers and Beta-Blockers have been proven effective in modulating the process of remodelling and in reducing the occurrence of adverse events. However, in most of the trials high risk patients have been excluded, and uncertainty still exists regarding a number of clinically relevant questions. Data from experimental studies have identified new targets for interventions to prevent reverse left ventricular remodelling, i.e. stem cell transfer, activation of cardiac and leukocyte-dependent oxidant stress pathways, inflammatory pathway activation, matrix-metalloproteinase activation.",

Therapeutic target was achieved by 136 (82.9%) patients (DT subgroup) at 6 weeks, whereas 28 (17.1%) patients were changed to a combination therapy of DT and latanoprost [DT plus PG (DT & PG) subgroup]. Between weeks 6 and 12, DT was effective in sustaining the IOP within therapeutic target, whereas addition of latanoprost reduced the IOP of the DT & PG subgroup by an additional 6.3\u2009mmHg or 22.1% (20.1%). At week 12, patients in the DT subgroup experienced a clinically and statistically significant mean (SD) decrease in IOP from a baseline of 12.2\u2009mmHg or 40.4% (11.9%) (P\u2009<\u20090.001), whereas these values corresponded to 13.4\u2009mmHg and 39.7% (15.7%) (P\u2009<\u20090.001), respectively, in the DT & PG subgroup.

Urine samples were first deproteinized by high-speed frozen centrifugation, and the supernatants were loaded on an Extrelut diatomite column for clean-up. The analytes were eluted by ethyl acetate and concentrated for further analysis. The analytical separation was performed on an AtlantisT3-150 mm chromatographic column with the gradient elution using methanol and water (containing 0.1% formic acid). The detection was carried on a linear ion trap mass spectrometer under multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode with the source operated in positive mode of electrospray ionization (ESI+). Nine deuterium labeled beta2-agonists were used as internal standards for quantitative analysis. The results showed that the linear ranges for 23 beta2-agonists and 5 beta-blockers were 0.005-0.16 mg/L, and the limits of detection were all around 0.2 microg/L. The mixed standard solution was added into the blank urine samples, and the recoveries of 23 beta2-agonists and 5 beta-blockers were ranged from 57.1% to 127.7% with the relative standard deviations of 1.1%-31.1%.

Sustained release matrix tablets of metoprolol tartrate were prepared by using different ratios of drug, xanthan gum and tragacanth. Microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) was used as diluent. The polymer was incorporated into a matrix system using direct compression technique. All the lubricated formulations were compressed using concave punches in compression machine. Compressed tablets were evaluated for diameter, hardness, friability, weight variation and in vitro dissolution using USP dissolution apparatus-II. Different formulations were evaluated with respect to dissolution profile in 900 mL phosphate buffer (pH 6.8), 0.1 M HCl solution and distilled water for 12 h at 37 degrees C. Increasing the amount of polymer (xanthan gum) in the formulation led to slow release of drug and decreasing the amount of polymer gave enhanced release of metoprolol tartrate. The kinetic treatment showed the best fitted different mathematical models (Zero order, First order, Higuchi's and Hixson-Crowell). Most of the solid matrix formulations followed Higuchi or zero order kinetics. The formulations F1, F2, F3 and F7, F8, F9 showed maximum linearity while the formulations F4, F5, F6 were not of linear behavior. The results showed that the formulation F9 containing 30% xanthan gum and 10% gum tragacanth is the most similar to that of the reference marketed preparation.",

Unfortunately, they are associated with dose-dependent cardiotoxicity and heart failure (HF) [3\u20138]. Change to a weekly dosage schedule with slow infusions has been tested, a strategy that requires more frequent hospital visits and increased storage resources[7,9]. Liposomal anthracycline formulations with reduced drug exposure and lower plasma concentrations may still be cardiotoxic at higher cumulative doses [10]. Beta-blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme(ACE) inhibitors have been shown to reduce anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity,but have not been tested in long-term prospective, randomized,controlled studies with well defined cardiotoxicity criteria and careful cardiac function monitoring [11\u201316]. We investigated doxorubicin-induced clinical or subclinical cardiotoxicity in lymphoma patients after concomitant prophylactic therapy with metoprolol or enalapril or no concomitant treatment. We examined whether cardiotoxicity was related to the treatment or any other variable. We found that HF was less frequent under concomitant treatment than no treatment, especially in the metoprolol group, but the differences were not significant. No association was found between the presence of cardiotoxicity and concomitant treatment or other variable apart of age that had a significant impact. The marginal benefit seen with metoprolol should be investigated further.",

    "117": "Infantile haemangioma is a benign tumour of the microvasculature characterised by excessive proliferation of immature endothelial cells. It typically undergoes rapid proliferation during infancy followed by spontaneous slow involution during childhood often leaving a fibro-fatty residuum. In 2008, propranolol, a non-selective \u03b2-blocker, was serendipitously discovered to induce accelerated involution of a proliferating infantile haemangioma. However, the mechanism by which propranolol causes this dramatic effect is unclear. Using immunohistochemical staining, we show that the CD34+ endothelial progenitor cells of the microvessels in proliferating infantile haemangioma express angiotensin-converting enzyme and angiotensin II receptor-2, but not angiotensin II receptor-1. We have also shown using our in vitro explant model that the cells emanating from proliferating haemangioma biopsies form blast-like structures that proliferate in the presence of angiotensin II. We present here a plausible model involving the renin-angiotensin system that may account for the propranolol-induced accelerated involution of proliferating infantile haemangioma.",

The many-faceted nature of the clinical heart failure syndrome has historically frustrated attempts to develop an overarching explanative theory. However, much useful information has been gained by basic and clinical investigation, even though a comprehensive understanding of heart failure has been elusive. Heart failure is a growing problem, in both adult and pediatric populations, for which standard medical therapy, as of 2010, can have positive effects, but these are usually limited and progressively diminish with time in most patients. If we want curative or near-curative therapy that will return patients to a normal state of health at a feasible cost, much better diagnostic and therapeutic technologies need to be developed. This review addresses the vexing group of heart failure etiologies that include cardiomyopathies and other ventricular dysfunctions of various types, for which current therapy is only modestly effective. Although there are many unique aspects to heart failure in patients with pediatric and congenital heart disease, many of the innovative approaches that are being developed for the care of adults with heart failure will be applicable to heart failure in childhood.",

    "131": "Hereditary angioedema is an episodic swelling disorder with autosomal dominant inheritance. Attacks are characterized by nonpitting edema of external or mucosal body surfaces. Patients often present with swelling of the extremities, abdominal pain, and swelling of the mouth and throat, which can at times lead to asphyxiation. The disease is caused by a mutation in the gene encoding the complement C1-inhibitor protein, which leads to unregulated production of bradykinin. Long-term therapy has depended on the use of attenuated androgens or plasmin inhibitors but in the US there was, until recently, no specific therapy for acute attacks. As well, many patients with hereditary angioedema in the US were either not adequately controlled on previously available therapies or required doses of medications that exposed them to the risk of serious adverse effects. Five companies have completed or are currently conducting phase III clinical trials in the development of specific therapies to terminate acute attacks or to be used as prophylaxis. These products are based on either replacement therapy with purified plasma-derived or recombinant C1-inhibitor, or inhibition of the kinin-generating pathways with a recombinant plasma kallikrein inhibitor or bradykinin type 2 receptor antagonist. Published studies thus far suggest that all of these products are likely to be effective. These new therapies will likely lead to a totally new approach in treating hereditary angioedema.",

She was witnessed to have experienced a presyncopal episode followed by a true syncopal episode in which she was unresponsive for 20-30\u00a0s. On day two of hospital stay, the patient's ECG showed a sinus bradycardia with a heart rate in the 40\u00a0s and sinus pauses greater than 2\u00a0s in duration. Atenolol was immediately discontinued, with a continuance of the bradycardia despite one missed dose. The potentially toxic combination of rivastigmine and atenolol was then identified as a plausible causative factor of this patient's syncope and was subsequently discontinued. This patient's Naranjo adverse reaction probability score was five, which indicates a probable association between syncope and bradycardia with the combination of rivastigmine and atenolol [13]. Following the discontinuation of rivastigmine, the ECG pauses resolved and the patient's heart rate returned to normal levels. The patient did not experience any further dizziness or syncope. A 65-year-old female developed syncope and subsequent ECG pauses with sinus bradycardia after being treated with rivastigmine for dementia.

Also, little is known about the cellular signal transduction events mediating their actions. Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to investigate the acute effects of treatment of mouse fast- and slow-twitch muscle fiber bundles with clenbuterol, formoterol, and salbutamol. Both clenbuterol and salbutamol increased the levels of cAMP in both fiber types, and this effect was reversed by ICI-118551. On the other hand, clenbuterol and formoterol decreased force production in both fiber types. They also increased the phosphorylation of phospholamban and \u03b2(2)-adrenoceptors in slow-twitch fiber bundles, and their effects were insensitive to propranolol, ICI-118551, and 14-22 amide. In contrast, salbutamol increased force production in both fiber types. It also increased the phosphorylation of \u03b2(2)-adrenoceptors in slow-twitch fibers only, but it had no effect on the phosphorylation of phospholamban in either fiber type. These effects were reversed by propranolol and ICI-118551 but not by 14-22 amide. Instead, 14-22 amide further potentiated the effects of salbutamol on force. In summary, long- and short-acting \u03b2(2)-adrenoceptor agonists have opposite effects on force production in isolated intact mouse skeletal muscle fiber bundles. From these results, we suggest that the acute actions of short-acting \u03b2(2)-adrenoceptor agonists on force production in mammalian skeletal muscles are mediated through the \u03b2(2)-adrenoceptor, whereas those of long-acting \u03b2(2)-adrenoceptor agonists are not.",

Therapies initially aimed at reversing hemodynamic abnormalities in HF, increasing cardiac output, decreasing intracardiac pressures, and blocking vasoconstriction. However, none of these therapies improved survival and some actually increased mortality. Now therapies for HF related to left ventricular systolic dysfunction have focused on counteracting compensatory neurohormonal activation. Several neurohormonal activations are present in HF supporting hemodynamics, but they appear to be deleterious in the long term on the myocardium, increasing progression of the HF and mortality. Blocking the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and the sympathetic system are now the mainstay of medical therapy in HF related to systolic dysfunction as they decrease mortality, hospitalisation rate and improve quality of life.

    "151": "We recently reported that transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) induces an increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](cyt)) in pancreatic cancer cells, but the mechanisms by which TGF-\u03b2 mediates [Ca(2+)](cyt) homeostasis in these cells are currently unknown. Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels and Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchangers (NCX) are plasma membrane proteins that play prominent roles in controlling [Ca(2+)](cyt) homeostasis in normal mammalian cells, but little is known regarding their roles in the regulation of [Ca(2+)](cyt) in pancreatic cancer cells and pancreatic cancer development. Expression and function of NCX1 and TRPC1 proteins were characterized in BxPc3 pancreatic cancer cells. TGF-\u03b2 induced both intracellular Ca(2+) release and extracellular Ca(2+) entry in these cells; however, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate [2-APB; a blocker for both inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)) receptor and TRPC], LaCl(3) (a selective TRPC blocker), or KB-R7943 (a selective inhibitor for the Ca(2+) entry mode of NCX) markedly inhibited the TGF-\u03b2-induced increase in [Ca(2+)](cyt). 2-APB or KB-R7943 treatment was able to dose-dependently reverse membrane translocation of PKC\u03b1 induced by TGF-\u03b2. Transfection with small interfering RNA (siRNA) against NCX1 almost completely abolished NCX1 expression in BxPc3 cells and also inhibited PKC\u03b1 serine phosphorylation induced by TGF-\u03b2. Knockdown of NCX1 or TRPC1 by specific siRNA transfection reversed TGF-\u03b2-induced pancreatic cancer cell motility. Therefore, TGF-\u03b2 induces Ca(2+) entry likely via TRPC1 and NCX1 and raises [Ca(2+)](cyt) in pancreatic cancer cells, which is essential for PKC\u03b1 activation and subsequent tumor cell invasion. Our data suggest that TRPC1 and NCX1 may be among the potential therapeutic targets for pancreatic cancer.",

    "156": "Hypertension remains a significant health problem, affecting approximately 30% of the US population. Of these, only 36.8% have BP controlled to recommended levels of <140/90\u2009mmHg for uncomplicated hypertension and <130/80\u2009mmHg for patients with diabetes mellitus or renal disease. For those with uncontrolled hypertension, the risk of diabetes, renal disease, stroke, and cardiovascular disease is increased. Therapeutic options for the treatment of hypertension include several major classes of drugs: diuretics, \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonists (\u03b2-blockers), ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists (angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]), renin inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and central sympatholytics, alone or in combination. Guidelines recommend thiazide diuretics as preferred first-line monotherapy. However, only 50% of patients will respond adequately to this therapy and the rest will require two or more antihypertensive agents to achieve BP goals. Clinical evidence demonstrates that some drugs have advantages when used in combination rather than as monotherapy. Drugs that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system not only provide BP control but may also provide vascular protection and are metabolically neutral. This is a concise review of the safety and efficacy of ARBs in combination with amlodipine for the treatment of hypertension, with focus on the telmisartan-amlodipine combination. A MEDLINE search of the English literature from 2006 to 2009 of amlodipine in combination with ARBs revealed six publications, which are included in this review.",

Both were female patients (28 and 45 years-old) and underwent sinus node modification/ablation using non-contact mapping (EnSite Array). Since ablation had to be performed in both cases very close to the phrenic nerve (captured during 10V pacing at ablation spots) its function was monitored during ablation with constant phrenic nerve pacing from the superior vena cava. One case was successful after single and straightforward ablation session, the other case despite several attempts and initially good result had recurrences; first recurrence two days after cryoablation, and second three weeks after radiofrequency ablation with irrigated tip catheter.", 
    "162": "Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) is characterized by paroxysmal tachycardia originating in the sinus nodal area. IST predominately affects young, female patients. Current antiarrhythmic drug treatment (\u00df-blockers, calcium antagonists), frequently complicated by side effects, is often not successful. Ivabradine, approved for angina pectoris, selectively reduces heart rate by blocking the \"funny current\" in the sinus node. We therefore evaluated the effect of ivabradine in patients with symptomatic IST. Ten female patients (median age 32.5\u00a0years, range 12-57) suffering from symptomatic IST who had either failed (n\u2009=\u20098) or refused (n\u2009=\u20092) conventional therapy were analyzed. Symptoms included palpitations, pre-syncope, syncope, dyspnea, and exercise intolerance. After obtaining informed consent for individual off-label therapy, patients were treated with ivabradine (5-7.5\u00a0mg bid) in addition to beta-blocker therapy (n\u2009=\u20093) or as mono- therapy (n\u2009=\u20097). Therapy was monitored by 72-h Holter ECG and a symptoms questionnaire. Ivabradine significantly reduced maximum and mean heart rate (baseline, maximal heart rate 176\u2009\u00b1\u200945/min, mean heart rate 84\u2009\u00b1\u200911/min; ivabradine, maximal heart rate 137\u2009\u00b1\u200936/min, mean HR 74\u2009\u00b1\u20098/min, both p\u2009<\u20090.05, all values as mean \u00b1 SD). Minimum heart rate was not significantly changed. Three patients reported transient phosphene-like phenomena without discontinuation of ivabradine while on therapy. IST-associated symptoms were ameliorated (3\u00a0pts) or suppressed (5\u00a0pts) in all eight patients who could be contacted after a mean follow-up of 16\u2009\u00b1\u20099\u00a0months. Ivabradine appears effective and safe in patients with symptomatic inappropriate sinus tachycardia.", 
    "163": "The objectives in treating angina are relief of pain and prevention of disease progression through risk reduction. Mechanisms, indications, clinical forms, doses, and side effects of the traditional antianginal agents - nitrates, \u03b2-blockers, and calcium channel blockers - are reviewed. A number of patients have contraindications or remain unrelieved from anginal discomfort with these drugs. Among newer alternatives, ranolazine, recently approved in the United States, indirectly prevents the intracellular calcium overload involved in cardiac ischemia and is a welcome addition to available treatments. None, however, are disease-modifying agents. Two options for refractory angina, enhanced external counterpulsation and spinal cord stimulation (SCS), are presented in detail. They are both well-studied and are effective means of treating at least some patients with this perplexing form of angina. Traditional modifiable risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) - smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and obesity - account for most of the population-attributable risk. Individual therapy of high-risk patients differs from population-wide efforts to prevent risk factors from appearing or reducing their severity, in order to lower the national burden of disease. Current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines to lower risk in patients with chronic angina are reviewed. The Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive Drug Evaluation (COURAGE) trial showed that in patients with stable angina, optimal medical therapy alone and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with medical therapy were equal in preventing myocardial infarction and death. The integration of COURAGE results into current practice is discussed. For patients who are unstable, with very high risk, with left main coronary artery lesions, in whom medical therapy fails, and in those with acute coronary syndromes, PCI is indicated. Asymptomatic patients with CAD and those with stable angina may defer intervention without additional risk to see if they will improve on optimum medical therapy. For many patients, coronary artery bypass surgery offers the best opportunity for relieving angina, reducing the need for additional revascularization procedures and improving survival. Optimal medical therapy, percutaneous coronary intervention, and surgery are not competing therapies, but are complementary and form a continuum, each filling an important evidence-based need in modern comprehensive management.",

The intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)]i) measurement showed that SOCE occurred in rat epididymal basal cells by pretreating the cells with thapsigargin (Tg), the inhibitor of sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase. To identify the role of Ca(2+) channels in this response, we examined the effects of transient receptor potential canonical channel blockers 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), 1-[\u03b2-[3-(4-methoxyphenyl)pro-poxy]-4-methoxyphenethyl]-1H-imidazole hydrochloride(SKF96365), Gd(3+), and non-selective cation channel blocker Ni(2+) respectively on SOCE and found that these blockers could inhibit the Ca(2+) influx to different extent. Furthermore, we studied the regulation of SOCE by tyrosine kinase pathway. The inhibitor of tyrosine kinase genistein remarkably suppressed the SOCE response, whereas sodium orthovanadate, the inhibitor of tyrosine phosphatase, greatly enhanced it. The results suggest that tyrosine kinase pathway plays a significant role in the initiation of SOCE and positively modulates SOCE in epididymal basal cells.",

In the present study, we investigated the physiological role of insulin and PI3K in glucose-induced biphasic insulin exocytosis in primary cultured \u03b2-cells and insulinoma Min6 cells using total internal reflection fluorescent microscopy. The pretreatment of \u03b2-cells with insulin induced the rapid increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels and accelerated the exocytotic response without affecting the second-phase insulin secretion. The inhibition of PI3K not only abolished the insulin-induced rapid development of the exocytotic response, but also potentiated the second-phase insulin secretion. The rapid development of Ca2+ and accelerated exocytotic response induced by insulin were accompanied by the translocation of the Ca2+-permeable channel TrpV2 (transient receptor potential V2) in a PI3K-dependent manner. Inhibition of TrpV2 by the selective blocker tranilast, or the expression of shRNA (short-hairpin RNA) against TrpV2 suppressed the effect of insulin in the first phase, but the second phase was not affected. Thus our results demonstrate that insulin treatment induced the acceleration of the exocytotic response during the glucose-induced first-phase response by the insertion of TrpV2 into the plasma membrane in a PI3K-dependent manner.", 
    "190": "Appreciation of chronotherapy in hypertension continues to lag, despite clear demonstrations by many studies of (i) clinically relevant dosing-time differences of the beneficial and adverse effects of most blood pressure (BP) medications and (ii) significant association between reduced sleep-time BP decline of non-dippers and their heightened risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The Syst-Eur and HOPE outcome trials showed evening administration of nitrendipine and ramipril in these respective studies impacts sleep-time BP, converting the 24-h BP pattern to a more dipper one and in the HOPE study decreasing CVD risk. The CONVINCE study intended to compare BP control and CVD protection afforded by conventional \u03b2-blocker and diuretic medications versus a special drug-delivery verapamil formulation as a bedtime hypertension chronotherapy; however, the trial was terminated prematurely, not based on inadequate performance of the chronotherapy but on a corporate business decision. The just completed MAPEC study is the first trial specifically designed to prospectively test the hypothesis that bedtime administration of \u22651 conventional medications exerts better BP control and CVD risk reduction than the traditional approach of scheduling all medications in the morning. The results of this 5.6-yr median follow-up study establish that bedtime chronotherapy more effectively improves BP control, better decreases prevalence of non-dipping, and, most importantly, best reduces CVD morbidity and mortality. This chronotherapeutic approach to hypertension is justified by the fact that BP is usually lowest at night as is sodium excretion, but when sodium intake is excessive or its daytime excretion hampered, nocturnal BP is adjusted higher, to a level required for compensation overnight, via the pressure/natriuresis mechanism, resulting in non-dipping 24-h BP patterning. In diurnally active persons, the entire circadian BP pattern may be reset to a lower mean level and to a \"more normal\" day-night variation, simply by enhancing natriuresis during the night-the time-of-day when it can be most effective. A modification as simple and inexpensive as switching \u22651 hypertension medications from morning to evening may be all that is needed to normalize nighttime BP, exerting an effect exactly like sodium restriction. Current clinical concepts such as \"normotensive non-dipper\" (with higher CVD risk than a hypertensive dipper), broad recommendation of pharmacotherapy with exclusively high \"smoothness index\" medications (without attention to individual patient needs defined by the features of the 24-h BP pattern), and reliance upon static daytime diagnostic BP thresholds based solely on single office cuff assessment necessitate urgent reconsideration.",

Animals received no drugs (control group), famotidine (1 mg/kg daily), carvedilol (0.1 mg/kg daily), or carvedilol plus famotidine. Both cardiac catheterization and echocardiography were performed before and 4 weeks after the initiation of pacing. Immunohistochemical studies showed the appearance of mast cells and histamine in the myocardium after 4 weeks of pacing. In the control group, the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was decreased after 4 weeks compared with before pacing (71 \u00b1 2 vs. 27 \u00b1 2%, p < 0.05) and mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) was increased (8 \u00b1 1 vs. 19 \u00b1 3 mmHg). Famotidine ameliorated the decrease of LVEF and increase of PCWP, while the combination of carvedilol plus famotidine further improved both parameters compared with the carvedilol groups. These beneficial effects of famotidine were associated with a decrease of the myocardial cAMP level. Histamine H\u2082 receptor blockade preserves cardiac systolic function in dogs with pacing-induced heart failure, even in the presence of \u03b2-adrenergic receptor blockade. This finding strengthens the rationale for using histamine H\u2082 blockers in the treatment of heart failure.", 
    "200": "Cell models of ischemic preconditioning (IPC) indicate nitric oxide (NO) is involved in protection accruing during reoxygenation but disagree whether it acts through PKG. Using a more relevant intact heart model, we studied isolated rabbit hearts subjected to 30-min coronary artery occlusion/120-min reperfusion. We previously found protection from PKG activator 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (CPT-cGMP) at reperfusion was blocked by A(2b) adenosine receptor (A(2b)AR), ERK, or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) blockers. In this investigation A(2b)AR agonist BAY 60-6583 or CPT-cGMP at reperfusion reduced infarction comparably to IPC. Their protection was abrogated by N(\u03c9)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME), suggesting a PKG-independent NO synthase in IPC's mediator pathway downstream of PKG and A(2b)AR. NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetyl-d,l-penicillamine (SNAP) at reperfusion also protected. This protection was not blocked by PI3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin or ERK antagonist PD-98059, suggesting NO acted downstream of these kinases. Protection from SNAP was not affected by mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K(+) channel closer 5-hydroxydecanoate, PKC antagonist chelerythrine, reactive oxygen species scavenger N-2-mercaptopropionylglycine, or soluble guanylyl cyclase antagonist 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ). Absence of ODQ effect indicated NO was acting independently of PKG. BAY 58-2667, a soluble guanylyl cyclase activator, was protective, and l-NAME blocked its infarct-sparing effect, indicating a second signaling event dependent on NO generation but independent of PKG. SB216763, a blocker of glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2), decreased infarct size, and its infarct-sparing effect was not affected by l-NAME, suggesting GSK-3\u03b2 acted downstream or independently of NO. Hence, NO signaling occurs in IPC's mediator pathway downstream of Akt and ERK, and its protection is independent of PKG.", 
    "201": "We identified a heterozygous p.Arg2401His mutation of RYR2 by sequencing the DNA of a 7-year-old girl who was referred for catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). Using high-resolution melting assay, we have demonstrated a mosaicism for this mutation in her asymptomatic mother which illustrates the benefit of extensive genetic analysis in CPVT, in particular regarding genetic counselling."
