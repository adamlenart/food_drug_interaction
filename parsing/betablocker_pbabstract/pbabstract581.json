    "0": "The mechanism of the hypotensive effect of arotinolol (dl-2-(3'-t-butylamino-2'-hydroxypropylthio)-4-(5'-carbamoyl-2'-th ienyl) thiazole hydrochloride, S-596), a new beta-adrenergic blocking drug with a weak alpha-adrenergic blocking activity, was studied in anesthetized rabbits. Intravenously administered arotinolol produced hypotension at doses above 3 micrograms/kg. Postganglionic renal nerve impulses (RNI) were effect-dependently at doses of 3 and 30 micrograms/kg but augmented after 300 micrograms/kg of arotinolol. The effects of the lower doses of arotinolol were similar to those of clonidine or propranolol, while the effects of the higher doses were similar to those of nitroprusside or phentolamine. The regression line representing the relation between the per cent change of the resting blood pressure and that of the numbers of RNI produced by the lower doses of arotinolol coincided with that of propranolol. Arotinolol blocked the pressor response to phenylephrine but not that to noradrenaline. Administration of arotinolol via the carotid artery produced a hypotension and a concomitant decrease of the numbers of RNI at doses of 3 to 30 micrograms/kg. The above results suggest that the hypotension produced by lower doses of arotinolol was attributable to a decreased sympathetic nervous activity, as is the case with propranolol, while the hypotension by higher doses was peripheral in origin, occurring as a consequence of the blocking effect on the alpha 1-adrenoceptor.", 
    "1": "The hemodynamic effects of the dihydropyridine-derivative BAY K 8644 (methyl-1,4-dihydro-2, 6-dimethyl-3-nitro-4-(2-trifluoro-methylphenyl)-pyridine-5-carboxylate), a chemical analogue of Nifedipine, were evaluated in 9 conscious, chronically instrumented dogs. Compared to Nifedipine, BAY K 8644 displays an opposite pharmacological profile. Dose-dependent hemodynamic effects are observed at doses of 4 micrograms/kg i.v. and above. With 32 micrograms/kg i.v. BAY K 8644 increases total peripheral vascular resistance by 100%. It causes a rise of both, systolic and diastolic, blood pressure up to 196/138 mm Hg at spontaneous sinus rhythm and up to 216/162 mm Hg when keeping heart rate constant at 150 beats/minute. Spontaneous heart rate reflexly drops to 52 beats/minute. Cardiac contractility as indicated by LV(dP/dt)max markedly increases from 2800 to 5600 mm Hg/s at spontaneous sinus rhythm and from 2900 to 6100 mm Hg/s while pacing at 150 beats/minute. These effects are apparently neither affected by alpha-adrenergic blockade with Phenoxybenzamine (5 mg/kg i.v.) nor by beta-blockade with Propranolol (0.5 mg/kg i.v.) but can be reserved by equivalent doses of Nifedipine. In conclusion, the Calcium-agonistic dihydropyridine BAY K 8644 due to its novel mechanism of action could be the precursor of a new class of positive inotropic or antihypotensive drugs.", 
    "2": "A computer method was developed for the determination of electromechanical delay defined as the time between the onset of Q-wave and the onset of the left ventricular systolic pressure rise. It was validated for heart catheterization studies on 56 intact anaesthetized beagle dogs in 86 sessions. The mean basal value of the electromechanical delay was 22 +/- 4 msec. Heart rate, contractility, preload and afterload were changed by atrial pacing and by infusions of calcium chloride, isoproterenol, propranolol, dextran and phenylephrine. Increase of heart rate by pacing from the spontaneous rate of 90 per min to 240 per min prolonged the electromechanical delay from 21 +/- 5 to 33 +/- 14 msec (P less than 0.001). Otherwise the duration of electromechanical delay changed independently of the heart rate. If it changed, the direction of the change followed that of the pre-ejection period. Its proportion of the pre-ejection period varied from 26 to 52%. The electromechanical delay shortened when a positive inotropic effect was noticed or the presystolic fibre length increased.", 
    "3": "In series of 20 patients suffering from atrial arrhythmias, hypertension or hyperkinetic heart syndrome in euthyroid subjects the effect of the new cardioselective beta-blocker celiprolol was examined when orally administered in doses of 300 mg per day against propranolol in a dosage of 160 mg per day. Celiprolol caused a significant reduction (p less than 0.01) of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure while propranolol showed simply a marked decrease in systolic blood pressure. A significant decrease in heart rate was observed with both drugs (p less than 0.01). TT3 and TT4 decreased only slightly when administering either celiprolol or propranolol. A further not significant drop in FT4 due to celiprolol is contrasted to a similarly not significant increase in FT4 when administering propranolol. A striking decrease in FT3 was induced by both drugs, although in the case of celiprolol this reduction became apparent only within a period of 3 weeks. Since only in cases of hyperthyroidism the number of beta-receptors has increased, the reduction of 5'deiodinase is possibly not so pronounced in euthyroidism. In this way an explanation may be found for a mild inhibition of conversion and a consequently missing increase in RT3. Neither celiprolol nor propranolol caused significant changes of laboratory findings, especially when considering triglycerides and creatinine values. Side effects could be lessened in nearly all cases and deterioration was not observed so that therapy never had to be discontinued. Celiprolol has to be considered as a further favourable cardioselective beta-blocker with intrinsic sympathicomimetic activity, causing a reasonable reduction in blood pressure and heart rate and moreover a propranolol-like effect in the peripheral metabolism of thyroid hormones in euthyroid patients.", 
    "4": "Renal function and antihypertensive drug efficacy were determined in a prospective, double-blind, multicenter study comparing enalapril plus hydrochlorothiazide with standard triple therapy (hydrochlorothiazide, timolol, and hydralazine) in 75 patients with documented renovascular hypertension. Both groups had significant mean decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Effective control of diastolic hypertension occurred in 96 percent of patients receiving enalapril compared with 82 percent of patients receiving the triple-drug regimen. Effective renal plasma flow was significantly increased by enalapril therapy. In contrast, the glomerular filtration rate had a bimodal response. In 80 percent of enalapril-treated patients, there was no significant change in the inulin clearance, although in 20 percent of patients (10), there was a 28 percent decrease in the inulin clearance with a concomitant 12 percent increase in renal plasma flow. Seven of the 10 patients had unilateral renal artery stenosis, but in all 10, it was high-grade stenosis (more than 80 to 90 percent stenosis). Although a significant rise in the serum creatinine level occurred in one patient in association with diuretic therapy, volume repletion reversed this azotemia. No oliguric acute renal failure occurred in the enalapril-treated group. The cause of the decrease in glomerular filtration rate induced by enalapril plus hydrochlorothiazide in a minority of patients with renal artery stenosis appears to be quite complex. Although the abolishment of the autoregulation of glomerular filtration secondary to blockage of angiotensin II appears to be a primary cause, the roles of decreased arterial pressure, renal counterbalance, concurrent diuretic therapy, and other hemodynamic factors that may maintain glomerular ultrafiltration pressure must also be considered. The results of this study show that enalapril plus hydrochlorothiazide is effective in treating renovascular hypertension. Special care is needed for a small group of patients with renovascular hypertension in whom there is a decrease in the glomerular filtration rate with this therapy. This may identify a subset of patients with unilateral or bilateral high-grade renal artery stenosis in whom alternative therapy--percutaneous angioplasty or surgical intervention--may be considered.", 
    "5": "Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined after the oral administration of a single tablet containing 200 mg celiprolol HCl to 8 healthy volunteers with normal kidney function and 6 patients with stable impaired renal function of different degrees of severity. The plasma levels and the urinary excretion of celiprolol were followed up for 48 hours after administration with the help of specific chemo-analytical methods. The substance was equally well absorbed both by healthy volunteers and patients with renal disease. While the cumulative renal excretion (0 to 48 hours after administration) was reduced from 18.2% in healthy volunteers to 2.3% of the applied dose in kidney patients, the global elimination constant k fell from 0.104 h-1 in healthy volunteers to 0.072 h-1 in the patients with renal disease. It can be assumed that in patients with impaired renal function at least a part of the lacking renal elimination of celiprolol can be taken over by \"extrarenal elimination\". According to the method of Dettli a reduction in dosage of the beta 1-blocker, celiprolol is not necessary in patients with more or less impaired kidney function.", 
    "6": "The interaction of beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents with serotonin receptors in rat brain was analyzed by quantitative light microscopic autoradiography using (-) [125I]cyanopindolol (ICYP) as a ligand. In some brain areas such as the globus pallidus and dorsal subiculum, binding of ICYP was blocked with high affinity by some serotoninergic ligands, RU-24969 and serotonin, but not by lysergic acid diethylamide and 8-hydroxy-2-(N,N-di-n-propylamino)tetralin. Some beta-blockers also showed high affinity for these sites. These results supply direct evidence for the labeling of a subclass of serotonin receptors, the 5-HT-1B class, providing anatomical and pharmacological basis for some known serotonin-related effects of beta-adrenoceptor drugs.", 
    "7": "Free Ca2+ concentration and 45Ca flux were measured in the perfusate and bile of the perfused rat liver. With a perfusate Ca2+ concentration of 1 mM, the bile concentration was 0.35 mM. The ratio of 45Ca in bile to that in blood increased from 0.3 to 0.6 over 90 min of perfusion. Both verapamil and adrenaline (via alpha-adrenergic receptors) increased the 45Ca bile/perfusate ratio to 0.8. Adrenaline infusion increased the bile Ca2+ concentration to 0.8 mM. This decreased to 0.35 mM after the infusion was stopped.", 
    "8": "Autonomic hyperreflexia is a serious peripartum complication associated with spinal cord lesions. Although the majority of reported cases have occurred with lesions at T-5 or higher, we report a case occurring in a patient with a lesion at T-10. Management may be by regional anesthesia or primarily medical.", 
    "9": "We compared the effects of once-daily oral administration of 20 mg and 40 mg of nadolol vs placebo in 40 normal volunteers in a randomized, double-masked trial. Each of 23 women and 17 men (ranging in age from 18 to 50 years) had intraocular pressure, pulse rate, blood pressure, pupil size, amplitude of accommodation, and near point measured immediately before treatment and then at 24 hours, day 8, and day 15 after treatment. Both dosages of nadolol produced significant decreases in intraocular pressure at three hours (P less than .001). Although both dosages decreased intraocular pressure at 24 hours compared with placebo, only the change with the 40-mg dose was significant (P less than .05). Although both dosages produced significant decreases in pulse rate and blood pressure, side effects were minimal.", 
    "10": "Some theoretical arguments suggest that added vasodilation could be beneficial in the management of patients with systemic hypertension and angina pectoris. Ten patients were studied in a double-blind crossover trial in which the severity of hypertension and angina pectoris was monitored. The initial run-in period of 2 to 6 weeks consisted of therapy with fixed-dose atenolol, 100 mg once daily, a thiazide diuretic drug, and any other agents required to control the hypertension. Patients were then randomized for 4 weeks to active atenolol plus 2 tablets of labetalol placebo, or active labetalol (200 mg twice daily) plus atenolol placebo, then crossed over and then changed back to active atenolol without labetalol placebo; the observers were unblinded in the last period. Labetalol and atenolol were equivalent in control of blood pressure at rest, exercise tolerance and use of nitroglycerin; however, heart rates at rest and during exercise were higher with labetalol (p less than 0.01), whereas the heart rate-blood pressure product at the end of the exercise test was unchanged with labetalol. The higher heart rates for the same antianginal efficacy may give an advantage to labetalol treatment in some patients. Conversely, atenolol is cardioselective, hydrophilic, and can be given as a single daily dose. Thus, each agent has some advantages in the therapy of patients with hypertension and effort angina.", 
    "11": "Serum glucose was elevated immediately after ip administration of a single large dose of fluoride (NaF 35 mg/kg) to rats. Moreover, elevation of serum glucose following ip administration of 35 mg/kg of fluoride to rats was suppressed by adrenalectomy, dibenamine, or propranolol, but not by thyroid-parathyroidectomy. The elevation of serum glucose was associated with enhancement of glucose-6-phosphatase activities in liver and kidney in fluoride-treated rats.", 
    "12": "It is reported of acute beta-blocker intoxications in 34 patients (16 with talinolol, 18 with propranolol ingestion). The mean ingestion dose was for talinolol 2.5 g, for propranolol 1.55 g, the mean time of latency up to the appearance of intoxication symptoms 116 min after intake of talinolol, 79 min after intake of propranolol. The picture of intoxication was characterized in the two substances by the antiadrenergic effects, there was no more a cardioselectivity in the high ingestion doses. In talinolol were in the first place dysrhythmias, hypotension and vomiting and nausea, respectively, in propranolol central-nervous symptoms and hypotension. Substance-specific intoxication symptoms are also possible. In mixed intoxications alcohol accelerated the beginning of the effect, sedatives prolonged the latency. Threatening of life is to be expected in ingestion doses over 2 g. In 6 patients the course was lethal after extreme doses of talinolol - according to the present experiences due to the too late beginning of therapy and/or insufficient intensity of therapy. Distinct intoxication symptoms need extremely high applications of antidotes of beta-stimulants, in their inffectiveness glucagon. Furthermore, treatment with cardiac pacemakers and 24-hour control in an intensive care unit proved necessary.", 
    "13": "Current concepts concerning the pathophysiology of acute myocardial ischemia are reviewed. The importance of intermittent, dynamic shifts in the diameter of the coronary artery lumen is emphasized. Traditionally, it has been thought that angina pectoris is the common clinical hallmark of myocardial ischemia. It is now apparent that asymptomatic episodes of myocardial ischemia may be occurring far more frequently than symptomatic episodes. Although the natural history of asymptomatic myocardial ischemia is still unknown, ischemia, even in an asymptomatic form, can have serious consequences. This suggests the need for a careful assessment of patients in whom ischemia has been detected. In truly asymptomatic patients, detection is usually fortuitous; in patients with known coronary arterial disease, asymptomatic episodes should be sought as part of a noninvasive cardiac investigation, using multiple-stage exercise treadmill testing and 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. Suggestions are made for the management of asymptomatic myocardial ischemia in relation to three patient groups: (1) asymptomatic ischemia in patients known to have symptomatic ischemia as well, (2) asymptomatic ischemia in patients without symptoms at any time, and (3) asymptomatic ischemia in patients who have had myocardial infarction. Medical management includes the use of calcium channel blocking drugs, beta-adrenergic blocking drugs, and nitrates. Documentation of an inadequate coronary artery reserve or evidence of associated left main coronary artery disease indicates the need for either aortocoronary bypass graft surgery or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, depending on the condition of the coronary anatomy and the degree of ventricular function. Whatever mode of treatment is used, documentation of its effectiveness should always be determined by appropriate follow-up studies. Clinical studies of the natural history of asymptomatic myocardial ischemia and its management are urgently needed.", 
    "14": "The effect of nicotine on adenosine release, oxygen consumption, and contractility was investigated in perfused rat hearts. Continuous infusion of nicotine into the perfusing physiological saline (PS) elicited a propranolol (10(-6) M) sensitive transient elevation of developed left ventricular pressure (LVP) and maximum rates of left ventricular pressure development and relaxation (+/- dP/dtmax) within 20 s, which subsequently declined to maintained elevated plateau levels by 1 min. The continuous infusions of nicotine to achieve PS concentrations of 5 X 10(-4), 1 X 10(-4), or 5 X 10(-5) M, respectively resulted in significant increases in the mean plateau levels of LVP (33.4, 10.1, or 6.3%), +dP/dtmax (26.3, 10.8, or 6.9%) and-dP/dtmax (35.0, 11.9, or 9.0%) at 1 min. The inclusion of propranolol (10(-6) M) with or without atropine (10(-6) M) did not alter these maintained plateau responses to nicotine. During the plateau phase of the contractile response oxygen consumption of the hearts was significantly elevated by 36, 19, or 11%, and mean levels for adenosine in the coronary effluent rose by 261, 76, or 74% in response to 5 X 10(-4), 1 X 10(-4), or 5 X 10(-5) M nicotine, respectively. Nicotine did not influence [14C]adenosine uptake by the hearts. These results suggest that nicotine is capable of 1) augmenting cardiac contractility and oxygen consumption independent of beta-adrenergic or muscarinic influence, and 2) elevating the appearance of adenosine in the coronary circulation presumably by enhancing myocardial production of the nucleoside.", 
    "15": "The beta-adrenoceptor antagonist [125I]cyanopindolol (CYP) was used to localize beta-adrenoceptors in sections of rabbit ear. Biochemical studies demonstrated that the binding was stereoselective, and that the beta-adrenoceptors are predominantly of the beta 2-subtype. Autoradiographic studies using 3H-Ultrofilm or nuclear emulsion coated coverslips showed high concentrations of beta 2-adrenoceptors present in the central ear artery, hyaline cartilage, nerve trunks, epithelium and sebaceous glands.", 
    "16": "The present study investigated the extent to which a single priming injection of clenbuterol, a beta-adrenoceptor agonist, could alter the behavioral response (locomotor activity recorded for 30 min with photocell counters) of mice to the subsequent administration of beta-adrenoceptor agonists or antagonists. In mice pretreated with clenbuterol (0.25 mg/kg), the dose-response curve of clenbuterol (0.06 to 2 mg/kg) for reducing locomotor activity was shifted to the right with minimal alteration of the maximal response. The magnitude of the shift was dependent on both the priming dose of clenbuterol and the time interval between the priming and the test injections (maximum between 15 to 24 h, disappearance for intervals exceeding 72 h). The coadministration of propranolol (0.5; 2; 8 mg/kg) dose dependently antagonized the effects of the priming injection of clenbuterol. A previous injection of clenbuterol was also found to reduce the ability of another beta-adrenoceptor stimulant, salbutamol (8 mg/kg), but not apomorphine, to reduce locomotor activity. Finally, previous beta-adrenoceptor stimulation resulted in an enhanced ability of two beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, propranolol (0.125 to 8 mg/kg) and penbutolol (0.5 to 32 mg/kg), to reduce locomotor activity in mice. All these data add to the evidence concerning the remarkable plasticity of central beta-adrenoceptors and indicate that initial stimulation of a class of beta-adrenoceptors may trigger a relatively important, time-dependent alteration in the behavioral reactivity to beta-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists.", 
    "17": "Guanine nucleotide-dependent modulation of agonist binding to the beta-receptor reflects coupling of the receptor to the nucleotide regulatory protein. Similarly, guanine nucleotide-dependent stimulation of adenylate cyclase can be used as an index of coupling between the regulatory protein and the catalytic unit of the cyclase. Using both approaches we have studied coupling in the beta-adrenergic receptor-adenylate cyclase system in rabbit liver during neonatal development. With [3H]dihydroalprenolol as ligand, the Bmax was relatively unchanged (200-300 fmol/mg of protein) between birth and end of day 1 and was similar to adult values. Guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate-dependent shift in agonist (l-isoproterenol) competition curves was biphasic, decreasing from 10-fold in membranes isolated from animals at term to about 6-fold in membranes from 6-h-old neonates, and increasing progressively in older animals to a maximal measurable value of 42-fold in the adult. The ability of guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate, GTP, GTP plus isoproterenol, NaF, or forskolin to activate adenylate cyclase was also biphasic and age-dependent. With Mn2+ the measured activity was not at any time greater than the activity at term. Pretreatment of membranes with cholera toxin resulted in differential levels of enhancement of adenylate cyclase activity wherein much lower enhancement was observed in membranes from neonatal animals. With [32P]NAD as substrate, cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of membranes indicated development-dependent accumulation of Ns peptides. From these results we suggest that there is a decreased efficiency in the coupling of the beta-adrenergic receptor to hepatic adenylate cyclase in early neonatal life. The molecular basis for the biphasic nature of the coupling is presently unclear.", 
    "18": "In contrast to drugs, sleep deprivation and phototherapy rapidly induce depressive remissions, which are rapidly reversible. These characteristics make them useful tools for prospective, longitudinal studies of the psychobiology of depression. It seems likely that discovery of the mechanism of action of these two antidepressant procedures would increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of depression and lead to novel, rapidly acting pharmacological treatments. Further progress in this direction depends on careful delineation of which conditions of the procedures are necessary for their antidepressant efficacy and identification and pharmacological manipulation of biological correlates of the procedures that may be relevant to their mechanism of action. Analogies between the two procedures suggest that similar mechanisms may be involved in both.", 
    "19": "The pharmacokinetics, plasma protein binding and metabolism of nipradilol (K-351: NIP), a new potent antihypertensive and antianginal agent, were compared in dogs, monkeys, rabbits and rats. In all species studied, NIP did not appreciably bind plasma protein (less than 30%) and was extensively distributed in tissues. There was a good correlation between the volume of distribution at steady state (Vss, 1) and body weight (B, kg) of the animal species as follows: Vss = 4.42 B0.805. In addition, Vss increased as a function of the plasma free fraction. Intrinsic clearance of unbound drug (CLuint, 1/h) also correlated with body weight as follows: CLuint = 4.78 B0.722, but blood clearance in rabbits exceeded hepatic blood flow, suggesting extrahepatic metabolism. Following oral administration, the systemic availability for all species increased with the oral dose, while the half-life was about 2 h, and was independent of dose. The apparent threshold dose (ATD, mg/kg) was observed to vary inversely with body weight of the animal species as follows: ATD = 4.33 B-0.472. Less than 2% of the dose was excreted into the urine as unchanged NIP in all species. The metabolic profile for all species was similar, but pronounced quantitative differences among species was observed for aliphatic and aromatic hydroxylation of the 3,4-dihydro-2 H-1-benzopyran ring.", 
    "20": "All Wistar rats showed hypertension when they were given heat-stress and administered metyrapone (200 micrograms/kg/day), a cholesterol-11-beta-hydroxylase inhibitor. The addition of saline loading potentiated the hypertensive state. The hypertension in MH-rats was blocked by a low dose (1 mg/kg) of propranolol, a dose which was insufficient to cure the Spontanous Hypertensive rats, and by a very low dose (20 ng/kg) of 1-dopa with carbidopa treatment, but not by haloperidol, sulpiride, or prazosin. Striatal dopamine (DA) of MH-rats was increased significantly. These results suggested that the hypertension of MH-rats was related to the inhibition of central DA release. Since MH-rats showed the availability of propranolol clearly, this may be a useful model for hypertension.", 
    "21": "Plethysmographic investigations have been in use for at least a hundred years for the measurement of pharmacological actions in humans. Finger plethysmography was used particularly in the investigation of the vasodilating effect of organic nitrates. It has also proved valuable in determining the relative bioavailability of representatives of this class of drugs. This paper deals with personal experience in the use of this method for the investigation of older and newer organic nitrates. The apparatus that was developed to enable electronic data processing of the plethysmographic signals is described. The effects of other pharmacological interventions on finger volume pulse are also discussed, and the finger plethysmographic investigation of vasodilating substances that belong to classes of drugs other than organic nitrates is presented. The possibilities and limits of the method are discussed.", 
    "22": "The development of a national collaborative program for the study of long-term effects of antianginal drugs initiated for the first time in our country is reported. The present communication is concerned with methodological approaches to the study. The collaborative effort has enabled a basically new scale of research. The principal methodological problems discussed are: how to select antianginal drugs; how to assess drug tolerance; and, possible changes in pharmacokinetic parameters of antianginal drugs used on a long-term basis. Studies along these lines are expected to contribute to the development of optimum regimens of antianginal treatment.", 
    "23": "Catecholamines and physical exercise are known to influence the metabolism of several minerals in man, but the effects on magnesium (Mg) have been scarcely investigated. In the present study, infusion of adrenaline (5 micrograms/min for 30 min followed by 10 micrograms/min for 30 minutes) significantly reduced the plasma Mg levels in healthy males. This effect was abolished by simultaneous infusion of propranolol. Noradrenaline had no such effect. In order to stimulate endogenous catecholamine release healthy males carried out physical exercise in four different ways: ergometer bicycling at maximum load until exhaustion with and without oral beta-blockade, ergometer bicycling with stepwise increasing load until exhaustion, isokinetic maximal exercise with one leg, with blood sampling both from the venous effluent of the exercising leg and the opposite resting arm and long-term (60 min) steady state ergometer bicycling at approximately 65% of estimated maximum capacity. During short-term (less than 20 min) intense exercise (i.e. experiments 1-3) the plasma Mg concentrations were increased. This was probably due to a reduction of plasma volume and to an influx of Mg to the vascular pool. During long-term steady state exercise (experiment 4) the Mg levels were not significantly affected but decreased during the first hour of recovery. These results suggest that both the beta-adrenergic system and muscular activity by itself affect Mg homeostasis.", 
    "24": "Conscious rabbits received electrical stimulation of insular and more posterior perirhinal cortex through chronically implanted electrodes. Active sites for cardiovascular responses were found in both anterior and posterior insular cortex as well as more posterior perirhinal regions. Although differential response topographies occurred related to anterior versus posterior insular cortex, all heart rate responses consisted of bradycardia. Pharmacological manipulations revealed that this bradycardia was due to a combination of vagal and sympatho-inhibitory mechanisms. Some posterior sites yielded pressor responses, and bradycardia which was sensitive to phentolamine, suggesting that the bradycardia in these instances was due to activation of the baroreceptor reflex. All other blood pressure changes were depressor responses. In a second experiment two different groups of rabbits with lesions of either anterior or posterior agranular insular cortex were compared with a third group of animals with sham lesions in a differential Pavlovian conditioning experiment. No lesion completely abolished the classically conditioned bradycardia associated with tone/shock contingencies. However, anterior insular lesions attenuated the magnitude of the conditioned bradycardia compared to the posterior and sham lesions. Control experiments suggested that this attenuation was due to the lesion's effects on the conditioned stimulus/unconditioned stimulus association and not to its effects on unconditioned responding to the conditioned stimulus or unconditioned stimulus alone.", 
    "25": "The treatment of the mentioned forms of hypertension with propranolol during pregnancy either as monotherapy or in combination with dihydralazine and after careful exclusion of the contraindications described represents a further effective therapy. In the control examinations during pregnancy carried out in close cooperation between obstetrician and internist no detrimental side effects could be established for both mother and child. No significant changes of absorption, distribution and elimination of propranolol in pregnant women with hypertension in comparison with normotensive nonpregnant women were found as follows from the pharmacokinetic parameters shown.", 
    "26": "A time series \"reversal\" design demonstrated that behavioral counseling increased medication adherence from about 60 to 100% for a black, hypertensive patient. However, inadequate pharmacological treatment yielded no clinically important blood pressure decrease. The combination of improved compliance and minimal blood pressure reduction led the patient's physician to explore higher doses and alternate medications to achieve blood pressure control. The physician's aggressive medical treatment was initiated only after the patient's compliance had been improved. Thus, this study suggests that paraprofessional counseling can increase compliance and illustrates the need for both behavioral and physiological data in clinical management to avoid blaming patients for poorly controlled blood pressure.", 
    "27": "Cyanide anion was used to attempt to trap possible imine intermediates in the oxidative N-dealkylation of propranolol (1). Reaction of 3-(1-naphthoxy)-1-amino-2-propanol (desisopropylpropranolol, 2) with acetone provided this expected intermediate in an approximately 7:1 ratio of oxazolidine 6 to imine 5, as determined by 1H NMR. The mixture when treated with sodium cyanide gave the expected alpha-aminonitrile 7. Microsomal oxidation of propranolol in the presence of sodium cyanide gave two cyanide-containing adducts as shown by GC-MS (12a and 12b). Using specifically deuterated propranolols (8, 9, 10, and 11) as substrates showed both of these cyanide-containing adducts to have lost the N-isopropyl group. Compounds 12a and 12b were shown to be diastereomeric alpha-aminonitriles arising from the reaction of 2 with propionaldehyde, a contaminant from the ether used for extraction, and cyanide anion. Authentic 7, stable to derivatization and GC-MS conditions, rapidly decomposed under the conditions of the metabolic experiments.", 
    "28": "The changes in the aqueous flow rate with time under action of acetazolamide, a selective alpha 1 agonist, phenylephrine, selective beta 2 agonist, salbutamol, and beta antagonist, timolol, were studied by the pre-invasive method of Johnson and Maurice in the normal rabbit. After intravenous injection of 50 mg kg-1 of acetazolamide, the experimental to control ratio of the apparent flow rate significantly decreased to 71 +/- 2% at 2 hr and 53 +/- 2% at 4 hr (mean +/- S.E.(M.), n = 7). After a single instillation of 5% L-phenylephrine, it showed two phase changes; it significantly increased to 121 +/- 5% at 1 hr and 110 +/- 3% at 2 hr, while it significantly decreased to 93 +/- 2% at 4 and 5 hr and 95 +/- 2% at 6 hr (n = 8). Pretreatment with prostaglandin biosynthesis inhibitor, flurbiprofen, did not cause significant effect on the phenylephrine action, while pretreatment with alpha antagonist, phenoxybenzamine abolished it. After a single instillation of 2.5% salbutamol, it significantly decreased to 78 +/- 4% at 1 hr, 84 +/- 3% at 2 hr and 91 +/- 3% at 3 and 4 hr (n = 8), while a single instillation of 0.5% L-timolol did not show significant effect on it. Pretreatment with timolol abolished the salbutamol action. The mean aqueous flow rate in the normal rabbit as determined by this method was 3.64 +/- 0.15 microliters min-1 (n = 20).", 
    "29": "To test the relative sensitivity of serotonin and propranolol pulmonary extraction measurements to changes in pulmonary vascular surface, we sequentially subjected anaesthetized dogs to left upper lobe atelectasis, left lung atelectasis and left pulmonary artery occlusion. We used a triple-indicator dilution technique to simultaneously measure the pulmonary extraction of serotonin and propranolol. After an initial series of measurements, dogs received dopamine and dextran to slightly increase pulmonary artery pressure and prevent further recruitment of capillaries. Left upper lobe atelectasis did not modify the pulmonary extraction of serotonin and propranolol. Left lung atelectasis provoked a reduction in the serotonin extraction ratio by only 4%, whereas the propranolol extraction ratio decreased by 13%. After left pulmonary artery occlusion, propranolol and serotonin extraction ratios decreased by 16% and 5% respectively. We conclude that the pulmonary extraction of propranolol is more sensitive to a decrease in pulmonary vascular surface than that of serotonin.", 
    "30": "The electrophysiological effects of sotalol, a beta-blocking drug with class III antiarrhythmic properties were assessed in 20 patients (mean age 33 +/- 14.3 years) with supraventricular tachycardias. Sixteen patients had Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (overt n = 9, concealed n = 7), three patients AV-nodal reentrant tachycardias and another patient atrial tachycardias. Sotalol was administered intravenously (n = 16) in a dose of 1.5 mg/kg over 15 min. The effects of 320 to 480 mg/day oral sotalol were assessed in 7 patients. By intravenous and oral application of sotalol a significant increase in the AH interval, the refractory periods of the atrium and ventricle as well as a decrease of the antegrade and retrograde conduction capacity of the AV node or the accessory pathway were observed. The mean R-R interval during induced atrial fibrillation increased significantly in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome from 224 +/- 52 ms to 277 +/- 59 ms (p less than 0.05). In 10 patients, sotalol was administered during supraventricular reentrant tachycardia. The cycle length of supraventricular tachycardia increased from 276 +/- 90 ms to 358 +/- 25 ms (p less than 0.01). The tachycardia terminated in 7 patients: in 5 patients block was observed in the AV node, while in another 2 patients tachycardia terminated retrogradely. After intravenous application supraventricular arrhythmias were no longer inducible in 5 of 12 patients. In a further 4 patients only non-sustained supraventricular tachycardias (4-20 QRS complexes) were inducible. In 2 patients the supraventricular tachycardia terminated distal to the His bundle.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "31": "The electrophysiologic effects of sotalol were studied in 11 patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and 9 patients with AV nodal reentrant tachycardia. Electrophysiologic studies were performed before and after intravenous infusion of 80 mg sotalol over a period of 5 minutes. Sotalol prolonged the effective refractory period of the right atrium and the right ventricle. Both AV node and accessory pathway conduction were depressed by sotalol in antegrade and retrograde directions. Induction of reentrant tachycardia was prevented in 6 of 18 patients. The rate of reentrant tachycardia decreased from 182 +/- 29/min to 153 +/- 14/min (p less than 0.01) and the ventricular rate during atrial fibrillation from 148 +/- 14/min to 112 +/- 12/min (p less than 0.05). Sotalol exhibited a depressant effect on all parts of the reentrant circuit: atrium, ventricle, AV node, and accessory pathway. Thus, sotalol is effective in the therapy of patients with recurrent supraventricular tachycardias.", 
    "32": "Cardiovascular responses to intravenous 1-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (56 and 112 pmoles/kg/min) were examined in conscious Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) normotensive rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) instrumented with arterial and venous catheters, and an electromagnetic flow probe around the ascending aorta. The results suggest that this compound reduces mean blood pressure via a dose related fall in peripheral vascular resistance and cardiac index in conscious SHR and WKY rats.", 
    "33": "The relationship between psychologically induced autonomic responses, ST segment depression, and ectopy was examined in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and controls. Both groups underwent a battery of performance tasks and interviews. Performance tasks were selected to yield predictable sympathetic and vagal responses. Autonomic activation in response to stimuli was documented using heart rate, blood pressure, and vascular indices. ST segment depression was observed in a significant portion of the sample. In subjects with CAD, ST segment depression, but not ectopy, was specifically associated with mental arithmetic. In this task, autonomic changes occurred, suggesting beta sympathetic activation. The prevalence of ST segment depression during mental arithmetic declined when a task-inducing brief, phasic vagal activation was combined with the mental arithmetic. Ectopic beats were not associated with a specific task among either patients or controls. The results supported the importance of psychologically induced autonomic response for the precipitation and inhibition of ST segment depression in patients with CAD.", 
    "34": "Electrical stimulation of a canine vagosympathetic complex or a cardiopulmonary nerve can elicit a variety of negative chronotropic and inotropic cardiac responses, with or without alterations in systemic arterial pressure. In the period immediately following cessation of such a stimulation \"rebound\" tachycardia, increased inotropism above control values in one or more regions of the heart, and (or) elevation in systemic arterial pressure can occur. These \"rebound\" phenomena are abolished by propranolol or ipsilateral chronic sympathectomy. It is proposed that \"vagal\" poststimulation \"rebound\" of the canine cardiovascular system is primarily the result of activation of sympathetic neural elements present in the vagosympathetic complexes or cardiopulmonary nerves.", 
    "35": "The effects of acute pretreatment with metoprolol, dazmegrel and a combination of these two drugs has been examined on myocardial infarct size in rats. Ischaemic damage was assessed 4 h after coronary artery occlusion in anaesthetized rats and after 48 h of ischaemia in conscious rats. Infarct size was measured histochemically (by using periodic-acid-Schiff diastase reaction for glycogen) and by standard histological examination (haematoxylin and eosin stain). There was some evidence of protection of the myocardium by metoprolol following 4 h of ischaemia (determined histologically) but this was not apparent 48 h after occlusion. When given alone, dazmegrel had no significant effects on infarct size assessed by either method. A clear reduction in the extent of glycogen depletion and histological damage was observed with the combination of metoprolol and dazmegrel 48 h after the onset of ischaemia. This protection was seen to occur in the horizontal plane of the heart, preventing the extension of the infarct towards the posterior wall of the left ventricle and showing some salvage of the epicardial surfaces.", 
    "36": "The effects of metoprolol and the thromboxane synthetase inhibitor dazmegrel, alone and in combination, were examined in a model of coronary artery occlusion in conscious rats. In a dose (2 mg kg-1), intravenously, that resulted in a marked bradycardia (of 50-80 beats min -1) metoprolol did not influence the incidence or severity of the ventricular arrhythmias that occur in the first 20 min following occlusion, nor did it improve survival (assessed at both 20 min and 16 h). In a dose (5 mg kg-1), intravenously, that in another conscious rat model involving tissue hypoperfusion inhibited thromboxane production, dazmegrel also did not modify ischaemic arrhythmias or survival. In contrast, metoprolol and dazmegrel (2 mg kg-1 and 5 mg kg-1 i.v.) when given together prior to coronary artery occlusion, produced a significant reduction in mortality both at 20 min and 16 h (e.g. from 60-75% in the control, metoprolol alone and dazmegrel alone groups and only 25% in the combined-treatment group). This was due to a decrease in the incidence of terminal ventricular fibrillation. The results suggest that a combination of beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug with a drug that inhibits thromboxane synthesis may offer more protection against ischaemia-induced ventricular fibrillation than either drug used alone. They suggest a role for both catecholamines and thromboxane in the genesis of ischaemia-induced ventricular fibrillation.", 
    "37": "The nature of adrenoceptors in basilar arteries of neonatal rats was investigated by means of electrophysiological techniques. In immature (2-6 day postnatal) rats, micro-injection of noradrenaline elicited a depolarization which consisted of two components. The initial 'fast' component (time to peak of 0.3-4s) was slightly reduced by phentolamine and was not antagonized by propranolol. The second 'slow' component (time to peak of about 50s) was not blocked by phentolamine but was antagonized by low concentrations (10(-7) M) of propranolol. In immature rats, micro-injection of isoprenaline was more potent than noradrenaline in evoking the 'slow' depolarization but less effective in eliciting the 'fast' response. The pharmacology with respect to adrenoceptor antagonists of both components of the isoprenaline- and noradrenaline-induced depolarizations was similar. There was some evidence of inhibitory beta-adrenoceptors in immature rat basilar vessels. In adult rats (6 week old) noradrenaline produced a large 'fast' depolarization which was followed by a 'slow' tail response. Both components were not antagonized by phentolamine or propranolol. It appears that in the basilar artery of neonatal rats there are excitatory alpha- and inhibitory beta-adrenoceptors but the major responses to noradrenaline and isoprenaline are mediated by gamma- and excitatory beta-receptors. In adult animals the gamma-adrenoceptor predominates. Experiments were carried out in which agonists were applied by ionophoresis. These results confirm the presence of excitatory beta-receptors in neonatal basilar vessels and show the response has slow kinetics and it is likely that the beta-receptors are distributed uniformly over the smooth muscle surface. In adult animals it was not possible to elicit an excitatory beta-receptor-mediated response. The ionophoretic application of noradrenaline never evoked a perceptible depolarization which could be attributed to gamma-adrenoceptor stimulation. This result is discussed in terms of receptor distribution with respect to synaptic function in a syncytium.", 
    "38": "Male rats of the F-344 and BUF inbred strains were given free access to a 10% sucrose solution containing 0.5 mg/ml morphine sulfate (controls received sucrose only) as their sole source of fluids. The daily intake of morphine averaged 101 +/- 13 mg/kg. After 18 days on this regimen, animals were sacrificed and assayed for 3H-clonidine (alpha-2 adrenergic), 3H-dihydroalprenolol (DHA, beta 1 and 2 adrenergic) and 3H-spiperone (SPD, 5-HT2 and D2) binding in several brain regions. In the absence of morphine treatment, BUF rats displayed higher levels of SPD binding in brainstem, as compared with the F-344 strain. In contrast, untreated F-344 rats exhibited higher levels of DHA binding in hypothalamus and SPD binding in striatum than BUF rats. Chronic morphine resulted in an increase in clonidine and DHA binding in the brainstem and hippocampus respectively of BUF, but not F-344 rats, suggesting a greater sensitivity of adrenergic function to opiate treatment in the BUF strain. The two strains differed qualitatively in the effect of morphine on striatal SPD binding, with BUF rats exhibiting a decrease, and F-344 rats an increase. The one consistent change observed in both strains was a quantitatively similar increase in hippocampal SPD binding after chronic morphine. The results demonstrate that despite strain-dependent differences in binding characteristics, chronic morphine elicits a strain-independent alteration in hippocampal 5-HT2 binding. On the basis of these preliminary findings, it may be speculated that this particular neurochemical consequence contributes to morphine-induced behaviors which are observed independent of rat strain.", 
    "39": "We have assessed serial changes in myocardial contractility and reserve in the normal lamb over the first month of life using an in vivo adaptation of the endsystolic pressure-volume relationship. Via a left thoracotomy, we insert a catheter tip pressure transducer into the left ventricle, affix an echo transducer onto the left ventricular epicardium, place an electromagnetic flow transducer around the pulmonary artery, and insert catheters for monitoring and infusions. We measure contractility by generating left ventricular wall stress-volume index (the cube of dimension) curves, at the same time increasing afterload by infusing phenylephrine. The slope of the endsystolic wall stress-volume index relationship is our index of contractility. Weekly studies were performed at rest and during isoproterenol infusion in 12 animals, and after propranolol administration in four. The data showed a progressive decrease in resting contractility but no change in maximal contractility during isoproterenol infusion over the 4 wk. Taking each week separately, the average increase in contractility during isoproterenol infusion was small at 1 wk (13%), moderate at 2 and 3 wk (24 and 26%, respectively), and large at 4 wk (79%). beta-Adrenergic blockade with propranolol caused a significant decrease in contractility in three of four animals studied at 1 wk, in only one of four animals at 2 wk, and in none of four animals at 3 or 4 wk. Thus, the newborn lamb shows a limited reserve in contractility that increases progressively with age; the limited reserve appears secondary to a high resting beta-adrenergic state.", 
    "40": "The electrophysiology of ventricular cells from prenecrotic stage 10 to 14 day old hamsters with hereditary cardiomyopathy (BIO 14.6 strain) was studied with the intent of learning more about the previously documented relationship of stimulation with beta-adrenergic agonist and the sarcolemmal defect contributing to the excessive uptake of calcium by diseased cells. Before catecholamine treatment only slight differences were observed in the configuration of action potentials of myopathics and control random bred hamsters (BIO RB strain). However, isoprenaline in varying concentrations, increased the action potential duration (APD) at 50% and 95% repolarisation levels to a significantly greater extent in myopathics than in controls. Repetition of the dose-response to isoprenaline in the presence of the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (0.1 mumol X litre-1) permitted the calculation of the dissociation equilibrium constant for the antagonist. The similarity of dissociation constants between strains, 0.008 mumol X litre-1 for controls and 0.011 mumol X litre-1 for myopathics, suggests that a difference in interstrain receptor affinities is an unlikely cause of the isoprenaline effect. Rather, the data are more consistent with the hyper-sensitivity resulting from larger numbers of beta-adrenoceptors on sarcolemma of myopathic cells. Also, the increase in APD of myopathics indicates that isoproterenol elicits an imbalance of slow inward calcium and late outward potassium currents. The possible significance of the isoprenaline hyper-sensitivity, which is the earliest pathophysiology seen in this disease, to the etiology of cellular calcium overload and degeneration of diseased myocardium remains to be determined.", 
    "41": "Aphthous lesions in the oral mucosa (OM) were simulated in dog experiments by ligation of the common bile duct. In one of the experimental groups the beta-adrenoblocker propranolol was administered 30 min before surgery. Two hours after surgery the animals manifested changes in blood microcirculation of the OM. In animals treated with propranolol, the characteristics of blood microcirculation remained within normal. It is concluded that the development of aphthous lesions is preceded by functional disorders of blood microcirculation in the OM which are probably related to alterations in the neurovascular system.", 
    "42": "The effects of separate 5 day pretreatments of propranolol 120 mg day-1 and 720 mg day-1 on theophylline clearance and metabolism at steady-state were determined in seven healthy males. Propranolol 120 mg day-1 decreased theophylline plasma clearance (CL) by 30%. Clearance of theophylline to each metabolite was reduced by this treatment, clearances to the two demethylated products by 42-43% and clearance to the 8-hydroxylation product by 27%. Propranolol 720 mg day-1 decreased theophylline CL by 52%. Again, clearance of theophylline to each metabolite was reduced by this treatment, clearances to the two demethylation products by 73-77% and clearance to the 8-hydroxylation product by 44%. These data are consistent with a dose-dependent and selective inhibitory effect of propranolol on the separate forms of cytochrome P-450 involved in theophylline demethylation and 8-hydroxylation.", 
    "43": "Effects of long-term treatment with pindolol (10 mg twice daily) and metoprolol (100 mg twice daily) on lung function and blood pressure were investigated in eight patients with chronic obstructive lung disease and hypertension. After a placebo period, both beta-adrenoceptor blockers were administered double-blind and cross-over for 4 weeks. By assessing parameters of expiratory flow an attempt was made to distinguish between large and small airways function. Diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly during both pindolol and metoprolol (P less than 0.01). Except for a decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) during metoprolol treatment, there was no other change in expiratory flow parameters after placebo or both beta-adrenoceptor blockers. Inhalation of terbutaline induced a small improvement in large airways function after placebo and metoprolol, but not after pindolol; there was no effect of terbutaline on parameters of small airways function. If a beta-adrenoceptor blocker is necessary in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease, a beta 1-adrenoceptor selective blocker is preferred in combination with bronchodilator agents.", 
    "44": "To test the usefulness of noninvasive ambulatory 24-hour blood pressure recording, the Del Mar Avionics system was used in a double-blind clinical trial in which 31 hypertensive patients were randomly allocated to receive placebo or pafenolol (25 mg or 50 mg), a novel, long-acting, highly selective beta-blocker, once daily. The results of 24-hour blood pressure and heart rate recording after 4 weeks of treatment were compared with a previous 24-hour recording performed after a 4-week placebo run-in period using the 3-hour mean of recordings performed every 7.5 minutes both day and night. Furthermore, 24-hour means were analyzed in each patient before and after 4 weeks. The system was easy to use and, judging from two placebo periods in the same patients, the reproducibility was good. The 24-hour blood pressure and heart rate recordings showed a clear dose-response relationship for pafenolol that could not be detected by ordinary casual readings. A daily dose of 25 mg of pafenolol significantly reduced blood pressure during the 9 hours after tablet intake (p less than 0.01), while 50 mg per day of pafenolol resulted in a significant reduction throughout the 24-hour period (p less than 0.01). The same pattern was seen for heart rate, which indicates a greater degree of beta-blockade during treatment with the higher dose. These results indicate that the tested noninvasive equipment is a useful tool for monitoring ambulatory 24-hour blood pressure. It gives important information impossible to obtain from single casual readings. This noninvasive method should be further evaluated to define its place in clinical work and as a research tool.", 
    "45": "Because injury to the pulmonary vascular endothelium is associated with the development of the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), we assessed the metabolic function of pulmonary endothelial cells by the measurements of the first-pass pulmonary extraction of [14C]serotonin and [3H]propranolol in 15 patients with ARDS and 15 patients at risk for developing ARDS. Serotonin extraction ratio was lower in patients with ARDS (0.85 +/- 0.10, mean +/- SD) than in patients at risk (0.91 +/- 0.04) (p less than 0.025), and both values were significantly reduced (p less than 0.005) when compared with a control group value (0.97 +/- 0.01). The decrease in serotonin extraction was correlated with the severity of ARDS (r = -0.67) (p less than 0.001) and with pulmonary function changes over time. Propranolol extraction ratio was decreased in patients at risk (0.66 +/- 0.11) (p less than 0.005) but not in patients with ARDS (0.75 +/- 0.11), when compared with those in the control group (0.81 +/- 0.03). Low values in patients at risk were restored to normal by continuous positive airway pressure breathing. We conclude that pulmonary extraction of serotonin, an index of pulmonary endothelial cell function, correlates with the severity of ARDS.", 
    "46": "End-systolic pressure-volume relationship (ESPVR) of the in situ heart in the dog was measured during changes in contractile state and was compared with end-systolic pressure-length (ESPLR) or stress-strain relationship (ESSSR). Circumferential segmental length and wall thickness at the equator and external long and short axis diameters of the left ventricle (LV) were determined sonomicrometrically, and LV volume was calculated by an ellipsoidal model. Circumferential wall stress at the equator was calculated by a very thin shell model. Contractile state was enhanced by an intravenous infusion of dobutamine and was suppressed by propranolol. ESPVR, ESPLR, and ESSSR were determined during a reduction of arterial pressure by occluding temporarily the inferior caval vein (IVC). ESPVR, ESPLR, and ESSSR during changes in end-systolic pressure from 108 +/- 3 to 71 +/- 2 mmHg were linear, irrespective of inotropic states (r greater than 0.92). Slopes of these relationships increased similarly in case of dobutamine and were reduced after propranolol, yet the extrapolated X-axis intercept of ESPVR, ESPLR, and ESSSR remained unchanged. Thus the slope of ESPVR is unique to the inotropic state, and both ESPLR and ESSSR are useful as a substitute for ESPVR when there is no regional wall motion abnormality.", 
    "47": "Norepinephrine concentration and turnover (measured by the time-dependent loss of tissue [3H]norepinephrine specific activity) were reduced in the brown adipose tissue (BAT) of obese Zucker rats but were normal in the heart. After acclimation to a 4 degrees C environment for 7 days, BAT norepinephrine turnover was increased to similar levels in lean and obese rats. After overfeeding with sucrose BAT norepinephrine turnover increased in lean rats but was unaffected in obese rats. Propranolol prevented the normalization of BAT mitochondrial GDP binding that followed adrenalectomy of obese rats. Adrenalectomy of obese rats restored BAT norepinephrine turnover to levels observed in lean rats. However, the increase in BAT GDP binding associated with sucrose overfeeding of adrenalectomized lean and obese rats was neither prevented by propranolol nor associated with a stimulation of norepinephrine turnover. The results suggest that the pituitary-adrenal endocrine axis may influence diet-related BAT thermogenesis and that this influence is only partially mediated by the sympathetic nervous system.", 
    "48": "The hemodynamic dose-response effects of intravenous (25 and 50 mg) and oral (200 and 400 mg) acebutolol were compared in a randomized between-group study in men within 17 hours of an acute uncomplicated myocardial infarction. Six subjects were evaluated in each of the four groups. After a 1-hour control period, hemodynamic variables and plasma drug concentrations were determined at 15 (intravenous therapy only), 30, 60, 90, 120, and 240 minutes after dosing. At the doses studied, hemodynamic dose-response effects were not evident after either intravenous or oral acebutolol. In all groups acebutolol reduced systolic and mean systemic arterial pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, and stroke volume. Pulmonary artery occluded pressure and systemic vascular resistance were transiently increased. Maximum changes developed between 15 and 30 minutes after intravenous dosing and between 1 and 2 hours after oral dosing. However, there were substantial reductions in cardiac output (-0.7 L/min/m2; P less than 0.05) by 30 minutes after oral dosing. Effects lasted for 2 hours after intravenous dosing and for 4 hours after oral dosing. Our data confirm the hemodynamic safety of acebutolol after acute myocardial infarction. The relevance of the time-dependent hemodynamic differences between intravenous and oral initiation of beta-blockade to the overall goal of reducing myocardial oxygen requirements after acute coronary artery occlusion merits closer examination.", 
    "49": "Metoprolol, a selective beta 1-adrenoreceptor blocker, was administered to two patients with intermittent explosive disorder who had not done well with previous medications, including propranolol and carbamazepine. Both patients improved dramatically, suggesting clinical and theoretical relevance.", 
    "50": "There is evidence suggesting that thyrotoxicosis increases beta-adrenoreceptor density on some target tissues. We have studied the in vivo effect of D,L-propranolol (a nonselective beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agent) on T3-induced enhancement of in situ proteolysis in fast twitch muscle fibers of the rat. Chronic treatment with T3 as opposed to saline resulted in a 76% enhancement of the rate of in situ muscle proteolysis [0.79 +/- 0.04 (n = 8) compared with 0.45 +/- 0.01 (n = 8) nmol tyrosine/mg muscle . 2 h]. Treatment of rats with both T3 and 2 mg propranolol resulted in a 62% reduction in the T3-induced increment in situ muscle proteolysis [0.58 +/- 0.02 (n = 8) vs. 0.79 +/- 0.04]. This significant inhibition by propranolol of T3-induced enhanced proteolytic rates in vitro suggests that this may comprise one component of the observed beneficial clinical effects of beta-blockade in thyrotoxic myopathy.", 
    "51": "In 12 conscious dogs, a three-dimensional array of pulse-transit ultrasonic transducers was used to measure left ventricular anterior-posterior minor, septal-free wall minor, and basal-apical major diameters. Matched micromanometers measured left ventricular, right ventricular, and intrapleural pressures. Electromagnetic ascending aortic blood flow and right ventricular transverse diameter were measured in five of the dogs. A major cause of the inspiratory decline in stroke volume in this preparation appeared to be reflex tachycardia and autonomic changes associated with inspiration. However, when heart rate was controlled by atrial pacing or pharmacologic autonomic attenuation (propranolol and atropine), stroke volume still decreased around 10%, with an inspiratory decrease in pleural pressure of 10 mm Hg. Based on the measurements of ventricular dimension, venous return to the right ventricle appeared to be augmented significantly during inspiration and the transient increase in right ventricular volume was associated with leftward interventricular septal shifting and altered diastolic left ventricular geometry. However, left ventricular end-diastolic volume was changed minimally, implying that alterations in preload were not important. Moreover, transmural left ventricular ejection pressure, calculated as intracavitary minus pleural pressure, was not significantly changed, and it seemed that neither pressure nor geometric components of afterload were altered significantly by inspiration. The inspiratory fall in left ventricular stroke volume correlated best with the decline in intracavitary left ventricular ejection pressure referenced to atmospheric pressure. It is hypothesized that during ejection, left ventricular pressure referenced to atmospheric pressure is the hydraulic force effecting stroke volume and that the decline in this effective left ventricular ejection pressure is responsible for the inspiratory fall in stroke volume through a reverse thoracic pump mechanism.", 
    "52": "Sotalol is a unique beta-blocker that lengthens cardiac repolarization and effective refractory period (ERP). Its efficacy after intravenous (1.5 mg/kg) and oral (160 to 480 mg bid) administration was therefore evaluated in 37 patients with refractory recurrent ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF). Thirty-five patients, 33 with inducible VT/VF, underwent electrophysiologic testing. Intravenous sotalol lengthened the ERP in the atrium (+24.6%, p less than .01), atrioventricular node (+24.9%, p less than .01), and ventricle (+14.9%, p less than .01). It also significantly lengthened sinus node recovery time, corrected QT interval (QTc), and the AH interval, but not the HV interval. Sotalol prevented reinduction of VT/VF in 15 patients (45.5%). Twenty-five of the 33 patients (15 with positive results of electrophysiologic tests; 10 with negative results) were given oral sotalol. The drug was ineffective in seven (26.9%) and aggravated arrhythmia in one (3.8%). In four patients sotalol was withdrawn because of side effects; arrhythmias recurred late in two (7.7%). Eleven patients (42.3%) have continued on oral sotalol over a mean follow-up period of 9.2 +/- 8.6 months. Sotalol reduced (n = 21) total premature ventricular complex (PVC) count on the Holter electrocardiogram by 73% (p less than .01), paired PVCs by 89% (p less than .01), and beats of ventricular tachycardia by 95% (p less than .01). In 52% (n = 11), total reduction in PVCs was at least 85%, and incidence of paired and tachycardiac beats was reduced at least 90% (group A). In the remainder (n = 10), PVC suppression was not significant (group B). Group A included nine patients with nonreinducible VT/VF and two in whom it was reinducible; in group B, eight of 10 patients had reinducible VT/VF. The difference between the two groups (Fisher exact test) was significant (p less than .01). The prevention of reinduction of VT/VF by intravenous sotalol and suppression of spontaneously occurring arrhythmias by the oral drug were both predictive of long-term drug efficacy. Sotalol is a significant advance in the short- and long-term management of life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias.", 
    "53": "The role played by catecholamines in the initiation of certain forms of ventricular tachycardia is now recognised. On the other hand, a similar predominant or exclusive mechanism has not been demonstrated in supraventricular tachycardia. We observed a rate case of reproducible attacks of junctional tachycardia on effort in a 45 year old man. This patient had experienced attacks of tachycardia on effort for a number of years, stopping about 10 minutes after the end of effort. An exercise stress test performed for an anginal attack, induced a narrow complex tachycardia at 270/min at the first minute of the recovery period which terminated spontaneously 18 minutes later after a brief episode of atrial fibrillation. During a second exercise stress test, an episode of tachycardia at 250/min was recorded at the second minute of recovery, lasting 11 minutes. Investigations showed a retrograde concealed septal bundle of Kent activated retrogradely during reciprocating tachycardia. A similar form of tachycardia was induced by an injection of isoproterenol. The adrenergic mechanism of the arrhythmia led to the prescription of a beta-blocker (propranolol 120 mg/day), which effectively prevented clinical tachycardia and the forms of tachycardia induced by ergometric tests 15 days and 3 months after the initiation of treatment.", 
    "54": "Twenty-five patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy confirmed by clinical, echocardiographic and haemodynamic investigations were treated with high dose propranolol (320 to 800 mg/day, average 420 mg/day) and assessed after an average follow-up period of 25 months. The effects of treatment were assessed by interrogation in all patients and by exercise testing before and after propranolol in 19 cases. Comparative echocardiographic (21 patients) Holter (20 patients) and catheter studies (14 patients) were also performed. The cardiovascular mortality rate during the study period was nil. All patients were symptomatic before treatment; 9 became asymptomatic and 13 patients were improved, the average functional score decreasing from 5.16 +/- 2.15 to 2.28 +/- 1.49 (p less than 0.001). The persistence of severe symptoms led to withdrawal of the beta-blocker in 2 cases. There was a parallel improvement in maximal work capacity during exercise stress testing (96 +/- 27 watts vs 117 +/- 30 watts, p less than 0.01). A resting intraventricular pressure gradient was recorded in 12 of the 14 patients undergoing repeat catheter study which decreased after propranolol from an average of 66.75 +/- 32.72 mmHg to 42.75 +/- 37.6 mmHg (p less than 0.05). Left ventricular end diastolic pressures remained unchanged. The change in pressure gradient did not correlate with the symptomatology and there were no associated echocardiographic changes. The Holter monitoring did not show any improvement of ventricular hyperexcitability under propranolol: the number of patients with complex ventricular arrhythmias remained unchanged (7 patients).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "55": "6 patients, 4 men and 2 women, aged 38 to 60 years, were hospitalised for chest pain on effort, labelled as angina. The resting electrocardiogram was normal, except in 2 cases with incomplete left bundle branch block. Exercise stress testing induced simultaneous chest pain and complete left bundle branch block (LBBB) (at a rate of 15 to 160 beats/min, mean 115). The pain lasted as long as the LBBB was present and eased as it disappeared. All patients had normal coronary angiography and negative provocative tests of coronary spasm with atrial stimulation (4 cases), isoprenaline test (2 cases), atropine injection (2 cases) and nitroglycerin (1 case). A 2D echocardiogram performed in all the patients, showed no signs of myocardial disease. Myocardial perfusion on effort was studied by Thallium 201 scintigraphy in all 6 patients. There were no perfusion defects. An exercise stress test was performed after beta-blocker treatment in 3 patients. LBBB appeared each time and the pain was always present. The induction of bradycardia with propranolol (5 cases) or verapamil (3 cases) did not reduce the frequency of chest pain. No serious complications were observed during follow-up (myocardial infarction, death). The syndrome of painful LBBB is not related exclusively to tachycardia. Myocardial ischaemia does not seem to be the underlying mechanism judged by the negative thallium studies.", 
    "56": "The effects of a variety of currently-used anti-anginal drugs on major hemorheologic parameters (blood viscosity in the 0.692-2348 s-1 variation rates range, plasma viscosity, erythrocyte and platelet function) and also the hemostatic system were examined in 100 chronic coronary patients during specific treatment courses. The nitrates, beta-blockers (alone or in combinations), cordaron and molsidomin were shown to produce positive effects on blood rheology. A relationship was demonstrated between physical stress tolerance and blood viscosity pattern in propranolol-treated coronary patients. It is suggested that positive hemorheologic effects of anti-anginal drugs may be an important constituent of their therapeutic action and, as such, provide an additional marker of their efficiency in coronary heart disease.", 
    "57": "Antianginal therapy with long-acting nitrates, beta-blockers, and combinations there of were administered depending on the baseline cardiovascular function, as assessed by spiroergometry, in 300 patients with chronic coronary heart disease. Three degrees of the hypokinetic type corresponding to the degrees of myocardial failure were identified on the basis of adaptability patterns and the disturbance of correlations between the increment in oxygen consumption, heart rate, cardiac output, and the output of work done. It is shown that cardiovascular status should be taken into account in selecting the type of antianginal therapy for chronic coronary patients.", 
    "58": "A variety of anti-anginal drugs and their combinations were selected in a group of patients with stable angina of effort, with the effects assessed by bicycle ergometry. Effective doses of propranolol, corinfar, finoptin provided for at least 3 minutes' increment in the duration of the effort. Combinations of these drugs in doses reduced by half produced a more pronounced increment in the duration of the effort, an observation suggestive of synergistic anti-anginal effects of calcium antagonists and beta-blockers.", 
    "59": "Thyroliberin increases the cerebral blood flow both in anesthesized cats and unanesthetized rabbits under hemorrhagic shock. At the same time the increase of the arterial pressure is observed, caused by activation of the sympathoadrenal system. This is confirmed by experiments with the removal of the hypertensive reaction to thyroliberin after the use of the alpha-adrenoblockers. Analysis of the action mode of thyroliberin on the cerebral circulation with the use of atropine, dihydroergotoxin and propranolol allowed one to establish the involvement of beta-adrenoreceptors of the cerebral vessels in mediation of the cerebrovascular effect of the drug. The thyroliberin ability to improve the cerebral circulation under pronounced hypotension as well as to make the arterial pressure return to normal underlies its positive effect on the lifespan of animals under hemorrhagic shock.", 
    "60": "Three groups of cats were given aspirin in single dosages of 5, 10, and 25 mg/kg. A 4th group was given 2 dosages of 25 mg/kg, 3 days between doses. The degree of inhibition of platelet function and the duration of antagonism to platelet aggregation were studied. The dosage of 25 mg/kg (single and repeated) consistently inhibited platelet function, and the effects lasted 3 to 5 days. Additive drug effect was not noted in group 4, since the 2nd dosage antagonized platelet function to a degree and duration similar to the effects of the 1st. The dosage of aspirin recommended for antiplatelet activity in the average-sized cat (3 kg) equals approximately 1 pediatric aspirin (90 mg) given twice a week. Propranolol, given to cats at dosages of 2.5 to 15 mg had no effect on platelet aggregation.", 
    "61": "Relative effects of equihypotensive doses (-35 mmHg) of adenosine (5.0 mumol/kg) and nitroglycerin (25 micrograms/kg) on heart rate and, therefore, baroreflex sensitivity were studied in conscious dogs. Nitroglycerin increased heart rate 133 +/- 24% from 78 +/- 5.5 beats/min, whereas adenosine increased heart rate only 79 +/- 16% from 78 +/- 5.2 beats/min (P less than 0.01). Injection of nitroglycerin during combined beta-adrenergic and muscarinic receptor blockades caused arterial pressure to fall 38 +/- 3.4% from 107 +/- 3.2 mmHg without any significant change in heart rate (3.8 +/- 3.8 from 162 +/- 9.2 beats/min). During combined beta-adrenergic and muscarinic receptor blockades adenosine also reduced arterial pressure 45 +/- 2.7% from 106 +/- 2.9 mmHg but unexpectedly reduced heart rate as well by 37 +/- 1.7% from 160 +/- 9.7 beats/min. This bradycardia reflected an effect on the sinoatrial (SA) node rather than an induction of heart block, since the R-R interval increased by 70 +/- 7.8% from 371 +/- 20 ms (P less than 0.01), while the P-R interval increased only 13 +/- 2.3% from 97 +/- 7.2 ms (P less than 0.05) with no electrocardiographic evidence of nonconducted beats. Arterial plasma adenosine levels were 43 +/- 5 nmol/ml at this time. Adenosine also caused bradycardia during muscarinic blockade alone (-43 +/- 3.4% from 201 +/- 6.4 beats/min) and following bilateral vagal section (-33 +/- 1.9% from 151 +/- 5.9 beats/min). In summary, adenosine appears to alter normal baroreflex function in the conscious dog by reducing the tachycardia that normally follows a fall in systemic arterial pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "62": "Neuropeptide Y (NPY), which co-exists with noradrenaline (NA) in postganglionic sympathetic nerves, was able to potentiate NA-evoked constriction in certain isolated rabbit blood vessels. The phenomenon was observed in the femoral, the gastroepiploic and the pulmonary arteries but not in the femoral or the gastroepiploic veins or in the aorta. Thus, NPY potentiated NA-evoked vasoconstriction predominantly in muscular arteries with alpha-1 adrenoceptors. NPY-related peptides, such as peptide YY and to some extent pancreatic polypeptide shared this ability, whereas calcitonin gene-related peptide or LPLRFamide did not. The mode of action by which NPY potentiates NA-evoked vasoconstriction was analyzed using the femoral artery. Pretreatment of the vessel with cocaine, a blocker of amine re-uptake, or rolipram, an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase, left the potentiation unaffected, whereas Na+ deficiency or ouabain, an inhibitor of Na+/K+-adenosine triphosphatase, abolished this effect of NPY. Nifedipine, a blocker of Ca++ entry, or removal of extracellular Ca++ shortly before the application of NPY had little effect. After prolonged exposure to a Ca++-free medium (with ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid) the maximum response to NA was greatly reduced and the potentiating effect of NPY was abolished. Thus, the potentiation of NA-evoked vasoconstriction by NPY seems to depend upon the presence of Na+ but not upon a Ca++ influx. An intracellular sequestered Ca++ pool appears to play a critical role.", 
    "63": "The diagnostic value of 24-hour ECG monitoring was assessed in 81 patients with stable angina of effort (functional classes II-IV) and 8 spontaneously-anginal patients. The pattern and frequency of transitory ST displacements, and their distribution by the hours of the day are reviewed. The results of 24-hour ECG monitoring are compared with clinical, bicycle-ergometric and coronaroangiographic findings. Spontaneously anginal patients showed peculiar episodes of transitory ischemia, with typically elevated ST, shorter duration and the occurrence mostly during the night and morning hours; 2/3 of such episodes were painless. High diagnostic value of the method for the assessment of the efficacy of anti-anginal drugs is demonstrated.", 
    "64": "Fetal cardiac arrhythmias are usually first suspected on the basis of auscultatory findings during routine examination in pregnancy. With improved ultrasonic equipment a more accurate diagnosis of the type of arrhythmia can be made, associated problems such as structural cardiac defects and cardiac compromise can be recognized, and the effects of intrauterine treatment schedules can be closely monitored. The success of intrauterine therapy depends first and foremost on accurate intrauterine diagnosis. Until now intrauterine therapy for fetal cardiac arrhythmias has remained almost entirely restricted to pharmacological interventions.", 
    "65": "Diltiazem was compared to atenolol in a double-blind trial involving 78 patients suffering from coronary heart disease. Following a 2 week control period, patients were randomly allocated to 6 weeks treatment with one or the other drug. The patients themselves made daily records of anginal attacks, trinitrate requirements, well-being and exercise tolerance. With both drugs there were highly significant reductions in the anginal attack rate and trinitrate requirements, and significant improvement on the other measures. However, there were no significant between drug differences. The incidence of side effects with diltiazem was very low and no patient had to omit treatment for this reason, although three patients did so on atenolol.", 
    "66": "Labetalol is a competitive, nonselective antagonist of both beta 1 and beta 2 adrenoceptors. It has been suggested that labetalol reduces blood pressure (BP) predominantly by decreasing peripheral vascular resistance while maintaining cardiac output. We conducted a double-blind, randomized study to assess the antihypertensive effect of labetalol in patients with a standing diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) between 105 and 119 mm Hg. The study consisted of three separate phases in succession. Phase I was a single-blind, placebo washout phase, two to four weeks in length. Those patients with a SDBP greater than or equal to 105 mm Hg at the end of phase I entered phase II, in which they were administered labetalol in a forced titration of 100 mg bid to 400 mg bid. Those with a SDBP less than or equal to 90 mm Hg on the 400 mg bid regimen for two weeks were maintained on labetalol alone (N = 8). Those patients whose BP was not controlled (SDBP greater than or equal to 99 mm Hg, N = 15) were randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive either hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) or placebo in addition to labetalol for the next five weeks. Eight of the 15 patients received HCTZ and seven received placebo. The BPs at baseline and at the end of phase II were similar in the two groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "67": "Captopril in low doses has been used recently with success in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension. In the present study we compared the effects of captopril, 50 mg/day, to propranolol, 80 mg/day, as second-line antihypertensive agents. By administering each of these drugs together with hydrochlorothiazide, the mean blood pressure was lowered from 156/99 to 140/84 and from 15/98 to 140/85 mm Hg, respectively. Although serious adverse effects were infrequent in both groups of patients, bradycardia and fatigue were common among the subjects receiving propranolol, whereas captopril left the quality of life largely unaltered. Captopril appears to be a safe and effective antihypertensive agent in mild and moderate hypertension when used in low doses in addition to a thiazide diuretic.", 
    "68": "Immunoreactive insulin levels (IRI) were measured by a homologous fish insulin radioimmunoassay. An in vitro pancreatic islet superfusion technique was employed to monitor the changes in IRI in the presence and absence of specific adrenergic agonists and antagonists. Exogenous adrenaline at low concentrations (10(-10) M) inhibited IRI release but evoked an IRI stimulation at high concentrations (10(-6) M). The stimulation of IRI by adrenaline is thought to involve beta-adrenoceptors located postsynaptically on the beta-cell membrane as the effect of adrenaline was mimicked by the beta-agonist, isoproterenol, and abolished by the beta-antagonist, propranolol. Phentolamine (an alpha-antagonist) potentiated the adrenergic stimulation of IRI, whereas yohimbine (an alpha 2-antagonist) was without effect. Phenylephrine (alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist) inhibited IRI release suggesting the presence of alpha 1-inhibitory adrenoceptors which exert a modulatory influence on adrenaline-stimulated insulin release.", 
    "69": "In a double-blind, cross-over trial, the migraine prophylactic effect of the beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist metoprolol was compared with that of clonidine. The dosage of metoprolol was 50 mg b.i.d. and of clonidine 50 micrograms b.i.d. Thirty-one patients were included; twenty-three completed the entire study. Six patients withdrew during clonidine treatment, one during metoprolol treatment and one during the wash-out period (placebo). Metoprolol had a significantly better migraine prophylactic effect than clonidine regarding such parameters as the attack frequency, the number of migraine days and the sum of intensity score. Compared to baseline (placebo), metoprolol decreased these parameters, while clonidine did not. Metoprolol, but not clonidine, also reduced the acute consumption of analgesics. No differences were found as regards side effects.", 
    "70": "Assessments of hourly pain scores (0 to 4) were made in 135 patients during the initial 24 hours after admission to the hospital. The duration of chest pain and the cumulative pain score obtained by adding the pain scores hour by hour were compared to ST and QRS vector changes and CK release. The cumulative pain score over a 24-hour period after admission correlated to the maximal QRS vector difference (r = 0.51) and the cumulative CK release (r = 0.58). The time until patients had complete relief of pain was closely related to the time during which QRS vector changes were seen to continue (r = 0.73). No corresponding correlation was found between pain duration and CK release time (r = 0.24). The ST decline time correlated to the duration of the first uninterrupted episode of chest pain in the placebo group only (r = 0.50). Pain duration showed no correlation to our indices of infarct size. There was a recurrence of pain in 41% of the patients, of whom 36% had a time-associated further increase of the ST vector magnitude. We conclude that chest pain is an important clinical symptom that signals ongoing necrosis. Furthermore, assessments of a \"soft\" parameter, such as the cumulative pain score, can add valuable information concerning the severity of myocardial damage.", 
    "71": "It has been suspected that the increased sympathetic activity seen in patients with chronic congestive heart failure from dilated cardiomyopathy may be harmful. We therefore tested the long-term effect of metoprolol on eight patients in a double-blind, randomized protocol and 12 patients in an unblinded, crossover protocol who were treated for 12 months (range 10 to 24), and compared them with 16 similar subjects who were treated with placebo for 10 months (range 6 to 12) in a double-blind, randomized protocol. Patients were followed by serial clinical assessment, treadmill testing, radionuclide ventriculography, and echocardiography. Metoprolol-treated patients had an improvement in mean exercise capacity by 3 mets (p less than .0001) while experiencing a significant improvement in functional classification (p less than .001) during both the double-blind and open-label crossover studies and had an improved ejection fraction during the double-blind study (p less than .02). These improvements were not seen in matched control subjects receiving placebo. Seven of 20 patients receiving long-term metoprolol therapy had resolution of nearly all symptoms of heart failure, doubled their exercise capacity, and had progressive improvement in resting radionuclide left ventricular ejection fraction (12.6 +/- 3% to 26.9 +/- 6%) and echocardiographic left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (7.7 +/- 0.5 to 6.5 +/- 0.5 cm). Only one of 21 patients treated was intolerant of metoprolol. We conclude that metoprolol can be given safely to a select group of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy in doses that substantially reduce both resting and exercise heart rates. Long-term beta-blockade improved functional class and exercise capacity in 14 of 20 patients while producing an exceptional clinical response in seven that was accompanied by improved resting parameters of left ventricular function.", 
    "72": "A patient with Marfan's syndrome suffered aortic dissection with subsequent aortic arch replacement and coronary artery bypass grafts during pregnancy. Antepartum therapy consisted of bed rest, heparin anticoagulation, propranolol and fetal evaluation. After amniocentesis to determine fetal lung maturity, cesarean section with epidural anesthesia and invasive hemodynamic monitoring was performed at 34 weeks' gestation, resulting in delivery of a viable girl without demonstrable congenital abnormalities. The maternal postoperative course was uneventful. This report is the first of such a case.", 
    "73": "Two different electrophysiological responses in amphibian sympathetic ganglia were studied by means of the sucrose gap technique; the potassium-activated hyperpolarization (KH) which serves as an index of electrogenic Na+ pumping, and the hyperpolarization induced by adrenaline (AdH). Under appropriate experimental conditions, 0.1 microM adrenaline potentiated the KH to 121.5 +/- 7.5% of control (n = 7). This potentiation was blocked by both yohimbine (50 nM) and prazosin (1 microM) but not by propranolol (1 microM). Clonidine (10 nM) potentiated the KH to 113.5 +/- 3.4% of control (n = 5), whereas methoxamine (0.1 microM) was ineffective. Several lines of evidence argued against the hypothesis that the AdH may be generated, in whole or in part, by stimulation of the Na+ pump. For example, the AdH was sometimes completely unaffected when the KH was blocked by ouabain, and the AdH was eliminated by 2 mM Ba2+ even though this cation enhanced membrane hyperpolarization accompanying electrogenic Na+ pumping. These results imply that the electrogenic Na+ pump is not involved in the short-term electrophysiological effects of catecholamines. Despite this, it is possible that the homeostasis of Na+ and K+ in nerve may be regulated by alpha-adrenergic mechanisms.", 
    "74": "We have compared the clinical and metabolic responses of three groups of patients undergoing subtotal thyroidectomy for hyperthyroid Graves' disease. These patients were prepared for surgery with propranolol alone, propranolol plus potassium iodide or the long acting beta-adrenoceptor antagonist nadolol plus potassium iodide. Pre-treatment with potassium iodide reduced serum T4 to normal or subnormal in all patients. Patients in the propranolol group had significantly higher pulse rates and temperatures after operation and one patient developed an exacerbation of the hypermetabolic state. The perioperative rise in serum cortisol and blood glucose was delayed in patients in the propranolol group and this was also noted in one severely hyperthyroid patient on propranolol + potassium iodide. Nadolol was administered once daily as compared to multiple daily doses with propranolol. Despite this, plasma nadolol levels were consistently higher throughout the perioperative period while propranolol levels in patients on both propranolol alone and propranolol + potassium iodide were highly variable and sometimes undetectable. We conclude that, in the rapid preparation of patients with hyperthyroid Graves' disease for surgery, the combination of nadolol + potassium iodide has significant advantages over the other two regimens.", 
    "75": "To study the mechanism of catcholamine-induced positive inotropy, sarcolemmal membrane proteins were isolated from freeze-clamped rabbit hearts perfused with [32P] and proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The major phosphorylated proteins were of apparent molecular mass 27,000 and 14,000 Da. Bolus injections of epinephrine increased phosphorylation of the 27,000 Da protein 2- and to 3-fold coincidentally with increases in developed tension. With epinephrine washout contractility returned to control levels in 2 minutes but dephosphorylation was not complete by 10 minutes. Phosphorylation of the 27,000 Da protein induced by epinephrine was dose dependent and could also be stimulated by isoproterenol and blocked by propranolol. Phenylephrine and ouabain did not stimulate phosphorylation. Forskolin, the beta-adrenergic acting drug, stimulated contractility and also increased phosphorylation. The results suggest that phosphorylation of the 27,000 Da protein may be involved in mediating increases in tension, though the lack of coincidence between dephosphorylation and decline in tension with time suggests a complicated relationship possibly involving other factors."
