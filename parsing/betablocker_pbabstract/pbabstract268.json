Risk factors include coronary artery disease, renal insufficiency, diabetes, and smoking. Essential strategies for prevention of heart failure are modification of risk factors for its development, and detection and treatment of asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction (ALVD). In patients with ALVD, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and beta-blocker therapy can prevent progression to symptomatic heart failure. Additional recently identified preventative strategies include ACE inhibitor therapy for all coronary artery disease and diabetic patients, clopidogrel therapy in acute coronary syndromes, and avoidance of calcium channel blockers and alpha-blockers as first-line antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "1": "1. Intestinal xenobiotic transporters are a significant barrier to the absorption of many orally administered drugs. P-glycoprotein (PGP) is the best known, but several others, including members of the multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) family, are also expressed. Definitive information on their precise effect on intestinal drug permeability is scarce due to a lack of specific inhibitors and the difficulty of studying non-PGP activity in the presence of high PGP expression. 2. We have investigated the in vitro use of intestinal tissues from PGP knockout (mdr1a (-/-)) mice as a tool for dissecting the mechanisms of intestinal drug efflux. The permeability characteristics of digoxin (DIG), paclitaxel (TAX) and etoposide (ETOP) were measured in ileum from mdr1a (-/-) and wild-type (FVB) mice mounted in Ussing chambers. 3. DIG and TAX exhibited marked efflux across FVB tissues (B-A : A-B apparent permeability (P(app)) ratio 10 and 17 respectively) which was absent in mdr1a (-/-) tissues, confirming that PGP is the sole route of intestinal efflux for these compounds. The A-B P(app) of both compounds was 3 - 5 fold higher in mdr1a (-/-) than in FVB. 4. Polarized transport of ETOP in FVB tissues was reduced but not abolished in mdr1a (-/-) tissues. Residual ETOP efflux in mdr1a (-/-) tissues was abolished by the MRP inhibitor MK571, indicating involvement of both PGP and MRP. 5. MK571 abolished calcein efflux in mdr1a (-/-) tissues, while quinidine had no parallel effect in FVB tissues, suggesting involvement of MRP but not PGP. 6. Tissues from mdr1a (-/-) mice provide a novel approach for investigating the influence of PGP ablation on intestinal permeability and for resolving PGP and non-PGP mechanisms that modulate drug permeability.", 
    "2": "1. We evaluated the role of the cross-linking of Fc epsilon RI-mediated inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP(3)) in the increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) level ([Ca(2+)](i)) using xestospongin C, a selective membrane permeable blocker of IP(3) receptor, in RBL-2H3 mast cells. 2. In the cells sensitized with anti-dinitrophenol (DNP) IgE, DNP-human serum albumin (DNP-HSA) and thapsigargin induced degranulation of beta-hexosaminidase and a sustained increase in [Ca(2+)](i). Xestospongin C (3 - 10 microM) inhibited both of these changes that were induced by DNP-HSA without changing those induced by thapsigargin. 3. In the absence of external Ca(2+), DNP-HSA induced a transient increase in [Ca(2+)](i). Xestospongin C (3 - 10 microM) inhibited this increase in [Ca(2+)](i). 4. In the cells permeabilized with beta-escin, the application of IP(3) decreased Ca(2+) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as evaluated by mag-fura-2. Xestospongin C (3 - 10 microM) inhibited the effect of IP(3). 5. After the depletion of Ca(2+) stores due to stimulation with DNP-HSA or thapsigargin, the addition of Ca(2+) induced capacitative calcium entry (CCE). Xestospongin C (3 - 10 microM) inhibited the DNP-HSA-induced CCE, whereas it did not affect the thapsigargin-induced CCE. 6. These results suggest that Fc epsilon RI-mediated generation of IP(3) contributes to Ca(2+) release not only in the initial phase but also in the sustained phase of the increase in [Ca(2+)](i), resulting in prolonged Ca(2+) depletion in the ER. The ER Ca(2+) depletion may subsequently activate CCE to achieve a continuous [Ca(2+)](i) increase, which is necessary for degranulation in the RBL-2H3 mast cells. Xestospongin C may inhibit Ca(2+) release and consequently may attenuate degranulation.", 
    "3": "1. This study characterizes the mouse beta(3a)-adrenoceptor (AR) and the splice variant of the beta(3)-AR (beta(3b)-AR) expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1). 2. Stable clones with high (approximately 1200), medium (approximately 500) or low receptor expression (approximately 100 fmol mg protein(-1)) were determined by saturation binding with [(125)I]-(-)-cyanopindolol. Competition binding studies showed no significant differences in affinity of beta-AR ligands for either receptor. 3. Several functional responses of each receptor were measured, namely extracellular acidification rate (EAR; cytosensor microphysiometer), cyclic AMP accumulation, and Erk1/2 phosphorylation. The beta(3)-AR agonists BRL37344, CL316243, GR265162X, L755507, SB251023, the non-conventional partial beta-AR agonist CGP12177 and the beta-AR agonist (-)-isoprenaline caused concentration-dependent increases in EAR in cells expressing either splice variant. CL316243 caused concentration-dependent increases in cyclic AMP accumulation and Erk1/2 phosphorylation in cells expressing either receptor. 4. PTX treatment increased maximum EAR and cyclic AMP responses to CL316243 in cells expressing the beta(3b)-AR but not in cells expressing the beta(3a)-AR at all levels of receptor expression. 5. CL316243 increased Erk1/2 phosphorylation with pEC(50) values and maximum responses that were not significantly different in cells expressing either splice variant. Erk1/2 phosphorylation was insensitive to PTX or H89 (PKA inhibitor) but was inhibited by LY294002 (PI3K gamma inhibitor), PP2 (c-Src inhibitor), genistein (tyrosine kinase inhibitor) and PD98059 (MEK inhibitor). 6. The adenylate cyclase activators forskolin or cholera toxin failed to increase Erk1/2 levels although both treatments markedly increased cyclic AMP accumulation in both beta(3a)- or beta(3b)-AR transfected cells. 7. These results suggest that in CHO-K1 cells, the beta(3b)-AR, can couple to both G(s) and G(i) to stimulate and inhibit cyclic AMP production respectively, while the beta(3a)-AR, couples solely to G(s) to increase cyclic AMP levels. However, the increase in Erk1/2 phosphorylation following receptor activation is not dependent upon coupling of the receptors to G(i) or the generation of cyclic AMP.", 
    "4": "1. Experiments were carried out in conscious, chronically instrumented, male, Sprague-Dawley rats to delineate the regional haemodynamic effects of the putative endogenous cannabinoid, anandamide, (0.075 - 3 mg kg(-1)), and to dissect some of the mechanisms involved. 2. At all doses of anandamide, there was a significant, short-lived increase in mean arterial blood pressure associated with vasoconstriction in renal, mesenteric and hindquarters vascular beds. 3. The higher doses (2.5 and 3 mg kg(-1)), caused an initial, marked bradycardia accompanied, in some animals, by a fall in arterial blood pressure which preceded the hypertension. In addition, after the higher doses of anandamide, the hindquarters vasoconstriction was followed by vasodilatation. 4. Although some of the effects described above resembled those of 5-HT (25 microg kg(-1)), the bradycardia and hypotensive actions of the latter were abolished by the 5HT(3)-receptor antagonist, azasetron, whereas those of anandamide were generally unaffected. 5. None of the cardiovascular actions of anandamide were influenced by the CB(1)-receptor antagonist, AM 251, but its bradycardic effect was sensitive to atropine, and its hindquarters vasodilator action was suppressed by the beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist, ICI 118551. 6. The results differ, in several aspects, from those previously reported in anaesthetized animals, and underscore the important impact anaesthesia can have on responses to anandamide.", 
    "5": "Ca2+ channel blockers like nifedipine have been shown to increase the oral bioavailability of beta-lactam antibiotics, such as cefixime, in humans. The molecular mode of action of Ca2+ channel blockers on beta-lactam absorption, however, has not yet been defined. Using the Caco-2 human intestinal epithelial cell line, we assessed whether alterations in intracellular free Ca2+ ion (Ca2+in) concentrations by Ca2+ channel blockers or by Ca2+ ionophores affect [14C]cefixime absorption. Reduction of Ca2+in levels by Ca2+ channel blockers (nifedipine, verapamil, diltiazem, or bepridil) at concentrations of 100 microM led to 35 to 50% increases in the cellular uptake of 1 mM [14C]cefixime. Increases in Ca2+in levels by Ca2+ ionophores, on the other hand, led to 40% reductions in [14C]cefixime absorption. Nifedipine increased the V(max) of cefixime transport by 67%, whereas the K(m) of cefixime transport remained unaffected. By measuring the pH in Caco-2 cells loaded with the pH-sensitive fluorescent dye 2',7'-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(6)-carboxyfluorescein, we show that cefixime transport mediated by the intestinal H+-coupled peptide transporter PEPT1 leads to intracellular acidification. This acid load was reduced by nifedipine, although the Ca2+ channel blocker increased the level of H+ and cefixime cotransport. Increases in Ca2+in levels by ionomycin enhanced the decline in intracellular pH induced by cefixime alone, although ionomycin reduced the level of H+ and cefixime cotransport. In conclusion, our studies demonstrate that alterations of Ca2+in levels, e.g., by Ca2+ channel blockers, affect pH regulatory systems, such as apical Na+ and H+ exchange, and thereby alter the H+ gradient that serves as the driving force for uptake of beta-lactams into intestinal epithelial cells.", 
    "6": "This work reports a technique for the stabilization after storage in air of a lipid film based biosensor for atenolol. Microporous filters composed of glass fibers (nominal pore sizes 0.7 and 1.0 microm) were used as supports for the formation and stabilization of these devices. The lipid film is formed on the filter by polymerization prior to its use. Methacrylic acid was the functional monomer, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate was the crosslinker and 2,2'-azobis-(2-methylpropionitrile) was the initiator. The method for preparation of stabilized lipid film biosensor is studied throughout this work. The response towards atenolol of these stabilized lipid membrane biosensor, for repetitive use, composed of phosphatidylcholine was compared with planar freely suspended bilayer lipid membranes (BLMs). The stabilized lipid membranes provided similar artificial ion gating events as BLMs in the form of transient signals and can function for repetitive uses after storage in air. This will allow the practical use of the techniques for chemical sensing based on lipid films and commercialization of these devices.", 
    "7": "A peripheral 5-HT(2A) receptor-mediated hemodynamic change prompted formation of indole-2,3-dione, an endogenous inhibitor of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) receptor binding and G protein-mediated intracellular signaling (IC(50): 0.4 microM). This effect was significantly suppressed by dexamethasone, indomethacin and the 5-HT(2) receptor antagonists, ketanserin or ritanserin. 5-HT(2A) receptor-mediated acute hemodynamic change was not modified significantly by indomethacin, prazosin or propranolol pretreatment. A tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor, alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine, but not a dopamine beta hydroxylase inhibitor, diethyldithiocarbamate, abolished the 5-HT(2A) receptor-mediated increase in indole-2,3-dione. Exogenous indole-2,3-dione induced a significant increase in plasma catecholamine levels and decrease in urine volume. A 5-HT(2A) receptor-mediated decrease in capillary flow may have caused an inflammatory process and peripheral sympathetic activation via ANP signaling inhibition. 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA)/dopamine may contribute to the progression of inflammation or the generation of a precursor of indole-2,3-dione. The observation that indole-2,3-dione abolished angiotensin AT(1) receptor-mediated NADPH activation in both human umbilical vein endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells at 20 microM may suggest that sulfhydryl-reactive indole-2,3-dione could influence mitochondrial function and cellular redox states via flavoenzyme inhibition and/or regulation of dehydrogenase-oxidase conversion.",

In 92% of the 120 patients referred for cardiac transplantation evaluation, drug therapy could be optimized. A considerable number of patients could be subjected to an organ-preserving intervention or surgery, either PTCA (n=11), CABG (n=4), valve repair (n=7), multisite pacing (n=7), or partial ventricular resection (n=5).

    "12": "Estrogens could play a cardiovascular protective role not only by means of systemic effects but also by means of direct effects on vascular structure and function. We have studied the acute effects and mechanisms of action of 17-beta-estradiol on vascular tone of rabbit isolated carotid artery. 17-Beta-estradiol (10, 30, and 100 microM) elicited concentration-dependent relaxation of 50 mM KCl-induced active tone in male and female rabbit carotid artery. The stereoisomer 17-alpha-estradiol showed lesser relaxant effects in male rabbits. Endothelium removal did not modify relaxation induced by 17-beta-estradiol. The NO synthase inhibitor L-NAME (100 microM) only reduced significantly relaxation produced by 30 microM 17-beta-estradiol. Relaxation was not modified by the estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780 (1 microM), the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (1 microM), and the selective K(+) channel blockers charybdotoxin (0.1 microM) and glibenclamide (1 microM). CaCl(2) (30 microM -10 mM) induced concentration-dependent contraction in rabbit carotid artery depolarized by 50 mM KCl in Ca(2+) free medium. Preincubation with 17-beta-estradiol (3, 10, 30, or 100 microM) or the L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker nicardipine (0.01, 0.1, 1, or 10 nM) produced concentration-dependent inhibition of CaCl(2)-induced contraction. In conclusion, 17-beta-estradiol induces endothelium-independent relaxation of rabbit carotid artery, which is not mediated by classic estrogen receptor and protein synthesis activation. The relaxant effect is due to inhibition of extracellular Ca(2+) influx to vascular smooth muscle, but activation of K(+) efflux is not involved. Relatively high pharmacological concentrations of estrogen causing relaxation preclude acute vasoactive effects of plasma levels in the carotid circulation.", 
    "13": "Involvement of nitric oxide (NO) and beta-adrenoceptors in an increase in the cortical cerebral blood flow (CBF) following an intravenous (i.v.) injection of a small dose of nicotine which did not affect the systemic blood pressure in the rats was investigated. I.v. injection of nicotine (30 microg/kg) for 1 min produced a significant increase in CBF lasting for more than 20 min without a significant effect on the systemic blood pressure. I.v. injection of L-N(G)-nitroarginine methylester (30 mg/kg) significantly attenuated nicotine-induced increase in the cortical CBF. The attenuation was reversed by i.v. injection of L-arginine (300 mg/kg), suggesting an intimate role of nitric oxide (NO) in nicotine-induced increase in the cortical CBF. The nicotine-induced increase in the cortical CBF was significantly attenuated by propranolol (10 mg/kg, i.v.) and ICI 118,551 (a beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist, 10 mg/kg, i.v.) but not by metoprolol (a beta1-adrenoceptor antagonist, 10 mg/kg, i.v.). Beta2-adrenoceptors on presynaptic nitrergic nerves may be involved in nicotine-induced NO-mediated increase in the cortical CBF.", 
    "14": "Patients with severe systolic heart left ventricle dysfunction determine a group loaded by high mortality. Continuous search for prognostic factors as well as treatment methods influencing a prognosis coming from clinical effects of applied prescriptions and survival in the mentioned group of patients can be observed in many published reports. In the presented work a retrospective analysis has been performed with regard to 106 patients with severe heart lesion: 72 cases with ischaemic disease, 20 cases with post-inflammation heart lesion, 7 cases with hypertension and 7 cases with idiopathic congestive cardiomyopathy. The main criterion including particular patient into the group under analysis was less or equal to 30% ejection fraction confirmed by echocardiographical examination and generally understand heart insufficiency in the clinical examination and laboratory tests. The observation period concerning patients qualified to the analyzed group incorporated 36 +/- 16.5 months. Influence of the parameters obtained from clinical, electrocardiographical, Holter monitoring, chest X-Ray, and serum concentration of both sodium (Na) and potassium (K) have been analyzed. Also the survival analysis has been performed for patients treated: according standard procedures, with addition of beta-adrenolytic drug, with addition of amiodaron, with addition of combination of both beta-adrenolytic drug and amiodaron. During the observation 64 patients have died (60%), 4 patients have had heart transplantation (Htx) performed (4%) and 38 patients survived without necessity of Htx (36%). Among investigated parameters there were following ones which proved their statistical significance in terms of prognosis evaluation: ejection fraction, features of pulmonary haemostasis, HR (heart rate), SBP (systolic blood pressure), serum concentration of both sodium (Na) and potassium (K). Much better therapy effects as well as longer survival have concerned patients with hypertension disease confirmed during the anamnesis. Comparison of the survival curves referring to the patients treated according to different schemes a positive trend in the direction of survival improvement has been observed. This trend however appeared in the group treated additionally with beta-blocker and only in the outpatient follow-up. On the other hand a combination of both beta-blocker and amiodaron has been connected with improved both early and outpatient follow-up survival. The survival curves for patients treated with amiodaron only has been quite similar as in the case of patients treated according standard procedures. Addition of beta-adrenolytic drug or amiodaron or eventually both of these medicines has a significant influence into decrease of repeated hospitalizations in the group under investigation.", 
    "15": "Duodenal infusion of hypertonic solutions elicits osmolality-dependent thermogenesis in urethane-anaesthetized rats. Here we investigated the involvement of the autonomic nervous system, adrenal medulla and brain in the mechanism of this thermogenesis. Bilateral subdiaphragmatic vagotomy greatly attenuated the first hour, but not the later phase, of the thermogenesis induced by 3.6 % NaCl (10 ml kg(-1)). Neither atropine pretreatment (10 mg kg(-1), I.P.) nor capsaicin desensitization had any effect on the osmotically induced thermogenesis, suggesting the involvement of non-nociceptive vagal afferents. Bilateral splanchnic denervation caudal to the suprarenal ganglia also had no effect, suggesting a lack of involvement of spinal afferents and sympathetic efferents to the major upper abdominal organs. Adrenal demedullation greatly attenuated the initial phase, but not the later phase, of thermogenesis. Pretreatment with the beta-blocker propranolol (20 mg kg(-1), I.P.) attenuated the thermogenesis throughout the 3 h observation period. The plasma adrenaline concentration increased significantly 20 min after osmotic stimulation but returned to the basal level after 60 min. The plasma noradrenaline concentration increased 20 min after osmotic stimulation and remained significantly elevated for 120 min. Therefore, adrenaline largely mediated the initial phase of thermogenesis, and noradrenaline was involved in the entire thermogenic response. Moreover, neither decerebration nor pretreatment with the antipyretic indomethacin (10 mg kg(-1), S.C.) had any effect. Accordingly, this thermogenesis did not require the forebrain and was different from that associated with fever. These results show the critical involvement of the vagal afferents, hindbrain and sympathoadrenal system in the thermogenesis induced by osmotic stimulation of the intestines.",

    "19": "In addition to the matching parameters, there were no significant differences in peak coronary blood flow (CBF) response to intracoronary adenosine or in the peak CBF response to ACh before L-arginine infusion. However, absolute percentile improvement in CBF response to ACh infusion after L-arginine, as compared with before, was significantly greater among African Americans as a group (45 +/- 10% vs. 4 +/- 6%, p = 0.0016) and after partitioning by gender. The mechanism of this increase was mediated through further reduction in coronary microvascular resistance. L-arginine infusion also resulted in greater epicardial dilator response after ACh among African Americans.", 
    "20": "We conclude that intracoronary infusion of L-arginine provides significantly greater augmentation of endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation in those of African American ethnicity when compared with matched white subjects drawn from a cohort electively referred for coronary angiography. Our findings suggest that there are target populations in which supplementary L-arginine may be of therapeutic benefit in the amelioration of microvascular endothelial dysfunction. In view of the excess prevalence of cardiomyopathy among African Americans, pharmacologic correction of microcirculatory endothelial dysfunction in this group is an important area of further investigation and may ultimately prove to be clinically indicated.",

The ratio of F(D)(jj) at sqrt[s] = 630 GeV to F(D)(jj) obtained from a similar measurement at sqrt[s] = 1800 GeV is compared with expectations from QCD factorization and other theoretical predictions. We also report a measurement of the xi ( x-Pomeron) and beta ( x of parton in Pomeron) dependence of F(D)(jj) at sqrt[s] = 1800 GeV. In the region 0.035<xi<0.095, /t/<1 GeV2, and beta<0.5, F(D)(jj)(beta,xi) is found to be of the form beta(-1.0+/-0.1)xi(-0.9+/-0.1), which obeys beta-xi factorization.", 
    "22": "Autoimmune myocardial injuries are involved in the pathogenesis of myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy, but effective strategies for treating myocardial inflammation have not yet been established. The present study investigated the effects of suramin, a growth factor blocker, on experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) in rats. Lewis rats were immunized with cardiac myosin and placed into one of 4 groups: every 72 h for 1 month the control group (C) was subcutaneously injected with saline; group L received 4mg/kg of suramin; group M, 10 mg/kg: group H, 40 mg/kg. The heart weight/body weight ratios of the M and H groups were significantly lower than that of the C group. Macroscopic and microscopic scores for myocarditis were reduced in the M and H groups. The expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta mRNA in the heart was significantly decreased in the M and H groups compared with the C. In the next experiment, we investigated the effects of suramin on the cytokine milieu in EAM. The serum level of interleukin-10 on day 15 was significantly increased by suramin treatment. Furthermore, suramin increased the number of T cells with Th2 function in the popliteal lymph nodes. Suramin suppressed myocardial inflammation in EAM and was associated with modulation of the Th1/Th2 cytokine milieu and reduced TGF-beta1 expression in the heart.", 
    "23": "The Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial has shown that treatment with flecainide is associated with an increased incidence of cardiac death in patients following myocardial infarction. It is believed that there is a complex mechanism involving an interaction between flecainide, sympathetic activation, and acute ischemia that is responsible for the increased risk of sudden death. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of flecainide on muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) in humans. We measured MSNA using microneurography and cardiac output using the dye dilution method in 30 healthy individuals. Measurements were made at rest and after the oral administration of flecainide (200mg, n=12) or placebo (n=9), or intravenous administration of propranolol (0.2 mg/kg, n=9). Flecainide significantly increased heart rate and decreased the cardiac index (both p<0.01). Flecainide increased the burst rate from 16.7 +/- 3.5 to 23.3 +/- 4.1 bursts/min and the burst incidence from 26.6 +/- 5.1 to 34.7 +/ -5.6bursts/100 heartbeats (both p<0.01). For all of the hemodynamic parameters except heart rate, the effects of propranolol were similar to those of flecainide. Propranolol also increased the burst rate by 52 +/- 34% and the burst incidence by 106 +/- 39%. These results suggest that flecainide suppresses myocardial contractility and produces reflex-mediated increases in sympathetic nerve firing in humans.",

These actions of UK42620 were similar to those of tyramine and were blocked by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (0.3 microM) and by the neuronal uptake blocker desipramine (1 microM). 4. In the presence of desipramine, UK42620 but not tyramine produced a decrease in the stimulation-induced efflux of radioactivity that was antagonized by idazoxan. 5.

    "32": "Over 50 allelic variants of cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) encoding fully functional, reduced-activity, or nonfunctional proteins have been described. Compared with Caucasians, studies in black populations demonstrate a tendency toward slower CYP2D6 activity, attributed in part to the presence of a variant allele associated with reduced activity, the CYP2D6*17 allele. To investigate the kinetic characteristics of this variant protein, expression constructs coding for CYP2D6.1, CYP2D6.2, and CYP2D6.17 gene products were prepared and transfected into mammalian COS-7 and insect (Trichoplusia ni) cells for expression. Microsomal fractions containing the expressed proteins were used to determine the kinetic parameters K(m), V(max), and intrinsic clearance (Cl(int)) for the model substrates dextromethorphan, bufuralol, and debrisoquine. Relative to the wild-type CYP2D6.1 protein expressed in COS-7 cells, CYP2D6.17 exhibited a 2-fold higher K(m) and a 50% reduction in V(max) using dextromethorphan as the substrate. In contrast, no appreciable change in bufuralol K(m) was observed with CYP2D6.17 whereas V(max) was decreased by 50%. When expressed in the baculovirus expression system, CYP2D6.17 exhibited a 6-fold increase in K(m) but no change in V(max) with dextromethorphan as the substrate, a 2-fold higher K(m) and 50% reduction in V(max) with bufuralol, and a 3-fold increase in K(m) and no change in V(max) with debrisoquine relative to CYP2D6.1. These data indicate that CYP2D6.17 exhibits reduced metabolic activity toward all three commonly used CYP2D6 substrates, although specific effects on substrate affinity and turnover demonstrate some substrate dependence.",

Such is the case with beta-blockers, some of which have long been prescribed in heart failure before having made the definite proof of their efficacy, provided they are used carefully regarding the Good Product Use. On the other hand, the development of mibefradil, a calcic antagonist prescribed in the treatment of hypertension and angina pectoris, was stopped abruptly a few weeks before its launching because of the occurrence of serious side effects in patients suffering from heart failure. These examples, which are taken amongst others, clearly show the difficulties encountered by pharmaceutical companies that are concerned in putting forward innovative, efficacious, and ... secure drugs.", 
    "35": "We have examined the functional significance of the naturally occurring mutation at position 64 of human beta3-adrenergic receptor (beta3AR), which changes the amino acid from tryptophan to arginine (W64R-beta3AR). The affinities of betaAR agonists for W64R-beta3AR expressed in COS-7 cells were not significantly different from those for wild type beta3AR. When two receptors are expressed at various expression levels, and stimulated with CGP12177A, they showed essentially the same EC50 values and maximal responses. Overexpression of Gi and Go, or the treatment with pertussis toxin did not affect the agonist-induced cAMP response, suggesting that Gi and Go did not contribute to the beta3AR-induced cAMP response. However, the enhanced cAMP response was observed when W64R-beta3AR was coexpressed with the adenylyl cyclase type III isoform, and stimulated by CGP12177A and isoproterenol. These results indicate that the cAMP response of W64R-beta3AR can be enhanced under the particular condition that adenylyl cyclase type III was coexpressed.", 
    "36": "Cardiac effects of 10 kinds of clinically available Kampo medicines were investigated: Kakkon-to (TJ-1), Dai-saiko-to (TJ-8), Boi-ogi-to (TJ-20), Chorei-to (TJ-40), Rokumi-gan (TJ-87), Tsu-do-san (TJ-105), Gosha-jinki-gan (TJ-107), San'o-shashin-to (TJ-113), Sairei-to (TJ-114) and Inchin-gorei-san (TJ-117). Chronotropic and inotropic effects were studied using canine isolated, blood-perfused heart preparations, while subcellular mechanisms were analyzed by measuring the drug-induced changes of the adenylate cyclase activity in the canine ventricular membrane preparation. Intracoronary injections of TJ-1, TJ-20, TJ-105 and TJ-113 increased the sinoatrial rate and developed tension of papillary muscle in a dose-related manner, which was significantly attenuated by the pretreatment of the preparations with beta-blocker propranolol. Meanwhile, the other extracts hardly affected these parameters. TJ-1, TJ-20 and TJ-113 increased the adenylate cyclase activity in a dose-related manner, but their potency was significantly less compared with that by an equivalent concentration of isoproterenol. Moreover, TJ-105 did not increase the adenylate cyclase activity. These results suggest that the positive chronotropic and inotropic effects of TJ-1, TJ-20, TJ- 105 and TJ-113 may be exerted through the direct stimulation of the beta-adrenoceptor and/or the norepinephrine release from the postganglionic nerve terminals in the heart.",

They were premedicated with two oral doses of propranolol 1 mg.kg(-1). The anaesthetic consisted of infusions of remifentanil, propofol and vecuronium. On insertion of the first skin clip at the end of surgery, 5 ml of either saline or 2% lidocaine was injected into the appropriate lumen of the tracheal tube.

Against the background of intake of metoprolol, there occurs a rise in indices for variability of the heart's rhythm. Augmentation of total power of the spectrum due to metoprolol occurs largely because of enhancement of the parasympathetic activity which can be regarded as a positive effect on the sympathicopara-sympathetical control. In apparent enhancement of the parasympathetic nervous system against the background of ingestion of metoprolol the activity of the sympathetic component is not inhibited, the drug leading to redistribution of influences toward that portion of the autonomic nervous system which had been more inhibited before the intake of the drug.",

It has been found out that the drug, while augmenting the synthesis of nitrogen oxide, improves antioxidant properties. Therefore, it can be recommended for use in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus concurrent with arterial hypertension to achieve normalization of arterial pressure and accomplish a correction of endothelial dysfunction.", 
    "44": "The pharmacotherapy of heart failure has become complex. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (or angiotensin II receptor blockers), beta-blockers, spironolactone, diuretics and digoxin can be prescribed concurrently. Endothelin antagonists and combined inhibitors of converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase are under investigation. Optimal dosing will become increasingly difficult to judge. Plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) indicates the severity of left ventricular dysfunction. The C-terminal bioactive peptide and N-terminal BNP (N-BNP) circulate at concentrations related to cardiac status. We proposed that plasma levels of N-BNP would provide an index to guide drug treatment in established heart failure. Sixty-nine patients were randomized to treatment adjusted according to clinical criteria or plasma N-BNP. Hormone-guided therapy resulted in fewer clinical end points than did clinical management. This encourages further exploration of hormone guidance of anti-heart failure therapy, which could be extended to patients with preserved ejection fraction, in addition to those with established systolic dysfunction.", 
    "45": "During cardiac catheterization, a 2(1/2)-year-old boy developed sudden cardiac arrest. The presence of a long QT interval in the electrocardiogram (ECG) along with ventricular arrhythmia and syncope at that moment enabled us to diagnose long QT syndrome (LQTS). Immediate defibrillation and beta-blocker (metoprolol) therapy saved the life of the child. Cardiac catheterization was completed and the child was planned for Fontan operation. Beta-blocker coverage, prevention of sympathetic stimulation and avoidance of agents which prolong the QT interval made anesthesia uneventful. There were episodes of ventricular fibrillation (VF) in the postoperative period. The child was managed with electrical defibrillation, metoprolol and magnesium.",

    "47": "We examined 8 pigs by using tissue Doppler imaging of the RV free wall and simultaneous measurements of intraventricular pressure, volume, maximal elastance (e(max)), preload recruitable stroke work, and dP/dt(max) by conductance catheterization. Animals were paced in the right atrium at a rate of 130 beats per minute (bpm). IVA was compared with elastance during contractility modulation by esmolol and dobutamine and during preload reduction and afterload increase by transient balloon occlusion of the inferior vena cava and pulmonary artery, respectively. Data were also obtained during incremental atrial pacing from 110 to 210 bpm. Esmolol led to a decrease in IVA and dP/dt(max). During dobutamine infusion, IVA, dP/dt(max), preload recruitable stroke work, and e(max) all increased significantly. During preload reduction and afterload increase, IVA remained constant up to a reduction of RV volume by 54% and an RV systolic pressure increase of 58%. Pacing up to a rate of 190 bpm led to a stepwise increase in IVA and dP/dt(max), with a subsequent fall at a pacing rate of 210 bpm.",

If, in addition, blood pressure is reduced as a result of antihypertensive medication, compensatory mechanisms may be inadequate and orthostatic problems may occur. This may be less true in patients on beta-blockers. beta-blockers cause pressor effects in standing patients with autonomic neuropathy, but their effects on standing pulse pressures in elderly subjects with mild hypertension have not been systematically studied.", 
    "50": "We studied 3741 patients with mild hypertension for 6 months who were being treated with the beta-blocker nebivolol 5 mg daily. Blood pressures were measured after 10 minutes in the supine position and after 1 minute in the standing position. Overall, systolic and diastolic blood pressures rose slightly while standing, whereas pulse pressures remained unchanged. When previously untreated patients (n=2085) >60 and <60 years of age were assessed separately, supine pulse pressures were consistently higher in the elderly group compared with those of the younger subjects by 6 to 11 mm Hg (P<0.001 to 0.0001). However, while standing, pulse pressures rose in the younger subjects, whereas they tended to fall in the elderly group. After 6 months of beta-blockade, this pattern was unchanged in the younger subjects but reversed into significant rise of pulse pressures in the elderly group by 4 (SD 1) mm Hg (P<0.001). In the patients previously treated with other classes of antihypertensive drugs (n=712), the effects were essentially the same.",

    "52": "We find that the adrenergic agonist isoproterenol increases intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) in cultured rat brown adipocytes. At the concentration used (10 microM), isoproterenol-induced Ca(2+) responses were sensitive to block by either alpha(1)- or beta-adrenergic antagonists, suggesting an interaction between these receptor subtypes. Despite reliance on beta-adrenoceptor activation, the Ca(2+) response was not due solely to increases in cAMP because, administered alone, the selective beta(3)-adrenergic agonist BRL-37344 or forskolin did not increase [Ca(2+)](i). However, increased cAMP elicited vigorous [Ca(2+)](i) increases in the presence of barely active concentrations of the alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine or the P2Y receptor agonist UTP. Consistent with isoproterenol recruiting only inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3))-sensitive Ca(2+) stores, endoplasmic reticulum store depletion by thapsigargin blocked isoproterenol-induced Ca(2+) increases, but removal of external Ca(2+) did not. These results argue that increases in cAMP sensitize the IP(3)-mediated Ca(2+) release system in brown adipocytes.",

The mean aortic crossclamp time for patients with AF was 67 min compared with 60.3 min for patients without AF (P < 0.05). The mean duration of cardiopulmonary bypass for patients with AF was 109.6 min compared with 97.3 min for patients without AF (P < 0.05). The mean duration of mechanical ventilation for patients with AF was 19.1 h compared with 15.7 h for patients without AF (P < 0.05).

    "57": "The controlled release of two drugs, i.e. the sodium salt of diclofenac and propranolol was studied, by using low molecular weight D,L-Poly(lactic acid) as a matrix. Tablets of the above polymer containing those drugs were immersed into buffers with various pH values and delivery was recorded as a function of time, via UV-spectroscopy. The results showed that the polymer is appropriate for such biomedical applications, as generally, it ensures complete drug delivery within 45-60 days, which is acceptable for most cases. On the other hand, the release rate depends on many parameters including the interactions among drug, matrix and the surrounding liquid, which adds complexity to the process and requires careful investigation for proper design of a controlled release system.",

The daily dose of carvedilol was 10 mg to 40 mg, and that of atenolol was 50 mg to 100 mg. Both drugs were given once daily. Out of 30 cases of Cv group, carvedilol showed significant efficiency in 20 cases, and was effective in 6 cases. The total therapeutic efficiency was 86.2% (26/30). In the double blind groups(25 patients in each group), those treated with carvedilol(Group A) had 21 effective cases(84.0%) while those treated with atenolol(Group B) had 18 effective cases(72.0%). A lower incidence of adverse effects was observed in carvedilol group. Dizziness occurred similarly in both drugs, but it lasted only a short time and could be tolerated. The recommended dose of 10-30 mg once daily would be appropriate. After treatment there was a significant reduction in blood pressure in both groups(P < 0.01). It suggests that native carvedilol is a safe and effective anti-hypertensive agent.", 
    "60": "The effects of nipradilol, a drug used in the treatment of glaucoma, on the contractions induced by noradrenaline and phenylephrine in isolated dog central retinal, external and internal ophthalmic arteries and pig ciliary arteries were investigated. In dog ocular arteries treated with oxyhemoglobin (1.6 x 10(-5) mol/l) to adsorb nitric oxide, noradrenaline (2 x 10(-8) to 10(-5) mol/l) produced a concentration-related contraction which was markedly inhibited by prazosin but not by yohimbine. Nipradilol (10(-9) to 10(-7) mol/l) slightly but significantly inhibited the noradrenaline-induced contraction in a concentration-related manner, but the inhibitory potency and efficacy were much less than those of prazosin. However, nipradilol inhibited the phenylephrine-induced contraction with a similar PA(2) value of prazosin. In pig ciliary arteries treated with oxyhemoglobin, noradrenaline-induced contraction was slightly inhibited by prazosin but markedly inhibited by yohimbine. Nipradilol, similarly to timolol, did not inhibit, but rather tended to potentiate, the contraction elicited by noradrenaline. The contraction induced by phenylephrine was significantly inhibited by prazosin and nipradilol. It is concluded that nipradilol acts as an alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist (but not as an alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist) in the ocular arteries, which may partially explain its ocular-pressure-lowering mechanism. Taken together with the results of our previous studies, the potencies of the nipradilol-induced vascular actions in ocular arteries are found to be in the following order: beta-adrenoceptor inhibition > alpha(1)-adrenoceptor inhibition falling dots direct vasodilation via a release of nitric oxide.",

Because TG depolarized the plasma membrane in the presence of glucose alone, extracellular K(+) was alternated between 10 and 30 mM in the presence of diazoxide to impose membrane potential (MP) oscillations. In control islets, pulses of K(+), mimicking regular MP oscillations elicited by 10 mM glucose, induced [Ca(2+)](c) oscillations whose nadir remained higher than basal [Ca(2+)](c). Increasing the depolarization phase of the pulses while keeping their frequency constant (to mimic the effects of a further rise of the glucose concentration on MP) caused an upward shift of the nadir of [Ca(2+)](c) oscillations that was reproduced by raising extracellular Ca(2+) (to increase Ca(2+) influx) without changing the pulse protocol. In TG-pretreated islets, the imposed [Ca(2+)](c) oscillations were of much larger amplitude than in control islets and occurred on basal levels. During intermittent trains of depolarizations, control islets displayed mixed [Ca(2+)](c) oscillations characterized by a summation of fast oscillations on top of slow ones, whereas no progressive summation of the fast oscillations was observed in TG-pretreated islets. In conclusion, the buffering capacity of the ER in pancreatic beta-cells limits the amplitude of [Ca(2+)](c) oscillations and may explain how the nadir between oscillations remains above baseline during regular oscillations or gradually increases during mixed [Ca(2+)](c) oscillations, two types of response observed during glucose stimulation.", 
    "77": "Molecular imprinted polymers (MIPs) of S-timolol were prepared as chiral stationary phases (CSPs) in thin layer chromatography (TLC). The resolution of the enantiomers of some cardiovascular drugs, including propranolol, atenolol, timolol, nadolol, nifedipine and verapamil were investigated on these CSPs. A mobile phase system of either methanol or acetonitrile was used and the effects of acetic acid content of the mobile phases were also investigated. The best resolution was achieved for enantioseparation of propranolol, timolol and atenolol on plates based on MIP of (-)-S-timolol using methacrylic acid as functional monomer (alpha = 1.52, 1.6, 1.59) respectively, using acetonitrile containing 5% acetic acid and (alpha = 1.47, 1.52, 1.5) in methanol containing 1% acetic acid as mobile phases. The results obtained show that TLC based on MIPs could be applied in the direct separation of several beta-adrenergic drugs. As the side chains on beta-blockers are similar, it is possible that this method could also be used for the resolution of other racemates in this family of drugs. Racemic drugs structurally related to print molecule, were completely resolved into two spots with the MIP plates. In general the retention of (+)-R-isomers was greater than that of (-)-S-isomers, indicating lower stereoselectivity of the MIPs to the dextrorotatory isomers.

    "84": "T(3) has been shown to exert cardiovascular effects. These effects have not yet been defined with regard to the mode of action (nongenomic vs. genomic) and with regard to an interaction with the adrenergic system in humans. To address these issues we conducted a randomized, double blind, 6-fold cross-over trial in 18 healthy male volunteers. After pretreatment with the beta-agonist dobutamine, the beta-blocking agent esmolol, or placebo (0.9% NaCl), 100 microg T(3) or placebo were injected. Primary target variables were systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and cardiac output (CO) within 45 min after injection of T(3) vs. placebo after placebo pretreatment. Sympatho-vagal balance was assessed by measurement of heart rate variability. T(3) caused a lower SVR and a higher CO than placebo (P < 0.001) after pretreatment with placebo. An increased low frequency (LF)/high frequency (HF) ratio (power in LF/power in HF band) after T(3) compared with placebo (P = 0.004) suggests an increase in sympathetic tone. After pretreatment with dobutamine, the effects of T(3) on SVR and CO were abolished, and the effect on LF/HF ratio was reversed. After pretreatment with esmolol, the effects on SVR and LF/HF ratio were reversed. Our data show, for the first time, nongenomic cardiovascular effects of T(3) in humans.",

    "86": "It has been previously described that daily intraplantar (i.pl.) injections of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and dopamine in rats for 14 days cause the development of a persistent mechanical nociceptor hypersensitivity state lasting more than 30 days. Considering that during inflammation, the release of these hyperalgesic agents are mediated by cytokines, we investigated in the present study whether interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-8 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) are able to induce persistent mechanical nociceptor hypersensitivity. Daily i.pl. administration of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta or IL-8 for 18 days led to persistent mechanical nociceptor hypersensitivity, which lasted at least 30 days after the cessation of treatment. The co-treatment of the animals with IL-1beta plus indomethacin, but not with atenolol, prevented the induction of persistent mechanical nociceptor hypersensitivity. The co-treatment of the animals with IL-8 plus atenolol, but not with indomethacin, prevented the induction of persistent mechanical nociceptor hypersensitivity. The daily co-treatment of TNF-alpha with either indomethacin or atenolol partially inhibited (+/-50%) the induction of persistent mechanical nociceptor hypersensitivity. However, the combined treatment with indomethacin plus atenolol abolished the induction of the persistent mechanical nociceptive hypersensitivity by TNF-alpha.A single injection of cytokines in the contralateral paws of the animals with persistent hypersensitivity caused only an acute nociceptive response. This observation, together with the demonstration of undetectable levels of immunoglobulins against TNF-alpha, IL-1beta or IL-8 in the sera of animals after the development of the persistent hypersensitivity induced by those cytokines, indicate that this event is not due to an ongoing immunological response against the cytokines. In conclusion, our results support the suggestion that IL-1beta- and IL-8-induced persistent mechanical nociceptor hypersensitivity results from the endogenous release of eicosanoids and sympathetic amines, respectively. However, TNF-alpha-induced mechanical nociceptor hypersensitivity results from the concomitant endogenous release of eicosanoids and sympathomimetic mediators.", 
    "87": "Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) can be released in large amounts from (damaged) cells, leading to locally high concentrations. In this study, we investigated the effect of such high concentrations of ATP on neuroblastoma cells. ATP (>or=30 microM) induced apoptosis in the mouse neuroblastoma cell line N1E-115. Activation of the ATP receptor P2X(7) is one of the routes via which ATP has been shown to induce apoptosis. Although the P2X(7) receptor was present in N1E-115 cells, both at the protein and mRNA level, studies with the P2X(7) receptor agonist benzoyl-benzoyl ATP showed that this receptor was not involved in ATP-induced apoptosis. It has been shown previously that adenosine induces apoptosis in N1E-115 cells after transport inside the cell. In this study, both dipyridamole, a nucleoside transport protein blocker, and uridine, a substrate for this transporter, were able to block ATP-induced apoptosis. This indicated that ATP had to be broken down to adenosine to induce apoptosis. The ecto-nucleotidase inhibitors 6-N,N-diethyl-beta-dibromomethylene-D-adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ARL67156) and alpha,beta-methylene adenosine 5'-diphosphate (AOPCP) commonly used to slow breakdown of ATP did not inhibit ATP breakdown appreciably, while the ATP antagonist PPADS inhibited the breakdown of AMP to adenosine; PPADS was also the only compound capable of inhibiting ATP-induced apoptosis. We conclude that the main route of ATP-induced apoptosis in N1E-115 cells was via breakdown to adenosine.",

In order to develop am improved synthesis of [11C]phosgene, two oxidizing agents, Fe2O3 and CuO, were examined. The yield of [11C]phosgene was significantly increased using Fe2O3 powder mixed with Fe granules, while the use of CuO alone, or CuO powder mixed with Fe granules resulted in an insignificant yield. The yield and specific activity of S- (-) [11C]CGP-12177 synthesized using Fe2O3 powder mixed with Fe granules were markedly higher than those synthesized by the previous methods using Fe granules alone or Fe granules mixed with Fe powder.

The pathogenesis of this condition is not completely understood and there is debate regarding the extent of the contribution of autoimmunity and external agents, such as infections, to this process. We present the first reported case of subacute thyroiditis in a patient who had been on chronic lithium therapy as well as long-term immunosuppression, with cyclosporin and prednisolone, following an allogeneic bone marrow transplant. We speculate that this case suggests a minimal role of autoimmunity in the development of subacute thyroiditis.",

    "95": "Encapsulation of the filtering bleb occurs as a complication of glaucoma filtering surgery in 8.3-28% of all eyes filtered, often between 2-4 weeks after surgery. It has a characteristic clinical appearance--highly elevated localized bleb, prominent surface vessels and patent sclerostomies on gonioscopy. This study retrospectively reviewed the results of 100 filtering operations, performed in the Prof. Dr. I. Stankovitsh Eye Department, focused on the incidence, possible risk factors and management of encapsulated filtering blebs. Trabeculectomy was done in all patients with limbus-based conjunctival flap, rectangular scleral flap 4 x 4 mm, and sclerostomy 2 x 2 mm. Two or three interrupted 10-0 nylon sutures were used to tether the flap, the conjunctiva with Tenon's capsule was closed with a running suture. All eyes received topical dexamethasone drops, mydriatics-homatropin or tropicamide and antibiotic ointment for three weeks. Possible risk factors were considered: sex, age, other eye or systemic disease, type of glaucoma, previous ocular procedure and antiglaucoma medical therapy, early postoperative complications, postoperative and final intraocular pressure (IOP). All eycs with encapsulated filtering bleb were given topical beta-blocker initially and carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, and if IOP continued to be uncontrolled incisional surgical management was performed. Success was defined as IOP maintained at less than 22 mmHg, with or without medication. An encapsulated filtering bleb developed in 9% of eyes. Previous argon laser trabeculoplasty was associated with an increased frequency of bleb encapsulation. The mean postoperative IOP was 11.30 +/- 1.90. Encapsulation of filtering bleb was developing at mean time of 19.9 +/- 3.0 after surgery. Six eyes returned to IOP below 21 (mean IOP was 20.17 +/- 0.90) within 4 weeks, and 4 of them continued on a topical beta-blocker. Four eyes required incisional surgery. A week after surgery mean IOP was 18 mmHg. Haemophthalmus occurred after one incision performed in a patient suffering from diabetes mellitus. Late scarring of the filtering bleb was developed in 2 eyes. Seven months and 2 years after filtration surgery mean IOP was 21.30 +/- 4.00 mmHg. The cause of bleb encapsulation is not known. Male patients, surgical glove powder, topical corticosteroids, previous argon laser trabeculoplasty and beta-blockers are some of potential risk factors for the development of encapsulated filtering bleb. This study suggests the association between development of encapsulated bleb and previous argon laser trabeculoplasty--40% in the eyes with encapsulation and 18% in the eyes without encapsulation. The optimal management of bleb encapsulation has not been defined. In this study topical antiglaucoma therapy achieved IOP control and cyst's remodeling in 60% of cases. Forty percent of all cysts required incisional surgical management. Encapsulation of the filtering bleb is not an uncommon complication of glaucoma filtration surgery. It is important to examine postoperative eyes frequently during the first 2 months to detect this complication. Fortunately, most eyes have their IOPs controlled with antiglaucoma therapy.",

Three groups of rats (Wistar) were treated for 18 days with single oral daily doses of 45 mg consuprene/kg body weight to induce cyclosporine nephropathy. Two treated groups were further medicated either with carvedilol or BL-443 in single daily doses of 10 mg/kg b.w., unmedicated rats were given single i.p. daily doses of 1 ml saline. No significant difference in the LD(1-4) isoenzyme pattern in the liver between intact rats, rats with cyclosporine nephropathy, and rats with cyclosporine nephropathy medicated with carvedilol or BL-443 was found by F-test and t-test (p < 0.05). However, a significant difference in the LD(1-4) isoenzyme pattern in the myocardium between rats with cyclosporine nephropathy and intact rats was found.

We performed a post hoc analysis to evaluate the effect of metoprolol CR/XL on outcome in women (n=898), including the outcome in 183 women with severe heart failure (New York Heart Association class III/IV and LVEF < 0.25). Treatment with metoprolol CR/XL in women resulted in a 21% reduction in the primary combined end point of all-cause mortality/all-cause hospitalizations (164 versus 137 patients; P=0.044). The number of cardiovascular hospitalizations was reduced by 29% (164 versus 120; P=0.013), and hospitalization for worsening heart failure was reduced by 42% (95 versus 56; P=0.021). Similar results were noted in the subgroup of women with severe heart failure, with a 57% reduction in cardiovascular hospitalizations (63 versus 30; P=0.005) and a 72% reduction in hospitalization due to worsening heart failure (46 versus 14; P=0.0004).

    "101": "The interaction between extracellular catecholamines and catecholamine secretion from chromaffin cells was assessed in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) using an in situ saline-perfused posterior cardinal vein preparation. This was accomplished by comparing the effects of adrenergic receptor agonists and antagonists on stimulus-evoked secretion. An acute bolus injection or extended perfusion with saline containing high levels of either noradrenaline or adrenaline did not affect the baseline secretion of catecholamines. However, catecholamine secretion in response to a bolus injection of the general cholinergic receptor agonist carbachol or electrical stimulation of the nerves innervating the chromaffin cells was abolished or reduced respectively, in preparations perfused with saline containing either catecholamine. To characterize the catecholaminergic inhibition of catecholamine release, secretion in response to carbachol and electrical stimulation was compared in preparations perfused with the adrenergic receptor agonists dobutamine (beta(1)), salbutamol (beta(2)), phenylephrine (alpha(1)) or clonidine (alpha(2)). Prior treatment with dobutamine or phenylephrine was without effect on baseline catecholamine secretion or stimulus-evoked secretion. In contrast, pre-treatment with salbutamol significantly inhibited catecholamine secretion in response to carbachol or electrical stimulation. Pre-treatment with clonidine did not affect carbachol-evoked secretion but did reduce catecholamine secretion during electrical stimulation. The significance of this adrenergic mechanism of regulating stimulus-evoked catecholamine secretion was further established using the adrenergic receptor antagonists nadolol (beta) or phentolamine (alpha). Catecholamine secretion in response to cholinergic stimulation was significantly enhanced in preparations perfused with saline containing nadolol. Furthermore, pre-treatment with phentolamine significantly enhanced adrenaline secretion in response to neuronal stimulation. These results suggest that the mechanisms of adrenergic inhibition of catecholamine secretion from trout chromaffin cells include activation of chromaffin cell membrane beta(2)-receptors and presynaptic alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors.",

    "103": "Nicotine and other nicotinic receptor agonists have been found in a variety of studies to improve memory, while nicotinic receptor blockade can impair memory. The critical neural mechanisms for nicotinic involvement with memory are still under investigation. Initial evidence supports the involvement of the ventral hippocampus. Lesions in this area block nicotine-induced memory improvement and mecamylamine-induced impairment. Local ventral hippocampal application of the nicotinic channel blocker mecamylamine impairs memory in the 8-arm radial maze. Both alpha 4 beta 2 and alpha 7 nicotinic receptors seem to be involved. Ventral hippocampal infusions of high doses of the alpha 4 beta 2 nicotinic antagonist dihydro-beta-erythrodine (DH beta E) and the alpha 7 nicotinic antagonist methyllycaconitine (MLA) impair memory performance on the 8-arm radial maze. However, high doses of these drugs may limit specificity and they cause preconvulsant effects, which in themselves may affect memory. The current study used the more challenging 16-arm radial maze to determine the effects of lower doses of these drugs on memory and to differentiate effects on working and reference memory. Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were trained on a working and reference memory task in the 16-arm radial maze and then were implanted with bilateral chronic guide cannulae directed to the ventral hippocampus. After recovery from surgery, the rats received acute intrahippocampal infusions of dose combinations of DH beta E and MLA. In the first study, DH beta E (0 and 6.75 microg/side) and MLA (0, 6.75, 13.5 and 27 microg/side) were administered in a counter-balanced order. In the second study, lower doses of DH beta E (0, 1.6375, 3.275 and 6.75 microg/side) were administered alone or with MLA (0 and 6.75 microg/side) in a counter-balanced order. In the first study, DH beta E caused a significant increase in both working and reference memory errors. MLA at a dose of 27 microg/side caused a significant increase in working memory errors, but this dose had no significant effect on reference memory errors. Interestingly, no additive effects were seen with combined administration of DH beta E and MLA in this study, and at the doses used, no effects were seen on response latency. In the second study, lower doses of DH beta E did not cause a significant deficit in working memory performance. Co-administration of MLA with these subthreshold doses did precipitate a memory impairment. The current results confirm the specificity of the memory deficits caused by these drugs. These results support the involvement of alpha 4 beta 2 and alpha 7 nicotinic receptors in the ventral hippocampus as being critical for memory function.", 
    "104": "The majority of patients with acute coronary syndromes are elderly subjects. They are at a high risk of events; in fact, they usually arrive to hospital late and this delay nullifies the advantages of reperfusion; they often present with a large and complicated acute myocardial infarction and the short-term mortality for such patients is 3-5 times higher than that observed for younger subjects. Although they are a high-risk population, paradoxically they receive thrombolytic therapy, beta-blocker drugs and acetyl salicylic acid less frequently than younger patients and they are rarely submitted to interventional procedures. In this overview, we analyze the reasons of this paradox and we suggest some management guidelines. The risk of bleeding associated with thrombolytic drugs is the main reason justifying the limited use of reperfusion therapy in elderly patients. The identification, in each patient, of the risk factors for bleeding permits stratification of such patients into different classes of risk. This may be of help to the physician in distinguishing those patients who are candidates for thrombolytic therapy from those who are not, reserving for the latter other therapeutic strategies such as primary coronary angioplasty. In elderly patients with unstable angina or myocardial infarction, a careful and early risk stratification should serve as a guide when establishing the indication for interventional procedures. The latter should be encouraged in those patients in whom the risk of bleeding is high and whose overall clinical picture does not contraindicate such a therapeutic strategy. In such cases, invasive therapy can really improve the patient's quality of life.", 
    "105": "Delayed-rectifier K(+) channels (K(DR)) are important regulators of membrane excitability in neurons and neuroendocrine cells. Opening of these voltage-dependent K(+) channels results in membrane repolarization, leading to the closure of the Ca(2+) channels and cessation of insulin secretion in neuroendocrine islet beta cells. Using patch clamp techniques, we have demonstrated that the activity of the K(DR) channel subtype, K(V)1.1, identified by its specific blocker dendrodotoxin-K, is inhibited by SNAP-25 in insulinoma HIT-T15 beta cells. A co-precipitation study of rat brain confirmed that SNAP-25 interacts with the K(V)1.1 protein. Cleavage of SNAP-25 by expression of botulinum neurotoxin A in HIT-T15 cells relieved this SNAP-25-mediated inhibition of K(DR). This inhibitory effect of SNAP-25 is mediated by the N terminus of K(V)1.1, likely by direct interactions with K(Valpha)1.1 and/or K(V)beta subunits, as revealed by co-immunoprecipitation performed in the Xenopus oocyte expression system and in vitro binding. Taken together we have concluded that SNAP-25 mediates secretion not only through its participation in the exocytotic SNARE complex but also by regulating membrane potential and calcium entry through its interaction with K(DR) channels.",

By using small polymer beads, we were able to place an organic scintillator and an \"antenna\" component in close proximity to the imprinted binding sites. When the radioactive template bound to the polymer, radiation energy was effectively transferred, via the antenna component, to the scintillator to generate a fluorescence signal. Using molecularly imprinted microspheres instead of antibodies, we have demonstrated competitive scintillation proximity assays for (S)-propranolol in both organic and aqueous solvents. The experimental results were further validated by normal ligand binding analysis, where liquid scintillation counting was used for quantification.",

Solvent-dependent differences in appearance were observed. All the molecularly imprinted polymer-based open-tubular capillary columns were able to separate the enantiomers of propranolol by means of electrochromatography. Electrochromatographic performance was found to be dependent on the type of solvent used during the synthesis.", 
    "108": "Studies have shown that the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in cardiac remodeling induced by hypertension. However, the role of this system on myocyte remodeling remains unclear. In the present study, we have assessed the effect of perindopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) as a means to evaluate the role of RAS in myocyte remodeling. We also investigated the effect of beta blockade on myocyte remodeling. We used female SHRs at 12 weeks of age. They were divided into four experimental groups: a control group, group C; low dose perindopril group (0.3 mg/kg/day, p.o.), group PL; high dose perindopril group (3 mg/kg/day, p.o.), group PH; and bisoprolol group (60 mg/kg/day, p.o.), group B. We isolated myocytes from these rats after 4 weeks. LV myocyte volume and cross-sectional area decreased in groups PL and PH compared to group C. LV myocyte length decreased in group PH compared to group C. However, there was no morphological change in LV myocytes in group B compared to group C. In summary, ACE inhibitors reversed cardiac hypertrophy mainly by a reduction in LV myocyte volume; however, beta blockade did not reverse myocyte remodeling. These results suggest that RAS plays an important role in myocyte remodeling in the hypertensive heart.",

    "111": "The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of nipradilol on the cardiac function and mRNA expression in Wistar rats with a myocardial infarction (MI) that was created by ligation of the anterior descending coronary. Ten mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) of nipradilol were administrated to the rats in random order, and hemodynamic and Doppler-echocardiographic findings and myocardial mRNA expression were analyzed at 4 weeks after MI. Although left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and central venous pressure (CVP) were increased in the MI rats, nipradilol significantly reduced the degree of the increase in both parameters. MI also significantly increased the weight of the left and right ventricles, and increased the left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVDd), effects that were attenuated by nipradilol. The MI rats showed decreased fractional shortening as systolic dysfunction and decreased E wave deceleration rate as diastolic dysfunction, and nipradilol significantly prevented these. Nipradilol significantly suppressed the increase in the non-infarcted myocardial mRNA expression of atrial natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide and collagen I and III. In conclusions, nipradilol prevents the cardiac remodeling that is accompanied by systolic and diastolic dysfunction, and inhibits abnormal myocardial gene expression after MI.",

Telemetric ECG signals were obtained from an ECG radio-transmitter placed in a dorsal subcutaneous pouch of male Kob and Wistar rats for 30min every 6h at a sample rate of 5kHz. Heart rate (HR) and HR variability (HRV) were analyzed in each group by power spectrograms obtained by a fast Fourier transform algorithm. RR interval, total power (TP), low frequency (LF) power (0.04-0.67 Hz), high frequency (HF) power (0.79-1.48 Hz) and LF/HF ratio were also measured. The Kob rats had lower HRV than the control Wistar rats; HR, TP, and HF power, but not the LF/HF ratio, in the Kob rats were significantly lower than those of the control rats (p<0.001). However, in the Kob rats the response of these parameters to a muscarinic antagonist (atropine: 2mg/kg) was left intact, but their response to a beta-adrenergic antagonist (propranolol: 4mg/kg) was impeded. Autonomic nervous control of HR in spontaneously diabetic rats was inhomogeneously deranged in terms of the balance in sympathetic and parasympathetic tone, not only in the baseline condition, but also in the regulatory systems, including postsynaptic receptor function.",

    "116": "After 1 year, heart rate was reduced in the bisoprolol fumarate group both at rest (81 +/- 12 before therapy versus 61 +/- 11 after therapy; P <.01) and peak exercise (144 +/- 20 before therapy versus 127 +/- 17 after therapy; P <.01), which indicated a reduction in sympathetic drive. No differences were observed in heart rate responses in the placebo group. No differences were observed within or between groups in peak oxygen uptake, although work rate achieved was higher (117.9 +/- 36 watts versus 146.1 +/- 33 watts; P <.05) and exercise time tended to be higher (9.1 +/- 1.7 minutes versus 11.4 +/- 2.8 minutes; P =.06) in the bisoprolol fumarate group. A trend for a reduction in left ventricular end-diastolic volume (-54 mL) and left ventricular end-systolic volume (-62 mL) in the bisoprolol fumarate group occurred after 1 year. Ejection fraction was higher in the bisoprolol fumarate group (25.0 +/- 7 versus 36.2 +/- 9%; P <.05), and the placebo group remained unchanged. Most changes in volume and ejection fraction occurred during the latter 6 months of treatment. With myocardial tagging, insignificant reductions in left ventricular rotation velocity were observed in both groups, whereas relaxation velocity was reduced only after bisoprolol fumarate therapy (by 39%; P <.05).", 
    "117": "One year of bisoprolol fumarate therapy resulted in an improvement in exercise capacity, showed trends for reductions in end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes, increased ejection fraction, and significantly reduced relaxation velocity. Although these results generally confirm the beneficial effects of beta-blockade in patients with chronic heart failure, they show differential effects on systolic and diastolic function.", 
    "118": "Heart failure is a major and increasing cause of death and disability and accounts for significant resource use. In the United States alone, the prevalence is 4.6 million, with an incidence rate of 550,000 new cases a year and approximately 957,000 hospitalizations a year.", 
    "119": "Methods of evaluating cost and outcome and of comparing cost with outcome are reviewed. Economic and cost-effectiveness studies in heart failure research, especially those related to clinical trials, are reviewed in the therapeutic areas of digoxin, angiotension-converting enzyme inhibition, beta blockers, disease management, and transplantation.", 
    "120": "In an era in which economic constraints on medical resource use limit the ability to give all services to all patients, economic studies can help guide more rational decision making. Economic studies in heart failure can be expected to improve and so help society to make better, more informed choices.", 
    "121": "Two on-line configurations using multiple 6- and 10-port valves were investigated for high-flow on-line extraction of a basic drug in rat plasma and human urine using a reversed-phase and a cation-exchange SPE sorbent. The first configuration studied was a single reversed-phase extraction cartridge (2.1 x 20 mm, 25 microm) using an optimized washing protocol. The results showed that up to 1.5 mL of sample (urine or plasma diluted 1:1) can be injected with limits of quantification (LOQs) as low as 100 pg/mL. The second configuration studied was the combination of a cation exchanger and a reversed-phase cartridge using at-column dilution. The results showed better LOQs than those obtained with the single cartridge at 10 pg/mL with the same injection volume. The mass spectrometer was operated in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. All calibration curves gave an average of 5% relative standard deviation (RSD).", 
    "122": "The role of an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-mediated transduction cascade in the response of taste receptor cells of the fleshfly Boettcherisca peregrina was investigated by using the following reagents: neomycin (an inhibitor of IP3 production), U73122 (an inhibitor of phospholipase C), adenophostin A (an agonist of the IP3-gated channel), IP3, ruthenium red (a blocker of the IP3-gated channel), and 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborate (2-APB; an antagonist of the IP3-gated channel). For introduction into the receptor cell, the reagents were mixed with a detergent, deoxycholate (DOC). After treatment with neomycin + DOC or U73122 + DOC, the response of the sugar receptor cell to sugars was depressed compared with responses after treatment with DOC alone. During the treatment of adenophostin A + DOC, the response of the sugar receptor cell was elicited. After treatment with IP3 + DOC, the response of the sugar receptor cell to sugars and to amino acids was apparently enhanced. When taste stimuli were administered in the presence of ruthenium red or 2-APB, the response of the sugar receptor cell to glucose were inhibited. The expression of genes for substances involved in the IP3 transduction cascade, such as G protein alpha subunit (dGqalpha), phospholipase C (norpA), and IP3 receptor (itpr), were examined in the taste receptor cell of the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster by using the pox-neuro70 mutant (poxn70), which lacks taste receptor cells. The expressed levels of dGqalpha and itpr in the tarsus of poxn70 mutant flies were reduced compared with those of wild-type flies. These results suggest that the IP3 transduction cascade is involved in the response of the sugar receptor cell of the fly.", 
    "123": "The authors considered a group of patients with newly diagnosed primary open-angle glaucoma studying the effects of a 4-week treatment with timolol or dorzolamide on retrobulbar vessels. Ocular hemodynamics were assessed by means of color Doppler imaging of the ophthalmic artery, the temporal short posterior ciliary arteries (SPCAs) and the central retinal artery. For each vessel, systolic and diastolic blood flow velocities were measured, and the resistivity index (RI) was calculated. The only significant result was a reduction of temporal SPCA RI after dorzolamide treatment in comparison with baseline (p = 0.011). In the same group, dorzolamide treatment had a slight and nonsignificant increase in temporal SPCA diastolic velocity. The resistance decrease observed after dorzolamide treatment in the ciliary circulation may be due to the decrease in intraocular pressure or a possible direct vasodilating effect of the drug.", 
    "124": "The beta-adrenergic receptor ligand (S)-4-(3-(2'-[18F]-fluoroethylamino)-2-hydroxypropoxy)-carbazol ((S)-[18F]-fluoroethylcarazolol) was prepared by reaction of [18F]-fluoroethylamine with the corresponding (S)-epoxide and was evaluated in rats by studying its pharmacokinetics and its binding profile both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, (S)-fluoroethylcarazolol binds preferentially to beta-adrenoceptors (pK(i)=9.3 for beta(1) and 9.4 for beta(2)) and has less affinity to 5HT(1A) and 5HT(1D) receptors (pK(i)=6.7 and 5.2). In vivo, standard uptake values (SUVs) up to 0.63+/-0.07 in cortical regions were found after 60 min. Metabolites (90%) appeared within 10 min in plasma, whereas, in brain 70-75% parent compound was found after 60 min. Clearance from plasma occurred within 5 min. Cerebral uptake could be blocked by 'cold' fluoroethylcarazolol in every region, except medulla. Uptake was also blocked by propranolol and pindolol, but not by WAY 100635. ICI 89406 hardly lowered [18F] levels in brain. ICI 118551 reduced uptake of [18F] in cerebellum (mainly beta(2)) by 30%. Specific binding (tissue minus medulla values) in various brain regions corresponded with those observed for [18F]-fluorocarazolol (r(2)=0.95) and with in vitro beta-adrenoceptor densities (r(2)=0.76). Autoradiography using phosphor images of (S)-[18F]-fluoroethylcarazolol in rat brain showed the characteristic binding pattern of beta-antagonists, while propranolol treatment resulted in low and homogenous uptake. Regional tissue minus medulla values corresponded with in vitro beta-adrenoceptor densities (r(2)=0.77). We conclude that (S)-[18F]-fluoroethylcarazolol is a high affinity ligand that binds specifically to cerebral beta-adrenoceptors in vivo and may be of use for beta-adrenoceptor imaging in the brain with PET."
