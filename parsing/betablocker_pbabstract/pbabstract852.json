    "0": "A catecholamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase system is present in homogenates of both calf and rat retinas. Dopamine is a more potent activator of the bovine enzyme than is norepinephrine or epinephrine. Cyclic AMP concentrations in intact bovine retina are increased by dopamine, as well as by other catecholamines, and by depolarizing agents. Studies with adrenergic blocking agents suggest that the stimulation of retinal adenylate cyclase by catecholamines cannot be clearly defined in terms of the characteristics of alpha or beta adrenergic receptors. Bovine retina also contains a protein kinase that is stimulated 20-fold by cyclic AMP. It is proposed that dopamine is the major activator of a retinal adenylate cyclase, and that this activation is related to its role as a neurotransmitter.", 
    "1": "1. In forty-one out of forty-seven dogs under chloralose-urethane or Nembutal anaesthesia, mechanical stimulation of the nasal mucous membrane caused a reduction or inhibition of respiration, bradycardia, variable changes of arterial blood pressure, and a small rise in venous pressure.2. Simultaneous measurements of arterial and venous pressures, and also of blood flow in various arteries by means of an electromagnetic flowmeter indicate that the calculated vascular resistance increases in the intact limb, muscle, and skin, and the vascular beds of the vertebral, superior mesenteric, renal and splenic arteries. No changes in vascular resistance occur in the common carotid circulation.3. Evidence is presented that the increase in vascular resistance is due to vasoconstriction, and occurs in the absence of changes in pulmonary ventilation.4. Stimulation of the nasal mucous membrane causes a reduction in volume of the spleen.5. The respiratory and cardiovascular responses are reflex in nature, being abolished by the application of a local anaesthetic to the nose or by combined division of the maxillary and ethmoidal branches of the trigeminal nerves. The cardiac response is mediated largely by the vagus nerves, and the vascular responses by sympathetic adrenergic fibres.6. Cessation of the stimulus to the nose not infrequently results in the following temporary after-effects: hyperventilation, tachycardia, hypertension, and vasodilatation in the intact limb and in muscle.", 
    "2": "1. Manninen (1970) recently reported that in the presence of calcium ions, (+)-propranolol causes a massive loss of potassium ions from human red cells, together with a marked inward ;counter-transport' of potassium ions from the medium.2. This paper shows, theoretically, that counter-transport of the kind he observed may be accounted for by the setting up of a diffusion potential across the cell membrane and does not imply that, under the influence of propranolol, potassium ions cross the membrane by some process other than free diffusion.3. The physiological and pharmacological significance of this interpretation of Manninen's findings is briefly discussed.", 
    "3": "Synthetic thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) was administered intravenously in a dose of 7 mug/kg to 20 normal children ages 4-13 yr. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was measured by radioimmunoassay and rose from a mean value of 1.7 muU/ml (range = < 1.25-7.2) to a mean peak value of 21.5 muU/ml (5.2-33.2) at 15 or 30 min after administration.13 patients with idiopathic hypopituitarism and apparent normal thyroid function, ages 3-19 yr, responded to TRH in a manner very similar to the control subjects: TSH rose from a mean value of 1.8 muU/ml (range < 1.25-4.3) to a mean peak value of 18.5 muU/ml (range = 9.5-45.0) which occurred between 15 and 60 min after TRH.13 idiopathic hypopituitary patients with documented thyroid deficiency were tested after thyroid therapy had been discontinued for a minimum of 10 days. The serum TSH values in 10 of 13 patients rose from a mean base line level of 2.2 muU/ml (< 1.25-5.3) to a peak mean value of 32.5 muU/ml (9.6-61.3) between 30 and 120 min after TRH. In three patients, however, little or no TSH response was detected, even when serum thyroxine levels were extremely low. Similar to the latter group, three of five patients with hypopituitarism secondary to craniopharyngiomas had undetectable or barely measurable TSH levels before and after TRH. Two of these five patients had significant responses which were compatible with hypopituitarism resulting from damage to the hypothalamus or hypothalamic vessels instead of the pituitary. Side effects were experienced in 41 of 54 patients (76%). The effects were limited to a mild nausea-like sensation in 63% of the patients and occurred within the first 5 min after receiving TRH. No evidence of serious toxicity or long-term side effects was noted. The TRH test is a safe, effective way to measure TSH reserve in children. The positive response in 10 of 13 patients with secondary hypothyroidism supports data previously accumulated that most patients with idiopathic hypopituitarism have an abnormality of their hypothalamic-releasing hormone function, whereas the remaining minority probably have primary pituitary disease.", 
    "4": "Turkey erythrocyte membranes showed specific binding of [(3)H]epinephrine. The concentration of hormone required for half-maximal binding (30 muM) was the same as that required for half-maximal activation of the adenylate cyclase located in the same membrane preparation. The binding reaction at 37 degrees C reached completion during the first minute of incubation, which agrees well with the known rapidity of the biological response to catecholamines. Specific binding was abolished by heating the membranes 1 min at 100 degrees C. Chromatography of the bound (3)H, after its extraction from the membranes, indicated that the hormone had fully retained its chemical structure. Epinephrine binding was inhibited by the beta-adrenergic blocking agent propranolol, which also inhibited the activation of adenylate cyclase by the hormone. The specificity of phenethylamine derivatives in displacing [(3)H]epinephrine from the binding sites showed that a typical catecholamine receptor was responsible for the binding. Displacement of the bound hormone by analogs lacking the catechol group was more extensive at 37 degrees C than at 0 degrees C. Some of the analogs that displaced epinephrine from the binding site caused only a feeble activation of the adenylate cyclase, but were able to inhibit the activation of the enzyme by epinephrine. Thus, binding to a catecholamine receptor on a membrane preparation is an essential, but insufficient, condition to elicit a response."
