Of the few descriptions of hemolytic anemia secondary to HC, all but one case involved bacterial endocarditis contributing to left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. We present the case of a 67-year-old man with recurrent hemolytic anemia and HC, without infective endocarditis. Attempts at iron repletion and augmentation of beta-blocker therapy proved his anemia to be refractory to medical management. Ventricular septal myectomy led to the resolution of hemolysis, anemia, and its coexisting symptoms.", 
    "1": "In the cochlea, Reissner's membrane separates the scala media endolymphatic compartment that sustains the positive endocochlear potential and ion composition necessary for sound transduction, from the scala vestibuli perilymphatic compartment. It is known that with sustained elevated sound levels, adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) is released into the endolymph and ATP-gated ion channels on the epithelial cells lining the endolymphatic compartment shunt the electrochemical driving force, contributing to protective purinergic hearing adaptation. This study characterises the properties of epithelial cell P2X(2)-type ATP-activated membrane conductance in the mouse Reissner's membrane, which forms a substantial fraction of the scale media surface. The cells were found to express two isoforms (a and b) of the P2X(2) subunit arising from alternative splicing of the messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript that could contribute to the trimeric subunit assembly. The ATP-activated conductance demonstrated both immediate and delayed desensitisation consistent with incorporation of the combination of P2X(2) subunit isoforms. Activation by the ATP analogue 2meSATP had equipotency to ATP, whereas \u03b1,\u03b2-meATP and adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP) were ineffective. Positive allosteric modulation of the P2X(2) channels by protons was profound. This native conductance was blocked by the P2X(2)-selective blocker pyridoxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulphonic acid (PPADS) and the conductance was absent in these cells isolated from mice null for the P2rX2 gene encoding the P2X(2) receptor subunit. The activation and desensitisation properties of the Reissner's membrane epithelial cell ATP-gated P2X(2) channels likely contribute to the sensitivity and kinetics of purinergic control of the electrochemical driving force for sound transduction invoked by noise exposure.",

In the brain and retina, blood-tissue barriers such as blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood-retinal barrier (BRB) are formed to restrict nonspecific solute transport between the circulating blood and neural tissues. Therefore study of cationic drug transport at these barriers is essential to achieve systemic delivery of neuroprotective agents into the neural tissues. In the retina, severe diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and macular degeneration can cause neurological dysfunction that dramatically affects patients' QOL. The BRB is formed by retinal capillary endothelial cells (inner BRB) and retinal pigment epithelial cells (outer BRB). Blood-to-retina transport of cationic drugs was investigated at the inner BRB, which is known to nourish two thirds of the retina. Blood-to-retinal transport of verapamil suggested that the barrier function of the BRB differs from that of the BBB. Moreover, carrier-mediated transport of verapamil and pyrilamine revealed the involvement of novel organic cation transporters at the inner BRB. The identified transport systems for cationic drugs are sensitive to several cationic neuroprotective and anti-angiogenic agents such as clonidine and propranolol, and the involvement of novel transporters was also suggested in their blood-to-retina transport across the inner BRB.",

Acebutolol is one of the commonly used \u03b2-blockers for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. It has been frequently detected in the aquatic environment. In the kinetics study, the second-order rate constant for the reaction between acebutolol and chlorine (k app) was determined at 25 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b0C. The degradation of acebutolol by free available chlorine was highly pH dependence. When the pH increased from 6 to 8, it was found that the k app for the reaction between acebutolol and free available chlorine was increased from 1.68 to 11.2 M(-1) min(-1). By comparing with the reported k app values, the reactivity of acebutolol toward free available chlorine was found to be higher than atenolol and metoprolol but lower than nadolol and propranolol. Characterization of the transformation by-products formed during the chlorination of acebutolol was carried out using liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight high-resolution mass spectrometry. Seven major transformation by-products were identified. These transformation by-products were mainly formed through dealkylation, hydroxylation, chlorination, and oxidation reactions.",

This suggests that the evolutionary stage of PHT may influence the response to \u03b2-blockers. To characterize the hemodynamic profile of each stage of PHT in compensated cirrhosis and the response to \u03b2-blockers according to stage, we performed a prospective, multicenter (tertiary care setting), cross-sectional study. Hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) and systemic hemodynamic were measured in 273 patients with compensated cirrhosis before and after intravenous propranolol (0.15 mg/kg): 194 patients had an HVPG \u226510 mm Hg (clinically significant PHT [CSPH]), with either no varices (n = 80) or small varices (n = 114), and 79 had an HVPG >5 and <10 mm Hg (subclinical PHT).

Methods. A historical cohort study of COPD patients, undergoing lung resection surgery at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center between 2002 and 2006. Primary outcomes were the rate of postoperative COPD exacerbations, defined as any initiation or increase of glucocorticoids for documented bronchospasm. Results. 520 patients with COPD were identified who underwent lung resection. Of these, 205 (39%) received perioperative \u03b2-blockers and 315 (61%) did not. COPD was mild among 361 patients (69% of all patients), moderate in 117 patients (23%), and severe in 42 patients (8%). COPD exacerbations occurred among 11 (5.4%) patients who received perioperative \u03b2-blockers and among 20 (6.3%) patients who did not. Secondary outcomes, which included respiratory failure, 30-day mortality, and the presence or absence of any cardiovascular complication, ICU transfer, cardiovascular complication, or readmission within 30 days, did not differ in prevalence between the two groups.

We describe a randomized, double-blind study to explore whether heart rate reduction with the If inhibitor ivabradine had an impact on central blood pressure. We included 12 normotensive patients with stable coronary artery disease, heart rate \u226570 bpm (sinus rhythm), and stable background \u03b2-blocker therapy. Patients received ivabradine 7.5 mg BID or matched placebo for two 3-week periods with a crossover design and evaluation by aplanation tonometry.

Myocardial oxygen demand was assessed indirectly by the left ventricular mass\u00d7wall stress\u00d7heart rate (triple product) in 905 LIFE participants. The triple product was included as time-varying covariate in Cox models assessing predictors of the LIFE primary composite end point (cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke), its individual components, and all-cause mortality. At baseline, the triple product in both treatment groups was, compared with normal adults, elevated in 70% of patients. During randomized treatment, the triple product was reduced more by atenolol, with prevalences of elevated triple product of 39% versus 51% on losartan (both P\u22640.001).

The taking of \u03b2 blocker is not common in ventricular arrhythmia group patients than no ventricular arrhythmia group (5 vs. 29%, P = 0.03). By univariate comparison, male sex, the history of atrial fibrillation, and a high level of hsCRP were significant predictors for ventricular arrhythmia occurrence. By multivariate analysis, the atrial fibrillation burden, and had a high level of hsCRP were significant for incidence of ventricular arrhythmia occurrence in ischemic heart disease patients. \u03b2-block were more likely to be free from ventricular arrhythmia occurrence. The high level of hsCRP, and the atrial fibrillation burden were strong predictor of ventricular arrhythmia occurrence in secondary prevention ICD recipients with ischemic heart disease. Taking \u03b2-blockers was free from ventricular arrhythmia occurrence.",

Semi-automatic measurements of T-peak, T-end, and QRS onset were obtained. The TpTe/QT ratio was calculated to investigate the proportional relationship of QT and TpTe.", 
    "46": "Although a significant increase of both TpTe and QT from baseline is apparent with QT-prolonging drugs, the TpTe/QT ratio remained the same at baseline and after drug administration, thus indicating that prolongation of TpTe is just a fractional part of total QT prolongation. In the presence of notched or flattened T-waves, the uncertainty associated with measurement of the TpTe interval increases. The errors in TpTe for individual subjects may be substantial, thus complicating the use of TpTe for follow-up of individuals.",

    "48": "Leptin has been proposed to modulate cardiac electrical properties via \u03b2-adrenergic receptor activation. The presence of leptin receptors and adipocytes in myocardium raised a question as to whether leptin can directly modulate cardiac electrical properties such as heart rate and QT interval via its receptor. In this work, the role of local direct actions of leptin on heart rate and ventricular repolarization was investigated. We identified the protein expression of leptin receptors at cell surface of sinus node, atrial, and ventricular myocytes isolated from rat heart. Leptin at low doses (0.1-30 \u03bcg/kg) decreased resting heart rate; at high doses (150-300 \u03bcg/kg), leptin induced a biphasic effect (decrease and then increase) on heart rate. In the presence of high-dose propranolol (30 mg/kg), high-dose leptin only reduced heart rate and sometimes caused sinus pauses and ventricular tachycardia. The leptin-induced inhibition of resting heart rate was fully reversed by leptin antagonist. Leptin also increased heart rate-corrected QT interval (QTc), and leptin antagonist did not. In isolated ventricular myocytes, leptin (0.03-0.3 \u03bcg/ml) reversibly increased the action potential duration. These results supported our hypothesis that in addition to indirect pathway via sympathetic tone, leptin can directly decrease heart rate and increase QT interval via its receptor independent of \u03b2-adrenergic receptor stimulation. During inhibition of \u03b2-adrenergic receptor activity, high concentration of leptin in myocardium can cause deep bradycardia, prolonged QT interval, and ventricular arrhythmias.", 
    "49": "Normal pregnancy is associated with adaptive hemodynamic, hormonal, and vascular changes, and estrogen (E2) may promote vasodilation during pregnancy; however, the specific E2 receptor (ER) subtype, post-ER signaling mechanism, and vascular bed involved are unclear. We tested whether pregnancy-associated vascular adaptations involve changes in the expression/distribution/activity of distinct ER subtypes in a blood vessel-specific manner. Blood pressure (BP) and plasma E2 were measured in virgin and pregnant (day 19) rats, and the thoracic aorta, carotid artery, mesenteric artery, and renal artery were isolated for measurements of ER\u03b1, ER\u03b2, and G protein-coupled receptor 30 [G protein-coupled ER (GPER)] expression and tissue distribution in parallel with relaxation responses to E2 (all ERs) and the specific ER agonist 4,4',4\u2033-(4-propyl-[1H]-pyrazole-1,3,5-triyl)-tris-phenol (PPT; ER\u03b1), diarylpropionitrile (DPN; ER\u03b2), and G1 (GPER). BP was slightly lower and plasma E2 was higher in pregnant versus virgin rats. Western blots revealed increased ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 in the aorta and mesenteric artery and GPER in the aorta of pregnant versus virgin rats. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the increases in ERs were mainly in the intima and media. In phenylephrine-precontracted vessels, E2 and PPT caused relaxation that was greater in the aorta and mesenteric artery but similar in the carotid and renal artery of pregnant versus virgin rats. DPN- and G1-induced relaxation was greater in the mesenteric and renal artery than in the aorta and carotid artery, and aortic relaxation to G1 was greater in pregnant versus virgin rats. The nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N(\u03c9)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester with or without the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin with or without the EDHF blocker tetraethylammonium or endothelium removal reduced E2, PPT, and G1-induced relaxation in the aorta of pregnant rats, suggesting an endothelium-dependent mechanism, but did not affect E2-, PPT-, DPN-, or G1-induced relaxation in other vessels, suggesting endothelium-independent mechanisms. E2, PPT, DPN, and G1 caused relaxation of Ca(2+) entry-dependent KCl contraction, and the effect of PPT was greater in the mesenteric artery of pregnant versus virgin rats. Thus, during pregnancy, an increase in ER\u03b1 expression in endothelial and vascular smooth muscle layers of the aorta and mesenteric artery is associated with increased ER\u03b1-mediated relaxation via endothelium-derived vasodilators and inhibition of Ca(2+) entry into vascular smooth muscle, supporting a role of aortic and mesenteric arterial ER\u03b1 in pregnancy-associated vasodilation. GPER may contribute to aortic relaxation while enhanced ER\u03b2 expression could mediate other genomic vascular effects during pregnancy.", 
    "50": "Mitochondrial trifunctional protein and long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiencies are fatty acid oxidation disorders biochemically characterized by tissue accumulation of long-chain fatty acids and derivatives, including the monocarboxylic long-chain 3-hydroxy fatty acids (LCHFAs) 3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid (3HTA) and 3-hydroxypalmitic acid (3HPA). Patients commonly present severe cardiomyopathy for which the pathogenesis is still poorly established. We investigated the effects of 3HTA and 3HPA, the major metabolites accumulating in these disorders, on important parameters of mitochondrial homeostasis in Ca(2+) -loaded heart mitochondria. 3HTA and 3HPA significantly decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, the matrix NAD(P)H pool and Ca(2+) retention capacity, and also induced mitochondrial swelling. These fatty acids also provoked a marked decrease of ATP production reflecting severe energy dysfunction. Furthermore, 3HTA-induced mitochondrial alterations were completely prevented by the classical mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT) inhibitors cyclosporin A and ADP, as well as by ruthenium red, a Ca(2+) uptake blocker, indicating that LCHFAs induced Ca(2+)-dependent mPT pore opening. Milder effects only achieved at higher doses of LCHFAs were observed in brain mitochondria, implying a higher vulnerability of heart to these fatty acids. By contrast, 3HTA and docosanoic acids did not change mitochondrial homeostasis, indicating selective effects for monocarboxylic LCHFAs. The present data indicate that the major LCHFAs accumulating in mitochondrial trifunctional protein and long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiencies induce mPT pore opening, compromising Ca(2+) homeostasis and oxidative phosphorylation more intensely in the heart. It is proposed that these pathomechanisms may contribute at least in part to the severe cardiac alterations characteristic of patients affected by these diseases.", 
    "51": "Increased electrical activity in peripheral sensory neurons including dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and trigeminal ganglia neurons is an important mechanism underlying pain. Voltage gated sodium channels (VGSC) contribute to the excitability of sensory neurons and are essential for the upstroke of action potentials. A unique type of VGSC current, resurgent current (INaR), generates an inward current at repolarizing voltages through an alternate mechanism of inactivation referred to as open-channel block. INaRs are proposed to enable high frequency firing and increased INaRs in sensory neurons are associated with pain pathologies. While Nav1.6 has been identified as the main carrier of fast INaR, our understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to INaR generation is limited. Specifically, the open-channel blocker in sensory neurons has not been identified. Previous studies suggest Nav\u03b24 subunit mediates INaR in central nervous system neurons. The goal of this study was to determine whether Nav\u03b24 regulates INaR in DRG sensory neurons.", 
    "52": "Our immunocytochemistry studies show that Nav\u03b24 expression is highly correlated with Nav1.6 expression predominantly in medium-large diameter rat DRG neurons. Nav\u03b24 knockdown decreased endogenous fast INaR in medium-large diameter neurons as measured with whole-cell voltage clamp. Using a reduced expression system in DRG neurons, we isolated recombinant human Nav1.6 sodium currents in rat DRG neurons and found that overexpression of Nav\u03b24 enhanced Nav1.6 INaR generation. By contrast neither overexpression of Nav\u03b22 nor overexpression of a Nav\u03b24-mutant, predicted to be an inactive form of Nav\u03b24, enhanced Nav1.6 INaR generation. DRG neurons transfected with wild-type Nav\u03b24 exhibited increased excitability with increases in both spontaneous activity and evoked activity. Thus, Nav\u03b24 overexpression enhanced INaR and excitability, whereas knockdown or expression of mutant Nav\u03b24 decreased INaR generation.", 
    "53": "INaRs are associated with inherited and acquired pain disorders. However, our ability to selectively target and study this current has been hindered due to limited understanding of how it is generated in sensory neurons. This study identified Nav\u03b24 as an important regulator of INaR and excitability in sensory neurons. As such, Nav\u03b24 is a potential target for the manipulation of pain sensations.", 
    "54": "The treatment of infantile hemangiomas changed from the use of oral corticosteroids to oral propranolol on the serendipitous discovery of propanolol's clinical effectiveness in 2008. Since then, clinicians have begun to use topical beta blockers--in particular, timolol maleate 0.5% gel forming solution--with good effect. Topical beta blockers are now used for lesions with both deep and superficial components and those that are amblyogenic. When initiated in the proliferative phase of the lesion, the effectiveness of the treatment can be seen within days. There is no consensus on dosing, treatment bioavailability, or clinical assessment of lesions, but these are topics for future research.", 
    "55": "Acebutolol, a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor-blocker, occasionally causes drug-induced lupus erythematosus (DILE). Acebutolol is mainly metabolized to diacetolol. Because metabolic activation has been considered to be related to acebutolol-induced toxicity, we sought to identify the enzymes that are responsible for acebutolol metabolism and investigate their involvement in acebutolol-induced toxicity. By using human liver microsomes (HLM) or intestinal microsomes and recombinant enzymes, we found that diacetolol was produced via hydrolysis by carboxylesterase 2 (CES2) and subsequent acetylation by N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2). When acetolol, a hydrolytic metabolite of acebutolol, was incubated with HLM and an NADPH-generating system, a metabolite conjugated with N-acetylcystein was generated. This metabolite was found to be formed by CYP2C19 based on studies with a panel of recombinant cytochrome P450 enzymes and an inhibition study using HLM with tranylcypromine, a CYP2C19 inhibitor. Because antinuclear antibody (ANA) production is associated with DILE, we investigated whether ANA was detected in plasma from mice treated with acebutolol. Administration of acebutolol (100mg/kg, p.o.) to female C57BL/6 mice for 30 days resulted in ANA production in plasma in seven of thirteen mice. The number of mice that showed ANA production was larger in mice co-treated with pregnenolone 16\u03b1-carbonitrile, an inducer of P450s, whereas it was lower in mice co-treated with tri-o-tolylphosphate or 1-aminobenzotriazole, which are inhibitors of esterases or P450s, respectively. These results suggested that the hydrolysis and oxidation of acebutolol was associated with ANA production. In summary, this study demonstrated that metabolic activation may be a causal factor of adverse reactions of acebutolol.",

HFpEF has no single guideline for diagnosis or treatment, the patient population is heterogeneously and inconsistently described, and longitudinal studies are lacking. The primary aims of this manuscript were to present an integrated review of the current state of the science on HFpEF, demonstrate gaps in the literature and provide the rationale for the design and implementation of future research to yield insights into the syndrome of HFpEF. The scientific literature was comprehensively reviewed on HFpEF pathophysiology, patient characteristics, diagnostic criteria, echocardiography biomarkers, treatment approaches and outcomes. Discrepancies in patient characteristics, diagnostic criteria, study methods and echocardiographic biomarkers were identified. This review indicates that no single test or guideline exists for diagnosis or treatment for HFpEF; heterogeneity of the population is complicated by multiple comorbidities that factor into etiology, race and age are likely important factors that define the phenotype, and limited information is available that designates early markers of impending HFpEF. Studies designed and adequately powered to study the impact of race and age along with consistent use of HFpEF diagnostic criteria are critically needed to further incident HFpEF research.", 
    "61": "This study is the first to investigate the role of the KATP channel in the possible protection mediated by nicorandil against cyclophosphamide-induced lung and testicular toxicity in rats. Animals received cyclophosphamide (150 mg/kg/day, i.p.) for 2 consecutive days and then were untreated for the following 5 days. Nicorandil (3 mg/kg/day, p.o.) was administered starting from the day of cyclophosphamide injection with or without glibenclamide (5 mg/kg/day, p.o.). Nicorandil administration significantly reduced the cyclophosphamide-induced deterioration of testicular function, as demonstrated by increases in the level of serum testosterone and the activities of the testicular 3\u03b2- hydroxysteroid, 17\u03b2-hydroxysteroid and sorbitol dehydrogenases. Furthermore, nicorandil significantly alleviated oxidative stress (as determined by lipid peroxides and reduced glutathione levels and total antioxidant capacity), as well as inflammatory markers (tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interleukin-1\u03b2), in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and testicular tissue. Finally, the therapy decreased the levels of fibrogenic markers (transforming growth factor-\u03b2 and hydroxyproline) and ameliorated the histological alterations (as assessed by lung fibrosis grading and testicular Johnsen scores). The co-administration of glibenclamide (a KATP channel blocker) blocked the protective effects of nicorandil. In conclusion, KATP channel activation plays an important role in the protective effect of nicorandil against cyclophosphamide-induced lung and testicular toxicity.",

    "67": "In heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF), adrenergic activation is a key compensatory mechanism that is a major contributor to progressive ventricular remodeling and worsening of heart failure. Targeting the increased adrenergic activation with \u03b2-adrenergic receptor blocking agents has led to the development of arguably the single most effective drug therapy for HFrEF. The pressure-overloaded and ultimately remodeled/failing right ventricle (RV) in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is also adrenergically activated, which raises the issue of whether an antiadrenergic strategy could be effectively employed in this setting. Anecdotal experience suggests that it will be challenging to administer an antiadrenergic treatment such as a \u03b2-blocking agent to patients with established moderate-severe PAH. However, the same types of data and commentary were prevalent early in the development of \u03b2-blockade for HFrEF treatment. In addition, in HFrEF approaches have been developed for delivering \u03b2-blocker therapy to patients who have extremely advanced heart failure, and these general principles could be applied to RV failure in PAH. This review examines the role played by adrenergic activation in the RV faced with PAH, contrasts PAH-RV remodeling with left ventricle remodeling in settings of sustained increases in afterload, and suggests a possible approach for safely delivering an antiadrenergic treatment to patients with RV dysfunction due to moderate-severe PAH.", 
    "68": "Ligand binding of neutral progesterone, basic propranolol, and acidic warfarin to human \u03b11-acid glycoprotein (AGP) was investigated by Raman spectroscopy. The binding itself is characterized by a uniform conformational shift in which a tryptophan residue is involved. Slight differences corresponding to different contacts of the individual ligands inside the \u03b2-barrel are described. Results are compared with in silico ligand docking into the available crystal structure of deglycosylated AGP using quantum/molecular mechanics. Calculated binding energies are -18.2, -14.5, and -11.5\u2009kcal/mol for warfarin, propranolol, and progesterone, respectively. These calculations are consistent with Raman difference spectroscopy; nevertheless, minor discrepancies in the precise positions of the ligands point to structural differences between deglycosylated and native AGP. Thermal dynamics of AGP with/without bounded warfarin was followed by Raman spectroscopy in a temperature range of 10-95\u2009\u00b0C and analyzed by principal component analysis. With increasing temperature, a slight decrease of \u03b1-helical content is observed that coincides with an increase in \u03b2-sheet content. Above 45\u2009\u00b0C, also \u03b2-strands tend to unfold, and the observed decrease in \u03b2-sheet coincides with an increase of \u03b2-turns accompanied by a conformational shift of the nearby disulfide bridge from high-energy trans-gauche-trans to more relaxed gauche-gauche-trans. This major rearrangement in the vicinity of the bridge is not only characterized by unfolding of the \u03b2-sheet but also by subsequent ligand release. Hereby, ligand binding alters the protein dynamics, and the more rigid protein-ligand complex shows an improved thermal stability, a finding that contributes to the reported chaperone-like function of AGP.",

Of the patients who survived to hospital discharge (n = 17) following stage 1, 14 (82 %) required readmission for heart failure (HF) compared to only two (10 %) for controls (p < 0.001). Among patients with ventricular dysfunction, there was an increased use of ACE inhibitors or beta-blockers (82 vs. 25 %; p = 0.001), inotropes (71 vs. 15 %; p = 0.001), ventilation (58 vs. 10 %; p = 0.001), and ECMO (29 vs. 0 %; p = 0.014) for HF management post-discharge when compared to controls. There was a lower heart transplant-free survival at 7 months in patients with dysfunction compared to controls (50.6 vs. 90.9 %; p = 0.040). ECMO support (p = 0.001) and duration of inotropic support (p = 0.04) were significantly associated with death or transplantation before stage II palliation. Patients with ventricular dysfunction received more HF management and related admissions. Longer inotropic support should prompt discussion regarding alternative treatment strategies given its association with death or transplant.",

Surgery is the definitive treatment for Graves thyrotoxicosis that is generally recommended when other treatments have failed or are contraindicated. Generally, thyrotoxic patients should be euthyroid before surgery to minimize potential complications which usually requires preoperative management with thionamides or inorganic iodine. But several cases of refractory Graves' disease have shown resistance to conventional treatment. Here we report a 40-year-old female patient with Graves' disease who complained of thyrotoxic symptoms for 7 months. Her thyroid function test and thyroid autoantibody profiles were consistent with Graves' disease. One kind of thionamides and \u03b2-blocker were started to control her disease. However, she was resistant to nearly all conventional medical therapies, including \u03b2-blockers, inorganic iodine, and two thionamides. She experienced hepatotoxicity from the thionamides. What was worse is her past history of serious allergic reaction to corticosteroids, which are often used to help control symptoms. A 2-week regimen of high-dose cholestyramine improved her uncontrolled thyrotoxicosis and subsequent thyroidectomy was successfully performed. In conclusion, cholestyramine could be administered as an effective and safe adjunctive agent for preoperative preparation in patients with severe hyperthyroid Graves's disease that is resistant to conventional therapies.",

These tumors do not express VHL protein (pVHL). pVHL ubiquitinates hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) protein for degradation by the proteasome; in the absence of VHL, HIF translocates to the nucleus to activate the expression of its target genes. Targeting VHL-derived tumors with drugs that have reduced side effects is urgent to avoid repeat CNS surgeries. Recent reports have shown that propranolol, a \u03b2-blocker used for the treatment of hypertension and other cardiac and neurological diseases, is the best option for infantile hemangioma (IH).

It has attracted much attention due to its variety of pharmacological and biological characteristics. The purpose of this research was to judge the effect and the mechanism of novokinin on porcine coronary arteries. The isometrical tension of coronary arterial rings getted from porcine hearts was measured and its reaction to novokinin (10(-12)-10(-5) mol/L) was observed. It was found that novokinin inhibited the vasocontractivity to KCl and CaCl2 and evidently decreased the isomeric tensile force of both quiescent and prostaglandin F2\u03b1 (PGF2\u03b1) precontracted porcine coronary arterial ring segments. This relaxing effect of novokinin on porcine coronary arteries was apparently cutted down by getting rid of endothelium, and by the addition of methylene blue, N-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA) or indomethacin, but not by propranolol. Novokini also inhibited the KCl- and CaCl2-induced vasocontraction. The experimental results show that relaxed effect of novokinin on porcine coronary arteries might relate to the function of nitric oxide (NO), cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and the synthesis of prostaglandin, but not involve adrenergic \u03b2-receptor.",

We report a new case of a 61-year-old man suffering from SRPE associated with OSAS. The adequate treatment of respiratory events with continuous positive airway pressure did not alleviate the SRPE symptoms and excessive daytime sleepiness. The SRPE diagnosis was made by polysomnography coupled with video surveillance when the patient was referred to the sleep laboratory for residual excessive daytime sleepiness. The patient had 2-4 episodes of SRPE/night. Beta-blocker did not alleviate the SRPE, but a transient improvement was noted when the patient was treated with paroxetine.

Amphibians represent particularly vulnerable organisms and many populations around the world are currently at risk of extinction. However, to date, relatively few studies have explored the consequences of exposures to common non-steroidal pharmaceuticals during sensitive amphibian life-stages. To address existing knowledge gaps, tadpoles of the Australian striped-marsh frog (Limnodynastes peronii) were exposed to control water and a mixture of the common pharmaceutical contaminants diclofenac, naproxen, atenolol and gemfibrozil at 0.1, 1, 10, 100 and 1000\u00a0\u03bcg/L throughout the developmental period. Effects on detoxification pathways, energy storage, growth and development, and swimming performance were assessed following exposure. Developmental rates and liver-somatic index (LSI) were significantly reduced in the highest exposure concentration, and condition factor (K) was increased at concentrations as low as 10\u00a0\u03bcg/L. Morphological endpoints were associated with significantly altered levels of hepatic triglycerides, which in turn were correlated with increased peroxidase activity in animals exposed to the highest concentration (1000\u00a0\u03bcg/L). The mixture had no significant effect on swimming performance, but a trend of decreased swimming velocity (average and maximum) was observed with increasing concentration, and this was correlated with effects on LSI. Results demonstrate that mixtures of common non-steroidal pharmaceuticals can elicit a range of physiological, metabolic and morphological responses in larval amphibians, and more research is therefore warranted to explore possible relationships between endpoints at different levels of organization.",

There is a substantial body of evidence to suggest that patients with heart failure and atrial fibrillation who have less stringent ventricular rate control have a better outcome. The most plausible explanation for these findings, in our view, is that \u03b2-blockers exert similar benefits through similar mechanisms regardless of intrinsic heart rhythm but that the benefits of \u03b2-blockers are neutralized in patients with atrial fibrillation due to the induction of pauses that may impair cardiac function leading to worsening heart failure or cause arrhythmias resulting in death.",

This could potentially improve adherence for those patients currently taking many separate tablets and also allow ready tailoring of a particular drug combination/drug release for the needs of an individual. The polypill here represents a cardiovascular treatment regime with the incorporation of an immediate release compartment with aspirin and hydrochlorothiazide and three sustained release compartments containing pravastatin, atenolol, and ramipril. X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) were used to assess drug-excipient interaction.

Core temperature measurements were made telemetrically over a 7.5h session, two days/week, in test chambers regulated at either 18\u00b0C, 24\u00b0C, or 30\u00b0C ambient temperature. Rats were treated with the \u03b21 antagonist metoprolol (5.0, 10.0, and 15.0mg/kg) alone (Experiment 1), or in combination with 5.0mg/kg METH (Experiment 2). In experiment 3, we combined a lower dose range of metoprolol (0.75, 1.5, and 3.0mg/kg) with 5.0mg/kg METH at 18\u00b0C and 30\u00b0C. Confirming prior findings, METH alone resulted in hyperthermia in warm (30\u00b0) and hypothermia in cool environments (18\u00b0C). Metoprolol alone induced small but significant increases in core temperature. In combination, however, metoprolol reduced METH-induced changes in core temperature. Specifically, at 30\u00b0C, 3.0, 5.0, 10.0, and 15.0mg/kg metoprolol decreased METH-induced hyperthermia; at 18\u00b0C, all six doses of metoprolol enhanced METH-induced hypothermia. Our metoprolol findings suggest that one component of METH's temperature effects involves increasing core temperature at all ambient conditions via \u03b21 receptors. Since \u03b2 receptors are involved in brown adipose tissue (BAT)-mediated thermogenesis, skeletal muscle-mediated thermogenesis, heart rate, and the metabolism of glucose and lipids, we discuss each of these as possible mechanisms for metoprolol's effects on METH-induced changes in core temperature.",

The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of PCNs mixture, Halowax 1051 on gene and protein expression of receptors: estradiol (ER\u03b1/\u03b2), androgen (AR) and AHRGene expression was evaluated by real-time PCR after 6 h of exposition and protein expression by Western blot after 24 h. Levels of sex steroids: androstenedione (A4), estradiol (E2) and testosterone (T) were measured by enzyme immunoassays. Results of the data show down-regulation of AHR gene expression after 6 h in parallel with an inhibition in AHR protein expression at doses 10 pg-10 ng/mL, down-regulation of ER at all doses used, and up-regulation of AR gene expression at doses 1 and 10 ng/mL without affecting their protein expression. To indicate the involvement of AHR, ERs and AR in the impact of PCNs on steroidogenesis, we used their specific blockers. Blocker of AHR reversed the inhibitory effect of Halowax 1051 on A4 secretion, and strengthened its effect on T secretion. Blockers of both ER and AR had no effect on Halowax 1051 action on steroids secretion. The results of this study suggest that AHR is involved in the effect of PCNs on steroidogenesis in the ovary.

(RS)-4-[3-(tert-butylamino)-2-hydroxypropoxy]-1H-indole-2-carbonitrile (cyanopindolol) is a weak partial agonist of \u03b21AR and, based on the hypothesis above, we predicted that the addition of a methyl group to form 4-[(2S)-3-(tert-butylamino)-2-hydroxypropoxy]-7-methyl-1H-indole-2-carbonitrile (7-methylcyanopindolol) would dramatically reduce its efficacy. An eight-step synthesis of 7-methylcyanopindolol was developed and its pharmacology was analyzed. 7-Methylcyanopindolol bound with similar affinity to cyanopindolol to both \u03b21AR and \u03b22AR. As predicted, the efficacy of 7-methylcyanopindolol was reduced significantly compared with cyanopindolol, acting as a very weak partial agonist of turkey \u03b21AR and an inverse agonist of human \u03b22AR. The structure of 7-methylcyanopindolol-bound \u03b21AR was determined to 2.4-\u00c5 resolution and found to be virtually identical to the structure of cyanopindolol-bound \u03b21AR. The major differences in the orthosteric binding pocket are that it has expanded by 0.3 \u00c5 in 7-methylcyanopindolol-bound \u03b21AR and the hydroxyl group of Ser(5.46) is positioned 0.8 \u00c5 further from the ligand, with respect to the position of the Ser(5.46) side chain in cyanopindolol-bound \u03b21AR. Thus, the molecular basis for the reduction in efficacy of 7-methylcyanopindolol compared with cyanopindolol may be regarded as the opposite of the mechanism proposed for the increase in efficacy of agonists compared with antagonists.", 
    "139": "A clinical study was conducted to validate the in vivo drug release performance of IntelliCap\u00ae CR capsules. 12 healthy, male volunteers were administered IntelliCap\u00ae CR capsules, filled with metoprolol as a BCS 1 model drug, and programmed to release the drug with 3 different release profiles (2 linear profiles extending over 6h and 14h, respectively, and a pulsed profile with two equal pulses separated by 5h) using a cross-over design. An oral metoprolol solution was included as a reference. Standard bioavailability variables were determined. In vivo drug release-time profiles for the IntelliCap\u00ae CR capsules were calculated from the plasma drug concentrations by deconvolution, and they were subsequently compared with the in vitro drug release profiles including assessment of level A in vitro/in vivo correlation (IVIVC). The relative bioavailability for the linear, extended release profiles was about 85% which is similar to other extended release administrations of metoprolol. There was an excellent agreement between the predetermined release profiles and the in vivo release for these two administrations. For IntelliCap\u00ae CR capsules programmed to deliver 2 distinct and equal drug pulses, the first pulse was delivered as expected whereas only about half of the second dose was released. Thus, it is concluded that the IntelliCap\u00ae system is well suited for the fast and reliable generation of in vivo pharmacokinetic data for extended release drug profiles, e.g. in context of regional drug absorption investigations. For immediate release pulses delivered in the distal GI tract this version of the device appears however less suitable.",

Penbutolol sulfate is a potent, noncardioselective beta-blocker, which is used for the management of hypertension. The drug is one of the most lipid soluble of the \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonists used clinically. It has an n-octanol/pH 7.4 buffer partition coefficient of 179 compared to a value of 22 for propranolol. The amount of penbutolol sulfate transported across the skin is low. In this project, we studied the effect of sonophoresis and chemical penetration enhancers on transdermal delivery of penbutolol sulfate. Low-frequency sonophoresis at a frequency of 20\u2009kHz increased transcutaneous flux of penbutolol sulfate by 3.5-fold (27.37\u2009\u00b1\u2009\u03bcg\u2009cm(-2)\u2009h(-1)) compared to passive delivery (7.82\u2009\u00b1\u20091.72\u2009\u03bcg\u2009cm(-2)\u2009h(-1)).

    "152": "Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a progressive retinal dystrophy that causes visual impairment and eventual blindness. Retinal prostheses are the best currently available vision-restoring treatment for RP, but only restore crude vision. One possible contributing factor to the poor quality of vision achieved with prosthetic devices is the pathological retinal ganglion cell (RGC) hyperactivity that occurs in photoreceptor dystrophic disorders. Gap junction blockade with meclofenamic acid (MFA) was recently shown to diminish RGC hyperactivity and improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of RGC responses to light flashes and electrical stimulation in the rd10 mouse model of RP. We sought to extend these results to spatiotemporally patterned optogenetic stimulation in the faster-degenerating rd1 model and compare the effectiveness of a number of drugs known to disrupt rd1 hyperactivity. We crossed rd1 mice with a transgenic mouse line expressing the light-sensitive cation channel channelrhodopsin2 (ChR2) in RGCs, allowing them to be stimulated directly using high-intensity blue light. We used 60-channel ITO multielectrode arrays to record ChR2-mediated RGC responses from wholemount, ex-vivo retinas to full-field and patterned stimuli before and after application of MFA, 18-\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid (18BGA, another gap junction blocker) or flupirtine (Flu, a Kv7 potassium channel opener). All three drugs decreased spontaneous RGC firing, but 18BGA and Flu also decreased the sensitivity of RGCs to optogenetic stimulation. Nevertheless, all three drugs improved the SNR of ChR2-mediated responses. MFA also made it easier to discern motion direction of a moving bar from RGC population responses. Our results support the hypothesis that reduction of pathological RGC spontaneous activity characteristic in retinal degenerative disorders may improve the quality of visual responses in retinal prostheses and they provide insights into how best to achieve this for optogenetic prostheses.",

    "173": "Atenolol is a \u03b2-blocker widely used in the treatment of hypertension. Atenolol is cleared predominantly by the kidney by both glomerular filtration and active secretion, but the molecular mechanisms involved in its renal secretion are unclear. Using a panel of human embryonic kidney cell lines stably expressing human organic cation transporter (hOCT) 1-3, human organic anion transporter (hOAT) 1, hOAT3, human multidrug and toxin extrusion protein (hMATE) 1, and hMATE2-K, we found that atenolol interacted with both organic cation and anion transporters. However, it is transported by hOCT1, hOCT2, hMATE1, and hMATE2-K, but not by hOCT3, hOAT1, and hOAT3. A detailed kinetic analysis coupled with absolute quantification of membrane transporter proteins by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry revealed that atenolol is an excellent substrate for the renal transporters hOCT2, hMATE1, and hMATE2-K.

To demonstrate unidirectional transepithelial transport of atenolol, we developed and functionally validated a hOCT2/hMATE1 double-transfected Madin-Darby canine kidney cell culture model. Transwell studies showed that atenolol transport in the basal (B)-to-apical (A) direction is 27-fold higher than in the A-to-B direction, whereas its B-to-A/A-to-B transport ratio was only 2 in the vector-transfected control cells. The overall permeability of atenolol in the B-to-A direction in hOCT2/hMATE1 cells was 44-fold higher than in control cells.

    "177": "Norepinephrine (NE) is a key modulator of synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, a brain structure crucially involved in memory formation. NE boosts synaptic plasticity mostly through initiation of signaling cascades downstream from beta (\u03b2)-adrenergic receptors (\u03b2-ARs). Previous studies demonstrated that a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor agonist, isoproterenol, can modify the threshold for long-term potentiation (LTP), a putative cellular mechanism for learning and memory, in a process known as \"metaplasticity.\" Metaplasticity is the ability of synaptic plasticity to be modified by prior experience. We asked whether NE itself could engage metaplastic mechanisms in area CA1 of mouse hippocampal slices. Using extracellular field potential recording and stimulation, we show that application of NE (10 \u00b5M), which did not alter basal synaptic strength, enhances the future maintenance of LTP elicited by subthreshold, high-frequency stimulation (HFS: 1 \u00d7 100 Hz, 1 sec). HFS applied 30 min after NE washout induced long-lasting (>4 h) LTP, which was significantly extended in duration relative to HFS alone. This NE-induced metaplasticity required \u03b21-AR activation, as coapplication of the \u03b21-receptor antagonist CGP-20712A (1 \u00b5M) attenuated maintenance of LTP. We also found that NE-mediated metaplasticity was translation- and transcription-dependent. Polysomal profiles of CA1 revealed increased translation rates for specific mRNAs during NE-induced metaplasticity. Thus, activation of \u03b2-ARs by NE primes synapses for future long-lasting plasticity on time scales extending beyond fast synaptic transmission; this may facilitate neural information processing and the subsequent formation of lasting memories.",

Recently, landiolol, an ultra-short acting \u03b21-selective antagonist, has been reported to be safe and useful for the treatment of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias with reduced left ventricular function. Here we report a case of advanced heart failure with severe hypotension who was treated successfully by landiolol for rapid AF. The patient was a 20-year old male with dilated cardiomyopathy. He presented with low output syndrome in spite of optimal medical therapy and was referred to our department to consider ventricular assist device implantation and heart transplantation. Soon after admission, he developed rapid atrial fibrillation at 180 beats per minute (bpm) followed by severe hypotension and liver enzyme elevation. Low dose landiolol at 2 \u03bcg/kg/minute was started because digoxin was not effective. After landiolol administration, his heart rate decreased to 110 bpm, and finally returned to sinus rhythm without hemodynamic deterioration. Intra-aortic balloon pumping was inserted soon after sinus recovery and he was discharged successfully with an implantable left ventricular assist device.", 
    "182": "The aim of this work was to assess the performance of resin as an ocular delivery system. Timolol maleate (TM) was chosen as the model drug and an ion exchange resin (IER) as the carrier. The drug-resin complex was prepared using an oscillation method and then characterized regarding particle size, zeta potential, morphology, and drug content. After in vitro drug release study and corneal permeation study were performed, in vivo studies were performed in New Zealand albino rabbits using a suspension with particles sized 4.8 \u00b1 1.2 \u03bcm and drug loading at 43.00 \u00b1 0.09%. The results indicate that drug released from the drug-resin ophthalmic suspension permeated the cornea and displayed a sustained-release behavior. Drug levels in the ocular tissues after administration of the drug-resin ophthalmic suspension were significantly higher than after treatment with an eye drop formulation but were lower in body tissues and in the plasma. In conclusion, resins have great potential as effective ocular drug delivery carriers to increase ocular bioavailability of timolol while simultaneously reducing systemic drug absorption.", 
    "183": "Social defeat occurs when an animal is attacked and subjugated by an aggressive conspecific. Following social defeat, male Syrian hamsters fail to display species-typical territorial aggression and instead exhibit submissive or defensive behaviors even when in the presence of a non-aggressive intruder. We have termed this phenomenon conditioned defeat (CD). The mechanisms underlying CD are not fully understood, but data from our lab suggest that at least some of the mechanisms are similar to those that mediate classical fear conditioning. The goal of the present experiment was to test the hypothesis that noradrenergic signaling promotes the consolidation of CD, as in classical fear conditioning, by determining whether CD is disrupted by post-training blockade of noradrenergic activity. In Experiment 1, we determined whether systemic infusions of the noradrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol (0, 1.0, 10, or 20mg/kg) given immediately after a 15 min defeat by a resident aggressor would impair CD tested 48 h later. Hamsters that were given immediate post-training infusions of propranolol (1.0, but not 10 or 20mg/kg) showed significantly less submissive behavior than did those given vehicle infusions supporting the hypothesis that there is noradrenergic modulation of the consolidation of a social defeat experience. In Experiment 2, we demonstrated that propranolol (1.0mg/kg) given immediately, but not 4 or 24h, after defeat impaired CD tested 48 h after defeat indicating that the window within which the memory for social defeat is susceptible to beta-adrenergic modulation is temporary. In Experiment 3, we examined whether central blockade of noradrenergic receptors could recapitulate the effect of systemic injections by giving an intracerebroventricular infusion of propranolol immediately after defeat and examining the effect on CD 24h later. Centrally administered propranolol (20 \u03bcg/3 \u03bcl but not 2 \u03bcg/3 \u03bcl) was also effective in dose-dependently reducing consolidation of CD. Collectively, the present results indicate that noradrenergic activity promotes the consolidation of CD and suggest that CD is a valuable model to study the processes by which emotion and stress modulate memory in an ethologically relevant context. These data also suggest that the popular conception in the clinical literature that the anxiolytic effect of propranolol is primarily due to the drug's peripheral effects may need to be reconsidered.",

He was known to have paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which did not respond to initial beta-blocker treatment. The second-line drug amiodarone was given to the patient for rate control.

    "187": "Multiple prior studies have suggested an association between survival and beta-blocker administration in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, it is unknown whether this benefit of beta-blockers is dependent on heart rate control. The aim of this study was to assess whether rate control affects survival in patients receiving metoprolol with severe TBI. Our hypothesis was that improved survival from beta-blockade would be associated with a reduction in heart rate.", 
    "188": "We performed a 7-y retrospective analysis of all blunt TBI patients at a level-1 trauma center. Patients aged >16 y with head abbreviated injury scale 4 or 5, admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) from the operating room or emergency room (ER), were included. Patients were stratified into two groups: metoprolol and no beta-blockers. Using propensity score matching, we matched the patients in two groups in a 1:1 ratio controlling for age, gender, race, admission vital signs, Glasgow coma scale, injury severity score, mean heart rate monitored during ICU admission, and standard deviation of heart rate during the ICU admission. Our primary outcome measure was mortality.", 
    "189": "A total of 914 patients met our inclusion criteria, of whom 189 received beta-blockers. A propensity-matched cohort of 356 patients (178: metoprolol and 178: no beta-blockers) was created. Patients receiving metoprolol had higher survival than those patients who did not receive beta-blockers (78% versus 68%; P = 0.04); however, there was no difference in the mean heart rate (89.9 \u00b1 13.9 versus 89.9 \u00b1 15; P = 0.99). Nor was there a difference in the mean of standard deviation of the heart rates (14.7 \u00b1 6.3 versus 14.4 \u00b1 6.5; P = 0.65) between the two groups. In Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, patients who received metoprolol had a survival advantage (P = 0.011) compared with patients who did not receive any beta-blockers.", 
    "190": "Our study shows an association with improved survival in patients with severe TBI receiving metoprolol, and this effect appears to be independent of any reduction in heart rate. We suggest that beta-blockers should be administered to all severe TBI patients irregardless of any perceived beta-blockade effect on heart rate.", 
    "191": "Changing living conditions, which lead to physical inactivity and obesity, are probably the main reason for the establishment of risk factors for cardiovascular diseases in children and adolescents. In the past those risk factors were typically seen only in the elderly. On long-term, the elevated body-mass-index is a very important risk factor for primary arterial hypertension in children and adolescents, because it is responsible for both structural and functional changes in the cardiovascular system. Regular screening for these target organ damages is necessary. However, the role of newer methods has still to be proven in current research. The primary therapeutical options for this group are life style interventions like body weight control and physical activity. Children and adolescents with arterial hypertension persisting despite life style interventions should receive medication early, in order to prevent persistent target organ damage. Drug therapy should start as mono therapy--depending on patient profile--with one ACE inhibitor, angiotensin II receptor antagonist, calcium channel blocker or beta-blocker. If blood pressure cannot be reduced into the target area by mono therapy, combination therapy with different mechanisms should be started. Forms of secondary arterial hypertension have to be treated according to the primary disease.", 
    "192": "The concomitant presence of systemic arterial hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is frequent. Indeed, arterial hypertension is the most common comorbid disease in COPD patients. Since many antihypertensive drugs can act on airway function the treatment of arterial hypertension in COPD patients appears complex. Moreover, in these patients, a combined therapy is required for the adequate control of blood pressure. Currently, available data are inconsistent and not always comparable. Therefore the aim of this review is to analyze how antihypertensive drugs can affect airway function in order to improve the clinical management of hypertensive patients with COPD. Thiazide diuretics and calcium channel blockers appear the first-choice pharmacological treatment for these patients.",

Plasma renin activity increased with valsartan (54%-73%) and decreased with nebivolol (51%-65%) and the combination treatment (17%-39%). Plasma aldosterone decreased with individual treatments (valsartan, 11%-22%; nebivolol, 20%-26%), with the largest reduction (35%) observed with maximum combination dose (20\u00a0mg nebivolol/320\u00a0mg valsartan). Baseline ln(plasma renin activity) correlated with the 8-week reductions in 24-hour systolic and diastolic BP following treatments with the combination (all doses combined, P\u00a0=\u00a0.003 and P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and nebivolol (both, P\u00a0<\u00a0.001), but not with valsartan. Baseline ln(aldosterone) correlated with 24-hour systolic and diastolic BP reductions following combination treatment only (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001 and P\u00a0=\u00a0.005). The implications of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system effects of this beta blocker-angiotensin receptor blocker combination should be explored further.", 
    "194": "Little is known about the benefits and risks of the long-term use of cardiovascular drugs. Evidence from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) rarely goes beyond a few years of follow-up, but patients are often given continuous treatment with multiple drugs well into old age. We focus on 4 commonly used cardiovascular drug classes: aspirin, statins, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors given to patients after myocardial infarction. However, the issues raised apply more broadly to all long-term medications across cardiovascular diseases and the whole of medicine. The evidence and limitations of RCTs are addressed, as well as current practice in pre-licensing trials, the increasing problems of polypharmacy (especially in the elderly), the lack of trial evidence for withdrawal of drugs, the role of regulatory authorities and other stakeholders in this challenging situation, and the potential educational solutions for the medical profession. We conclude with a set of recommendations on how to improve the situation of long-term drug use.", 
    "195": "This study was designed to examine the vasorelaxant effects of hexahydrocurcumin (HHC), one of the major natural metabolites of curcumin from Curcuma longa, on rat isolated aortic rings, and the underlying mechanisms. Isometric tension of the aortic rings was recorded using organ bath system. HHC (1 nM to 1 mM) relaxed the endothelium-intact aortic rings pre-contracted with PE and KCl in a concentration-dependent manner. Removal of the endothelium did not alter the effect of HHC-induced relaxation. In Ca(2+)-free Krebs solution, HHC significantly inhibited the CaCl2-induced contraction in high K(+) depolarized rings and suppressed the transient contraction induced by PE and caffeine in a concentration-dependent manner. HHC was also observed to relax phobal-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), an activator of protein kinase C (PKC), precontracted aortic rings in a concentration-dependent manner with EC50 values equivalent to 93.36 \u00b1 1.03 \u03bcM. In addition, pre-incubation with propranolol (a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor blocker) significantly attenuated the HHC-induced vasorelaxation. These results suggest that the vasorelaxant effect of HHC is mediated by the endothelium-independent pathway, probably because of the inhibition of extracellular Ca(2+) influx through voltage-operated Ca(2+) channels and receptor-operated Ca(2+) channels, the inhibition of Ca(2+) mobilization from intracellular stores, as well as inhibition of PKC-mediated Ca(2+)-independent contraction. Moreover, HHC produces vasorelaxant effects probably by stimulating the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor.",

    "197": "Patients with AF included in the Meta-analysis Global Group in Chronic Heart Failure (MAGGIC) meta-analysis were the main focus of this analysis (3259 patients from 17 studies). The outcome was all-cause mortality at 3 years. Heart rate was analysed as a categorical (tertiles; T1 \u226477 b.p.m., T2 78-98 b.p.m., T3 \u226598 b.p.m.) and continuous variable. Cox proportional hazard models were used to compare the risk of all-cause death between tertiles of baseline heart rate. Patients in the highest tertile were more often female, less likely to have an ischaemic aetiology or diabetes, had a lower ejection fraction but higher blood pressure and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class. Higher heart rate was associated with higher mortality in patients with sinus rhythm (SR) but not in those in AF. In patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HF-REF) and AF, death rates per 100 patient years were lowest in the highest heart rate tertile (T1 18.9 vs. T3 15.9) but this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.10). In patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (HF-PEF), death rates per 100 patient years were highest in the highest heart rate tertile (T1 14.6 vs. T3 16.0, P = 0.014). However, after adjustment for other important prognostic variables, higher heart rate was no longer associated with higher mortality in HF-PEF (or HF-REF).",
