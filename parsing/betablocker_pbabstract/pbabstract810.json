    "0": "The clinical behaviour of 90 patients on beta-blocking drugs for established coronary heart disease who were admitted to a coronary care unit with prolonged ischaemic myocardial pain was compared with that of 90 similar patients not on this therapy. Transmural myocardial infarction was confirmed in 30 of the patients on beta-blockers and in 62 controls. A diagnosis of myocardial necrosis without infarction was made in 20 patients on beta-blockers and in 14 controls. Coronary insufficiency was diagnosed in 40 patients on beta-blockers and in 14 controls. The incidence of simus bradycardia, hypotension, syncope, and radiological pulmonary oedema was similar in the two groups. Established beta-blockade, therefore, has not been shown to prejudice the outcome of patients with coronary heart disease admitted to hospital with prolonged ischaemic myocardial pain. On the contrary, it may protect some patients from the development of a myocardial infarction.", 
    "1": "Propafenon (SA 79, Fenoprain, Baxarytmon) is a new antiarrhythmic agent with \"quinidine-like\" localanaesthetic direct membrane and beta adrenergic blocking actions. The drug was given to 50 patients with various types of cardiac arrhythmias. The effective and compatible dose was 70-140 mg administered intravenously in 1 to 3 minutes. Therapeutic success was observed in ectopic beats and paroxysmal tachycardias of both atrial and ventricular origin. Propafenon is effective on the sinus node, the atrial wall and the atrioventricular muscle; the rate of sinus node and ectopic pacemakers is lowered. The atrioventricular and intraventricular conduction time may be increased. Within the therapeutic dose Propafenon has only minimal cardiodepressive activity. Propafenon should not be given in patients with severe heart failure, hypotension and shock and atrioventricular block.", 
    "2": "The treatment of two pregnant thyrotoxic patients with propranolol alone is discussed. One patient had a spontaneous remission during pregnancy wile taking propranolol. In the other patient treatment with propranolol allowed postponement of definitive therapy until after delivery, when the fetus was no longer at risk. There were no complications of therapy in either patient and both infants were normal. The use of propranolol in thyrotoxicosis is discussed and the pertinent literature is reviewed. Regional anesthesia is preferred over general anesthsia in patients taking propranolol. Patients taking propranolol who require general anesthesia for delivery should have continuous monitoring of electrocardiogram and central venous pressure. To this date no method of therapy has been free of fetal side effects. Surgical treatment is associated with occasional abortion or premature labor; antithyroid medication occasionally results in fetal goiter or cretinism.", 
    "3": "The hormone control of cyclic AMP-formation in isolated parenchymal liver cells from rats fed the carcinogen 2-acetylaminofluorene (0.025% for 4-8 weeks) was studied. The cells from the carcinogen-treated animals responded much more strongly to adrenergic agents than cells from control animals, while no significant difference was found for the glucagon effect. Of the adrenergic substances studied, the order of potency was isoprenalin larger than or equal to adrenalin larger than phhenylephrine; stimulation was blocked by propranolol, but not by phentolamine. The effects of supramaximal concentrations of isoprenalin and glucagon were not additive.", 
    "4": "CDP-diglyceride, an important metabolic intermediate in the biosynthesis of phospholipids, has been isolated for the first time from a mammalian tissue. The isolated material, labeled in incubations of intact rat pineal glands with 32P, [3H]cytidine, or [3H]CTP in the presence of DL-propranolol, was chromatographically identical with authentic CDP-diglyceride and was able to serve as phosphatidyl donor in the enzymatic synthesis of phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidyglycerol. It yielded the expected products upon enzymatic and chemical degradation. No dCDP-diglyceride was detected No radioactive CDP-diglyceride was detected following incubations in the absence of propranolol. Stimulation of CDP-diglyceride labeling from 32P1 occurred at propranolol concentrations between 0.03 and 1.0 mM. Net synthesis of the liponucleotide was shown. At 0.1 mM, propranolol incrased the incorporation of radioactivity into phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidic acid. When inositol (10 mM) and propranolol (0.1 mM) were both present, phosphatidylinositol labeling was further increased, wheas stimulation of phosphatidylglycerol and CPD-diglyceride labeling was abolished. Since CDP-diglyceride did not accumulate in the absence of the drug, its availability may normally be the limiting factor in phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylglycerol biosynthesis. When propranol is present, inositol may become limiting and thus may lead to the observed labeling pattern.", 
    "5": "By means of a standardized, single-level ergometric load of 1.5 watt/kg body weight, the effects of a new beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent bunitrolol (o-(2-hydroxy-3-tertiary butylamino)-propoxy)-benzonitrile) was compared with the well-known cardiovascular properties of practolol during an intraindividual therapeutic crossover trial after intravenous administration. In the absence of any side-effects, bunitrolol shows a higher degree of beta-adrenergic receptor bocking activity than practolol, with a distinct specificity towards myocardial receptors and very low cardiodepressive properties at rest. Bunitrolol caused a marked reduction (33%) in exercise-induced myocardial work effort, whilst practolol achieved a reduction of only 17% under equal conditions. Thus, the same physical work load is performed after bunitrolol more economically by decreasing both heart rate and blood pressure. The circulatory effects of an intravenous dose of 5 mg bunitrolol seems to be twice as effective as 10 mg practolol. This implies that beta-adrenergic receptor blockade by bunitrolol during work performance is four times as effective as practolol. The observed marked effect of bunitrolol on the diastolic blood pressure is discussed.", 
    "6": "The influence of beta-adrenergic blockade (160 mg per day of propranolol for four weeks) on plasma renin activity, plasma volume, and arterial pressure was explored in 20 patients with essential hypertension with hyper-reninemia from long-term diuretic therapy. In 15 of these patients renin activity remained elevated (range, 3.1 to 23.0 ng per milliliter). Plasma volume was unchanged in eight, increased in 11 and reduced in one. In 17 subjects mean arterial pressure decreased by more than 10 mm Hg, but these impressive reductions could not be explained by quantitative changes in either renin activity (r equals 0.1) or plasma volume (r equals 0.1). These data suggest that suppression of plasma renin activity by beta-adrenergic blockade is not attainable during diuretic therapy and is not the major factor responsible for the antihypertensive action of propranolol.", 
    "7": "This paper presents experience with the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension by means of a thiazide diuretic (cyclopenthiazide), a small dose of a beta adrenergic blocking agent (oxprenolol) and progressively increasing doses of a vasodilator (hydrallazine). Satisfactory control of blood pressure was achieved in 38 of 41 cases without the production of distressing effects. This treatment regime was acceptable to patients and appears more promising than other currently available methods for blood pressure control.", 
    "8": "Oxprenolol and hydrallazine in combination were found to be as effective as methyldopa in a trial in hypertensive patients. The drugs could be given in a twice-daily dosage and had a much higher degree of patient acceptance. The side effects of this drug combination were usually due to hydrallazine and were mild and short-lived, but did require the withdrawal of one patient from the trial. Hydrallazine should be used with caution in the treatment of patients with a history of myocardial lschaemia.", 
    "9": "Administration of the vasodilator agent, prazosin, in dosages from 3-0 to 7-5 mg per day, significantly reduced diastolic and systolic blood pressure in a group of 14 patients with mild or moderate hypertension. Nine of these patients had a lowering of diastolic blood pressure which was at least 10 mm Hg greater than that caused by placebo. Side effects, chiefly dizziness or lassitude, occurred in over half the patients, but were mild and of short duration and did not necessitate suspension of treatment. The antihypertensive effect of prazosin was similar to that produced by methyldopa or propranolol given in comparable doses. If prazosin and propranolol were given concurrently, blood pressure fell to a level which was significantly lower than that associated with the use of either of these agents alone.", 
    "10": "Vasodilator drugs play an important role in the treatment of hypertension in 1974. A powerful vasodilator such as diazoxide may be necessary in the control of the most severely affected patients. It should not be forgotten that drugs of the benzothiadiazine group probably act mainly as vasodilators and that their effect is not dependent upon natriuresis and diuresis. New vasodilators such as minoxidil may have an important role in the treatment of hypertension, but these have not yet been adequately assessed in Australia. Both hydrallazine and prazosin produce a significant fall in the blood pressure when added to a combination of a beta blocker and a diuretic, and double-blind studies have shown that the side effects are more predominant with hydrallazine than with prazosin.", 
    "11": "Drugs which lower arterial blood pressure by direct vasodilator action usually have to be combined with beta adrenergic blocking drugs and diuretics for maximum clinical effectiveness. Appreciation of the pharmacodynamic interactions is necessary to individualize drug programmes rationally. Vasodilator drug therapy is remarkable for the lack of side effects such as central nervous system effects, postural hypotension and sexual difficulties which usually characterize most \"antiadrenergic\" drug regiments.", 
    "12": "In a double-blind controlled trial lasting 12 months, long-term practolol therapy had no significant effect on plasma-lipid concentrations in twenty patients who had had acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "13": "Identical twin brothers with premature coronary artery disease are described. Repeat selective cine-coronary arteriograms were performed in this unique twin model and demonstrated a close similarity in location and extent of atherosclerotic lesions.", 
    "14": "Acebutolol (M & B 17,803 A), a new cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocking agent, was given intravenously to 20 selected patients with various cardiac arrhythmias. Cumulative doses ranging from 12.5 to 50 mg were moderately or highly effective in 4 out of 4 patients with sinus tachycardia, 2 out of 3 patients with premature atrial beats, 3 out of 4 patients with premature ventricular beats, 3 out of 5 patients with atrial fibrillation (one was converted to sinus rhythm) and in 2 out of 3 patients with atrial flutter. The drug was ineffective in one patient with atrial tachycardia. Mild systolic hypotension occured in two patients with recent myocardial infarction and there was some aggravation of a preexisting bronchospasm in a patient with congestive heart failure secondary to hyper-thyroidism. It was concluded that acebutolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker which by intravenous route may be useful in the treatment of selected cardiac arrhythmias.", 
    "15": "The effect of propranolol on adrenaline- and insulin-induced changes in blood glucose pyruvate, lactate, phosphorus and potassium were examined in 29 apparently healthy volunteers. A slight, but significant reduction in adrenaline-induced hyperglycaemia was noted, along with suppression of both the increase in pyruvate and lactate and the decrease in phosphorus and potassium attributable to this catecholamine. There was no significant change in the blood glucose curve after insulin whereas insulin-induced increases in pyruvate and lactate were reduced by 44% +/- 17.7 (mean +/- SEM) and 78% +/- 5.4 respectively, and the fall in phosphorus by 48% +/- 3.1; the decrease in potassium, however, was not significantly modified. These findings suggest that changes in plasma pyruvate, lactate and inorganic phosphates induced by insulin, and regarded as espressions of its peripheral metabolism, are greatly dependent on the beta-adrenergic effect of the endogenous catecholamines released during the time when blood glucose values are low.", 
    "16": "A significant protection against the lethal effects of hypobaric and isobaric hypoxia is observed in mice treated with propranolol. Previous acclimatization to chronic hypoxia does not introduce variations on this protective effect of the beta adrenergic blocking drugs. Similar effects were found using histotoxic anoxia provoked by sodium azide administration. A significative reduction of body temperature is observed under the effects of the blockaders. These findings suggest a reduced need of oxygen in the treated animals. Neutralization of the effects of epinephrine released as a consequence of the hypoxic stress is proposed as the protection mechanism.", 
    "17": "During development the total mass of collagen increases to the same degree in each ventricle independently of the mass of muscle. At birth the concentration of collagen is the same in each ventricle. Thereafter a greater quantity of muscle is developed in the left ventricle than in the right ventricle, so that the concentration of collagen in the right ventricle comes to exceed that in the left. In the mature rabbit the concentration of collagen is higher in the atria than in the ventricles, higher in the right ventricle than in the left ventricle, and higher in the epicardium than in the endocardium. Beta blockade has no effect on the content of myocardial collagen.", 
    "18": "Experimental thyrotoxicosis was produced in guinea pigs by daily intraperitoneal injection of 0.7 mg/kg thyroxine (T4) or 0.15 mg/kg triiodothyronine (T3), as shown by an increase of PBI over 50 gamma percent, weight reduction of 20--30 percent, and increase in heart rate of 30--50 percent. Control animals received solvent only. Metabolites were determined in heart muscle on the 1st, 3rd, and 7th day using freeze-stop technique and enzymatic methods: creatine phosphate (CP), ATP, ADP, AMP, glucose 6-phosphate (G-6-P), fructose diphosphate (FDP), pyruvate, lactate, and inorganic phosphate (Pi). In thyrotoxic animals there was a decrease in CP which became significant after 3 days and more pronounced after 7 days. The ratio of CP to Pi decreased. G-6-P and FDP levels increased. The results were identical after administration of T4 and T3. ATP decreased slightly and ADP increased slightly after T4. Propranolol up to a dose of 3 mg/kg or practolol up to 10 mg/kg given daily i.p. on the 4th to 7th day did not prevent either the T4-induced decrease in high energy phosphates or the increase in G-6-P.", 
    "19": "The effects of the mixed agonist epinephrine and the beta agonist isoproterenol, each alone and in combination with the alpha adrenergic blocker phentolamine and the beta blocker propranolol on the adenylate cyclase activity of human adipocyte membrane fragments were determined in a calcium free buffer. Neither phentolamine (10 muM) nor propranolol (32 muM) affected basal adenylate cyclase activity. Epinephrine (10 muM) stimulated adenylate cyclase activity and this effect was slightly enhanced by phentolamine. The combination of epinephrine plus propranolol depressed adenylate cyclase below the basal level. Isoproterenol (10 muM) markedly stimulated adenylate cyclase; the addition of phentolamine caused an equivocal further increase while the addition of propranolol depressed adenylate cyclase activity to, but not below, the basal level. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that human adipocytes have both alpha and beta adrenergic receptors and that these receptors are associated with the cell membrane adenylate cyclase system.", 
    "20": "In a study of patients with angina pectoris the influence of coronary-effective medicaments on the concentration of non-esterified fatty acids was investigated. Supplementary establishments were carried out experimentally on pigs. Compared with normal persons patients with angina pectoris had a significantly higher level of non-esterified fatty acids. In an oral dose of 150 mg a day propranolol decreased the non-esterified fatty acids to normal values. Dipyridamol decreased the concentration of non-esterified fatty acids in the serum in an average dose of 450 mg a day also significantly. The combination of propranolol and dipyridamol did not evoke a particular additive effect on the decrease of non-esterified fatty acids. In a dosage of 300 mg a day orally trapymin had no clear influence on the non-esterified fatty acids. D,L-oxyfedrin (64 mg orally a day) increased the concentration of the non-esterified fatty acids in the serum. The decrease of the level of non-esterified fatty acids seems important for the prophylaxis of the infarction. The antilipolytic effect is a desirable therapeutic mechanism among others in the coronary therapy.", 
    "21": "Alpha blockade at a dose which produces minimal cardiovascular effects causes a significant fall in the urethral pressure profile in man. No change in profile height has been seen following the administration of a beta blocking drug in a dose producing cardiovascular changes of a similar order of magnitude.", 
    "22": "Five patients with mild to moderate asthma were studied after an intravenous saline control followed by atenolol (i.v. 7-9mg) and propranolol (i.v. 0.2-1.0 mg) in a body plethysmograph. Following propranolol, heart rate did not change but specific airway conductance dropped with 65% and airway resistance increased with 130%. Following atenolol, there was a dose-related decrease in heart rate (25% after 9 mg i.v.) and a slight but not significant tendency to a decrease in airway conductance on the highest doses. None of the patients experienced any change in symptoms after administration of atenolol but after propranolol two patients had worsened symptoms. It is concluded that, in contrast to propranolol, atenolol blocks the beta-receptors in the heart preferentially to those in the lungs, and thus could be given to patients with obstructive lung disease.", 
    "23": "The pharmacokinetics of practolol were studied after intravenous injection (5 mg/kg) in conscious normal rabbits and rabbits with experimental glomerulonephritis induced by daily intravenous injection of bovine gamma-globulin. The results obtained demonstrated that the practolol elimination was impaired in animals with experimental glomerulonephritis: significant lengthening of the half-life of the beta-phase, with marked decrease of the body clearance and diminution of the drug concentration decrease in plasma. Neither conjugates nor deacetylpractolol could be detected in the urine of the controls or immunized rabbits.", 
    "24": "Amitriptyline and nortriptyline in doses higher than 0.5 mg/kg exert a hypotensive action, and doses of less than 0-5 mg/kg have no characteristic effect on blood pressure. Both drugs diminished amplitude of cardiac contractions in situ in experimental animals. Low doses increased frequency and amplitude of respirations, and higher doses paralyzed respiratory function. Animals died as a result of paralysis of the respiratory center. In decapitated animals both drugs exhibited activity similar to that in animals with intact central nervous system, but their hypotensive effect was less pronounced. Blockade of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems and of vegetative ganglia had no influence on the action of amitriptyline and nortriptyline on blood pressure. In low doses both amitriptyline and nortriptyline potentiated, and in high doses weakened the hypertensive effect of noradrenaline.", 
    "25": "Imipramine exerts various, dose-related, effects on arterial blood pressure. A distinct hypotensive effect occurs at dosses of at least 0-5 mg/kg body weight. At lower dosage, the action of the drug is biphasic. In experiments in situ with animals, imipramine diminished amplitude of the heart's contractions. Controlled respiration during experiments with imipramine reduced its toxicity. In decapitated animals the action of imipramine was the same as in animals with intact central nervous system. At all dosage levels its effect on blood pressure was biphasic. Blockade of the sympathetic, parasympathetic system and vegetative ganglia had no significant effect on the circulatory response to imipramine. Low doses of imipramine potentiated the hypertensive effect of noradrenaline, and high doses weakened it.", 
    "26": "The action of propranolol, a Beta-blocking adrenergic agent, on mitochondrial proton fluxes in nonenergized and energized conditions has been studied. 1. The drug inhibited the actions of valinomycin, higericin and FCCP on the inner mitochondrial membrane. 2. It decreased the rate and extent of active energized proton expulsion and passive collapse of the proton gradient so formed. 3. Propranolol was able to increase the permeation of chloride ion through the inner mitochondrial membrane in nonenergized and energized conditions. 4. The drug inhibited mitochondrial contraction but stimulated swelling in various conditions. It is suggested that propranolol is is able to change the proton and chloride permeabilities of mitochondria by perturbing the structure of inner membrane phospholipids, thus enlarging the water-lipid interface.", 
    "27": "Glycogen is an essential substrate during myocardial anoxia. Since porpranolol may maintain myocardial glycogen levels after acute stress by blockade of catecholamine-induced glycogenolysis, we evaluated the effect of propranolol treatment in the isolated perfused isovolumic paced rat heart. Forty-one rats were studied after 10 min of ice-water immersion: half were pretreated with propranolol, 20 mg/kg/day x3, and half with saline. Glycogen content of unperfused propranolol-treated hearts exceeded controls by 46% (146 +/- 9 vs. 100 +/- 4 mumoles/g dry wt, p less than 0.02), and this difference persisted during aerobic perfusion. Propranolol did not affect adenine nucleotide concentration or left ventricular hemodynamics. Following 5 min of anoxic perfusion, propranolol hearts showed improved ventricular performance concomitant with enhanced glycogenolytic flux and lactate production. Propranolol augmented high energy phosphate production (ATP/AMP = 5.19 +/- 0.42 vs. 3.39 +/- 0.42, p less than 0.02) and increased coronary flow (22.1 +/- 1.6 vs. 16.6 +/- 1.4 ml/min, p less than 0.02) during anoxia. Thus, propranolol supported glycogen stores following acute stresses, enhanced glycogenolytic energy production, increased coronary flow, and improved ventricular function during subsequent anoxia.", 
    "28": "A low frequency stimulation of the head of the caudate nucleus in freely moving cats leads to an arrest of reactions with an increased muscular tone and tremor. This reaction may serve as an experimental model of one of the expressions of parkinsonism, inasmuch as its accomplishment depends upon the central dopaminergic mechanisms (confirmed on experiments with disulfiram and alpha-methyltyrosine). The similarity is also supplemented by the fact that the arrested reaction is weakened by antiparkinson drugs (d, 1-amphetamine, DOPA, artane) and is increased by neuroeptical preparation (aminazine, haloperidol, reserpine).", 
    "29": "In earlier reports from this laboratory, it was shown that 3 weeks' pretreatment with desoxycorticosterone acetate (DCA) pellet implantation and saline as drinking fluid caused a nearly 20,000-fold potentiation of the acute cardiotoxicity of isoproterenol. In such animals, the beta-receptor stimulant consistently elicited severe ventricular dysrhythmias, usually leading to ventricular fibrillation (VF) and death. In the present study, a similar enhancement of isoproterenol arrhythmogenic activity after DCA-saline pretreatment was demonstrated also in the guinea pig and albino mouse. It was found, further, that isoproterenol consistently caused an alteration of the total myocardial electrolyte content in DCA-saline-treated rats, consisting of a decrease of magnesium (Mg) and potassium (K) levels and elevation of sodium (Na). In control rats, on the other hand, isoproterenol did not alter the myocardial Mg content and increased K. The emertence of cardiac irregularities and VF could be inhibited by pretreatment with antiarrhythmic drugs. On a molar basis, these agents decreased the incidence of VF in the following descending order: dl-propranolol (100), practolol (39), d-propranolol (34), sotalol (20), quinidine (8), and lidocaine (5). In the presence of any of the listed drugs, except for lidocaine, isoproterenol did not lower Mg levels and had variable effects on those of Na and K. Pretreatment with Mg gluconate was likewise effective in preventing isoproterenol-induced dysrhythmias and death. These findings demonstrate that: a) sensitization of the myocardium by DCA-saline treatment is not species-specific for the rat; b) this phenomenon can be a useful method for the screening of antiarrhythmic drugs; and c) isoproterenol-induced dysrhythmias may be associated with myocardial electrolyte alterations involving especially Mg depletion.", 
    "30": "The present study was designed to examine the relationship between epinephrine secreted from the adrenal medulla and acute occlusion of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery in alpha-chloralone-anesthetized cats. Occlusion of the LAD artery produced arrhythmia in all of the animals, with 39% developing ventricular fibrillation (VF). Epinephrine content in the adrenal venous blood increased 5-fold immediately after occlusion and was associated with the development of arrhythmia and VF. The adrenal venous epinephrine levels increased 8-fold after occlusion in the animals that developed VF while, in those that did not develop VF, the epinephrine levels increased only 1.5-fold. Bilateral ligation of the adrenal veins 1 hour prior to occlusion of the LAD artery did not alter the pattern of development of arrhythmia but prevented the occurrence of VF. Pretreatment of animals with either practolol or sotalol 15 min prior to LAD artery occlusion also did not affect the occurrence of arrhythmia but prevented the incidence of VF. The data indicate that acute occlusion of the LAD coronary artery produces a sharp rise in epinephrine from the adrenal medulla and that epinephrine is a major factor in producing VF but does not seem to be involved to any great extent in the production of less ominous ventricular arrhythmias.", 
    "31": "Bilateral superior cervical ganglionectomy or exposure of rats to light for 10 days resulted in comparable increases in microtubule protein content in the hypothalamus. Administration of norepinephrine, L-dopa or isoproterenol decreased hypothalamic tubulin levels to a greater extent in ganglionectomized rats. A prior injection of phentolamine prevented norepinphrine's effects in intact rats and decreased but did not abolish the effect of the catecholamine in ganglionectomized animals. Phentolamine impaired L-dopa activity in intact and denervated rats as did propranolol; beta-adrenergic blockage impaired the effect of norepinephrine in denervated rats and abolished that of isoproterenol. Phentolamine plus propranolol prevented norepinephrine's effects whereas it only impaired L-dopa activity on hypothalamic tubulin content. The prior administration of actinomycin D blocked the effects of norepinephrine, L-dopa or isoproterenol. Pinealectomy abolished the isoproterenol-induced decrease in microtubule protein content and impaired that following L-dopa. These data suggest that tubulin levels of the rat hypothalamus are controlled by adrenergic transmitter via alpha- and beta-receptors, the latter involving the pineal gland.", 
    "32": "In ten normal subjects the effect of propranolol on serum gastrin concentration and HC1 secretion during insulin hypoglycemia (0.2 U/kg) was studied. Under the influence of propranolol (50 mug/kg intravenously in 3 min) the gastrin response to insulin was abolished. The insulin-induced HC1 secretion was reduced by propranolol from 38 to 18 mEq/2h (p less than 0.01). These results are compatible with the hypothesis of beta-adrenergic stimulation on serum gastrin concentration and HC1 secretion during insulin hypoglycemia.", 
    "33": "Results of combined treatment with low doses of steroids (50-10-5 mg) and Visken (7.5-15 mg) in 5 cases of pemphigus erythematosus and 5 cases of pemphigus vulgaris are presented. Treatment lasted from 30 days to 1.5 years. Some of the patients had been previously treated with steroids and immunosuppressive drugs, but had active lesions or frequent recurrences. In pemphigus erythematosus, very good results were obtained in 3 of 5 cases, and failure in 2 cases was probably related to insufficient dosage of steroids, or no treatment with steroids at all. In pemphigus vulgaris results were not satisfactory. Visken can serve as a supplementary drug in the treatment of pemphigus erythematosus. No complications were observed, and the drug may be regarded as safe.", 
    "34": "After a run-in period practolol was given in the dose of 100 mg twice daily to 29 patients with chronic bronchial asthma on the indication hypertension (12) and supraventricular arrhythmia (17). During the run-in period, as well as during the practolol period, a long-acting beta2-stimulator, terbutaline, was given in the dose of 5 mg three times daily. Peak expiratory flow (PEF), heart rate and blood pressure were measured under standardized conditions. No change of the lung function was observed during practolol therapy. Systolic as well as diastolic blood pressure fell significantly. The heart rhythm was normalized in 15 of the arrhythmic subjects. No subjective worsening of the asthmatic symptoms or any other side effects were noted. It is suggested that practolol can be safely used in patients prone to bronchospasm, provided a long-acting beta2-stimulating drug is given concomitantly on the usual indications for beta blockers in acute situations.", 
    "35": "Dopamine exerts marked positive inotropic effects in the dog with no effect on heart rate. This effect is abolished by propranolol, reduced by reserpine, and unaffected by atropine. Dopamine exhibits similar inotropic activity in the normal guinea pig and in guinea pigs with experimentally induced heart failure. In the isolated perfused hamster heart, dopamine caused marked increases in left ventricular pressure with slight increases in heart rate. However, in the failing heart of the myopathic Syrian hamster, dopamine caused moderate increases in left ventricular pressure with much greater increases in heart rate. The total heart work of the failing heart under the influence of dopamine is significantly higher than that of the normal heart. The energy utilization under this condition is equal in both hearts. Therefore, the calculated efficiency of the failing heart treated with dopamine is much higher than that of the normal heart treated similarly.", 
    "36": "Beta-adrenergic blockade with 10 mg of propanolol had no significant effect upon the spontaneous gastric acid secretion, while the maximum (pentagastrin) acid secretion was depressed in healthy subjects and patients with duodenal ulcer. The gastrin response to food was significantly higher during beta-adrenergic blockade. It is suggested that a minor part of the maximum acid secretion may be due to activation of beta-receptors, while the gastrin response to food is probably not related to activation of beta-receptors.", 
    "37": "The importance of beta-adrenergic receptor activity for ulcer formation was studied. In rats fasted for 48 hours, ulcers in the rumen were produced constantly after 17 hours of pyloric ligation. d,1,Propranolol in doses of 1 to 30 mg/kg given 4 times during 12 hours caused a dose-dependent inhibition of ulcer formation. The ulcero-protective potency of d,1,propranolol was about 20 times that of d,propranolol. No explanation of the ulcero-protective effect was observed when the gastric acid secretion was studied after 17 hours. Serum gastrin concentration after 17 hours of ligation was in all animals less than 5 pmol per liter, i.e. below one-third of the normal fasting value. For all pharmacological effects apart from beta-adrenergic blockage, d,1, and d,propranolol do not differ, while the results presented here suggest that intact beta-adrenergic receptor activity is important for the development of gastric ulcers in the pylorus-ligated rat. The mechanism behind the ulcero-protective effect of beta-adrenergic blockage remains to be solved.", 
    "38": "The three phases of arrhythmias that develop within specific durations of occlusion of a coronary artery of the dog have been reviewed and characterized. The intravenous administration of practolol as described has virtually prevented the occurrence of arrhythmic activity during the first 7-8 hr after occlusion and kept the frequency at a much reduced level as compared with controls through 10 or 11 hr, but not appreciably longer. This means that first and second phase arrhythmias were almost abolished, and development of third phase ventricular tachycardia was significantly retarded, but not prevented. It is concluded that sympathetic stimulation is an important component in the effective excitation of ectopic activity during the first and second phases, but contributed no more than a minor component to the fully developed third phase activity."
