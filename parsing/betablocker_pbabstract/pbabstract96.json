The association between delirium and ADHF outcome has not been well described. We analyzed 883 consecutive patients >65 years of age admitted with ADHF. Acute delirium was diagnosed based on the Confusion Assessment Method. Delirious patients (total n = 151) had an increased in-hospital all-cause death compared to nondelirious patients (n = 17, 11%, vs n = 45, 6%; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.93, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07 to 3.48, p = 0.02).

Furthermore, delirium was strongly associated with 90-day all-cause mortality in patients discharged from the hospital (adjusted hazard ratio 2.10, CI 1.53 to 2.88, p <0.0001). In conclusion, acute delirium serves as an important prognostic determinant of in-hospital and posthospital discharge outcomes including increased ADHF readmission risk in older hospitalized patients with ADHF.

    "22": "\u03b2-adrenergic receptors (\u03b2-ARs) modulate cardiotoxicity/cardioprotection through crosstalk with multiple signaling pathways. We have previously shown that \u03b22-ARs are cardioprotective during exposure to oxidative stress induced by doxorubicin (DOX). DOX cardiotoxicity is mediated in part through a Ca(2+)-dependent opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), however the signals linking a cell surface receptor like the \u03b22-AR to regulators of mitochondrial function are not clear. The objective of this study was to assess mechanisms of crosstalk between \u03b22-ARs and mitochondrial cell death pathways. DOX administered to WT mice resulted in no acute mortality, however 85% of \u03b22-/- mice died within 30 min. Several pro- and anti-survival pathways were altered. The pro-survival kinase, \u03b5PKC, was decreased by 64% in \u03b22-/- after DOX vs WT (p<0.01); the \u03b5PKC activator \u03c8\u03b5RACK partially rescued these mice (47% reduction in mortality). Activity of the pro-survival kinase Akt decreased by 76% in \u03b22-/- after DOX vs WT (p<0.01). The \u03b11-antagonist prazosin restored Akt activity to normal and also partially reversed the mortality (45%). Deletion of the \u03b22-AR increased rate of Ca(2+) release by 75% and peak [Ca(2+)](i) by 20% respectively in isolated cardiomyocytes; the Ca(2+) channel blocker verapamil also partially rescued the \u03b22-/- (26%). Mitochondrial architecture was disrupted and complex I and II activities decreased by 40.9% and 34.6% respectively after DOX only in \u03b22-/-. The MPT blocker cyclosporine reduced DOX mortality by 41% and prazosin plus cyclosporine acted synergistically to decrease mortality by 85%. \u03b22-ARs activate pro-survival kinases and attenuate mitochondrial dysfunction during oxidative stress; absence of \u03b22-ARs enhances cardiotoxicity via negative regulation of survival kinases and enhancement of intracellular Ca(2+), thus predisposing the mitochondria to opening of the MPT.",

The mean difference was 0.11 mmHg. The 95% confidence interval was between -0.33 and 0.55 mmHg and thus entirely within the pre-defined equivalence range (+/- 1.5 mmHg). The results of the statistical evaluation of the secondary target parameter relative (as % of baseline) decrease in IOP 2 h post dose demonstrated essentially similar effectiveness in lowering the IOP by 27.63% (test formulation) and 27.12% (reference formulation), respectively.

Clenbuterol is lipophilic and may enter into the intracellular compartment, and because of this, it is likely that clenbuterol will have different effects to classical \u03b2(2)-adrenoceptor agonists such as terbutaline. The aim of the present study is to investigate clenbuterol's effect on force, intracellular [Ca(2+)] and electrophysiology, and the role of the \u03b2(2)-adrenoceptor pathway in these effects. 2. Simultaneous measurements of isometric force and [Ca(2+)](i) were made from small bundles of rat soleus muscle fibres in which several superficial fibres had been pressure-injected with the fluorescence Ca(2+) indicator Indo-1. The muscle's electrophysiological response was measured using glass intracellular microelectrodes. 3.\u2002The most robust effect of clenbuterol was a concentration- (10-50 \u03bcmol/L) and frequency-dependent (10-80 Hz) loss of force and [Ca(2+)](i) maintenance during tetanic stimulation of muscle fibres. None of these effects were reduced in the presence of the \u03b2(2)-antagonist ICI 118551. 4. In addition clenbuterol had a significant effect on muscle electrophysiology, with action potentials measured during tetanic trains being inhibited in a concentration- and frequency-dependent manner. This response was also unchanged by pre-treatment with the \u03b2(2)-antagonist ICI 118551. 5. These results indicate that some of clenbuterol's effects are mediated through a pathway other than the \u03b2(2)-adrenoceptors.",

In a double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial in about 10 000 patients with coronary artery disease and heart failure, ivabradine had no tangible efficacy. Treatment withdrawals were more frequent with ivabradine than in the placebo arms of these trials. Adverse effects included bradycardia and visual disorders.

To gain additional insight into the role of cAMP in the disturbed stimulus-secretion coupling within the diabetic \u03b2-cell, we examined more thoroughly the relationship between changes in islet cAMP concentration and insulin release in the GK/Par rat model of T2D. Basal cAMP content in GK/Par islets was significantly higher, whereas their basal insulin release was not significantly different from that of Wistar (W) islets. Even in the presence of IBMX or GLP-1, their insulin release did not significantly change despite further enhanced cAMP accumulation in both cases. The high basal cAMP level most likely reflects an increased cAMP generation in GK/Par compared with W islets since 1) forskolin dose-dependently induced an exaggerated cAMP accumulation; 2) adenylyl cyclase (AC)2, AC3, and G(s)\u03b1 proteins were overexpressed; 3) IBMX-activated cAMP accumulation was less efficient and PDE-3B and PDE-1C mRNA were decreased. Moreover, the GK/Par insulin release apparatus appears less sensitive to cAMP, since GK/Par islets released less insulin at submaximal cAMP levels and required five times more cAMP to reach a maximal secretion rate no longer different from W. GLP-1 was able to reactivate GK/Par insulin secretion so that GIIS became indistinguishable from that of W. The exaggerated cAMP production is instrumental, since GLP-1-induced GIIS reactivation was lost in the presence the AC blocker 2',5'-dideoxyadenosine. This GLP-1 effect takes place in the absence of any improvement of the [Ca(2+)](i) response and correlates with activation of the cAMP-dependent PKA-dependent pathway.",

    "47": "Carvedilol is one of the most effective beta blockers for preventing ventricular tachyarrhythmias in heart failure, but the mechanisms underlying its favorable antiarrhythmic benefits remain unclear. Spontaneous Ca(2+) waves, also called store overload-induced Ca(2+) release (SOICR), evoke ventricular tachyarrhythmias in individuals with heart failure. Here we show that carvedilol is the only beta blocker tested that effectively suppresses SOICR by directly reducing the open duration of the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2). This unique anti-SOICR activity of carvedilol, combined with its beta-blocking activity, probably contributes to its favorable antiarrhythmic effect. To enable optimal titration of carvedilol's actions as a beta blocker and as a suppressor of SOICR separately, we developed a new SOICR-inhibiting, minimally beta-blocking carvedilol analog, VK-II-86. VK-II-86 prevented stress-induced ventricular tachyarrhythmias in RyR2-mutant mice and did so more effectively when combined with either of the selective beta blockers metoprolol or bisoprolol. Combining SOICR inhibition with optimal beta blockade has the potential to provide antiarrhythmic therapy that can be tailored to individual patients.",

    "55": "There is abundant evidence suggesting the relevance of glutamate to depression and antidepressant mechanisms. Curcumin, a major active compound of Curcuma longa, has been reported to have the biological function of antidepressant. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of curcumin on endogenous glutamate release in nerve terminals of rat prefrontal cortex and the underlying mechanisms. The results showed that curcumin inhibited the release of glutamate that was evoked by exposing synaptosomes to the K(+) channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (4-AP). This phenomenon was blocked by the chelating the extracellular Ca(2+) ions, and by the vesicular transporter inhibitor bafilomycin A1, but was insensitive to the glutamate transporter inhibitor DL-threo-\u03b2-benzyl-oxyaspartate (DL-TBOA). Further experiments demonstrated that curcumin decreased depolarization-induced increase in [Ca(2+)](C), whereas it did not alter the resting membrane potential or 4-AP-mediated depolarization. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of curcumin on evoked glutamate release was prevented by blocking the Ca(v)2.2 (N-type) and Ca(v)2.1 (P/Q-type) channels, but not by blocking intracellular Ca(2+) release or Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange. These results suggest that curcumin inhibits evoked glutamate release from rat prefrontocortical synaptosomes by the suppression of presynaptic Ca(v)2.2 and Ca(v)2.1 channels. Additionally, we also found that the inhibitory effect of curcumin on 4-AP-evoked glutamate release was completely abolished by the clinically effective antidepressant fluoxetine. This suggests that curcumin and fluoxetine use a common intracellular mechanism to inhibit glutamate release from rat prefrontal cortex nerve terminals.",

The electrophysiological effects of the peptides on several types of voltage-dependent calcium channels were evaluated using a Xenopus laevis oocyte expression system. A peptide contained in one of the HPLC peak fractions inhibited P/Q type voltage-dependent calcium channels (Ca(v)2.1). The amino acid sequence of this peptide is identical to that of \u03c9-grammotoxin SIA. A peptide from another discrete peak, which is identical to GsAFII except for one tryptophan residue in the C-terminus, inhibited L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels (Ca(v)1.2). A novel peptide, named GTx1-15 (Accession number, AB201016), shows 76.5% sequence homology with the sodium channel blocker phrixotoxin 3, however, GTx1-15 preferentially inhibited T-type voltage-dependent calcium channels (Ca(v)3.1). In silico secondary and tertiary structure prediction revealed that GTx1-15 and sodium channel blockers such as hainantoxin-IV, phrixotoxin 3, and ceratotoxin 2 show very similar \u03b2-strand composition, distribution of Optimal Docking Areas (continuous surface patches likely to be involved in protein-protein interactions), and surface electrostatic potential. These findings suggest that these peptide toxins evolved from common ancestors by gene duplication to maintain surface atmospheres appropriate for interaction with low-voltage-dependent ion channels.",

Toxicological analysis of blood showed ethanol 2.42 g/L and propranolol 4.21 mg/L. The patient responded poorly to conventional therapy, so intravenous lipid emulsion was used. Apart from IV dopamine, the only treatment after the onset of wide complex tachycardia was 20% Intralipid.

    "71": "Since the development of coronary care units (CCUs), telemetry has rapidly become the standard of care in evaluating patients with suspected acute coronary syndromes, regardless of the probability for ischemia. However, there is no data to support this practice. Our objective was to evaluate the utility of routine cardiac monitoring in a chest pain observation unit. We prospectively studied the utility of routine cardiac monitoring in 249 consecutive patients admitted to an observation unit in an academic Emergency Department over a 6-month period. All the patients presented with chest pain thought to be cardiac ischemia. Observation included serial cardiac enzymes, ECG cardiac monitoring, and exercise testing in a designated chest pain observation unit. These patients were determined to be at low risk for an acute coronary event by two criteria: first, the symptoms had resolved by the time of observation unit admission, and second, the initial ECG was normal, unchanged or non-diagnostic for acute ischemia. Adverse outcomes included cardiac arrest, hospital admission secondary to cardiac dysrhythmia, or alteration in the patient's medical therapy upon discharge from the observation unit, secondary to cardiac dysrhythmia. There were 249 patients included with a median age of 52 with 60% women. Fifteen percent of the patients were, subsequently, admitted to the hospital for further evaluation of ischemia based on enzyme, ECG, and exercise testing results. One patient with known Tachy-Brady syndrome was noted to have 1.5-2 s pauses while sleeping, and discharged with instructions to hold beta blocker therapy pending results of a continuous loop recorder. Of the remaining 248 patients, no patient suffered a cardiac arrest, no patient was admitted to the hospital secondary to cardiac dysrhythmia, and no alteration in a patient's medical therapy was made secondary to cardiac dysrhythmia. No patient returned to the Emergency Department within 72 h with cardiac arrest, acute dysrhythmia or acute myocardial infarction. Although telemetry may be the standard of care in evaluating the patients with suspected acute coronary syndromes, regardless of the probability of an acute ischemic syndrome, in those patients with a normal or non diagnostic ECG and resolved symptoms, routine cardiac monitoring is unnecessary.",

Several treatment modalities have been documented, with variable degree of success. Propranolol has recently been reported to be an effective and safe alternative. The aim of this systematic review is to examine the evidence base for the use of propranolol administered orally in the management of periocular capillary haemangioma, and use this information to guide future research. A systematic review of literature was carried out by two independent reviewers using the search strategies highlighted below. A total of 100 cases of oral propranolol use in periorbital or orbital capillary haemangiomas have been documented in the literature. Of the 85 cases that had details of previous treatment, it was used as first-line treatment in 50 (58.8%). The commonest dose used was 2 mg/kg/day. Adverse events were documented in one-third of cases; in most cases these were minor. Improvement or complete resolution of the lesions occurred in 96% of cases. Recurrence was noted in one-fifth of cases. Propranolol has shown a lot of promise in the therapy of IH and further research in the form of properly designed randomized trials is certainly warranted. Treatment guidelines based on literature available to date is included in this review.", 
    "73": "There is a lack of high-quality evidence on what treatment should be used in children with properly characterised severe, therapy-resistant asthma. Data have to be largely extrapolated from trials in children with mild asthma, and adults with severe asthma. Therapeutic options can be divided into medications used in lower doses for children with less severe asthma, and those used in other paediatric diseases but not for asthma (for example, methotrexate). In the first category are high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (\u2264 2,000 \u03bcg \u00b7 day(-1) fluticasone equivalent), oral prednisolone, the anti-immunoglobulin (Ig)E antibody omalizumab, high-dose long-acting \u03b2(2)-agonists, low-dose oral theophylline and intramuscular triamcinolone. If peripheral airway inflammation is thought to be a problem, the use of fine-particle ICS or low-dose oral corticosteroids may be considered. More experimental therapies include oral macrolides, cyclosporin, cytotoxic drugs such as methotrexate and azathioprine, gold salts, intravenous infusions of Ig, subcutaneous \u03b2(2)-agonist treatment and, in those sensitised to fungi, oral antifungal therapy with itraconazole or voriconazole. Those with recurrent severe exacerbations, particularly in the context of good baseline asthma control, are particularly difficult to treat; baseline control and lung function must be optimised with the lowest possible dose of ICS, and allergen triggers and exposures minimised. The use of high-dose ICS, leukotriene receptor antagonists or both at the time of exacerbations can be considered. There is no evidence regarding which therapeutic option to recommend. Better evidence is required for all these treatment options, underscoring the need for the international and co-ordinated approach which we have previously advocated.", 
    "74": "Liver transplantation (LT) candidates today are increasingly older, have greater medical acuity, and have more cardiovascular comorbidities than ever before. Steadily rising model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) scores at the time of transplant, resulting from high organ demand, reflect the escalating risk profiles of LT candidates. In addition to advanced age and the presence of comorbidities, there are specific cardiovascular responses in cirrhosis that can be detrimental to the LT candidate. Patients with cirrhosis requiring LT usually demonstrate increased cardiac output and a compromised ventricular response to stress, a condition termed cirrhotic cardiomyopathy. These cardiac disturbances are likely mediated by decreased beta-agonist transduction, increased circulating inflammatory mediators with cardiodepressant properties, and repolarization changes. Low systemic vascular resistance and bradycardia are also commonly seen in cirrhosis and can be aggravated by beta-blocker use. These physiologic changes all contribute to the potential for cardiovascular complications, particularly with the altered hemodynamic stresses that LT patients face in the immediate post-operative period. Post-transplant reperfusion may result in cardiac death due to a multitude of causes, including arrhythmia, acute heart failure, and myocardial infarction. Recognizing the hemodynamic challenges encountered by LT patients in the perioperative period and how these responses can be exacerbated by underlying cardiac pathology is critical in developing recommendations for the pre-operative risk assessment and management of these patients. The following provides a review of the cardiovascular challenges in LT candidates, as well as evidence-based recommendations for their evaluation and management.", 
    "75": "Gastro-oesophageal variceal haemorrhage is one of the most dreadful complications of portal hypertension and can be controlled with vasoconstrictors. Nevertheless, sympathetic tone abnormality and vascular hyporesponsiveness in portal hypertension may impede the haemostatic effects of vasoconstrictors. Propranolol, a \u03b2-blocker binding the G-protein-coupled adrenoceptor, is a portal hypotensive agent. However, whether propranolol influences the collateral vasoresponse is unknown. Portal hypertension was induced by PVL (portal vein ligation) in Sprague-Dawley rats. In an acute study with an in situ perfusion model, the collateral responsiveness to AVP (arginine vasopressin) was evaluated with vehicle, propranolol (10 \u03bcmol/l), propranolol plus suramin (100 \u03bcmol/l, a G(\u03b1) inhibitor) or suramin pre-incubation. G(\u03b1) mRNA expression in the splenorenal shunt, the most prominent intra-abdominal collateral vessel, was measured. In the chronic study, rats received DW (distilled water) or propranolol (10 mg x kg(-1) of body weight x day(-1)) for 9 days. Then the concentration-response relationship of AVP and G(\u03b1) mRNA expression were assessed. Propranolol pre-incubation elevated the perfusion pressure changes of collaterals in response to AVP, which was inhibited by suramin. The splenorenal shunt G(\u03b1q) and G(\u03b111) mRNA expression were enhanced by propranolol. The group treated with propranolol plus suramin had a down-regulation of G(\u03b111) as compared with the propranolol group. Chronic propranolol treatment reduced mean arterial pressure, PP (portal pressure) and the perfusion pressure changes of collaterals to AVP. G(\u03b1s) expression was up-regulated. In conclusion, propranolol pre-incubation enhanced the portal-systemic collateral AVP responsiveness in portal hypertensive rats, which was related to G(\u03b1q) and G(\u03b111) up-regulation. In contrast, the attenuated AVP responsiveness by chronic propranolol treatment was related to G(\u03b1s) up-regulation. The G(\u03b1) signalling pathway may be a therapeutic target to control variceal bleeding and PP in portal hypertension.",

    "80": "This work proposes a simple and sensitive solid substrate-room temperature phosphorimetry (SS-RTP) for the selective determination of carvedilol (CV). The method is based on the sensitizing effect of sodium dodecyl benzene sulphonate (SDBS) on CV to activate the oxidation between NaClO and amaranth, resulting in the intense quenching of room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) of the system. Compared with non-SDBS system, the reduction of phosphorescence intensity (\u0394I(p)) with SDBS is 16.5 times higher and is directly proportional to the content of CV, covering a wide range 0.080-16.00 fg/spot. The regression equation of the working curve can be expressed as \u0394I(p) = 0.7780 + 7.057 m(CV) (fg/spot) (correlation coefficient (r) = 0.9976, n = 8), with a detection limit (LD) of 0.020 fg/spot (corresponding concentration is 5.1 \u00d7 10(-14) g/mL, sample volume is 0.40 \u03bcL/spot). This sensitive method has also been applied to determine trace CV in human plasma and the results agreed with synchronous fluorimetry (SF).

    "82": "We tested the hypothesis that long-term caffeine intake prevents the development of insulin resistance and hypertension in two pathological animal models: the high-fat (HF) and the high-sucrose (HSu) diet rat. We used six groups of animals: control; caffeine-treated (Caff; 1\u00a0g/l in drinking water during 15\u00a0d); HF; caffeine-treated HF (HFCaff); HSu; caffeine-treated HSu (HSuCaff). Insulin sensitivity was assessed using the insulin tolerance test. Blood pressure, weight gain, visceral fat, hepatic glutathione, plasma caffeine, insulin and NO, and serum NEFA and catecholamines were measured. Caffeine reversed insulin resistance and hypertension induced by both the HF and HSu diets. In the HF-fed animals caffeine treatment restored fasting insulin levels to control values and reversed increased weight gain and visceral fat mass. In the HSu group, caffeine reversed fasting hyperglycaemia and restored NEFA to control values. There were no changes either in plasma NO or in hepatic glutathione levels. In contrast, caffeine totally prevented the increase in serum catecholamines induced by HF and HSu diets. To test the hypothesis that inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system prevents the development of diet-induced insulin resistance we administered carvedilol, an antagonist of \u03b21, \u03b22 and also \u03b11 adrenoceptors, to HF and HSu rats. Carvedilol treatment fully prevented diet-induced insulin resistance and hypertension, mimicking the effect of caffeine. We concluded that long-term caffeine intake prevented the development of insulin resistance and hypertension in HF and HSu models and that this effect was related to a decrease in circulating catecholamines.", 
    "83": "Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is an approved treatment for epilepsy and depression and has cognition-enhancing effects in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The hippocampus is widely recognized to be related to epilepsy, depression, and Alzheimer's disease. One possible mechanism of VNS involves its effect on the hippocampus; i.e. it increases the release of noradrenaline in the hippocampus. However, the effect of VNS on synaptic transmission in the hippocampus is unknown. To determine whether VNS modulates neurotransmission in the hippocampus, we examined the effects of VNS on perforant path (PP)-CA3 synaptic transmission electrophysiologically in anaesthetized rats. VNS induces a persistent enhancement of PP-CA3 field excitatory post-synaptic potentials (fEPSPs). Arc, an immediate early gene, was used to identify active brain regions after VNS. The locus coeruleus (LC), which contains the perikarya of noradrenergic projections, harboured more Arc-positive cells, as measured by in-situ hybridization, after 10-min VNS. In addition, electrical lesions of LC neurons or intraventricular administration of the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist timolol prevented the enhancement of PP-CA3 responses by VNS. In conclusion, the protracted increase in PP-CA3 synaptic transmission that is induced by VNS entails activation of the LC and \u03b2-adrenergic receptors. Our novel findings suggest that information from the periphery modulates synaptic transmission in the CA3 region of the hippocampus.",

The effects of noradrenaline (NE) and ANG II on collagen III and elastin mRNA, and the receptor involved, were tested in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in vitro. Guanethidine increased collagen types I and III and decreased elastin, while losartan had an opposite effect, although without effect on collagen III. The combination of treatments abrogated changes induced by simple treatment with collagen I and elastin, but increased collagen III mRNA in AA and not in FA. NE stimulated collagen III mRNA via \u03b2 receptors and elastin via \u03b11 and \u03b12 receptors. ANG II stimulated collagen III but inhibited elastin mRNA via AT1R. Overall, SNS and ANG II exert opposite and antagonistic effects on major components of ECM in the vascular wall.

Hypertensive crisis occurred during the operation and she was sent to the intensive care unit for postoperative care. In the intensive care unit, cardiovascular collapse occurred after nonselective \u03b2-adrenergic blockade.

    "97": "Propanolol is a betablocker drug used in the treatment of arterial hypertension related diseases. In order to achieve an optimal performance of this drug it is important to consider the possible interactions of propanolol with plasma proteins. In this work, we have used several experimental techniques to characterise the effect of addition of the betablocker propanolol on the properties of bovine plasma fibrinogen (FB). Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), circular dichroism (CD), dynamic light scattering (DLS), surface tension techniques and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements have been combined to carry out a detailed physicochemical and surface characterization of the mixed system. As a result, DSC measurements show that propranolol can play two opposite roles, either acting as a structure stabilizer at low molar concentrations or as a structure destabilizer at higher concentrations, in different domains of fibrinogen. CD measurements have revealed that the effect of propanolol on the secondary structure of fibrinogen depends on the temperature and the drug concentration and the DLS analysis showed evidence for protein aggregation. Interestingly, surface tension measurements provided further evidence of the conformational change induced by propanolol on the secondary structure of FB by importantly increasing the surface tension of the system. Finally, AFM imaging of the fibrinogen system provided direct visualization of the protein structure in the presence of propanolol. Combination of these techniques has produced complementary information on the behavior of the mixed system, providing new insights into the structural properties of proteins with potential medical interest.", 
    "98": "Many drugs (e.g. amisulpride) have been used to treat troublesome clozapine-induced salivation; however, varying success has been achieved in this respect, probably because, until recently, the salivatory action of clozapine has been largely unexplained. In the rat, clozapine and its main metabolite, N-desmethylclozapine, were found to exert mixed secretory actions: excitatory, through muscarinic acetylcholine M1-receptors giving rise to a long-lasting, low-level flow of saliva; and inhibitory, through muscarinic M3-receptors and \u03b1(1) -adrenoceptors reducing the parasympathetically and sympathetically nerve-evoked flow of saliva. The aim of the present study was to define the interactions between clozapine and N-desmethylclozapine, and clozapine and amisulpride, with respect to the excitatory response. Submandibular glands, sensitized by chronic parasympathetic preganglionic denervation, were studied in pentobarbitone-anaesthetized rats. To prevent clozapine from being metabolized to N-desmethylclozapine by hepatic enzymes, the liver was, under terminal anaesthesia, excluded from the circulation. The weak receptor-stimulating clozapine prevented the strong receptor-stimulating N-desmethylclozapine, at specific ratios in humans and in rats, from exerting its full agonistic action. In conclusion, the contribution of N-desmethylclozapine to the clozapine-induced sialorrhoea was, at most, only partly additive. Furthermore, the present experimental set-up failed to demonstrate any anti-salivatory action of amisulpride on the clozapine-induced flow of saliva.", 
    "99": "We investigated how cystic fibrosis (CF) alters the relationship between Cl(-) and mucin secretion in cultures of non-CF and CF human tracheobronchial gland mucous (HTGM and CFTGM, respectively) cells. Biochemical studies showed that HTMG cells secreted typical airway mucins, and immunohistochemical studies showed that these cells expressed MUC1, MUC4, MUC5B, MUC8, MUC13, MUC16, and MUC20. Effects of cumulative doses of methacholine (MCh), phenylephrine (Phe), isoproterenol (Iso), and ATP on mucin and Cl(-) secretion were studied on HTGM and CFTGM cultures. Baseline mucin secretion was not significantly altered in CFTGM cells, and the increases in mucin secretion induced by mediators were unaltered (Iso, Phe) or slightly decreased (MCh, ATP). Across mediators, there was no correlation between the maximal increases in Cl(-) secretion and mucin secretion. In HTGM cells, the Cl(-) channel blocker, diphenylamine-2-carboxylic acid, greatly inhibited Cl(-) secretion but did not alter mucin release. In HTGM cells, mediators (10(-5) M) increased mucin secretion in the rank order ATP > Phe = Iso > MCh. They increased Cl(-) secretion in the sequence ATP > MCh \u2248 Iso > Phe. The responses in Cl(-) secretion to MCh, ATP, and Phe were unaltered by CF, but the response to Iso was greatly reduced. We conclude that mucin secretion by cultures of human tracheobronchial gland cells is independent of Cl(-) secretion, at baseline, and is unaltered in CF; that the ratio of Cl(-) secretion to mucus secretion varies markedly depending on mediator; and that secretions induced by stimulation of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors will be abnormally concentrated in CF.",

During waking and paradoxical sleep, EEG responses are characterized by low-amplitude, high-frequency oscillatory activity in the beta-gamma band range (~20-80 Hz). We have previously reported that gamma band activity may be intrinsically generated by the membrane electroresponsiveness of PPN neurons, and that the neuronal ensemble generates different patterns of gamma activity in response to specific transmitters. This study attempted to identify the voltage-gated calcium and potassium channels involved in the rising and falling phases of gamma oscillations in PPN neurons. We found that all rat (8-14 day) PPN cell types showed gamma oscillations in the presence of TTX and synaptic blockers when membrane potential was depolarized using current ramps. PPN neurons showed gamma oscillations when voltage-clamped at holding potentials above -30 mV, suggesting that their origin may be spatially located beyond voltage-clamp control. The average frequency for all PPN cell types was 23 \u00b1 1 Hz and this increased under carbachol (47 \u00b1 2 Hz; anova df = 64, t = 12.5, P < 0.001). The N-type calcium channel blocker \u03c9-conotoxin-GVIA partially reduced gamma oscillations, while the P/Q-type blocker \u03c9-agatoxin-IVA abolished them. Both \u03c9-CgTX and \u03c9-Aga blocked voltage-dependent calcium currents, by 56 and 52% respectively. The delayed rectifier-like potassium channel blocker \u03b1-dendrotoxin also abolished gamma oscillations. In carbachol-induced PPN population responses, \u03c9-agatoxin-IVA reduced higher, and \u03c9-CgTx mostly lower, frequencies.

Annexin V assay with flow cytometry and DNA ladder assay demonstrated that treatment of INS-1 cells with 100 \u00b5M H(2)O(2) for 18 h significantly increased apoptotic cells. A comparable level of apoptosis was also observed after 18 h when the cells were treated with 100 \u00b5M H(2)O(2) only for initial 30 min. The H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis was abolished by 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid tetra(acetoxymethyl)ester (BAPTA/AM), a chelator of intracellular Ca(2+), by 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborate (2-APB), a blocker of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)) receptors and cation channels, and by xestospongin D, a blocker of IP(3) receptors, and was partially blocked by SKF-96365, a non-selective cation channel blocker. However, nicardipine, an L-type voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channel blocker, or N-(p-amylcinnamoyl)anthranilic acid (ACA), a TRPM2 blocker, had little effect on the apoptosis. The inhibitory effect of BAPTA/AM or 2-APB on the H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis was largely attenuated when the drug was added 30 min or 1 h after start of the treatment with H(2)O(2).

By means of microarrays and transcriptional sequencing strategies, we used two models of adaptive RVH to characterize a gene expression pattern reflective of growth and the maintenance of myocardial structure. Moreover, two models of RVF were associated with fibrosis, capillary rarefaction, the decreased expression of genes encoding the angiogenesis factors vascular endothelial growth factor, insulin-like growth factor 1, apelin, and angiopoeitin-1, and the increased expression of genes encoding a set of glycolytic enzymes. The treatment of established RVF with a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor blocker reversed RVF, and partly reversed the molecular RVF program. We conclude that normal right and left ventricles demonstrate clearly discernable differences in the expression of mRNA and microRNA, and that RVH and RVF are characterized by distinct patterns of gene expression that relate to cell growth, angiogenesis, and energy metabolism.",

Although the functional expression of GABA(B) receptors coupled to the G(i) protein was reported for airway smooth muscle, the role of GABA(B) receptors in airway responsiveness remains unclear. We investigated whether G(i)-coupled GABA(B) receptors cross-regulate phospholipase C (PLC), an enzyme classically regulated by G(q)-coupled receptors in human airway smooth muscle cells. Both the GABA(B)-selective agonist baclofen and the endogenous ligand GABA significantly increased the synthesis of inositol phosphate, whereas GABA(A) receptor agonists, muscimol, and 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol exerted no effect. The baclofen-induced synthesis of inositol phosphate and transient increases in [Ca(2+)](i) were blocked by CGP35348 and CGP55845 (selective GABA(B) antagonists), pertussis toxin (PTX, which inactivates the G(i) protein), gallein (a G(\u03b2\u03b3) signaling inhibitor), U73122 (an inhibitor of PLC-\u03b2), and xestospongin C, an inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor blocker. Baclofen also potentiated the bradykinin-induced synthesis of inositol phosphate and transient increases in [Ca(2+)](i), which were blocked by CGP35348 or PTX. Moreover, baclofen potentiated the substance P-induced contraction of airway smooth muscle in isolated guinea pig tracheal rings. In conclusion, the stimulation of GABA(B) receptors in human airway smooth muscle cells rapidly mobilizes intracellular Ca(2+) stores by the synthesis of inositol phosphate via the activation of PLC-\u03b2, which is stimulated by G(\u03b2\u03b3) protein liberated from G(i) proteins coupled to GABA(B) receptors. Furthermore, crosstalk between GABA(B) receptors and G(q)-coupled receptors potentiates the synthesis of inositol phosphate, transient increases in [Ca(2+)](i), and smooth muscle contraction through G(i) proteins.",

The final part of the review integrates information from the previous chapters, demonstrating how carvedilol can contribute to reduce doxorubicin toxicity on cardiac mitochondria. The two referred examples result in important take-home messages: a) drug-induced cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction is an important contributor for drug-associated organ failure, b) protection of mitochondrial function is involved in the beneficial impact of some clinically-used drugs and c) a more accurate prediction of toxic vs. beneficial effects should be an important component of drug development by the pharmaceutical industry.",

All patients (n= 279) were treated according to recommended guidelines and randomized to BNP-guided (BNP) or to conventional (CTR) HF treatment. The goal was to reduce BNP levels to <150 ng/L in younger patients and <300 ng/L in elderly patients, respectively. The primary outcome was a composite of death due to any cause, need for hospitalization and worsening HF. The study groups were well matched, including for BNP concentration at entry (mean: 808 vs. 899 ng/L; P= 0.34). There were no significant differences between the groups regarding either the primary outcome (P = 0.18) or any of the secondary endpoints. There were no differences for the pre-specified analyses; days out of hospital, and younger vs. elderly.

The aim of this study was to assess the temporal change in the concordance between patient presenting risk and the intensity of evidence-based therapies received for non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes over a 9-year period. Data from 3,562 patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes enrolled in the Australian and New Zealand population of the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) from 1999 to 2007 were analyzed. Patients were stratified to risk groups on the basis of the GRACE risk score for in-hospital mortality. Main outcome measures included in-hospital use of widely accepted evidence-based medications, investigations, and procedures. Invasive management was consistently higher in low-risk patients than in intermediate- or high-risk patients (coronary angiography 66.7% vs 63.5% vs 35.3%, p <0.001; percutaneous coronary intervention 31.1% vs 22.0% vs 12.9%, p <0.001). Absolute rates of angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention in the high-risk group remained 24% and 15% lower compared to the low-risk group in the most recent time period (2005 to 2007). In-hospital use of thienopyridine, low-molecular weight heparin, and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors showed a similar inverse relation with risk. Prescription of aspirin, \u03b2 blockers, statins, and angiotensin receptor blockers was inversely related to risk before 2004, although this inverse relation was no longer present in the most recent time period (2005 to 2007). Only in-hospital use of unfractionated heparin showed use concordant with patient risk status. In conclusion, despite an overall increase in the uptake of evidence-based therapies, most investigations and treatments are not targeted on the basis of patient risk. Clinician risk stratification remains suboptimal compared to objective measures of patient risk.", 
    "157": "Valvular disorders are common, and result in a neurohormonal milieu similar to the heart failure state. Although valve surgery is the therapy of choice in symptomatic severe lesions, many patients do not receive surgery for a variety of reasons. Beta-blockers have a role in the management of many patients with valvular disorders, especially in the case of patients with mitral stenosis, where they reduce the transmitral gradient. They may also serve as life-saving therapy in pregnant women with pulmonary edema. Other uses of beta-blockers include the reduction of valve-related hemolysis, the prevention of atrial fibrillation, and the relief of dynamic left and right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. The prevention of aortic root dilation, potentially with beta-receptor blockade, may reduce the risk of aortic insufficiency in Marfan syndrome, and also in those with bicuspid aortic valves or following the Ross procedure. In this review, the potential role of beta-blockers is explored for the treatment of severe mitral and aortic regurgitation and asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis.",

Under unanesthesia, phentolamine administration (\u03b1-adrenoceptor antagonist, 10 mg/kg) decreased the mid-frequency component (MF 0.33-0.73 Hz) and inversely increased the high-frequency component (HF 1.3-2.5 Hz). The increased HF was suppressed by subsequent treatment with atenolol (\u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist, 10 mg/kg), but not with atropine (muscarinic receptor antagonist, 10 mg/kg). Moreover, phentolamine administration after atenolol decreased MF, but did not increase HF. LT-exposure increased MF and HF; however, phentolamine pretreatment suppressed the increased MF during LT-exposure, and atenolol pretreatment dose-dependently decreased the increased HF. These results suggest that MF and HF of SBPV may reflect \u03b1-adrenoceptor-mediated vasomotor function and \u03b2-adrenoceptor-mediated cardiac sympathetic function, respectively, in the conscious state.",

    "163": "Glutamate released by activated microglia induces excitotoxic neuronal death, which likely contributes to non-cell autonomous neuronal death in neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. Although both blockade of glutamate receptors and inhibition of microglial activation are the therapeutic candidates for these neurodegenerative diseases, glutamate receptor blockers also perturbed physiological and essential glutamate signals, and inhibitors of microglial activation suppressed both neurotoxic/neuroprotective roles of microglia and hardly affected disease progression. We previously demonstrated that activated microglia release a large amount of glutamate specifically through gap junction hemichannel. Hence, blockade of gap junction hemichannel may be potentially beneficial in treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",

We found that pharmacologic blockade of gap junction hemichannel inhibited excessive glutamate release from activated microglia in vitro and in vivo without producing notable toxicity. Blocking gap junction hemichannel significantly suppressed neuronal loss of the spinal cord and extended survival in transgenic mice carrying human superoxide dismutase 1 with G93A or G37R mutation as an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mouse model. Moreover, blockade of gap junction hemichannel also significantly improved memory impairments without altering amyloid \u03b2 deposition in double transgenic mice expressing human amyloid precursor protein with K595N and M596L mutations and presenilin 1 with A264E mutation as an Alzheimer's disease mouse model.",

    "166": "The acute and chronic effects of certain drugs can often be opposite. For example, in congestive heart failure acute administration of \u03b2-adrenoceptor agonists results in beneficial improvement in symptoms of the disease, but their chronic use increases mortality. Conversely, certain \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonists/inverse agonists (\u03b2-blockers) initially cause a detrimental response by decreasing cardiac contractility in congestive heart failure, whereas chronic treatment with the same \u03b2-blockers improves contractility and survival. Furthermore, this time-dependent reversal of outcomes occurs in nonpharmacological interventions, such as exercise, and can even be observed in the response of plants to pruning or other stressors, with the results being a different short-term versus long-term effect. Here, we review some of these phenomena with a special emphasis on the temporal dissociation of pharmacological effects. Although Francis Colpaert used this knowledge to lead a drug discovery project for an analgesic compound that initially produced hyperalgesia, we focused on examples outside the central nervous system.",

In previous studies, we discovered the presence of adrenergic and muscarinic receptors in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). However, little is known about the role of these receptors in cardiac differentiation and development, which is critically important in cardiac physiology and pharmacology. Here, we demonstrated that a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2-AR) agonist significantly enhanced cardiac differentiation as indicated by a higher percentage of beating embryoid bodies and a higher expression level of cardiac markers. Application of \u03b21-AR and \u03b22-AR antagonists partly abolished the effect of the \u03b2-AR agonist. In addition, by administering selective inhibitors we found that the effect of \u03b2-AR was driven via p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and extracellular-signal regulated kinase pathway. These findings suggest that ESCs are also a target for \u03b2-adrenergic regulation and \u03b2-adrenergic signaling plays a role in ESC cardiac differentiation.",

The LVI-LC-LC-FD method combines analyte isolation, preconcentration and determination into a single step. Significant reductions in costs for sample pre-treatment (solvent and solid phases for clean up) and method development times are also achieved. Using LC-TOF-MS, accurate mass measurements within 3\u2009ppm error were obtained for all of the \u03b2-blockers studied. Empirical formula information can be obtained by this method, allowing the unequivocal identification of the target compounds in the samples. To increase the sensitivity, a solid-phase extraction step with Oasis MCX cartridge was carried out yielding recoveries of 79-114% (n=5) with RSD 2-7% for the LC-TOF-MS method. SPE gives a high purification of \u03b2-blockers compared with the existing methods. A 100% methanol wash was allowed for these compounds with no loss of analytes. Limit of quantification was 1-7\u2009ng/L for LVI-LC-LC-FD and 0.25-5\u2009ng/L for LC-TOF-MS. As a result of selective extraction and effective removal of coextractives, no matrix effect was observed in LVI-LC-LC-FD and LC-TOF-MS analyses.

For anionic ibuprofen and non-ionic theophylline, no unusual/unexpected release profiles were obtained from tablets containing a mixture of two polymers. However, for cationic propranolol HCl, a combination of polyethylene oxide (PEO) with sodium carboxymethylcellulose (NaCMC) produced a significantly slower drug release compared to the matrices with single polymers. The potential use of this synergistic interaction can be a design of new extended release pharmaceutical dosage forms with a more prolonged release (beyond 12 h) using lower polymer amount, which could be particularly beneficial for freely water-soluble drugs, preferably for once daily oral administration. In order to explain changes in the obtained drug release profiles, Fourier transform infrared absorption spectroscopy was performed. A possible explanation for the more prolonged propranolol HCl release from matrices based on both PEO and NaCMC may be due to a chemical bond (i.e. ionic/electrostatic intermolecular interaction) between amine group of the cationic drug and carboxyl group of the anionic polymer, leading to a formation of a new type/form of the active (i.e. salt) with sustained release pattern.",

Cardiovascular structure and function were determined using organ wet weight, in vivo echocardiography, histological analysis of inflammation and collagen, isolated heart and thoracic aortic ring preparations, and single cell microelectrode measurements. From 15 months, untreated SHRs developed left ventricular dilation, hypertrophy, inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrosis, and action potential prolongation together with progressive systolic, diastolic, and endothelial dysfunction and increased cardiac stiffness. Treatment with metoprolol decreased systolic blood pressure at 21 months only but improved survival, decreased ventricular weight, prevented chamber dilation, reduced inflammation, decreased fibrosis, attenuated action potential prolongation, improved systolic and diastolic function, decreased stiffness and improved endothelium-independent vascular responses. Chronic metoprolol treatment markedly attenuated both cardiac and vascular remodeling in the aging SHRs, thus attenuating the onset of heart failure and improving survival, independent of blood pressure reduction.",

Twelve subjects had two microdialysis fibres placed in the ventral forearm and were immersed to the sternum in a bathtub on parallel study days (normoxia and poikilocapnic hypoxia with an arterial O(2) saturation of 80%). One fibre served as the control (1 mM propranolol) and the other received 5 mM yohimbine (plus 1 mM propranolol) to block adrenergic receptors. Skin blood flow was assessed at each site (laser Doppler flowmetry), divided by mean arterial pressure to calculate cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC), and scaled to baseline. Cold exposure was first induced by a progressive reduction in water temperature from 36 to 23\u00b0C over 30 min to assess cutaneous vascular regulation, then by clamping the water temperature at 10\u00b0C for 45 min to test defense of core temperature. During normoxia, cold stress reduced CVC in control (-44 \u00b1 4%) and yohimbine sites (-13 \u00b1 7%; both P < 0.05 versus precooling). Hypoxia caused vasodilatation prior to cooling but resulted in greater reductions in CVC in control (-67 \u00b1 7%) and yohimbine sites (-35 \u00b1 11%) during cooling (both P < 0.05 versus precooling; both P < 0.05 versus normoxia).

This study used a step-through inhibitory avoidance task to assess memory in male Wistar rats. The results showed that post-training intra-CeA administrations of different doses of WIN55,212-2 (0.01, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.25\u03bcg/rat) decreased memory as revealed by a decrease in memory retrieval on the test day. The decrease in retrieval induced by post-training WIN55,212-2 (0.25\u03bcg/rat) was reversed by pre-test administration of the same dose of the drug, which was suggestive of drug-induced state-dependent memory. Although pre-test intra-CeA administrations of isoprenaline (0.01, 0.025 and 0.05\u03bcg/rat) alone had no effect, its co-administrations at doses of 0.025 and 0.05\u03bcg/rat with an ineffective dose of WIN55,212-2 (0.1\u03bcg/rat) restored memory retrieval that impaired by post-training WIN55,212-2 (0.25\u03bcg/rat). The results also showed that pre-test intra-CeA administrations of atenolol (0.01, 0.05 and 0.1\u03bcg/rat) alone had no effect, but at dose of 0.1\u03bcg/rat disrupted state-dependent memory induced by WIN55,212-2. Moreover, the improving effect of isoprenaline (0.025\u03bcg/rat) on retrieval of state-dependent memory induced by WIN55,212-2 (0.1\u03bcg/rat) was prevented by intra-CeA co-injections of atenolol.

    "197": "Data were extracted from our Society of Thoracic Surgeons certified database for patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass graft surgery from 2000 to 2008. We compared the outcomes for patients who received preoperative \u03b2-blockers with those of patients who did not.", 
    "198": "The study group had 12,855 patients, of whom 7,967 (62.0%) were treated preoperatively with \u03b2-blockers. Using propensity matching, we selected two matched groups of 4,474 patients with preoperative \u03b2-blocker use and 4,474 not using preoperative \u03b2-blockers. In the unmatched cohort, only deep sternal infection (0.3% versus 0.5% without \u03b2-blockers; p=0.032), pneumonia (1.9% versus 2.4% without \u03b2-blockers; p=0.039), and intraoperative blood usage (37.2% versus 34.1% without \u03b2-blockers; p<0.001) reached statistically significant difference. In the matched groups, there was no difference between adverse event rates in patients treated with \u03b2-blockers and those who were not. The number of patients requiring intraoperative blood product use was significantly higher among \u03b2-blocker-treated patients (p=0.004). Calculating the adjusted odds ratios showed that in the matched groups, the preoperative use of \u03b2-blockers was not an independent predictor of mortality.", 
    "199": "A rational for preoperative \u03b2-blockade exists. However, as with any medical intervention, its application should be tailored to specific clinical scenarios. With no differences in mortality or morbidity, our findings do not support preoperative \u03b2-blockade as a useful quality indicator for coronary artery bypass graft surgery.", 
    "200": "Increasing numbers of patients are receiving implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs); the devices remain fully functional in most terminally ill patients at the time of death. We describe a case of a terminally ill patient with repeated defibrillations who requested urgent ICD deactivation. Nonmedical magnets available in the facility were used to deactivate the ICD and terminate the defibrillations. We then studied various magnetic field sources commonly available in homes, such as ceramic magnets, cell phones, computer hard drives, headsets, and earbuds that potentially may be used to temporarily deactivate an ICD until a device technician is available for reprogramming. We conclude that commonly available magnetic sources may potentially be used to deactivate an ICD. The clinical usefulness of this is speculative and limited to conditions when the need to turn off the device is urgent, and a delay in reprogramming is anticipated.",

The difference in mean IOP between groups ranged from 0.2 to 0.7 \u2009mm\u2009Hg across visits and time points, with a mean pooled difference of 0.4\u2009 mm\u2009Hg (95% CI: -0.1 to 0.8), demonstrating equivalence of the two formulations. The most common drug-related adverse event was hyperemia of the eye (ocular hyperemia and conjunctival hyperemia combined), occurring in 11.8% of the TRA/TIM BAK-free group and 13.0% of the TRA/TIM group.", 
    "204": "Travoprost/timolol BAK-free demonstrated equivalence to travoprost/timolol preserved with BAK in efficacy. No clinically relevant differences in the safety profiles of travoprost/timolol BAK-free and travoprost/timolol preserved with BAK were identified.",

    "206": "In 43 pigs, a 14-mm-Hg PN was established and plasma concentrations of epinephrine, norepinephrine and vasopressin were measured in head-up, supine and head-down positions. Additionally, the effects of the following changes were studied: (1) increase in intrathoracic blood volume (ITBV) by means of hydroxyethyl starch infusion; (2) vasodilatation induced by sodium nitroprusside, or (3) selective sympathicolysis induced by esmolol. Again, catecholamines (ELISA) and vasopressin (RIA) were determined.", 
    "207": "After PN, epinephrine levels did not significantly increase in the head-up position (p = 0.075) and remained also unchanged in the supine or head-down position. Plasma norepinephrine statistically significantly decreased in the head-up position (p = 0.046). Vasopressin concentrations remained unaltered. After increased ITBV, neither catecholamine nor vasopressin concentrations changed in any body position. Application of sodium nitroprusside or esmolol caused no changes.",

    "210": "In 106 patients undergoing coronary angiography who were free of coronary stenoses, a total of 39 clinical test variables were collected. The coronary collateral flow index (CFI) was measured. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was performed after choosing a restricted number of candidates emerging from univariate testing. Separate multiple regression analyses were performed in patients with and without beta-blocker therapy.", 
    "211": "Nine parameters were found to be possible determinants of CFI by univariate analysis: arterial hypertension (aHT), dyslipidemia, statins, diuretics, age, height, heart rate (HR), pulse pressure amplitude, and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). After multiple regression analysis, a low HR, absence of aHT, and elevated LVEDP were significantly related to CFI (F = 5.31, p = 0.002, adjusted r(2) = 0.12). In patients without beta-blockers, a low HR and absence of aHT were independent predictors of CFI (F = 8.03, p < 0.001, n = 50, adjusted r(2) = 0.30).", 
    "212": "A low HR and absence of aHT are both related to collateral preformation in humans. We suppose that bradycardia favors fluid shear stress in coronary arteries, thus triggering collateral growth.", 
    "213": "The activation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can induce inflammation that are one of key etiological conditions for the development of many chronic inflammatory diseases including atherosclerosis and diabetes. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) agonists play a crucial role in improving glucose and lipid homeostasis in the development of cardiovascular diseases. Evidence is growing that benefits of PPAR\u03b3 agonists may also be derived from the anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerotic properties of these agents. However, the role of rosiglitazone in regulating LPS-induced vascular inflammation has yet to be fully elucidated. The current study demonstrated that rosiglitazone exerted a potent anti-inflammatory action via decreasing interleukin-18 (IL-18), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), TLR4 and increasing PPAR\u03b3 in LPS-induced VSMCs. Furthermore, treatment of VSMCs with the TLR4 blocker or TLR4 small-interfering RNA presented that the regulatory effects of rosiglitazone on LPS-mediated inflammation in VSMCs were dependent on TLR4. Interestingly, the results indicated that beneficial effects of rosiglitazone on LPS-induced inflammation in VSMCs were mediated via interference of TLR4 and its downstream signaling components including Toll-interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing interferon-\u03b2 (TRIF), interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and interferon-gamma inducible protein 10 (IP-10). In summary, PPAR\u03b3 agonist rosiglitazone exerts anti-inflammatory property by antagonizing LPS-mediated inflammation in VSMCs. More importantly, the regulation of the TRIF-dependent TLR4 signaling pathway (TLR4/TRIF/ IRF3/IP-10) provides new insight to understand the mode of action of rosiglitazone for its anti-inflammatory effects.", 
    "214": "To prevent cardiovascular effects of peripherally administered propranolol, the aim of this study was to evaluate the spinal anesthetic effect of propranolol, a Na(\u00b1) channel blocker. After rats were injected with drugs intrathecally, the spinal anesthetic effect of propranolol was compared with that of lidocaine, which is known to produce local anesthesia. We also evaluated the effect of the addition of clonidine with propranolol on spinal anesthesia. Our results showed that propranolol produced a dose-dependent spinal blockade in motor, proprioception, and nociception. On a 50% effective dose (ED(50)) basis, the spinal anesthetic effect of propranolol in motor, proprioception, and nociception [1.16 (1.01-1.34), 1.10 (0.92-1.31), 1.05 (0.89-1.24)] was equal to lidocaine [1.03 (0.94-1.13), 0.95 (0.84-1.07), 0.87 (0.79-0.96)], respectively. On an equipotent basis (0.5, 1.0, 2.5 \u03bcmol), the sensory/nociceptive block duration caused by propranolol was longer than that caused by lidocaine (P\u22640.01). Co-administration of propranolol (1.1 \u03bcmol) and clonidine (0.5 \u03bcmol) produced greater spinal anesthesia than propranolol (1.1 \u03bcmol) or clonidine (0.5 \u03bcmol) alone. These preclinical findings demonstrated that propranolol produces similar spinal anesthesia to lidocaine and that \u03b1(2)-adrenergic receptors also contribute to improve the quality and duration of the spinal anesthetic effect of propranolol. Propranolol with a more sensory-selective action over motor blockade elicited longer spinal blockade than did lidocaine.", 
    "215": "Stepwise ablation is an effective treatment for persistent atrial fibrillation (AF), although it often requires multiple procedures to eliminate recurrent arrhythmias.", 
    "216": "This study evaluated single- and multiple-procedure long-term success rates and potential predictors of a favorable single-procedure outcome of stepwise ablation for persistent AF.", 
    "217": "This study comprised 395 patients with persistent AF (duration 16 months) undergoing de novo catheter ablation using the stepwise approach. Procedural success was defined as the absence of any arrhythmia recurrence. Patient characteristics and electrophysiological parameters were analyzed with respect to single- and multiple-procedure outcomes.", 
    "218": "After a follow-up of 27 \u00b1 7 months, 108 (27%) patients were free of arrhythmia recurrences with a single procedure. After 2.3 \u00b1 0.6 procedures, 312 (79%) patients were free of arrhythmia with concomitant antiarrhythmic treatment in 38% (23% on \u03b2-blocker). Female gender, duration of persistent AF, and congestive heart failure were predictive for the outcome after first ablation. However, the strongest predictors for single-procedure success were longer baseline AF cycle length (CL) and procedural AF termination. Moreover, procedural AF termination during the index procedure also predicted a favorable outcome after the last procedure, while the existence of congestive heart failure was associated with an increased risk for eventual arrhythmia recurrences.", 
    "219": "Single-procedure long-term success is anticipated in approximately a quarter of patients undergoing de novo ablation of persistent AF. Baseline AFCL emerged as the strongest predictor of single-procedure success, while AF termination during index ablation predicts the overall outcome. However, an overall success rate of 79% is achievable with multiple procedures.", 
    "220": "Severe mixed \u03b2-blocker and calcium channel blocker intoxication presents a significant risk for patient mortality. Although treatment is well-established, it sporadically fails to support the patient through massive overdoses, thus requiring non-conventional treatments. We report the use of extra-corporeal life support in a patient with refractory hemodynamic impairment due to multi-drug intoxication. Although sometimes used in clinical practice, extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation for intoxications has rarely been reported.", 
    "221": "A 36-year-old Caucasian man presented to our hospital with refractory hypotension, severe cardiac insufficiency and multi-organ failure due to mixed intoxication with atenolol, nifedipine, Lacidipine and sertraline. Together with standard treatment, we performed extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation to overcome refractory cardiogenic shock and lead the patient to achieve a full recovery.", 
    "222": "Standard of care for \u03b2-blocker and calcium channel blocker intoxication is well-defined and condensed into protocols of treatment. Although aimed at clearing the noxious agents from the patient's system, standard measures may fail to provide adequate hemodynamic support to allow recovery. In selected cases, extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation could be considered a bridge to drug clearance while preventing multi-organ failure due to profound shock.", 
    "223": "A delivery system which provides bimodal pH dependent release of poorly water soluble carvedilol in gastric and intestinal environment was designed. Preparation of solid dispersion with porous silica ensured a significantly higher dissolution rate of carvedilol in acidic and alkaline media in comparison to pure drug, while granulation of that solid dispersion with enteric polymer dispersion resulted in diminished immediate release in acidic media and fast release of the remaining drug in alkaline media. The ratio in quantities of first vs. second release was controlled with amount of enteric polymer dispersion used for granulation process. Desired 25 mg release of carvedilol at pH values 1.2 and 6.8 was achieved when 1.80 g of polymer per 1.0 g of solid dispersion (drug to silica ratio= 0.25 g : 2.0 g) was used.", 
    "224": "The infrared spectrum, ultraviolet spectrum, mass spectra, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of metoprolol tartrate, an antiarrhythmic medicine, were reported and interpreted comprehensively. The vibrations of functional groups in infrared spectrum, electron transitions in ultraviolet spectrum, and main characteristic fragmentations in mass spectra of metoprolol tartrate were discussed. All the (1) H and (13) C NMR chemical shifts were assigned by means of distoritionless enhancement by polarization transfer-135 and -90, (1) H-(1) H correlation spectroscopy, and (13) C-(1) H correlation spectroscopy via short- and long-range coupling.", 
    "225": "Short telomeres are associated with aging and age-related diseases. Our aim was to determine whether short leukocyte telomere length is associated with risk factors and cardiovascular diseases in a high-risk hypertensive population. We measured leukocyte telomere lengths at recruitment in 1271 subjects with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) participating in the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) study. At baseline, short mean telomere length was associated with coronary artery disease in males (odds ratio (OR) 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39-0.95), and transient ischemic attack in females (OR 0.62 95% CI 0.39-0.99). Proportion of short telomeres (shorter than 5\u2009kb) was associated with Framingham risk score (r=0.07, P<0.05), cerebrovascular disease (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.01-1.15) and type 2 diabetes in men (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.02-1.11). During follow-up, proportion of short telomeres was associated with combined cardiovascular mortality, stroke or angina pectoris (hazard ratio 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.07). Telomere length was not associated with smoking, body mass index, pulse pressure or self-reported use of alcohol. Our data suggest that reduced leukocyte telomere length is associated with cardiovascular risk factors and diseases as well as type 2 diabetes, and is a predictor of cardiovascular disease in elderly patients with hypertension and LVH."
