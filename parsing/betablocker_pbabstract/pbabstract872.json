    "0": "1. Alprenolol, a beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug reported to have the same potency as propranolol in vitro and in vivo, was found to be four times more active than procaine as a local anaesthetic on frog sciatic nerve.2. At doses of 0.125 mg/kg and above alprenolol protected anaesthetized guinea-pigs against ouabain-induced ventricular fibrillation.3. In isolated rabbit atria, resting potentials were unchanged, and the duration of the action potential was not prolonged, by concentrations of alprenolol up to 10.5 x 10(-6)M. The maximum rate of depolarization (MRD), however, was reduced by 30% at a concentration of 0.525 x 10(-6)M. This was 214 times less than the concentration which reduced the frog action potential height by 25%.4. The concentration of alprenolol required to produce more than 15% decrease in contraction or maximum driven frequency was 3.5 x 10(-6)M.5. As a test of the direct action of alprenolol on isolated cardiac muscle, MRD was also a more sensitive test than the measurement of electrical threshold or conduction velocity.", 
    "1": "1. The effluxes of (42)K(+) and (36)Cl(-) from isolated fat-cells from the rat were studied under a variety of conditions known to affect the metabolism of the cells. 2. (42)K(+) efflux from isolated fat cells was increased in a Na(+)-free-high-K(+) medium and decreased in a K(+)-free medium. The existence of K(+) exchange diffusion across the fat-cell membrane is suggested. 3. (36)Cl(-) efflux from isolated fat-cells was decreased when the Cl(-) component of the wash medium was replaced by acetate. The basal (36)Cl(-) efflux is suggested to be partly by Cl(-) exchange diffusion and partly in company with a univalent cation. 4. A variety of lipolytic stimuli, adrenaline, adrenocorticotrophic hormone, N-6,O-2'-dibutyryladenosine cyclic 3':5'-monophosphate and theophylline, increased (42)K(+) efflux from isolated fat-cells. The adrenaline stimulation was biphasic; an initial, rapid and transient increase in (42)K(+) loss from the fat-cells was followed by a slower, more prolonged, increase in (42)K(+) efflux. The initial phase was inhibited by phentolamine but not by propranolol. 5. Insulin increased (42)K(+) efflux only after preincubation with the cells.", 
    "2": "Experience with dextro-alprenolol in nine patients has shown that it is relatively ineffective in treating arrhythmias associated with acute myocardial infarction. Marginal effectiveness in the control of ventricular ectopic beats after myocardial infarction is outweighed by an appreciable hypotensive effect with risk of infarction. The drug was ineffective in the management of supraventricular arrhythmias.", 
    "3": "The circulatory, respiratory, and metabolic responses to steady state submaximal exercise have been studied in four women and two men with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, before treatment, after intravenous, and after three months of oral propranolol. The physical working capacity was significantly lower than in normal subjects, and the response to exercise was characterized by a tachycardia, low cardiac output and stroke volume, and high ventilation and blood lactate concentration. After propranolol there was a significant reduction in heart rate, but changes in most other measurements were slight and there was no improvement in effort tolerance though angina was relieved in the two patients in whom it was present. The possible causes of breathlessness and effort intolerance in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy are discussed in relation to known effects of propranolol. It is concluded that further trial of propranolol and other beta-adrenergic blocking agents is warranted.", 
    "4": "Haemodynamic studies have been performed in 9 patients whose blood pressures had been satisfactorily controlled with oral propranolol for 7 to 29 months. A postural drop of blood pressure or a fall of blood pressure on exercise did not occur. Pulse rate and cardiac output were below normal at rest and on exercise; peripheral resistance was high. The results are similar to those obtained in a comparable group of hypertensives after acute administration of propranolol. These findings are discussed in relation to the mode of action of propranolol in hypertension.", 
    "5": "A review is given of 457 episodes of atrial fibrillation that occurred in 318 patients and were treated by DC shock. Antidysrhythmic drugs, such as quinidine, procainamide, and propranolol, given singly or in combination, were used concomitantly in 389 instances, and DC shock alone was given in 68 instances. The combined effects of quinidine and DC shock, and of procainamide and DC shock were studied in the experimental animal.Combined DC shock and drug therapy gave a higher conversion rate than DC shock alone, and a statistically significant difference was found in respect of the group of patients receiving procainamide and propranolol together (p<0.01). Antidysrhythmic drugs failed on the whole to reduce the incidence of DC shock-induced dysrhythmias. However, the incidence of certain digitalis and DC shock-induced dysrhythmias was significantly less when propranolol and procainamide were given as pretreatment than when procainamide or quinidine was given alone (p<0.01). In animal experiments, quinidine had no protective action against digitalis and DC shock-induced ectopic tachycardias. Clinical and experimental observations suggest that the cardiotoxicity of these drugs may be enhanced by DC shock. Immediate or delayed post-shock rhythm disorders can be drug related and, therefore, great caution should be exercised in the use of antidysrhythmic drugs in conjunction with DC shock therapy.", 
    "6": "A trial of oral propranolol as a hypotensive agent was designed to provide adequate treatment periods. Twenty-eight patients with essential hypertension, with a mean blood pressure of 190/111 mm. Hg, were controlled on 120-320 mg. of propranolol daily. Their mean treated blood pressure was 153/91. They then entered, on a randomized and double-blind basis, a cross-over trial of two 16-week periods, blood pressure being measured fortnightly. Propranolol caused a statistically significant fall in blood pressure when compared with placebo. When propranolol was withdrawn blood pressures rapidly rose to hypertensive levels, though not to untreated levels. No postural hypotension was found, but a small change in blood pressure levels on exercise was noted."
