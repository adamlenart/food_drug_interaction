    "0": "Coronary responses to adrenergic stimuli were determined in the intact beating heart before and after administration of practolol, 4-(2-hydroxy-3-isopropylaminoproproxy) acetanilide, which in low doses blocks myocardial but not vascular beta receptors. The left circumflex coronary artery of dogs was perfused with arterial blood at constant flow, and coronary perfusion pressure was measured. Before practolol, intracoronary injections of isoproterenol and norepinephrine and electrical stimulation of left cardiac sympathetic nerves caused reductions in perfusion pressure or vasodilatation associated with increases in left ventricular dp/dt, heart rate, and systolic pressure. After practolol, the coronary vasodilator response to isoproterenol was reduced by about 30% and occurred without significant changes in dp/dt, heart rate, and pressures. The addition of propranolol blocked completely the coronary responses to isoproterenol. Vascular responses to isoproterenol in the paw were not altered by practolol. Practolol antagonized the increases in dp/dt, heart rate, and systolic pressure and reversed coronary responses to norepinephrine and nerve stimulation from dilatation to constriction. The constriction, in turn, was reduced or reversed by phentolamine, an alpha receptor antagonist. Propranolol did not augment the constriction seen in response to norepinephrine and nerve stimulation after practolol. These results indicate that the coronary vasodilator action of norepinephrine and sympathetic nerve stimulation is indirect and caused by stimulation of myocardial beta receptors. The direct effect of these two stimuli on coronary vessels is minimal and is mediated through stimulation of alpha (vasoconstrictor) receptors. In contrast, the coronary vasodilator response to isoproterenol is both direct and indirect, resulting from stimulation of vascular and myocardial beta receptors; the direct vascular effect predominated in this study.", 
    "1": "Human foetal small intestine was shown to contain both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors with a predominance of beta-adrenoceptors. The tissue examined was obtained from foetuses of gestational age between 8 and 26 weeks.", 
    "2": "1. Prostaglandin F(2alpha) infused into the vertebral artery of the anaesthetized greyhound in doses which had no effect when given intravenously ((8-64 ng/kg)/min) caused an increase in blood pressure and heart rate.2. This response was not significantly altered by beta-adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol (10 mg i.v.) or by cervical cord section at C(4-6).3. The tachycardia was abolished and the pressor response greatly reduced by vagotomy or atropine (250 mug/kg i.v.).4. The pressor response which remained after vagotomy was abolished by subsequent sympathetic blockade with bethanidine (2-3 mg/kg i.v.) or bretylium (10 mg/kg i.v.).5. In contrast to the effects of propranolol or cervical cord section bethanidine (4-5 mg/kg i.v.) or bretylium (10 mg/kg i.v.) significantly reduced blood pressure and heart rate responses to intravertebral prostaglandin F(2alpha). This result suggests that bethanidine and bretylium have some central actions.6. It is concluded that the cardiovascular effects of intravertebral infusions of prostaglandin F(2alpha) are mediated by the autonomic nervous system and that the preferential pathway is withdrawal of vagal tone to the heart."
