Treatment of K loaded pancreatectomized dogs with glucagon or a B receptor blockading dosage of propranolol does not alter the proportion transferred, but treatment with glucagon and propranolol reduces it. It appears that in pancx dogs there is a reciprocal relation between insulin and B receptor mediated K transfer and that glucagon is involved in activity of the kaluresis independent K homeostatic mechanism.", 
    "1": "Decreased maximal O2 uptake (VO2max) and stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system have been previously shown to occur at high altitude. We hypothesized that tachycardia mediated by beta-adrenergic stimulation acted to defend VO2max at high altitude. Propranolol treatment beginning before high-altitude (4,300 m) ascent reduced heart rate during maximal and submaximal exercise in six healthy men treated with propranolol (80 mg three times daily) compared with five healthy subjects receiving placebo (lactose). Compared with sea-level values, the VO2max fell on day 2 at high altitude, but the magnitude of fall was similar in the placebo and propranolol treatment groups (26 +/- 6 vs. 32 +/- 5%, P = NS) and VO2max remained similar at high altitude in both groups once treatment was discontinued. During 30 min of submaximal (80% of VO2max) exercise, propranolol-treated subjects maintained O2 uptake levels that were as large as those in placebo subjects. The maintenance of maximal or submaximal levels of O2 uptake in propranolol-treated subjects at 4,300 m could not be attributed to increased minute ventilation, arterial O2 saturation, or hemoglobin concentration. Rather, it appeared that propranolol-treated subjects maintained O2 uptake by transporting a greater proportion of the O2 uptake with each heartbeat. Thus, contrary to our hypothesis, beta-adrenergic blockade did not impair maximal or submaximal O2 uptake at high altitude due perhaps to compensatory mechanisms acting to maintain stroke volume and cardiac output.", 
    "2": "To evaluate the role of beta-adrenergic receptors in the control of human sweating, we studied six subjects during 40 min of cycle-ergometer exercise (60% maximal O2 consumption) at 22 degrees C 2 h after oral administration of placebo or nonselective beta-blockade (BB, 80 mg propranolol). Internal temperature (esophageal temperature, Tes), mean skin temperature (Tsk), local chest temperature (Tch), and local chest sweat rate (msw) were continuously recorded. The control of sweating was best described by the slope of the linear relationship between msw and Tes and the threshold Tes for the onset of sweating. The slope of the msw-Tes relationship decreased 27% (P less than 0.01), from 1.80 to 1.30 mg X cm-2 X min-1 X degree C-1 during BB. The Tes threshold for sweating (36.8 degrees C) was not altered as the result of BB. These data suggest that BB modified the control of sweating via some peripheral interaction. Since Tsk was significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced during BB exercise, from a control value of 32.8 to 32.2 degrees C, we evaluated the influence of the reduction in local skin temperature (Tsk) in the altered control of sweating. Reductions in Tch accounted for only 45% of the decrease in the slope of the msw-Tes relationship during BB. Since evaporative heat loss requirement during exercise with BB, as estimated from the energy balance equation, was also reduced 18%, compared with control exercise, we concluded that during BB the reduction in sweating at any Tes is the consequence of both a decrease in local Tsk and a direct effect on sweat gland.", 
    "3": "Rat aortic smooth muscle cells in culture (A-10; ATCC CRL 1476) exhibited low levels of beta-adrenergic receptors as determined by specific binding of [125I]cyanopindolol ([125I]CYP) and marginal stimulation of adenylate cyclase in plasma membranes by (-)isoproterenol. When these cells were exposed to 5 mM sodium butyrate, the number of beta-adrenergic receptors and the beta-agonist-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity increased markedly. However, basal, GTP, Gpp(NH)p, and fluoride-stimulated activities did not change. The induction of beta-adrenergic receptors and beta-agonist stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was time- and dose-dependent, and was relatively specific for sodium butyrate. Propionate and valerate were less effective than butyrate, while isobutyrate, succinate, and malonate were ineffective. The induction involved RNA and protein synthesis because induction was prevented by treatment with cycloheximide, puromycin, and actinomycin D. Butyrate did not cause a general increase in cell surface receptors, because the number of vasopressin receptors did not change. The sustained presence of butyrate appeared to be necessary for the maintenance of the induced beta-receptors. When butyrate was removed, receptor number and beta-agonist-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity were decreased by 90% over 24 hr. We conclude that the poor response of rat aortic smooth muscle cell plasma membranes to beta-adrenergic agonists is due to the presence of a low number of beta-adrenergic receptors. Butyrate markedly increased the number of beta-receptors which resulted in a proportional increase in beta-agonist-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. The increase in receptor number was dependent on RNA and protein synthesis. Butyrate treatment did not affect the activity of the cyclase unit and the efficiency of coupling between the receptors and the guanine nucleotide regulatory protein, Ns.", 
    "4": "In conscious gastric fistula rats, gastric distension with saline to a pressure of 7 cm caused a threefold reduction of basal gastric acid secretion. Distension with 6.25% peptone solution to the same pressure doubled basal acid secretion. The saline distension-induced inhibition was abolished by guanethidine and markedly reduced by propranolol; phentolamine was ineffective. The response to peptone was unaffected by guanethidine. The results suggest that in the rat, gastric distension at physiological pressures inhibits acid secretion by a beta-adrenergic reflex. The inhibition can be masked by concurrent chemical stimulation of the gastric mucosa by the digestion products of food.", 
    "5": "Ciliary epithelial cells derived from human eye were successfully propagated through many generations after transformation with simian virus 40. The cell clone 8-SVHCE was isolated and characterized by immunoprecipitation and pharmacological studies that demonstrated the presence of several functional properties observed in the parent cells of this tissue. Immunoprecipitation revealed the presence of large tumor (T) antigen, and Southern blot analysis showed the incorporation of viral DNA into high molecular weight ciliary epithelial cell DNA. The presence of beta-adrenergic receptors was demonstrated by direct binding of a radiolabeled antagonist, [125I]iodopindolol, to membrane preparations of 8-SVHCE cells (Kd = 41.8 pM and Bmax = 67.1 fmol/mg of protein). Competition experiments with [125I]iodopindolol and selective drugs suggested that the receptors are of the beta 2-adrenergic subtype. Studies of catecholamine-stimulated cellular cAMP production and of isoproterenol-dependent protein phosphorylation of vimentin in 8-SVHCE indicated the functional conservation of beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated processes that are thought to be important in the regulation of aqueous humor production by the ciliary epithelium in vivo.", 
    "6": "The effect of beta-funaltrexamine (beta-FNA), an irreversible mu receptor blocker in isolated tissue bioassays, on mu, kappa and delta opioid receptor binding and the binding of beta-[3H]FNA were determined in guinea pig brain membranes. beta-FNA inhibited the binding of mu, kappa and delta opioid ligands to their receptors with Ki values of 2.2, 14 and 78 nM, respectively. Pretreatment of brain membranes with beta-FNA (less than 2 microM) followed by extensive washing inhibited mu binding and to a lesser degree delta binding, without changing kappa binding. The extent of the irreversible inhibition was dependent on the concentration of beta-FNA, and this inhibition on mu binding could be observed with as little as 1 nM beta-FNA. The irreversible inhibition of mu binding by beta-FNA pretreatment was due to a decrease in the number of binding sites with little change in Kd, and was more pronounced in the presence of increasing concentrations of NaCl. Specific binding of beta-[3H]FNA to opioid receptors was demonstrated. The rate of specific binding with 2 nM beta-[3H]FNA was rapid in the initial 10 min and did not reach maximum in 90 min. The dissociation of bound beta-[3H]FNA (5 nM added) by the addition of excess unlabeled naloxone reached maximum at 30 min with approximately 35% of specifically bound beta-[3H]FNA remaining. Mu opioids were most effective in preventing specific binding of beta-[3H]FNA when added before beta-[3H]FNA. Opioids added 1 hr after 2 nM beta-[3H]FNA could displace maximally only 70 to 75% of specific binding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "7": "Modulation of neutrophil activation by catecholamines may reflect regulatory mechanisms that couple beta-adrenergic and N-formyl peptide receptors to antagonistic biochemical pathways. We examined kinetic and mechanistic aspects of the inhibition by catecholamines of neutrophil activation by formyl peptides. Inhibition of oxidant production by isoproterenol (ISO) was detected as low as 3 nM, had an ID50 of 10(-7) M, and could be blocked and reversed by propranolol. Recovery of cell function occurred over a period of minutes when the concentration of ISO was less than 10(-6) M. These observations are discussed in terms of the interaction of ISO with the adrenergic receptors. The site of catecholamine action is addressed. ISO neither influences formyl peptide-receptor interaction nor does it inhibit oxidant production by phorbol ester. These results suggest an impairment of intracellular signalling processes that couple the formyl peptide-receptor binding to cell activation. We observed inhibition of intracellular Ca++ elevation by ISO only at low formyl peptide concentrations. This inhibition is consistent with a partial inhibition of phosphoinositide metabolism, which was observed. Several other cell responses, including actin polymerization and right angle light scatter, are minimally inhibited by 10(-6) M ISO indicating that the cell activation process is not entirely obliterated. The presence of catecholamine and formyl peptide results in a synergistic elevation of cAMP. The intracellular targets of ISO action may be regulated by cAMP dependent kinases and could follow a branchpoint in the activation sequence that leads distinctly to oxidase activation and cytoskeletal activation.", 
    "8": "3H-Labeled inositol phosphate accumulation is observed when prelabeled FRTL-5 cells (a rat thyroid cell line) are exposed to norepinephrine (NE) or TSH. The presence of inositol trisphosphate among the products implicates a phosphodiesterase-catalyzed hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. The response to NE is much greater than that to TSH. This may be explained by the ability of cAMP to inhibit inositol phosphate accumulation in these cells. The stimulation by NE is inhibited by alpha 1-adrenergic receptor antagonists and is markedly potentiated in medium of reduced Ca2+ concentration. After chronic withdrawal of TSH from the growth medium, the magnitude of the response to NE is considerably reduced; however, there is no substantial shift in the dose-response curve. This reflects the dependency of alpha 1-adrenergic receptor expression on TSH in the FRTL-5 cell. In contrast, the characteristics of inositol phosphate accumulation induced by acute treatment with TSH are similar in cells maintained in the presence or absence of a low concentration of this hormone, and correlate well with the iodide efflux and iodination of thyroglobulin observed in response to TSH. These results support the hypothesis that TSH may mediate certain of its physiological effects through cAMP-independent mechanisms, such as phospholipid/Ca2+ and C-kinase pathways.", 
    "9": "Mechanisms controlling forearm muscle vascular resistance (FMVR) during postural changes were investigated in seven patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF) and in seven control subjects with unimpaired left ventricular function. Relative brachioradial muscle blood flow was determined by the local 133Xe-washout technique. Unloading of baroreceptors with use of 45 degree upright tilt was comparably obtained in the patients with CHF and control subjects. Control subjects had substantially increased FMVR and heart rate to maintain arterial pressure whereas patients with CHF had decreased FMVR by 51 +/- 11% (mean +/- SEM, p less than .02) and had no increase in heart rate despite a fall in arterial pressure during upright tilt. The autoregulatory and local vasoconstrictor reflex responsiveness during postural changes in forearm vascular pressures were intact in both groups. Further investigations were carried out in the patients with CHF. The left axillary nerve plexus was blocked by local anesthesia in the seven patients. No alterations in forearm vascular pressures were observed. This blockade preserved the local regulation of FMVR but reversed the vasodilator response to upright tilt as FMVR increased by 30 +/- 7% (p less than .02). Blockade of central neural impulses to this limb combined with brachial arterial infusions of phentolamine completely abolished the humoral vasoconstriction in the tilted position. Infusions of propranolol to the contralateral brachial artery that did not affect baseline values of heart rate, arterial pressure, or the local reflex regulation of FMVR reversed the abnormal vasodilator response to upright tilt as FMVR increased by 42 +/- 12% (p less than .02). Despite augmented baseline values, forearm venous but not arterial plasma levels of epinephrine increased in the tilted position, as did arterial rather than venous plasma concentrations of norepinephrine in these patients. The results suggest a beta-adrenergic reflex mechanism elicited by spinal or supraspinal neural impulses and probably modulating a cotransmitter release in the patients with CHF.", 
    "10": "Diltiazem or verapamil were each given at two different infusion rates to pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs with or without a concurrent infusion of propranolol. Changes in cardiovascular function, in reflex activation as reflected by circulating catecholamine levels, and in the chronotropic response to an exogenous beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol, were measured. When administered alone, diltiazem or verapamil, at plasma concentrations of 160 and 370 ng/ml, or 230 and 500 ng/ml, respectively, prolonged atrioventricular conduction and caused systemic vasodilation with a decrease in mean arterial pressure. Cardiac index increased, associated with an increase in arterial norepinephrine level. Heart rate increased with the lower level of verapamil; left ventricular dP/dt increased with both levels of verapamil and at the higher level of diltiazem. Plasma propranolol levels of approximately 35 ng/ml were well tolerated in the absence of diltiazem or verapamil. When added to diltiazem or verapamil, propranolol resulted in an increase in systemic vascular resistance to near control values; a decrease in cardiac index, left ventricular dP/dt, and heart rate; and worsened atrioventricular conduction. Three of nine animals in the high verapamil-propranolol group were unable to maintain a mean arterial pressure greater than 50 mm Hg, and developed a low cardiac index with an elevated systemic vascular resistance, despite very high levels of circulating catecholamines. Compared to the anesthetized state, greater amounts of isoproterenol were needed to effect the same increase in heart rate with the addition of diltiazem, verapamil, or propranolol alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "11": "Our study describes the effect of norepinephrine on adenylate cyclase activity in adipocytes from control and diabetic rats. The results show that diabetes induced an increase in both basal and norepinephrine-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. This higher activity was not suppressed when the animals were treated for 2 days with the beta-blocking agent propranolol. On the other hand, adipocytes from control animals treated with propranolol showed a higher adenylate cyclase activity (basal and in response to norepinephrine). beta-Adrenergic receptors were examined in adipocytes from control and diabetic rats with and without treatment with propranolol. The results show a higher beta-receptor density in adipocytes from diabetic animals. When the animals were treated with propranolol, the beta-blocker induced a higher receptor density in adipocytes from control animals without affecting the already increased receptor density in diabetic preparations. The data suggest that adenylate cyclase activity in response to norepinephrine in adipose tissue is increased during at least a certain period of the diabetic state. This increase in adenylate cyclase activity is accompanied with an increase in beta-receptor density, but in contrast to control animals, this receptor density is not further increased with propranolol treatment.", 
    "12": "Paroxysms of atrial tachycardia are oftentimes associated with polyuria. The plasma levels of the potent diuretic hormone, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), are elevated during episodes of atrial tachycardia, suggesting that ANP may play a role in mediating the diuresis. The mechanism of enhanced ANP secretion associated with atrial tachycardia is not known. We examined the effect of altering the pacing frequency of isolated left rat atria on ANP secretion. Atria were suspended between an electrode and hook connected to a force transducer and superfused with medium 199. The ANP content of the superfusate was measured by radioimmunoassay. Increasing the frequency of pacing from 2 to 4 Hz resulted in a 46 +/- 5% (means +/- SE, n = 9) rise in immunoreactive ANP secretion above base line (P less than 0.01). Lowering the frequency from 4 to 2 Hz lowered immunoreactive ANP secretion by 36 +/- 3% (n = 6) relative to base line (P less than 0.02). Incremental increases in the pacing frequency from 2 to 8 Hz resulted in a continual rise in immunoreactive ANP with a peak increase of 191 +/- 6% of base line (n = 8) at 8 Hz. To examine the possibility that release of norepinephrine or acetylcholine from endogenous nerves mediated this effect, the atria were superfused with the combination of 0.1 microM propranolol, 1.0 microM phentolamine, and 10 microM atropine. The concentrations of the antagonists were 125-fold or higher than the dissociation constant for binding to receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "13": "We studied the control of forearm vascular resistance (FVR) by cardiopulmonary receptors in seven patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and in seven normotensive control subjects. Increasing levels of lower body negative pressure (LBNP) (-10 and -40 mm Hg) induced a progressive decrease in central venous pressure (CVP) and an increase in FVR. The changes in these two variables were correlated both in normal subjects and patients with hypertension (slope for normal subjects = -29.9, for patients with hypertension = -40.3, NS). After propranolol, there was a significant reduction in the increase in FVR induced by -40 mm Hg LBNP in normal subjects (+107 +/- 5 vs +129 +/- 15 mm Hg/ml/sec, p less than .05) but not in patients with hypertension. Consequently, the slope of the delta CVP/delta FVR regression was reduced in normal subjects (-20.6, p less than .01) but not in patients with hypertension. In another seven normal subjects and seven patients with hypertension and LVH we assessed the effects of -10 and -40 mm Hg LBNP on left ventricular filling pressure (LVFP). LBNP induced similar changes in CVP, LVFP, and total peripheral resistance both in normal subjects and in patients with hypertension. Propranolol failed to modify the effects of LBNP on CVP and LVFP in both groups and reduced the response of total peripheral resistance to -40 mm Hg LBNP only in normal subjects. Propranolol did not reduce the response of FVR to the cold pressor test and sustained handgrip or the arterial baroreflex response to the injection of phenylephrine and increased neck tissue pressure. Thus, hypertension-induced LVH seems to be associated with a selective impairment of the left ventricular sensory receptors.", 
    "14": "Inhibition of synthesis of the pineal neurohormone melatonin (MEL) in mice, by administration of propranolol (PRO) in the evening, and daily injections of p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA), resulted in a significant depression of the primary antibody response to sheep red blood cells (SRBC). Spleen cells from these mice showed a reduced reactivity against antigens in the autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction (AMLR). In contrast, alloreactivity remained normal. Reconstitution of the night-time peak of plasma MEL by evening injections to the mice completely reversed the suppression of the humoral response and the AMLR. MEL administration was able to antagonize the depression of antibody production induced by corticosterone in vivo. These results suggest that the pineal gland has important immunomodulatory functions through its cyclic, circadian release of MEL.", 
    "15": "The presence of resting sinus bradycardia (less than or equal to 45 bpm) with junctional escapes in an 8 year old child with catecholamine induced ventricular tachycardia, raised the problem of an underlying sinus node dysfunction. This was an important consideration bearing in mind the potential risk of the high dose betablocker therapy aggravating the sinus bradycardia. Electrophysiological studies showed pathological sinus node recovery times. Betablocker therapy did not aggravate the bradycardia, even after 6 months' treatment. A review of the literature showed the association of sinus bradycardia and catecholamine-induced ventricular tachycardia to be relatively common (39 p. 100). However, no mention was found of aggravation of this sinus bradycardia by betablocker therapy.", 
    "16": "Studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of celiprolol on alpha-adrenergic stimulation of dog saphenous vein rings (postsynaptic effect) and on catecholamine outflow from the dog coronary circulation during sympathetic nerve stimulation in vivo (presynaptic effect). In venous rings, celiprolol, 10(-6) to 10(-4) M, shifted the concentration-response curve to BHT 920 in a concentration-related manner, but had no effect on the response to methoxamine at concentrations less than 10(-4) M. During continuous stimulation of the right stellate ganglion, celiprolol, 1-10 mg/kg i.v., increased the catecholamine concentration in the coronary sinus, while decreasing heart rate. In contrast, propranolol did not affect catecholamine concentration but decreased heart rate, rauwolscine increased both catecholamine concentration and heart rate, and clonidine decreased both catecholamine concentration and heart rate. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that celiprolol possesses weak alpha 2-antagonist properties in addition to its beta 1-blocking activity.", 
    "17": "In some animal models, celiprolol, a cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, has been reported to relax bronchial smooth muscle, an activity unique for this class of compound. Mechanistic studies with isolated cat tracheal rings and peripheral lung strips from guinea-pigs indicated that this relaxing activity could not be explained by competitive antagonism of serotonin receptors, beta- or alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, or histamine1-, leukotriene- or prostaglandin F2 alpha-receptors. Furthermore, this activity could not be explained by stimulation of beta-adrenergic or histamine2-receptors, nor can it be explained by a nonselective relaxing activity such as via the inhibition of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases. Serotonin-induced contractions of isolated tracheal rings seem to involve a secondary process which could be the unmasking of alpha 2-adrenoceptors. It is this secondary process which appears to be affected by celiprolol; i.e. celiprolol could be a weak but selective antagonist of alpha 2-adrenoceptors associated with serotonin receptors.", 
    "18": "Chronotropic effects of histamine and dimaprit were studied in the conscious dog with chronic atrioventricular block. Histamine at 0.2-5 micrograms/kg and dimaprit at equimolar doses (i.e. 0.25-6.25 micrograms/kg) increased atrial rate dose-relatedly. Blockade of muscarinic receptors reduced these effects and simultaneous blockade of muscarinic and beta-adrenergic receptors abolished them. Histamine and dimaprit moderately increased ventricular rate. Blockade of muscarinic receptors did not modify these effects, but blockade of beta-adrenoceptors with or without simultaneous blockade of muscarinic receptors suppressed them. After blockade of beta-adrenoceptors, histamine and more rarely dimaprit sometimes decreased atrial and ventricular rates. These effects were prevented by additional muscarinic blockade. Histamine and dimaprit lowered mean blood pressure to the same degree before and after each antagonist. The positive chronotropic effects of histamine and dimaprit, at these doses, are probably reflex responses to their hypotensive effects. The negative chronotropic effects of histamine after pindolol are due to muscarinic receptor activation. No evidence was found to implicate histamine-specific receptors in any of the chronotropic effects of histamine and dimaprit.", 
    "19": "The involvement of a catecholaminergic mechanism in the production of morphine analgesia and the development of tolerance to the effect has been suggested. Here, using various adrenergic blockers, the role of adrenergic function in the mechanism was examined. Phentolamine (alpha 1 + alpha 2-blocker, 10, 1 and 0.5 mg/kg), prazosin (alpha 1-blocker, 0.1 and 0.02 mg/kg), propranolol (beta 1 + beta 2-blocker, 10, 1 and 0.5 mg/kg), metoprolol (beta 1-blocker, 10 and 1 mg/kg) did not affect morphine analgesia, but dose-dependently suppressed the development of tolerance to morphine. Yohimbine (alpha 2-blocker, 5 and 1 mg/kg) dose-dependently antagonized morphine analgesia in naive animals and delayed the development of tolerance to morphine. Pindolol (beta 1 + beta 2-blocker but is devoid of membrane stabilizing activity) suppressed the development of tolerance to morphine analgesia; however, d-propranolol, which possesses membrane stabilizing activity but lacks beta-blocking activity, could not prevent the development of tolerance. Thus, the suppressive effect of propranolol on the development of tolerance is not due to membrane stabilizing properties. Not only the non-selective adrenergic blockers, phentolamine and propranolol, but also the selective blockers of each receptor subtype, prazosin and metoprolol, suppressed the development of tolerance. This fact may suggest the importance of the equilibrated state of adrenergic functions in the mechanism for the development of tolerance to morphine.", 
    "20": "The effects of beta-blocker therapy with either nadolol or propranolol were compared during therapy with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 50 mg b.i.d. on glomerular filtration rate (GFR), effective renal plasma flow (ERPF), effective renal blood flow (ERBF), blood pressure, and heart rate in 22 patients with essential hypertension and mild to moderate renal insufficiency. The clearances of inulin and para-aminohippurate (PAH) were used to estimate renal hemodynamic measurements. These parameters were determined after 2 weeks of HCTZ plus placebo and at 1, 3, and 6 months after the addition of beta-blocker to HCTZ. Significant reductions in blood pressure and heart rate were seen, but no significant reduction of renal hemodynamics were seen with either beta-blocker-HCTZ combination. Since 50% of the patients in each drug group were either Black or White, hemodynamic data were also analyzed by race. One month after beta-blocker addition there was a slight reduction of GFR in both Whites (47 +/- 6 vs. 40 +/- 5 ml/min, p greater than .05) and Blacks (44 +/- 5 vs. 40 +/- 6 ml/min, p less than .05). By month 6, GFR in Whites rose to 57 +/- 9 ml/min, whereas in Blacks it fell significantly to 36 +/- 6 ml/min (p less than .01). Similarly, at month 1, ERBF declined by 12% and 13% in Whites and Blacks, respectively. However, at month 6, ERBF rose by 28% in Whites and remained 11% lower in Blacks, p less than .05. In summary, in the group as a whole neither beta-blocker significantly altered renal hemodynamics when added to HCTZ therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "21": "The role of the alpha-adrenergic system in the control of pancreatic A and B cell function was investigated in an isolated perfused rat pancreas model. Two experimental procedures were performed. In the first one we evaluated the effects of two distinct concentrations (10(-8) M and 10(-7) M) of five adrenergic substances, with varying degrees of potency on the alpha-adrenergic presynaptic receptor, on insulin (IRI) and glucagon (IRG) release induced by arginine (20 mM) plus glucose (6.6 mM). In the second procedure we studied the effects of the two alpha-blocking agents yohimbine (alpha 2-blocker) and prazosin (alpha 1-blocker) at 10(-7) M on epinephrine-modulated IRI and IRG response to the same combined metabolic stimulus. The inhibitory activity on basal and metabolically induced IRI secretion of the agonists was superimposable on their potency on the presynaptic alpha 2-adrenergic receptors. Similarly, the alpha 1-blocking agent prazosin was less effective than the alpha 2-blocker yohimbine in counteracting the inhibitory effects of epinephrine on basal and arginine plus glucose-induced insulin release. The alpha-cell activity was clearly stimulated by epinephrine, whereas selective alpha-adrenergic drugs showed no significant action on IRG secretion. Both alpha-blockers were ineffective on basal IRG release, while they had some potentiating effect on the epinephrine-induced glucagon release in basal state and during the metabolic stimulus, without a significant difference between the two drugs. We conclude that, at least in the isolated perfused rat pancreas, alpha 2-adrenergic receptors are involved in the inhibition of IRI release induced by catecholamines. On the contrary, the alpha-adrenergic system does not seem to play an essential role in the regulation of IRG secretion; the potentiation of the epinephrine-induced stimulation of A cell function by the alpha-adrenergic blockade could be accounted for by a greater availability of the catecholamine at the beta-receptor binding sites.",

By \"noise,\" we mean an internally experienced state of crowding and confusion created by a variety of stimuli, the quantity, intensity and unpredictability of which make it difficult for individuals so afflicted to tolerate and organize their experience. Attempts to do so may only add to confusion and psychotic phenomena.", 
    "23": "A study was conducted to investigate the influence of a vasodilating beta receptor blocking substance on IOP in eyes with open-angle glaucoma. The study proceeded from the hypothesis that throttling of the production of aqueous humor by beta blockers and reduction of intraocular pressure is caused by vasoconstriction of the afferent vessels. The authors found that the degree of reduction of intraocular pressure corresponded to the effect of beta blockers routinely applied in glaucoma therapy. However, the duration of the effect was shorter. The above-mentioned hypothesis would thus seem to be disproved.", 
    "24": "Immediate post-receptor events following alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation in cardiac ventricular muscle are still largely unknown. Since membrane redox systems appear to be present in cell plasma membranes and may be involved in trans-sarcolemma electron efflux, the possibility that Ca2+ inflow was controlled by electron efflux was explored. Electron efflux was measured by monitoring the rate of reduction of extracellular ferricyanide (a non-permeant anion) and compared with changes in contractility of the perfused heart as an indirect assessment of altered cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration. Alpha-agonists significantly increased the rate of ferricyanide reduction by approx. 42%. Activation was dose- and time-dependent and closely accompanied changes in contractility either when the alpha-agonist was added or removed. Perfusion of the heart with sufficient Ca2+ chelating agent to prevent beating, did not affect the rate of ferricyanide reduction, but amplified the stimulatory effect of methoxamine on this rate. Kinetic assessment indicated that alpha-agonists led to an increase in the number of electron efflux sites in the ventricular sarcolemma. Neither diacyl glycerol nor the Ca2+ ionophone A23187 or a combination of the two had any effect on electron efflux rates. It is proposed that alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation promotes Ca2+ entry into the heart cell by directly activating the rate of electron efflux. An accompanying outward release of protons from localized regions of the sarcolemma (Ca2+ channels?) may then facilitate a 1-for-2 inward movement of Ca2+.",

    "26": "Hypoglycemia is frequently reported in hemodialysis patients on propranolol. The effects of beta-blockers on the glucose, alanine and free fatty acid responses to glucagon challenge (2 mg) in fourteen hemodialysis patients were studied. Patients on propranolol had impaired glycemic response while those on metoprolol had decreased response only before dialysis. There was a significant negative correlation between propranolol level (log-transformed) and glycemic responses, suggesting that propranolol has direct effect on the latter. Hemodialysis patients had fasting alanine levels comparable to those of normal subjects. After glucagon challenge, the decrements in alanine level had no consistent relationship to the impaired glycemic response. Thus suppression of gluconeogenesis is unlikely to be the prime cause of propranolol-induced hypoglycemia. The basal free fatty acid levels were significantly lower among hemodialysis patients on propranolol. This limited availability of free fatty acid as well as the inhibitory effect on hepatic glucagon-stimulated glucose output may contribute to the predisposition to hypoglycemia in dialysis patients given propranolol. The results suggest that metoprolol has less interference on energy substrate supply in hemodialysis patients under fasting conditions.", 
    "27": "Immediately after the first signs and symptoms of acute myocardial infarction are detected, its prognosis is determined by the size of the area at risk, the availability of collaterals and the time at which interventions are carried out. Preservation of as much myocardial tissue as possible is the key issue. Relief of obstruction of the thrombosed nutrient artery and reperfusion of the myocardium in jeopardy within 4 hours after onset of symptoms can lead to limitation of the ultimate infarct size, maintained ventricular function and a marked reduction of the first year mortality. Early supportive therapy with beta-blockade and calcium antagonists may enhance this effect. Recent data published on 533 patients randomized to either a reperfusion strategy or to conventional therapy, combined with those from the recent literature on thrombolysis and early beta blockade, provide the basis for this point of view. Once infarction is unavoidable and in the process of consolidation, supportive therapy is recommended. This still can change the outcome by timely correction of electrical instability, normalization of afterload and heart-rate, and the avoidance of secondary complications such as peripheral thrombosis. To determine the best course after recovery from the infarction, a symptom limited bicycle stress test, radionuclide ventriculography and 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiogram at the time of discharge were compared in predicting one year survival in 351 hospital survivors. A history of previous myocardial infarction or of heart failure during the current episode proved to be the strongest clinical predictor of early death.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "28": "The effect of (+/-)-propranolol and some related drugs have been investigated on the cholinesterase (ChE) enzyme activity of heart and brain tissues of the rat. Brain homogenates hydrolysed more methacholine than benzoylcholine and the reverse was true for the heart tissue. In-vitro, (+/-)-, (+)- and (-)-propranolol, as well as its quaternary analogue, UM-272, all significantly inhibited heart and brain ChE. Timolol and sotalol, however, were less potent. In-vivo, (+/-)-propranolol (30 mumol kg-1) significantly inhibited brain ChE activity in rats when compared with saline controls. It is inferred that propranolol inhibits brain and heart ChE enzyme in a non-stereoselective manner and that this cholinomimetic action could be involved in the mediation of some of its therapeutic effects.", 
    "29": "The basic pharmacokinetics of bisoprolol were investigated in three independent studies involving 23 healthy volunteers. After administering 20 mg of 14C-bisoprolol orally, mean elimination half-lives of 11 hours for the unchanged drug and 12 hours for total radioactivity were observed. The enteral absorption of bisoprolol was nearly complete. Fifty percent of the dose was eliminated renally as unchanged bisoprolol and the other 50% metabolically, with subsequent renal excretion of the metabolites. Less than 2% of the dose was recovered from the feces. Intraindividual comparison of the pharmacokinetic data measured after oral and intravenous administration of 10 mg bisoprolol to 12 subjects yielded an absolute bioavailability of 90%. Total and renal clearance were calculated as 15.6 L/hr and 9.6 L/hr, respectively. The volume of distribution was 226 L. Concomitant food intake did not influence the bioavailability of bisoprolol.", 
    "30": "The drugs currently under investigation in the prevention of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding in cirrhosis are likely to decrease the portal pressure by means of a primary reduction of portal blood flow. The hemodynamic effects of beta-blocking agents and vasodilatory drugs were noninvasively measured in eight patients with cirrhosis by means of pulsed echo-doppler equipment. Portal caliber, blood velocity and flow were recorded hourly after a single dose of propranolol (40 mg p.o.) or atenolol (100 mg p.o.), and every 5 min after treatment with isosorbide dinitrate (5 mg sublingually). The drugs were administered at random with an interval of 2 days or more. The portal caliber decreased after atenolol, but did not change after propranolol and isosorbide. The blood velocity decreased by 29 +/- 2% 3 hr after propranolol, by 26 +/- 2% 3 hr after atenolol and by 31 +/- 3% 15 min after isosorbide. The portal blood flow decreased by 0.29 +/- 0.03 liters per min after propranolol, by 0.34 +/- 0.06 after atenolol and by 0.26 +/- 0.03 after isosorbide, without any difference among the various treatments. beta-blockers and vasodilatory drugs have comparable effects on portal blood flow. beta 1-selective and nonselective beta-blockers are similarly effective in keeping with the hypothesis that changes in portal blood flow are mainly due to the block of beta 1-receptors.", 
    "31": "The suggestion that beta blockers can reduce mortality is not in dispute, nor is the undoubted clinical value of this important group of drugs. What must however be questioned is whether these beneficial effects can be, or need be, explained by 'infarct size limitation'.", 
    "32": "This review article deals with the role of beta blockade in the limitation of infarct development. A large number of studies have reported that early administration of beta blockers limits infarct size in animals. In a few, however, these results were not reconfirmed. In man, several large randomized trials have shown that early administration of beta blockade limits infarct development judged from serum enzyme activity and ECG recordings. Delay time between the onset of symptoms and start of treatment is of major importance. It appears as though patients with a higher initial rate pressure product respond most favourably. Although these results are encouraging, the role of infarct limitation in relation to effects on early mortality, chest pain and arrhythmias have not been clearly defined.", 
    "33": "Hypertension is the single commonest cause of maternal mortality, but prompt and effective treatment with a variety of drugs, some more familiar than others, can reduce the risk of both maternal and fetal death.", 
    "34": "The effects of single oral doses of atenolol 50 mg and xamoterol 200 mg (a recently developed partial beta 1-adrenoceptor agonist) on lung function, heart rate and blood pressure were investigated in 11 patients with asthma. Xamoterol caused a significant increase in heart rate and systolic blood pressure, which changes are consistent with the partial beta 1-adrenoceptor agonist activity of this drug. Atenolol induced a significant decrease in FEV1 and the forced vital capacity (FVC); there was a non-significant change in FEV1 and FVC after xamoterol. There was no significant difference between the effects of atenolol and xamoterol of FEV1 and FVC. Bronchospasm induced by atenolol 50 mg and xamoterol 200 mg was completely reversed by inhalation of the beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist terbutaline to a cumulative dose of 4.0 mg.", 
    "35": "Observations were made in eight subjects who exercised before and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 h after the double-blind oral administration of placebo, bufuralol 7.5, 15, 30, 60 and 120 mg and propranolol 40 and 160 mg. The exercise heart rate remained constant after placebo. Bufuralol 7.5 mg and propranolol 40 mg reduced exercise heart rate up to 6 and 8 h respectively after dosing but bufuralol 15, 30, 60 and 120 mg and propranolol 160 mg were still active at 24 h. The lowest exercise heart rate occurred at 2 h after all active treatments. Bufuralol 60 and 120 mg produced similar reduction in exercise tachycardia as propranolol 40 mg but less than propranolol 160 mg. Plasma levels of bufuralol and its two major metabolites were measured. The peak plasma concentrations of bufuralol occurred at 1.5 h after 7.5 mg and at 2 h after the other doses of bufuralol. In six subjects the plasma elimination half-life of bufuralol was 2.61 +/- 0.18 h and in the other three subjects 4.85 +/- 0.35 h. There was a corresponding longer time to peak concentration and plasma elimination half-life of the two metabolites in these three subjects. These findings show that bufuralol is a potent beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with partial agonist activity. It has a long duration of action and there is bimodal metabolism of the drug in man.", 
    "36": "A multicentre, double blind, placebo controlled, randomised trial of nifedipine, metoprolol, and nifedipine and metoprolol combined was conducted in a group of 338 patients with unstable angina not pretreated with a beta blocker and of nifedipine in 177 patients pretreated with a beta blocker. The main outcome event was recurrent ischaemia or myocardial infarction within 48 hours. Trial medication effects were expressed as ratios of event rates relative to placebo. In patients not pretreated with a beta blocker the event rate ratios with associated 95% confidence intervals were 1.15 (0.83, 1.64) for nifedipine, 0.76 (0.49, 1.16) for metoprolol, and 0.80 (0.53, 1.19) for nifedipine and metoprolol combined. In patients already on a beta blocker the addition of nifedipine was beneficial (rate ratio 0.68 (0.47, 0.97). Equal numbers of patients developed myocardial infarction and reversible ischaemia. Most infarctions occurred early, within six hours of randomisation. In patients not already on a beta blocker the nifedipine rate ratio for infarction only was 1.51 (0.87, 2.74). These results suggest that in patients not on previous beta blockade metoprolol has a beneficial short term effect on unstable angina, that fixed combination with nifedipine provides no further gain, and that nifedipine may be detrimental. On the other hand, the addition of nifedipine to existing beta blockade when the patient's condition becomes unstable seems beneficial.", 
    "37": "Eleven patients with hyperadrenergic diabetic postural hypotension and vagal neuropathy were treated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study with different beta-agonists and antagonists. A single dose of the beta 2-agonist terbutaline (5 mg) and the beta 1 + 2-agonist orciprenaline (10 mg) did not reduce the fall in systolic pressure on standing up, despite a significant increase in both supine and standing heart rates. The beta 1-antagonist with intrinsic sympathicomimetic activity (ISA) acebutolol (200 mg) and the beta 1-antagonist metoprolol (50 mg) did not influence the fall in systolic pressure either, despite a significant decrease in supine and standing heart rates and disappearance of increase in heart rate on standing up. Only the beta 1 + 2-antagonist propranolol and the beta 1 + 2-antagonist with ISA pindolol (5 mg) could significantly reduce or practically abolish the fall in systolic and diastolic pressure on standing up. This was accompanied by a slight decrease of heart rates and disappearance of difference between supine and standing heart rates, as seen with the other beta-antagonists. Thus, only beta 2-blockade reduced or abolished the fall in systolic pressure on standing up in our patients. These data were confirmed by a three-week crossover trial in 10 of these patients.", 
    "38": "Indenolol, a relatively new beta-adrenergic blocking drug, was tested for its effect on the central nervous system. The parameters included its effects on spontaneous motor activity, conditioned avoidance response (CAR) acquisition, pentobarbitone hypnosis, amphetamine induced motor excitation, analgesic activity and rectal temperature in experimental animals. Indenolol was found to significantly decrease the spontaneous motor activity in mice and CAR acquisition in rats. It potentiated the pentobarbitone induced hypnosis and antagonized amphetamine induced excitatory behaviour in mice. It did not show a marked analgesic effect of its own but potentiated the analgesia induced by the subanalgesic dose of morphine. It also produced a significant hypothermic effect in mice. All the effects except on CAR acquisition were obtained in the dose of 50-75 mg/kg body weight administered intraperitoneally. It enhanced CAR acquisition in the specific dose of 5 mg/kg. These observations indicate that indenolol possesses an anxiolytic effect similar to that reported for propranolol and some other beta-blocking drugs.", 
    "39": "Replacement of the catecholic hydroxyl groups of the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist 6,7-dihydroxy-1-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (trimetoquinol) with chloro substituents results in a compound with marked beta-adrenoceptor antagonist properties. This, therefore, parallels the similar transformation of the beta-adrenoreceptor agonist isoproterenol into the antagonist dichloroisoproterenol. In a test for inhibition of isoproterenol-induced enhancement of the rate of contraction of spontaneously beating guinea pig atrial pairs the resultant 6,7-dichloro-1-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (6b) had a KB value of (6.7 +/- 2.3) X 10(-8) M. Although this is nearly 2 orders of magnitude less potent than propranolol (KB = 6.2 X 10(-10) M in this test), this compound represents the prototype of a new class of beta-adrenergic receptor blockers, and unlike dichloroisoproterenol it is not a partial agonist. It has physicochemical properties, e.g., pKa and distribution and partition coefficients, that differ from the prototypic beta-blockers. These altered properties might impart advantageous tissue distribution and altered pharmacological properties to the new molecule. This new beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist is suggested to merit further study.", 
    "40": "Drugs that have been associated with the precipitation or exacerbation of psoriasis include lithium, beta adrenergic receptor blocking agents, and antimalarials. The withdrawal of corticosteroids has been reported to activate pustular psoriasis. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as indomethacin, have recently been reported to exacerbate psoriasis, although additional well-controlled studies are still needed. Drugs used for treatment of psoriasis will sometimes cause a flare because of irritation, phototoxicity, or hypersensitivity reaction resulting in a Koebner phenomenon. Because psoriasis is a very complex disease and its activity is often unpredictable, clinical studies on adverse drug effects on psoriasis have been difficult to conduct. This review evaluates clinical, histologic, and biochemical evidence in the literature for drug-associated onset or exacerbation of psoriasis.", 
    "41": "The dose-response curves of the central and peripheral airways to intravenously injected nicotine were studied in 55 anesthetized dogs. With intact vagi, nicotine caused a dose-dependent increase in central airway resistance (Rc) similar to the increase in peripheral airway resistance (Rp) at concentrations ranging from 4 to 64 micrograms/kg. However, the responses of both Rc and Rp fell progressively when sequential doses of nicotine greater than 256 micrograms/kg were administered. With intact vagi and the administration of propranolol, there was a greater increase in Rp than in Rc at a nicotine dose of 64 micrograms/kg (P less than 0.05). With vagotomy, the responsiveness of both central and peripheral airways to nicotine decreased with doses of nicotine less than 64 micrograms/kg, but with doses of nicotine greater than 256 micrograms/kg the suppressive effect of nicotine on both Rc and Rp was less than that seen with intact vagi. Under conditions in which the vagi were cut and atropine administered, the responsiveness of nicotine was even further depressed. Combinations either of atropine and chlorpheniramine or atropine and phenoxybenzamine also completely blocked reactions to nicotine. Additionally reactions to nicotine were completely blocked by hexamethonium. These results suggest that nicotine increases both Rc and Rp mainly through a vagal reflex and stimulation of the parasympathetic ganglia.", 
    "42": "The binding characteristics of the beta-adrenergic receptor in the rat ventral prostate homogenate have been studied using the highly potent beta-adrenergic antagonist [125I]cyanopindolol (CYP) as ligand. The bound ligand was separated from the free moiety by precipitation with polyethylene glycol (PEG-6000). This technique is simple, accurate, fast and more advantageous than filtration of the hormone-receptor complex on glass fiber filters or direct centrifugation. [125I]CYP binds to a single class of high affinity sites at an apparent KD value of 23 pM. Using 0.1 microM (-)propranolol to determine non-specific binding, a number of sites of 600 fmol/mg protein were measured. The observed order of potency of adrenergic agonists (KD values) in competing for [125I]CYP binding was: (-)isoproterenol (25 nM) greater than (-)epinephrine (74 nM) much greater than (-)norepinephrine (1900 nM). Detailed study of the binding potency of a large series of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic agonists and antagonists showed the presence of a typical beta 2-subtype adrenergic receptor in the rat ventral prostate. The best estimate indicates that the proportion of beta 2-adrenergic receptors in rat ventral prostate is more than 95% of the total population of beta-adrenergic receptors in this tissue. The high selectivity and density of beta 2-adrenergic receptors in rat ventral prostate suggest a physiological role of circulating and/or locally secreted catecholamines in the control of prostatic growth and function.", 
    "43": "Investigations into the mechanisms and characteristics of ischemic heart disease have increasingly documented evidence of myocardial ischemia in the absence of symptoms. Recent work using objective criteria of ischemic episodes confirmed that angina pectoris or its equivalents need not accompany myocardial ischemia and noted that these episodes appear to be quite common. The impact on prognosis awaits further study, but preliminary data suggest an adverse prognosis for patients with recurrent spontaneous silent vasoconstrictive ischemia. Furthermore, treatment of silent ischemic episodes with nitrates may be associated with reduced ischemia. Preliminary trials show reduction of the number, duration, and magnitude of silent ischemic episodes by transdermal nitroglycerin given to patients receiving beta-blockers. Therapy of acute ischemic syndromes should be designed to eliminate ischemia completely, not merely ameliorate pain.", 
    "44": "A patient with a longstanding history of mild hypertension undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting exhibited extreme and paroxysmal elevations of systemic blood pressure immediately after separation from cardiopulmonary bypass. Conventional antihypertensive therapy (nitroprusside, hydralazine, propranolol) was ineffective, whereas phentolamine infusion produced a decrease in systemic blood pressure. These observations led to the discovery of a predominantly norepinephrine-secreting phaeochromocytoma. This case is noteworthy in that cardiopulmonary bypass may have served as a stimulus for tumour secretion of catecholamine. Possible mechanisms for this effect are discussed.", 
    "45": "Beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptor radioligand antagonist binding activities in plasma membrane preparations from mammalian lung, as well as amphibian and avian red blood cells, have been shown to be inactivated by agents which specifically alkylate tyrosine. In membrane preparations, protection against inactivation was afforded by both agonists and antagonists. In soluble purified preparations, antagonists but not agonists protected against inactivation. These results suggest that tyrosine is located at or near the ligand binding site of both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "46": "The beta-adrenergic receptors of immature rabbit bone marrow erythroid cells (proerythroblasts and basophilic erythroblasts) were identified. [125I]iodocyanopindolol bound to membrane preparations derived from these erythroblasts in a rapid, reversible and saturable manner. Scatchard analysis of binding data revealed a single class of binding sites (Hill coefficient of 0.954) with an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 8 pM, and a density of binding sites (Bmax) of 1.53 pM/10(6) cells, corresponding to 920 receptors per cell. The binding of [125I]iodocyanopindolol was inhibited stereospecifically by concentrations of (-)-propranolol 2 orders of magnitude lower than by the (+)-isomer. Only L-isoprenaline and L-adrenaline activated the adenylate cyclase of immature rabbit erythroblasts, while L-noradrenaline, a beta 1-adrenergic agonist, was inactive. The order of potency of different agonists for displacement of bound [125I]iodocyanopindolol was: isoprenaline greater than adrenaline greater than noradrenaline with respective EC50 (concentration required for half maximal inhibition of binding) of 7.9 X 10(-7) M, 1.5 X 10(-5) M and 7.9 X 10(-5) M. This agonist potency series did not change with differentiation of rabbit bone marrow erythroblasts. The inhibition of specific [125I]iodocyanopindolol binding to immature cells by beta 1- and beta 2-selective drugs (noradrenaline, practolol, procaterol and butoxamine) resulted in linear Hofstee plots. The inhibition curves obtained with procaterol and butoxamine, with apparent Kd values of 3.1 X 10(-9) M and 4.9 X 10(-9) M, further evidence that the high-affinity binding sites correspond to a homogeneous beta 2-receptor subtype.", 
    "47": "We measured serum lipid and lipoprotein levels in 63 insulin-dependent diabetic (IDD) patients (32 men, 31 women) and in 63 nondiabetic control subjects (32 men, 31 women) without coronary heart disease (CHD) and in 19 IDD patients (11 men, 8 women) and in 18 nondiabetic subjects (8 men, 10 women) with CHD. All diabetic patients had postglucagon C-peptide levels of less than 0.60 mmol/liter and none had signs of renal failure. Male IDD patients with CHD had higher levels of total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, total triglycerides, very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglycerides and lower level of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol than male IDD patients without CHD. In female IDD patients, similar lipid and lipoprotein abnormalities were observed between the groups of diabetics with and without CHD except for total cholesterol, which was the same in both groups. A comparison between IDD patients without CHD and nondiabetic control subjects without CHD showed no difference in lipid and lipoprotein levels in males; female IDD patients without CHD showed even higher levels of HDL and HDL2 cholesterol and lower levels of VLDL triglycerides than nondiabetic controls. Our results indicate that in IDD patients without nephropathy and CHD, the lipid and lipoprotein levels do not differ from nondiabetic controls, but in IDD patients with CHD the lipid and lipoprotein pattern is similar to that known to be characteristic for nondiabetic patients with CHD.", 
    "48": "To assess the effects of beta-blockade on right ventricular performance in patients with and without right ventricular dysfunction due to coronary artery disease, we performed radionuclide ventriculography on eight patients with normal right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF greater than or equal to 35%) and 14 patients with mild to moderate right ventricular dysfunction (RVEF less than 35%) at rest. All patients had chronic stable angina pectoris, and nine patients had prior myocardial infarction. Radionuclide ventriculography was performed on placebo and during clinical beta-blockade (heart rate, 50 to 60 beats per minute and less than or equal to 20% increase in heart rate over baseline during stage I treadmill exercise, Bruce protocol) with the oral, cardioselective beta-blocking agent, betaxolol. The resting RVEF (mean +/- 1 SD) was 33% +/- 7% on placebo and 34% +/- 7% during clinical beta-blockade. Mean exercise RVEF was 40% +/- 8% on placebo and 39% +/- 8% during clinical beta-blockade. These differences were not statistically significant. Resting left ventricular ejection fraction ranged from 22% to 60% (mean, 42% +/- 8%). On placebo, one of eight patients with a resting RVEF greater than or equal to 35% had a normal exercise RVEF response (greater than or equal to 5% increment) whereas nine of 14 patients with resting RVEF less than 35% had normal exercise response. The discordant relationship between baseline RVEF and exercise response on placebo became less marked during clinical beta-blockade. We conclude that beta-blockade does not produce significant deterioration of right ventricular systolic function or right ventricular reserve either in patients with normal or in those with mild to moderately impaired resting right ventricular systolic function.", 
    "49": "The efficacy of carvedilol, a new vasodilating beta-blocking drug, was evaluated in 20 patients with chronic angina using a single-blind, placebo-controlled protocol. A 2-week placebo phase was followed by therapy with carvedilol, 25 mg twice daily for 2 weeks, after which the dose was doubled. There was then a second placebo phase lasting 2 weeks. Treadmill exercise testing, 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring and drug blood level assays were performed at the end of each phase. Exercise time (mean +/- standard error of mean) increased from 7.4 +/- 0.5 minutes during placebo to 9.0 +/- 0.5 minutes carvedilol, 25 mg twice daily (p less than 0.001), and to 9.2 +/- 0.4 minutes with 50 mg twice daily (p less than 0.001). Mean time to 1 mm of ST depression in both bipolar leads CM5 and CC5 increased significantly, but peak ST depression did not change. Heart rate at rest was reduced at both dose levels, from 86 +/- 4 beats/min during placebo to 70 +/- 2 beats/min with 25 mg twice daily (p less than 0.001) and to 67 +/- 3 beats/min with 50 mg twice daily (p less than 0.001). Systolic blood pressure at rest was significantly reduced at both doses (p less than 0.05; p less than 0.01), but blood pressure during exercise was decreased only with the larger dose (p less than 0.001). The exercise rate-pressure product was 182 +/- 9 with placebo and decreased to 153 +/- 5 with 25 mg twice daily (p less than 0.001) and to 138 +/- 6 with 50 mg twice daily (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "50": "Flestolol, a new ultrashort-acting (half-life 6.9 minutes) beta-blocking drug, was administered by intravenous infusion to 18 patients with new-onset atrial fibrillation or flutter and rapid ventricular response (120 beats/min or more for at least 30 minutes). Drug dose of flestolol was progressively increased until at least 1 of 3 endpoints was achieved: at least a 20% reduction in heart rate from baseline, heart rate 100 beats/min or less, or conversion to normal sinus rhythm. Flestolol was then administered as a maintenance infusion up to 24 hours. When flestolol was discontinued, patients were monitored for 1 additional hour. The mean ventricular response at baseline of 133 +/- 12 beats/min decreased to 103 +/- 20 beats/min at the end of flestolol titration (p less than 0.0001). Fourteen patients (78%) achieved defined endpoints. All 14 patients who continued to receive maintenance infusion had a sustained response. When flestolol was discontinued, ventricular response increased 33 +/- 23% within 60 minutes. The only adverse effect seen was hypotension in 2 patients. Flestolol is effective in slowing ventricular response in new-onset atrial fibrillation and flutter, maintains a therapeutic effect during continuous infusion and rapidly loses therapeutic effect when discontinued.", 
    "51": "Cardiorespiratory responses to graded treadmill tests administered 1 month after myocardial infarction or coronary bypass surgery and again after 4 weeks of aerobic training were compared in 24 patients taking beta blockers and 15 control patients. There were no significant differences before training between the groups in age, weight, ventricular ejection fraction, oxygen uptake (Vo2) during the fixed work load (1.7 mph/10% grade), Vo2 at the ventilatory threshold, or Vo2max. After training, Vo2max was significantly increased (p less than 0.05) by 16% in the beta-blocker group and by 21% in controls. However, the group taking beta blockers showed no significant change in oxygen pulse (Vo2/heart rate) at the fixed work load or at the ventilatory threshold, whereas the controls increased Vo2/heart rate at the fixed work load by 9% (p less than 0.05) and at the ventilatory threshold by 22% (p less than 0.05). Metabolic and ventilatory responses to submaximal exercise should therefore also be considered when evaluating the efficacy of exercise training in patients taking beta blockers.", 
    "52": "The most appropriate treatment for a patient with angina pectoris depends on the underlying pathophysiologic process and whether any associated illness is present. Each patient's clinical history must be carefully reviewed so the hemodynamic process responsible for the clinical picture is understood. If symptoms are produced mostly by an increase in myocardial oxygen demand, efforts should be directed toward reducing the demand or improving coronary blood flow to meet the demand. If symptoms appear to occur secondary to vasospasm, treatment should be directed toward relief of spasm with potent vasodilating agents, such as calcium channel blockers. Most patients have a clinical picture consistent with mixed angina and may require combination therapy. Treatment of associated illnesses and the safety of pharmacologic agents used in their presence should be carefully considered. Finally, if treatment is to successfully reduce the incidence of serious cardiac events and prolong life, the goal of therapy should be relief of the total ischemic burden on the heart.", 
    "53": "In the human lymphocyte, desensitization of the beta-adrenergic receptor-adenylate cyclase complex is associated with sequestration of the receptor as well as a change in photolabeling of beta-receptor proteins. Thus, desensitization of the lymphocyte beta-adrenergic receptor-adenylate cyclase system is associated with a selective reduction in the photoaffinity labeling of an Mr approximately equal to 55,000 beta-adrenergic receptor-binding site as compared to an Mr approximately equal to 68,000 beta-adrenergic receptor-binding moiety. In order to examine the relationship between sequestration and reduction in labeling of the Mr approximately equal to 55,000 peptide, we have studied the effect of phenylarsine oxide (an inhibitor of beta-receptor sequestration in astrocytoma cells) on agonist-induced desensitization of the beta-adrenergic receptor-adenylate cyclase system in circulating lymphocytes. Incubation of cells with phenylarsine oxide prior to exposure to agonists did not block the consequent reduction in isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. However, sequestration of the receptor, as assessed by a decrease in accessibility of beta-adrenergic receptors on intact cells to hydrophilic receptor ligands, is blocked by phenylarsine oxide. Thus, the agonist-induced reduction in binding of the hydrophilic beta-adrenergic receptor ligand CGP-12177 was blocked by phenylarsine oxide (without phenylarsine oxide, 57 +/- 6% of control, with phenylarsine oxide, 97 +/- 3% of control). Photolabeling studies with [125I]iodocyanopindolol diazirine revealed that phenylarsine oxide pretreatment also blocked the selective loss in labeling of the Mr approximately equal to 55,000 beta-adrenergic receptor protein. These data suggest that agonist-induced alterations in the photolabeling pattern of the lymphocyte beta-adrenergic receptor that occur with desensitization closely parallel the apparent sequestration of beta-adrenergic receptors but can be dissociated from the initial desensitization phenomenon.", 
    "54": "The mesovarian suspensory ligament of the rat was used to compare the activities of beta adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists. The following beta adrenoceptor agonists, in descending order of potency, inhibited spontaneous activity in a dose-related manner: zinterol greater than isoproterenol much greater than dobutamine. Several noncardioselective, beta-2 adrenoceptor antagonists with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) also inhibited the activity of the ligament: pindolol greater than alprenolol = bucindolol = oxprenolol greater than labetalol. Maximal relaxation induced by the antagonists was equivalent to that caused by the beta receptor agonists. Two cardioselective, beta adrenoceptor antagonists with ISA, acebutolol and practolol, did not inhibit the activity of the suspensory ligament but did increase the rate of the isolated right atrium of the rat. The maximal increases in atrial rate evoked by the antagonists were significantly less than those induced by the beta adrenoceptor agonists. Studies with ICI 118,551 or atenolol as beta-2 or beta-1 selective adrenoceptor blockers, respectively, suggest that the beta adrenoceptors of the suspensory ligament are predominantly of the beta-2 subtype. The possible relevance of these results to the induction of mesovarian leiomyomas in rats by noncardioselective beta adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists with ISA is discussed.", 
    "55": "The effects of stimulating beta adrenoceptors on lymphocytes during the generation of cell-mediated immunity were examined. In an in vitro system for the generation of murine cell-mediated cytotoxicity, addition of isoproterenol (10(-7) M), epinephrine (10(-6) M) or norepinephrine (10(-4) M) enhanced the number of lytic units generated compared to control cultures. This increase was blocked by dl-propranolol (5 X 10(-6) M). I-Propranolol (10(-11) to 10(-7) M) blocked the isoproterenol-induced increase in lytic units per culture, but d-propranolol (10(-11) to 10(-7) M) did not. Terbutaline (10(-5) M), a relatively selective beta-2 agonist, similarly augmented the generation of cell-mediated cytotoxicity, with the increase again blocked by propranolol. Butoxamine (5 X 10(-6) M), a beta-2 antagonist, but not atenolol (5 X 10(-6) M), a beta-1 antagonist, blocked the epinephrine-induced increase in cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Addition of phentolamine (5 X 10(-6) M) had no effect on the epinephrine-induced increase in lytic units per culture. However, in the presence of phentolamine, norepinephrine increased lytic units per culture to a greater degree than that seen with norepinephrine alone, suggesting a balance between positive beta effects and inhibitory alpha effects upon simultaneous alpha and beta stimulation. These data provide further evidence for an immunoenhancing role of beta receptor stimulation during the generation of immune responses.", 
    "56": "The mode of action of capsaicin on energy metabolism was investigated in rats. The oxygen consumption was higher when capsaicin (6.0 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected than when it was not injected. The respiratory quotient (R.Q.) increased and then decreased after the administration of capsaicin. The levels of serum glucose and immunoreactive insulin rapidly increased after the administration of capsaicin. Also, liver glycogen rapidly decreased, in contrast to the serum glucose concentration which rapidly increased. The serum-free fatty acid level gradually increased after the administration of capsaicin. These alterations in energy metabolism on the administration of capsaicin were similar to those in the metabolism of epinephrine, and were specifically inhibited by various beta-adrenergic blockers. On the other hand, the alterations were not affected by pretreatment with alpha-adrenergic or ganglion blockers. These results suggest that the mode of action of capsaicin on the enhancement of energy metabolism in rats comprises a direct (as an agonist) and/or an indirect (via catecholamine) beta-adrenergic action. Therefore, it was speculated that the adrenergic action of capsaicin resulted, at least in part, in a decrease in the perirenal adipose tissue weight and serum triglyceride concentration in rats fed a high fat diet supplemented with capsaicin (T. Kawada et al., J Nutr 116:1272-1278, 1986).", 
    "57": "A submaximal treadmill exercise test performed before hospital discharge after an uncomplicated myocardial infarction is often utilized to estimate prognosis and guide management, but there is little experience with a maximal exercise test performed 6 months after infarction to identify prognosis later in the convalescent period. The performance characteristics during an exercise test 6 months after myocardial infarction were related to the development of death, recurrent nonfatal myocardial infarction and coronary artery bypass surgery in the subsequent 12 months (that is, 6 to 18 months after infarction) in 473 patients. Mortality was significantly greater in patients who exhibited any of the following: inability to perform the exercise test because of cardiac limitations, the development of ST segment elevation of 1 mm or greater during the exercise test, an inadequate blood pressure response during exercise, the development of any ventricular premature depolarizations during exercise or the recovery period and inability to exercise beyond stage I of the modified Bruce protocol. By utilizing a combination of four high risk prognostic features from the exercise test, it was possible to stratify patients in terms of risk of mortality, from 1% if none of these features were present to 17% if three or four were present. Recurrent nonfatal myocardial infarction was predicted by an inability to perform the exercise test because of cardiac limitations, but not by any characteristics of exercise test performance. Coronary artery bypass surgery was associated with the development of ST segment depression of 1 mm or greater during the exercise test. Although clinical evidence of angina and heart failure 6 months after infarction was predictive of subsequent mortality among all survivors, among the low risk group without severely limiting cardiac disease, the exercise test provided unique prognostic information not available from clinical assessment alone. Therefore, a maximal exercise test performed 6 months after myocardial infarction is a valuable, noninvasive tool to evaluate prognosis. It provides information that is independent of and additive to clinical evaluation performed at the same time.", 
    "58": "We evaluated the amount of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors in human right and left atrium as well as in right and left ventricular wall obtained from heart transplant recipients who suffered from end-stage congestive cardiomyopathy. The total number of myocardial beta-adrenoceptors was assessed with the nonsubtype selective beta-adrenoceptor radioligand (-)[125I]iodocyanopindolol (ICYP); concomitantly, the number of beta 1-adrenoceptors was determined with the selective beta 1-adrenoceptor radioligand (-)[3H]bisoprolol. The number of beta 2-adrenoceptors was calculated by subtracting (-)[3H]bisoprolol binding sites from ICYP binding sites. With this technique, a beta 1/beta 2-ratio of approximately 65/35% for both atria and of approximately 75/25% for both ventricles was found. Identical results were obtained when the beta 1/beta 2-ratio was calculated indirectly by nonlinear regression analysis of competition curves of the selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist bisoprolol and the selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118,551 with ICYP binding. In addition, on atria and on ventricles, adenylate cyclase was activated by norepinephrine (presumably by beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation) and by procaterol (by beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation). It is concluded that in the human heart functional beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors coexist on both atria and both ventricles. In end-stage congestive cardiomyopathy, there appears to be a selective down-regulation of cardiac beta 1-adrenoceptors, whereas beta 2-adrenoceptors are obviously not affected. This may explain the beneficial effects of beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists in severe heart failure.", 
    "59": "The pharmacokinetic handling of the beta 1 selective adrenoceptor blocking drug, bevantolol, was studied in 12 healthy volunteers. After intravenous (i.v.) administration of 50 mg of the drug, there was a biexponential decline in plasma levels with a terminal elimination half life (t1/2) of 1.9 h (range 1.4-2.3 h) and a total apparent volume of distribution at equilibrium of 62 L. After oral administration of the same dose, the bioavailability averaged 57% (range 26-98%) and peak plasma levels varied over a threefold range. On average, less than 1% of the dose was eliminated unchanged in the urine, indicating that the clearance of the drug was accounted for almost entirely by metabolism. Plasma levels after oral dosing with food showed an average 75-min delay in achievement of peak plasma levels and an average 14% increase in the extent of bioavailability of the drug. A positive correlation (r = 0.79) existed between the logarithm of the plasma bevantolol level and the percentage of reduction in postexercise heart rate. A plasma drug level of approximately 200 ng/ml produced a 10% reduction in postexercise heart rate. Pharmacological studies using guinea pig atrial and tracheal tissue demonstrated that the beta-blocking potency and beta-selectivity of bevantolol were intermediate between those of metoprolol and atenolol.", 
    "60": "Twenty-six patients with different diseases of the myocardium complicated by ventricular extrasystole were studied by means of intermittent 24-hour ECG-monitoring using the \"Malysh\" apparatus. Control of treatment was performed on the 4th-6th day. Carbamazepine effect was observed in 2/3 of patients and significantly exceeded effects of obzidan and novocainamide. No direct relationship was revealed between pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic parameters of carbamazepine.", 
    "61": "Postjunctional alpha-adrenoceptors subserve positive inotropic and chronotropic responses. When beta-adrenoceptors are blocked, agonists that act on alpha 1-adrenoceptors evoke positive chronotropic responses in the pithed rat and rat isolated atria. The rank order of potency for this effect is adrenaline greater than noradrenaline greater than phenylephrine greater than methoxamine. The order of potency for antagonists to block the responses is prazosin greater than phentolamine greater than yohimbine. Thus, the postjunctional alpha-adrenoceptors are of the alpha 1-subtype. The positive chronotropic responses elicited by activating alpha 1-adrenoceptors have a slower time course than those elicited by activation of beta-adrenoceptors. When beta-adrenoceptors are blocked by propranolol, the positive chronotropic response to phenylephrine is enhanced by increasing the calcium concentration or by the calcium channel activator Bay K 8644 (0.1 microM), whereas the response is decreased by lowering the calcium concentration or by calcium antagonists (verapamil, nifedipine, nicardipine and diltiazem). Therefore, the positive chronotropic response to alpha 1-adrenoceptor activation involves an increased influx of calcium through calcium channels. Prejunctional alpha 1-adrenoceptors are involved in autoinhibitory feedback regulation of transmitter release from noradrenergic neurones. In rat atria, the release of noradrenaline induced by sympathetic nerve stimulation is inhibited by both clonidine and methoxamine, and is enhanced (by disruption of noradrenaline-mediated autoinhibition) by both idazoxan and prazosin. Thus, the prejunctional alpha-adrenoceptors are of both alpha 1- and alpha 2-subtypes. Drugs which produce blockade of postjunctional alpha 1-adrenoceptors could also produce an increase in neurogenic release of noradrenaline due to blockade of prejunctional alpha 1-adrenoceptors, and this might result in more complex effects than would be anticipated.", 
    "62": "Beta adrenergic receptor-mediated vascular smooth muscle relaxation decreases with increasing age. We have examined the mechanism responsible for this phenomenon using rat mesenteric arteries from young (5-6 weeks) and older (10-12 months) rats. The beta adrenergic agonist isoproterenol produced a dose-dependent relaxation of serotonin-constricted mesenteric artery rings from young rats, whereas the maximal ability of isoproterenol to relax arterial rings from the older rats was found to be reduced markedly (92.7 vs. 27.6%, P less than .0001). The relaxation responses caused by acetylcholine and nitroglycerin, which appear to act independently of cyclic AMP (cAMP), are similar in the two groups. The loss in responsiveness of the mesenteric artery to isoproterenol was not explained by a change in beta receptor number in the vessels (29 +/- 4 in young rats vs. 31 +/- 7 fmol/mg of protein in the older rats). The maximal stimulation of cAMP accumulation by isoproterenol was lower in the older vessels; forskolin activated cAMP accumulation equally in the two groups. However, the vessels from the older rats were less sensitive to forskolin-induced vascular relaxation. Also, the ability of dibutyryl cAMP to promote vascular relaxation was diminished in the older vessels. These data suggest that the diminished cAMP accumulation in older vessels in response to isoproterenol might not necessarily in itself explain completely the reduced physiological response and that an additional defect in the beta adrenergic-mediated relaxation in the vascular smooth muscle of older rats may lie at the level of cAMP-dependent protein kinase activation or more distally.", 
    "63": "The rat adipocyte contains two separate mechanisms for prostaglandin (PG) production. Norepinephrine stimulates prostacyclin (PGI2) and PGE2 production and triglyceride lipolysis in isolated rat adipocytes. In contrast, the vasoactive peptides angiotensin II, vasopressin, and bradykinin stimulate PGI2 production, but not PGE2 production or triglyceride lipolysis, in these cells. In this study, we characterized the two separate mechanisms of PG production with respect to the time course, the role of cAMP, the identity of the adrenergic receptor, and the effects of insulin and glucocorticoids. Angiotensin II stimulated PGI2 production rapidly (at 5 min) and independently of cAMP. beta-Adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol produced a rapid 11-fold increase in the cAMP concentration and stimulated PGI2 production more slowly (at 120 min). The phosphodiesterase inhibitor 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine (0.2 and 0.5 mM) and the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin (10 microM) also stimulated cAMP production rapidly and PGI2 production more slowly. 1-Methyl-3-isobutylxanthine (5.0 mM) further stimulated cAMP levels, but prevented the increase in PGI2 production and blunted the increase in glycerol release seen at lower concentrations. beta-Adrenergic blockade with propranolol or timolol completely inhibited the norepinephrine- or isoproterenol-stimulated production of PGI2 and triglyceride lipolysis, respectively. Insulin selectively inhibited isoproterenol-stimulated PGI2 production and triglyceride lipolysis at physiological concentrations, but had no effect on angiotensin II-stimulated PGI2 production. In contrast, dexamethasone inhibited PGI2 production induced by both isoproterenol and angiotensin II. We conclude that: angiotensin II stimulates PGI2 production rapidly and independently of cAMP, but isoproterenol stimulates PGI2 production more slowly, an effect that is cAMP dependent; insulin inhibits the cAMP-dependent beta-adrenergic stimulation of PGI2 production (and triglyceride lipolysis), but not the cAMP-independent angiotensin II-induced stimulation of PGI2 production (this suggests that the former effect is mediated by a decrease in cAMP levels in the adipocyte); and dexamethasone inhibits both mechanisms of PGI2 production. Both mechanisms of PGI2 production by rat adipocytes are exquisitely sensitive to hormonal regulation.", 
    "64": "High-performance liquid chromatographic methods using fluorimetric detection have been developed for the determination in plasma and urine of bisoprolol, atenolol, metoprolol and propranolol. Bisoprolol, metoprolol and propranolol were extracted at alkaline pH with dichloromethane, atenolol with n-butanol-dichloromethane (25:75). After evaporation of the organic solvent the compounds were chromatographed on silica gel Si-60 columns (normal phase) using aqueous ammonium phosphate buffer (pH 4) containing 3-7% acetonitrile as eluent (method 1). Alternatively, the compounds were acetylated prior to chromatography on reversed-phase columns (RP-8), using acetonitrile-water mixtures as eluents (method 2). The detection limit was 1-2 ng/ml in plasma and 10 ng/ml in urine for bisoprolol and metoprolol with either method. For atenolol the detection limit was 5 ng/ml in plasma or 50 ng/ml in urine (method 1), for propranolol 1 ng/ml in plasma (method 2).",

    "66": "Lowering the blood pressure to levels for which the arterial system has been designed should reduce various complications in the coronary and cerebral arteries, the heart, and the kidney. However, the antihypertensive treatment itself should not produce any significant damage. It is very likely that early modes of antihypertensive treatment did cause some biologic harm, which prevented the expected reduction in the incidence of coronary artery disease. However, the inability of these early forms of treatment to greatly improve coronary artery disease does not necessarily apply to treatments of the future.", 
    "67": "A randomized, multicentric, double blind study attempted to compare in 41 patients hospitalized for unstable angina, the efficacy of diltiazem (D) 240 mg/day, propranolol (P) 160 mg/day and molsidomine (M) 8 mg/day. The patients included in the study presented one or several spontaneous angina episodes accompanied by a transient and significant lowering of ST and/or an inverted T wave without necrosis. The evaluation criteria were the occurrence of new angina pain and electrical alterations on a continuous Holter for 5 days. 11 patients received diltiazem, 13 patients received propranolol and 15 patients received molsidomine (including an early death). Clinically, the number of painful episodes per day and per patient goes, in an average, from 1.2 to 0.23 diltiazem, from 2.2 to 0.44 for propranolol and from 2.2 to 0.45 for molsidomine. Pain disappeared on the 5th day in 54.5 per cent of patients under diltiazem, 58.8 per cent of patients under propranolol and 53.5 per cent of patients under molsidomine. Electrically, the number of ischemic accidents per day and per patient was 0.45 under diltiazem, 2.12 under propranolol (0.53 in excluding one patient with latent angina) and 0.81 under molsidomine. The number of patients without any ischemic accident was 63.6 per cent under diltiazem, 53.8 per cent under propranolol and 40 per cent under molsidomine. In conclusion, diltiazem, propranolol, and molsidomine have a comparable efficacy in unstable angina. The association of these medications could have a synergistic effect.", 
    "68": "We compared verapamil and propranolol hydrochloride for monotherapy of hypertension. Verapamil lowered blood pressure (BP) more effectively than propranolol in black and white patients. Verapamil was equally effective in blacks and whites, whereas propranolol was more effective in whites. Heart rate was reduced by 6.0 beats per minute by verapamil, and by 13.6 beats per minute by propranolol. In blacks, verapamil lowered systolic BP 16.9 vs 8.1 mm Hg for propranolol; verapamil reduced diastolic BP 12.8 vs 8.6 mm Hg for propranolol. In whites, verapamil lowered systolic BP 19.0 vs 12.7 mm Hg for propranolol; verapamil reduced diastolic BP 16.7 vs 12.3 mm Hg for propranolol. Increases in systolic BP were observed in 22% and 3.4% of patients receiving propranolol and verapamil, respectively. The PR interval was increased from 163.5 to 174.9 ms for verapamil vs 160.3 to 164.4 ms for propranolol. Constipation (15%) and headaches (10%) were most frequent complaints for verapamil vs fatigue (18%) and dizziness (7%) for propranolol. Changes in blood biochemistry values were of small magnitude. We conclude that verapamil monotherapy is a safe and effective means of achieving BP control in patients with essential hypertension.", 
    "69": "Unstable angina is a common ischemic syndrome that is characterized by chest pain occurring at rest often with transient ischemic electrocardiographic changes. Although most patients with unstable angina experience relief of pain with intensive medical therapy while in the coronary care unit, they subsequently have a high incidence of unfavorable cardiac events usually occurring within several months. Continuous electrocardiographic monitoring for ischemia has demonstrated a relatively high incidence of ischemic episodes both in patients with stable and unstable angina pectoris. The prognostic importance of such findings has been previously uncertain. The prognostic significance of silent myocardial ischemia in patients with unstable angina receiving intensive medical therapy has been addressed in a study of hospitalized patients in a coronary care unit. All patients were treated with nitrates, nifedipine, and propranolol. Continuous two-channel electrocardiographic monitoring was performed during the first two days of medical therapy. The electrocardiographic recordings were interpreted blindly for frequency and duration of ischemic changes, and these episodes were determined to be either symptomatic or silent. The prevalence of silent ischemic episodes, their prognostic significance, their contribution to the total ischemic burden, and the effects of different medical regimens on these variables are discussed.", 
    "70": "Calcium channel blocking agents function as negative inotropic agents when they are administered in vitro directly to the myocardium. In patients with coronary artery disease, however, such direct effects are attenuated by a number of other factors, including decreased afterload and resultant reflex sympathetic stimulation, increased coronary blood flow with improved myocardial perfusion, and protection of mitochondria. Nifedipine has not been observed to cause significant left ventricular depression in patients with angina pectoris; this is primarily due to peripheral arteriolar vasodilatation, which reduces impedance of left ventricular ejection. In addition, the relief of myocardial ischemia by nifedipine plays a major role in improving systolic and diastolic function. The clinical response to calcium channel blockers may differ in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, for whom the factor of fluctuating ischemia is less important.", 
    "71": "Although beta blockers are effective for the treatment of angina pectoris, chronic adverse effects produced by these agents--including lethargy, fatigue, and male impotence--can adversely affect patient acceptance and treatment compliance. To assess the clinical effects of switching from anti-anginal treatment with beta blocker only (phase I) to half-dose beta blocker plus the calcium blocker nifedipine (phase II) or nifedipine alone (phase III), 18 patients with chronic stable angina pectoris and side effects to beta blockers were evaluated in a 12-week, open-label trial. Three patients did not complete the study, one secondary to new unstable angina and two secondary to nifedipine side effects. Of the 15 patients completing the trial (13 men and two women; mean age, 54 +/- 5 [SEM] years), all sequentially participated in the one-month phases. Weekly angina frequency assessed from patient diaries was significantly less for treatment with nifedipine only (phase III) as compared with beta blocker (phase I) (1.7 +/- 1 versus 3.9 +/- 1 episodes per week), while phase II was not significantly different. Exercise test time was maintained throughout all phases (phase I, 457 +/- 39; phase II, 458 +/- 40; and phase III, 498 +/- 48 seconds, p not significant). All 15 patients in phase I (100 percent) had side effects to beta blockers, but these side effects were lessened in 12 patients (80 percent) in phase II and 13 patients (86 percent) in phase III, with total alleviation of symptoms in two patients (13 percent) in phase II, and eight patients (53 percent) in phase III. Thus, in patients with side effects to beta blockers, switching to nifedipine is associated with a significant reduction in beta blocker adverse symptoms and equal anti-anginal efficacy.", 
    "72": "The concept of the total ischemic burden includes all types of ischemia encompassing both silent and symptomatic ischemic episodes. This concept is currently causing a re-evaluation of current therapeutic goals for patients with coronary heart disease. Although the mechanism of cardiac pain is still unclear, we do have some information about other pathophysiologic mechanisms at work in this disorder. We think of ischemia as occurring secondary to reduced supply (primary ischemia), increased demand (secondary ischemia), or a combination of the two (mixed ischemia). Because of the lower heart rate associated with many episodes of ischemia during everyday activities, suggesting that vasoconstriction is playing a role in the patient's supply/demand imbalance, calcium antagonists appear to be particularly useful agents for the treatment of vasoconstriction in patients with angina.", 
    "73": "The role of the central noradrenergic system in the supraoptic neuroendocrine regulation was investigated using slices of the guinea pig hypothalamus. Noradrenaline produced a complex membrane effect comprising two distinct depolarizations: one, associated with a moderate increase in input resistance and resulting in an augmentation of the spontaneous firing rate; the other, unaccompanied by a detectable change in input resistance and resulting in depression of the firing rate. The former depolarization was reproducible by applying specific alpha-agonist, phenylephrine, whereas the latter was induced by a beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol. The actions of phenylephrine and isoproterenol were blocked by phentolamine and propranolol, respectively. Amplitude of the phenylephrine-induced depolarization was voltage-dependent with the estimated reversal potential of about - 115 mV and changed as a function of [K+]o. On the contrary, amplitude of the isoproterenol-induced depolarization was voltage-independent and was insensitive to changes in external concentrations of K+, Na+, Cl- and Ca2+. We conclude that catecholamines directly modulate the activity of supraoptic neurons through two functionally distinct adrenoceptive sites on neurosecretory cells. The activation of alpha-receptors may increase cellular excitability through suppression of membrane K+ conductance while the activation of beta-receptors would depress neuronal firings, possibly through some mechanism which is not directly linked to ionic channels.", 
    "74": "If myocardial ischemia always results from an imbalance between the needs and supplies in oxygen of the myocardium cells, the physiopathology of this process seems today infinitely more complex than the mere diminution or interruption of the output in a coronary artery. The extension of atheromatous lesions, the platelets aggregation, thrombosis, the coronary spasm, the release of products from the arachidonic cascade, the reactivity of the vascular endothelium, the profibrinolytic activity of the tissues are many of the intricate factors inducing myocardial ischemia. Cellular alterations, of which some are triggered by the release of oxygenated free radicals, lead then to an irreversible necrosis. The medications used until now in the treatment of angina are oxygen scavengers and research goes on in this direction with vaso-dilators beta-blockers, prolonged action nitro-compounds (nicorandil) or nitro-compounds with an action reinforced by N-acetyl-cysteine, bradycardiac derivates of alinidine and the new calcium antagonists dihydropyridine. However, the new physiopathological concepts of ischemia have opened new directions for the research: products which modify the arachidonic cascade by increase of synthesis or release of PGI2 (nafazatrom, defibrotide), by inhibition of TXA2 synthesis or blocking of TXA2 receptors, and similar products of PGI2 (iloprost); thrombolytic agents more specific of thrombin (PTA) or fibrinolysis activators (defibrotide), and anticoagulants with extended action; chelating agents of oxygenated free radicals (peroxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase) or xanthine oxidase inhibitors; platelets anti-aggregates like ticlopidine which blocks the platelets receptors to fibrinogen, or inhibitors of the synthesis of pro-aggregating agents.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "75": "Subchronic treatment with the beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, clenbuterol (0.3 mg X kg-1, twice daily for 14 days), significantly increased the median blood pressure in anaesthetized normotensive rats. The treatment produced a marked reduction in the vasodilator effect of isoproterenol. Acute clenbuterol administration (0.01 mg X kg-1 i.v.) reduced the contractile response induced by the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists, guanabenz or B-HT 920, and the alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, clonidine, whereas it did not affect the vasoconstriction by the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist, methoxamine, in the pithed rat. Subchronic treatment with clenbuterol attenuated the effect of the beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist on the vascular alpha 2-adrenoceptor responses and enhanced the alpha 1-adrenoceptor response to phenylephrine in pithed rats. The effect of the beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist was reduced by 1- but not d-propranolol. These results suggest that subchronic treatment with clenbuterol produces a subsensitivity of the beta 2-adrenoceptors and reduced the interaction between beta 2- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors at the vascular wall."
