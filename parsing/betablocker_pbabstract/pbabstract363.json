The therapeutic time interval may be modulated influencing the rate of absorption by controlling dissolution rate and changing the transport through the membranes. The results obtained from dissolution, absorption and efficacy studies of the evaluated active substances (magnesium oxide, metoprolol, nitrofurantoin) demonstrate the significance of mass transfer processes in the drug formulation.", 
    "1": "Intravenous administration of propranolol (10 mg/kg) to rats with turpentine-induced inflammation and adjuvant-induced arthritis results in the reduction of the systemic clearance (Cltot.p), volume distribution (Vd,ss) and free fraction (fu). At the same time the area under the pharmacokinetic curve (AUC) increases and the half-life period (t1/2 beta) remains the same. In the phenobarbital-treated rats with acute inflammation Cltot.p increases, AUC and t1/2 beta decreased. Administration of cimetidine resulted in the opposite effect. In rats with adjuvant arthritis phenobarbital and cimetidine administration did not affect the propranolol elimination kinetics. In the phenobarbital-treated rats with inflammation Vd,ss significantly decreased and virtually did not change in cimetidine treated rats. The fu of propranolol increased markedly after the cimetidine treatment in all rats with inflammation, whereas phenobarbital treatment appeared effective only in rats with acute inflammation. The tissue-to plasma concentration ratio (Kp) of propranolol decreased in the liver of rats both with acute and chronic inflammation, whereas in the heart the effect was observed only in rats with chronic inflammation. The tissue to plasma concentration ratio of unbound propranolol (Kpu) decreased only in the liver of rats with acute inflammation. In the phenobarbital-treated rats with adjuvant arthritis Kp of propranolol in the liver increased and in the heart decreased, whereas cimetidine-treatment did not change Kp of propranolol in heart and decreased it in the liver. The Kpu of propranolol decreased only in the heart of rats with acute inflammation after phenobarbital treatment, whereas after cimetidine administration this parameter decreased in the heart and in the liver of rats regardless of the character of inflammation.", 
    "2": "The effects of beta-adrenergic agonists on fibroblast-mediated collagen gel contraction were investigated. beta-Agonists isoproterenol and epinephrine significantly attenuated fibroblast-mediated gel contraction in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas alpha-agonist norepinephrine had no effect. The biologically active form of isoproterenol, (-)-isoproterenol, was 10-fold more effective than the optical isoform, (+)-isoproterenol. beta-Antagonists sotalol and propranolol reversed the attenuation caused by 10(-7) M isoproterenol or epinephrine at the concentration of 10(-7) M or 10(-6) M, but the alpha-antagonist phentolamine did not. However, beta1- or beta2-specificity of these effects is not clear. Isobutyl methylxanthine augmented the effect of isoproterenol and also prolonged the duration. Two reagents which are known to increase intracellular adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP), prostaglandin E2 and dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate, attenuated gel contraction in a concentration-dependent manner. These data suggest that the fibroblast-mediated collagen gel contraction can be modulated by beta-adrenergic agonists and that the effect depends on cAMP.", 
    "3": "The effects of bradykinin on lymphatic pump activity of rat mesenteric collecting duct were studied, and the receptor subtype responsible for the bradykinin response was evaluated. Rats were anesthetized with intraperitoneal alpha-chloralose and urethan, and exteriorized mesenteries were studied using intravital microscopic techniques. The diameter of the collecting lymph vessels (approximately 100 microns) was continuously monitored and lymphatic pump parameters (end diastolic diameter, end systolic diameter, stroke volume index, ejection fraction, contraction frequency, and pump flow index) were calculated. Bradykinin (0.1-1.0 nM) did not affect end diastolic diameter, end systolic diameter, stroke volume index, and ejection fraction. Bradykinin increased lymphatic contraction frequency and pump flow index in a dose-dependent manner. Des-Arg9-[Leu8]bradykinin (B1 antagonist, 0.1 microM) had no effect on baseline lymphatic pumping but completely inhibited the bradykinin-induced increase in contraction frequency. N-acetyl-D-Arg-[Hyp3,Thi5,8,D-Phe7] bradykinin (B2 antagonist, 0.1 microM) significantly depressed lymphatic contraction frequency in baseline conditions but had no effect on bradykinin-induced increases in contraction frequency. These results indicate that bradykinin induces positive chronotropic but not inotropic effects on lymphatic pump activity through the stimulation of B1 receptors.", 
    "4": "To reduce unwanted effects of calcium upon the heart, in particular in cows during the treatment of hypocalcaemia, experiments were carried out in isolated hearts of guinea pigs and in conscious rabbits, to show whether beta-adrenergic blocking agents are able to antagonize these effects. It was found that calcium effects in the second phase which is characterized by a tachycardia, are antagonized by carazolol, which was used for these experiments.", 
    "5": "Binding characteristics of beta-adrenergic receptors of longitudinal muscle membranes isolated from different stages of pregnant rat myometrium were investigated using [3H]dihydroalprenolol. Between Days 15 and 21 of gestation, the ratio of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors of longitudinal membranes was constant. The membranes were found to be predominant in beta 2-adrenergic receptors. The concentration of longitudinal muscle beta-adrenergic receptors increased significantly during the last 7 days of gestation. Kinetic binding studies implied that the affinity of the membrane beta-adrenergic receptors decreased through a slight decrease in the association rate and a large increase in the dissociation rate with progression of pregnancy. A Scatchard plot indicated that longitudinal muscle in beta-adrenergic receptors on Days 15 and 18 constitute a single class of independent sites. By contrast, the dissociation kinetics, the convex downward curvature in a Scatchard plot and a Hill coefficient (h) of less than 1.00 of [3H] DHA binding to beta-receptors of muscle on Day 21 suggested the existence of negatively cooperative multiple binding sites for beta-adrenergic ligand. These results suggest that changes in the dynamics of uterus beta-adrenergic receptors play an important role in the onset of labor.", 
    "6": "Patients who suffer myocardial infarction can have improved outcomes if the following elements are part of their treatment plans: 1. Rapid diagnosis of the condition. 2. Use of thrombolytics or angioplasty early in the presentation, if appropriate. 3. Use of aspirin early in the course of care. 4. Discharge medications of aspirin and beta blockade, in appropriately selected patients. 5. Documentation of efforts to counsel the patient to quit smoking. The above material outlines the key indicators in the national project to improve care for heart attack victims. Hospitals should assess the diagnosis, immediate care, and long-term management of patients with this condition. Patients have a variety of comorbidities and do not always fit into a simplified therapeutic scheme. Nevertheless, the care of myocardial infarction victims in the pilot CCP states demonstrated that a sizable number of these patients could benefit from a more focused approach to the above therapeutic interventions.", 
    "7": "The prevalence of myocardial infarction (MI) is high among the elderly population. Many of the physiological and morphological changes attributable to 'normal' aging predispose older adults to cardiovascular instability. The incidence of both MIs and their associated morbidity and mortality increase with aging. Older MI patients may therefore derive substantial benefit from appropriately selected therapeutic intervention. In fact, given the high morbidity and mortality associated with MI in the elderly, aggressive therapeutic strategies may be particularly warranted. There are a number of age-related cardiovascular changes that contribute to the increasing incidence of MI as adults age. However, age itself is not a contraindication to aggressive therapy. Common MI management options include invasive and pharmaceutical strategies. The relative advantages of angioplasty and thrombolytics must be considered. Other drugs used in the treatment of MI include beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, nitrates, aspirin, anticoagulants, magnesium, antiarrhythmics and calcium antagonists. Significant peri-infarction complications, including heart failure, hypotension, arrhythmias, myocardial rupture and cardiogenic shock, often occur in older adults. Age-specific management strategies for these complications are reviewed.", 
    "8": "Ischaemic heart disease is a major problem in the elderly. Compared with younger patients, coexisting medical conditions are more common and the patients are more likely to be receiving multiple drugs. In addition, drug pharmacodynamics are altered in the elderly and this needs to be carefully considered when commencing treatment for angina. In practice, the general principles of management of elderly patients with angina are similar to that of younger patients. However, particular care needs to be taken with the therapeutic regimens used. This article reviews the approach to the treatment of stable exertional angina in the elderly.", 
    "9": "Calcium-activated chloride channels have been proposed to control renin release from juxtaglomerular cells and to be involved in the excitation-contraction coupling of the renal afferent arteriole. The hypothesis was tested on renin release from rat glomeruli and in microperfused rabbit afferent arterioles with the chloride channel blocker 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS). Renin secretion was equally enhanced by omission of extracellular calcium and by addition of 0.5 mM DIDS. The inhibitory effect of calcium was blocked by DIDS. The stimulatory effects of low calcium [with or without ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid] and DIDS were not additive. In the absence of chloride, basal renin release was suppressed and the stimulatory effect of DIDS was abolished. The DIDS-induced enhancement of renin release was not dependent on bicarbonate. Norepinephrine (5 x 10(-7)-1 x 10(-6) M) and angiotensin II (1 x 10(-8)-10(-6) M) evoked reversible and dose-dependent contractions of microperfused rabbit afferent arterioles. DIDS (0.5 mM) did not affect the basal diameter of the arterioles but strongly inhibited the response to angiotensin II and attenuated the duration of the contractile response to norepinephrine. The results support the hypothesis that DIDS-sensitive calcium-activated chloride channels are involved in regulation of renin release and in the afferent arteriolar contraction after angiotensin II but do not play a pivotal role in the response to norepinephrine.", 
    "10": "The effects of ruthenium red (RR) on transmitter release and pre-synaptic currents were studied in the mouse neuromuscular junction. The action of RR (10 microM) was shown not only in the complete suppression of nerve-evoked muscle contractions associated with the depression of endplate potential amplitude but also in the partial inhibition of the amplitude of miniature-endplate potentials. However, the other ruthenium compounds, ruthenium chloride and tris (2,2-bipyridyl) ruthenium chloride did not significantly affect the neuromuscular transmission. In pre-synaptic waveform studies, the fast K(+)-current [IK(f)] as well as the ca(2+)-activated K(+)-current [IK(ca)] was significantly enhanced by 10 microM RR. Furthermore, 10 microM RR antagonized the action of beta-bungarotoxin (a blocker of slow K(+)-channel [IK(s)] in enhancing pre-synaptic Ca2+ currents. In contrast, the typical Ca(2+)-channel blockers, omega-agatoxin (0.5 microM), Gd3+ (0.5 mM) and CD2+ (0.3 mM) all suppressed the IK(ca). Although RR (1-30 microM) inhibited the Ca(2+)-currents of the nerve terminals induced by the combined treatment with the K(+)-channel blockers, 3,4-diaminopyridine plus tetraethylammonium chloride in a concentration-dependent manner, it is considered that RR-enhanced K+ currents were responsible for, at least in part, the observed inhibition of the Ca(2+)-current which led to the blockade of transmitter release.", 
    "11": "Baclofen, a GABAB receptor agonist can induce catatonia in rats. This catatonia may serve as a tool for the study of GABAB receptor function. Reciprocal interactions between serotonin (5-HT) and GABAB receptors in the CNS are known to occur. In the present study we examined the effect of various agents that influence serotonergic neurotransmission on baclofen-induced catatonia in rats. The catatonia was rated by means of a scoring method, according to the severity of motor symptoms produced by baclofen (10-15 mg/kg, i.p.). All serotonergic drugs were injected intraperitoneally 30 min prior to baclofen, except the 5-HT synthesis inhibitor p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA), which was injected 72 and 48 hr prior to baclofen. The 5-HT releaser fenfluramine (10 mg/kg) and the uptake inhibitor fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) reversed, whereas the 5-HT1A agonist buspirone (3 mg/kg) potentiated baclofen-induced catatonia. The 5-HT synthesis inhibitor PCPA (150 x 2 mg/kg), the non-specific 5-HT antagonist cyproheptadine (5 mg/kg), the 5-HT1A/1B antagonist pindolol (3 mg/kg) and the 5-HT2 antagonist sulpiride (20 mg/kg) enhanced baclofen-induced catatonia. It is concluded that the manipulations of central serotonergic mechanisms modulate baclofen-induced catatonia.", 
    "12": "The increase in cardiac contractile function following adrenergic stimulation is accompanied by increased glucose metabolism. Since prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) can internalize beta-receptors, we determined what effects PGE2 and isoproterenol have on glycolysis and glucose oxidation in the isolated working rat heart. All hearts were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing 11 mM [5-3H, 14C(U)]glucose, 100 microU/mL insulin, and 3% albumin. In the presence of 0.4 mM palmitate and 1.25 mM free Ca2+, isoproterenol (3 x 10(-8) M) increased the heart rate x peak systolic pressure product from 27 +/- 1 to 43 +/- 1 mmHg.beats.min-1.10(3) (1 mmHg = 133.3 Pa). This was accompanied by an increase in glycolytic rates from 3564 +/- 231 to 7775 +/- 475 nmol.g-1 dry weight min-1 and an increase in glucose oxidation from 930 +/- 72 to 2591 +/- 239 nmol.g-1 dry weight.min-1. Addition of PGE2 (10(-9) M) did not affect the isoproterenol stimulation of glycolysis, but caused a further increase in glucose oxidation (to 3863 +/- 495 nmol.g-1 dry weight.min-1). In the absence of isoproterenol, 10(-9) M PGE2 had no effect on either glycolysis or glucose oxidation. When perfusate [Ca2+] was raised to 2.5 mM, a significant increase in glycolysis was seen in control hearts (from 3564 +/- 231 to 5679 +/- 374 nmol.g-1 dry weight.min-1). The effects of isoproterenol and PGE2 on glucose metabolism remained, although the synergistic effects of PGE2 on glucose oxidation were less dramatic. When 1.2 mM palmitate was present in hearts perfused with 2.5 mM Ca2+, a decrease was seen in both glycolysis (from 5679 +/- 374 to 3027 +/- 346 nmol.g-1 dry weight.min-1) and glucose oxidation (from 1056 +/- 170 to 221 +/- 29 nmol.g-1 dry weight.min-1). Even at this high concentration of fatty acid, isoproterenol stimulated glucose oxidation (from 221 +/- 29 to 859 +/- 69 nmol.g-1 dry weight min-1), and addition of PGE2 resulted in a significant further increase (1021 +/- 139 nmol.g-1 dry weight.min-1). These data demonstrate that concentrations of PGE2 that bind to the high affinity cardiac PGE2 receptor have no effect on glucose metabolism in the absence of beta-agonists. In the presence of isoproterenol, which dramatically stimulates both glycolysis and glucose oxidation, PGE2 has a synergistic effect on glucose oxidation at lower fatty acid concentrations. These findings suggest that PGE2 receptors in the heart function to potentiate rather than decrease beta-adrenergic stimulation of glucose metabolism.", 
    "13": "The aim of this study was to assess the chronic effects of a highly selective dihydropiridine calcium channel blocker, israpidine, in its sustained release form (I-SRO), on platelet functions and fibrinolytic parameters in subjects with essential hypertension (EH) combined or not with other well-known cardiovascular risk factors, such as cigarette smoking (EH+S) and type II diabetes mellitus (EH+DM). Thirty-six patients with essential hypertension with sitting diastolic blood pressures of 96-104 mmHg without (EH, n = 12) or with other risk factors (EH+S, n = 12, EH+DM, n = 12) were enrolled. After a 4-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period, the subjects received I-SRO 5 mg once daily for 18 weeks. After both placebo and 6 and 18 weeks of I-SRO treatment, the following parameters were measured: sitting blood pressure by mercury sphygmomanometer; platelet aggregation, plasma beta-thromboglobulin (BTG), platelet factor-4 (PF4), and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) by means of ELISA methods; and euglobulin lysis time before (ELT) and after standardized (10 min) venous occlusion (ELT-VO). In the group of patients as a whole compared with placebo, I-SRO significantly reduced SBP/DBP platelet aggregation, BTG, PF4, ELT, and ELT-VO. Significant reductions in these parameters were also observed in each group. In addition to the antihypertensive effect, I-SRO chronic treatment may favorably affect the platelet function and fibrinolytic system in essential hypertension with or without other cardiovascular risk factors.", 
    "14": "Metoprolol and carvedilol are widely used in the treatment of hypertension, but no randomized comparison of their hemodynamic activity has been previously reported. Their comparative effects on heart rate, systemic blood pressure, and echocardiographically determined aortic and femoral artery blood flow were measured at rest and at 2 and 24 hours after the first dose of each drug, and again after 4 weeks of sustained monotherapy in 12 male and 12 female patients, aged 36-68 years with uncomplicated sustained hypertension according to a randomized single-blind protocol. Nine patients in each drug group achieved the target diastolic blood pressure of < 90 mmHg on the initial doses of each drug; this was achieved in the remainder following doubling of each dose. Neither drug occasioned withdrawal of any patient due to adverse reactions. Both drugs significantly reduced heart rate, although the reduction at 2 hours was significantly greater after metoprolol than after carvedilol. Both drugs reduced systolic pressure throughout the study; the reduction at 2 hours was significantly greater after carvedilol than after metoprolol. In contrast, the diastolic blood pressure was persistently reduced only by carvedilol. The cardiac output, determined as the aortic systolic blood flow, after carvedilol was not significantly different from pretreatment values throughout the study but was significantly reduced in the metoprolol-treated patients at each point of measurement. After metoprolol the systemic and femoral vascular resistances derived from conventional formulae were consistently and significantly increased over pretreatment values throughout the study and were significantly greater than in the carvedilol group at all measurement points. The hemodynamic differences between these two beta-blocking drugs may be explained by the additional vasodilator activity of carvedilol associated with its alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocking activity. The long-term clinical and prognostic implications of these pharmacodynamic differences between beta-adrenoceptor antagonists with and without additional vasodilator activity in the treatment of hypertensive patients remain to be determined.", 
    "15": "Despite therapy with diuretics, digoxin, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, congestive heart failure remains an important health problem with high mortality, and it is clear that new treatments for heart failure are needed. Evidence from basic research, animal studies, and clinical human trials indicates that high adrenergic tone in patients with heart failure is deleterious; furthermore, the deleterious effects are partially reversible with beta-adrenergic blockade. This article reviews the recent developments in our understanding of the pathophysiology of heart failure and the recent data concerning the treatment of heart failure with beta-blocking agents.", 
    "16": "The postulate that ischemic preconditioning caused an attenuation in ischemia induced increases in tissue cAMP, and that this may pertain to the mechanism of ischemic preconditioning, was investigated in the isolated rat heart. A significant reduction in tissue cAMP in preconditioned hearts was observed for all time periods of global ischemia studied. The significance of this observation was evaluated by comparing the effect of anti-adrenergic interventions on energy metabolism and post-ischemic functional recovery of both non-preconditioned and preconditioned hearts.", 
    "17": "The isolated perfused rat heart was used as experimental model. Six groups were studied: Non-preconditioned rat hearts: i) untreated controls (Non-PC), ii) reserpinised (Non-PC Res), iii) propranolol treated (10(-7) M) (Non-PC Prop); Preconditioned rat hearts: iv) preconditioned controls (PC), v) reserpinised (PC Res) and vi) propranolol (10(-7) M) treated (PC Prop).", 
    "18": "After 25 min global ischemia the concentration of cAMP was increased by 79.6% in the Non-PC group. This increase was attenuated in all of the treated groups, although in varying degrees. Energy utilization in these hearts also differed markedly between the groups. Functional recovery was however similar in all Non-PC and PC treated groups and significantly superior to that of Non-PC control hearts. Prior reserpinisation mimicked the protective effect of preconditioning on energy metabolism and functional recovery. To determine the significance of attenuation of the increase in cAMP in the protection conferred by preconditioning, hearts were pretreated with forskolin (10(-6) M). This caused an accumulation of tissue cAMP in preconditioned hearts to similar absolute values as seen in untreated non-preconditioned hearts during 25 min global ischemia. However, the percentage increase in forskolin-pretreated preconditioned hearts during sustained ischemia was only 50% vs. 71% in non-preconditioned hearts treated with forskolin, confirming an attenuated beta-response induced by preconditioning. Forskolin treatment of preconditioned hearts did not abolish the protective effect.", 
    "19": "The findings suggest that the protection against ischemic damage conferred by preconditioning is associated with an attenuated beta-adrenergic response. However, whether the changes in cAMP occurring during sustained global ischemia is the cause of consequence of the elicited protection, remains to be established.", 
    "20": "The effectiveness of dorzolamide 2%, a topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, administered three times daily (TID) concomitantly with timolol 0.5% given twice daily (BID) was evaluated in one arm of a large, 1-year, multicenter efficacy and safety trial. That study compared dorzolamide 2% TID with betaxolol 0.5% BID and timolol 0.5% BID as monotherapy in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Ninety-seven patients with uncontrolled intraocular pressure (IOP) (ie, greater than 21 mm Hg) or with a reduction in IOP of less than 15% from baseline during monotherapy with dorzolamide required 0.5% timolol BID as adjunctive therapy; 95 patients were evaluated for efficacy. IOP was measured 1 week after starting adjunctive therapy and at all subsequent study visits. Data were evaluated as change in IOP from original baseline and change in IOP from end of monotherapy treatment. A clinically meaningful additive effect on IOP was observed at all time points. After 1 week of adjunctive therapy, the mean percent reduction from baseline in peak and afternoon trough IOPs was 34% and 28%, respectively. These results demonstrate that dorzolamide and timolol have an additive effect in lowering IOP. This combination was generally well tolerated by the patients in this study.", 
    "21": "Several studies have recently been published which have raised doubts over the long-term safety of calcium channel blockers (CCB). These have included retrospective case control studies in hypertension and meta-analyses of small scale studies in unstable angina and myocardial infarction (MI). Most of the reports were primarily concerned with the use of the short acting dihydropyridine nifedipine. Despite wide media coverage of these reports, the results are by no means irrefutable and, because of the nature of the studies themselves, are open to several criticisms. Calcium channel blockers are currently being evaluated in large-scale, prospective, randomised controlled studies, but results are unlikely to be available within the next few years. Meanwhile, the consensus view seems to be that short acting dihydropyridines should in general be avoided and have no place in the management of unstable angina and post MI. In the setting of stable angina, long acting dihydropyridines should generally be used in conjunction with a beta-blocker. In hypertensive patients, long acting dihydropyridines may be used as alternative antihypertensive agents in patients in whom the first line agents (diuretics and beta-blockers) are poorly tolerated, contra-indicated or ineffective.", 
    "22": "Initial studies with a human hematopoietic cell line, TF-1, suggest multifarious effects of electromagnetic fields on lipid signal transduction. We have examined the effects of pulsed magnetic fields (2 T, 84 microseconds zero-to-peak haversine, 91 V/m induced electric field) on the cell cycle by flow cytometry. A 31% increase of cells in the G1 phase occurred concurrently with a 35% decrease of cells in S-phase, which suggests that doses of 30 or 40 pulses have an anti-proliferative effect. Changes in the lipid second messengers, diacylglycerol (DAG) and phosphatidic acid (PA) with stimuli of 2 T intensity were also dependent on the number of pulses. DAG production doubled with 30 pulses and tripled with 40 pulses, and PA levels were reduced to one third and one tenth of the original levels. Phospholipase D (PLD) up-regulation was assessed directly by the capacity of PLD to catalyze transphosphatidylation in the presence of alcohol. [3H]Phosphatidylethanol formed rapidly and continued to increase with concomitant decreases in [3H]PA and parallel generation of [3H]DAG. Propranolol, an inhibitor of PA phosphohydrolase, inhibited the formation of DAG in a dose-dependent manner with a marked increase in PA production. Examination of the kinetics of formation of [3H]choline and [3H]phosphocholine at different times after stimulation showed a rapid and consistent increase in [3H]choline, whereas [3H]phosphocholine increase was evident only 60 min after stimulation. Magnetic exposure also caused a shift in some molecular species patterns of DAG and PA which could be correlated with phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine molecular species decreases. Therefore, we propose that the PC-PLC pathway may be temporarily inactivated for a short period of time by exposure to pulsed stimuli, and the PC-PLD pathway is up-regulated based on: (1) cellular release of [3H]choline; (2) rapid intracellular formation of [3H]PA followed by [3H]DAG; (3)active transphosphatidylation; and (4) blockade of DAG formation by propranolol.", 
    "23": "The binding of [3H]L-aspartate to membranes obtained from primary cultures of chick retinal M\u00fcller cells (glia) was studied Cells seeded in low-serum-containing medium (1%) and maintained in this condition showed an increased number of binding site from 1 to 5 days in vitro (DIV), when compared with controls cultured in medium containing 10% serum; these changes were not reversed by the addition of 10% serum after 48 h in vitro. Increased binding at this age was due to the expression of a low affinity binding system, competitively inhibited by the glutamate uptake blocker L-aspartate-beta-hydroxamate, suggesting that high serum might inhibit the expression of uptake sites at precise maturation stages. Experiments showed the effect was due to a thermolabile serum component. The increase in binding sites is parallel in time to both an increase in aspartate uptake and the initiation of synaptogenesis in the whole retina. Our results suggest that the presence of serum at defined stages in retinal development, could result in the elevation of extracellular glutamate and the concomitant excitotoxic death of neuronal cells, due to a decreased glutamate uptake by glial cells.", 
    "24": "Table 1 shows how the five major drug groups interact with those variables which should be especially considered when treating the hypertensive diabetic. While diuretics are sometimes required in severely hypertensive cases-particularly when fluid retention is part of the clinical picture, and beta blockers are the outstanding choice for those with active CHD- the newer agents, particularly ACE inhibitors and alpha blockers, appear, in theory, to be better agents in terms of preventing the major adverse cardiovascular events to which diabetics are so prone. These two types of agents are very effective together and the addition of a calcium antagonist is likely to control the blood pressures of the vast majority of patients. However, one or more randomized controlled trials to evaluate whether recommendations such as these are valid is desperately needed. Meanwhile, each physician is left to make his or her own best estimate as to which drug to use and at what threshold.", 
    "25": "Potential new radioligands for the noninvasive imaging of cardiac beta-adrenoceptors with single-photon emission computed tomography were investigated.", 
    "26": "Two iodinated derivatives of CGP12177 para (S-CYBL2B) and ortho (CYBL2A) substituted CGP12177 and an iodinated form of nadolol (CYBL1) were synthesized. Their affinity was tested in vitro (left ventricular homogenates). The biodistribution of [123I]S-CYBL2B was evaluated in rabbits. Specific binding was assessed by pretreatment of the animals with 0.1 mumol propranolol. The inhibition constant values (in nanomolars, means +/- SEM; n = 3 to 5) were determined at 1.17 +/- 0.42, 28800 +/- 9260, 11.1 +/- 2.1, 53.0 +/- 19.9, and 1790 +/- 700 for CGP12177, CYBL2A, S-CYBL2B, nadolol, and CYBL1. Myocardial uptake of [123I]S-CYBL2B was not inhibited by pretreatment of the animals with propranolol, but uptake by lung tissue could be blocked by propranolol (0.63% +/- 0.09% vs 0.33% +/- 0.02% % injected dose/g x kg; p < 0.05). In isolated right atria, preincubation with S-CYBL2B induced a parallel rightward shift of the concentration-response curve with isoprenaline.", 
    "27": "S-CYBL2B shows high affinity for cardiac beta-adrenoceptors, but binding proved nonspecific in vivo, whereas binding in lung tissue was specific. These results suggest that S-CYBL2B is probably not a suitable radioligand for receptor imaging.", 
    "28": "This study investigated the therapeutic efficacy of a new beta-blocker, nipradilol, a non-selective agent with vasodilating activity, for the treatment of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). The New York Heart Association functional class improved in the nipradilol group (n = 9, p < 0.01), but not in the control group who received conventional therapy (n = 9). The observation period was 19 +/- 7 months in the nipradilol group, and 20 +/- 9 months in the control group. Before therapy there was no difference in heart rate between the 2 groups (76 +/- 12 vs 79 +/- 15 beats/min). The end-diastolic and end-systolic left ventricular dimensions decreased in the nipradilol group (p < 0.05), but not in the control group. Radionuclide ventriculography revealed that the left ventricular ejection fraction increased in the nipradilol group (27 +/- 8 to 41 +/- 18%, p < 0.05), but not in the control group (27 +/- 11 to 27 +/- 8%). Plasma norepinephrine tended to be lowered, although not significantly, whereas plasma alpha atrial natriuretic peptide significantly decreased after the therapy (p < 0.01) in the treatment group. Lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptors were up-regulated in the nipradilol group (p < 0.05). None of these parameters changed during the observation period in the control group. Thus, nipradilol improved symptoms and cardiac function with a favorable effect on neurohumoral factors in patients with DCM.", 
    "29": "Norepinephrine stimulated lipolysis in rat fat cells while (-)-alprenolol completely inhibited this lipolysis. (-)-Alprenolol competed for (-)-[3H] dihydroalprenolol (DHA) binding sites on rat fat cells. The specific (-)-[3H]DHA binding sites identified by competition with (-)-alprenolol were found to be transferred to the solubilized supernatant during preparation of endogenous lipid droplets from the fat cells. Although the lipid droplets did not exhibit specific (-)-[3H]DHA binding, norepinephrine induced lipolysis in a cell-free system consisting of the lipid droplets and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL). Norepinephrine-induced lipolysis in the cell-free system was inhibited by propranolol and (-)-alprenolol, but not by phenoxybenzamine. The lipolytic action of norepinephrine and the anti-lipolytic actions of propranolol and (-)-alprenolol disappeared after sonication of the lipid droplets in the cell-free system. These results suggest that the adrenergic receptor concerned with lipolysis in fat cells may not be a specific (-)-[3H]DHA binding site, but may be closely related to the lipid droplets.", 
    "30": "The effect of idebenone on the serotonergic system was evaluated in the aging rat by measuring the kinetic constants of 3H-5HT and 3H-ketanserin binding sites in the cerebral cortex of rats at 3, 15 and 24 months of age following acute and subchronic administration of the drug. Idebenone displayed no in vitro affinity toward any population of serotonin receptors and did not modify their kinetic parameters after a single dose of 100 mg/kg, at any age tested. A subchronic treatment with the drug for 21 days at the dose of 30 mg/kg did not induce any relevant change in 3- and 15-month-old rats, whereas it significantly increased the density of both 3H-5HT and 3H-ketanserin binding sites in 24-month-old rats, where a lower number of receptors is detected as a consequence of aging. This effect was rather specific, since under the same experimental conditions no changes were detected in the density of cortical beta-adrenergic receptors in aged animals. In microdialysis studies, acute administration with idebenone did not affect 5HT and 5HIAA release at any age. Conversely, the pattern of serotonin metabolism was significantly modified in aged rats following repeated treatment with idebenone and was partially restored to a value similar to the one observed in young animals. These results suggest that idebenone, a putative neuroprotective agent which has been shown to improve brain metabolism in ischemic conditions, might also attenuate age-associated neuronal damage, acting probably on several neurotransmitter systems which undergo selective modification during aging.", 
    "31": "We describe an application of competitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) coupled with HPLC for quantification of beta 2-adrenergic receptor messenger RNA (mRNA) in human atrial tissues removed during cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass operations. We constructed an internal standard which was reverse transcribed in different concentrations together with constant levels of cellular RNA and subsequently PCR amplified. The competitor RNA shows the same beta 2-adrenergic receptor primer sequences as the cellular mRNA but yields a different-sized product. This allows resolution of the amplified copy DNA (complementary DNA, cDNA) fragments with a specific HPLC column. The concentration of beta 2-adrenergic receptor mRNA is derived from the ratio between the peak intensities corresponding to the amplified competitor and target products. We assessed the imprecision, accuracy and sensitivity of the method. Concentrations of beta 2-adrenergic receptor mRNA of 22.7 +/- 15.2 x 10(6) molecules per micrograms total RNA in patients treated with beta 2-antagonists were not significantly different from control patients showing 16.8 +/- 9.9 x 10(6) beta 2-adrenergic receptor mRNA molecules per microgram total RNA (Mean +/- SD). Competitive reverse transcription PCR is a highly specific, non-radioactive procedure for quantification of beta 2-adrenergic receptor mRNA and simultaneously other gene expression levels of interest in atrial tissue specimens and may therefore be used to advance our understanding of heart muscle disease.", 
    "32": "The aim of the present study was to investigate previously suggested adrenergic and tachykinin activity, as well as the cardiovascular effects, of venom from the stonefish (Synanceja trachynis). Stonefish venom (60-120 micrograms/kg, i.v.) produced dose-dependent bronchoconstriction in anaesthetised guinea-pigs. This response (100 micrograms/kg, i.v.) was significantly reduced by the neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor antagonist CP-99,994 (1 mg/kg, i.v.). Contractile responses to venom (4 micrograms/ml) of guinea-pig isolated ileum (GPI) were significantly inhibited by a combination of the sodium channel blocking drug tetrodotoxin (1 microM) and the ganglion blocking drug mecamylamine (10 microM). However, subsequent administration of CP-99,994 (0.1 microM) did not produce further inhibition. Endogenous tachykinin depletion with capsaicin (1 microM) also significantly attenuated responses to venom (4 micrograms/ml) in GPI. Venom (4 micrograms/ml) produced increases in rate and force of contraction of rat spontaneously beating isolated atria which were significantly inhibited by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (5 microM) but not by noradrenergic transmitter depletion with reserpine (4.5 mg/kg, i.p.). In the presence of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (0.3 microM), venom (6 micrograms/ml) significantly inhibited electrically evoked twitches of prostatic segments of rat vas deferens. The inhibitory effect of venom was significantly reduced by the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan (1 microM) but not by propranolol (5 microM) or the neurokinin 2 (NK2) receptor antagonist SR-48,968 (0.1 microM). Venom (60-120 micrograms/kg, i.v.) produced dose-dependent increases in mean arterial blood pressure in anaesthetised rats. This pressor response (60 micrograms/kg, i.v.) was significantly reduced by prazosin (10-50 micrograms/kg, i.v.) and the leukotriene receptor antagonist SB205312 (1 mg/kg, i.v.), significantly increased by propranolol (2 mg/kg, i.v.), but not significantly affected by the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (10 mg/kg, i.v.) or the thromboxane A2/prostaglandin H2 (TP) receptor antagonist GR32191B (1 mg/kg, i.v.). Pressor responses to venom (100 micrograms/kg, i.v.) were also observed in anaesthetised rabbits. These results suggest that stonefish venom contains a component capable of stimulating the release of endogenous tachykinins with subsequent activity at NK1 receptors. The venom also appears to act via stimulation of sodium channels on sensory nerves. The venom also has activity at alpha 2-adrenoceptors and a direct action at beta-adrenoceptors. The effect of venom on blood pressure of anaesthetised rats appears to include a pressor component that is mediated, in part,by alpha-adrenoceptors and leukotriene receptors, and a depressor component that is mediated by beta-adrenoceptors. However, the pressor response does not involve action at TP receptors, or require the production of cyclo-oxygenase metabolites.", 
    "33": "The present study examined the in vivo regulation of rolipram-sensitive, high-affinity cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase (PDE4) in rat cerebral cortex. The hydrolysis of cyclic AMP, formed by stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors, was measured in cerebral cortical slices. Hydrolysis of cyclic AMP formed under these conditions was inhibited by the PDE4-selective inhibitor rolipram but not by selective inhibitors of other PDE families. Intraventricular infusion of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA; 200 micrograms) decreased the rate constant of cyclic AMP hydrolysis and increased the cyclic AMP half-life 17 days, but not 1 or 7 days, following the treatment. A reduction in norepinephrine (NE) content occurred first; the NE level was reduced to 42, 24, and 6% of control at 1, 7, and 17 days after 6-OHDA infusion, respectively. This was followed by the development of supersensitivity of beta-adrenergic receptor-linked adenylyl cyclase, which occurred 7 days after the infusion. The reduction in PDE4 activity occurred last. When a higher dose of 6-OHDA (300 micrograms) was used, the reduction in the rate constant of cyclic AMP hydrolysis occurred by 7 days; at this time NE content was depleted to 6% of control. Similar to 6-OHDA treatment, continuous blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors, produced by chronic propranolol infusion, decreased the rate constant of cyclic AMP hydrolysis. Therefore, the current results indicate that diminished stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors, either by loss of noradrenergic innervation or by receptor blockade, reduces the activity of PDE4. This suggests that PDE4 regulation may contribute in the homeostasis of the noradrenergic receptor-effector system in the brain.", 
    "34": "The aim of the present study was to investigate putative mechanisms implicated in the impaired phagocytic response of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR)1. The effect of in vitro treatment with isoproterenol (ISO), a beta-adrenergic drug, on phagocytosis and respiratory burst by splenic macrophages (SpM\u00f8) from normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) and SHR with established hypertension, respectively, was evaluated. Furthermore, the relaxant effect of ISO was determined in phenilephrine-precontracted thoracic aorta strips from SHR compared with age-matched WKY rats. Results indicate that exposure of rat SpM\u00f8 to ISO generate a significant and dose-dependent reduction of phagocytosis and oxidative burst which was antagonized, almost completely, by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (PRO). Unlike normotensive, in hypertensive rats treatment with ISO fail to modulate phagocytosis and respiratory burst activity by SpM\u00f8. At vascular level, aortic relaxation by ISO was reduced in SHR when compared to WKY rats. These findings suggest that SHR exhibit changes not only in vascular, but also in macrophage beta-adrenoceptor-mediated responses. It is postulable that sympathetic overactivity could be responsible for impaired phagocytic functions and beta-receptor alterations observed in SHR.", 
    "35": "We have demonstrated that adenosine enhances insulin-stimulated myocardial glucose uptake in situ. In the present study we determined the role of adrenergic influences and myocardial work on insulin-stimulated myocardial glucose uptake while varying intracoronary adenosine concentrations. Under pentobarbital anesthesia we instrumented mongrel dogs to obtain blood pressure, heart rate, and arterial and coronary sinus blood samples for measuring oxygen and glucose concentrations. An electromagnetic blood flow probe around the circumflex coronary artery allowed determinations of blood flow, and calculation of myocardial oxygen (MVO2) and glucose (MGU) uptakes. Somatostatin was infused i.v. (0.8 microgram/kg.min-1) along with 10 mU/kg.min-1 regular insulin, and variable quantities of glucose to maintain euglycemia. Adenosine was infused at logarithmic incremental rates (0, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, and 10 mumoles.min-1) for 30 min each into the main left coronary arteries. Adrenergic blockade was achieved with i.v. propranolol (70 micrograms/kg bolus followed by 5 micrograms/kg.min-1 infusion), and phentolamine (95 micrograms/kg bolus followed by 9.5 micrograms/kg.min-1 infusion). Insulin infusion significantly increased MGU. Adenosine increased the maximal value for insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Adrenergic blockade alone did not alter insulin-stimulated MGU, but reduced heart rate and MVO2. When evaluated relative to MVO2 1.0 mumoles/ml adenosine infusion increased MGU independent of work-related changes in the presence or absence of adrenergic blockade. With an adenosine infusion rate of 10 mumoles/ml myocardial glucose uptake returned to baseline. These data also support our earlier speculation that the MGU response to adenosine may be biphasic. These results suggest that antagonism of adrenergic effects by adenosine cannot account for adenosine's ability to enhance insulin's effects on glucose uptake in the heart, but that work-related influences should be accounted for in interpreting results of this kind.",

    "38": "Twenty-four diabetics with diastolic blood pressure 90-115 mmHg without azotemia (plasma creatinine level < 150 mumol/l) were evaluated after 4 weeks receiving placebo and 12 weeks receiving treatment either with combined slow-release verapamil (retard formulation) and trandolapril (mean maintenance doses, 180 and 1.6 mg daily) or with atenolol and chlortalidone (71 and 18 mg daily). Insulin sensitivity (by the minimal model method of Bergman), additional metabolic variables, clinic blood pressure, ambulatory blood pressure profile and renal indices were assessed at the end of the placebo and active treatment phases.", 
    "39": "Compared with placebo, the two therapies produced similar decreases in mean supine clinic blood pressure [10 +/- 3 versus 11 +/- 3% (means +/- SEM)], upright clinic blood pressure (10 +/- 4 versus 11 +/- 4%) and ambulatory daytime blood pressure (9 +/- 2 versus 12 +/- 3%). However, although the verapamil-trandolapril combination was found to be metabolically neutral, the atenolol-chlortalidone combination aggravated insulin resistance [insulin sensitivity index, from (0.8 +/- 0.2) to (0.3 +/- 0.1) x 10(-4)/min per U per ml], increased the serum triglycerides level and decreased the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and plasma potassium levels. Although both therapies tended to reduce 24 h albuminuria, this was significant for the verapamil-trandolapril treatment only.", 
    "40": "Because the effect of any antihypertensive drug, including diuretics and beta-blockers, on cardiovascular morbidity and on mortality in non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients is not known, rational treatment selection can presently be based only on surrogate end-points. Therefore, the triad of metabolic neutrality with antihypertensive and antiproteinuric efficacy supports combined verapamil-trandolapril as a potentially valuable therapy for hypertension accompanying diabetes mellitus.", 
    "41": "Interactions between the various cell types that make up the cardiovascular system are known to play an important role in maintaining homeostasis. One area about smooth muscle cells that has received little attention, despite the production of a wide variety of mediators by smooth muscle cells, is their effect on myocardial function. In this study, the myocardial contractile effects of four different types of dog aortic strips on rabbit papillary muscles were evaluated. Of these, medial vascular smooth muscle strips most consistently (65% of the time) produced a \"vascular-derived contractile factor\" (VDCF), which caused a 15% increase in isometric twitch tension and a 24% increase in isotonic twitch shortening with no change in twitch configuration. Endovascular strips with or without intact endothelium and complete aortic rings had less consistent effects. Vascular-derived contractile factor was stable after freezing at -80 degrees C, its activity was not modified by a broad spectrum peptidase, but it was heat-labile. The angiotensin II blocker, losartan, did not modify its effects. However, incubation with indomethacin did reduce, but did not eliminate, the contractile effects of vascular strips. The addition of alpha 1- and beta-blockers did not further modify the effects of VDCF. Endocardial endothelial removal increased the effects of VDCF. No correlation existed between endothelin levels and the contractile effects of vascular strips. It is concluded that VDCF is produced by the medial layer of large vessels but its exact cellular origin is uncertain. These findings expand the ever-increasing understanding of the inter-relationship between the structures that make up the cardiovascular system, and open the door to new studies evaluating the inter-relationship of vessels and myocardium.", 
    "42": "Hypertension and diabetes co-exist more commonly than would be expected from their individual prevalences. Elevated blood pressure is most commonly due to coexisting essential hypertension, or diabetic renal disease. Early stages of diabetic renal disease can be identified by detecting microalbuminuria. Standard measures of blood pressure are not necessarily raised, but 24-hour ambulatory measures frequently identify a loss of nocturnal drop in blood pressure. Treating hypertension aggressively is important in slowing the inexorable decline in glomerular filtration rate. In diabetes there appears to be no 'J'-shaped relationship between blood pressure and cardiovascular events, thus removing any concern about attaining low blood pressures as long as the patient is asymptomatic. Morbidity and mortality in these patients is usually associated with cardiovascular events, and it is important to assess the effect of drugs on left ventricular hypertrophy and metabolic parameters. Many drugs are effective at lowering blood pressure, but angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may have an additional renoprotective action. alpha-Adrenergic antagonists may improve lipid profiles and calcium antagonists are probably lipid neutral, making these drugs useful alternatives. Dihydropyridine calcium antagonists (eg, nifedipine) may augment protein-uria, and hence non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonists (eg, verapamil, diltiazem) would be preferred. beta-Blockers and thiazide diuretics have the disadvantage of causing a deterioration in glycaemic and lipid profiles, but can be useful on occasions.",

    "48": "The purpose of these studies was to assess the involvement of beta-adrenoceptors in the development of psychological stress-induced elevation in body temperature (Tb) and rise in circulating interleukin-6 (IL-6). We selected three drugs to attempt to block the rise in body temperature and plasma IL-6; L-propranolol, D-propranolol and nadolol. Both stereoisomers of propranolol have \"local anesthetic' membrane-stabilizing activity and are capable of penetrating into the brain. However, D-propranolol has significantly lower beta-blocking activity than L-propranolol. Nadolol has beta-blocking activity similar to L-propranolol without membrane-stabilizing activity. Furthermore, nadolol does not cross the blood-brain barrier. All beta-blockers were injected intraperitoneally (i.p. 7.5 mg/kg) or into the third cerebral ventricle (i.c.v., 5 or 50 micrograms/animal), 20 min or just before exposure of rats to an open field, respectively. Blood samples for measurement of plasma IL-6 activity (IL-6-dependent B9 cell bioassay) were taken from rats immediately following exposure to the open field. After exposure to the open field, rats not treated with beta-blockers responded with a rapid rise in Tb measured by biotelemetry as well as with an increase in plasma IL-6 activity. The increase in Tb of open field-exposed rats was significantly suppressed by L-propranolol injected i.p. (delta Tmax = 0.14 +/- 0.15 degrees C for L-propranolol vs. 0.78 +/- 0.15 degrees C for vehicle-treated rats). Neither i.p. injection of D-propranolol nor nadolol had any effect on the increase in Tb induced by exposure to the open field. Both i.c.v. doses of L-propranolol and nadolol markedly attenuated the open field-induced rise in Tb. The large i.c.v. dose of D-propranolol (50 micrograms) did, whereas the lower dose (5 micrograms) did not suppress the elevation in Tb in open field exposed rats. The open field-exposed rats injected with L-propranolol (both i.p. or i.c.v.) had lower plasma IL-6 activity than that of open field-exposed rats injected with vehicle (for i.p. injection: 5.2 +/- 1.3 U/ml for L-propranolol vs. 17.4 +/- 3.8 U/ml for vehicle; for i.c.v. injection: 3.5 +/- 2.3 U/ml for L-propranolol vs. 24.4 +/- 7.2 U/ml for vehicle). Nadolol blocked the open field-induced rise in plasma IL-6 only when injected i.c.v. but no i.p. Neither i.p. nor i.c.v. D-propranolol injection had an effect on plasma IL-6 activity in open field-exposed rats. These data show that beta-adrenoceptors in the central nervous system are involved in the psychological stress-induced elevation in Tb and rise in plasma IL-6 activity caused by exposure to an open field.", 
    "49": "Serotonin (5-HT) receptors can be classified into at least three, possibly up to seven, classes of receptors. They comprise the 5-HT1, 5-HT2, and 5-HT3 classes, the \"uncloned' 5-HT4 receptor and the recombinant receptors 5-ht5, 5-ht6 and 5-ht7. We investigated the role of different serotonin receptor types in a neuroendocrine response to the activation of the serotonergic system. Female immature rats were chosen as an experimental model as it has been shown that during the 3rd week of life, and not at later developmental stages, 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP, a serotonin precursor) induces gonadotropin release in females and not in males. Besides, at this age, serotonin releases prolactin in both sexes. 5-HTP (50 mg/kg) released prolactin, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) as expected. Ketanserin (5-HT2A antagonist) and methysergide (5-HT2C antagonist) blocked 5-HTP-induced prolactin release, but did not block the LH or FSH responses. Ondansetron (5-HT3 receptor antagonist) did not modify prolactin response to 5-HTP, whereas it blocked 5-HTP-induced LH and FSH release. Propranolol (5-HT1 and beta-adrenergic antagonist) blocked prolactin, LH and FSH release induced by 5-HTP. The 5-HT2C agonist 1-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazine dihydrochloride released prolactin, without modifying LH or FSH release. Methyl-quipazine and phenylbiguanide (5-HT3 agonists) increased both LH and FSH levels, without altering prolactin secretion. The present experiments indicate that serotonin acting at the 5-HT3 receptor mediates LH and FSH release in infantile female rats, whereas 5-HT2C or 2A receptor types participate in the release of prolactin at this age. 5-HT1 receptor type may be involved in the release of the three hormones, though a beta-adrenergic component of the response cannot be discarded.", 
    "50": "We have reported that chronic treatment of patients with beta 1-adrenoceptor blockers sensitises isolated atrial preparations to adrenaline, noradrenaline and 5-Ht. We have now examined the effect of chronic treatment with beta-adrenoceptor blockers on responses to histamine of human right atrial appendages. We compared the effects of histamine on contractile force, cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP levels as well as cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activity and explored the arrhythmogenic effects of histamine in preparations obtained from patients chronically treated or not treated with beta-adrenoceptor blockers. Histamine increased contractile force in paced preparations; the effects were blocked by the H2 receptor antagonist famotidine (0.1-30 mumol/l). The maximum inotropic response to histamine was doubled and the inotropic potency of histamine 0.4 log units greater in atria from beta-adrenoceptor blocker-treated compared to non beta-adrenoceptor blocker-treated patients. Histamine elicited frequency-dependent arrhythmias that were blocked by famotidine (30 mumol/l) but not by mepyramine (1 mumol/l). The incidence of arrhythmias was higher in atria from beta-adrenoceptor blocker-treated compared to untreated patients. Histamine increased both cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP levels, as well as PKA activity, significantly more in atria from beta-adrenoceptor blocker-treated compared to those from untreated patients. Mepyramine 1 mumol/l prevented the histamine-evoked increase in cyclic GMP levels, reduced the inotropic hyperresponsiveness and abolished the hyperresponsiveness in cyclic AMP levels and PKA activity observed in patients chronically treated with beta blockers. Sodium nitroprusside 10 mumol/l caused smaller increase of cyclic GMP levels than histamine and restored the contracile force depressed by mepyramine to its original level in atria from beta-adrenoceptor blocker-treated patients. The evidence is consistent with sensitisation of both the histamine H1 and histamine H2 receptor systems by chronic beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade. H1 receptor-mediated increases in cyclic GMP, enhanced through an as yet unknown mechanism by chronic beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade, may inhibit phosphodiesterase 3 activity, thereby causing enhanced histamine-evoked increases in cyclic AMP levels and PKA activity, and accounting partially for the increased inotropic responses to histamine through H2 receptors.", 
    "51": "Two hundred and ten patients with clinical evidence of heart failure, developing after an acute myocardial infarction, were randomized to treatment with the beta 1-receptor antagonist metoprolol 50-100 mg b.i.d. (n = 106) or the beta 1-receptor partial agonist xamoterol 100-200 mg b.i.d. (n = 104). Left ventricular systolic and diastolic function were assessed with echocardiography and transmitral Doppler cardiography before and after 3 and 12 months of double-blind treatment. E-point septal separation and percent left ventricular fractional shortening were used as indices of systolic function. The ratio between peak early and late mitral diastolic flow (E/A ratio) and isovolumic relaxation time were used as indices of diastolic function. In the xamoterol group, there was a deterioration in E-point septal separation (P < 0.05). A difference between the treatment groups was present both at 3 months (E-point septal separation 11.4 vs 13.0 mm, P < 0.01, fractional shortening 27.1 vs 25.2%, P < 0.05) and 12 months (E-point septal separation 11.1 vs 13.2 mm. P < 0.005, fractional shortening 26.9 vs 25.0%, P < 0.05). E/A ratio increased in the metoprolol group (P < 0.05) but not in the xamoterol group. At 3 months there was a significant difference (0.85 vs 0.67, P < 0.005) between the groups but not at 12 months. In comparison with the beta 1-receptor antagonist metoprolol, the beta 1-receptor partial agonist xamoterol impaired left ventricular systolic function in patients with clinical evidence of heart failure after an acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "52": "Recently, a new exercise test criterion diagnosing coronary artery disease was proposed, based on a composite of changes in Q-, R- and S-waves: the QRS score. We compared this new criterion with conventional ST-segment depression and other compositions of Q-, R- and S-wave changes in patients and normals and related the QRS score to reversible thallium-201 scintigraphic defects and ST-segment depression as markers for ischaemia. The influence of beta-blockade on the QRS score was also studied.", 
    "53": "The study population consisted of 155 persons with 53 normals (group I) and 102 patients with documented coronary artery disease (group II). Another 20 patients (group III) with proven coronary artery disease and a positive exercise test by ST-segment criteria were studied for the influence of beta-blockade on the QRS score. A symptom-limited exercise protocol according to the modified Bruce protocol was used. For the QRS score, Q-, R- and S-wave amplitudes which could be recovered immediately were subtracted from pretest values: delta Q, delta R, delta S respectively. The score was calculated by the formula: (delta R - delta Q - delta S)AVF + (delta R - delta Q - delta S)V5.", 
    "54": "Using a cut-off point of > 5 as normal, the QRS score resulted in a sensitivity of 88.2%, a specificity of 84.8% and a predictive accuracy of 87.1%. For ST-segment depression these values were 54.9%, 83% and 64.5% respectively (P < 0.001 compared to the QRS score). Predictive accuracies of changes in Q-, R- and S-waves in leads AVF and V5 separately, combinations of changes and combining the two leads, resulted-with the exception of solitary S-wave changes-in predictive accuracies higher than those of ST-segment depression, but all were lower than the QRS score. We found a significant correlation between the QRS score, the summed ST-segment depression (P < 0.004) and the extent of reversible thallium-201 defects (P < 0.001). Applying Bayes' theorem, the combination of an abnormal QRS score and ST-segment depression resulted in the highest post-test risk for coronary artery disease and a normal QRS score without ST-segment depression in the lowest post-test risk. The QRS score and the maximal ST-segment depression changed significantly under the influence of beta-blockade (P < 0.02 and P < 0.001 respectively).", 
    "55": "Our data suggest that an abnormal QRS score reflects myocardial ischaemia. Furthermore, for the interpretation of the exercise test, the combined analysis of ST-segments and the QRS score is of value for the prediction of the presence or absence of coronary artery disease and its follow-up.", 
    "56": "We have examined a possible role for nitric oxide in the efferent vagal control of heart rate of the anaesthetized ferret, using stimulation of the motor fibres of the right vagus at supramaximal intensities and increasing frequencies. Propranolol was used to block beta-adrenergic actions on the heart. L-NAME (50-100 mg i.v.) significantly reduced the bradycardia induced by vagal stimulation at all frequencies tested (1-15 Hz); subsequent infusion of L-arginine (100-200 mg i.v.) restored the vagally induced heart rate responses to control levels. These results strongly suggest a role for nitric oxide in modulating the vagally mediated control of heart rate.", 
    "57": "The present study was undertaken in anaesthetized pigs to determine the primary reflex effects of gastric distension on the peripheral circulation. Changes in blood flow in the splenic, superior mesenteric, left renal and left external iliac arteries were assessed using electromagnetic flowmeters during distension of a balloon in the stomach, performed at constant aortic blood pressure and heart rate, with 0.6 l of Ringer solution (mean gastric transmural pressure of about 12 mmHg). In fourteen pigs, a decrease in splenic, renal and iliac flows and variable changes in mesenteric flow were obtained. A decrease in mesenteric flow and more marked decreases in the other flows occurred in response to the distension after the administration of propranolol or butoxamine. In five pigs, the vasoconstrictive responses were graded by step increments in gastric distending volume from 0.4 to 0.8 l. The above responses were abolished by the administration of phentolamine (eight pigs) and by bilateral cervical vagotomy (six pigs). The results showed that innocuous distension of the stomach in anaesthetized pigs reflexly caused vasoconstriction in the splenic, renal and iliac vascular beds; vasoconstriction also occurred in the mesenteric vascular bed but only after beta-blockade. These reflex responses were mediated by sympathetic mechanisms which involved both alpha and beta vascular adrenoceptors and their afferent limb was in the vagal nerves.", 
    "58": "Flow of submandibular saliva and the constituents secreted during chorda-lingual nerve stimulation at 40 Hz (3 x 10 min) were studied after alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade, and in the absence (control) or presence of cholinergic blockade in anaesthetized rats. Peroxidase and true tissue kallikrein (rK1) were assessed to gain insight into the effects of the non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic (NANC) transmitters on protein secretion by acini and granular tubules, respectively. From control glands there was an overall mean flow of 181 +/- 15 microliters g-1 min-1, with no significant differences between the three periods. Secretion from atropinized glands was approximately 20% of that from control glands in the first 10 min, decreasing progressively to approximately 6% in the final period. Protein outputs from control glands showed no significant differences for the three periods (0.23 +/- 0.05 mg g-1 min-1). Protein outputs from atropinized glands were similar to controls in the first 10 min and then decreased significantly. Peroxidase output from control glands increased progressively (from 31 +/- 7 to 243 +/- 68 pmol dichlorofluorescein (DCF) g-1 min-1) but in saliva from atropinized glands the overall mean output was only 4.5 +/- 0.8 pmol DCF min-1 ml-1, with a progressive decrease between samples. Outputs of rK1 from control glands were similar for all samples (20.6 +/- 4.0 nmol AFC g-1 min-1), but there was a significantly smaller and decreasing output of rK1 from atropinized glands. In conclusion, NANC transmitters released from parasympathetic nerves during stimulation at high frequency appear to have little influence on the secretion of protein from rat submandibular acini and granular tubule cells when acting in isolation. This contrasts with their effects on amylase secretion from rat parotid glands under similar circumstances.", 
    "59": "Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) are hypothalamic factors that play roles in the regulation of anterior pituitary cell activity. PACAP exists in 2 forms physiologically, a 38 amino acid form (PACAP38) and a form possessing the N-terminal 27 amino acids of PACAP38 (PACAP27). We have previously shown that PACAP38 stimulates an increase in [Ca2+]i in rat gonadotrophs. In an attempt to identify the PACAP receptor type underlying this effect, we compared the potency of PACAP38, PACAP27 and VIP to stimulate Ca2+ changes in identified single rat gonadotrophs. All 3 peptides at 100 nM were capable of stimulating high amplitude Ca2+ oscillations, which were also observed in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. The order of potency of these peptides was PACAP38 > PACAP27 > VIP, and a potent antagonist of the PACAP/VIP type II binding site ([4-CI-D-Phe6, Leu17]-VIP) failed to block these responses, suggesting that these effects are mediated through a PACAP/VIP type 1 receptor (PVR1). The Ca2+ responses to PACAP38 and VIP were unaffected by overnight treatment of the cells with pertussis toxin (PTX; 250 ng/ml) indicating that these responses are mediated by a PTX-insensitive G-protein. Finally, the Ca2+ responses stimulated by PACAP38 and VIP were blocked by the phospholipase C-beta blocker U73122 (5 microM). In summary, PACAP stimulates Ca2+ oscillations in rat gonadotrophs through the activation of the PVR1 linked to a PTX-insensitive G-protein and the activation of phospholipase C-beta. VIP can stimulate the same pathway in rat gonadotrophs, although it is at least 100 fold less potent than PACAP38.", 
    "60": "Propranolol and molsidomine have both been shown to decrease the hepatic venous pressure gradient in patients with cirrhosis. The present study aimed at assessing the effects of the combination of these two drugs on splanchnic and systemic haemodynamics of cirrhotic patients. Fifteen patients with biopsy proven alcoholic cirrhosis had haemodynamic measurements under basal conditions, 60 min after oral administration of 4 mg molsidomine then 15 min after intravenous administration of 15 mg propranolol. As compared with baseline values, molsidomine was found to decrease mean arterial pressure (-7.9%, (P < 0.01), cardiac output (-7.3%, P < 0.01), pulmonary wedged pressure (-45.8%, (P < 0.05) and hepatic venous pressure gradient (-11.7%, P < 0.01). Propranolol decreased heart rate (-21%, P < 0.01), further decreased cardiac output (-20.6%, (P < 0.01) and hepatic venous pressure gradient (-10.5%, P < 0.01). As a whole, molsidomine plus propranolol decreased mean arterial pressure (-8%, P < 0.01), heart rate (-19%, P < 0.01), cardiac output (-26.5%, P < 0.01) and hepatic venous pressure gradient (-21%, P < 0.01). Pulmonary wedged pressure, liver blood flow and hepatic intrinsic clearance of indocyanine green were not significantly changed by the association of molsidomine and propranolol. We conclude that in patients with cirrhosis, molsidomine and propranolol potentiate their effects on hepatic venous pressure gradient. Such a combination could therefore prove useful in the treatment of portal hypertension.",

The effect of glucagon, dopamine and the combination of glucagon/dopamine on respiratory and cardiovascular function and survival time in beta-blocker overdose was investigated in a model of acute d,l-propranolol (resp. 30 and 15 mg kg-1 h-1 in rat and rabbit) intoxication in spontaneously breathing rats and artificially ventilated rats and rabbits. 3. Glucagon (initial dose of 100 micrograms kg-1 (bolus), followed by 1 microgram kg-1 min-1), dopamine (25 micrograms kg-1 min-1) or the combination of glucagon/dopamine did not improve survival time (ST) in d,l-propranolol intoxicated spontaneously breathing rats and artificially ventilated rats and rabbits, although some haemodynamic variables i.e. heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), left ventricular pressure (LVPmax) and the differentiated left ventricular pressure (LVdp/dtmax) temporarily improved. 4. Survival time was considerably reduced in d,l-propranolol intoxicated spontaneously breathing and artificially ventilated rats treated with a combination of glucagon/dopamine, which induced a decrease in PaO2 and pH and an increase in PaCO2 partly due to ventilation/perfusion mismatch. 5. The combination of glucagon/dopamine should be used carefully in the treatment of beta-blocker overdose in man.", 
    "62": "Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) have been a successful adjunct to the management of arrhythmias in patients with Long QT syndrome (LQTS). In two patients, interactions between LQTS and the ICD were diagnosed and corrected. Oversensing of T waves was confirmed in the first, while in the second, the arrhythmia disappeared when T wave abnormalities improved after cessation of H2 blocker therapy. In patients with LQTS and an ICD, T wave oversensing should be considered. Interventions that may have an adverse effect on repolarization should be avoided.", 
    "63": "Recurrent neurocardiogenically mediated episodes of hypotension and bradycardia are a common cause of recurrent syncope that can be identified by head upright tilt table testing. While the use of beta-blockers, theophylline, fludrocortisone, disopyramide, and serotonin re-uptake inhibitors can be helpful in preventing further episodes, some patients are unresponsive to or poorly tolerant of these agents. We investigated the use of the central nervous system stimulant and peripheral vasoconstrictor methylphenidate in preventing both tilt induced and spontaneous neurocardiogenic syncope. Seven patients (all women, mean age 31 +/- 15 years) with recurrent syncope and positive head upright tilt induced hypotension/bradycardia (refractory to normal therapy) were placed on methylphenidate 10 mg orally three times per day. Six of the seven patients became both tilt negative and clinically asymptomatic over a 7-month follow-up period. We conclude that methylphenidate may be an effective therapy in patients with recurrent neurocardiogenic syncope refractory to other forms of therapy.", 
    "64": "This study aims to describe factors associated with cognitive decline among 2584 subjects, aged 65-74, who were followed up for 54 months in the Medical Research Council Elderly Hypertension Trial (1982-1989). The subjects completed a cognitive test, the Paired Associate Learning Test (PALT), five times over this period. Decline on the PALT was associated with advanced age, male sex, rural residence, depression and low intelligence. These effects were modified by gender and level of pre-morbid intelligence. Advanced age, rural residence and number of cigarettes smoked daily were only associated with PALT decline among women of below median intelligence. The association between depression and PALT decline was only apparent in women of below median intelligence and men of above median intelligence. While these findings are consistent with other research into cognitive decline, they differ in some ways from reported risk factors for dementia, suggesting aetiological separateness. That women were more vulnerable than men to the effects of age and smoking raises the question of the impact on cognition of accelerated atherosclerosis after the menopause.", 
    "65": "The role of central monoaminergic neurones in stress is undisputed, albeit undefined. This is partly because little is known about the influence of the type or intensity of stress, or subjects' stress history, on monoaminergic transmission. That the presynaptic response is stimulus specific is underlined by a study using in vivo microdialysis in freely moving rats. This indicated that graded changes in noradrenaline efflux in the frontal cortex are produced by progressively increasing the number of novel features in the rats' environment. The influence of receptor status on behavioural responses to stress also depends on the stress imposed. This was suggested by studies showing that rats' behavioural response to stress correlated with the density of cortical beta-adrenoceptors. But the precise relationship again depended on features of the stress, possibly its intensity. Finally, it seems that even a single stress challenge (a 6-min swim) causes a long-latency increase in the density of 5-HT2A receptors in mouse cortex. This upregulation was prevented by a history of intraperitoneal injections of saline but not by injections of the monoamine reuptake blocker sibutramine hydrochloride. Collectively, these experiments emphasize the importance of stress as an experimental variable when studying the actions of psychotropic drugs.", 
    "66": "The response of rats naive to, or experienced with, the elevated plus-maze test of anxiety was observed following direct administration of the 5-HT1A-receptor agonist (+/-)-8-hydroxy-dipropylaminotetralin (8-OH-DPAT) (50, 100, or 200 ng) or antagonist tertatolol (3 micrograms) into the dorsal raph\u00e9 nucleus or bilaterally into the ventral hippocampus. In rats naive to the plus-maze, neither drug had a significant effect when microinjected into the dorsal raph\u00e9 nucleus. However, in rats experienced with the plus-maze, 8-OH-DPAT (100 and 200 ng) had significant anxiolytic effects when administered to the dorsal raph\u00e9 nucleus, which were antagonised by tertatolol (3 micrograms); this suggests they were mediated by 5-HT1A receptors. Hyperactivity (increased number of closed-arm entries) was found following bilateral injection of 8-OH-DPAT (100 ng) into the ventral hippocampus of rats naive to the plus-maze. This was not completely antagonised by tertatolol (3 micrograms). Interestingly, tertatolol (3 micrograms) itself had an anxiolytic effect which was not antagonised by 8-OH-DPAT (100 ng), suggesting the effect was not mediated by 5-HT1A receptors, and indeed other actions of tertatolol, such as those on 5-HT1B or beta-adrenergic receptors could have been involved. In rats experienced with the plus-maze, tertatolol (3 micrograms) again had a significant anxiolytic effect when administered bilaterally to the ventral hippocampus, and again, this was not antagonised by 8-OH-DPAT (100 ng). These results demonstrate that both the intracerebral location of the injection and test experience profoundly influence the effects of 5-HT1A ligands on behaviour of rats in the elevated plus-maze test of anxiety.", 
    "67": "The somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptor is known to regulate activity of 5-HT neurons and consequently 5-HT release. Administration of a selective 5-HT uptake inhibitor, fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) increased extracellular 5-HT levels in rat hypothalamus up to 260 percent of basal levels. (-)-Pindolol, and antagonist at the somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptor, dose-dependently (1, 3 and 5 mg/kg, s.c.) potentiated the fluoxetine dependent increase up to 458 percent of basal 5-HT levels for approximately 1.5 hours. Continuous infusion of ( +/- )-pindolol at 30 mg/kg/h s.c. enhanced the fluoxetine dependent elevation of extracellular 5-HT concentrations in hypothalamus up to 464 percent of basal levels and lasted for 3 hours. Thus, the combination of 5-HT uptake inhibition with antagonism at the somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptor can enhance 5-HT release to levels beyond those achieved with uptake inhibition alone. The present findings are consistent with the hypothesis that blockade of somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors removes the inhibitory effect exerted by the elevated 5-HT levels resulting from uptake inhibition.", 
    "68": "Adipocytes from several mammalian species have predominant beta 3-adrenergic receptors (beta 3-AR). Attempts to classify porcine adipocyte beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-AR) into subtypes have not been successful. Selectivity of agonists and antagonists for stimulation of lipolysis and for ligand binding is considerably more restrictive than for the classic rat and guinea pig beta-AR subtypes. The unique pattern for activity of agonists and antagonists in porcine beta-AR precludes analogy to classic receptors and consequently there is no conclusive evidence regarding porcine beta-AR subtypes. Porcine adipocyte membranes were used in ligand binding experiments designed specifically to demonstrate beta 3-AR. Equilibrium saturation curves with dihydroalprenolol, CGP 12,177, or iodocyanopindolol indicated saturation at low concentrations with a single binding site. Equilibrium competitive ligand binding with iodocyanopindolol as radioligand and isoproterenol or propranolol as competitive ligands indicated both ligands totally inhibited radioligand binding; propranolol was more potent than isoproterenol. Nonradioactive CGP 12,177 also competed with iodocyanopindolol. Ligand binding experiments provided no evidence of a low-affinity beta-AR (binding at high concentrations of ligand), the beta 3-AR. Positive evidences of a beta 3-AR were that CGP 12,177, a beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptor antagonist but a beta 3-AR agonist, partially stimulated porcine adipocyte lipolysis. Furthermore, transcripts for a beta 3-AR, as well as a beta 1- and beta 2-AR, have been demonstrated in RNA from porcine adipocytes in other studies. The beta-AR subtypes expressed and functional in porcine adipocytes remain unknown. The multiple ligand binding sites cannot be attributed to classic beta-AR subtypes. The porcine beta-AR may be a single unique receptor to impart atypical binding properties, or more likely, multiple subtypes, each different enough from classic subtypes to impart the unique properties observed.", 
    "69": "Sudden cardiac death and other acute cardiovascular events have been demonstrated to occur in certain temporal patterns. The study of these patterns may yield important clues to the pathophysiology of the disease process. Most studies of the timing of onset of sudden cardiac death have revealed a prominent midmorning peak, thought to be related to a surge in catecholamines associated with arising and assuming the upright posture, that is blunted or eliminated by beta blockers. In addition, some studies have also shown a secondary peak in late afternoon or early evening of uncertain cause. The development of third-generation implantable cardioverter defibrillators with memory capabilities offers a unique opportunity to accurately define event chronology.", 
    "70": "A sedentary lifestyle is prevalent in most industrialised societies. Persuasive evidence allows us to demonstrate that a physically active lifestyle protects against the development and progression of many chronic diseases. The assessment of sedentary individuals for the purpose of exercise testing and or exercise prescription should always culminate in the determination of the relative risk of the individual for traumatic events which may be precipitated by participation in moderate physical activity. Sedentary individuals may be categorised in a low to high risk stratification as apparently healthy (Class I), higher risk (Class II), or known coronary heart disease and/or symptomatic of chronic disease (Class III). An expanded role for allied health professionals, such as a clinical exercise physiologist, may enhance and extend the services of physicians and nurses as they relate to exercise testing, exercise prescription and preventative healthcare in general. Risk stratification will determine the type of exercise test, the exercise prescription and the exercise environment (low to high levels of supervision). The exercise prescription may include a determination of mode, duration, frequency, intensity, and progression of activity. Although target heart rate remains one of the most effective instruments for monitoring exercise intensity, the rate of perceived exertion should be incorporated especially in the titration of exercise prescriptions for those on beta-blockade therapy. Finally the benefits of an exercise programme, derived from a foundation of proper assessment, are numerous and include improvements in cardiovascular fitness, body composition, blood lipid profile and retention of essential muscle mass during the course of the life-cycle. A considerable public health benefit will result if sedentary individuals become regularly more physically active.", 
    "71": "Widespread application of proven primary and secondary preventive strategies for coronary heart disease would result in substantial savings of life and health care dollars. Proven strategies (excluding lipid therapy) include quitting smoking, treating hypertension, physical activity, aspirin therapy, and appropriate use of anticoagulants, beta blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in survivors of myocardial infarction. Estrogen replacement therapy is currently under clinical investigation. Avoidance of obesity and tight control of diabetes are prudent interventions as yet unproved by clinical trials. Unfortunately, preventive strategies are frequently underutilized. The greatest challenge for preventive cardiology is to put into practice what we already know to prevent the development and progression of atherosclerosis.",

Also, a quantitative assessment of the drug's effects on a rate-dependent property of anterograde AV node (AVN) conduction, termed the \"recovery process,\" was compared in mature and immature rabbit hearts. The main developmental electrophysiologic findings of this investigation are: (1) in both the mature and immature rabbit heart, d-sotalol increases the anterograde conduction time and prolongs refractoriness of the AVN, yet the minimal concentrations of d-sotalol that produce these changes are lower in the neonate; (2) d-sotalol increases the anterograde refractory period of the His-Purkinje system in both age groups, but increases anterograde infra-Hisian conduction only in the neonate; (3) 1 x 10-4 M d-sotalol significantly changes the time constant of the AVN recovery process in the neonate, but not in the adult; (4) for retrograde conduction, slow conduction through the AVN (HAmax) and infra-Hisian region (VHmax) are increased by d-sotalol in the neonate, but not in the adult.", 
    "74": "The findings of this study illustrate that d-sotalol has different effects on parameters of the developing AV conduction system.

The aim was to discover how HRV was affected by a variety of common preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative factors.

HRV was found to decrease with increased weight, age, complexity of operation, use of reversal agents for neuromuscular block and preoperative beta-block. These effects were not mediated by changes in respiration. HRV was unaffected by administration of morphine. The level of nausea or pain had no effect on HRV except that pain decreased the relative ratio of high frequency to low frequency power within the power spectrum. In the group of patients that did not receive reversal agents, there was an abrupt increase in HRV when patients became responsive to verbal command.",

Although numerous studies have demonstrated the potent vasoconstrictor effect of endothelin-1 on the renal vasculature, it is difficult to differentiate in vivo between indirect and direct actions of endothelin. 2. In the present study we therefore performed micropuncture experiments in 14 anaesthetized dogs after the administration of endothelin-1 into the renal artery (i.r.a.) for 15 min at a dose of 2.78 ng min-1 kg-1 which did not affect blood pressure or contralateral kidney function. 3. In seven dogs on a 'normal' sodium diet (3.5 mmol of NaCl day-1 kg-1) endothelin-1 resulted in decreases in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate with a rise in filtration fraction from 0.24 +/- 0.01 to 0.35 +/- 0.01. Similar changes were seen at the single-nephron level. An increase from 0.11 +/- 0.01 to 0.23 +/- 0.02 (+109 +/- 11%) in efferent, and from 0.15 +/- 0.01 to 0.24 +/- 0.02 mmHg min-1 microliter-1 (+58 +/- 4%) in afferent arteriolar resistance was observed. The ultrafiltration coefficient, Kf, decreased from 4.75 +/- 0.14 to 3.67 +/- 0.14 microliter min-1 mmHg-1 (P < 0.01). 4. In another group of seven dogs, the same endothelin-1 infusion was given after an administration into the renal artery of a 'cocktail' designed to block the receptors of alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonists, thromboxane A2, leukotrienes and angiotensin II together with intravenous cyclo-oxygenase inhibition. Under these conditions, the vasoconstrictor action of endothelin-1 was reduced by more than 30%. The increase in vascular resistance was now relatively similar in both arterioles, i.e. +44 +/- 5% in the afferent and 66 +/- 6% in the efferent arterioles (no significant difference). No change in Kf was seen after the 'cocktail'-blockade (9.4 +/- 0.4 versus 10.1 +/- 0.1 microliter min-1 mmHg-1). 5. In conclusion, in anaesthetized dogs on a 'normal' salt diet, the vasoconstrictor effect of endothelin-1 is more pronounced on the efferent than on the afferent arteriole. This is accompanied by decreases in glomerular filtration rate and water, urea and electrolyte excretion. Part of the vasoconstrictor action of endothelin seems to be mediated by other autacoids. Endothelin-1 itself contributes only partly to pre- and post-glomerular vasoconstriction and has no direct effect on the glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient Kf.", 
    "86": "Ricin, at toxic glycoprotein from the castor bean, causes myocardial hemorrhage and a decrease in blood pressure. We studied the effects of ricin on myocardial function in the isolated rabbit heart. Rabbits were given 0.22 micrograms/kg of ricin i.v. and 48 hr later, the heart was isolated and retrogradely perfused through the aorta with Tyrode's solution. A latex balloon was inserted into the left ventricle and isovolumic left ventricular function curves were generated. Left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP), heart rate, coronary artery flow, left ventricular end diastolic pressure, myocardial oxygen consumption, oxygen extraction (a - vO2), and contractility (+dp/dt) were measured over a range of left ventricular volumes. Dose-response curves to isoproterenol (10(-9)-10(-8) M) and phenylephrine (10(-9)-10(-6) M) were also obtained. Compared to the control group, ricin pretreatment markedly decreased ventricular compliance (p < 0.01), diminished maximum left ventricular developed pressure (p < 0.05), and reduced maximal +dp/dt (p < 0.05). Myocardial oxygen consumption, heart rate, electrocardiographic PR, QRS, and QT intervals were not different in control and ricin treatment groups. Ricin did not significantly alter the inotropic or chronotropic responses to isoproterenol and phenylephrine. The results from the binding studies showed that ricin neither reduced beta-adrenergic receptor numbers nor altered the dissociation constant. thus, ricin reduced both systolic (LVDP and +dp/dt) and diastolic (compliance) left ventricular functions, perhaps due to increased vascular permeability, without altering responses to the alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor agonists phenylephrine and isoproterenol.",

AUC decreased with increasing distance from the teeth. The mean amount of talinolol absorbed from the test segment per unit time (intestinal transport rate) corresponds to only one-tenth of the amount of drug offered to the test segment (perfusion rate). There was a direct correlation between the perfusion rate of talinolol and its transport rate for both regions and in all subjects investigated. However, to achieve the same transport rate in the distal region a higher perfusion rate is required, compared to the proximal small intestine.

Sinus cycle length in women was longer than during the menstrual than luteal phase but this difference could not account for the gender difference in sinus cycle length. Men also had a greater maximum exercise capacity than women (1295 +/- 167 kpm/min versus 857 +/- 227 kpm/min; P < 0.0001). By analysis of covariance, maximum exercise capacity was the most significant predictor of sinus cycle length (P < 0.0003 at baseline, and P < 0.001 post blockade) and gender did not have a significant effect.

The percentage of patients treated with beta-blocker was higher in the Np than that in the Nn group (Nn: 45%, Np: 64%, p < 0.05) and systolic blood pressure declined at 1 min after exercise from peak exercise in the Nn, but not in the Np group (Nn: 175 --> 167 mmHg, p < 0.05; Np: 170 --> 170 mmHg, not significant). There was no difference in age, other parameters during TET, echocardiographic and coronary angiographic findings and outcome between the Nn and Np group. The incidence of right coronary artery stenosis and that of patients with multi-vessel disease were higher in the Pp than those in the Pn group (Pn: 41%, 58%, Pp: 65%, 73%, both p < 0.05). The occurrence of chest pain during exercise was higher in the Pp than the Pn group in spite of less delta ST at peak exercise. However, systolic blood pressure declined after exercise in the Pn group, but not in the Pp group (Pn: 164 --> 158 mmHg, p < 0.05; Pp: 166 --> 164 mmHg, not significant). These results confirmed that the clinical significance of post-exercise delta ST in patients without TET delta ST differs from that in patients with TET delta ST and suggests that post-exercise delta ST without delta ST during exercise may be associated with an abnormal response to imbalances in the cardiovascular sympathetic system in the post-exercise period rather than with myocardial ischemia.",

    "118": "Inadequate understanding of the design and statistical approach of a clinical trial and the failure to recognize subjective aspects of the analysis often result in misinterpretation of trial results. This is exacerbated by the push to shorten publications and the wish for a simple message that summarizes the outcome of the trial. The purpose of this review is to critically review the design and statistical analyses of the results, to evaluate the assumptions underlying the statistical tests, and to examine the results of exploratory analysis on the interpretation of major findings of the Electrophysiologic Study Versus Electrocardiographic Monitoring (ESVEM) trial. The trial was unusual because its primary objective was to compare testing methods instead of treatments. This necessitated using a subset of the original randomized groups for sensible analysis of the clinical question. Nevertheless, the two groups appeared to be well balanced. The absence of a difference in outcome could be verified by several analyses. In addition, confidence intervals were narrow, indicating the high precision and reliability of the findings. However, the comparison of antiarrhythmic drugs is problematic because the trial was not designed to address this issue. There were differences in the distribution of clinical characteristics between the groups who received different antiarrhythmic drugs. Nevertheless, using both univariate analyses and a variety of adjustments for important prognostic variables, treatment with sotalol appeared to be a significant predictor of reduced arrhythmia recurrence, and sotalol was consistently associated with a trend for nearly a 50% reduction in sudden death and all-cause mortality as compared with the other drugs administered in the trial. In conclusion, the ESVEM trial raises a number of interesting and instructive issues about clinical trial design and analysis.", 
    "119": "Sudden death remains a major problem because the causes are uncontrolled and accurate predictors have not been identified. However, new forms of electrocardiographic (ECG) analyses may provide prognostic information. The Electrophysiologic Study Versus Electrocardiographic Monitoring (ESVEM) trial provides a unique perspective to this issue because baseline and follow-up data were prospectively acquired on a relatively large sample of patients who were homogeneous with respect to sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias, frequent ectopic activity, and inducible sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Although analysis of the large amount of ECG data collected is in progress, initial studies have provided information about unsustained ventricular tachycardia (VTu), heart period (R-R) variability, and the signal-averaged ECG. VTu has been reported to have prognostic implications in several disorders, but its clinical significance in patients with sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias is unknown. The significance of VTu recorded in the baseline (antiarrhythmic drug-free) 48-hour ECG recording in ESVEM study patients was examined; no variable representing the presence of VTu, the frequency of VTu events, or the duration of the longest episode of VTu was a significant predictor of arrhythmia recurrence, arrhythmic death, or all-cause mortality, although a trend was present for worse all-cause mortality in patients with VTu. R-R variability provides powerful prognostic information after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and in patients with chronic ischemic heart disease. In general, R-R variability decreases dramatically at the time of AMI and recovers somewhat during the year after infarction. Although most patients in the ESVEM trial had chronic ischemic heart disease, R-R variability, which has been determined in about three fourths of the patients, was much lower than that reported in patients 1 year after MI. Instead, the mean values were closer to the more depressed values observed shortly after MI. This suggests a greater degree of autonomic dysfunction in patients with sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias, frequent ventricular ectopic activity, and low ejection fractions, as compared with that for patients with chronic ischemic heart disease in general. Signal-averaged ECGs have also been shown to predict arrhythmic events in patients with ischemic heart disease. In a subset of the ESVEM patients, antiarrhythmic drugs that block sodium channels were found to prolong the filtered, signal-averaged QRS duration, especially the late potential portion. This correlated with prolongation of the cycle length of induced ventricular tachycardia. Sotalol appeared to have a differential effect on the signal-averaged ECG; the signal-averaged QRS shortened slightly in patients in whom induction of VT was suppressed by sotalol, whereas it appeared to lengthen slightly in patients in whom VT remained inducible despite sotalol. This suggests that sotalol may affect conduction in diseased tissue in some patients, and that this may affect suppression of ventricular arrhythmia induction by programmed stimulation.", 
    "120": "The Electrophysiologic Study Versus Electrocardiographic Monitoring (ESVEM) trial has recently shown the superiority of sotalol over class-1 agents in lowering the rate of recurrence of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. However, this study was not placebo-controlled, and amiodarone was not included as one of the antiarrhythmic drugs in the trial. Randomized comparative trials between sotalol and amiodarone are available, but the results are inconclusive mainly because of small sample sizes. Because of the specific pharmacokinetics of amiodarone, sotalol has become the first-line agent in the management of ventricular arrhythmias. Because this policy is based on expediency rather than follow-up data, the long-term efficacy, morbidity, and safety of sotalol should be compared with those of amiodarone as well as of nonpharmacological treatment modes for ventricular tachyarrhythmias, such as implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapy in prospective trials. Until these issues are resolved, it is incorrect to say that sotalol should be the first-line agent in the management of ventricular arrhythmias.", 
    "121": "The choice of initial therapy for patients with malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias is examined based on clinical efficacy, patient safety, and cost. Antiarrhythmic drug therapy can be administered using a guided or empiric approach. Guided type-1 antiarrhythmic drug therapy has been associated with high arrhythmia recurrence rates (> 40% at 1 year) and moderate sudden death rates (10% at 1 year). Sotalol is associated with lower arrhythmia recurrence rates (20% at 1 year) that increase to 50% at 4 years. Beta-blocking agents have a limited role as stand-alone therapy in this condition. Empiric amiodarone therapy has sudden death-free survival rates of 82% at 2 years but has significantly poorer results in patients with ejection fractions < or = 40%. In contrast, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy has reported sudden death recurrence rates of 1% to 2% per year, with a cumulative index of 10% at 5 years. Total survival rate of ICD recipients ranges from 85% to 92% at 2 years. In patients with good left ventricular function, it approaches 90% at 5 years, whereas it is between 50% to 60% in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction. Data from device memory indicate an absolute reduction in mortality rates with ICD intervention. Comparison of drug and device therapy has been performed in retrospective and prospective studies. Improved survival with device therapy is noted, particularly in patients with ejection fractions < or = 35% to 40% in retrospective studies. The results of two small prospective randomized trials also show significant survival advantage as compared with those for type-1C drugs and a mixed group of antiarrhythmic drugs. An initial strategy of ICD therapy was shown to be superior in the Netherlands Cooperative Study. The 30-day perioperative mortality rate of ICD therapy of 0.8% contrasts favorably with a 13% mortality rate in the ESVEM trial with antiarrhythmic drugs and a 3.5% mortality rate in the CASCADE study. Economic analyses show that drug therapy and device therapy are both within the range of other current cardiovascular therapies. An improving economic profile for device therapy has been observed with nonthoracotomy and pectoral implantation and direct use of ICD therapy because primary therapy shortens hospital stay and reduces costs. Based on available data, ICD therapy is preferable as initial therapy in patients with malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias.", 
    "122": "Two recent studies have evaluated the utility of electrophysiologic (EP) testing in the treatment of patients with serious ventricular arrhythmias. The first study compared electrophysiologically guided antiarrhythmic drug therapy with nonguided beta-blocker therapy. Patients without inducible arrhythmias were assigned to oral metoprolol; patients with inducible arrhythmias were randomly assigned to receive either oral metoprolol or EP-guided drug therapy with propafenone, flecainide, disopyramide, sotalol, or amiodarone. Antiarrhythmic drugs were tested in a random order, but amiodarone was always tested last. A total of 170 patients were evaluated; 115 patients had inducible arrhythmias, and 61 patients were randomly assigned to serial drug testing, 54 to metoprolol without invasive testing, and the remainder who were noninducible to empiric metoprolol. The best outcome was observed in patients without inducible arrhythmias, all of whom received metoprolol. There was no difference in outcome between the two groups with inducible arrhythmias, either treated with metoprolol or with EP-guided serial antiarrhythmic drug testing. The second study evaluated survivors of out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation (VF) without new myocardial infarction. Patients received assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction, Holter monitoring (HM), and EP testing. Only patients with inducible sustained ventricular arrhythmias or with sufficient ambulatory ventricular ectopy were included in the study. Therapy was randomized either to empiric amiodarone or conventional drug therapy guided by EP testing and/or HM. A total of 228 patients were treated, 113 with amiodarone and 115 with conventional antiarrhythmic drug therapy. The composite primary end points were total mortality, documented out-of-hospital resuscitation from recurrent VF, or syncopal implantable cardioverter/defibrillator shock followed by return of consciousness. Patients treated with empiric amiodarone had a better outcome than did patients treated with guided conventional drug therapy. In those patients in whom an implantable cardioverter/defibrillator was used, patients treated with amiodarone had fewer total shocks and fewer syncopal shocks than did patients treated with conventional therapy. Patients with a history of out-of-hospital VF or sustained ventricular tachycardia without inducible ventricular arrhythmias at EP study have the best outcome. Empiric metoprolol is equivalent to conventional antiarrhythmic drug therapy guided by EP testing. Empiric amiodarone is superior to conventional antiarrhythmic drug therapy guided by HM and/or EP testing.",

Both agonists were 10 times more potent than L-isoproterenol and fenoterol and 100 times more potent than albuterol. L-Isoproterenol and fenoterol induced > 90% relaxation (percentage of maximal aminophylline relaxation). Formoterol and albuterol were equally efficacious. Formoterol was more efficacious (86 +/- 5%) than salmeterol (62 +/- 3%) or soterenol (59 +/- 3%). In minimally contracted tissues (10 microM histamine), agonist potencies increased 10-fold and relaxation was complete. In [125I]iodocyanopindolol-labeled bronchial membranes, formoterol and salmeterol induced high-affinity states of the beta 2-receptor (pKh 9.6 +/- 0.4 and 10.4 +/- 0.7, respectively), the former inducing a higher percentage (57 +/- 6 versus 28 +/- 4, p < 0.05). Only low-affinity binding (pKI) was observed when guanine nucleotide was present. pD2 values were similar to pKh values and relative efficacies significantly correlated with percentage of pKI sites. Formoterol and salmeterol were highly selective for the beta 2 versus beta 1-subtype (pKI values were 8.2 +/- 0.09 and 6.25 +/- 0.06 and 8.3 +/- 0.04 and 5.7 +/- 0.04, respectively). Albuterol (5.83 +/- 0.06 and 4.71 +/- 0.16) and fenoterol (6.33 +/- 0.07 and 5.67 +/- 0.05) were less selective. These results can explain the potencies and efficacies of salmeterol and formoterol in humans.", 
    "128": "The high selectivity of amphetamine and its derivatives for CYP2D-mediated oxidations suggested the use of the phenylisopropylamine skeleton as a template for a selective inhibitor of this important enzyme. Accordingly, 4-allyloxymethamphetamine-amine (ALLMA) was synthesized and its ability to selectively inactivate CYP2D was investigated both in in vitro and in vivo experiments. Incubation studies with rat liver microsomes demonstrated that this compound suppressed the CYP2D-mediated methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) demethylation in time- and dose-dependent manner and that the inhibition required the presence of NADPH. The development of irreversible inhibition was associated with oxidation at position 4 of the aromatic ring, the common site of CYP2D-mediated oxidation of this group of compounds. In in vivo studies doses of ALLMA (1-10 mg/kg) were administered to adult male Sprague-Dawley rats and liver microsomes were obtained 3 hr later. Methamphetamine p-hydroxylation and low Km MDMA demethylation activities, both mediated by CYP2D, were reduced by more than 80% after a dose of 10 mg/kg. Cytochrome P-450 reactions attributed to P-450s other than CYP2D, such as aniline p-hydroxylation, the high Km system of MDMA demethylation and the N-demethylation of methamphetamine, benzphetamine, aminopyrine and erythromycin, all appeared to be minimally affected. The importance of aromatic ring oxidation in the metabolism is such that inhibition of CYP2D would be expected to cause a significant change in the pharmacokinetics of these compounds. The kinetics of MDMA metabolic activity in microsomes from ALLMA-pretreated rats were comparable to those from female Dark-Agouti rats, an animal model for CYP2D1 deficiency.", 
    "129": "Autoradiographic analysis of 14C-2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) uptake and immunocytochemical assessment of Fos-like immunoreactivity (Fos-LI) were used to assess swim stress-induced changes in metabolic activity in brain and to define the effect of chronic treatment with antidepressants from different pharmacological classes. Saline-treated rats processed in the forced swim test exhibited marked increases in Fos-LI in limbic cortical regions, lateral septum, medial amygdala and paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN). Uptake of 2-DG was increased by swim stress in some of the same brain regions where Fos-LI was induced, with the notable exception of a lack of a change in the PVN. Rats received injections for 3 wk with imipramine, desipramine, fluoxetine, nisoxetine, tranylcypromine or mianserin before being processed in the forced swim test. Chronic treatment with imipramine and desipramine alone induced Fos-LI in the central nucleus of the amygdala and the dorsolateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. After tranylcypromine treatment, Fos-LI was induced in many brain regions including limbic cortex, amygdala and paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. None of the other antidepressants induced Fos-LI in any brain region examined. Chronic administration of imipramine, desipramine and nisoxetine antagonized the swim induced expression of Fos-LI in the PVN and in limbic cortical regions, including the medial prefrontal ventrolateral orbital and cingulate cortices. Chronic treatment with fluoxetine, tranylcypromine and mianserin did not alter swim stress-induced Fos-LI in any brain region. Thus, only antidepressant drugs that affect norepinephrine uptake (i.e., imipramine, desipramine and nisoxetine) antagonized swim stress-induced Fos-LI. In contrast to the action of chronic imipramine on Fos-LI induced by swim, chronic administration of imipramine did not antagonize the stress-induced changes in 2-DG uptake in limbic cortical regions. Acute administration of propranolol, which blocks beta-adrenergic receptors, reduced the number of cells staining for Fos-LI in limbic cortical regions, resembling the effects produced by chronic imipramine, desipramine and nisoxetine. In the PVN, neither propranolol nor prazosin (an alpha 1 antagonist) blocked the swim-induced Fos-LI, suggesting that swim-induced Fos-LI in the PVN is not under control of beta- or alpha 1-adrenergic receptors. These latter results imply that adaptation of noradrenergic receptors by chronic imipramine may not be related to the antagonism of stress-induced Fos-LI. The clear functional differences of the various antidepressant agents on swim stress-induced Fos-LI after chronic administration provide a functional classification of antidepressant drug action not previously identified.",

The mechanisms underlying cachexia are largely unknown, and studies in experimental animals have focused mainly on solid tumors. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to quantify and investigate cachexia in experimentally induced T-cell leukemia in the rat. Induction of leukemia by serial passage (injection of cervical lymph node suspension) resulted in a rapid increase in white blood cell (WBC count, hypertrophy of the spleen (by day 11), and severe morbidity within 17 to 18 days. Body weight gain and food intake declined steadily in leukemic animals from day 12, although weight loss was significantly greater in pair-fed, nonleukemic animals. However, leukemic rats had a lower body fat content and higher water content than pair-fed animals on day 18, so the measurement of body weight significantly underestimated the severity of cachexia. Resting oxygen consumption (VO2), measured during the light phase, declined in pair-fed animals from day 13, but was elevated in leukemic rats on days 12 to 18 by 25% (P < .05, one-way ANOVA) compared with pair-fed rats and by 7% (P < .05, one-way ANOVA) relative to free-feeding controls. Hypermetabolism was associated with an increase in brown adipose tissue (BAT) activity (74% and 89%, respectively, P < .05, one-way ANOVA) in leukemic rats compared with control and pair-fed groups. Effects of leukemia on VO2 and BAT were prevented by administration of the adrenergic antagonist, propranolol. These results indicate that T-cell leukemia in the rat results in rapid and severe cachexia, which is largely due to marked hypophagia, but is also accompanied by inappropriately high rates of energy expenditure that are mediated by sympathetic activation of BAT thermogenesis.", 
    "140": "Despite recent advances in techniques of reperfusion for acute myocardial ischemia, myocardial salvage remains suboptimal. Beta-blockers have been shown to limit infarct size during acute ischemia, but their negative inotropic properties have limited their use. Cardiopulmonary bypass is an attractive technique for cardiac resuscitation because it can stabilize a hemodynamically compromised patient and potentially reduce myocardial oxygen consumption. In an attempt to maximize myocardial salvage in the setting of acute ischemia, the combination of esmolol, an ultrashort-acting beta-blocker, with percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass was evaluated. Four groups of instrumented dogs underwent 2 hours of myocardial ischemia induced by occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery, followed by 1 hour of reperfusion. Throughout the period of ischemia and reperfusion, esmolol plus percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass was compared with esmolol alone, percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass alone, and control conditions. After the reperfusion period, the extent of infarction of the left ventricle at risk was determined. Four animals had intractable arrhythmias: one in the esmolol plus bypass group, one in the esmolol group, and two in the control group. The extent of infarction of the left ventricle at risk was significantly reduced in the esmolol plus bypass group (30%) compared with bypass alone (52%), with esmolol alone (54%), and with the control groups (59%; p < 0.05). We conclude that in this experimental model the combination of esmolol with bypass improves myocardial salvage after ischemia and reperfusion.", 
    "141": "The effect of spironolactone on esophageal variceal pressure (VP) in patients without ascites was investigated. VP was assessed using a noninvasive endoscopic gauge. Spironolactone was administered during a 6-week period at a dosage of 100 mg/d. This treatment decreased VP from 16.8 +/- 1.9 (SD) to 14.1 +/- 2.7 mm Hg (P < .001) in a group of 12 patients and from 18.6 +/- 2.1 to 13.7 +/- 4.1 mm Hg (P < .01) in another group of 8 patients who still had high VP despite chronic intake of propranolol. In both groups, placebo administration to 12 and 8 comparable patients did not significantly alter VP. Spironolactone induced a significant reduction of plasma volume (42.1 +/- 5.5 to 36.1 +/- 6.6 mL/kg body weight, P < .01) and of the concentration of alpha-atrial natriuretic peptide (alpha-ANP) (39.8 +/- 22 to 27.7 +/- 20 pg/mL, P < .01); in addition, a pronounced increase in plasma renin activity (PRA) (1.1 +/- 0.9 to 7.5 +/- 3.4 ng/mL/h, P < .001) was induced by the treatment. No significant changes in systemic hemodynamics were observed during the studies. Severe side effects were not observed except for a high incidence (55%) of painful gynecomasty in the male patients. In conclusion, chronic spironolactone administration effectively lowers VP, even in patients under chronic propranolol therapy. The combination of propranolol and spironolactone deserves further study as a prophylactic therapy of variceal hemorrhage, but development of gynecomasty might be a problem. Finally, we confirmed the reproducibility of VP measurements with the noninvasive gauge in chronic conditions.", 
    "142": "[Arg8]-vasopressin (AVP) is both a potent vasoconstrictor and a mitogen for vascular smooth muscle cells. AVP binds to a single class of receptors (V1a) in the A7r5 rat aortic smooth muscle cell line (Kd approximately 2 nmol/L). Stimulation of these cells with AVP results in an increase in cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) by releasing intracellular Ca2+ stores and increasing Ca2+ influx; the EC50 for these effects is approximately 5 nmol/L. AVP has recently been reported to stimulate arachidonic acid release in primary cultures of rat aortic smooth muscle over a much lower concentration range (EC50 approximately 0.05 nmol/L). The present study examined the effects of varying concentrations of AVP on spontaneous Ca2+ spiking activity in fura 2-loaded A7r5 cells. Frequency of CA2+ spiking increased with increasing [AVP] in the range of 10 to 500 pmol/L. Higher concentrations of AVP inhibited spiking but elicited the characteristic [Ca2+]i changes ascribed to the release of Ca2+ stores and increased Ca2+ entry. The effects of both low and high concentrations of AVP were inhibited by [1-(beta-mercapto-beta,beta,-pentamethylenepropionic acid),2-0-methyltyrosine]arginine vasopressin, a selective V1a vasopressin antagonist. Nimodipine (50 nmol/L), a blocker of L-type voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels, abolished the Ca(2+)-spiking activity without inhibiting a maximal [Ca2+]i response to AVP (1 mumol/L). AVP-stimulated Ca2+ spiking, but not release of intracellular Ca2+ stores, was also abolished by ONO-RS-082 (1 mumol/L), an inhibitor of phospholipase A2. These results suggest that occupation of a small fraction of V1a vasopressin receptors by AVP results in stimulation of phospholipase A2 and leads to increased Ca(2+)-spiking activity. This effect may be important for fine tuning of vascular tone, whereas maximal stimulation by AVP (full receptor occupancy) may be required for more vigorous or sustained vasoconstriction or mitogenesis.", 
    "143": "Azimilide exhibited antiarrhythmic activity in several rodent models of ventricular arrhythmias. In the mouse chloroform model, azimilide provided limited efficacy by the i.p. route (50% at 100 mg/kg versus 20% by vehicle), and no efficacy by the oral route (300 mg/kg). In a rat model in which arrhythmias are induced by ligation and reperfusion of the left descending coronary artery (CALR model), azimilide provided dose-dependent (1-18 mg/kg) efficacy by the intravenous route. The estimated dose that suppressed ventricular fibrillation (VF) was 5.0 mg/kg i.v. At 18 mg/kg i.v. azimilide also partially suppressed ventricular tachyarrhythmia (VT) and extrasystoles (VES). Rats dosed orally (100 mg/kg) were fully protected from VF. In isolated guinea pig hearts exposed to 1 microM ouabain, azimilide at 10 microM prevented the VT and VF seen in 69% and 23%, respectively, of control hearts. In anesthetized guinea pigs, azimilide at 10 and 30 mg/kg i.v. increased the dose of ouabain required to induce VES. While sematilide, dofetilide, and E-4031 significantly increased sensitivity to the arrhythmogenic actions of ouabain (by lowering the dose that caused VF), azimilide did not. Azimilide's antiarrhythmic profile in these rodent models differs from that of other class III agents, since azimilide had less efficacy in the mouse chloroform model, could suppress VT and VES as well as VF in the CALR rat model, and protected from or did not aggravate cardiac glycoside-induced arrhythmias in guinea pigs. These results demonstrating the antiarrhythmic efficacy of azimilide in the intact animal suggest that the compound has a different profile than other class III agents.", 
    "144": "Optimal drug therapy for patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is well described in the medical literature. However, data on the actual pharmacologic management of patients surviving AMI at academic hospitals is unavailable. The purpose of this study was to document treatment profiles in 500 patients surviving AMI at 12 academic hospitals in the United States. These profiles were compared with established guidelines and were evaluated for trends. Overall, thrombolytics (streptokinase > or = tissue-type plasminogen activator) were administered in 29% of the patients, with a greater proportion of patients receiving beta-blockers than calcium channel antagonists in the initial 72 hours (61% vs 40%; p < 0.005) and at discharge (51% vs 35%; p < 0.005). Further, women were less likely than men to receive thrombolytic therapy (odds ratio [OR] = 0.61; confidence interval [CI], 0.54 to 0.69) or beta-blocker therapy within the first 72 hours (OR = 0.61; CI, 0.55 to 0.67) or at hospital discharge (OR = 0.53; CI, 0.48 to 0.58). Overall, improvements could still be made in the number of patients who receive thrombolytic and acute and chronic beta-blocker therapies after AMI, particularly in women. Changes in treatment profiles may be a reflection of the publication of large clinical trials.", 
    "145": "We studied the perioperative regulation of the beta-adrenergic receptor (beta AR) system in lymphocytes obtained before and after surgery from 12 patients undergoing cesarean delivery with spinal anesthesia. Receptor number (Bmax) and binding affinity (KD) were determined by Scatchard analysis of [125I]iodopindolol saturation binding curves. Receptor function was assessed by measuring cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) production in the unstimulated state and in response to stimulation by isoproterenol, forskolin, and prostaglandin E1. Basal cAMP production increased 48% postoperatively (P < 0.05), while stimulated cAMP production and Bmax and KD were not significantly changed after surgery. The response to surgery of the beta AR system on these patients differed from that of patients undergoing cardiothoracic and abdominal surgery in whom we previously found postoperative down-regulation and desensitization of the beta AR system. It is possible that this difference in response is due to amelioration of the stress response to surgery by regional anesthesia, and/or alterations in beta AR status by pregnancy. We conclude that pregnancy and regional anesthesia, but not changes in lymphocyte subset distribution, contributed to the lack of effect of surgery on the beta AR system in the patients studied.", 
    "146": "We compared the therapeutic efficacy and safety of timolol hemihydrate to timolol maleate in patients with ocular hypertension and chronic open-angle glaucoma.", 
    "147": "We conducted this three-month study as a multicentered, masked, parallel group comparison. Both the 0.25% and 0.5% concentrations were evaluated against similar concentrations of timolol maleate. Dosing was twice daily. An open-label, nine-month study followed the masked portion of the protocol, in which all patients received either 0.25% or 0.5% timolol hemihydrate. A total of 371 patients were included in both the 0.25% and 0.5% studies.", 
    "148": "We found statistically similar intraocular pressures with both the 0.25% (18.3 and 18.6 mm Hg for the hemihydrate and maleate groups, respectively) and 0.5% (19.9 and 19.5 mm Hg for the hemihydrate and maleate groups, respectively) concentrations of timolol hemihydrate and timolol maleate after three months of masked treatment. Likewise, peak intraocular effect at two hours after taking the medication was statistically similar between medicines at both concentrations. Likewise, both ocular and systemic safety were similar between the maleate and hemihydrate preparations at both concentrations. In the nine-month open-label protocol, therapeutic efficacy (19.9 and 19.1 mm Hg for the 0.25% and 0.5% concentrations, respectively) and safety of timolol hemihydrate were similar to effect and safety of the three-month protocol.", 
    "149": "This study suggests that timolol hemihydrate had an ocular hypotensive efficacy and safety profile statistically equivalent to that of timolol maleate for up to three months of therapy. Timolol hemihydrate showed efficacy and safety similar to that observed within the first three months, for up to one year of therapy.", 
    "150": "The reflex tracheal response induced by bronchoconstriction was investigated using a newly devised tracheo-bronchi preparation in anesthetized guinea pigs. Tracheal constriction and subsequent dilatation were observed in response to bronchoconstriction induced by the inhalation of 0.001-0.01% histamine and 0.003-0.03% acetylcholine. These tracheal responses were abolished by cervical vagotomy or treatment of the tracheal site with 1% tetrodotoxin. Tracheal constriction and dilatation were significantly inhibited by 0.1% atropine and 1% propranolol, respectively. When high tracheal tone was induced by 0.01% serotonin, the residual tracheal dilatation observed in the presence of propranolol was enhanced, while dilatation was completely inhibited by 1% hexamethonium. Dilatation was also suppressed by 1% N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) and 1% methylene blue. The tracheal constriction produced by bronchoconstriction was significantly enhanced by propranolol 2 mg/kg, i.v. and L-NAME 10 mg/kg, i.v. These results demonstrate that a vagally mediated reflex tracheal response (constriction followed by dilatation) is induced by bronchoconstriction in anesthetized guinea pigs. Cholinergic nerves may mediate the constriction, and adrenergic and nonadrenergic noncholinergic (NANC) inhibitory nerves may mediate the dilatation. Furthermore, NO may be involved in the NANC reflex tracheal dilatation.", 
    "151": "The use of ACE-inhibitors in heart failure has been established over the past years. Their use is of uncertain value in the early phases of myocardial infarction, where they are supposed to prevent left ventricular dilatation. More recent studies (ISIS-4, GISSI-3) have tested early treatment by ACE-inhibitors in the acute phase of myocardial infarction. On one hand, it was possible to disprove reservations about risks (hypotension)n in a large cohort; on the other hand, a further reduction of mortality in hospitalized patients by 7% has been shown, corresponding to five patient lives saved for 1000 treated patients. Thus, after institution of the customary therapy of myocardial infarction (inhibitor of platelet aggregation, thrombolysis, beta-blocker) and after exclusion of specific contraindications (hypotension < 100 mmHg, renal failure) ACE-inhibitors could be administered in the acute phase of myocardial infarction. An analysis of the results from these large trials will show whether ACE-inhibitors may benefit groups of patients at particular risks (Killip > 1, age > 70 years, preceding renal failure) noticeably. ACE-inhibitors remain the treatment of choice in patients with developing left ventricular failure.", 
    "152": "The present experiments were conducted to investigate the role of the alpha 1-, alpha 2- and beta-adrenergic receptors of the median preoptic area (MnPO) on the water intake and urinary electrolyte excretion, elicited by central injections of angiotensin II (ANG II). Prazosin (an alpha 1-adrenergic receptor antagonist) and yohimbine (an alpha 2-adrenergic receptor antagonist) antagonized the water ingestion, Na+, K+, and urine excretion induced by ANG II. Administration of propranolol, a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist increased the Na+, K+, and urine excretion induced by ANG II. Previous treatment with prazosin and yohimbine reduced the pressor responses to ANG II. These results suggest that the adrenergic neurotransmission in the MnPO may actively participate in ANG II-induced dipsogenesis, natriuresis, kaliuresis, diuresis and pressor responses in a process that involves alpha 1-, alpha 2-, and beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "153": "Power spectral analysis of heart rate (HR) variability was tested in conscious rabbits to assess the reliability of this method for assessing cardiac autonomic function in normal rabbits under resting conditions. Evaluation of power spectrum was performed in 5 rabbits under normal resting conditions and after sympathetic, parasympathetic and combined sympathetic plus parasympathetic blockade. Rabbits were randomly assigned to undergo sympathetic (propranolol) or parasympathetic (methscopolamine) blockade at the initial step followed by combined blockade. The power spectrum of heart-rate variability in rabbits was presented as one broad spectral component at frequencies mainly between 0 and 0.5 Hz. This component was considerably modulated by both sympathetic and parasympathetic influences with substantial overlap of sympathetic- and parasympathetic-related components of the spectrogram. Nevertheless, it was clearly shown that power of heart-rate variability at frequencies from 0.4373 Hz to 0.5625 Hz was determined only by parasympathetic influences, and sympathetic modulation of HR was presented mainly at frequencies from 0.0625 Hz to 0.1875 Hz. Spectral subcomponent analysis of the power spectrum of HR variability may be useful to follow changes in cardiac autonomic function in rabbits.", 
    "154": "The low mortality of programmed surgical treatment of aortic abdominal aneurysms (2-4%) contrasts with a high mortality of surgical treatment in case of rupture (70-90%). These data underline the benefit of a \"prophylactic\" surgical treatment of aortic abdominal aneurysms, even those of small size or in older patients. Recently, experimental models and results of a few clinical studies suggest that medical treatment with beta-adrenergic blocking agents may reduce the expansion rate of aortic abdominal aneurysms and thus lower the risk of rupture. Several questions remains open. Should beta-blocking agents be reserved for aneurysms more than 5 cm in diameter in patients with a contraindication for surgery, or on the contrary proposed for aneurysms less than 4 cm in diameter in patients still free of contraindications? What is the mode and delay of action for beta-blockers, their effect on modulating blood pressure and their contribution to the use of endoluminal prostheses? Controlled prospective trials enrolling a large number of patients are required to answer these questions.", 
    "155": "Calcium antagonists are used frequently in management of hypertension. In addition to their cardiovascular effects, these drugs inhibit platelet aggregation. Therefore we examined whether the use of calcium antagonists was associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal haemorrhage (GIH).", 
    "156": "A prospective cohort study was conducted from 1985 through 1992 on 1636 hypertensive persons aged > or = 68 years living in three communities. The participants were taking beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or calcium antagonists; those taking combinations of these drugs were excluded. The incidence of GIH was assessed by surveying hospital discharge diagnoses and deaths. Age, gender, disability, arterial pressure, other drugs, and comorbid conditions were examined as confounders.", 
    "157": "Compared with beta-blockers (4819 person-years, 65 events), after adjustment for confounders the relative risk for GIH associated with ACE inhibitor (772 person-years, 13 events) was 1.23 (95% CI 0.66-2.28) and with calcium antagonists (1510 person-years, 42 events) it was 1.86 (1.22-2.82). The risks for verapamil, diltiazem, and nifedipine did not differ significantly. The results were unchanged when the analyses were restricted to severe events (GIH in conjunction with blood transfusion or death).", 
    "158": "Calcium antagonists were associated with an increased risk of GIH in this population. Therefore caution is needed in prescription of these agents to old patients who have other risk factors for gastrointestinal bleeding.", 
    "159": "Although uncommon, torsades de pointes (TdP) associated with astemizole and/or erythromycin use have been reported previously. We describe a 30-year-old woman who had congenital prolongation of QT interval and TdP occurred after taking astemizole and erythromycin. Temporary cardiac pacing was successful in suppressing TdP. Prolongation of QT interval had good response to oral propranolol."
