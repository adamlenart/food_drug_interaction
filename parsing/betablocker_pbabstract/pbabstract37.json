    "0": "\u03b2-adrenergic receptors (\u03b2-AR) are widely distributed in the cardiovascular system, where they considerably contribute to the control of its functions. \u03b2-blockers are commonly used in the treatment of disorders of the circulatory system. They act primarily by inhibiting cardiac \u03b2-receptors. However, there are also reports of pleiotropic action of \u03b2-blockers as well as of new compounds created to study \u03b23 adrenergic receptors. The study aimed to investigate additional mechanisms of action of \u03b2-AR inhibitors in the rabbit abdominal aorta with emphasis on their action on \u03b1-adrenergic receptors and calcium influx. Responses to propranolol, betaxolol, metoprolol and SR59230A were evaluated in phenylephrine and PGF(2alpha) precontracted aortic rings. The effect of propranolol on the phenylephrine concentration-contraction curve was examined. Propranolol (\u2265 10 \u03bcM) and SR59230A (\u2265 0.1 \u03bcM) induced relaxations in phenylephrine-precontracted rings, while betaxolol and metoprolol had little effect. The \u03b2-AR inhibitors produced further contraction of tissues preincubated with PGF(2alpha), excluding SR59230A, which after initial contraction, elicited marked relaxation at a concentration above 1 \u0115M. 100 \u03bcM of propranolol caused a significant rightward shift of the concentration-contraction curve to phenylephrine with no reduction in the maximum response. Incubation of aortic rings in phentolamine reduced the maximal contraction to propranolol; verapamil pretreatment by contrast enhanced contractile response. In conclusion, SR59230A and propranolol most probably act as \u03b11-AR competitive antagonists in the presence of phenylephrine in rabbit abdominal aortic rings. After \u03b1-ARs blockade, propranolol exerts a weak relaxing activity connected with Ca2+ channel inactivation. SR59230A at a high concentration acts on the rabbit aorta by an additional mechanism needing further investigation.", 
    "1": "Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a genetic myocardial disorder characterized by the replacement of myocardium by fibro-adipose tissue. The proper obstetric management of this disease remains unclear due to the lack of an adequate number of cases reported in the literature. We report the successful management of a pregnant patient with ARVC. A female patient with ARVC presented to our hospital at 9 weeks of gestation. Before pregnancy, she was treated with bisoprolol, which resulted in a reduction in extrasystoles and she never developed palpitations. Periodical cardiological examinations showed clinical stability, and the only therapeutic change consisted of an increase in the bisoprolol dosage. She delivered at term by elective cesarean section. We decided that avoiding changes in the chronic therapy of our patient was the best management because she had reached clinical stability before pregnancy and discontinuation of therapy may pose an addition risk. In our opinion, cesarean section was the best mode of delivery in our ARVC patient to avoid the stress of labor, which may raise heart rate and cause arrhythmia. Our experience and the case reports in the literature suggest that pregnancy is tolerated in female patients with ARVC, but they need to be monitored during pregnancy by a multidisciplinary team.",

This article reviews the optimal pharmacological management of ACS managed non-invasively. There is strong evidence to support the prescription of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT; aspirin with a P2Y12 inhibitor). DAPT should continue for 12 months after an ACS, then aspirin should be continued indefinitely. Anticoagulation with warfarin or a novel oral anticoagulant may be needed if atrial fibrillation occurs; the combination with DAPT increases the risk of bleeding. Unless contraindicated, high-intensity statin therapy should be prescribed for all post-ACS patients irrespective of their cholesterol level. Non-statin lipid therapy has not been shown to improve outcomes. Use of \u03b2-adrenergic blockers is recommended in most guidelines, but the clinical trials to support this recommendation were performed more than 30 years ago, and routine long-term use may not be relevant to modern treatment, except when there is cardiac failure or left ventricular dysfunction. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers are also widely recommended, but the evidence for benefit is stronger when there is left ventricular dysfunction.

    "62": "Doxycycline is the standard systemic treatment for rosacea. Recently, there have been a few reports on \u03b2-adrenergic blockers such as nadolol, carvedilol and propranolol for suppressing flushing reactions in rosacea. To our knowledge, there are no comparative studies of propranolol and doxycycline, and combination therapy using both. The aim of this study was to investigate and compare the efficacy and safety of monotherapy of propranolol, doxycycline and combination therapy. A total of 78 patients who visited Pusan National University Hospital and were diagnosed with rosacea were included in this study. Among them, 28 patients were in the propranolol group, 22 the doxycycline group and 28 the combination group. We investigated the patient global assessment (PGA), investigator global assessment (IGA), assessment of rosacea clinical score (ARCS) and adverse effects. Improvement in PGA and IGA scores from baseline was noted in all groups, and the combination therapy was found to be the most effective during the entire period, but this was statistically insignificant. The reduction rate of ARCS during the treatment period was also highest in the combination group (57.4%), followed by the doxycycline group (52.2%) and the propranolol group (51.0%). Three patients in the combination group had mild and transient gastrointestinal disturbances but there was no significant difference from the other groups. We conclude that the combination therapy of doxycycline and propranolol is effective and safe treatment for rosacea and successful for reducing both flushing and papulation in particular.",

    "68": "Taurine (2-aminoethanesulfonic acid) is widely distributed in animal tissues and has diverse pharmacological effects. However, the role of taurine in modulating smooth muscle contractility is still controversial. We propose that taurine (5-80 mM) can exert bidirectional modulation on the contractility of isolated rat jejunal segments. Different low and high contractile states were induced in isolated jejunal segments of rats to observe the effects of taurine and the associated mechanisms. Taurine induced stimulatory effects on the contractility of isolated rat jejunal segments at 3 different low contractile states, and inhibitory effects at 3 different high contractile states. Bidirectional modulation was not observed in the presence of verapamil or tetrodotoxin, suggesting that taurine-induced bidirectional modulation is Ca(2+) dependent and requires the presence of the enteric nervous system. The stimulatory effects of taurine on the contractility of isolated jejunal segments was blocked by atropine but not by diphenhydramine or by cimetidine, suggesting that muscarinic-linked activation was involved in the stimulatory effects when isolated jejunal segments were in a low contractile state. The inhibitory effects of taurine on the contractility of isolated jejunal segments were blocked by propranolol and L-NG-nitroarginine but not by phentolamine, suggesting that adrenergic \u03b2 receptors and a nitric oxide relaxing mechanism were involved when isolated jejunal segments were in high contractile states. No bidirectional effects of taurine on myosin phosphorylation were observed. The contractile states of jejunal segments determine taurine-induced stimulatory or inhibitory effects, which are associated with muscarinic receptors and adrenergic \u03b2 receptors, and a nitric oxide associated relaxing mechanism.",

We investigated the interactions between tramadol, a clinically used analgesic, and brain CYP2D regulators, by establishing concentration-time curves of tramadol and O-desmethyltramadol (M1) in rat cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma, as well as by analyzing the analgesia-time course of tramadol. 2. Propranolol (20\u2009\u03bcg, intracerebroventricular injection), CYP2D inhibitor, prolonged the elimination t1/2 of tramadol (40\u2009mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection) in the CSF; meanwhile, lower Cmax and AUC0-\u221e values of M1 were observed. Nicotine (1\u2009mg base/kg, subcutaneous injection, seven days), brain CYP2D inducer, induced a shorter Tmax and elevated Cmax of M1 in CSF. No differences in the peripheral metabolism of tramadol were observed following propranolol and nicotine pretreatment. Nicotine increased areas under the analgesia-time curve (AUC) for 0-45\u2009min and 0-90\u2009min of tramadol, which was attenuated by propranolol administration. The analgesic actions of tramadol positively correlated with cerebral M1 concentration. 3. The results suggest that the regulation of brain CYP2D by xenobiotics may cause drug-drug interactions (DDIs) of tramadol. Brain CYPs may play an important role in DDIs of centrally active substances.",

All compounds were characterized using established physicochemical and spectroscopic methods. Crystal structures were determined for three Schiff bases (SMML, SBML, SBLA) and two Cu(II) complexes (Cu(SMML)2 and Cu(SMLA)2). In order to provide more insight into the behavior of the complexes in solution, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and electrochemical experiments were performed. The parent ligands and their respective copper(II) complexes exhibited moderate antibacterial activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. The most active ligand (SB4CB) and its analogous S-methyl derivative (SM4CB) were conjugated with various vector moieties: polyarginines (R1, R4, R9, and RW9), oligoethylene glycol (OEG), and an efflux pump blocker, phenylalanine-arginine-\u03b2-naphthylamide (PA\u03b2N). Nonaarginine (R9) derivatives showed the most encouraging synergistic effects upon conjugation and complexation with copper ion including enhanced water solubility, bacteria cell membrane permeability, and bioactivity. These Cu(II)-R9 derivatives display remarkable antibacterial activity against a wide spectrum of bacteria and, in particular, are highly efficacious against Staphylococcus aureus with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 0.5-1 \u03bcM.

Metoprolol was proven to be the most effective drug to decelerate the arrhythmia rate and relieve symptoms. Electrophysiology study was performed in 5 patients and the earliest activation with a sharp RBB potential was localized in the mid or distal RBB area. Catheter ablation terminated the arrhythmia with subsequent RBB block morphology during sinus rhythm.

We propose an inflammatory pathway of diabetic retinopathy in which macrophages in the diabetic eye provide TGF\u03b2 to retinal endothelial cells (REC) in the retinal microvasculature. In response to TGF\u03b2, REC synthesize and secrete a pro-apoptotic BIGH3 (TGF\u03b2-Induced Gene Human Clone 3) protein, which acts in an autocrine loop to induce REC apoptosis. Rhesus monkey retinal endothelial cells (RhREC) were treated with dMCM (cell media of macrophages treated with high glucose and LDL) and assayed for apoptosis (TUNEL), BIGH3 mRNA (qPCR), and protein (Western blots) expressions. Cells were also treated with \u03a4GF\u03b21 and 2 for BIGH3 mRNA and protein expression. Inhibition assays were carried out using antibodies for TGF\u03b21 and for BIGH3 to block apoptosis and mRNA expression. BIGH3 in cultured RhREC cells were identified by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Distribution of BIGH3 and macrophages in the diabetic mouse retina was examined with IHC. RhRECs treated with dMCM or TGF\u03b2 showed a significant increase in apoptosis and BIGH3 protein expression. Recombinant BIGH3 added to RhREC culture medium led to a dose-dependent increase in apoptosis. Antibodies (Ab) directed against BIGH3 and TGF\u03b2, as well as TGF\u03b2 receptor blocker resulted in a significant reduction in apoptosis induced by either dMCM, TGF\u03b2 or BIGH3. IHC showed that cultured RhREC constitutively expressed BIGH3. Macrophage and BIGH3 protein were co-localized to the inner retina of the diabetic mouse eye. Our results support a novel inflammatory pathway for diabetic retinopathy. This pathway is initiated by TGF\u03b2 released from macrophages, which promotes synthesis and release of BIGH3 protein by REC and REC apoptosis.",

Autonomic imbalance, characterized by suppressed vagal (parasympathetic) activity and increased sympathetic activity, correlates with various pathological conditions, including heart failure, arrhythmia, ischaemia/reperfusion injury and hypertension. Conventionally, pharmacological interventions, such as \u03b2-blocker treatment, have primarily targeted suppressing sympathetic over-activation, while vagal modulation has always been neglected. Emerging evidence has documented the improvement of cardiac and vascular function mediated by the vagal nerve. Many investigators have tried to explore the effective ways to enhance vagal tone and normalize the autonomic nervous system. In this review, we attempt to give an overview of these therapeutic strategies, including direct vagal activation (electrical vagal stimulation, ACh administration and ACh receptor activation), pharmacological modulation (adenosine, cholinesterase inhibitors, statins) and exercise training. This overview provides valuable information for combination therapy, contributing to establishment of a comprehensive system on vagal modulation from the aspects of clinical application and lifestyle improvement. In addition, the mechanisms contributing to the benefits of enhancing vagal tone are diverse and have not yet been fully defined. We endeavour to outline the recent findings that advance our knowledge regarding the many favourable effects exerted by vagal activation: anti-inflammatory pathways, modulation of NOS and NO signalling, regulation of redox state, improvement of mitochondrial biogenesis and function, and potential calcium regulation. This review may help to develop novel therapeutic strategies targeting enhancing vagal activity for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.",

In the present study, the mutual modulation and underlying mechanism between norepinephrine and NO were explored in haemocytes of the scallop Chlamys farreri. After lipopolysaccharide stimulation, NO production increased to a significant level at 24\u2005h, and norepinephrine concentration rose to remarkable levels at 3\u2005h and 12~48\u2005h. A significant decrease of NO production was observed in the haemocytes concomitantly stimulated with lipopolysaccharide and \u03b1-adrenoceptor agonist, while a dramatic increase of NO production was observed in the haemocytes incubated with lipopolysaccharide and \u03b2-adrenoceptor agonist. Meanwhile, the concentration of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) decreased significantly in the haemocytes treated by lipopolysaccharide and \u03b1/\u03b2-adrenoceptor agonist, while the content of Ca(2+) was elevated in those triggered by lipopolysaccharide and \u03b2-adrenoceptor agonist. When the haemocytes was incubated with NO donor, norepinephrine concentration was significantly enhanced during 1~24\u2005h. Collectively, these results suggested that norepinephrine exerted varied effects on NO production at different immune stages via a novel \u03b1/\u03b2-adrenoceptor-cAMP/Ca(2+) regulatory pattern, and NO might have a feedback effect on the synthesis of norepinephrine in the scallop haemocytes.",

    "131": "Cardiac disorders are the main cause of mortality in autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). However, how mutated polycystins predispose patients with ADPKD to cardiac pathologies before development of renal dysfunction is unknown. We investigate the effect of decreased levels of polycystin 2 (PC2), a calcium channel that interacts with the ryanodine receptor, on myocardial function. We hypothesize that heterozygous PC2 mice (Pkd2(+/-)) undergo cardiac remodeling as a result of changes in calcium handling, separate from renal complications. We found that Pkd2(+/-) cardiomyocytes have altered calcium handling, independent of desensitized calcium-contraction coupling. Paradoxically, in Pkd2(+/-) mice, protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation of phospholamban (PLB) was decreased, whereas PKA phosphorylation of troponin I was increased, explaining the decoupling between calcium signaling and contractility. In silico modeling supported this relationship. Echocardiography measurements showed that Pkd2(+/-) mice have increased left ventricular ejection fraction after stimulation with isoproterenol (ISO), a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2AR) agonist. Blockers of \u03b2AR-1 and \u03b2AR-2 inhibited the ISO response in Pkd2(+/-) mice, suggesting that the dephosphorylated state of PLB is primarily by \u03b2AR-2 signaling. Importantly, the Pkd2(+/-) mice were normotensive and had no evidence of renal cysts. Our results showed that decreased PC2 levels shifted the \u03b2AR pathway balance and changed expression of calcium handling proteins, which resulted in altered cardiac contractility. We propose that PC2 levels in the heart may directly contribute to cardiac remodeling in patients with ADPKD in the absence of renal dysfunction.",

The \u03b2-AR GRK/\u03b2-arrestin biased agonist carvedilol can induce \u03b2-AR-mediated transactivation of the EGFR. The initial purpose of this study was to determine whether carvedilol, through activation of EGFR, can promote cancer. Carvedilol failed to promote anchorage-independent growth of JB6 P(+) cells, a skin cell model used to study tumor promotion. However, at nontoxic concentrations, carvedilol dose dependently inhibited EGF-induced malignant transformation of JB6 P(+) cells, suggesting that carvedilol has chemopreventive activity against skin cancer. Such effect was not observed for the \u03b2-AR agonist isoproterenol and the \u03b2-AR antagonist atenolol. Gene expression, receptor binding, and functional studies indicate that JB6 P(+) cells only express \u03b22-ARs. Carvedilol, but not atenolol, inhibited EGF-mediated activator protein-1 (AP-1) activation. A topical 7,12-dimethylbenz(\u03b1)anthracene (DMBA)-induced skin hyperplasia model in SENCAR mice was utilized to determine the in vivo cancer preventative activity of carvedilol. Both topical and oral carvedilol treatment inhibited DMBA-induced epidermal hyperplasia (P < 0.05) and reduced H-ras mutations; topical treatment being the most potent. However, in models of established cancer, carvedilol had modest to no inhibitory effect on tumor growth of human lung cancer A549 cells in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, these results suggest that the cardiovascular drug carvedilol may be repurposed for skin cancer chemoprevention, but may not be an effective treatment of established tumors. More broadly, this study suggests that \u03b2-ARs may serve as a novel target for cancer prevention.",

Apart from its temporal impact through prolonging the cellular response, we wondered whether the endosome-initiated signal encodes any discrete spatial information. Using the \u03b22-adrenoceptor (\u03b22-AR) as a model, we show that endocytosis is required for the full repertoire of downstream cAMP-dependent transcriptional control. Next, we describe an orthogonal optogenetic approach to definitively establish that the location of cAMP production is indeed the critical variable determining the transcriptional response. Finally, our results suggest that this spatial encoding scheme helps cells functionally discriminate chemically distinct \u03b22-AR ligands according to differences in their ability to promote receptor endocytosis. These findings reveal a discrete principle for achieving cellular signaling specificity based on endosome-mediated spatial encoding of intracellular second messenger production and 'location-aware' downstream transcriptional control.",

Two 15 min segments, during baseline and metoprolol administration, starting at 2 pm were analysed in this study. Atrial fibrillatory rate (AFR), heart rate (HR), and AV nodal parameters were assessed. The AV nodal parameters account for the probability of an impulse not taking the fast pathway, the absolute refractory periods of the slow and fast pathways (aRPs and aRPf), representing the functional refractory period, and their respective prolongation in refractory period. In addition, simulated RR series were generated that mimic metoprolol administration through prolonged AV conduction interval and AV node effective refractory period. During metoprolol administration, AFR and HR were significantly decreased and aRP was significantly prolonged in both pathways (aRPs: 337 \u00b1 60 vs. 398 \u00b1 79 ms, P < 0.01; aRPf: 430 \u00b1 91 vs. 517 \u00b1 100 ms, P < 0.01).

This characteristic may influence the effectiveness of the \u03b2-blockers among patients receiving long-term hemodialysis. To determine whether new use of a high-dialyzability \u03b2-blocker compared with a low-dialyzability \u03b2-blocker associates with a higher rate of mortality in patients older than age 66 years receiving long-term hemodialysis, we conducted a propensity-matched population-based retrospective cohort study using the linked healthcare databases of Ontario, Canada. The high-dialyzability group (n=3294) included patients initiating atenolol, acebutolol, or metoprolol. The low-dialyzability group (n=3294) included patients initiating bisoprolol or propranolol. Initiation of a high- versus low-dialyzability \u03b2-blocker was associated with a higher risk of death in the following 180 days (relative risk, 1.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 1.8; P<0.01). Supporting this finding, we repeated the primary analysis in a cohort of patients not receiving hemodialysis and found no significant association between dialyzability and the risk of death (relative risk, 1.0; 95% confidence interval, 0.9 to 1.3; P=0.71). \u03b2-Blocker exposure was not randomly allocated in this study, so a causal relationship between dialyzability and mortality cannot be determined.

    "158": "Alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD), a potentially pathologic condition, can progress to steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis, leading to an increased probability of hepatic failure and death. Alcohol induces fatty liver by increasing the ratio of reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide to oxidized form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide in hepatocytes; increasing hepatic sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1, and early growth response-1 activity; and decreasing hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b1 activity. Alcohol activates the innate immune system and induces an imbalance of the immune response, which is followed by activated Kupffer cell-derived tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 overproduction, which is in turn responsible for the changes in the hepatic SREBP-1 and PAI-1 activity. Alcohol abuse promotes the migration of bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) to the liver and then reprograms TNF-\u03b1 expression from BMDCs. Chronic alcohol intake triggers the sympathetic hyperactivity-activated hepatic stellate cell (HSC) feedback loop that in turn activates the HSCs, resulting in HSC-derived TNF-\u03b1 overproduction. Carvedilol may block this feedback loop by suppressing sympathetic activity, which attenuates the progression of AFLD. Clinical studies evaluating combination therapy of carvedilol with a TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor to treat patients with AFLD are warranted to prevent the development of alcoholic liver disease.",

Discovery of systemic and topical beta blockers as an effective treatment option resulted in a rapid shift away from systemic steroids towards these drugs. For preterm infants, however, data on efficacy, pharmacokinetics and long-term safety are sparse or absent. Topical treatment without systemic side effects like cryotherapy may thus be an attractive alternative at an early growth stage (<10\u2005mm). Indications for treatment with beta blockers, mostly propranolol systemically and timolol maleat 0.5% topically, are currently extrapolated from studies in older infants. Both seem effective, but adverse effects on sleep, circulation and metabolism are well described for propranolol. Long-term outcome data for either drug are missing. In conclusion, evidence on optimal IH treatment in preterms is lacking despite their high incidence; pharmacokinetic and clinical studies are warranted.",

This study aimed to examine whether changes in myocardial collagen metabolism account for LV functional recovery following beta-blocker therapy in 62 CHF patients with reduced ejection fraction (EF). LV function was echocardiographically measured at baseline and 1, 6, and 12 months after bisoprolol therapy along with serum markers of collagen metabolism including C-terminal telopeptide of collagen type I (CITP) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2. Deceleration time of mitral early velocity (DcT) increased even in the early phase, but LVEF gradually improved throughout the study period. Heart rate (HR) was reduced from the early stage, and CITP gradually decreased. LVEF and DcT increased more so in patients with the larger decreases in CITP (r = -0.33, p < 0.05; r = -0.28, p < 0.05, respectively), and HR (r = -0.31, p < 0.05; r = -0.38, p < 0.05, respectively). In addition, there were greater decreases in CITP, MMP-2 and HR from baseline to 1, 6, or 12 months in patients with above-average improvement in LVEF than in those with below-average improvement in LVEF. Similar results were obtained in terms of DcT. There was no significant correlation between the changes in HR and CITP. In conclusion, improvement in LV systolic/diastolic function was greatest in patients with the larger inhibition of collagen degradation. Changes in myocardial collagen metabolism are closely related to LV functional recovery somewhat independently from HR reduction.", 
    "177": "In sleep apnea syndrome (SAS), intermittent hypoxia (IH) induces repeated episodes of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) during sleep, which presumably contribute to pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). However, the prevalence of PAH was low and severity is mostly mild in SAS patients, and mild or no right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) was reported in IH-exposed animals. The question then arises as to why PAH is not a universal finding in SAS if repeated hypoxia of sufficient duration causes cycling HPV. In the present study, rats underwent IH at a rate of 3 min cycles of 4-21% O2 for 8 h/d for 6 w. Assessment of diameter changes in small pulmonary arteries in response to acute hypoxia and drugs were performed using synchrotron radiation microangiography on anesthetized rats. In IH-rats, neither PAH nor RVH was observed and HPV was strongly reversed. Nadolol (a hydrophilic \u03b2(1, 2)-blocker) augmented the attenuated HPV to almost the same level as that in N-rats, but atenolol (a hydrophilic \u03b21-blocker) had no effect on the HPV in IH. These \u03b2-blockers had almost no effect on the HPV in N-rats. Chronic administration of nadolol during 6 weeks of IH exposure induced PAH and RVH in IH-rats, but did not in N-rats. Meanwhile, atenolol had no effect on morphometric and hemodynamic changes in N and IH-rats. Protein expression of the \u03b21-adrenergic receptor (AR) was down-regulated while that of \u03b22AR was preserved in pulmonary arteries of IH-rats. Phosphorylation of p85 (chief component of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)), protein kinase B (Akt), and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) were abrogated by chronic administration of nadolol in the lung tissue of IH-rats. We conclude that IH-derived activation of \u03b22AR in the pulmonary arteries attenuates the HPV, thereby preventing progression of IH-induced PAH. This protective effect may depend on the \u03b22AR-Gi mediated PI3K/Akt/eNOS signaling pathway.",

We further found that downregulation of Rnd3 attenuated \u03b22-adrenergic receptor lysosomal targeting and ubiquitination, which in turn resulted in the elevation of \u03b22-adrenergic receptor protein levels leading to the hyperactivation of protein kinase A (PKA) signaling. The PKA activation destabilized ryanodine receptor type 2 channels. This irregular spontaneous Ca(2+) release can be curtailed by PKA inhibitor treatment. Increases in the PKA activity along with elevated cAMP levels were detected in Rnd3-null embryos, in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, and noncardiac cell lines with Rnd3 knockdown, suggesting a general mechanism for Rnd3-mediated PKA signaling activation. \u03b22-Adrenergic receptor blocker treatment reduced arrhythmia and improved cardiac function.",

    "199": "Acute bronchiolitis is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection and hospitalization in children less than 1 year of age worldwide. It is usually a mild disease, but some children may develop severe symptoms, requiring hospital admission and ventilatory support in the ICU. Infants with pre-existing risk factors (prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, congenital heart diseases and immunodeficiency) may be predisposed to a severe form of the disease. Clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis is manly based on medical history and physical examination (rhinorrhea, cough, crackles, wheezing and signs of respiratory distress). Etiological diagnosis, with antigen or genome detection to identify viruses involved, may have a role in reducing hospital transmission of the infection. Criteria for hospitalization include low oxygen saturation (<90-92%), moderate-to-severe respiratory distress, dehydration and presence of apnea. Children with pre-existing risk factors should be carefully assessed.To date, there is no specific treatment for viral bronchiolitis, and the mainstay of therapy is supportive care. This consists of nasal suctioning and nebulized 3% hypertonic saline, assisted feeding and hydration, humidified O2 delivery. The possible role of any pharmacological approach is still debated, and till now there is no evidence to support the use of bronchodilators, corticosteroids, chest physiotherapy, antibiotics or antivirals. Nebulized adrenaline may be sometimes useful in the emergency room. Nebulized adrenaline can be useful in the hospital setting for treatment as needed. Lacking a specific etiological treatment, prophylaxis and prevention, especially in children at high risk of severe infection, have a fundamental role. Environmental preventive measures minimize viral transmission in hospital, in the outpatient setting and at home. Pharmacological prophylaxis with palivizumab for RSV bronchiolitis is indicated in specific categories of children at risk during the epidemic period. Viral bronchiolitis, especially in the case of severe form, may correlate with an increased incidence of recurrent wheezing in pre-schooled children and with asthma at school age.The aim of this document is to provide a multidisciplinary update on the current recommendations for the management and prevention of bronchiolitis, in order to share useful indications, identify gaps in knowledge and drive future research.",

The constitutive activation induced by mutation of key GPCR residues is associated closely with various diseases. However, the structural basis underlying such activation and its role in drug binding has remained unclear. Herein, we used all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations to study the effects of a D130N mutation on the structure of \u03b22 adrenergic receptor (\u03b22AR) and its binding of the agonist salbutamol. The results indicate that the mutation caused significant changes in some key helices. In particular, the mutation leads to the departure of transmembrane 3 (TM3) from transmembrane 6 (TM6) and marked changes in the NPxxY region as well as the complete disruption of a key ionic lock, all of which contribute to the observed constitutive activation. In addition, the D130N mutation weakens some important H-bonds, leading to structural changes in these regions. Binding free energy calculations indicate that van der Waals and electrostatic interactions are the main driving forces in binding salbutamol; however, binding strength in the mutant \u03b22AR is significantly enhanced mainly through modifying electrostatic interactions. Further analysis revealed that the increase in binding energy upon mutation stems mainly from the H-bonds formed between the hydroxyl group of salbutamol and the serine residues of TM5. This observation suggests that modifications of the H-bond groups of this drug could significantly influence drug efficacy in the treatment of diseases associated with this mutation.",

    "204": "Prospective study of 102 consecutive primary care patients with suspected new onset CHF referred to an easily accessible hospital-based cardiology outpatient clinic management programme. Following clinical examination, ECG, echocardiography, blood chemistry including NT-proBNP, and assessment of NYHA class and quality of life (EQ5D), patients with a confirmed diagnosis of CHF were prescribed medication with advice on titration and target doses. Trained CHF nurses gave Information on CHF and provided follow up.", 
    "205": "Half (47%) of the referred patients had the diagnosis of CHF confirmed. Low NT-proBNP values (< 300 ng/l) provided a negative predictive value of 73%. Respiratory tract diseases were common differential diagnoses. At one year of follow-up, medication in the CHF group was 86% ACE-inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, 61% \u00df-blocking agents, and 81% diuretics (P < 0.001 for the increase in ACE-inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers from baseline). NYHA class improved from baseline (median 2, range: 1-3) to one year (P < 0.05), whereas NT-proBNP (1491-1261 ng/l), and quality of life (EQ5D; 67-67) were unchanged.",

    "207": "Recent findings indicate cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk is best predicted by asleep systolic blood pressure (SBP), and lowering it by scheduling \u22651 conventional long-acting hypertension medications, alone or in combination, at bedtime significantly lessens vascular-associated risks. Some 20 years ago, four controlled-onset extended-release drug-delivery systems incorporating a calcium channel or \u03b2-blocker, with the treatment goal specifically being attenuation of morning rather than asleep BP, were conceived as one type of bedtime hypertension chronotherapy. However, the CONVINCE outcomes trial failed to substantiate the merit of targeting morning and daytime BP to decrease CVD risk. The HOPE trial, entailing bedtime ramipril treatment for high CVD risk patients, showed substantial reduction of vascular-related events, theorized as the beneficial treatment-time-dependent strong asleep BP lowering. The MAPEC trial was the first prospective randomized treatment-time outcomes investigation to test the worthiness of bedtime hypertension chronotherapy entailing \u22651 conventional long-acting medications (BTCT), in comparison to the conventional morning-time therapeutic scheme for all medications (CMTT), to normalize asleep BP and diminish CVD risk. BTCT compared to CMTT significantly better lowered asleep BP and most importantly major CVD-associated morbidity and mortality, including myocardial infarction and ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, by ~60%. CVD risk reduction was strongest when the BTCT included an angiotensin receptor blocker. The HOPE and MAPEC trials provide positive evidence of very significant CVD risk reduction by a BTCT strategy that specifically targets normalization of asleep BP, evidence that awaits conformation by the ongoing Hygia and other outcomes trials.", 
    "208": "Atrial fibrillation is a supraventricular tachyarrhythmia very common in medical practice, often associated with heart failure. Pathophysiological relationship between atrial fibrillation and heart failure is in the attention of numerous case studies, being incomplete elucidated.", 
    "209": "We made a retrospective study on patients with both diseases, hospitalized in Cardiovascular Rehabilitation Hospital, Iasi, during 01.01.2013 - 31.12.2013. The obtained data allowed the classification of patients according to gender distribution, age groups, area of origin, clinical aspects, and association with other diseases, instituted treatment and appreciation of CHADS2 score. Data interpretation was performed with appropriate statistical methods.", 
    "210": "We found a higher frequency of the disease among male patients, male: female ratio being 2:1; the most of the patients lived in urban area. The pick of diseases incidence was in patients over 65 years with a total percentage of 70.84% of cases. We noted that the most common symptoms were exertional dyspnea (in all patients), palpitations, dizziness, headache, fatigue, asthenia, dyspnea at rest and pain/chest pressure. In our study, the majority of patients received the beta-blocker--digoxin combination (46 patients, 40 patients respectively).", 
    "211": "The coexistence of the two disorders could be explained by identifying common risk factors. Beta blockers should be the first therapeutic option in patients with chronic heart failure and atrial fibrillation because they have the effect of controlling heart rate and improve survival in patients with these disorders. Meanwhile, digoxin is a drug, only certain conditions of high accuracy monitoring; whose major clinical indications are heart failure and atrial rhythm disturbances.", 
    "212": "The excessive release of glutamate is a critical element in the neuropathology of acute and chronic brain disorders. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect and possible mechanism of myricetin, a naturally occurring flavonoid with a neuroprotective profile, on endogenous glutamate release in the nerve terminals (synaptosomes) of the rat cerebral cortex. The release of glutamate was evoked by the K(+) channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) and measured by one-line enzyme-coupled fluorometric assay. We also used a membrane potential-sensitive dye to assay the synaptosomal plasma membrane potential, and a Ca(2+) indicator Fura-2 to monitor cytosolic Ca(2+) concentrations ([Ca(2+)]C). Results show that myricetin inhibited 4-AP-evoked glutamate release, and this effect was prevented by chelating extracellular Ca(2+) ions and the vesicular transporter inhibitor bafilomycin A1. However, the glutamate transporter inhibitor dl-threo-beta-benzyl-oxyaspartate had no effect on myricetin action. Myricetin did not alter the synaptosomal membrane potential, but decreased 4-AP-induced increases in the cytosolic free Ca(2+) concentration. Furthermore, the myricetin effect on 4-AP-evoked glutamate release was prevented by blocking the Cav2.2 (N-type) and Cav2.1 (P/Q-type) channels, but not by blocking intracellular Ca(2+) release. These results suggest that myricetin inhibits glutamate release from cerebrocortical synaptosomes by attenuating voltage-dependent Ca(2+) entry. This implies that the inhibition of glutamate release is an important pharmacological activity of myricetin that may play a critical role in the apparent clinical efficacy of this compound.", 
    "213": "Some patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) develop cardiogenic shock due to left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction - there is, however, a paucity of data regarding this condition.", 
    "214": "Prevalence, associated factors and management implications of LVOT obstruction in TTC was explored, based on two-year data from two Belgian heart centres.", 
    "215": "A total of 32 patients with TTC were identified out of 3,272 patients presenting with troponin-positive acute coronary syndrome. In six patients diagnosed with TTC (19%), a significant LVOT obstruction was detected by transthoracic echocardiography. Patients with LVOT obstruction were older and had more often septal bulging, and presented more frequently in cardiogenic shock as compared to those without LVOT obstruction (P < 0.05). Moreover, all patients with LVOT obstruction showed systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the anterior mitral valve leaflet, which was associated with a higher grade of mitral regurgitation (2.2\u00b10.7 vs. 1.0\u00b10.6, P<0.001). Adequate therapeutic management including fluid resuscitation, cessation of inotropic therapy, intravenous \u03b2-blocker, and the use of intra-aortic balloon pump resulted in non-inferior survival in TTC patients with LVOT obstruction as compared to those without LVOT obstruction.", 
    "216": "TTC is complicated by LVOT obstruction in approximately 20% of cases. Older age, septal bulging, SAM-induced mitral regurgitation and hemodynamic instability are associated with this condition. Timely and accurate diagnosis of LVOT obstruction by echocardiography is key to successful management of these TTC patients with LVOT obstruction and results in a non-inferior outcome as compared to those patients without LVOT obstruction.",

    "221": "Review authors carried out data extraction and quality assessment of the included trials independently and in duplicate. We discussed discrepancies until we reached consensus. We consulted a third review author in cases of persistent disagreement. We contacted authors of primary studies when necessary.", 
    "222": "We identified 18 potentially relevant RCTs, but only seven met the inclusion criteria. All studies had a small number of participants, ranging from seven to 16 people per study and had a cross-over design. Three studies were of low risk of bias, while four were of uncertain risk. Amitriptyline (three studies), bromocriptine (one study), clonidine (one study), propranolol (one study), levodopa (Prolopa\u00ae) (one study) and tryptophan (one study) were compared with placebo. Studies evaluating bromocriptine, clonidine, propranolol and levodopa reported our primary outcome of indices of bruxism motor activity.Results were imprecise and consistent with benefit, no difference or harm. These were the specific findings for each of the drugs according to specific outcomes: 1. Amitriptyline versus placebo for masseteric electromyography (EMG) activity per minute: standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.28 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.91 to 0.34; P value = 0.37), 2. bromocriptine versus placebo for bruxism episodes per hour: mean difference (MD) 0.60 (95% CI -2.93 to 4.13), bruxism bursts per hour: MD -2.00 (95% CI -53.47 to 49.47), bruxism bursts per episode: MD 0.50 (95% CI -1.85 to 2.85) or number of episodes with grinding noise: MD 2.40 (95% CI -24.00 to 28.80), 3. clonidine versus placebo for number of bruxism episodes per hour: MD -2.41 (95% CI -4.84 to 0.02), 4. propranolol versus placebo for the number of bruxism episodes per hour: MD 1.16 (95% CI -1.89 to 4.21), 5. L-tryptophan versus placebo for masseteric EMG activity per second: SMD 0.08 (95% CI -0.90 to 1.06) and 6. levodopa versus placebo for bruxism episodes per hour of sleep: MD -1.47 (95% CI -3.64 to 0.70), for bruxism bursts per episode: MD 0.06 (95% CI -2.47 to 2.59).We combined several secondary outcomes (sleep duration, masseteric EMG activity per minute and pain intensity) in a meta-analysis for comparison of amitriptyline with placebo. The results for most comparisons were uncertain because of statistical imprecision. One study reported that clonidine reduced rapid eye movement (REM) sleep stage and increased the second stage of sleep. However, results for other sleep-related outcomes with clonidine were uncertain. Adverse effects were frequent in people who took amitriptyline (5/10 had drowsiness, difficulty awakening in the morning, insomnia or xerostomia compared with 0/10 in the placebo group), as well as in people who received propranolol (7/16 had moderate-to-severe xerostomia compare with 2/16 in the placebo group). Clonidine was associated with prolonged morning hypotension in three of 16 participants. The use of preventive medication avoided any adverse effects in people treated with levodopa and bromocriptine.", 
    "223": "There was insufficient evidence on the effectiveness of pharmacotherapy for the treatment of sleep bruxism. This systematic review points to the need for more, well-designed, RCTs with larger sample sizes and adequate methods of allocation, outcome assessment and duration of follow-up. Ideally, parallel RCTs should be used in future studies to avoid the bias associated with cross-over studies. There is a need to standardize the outcomes of RCTs on treatments for sleep bruxism.", 
    "224": "Erectile dysfunction (ED) has been found to frequently precedes the onset of coronary artery disease (CAD), representing an early marker of subclinical vascular disease, included CAD. Its recognition is, therefore, a \"window opportunity\" to prevent a coronary event by aggressive treatment of cardiovascular risk factors. The artery size hypothesis (ASH) has been proposed as a putative mechanism to explain the relationship between ED and CAD. Since atherosclerosis is a systemic disorder all major vascular beds should be affected to the same extent. However, symptoms at different points in the system rarely become evident at the same time. This is likely the result of smaller vessels (i.e. the penile artery) being able to less well tolerate the same amount of plaque when compared with larger ones (i.e. the coronary artery). If true, ED will develop before CAD. We present a case in which ED developed after a coronary event yet before a coronary recurrence potentially representing a late marker of vascular progression. Reasons for this unusual sequence are discussed as they might still fit the ASH.", 
    "225": "Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)-based medicines have recently been widely used to treat type 2 diabetic patients, whereas adverse effects of nausea and vomiting have been documented. Inhibition of voltage-gated K(+) channel subtype Kv2.1 in pancreatic \u03b2-cells has been suggested to contribute to mild depolarization and promotion of insulin release. This study aimed to determine whether the blockade of Kv2.1 channels potentiates the insulinotropic effect of GLP-1 agonists. Kv2.1 channel blocker guangxitoxin-1E (GxTx) and GLP-1 agonist exendin-4 at subthreshold concentrations, when combined, markedly increased the insulin release and cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) in a glucose-dependent manner in mouse islets and \u03b2-cells. Exendin-4 at subthreshold concentration alone increased islet insulin release and \u03b2-cell [Ca(2+)]i in Kv2.1(+/-) mice. The [Ca(2+)]i response to subthreshold exendin-4 and GxTx in combination was attenuated by pretreatment with protein kinase A inhibitor H-89, indicating the protein kinase A dependency of the cooperative effect. Furthermore, subthreshold doses of GxTx and GLP-1 agonist liraglutide in combination markedly increased plasma insulin and improved glucose tolerance in diabetic db/db mice and NSY mice. These results demonstrate that a modest suppression of Kv2.1 channels dramatically raises insulinotropic potency of GLP-1-based drugs, which opens a new avenue to reduce their doses and associated adverse effects while achieving the same glycemic control in type 2 diabetes.", 
    "226": "A 46-year-old African-American man with a history of hypertension, end-stage kidney disease (on haemodialysis) and previous cocaine misuse presented to the emergency room with a sudden onset of severe headache and diaphoresis without other neurological or cardiovascular signs/symptoms. He checked his blood pressure at home and found it to be 230/130. It did not improve despite taking two serial doses of oral clonidine 0.3 mg. Evaluation with head CT and lumbar puncture demonstrated no acute intracranial process, such as subarachnoid haemorrhage. These symptoms started after he took Libido-Max, an over-the-counter supplement for erectile dysfunction. This supplement includes yohimbine, an \u03b1-2 antagonist, which counteracts the effects of oral clonidine, one of his routine antihypertensive medications. This led to rebound hypertension and made his hypertensive urgency resistant to oral clonidine. He was successfully treated with intravenous labetalol and his symptoms quickly resolved after lowering of his blood pressure.",

    "229": "In 6 of 9 patients (median age: 31, all males) referred in the study period, some potential for recovery of left ventricular (LV) function was seen (P < 0.002), with a maximal improvement in LV ejection fraction reached within 6 months of treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers. The remaining 3 patients required implantation of a LV assist device (LVAD) and were listed for heart transplantation. No recovery of LV function in the patients treated with assist device was seen.", 
    "230": "Anabolic-androgenic steroid-induced advanced heart failure is generally not a reversible condition. If diagnosed in the early stages some recovery of ventricular function is possible, but the long-term prognosis is uncertain. Likely, a substantial proportion of patients will eventually require LVADs or cardiac transplantation.", 
    "231": "There is still a group of patient that have unpredictable risk for the development of contrast nephropathy (CN). There is also an effort to find more effficient strategies to prevent CN. Carvedilol, metoprolol and nebivolol seem to have theoretical potentials for the prevention of CN. In this study, we aimed to investigate their effects on the prevention of CN. We also aimed to define the risk factors associated with the development of CN in our study group.",

We made analysis to determine the agents' efficiency on the prevention of CN. We also performed multiple logistic regression analysis including all groups to define the risk factors associated with CN.", 
    "233": "The incidents of CN were the lowest in the carvedilol group (4%) while the worst performance occurred in those taking metoprolol (10%). The difference between the groups in terms of the development of CN did not reach statistical significance (p>0.05). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed age (p=0.003), higher triglyceride levels (p=0.011) and family history of coronary artery disease (p=0.038) to be the predictors of CN.", 
    "234": "In this study, we didn't find any relation between the development of CN and carvedilol, metoprolol or nebivolol usage. We found age, higher levels of triglyceride and family history of coronary artery disease to be risk factors for predicting CN.", 
    "235": "In spite of the self-limiting natural course of infantile haemangiomas of the eyelids and orbit, the effects of amblyopia, compression of the optic nerve, and impairment of the aesthetic appearance may develop. Since the serendipitous discovery of the effects of propranolol, a non-selective beta-blocker, on infantile haemangioma in 2008, it has largely replaced the former standard treatments with corticosteroids, laser or surgical procedures. This review discusses the pathogenesis, classification, indication for treatment, and treatment options for infantile haemangiomas. In addition, the results of patients with infantile haemangiomas of the eyelids and orbit treated with systemic propranolol are shown. With additional confirmation of data, including a positive effect-risk-analysis, propranolol will potentially replace high-dose corticosteroids and surgery in the treatment of infantile haemangiomas in the eyelids and orbit. Further clinical studies are necessary to optimise the dosage, treatment period, and application modalities (oral or topical). In the future, propranolol accompanied with paediatric-cardiological monitoring should emerge as the first-line therapy for problematic infantile haemangiomas."
