    "0": "The stereospecificity of the beta-adrenergic receptor of turkey erythrocyte ghosts was studied. Binding of the specific beta-adrenergic antagonist, propranolol, was found to occur exclusively with the l-stereoisomer. The stereospecificity of catecholamine binding was determined by assaying the ability of the catecholamines to displace [(3)H]propranolol. Binding of the catecholamines was also found to be stereospecific for the l-stereoisomers. Furthermore, the d-stereoisomers do not compete with the l form for binding. Using this displacement technique, we were able to calculate the dissociation constants for l-epinephrine, l-norepinephrine, and l-isoproterenol from the beta-receptor and compare these values to the apparent dissociation constants obtained from the direct activation of adenylate cyclase (EC 4.6.1.1) by these catecholamines.", 
    "1": "1. Four dogs were trained to immerse their snout voluntarily for durations up to 30 sec. Indwelling instrumentation was implanted to measure blood flow velocity in the circumflex branch of the left coronary artery, to sample blood from the left atrium and coronary sinus for the determination of P(O2), P(CO2), pH, oxygen saturation and haemoglobin concentration, and to pace the heart. An index of myocardial oxygen consumption was calculated by multiplying the mean flow velocity by the arteriovenous difference in oxygen content.2. Mean coronary flow velocity decreased significantly during simulated diving by 26 +/- 27% (+/- S.D.). The range of decrease in seventeen out of twenty experiments was from -5 to -81%. Heart rate decreased by 48 +/- 7% and this bradycardia was abolished by I.V. atropine.3. Coronary sinus oxygen saturation increased significantly with snout immersion (three dogs) and arteriovenous difference decreased from 67 +/- 10 to 47 +/- 5%. The index of myocardial oxygen consumption decreased by 42 +/- 19%. This decrease was attenuated slightly by beta-blockade but was abolished by cardiac pacing in three out of four experiments.4. The present study indicates that the heart consumes oxygen at a considerably reduced rate during simulated diving and therefore plays a direct role in the overall conservation of oxygen. This response appears to result primarily from a negative chronotropic effect induced by increased vagal tone.", 
    "2": "1. Internal microinjection of the Ca-sensitive photoprotein aequorin or the isotope (45)Ca have been used to assess Ca movements in single muscle fibres from the barnacle Balanus nubilus and the crab Maia squinado.2. Progressive isosomotic replacement of external Na by Li, choline, sucrose or Tris was associated with a rapid increase in the level of light emission from internally injected aequorin. This response was dependent upon the presence of external Ca. The light output was maximal for Na concentrations < 50 mM in the replaced salines, while Na concentrations > 350 mM produced no apparent increase in the resting light emission.3. If the Ca concentration in the external saline was altered, no effect was observed in Na replaced salines when the Ca concentration was < 1 mM, but maximal effects were observed at concentrations of Ca of ca. 100 mM.4. The increased light emission from aequorin in Na-replaced salines was substantially inhibited by 1 mM-La(3+) applied externally, but not by N-ethyl maleimide (NEM), propanolol or D-600.5. Following microinjection of (45)Ca and 2 hr equilibration, the residual efflux of Ca was shown to be sensitive to the removal of external Ca and Na, the extent of each component being variable.6. The Na-sensitive Ca efflux was partially inhibited by external La(3+) (1 mM), but not by high concentrations of Mg(2+), Ca(2+), Mn(2+) or Co(2+). It was stimulated by NEM and ethacrynic acid, which was considered to be due to an indirect effect upon the sarcoplasmic reticulum.7. It is concluded that Ca movements in these single crustacean muscle fibres involve Na gradients and a Ca: Ca exchange and from the relative insensitivity of Ca movements to various inhibitors, in contrast to the Mg system, it seems that there may be two independent modes for divalent cation transport in this preparation.", 
    "3": "Hypermetabolism characterizes the metabolic response to thermal injury and the extent of energy production is positively related to the rate of urinary catecholamine excretion. Alpha and beta adrenergic blockade decreased metabolism from 69.6 +/- 5.3 Kcal/m(2)/hr to 57.4 +/- 5.2 (p < 0.01), and infusion of 6 microgm epinephrine/minute in normal man significantly increased metabolic rate. Twenty noninfected burned adults with a mean burn size of 45% total body surface (range 7-84%) and four normal controls were studied in an environmental chamber at two or more temperatures between 19 and 33 C with vapor pressure constant at 11.88 mm Hg. All burn patients were hypermetabolic at all temperatures studied and their core and mean skin temperatures were significantly elevated above control values. Between 25 and 33 C ambient, metabolism was unchanged in controls and burns of less than 40% total body surface (48.9 +/- 4.6 Kcal/m(2)/hr vs. 48.9 +/- 4.5), but metabolic rate decreased in larger burns in the warmer environment (72.0 +/- 1.9 vs. 65.8 +/- 1.7, p < 0.001). At 21 C, metabolism and catecholamines increased, except in four nonsurvivors who became hypothermic with decreased catechol elaboration. Metabolic rate in ten patients with bacteremia was below predicted levels while catecholamines were markedly elevated suggesting interference with tissue uptake of the neurohormonal transmitters. Feeding burn patients or administering glucose and insulin improved nitrogen retention and altered substrate flow but did not significantly reduce urinary catecholamines or metabolic rate. Burned patients are internally warm, not externally cold, and catecholamines appear to mediate their increased heat production. Hypermetabolism may be modified by ambient temperature, infection, and pharmacologic means. Alterations in hypothalamic function due to injury, resulting in increased catecholamine elaboration, would explain the metabolic response to thermal injury.", 
    "4": "Left ventricular function was studied in 15 patients both before and after intravenous administration of Practolol (an agent blocking selectively the heart beta-adrenergic receptors (beta 1)), while the heart rate was constant by right atrial pacing. The negative inotropic effect linked to the negative chronotropic effect of the beta-adrenergic blockage, represented approximately one quarter of the overall depression of the contractility. Right atrial pacing determined a decrease of the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and an increase of the pacing rate by 20% above the spontaneous heart rate, after administration of 30 mg of Practolol, brought the contractility back to its control level.", 
    "5": "The efficiency and the variety of drugs used in the treatment of arterial hypertension demand that the various disorders responsible for the blood pressure increase be well individualized. The study of the haemodynamic and hormonal factors and of their interelations in the patients provides interesting informations which make it possible to classify the hypertensive subjects according to physiopathological criteria. Starting from these data, it is possible to consider a rational treatment by selecting the drugs acting specifically on the anomalies to be corrected.", 
    "6": "The comparative effectiveness of propranolol and ICI 66082, in inhibiting the release of renin from the kidney resulting from renal nerve stimulation, has been studied in the cat. Over the dose range 0.17-0.68 x 10(-5) mol/kg propranolol there was a dose-response relationship with the increase of plasma renin activity (PRA) achieved after 10 min stimulation. Over the dose range 0.75-1.69 x 10(-5) mol/kg ICI 66082 also inhibited the release of renin caused by nerve stimulation, but was about five times less effective than propranolol. It would appear from these data that the beta-adrenoceptors within the kidney mediating renin release are distinctly different from those of the heart.", 
    "7": "1 Four beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents, (+/-)- and (+)-propranolol, practolol and oxprenolol, were found to antagonize, apparently competitively, the responses of both the rat isolated stomach and uterus to 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT).2 The pA(2) values for each of these agents as antagonists of the contractile action of 5-HT on the rat stomach were found to be: (+/-)-propranolol, 6.08; (+)-propranolol, 4.94; practolol, 3.43; and oxprenolol, 5.99. These values were very similar to the corresponding figures for antagonism of 5-HT-induced contractions of the uterus.3 pA(2) values for antagonism of adrenaline-induced relaxations by the four blocking agents on the rat stomach and uterus did not differ from the values for 5-HT blockade.4 To antagonize contractile responses to acetylcholine of the rat stomach it was necessary to give 100 times more (+/-)-propranolol than was needed to antagonize responses to 5-HT.", 
    "8": "1 The effects of propranolol, oxprenolol and practolol on the isometric twitch responses to electrical stimulation of isolated diaphragm muscles from the rat and of isolated papillary muscles from the rabbit are described.2 Depression of the twitch responses of the diaphragm muscle was produced by propranolol (20 mug/ml), by oxprenolol (100 mug/ml) and by practolol (500 mug/ml).3 Depression of the twitch responses of the papillary muscles was produced by propranolol (20 mug/ml) by oxprenolol (100 mug/ml) and by practolol (200 mug/ml).4 No increase of twitch tension was produced by oxprenolol or practolol on either tissue.5 It is concluded that propranolol, oxprenolol and practolol produce negative inotropic actions on isolated cardiac muscle by a mechanism unrelated to blockade of beta-adrenoceptors and which occurs at doses which are well in excess of those doses required to produce beta-blockade.", 
    "9": "1 The effects of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor stimulants on the histamine-forming capacity (HFC) of human isolated leucocytes have been studied, in vitro.2 It was confirmed that antigen significantly stimulates the HFC of human leucocytes.3 beta-Adrenoceptor stimulants, such as isoprenaline and salbutamol (10(-6)-10(-3)M) significantly inhibited the HFC of human leucocytes in the presence and absence of antigen. At concentrations lower than 10(-6)M, this effect was not observed. In general the degree of inhibition of HFC by beta-adrenoceptor stimulants followed their potency as beta-adrenoceptor stimulants.4 alpha-Adrenoceptor stimulants significantly stimulated leucocyte HFC; noradrenaline within a limited concentration of 10(-6)M, while stimulation was seen consistently with phenylephrine at concentrations of 10(-7)-10(-4)M. Adrenaline, which stimulates both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors, produced small inhibition, no effect, or a degree of stimulation.5 Phentolamine, an alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agent, produced an effect opposite to that of the alpha-adrenoceptor stimulants, i.e. a significant inhibition of the HFC of human isolated leucocytes.", 
    "10": "Long-term regulation of the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase of the C-6 rat glioma cell line has been studied. Both the low K(m) and high K(m) activities can be induced by elevation of intracellular cyclic AMP levels following either dibutyryl cyclic AMP or norepinephrine treatment of the cells. The enzymes are maximally induced by 3-4 hr. The presence of either cycloheximide or actinomycin D prevents induction by either dibutyryl cyclic AMP or norepinephrine. Evidence is presented that the norepinephrine effect is mediated by the beta-catecholamine receptor. The increased phosphodiesterase activity causes a partial refractoriness to a second challenge with norepinephrine, which can be overcome by blockade of the induction with cycloheximide. The results suggest that just as short-term regulation of cyclic AMP levels occurs via changes in the rates of synthesis or degradation, long-term alterations of the system may also involve either the adenylate cyclase or the phosphodiesterase."
