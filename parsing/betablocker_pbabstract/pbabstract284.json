Racemic sotalol (40 mg kg(-1)) was administered to healthy, acutely (interferonalpha 2a-induced) and chronically (Mycobacterium butyricum-induced adjuvant arthritis) inflamed male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=4 - 6/group). Another group of interferon-treated rats received 3 mg kg(-1) of anti-TNF antibody infliximab. Electrocardiogram (ECG) recorded and plasma sotalol concentration monitored for 6 h. The study was repeated in acutely inflamed rats following administration of stereochemically pure individual sotalol enantiomers [40 mg kg(-1) S (potassium channel blocker) or 20 mg kg(-1) R (beta-adrenergic/potassium channel blocker)]. Chronic arthritis was readily evident. Acute arthritis was associated with elevated segmented neutrophils and increased plasma nitrite and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) concentrations. Sotalol affected ECG in all rats. In both inflamed groups, however, response to sotalol in prolongation of QT interval (potassium channel sensitivity) was reduced. The effect of PR interval (beta-adrenergic activity) was also reduced following administration of the racemate and R-enantiomer. No significant differences in pharmacokinetics were observed between control and inflamed rats. Infliximab reduced nitrite and TNF concentrations and reversed the effect of acute inflammation on both PR and QT intervals. The reduced electrocardiographic responses to sotalol is likely due to the influence of inflammation on the action of the drug on both beta-adrenergic and potassium channel receptors secondary to over-expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and/or nitric oxide. Our observation may have therapeutic consequences in all conditions where inflammatory mediators are increased.", 
    "1": "Because tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha can upregulate alveolar fluid clearance (AFC) in pneumonia or septic peritonitis, the mechanisms responsible for the TNF-alpha-mediated increase in epithelial fluid transport were studied. In rats, 5 microg of TNF-alpha in the alveolar instillate increased AFC by 67%. This increase was inhibited by amiloride but not by propranolol. We also tested a triple-mutant TNF-alpha that is deficient in the lectinlike tip portion of the molecule responsible for its membrane conductance effect; the mutant also has decreased binding affinity to both TNF-alpha receptors. The triple-mutant TNF-alpha did not increase AFC. Perfusion of human A549 cells, patched in the whole cell mode, with TNF-alpha (120 ng/ml) resulted in a sustained increase in Na(+) currents from 82 +/- 9 to 549 +/- 146 pA (P < 0.005; n = 6). The TNF-alpha-elicited Na(+) current was inhibited by amiloride, and there was no change when A549 cells were perfused with the triple-mutant TNF-alpha or after preincubation with blocking antibodies to the two TNF-alpha receptors before perfusion with TNF-alpha. In conclusion, although TNF- alpha can initiate acute inflammation and edema formation in the lung, TNF-alpha can also increase AFC by an amiloride-sensitive, cAMP-independent mechanism that enhances the resolution of alveolar edema in pathological conditions by either binding to its receptors or activating Na(+) channels by means of its lectinlike domain.", 
    "2": "1. In a previous study, we showed that the presynaptic inhibitory action of 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor agonists on sympathetic pressor effects obtained in the pithed rats were mainly mediated by activation of 5-HT1A and 5-HT1D receptor subtypes. At the time, we observed that some 5-HT1 receptors antagonists - WAY 100,635 and NAN-190 (both 5-HT1A receptor antagonists), methiothepin (a 5-HT1,2,5,6,7 receptor antagonist) and spiperone (a 5-HT1,2 receptor antagonist) - reduced per se the pressor effects obtained by electrical stimulation. The aim of the present work was to investigate the mechanism participating in this inhibitory effect. 2. The inhibition induced by WAY 100,635 (1000 microg kg-1, i.v.) was blocked after i.v. treatment with idazoxan, an alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist (300 and 1000 microg kg-1) and was not modified after i.v. treatment with propranolol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist (1000 microg kg-1) and sulpiride, a D2 receptor antagonist (1000 microg kg-1). The inhibition induced by spiperone (500 microg kg-1 i.v.) was significantly blocked by sulpiride (1000 microg kg-1) and was not modified by idazoxan or propranolol. 3. Sulpiride (1000 microg kg-1) partially blocked the inhibition induced by methiothepin (50 microg kg-1 i.v.). Only pretreatment with idazoxan (300 microg kg-1) modified the inhibition induced by NAN-190 (100 microg kg-1 i.v.), such inhibition increasing after intravenous administration of idazoxan. 4. All the antagonists used in our experiments failed to inhibit the pressor responses elicited by i.v. noradrenaline administration. 5. The above results suggest that the inhibitory effects of these 5-HT1 receptor antagonists are presynaptic in nature, but not related to the blockade of 5-HT1 receptors subtypes. The simultaneous activation or inhibition of other receptor systems could explain the inhibition produced by each 5-HT1 receptor antagonist studied.", 
    "3": "Bisoprolol, a beta1-selective beta-blocker, was administered to 13 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension once daily at doses of 5-10 mg for 24 weeks, and its long-term effects on blood pressure and glucose metabolism were investigated. The systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressures were significantly reduced. At the end of the treatment period, the blood glucose level and hemoglobin A1c were not significantly different from those at baseline. In the glucose tolerance test at the end of the treatment period, the blood glucose and plasma insulin levels after a glucose load of 75 g were not significantly different at any time point, and the sums of each were not significantly different from their baseline levels. Based on these results, bisoprolol appears to be a beta1-selective beta-blocker possessing a satisfactory hypotensive effect without any adverse effects on glucose metabolism for long-term use, and is therefore a safe and useful drug for the treatment of essential hypertension.", 
    "4": "Metoprolol CR/XL (metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets) is a beta1-selective agent that improved survival and reduced hospitalization among patients with New York Heart Association class II-IV heart failure in a randomized trial. Metoprolol CR/XL differs from conventional metoprolol tartrate with respect to pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties that may be clinically important in patients with heart failure. A thorough patient evaluation should be performed to determine optimal dosage and titration of this drug, as with any beta-blocker, and to assess the potential for drug-drug or drug-disease interactions. By applying knowledge of drug-specific characteristics and designing therapy for each individual patient, improvement in patient outcomes can be realized with metoprolol CR/XL.", 
    "5": "Unstable angina accounts for more than one million hospital admissions annually. 6-8% of patients with this condition have non-fatal myocardial infarction or die within the first year after diagnosis. Recently, the term \"acute coronary syndromes\" has been used to describe the spectrum of conditions that includes unstable angina, non-Q-wave myocardial infarction (which generally presents without ST-segment elevation), and Q-wave myocardial infarction (which generally presents with ST-segment elevation).", 
    "6": "Disruption of a formed plaque is a complex pathologic process that is central to the initiation of the acute coronary syndromes. Local thrombosis occurring after plaque disruption results from complex interactions among the lipid core, smooth-muscle cells, macrophages, and collagen.", 
    "7": "Multiple huge clinical trials confirmed that aspirin reduces the risk of death from cardiac causes and fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction by about 50-70% in patients presenting with unstable angina. Ticlopidine may be substituted for aspirin in patients with hypersensitivity to aspirin or gastrointestinal intolerance. Clopidogrel acts similarly to ticlopidin but has fewer side effects than ticlopidine and has not been reported to cause neutropenia. High-risk patients with refractory unstable angina and elevated troponin levels may have substantial benefit of glycoptotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibition. Current practice guidelines support the use of the combination of unfractionated heparin and aspirin for the treatment of unstable angina. Clinical studies have demonstrated that the incidence of the composite end point of death, myocardial infarction, or recurrent angina was lower with enoxaparin than with unfractionated heparin. Beta-blockers, nitrates, and calcium-channel blockers are useful for antiischemic therapy in patients with acute coronary syndromes.", 
    "8": "Effect of penetration enhancers were studied on the permeation of antihypertensive drugs prazosin hydrochloride and atenolol through full thickness skin of swiss albino mice. Atenolol was delivered to skin from saturated alcoholic solution containing 5% of 1-decanol and alcohol alone, while prazosin hydrochloride was saturated in dimethyl formamide(DMF, 5% v/v in water) and dimethyl sulfoxide(DMSO, 5% v/v in water). Atenolol permeation was augmented significantly in decanolic solution and also in pure alcohol. In case of prazosin hydrochloride, significant enhancement of permeation was shown by DMSO but not by DMF.", 
    "9": "Noradrenergic processes within the amygdala have been implicated in the modulation of memory for emotional material. The amygdala has also been associated with the processing of facial expressions of emotion, particularly those of fear and sadness. However, the role of noradrenaline in the latter process is unknown.", 
    "10": "Therefore the present study examined the effect of an oral beta-blocker (propranolol, 80 mg) upon facial expression recognition in healthy volunteers.", 
    "11": "Facial expressions of six basic emotions, which had been \"morphed\" between neutral and each emotional standard, were used in the recognition task. Subjects completed this task both before and 1 h following either propranolol or a placebo. Control measures of choice reaction time and vigilance performance were also included to assess any non-specific effects of the drug upon alertness and speed.", 
    "12": "The administration of propranolol, relative to placebo, specifically increased reaction time to identify facial expressions of sadness correctly, in the absence of changes in speed to recognise other facial expressions of emotion. Subjective ratings of mood and alertness as well as speed in the two control tasks were not altered by propranolol, arguing against an account in terms of general sedation.", 
    "13": "These data suggest that noradrenergic processes are not only involved in memory for emotional material but also in the evaluation of sadness from facial expression. The selective nature of this effect adds to evidence suggesting that the recognition of different expressions of emotion depends upon at least partly separable neural processes. A role for noradrenaline in recognising sadness in others has potential relevance for our understanding of disorders characterised by disturbances in emotional processing.", 
    "14": "There are few data about the incidence, determinants, and clinical course of in-hospital repeat acute myocardial infarction (RE-AMI) after an index AMI. From June 1994 to June 1998, 22,613 patients with AMI as an index event were registered by the Maximal Individual Therapy in Acute Myocardial Infarction (MITRA) and Myocardial Infarction Registries (MIR). Of these, 1,071 (4.7%) had a RE-AMI. For the index event, 9,143 patients (40.5%) were treated with thrombolysis, 1,707 (7.5%) with primary angioplasty, and 443 (2.0%) with a combination of both. Multivariate analysis showed that previous AMI (odds ratio [OR] 1.59; 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.35 to 1.86), age >70 years (OR 1.57; 95% CI 1.36 to 1.81), diagnostic first electrocardiogram (OR 1.37; 95% CI 1.19 to 1.59), and female gender (OR 1.14; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.32) were independently associated with a higher incidence of RE-AMI. The incidence of RE-AMI was higher when patients received thrombolysis (OR 1.36; 95% CI 1.15 to 1.61), and it was lower when they underwent primary angioplasty (OR 0.74; 95% CI 0.53 to 1.03) or received beta blockers (OR 0.84; 95% CI 0.72 to 0.97). Patients with RE-AMI had higher hospital mortality compared with those without RE-AMI (OR 4.35; 95% CI 3.83 to 4.95). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed an independent association of RE-AMI with in-hospital death (OR 6.60; 95% CI 5.61 to 7.70), repeat revascularization (OR 2.91; 95% CI 2.42 to 3.50), low workload capacity on the bicycle ergometry test (OR 2.17; 95% CI 1.71 to 2.76), and ejection fraction <40% (OR 1.72; 95% CI 1.38 to 2.14) at discharge. Thus, RE-AMI occurs in 4.7% of patients after an AMI. Previous AMI, age >70 years, diagnostic first electrocardiogram, and female gender are independent determinants for RE-AMI. Thrombolysis is associated with a higher and beta blockers with a lower incidence of RE-AMI. Once a RE-AMI occurs, it is a strong predictor of in-hospital mortality and morbidity.", 
    "15": "The emphasis on evidence-based medicine and the use of safe, cost-effective therapeutic strategies demands that management decisions be based upon evidence derived from clinical studies. Whilst prospective double blind clinical trials are regarded as the gold standard, there is no doubt that meta-analysis has proved valuable in defining the benefits of antihypertensive therapy. The antihypertensive efficacy of lacidipine has been assessed in a retrospective meta-analysis of a series of clinical studies in which the drug was compared with placebo and all the major classes of antihypertensive agent. All of the studies entered into the meta-analysis were parallel group double blind trials. Efficacy was based upon the reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure and the effect on heart rate at trough immediately prior to dosing during maintenance therapy. In placebo controlled trials a clear dose response relationship was apparent with blood pressure reductions that were significantly greater than that observed with placebo at doses of 2 mg lacidipine and above. In active control trials, diastolic blood pressure reductions of 10-15 mmHg were observed at the end of the monotreatment phases (> 6-8 weeks) with a final reduction of 15-20 mmHg with the efficacy of lacidipine being equivalent to that of the comparator drug. Comparable results were also achieved for the response rates to therapy which varied between 70 and 85% at the end of the monotreatment phase and 82-98 when combination with other antihypertensive agents was permitted. There was no evidence of cardio-acceleration in any of the trials where significant blood pressure reduction was detected. This retrospective analysis in a large population base confirms the documented antihypertensive efficacy of lacidipine and demonstrates the suitability of the drug as a first line antihypertensive agent.",

    "19": "Many clinicians and health systems use the ACC/AHA AMI guidelines to develop treatment plans for AMI patients. This review highlights important changes in AMI drug therapy recommendations by reviewing the results of recent clinical trials. Insights into evolving drug therapy strategies that may impact future guideline development are also described.", 
    "20": "Several changes in drug therapy recommendations were included in the 1999 AMI ACC/AHA guidelines. There is emphasis on administering fibrin-specific thrombolytics secondary to enhanced efficacy. Selection between fibrin-specific agents is unclear at this time. Low response rates to thrombolytics have been noted in the elderly, women, patients with heart failure, and those showing left bundle-branch block on the electrocardiogram. These patient groups should be targeted for improved utilization programs. The use of glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors in non-ST-segment elevation MI was emphasized. Small trials combining reduced doses of thrombolytics with GP IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors have shown promise by increasing reperfusion rates without increasing bleeding risk, but firm conclusions cannot be made until the results of larger trials are known. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) trials suggest lower mortality rates for primary PCI when compared with thrombolysis alone. However, primary PCI, including coronary angioplasty, is only available at approximately 13% of US hospitals, making thrombolysis the preferred strategy for most patients. Clopidogrel has supplanted ticlopidine as the recommended antiplatelet agent for patients with aspirin allergy or intolerance following reports of a better safety profile. The recommended dose of unfractionated heparin is lower than previously recommended, necessitating a separate nomogram for patients with acute coronary syndromes. Routine use of warfarin, either alone or in combination with aspirin, is not supported by clinical trials; however, warfarin remains a choice for antithrombotic therapy in patients intolerant to aspirin. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockers continue to be recommended, and emphasis is placed on improving rates of early administration (during hospitalization), even in patients with moderate left ventricular dysfunction. New recommendations for drug treatment of post-AMI patients with low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and/or elevated triglycerides are included, with either niacin or gemfibrozil recommended as an option. Supplementary antioxidants are not recommended for either primary or secondary prevention of AMI, with new data demonstrating lack of efficacy vitamin E in primary prevention. Estrogen replacement therapy or hormonal replacement therapy should not be initiated solely for prevention of cardiovascular disease, but can be continued in cardiovascular patients already taking long-term therapy for other reasons. Bupropion has been added as a new treatment option for smoking cessation. As drug therapy continues to evolve in treating AMI, more frequent updates of therapy guidelines will be necessary.", 
    "21": "We investigated prediction of the efficacy of beta-blocker therapy in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) by using myocardial scintigraphy with 123I-BMIPP (BMIPP) and 123I-MIBG (MIBG). Thirty-seven patients with DCM were examined by myocardial scintigraphy with BMIPP and MIBG before beta-blocker therapy. Patients were classified into two groups, based on whether they improved > 10% of the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (improved group, n = 21) or not (unimproved group, n = 16). The extent and severity score of BMIPP for the improved group was significantly lower (p < 0.001) than that for unimproved group. It has been suggested that BMIPP is useful in evaluating the prediction of efficacy of beta-blocker therapy in patients with DCM.",

When the angerlike state and myocardial ischemia were superimposed, the augmentation in T-wave alternans magnitude (to 3.27 +/- 0.61 mV X ms, p < 0.05) exceeded their additive effects, increasing by 130% over the angerlike state alone (p < 0.05) and by 390% over occlusion alone (p < 0.05). Adrenergic influences were reduced by the beta1-adrenergic receptor blocking agent metoprolol (1.5 mg/kg, intravenous), which diminished T-wave alternans magnitude (p < 0.0004 for all) during the angerlike response (from 1.40 +/- 0.32 to 0.80 +/- 0.17 mV x ms) and during the combined intervention (from 3.27 +/- 0.61 to 1.23 +/- 0.13 mV X ms). In five additional normal anesthetized canines, atrial pacing at 180 beats/min did not increase T-wave alternans magnitude monitored from lead II electrocardiogram.", 
    "26": "Provocation of an angerlike state results in T-wave alternans in the normal heart and potentiates the magnitude of ischemia-induced T-wave alternans. Elevation in heart rate during arousal does not appear to be the main factor in the development of alternans in the normal heart but may be an important component during myocardial ischemia. Enhanced adrenergic activity appears to mediate the effects in both the normal and ischemic hearts. T-wave alternans may constitute a useful electrophysiologic measure for clinical use in conjunction with behavioral stress testing or ambulatory monitoring.",

Carvedilol also decreased the mean number of hospitalizations per patient (for cardiovascular reasons 30% [p = 0.02], for heart failure 53% [p = 0.03]). Among hospitalized patients, carvedilol reduced severity of illness during hospital admission, as reflected by shorter length of stay and less frequent use of intensive care.

Previous studies have demonstrated differences in the progression to glomerulosclerosis with the use of different antihypertensive drugs. We analyzed whether the use of carvedilol (CVD), a new beta-adrenoceptor antagonist and vasodilator slows the progression of glomerulosclerosis in 5/6 nephrectomised (Nx) rats. Fifty-four adult Sprague-Dawley rats were distributed among five groups, four with 5/6 Nx, vehicle treated and CVD at 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg/day and sham (no renal ablation or drug treatment). Tailcuff blood pressure, serum creatinine and urine protein concentration were measured. At the end of the experiment remnant kidney was removed for morphometric studies. Rats treated with 10 and 20 mg/kg/day of CVD showed controlled systemic blood pressure. Serum creatinine was similar in all treated groups with CVD, and half the levels observed in the vehicle-treated rats. The prevalence of glomerular lesions was closely associated with the degree of proteinuria. Eleven weeks after 5/6 Nx, vehicle-treated rats exhibited marked GS with 76% of affected glomeruli and creatinine retention. By contrast, renal injury was largely prevent in those rats treated with 10 and 20 mg/kg/day of CVD. Tuft enlargement occurred in all groups but was more prominent in vehicle-treated group, 1.5 times higher than the group treated with 20 mg/kg/day of CVD. Although, these data demonstrate the importance of systemic blood pressure control in the renal protective efficacy of carvedilol, other less-known mechanisms of this drug must be investigated.",

    "52": "Multi-probe microdialysis was used to investigate the interaction between the release of noradrenaline and dopamine in the medial prefrontal cortex. Retrograde microdialysis was used to stimulate or inhibit the activity of the locus coeruleus for a restricted period of time, and the response of extracellular noradrenaline and dopamine in the ipsilateral and contralateral medial prefrontal cortex was recorded with microdialysis probes. Infusion of clonidine into the locus coeruleus (100 microM for 45 min) suppressed noradrenaline release and slightly inhibited dopamine release in the ipsilateral medial prefrontal cortex. Application of carbachol to the locus coeruleus (100 microM for 45 min) stimulated both the noradrenaline and dopamine release in the ipsilateral medial prefrontal cortex. No changes were seen in the contralateral medial prefrontal cortex. In the ipsilateral nucleus accumbens, extracellular noradrenaline levels increased, but dopamine levels remained unchanged. Application to the locus coeruleus (during 10 min) of the glutamate receptor agonists N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) (300 microM) or kainate (100 microM) strongly increased extracellular noradrenaline and dopamine levels in the ipsilateral medial prefrontal cortex. However, in the contralateral probe the release of dopamine (but not of noradrenaline) was also stimulated. Application of carbachol to the locus coeruleus was used as a model to further investigate the presumed noradrenaline-dopamine interaction. In a series of dual-probe experiments, alpha(1)-, alpha(2)-, and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (prazosin, idazoxan, propranolol) or a reuptake-inhibitor (nomifensine) was administered during carbachol stimulation of the locus coeruleus. Prazosin and propranolol were administered systemically in a dose of 3 mg/kg, whereas idazoxan (10 microM) and nomifensine (100 microM) were infused into the medial prefrontal cortex. However, none of these pretreatments modified the effects of the control carbachol-infusions. The results did not identify a receptor-interaction or a common reuptake site that explained the presumed interaction between dopamine and noradrenaline in the medial prefrontal cortex. Therefore, the noradrenaline-dopamine interaction hypothesis could not be confirmed or refuted.", 
    "53": "J. D. Port and M. R. Bristow. Altered Beta-adrenergic Receptor Gene Regulation and Signaling in Chronic Heart Failure. Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology (2001) 33, 887-905. Beta adrenergic receptors (beta -ARs) are critical regulators of cardiac function in both normal and pathophysiological states. Under normal conditions, beta -ARs and their signaling pathways modulate both the rate and force of myocardial contraction and relaxation, allowing individuals to respond appropriately to physiological stress or exercise. However, in chronic heart failure, sustained activation of the beta -AR signaling pathways can have overtly negative biological consequences. This notion is reinforced by the positive outcomes of a number of clinical trials demonstrating the usefulness of beta-blocker therapy in chronic congestive heart failure. During the last few years, significant progress has been made in understanding the molecular biological basis of beta -AR function, both at the biochemical and genetic levels. In this review, the biological basis of adrenergic signaling and how this changes in heart failure is discussed. Aspects of adrenergic receptor pharmacology relevant to heart failure are reviewed, including the recently emerging differences described for beta(1)- v beta(2)-AR signaling pathways. Highlighting these differences is recent evidence that over-stimulation of the beta(1)-AR pathway in cardiac myocytes appears to be pro-apoptotic, whereas stimulation of the beta(2)-AR pathway may be anti-apoptotic. Overview of beta -AR gene regulation, transgenic models of beta -AR overexpression, and beta -AR polymorphisms as they relate to heart failure progression are also discussed.",

Pindolol was initially thought to act by preventing the inhibition of 5-HT release, elicited by SSRIs and other 5-HT-acting drugs, as a result of its ability to antagonize the action of 5-HT at midbrain raphe 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors that control the activity of ascending 5-HT-mediated pathways. However, the partial agonist properties of pindolol at 5-HT(1A) receptors and beta-adrenoceptors suggest that other explanations for its action are also possible. In this article, recent controversial data on the mechanism of action of pindolol, which are crucial for the development of more rapid and efficient antidepressant therapies, will be discussed.",

    "69": "The purpose of this investigation was a study of simultaneous permeability measurement using compound mixtures (cassette dosing) as an alternative to single compound evaluation in order to increase the capacity of screens for intestinal drug permeability. Drug transport across Caco-2 monolayers was studied, both in the apical to basolateral and the basolateral to apical direction. The apparent permeability coefficients for ten compounds displaying different intestinal transport mechanisms were determined, first as single compounds and then as components of a mixture. Seven beta-adrenoceptor antagonists and baclofen were analysed simultaneously using reversed phase HPLC with UV detection, D-glucose and mannitol were measured by scintillation counting. The results indicated that the Papp from the mixture as donor phase correlated well with that of the single compounds and merely small changes in the Papp of each compound were observed between the single compound and mixture experiments. This minor variation resulted in a change in rank-order of the poorly permeable compounds in the mixture, however, without affecting their association with the permeability class according to the biopharmaceutics classification system (BCS). It can be concluded that the use of compound mixtures is a suitable method for improving the capacity in permeability screens. Further improvement of the throughput may be expected upon automatisation of permeability measurements using robotics combined with increased selectivity using LC-MS analysis.", 
    "70": "Variceal bleeding is the result of portal hypertension, which is a major complication of liver cirrhosis and carries a high mortality rate. Because of the mortality associated with variceal bleeding, strategies for prevention of the first bleed is important. Risk stratification is important in determining those at risk of bleeding from varices and current data suggest that patients with large varices with red signs, severe underlying liver disease and those who have a hepatic venous pressure gradient of greater than 12 mmHg are at high risk of bleeding. Surveillance for varices in patients with cirrhosis is therefore important. The current review evaluates the role of various treatments in the primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding. The current first choice treatment is non-selective beta-blockers; which is cheap, easy to administer, and reduces the risk of first variceal haemorrhage significantly. Combination of beta-blockers and nitrates looks promising but needs further evaluation. Endoscopic variceal band ligation compares favourably with non-selective beta-blockers in preventing the first bleeding episode in cirrhotic patients and may be an alternative for patients who cannot tolerate, or have contraindications to beta-blockers. The role of monitoring the hepatic venous pressure gradient in those being treated with pharmacological agents, the role of newer drugs such as non-selective beta-blockers with intrinsic alpha-adrenergic activity and angiotensin receptor blockers require further evaluation.", 
    "71": "Transdermal permeation of propranolol through human skin in the presence of fatty acid (lauric, capric) penetration enhancers has been investigated. Thermal analysis showed that binary mixtures of propranolol with either fatty acid were not simple mechanical mixtures of the two components. Propranolol formed 1:1 molar addition compounds with both lauric and capric acids; the addition compound produced from propranolol and lauric acid (m.p. 79 degrees C) also developed eutectic systems with both propranolol (m.p. 54 degrees C) and lauric acid (m.p. 16 degrees C). Similarly, the addition compound made from propranolol and capric acid (m.p. 97 degrees C) formed eutectic systems with propranolol (m.p. 83 degrees C) and capric acid (m.p. 15 degrees C). Infrared analyses indicated that the addition compounds were fatty acid salts of the beta-blocker. The nature of the species permeating through human epidermal membranes from binary mixtures of propranolol with the fatty acids was investigated using a novel attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared method. There was no clear difference in permeation rates of the fatty acids compared with the beta-blocker, suggesting that the permeating species was the intact addition compound. The influence of melting point depression of the beta-blocker fatty acid systems on transdermal permeation was predicted from a mathematical model; predicted and experimentally determined data correlated well thus providing an alternative explanation as to the mode of action of these permeation enhancers.",

    "77": "Stable angina pectoris, a symptom of coronary heart disease (CHD), manifests as stress-induced ischaemic episodes resulting in severe chest pain. Therapeutic aims are to improve quality of life by decreasing anginal attacks and to prevent myocardial infarction (MI) and death. Current anginal medications include beta-blockers and calcium antagonists, which decrease ischaemic severity by reducing cardiac workload, and nitrates, which increase coronary blood flow. A new therapeutic approach is the use of metabolic agents, such as trimetazidine, which are cytoprotective during ischaemia. Results of several clinical trials demonstrated that trimetazidine, at the standard dose of 20 mg t.i.d., increased exercise capacity, decreased anginal incidence and decreased left-ventricular (LV) dysfunction compared to placebo. Trimetazidine was also as effective as propranolol (120 - 160 mg/day) and nifedipine (40 mg/day) in decreasing anginal episodes and improving exercise parameters. Trimetazidine improved anginal frequency and symptoms in patients in which treatment with diltiazem, nifedipine, propranolol, pindolol, oxprenolol or long-acting nitrates had failed. Trimetazidine was also more effective than isosorbide dinitrate (30 mg/day) as an adjunct to propranolol. Despite efficacy being equivalent to that of beta-blockers and calcium antagonists, trimetazidine does not depress cardiac function and, correspondingly, is not contraindicated in any condition. Adverse effects of trimetazidine are mild and infrequent. In summary, clinical data indicate that trimetazidine is a safe, effective treatment for the symptoms of stable angina pectoris when used either as a monotherapy or an adjunctive therapy. Longer-term trials are necessary to determine whether trimetazidine will be effective in reducing rates of mortality and MI.", 
    "78": "Along with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), the beta-adrenergic receptor blockers have gradually emerged to be standard in the therapy of heart failure. Individual beta-blockers that have been shown to reduce all-cause mortality in patients with heart failure include bisoprolol, metoprolol and carvedilol. Carvedilol distinguishes from the other beta-blockers as being a non-selective beta(1)- and beta(2)-receptor blocker with (1)-receptor blockade effect and anti-oxidant properties. The drug does not have sympathomimetic activity and has vasodilatory effects attributable to its (1)-receptor blockade property. Experimental and clinical studies have confirmed carvedilol's vasodilator, anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic properties, which may contribute to its effect in reversing cardiac remodelling in animal models and patients with heart failure. These pharmacological properties render carvedilol a potentially useful agent in the treatment of patients with heart failure. Early studies of carvedilol in heart failure have reported beneficial haemodynamic effects but variable effects on exercise tolerance and clinical well being. The large-scale US Carvedilol Heart Failure Program and the Australian/New Zealand Heart Failure Collaborative Research Group reported beneficial effects of carvedilol on mortality, morbidity and clinical well being in patients with mild-to-moderate heart failure. The recently reported but yet unpublished preliminary results of the COPERNICUS study suggest that carvedilol improves mortality and morbidity in patients with advanced heart failure and severe symptoms. At this time, it is unclear whether the ancillary pharmacological properties of carvedilol can be translated to more superior clinical benefit compared to the other beta-blockers. Preliminary studies examining surrogate end points suggest that carvedilol may improve left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) more than metoprolol. More conclusive information regarding their relative effects of clinical outcomes will await the completion of the COMET study, which compares the effect of metoprolol and carvedilol on mortality and morbidity, expected at the end of the year 2002.",

Blends of the crystalline and amorphous phases in different ratios (from 75:25 to 99:01) were prepared by serial dilution. TSC studies were performed by applying an electric field at a temperature above the glass transition temperature (Tg) to orient the dipoles, rapidly cooling to 0 degrees C, short circuiting for 1 min, and scanning at 7 degrees C/min to measure the depolarization current. The temperature of the peak in the spectrum corresponds to the Tg of the amorphous phase. Modulated differential scanning calorimtery (DSC) studies were performed using three different test protocols (varying linear heating rate, modulation amplitude, and time period). Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies were performed using a Siemens D500 diffractometer.", 
    "81": "The ability to detect the amorphous phase by powder XRD is beset with problems due to indirect inference, orientation effects, and instrument-related intensity variations. Even using a consistent sampling procedure and an internal standard, the XRD could quantify the amorphous phase at a level of 5%.

Using modulated DSC it was possible to detect the amorphous phase at a level of 5% when tested at a heating rate of 2 degrees C/min and an amplitude of +/-1.0 degrees C with a period of 30 s. The moisture sorption method appears to have a similar detection capability. In TSC scans, the glass transition event due to molecular/segmental mobility in the amorphous phase was manifested as a peak/shoulder on the low-temperature side of the depolarization peak of the crystalline phase. The amorphous phase was unambiguously detected at 2% with a lower detection limit of approximately 1%.",

    "83": "Torsade de pointes is a rare but potentially fatal ventricular arrhythmia associated with drug-induced delayed repolarization and prolongation of the QT interval. To determine if the arrhythmogenic potential of noncardiac drugs can be assessed in vitro, we evaluated the effects of 12 drugs on the action potential duration (APD) of cardiac Purkinje fibers and compared results with clinical observations. APD changes in canine and porcine fibers were evaluated under physiologic conditions (37 degrees C, [K+]0 = 4 mM) using standard microelectrode techniques. Six of seven drugs associated with QT prolongation or torsade de pointes in man (cisapride, erythromycin, grepafloxacin, moxifloxacin, sertindole, and sotalol) affected concentration-dependent prolongation of the APD in canine fibers during slow stimulation (2-s basic cycle length), attaining greater than 15% prolongation at high concentrations (> or = 10-fold clinically encountered plasma levels). Each of five drugs not linked clinically to QT prolongation and torsade de pointes (azithromycin, enalaprilat, fluoxetine, indomethacin, and pinacidil) failed to attain 15% prolongation, with fluoxetine, indomethacin, and pinacidil abbreviating the APD. Drugs eliciting the greatest prolongation also demonstrated prominent reverse rate-dependent effects. The antihistamine terfenadine (linked to dose-dependent QT prolongation and torsade de pointes clinically) only minimally prolonged the APD in canine and porcine fibers (and exerted no effect on midmyocardial fibers from left ventricular free wall) at supratherapeutic concentrations. On the basis of concentration-dependent APD prolongation and reverse rate-dependent effects, this Purkinje fiber model detects six of seven drugs linked clinically to acquired long QT syndrome and torsade de pointes, and clears each of five drugs not associated with repolarization abnormalities (overall 92% accuracy), validating the utility of this Purkinje fiber model in the preclinical evaluation of QT prolongation and proarrhythmic risk by noncardiac drugs.", 
    "84": "In freeze tolerant wood frog Rana sylvatica, the freeze-induced liberation of glucose plays a critical role in survival in response to sub-zero temperature exposure. We have shown that the glycaemic response is linked to selective changes in the expression of hepatic adrenergic receptors through which catecholamines act to produce their hepatic glycogenolytic effects. The purpose of the present study was to determine if skeletal muscle, another catecholamine-sensitive tissue with glycogenolytic potential, displayed similar or different changes. In order to achieve these objectives, skeletal muscle derived from Rana sylvatica was studied in control, frozen and thawed states. In isolated sarcolemmal fractions, freezing effected an 88% decrease in beta(2)-adrenergic receptor expression but was without effect on the calcium pump; while thawing resulted in a recovery of the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor to 60% of control levels and a 2.4-fold increase in calcium transport. In isolated sarcoplasmic reticular fractions, freezing effected a 52% decrease in calcium binding and a 92% decrease in oxalate-stimulated calcium uptake; while thawing elicited partial normalization to control levels to 70% with respect to calcium binding and to 47% with respect to calcium uptake. Freezing and thawing were associated with increases and decreases, receptively, in blood glucose levels but were without effect on skeletal muscle glycogen content. Thus these muscle changes in Rana sylvatica in freezing and thawing are not linked to glycogen breakdown, are different from those previously seen in liver, and may provide a role in recovery of muscle function during thawing by protecting glycogen stores for contraction and maximizing extracellular calcium for excitation-contraction coupling in the frozen state. The involvement of thyroid hormone in triggering these muscle changes is discussed.", 
    "85": "New methods were established for the rapid and simultaneous isolation of multiple sarcolemmal and sarcoplasmic reticular fractions from very small amounts (0.25-2.0 g) of skeletal muscle. Thebeta(2)-adrenergic receptor and calcium transport systems were used as indices of purity and functional integrity as well as being the focal points of the study. These methods were found to be suitable for the special needs of small tissue samples, allowed rapid preparation and were appropriate for skeletal muscle from various species, frogs to mammals. The sarcolemmalbeta(2)-adrenergic receptor was expressed in frogs and mammals at similar levels of expression (336-454 fmol. x mg(-1)). The calcium pump was also present in sarcolemmal and sarcoplasmic reticular fractions in all species but notable species differences were found. In sarcolemmal fractions, while calcium binding was uniformly low (<1 nmol. x mg(-1)), oxalate stimulation was variable: low in frogs ( approximately 1.05-fold) high in mammals (120-450-fold). In sarcoplasmic reticular fractions, calcium binding was low in frogs (4-9 nmol. x mg(-1)) and much higher in mammals (322-383 nmol. x mg(-1)); oxalate stimulated calcium transport to a much greater extent in frogs (<70-fold) than in mammals (1.6-2-fold). It is concluded that thebeta(2)-adrenergic receptor appears to be strongly conserved in skeletal muscle while the use of calcium pumps evolves from reliance in Amphibia on the sarcoplasmic reticular calcium pump to the use in Mammalia of calcium pumps from both the sarcoplasmic reticulum and the plasma membrane.", 
    "86": "This study was designed to investigate the role of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(1B) receptors located in the ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens in the modulation of accumbal dopaminergic transmission. The selective 5-HT(1B) receptor agonist CP 93129 [3-(1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-4-pyridyl)pyrrolo[3,2-b]pyrid-5-one] was administered into the ventral tegmental area or nucleus accumbens of freely moving Sprague-Dawley rats via retrograde microdialysis. The effects of intra-accumbal and intra-tegmental CP 93129 on extracellular dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens were measured using one- and dual-probe microdialysis, respectively. For dual-probe microdialysis, one probe was in the ventral tegmental area for drug administration and the other in the ipsilateral nucleus accumbens for dopamine measurement. The results show that infusion of CP 93129 (2, 5 and 10 microM) into the nucleus accumbens increased local dopamine levels in a concentration-related manner. Infusion of CP 93129 (10 and 20 microM) into the ventral tegmental area also increased dopamine levels in the ipsilateral nucleus accumbens. The increased dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens produced by intra-accumbal or intra-tegmental CP 93129 was antagonized by co-infusion of cyanopindolol (5 microM), a 5-HT(1B/1A) receptor antagonist, but not by WAY-100635 [N-(2-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl)ethyl)-N-2-pyridinyl-cyclohexanecarboxamide] (5 microM), a highly selective 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist. In addition, augmentations of dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens induced by intra-accumbal CP 93129 were sensitive to Na(+) channel blockade with tetrodotoxin. These results are not in opposition to the concept that 5-HT(1B) receptors within the ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens are all involved in the modulation of dopamine release in the terminal area of the mesolimbic dopamine system.", 
    "87": "Long-term activation of the sympathetic nervous system exerts adverse biologic effects that are mediated through alpha(1), beta(1) and beta(2) receptors and that contribute importantly to the progression of heart failure. As a result, beta blockers are no longer considered to be contraindicated for use in these patients but instead now play a critical role in the successful management of chronic heart failure. Beta blockers have been evaluated in >15,000 patients with heart failure who have participated in placebo-controlled trials. The results of these studies indicate that, like angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, long-term treatment with beta blockers can lessen symptoms and improve clinical status and can reduce the risk of death as well as the combined risk of death or hospitalization. The database supporting the use of beta blockers is now as persuasive (and arguably more persuasive) than the database supporting the use of ACE inhibitors in heart failure (which comprises about 7,000 patients). Yet, the benefits of beta blockers are seen in patients already receiving ACE inhibitors, suggesting that combined blockade of two neurohormonal systems (renin-angiotensin system and sympathetic nervous system) can produce additive effects.", 
    "88": "We reviewed the literature on clinical trials of beta-adrenergic blockade for treatment of heart failure, seeking evidence of reductions in hospital admissions. To analyze the economic implications of six clinical trials, we developed a stochastic cost model to generate estimates of total medical costs resulting from heart failure and related causes. The model includes inpatient, outpatient, and professional cost estimates based on Medicare claims data, and it is driven by traditional endpoint statistics reported in the clinical trial literature. It provides a common framework for comparing cost effectiveness across clinical trials in the absence of detailed cost information collected in the trial. The incremental expected cost per year of life saved is $3,300 for bisoprolol, $2,500 for metoprolol, and $6,700 for carvedilol. The cost per year of life saved for each compound is well below accepted standards for cost effectiveness. These results are sensitive to the cost of drug therapy and the relative mortality rate for the experimental group. For example, if the relative mortality rate of the experimental group were to increase from the reported 40% to 82%, and if the annual cost of the drug were to decrease from $2,000 to $500, then we estimate that carvedilol would break even and the cost per year of life saved would drop to zero. Whether beta-blocker therapy, as assumed, sustains its differential effectiveness in terms of relative mortality risk beyond the study duration has not been demonstrated.", 
    "89": "Heart failure exacts a severe human and public health toll. In the United States, heart failure afflicts approximately 5 million patients and is responsible for or contributes to 3 million hospitalizations and 300,000 deaths yearly. Physicians can have a major impact on this disease by using effective agents for the treatment of heart failure (particularly angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors and beta blockers), yet the actual clinical use of these drugs (especially the use of beta blockers by primary physicians) is disappointingly low. Many physicians appear to be reluctant to prescribe beta blockers for two reasons. First, they are concerned about the potential interference of beta blockers with important compensatory mechanisms that support the failing heart and fear that such interference may lead to clinical deterioration. Second, they fail to identify patients with heart failure (especially those with mild or moderate symptoms) or regard such patients as being too well to require additional treatment. These reasons should no longer be used as excuses to avoid the use of these drugs, given the persuasive evidence that beta blockers can improve symptoms and prolong life in patients with heart failure. Instead, physicians must recognize that long-term activation of the sympathetic nervous system primarily exerts deleterious (rather than compensatory) effects in patients with heart failure and that these actions can be antagonized effectively and safely by the appropriate use of beta-blocking drugs.", 
    "90": "Heart failure is a changing paradigm. The hemodynamic model, which served our needs well from the 1950s through the early 1980s, has now been largely abandoned, except for the management of decompensated patients in the hospital. The pathophysiology is exceedingly complex and involves structural changes, such as loss of myofilaments, apoptosis and disorganization of the cytoskeleton, as well as disturbances in Ca(2+) homeostasis, alteration in receptor density, signal transduction, and collagen synthesis. A more contemporary working hypothesis is that heart failure is a progressive disorder of left ventricular remodeling, usually resulting from an index event, that culminates in a clinical syndrome characterized by impaired cardiac function and circulatory congestion. This change in the framework of our understanding of the pathophysiology of heart failure is predicated on the results of numerous clinical trials conducted during the past 20 years. New therapies are now evolving that are designed to inhibit neuroendocrine and cytokine activation, whereas drugs specifically designed to heighten cardiac contractility and \"unload\" the left ventricle have proven to be unhelpful in long-term management of patients with chronic heart failure. However, the hemodynamic model is still relevant for patients in the hospital with decompensated heart failure, where positive inotropic drugs and vasodilators are still widely used. The modern treatment of chronic heart failure is now largely based on the neurohormonal hypothesis, which states that neuroendocrine activation is important in the progression of heart failure and that inhibition of neurohormones is likely to have long-term benefit with regard to morbidity and mortality. Thus, the evolution of treatment for chronic heart failure as a result of clinical trials has provided much enlightenment for our understanding of the fundamental biology of the disorder, a reversal of the usual flow of information from basic science to clinical investigation.", 
    "91": "Beta-blocker therapy is beneficial both after myocardial infarction and in mild, moderate and severe chronic heart failure. Recent sub-group analysis of the Goteborg Metoprolol Trial and the AIRE study confirm that patients receiving beta-blockers in the setting of post-MI heart failure fare better than patients not receiving this therapy. For all these reasons the CAPRICORN trial of carvedilol in post-MI LV dysfunction was an important and eagerly awaited trial. The results were presented for the first time at The American College of Cardiology on March 20 2001. CAPRICORN randomised 984 patients to placebo and 975 to carvedilol between 3 and 21 days (mean 10) after a confirmed MI. Patients had to have evidence of a left ventricular ejection fraction 40% or less. All patients had received ACEI therapy for at least 48 hours prior to randomisation. The mean ejection fraction of the patients recruited was 32.7% in the placebo group and 32.9% in the carvedilol group. Follow-up was for a mean of 15 months (maximum 2.7 years). All cause mortality was 15.3% (151 deaths) in the placebo group and 11.9% (116 deaths) in the carvedilol group, giving a hazard ratio of 0.77 (0.60-0.98) and a significance of p = 0.031. And yet this agent will probably not be given a licence for this indication in the European Union and the USA. The reason is one of trial design and statistical declarations. Some way into the trial the Steering Committee decided to change the primary end-point form all-cause mortality to two co-primary end-points and to allocate their alpha power of 0.05 unevenly between the combined end-points of all cause mortality and cardiovascular hospitalisation (alpha 0.045) and all cause mortality (alpha 0.005). In the end neither was achieved, one because of the large number of non-specific hospitalisations for chest pain and the mortality effect because it was allocated a punitive and unachievable target of p < 0.005. The trial is thus officially neutral despite showing convincing clinical benefit. Clearly arcane matters of statistical plans do matter and steering committees should think very carefully before changing the primary end-points of major trials.", 
    "92": "Insulin-secreting pancreatic islet beta-cells possess anion-permeable Cl- channels (I(Cl,islet)) that are swelling-activated, but the role of these channels in the cells is unclear. The Cl- channel blockers 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS) and niflumic acid were evaluated for their ability to inhibit I(Cl,islet) in clonal beta-cells (HIT cells). Both drugs blocked the channel, but the blockade due to niflumic acid was less voltage-dependent than the blockade due to DIDS. HIT cell volume initially increased in hypotonic solution and was followed by a regulatory volume decrease (RVD). The addition of niflumic acid and, to a lesser extent, DIDS to the hypotonic solution potentiated swelling and blocked the RVD. In isotonic solution, niflumic acid produced swelling, suggesting that islet Cl- channels are activated under basal conditions. The channel blockers glyburide, gadolinium, or tetraethylammonium-Cl did not alter hypotonic-induced swelling or volume regulation. The Na/K/2Cl transport blocker furosemide produced cell shrinkage in isotonic solution and blocked cell swelling normally induced by hypotonic solution. Perifused HIT cells secreted insulin when challenged with hypotonic solutions. However, this could not be completely attributed to I(Cl,islet)-mediated depolarization, because secretion persisted even when Cl- channels were fully blocked. To test whether blocker-resistant secretion occurred via a distal pathway, distal secretion was isolated using 50 mmol/l potassium and diazoxide. Under these conditions, glucose-dependent secretion was blunted, but hypotonically induced secretion persisted, even with Cl- channel blockers present. These results suggest that beta-cell swelling stimulates insulin secretion primarily via a distal I(Cl,islet)-independent mechanism, as has been proposed for K(ATP)-independent glucose- and sulfonylurea-stimulated insulin secretion. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of HIT cell mRNA identified a CLC-3 transcript in HIT cells. In other systems, CLC-3 is believed to mediate swelling-induced outwardly rectifying Cl- channels. This suggests that the proximal effects of swelling to regulate cell volume may be mediated by CLC-3 or a closely related Cl- channel.", 
    "93": "Rat islet beta-cells spread in response to glucose when attached on the matrix produced by a rat bladder carcinoma cell line (804G). Furthermore, in a mixed population of cells, it has been observed previously that spread cells secrete more insulin acutely in response to glucose, compared with cells that remain rounded. These results suggest bi-directional signaling between the islet beta-cell and the extracellular matrix. In the present study, the role of increased intracellular free Ca2+ concentration [Ca2+]i as an intracellular step linking glucose stimulation and beta-cell spreading (inside-out signaling) was investigated. Purified rat beta-cells were attached to this matrix and incubated under various conditions known to affect [Ca2+]i. The effect of glucose on beta-cell spreading was mimicked by 25 mmol/l KCl (which induces calcium influx) and inhibited by diazoxide (which impairs depolarization and calcium entry) and by the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker SR-7037. When a 24-h incubation at 16.7 glucose was followed by 24 h at 2.8 mmol/l, beta-cells that had first spread regained a round phenotype. In the presence of thapsigargin, spreading progressed throughout the experiment, suggesting that capture of calcium by the endoplasmic reticulum is involved in the reversibility of spreading previously induced by glucose. Spreading was still observed in degranulated beta-cells and in botulinum neurotoxin E-expressing beta-cells when exocytosis was prevented. In summary, the results indicate that increased [Ca2+]i is required for the glucose-induced spreading of beta-cells on 804G matrix and that it is not a consequence of exocytotic processes that follow elevation of [Ca2+]i.", 
    "94": "A sensitive high-performance liquid chromatographic method using fluorescence detection has been developed for sotalol determination in small plasma samples of children and newborns with limited blood volume. In sample sizes of 100 microl of plasma, sotalol was extracted using an internal standard and solid-phase extraction columns. Chromatographic separation was performed on a Spherisorb C6 column of 150x4.6 mm I.D. and 5 microm particle size at ambient temperature. The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile-15 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 3.0) (70:30, v/v). The excitation wavelength was set at 235 nm, emission at 300 nm. The flow-rate was 1 ml/min. Sotalol and the internal standard atenolol showed recoveries of 107+/-8.9 and 97+/-8.1%, respectively. The linearity range for sotalol was between 0.07 and 5.75 microg/ml, the limit of quantitation 0.09 microg/ml. Precision values expressed as percent relative standard deviation of intra-assay varied between 0.6 and 13.6%, that of inter-assay between 2.4 and 14.4%. Accuracy varied between 86.1 and 109.8% (intra-assay) and 95.4 and 103.3% (inter-assay). Other clinically used antiarrhythmic drugs did not interfere. As an application of the assay, sotalol plasma concentrations in a 6-year-old child with supraventricular tachycardia treated with oral sotalol (3.2 mg/kg per day) are reported.", 
    "95": "In this study we tested the influence of activation of ATP-sensitive K+ channels (KATP) on the changes in automatism induced by isoprenaline, noradrenaline and phenylephrine. Experiments were performed on the spontaneously beating right atria isolated from guinea pig. The rate of spontaneously beating preparations was measured under different experimental conditions. Rilmakalim (formerly HOE 234) was used as an activator of KATP channels. Isoprenaline induced significant, concentration-dependent positive inotropic action. This effect was strongly attenuated only in the presence of selective blockers of beta1- (metoprolol), but not beta2-adrenoceptor subtype (ICI 11855). Pretreatment with 4 microM rilmakalim resulted in a significant increase in the described effects of isoprenaline on automatism of isolated right atria. Phenylephrine (1 to 100 microM) in the presence of 1 microM propranolol, did not cause any changes in automatism of guinea pig right atria. Slight but significant positive chronotropic action induced by noradrenaline at lower concentrations (0.1 to 10 microM) in the presence of 1 microM propranolol was significantly decreased by pretreatment with rilmakalim. However, the effects obtained at higher concentrations (30 and 100 microM) of noradrenaline were enhanced. Interactions mentioned above were prevented by addition of 3 microM glibenclamide. The results imply that positive chronotropic effect of noradrenaline in the presence of propranolol is mediated by adrenoceptor subtype different from alpha1-, beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors.",

The ratios of the relative risks associated with carvedilol for these two outcome variables in black as compared with nonblack patients were 0.74 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.42 to 1.34) and 0.94 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.43 to 2.05), respectively. Carvedilol also improved functional class, ejection fraction, and the patients' and physicians' global assessments in both the black patients and the nonblack patients.

    "108": "Although a wide range of antihypertensive agents is available, adequate blood pressure control is achieved in only about 25% of hypertensive patients. Poor control rates are often due to inadequate patient compliance and unacceptable side-effects. The importance of once-daily dosing is now fully acknowledged, but it is crucial that therapy when given once a day must be effective at the end of the dosing interval to order to minimize the likelihood of sudden cardiac death, myocardial infarction and stroke. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) provides a thorough assessment of the blood pressure-lowering characteristics of an antihypertensive agent throughout the dosing interval and can more accurately evaluate differences in the duration of the antihypertensive effect of different agents. Telmisartan, a new angiotensin II receptor antagonist, has been extensively studied in clinical trials using ABPM. When compared with dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, beta-adrenergic blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and other angiotensin II receptor antagonists, telmisartan has proved superior in diminishing ambulatory blood pressure throughout the 24-h period between doses. Telmisartan also has excellent tolerability and in clinical trials demonstrates no increase, irrespective of dose level, over placebo in the incidence of adverse events. Thus, telmisartan given once daily provides high efficacy and tolerability, and will hopefully assist in improving both blood pressure control rates and cardiovascular outcomes in the future.", 
    "109": "We investigated the role of different reactive oxygen species (ROS) in ultraviolet A (UVA)-induced DNA damage in a human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT. UVA irradiation increased the intracellular levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), detected by a fluorescent probe carboxydichlorodihydrofluorescein, and caused oxidative DNA damage, single strand-breaks and alkali-labile sites, measured by alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay). Superoxide anion (O2*-) was a likely substrate for H2O2 production since diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC), a superoxide dismutase blocker, decreased the level of intracellular H2O2. Hydrogen peroxide was shown to play a central role in DNA damage. Increasing the intracellular levels of H2O2 with aminotriazole (AT) (a catalase blocker) and buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) (an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis) potentiated the UVA-induced DNA damage. Exogenous H2O2 was also able to induce DNA damage. Since H2O2 alone is not able to damage DNA directly, we investigated the significance of the H2O2-derived hydroxyl radical (*OH). Addition of FeSO4, that stimulates *OH formation from H2O2 (Fenton reaction) resulted in a twofold increase of DNA-damage. Desferrioxamine, an iron chelator that blocks the Fenton reaction, prevented UVA-induced DNA damage. We also employed a panel of less specific antioxidants and enzyme modulators. Sodium selenite (Na-Se) present in glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin reductase and addition of glutathione (GSH) prevented DNA-damage. Tocopherol potently prevented UVA-and H2O2-induced DNA damage and reduced intracellular H2O2 -levels. Ascorbic acid reduced H2O2 production, but only partly prevented DNA damage. Singlet oxygen (1O2) did not seem to play an important role in the UVA-induced DNA-damage since the specific 1O2 scavenger sodium azide (NaN3) and the less specific 1O2 scavenger beta-carotene did not markedly prevent either DNA-damage or H2O2 production. In conclusion the conversion of H2O2 to *OH appears to be the most important step in UVA-induced generation of strand breaks and alkali-labile sites and the bulk H2O2 appears to originate from O2*- generated by UVA irradiation.",

    "114": "Experimental activation of parasympathetic vasodilatation and salivation in the submandibular gland by a \"pseudoreflex\" method has definite advantages over other commonly used methods. However, it is unclear which stimulation sites allow for avoidance of direct activation of the parasympathetic efferents to this gland. We examined this question in heavily anesthetized (alpha-chloralose and urethane), artificially ventilated, cervically vago-sympathectomized cats, using the intersection of the chorda-lingual nerve and the submandibular gland duct (\"the intersection\") as our reference point. Both vasodilatation and salivation evoked by electrical stimulation of the lingual nerve were abolished by section of the chorda-lingual nerve (10 mm proximal to the intersection), provided the stimulation site was distal to the intersection by 4 mm or more. This salivation was abolished by the muscarinic receptor antagonist, scopolamine. Thus, by careful choice of stimulation site, submandibular gland responses mediated solely by reflex parasympathetic mechanisms can be evoked by lingual nerve stimulation in this preparation.", 
    "115": "Since severe and fatal poisoning with beta-blockers due only to beta-receptor blockade is unlikely, a prospective and partly retrospective analysis of 67 patients with beta-blockers poisoning was done in five-year period in order to determine the factors influencing the degree and outcome of acute poisoning. According to pharmacological properties of drugs, the patients were divided in groups: group I--50 patients with propranolol, group II-A--10 patients with atenolol and group II-B--7 patients with metoprolol poisoning. Electrocardiogram (ECG), 24-h ECG monitoring, toxicological screening (determination of beta-blockers in blood, urine and lavage by high performance liquid chromatography) and biochemical analysis were performed in all patients. Significantly smaller number of patients with serious poisoning was observed in group II-B. Patient's age did not correlate with the degree of poisoning, but significant correlation was found between preexisting disease, ingested dose and the time elapsed before the treatment started. Analysis of pharmacological properties showed that membrane stabilizing activity and lipophilicity of the drug might be the important determinants of the toxicity, while the role of cardioselectivity was lost in an overdose.", 
    "116": "Chronic human heart failure is characterized by abnormalities in beta-adrenergic receptor (betaAR) signaling, including increased levels of betaAR kinase 1 (betaARK1), which seems critical to the pathogenesis of the disease. To determine whether inhibition of betaARK1 is sufficient to rescue a model of severe heart failure, we mated transgenic mice overexpressing a peptide inhibitor of betaARK1 (betaARKct) with transgenic mice overexpressing the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-binding protein, calsequestrin (CSQ). CSQ mice have a severe cardiomyopathy and markedly shortened survival (9 +/- 1 weeks). In contrast, CSQ/betaARKct mice exhibited a significant increase in mean survival age (15 +/- 1 weeks; P < 0.0001) and showed less cardiac dilation, and cardiac function was significantly improved (CSQ vs. CSQ/betaARKct, left ventricular end diastolic dimension 5.60 +/- 0.17 mm vs. 4.19 +/- 0.09 mm, P < 0.005; % fractional shortening, 15 +/- 2 vs. 36 +/- 2, P < 0.005). The enhancement of the survival rate in CSQ/betaARKct mice was substantially potentiated by chronic treatment with the betaAR antagonist metoprolol (CSQ/betaARKct nontreated vs. CSQ/betaARKct metoprolol treated, 15 +/- 1 weeks vs. 25 +/- 2 weeks, P < 0.0001). Thus, overexpression of the betaARKct resulted in a marked prolongation in survival and improved cardiac function in a mouse model of severe cardiomyopathy that can be potentiated with beta-blocker therapy. These data demonstrate a significant synergy between an established heart-failure treatment and the strategy of betaARK1 inhibition.",

Furthermore, bile acids have been proposed as a causative factor for hepatic cardiomyopathy. Hepatic tissue concentrations of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) during cholestasis are greater than those of other toxic bile acids. In the presence of calcium and phosphate, CDCA induced the permeability transition pore (PTP) in freshly isolated rat liver mitochondria. In this study, we evaluated the effects of carvedilol, a multirole cardioprotective compound, on CDCA-induced PTP. Mitochondrial membrane potential, osmotic swelling, and calcium fluxes were monitored. CDCA-induced PTP, characterized by membrane depolarization, release of matrix calcium, and osmotic swelling, was prevented by carvedilol. Under the same conditions, its hydroxylated analog BM-910228 did not reveal any protective effect. This finding reinforces carvedilol's therapeutic interest, because it may potentially prevent mitochondrial dysfunction associated with cardiomyopathy in the pathophysiology of cholestatic liver disease",

The correlation between log P and the retention factor extrapolated to a mobile phase free of micelles and organic modifier was investigated. The use of an interpolated retention factor or the retention factor for specific individual experimental mobile phases was however advantageous since the retention factors of all beta-blocking agents were measurable in the selected mobile phases.

    "131": "We assessed the sympatho-vagal activities of the heart after administration of capsaicin by measuring the power spectral analysis in rats. There were major two frequency components of heart rate variability, which we defined as high (1.0 Hz <, HF) and low (LF, < 1.0 Hz) frequency components. Vagal blockade by atropine abolished the high frequency component, and lowered the amplitude of the low frequency component. On the other hand, under conditions of sympathetic blockade by propranolol, the low frequency component was reduced. Combined vagal and sympathetic blockade abolished all heart rate fluctuations. We analyzed the low and high frequency components by integrating the spectrum for the respective band width. The rats administered capsaicin had a higher heart rate and sympathetic nervous system index (LF/HF) than the control group of rats. These results suggest that power spectral analysis is an effective and noninvasive method for detecting subtle changes in autonomic activity in response to the intake of foods or drugs.", 
    "132": "The clinical anti-anginal effectiveness of ranolazine is currently being evaluated. However, the mechanism of its anti-ischaemic action is still unclear. The aim of this work was to establish whether ranolazine exerts functional beta-adrenoceptor antagonist activity in the rat cardiovascular system. Radioligand binding studies were performed in rat hearts and guinea-pig lungs for beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptor affinity, respectively. Ranolazine had micromolar affinity for both beta,- and beta2-adrenoceptors (pKi5.8 and 6.3, respectively). Developed tension was measured in isolated rat left atria (electrically driven at 4 Hz) and cumulative concentration/response curves to (+/-)isoprenaline (0.01-1,000 nM) constructed. Ranolazine (0.32-10 microM) surmountably but weakly antagonised isoprenaline-induced positive inotropic responses, with an apparent pA2 of 5.85 (5.69-6.00) and a slope of -0.74 (-0.70 to -0.77). In bivagotomised, atropinised pithed rats, ranolazine per se evoked marked bradycardia at doses above 10 mg/kg i.v. (maximum variation at 80 mg/kg -125+/-15 bpm, n=6, P<0.001) by a mechanism apparently unrelated to blockade of beta1- or beta2-adrenoceptors. Cumulative incremental doses of (+/-)isoprenaline (0.63 ng/kg to 0.16 mg/kg i.v.) administered to pithed rats induced concomitant depressor and chronotropic responses. Animals received either vehicle (saline 0.9% i.v., n=12), atenolol (0.04-2.5 mg/kg i.v., n=6 per dose), ICI 118551 (0.01-0.63 mg/kg i.v., n=6 or 7 per dose), (+/-)propranolol (0.01-0.63 mg/kg i.v., n=6 per dose) or ranolazine (2.5-80 mg/kg i.v., n=6 or 7 per dose) 10 min prior to isoprenaline. Ranolazine dose-dependently and competitively antagonised isoprenaline-induced decreases in diastolic arterial pressure (DAP, dose ratio 12.2 with 80 mg/kg ranolazine) and increases in heart rate (HR, dose ratio 20.3 with 80 mg/kg ranolazine). Collectively, these results demonstrate that ranolazine behaves as a weak beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist in the rat cardiovascular system.", 
    "133": "The arylalkylamine, pindolol, may potentiate the clinical actions of antidepressant agents. Although it is thought to act via blockade of 5-HT1A autoreceptors, its efficacy at these sites remains controversial. Herein, we evaluated the actions of pindolol at 5-HT1A autoreceptors and specific populations of postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors employing [35S]GTPgammaS autoradiography, a measure of receptor-mediated G-protein activation. Both 8-OH-DPAT (1 microM) and 5-HT (10 microM) elicited a pronounced increase in [35S]GTPyS binding in the dorsal raphe nucleus, which contains serotonergic cell bodies bearing 5-HT1A autoreceptors. Pindolol abolished their actions. In the dentate gyrus, lateral septum and entorhinal cortex, structures enriched in postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors, 8-OH-DPAT (1 microM) and 5-HT (10 microM) also elicited a marked increase in [35S]GTPgammaS binding which was likewise blocked by pindolol. The antagonism of 5-HT-induced [35S]GTPgammaS labelling in the dentate gyrus was shown to be concentration-dependent, yielding a pIC50 of 5.82. Pindolol did not, itself, affect [35S]GTPgammaS binding in any brain region examined. In conclusion, these data suggest that, as characterised by [35S]GTPgammaS autoradiography, and compared with 5-HT and 8-OH-DPAT, pindolol possesses low efficacy at both pre- and postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors.", 
    "134": "Hypertension is another predictor of erectile dysfunction (ED). This is further evidence supporting a link between the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic disease and ED. In one study (TOMHS) involving hypertensive patients, the incidence of ED was 14.4%. The drugs used to treat hypertension may cause ED. However, there is little trial-based evidence to indicate which drugs are more likely to cause this side effect. In general, thiazide diuretics and beta-blockers seem to cause ED more often. In contrast, the alpha-blocker, doxazosin, has not been associated with an increased incidence of ED as a side effect. Doxazosin also improves urinary flow in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). This condition is common in elderly men as is hypertension and ED. Therefore, doxazosin may present a special advantage among this group of patients. This alpha-blocker would also be a good choice in patients with impaired glucose tolerance/diabetes because it improves insulin sensitivity. Moreover, ED and hypertension are more prevalent among diabetics. On a more speculative note, doxazosin may potentiate the therapeutic impact of specific treatments for ED.", 
    "135": "Underlying causes and precipitating causes of congestive heart failure (CHF) should be treated when possible. Older persons with CHF and normal left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction should have maintenance of sinus rhythm, treatment of hypertension and myocardial ischemia, slowing of the ventricular rate below 90 beats/minute, and reduction of salt overload. First-line drug treatment in the management of these persons is the use of loop diuretics combined with beta blockers as tolerated. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors should be administered if CHF persists despite diuretics and beta blockers. If persons are unable to tolerate ACE inhibitors because of cough, rash, or altered taste sensation, angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists should be given. If CHF persists despite diuretics, beta blockers, and ACE inhibitors or the person is unable to tolerate beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists, isosorbide dinitrate plus hydralazine should be administered. Calcium channel blockers should be used if CHF persists despite administration of diuretics and the person is unable to tolerate beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists, and isosorbide dinitrate plus hydralazine. Digoxin, beta blockers, verapamil, and diltiazem may be used to slow a rapid ventricular rate in persons with supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. Digoxin should not be used in persons with CHF in sinus rhythm with normal LV ejection fraction.", 
    "136": "The temperature dependence of steady-state kinetics has been studied with horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (HLADH) using protonated and deuterated benzyl alcohol as substrates in methanol/water mixtures between +3 and -50 degrees C. Additionally, the competitive isotope effects, k(H)/k(T) and k(D)/k(T), were measured. The studies indicate increasing kinetic complexity for wild-type HLADH at subzero temperatures. Consistent with earlier findings at 25 degrees C [Bahnson et al. (1993) Biochemistry 31, 5503], the F93W mutant shows much less kinetic complexity than the wild-type enzyme between 3 and -35 degrees C. An analysis of noncompetitive deuterium isotope effects and competitive tritium isotope effects leads to the conclusion that the reaction of F93W involves substantial hydrogen tunneling down to -35 degrees C. The effect of methanol on kinetic properties for the F93W mutant was analyzed, showing a dependence of competitive KIEs on the NAD(+) concentration. This indicates a more random bi--bi kinetic mechanism, in comparison to an ordered bi-bi kinetic mechanism in water. Although MeOH also affects the magnitude of the reaction rates and, to some extent, the observed KIEs, the ratio of ln k(H)/k(T) to ln k(D)/k(T) for primary isotope effects has not changed in methanol, and we conclude little or no change in kinetic complexity. Importantly, the degree of tunneling, as shown from the relationship between the secondary k(H)/k(T) and k(D)/k(T) values, is the same in water and MeOH/water mixtures, implicating similar trajectories for H transfer in both solvents. In a recent study of a thermophilic alcohol dehydrogenase [Kohen et al. (1999) Nature 399, 496], it was shown that decreases in temperatures below a transition temperature lead to decreased tunneling. This arises because of a change in protein dynamics below a break point in enzyme activity [Kohen et al. (2000) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 122, 10738-10739]. For the mesophilic HLADH described herein, an opposite trend is observed in which tunneling increases at subzero temperatures. These differences are attributed to inherent differences in tunneling probabilities between 0 and 100 degrees C vs subzero temperatures, as opposed to fundamental differences in protein structure for enzymes from mesophilic vs thermophilic sources. We propose that future investigations of the relationship between protein flexibility and hydrogen tunneling are best approached using enzymes from thermophilic sources.", 
    "137": "Hospital admission for congestive heart failure is extremely common and quite expensive, although it is frequently preventable. New drugs and therapies have been reported to reduce admissions, decrease morbidity and mortality, and improve the quality of life for these patients. Patients with an ejection fraction less than 40 percent (decreased systolic function) should be treated with medication to improve symptoms and prevent progression of heart failure. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are a mainstay of treatment in patients who can tolerate them; in patients who cannot take these drugs, angiotensin II receptor blocking agents offer an alternative. Patients with New York Heart Association class II or III heart failure should also receive a beta blocker (metoprolol, carvedilol or bisoprolol). Recent research has shown that treatment with spironolactone improves mortality and hospital readmission rates. An exercise program should also be recommended for all patients with heart failure unless their condition is unstable.",

    "139": "To elucidate microscopic mechanisms underlying the modulation of cardiac excitation-contraction (EC) coupling by beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) stimulation, we examined local Ca(2+) release function, ie, Ca(2+) spikes at individual transverse tubule-sarcoplasmic reticulum (T-SR) junctions, using confocal microscopy and our recently developed technique for release flux measurement. beta-AR stimulation by norepinephrine plus an alpha(1)-adrenergic blocker, prazosin, increased the amplitude of SR Ca(2+) release flux (J(SR)), its running integral (integralJ(SR)), and L-type Ca(2+) channel current (I(Ca)), and it shifted their bell-shaped voltage dependence leftward by approximately 10 mV, with the relative effects ranking I(Ca)> J(SR)>integralJ(SR). Confocal imaging revealed that the bell-shaped voltage dependence of SR Ca(2+) release is attributable to a graded recruitment of T-SR junctions as well as to changes in Ca(2+) spike amplitudes. beta-AR stimulation increased the fractional T-SR junctions that fired Ca(2+) spikes and augmented Ca(2+) spike amplitudes, without altering the SR Ca(2+) load, suggesting that more release units were activated synchronously among and within T-SR junctions. Moreover, beta-AR stimulation decreased the latency and temporal dispersion of Ca(2+) spike occurrence at a given voltage, delivering most of the Ca(2+) at the onset of depolarization rather than spreading it out throughout depolarization. Because the synchrony of Ca(2+) spikes affects Ca(2+) delivery per unit of time to contractile myofilaments, and because the myofilaments display a steep Ca(2+) dependence, our data suggest that synchronization of SR Ca(2+) release represents a heretofore unappreciated mechanism of beta-AR modulation of cardiac inotropy.", 
    "140": "Pretargeting techniques that are based on the sequential administrations of bispecific antitumor/antimetal chelate antibodies (BS-MAbs), a blocker to saturate the anti-chelate binding sites of the BS-MAb still present in the circulation, and the radiolabeled chelate are suitable to increase tumor-to-normal tissue contrasts and enable positron emission tomography (PET) as an imaging method. As demonstrated in the nude mouse model, a combination of pretargeted immunoscintigraphy and PET markedly improved the detection of tumor xenografts. With the presented preliminary clinical trial, we attempted to assess the efficacy of pretargeting and PET for breast cancer localization in patients. The BS-MAb used for pretargeting was synthesized from the F(ab')(2) fragments of the anti-MUC1 MAb 12H12, which reacts with the vast majority of breast tumors, and the F(ab') fragments of an anti-gallium (Ga) chelate MAb via a mixed functional chemical linker. For labeling of the Ga-chelate, we used the short-lived positron emitter Ga-68 (t(1/2), 68 min; beta(+), 88%). The dose and time schedule of pretargeting was deduced from previous animal experiments. Ten patients with biopsy-proven, primary breast carcinoma were infused with 10 mg of the BS-MAB: Eighteen h later, they received i.v. injections of 10.7 mg of a blocker and, 15 min later, 9.6 microg of the Ga chelate labeled with 230-300 MBq of (68)GA: PET imaging was started 60-90 min after injection of the (68)Ga chelate. Average tumor-to-blood and tumor:normal breast tissue ratios were 0.9 and 3.0 at 1 h postinjection. Tumor uptake amounted to approximately 0.003% iD/g corresponding to a standard uptake value of approximately 2. Blood clearance of the (68)Ga chelate showed a t(1/2) beta of approximately 100 min. Fourteen of 17 known lesions, averaging 25 +/- 16 mm in size, were clearly visualized as foci of increased activity with PET. No false-positive but three false-negative readings were obtained. An enhanced, bilateral activity uptake in the whole breast parenchyma, found in 4 of the 10 patients, compromised the recognition of these tumor sites. Although the shedding of the MUC1 antigen and the comparatively low tumor affinity of the BS-MAb, common to all anti-mucin MAbs, proved not to be optimal for increasing tumor:tissue ratios with a pretargeting technique, PET imaging offered better sensitivity for the detection of breast cancer at low tumor contrasts than conventional immunoscintigraphy. This could be demonstrated by the clear visualization of tumor sites 10 mm in size, which contrasted only by a factor of 2 from surrounding normal breast tissue.", 
    "141": "1. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of the beta adrenergic agonist terbutaline on NGF increase caused by allergic inflammation in rats. 2. Intraplantar antigen injection in sensitized rats increased paw volume and stimulated NGF biosynthesis in the skin of the injected paw as determined 3 and 6 h after injection. Treatment of rats with terbutaline (0.1 - 0.3 mg kg(-1), s.c.) had no significant effect on the NGF concentration in non-inflamed skin, but reduced oedema, and at 0.3 mg kg(-1) also NGF mRNA and immunoreactive NGF in the skin of the inflamed paw in a propranolol-reversible manner. In carrageenan-induced inflammation, terbutaline did not significantly reduce the inflammation-induced increase of NGF in paw skin. 3. Exposure of sensitized rats to aerosolized antigen (twice, 24 h interval) increased protein content, eosinophil leukocytes, and immunoreactive NGF in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL, obtained 16 h after the second antigen exposure). Treatment of rats with terbutaline (0.3 mg kg(-1), s.c. 30 min before the second antigen challenge) suppressed antigen-induced elevation of protein and eosinophil leukocytes, and reduced the concentration of NGF in BAL to values similar to those found in non-sensitized rats. 4. The present results demonstrate anti-allergic properties of terbutaline in rats that were accompanied by a marked reduction of antigen-induced NGF increase in skin and BAL, respectively. These results are compatible with the assumption that terbutaline primarily suppressed the immune response to antigen thereby attenuating the release of vasoactive mediators and the stimulation of NGF biosynthesis.", 
    "142": "1. The functional coupling of beta(2)-adrenoceptors (beta(2)-ARs) to murine L-type Ca(2+) current (I(Ca(L))) was investigated with two different approaches. The beta(2)-AR signalling cascade was activated either with the beta(2)-AR selective agonist zinterol (myocytes from wild-type mice), or by spontaneously active, unoccupied beta(2)-ARs (myocytes from TG4 mice with 435 fold overexpression of human beta(2)-ARs). Ca(2+) and Ba(2+) currents were recorded in the whole-cell and cell-attached configuration of the patch-clamp technique, respectively. 2. Zinterol (10 microM) significantly increased I(Ca(L)) amplitude of wild-type myocytes by 19+/-5%, and this effect was markedly enhanced after inactivation of Gi-proteins with pertussis-toxin (PTX; 76+/-13% increase). However, the effect of zinterol was entirely mediated by the beta(1)-AR subtype, since it was blocked by the beta(1)-AR selective antagonist CGP 20712A (300 nM). The beta(2)-AR selective antagonist ICI 118,551 (50 nM) did not affect the response of I(Ca(L)) to zinterol. 3. In myocytes with beta(2)-AR overexpression I(Ca(L)) was not stimulated by the activated signalling cascade. On the contrary, I(Ca(L)) was lower in TG4 myocytes and a significant reduction of single-channel activity was identified as a reason for the lower whole-cell I(Ca(L)). The beta(2)-AR inverse agonist ICI 118,551 did not further decrease I(Ca(L)). PTX-treatment increased current amplitude to values found in control myocytes. 4. In conclusion, there is no evidence for beta(2)-AR mediated increases of I(Ca(L)) in wild-type mouse ventricular myocytes. Inactivation of Gi-proteins does not unmask beta(2)-AR responses to zinterol, but augments beta(1)-AR mediated increases of I(Ca(L)). In the mouse model of beta(2)-AR overexpression I(Ca(L)) is reduced due to tonic activation of Gi-proteins.", 
    "143": "Experiments were conducted to characterize the effects of acute cold exposure, with and without adrenoceptor blockade, on intrascapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT) and adrenal catecholamine content in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Groups of animals with indwelling temperature transmitters were tested following treatment with saline, the alpha-adrenoceptor blocker phentolamine, the beta-adrenoceptor blocker propranolol, combined blockade with phentolamine plus propranolol, and the ganglionic blocker chlorisondamine. IBAT norepinephrine (NE) content was not affected in animals tested at 22 degrees C, but was reduced in 4 degrees C-exposed animals treated with phentolamine (-57%), phentolamine plus propranolol (-97%), and chlorisondamine (-42%). Adrenal NE and epinephrine (EPI) content were not altered by the treatments at 4 degrees C or 22 degrees C. None of the treatments affected the temperature of animals at 22 degrees C, but significant hypothermia occurred at 4 degrees C after chlorisondamine (-2.3+/-0.3 degrees C) and the combination of phentolamine and propranolol (-1.5+/-0.4 degrees C). These results suggest that cold exposure alone did not affect IBAT NE content, but when cold exposure was combined with adrenoceptor blockade, the sympathetic activation was sufficient to cause a reduction in IBAT NE content. In addition, alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor-mediated mechanisms contribute to the maintenance of core temperature. However, both alpha- and beta-receptor mechanisms had to be interrupted before a deficit in body temperature was detected.", 
    "144": "Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the porcine beta2-adrenergic receptor (betaAR) were used to determine the binding kinetics of agonists and antagonists by competitive displacement of the radioligand [125I]iodocyanopindolol. Several purported agonists, including isoproterenol, epinephrine, norepinephine, dobutamine, salbutamol, and terbutaline, exhibited dual-affinity displacement curves, which is characteristic of agonist binding to betaAR. In each case, the addition of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) eliminated the high-affinity state and resulted in a one-site displacement curve. All of the antagonists modeled to only one site in the presence or absence of GTP. Several ligands, including ones used to promote animal growth (clenbuterol, L-644,969, and ractopamine) and the beta3AR-selective agonist BRL 37344 modeled to only one site, suggesting that these ligands would not be full agonists at the porcine beta2AR (pbeta2AR). Most of the tested ligands exhibited binding affinities that were similar to published values for the beta2AR from other species. However, several exceptions were observed. The BRL 37344 ligand bound the pbeta2AR with a 10-fold higher affinity than the human beta2AR, and the Kd of this was similar to Kd values reported for the human and rat beta3AR. The Kd of the pbeta2AR for ICI 118,551 was 50-fold higher than that for the beta2AR from rats and humans. For both BRL 37344 and ICI 118,551 the subtype-selective character of these ligands was different in the pig compared with the human and rat. These data demonstrate the value of using species-specific betaAR for selection of agonists and antagonists. Further, these data support the growing evidence that few ligands are full agonists for pbetaAR and that binding data may be useful for identifying ligands with full agonist potential.", 
    "145": "The aim of this study was to compare the effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and alphabeta blocker in combination with a calcium antagonist on the progression of renal function and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in patients with chronic renal insufficiency and hypertension. The 65 subjects in this study were recruited from a cohort of 316 patients. The main criteria for inclusion were echocardiographic diagnosis of LVH (posterior wall thickness >12 mm) and serum creatinine of more than 1.5 mg/dl. Antihypertensive treatments were switched to the combination of amlodipine at a dose of 5 mg and benazepril at a dose of 2.5 mg daily or the combination of amlodipine at a dose of 5 mg and arotinolol at a dose of 20 mg daily at random irrespective of whether or not patients had been previously treated. The follow-up period was 2 years. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly reduced from 150/90 +/- 15/11 mmHg to 130/75 +/- 11/9 mmHg (ACE) and the levels of serum creatinine were increased significantly from 1.8 +/- 0.3 to 2.0 +/- 0.4 mg/dl (ACE). In the alphabeta-blocker group, these two values were similar and no significant changes were found. PWT was decreased from 14.2 +/- 0.6 to 12.9 +/- 0.3 cm in alphabeta blocker but was not significantly decreased in the ACE inhibitor group. In conclusion, combination therapy with a calcium antagonist and abeta blocker might be effective treatment for hypertensive patients with chronic renal insufficiency and left ventricular hypertrophy.", 
    "146": "The sympathetic nervous system has been indicated to influence the severity of inflammatory disease including rheumatoid arthritis. In this study, we elucidated the effects of catecholamine on the synovial cell populations. Stimulation with epinephrine or norepinephrine for 1-2 weeks dose- and time-dependently increased the number of synovial A (macrophage-like) cells but decreased that of B (fibroblast-like) cells. These responses in A and B cells were inhibited by the alpha2-antagonist yohimbine, the G-protein inactivator pertussis toxin and the phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor U-73122. Furthermore, the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor calphostin C and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase inhibitors PD98059 and wortmannin also abolished the norepinephrine effects on A and B cell numbers. In A cells cloned from an A and B cell mixture, norepinephrine also increased the cell number. In immunoblotting and immunocytostaining analyses, among the PKC isozymes, only PKC betaII immunoreactivity was observed in the cytoplasm of unstimulated A and B cells. After alpha2-adrenoceptor stimulation, PKC betaII immunoreactivity increased in the plasma membranes of both A and B cells with decreases in the cytoplasm. These findings indicated that alpha2-adrenoceptor stimulation of type A and B synoviocytes produced an increase and a decrease in the respective cell number, probably through Gi-coupled PLC activation and the resulting stimulation of the PKC betaII/MAP kinase.", 
    "147": "Cardiovascular responses during a graded lower body negative pressure (LBNP) protocol were compared before and after atropine and propranolol administration to test the hypothesis that both sympathetic and parasympathetic control of cardio-acceleration are associated with syncopal predisposition to orthostatic stress in healthy subjects. Eleven men were categorized into two groups having high (HT, N = 6) or low (LT, N = 5) tolerance based on their total time before the onset of presyncopal symptoms. HT and LT groups were similar in physical characteristics, fitness, and baseline cardiovascular measurements. Atropine treatment had no effect on LBNP tolerance or mean arterial pressure at presyncope, despite an atropine-induced increase in heart rate. Propranolol treatment reduced (p<0.05) LBNP tolerance in both groups. Diminished LBNP tolerance after propranolol administration was associated with reductions in cardiac output, whereas increase in systemic peripheral resistance from baseline to presyncope was unaffected by propranolol. Reduction in cardiac output and LBNP tolerance after beta blockade reflected a chronotropic effect because lower LBNP tolerance for the HT (-50%) and LT (-39%) groups was associated with dramatic reductions (p <0.05) in the magnitude of LBNP-induced tachycardia without significant effects on stroke volume at presyncope. Absence of an atropine-induced difference in cardiac output and systemic peripheral resistance between HT and LT groups failed to support the notion that cardiac vagal withdrawal represents a predominant mechanism that could account for differences in orthostatic tolerance. Because a reduction in LBNP tolerance in both HT and LT groups after propranolol treatment was most closely associated with reduced tachycardia, the data suggest that a primary autonomically mediated mechanism for maintenance of mean arterial pressure and orthostatic tolerance in healthy subjects is beta adrenergic-induced tachycardia.", 
    "148": "Beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists are currently used as first-line therapy in the treatment of hypertension and angina pectoris, but are contraindicated or used with caution in patients with bronchospastic syndromes. In this study we evaluated in vivo the effects of nebivolol on airway responsiveness compared to atenolol, pindolol, and propranolol. In New Zealand white rabbits total lung resistance (R(L)) and dynamic compliance (Cdyn) were calculated. In acute protocol, the animals were intravenously injected with the beta-blockers at different doses while in the chronic protocol, animals were daily injected for 30 days. Furthermore, the changes induced by beta-blockers (higher doses) in R(L) and Cdyn after a treatment with salbutamol were calculated. In acute treatment, airway responsiveness to histamine was not modified by nebivolol at any dosage, but increased significantly following the exposure to the higher doses of the other beta-blockers. In chronic treatment, the thirty-day exposure to nebivolol, did not modify the airway responsiveness to histamine, whereas the other beta-blockers significantly increased airway responsiveness. Moreover, nebivolol affected the salbutamol-induced relaxation less markedly than other beta-blockers do. These data demonstrate that nebivolol respect the other beta-blockers used in this study, does not significantly affect the airway responsiveness, therefore it could be used in patients with both cardiovascular and bronchial diseases more safely than other beta-blockers drugs.", 
    "149": "It has been conclusively established that treatment of hypertension in patients with type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus will significantly reduce the incidence of stroke, heart failure and progression of diabetic complications. Beta-blockers are effective antihypertensive agents which, in long term studies, have proven beneficial in reducing important clinical end-points. However nonselective beta-blockers may have a negative effect on lipid profiles and contribute to hypoglycaemic unawareness, thus preventing their use in some patients with diabetes mellitus. The development of newer and more selective beta-blockers has overcome many of these problems. In addition, some of the newer agents have novel properties such as release of nitric oxide, which theoretically would make them more attractive in patients with diabetes mellitus. Overall, the adverse metabolic effects of beta-blockers do not appear to be important in clinical practice and these agents should no longer be contraindicated in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Their proven cardiovascular benefits would seem to easily tip the balance in favour of their use.",

Cumulative doses of 17-beta-estradiol (0.3 micromol/L to 0.1 mmol/L) induced concentration-dependent relaxation that was larger in basilar than carotid artery, in male than female basilar artery, and in KCl-precontracted than UTP-precontracted male basilar artery. Endothelium removal did not modify relaxation induced by 17-beta-estradiol in basilar artery, whereas relaxation induced by acetylcholine (1 nmol/L to 0.1 mmol/L) was almost abolished. Neither the estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780 (1 micromol/L), nor the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (1 micromol/L) affected 17-beta-estradiol-induced relaxations. Relaxations induced by the K(+) channel openers NS1619 and pinacidil in the same concentration range were greater and lower, respectively, when compared with relaxation to 17-beta-estradiol, which was not significantly modified by incubation with the K(+) channel blockers charybdotoxin (1 nmol/L and 0.1 micromol/L) or glibenclamide (10 nmol/L and 1 micromol/L). Preincubation with 17-beta-estradiol (3 to 100 micromol/L) produced concentration-dependent inhibition of CaCl(2)-induced contraction, with less potency than the Ca(2+) entry blocker nicardipine (0.01 to 10 nmol/L). The authors conclude that 17-beta-estradiol induces endothelium-independent relaxation of cerebral arteries with tissue and gender selectivity. The relaxant effect is because of inhibition of extracellular Ca(2+) influx to vascular smooth muscle, but activation of estrogen receptors, protein synthesis, or K(+) efflux are not involved. Relatively high pharmacologic concentrations of 17-beta-estradiol causing relaxation preclude acute vascular effects of physiologic circulating levels on the cerebral circulation.", 
    "159": "Carvedilol is a beta-blocker with ancillary properties. Pilot clinical studies with carvedilol, added to the standard therapy of digoxin, diuretics and ACE inhibitors, showed beneficial effects in mild, moderate and severe heart failure. Patients consistently showed improvement in LV ejection fraction and NYHA functional class. Subsequently large clinical trials showed decreased morbidity and mortality with carvedilol in mild and moderate and more recently, severe heart failure. However, there is little or no improvement in exercise tolerance with carvedilol. The beneficial effects of carvedilol in heart failure are associated with cardiac remodelling. Metoprolol and bisoprolol are selective beta(1)-blockers without ancillary properties. Early studies showed benefits with metoprolol and bisoprolol in heart failure. Large clinical trials established that metoprolol and bisoprolol decreased mortality and morbidity in heart failure. In contrast no benefit has been shown with celiprolol, a selective beta(1)-blocker and beta(2)-stimulant in heart failure. There is a debate as to whether the ancillary properties of carvedilol contribute to its beneficial effect in heart failure, making it a better drug to use than metoprolol. Short-term studies suggested that carvedilol and metoprolol were equivalent in heart failure but short-term is probably not an appropriate way to compare the drugs. A recent long-term study and study in poor responders to metoprolol, suggest that carvedilol may be better than metoprolol in heart failure.", 
    "160": "WP-934 is a newly developed reversible thermo-setting in situ gelling ophthalmic solution containing timolol. We investigated the effects of WP-934 on the respiratory and cardiovascular systems in guinea pigs and compared them with those of the conventional ophthalmic solution of timolol. At 30 min after instillation of timolol 0.5%, the airway responsiveness to histamine was 4 times higher, and that to acetylcholine was 2.5 times higher, than that before instillation. At 30 min after instillation of WP-934 0.5%, in contrast, the increase in responsiveness to each drug was about half that seen with the conventional solution. Topical instillation of timolol 0.5% weakened the effects of salbutamol and aminophylline on bronchodilatation, while that of WP-934 0.5% had no effect on aminophylline-induced bronchodilatation and a weaker effect on salbutamol-induced bronchodilatation. Topical instillation of timolol 0.5% and WP-934 0.5% failed to show a significant effect on blood pressure but caused a 10 to 20% decrease in heart rate for at least 120 min after instillation. WP-934 appears to have less respiratory adverse effects than timolol, mainly due to its longer retention on the ocular surface and a consequent decrease in systemic absorption.", 
    "161": "The purpose of this study was to determine glucocorticoid modulation of ocular pressure to timolol applied topically to rabbit eyes that were pretreated with dexamethasone. Rabbits were pretreated with five applications of topical 0.007% of dexamethasone (0.01% dexamethasone phosphate) or saline drops, administered at ten min intervals. The eyes were then treated with timolol maleate drops at concentrations of free base of 0.00007%, 0.0007%, 0.007% and 0.07%. An additional group of rabbits received dexamethasone pre-treatment only. Intraocular pressure was measured for the next four hr. Enhanced lowering of intraocular pressure was observed with dexamethasone pretreatment. Rabbits receiving the smaller dose of timolol had the least decrease in pressure. The most significant decreases in pressures occurred at 45 min after the administration of timolol with an average difference of 4.8 mm Hg between the timolol- and dexamethasone/timolol-treated eyes for the three largest concentrations of timolol. This synergism between glucocorticoids and beta-adrenergic blockers in lowering IOP may be potentially useful in the therapy of ocular hypertension and glaucoma.", 
    "162": "We investigated the intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering potential of latanoprost in patients with normal-tension glaucoma (NTG) or primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). This prospective study included 59 NTG and 20 POAG patients treated with the following four dosing regimens of latanoprost: patients on no previous medication received latanoprost as initial therapy (Group 1, n=31), patients on beta-blocker therapy received latanoprost as adjunctive therapy (Group II, n=9), patients on unoprostone monotherapy were switched to latanoprost monotherapy (Group III, n=14), and patients previously on dual therapy with isopropyl unoprostone and beta-blocker were switched to a combined treatment of latanoprost and beta-blocker (Group IV, n=25). IOP significantly decreased 8 weeks after initiation of latanoprost therapy by 19.9% in Group I, 20.5% in Group II, 16.6% in Group III, and 12.2% in Group IV. In Groups I and II, there was a significant positive correlation between the magnitude of IOP reduction induced by latanoprost and the IOP level before latanoprost therapy. The IOP level before latanoprost therapy is a contributing factor in the IOP-lowering efficacy of latanoprost. Latanoprost is more effective in lowering IOP than isopropyl unoprostone.", 
    "163": "The objective of this study was to develop non-invasive spectroscopic methods to quantify the partition coefficients of two beta-blockers, atenolol and nadolol, in aqueous solutions of bile salt micelles and to assess the effect of lecithin on the partition coefficients of amphiphilic drugs in mixed bile salt/lecithin micelles, which were used as a simple model for the naturally occurring mixed micelles in the gastrointestinal tract. The partition coefficients (Kp) at 25.0 +/- 0.1degreesC and at 0.1 M NaCl ionic strength were determined by spectrofluorimetry and by derivative spectrophotometry, by fitting equations that relate molar extinction coefficients and relative fluorescence intensities to the partition constant Kp. Drug partition was controlled by the: (i) drug properties, with the more soluble drug in water (atenolol) exhibiting smaller values of Kp, and with both drugs interacting more extensively in the protonated form; and by (ii) the bile salt monomers, with the dihydroxylic salts producing larger values of Kp for the beta-blockers, and with glycine conjugation of the bile acid increasing the values of Kp for the beta-blockers. Addition of lecithin to bile salt micelles decreases the values of Kp of the beta-blockers. Mixed micelles incorporate hydrophobic compounds due to their large size and the fluidity of their core, but amphiphilic drugs, for which the interactions are predominantly polar/electrostatic, are poorly incorporated in mixed micelles of bile salts/lecithin."
