    "5": "Correct identification of a chemical substance in environmental samples based only on accurate mass measurements can be difficult especially for molecules > 300 Da. Here is presented the application of spectral accuracy, a tool for the comparison of isotope patterns toward molecular formula generation, as a complementary technique to assist in the identification process of emerging organic contaminants and their transformation products in surface water. A set of nine emerging contaminants (five antibiotics, an herbicide, a beta-blocker, an antidepressant and an antineoplastic) frequently found in surface water were spiked in methanol and surface water extracts at two different concentrations (80 and 300 \u03bcg L(-1)). They were then injected into three different mass analyzers (triple quadrupole, quadrupole-time-of-fight and quadrupole-orbitrap) to study the impact of matrix composition, analyte concentration and mass resolution on the correct identification of molecular formulas using spectral accuracy. High spectral accuracy and ranking of the correct molecular formula were in many cases compound-specific due principally to conditions affecting signal intensity such as matrix effects and concentration. However, in general, results showed that higher concentrations and higher resolutions favoured ranking the correct formula in the top 10. Using spectral accuracy and mass accuracy it was possible to reduce the number of possible molecular formulas for emerging organic contaminants of relative high molecular mass (e.g. between 400 and 900 Da) to less than 10 and in some cases, it was possible to unambiguously assign one specific molecular formula to confirm an isotopic pattern. This study confirmed that spectral accuracy can be used as a complementary diagnostic technique to improve confidence levels for the identification of organic contaminants under environmental conditions.", 
    "6": "Purpose: Propranolol is the most widely used treatment for cardiovascular diseases. Dosage range in our patients is usually less than the amount mentioned in references. The aim of the present study was to clarify whether pharmacokinetic differences are able to justify the need for the fewer doses in our patients or not. Methods: Twenty healthy volunteers (10 male) at heart center of Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences were studied. Samples of blood were collected before a single oral dose (40 mg) of Propranolol. Blood samples were taken up to 9 hours after dose. Total plasma concentration of Propranolol was measured by HPLC. Population Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using population pharmacokinetics modeling software P-Pharm. Results: The mean value for oral plasma clearance (CL/F) was 126.59 ml/hr. The corresponding values for apparent volume of distribution (V/F), t1/2 beta, maximum blood concentration (C max), and time to reach the maximum blood concentration (T max) were 334.12 Lit, 1.98 hr, 40.25 ng/ml, and 1.68 hr, respectively. The observed mean values of V/F of propranolol in the present study were comparable with those reported in the literature. However, the mean values of CL/F of propranolol in current study was significantly higher than those reported in other population (P-value<0.001). Conclusion: This study has confirmed that the pharmacokinetic differences are not able to justify over-responsiveness of Iranian population to propranolol. Pharmacodynamic differences in responding to beta blocker drugs by Renin secretion or having a different sensibility to beta receptors might play a role in making our population have a different response to propranolol.", 
    "7": "Severe ventricular arrhythmias are frequent during heart failure; they are a life-threatening condition due to the increased risk of sudden death. Efficient management remains limited in sub-Saharan Africa because of the limited or unavailable medical resources as automated implantable defibrillator (AID). We report the case of a 56-year old patient with non ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with very low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)who underwent AID implantation for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death due to ventricular arrhythmias in 2012. Maintenance therapy combined diuretic, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and anti-vitamin K. In the month of November 2014 the patient had iterative episodes requiring the delivery of electric shocks by the AID, without the sensation of palpitations suggestive of episodes of arrhythmias. Clinical examination is a poor screening test, especially for heart failure. AID detected multiple episodes of tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation justifying antitachycardia pacing (ATP) therapy or the delivery of electric shocks of 15J. The patient was treated with amiodarone and beta blocker. Evolution was favorable at 3-months follow-up. The patients had resumed normal activities, without experiencing new episodes requiring the delivery of electric shocks. This study emphasizes the essential role of anti-arrhythmic drug therapy for severe ventricular arrhythmias, even in the presence of AID.",

We sought to compare the effects of lipophilic and hydrophilic \u03b2-blockers on mortality and cardiovascular outcomes by conducting a comprehensive systematic review and network meta-analysis. MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database were searched for all dates to January 5, 2015, for randomized trials with comparisons between all \u03b2-blockers or between \u03b2-blockers and other antihypertensive agents.

Characteristics of each study and associated clinical outcomes were extracted, including all-cause mortality, coronary heart disease, stroke, and cardiovascular death. Thirteen trials with 90,935 participants were included, focusing on lipophilic \u03b2-blockers (metoprolol, propranolol, and oxprenolol) and a hydrophilic \u03b2-blocker (atenolol). In this review, lipophilic \u03b2-blockers showed a significant reduction for the risk of cardiovascular mortality (odds ratio [OR] 0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI; 0.54-0.97]) compared with hydrophilic \u03b2-blocker, and lipophilic \u03b2-blockers showed decreased trend for the risk of all-cause mortality (OR 0.86, 95% CI [0.72-1.03]) and coronary heart disease (OR 0.88, 95% CI [0.64-1.23]).

    "9": "Dendrimers are synthetic macromolecules with a highly-branched structure and high concentration of surface groups. Among dendrimers, Poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) has received substantial attention as a novel drug carrier and delivery system. Depending on the generation and type of terminal groups, dendrimer toxicity could change and include cytotoxicity. Although PAMAM is water soluble, molecular modeling of the dendrimer-drug complex is considered challenging for exploring the conformational mobility of dendrimers and atomic specific interactions during the dendrimer-drug association. However, conventional protocols for predicting binding affinities have been designed for small protein molecules or protein-protein complexes that can be applied to study the dendrimer-drug association. In this work, we performed docking calculations for a set of 94 previously reported compounds on PAMAM of fourth generation (G4-PAMAM) to select six compounds, cromoglicic acid (CRO) - a mast cell stabilizer, Fusidic acid (FUS) - a bacteriostatic antibiotic, and Methotrexate (MTX) - a chemotherapy agent and immune system suppressant, which have the highest affinities for G4-PAMAM, and Lidocaine (LDC) - used to numb tissue in a specific area and for ventricular tachycardia treatment, Metoprolol (MET) - a \u03b21 receptor blocker, and Pindolol (PIN) - a \u03b2 blocker, which have the lowest affinities for the G4-PAMAM dendrimer, to perform MD simulations combined with the molecular mechanics generalized/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area MMGBSA/MMPBSA approach to investigate the interactions of generating 4 charge-neutral, charge-basic and charge-acid G4-PAMAM dendrimers. In addition, to validate these theoretical G4-PAMAM-drug complexes, the complexes were experimentally conjugated to determine their stability in aqueous solubility studies immediately and over one year. Our results show that among the different commercial drugs, both charged and neutral PAMAM have the most favorable binding free energies for CRO, MTX, and FUS, which appears to be due to a complex counterbalance of electrostatics and van der Waals interactions. These theoretical and aqueous solubility studies supported the high affinity of methotrexate for the G4-PAMAM-drug due to its carboxyl and aryl moieties that favor its accommodation by noncovalent interactions.", 
    "10": "Indoxacarb belongs to a class of insecticides known as oxadiazines and is the first commercialized pyrazoline-type voltage-dependent sodium channel blocker. A moderate level of resistance to indoxacarb has evolved in field populations of Plutella xylostella from Central China. In the present study, cross-resistance, resistance stability and metabolic mechanisms of indoxacarb resistance were investigated in this moth species. A P. xylostella strain with a high level of resistance to indoxacarb was obtained through continuous selection in the laboratory. The strain showed cross-resistance to metaflumizone, beta-cypermethrin and chlorfenapyr, but no resistance to cyantraniliprole, chlorantraniliprole, abamectin, chlorfluazuron, spinosad and diafenthiuron compared with the susceptible strain. Synergism tests revealed that piperonyl butoxide (PBO) (synergistic ratio, SR=7.8) and diethyl maleate (DEF) (SR=3.5) had considerable synergistic effects on indoxacarb toxicity in the resistant strain (F58). Enzyme activity data showed there was an approximate 5.8-fold different in glutathione S-transferase (GST) and a 6.8-fold different in cytochrome P450 monooxygenase between the resistant strain (F58) and susceptible strain, suggesting that the increased activity of these two enzymes is likely the main detoxification mechanism responsible for the species' resistance to indoxacarb. These results will be helpful for insecticide resistance management strategies to delay the development of indoxacarb resistance in fields.", 
    "11": "Gut microbiota can regulate the host energy metabolism; however, the underlying mechanisms that could involve gut microbiota-derived compounds remain to be understood. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the effects of KetoA [10-oxo-12(Z)-octadecenoic acid]-a linoleic acid metabolite produced by gut lactic acid bacteria-on whole-body energy metabolism and found that dietary intake of KetoA could enhance energy expenditure in mice, thereby protecting mice from diet-induced obesity. By using Ca(2+) imaging and whole-cell patch-clamp methods, KetoA was noted to potently activate transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) and enhance noradrenalin turnover in adipose tissues. In addition, KetoA up-regulated genes that are related to brown adipocyte functions, including uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in white adipose tissue (WAT), which was later diminished in the presence of a \u03b2-adrenoreceptor blocker. By using obese and diabetic model KK-Ay mice, we further show that KetoA intake ameliorated obesity-associated metabolic disorders. In the absence of any observed KetoA-induced antiobesity effect or UCP1 up-regulation in TRPV1-deficient mice, we prove that the antiobesity effect of KetoA was caused by TRPV1 activation-mediated browning in WAT. KetoA produced in the gut could therefore be involved in the regulation of host energy metabolism.-Kim, M., Furuzono, T., Yamakuni, K., Li, Y., Kim, Y.-I., Takahashi, H., Ohue-Kitano, R., Jheng, H.-F., Takahashi, N., Kano, Y., Yu, R., Kishino, S., Ogawa, J., Uchida, K., Yamazaki, J., Tominaga, M., Kawada, T., Goto, T. 10-oxo-12(Z)-octadecenoic acid, a linoleic acid metabolite produced by gut lactic acid bacteria, enhances energy metabolism by activation of TRPV1.", 
    "12": "Telmisartan, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (ARB), attenuates hyperglycemia-aggravated vascular inflammation by decreasing I\u03baB kinase \u03b2 (IKK\u03b2) expression in endothelial cells. Because glycogen synthase 3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2) is involved in inflammatory process by regulating nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activity, we investigated whether GSK3\u03b2 mediates telmisartan-ameliorated vascular inflammation in hyperglycemia-treated endothelial cells and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Telmisartan remarkably induced GSK3\u03b2-Ser(9) phosphorylation in hyperglycemia-treated endothelial cells that accompanied a decrease in hyperglycemia-induced NF-\u03baB p65-Ser(536) phosphorylation, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) expression, and THP-1 monocyte adhesion. Ectopic expression of GSK3\u03b2-S9A, a constitutively active mutant of GSK3\u03b2, significantly restored complete telmisartan-inhibited NF-\u03baB p65-Ser(536) phosphorylation, VCAM-1 expression, and THP-1 monocyte adhesion. In addition, it reversed telmisartan-repressed IKK\u03b2 expression. Among the ARB, including losartan and fimasartan, only telmisartan increased GSK3\u03b2-Ser(9) phosphorylation, and telmisartan-induced GSK3\u03b2-Ser(9) phosphorylation remained unchanged by pretreatment with GW9662, a specific and irreversible peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) antagonist. Finally, in the aortas of HFD-fed mice, telmisartan treatment significantly attenuated HFD-induced upregulation of NF-\u03baB p65-Ser(536) phosphorylation, VCAM-1 expression, and IKK\u03b2 expression and downregulation of GSK3\u03b2-Ser(9) phosphorylation. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that telmisartan ameliorates hyperglycemia-exacerbated vascular inflammation, at least in part, by inducing GSK3\u03b2-Ser(9) phosphorylation, which consequently inhibits IKK\u03b2 expression, NF-\u03baB p65-Ser(536) phosphorylation, and VCAM-1 expression in a PPAR\u03b3-independent manner.",

We examined the risk of hip and pelvic fractures during the in-trial period (n\u00a0=\u00a022,180 participants; mean 4.9-year follow-up) and during the post-trial period using national data bases (n\u00a0=\u00a016,622 participants) (mean total follow-up 7.8\u00a0years). During the trial, participants randomized to the thiazide diuretic versus the CCB or the ACEi had a lower risk of fracture on adjusted analyses (HR 0.79 [95% CI, 0.63, 0.98], p\u00a0=\u00a00.04). Risk of fracture was significantly lower in participants randomized to the diuretic as compared to those randomized to the ACEi (HR 0.75 [95% CI, 0.58, 0.98]; p\u00a0=\u00a00.04), but not significantly different compared to the CCB (HR 0.87 [95% CI, 0.71, 1.09]; p\u00a0=\u00a00.17). Over the entire trial and post-trial period of follow-up, the cumulative incidence of fractures was non-significantly lower in participants assigned to the diuretic vs assignment to the ACEi or the CCB (HR 0.87 [0.74-1.03], p\u00a0=\u00a00.10) and versus each medication separately. These findings establish a benefit for thiazide diuretic treatment for the prevention of fractures versus other commonly used antihypertensive medications using prospective, randomized data. The effects of the thiazide diuretic on bone appear to be long lasting.", 
    "15": "Background: Enterochromaffin cells (EC) synthesize and release 5-HT and ATP to trigger or modulate gut neural reflexes and transmit information about visceral/pain sensation. Alterations in 5-HT signaling mechanisms may contribute to the pathogenesis of IBD or IBS, but the pharmacologic or molecular mechanisms modulating Ca(2+)-dependent 5-HT release are not understood. Previous studies indicated that purinergic signaling via ATP and ADP is an important mechanism in modulation of 5-HT release. However, EC cells also respond to UTP and UDP suggesting uridine triphosphate receptor and signaling pathways are involved as well. We tested the hypothesis that UTP is a regulator of 5-HT release in human EC cells. Methods: UTP signaling mechanisms were studied in BON cells, a human EC model, using Fluo-4/Ca(2+)imaging, patch-clamp, pharmacological analysis, immunohistochemistry, western blots and qPCR. 5-HT release was monitored in BON or EC isolated from human gut surgical specimens (hEC). Results: UTP, UTP\u03b3S, UDP or ATP induced Ca(2+)oscillations in BON. UTP evoked a biphasic concentration-dependent Ca(2+)response. Cells responded in the order of UTP, ATP > UTP\u03b3S > UDP > MRS2768, BzATP, \u03b1,\u03b2-MeATP > MRS2365, MRS2690, and NF546. Different proportions of cells activated by UTP and ATP also responded to UTP\u03b3S (P2Y4, 50% cells), UDP (P2Y6, 30%), UTP\u03b3S and UDP (14%) or MRS2768 (<3%). UTP Ca(2+)responses were blocked with inhibitors of PLC, IP3R, SERCA Ca(2+)pump, La(3+)sensitive Ca(2+)channels or chelation of intracellular free Ca(2+) by BAPTA/AM. Inhibitors of L-type, TRPC, ryanodine-Ca(2+)pools, PI3-Kinase, PKC or SRC-Kinase had no effect. UTP stimulated voltage-sensitive Ca(2+)currents (ICa), Vm-depolarization and inhibited IK (not IA) currents. An IKv7.2/7.3 K(+) channel blocker XE-991 mimicked UTP-induced Vm-depolarization and blocked UTP-responses. XE-991 blocked IK and UTP caused further reduction. La(3+) or PLC inhibitors blocked UTP depolarization; PKC inhibitors, thapsigargin or zero Ca(2+)buffer did not. UTP stimulated 5-HT release in hEC expressing TPH1, 5-HT, P2Y4/P2Y6R. Zero-Ca(2+)buffer augmented Ca(2+)responses and 5-HT release. Conclusion: UTP activates a predominant P2Y4R pathway to trigger Ca(2+)oscillations via internal Ca(2+)mobilization through a PLC/IP3/IP3R/SERCA Ca(2+)signaling pathway to stimulate 5-HT release; Ca(2+)influx is inhibitory. UTP-induced Vm-depolarization depends on PLC signaling and an unidentified K channel (which appears independent of Ca(2+)oscillations or Ica/VOCC). UTP-gated signaling pathways triggered by activation of P2Y4R stimulate 5-HT release.", 
    "16": "Anorexia and metabolic alterations are the main components of the cachectic syndrome. Glucose intolerance, fat depletion, muscle protein catabolism and other alterations are involved in the development of cancer cachexia, a multi-organ syndrome. Nutritional approach strategies are not satisfactory in reversing the cachectic syndrome. The aim of the present review is to deal with the recent therapeutic targeted approaches that have been designed to fight and counteract wasting in cancer patients. Indeed, some promising targeted therapeutic approaches include ghrelin agonists, selective androgen receptor agonists, \u03b2-blockers and antimyostatin peptides. However, a multi-targeted approach seems absolutely essential to treat patients affected by cancer cachexia. This approach should not only involve combinations of drugs but also nutrition and an adequate program of physical exercise, factors that may lead to a synergy, essential to overcome the syndrome. This may efficiently reverse the metabolic changes described above and, at the same time, ameliorate the anorexia. Defining this therapeutic combination of drugs/nutrients/exercise is an exciting project that will stimulate many scientific efforts. Other aspects that will, no doubt, be very important for successful treatment of cancer wasting will be an optimized design of future clinical trials, together with a protocol for staging cancer patients in relation to their degree of cachexia. This will permit that nutritional/metabolic/pharmacological support can be started early in the course of the disease, before severe weight loss occurs. Indeed, timing is crucial and has to be taken very seriously when applying the therapeutic approach.",

    "30": "Breast cancer metastatic to bone has a poor prognosis despite recent advances in our understanding of the biology of both bone and breast cancer. This article presents a new approach, the ABC7 regimen (Adjuvant for Breast Cancer treatment using seven repurposed drugs), to metastatic breast cancer. ABC7 aims to defeat aspects of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) that lead to dissemination of breast cancer to bone. As add-on to current standard treatment with capecitabine, ABC7 uses ancillary attributes of seven already-marketed noncancer treatment drugs to stop both the natural EMT process inherent to breast cancer and the added EMT occurring as a response to current treatment modalities. Chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery provoke EMT in cancer generally and in breast cancer specifically. ABC7 uses standard doses of capecitabine as used in treating breast cancer today. In addition, ABC7 uses 1) an older psychiatric drug, quetiapine, to block RANK signaling; 2) pirfenidone, an anti-fibrosis drug to block TGF-beta signaling; 3) rifabutin, an antibiotic to block beta-catenin signaling; 4) metformin, a first-line antidiabetic drug to stimulate AMPK and inhibit mammalian target of rapamycin, (mTOR); 5) propranolol, a beta-blocker to block beta-adrenergic signaling; 6) agomelatine, a melatonergic antidepressant to stimulate M1 and M2 melatonergic receptors; and 7) ribavirin, an antiviral drug to prevent eIF4E phosphorylation. All these block the signaling pathways - RANK, TGF-beta, mTOR, beta-adrenergic receptors, and phosphorylated eIF4E - that have been shown to trigger EMT and enhance breast cancer growth and so are worthwhile targets to inhibit. Agonism at MT1 and MT2 melatonergic receptors has been shown to inhibit both breast cancer EMT and growth. This ensemble was designed to be safe and augment capecitabine efficacy. Given the expected outcome of metastatic breast cancer as it stands today, ABC7 warrants a cautious trial.",

The structure and morphology of the ligand and the stationary phase were characterized by mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. The enantiomers of chiral compounds including nine common \u03b2-adrenergic blocker drugs (\u03b2-blockers), eight dansyl amino acids (DNS-AA) and six flavanones were successfully separated by polar organic solvent and reversed-phase chromatography, respectively. The results showed that BZCDP was a kind of multimode chiral separation materials with an excellent chromatographic performance for the above compounds. In polar organic solvent mode, BZCDP can effectively separate \u03b2-blockers, in which the enantioselectivity factors and resolutions of \u03b2-blockers were up to 1.30 and 1.97 within 20min, respectively. Under the reversed-phase mode, BZCDP exhibited high enantioselectivities for DNS-AA, among them the resolution of dansyl-tyrosine was 3.29 with 20min. BZCDP was also successfully used to separate the flavanone compounds with methanol or acetonitrile as mobile phase. The resolution of 4'-hydroxy flavanone enantiomers reached to 3.65 about 15min. Compared with the native \u03b2-cyclodextrin and \u03b3-cyclodextrin-bonded stationary phases in the literature, the separation speed of BZCDP containing mono-N-benzyl-phenethylamino-\u03b2-cyclodextrin ligand was faster and the separation selectivity was better, which indicated that the N-benzyl-phenethylamino group could also take part in the chiral recognition. After further study, we found that in polar organic solvent mode, the inclusion and hydrogen bonding were the main forces of chiral separations, and in reversed-phase mode, the inclusion and hydrophobic interaction are the main driving forces for chiral separations. Besides excellent chromatographic performance, the home-made cyclodextrin column with mesoporous SBA-15 as the matrix was much cheaper than commercial columns, and good permeability, which can reduce the cost of test and provide fast separation. BZCDP has a good prospect in chiral drug analysis.",

    "42": "Riluzole blocks persistent Na(+) current, inhibits generation of neuronal bursts and decreases glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. In previous studies of respiratory activity, riluzole suppressed inspiratory-related burst generation activity in rat slice or en bloc preparations. We examined riluzole's effects on inspiratory burst generation and drug-induced seizure-like activity in newborn rat en bloc preparations. Medulla-spinal cord preparations from postnatal day 0-3 Wistar rats were isolated under deep isoflurane anesthesia and were superfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid equilibrated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2, pH 7.4, at 25-26\u00b0C. Inspiratory activity was monitored from the fourth cervical ventral root. Seizure-like activity was induced by application of 20\u03bcM DL-threo-\u03b2-benzyloxyasparatate (TBOA, a glutamate uptake blocker preferentially acting on astrocytes) or coadministration of GABAA antagonist bicuculline (10\u03bcM) and glycine antagonist strychnine (10\u03bcM). Pretreatment and co-application with 10\u03bcM riluzole abolished the seizure-like burst activity induced by TBOA or bicuculline/strychnine. N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor antagonist MK801 (10\u03bcM) also depressed this activity. Riluzole may attenuate excessive glutamate action involved in pathological hyperexcitability of motor neurons with no major effect on generation of respiratory activity. Riluzole at the optimal dose could be a potential treatment to protect drug-induced epileptic brain tissue from excitotoxic damage without inducing respiratory suppression.", 
    "43": "A single heart rate (HR) measurement may inform future prognosis in chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The importance of elevated HR across serial assessment is uncertain, particularly with well-applied guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) with beta blockers (BBs). In this post hoc analysis of 129 patients with chronic HFrEF in sinus rhythm, who had aggressive medication titration over 10.6 months, HR and BB use were assessed at each visit (average of 6 visits per patient). All-cause mortality was assessed. At baseline, 81 subjects (62.8%) had HR \u226570 beats/min; 40 subjects (31.0%) had high HR despite being on \u226550% of GDMT BB dose. At final visit, 30.4% of the subjects still had high HR despite achieving \u226550% target BB dose. There were no significant baseline differences in demographics or BB doses in patients with HR <70 vs HR \u226570 beats/min. In adjusted model in which HR was treated as time-dependent covariate, an increase in HR of 10\u2009 beats/min was associated with an increased hazard of all-cause mortality during follow-up (adjusted hazard ratio per 10 beats/min\u2009=\u20092.46; 95% confidence interval 1.46-4.16, p\u2009<0.001). In conclusion, in well-managed patients with HFrEF, high HR was frequent even after aggressive medication titration, and often despite being on at least 50% of GDMT BB dose. An increase in HR was associated with worse clinical outcomes (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT#00351390).",

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 74 POAG patients (74 eyes) whose IOP was inadequately controlled by PG analogs (bimatoprost [13 eyes], latanoprost [34 eyes], tafluprost [11 eyes], and travoprost [16 eyes]) and underwent primary trabeculectomy. The proportion of patients with no recurrent IOP elevation within 24 months post-trabeculectomy was significantly (P < 0.001) lower in the bimatoprost group (31.3%) than in the latanoprost (83.2%), tafluprost (45.5%), or travoprost groups (65.6%). Deepening of the upper eyelid sulcus (DUES) was observed before trabeculectomy in 18 of 74 eyes (24.3%) treated with bimatoprost (9 eyes; 50.0%), latanoprost (3 eyes; 16.7%), tafluprost (1 eye; 5.5%) and travoprost (5 eyes; 27.8%). The proportion of patients with no recurrent IOP elevation up to 24 months post-trabeculectomy was significantly (P < 0.0001) lower in the DUES(+) group (34.7%) than in the DUES(-) group (74.3%). Multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis, with no recurrent IOP elevation used as dependent variable, and bimatoprost, latanoprost, travoprost, tafluprost, \u03b2-blocker, carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, brimonidine, gender, age, preoperative IOP, mean deviation, duration of PG analog use before surgery, and the number of ophthalmic solutions used as independent variables, identified only bimatoprost as a significant independent factor (P = 0.0368). Thus, the outcome of trabeculectomy varied depending on the PG analog used preoperatively, and bimatoprost use was associated with a high risk of recurrent IOP elevation up to 2 years post-trabeculectomy. This may indicate that the incidence of DUES differed with the PG analog used. Patients with glaucoma who are treated with bimatoprost should be monitored for DUES, and when these patients undergo trabeculectomy, the postoperative course of IOP should be followed carefully.",

We developed a hyperkalemia susceptibility score that incorporated estimated glomerular filtration rate, baseline potassium level, sex, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, and the concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics in new ACE-I/ARB users; this score accurately predicted 1-year hyperkalemia risk in the SCREAM cohort (area under the curve, 0.845, 95% CI: 0.840-0.869) and in a validation cohort from the US-based Geisinger Health System (N=19\u00a0524; area under the curve, 0.818, 95% CI: 0.794-0.841), with good calibration.",

The CDCs were treated with \u03b21-AR blocker (Met group), \u03b22-AR antagonist (ICI group) and p38MAPK inhibitor (SB group), nonselective \u03b2-AR blocker (PRO group), and \u03b2-AR agonist (ISO group). The viability, apoptotic rate and differentiation status of CDCs were determined by MST-1 assay, flow cytometery, and Western blot, respectively. The CDCs viability significantly reduced in ICI group (all P\u2009<\u20090.05), and SB group had a significant high viability after 48h treatment (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Compared with control group, all treated groups had a low apoptotic rate. After treatment for 72h, ISO treatment elevated the expression of Nkx2.5, and could partially or fully attenuate the inhibitory effects of \u03b2-AR antagonists and/or p38MAPK inhibitor. A similar overall trend of protein expression levels among all groups could be observed between protein pairs of cTnT and \u03b21-AR as well as c-Kit and \u03b22-AR, respectively. These results suggested that \u03b2-ARs and p38MAPK signaling pathways play crucial roles in the proliferation and differentiation of CDCs.

Topical application of timolol eye drop has been mentioned in few studies, most of which reported that the solution cannot stay on the site of application due to its fluidity. Adding hydroxyethyl cellulose into a timolol solution increased its viscosity by forming a hydrogel and thus changed the rheology property. The compounded timolol gel exhibited thixotropy property allowing better and longer contact at sites of application.

De novo urgency and urge incontinence is seen in 9 and 5% of men, respectively, after urethroplasty. Once a complication of urethroplasty (such as recurrent urethral stricture or diverticulum) has been excluded as a cause, evaluation of LUTS in such patients should focus on differentiating bladder dysfunction (overactive bladder, underactive bladder), from other outlet obstruction (such as benign prostatic obstruction), dysfunctional voiding, or medical causes (such as nocturnal polyuria). Management of overactive bladder may include behavioural modification, physical therapy, anticholinergic and/or beta-3 agonist medications, intravesical onabolulinum toxin, sacral neuromodulation or peripheral tibial nerve stimulation. Definitive treatment for underactive bladder is limited. Treatment of benign prostatic obstruction may include alpha-blocker and/or 5-alpha reductase inhibitor medication, or surgery to cavitate the prostate. Minimally invasive prostatic procedures are also an option. Although management of LUTS for patients after urethral stricture repair can usually proceed similarly as for patients without prior history of urethral reconstruction, special consideration and alterations in management need to be made when instrumenting the urethra, as the urethral lumen may be narrower in these patients.",

Diuretics are widely used to attenuate symptoms and signs of congestion in both heart failure with preserved and reduced ejection fraction, although their effects on long-term prognosis of both phenotypes of heart failure have not been demonstrated because of an ethical difficulty in designing a randomized and prospective clinical trial. Guidelines do not provide any guidance on therapy choice, and physicians blindly choose furosemide among loop diuretics in current clinical settings. However, several clinical studies have suggested that the effects of loop diuretics are not consistent, and that furosemide is not necessarily preferable as compared with other loop diuretics.

    "75": "Portal hypertension (PH) is responsible for the most severe complications of cirrhosis and leading cause of death and liver transplantation. The standard pharmacological treatment available for PH currently consists of the use of a non-selective beta-blocker. However, a significant proportion of patients do not respond to pharmacological treatment. This has led to the development of identifiable targets for the discovery of new horizons in PH treatment. Recently, there has been significant progress in understanding the mechanism behind PH, which is a product of increased hepatic vascular resistance including structural changes and functional change due to endothelial dysfunction. Moreover, increased portal inflow is the outcome of dilation of splanchnic vessels and hyperdynamic circulation. Here, challenges in formulating potential pharmacological treatment as well as current potential targets for PH will be reviewed. During the past decades, there have been many efforts to explore new techniques to stimulate liver regeneration in addition to pharmacological treatment. The bone marrow (BM) stem cells which differentiate into mature hepatocytes are thought to contribute to liver regeneration and have been found to demonstrate great potential as regenerative medicine in different therapeutic applications. Based on these insights, we explore the current and potential novel therapeutic uses of BM stem cell therapy in PH.", 
    "76": "The anorexigenic neuropeptide NEFA/nucleobindin 2 (NUCB2)/nesfatin-1-containing neurons are distributed in the brain regions involved in feeding regulation. In spite of the growing knowledge of its physiological functions through extensive studies, its molecular mechanism of reaction, including its receptor, remains unknown. NUCB2/nesfatin-1 is also involved in various peripheral regulations, including glucose homeostasis. In pancreatic beta-cells, NUCB2/nesfatin-1 is reported to enhance glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) but its exact mechanism remains unknown. To clarify this mechanism, we measured the effect of nesfatin-1 on the electrical activity of pancreatic beta-cells. Using mouse primary beta cells, we measured changes in the ATP-sensitive K(+) (KATP) channel current, the voltage-gated K(+) (Kv) channel current, and insulin secretion upon application of nesfatin-1. Nesfatin-1 inhibited the Kv channel, but KATP channel activity was unaffected. Nesfatin-1 enhanced insulin secretion to a same level as Kv channel blocker tetraethylammonium (TEA). The effect was not further enhanced when nesfatin-1 and TEA were applied simultaneously. The inhibition binding assay with [(125)I]nesfatin-1 in Kv2.1 channels, major contributor of Kv current in beta cell, expressing HEK239 cells indicated the binding of nesfatin-1 on Kv2.1 channel. Because Kv channel inhibition enhances insulin secretion under high glucose conditions, our present data suggest a possible mechanism of nesfatin-1 on enhancing GSIS through regulation of ion channels rather than its unidentified receptor.",

Postoperative stroke rate was 1.37%; 27.1% of patients had significant SSEP or EEG changes, and 49.1% of these were clamp induced (within 5\u00a0minutes of cross-clamping). Of these patients, 83.2% received a shunt (11.4% overall). The most common reason that a shunt was not placed after cross-clamp-induced changes was that the changes resolved with further blood pressure elevation (8 of 17 patients). Clamp-induced IOM changes were predictive of postoperative stroke (odds ratio [OR], 5.5; P\u00a0=\u00a0.005). Risk factors for clamp-induced IOM changes were contralateral carotid occlusion (OR, 2.5; P\u00a0= .01), symptomatic stenosis (OR, 1.8; P\u00a0= .006), and diabetes (OR, 1.6; P\u00a0= .03), whereas there was a trend toward increased risk with female sex (OR, 1.5; P\u00a0= .08). Risk factors for any IOM change (clamp and nonclamp induced) were symptomatic carotid stenosis (OR, 1.8; P\u00a0< .001), use of beta blockers (OR, 1.5; P\u00a0= .03), and female sex (OR, 1.5; P\u00a0= .02).",

Contralateral carotid occlusion, symptomatic stenosis, diabetes, and female sex increase the risk of clamp-induced IOM changes and should be anticipated to need a shunt. Patients receiving beta blockers are likely to experience IOM changes during the operation that are not associated with clamping.", 
    "89": "Mutations in the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RyR1) cause malignant hyperthermia (MH) and central core disease (CCD), while mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) lead to catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). Most disease-associated RyR1 and RyR2 mutations are located in the N-terminal, central, and C-terminal regions of the corresponding RyR isoform. An increasing body of evidence demonstrates that CPVT-associated RyR2 mutations enhance the propensity for spontaneous Ca(2+) release during store Ca(2+) overload, a process known as store-overload induced Ca(2+) release (SOICR). Considering the similar locations of disease-associated RyR1 and RyR2 mutations in the RyR structure, we hypothesize that like CPVT-associated RyR2 mutations, MH/CCD-associated RyR1 mutations also enhance SOICR. To test this hypothesis, we determined the impact on SOICR of 12 MH/CCD-associated RyR1 mutations E2347-del, R2163H, G2434R, R2435L, R2435H, and R2454H located in the central region, and Y4796C, T4826I, L4838V, A4940T, G4943V, and P4973L located in the C-terminal region of the channel. We found that all these RyR1 mutations reduced the threshold for SOICR. Dantrolene, an acute treatment for MH, suppressed SOICR in HEK293 cells expressing the RyR1 mutants R164C, Y523S, R2136H, R2435H, and Y4796C. Interestingly, carvedilol, a commonly used beta-blocker that suppresses RyR2-mediated SOICR, also inhibits SOICR in these RyR1 mutant HEK293 cells. Therefore, these results indicate that reduced SOICR threshold is a common defect of MH/CCD-associated RyR1 mutations, and that carvedilol, like dantrolene, can suppress RyR1-mediated SOICR. Clinical studies of the effectiveness of carvedilol as a long-term treatment for MH/CCD or other RyR1-associated disorders may be warranted.",

Upon arrival, her pulse was 63 beats/min and blood pressure was 106/56 mm Hg. The patient's blood pressure was refractory to fluids, calcium gluconate, and norepinephrine, resulting in initiation of HIE therapy. She had recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia, which required increases of the dextrose infusion and resulted in the patient receiving a total of 6.9 L of dextrose with free water. Seventeen hours into the hospitalization, the patient became obtunded due to hyponatremia (serum sodium concentration, 121 mmol/L). HIE therapy was discontinued, an infusion of 5% dextrose injection with sodium bicarbonate added was started, and a bolus of 3% sodium chloride was administered. Nine hours after the presentation of hyponatremia, the patient's serum sodium concentration normalized (137 mmol/L), and her symptoms resolved.

The first manifestation of the syndrome may be sudden death, therefore, early diagnosis and therapy is of great importance. LQTS can be both congenital and acquired. The latter is most commonly seen in hospitalized patients and such individuals have an easily recognizable and reversible precipitating factor (electrolyte disturbances, certain drugs etc.). Congenital LQTS, a less prevalent condition, is considered to be part of the greater family of disorders called channelopathies. Extensive research during the past decade allowed better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms and unmasking of the genetic substrate of these patients. Both pharmacological and interventional therapies (left cardiac sympathetic denervation, ICDs) have been used in the treatment of congenital long-QT syndrome.

Implantation was deemed clinically useful when the ICD provided appropriate therapy and the patient survived implantation by 1 year and the first shock by 30 days. ICD-resistant mortality (ICDRM) was defined as death within 30 days after the first shock, within 1 year of implantation or without previous appropriate ICD therapy. After 5 years, ICDRM occurred in 23% of implantations, while 36% were clinically useful. After multivariable analysis, ICDRM was associated with LVEF <35% (HR: 2.63; p\u2009=\u2009.005), beta-blocker dose <50% (HR: 2.0; p\u2009=\u2009.01) and anterior or diffuse infarct location (HR: 3.61; p\u2009=\u2009.001 and HR: 2.89; p\u2009=\u2009.02). Useful ICD implantations were associated with beta-blocker dose <50% (HR: 1.64; p\u2009=\u2009.02) and non-anterior infarct location (HR: 3.22 vs anterior and 1.59 vs diffuse; combined p<.001).",

At 10 years, up to 80% of implantations could be categorized. Lower LVEF was related with significantly higher incidence of ICDRM. Anterior infarcts were associated with more ICDRM and less useful implantations than non-anterior infarcts. Future risk stratification for ICD should focus more on the discrimination between arrhythmic risk, probably preventable by ICDs and ICD-resistant mortality risk.",

Importantly, human HF subjects receiving \u03b21AR-blockers display elevated circulating S1P levels, confirming that Meto promotes S1P secretion/signaling. Mechanistically, we found that Meto-induced S1P secretion is \u03b23AR-dependent because Meto infusion in \u03b23AR knockout mice does not elevate circulating S1P levels, nor does it ameliorate post-MI dysfunction, as in wild-type mice.",

The results demonstrated no statistical difference in the subject baseline data between the two groups. While more significantly activated Kv1.3 channels were identified in the peripheral blood T-lymphocytes of the hypertension group compared to the normotension group, the mRNA and protein expression levels of NLRP3, caspase-1 and IL-1\u03b2 were elevated and their peripheral serum interleukin-1\u03b2 levels were significantly increased. After inhibiting the Kv1.3 channels using the classic potassium channel blocker, these indicators were all decreased significantly.

    "124": "GN refers to a variety of renal pathologies that often progress to ESRD, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this progression remain incompletely characterized. Here, we determined whether dysregulated expression of the gap junction protein connexin 43, which has been observed in the progression of renal disease, contributes to GN progression. Immunostaining revealed de novo expression of connexin 43 in damaged glomeruli in patients with glomerular diseases as well as in mice after induction of experimental GN. Notably, 2 weeks after the induction of GN with nephrotoxic serum, mice with a heterozygous deletion of the connexin 43 gene (connexin 43+/-) had proteinuria, BUN, and serum creatinine levels significantly lower than those of wild-type animals. Additionally, the connexin 43+/- mice showed less crescent formation, tubular dilation, monocyte infiltration, and interstitial renal fibrosis. Treatment of cultured podocytes with connexin 43-specific blocking peptides attenuated TGF-\u03b2-induced cytoskeletal and morphologic changes and apoptosis as did treatment with the purinergic blocker suramin. Finally, therapeutic treatment of GN mice with connexin 43-specific antisense oligodeoxynucleotide improved functional and structural renal parameters. These findings suggest that crosstalk between connexin 43 and purinergic signaling contributes to podocyte damage in GN. Given that this protein is highly induced in individuals with glomerular diseases, connexin 43 may be a novel target for therapeutic treatment of GN.",

His serum free thyroxine, free triiodothyronine, and thyrotropin receptor antibody levels were elevated at 2.9\u00a0ng/dL, 7.2\u00a0pg/dL, and 4.7\u00a0IU/L, respectively. Serum thyrotropin levels were suppressed at less than 0.01 \u03bcIU/mL. Thyroid echography demonstrated no thyroid swelling (23\u2009\u00d7\u200943\u00a0mm). A whole body computed tomography was performed for systemic evaluation. This revealed exophthalmos and a mass of size 57\u2009\u00d7\u200964\u00a0mm in the anterior pararenal space. Based on these findings, we made an initial diagnosis of thyrotoxic crisis secondary to exacerbation of Grave's hyperthyroidism. Treatment was begun with an iodine agent at a dose of 36\u00a0mg/day, thiamazole at a dose of 30\u00a0mg/day, and hydrocortisone at a dose of 300 mg daily for 3 consecutive days. To control tachycardia, continuous intravenously administered propranolol and diltiazem infusions were given. At the same time, small doses of doxazosin and carvedilol were used for both alpha and beta adrenergic blockade. On hospital day 5, his blood pressure and serum catecholamine concentrations (adrenalin 42,365\u00a0pg/mL, dopamine 6409\u00a0pg/mL, noradrenalin 72,212\u00a0pg/mL) were still high despite higher beta blocker and calcium channel blocker doses. These findings contributed to the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma multisystem crisis with simultaneous thyrotoxic crisis. We increased the doses of doxazosin and carvedilol, which stabilized his hemodynamic status.

We explored the incidence and predictors of post-operative AF at 30-day follow-up in an unselected multi-centre cohort of patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in contemporary practice. Methods and results\u2003We enrolled 740 consecutive patients scheduled for elective CABG with or without valve surgery. Cardiac rhythm was continuously monitored for 15\u202fdays after surgery by an ambulatory event loop recorder. Clinical follow-up for the occurrence of arrhythmias was performed for the next 15\u202fdays by office visits. The primary end point was the incidence of AF at 30-day follow-up. Mean age was 56.5\u2009\u00b1\u20098.9\u202fyears; 69.5% were males; 80% had diabetes. All patients completed 30-day follow-up. At the end of 30\u202fdays, AF occurred in 77\u202fpatients (10.4%). Most episodes (47 out of 77 episodes, 61%) of AF occurred during post-operative day 2. Episodes of AF were very rare after the first 5 post-operative days (3 out of 77 episodes, 3.9%). Multivariable regression analysis identified the following independent predictors of AF at 30-day follow-up: the lack of beta blocker use (hazard ratio 0.37, 95% confidence interval 0.21-0.64, P\u2009<\u20090.001), and the preoperative left atrial volume index (hazard Ratio 2.21, 95% confidence interval 1.79-2.74, P\u2009<\u20090.001). Conclusions\u2003In patients undergoing elective CABG, the incidence of post-operative AF at 30-day follow-up is rather low; the lack of beta blocker use in the perioperative period, and the preoperative left atrial volume index independently predicted the occurrence of AF at 30\u202fdays.",

Pharmacological studies revealed the prevention of adrenergic-induced arrhythmias by \u03b2-blockers (propranolol and carvedilol), flecainide, and the neuronal sodium-channel blocker riluzole; a direct antiarrhythmic action of carvedilol (independent of its \u03b1/\u03b2-adrenergic blocking activity), flecainide, and riluzole; and suppression of abnormal Ca(2+) cycling by the ryanodine stabilizer JTV-519 and carvedilol. Mechanistic insights were gained on the different antiarrhythmic actions of the aforementioned drugs, with carvedilol and JTV-519 (but not flecainide or riluzole) acting primarily through sarcoplasmic reticulum stabilization. Finally, comparable outcomes were found between flecainide and labetalol antiarrhythmic effects in vitro and the clinical results in the same patient.",

    "194": "Motoneuron disease including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis may be due, at an early stage, to deficit in the extracellular clearance of the excitatory transmitter glutamate. A model of glutamate-mediated excitotoxic cell death based on pharmacological inhibition of its uptake was used to investigate how activation of neuronal nicotinic receptors by nicotine may protect motoneurons. Hypoglossal motoneurons (HMs) in neonatal rat brainstem slices were exposed to the glutamate uptake blocker DL-threo-\u03b2-benzyloxyaspartate (TBOA) that evoked large Ca(2+) transients time locked among nearby HMs, whose number fell by about 30% 4\u2009h later. As nicotine or the gap junction blocker carbenoxolone suppressed bursting, we studied connexin 36 (Cx36), which constitutes gap junctions in neurons and found it largely expressed by HMs. Cx36 was downregulated when nicotine or carbenoxolone was co-applied with TBOA. Expression of Cx36 was preferentially observed in cytosolic rather than membrane fractions after nicotine and TBOA, suggesting protein redistribution with no change in synthesis. Nicotine raised the expression of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), a protective factor that binds the apoptotic-inducing factor (AIF) whose nuclear translocation is a cause of cell death. TBOA increased intracellular AIF, an effect blocked by nicotine. These results indicate that activation of neuronal nicotinic receptors is an early tool for protecting motoneurons from excitotoxicity and that this process is carried out via the combined decrease in Cx36 activity, overexpression of Hsp70 and fall in AIF translocation. Thus, retarding or inhibiting HM death may be experimentally achieved by targeting one of these processes leading to motoneuron death.",

    "199": "Background: Exaggerated beat-to-beat variability of ventricular action potential duration (APD) is linked to arrhythmogenesis. Sympathetic stimulation has been shown to increase QT interval variability, but its effect on ventricular APD in humans has not been determined. Methods and Results: Eleven heart failure patients with implanted bi-ventricular pacing devices had activation-recovery intervals (ARI, surrogate for APD) recorded from LV epicardial electrodes under constant RV pacing. Sympathetic activity was increased using a standard autonomic challenge (Valsalva) and baroreceptor indices were applied to determine changes in sympathetic stimulation. Two Valsalvas were performed for each study and were repeated, both off and on bisoprolol. In addition sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) was measured from skin electrodes on the thorax using a novel validated method. Autonomic modulation significantly increased mean short-term variability in ARI; off bisoprolol mean STV increased from 3.73 \u00b1 1.3 to 5.27 \u00b1 1.04 ms (p = 0.01), on bisoprolol mean STV of ARI increased from 4.15 \u00b1 1.14 to 4.62 \u00b1 1 ms (p = 0.14). Adrenergic indices of the Valsalva demonstrated significantly reduced beta-adrenergic function when on bisoprolol (\u0394 pressure recovery time, p = 0.04; \u0394 systolic overshoot in Phase IV, p = 0.05). Corresponding increases in SNA from rest both off (1.4 uV, p < 0.01) and on (0.7 uV, p < 0.01) bisoprolol were also seen. Conclusions: Beat-to-beat variability of ventricular APD increases during brief periods of increased sympathetic activity in patients with heart failure. Bisoprolol reduces, but does not eliminate, these effects. This may be important in the genesis of ventricular arrhythmias in heart failure patients.",

    "210": "The presence of anionic free silanols in the silica-based stationary phases gives rise to broad and asymmetrical peaks when cationic basic compounds are chromatographed using hydro-organic mobile phases. The addition to the mobile phase of a reagent with ionic character prevents the access of analytes to the free silanols, improving the peak shape. The silanol activity can be affected by the buffer concentration and mobile phase pH, factors that are not always considered sufficiently in the literature. In this work, the chromatographic behaviour of three basic \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonists (acebutolol, nadolol and timolol), using mobile phases containing acetonitrile, was examined at different phosphate buffer concentrations (5-50mM) and mobile phase pH (2-8), in the absence and presence of three imidazolium-based ionic liquids (1-ethyl-, 1-butyl- and 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride). All factors were evaluated through both the retention and peak shape. The imidazolium cations can block the access of cationic analytes through electrostatic interaction with the anionic silanols, or association with the alkyl chains bound to the stationary phase. In previous reports, the protection mechanism was demonstrated to be directly related to the cation size. The studies in this work reveal that the effectiveness of the mobile phase additive as silanol blocker also depends on the concentration of the buffer anion and the protonation degree of the silanols on the stationary phase. Increasing amounts of phosphate at low pH give rise to increasing retention times. Also, the peak shape is improved, which indicates the influence of phosphate on blocking the activity of free silanols. However, the benefits obtained by the combined effect of buffering the mobile phase at low pH and the use of a bulky additive are lost at pH>6.",

However, a number of MMPs studies is highly limited. Here, for the first time, we propose a comprehensive approach by analyzing the expression levels of metalloproteinases-2/9 (MMPs-2/9) and tissue metalloproteinase inhibitor-2 (TIMP-2) in vivo on both, molecular and immunohistochemical levels, and in both, IH tissues and in the serum of IH patients, and relates the obtained results to the tumor's biology and systemic propranolol treatment.",

A survey of clinicians carried out to establish the risk threshold at which they would obtain written consent showed the majority (85%) sought written consent for interventions associated with a 12-fold lower mortality risk: one in 100 patients. A systematic review of UK patient information leaflets to establish the magnitude of risk considered sufficient to be stated explicitly showed that leaflets begin to mention death at a \u223c18\u2009000-fold lower mortality risk of just 0.0007 in 100 patients.",

Accordingly, pharmacological targeting of PP1 activity is considered for therapeutic intervention in human cardiomyopathies. Recent evidence from animal models implicated previously unrecognized, isoform-specific activities of PP1 in the healthy and diseased heart. Therefore, this study examined the expression of the distinct PP1 isoforms PP1\u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 in human heart failure (HF) and atrial fibrillation (AF) and addressed the consequences of \u03b2-adrenoceptor blocker (beta-blocker) therapy for HF patients with reduced ejection fraction on PP1 isoform expression. Using western blot analysis, we found greater abundance of PP1 isoforms \u03b1 and \u03b3 but unaltered PP1\u03b2 levels in left ventricular myocardial tissues from HF patients as compared to non-failing controls. However, expression of all three PP1 isoforms was higher in atrial appendages from patients with AF compared to patients with sinus rhythm. Moreover, we found that in human failing ventricles, beta-blocker therapy was associated with lower PP1\u03b1 abundance and activity, as indicated by higher phosphorylation of the PP1\u03b1-specific substrate eIF2\u03b1. Greater eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation is a known repressor of protein translation, and accordingly, we found lower levels of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress marker Grp78 in the very same samples. We propose that isoform-specific targeting of PP1\u03b1 activity may be a novel and innovative therapeutic strategy for the treatment of human cardiac diseases by reducing ER stress conditions.",

Wistar rats were treated with L-NAME administered in the drinking water for 8\u00a0weeks together with oral administration of carvedilol 30\u00a0mg/kg (n\u00a0=\u00a06), amlodipine 10\u00a0mg/kg (n\u00a0=\u00a06), or vehicle (n\u00a0=\u00a06). At the end of the treatment, echocardiographic evaluation, blood pressure, and short-term variability measurements were performed. Left ventricular and thoracic aortas were removed to assess activity of metalloproteinase 2 and 9 and expression levels of transforming growth factor \u03b2, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, and interleukin 6. Histological samples were prepared from both tissues. Carvedilol and amlodipine induced a comparable reduction of systolic and mean arterial pressure and its short-term variability in L-NAME rats. The expression of transforming growth factor \u03b2, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, and interleukin 6 decreased in both organs after carvedilol or amlodipine treatment and the activity of metalloproteinase was reduced in aortic tissue. Treatment with carvedilol or amlodipine completely prevented left ventricular collagen deposition and morphometric alterations in aorta. Oral chronic treatment with carvedilol or amlodipine significantly attenuates blood pressure variability and reduces target organ damage and biomarkers of tissue fibrosis and inflammation in L-NAME hypertensive rats.", 
    "224": "Sexual dysfunction affects millions of people with an increasing prevalence, worldwide. The pathophysiology of the disease shares several similarities with cardiovascular disease (CVD), including atherosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction, structural vascular damage and subclinical inflammation. Erectile dysfunction (ED) and female sexual dysfunction are common among patients with CVD and risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity and metabolic syndrome. Given the common pathogenesis of the diseases, ED is an independent prognostic factor of future ED events. Patients with overt ED or risk factors are usually treated with several drugs for the management of these conditions. Several of these drugs have been evaluated for their effect on sexual activity. Among the antihypertensive drugs, diuretics and beta-blockers seem to exert a detrimental impact on sexual function, with nebivolol being the only beta-blocker with favorable properties through an increase in nitric oxide bioavailability. In contrast, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors and calcium-channel blockers have a neutral effect on sexual activity. Hypoglycemic drugs have been less evaluated in the ED setting, with metformin, pioglitazone and liraglutide presenting favorable results. Statins on the other hand have not provided consistent results with observational studies suggesting a detrimental role in sexual activity and a few randomized studies indicating a neutral or even beneficial effect on erectile function.",

The question addressed was 'Does the use of beta-blockers significantly prevent and treat the occurrence of cyanotic spells in preoperative infants with tetralogy of Fallot?' Altogether, 80 papers were found using the reported search, of which 6 represented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The author, journal, date, country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes and results of these papers are tabulated. The participants in the papers reviewed were uncorrected (native or palliated) tetralogy of Fallot patients, all younger than 18 years of age, with some patients younger than 1 year. Each study reviewed included at least 10 patients, and all the studies were case series. Although even the most recent studies found were from 30 years ago, their data remain relevant. Several reviews reported either cases of overdosage or changes in efficacy of treatment after long-term usage. Four of the 6 case reviews demonstrated a decrease in the number of recurring cyanotic spells in at least 66% of the participants, following the introduction of beta-blockers. We can therefore conclude that the use of beta-blockers prevents the occurrence of cyanotic spells in preoperative patients with tetralogy of Fallot. There were insufficient data to establish optimum dosages or duration of treatment.", 
    "226": "Stanford type A aortic dissection requires urgent intervention and immediate surgical approach in the emergency department. Survival rate is low, even in patients who undergo immediate surgery. Presently described is a case of unoperated Stanford type A aortic dissection that has been in follow-up under beta-blocker treatment for 7 years. To the best of our knowledge, our case is the longest surviving patient with unoperated type A aortic dissection reported in the literature.", 
    "227": "\u03b2-Blocker exposure has been shown to reduce mortality in traumatic brain injury (TBI); however, the efficacy of \u03b2-blockers remains inconclusive. Therefore, a meta-analysis was conducted in this paper to evaluate the safety and efficacy of \u03b2-blocker therapy on patients with TBI.", 
    "228": "The electronic databases were systemically retrieved from construction to February 2017. The odds ratio (OR), mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were determined.", 
    "229": "A total of 13 observational cohort studies involving 15,734 cases were enrolled. The results indicated that \u03b2-blocker therapy had remarkably reduced the in-hospital mortality (OR 0.33; 95% CI 0.27-0.40; p<0.001). However, \u03b2-blocker therapy was also associated with increased infection rate (OR 2.01; 95% CI 1.50-2.69; p<0.001), longer length of stay (MD=7.40; 95% CI=4.39, 10.41; p<0.001) and ICU stay (MD=3.52; 95% CI=1.56, 5.47; p<0.001). In addition, \u03b2-blocker therapy also led to longer period of ventilator support (MD=2.70; 95% CI=1.81, 3.59; p<0.001).", 
    "230": "The meta-analysis demonstrates that \u03b2-blockers are effective in lowering mortality in patients with TBI. However, \u03b2-blocker therapy has markedly increased the infection rate and requires a longer period of ventilator support, intensive care management as well as length of stay.", 
    "231": "Localized thickening of the basal portion of the ventricular septum or basal septal hypertrophy (BSH) has been identified both at autopsy and by imaging studies for decades; despite numerous investigations, there is no consensus on the significance of this finding and a remarkable lack of consistency in terminology. This paper summarizes the scientific literature on the topic, focusing on recent echocardiographic findings. A case description illustrating some of the complex issues involved in measurement and diagnosis and differentiation from sigmoidal hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is presented. Criteria are proposed for diagnosing pathologic BSH which include the following: (1) Exertional symptoms compatible with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) such as dyspnea, near-syncope, and chest discomfort; (2) Documented LVOTO gradient demonstrated at peak bicycle or post-treadmill exercise >30\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg; and (3) Symptomatic improvement with \u03b2-blocker (or other negative inotropic) therapy (preferably accompanied by documentation of reduction of exercise-induced LVOT).", 
    "232": "A 64-year-old male fell from an altitude of 10\u2009m while paragliding after stalling due to the wind. The purpose of this case report is to describe the outcomes after multiple injuries sustained during a paragliding accident, including a potentially life-threating injury to the thoracic aorta. The subject sustained a bite wound on his tongue, injuries to his chest (left side) and back, and a right forearm deformity. Enhanced whole body computed tomography (CT) revealed fractures of the bilateral laminae of the second and third cervical bones, right first rib, the tenth thoracic vertebral body (compression type), second lumbar vertebral body (burst type) and the right radius, Other injuries included an injury to the thoracic aortic arch and the presence of intraabdominal fluid collection without perforation of the digestive tract. Endovascular treatment was selected for the aortic injury because of multiple injuries. Immediate management included hypotensive rate control therapy using calcium and a beta blocker. On the fourth hospital day, the subject underwent deployment of a stent-graft to the aorta and subsequent surgical immobilization for the lumbar burst fracture. He also underwent surgical immobilization of the radial fracture and was discharged on the 28th hospital day. First responders or physicians should consider the possibility of aortic injury when treating patients who suffer falls while paragliding and provide appropriate management. Failure to provide appropriate management of an aortic injury could result in death.",

    "234": "To investigate the association between use of \u03b2-blockers and \u03b2-blocker characteristics - selectivity, lipid solubility, intrinsic sympathetic activity (ISA) and CYP2D6 enzyme metabolism - and fall risk.", 
    "235": "Data from two prospective studies were used, including community-dwelling individuals, n\u00a0=\u00a07662 (the Rotterdam Study) and 2407 (B-PROOF), all aged \u226555\u00a0years. Fall incidents were recorded prospectively. Time-varying \u03b2-blocker use was determined using pharmacy dispensing records. Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for age and sex were applied to determine the association between \u03b2-blocker use, their characteristics - selectivity, lipid solubility, ISA and CYP2D6 enzyme metabolism - and fall risk. The results of the studies were combined using meta-analyses.", 
    "236": "In total 2917 participants encountered a fall during a total follow-up time of 89\u2005529\u00a0years. Meta-analysis indicated no association between use of any \u03b2-blocker, compared to nonuse, and fall risk, hazard ratio (HR)\u00a0=\u00a00.97 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88-1.06]. Use of a selective \u03b2-blocker was also not associated with fall risk, HR\u00a0=\u00a00.92 (95%CI 0.83-1.01). Use of a nonselective \u03b2-blocker was associated with an increased fall risk, HR\u00a0=\u00a01.22 (95%CI 1.01-1.48). Other \u03b2-blocker characteristics including lipid solubility and CYP2D6 enzyme metabolism were not associated with fall risk.", 
    "237": "Our study suggests that use of a nonselective \u03b2-blocker, contrary to selective \u03b2-blockers, is associated with an increased fall risk in an older population. In clinical practice, \u03b2-blockers have been shown effective for a variety of cardiovascular indications. However, fall risk should be considered when prescribing a \u03b2-blocker in this age group, and the pros and cons for \u03b2-blocker classes should be taken into consideration.", 
    "238": "Beta-agonist treatment during pregnancy may unmask the diagnosis of long QT syndrome. The QT prolongation can result in functional AV block. A history of seizure and/or sudden death in a family member should raise suspicion of ventricular tachycardia. More than one mutation may coexist. Refusal of beta-blocker therapy complicates risk stratification."
