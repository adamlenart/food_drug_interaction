Current literature recommends avoiding beta-blockers in the acute care setting, but after discharge from the hospital, benefits of beta-blocker use may outweigh risks in patients with recent MI resulting from cocaine use. Cardioselective beta-blocker therapy has been demonstrated to be beneficial in post-MI patients with nonsevere asthma. This review article is to compare the risks and benefits of using carvedilol in patients with asthma who have had cocaine-induced MI.", 
    "1": "The authors searched the English literature from 1984 to July 2010 via PubMed, EMBASE and SCOPUS using the following search terms: \"cocaine-induced myocardial infarction AND treatment,\" \"cocaine AND carvedilol,\" \"beta blockers AND asthma,\" and \"carvedilol AND asthma.\" All studies and case reports related to carvedilol use associated with bronchospasm in patients with asthma and carvedilol use after cocaine-induced MI were included.", 
    "2": "Carvedilol has theoretical advantages in patients who use cocaine, but there are no controlled studies confirming the superior efficacy of this agent. Reports of carvedilol use in patients with asthma are rare, but findings include increased asthma symptoms and hospitalization in some patients. Fatal asthma has also been reported because of this noncardioselective beta-blocker.", 
    "3": "Based on a lack of evidence supporting the theoretical advantages but documented risks associated with its use in patients with asthma, carvedilol should be avoided in asthma patients who have a history of cocaine-induced MI. Cardioselective beta-blockers should be used in post-MI patients with nonsevere asthma.", 
    "4": "Prolonged QT syndrome is the most common genetic arrhythmia syndrome, and the majority of patients are undiagnosed. The syndrome is characterized by abnormally long ventricular repolarization (QT interval) on electrocardiogram, which may manifest as syncopal episodes, arrhythmias, or sudden death. Arrhythmias may be precipitated by stress or medications. There are few randomized controlled trials examining the safety of typical sedation medications in the patient with prolonged long-QT syndrome. This case describes the management of sedation in a patient with prolonged long-QT syndrome and then reviews the current literature regarding commonly utilized sedation medications.", 
    "5": "We recently reported that reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays an excitatory role in modulation of the exercise pressor reflex (EPR) in normal rats. In this study, we further tested two independent hypotheses: 1) ROS interacts with EPR-related ionotropic receptors such as the purinergic receptors (P(2)) and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 receptors (TRPV1) to indirectly modulate the EPR function; 2) ROS directly affects excitability of muscle afferents by modulating the voltage-gated sodium (Na(v)) channels. To test the first hypothesis, we performed animal experiments to investigate the effect of the SOD mimetic 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl piperidine 1-oxyl (Tempol) on the pressor response to hindlimb intra-arterial (IA) injection of either \u03b1,\u03b2-methylene ATP (a P(2X) agonist) or capsaicin (a TRPV1 agonist) in decerebrate rats. To test the second hypothesis, we used the patch-clamp technique to determine the effect of ROS on Na(v) channels on the soma of muscle afferents. We also performed local microinjection of a sodium channel blocker, tetrodotoxin (TTX), into ipsilateral L4/L5 dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) to investigate whether the blockade of Na(v) channels by TTX affects the EPR function. We found that Tempol did not affect the pressor response to injection of either capsaicin or \u03b1,\u03b2-methylene ATP but significantly decreased the Na(v) current in small and medium-sized 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI)-labeled DRG neurons. A membrane-permeant superoxide dismutase, polyethylene glycol (PEG)-SOD, had an effect on the Na(v) current in these neurons similar to that of Tempol. Microinjection of TTX into L4/L5 DRGs dramatically attenuated the pressor response to static contraction induced by electrical stimulation of L4/L5 ventral roots. These data suggest that ROS modulates the EPR by affecting the activity of the Na(v) channels on muscle afferents.", 
    "6": "Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited arrhythmogenic disease that can cause sudden cardiac death due to ventricular fibrillation (VF). While pharmacological therapy with beta-blockers and/or Ca(2)(+) antagonists is often unreliable, a recent study has demonstrated that flecainide can effectively suppress arrhythmia in a murine model of CPVT as well as clinically in two human subjects suffering from CPVT. We here present the case of an 11-year-old boy suffering from CPVT-1 as well as a review of the current relevant literature. After resuscitation due to VF at age 9, an automated implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) was implanted in 2007. Under beta-blocker therapy, repeated shocks were delivered due to either fast ventricular tachycardia (VT) or VF. This persisted under additional therapy with verapamil. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator routine interrogations showed frequent non-sustained VT with an average of 8.8 per day. Additionally, the patient suffered from impaired physical performance due to decreased chronotropic competence. In July 2009, flecainide was added to the beta-blocker/verapamil regimen, resulting in a plasma level of 0.20 mg/L. No ICD shock or sustained VT occurred until December 2010. Genetic testing revealed an RyR2 receptor mutation. The case demonstrates the challenge of diagnosis and management of CPVT. It furthermore supports recent experimental evidence that the class 1 antiarrhythmic drug flecainide can suppress CPVT. The presented case supports a novel strategy in treating CPVT with the class I antiarrhythmic agent flecainide.",

    "15": "Mitral valve closure may be aided by contraction of anterior leaflet (AL) cardiac myocytes located in the annular third of the leaflet. This contraction, observed as a stiffening of the annular region of the AL during isovolumic contraction (IVC), is abolished by beta-blockade (\u03b2B). Sub-threshold rapid pacing in the region of aorto-mitral continuity (STIM) also causes AL stiffening, although this increases the stiffness of the entire leaflet during both IVC and isovolumic relaxation (IVR). We investigated whether these contractile events share a common pathway or whether multiple AL contractile mechanisms may be present. Ten sheep had radiopaque-markers implanted: 13 silhouetting the LV, 16 on the mitral annulus, an array of 16 on the AL, and one on each papillary muscle tip. 4-D marker coordinates were obtained from biplane videofluoroscopy during control (C), \u03b2B (esmolol) and during \u03b2B+STIM. Circumferential and radial stiffness values for three AL regions (Annular, Belly, and free-Edge), were obtained from inverse finite element analysis of AL displacements in response to trans-leaflet pressure changes during IVC and IVR. \u03b2B+STIM increased stiffness values in all regions at both IVC and IVR by 35 \u00b1 7% relative to \u03b2B (p<0.001). Thus, even when AL myocyte contraction was blocked by \u03b2B, STIM stiffened all regions of the AL during both IVC and IVR. This demonstrates the presence of at least two contractile systems in the AL; one being the AL annular cardiac muscle, involving a \u03b2-dependent pathway, others via a \u03b2-independent pathway, likely involving valvular interstitial cells and/or AL smooth muscle cells.", 
    "16": "Chitosan (CS), a positively charged polysaccharide, and magnesium aluminum silicate (MAS), a negatively charged clay with silicate layers, can electrostatically interact to form nanocomposite films. In this study, CS-MAS nanocomposite films were evaluated for use in tablet film coating. Effects of CS-MAS ratio and coating level on water uptake and drug release from the coated tablets were investigated. Surface and film matrix morphology of the coated film and the effect of enzymes in the simulated gastro-intestinal fluid on drug release were also examined. The results demonstrated that the CS-MAS coated tablets had a rough surface and a layered matrix film, whereas a smooth surface and dense matrix film on the CS coated tablets was found. However, the CS-MAS coated tablets provided fewer film defects than the CS coated tablets. Nanocomposite formation between CS and MAS could retard swelling and erosion of CS in the composite films in acidic medium. The higher MAS ratio of the CS-MAS coated tablets gave lower water uptake and slower drug release when compared with the CS coated tablets. Moreover, the CS-MAS films on the tablets presented good stability towards enzymatic degradation in simulated intestinal fluid. The release of drug from the CS-MAS coated tablets could be modulated by varying CS-MAS ratios and coating levels. Additionally, drug solubility also influenced drug release characteristics of the CS-MAS coated tablets. These findings suggest that the CS-MAS nanocomposites displays a strong potential for use in tablet film coating intended for modifying drug release from tablets.", 
    "17": "Although metabolic syndrome confers an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in the general population, little is known about the alteration of abdominal adiposity and its association with adipocytokines in hemodialysis patients. We investigated the plasma high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin level and its relationship to visceral fat area (VFA) and various markers of atherosclerosis in hemodialysis patients. In a cross-sectional study, conventional cardiovascular risk factors, plasma total and HMW adiponectin, the number of components of the metabolic syndrome and, using computed tomography, the distribution of abdominal adiposity were assessed in 144 hemodialysis patients (90 men and 54 women; mean age, 60.7 years) and 30 age- and sex-matched patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Plasma HMW adiponectin levels in hemodialysis patients were significantly higher than those in patients with CKD, negatively associated with VFA and serum triglycerides and positively associated with plasma total adiponectin, as well as the HMW-to-total adiponectin ratio in men and women (all P < 0.05) in a simple regression analysis. In a multiple regression analysis, VFA was a significant determinant of HMW adiponectin in hemodialysis patients. Furthermore, after adjustment for classical risk factors, HMW adiponectin levels were significantly higher in patients undergoing treatment with renin-angiotensin system inhibitors or calcium channel blockers compared with patients not undergoing such treatment. This study shows that plasma HMW adiponectin levels were negatively associated with VFA and positively associated with treatment with blockade of the renin-angiotensin system and of the calcium channel. Therefore, these drugs might be effective for improving adipocytokine-related metabolic abnormalities in hemodialysis patients.", 
    "18": "G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the targets for many drugs, and genetic variation in coding and noncoding regions is apparent in many such receptors. In this superfamily, adrenergic receptors (ARs) were among the first in which single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were discovered, and studies including in vitro mutagenesis, genetically modified mouse models, human ex vivo and in vitro studies and pharmacogenetic association studies were conducted. The signal transduction in these receptors includes amplification steps, desensitization, crosstalk, and redundancies, enabling potential mitigation of the size of the clinical effect for a single variant in a single gene. Nevertheless, convincing evidence has emerged that several variants have an impact on therapy, with certain caveats as to how the results are to be interpreted. Here we review these results for selected ARs and associated regulatory kinases relative to the pharmacogenomics of \u03b2-blocker treatment for hypertension and heart failure. We emphasize the linking of clinical results to molecular mechanisms, discuss study design limitations, and offer some recommendations for future directions.", 
    "19": "Using 24-h ambulatory electrocardiography, the RR intervals of all beats were determined in a West Highland white terrier with sick sinus syndrome characterized by long sinus pauses, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and varying degrees of atrioventricular (AV) heart block. Distinctive patterns of bradycardia and 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1 and 5:1 AV block associated with SVT were evident in the tachogram (RR interval distribution over time) and Poincar\u00e9 plots (short-term heart rate variability plots of RRn versus RRn+1). These patterns differed from those of abrupt alteration in cycle length during long sinus pauses or bursts of supraventricular tachycardia. Recognition of such patterns may direct attention to time points for which close attention to the cardiac rhythm should be evaluated in the full-disclosure of the 24-h ECG recording.",

The electrolyses were carried out with two systems: (i) a single cell with a boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode and an air-diffusion cathode (ADE) for H(2)O(2) electrogeneration and (ii) a combined cell with a BDD/ADE pair coupled with a Pt/carbon felt (CF) cell. Overall mineralization was reached in all PEF treatments using both systems due to the efficient production of hydroxyl radical ((\u2022)OH) from Fenton's reaction induced by UVA light and the quick photolysis of Fe(III) carboxylate complexes formed. In EF, the combined cell was much more potent than the single one by the larger (\u2022)OH generation from the continuous Fe(2+) regeneration at the CF cathode, accelerating the oxidation of organics. However, almost total mineralization in EF was feasible using the combined cell in the presence of 0.1 mM Cu(2+), because of the parallel quick oxidation of Cu(II) carboxylate complexes by (\u2022)OH. Metoprolol decay always followed a pseudo-first-order reaction. Aromatic products related to consecutive hydroxylation/oxidation reactions of metoprolol were detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The evolution of the aromatic 4-(2-methoxyethyl)phenol and generated carboxylic acids was followed by HPLC. The degradation rate and mineralization degree of metoprolol tartrate were limited by the removal of Fe(III) and Cu(II) complexes of ultimate carboxylic acids such as formic, oxalic, and oxamic. NH(4)(+) ion and to a lesser extent NO(3)(-) ion were released in all treatments, being quantified by ionic chromatography.",

    "29": "HIV-1 brain infection induces neurodegeneration. While most studies focus on HIV-1-mediated neuronal injury, relatively few have investigated HIV-1-associated white matter damage. Corpus callosum (CC) is one of frequently involved white matter structures in HIV-1-associated white matter damage. Utilizing a model of ex vivo treatment of brain slice containing CC with HIV-1 glycoprotein 120 (gp120), we examined axonal injury by analyzing \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein (\u03b2-APP) accumulation in the axon. Incubation of CC slice with gp120 produced a significant higher density of \u03b2-APP in the CC tissue compared with non-gp120-treated controls, suggesting the presence of axonal damage in the CC. The gp120-induced CC axonal damage was blocked by a chemokine CXCR4 receptor antagonist T140 but not by an NMDA receptor blocker MK801 as demonstrated by Western blot analysis of \u03b2-APP, indicating that gp120 evokes the CC axonal injury through CXCR4 receptor. Immunocytochemical studies revealed a surprisingly high density of CXCR4-positive immunoreactivity in the CC. The CXCR4-positive labeling was distributed along the nerve fibers. Moreover, double labeling of anti-CXCR4 with either anti-neuronal nuclei or anti-myelin/oligodendrocyte-specific protein antibody revealed co-localization of CXCR4 and myelin/oligodendrocytes in some fiber-like structures, inferring that some neurons and oligodendrocytes in the CC express CXCR4. Taken together, these results indicate that gp120 induced axonal damage via CXCR4 in the CC.",

    "31": "Fifteen patients with liver cirrhosis were included They were given a fixed oral dose of propranolol 80mg on the morning of day 1 after overnight fasting. Blood samples were collected at fixed time intervals for 24h. Patients were given 12 sessions of rectal ozone of 300ml of 40% ozone/oxygen mixture. On day 14 another oral dose of 80mg propranolol was given and blood samples were collected as on day 1. Plasma concentrations of propranolol were measured by HPLC. Portal vein oxygen tension and saturation were measured before and after rectal ozone.",

The changes were consistent with a decrease in propranolol bioavailability. There was a decrease in the elimination half-life and mean residence time. Portal vein oxygenation significantly increased after rectal ozone.", 
    "33": "The changes in the pharmacokinetics of propranolol probably reflect an increase in the rate and extent of its metabolism resulting from improved portal vein oxygenation attributable to the ozone therapy.

While a number of preclinical lines of evidence support this concept, and despite the results of many studies suggesting a beneficial impact of antioxidant drugs on endothelial function, large clinical trials have failed to demonstrate a benefit of antioxidants on cardiovascular outcomes. Studies exploring the possibility that classical antioxidants such as vitamin C, vitamin E, selenium, or folic acid may improve the prognosis of patients with cardiac disease have substantially reported neutral-and occasionally negative-results. In contrast, medications such as statins, ACE inhibitors, certain \u03b2-blockers, or angiotensin I receptor blockers, which possess indirect 'ancillary' antioxidant properties, have been associated with beneficial effects in both preclinical studies and large clinical trials. The reasons for the failure of the 'direct' approach to antioxidant therapy, and for the success of the therapy with these drugs, are discussed in the present review.", 
    "35": "Hereditary angioedema is a severe genetic disorder due to C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency, which leads to an excess of bradykinin. It is characterised by attacks of subcutaneous or mucosal oedema, which can carry a risk of asphyxiation if the larynx is involved. The first-choice symptomatic treatment for attacks is intravenous C1 esterase inhibitor administration. Tranexamic acid is sometimes used. Icatibant, a decapeptide bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, is now authorised in the European Union for use in this situation. We found no trials comparing icatibant versus C1 esterase inhibitor. The two principal clinical trials were both comparative trials, one versus tranexamic acid (74 patients), and the other versus placebo (56 patients). No mortality data were reported in either trial. Icatibant seemed to be more effective than tranexamic acid in relieving symptoms and also yielded a higher response rate. However, these positive results were not confirmed in the placebo-controlled trial. Both trials suffer from several biases, ruling out firm conclusions on the efficacy of icatibant, the trials were underpowered, some criteria were difficult to measure, the blinding was incomplete, and tranexamic acid was given at a lower dose than that recommended. The main adverse effects of icatibant are reactions at the injection site, which occur in almost all patients. A potential risk of cardiac disorders (especially angina) needs to be investigated. Subcutaneous administration of icatibant requires a large volume of solution (3 ml). In practice, in the absence of head-to-head comparisons, it remains to be shown whether or not icatibant has a better risk-benefit balance than C1 esterase inhibitor. Due to inconsistencies between the results and numerous biases in the two main clinical trials, the evidence supporting the efficacy of icatibant is weak. C1 esterase inhibitor remains the first-choice treatment for patients with acute attacks of hereditary angioedema.", 
    "36": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are nuclear receptors with essential functions in lipid, glucose and energy homeostasis, cell differentiation, inflammation and metabolic disorders, and represent important drug targets. PPARs heterodimerize with retinoid X receptors (RXRs) and can form transcriptional activator or repressor complexes at specific DNA elements (PPREs). It is believed that the decision between repression and activation is generally governed by a ligand-mediated switch. We have performed genomewide analyses of agonist-treated and PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4-depleted human myofibroblasts to test this hypothesis and to identify global principles of PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4-mediated gene regulation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) of PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4, H3K4me3 and RNA polymerase II enrichment sites combined with transcriptional profiling enabled the definition of 112 bona fide PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 target genes showing either of three distinct types of transcriptional response: (I) ligand-independent repression by PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4; (II) ligand-induced activation and/or derepression by PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4; and (III) ligand-independent activation by PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4. These data identify PPRE-mediated repression as a major mechanism of transcriptional regulation by PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4, but, unexpectedly, also show that only a subset of repressed genes are activated by a ligand-mediated switch. Our results also suggest that the type of transcriptional response by a given target gene is connected to the structure of its associated PPRE(s) and the biological function of its encoded protein. These observations have important implications for understanding the regulatory PPAR network and PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 ligand-based drugs.",

However, like bupivacaine, metoprolol, and the surgical sympathectomy, it did not improve FCD as a parameter for tissue perfusion. The strongest vasoconstriction (35.9 \u00b1 4.3 vs 28.6 \u00b1 4.0) and impairment of the FCD (10.0 \u00b1 0.7 vs 4.1 \u00b1 0.9) was induced by the \u03b2-blocker metoprolol.",

    "49": "Nebivolol is a highly selective \u03b21-adrenoceptor blocker, which also stimulates endothelial nitric oxide synthase and scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS). These characteristics endow nebivolol, compared with conventional \u03b2-blockers, with a favorable hemodynamic profile for the treatment of hypertension, chronic heart failure, and possibly other cardiovascular diseases. Nebivolol is a racemic mixture of d- and l-isomers. Its \u03b21-antagonistic properties reside primarily with d-nebivolol although both isomers are capable of increasing the release of NO from the endothelium after binding to \u03b22- or \u03b23-adrenergic receptors. The latter action results in vasodilatation and reduced vascular resistance. Nebivolol also scavenges ROS in a receptor-independent manner by direct interaction with free radicals. By scavenging ROS nebivolol not only reduces oxidant stress but also augments NO bioavailability. The endothelial nitric oxide synthase -stimulating and ROS scavenging effects of nebivolol act synergistically to provide cardiovascular protection in addition to its \u03b21-antagonistic action.",

The ex vivo transscleral \u03b2-blocker transport to the vitreous at the end of 6 hours was determined in euthanatized, pigmented Brown Norway rats. The thicknesses of the sclera and SCRPE and the melanin content in choroid-RPE (CRPE) were measured to determine whether species differences in drug transport can be explained on this basis.", 
    "65": "Solute lipophilicity inversely correlated with the SCRPE cumulative percentage of transport in all species (R(2) \u2265 0.80). The CRPE impeded the SCRPE transport of all \u03b2-blockers (51%-64% resistance in the rabbits; 84%-99.8% in the bovine and porcine eyes) more than the sclera, with the impedance increasing with lipophilicity. SCRPE transport followed the trend albino rabbit > pigmented rabbit > human > porcine > bovine, and a cross-species comparison showed good Spearman's rho correlation (R(2) \u2265 0.85).

The CRPE concentrations were higher in pigmented rabbits than in albino rabbits. The melanin content of the CRPE exhibited the trend albino rabbit \u226a pigmented rabbit < porcine \u223c bovine < rat.

Leucine-rich \u03b12-glycoprotein (LRG) was consistently overexpressed in high BNP serum. LRG levels correlate significantly with BNP in hypertensive, asymptomatic left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, diastolic HF, and systolic HF patient groups (P\u22640.05). LRG levels were able to identify HF independent of BNP. LRG correlates with coronary sinus serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (P=0.009) and interleukin-6 (P=0.021).

Evaluation of heart rate variability (HRV) and blood pressure variability (BPV), using time and frequency domain analyses may provide a sensitive and reliable measure of affective states and stress-mediated changes in sympathetic and parasympathetic tones. The aim of this research was to define low (LF) and high frequency (HF) power spectral ranges using pharmacological autonomic blockade, and to examine HRV and BPV parameter changes in response to atropine and propranolol in swine. Ten, 13-week old, barrows (n=6) and gilts (n=4) underwent surgery to place an intra-cardiac electrode and a blood pressure catheter attached to a biotelemetric transmitter; pigs had a 3-week recovery period prior to data collection. Each pig was subjected to administration of 4 intravenous (i.v.) drug treatments: a control treatment, 3 mL of saline, and 3 blockade treatments; 0.1 mg/kg of atropine, 1.0 mg/kg of propranolol, and .1 mg/kg of atropine together with 1.0 mg/kg of propranolol. All treatments were delivered by injection in the jugular vein with a minimum of 48 h between individual treatments. Behavior, ECG and blood pressure data were recorded continuously for a total of 1h, from 30 min pre-injection to 30 min post-injection. For data analyses, two 512-beat intervals were selected for each treatment while the pig was lying and inactive. The first interval was selected from the pre-injection period (baseline), and the second was selected between 10 and 30 min post-injection. Time and frequency domain (power spectral density) analyses were performed on each data interval. Subsequent, LF and HF bands from the power spectral densities were defined based on general linear and regression analyses. The HRV and BPV were computed with a covariate (baseline) factorial analysis of treatment by sex interaction, and day of injection, with mixed models and Tukey's post-hoc tests. The best-fit range for LF was 0.0-0.09 Hz, and HF was 0.09-2.0 Hz (r\u00b2: 0.41 and 0.43, respectively). Propranolol and saline injections led to a greater overall total power and overall higher inter-beat interval, HF and LF power. Atropine led to a dominant sympathovagal balance of the cardiac activity in pigs. In addition, atropine led to an increase in LF power of both systolic and diastolic blood pressures in gilts suggesting vagal tone mediation of BPV. The understanding of autonomic regulation of HRV and BPV in domestic swine facilitates our ability to detect and quantify stress responses, and broadens its application in assessing farm animal welfare.", 
    "71": "Malignant-phase hypertension is characterized clinically by severe accelerating hypertension with neuroretinopathy or papilledema and by evidence of renal damage. A Japanese male in his early thirties presented with hemoptysis and general fatigue. He had a 5-year history of hypertension, but had not received any treatment. His blood pressure was 290/150\u00a0mmHg and his serum creatinine level was 8.24\u00a0mg/dL. Chest X-rays and computed tomography scans of the chest revealed a pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage. He was suspected of having vasculitis syndrome or Goodpasture's syndrome, but his renal biopsy specimen showed malignant nephrosclerosis. Myeloperoxidase antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), proteinase-3 ANCA and antiglomerular basement membrane antibody were negative. He was treated with a calcium antagonist and a \u03b2-blocker, followed by an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. After the administration of the \u03b2-blocker, his blood pressure decreased and his renal function gradually improved. This is a rare case of malignant-phase hypertension with pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage; this condition should be considered in the differential diagnosis in order to avoid unnecessary treatment such as immunosuppressive therapy.", 
    "72": "Targeting signalling molecules to ion channels can expedite regulation and assure the proper transition of changes to excitability. In the bag cell neurons of Aplysia, single-channel studies of excised patches have revealed that protein kinase C (PKC) gates a non-selective cation channel through a close, physical association. This channel drives a prolonged afterdischarge and concomitant neuropeptide secretion to provoke reproductive behaviour. However, it is not clear if PKC alters cation channel function and/or the membrane potential at the whole-cell level. Afterdischarge-like depolarizations can be evoked in cultured bag cell neurons by bath-application of Conus textile venom (CtVm), which triggers the cation channel through an apparent intracellular pathway. The present study shows that the CtVm-induced depolarization was reduced by nearly 50% compared to control following dialysis with the G-protein blocker, guanosine-5'-O-2-thiodiphosphate (GDP-\u03b2-S), or treatment with either the phospholipase C inhibitor, 1-[6-[[(17\u03b2)-3-Methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-yl]amino]hexyl]-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione (U-73122), or the PKC inhibitor, sphinganine. Neurons exposed to the PKC activator, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), displayed depolarization with accompanying spiking, and were found to be far more responsive to depolarizing current injection versus control. Immunocytochemical staining for the two typical Aplysia PKC isoforms, Apl I and Apl II, revealed that both kinases were present in unstimulated cultured bag cell neurons. However, in CtVm-treated neurons, the staining intensity for PKC Apl I increased, peaking at 10 min post-application. Conversely, the intensity of PKC Apl II staining decreased over the duration of CtVm exposure. Our results suggest that the CtVm-induced depolarization involves PKC activation, and is consistent with prior work showing PKC closely-associating with the cation channel to produce the depolarization necessary for the afterdischarge and species propagation.", 
    "73": "Altered glutamatergic neurotransmission in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been implicated in a myriad of neuropsychiatric disorders. We previously reported that prenatal exposure to PCP produced long-lasting behavioral deficits, accompanied by the abnormal expression and dysfunction of NMDA receptors. In addition, these behavioral changes were attenuated by clozapine treatment. However, whether the prenatal exposure adversely affects pre-synaptic glutamatergic neurotransmission in postpubertal mice remains unknown. In the present study, we investigated the involvement of prefrontal glutamatergic neurotransmission in the impairment of cognitive and emotional behavior after prenatal PCP treatment (5mg/kg/day) from E6 to E18 in mice. The PCP-treated mice showed an impairment of recognition memory in a novel object recognition test and enhancement of immobility in a forced swimming test at 8 weeks of age. Moreover, the prenatal treatment reduced the extracellular glutamate level, but increased the expression of a glial glutamate transporter (GLAST) in the PFC. The microinjection of DL-threo-\u03b2-benzyloxyaspartate (DL-TBOA, 10 nmol/site/bilaterally), a potent blocker of glutamate transporters, reversed these behavioral deficits by enhancing the prefrontal glutamatergic neurotransmission. Taken together, prenatal exposure to PCP produced impairments of long-term memory and emotional function which are associated with abnormalities of pre-synaptic glutamate transmission in the PFC of postpubertal mice. These findings suggest the prenatal inhibition of NMDA receptor function to contribute partly to the pathophysiology of neurodevelopment-related disorders, such as schizophrenia.", 
    "74": "Cardiac glycosides, statins, \u03b2-blockers, angiotensin-I converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) are widely used cardiovascular medications with pleiotropic properties. Many of these medications have been investigated in other diseases, including cancer. Cardiac glycosides and statins have advanced to clinical trial testing in cancer therapeutics, with variable success. Early observations in breast cancer were consistent with a more benign histologic phenotype among women taking digitalis compared to their counterparts who did not receive cardiac glycosides. Cardiac glycosides can induce apoptosis in cancer cells through various mechanisms and sensitize them to the effects of antitumor therapy. By blocking the generation of prenyl units, statins impair prenylation, an important posttranslational modification of proteins whose function depends on membrane anchoring. Statins also impair protein folding and N-glycosylation and inhibit the upregulation of cholesterol synthesis associated with chemotherapy resistance. Stress and catecholamine release promote tumor growth and angiogenesis, effects that can be mitigated by \u03b2-blockers. Components of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are expressed in various cancers and are involved in carcinogenesis and tumor progression. Angiotensin II has potent mitogenic and angiogenic properties that can be blocked with ACEIs and ARBs. Although it is unclear whether the promising preclinical activity of many cardiovascular medications has clinically meaningful implications beyond the benefit in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, the prevention or improvement of prognosis of common malignancies with medications known to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is encouraging and deserves further clinical investigation.", 
    "75": "A chiral selector, di-n-amyl L-tartrate-boric acid complex, was in situ synthesized by the reaction of di-n-amyl L-tartrate with boric acid in a nonaqueous background electrolyte (BGE) using methanol as the medium. And a new method of chiral nonaqueous capillary electrophoresis (NACE) was developed with the complex as the chiral selector. It has been demonstrated that the chiral selector is suitable for the enantioseparation of some \u03b2-blockers and \u03b2-agonists in NACE. Some chiral analytes that could not be resolved in aqueous microemulsion electrokinetic chromatography (MEEKC) with the same chiral selector obtained baseline resolutions in the NACE system. The enantioseparation mechanism was considered to be ion-pair principle and the nonaqueous system was more favorable for the ion-pair formation which is quite useful for the chiral recognition. The addition of a proper concentration of triethylamine into the BGE to control the apparent pH (pH*) enhanced the enantiomeric discrimination. In order to achieve a good enantioseparation, the effects of di-n-amyl L-tartrate and boric acid concentration, triethylamine concentration, applied voltage, as well as capillary length were investigated. Under the optimum conditions, all of the tested chiral analytes including six \u03b2-blockers and five \u03b2-agonists were baseline resolved.",

A combined therapy with enalapril (2.5 mg/day) and bisoprolol (1.25 mg/day) was initiated. After a slow increase in the dosage to 10 mg enalapril/day and 2.5 mg bisoprolol/day, systolic dysfunction resolved to a fractional shortening of 26% already after 7 months.",

    "80": "Polyamines relax several smooth muscles and elicit cardiotonic effects in the rat heart via interactions with \u03b2-adrenoceptors. The aim of this work was to establish whether \u03b2(2)-adrenoceptors were involved in polyamine-relaxation of bovine tracheal strips. Endogenous polyamines displaced the specific radioligand, [(3)H]dihydroalprenolol, but spermine was the most potent. The polyamines elicited an acute transient relaxation, which was independent of \u03b2-adrenoceptor activation, followed by a maintained component, which was shown to be dependent on \u03b2-adrenoceptor activation because it was antagonized and reversed by propranolol. Polyamines did not alter salbutamol-induced acute relaxation. Polyamines modified the salbutamol-induced long-term effect on airway tone, which was shown by a partial reversal of \u03b2-adrenoceptor desensitization. This process was delayed by \u03b1-difluoromethylornithine, but spermine increased the latency and time of reversal and decreased receptor desensitization. Putrescine prolonged the time-constant without changes in the desensitization. Spermine, but not putrescine, might block Ca(2+) channels, because it relaxed KCl- or electrical stimulated-contractions, which are related to Ca(2+) influx, and the inhibition of cAMP phosphodiesterase activity. These differences might explain the functional differences observed between putrescine and spermine. Therefore, polyamines may modulate airway smooth muscle tone and interfere with the mechanism of receptor desensitization via several mechanisms involving \u03b2(2)-adrenoceptors, Ca(2+) influx and cAMP phosphodiesterase.",

Reviews offer only the general recommendations of increasing dosage and adding drugs, offering clinicians little guidance with respect to the specifics of selecting medications and dosages. A simplified decision tree for drug selection that would be effective in most cases is needed. This review proposes such an approach. The approach is mechanism-based, targeting treatment at three hypertensive mechanisms: (1) sodium/volume, (2) the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), and (3) the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). It assumes baseline treatment with a 2-drug combination directed at sodium/volume and the RAS and recommends proceeding with one or both of just two treatment options: (1) strengthening the diuretic regimen, possibly with the addition of spironolactone, and/or (2) adding agents directed at the SNS, usually a \u03b2-blocker or combination of an \u03b1- and a \u03b2-blocker. The review calls for greater research and clinical attention directed to: (1) assessment of clinical clues that can help direct treatment toward either sodium/volume or the SNS, (2) increased recognition of the role of neurogenic (SNS-mediated) hypertension in resistant hypertension, (3) increased recognition of the effective but underutilized combination of \u03b1- + \u03b2-blockade, and (4) drug pharmacokinetics and dosing.",

Therefore, the authors conducted a post hoc exploratory analysis to assess determinants of BP control. Data were collected in 45 general practices, which enrolled patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Antihypertensive medication changes throughout the 6-month follow-up period were documented. Baseline and 6-month BPs were recorded. Of the 2030 patients analyzed, 320 had diabetes. Overall, 42% of patients did not achieve BP control. In multivariate analysis, failure to intensify therapy was identified as a significant independent predictor of lesser BP reduction. Of patients unable to reach target after 6 months, only 25% were prescribed \u2265 3 drugs. Patients with diabetes were significantly less likely to reach target than those without (26% vs 64%, P<.001). Antihypertensive therapy prescribed to patients with diabetes was only marginally more intensive than to those without. In patients with hypertension, whether with or without coexisting diabetes, poor BP control appears to be at least partially due to failure to uptitrate antihypertensive therapy. Clinical inertia is likely an important barrier to BP control.", 
    "93": "Based on multiple randomized controlled trials performed in the last 20 years, drugs form the basis of treatment for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFREF). Despite solid evidence for their efficacy and safety and publication of detailed national and international guidelines many patients with HFREF remain, who are not at all or only insufficiently treated. Treatment goals include reduction of mortality and hospitalizations, improvement of symptoms and exercise tolerance as well as prevention of disease progression. ACE-inhibitors and beta-adrenergic receptor blockers exert beneficial effects on all treatment goals and are therefore indicated in all patients with HFREF if tolerated. Diuretics allow control of fluid retention and maintenance of \"euvolemia\". Low-dose spironolactone can be considered in persistent moderate to severe (NYHA 3 - 4) HFREF despite treatment. Angiotensin receptor blockers are indicated for ACE-inhibitor intolerance or in addition to ACE-inhibitors and beta-adrenergic receptor blockers in case of persistent symptoms. Triple combination of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and aldosterone antagonists should be avoided in view of the substantial risk of hyperkalemia. In current praxis digoxin is mainly used as an adjunctive agent for rate control of atrial fibrillation in combination with beta-adrenergic receptor blockers. Titration and maintenance of heart failure treatment requires continuous control of clinical parameters, renal function and electrolytes. It is recommended to use drugs and dosest hat have been shown to be effective in clinial trials. Despite the fact that heart failure is mainly a disease of the elderly, this population is underrepresented in clinical trials. The risk of side effects and drug-drug interactions is increased in elderly patients because of physiologic changes with age and frequent comorbidities with resultant polypharmacy.", 
    "94": "Angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced astrocyte senescence may be involved in cerebral ischemic injury and age-associated neurodegenerative disease. This study was conducted to determine the roles of reactive oxygen species production in Ang II-induced cellular senescence in cultured human astrocytes. Human astrocytes were stimulated with Ang II either with or without an angiotensin type 1 receptor blocker, CV11974, or an antioxidant, tempol. Application of Ang II to human astrocytes resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in staining for dihydroethidium. Ang II (100\u2009nM for 30\u2009min) increased the translocation of two cytosolic components of NADPH oxidase, p47phox and p67phox, to the cell membrane and formation of the complex of p47phox, p67phox and p22phox. Ang II concentration-dependently induced an increase in \u03b2-galactosidase staining. Pretreatment with CV11974 (100\u2009nM) or tempol (3\u2009mM) abolished Ang II-induced astrocyte \u03b2-galactosidase staining. Moreover, Ang II significantly upregulated p16 mRNA expression, which was inhibited by pretreatment with CV11974 or tempol.

The DOCA (40\u2009mg per kg per week, subcutaneously (s.c.)) and salt (1% NaCl in drinking water) treatment significantly aggravated the levels of urinary protein excretion and creatinine clearance and increased glomerulosclerosis and collagen deposition in the tubulointerstitial area of the kidney. These effects were attenuated by cilnidipine treatment. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the renal expression of mRNA for collagen I/IV and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 was enhanced in the DOCA-salt group and that the overexpression of these molecules was suppressed by cilnidipine. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase-derived superoxide production in the kidney and urinary norepinephrine excretion, which were enhanced in the DOCA-salt group, were suppressed by cilnidipine. Cilnidipine also decreased the activity and expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and the aldosterone concentration in the renal homogenate. Although neither cilnidipine nor amlodipine had any effect on the increased blood pressure in the DOCA-salt group, these renal changes were not induced by treatment with amlodipine. In conclusion, cilnidipine inhibited renal dysfunction, sympathetic nerve activity and renal renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in the DOCA-salt group.",

However, mitochondrial uncoupling takes place not only in BAT but also in skeletal muscle tissue. Both tissues may be involved in cold-induced thermogenesis, which is presumably regulated by the sympathetic nervous system.",

Energy expenditure was measured continuously. After 36 and 84 h, muscle biopsies were taken in which mitochondrial uncoupling was studied.", 
    "99": "Energy expenditure increased upon mild cold exposure (+5.0 \u00b1 1.2 W; P < 0.005), i.e. cold-induced thermogenesis. However, contrary to our hypothesis, this cold-induced thermogenesis was not diminished after \u03b2-blockade (+4.7 \u00b1 2.1 W for blockade vs. +5.1 \u00b1 1.4 W for control; P = 0.59 for interaction cold blockade). Skeletal muscle mitochondrial uncoupling was significantly related to cold-induced thermogenesis in the control situation (R(2) = 0.650; P < 0.01). There was no such relation during \u03b2-blockade.",

However, the plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine responses to hypoglycemia were not reduced on day 2 when adrenergic or adrenergic plus cholinergic blockade was produced during hypoglycemia on day 1.", 
    "104": "Adrenergic blockade prevents the effect of hypoglycemia to reduce the plasma catecholamine responses to subsequent hypoglycemia.

    "105": "The aim of the study was to determine in a rat model of streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy the expression of: WT-1 (for podocyte loss in the glomerulus), TGF-beta 1 (for tissue damage), caspase-3 and bax (for glomerular apoptosis) and the possible protective effects of an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker. Three groups of male Wistar albino rats were used. The first group consisted of non-diabetic control rats. The second group was the untreated diabetic rats. The third group consisted of diabetic rats treated with Irbesartan, which is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, widely used in treatment for hypertension. Immunohistochemical stainings for TGF-beta 1, bax, caspase-3 and WT-1 were performed. The microalbuminuria levels of the Irbesartan-treated diabetic group were lower than those of the untreated diabetic group (P<0.01). The immunostaining of TGF-beta 1, bax and caspase-3 was decreased in glomeruli of the Irbesartan-treated diabetic group compared to the untreated diabetic group. WT-1 immunopositive podocyte numbers were found to be significantly lower in the untreated diabetic group than in the other groups (P<0.01). In the Irbesartan-treated diabetic group, the WT-1 immunopositive cell numbers were higher compared to the untreated diabetic group (P<0.01). We conclude that the decrease in the number of podocytes is an early marker of diabetic nephropathy, AT1 receptor blocker has renoprotective effects on the regulation of renal hemodynamics and on the control of tissue damage by preventing podocyte loss, which leads to decrease of bax and caspase-3 expressions of apoptosis related proteins, and may prevent glomerular cell apoptosis via angiotensin II.",

The primary end point was occurrence/non-occurrence of atrial fibrillation up to 1 week postoperatively. Logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate risk factors for atrial fibrillation among preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative variables.", 
    "108": "Atrial fibrillation occurred in 7 patients (10%) in the landiolol group versus 24 patients (34.3%) in the placebo group; the landiolol group had a significantly lower incidence (P\u00a0=\u00a0.0006). Postoperative heart rate was significantly lower in the landiolol group than in the placebo group. On returning to the intensive care unit, the landiolol group had significantly lower inflammatory and ischemic parameters. Medical costs were also significantly lower in the landiolol group. Multivariate analysis revealed that significant risk factors for atrial fibrillation were a European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation of 10 or more, preoperative non-use of angiotensin receptor blockers, and non-use of landiolol.", 
    "109": "Postoperative atrial fibrillation was reduced by treatment with landiolol hydrochloride. Amelioration of ischemia, an anti-inflammatory effect, and inhibition of sympathetic hypertonia by landiolol presumably reduced the occurrence of atrial fibrillation. Hypotension or bradycardia did not develop in any of the patients, indicating the safety of this beta-blocker. These findings suggest that landiolol hydrochloride could be useful in the perioperative management of patients undergoing cardiac surgery.", 
    "110": "Countercurrent chromatography (CCC) is a liquid chromatography technique in which the stationary phase is also a liquid. The main chemical process involved in solute separation is partitioning between the two immiscible liquid phases: the mobile phase and the support-free liquid stationary phase. The octanol-water partition coefficients (P(o/w)) is the accepted parameter measuring the hydrophobicity of molecules. It is considered to estimate active principle partitioning over a biomembrane. It was related to the substance biological activity. CCC is able to work with an octanol stationary phase and an aqueous mobile phase. In this configuration, CCC is a useful and easy alternative to measure directly the P(o/w) of the molecules compared to other methods including the classical and tedious shake-flask method. Three ketones are used as model compounds to illustrate the CCC protocol of P(o/w) measurement. The focus of this work is put on ionisable molecules whose apparent P(o/w) is completely changed by ionization. \u03b2-Blockers, diuretics and sulfonamides are compound classes that were studied. Some of the experimentally determined P(o/w) coefficients of the molecular forms disagreed with calculated and experimental values available in the literature. The P(o/w) coefficients of the ionic forms and the acidity constants were also calculated using a theoretical model. Relationships between biological properties and hydrophobicity are also discussed.",

Only 23% of the patients who were of pre-retirement age remained professionally active. Ischaemic or hypertension aetiology was found in 90% of participants. Nearly all patients had multiple comorbidities. Most patients received converting enzyme inhibitors (88%) and beta-blockers (77%), 60% of them both, although dosing was frequently inadequate. During the six months preceding the study, 31% had cardiovascular hospitalisation and 66% required unscheduled surgery visits.",

    "115": "In coronary artery disease (CAD), endothelin-1 (ET-1) is released by activated macrophages and thereby contributes to coronary plaque rupture and triggered cardiac events. The multifactorial regulation of ET-1 includes stimulated release by cytokines and autonomic factors. Laboratory stress provokes alteration in autonomic tone and prolonged ET-1 mediated endothelial dysfunction. The objective of the study is to determine the autonomic contribution to an increase in ET-1 in response to laboratory stress in patients with CAD. Patients (n = 88) with chronic stable CAD instrumented with hemodynamic monitor, digital electrocardiogram (ECG) monitor and indwelling catheter for blood sampling completed a laboratory protocol that included initial rest (30 min), baseline (BL: 10 min), and anger recall stress (AR: 8 min). Change from BL to AR was determined for (a) parasympathetic activity (by spectral analysis of ECG); (b) sympathetic activity (by circulating catecholamines); and (c) ET-1. AR provoked increases from BL in catecholamines, and a decrease in parasympathetic activity. Multivariate analysis with change in parasympathetic activity and catecholamines, while controlling for age and use of \u03b2-blockers, revealed a significant odds ratio (OR = 3.27, 95% CI 1.03, 10.41 P = 0.04) for an increase in ET-1 associated with parasympathetic withdrawal; no other variables were significant. The predominant influence of parasympathetic activity on anger/stress-provoked increase in ET-1 is consistent with the cholinergic antiinflammatory pathway. Future examination of autonomic influences on atherosclerotic leukocytes, endothelial cell function and the dynamics of ET-1 are warranted.", 
    "116": "More than 450000 Americans die suddenly each year from sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. A correct identification of these patients is crucial for a rational clinical management, because the demonstrated effectiveness of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD) on the reduction of sudden cardiac death. Basing on the results of multiple clinical trials, left ventricular systolic function, measured as ejection fraction, is currently the only recommended tool to identify patients at higher risk of sudden death that would benefit from a prophylactic ICD. However, the systematic implementation of prophylactic ICD recommendations results in a substantial number of inappropriate ICD implantations, while failing to prevent the majority of sudden deaths occurring in the general population. That has been the case implementing arrhythmic risk stratification with a rough arrhythmic risk marker, such as ejection fraction, that lacks sensitivity and specificity in the prediction of sudden cardiac death. The aim of this viewpoint is to critically revise the value of ejection fraction in the identification of patients at risk of sudden cardiac death.",

More expressed effect was observed during the use of carvedilol with metabolic medications--Quercetine and Tiotriazoline. Studies on SHR rats has shown increase of cardiac hystiocyte nuclei density and decrease in RNA concentration in a cardiac muscle. Carvedilol, Quercetine and Tiotriazoline have normalising effect on investigated parameters. The use of carvedilol with Tiotriazoline have more expressed normalising effect on nuclei density of cardiac hystiocytes, and also on RNA concentration PHK in nuclei of cardiac muscle.",

It has been shown that application of metabolic modulator Vasonat in addition to conventional therapy of CHF facilitated the clinical improvement and significant decline of functional class. Vasonat use resulted in the meaningful improvement of the contractive function of myocardium and increase of tolerance to the physical exercise.

    "124": "Sequence analysis of the class A G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) reveals that most of the highly conserved sites are located in the transmembrane helices. A second level of conservation exists involving those residues that are conserved as a group characterized by small and/or weakly polar side chains (Ala, Gly, Ser, Cys, Thr). These positions can have group conservation levels of up to 99% across the class A GPCRs and have been implicated in mediating helix-helix interactions in membrane proteins. We have previously shown that mutation of group-conserved residues present on transmembrane helices H2-H4 in the \u03b2(2)-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2(2)-AR) can influence both receptor expression and function. We now target the group-conserved sites, Gly315(7.42) and Ser319(7.46), on H7 for structure-function analysis. Replacing Ser319(7.46) with smaller amino acids (Ala or Gly) did not influence the ability of the mutant receptors to bind to the antagonist dihydroalprenolol (DHA) but resulted in ~15-20% agonist-independent activity. Replacement of Ser319(7.46) with the larger amino acid leucine lowered the expression of the S319L mutant and its ability to bind DHA. Both the G315A and G315S mutants also exhibited agonist-independent signaling, while the G315L mutant did not show specific binding to DHA. These data indicate that Gly315(7.42) and Ser319(7.46) are stabilizing \u03b2(2)-AR in an inactive conformation. We discuss our results in the context of van der Waals interactions of Gly315(7.42) with Trp286(6.48) and hydrogen bonding interactions of Ser319(7.46) with amino acids on H1-H2-H7 and with structural water.",

Since propranolol has been recently used successfully to treat cutaneous infantile hemangiomas, we decided to use it in three patients who presented with hepatic and skin hemangiomatosis. Three patients with skin and hepatic infantile hemangiomas, two of whom had evidence of cardiovascular compromise and one of whom had extensive liver involvement and hypothyroidism, were treated with oral propranolol. Regression of both skin and hepatic hemangiomas was noted in all patients, as was resolution of the cardiac symptoms and decreased thyroid requirement in two patients each. Propranolol was well tolerated without any adverse effects. Propranolol should be considered as a potential first-line therapy in patients with symptomatic hepatic hemangiomatosis.",

    "131": "A new in vivo proarrhythmia model of drug-induced long QT syndrome was developed using the Microminipig, an incredibly small minipig established by Fuji Micra Inc. (Shizuoka). The atrioventricular (AV) node of the Microminipig of either sex weighing approximately 6 - 7 kg was ablated under halothane anesthesia, and proper care was taken for them. Proarrhythmic effects of drugs were assessed at >2 months after the onset of AV block using a Holter recording system. Oral administration of dl-sotalol (10 mg/kg) to the AV-block Microminipig prolonged the QT interval; moreover, it frequently induced dangerous ventricular premature beats, whereas no arrhythmia was detected after the vehicle administration (n = 4). Such dl-sotalol-induced ventricular arrhythmias were not detected in the intact Microminipig with sinus rhythm, although significant QT prolongation was observed (n = 4). Thus, the sensitivity and specificity of the AV-block Microminipig for detecting the drug-induced long QT syndrome can be considered to be comparable to previously established AV-block animal models of dogs and monkeys.",

Most available drugs for HRR, such as \u03b2-blockers, have adverse effects, including on cardiac energy substrate metabolism, a well-recognized determinant of cardiac homeostasis. This study aimed at 1) testing whether HRR by ivabradine (IVA) alters substrate metabolism in the healthy normoxic working heart and 2) comparing the effect of IVA with that of the \u03b2-blocker metoprolol (METO). This was assessed using our well-established model of ex vivo mouse heart perfusion in the working mode, which enables concomitant evaluation of myocardial contractility and metabolic fluxes using (13)C-labeled substrates. Hearts were perfused in the absence (controls; n = 10) or presence of IVA (n = 10, 3 \u03bcM) with or without atrial pacing to abolish HRR in the IVA group. IVA significantly reduced HR (35 \u00b1 5%) and increased stroke volume (39 \u00b1 9%) while maintaining similar cardiac output, contractility, power, and efficiency. Effects of IVA on HR and stroke volume were reversed by atrial pacing. At the metabolic level, IVA did not impact on substrate selection to citrate formation, rates of glycolysis, or tissue levels of high-energy phosphates. In contrast, METO, at concentrations up to 40 \u03bcM, decreased markedly cardiac function (flow: 25 \u00b1 6%; stroke volume: 30 \u00b1 10%; contractility: 31 \u00b1 9%) as well as glycolysis (2.9-fold) but marginally affected HR. Collectively, these results demonstrate that IVA selectively reduces HR while preserving energy substrate metabolism of normoxic healthy working mouse hearts perfused ex vivo, a model that mimics to some extent the denervated transplanted heart. Our results provide the impetus for testing selective HRR by IVA on cardiac substrate metabolism in pathological models.",

    "146": "The reactivity of physiological systems and behavior to psychological stress is reduced with increasing familiarity with a repeated stressor. This reduced reactivity, termed habituation, is a crucial adaptation limiting negative health consequences of stress and can be disrupted in psychopathology. We hypothesized that the ability to habituate physiologically and behaviorally to previously experienced stressors depends on \u03b2-adrenergic receptor activation (\u03b2-AR) in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), a specific neural substrate important for the consolidation of multiple types of memories. We observed that administration of the \u03b2-AR antagonist propranolol into the BLA after each of four daily exposures to restraint stress prevented the normal development of neuroendocrine and behavioral habituation measured during the fifth restraint in adult male rats. In contrast, the \u03b2-AR agonist clenbuterol administered into the BLA after each restraint on days 1-4 enhanced neuroendocrine habituation at the lowest dose but attenuated behavioral habituation at high doses. We then explored intracellular signaling mechanisms in the BLA that might be a target of \u03b2-AR activation during stress. \u03b2-AR activation post restraint is necessary for the alteration in basal phosphorylated ERK (pERK) levels, as daily post-stress \u03b2-AR blockade on days 1-4 prevented repeated stress from leading to decreased pERK in the BLA on day 5. Finally, we examined the effect of blocking ERK phosphorylation in the BLA after each restraint on days 1-4 with the MEK (MAPK/ERK kinase) inhibitor U0126, and found that this was sufficient to both mimic neuroendocrine habituation in stress-naive animals and to enhance it in repeatedly stressed animals during restraint on day 5. Together, the results suggest that an individual's ability to habituate to repeated stress is regulated by activation of BLA \u03b2-AR, which may have these effects by transducing subsequent reductions in pERK. Individual variations in \u03b2-AR activation and intracellular signaling in the BLA may contribute significantly to adaptation to psychological stress and consequent resilience to stress-related psychopathology.",

These pathologic effects on \u03b2-AR signaling and HF progression occur in part due to G\u03b2\u03b3-mediated signaling, including recruitment of receptor desensitizing kinases such as G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) kinase 2 (GRK2) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), which subsequently phosphorylate agonist occupied GPCRs. Additionally, chronic GPCR signaling signals chronically dissociated G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits to interact with multiple effector molecules that activate various signaling cascades involved in HF pathophysiology. Importantly, targeting G\u03b2\u03b3 signaling with large peptide inhibitors has proven a promising therapeutic paradigm in the treatment of HF. We recently described an approach to identify small molecule G\u03b2\u03b3 inhibitors that selectively block particular G\u03b2\u03b3 functions by specifically targeting a G\u03b2\u03b3 protein-protein interaction \"hot spot.\" Here we describe their effects on G\u03b2\u03b3 downstream signaling pathways, including their role in HF pathophysiology. We suggest a promising therapeutic role for small molecule inhibition of pathologic G\u03b2\u03b3 signaling in the treatment of HF.

We examined the combination effects of GLP-1 and candesartan, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker, on glucolipotoxicity-induced \u03b2-cell apoptosis; and we explored the possible mechanisms of the antiapoptotic effects. The effects of GLP-1 and/or candesartan on glucolipotoxicity-induced apoptosis and the phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2), protein kinase B (PKB), and forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) were evaluated by using MIN6 cells and isolated mouse pancreatic islets. Although palmitate significantly enhanced the high-glucose-induced apoptosis in both islets and MIN6 cells, GLP-1 and candesartan significantly inhibited apoptosis; and combination treatment additively prevented apoptosis. Whereas palmitate significantly decreased the phosphorylation of IRS-2, PKB, and FoxO1 in MIN6 cells, these changes were significantly inhibited by treatment with GLP-1 and/or candesartan. In addition, wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, markedly inhibited GLP-1- and/or candesartan-mediated PKB and FoxO1 phosphorylation. The present results suggest that GLP-1 and candesartan additively prevent glucolipotoxicity-induced apoptosis in pancreatic \u03b2-cells through the IRS-2/phosphoinositide 3-kinase/PKB/FoxO1 signaling pathway.",

These Abs can cross-react with the \u03b21-adrenergic receptor (\u03b21-AR), inducing a functional response in cardiomyocytes. In this study, we report that a monoclonal Ab against the R13 peptide, called mAb 17.2, and its single-chain Fv fragment (scFv), C5, caused apoptosis of murine adult cardiac HL-1 cells, and this effect was inhibited by pre-incubation with the \u03b2-blocker, propranolol. In addition, apoptosis induced by mAb 17.2 might involve the mitochondrial pathway evidenced by an increase in pro-apoptotic molecule, Bax/anti-apoptotic molecule, Bcl(XL), mRNA levels. HL-1 cells also underwent apoptosis after incubation with nine of 23 IgGs from cChHD patients (39.1%) that presented reactivity against R13 peptide and \u03b21-AR. The apoptotic effect caused by these IgGs was partially abolished by pre-incubation with R13 peptide or propranolol, suggesting the involvement of the C-terminal end of ribosomal P proteins and the \u03b2-adrenergic pathway. Moreover, we observed high rates of cardiomyocyte apoptosis in two tissue samples from cChHD patients by using a TUNEL assay and staining of active caspase-3. Our data demonstrate that Abs developed during T. cruzi infection have a strong cardiomyocyte apoptosis inducing ability, which could contribute to the heart disease developed in patients with cChHD.",

Dibutyl sebacate was selected as plasticiser. The influence of matrix composition, plasticiser concentration, and drug load on drug release was evaluated. The influence of plasticiser addition was assessed on processability and drug release: Dibutyl sebacate was added to a dichloromethane/EC solution and subsequently spray-dried, or was mixed as a liquid with EC powder. Hydrated tablets were evaluated by frequency sweep and creep rheological tests to correlate the results with drug release. Xanthan gum (XG) was added to the formulation because drug release was too slow (<50%, 24 h) from EC/MPT matrices (70%/30%, w/w). Increasing XG concentrations provided faster MPT release rates characterised by zero-order release kinetics, no burst release was observed. Lower plasticiser concentrations and higher drug loads increased drug release substantially. The plasticiser addition method did not affect drug release. Matrix composition, drug load, and plasticiser level affected the rheological properties of the swollen matrix tablets. X-ray diffraction demonstrated the formation of solid dispersions.

Estrogen receptor-\u03b2 (ER\u03b2) is the most abundant estrogen receptor in the colon and a complete absence of ER\u03b2 expression is associated with disrupted tight-junction formation and abnormal colonic architecture. The aim of this study was to determine whether ER\u03b2 signaling has a role in the maintenance of epithelial permeability in the colon. ER\u03b2 mRNA levels and colonic permeability were assessed in IL-10-deficient mice and HLA-B27 rats by RT-PCR and Ussing chambers. ER\u03b2 expression and monolayer resistance were measured in HT-29 and T84 colonic epithelial monolayers by RT-PCR and electric cell-substrate impedance sensing. The effect of 17\u03b2-estradiol and an estrogen agonist [diarylpropionitrile (DPN)] and antagonist (ICI 182780) on epithelial resistance in T84 cells was measured. Expression of ER\u03b2 and proinflammatory cytokines was investigated in colonic biopsies from IBD patients. Levels of ER\u03b2 mRNA were decreased, whereas colonic permeability was increased, in IL-10-deficient mice and HLA-B27 transgenic rats prior to the onset of colitis. T84 cells demonstrated higher resistance and increased levels of ER\u03b2 mRNA compared with HT-29 cells. 17\u03b2-estradiol and DPN induced increased epithelial resistance in T84 cells, whereas an ER\u03b2 blocker prevented the increased resistance. Decreased ER\u03b2 mRNA levels were observed in colonic biopsies from IBD patients.

In the legal medicine autopsy material is normally investigated to find out the cause of death. But the results of corresponding toxicology measurements often involve more information. With screening methods drugs were detected without connection to the cause of death. The deceased had either a continual therapeutic treatment, a treatment during an operation, or an unsuccessful urgent therapy. A liquid/liquid extraction and a LC/MS/MS method were developed for the determination of the drug concentrations. Different autopsy materials of about 120 cases were investigated. Most frequently the drugs metoprolol, tramadol, and midazolam could be proved and determined simultaneously. Metoprolol was found in seven cases, tramadol in seven cases and midazolam in thirteen cases. The dosage of the drugs was unknown. Therefore and because of the low number of cases statistic calculations were not meaningful and an individual case study was necessary. In all cases with oral metoprolol application the patients probably took a normal customary continuous dosage. The concentrations of tramadol in blood were in the toxic range in three cases. The distribution of tramadol in the compartments was independent of the dosage. The time between oral intake of metoprolol or tramadol and death was unknown. With the distribution pattern of metoprolol in the compartments it was possible to estimate the duration between drug intake and death. In most cases midazolam was given intravenously during an operation or an unsuccessful urgent therapy. Sometimes the time between dosage and death was documented. The duration between application of the drug and death played the crucial role for the distribution of midazolam in the compartments.

Consensus guidelines and the publication of a recent meta-analysis support the use of perioperative beta-blockade in patients who are at risk for adverse cardiac events, but few studies have examined the practical application of these clinical guidelines. We performed a multicenter intervention study in five acute care hospitals to measure, characterize, and increase the utilization of perioperative beta-blocker therapy for surgical patients at intermediate to high risk of cardiac complications. We also reviewed all cases of perioperative MI. Following baseline observations, we developed a multifaceted educational intervention using grand rounds, academic detailing, and peer profiling to disseminate current guidelines for perioperative beta-blocker use. We then collected postintervention data to assess changes in practice patterns and clinical outcomes. Preliminary results demonstrate a significant underutilization of perioperative beta-blocker therapy among patients at risk for adverse cardiac events, and we have identified several barriers to implementing the guidelines. This paper highlights the lessons learned while implementing a clinical guideline and working to promote an evidence-based intervention aimed at improving patient safety.",

We have examined the relationship between this polymorphism and blood pressure in a cohort ascertained to express variability in blood pressure measurements. We studied a cohort of 255 families comprising 1425 individuals ascertained via a hypertensive proband. Blood pressure was measured by ambulatory monitoring. The C-11377G SNP was genotyped using a TaqMan assay. There was evidence of association between this SNP and log systolic blood pressure (SBP), having adjusted for significant covariates including gender, age and drug treatment; P=0.009, 0.014 and 0.022, respectively, for daytime, night-time and clinic measurements. Replacing C by G caused an increase of 1.63, 1.83 and 1.61%, respectively, per gene copy. There were smaller effects on diastolic blood pressure and waist-hip ratio, which were of borderline significance. Genotype at the C-11377G (rs266729) polymorphism has independent effects both on waist-hip ratio and SBP.

Despite respiratory complications having been reported as examples of side effects, very few reports have been published in the literature.We describe the case of an elderly woman with a history of hypertension and allergy to Parietaria, grass, olive, mites, and with periodic asthmatic manifestations, for whom the administration of oral propafenone for recurrent supraventricular dysrhythmia was associated with the sudden onset of severe bronchostenosis.A 78-year-old woman was frequently admitted to the Emergency Department for a recurrent supraventricular tachycardia, which was treated initially with veramapil and thereafter with ivabradin. During her last visit to the cardiologist, she was prescribed propafenone (150 mg, 3 times a day) in place of ivabradin. After the administration of the second dose on the first day of the therapy, the patient began to complain of the onset of progressively severe dyspnea at rest. In the Emergency Department, respiratory auscultation showed diffuse rhonchi, wheezing, and rales; and arterial pressure was 200/100 mm Hg. Hemogasanalysis revealed hypoxemia, respiratory acidosis with 83% of O2-saturation. Emergency treatment with O2 therapy, methylprednisolone intravenous, furosemide, and then salbutamol was also started; the electrocardiogram only showed sinusal tachycardia. Results of laboratory examinations, including a white cell count and cardiac enzymes, were within the normal range. The patient achieved good respiratory function, after a period of 3 days.This report describes that even a relatively small dose of oral propafenone after commencing treatment can have a severe effect in exacerbating the obstruction of the airways in a susceptible subject. The likely mechanisms are an allergic reaction or a direct bronchospastic effect. Considering the recognized asthmogenicity of propafenone due to beta-blocker activity, we suggest that the cardiologist always refer to the patient's medical history before prescribing this drug, which is capable of producing notable side effects in predisposed individuals, beginning the eventual administration in the hospital setting. The use of bronchial provocation test allows the selection of inclined patients, thus reducing the risk of bronchospasm.", 
    "190": "Precise transcriptional control is dependent on specific interactions of a number of regulatory elements such as promoters, enhancers and silencers. Several studies indicate that the genome in higher eukaryotes is divided into chromatin domains with functional autonomy. Chromatin domain boundaries are a class of regulatory elements that restrict enhancers to interact with appropriate promoters and prevent misregulation of genes. While several boundary elements have been identified, a rational approach to search for such elements is lacking. With a view to identifying new chromatin domain boundary elements we analyzed genomic regions between closely spaced but differentially expressed genes of Drosophila melanogaster. We have identified a new boundary element between myoglianin and eyeless, ME boundary, that separates these two differentially expressed genes. ME boundary maps to a DNaseI hypersensitive site and acts as an enhancer blocker both in embryonic and adult stages in transgenic context. We also report that BEAF and GAF are the two major proteins responsible for the ME boundary function. Our studies demonstrate a rational approach to search for potential boundaries in genomic regions that are well annotated.",

Preoperative use of \u00df-blockers reduced occurrence of new-onset atrial fibrillation (OR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.88-1.01; P = .08]), whereas angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors increased it (OR, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.11-1.29], P < .00001).", 
    "197": "New-onset atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass grafting appears to increase short- and long-term mortality. Preoperative use of \u00df-blockers, avoidance of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and shorter cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic clamp times potentially reduce occurrence of new-onset atrial fibrillation.", 
    "198": "The BEAUTIFUL Holter substudy explored the cardiac safety of the I(f) inhibitor ivabradine in patients with stable coronary artery disease and left ventricular systolic dysfunction receiving optimal background therapy. The Holter substudy included 840 patients (ivabradine 5 or 7.5 mg/day, n = 421; placebo, n = 419), and the safety set consisted of 807 patients (ivabradine, n = 408; placebo, n = 399). Ambulatory 24-hour electrocardiographic Holter monitoring was performed at baseline and after 1 month and 6 months. There were no relevant between-group differences in baseline characteristics; 93% were receiving concomitant \u03b2 blocker. Treatment with ivabradine was associated with a decrease in 24-hour heart rate of 6.3 \u00b1 9.5 beats/min at last assessment versus no change with placebo (0.4 \u00b1 7.2 beats/min, p <0.001, between-group difference), with a greater decrease in waking heart rate with ivabradine than during sleep (6.8 \u00b1 10.4 vs 5.2 \u00b1 8.9 beats/min, respectively, at last visit). Incidence of episodes of heart rate <30 beats/min during waking hours or during sleep was \u22641% in the 2 groups. Although there were more patients with heart rates <40 or <50 beats/min with ivabradine than with placebo (awake 12% vs 4% for <40 beats/min and 68% vs 36% for <50 beats/min, respectively; asleep 22% vs 5% for <40 beats/min and 77% vs 50% for <50 beats/min, respectively), there was no between-group difference in episode severity. There was no increase in incidence of conduction and rhythm disturbances. In conclusion, our results confirm that ivabradine significantly lowers heart rate without raising concern for cardiac safety. Our observations strongly support the safety of combining ivabradine with \u03b2 blockers in patients with coronary artery disease."
