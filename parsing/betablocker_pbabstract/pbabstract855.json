    "0": "1. The cervical sympathetic trunk of the isolated rat superior cervical ganglion was stimulated with short bursts of repetitive pulses. At room temperature with rates of stimulation of 4 Hz and above, the ganglionic action potentials were reduced in size.2. Amphetamine (2.7 x 10(-5)M), which caused some depression of transmission during stimulation at 0.1 Hz, caused a partial reversal of the depression of transmission occurring with rates of stimulation above 4 Hz.3. This action of amphetamine was mimicked by adrenaline (3 x 10(-5)M) and noradrenaline (9.6 x 10(-5)M) but not by isoprenaline (1.8 x 10(-5)M) and was unaffected by propranolol (1.4 x 10(-5)M) but was abolished by prior application of phenoxybenzamine (5.8 x 10(-6)M). Furthermore, this action of amphetamine was unaltered in ganglia taken from rats pretreated with reserpine (single dose of 6 mg/kg, 16 h before dissection).4. Amphetamine had no effect on the surface potentials of the ganglion or on changes in these potentials produced by concentrations of carbachol (5. x 10(-6)M to 5.5 x 10(-3)M).5. It is concluded that amphetamine has a direct action on alpha-adrenoceptors situated at presynaptic sites.", 
    "1": "Epinephrine caused amylase secretion and K(+) release in rat parotid slices. Propranolol, which blocks beta-receptors, inhibited amylase secretion; phentolamine, which blocks alpha-receptors, inhibited K(+) release. Since enzyme secretion was associated with fusion of secretory granules to the cell membrane and K(+) release was associated with vacuole formation, it could be shown that both alpha- and beta-receptors are present in the same exocrine cell. The findings appear to exclude cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate as an intermediate in the alpha-receptor response.", 
    "2": "1. Effects of L-dopa and dopamine on the secretion of pancreatic juice were investigated in preparations of the isolated blood-perfused canine pancreas.2. Dopamine (1-10 mug) given intra-arterially caused a profuse flow of juice.3. The secretory activity of dopamine (3 mug) was approximately equal to that of secretin (0.1 unit).4. L-Dopa (10-100 mug) given by a single intra-arterial injection was ineffective, but infusion at 100 mug/min for 10 min caused a marked increase of secretion after a delay of a few minutes.5. Intravenous administration of either L-dopa (3 mg/kg) or dopamine (10-100 mug/kg) elicited a marked increase of pancreatic secretion, but was definitely less effective than intra-arterial injection.6. Dopamine-induced secretion was not modified by atropine, phentolamine, propranolol, guanethidine or tetrodotoxin.7. It is concluded that dopamine acts directly on the exocrine cells in the pancreas.", 
    "3": "The effects of ouabain (G-strophanthin) 20 mug/kg, on left ventricular (LV) pressure (P), diameter (D), velocity of contraction (dD/dt), and dP/dt were studied in conscious dogs instrumented with ultrasonic diameter gauges and miniature pressure gauges. The effects of ouabain were compared on separate occasions in the same dogs after cardiac depression with propranolol, 3.0 mg/kg, and also after general anesthesia with Na pentobarbital, 30 mg/kg. Maximal pressor effects were observed in the first 10 min, but maximal effects on the contractile state occurred at 30 min after ouabain. At this time, in conscious dogs, ouabain had increased LV isolength systolic pressure by 5%, LV isolength velocity by only 9%, and LV (dP/dt)/P by 21%, while end systolic diameter (ESD) decreased slightly and end diastolic diameter (EDD) and heart rate (HR) were unchanged. After anesthesia, ouabain increased LV systolic pressure by 8%, velocity 32%, (dP/dt)/P by 47%, and ESD decreased by 1.2 mm while EDD rose slightly and HR fell by 26 beats/min. Returning HR to control with atrial pacing decreased EDD 0.9 mm below control. After cardiac depression with propranolol, ouabain caused responses similar to those observed in the anesthetized dogs. Thus, the cardiac glycoside was found to exert only minor inotropic effects on the nonfailing heart of conscious dogs but far more striking inotropic responses in the anesthetized state."
