    "0": "Acute mental and physical stress lead to a marked lymphocytosis, with circulating natural killer cell numbers showing the most prominent increase. Many studies have linked these acute stress effects on lymphocytes with an increase in catecholamine levels. However, the molecular mechanisms which mediate this redistribution of lymphocytes from lymphocyte reservoirs into the circulation remain unknown. We hypothesized that this form of lymphocytosis was in part due to shedding of cell adhesion molecules from the cell surface and a subsequent detachment of lymphocytes adhering to the vascular endothelium in lymphocyte reservoirs. In this study, healthy human volunteers (n = 12) were exercised on a treadmill until exhaustion. The circulating levels of the soluble cell adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and E-Selectin were determined by ELISA. The subjects were then randomly assigned to treatment with either propranolol or metoprolol and repeated the exercise protocol after 1 week of treatment. Prior to drug treatment, soluble ICAM-1 levels rose from 258 +/- 19 to 321 +/- 28 ng/ml following exercise and returned to approximate baseline levels of 263 +/- 22 ng/ml after 1 h of rest. This highly significant effect of exercise on circulating ICAM-1 levels (p < .005) was mitigated after treatment with the beta-adrenergic antagonists. Soluble E-Selectin levels were not significantly affected by exercise. These results suggest that dynamic exercise leads to shedding of the cell adhesion molecule ICAM-1 via adrenergic mechanisms. We believe that these findings will contribute to the understanding of how physical and mental stress modulate lymphocyte migration and adhesion.", 
    "1": "The dentate gyrus neurons in the hippocampus contain a high density of both mineralocorticoid and adrenergic receptors. By in vivo extracellular recording from adrenalectomized rats we investigated the possible relationships between the two systems with regard to neuronal excitability and activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. Pretreatment with aldosterone significantly enhanced both basal neuronal excitability and tetanically evoked synaptic plasticity in adrenalectomized, but not sham-operated rats. The enhancement was blocked by spironolactone, indicating a mineralocorticoid receptor-dependent effect. The adrenomedullary hormone epinephrine also significantly enhanced synaptic plasticity via activation of beta-adrenergic receptors. Beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, infused directly into the dentate gyrus granule cell layer, significantly reduced the effect of aldosterone on neuronal excitability and partly canceled the aldosterone-enhanced synaptic plasticity. No effect of propranolol was found after its amygdaloid infusion. The mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone did not affect the epinephrine-induced effects. These results indicate that the pretreated adrenal steroids interact with the catecholaminergic system in the dentate gyrus of adrenalectomized rats and that the functional beta-adrenergic pathway is involved in the mechanism of mineralocorticoid-induced cellular effects in vivo.", 
    "2": "Octreotide and propranolol are both effective portal hypotensive drugs in the control or prevention of variceal bleeding. The present study was undertaken to investigate the hemodynamic effects of octreotide and propranolol, alone or in combination, in portal hypertensive rats. Portal hypertension was induced by partial portal vein ligation. Portal hypertensive rats were allocated into one of the four groups: vehicle group (saline, 0.5 ml/day), octreotide group (100 microg/kg/12 hr), propranolol group (30 mg/kg/day), and octreotide (100 microg/kg/12 hr) plus propranolol (30 mg/kg/day) group. Propranolol or saline was administered by gavage, octreotide by subcutaneous injection. Drug was given one day before ligation and continued for eight consecutive days. Systemic as well as splanchnic hemodynamic parameters were measured thereafter. The portal venous pressure, portal tributary blood flow, and cardiac index were significantly reduced by octreotide, propranolol, or octreotide plus propranolol in portal hypertensive rats. Portal territory, systemic, and renal vascular resistances were significantly enhanced, while hepatic arterial blood flow significantly reduced, in the octreotide and octreotide plus propranolol groups as compared to vehicle group. Our results showed that eight-day administration of octreotide, propranolol, or octreotide plus propranolol led to portal hypotensive and antihyperdynamic effects in portal hypertensive rats. Overall, octreotide treatment alone resulted in better antihyperdynamic profiles than propranolol treatment alone. The combination of octreotide and propranolol offered no therapeutic benefits and was slightly less effective than octreotide alone.", 
    "3": "The Dark Agouti rat has been proposed as a model for the human debrisoquine 4-hydroxylase polymorphism. Earlier studies suggested that the poor metabolizer phenotype in the Dark Agouti rat is caused by the absence of the expression of CYP2D1 mRNA. Although CYP2D1 is the major enzyme catalyzing debrisoquine 4-hydroxylation, other reports have indicated the involvement of a CYP2D, purified from rat hepatic microsomes and presumed to be CYP2D2, which also exhibits this activity. The levels of CYP2D1 and CYP2D2 mRNAs were markedly lower in Dark Agouti as compared to Sprague Dawley rats. Using a baculovirus expression system, recombinant CYP2D1 and CYP2D2 from Spodoptera frugiperda insect cells were examined and were found to both forms catalize debrisoquine 4-hydroxylase activity. These results suggest that reduced debrisoquine 4-hydroxylase activity in the Dark Agouti rat is caused by the low level expression not only of CYP2D1, but also of CYP2D2. Interestingly, bunitrolol 4-hydroxylation was catalyzed by recombinant CYP2D2, while CYP2D1 was inactive toward this substrate. Thus, the low bunitrolol 4-hydroxylation in Dark Agouti rats was caused by the low level of CYP2D2 expression in this rat strain.", 
    "4": "The polymorphic human CYP2D6 has been co-expressed with human NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase in Escherichia coli in order to generate a functional recombinant monooxygenase system for the study of xenobiotic metabolism. The two cDNAs were co-expressed from separate, compatible plasmids with different antibiotic selection markers. The CYP2D6 could be detected in bacterial cells at levels up to 700 nmol I-1 culture by Fe(2+)-CO versus Fe2+ difference spectroscopy, exhibiting the characteristic absorbance peak at 450 nm. Immunoblotting demonstrated the presence of both proteins in bacterial membranes, where they were expressed at levels significantly higher than those found in human liver microsomes. Membrane content was 150-200 pmol CYP2D6 (determined spectrally) and 100-230 pmol CYP-reductase (determined enzymatically) per mg protein. Critically, the two co-expressed proteins were able to couple to form a NADPH-dependent monooxygenase which metabolized the CYP2D6 substrate bufuralol (Vmax 3.30 nmol min-1 mg-1 protein; K(m) 11.1 microM) in isolated membrane fractions. This K(m) value was similar to the K(m) determined in human liver microsomes. Activity could be inhibited by the specific inhibitor quinidine. Of greater significance however, was the finding that intact E. coli cells, even in the absence of exogenous NADPH, were able to metabolize bufuralol at rates almost as high as those measured in membranes (4.6 +/- 0.4 min-1 versus 5.7 +/- 0.2 min-1 at 50 microM substrate). Such recombinant strains will greatly facilitate the molecular characterization of allelic variants of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes.", 
    "5": "Chronic Chlamydia pneumoniae infection, characterized by elevated levels of C. pneumoniae IgG and IgA antibodies and immunocomplexes, is associated with myocardial infarction and angiographically verified coronary heart disease. C. pneumoniae organisms have also been found in coronary atheromas, but not in healthy vessels. We investigated the effect of 4 months' doxycycline therapy on serological markers of C. pneumoniae infection and coronary risk factors. Thirty-four non-smoking men, aged 57.9 (+/- 5.2) years, who had mild hypertension or moderate hypercholesterolaemia and a previous coronary bypass, were randomly assigned to receive doxycycline or matching placebo for 4 months. Acetylsalicylic acid and beta-blocker were the only other medications allowed. Patients were examined physically and by laboratory tests; their basal nitric oxide production was determined by blood flow responses to intra-arterial monomethyl-L-arginine at baseline and at 2 and 4 months. The tests were also taken at 6 months after medication. At entry, the demographic, clinical, blood flow and laboratory measurements were similar in both groups, with the exception of fibrinogen and triglyceride levels, which were higher in the placebo group. No significant changes were found in any of the parameters during the treatment. Thus extended doxycycline therapy did not affect C. pneumoniae antibodies or coronary heart disease risk factors. We conclude that doxycycline monotherapy may not be sufficient to eradicate chronic C. pneumoniae infection.", 
    "6": "Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death in women, and the importance of this condition is not generally appreciated. Few studies are available that investigate the response of women to the various therapeutic agents that are used in this disease. Those that are available suggest that risk factor reduction and estrogen replacement therapy are important, and that aspirin and vitamin E may be helpful in primary prevention in women. After myocardial infarction, thrombolytics and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty reduce mortality and beta-adrenergic blocking agents and ACE inhibitors are valuable. Elective percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty appears to have similar success rates in men and women. In order to most effectively treat women with coronary artery disease, studies on their response to therapy are needed.", 
    "7": "During time-zone travel, the endogenous melatonin rhythm is often out of phase with the new local time cues. Since endogenous melatonin could act as an endogenous zeitgeber, when its secretory rhythm is out of phase it may hinder adaptation by natural zeitgebers. It is possible that by temporarily suppressing the production of melatonin, by beta-blockers for example, adaptation may be facilitated. In a double-blind, crossover study eight healthy volunteers (aged 23-30 years) took 100 mg atenolol or placebo at 1900 h on Day (D) 1. Volunteers were then exposed to bright light (approx. 1000 lux) from 0000 to 0400 h during the following night and remained in dim light (<50 lux) or darkness until 1200 h on D3. Salivary melatonin (MT) and urinary 6-sulphatoxymelatonin (aMT6s) were measured every 30-60 min and every 2 h (except when asleep), respectively. Subjective alertness and core body temperature (cBT) were also measured. aMT6s and MT were significantly suppressed under atenolol treatment on the night of D1 only. Atenolol significantly phase delayed the salivary melatonin onset by 1.8+/-0.6 h and 1.28+/-0.35 h compared with the onsets on D1 placebo leg and D2 placebo leg (i.e. onset times before and after light treatment), respectively. There were no detrimental effects on cBT or alertness. Temporary suppression of melatonin by beta-blockers may facilitate adaptation to phase shifts.",

The impaired glucose tolerance and post-transplant diabetes mellitus groups showed a significant reduction in insulin-stimulated glucose disposal rate (mg/kg.min) compared to the normal glucose tolerance group (4.6 +/- 1.6 and 3.4 +/- 1.3 respectively vs 7.1 +/- 2.4, P < 0.05). The insulin response (picomol/l) was not different between the normal glucose tolerance and impaired glucose tolerance groups but was significantly reduced in the post-transplant diabetes mellitus group (448 +/- 310 and 450 +/- 291 respectively vs 170 +/- 128, P < 0.05).",

CsA-induced vasoconstriction of the afferent glomerular arteriole probably plays a role in at least the nephrotoxicity. Frequently renal transplant recipients on CsA have to be treated with antihypertensive drugs and for this purpose also beta-blockers are used. Tertatolol is a new beta-blocker with specific vasodilatory properties, and thus might be particularly useful in CsA-treated transplant recipients.", 
    "13": "We studied the systemic and renal haemodynamic effects of atenolol and tertatolol in 12 hypertensive renal transplant recipients on cyclosporine A (CsA). In a cross-over way, all patients were treated with atenolol and tertatolol for 4 weeks each, separated by a wash-out period also of 4 weeks. At the end of each period, the mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow (RPF) were measured.",

It lowers systemic arterial blood pressure without causing reflex tachycardia and preserves renal function. More recently, carvedilol has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with congestive heart failure. This reduction may occur in part via beta-blockade and alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade, the latter resulting in vasodilation. Importantly, carvedilol and several of its metabolites are potent antioxidants that may inhibit the oxidation of norepinephrine and the subsequent formation of toxic intermediates, such as reactive free radicals in the myocardium. As a result, carvedilol inhibits the expression of certain genes involved in myocardial damage, such as intracellular adhesion molecule-1, free-radical-induced activation of transcription factors, and programmed cell death or apoptosis. In this respect, carvedilol represents a new therapy for the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure and combines, in one molecule, a number of potentially beneficial properties.",

Controlling for age eliminates the association between female gender and increased mortality in most, but not all studies.

    "31": "In an attempt to clarify the functional role of adrenoceptors in accommodation, the effects of various adrenergic agents on the state of accommodation were studied. Fifty-two emmetropic, visually normal subjects (24.6 +/- 0.42 years old) participated in this study. Using an infrared optometer, the far and near points of accommodation were measured by a quasistatic method. Tonic accommodation and accommodative adaptation were also investigated. All these parameters were measured before and after topical application of various adrenergic agents. Both bunazosin hydrochloride (0.1%) and phenylephrine hydrochloride (5%) had no effect on tonic accommodation and accommodative adaptation. However, bunazosin hydrochloride increased the near point of accommodation. Timolol maleate (0.5%) and isoproterenol hydrochloride (3.0%) did not affect tonic accommodation. Isoproterenol hydrochloride evoked a hyperopic shift of the far point of accommodation by 0.23 +/- 0.42 diopters (D). Additionally, accommodative adaptation was increased by timolol maleate (0.36 +/- 0.62 D) and decreased by isoproterenol hydrochloride (0.18 +/- 0.48 D). These results indicate that both alpha and beta adrenoceptors affect accommodation. Activation of alpha adrenoceptors increased the near point of accommodation and activation of beta adrenoceptors decreased accommodative adaptation, which suggests that activation of adrenoceptors may modify parasympathetic activity; hence, affecting the state of accommodation.", 
    "32": "The effect of topical 2% carteolol on tissue circulation in the albino rabbit optic nerve head (ONH) was investigated using a laser speckle tissue circulation analyzer. In the first experiment, the normalized blur (NB) value, a quantitative index of tissue blood flow velocity in the ONH, intraocular pressure (IOP), blood pressure (BP), and pulse rate were measured under general anesthesia before as well as 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after a 20-microL instillation of carteolol in one eye and the vehicle in the other eye in a masked, randomized manner. In the second experiment, one eye of a rabbit received carteolol twice daily for 20 days and the fellow eye received the vehicle in a masked, randomized manner. The IOP was measured every 5 days, and the NB in the ONH and IOP were measured before treatment and 2 hours after the last instillation on the 20th day. After a single instillation of carteolol, pulse rate showed a maximum reduction of 15%, and IOP in the carteolol-treated eyes showed a maximum decrease of 22%. The NB in the ONH and BP did not show any significant change during the experiment. After 20-day treatment with carteolol, IOP showed a maximum decrease of 25% in the carteolol-treated eyes and 21% in the vehicle-treated eyes. The NB showed a significant increase of 15% (P < 0.01) in the carteolol-treated eyes and 11% (P < 0.01) in the vehicle-treated eyes.

    "36": "1. The aim of the present work was to characterize the 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A) antagonistic actions of (-)-pindolol and WAY 100635 (N-(2-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl)ethyl)-N-(2-pyridinyl) cyclohexane carboxamide). Studies were performed on 5-HT1A receptors located on 5-hydroxytryptaminergic neurones in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and on pyramidal cells in the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus in rat brain slices. 2. Intracellular electrophysiological recording of CA1 pyramidal cells and 5-hydroxytryptaminergic DRN neurones showed that the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT) evoked in both cell types a concentration-dependent cell membrane hyperpolarization and a decrease in cell input resistance. On its own, (-)-pindolol did not modify the cell membrane potential and resistance at concentrations up to 10 microM, but it antagonized the 5-CT effects in a concentration-dependent manner. Similar antagonism of 5-CT effects was observed in the CA3 hippocampal region. (-)-Pindolol also prevented the 5-HT1A receptor-mediated hyperpolarization of CA1 pyramidal cells due to 5-HT (15 microM). In contrast, the 5-HT-induced depolarization mediated by presumed 5-HT4 receptors persisted in the presence of 3 microM (-)-pindolol. 3. In the hippocampus, (-)-pindolol completely prevented the hyperpolarization of CA1 pyramidal cells by 100 nM 5-CT (IC50=92 nM; apparent KB=20.1 nM), and of CA3 neurones by 300 nM 5-CT (IC50=522 nM; apparent KB= 115.1 nM). The block by (-)-pindolol was surmounted by increasing the concentration of 5-CT, indicating a reversible and competitive antagonistic action. 4. Extracellular recording of the firing rate of 5-hydroxytryptaminergic neurones in the DRN showed that (-)-pindolol blocked, in a concentration-dependent manner, the decrease in firing elicited by 100 nM 5-CT (IC50=598 nM; apparent KB= 131.7 nM) or 100 nM ipsapirone (IC50= 132.5 nM; apparent KB= 124.9 nM). The effect of (-)-pindolol was surmountable by increasing the concentration of the agonist. Intracellular recording experiments showed that 10 microM (-)-pindolol were required to antagonize completely the hyperpolarizing effect of 100 nM 5-CT. 5. In vivo labelling of brain 5-HT1A receptors by i.v. administration of [3H]-WAY 100635 ([O-methyl-3H]-N-(2-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1 -piperazinyl)ethyl-N-(2-pyridyl)cyclo-hexane-carboxamide) was used to assess their occupancy following in vivo treatment with (-)-pindolol. (-)-Pindolol (15 mg kg[-1]) injected i.p. either subchronically (2 day-treatment before i.v. injection of [3H]-WAY 100635) or acutely (20 min before i.v. injection of [3H]-WAY 100635) markedly reduced [3H]-WAY 100635 accumulation in all 5-HT1A receptor-containing brain areas. In particular, no differences were observed in the capacity of (-)-pindolol to prevent [3H]-WAY 100635 accumulation in the DRN and the CAI and CA3 hippocampal areas. 6. Intracellular electrophysiological recording of 5-hydroxytryptaminergic DRN neurones showed that WAY 100635 prevented the hyperpolarizing effect of 100 nM 5-CT in a concentration-dependent manner (IC50=4.9 nM, apparent KB=0.25 nM). In CA1 pyramidal cells, hyperpolarization induced by 50 nM 5-CT was also antagonized by WAY 100635 (IC50 = 0.80 nM, apparent KB= 0.28 nM).", 
    "37": "1. We have recently suggested the existence in the heart of a 'putative beta4-adrenoceptor' based on the cardiostimulant effects of non-conventional partial agonists, compounds that cause cardiostimulant effects at greater concentrations than those required to block beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors. We sought to obtain further evidence by establishing and validating a radioligand binding assay for this receptor with (-)-[3H]-CGP 12177A ([-]-4-(3-tertiarybutylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy) benzimidazol-2-one) in rat atrium. We investigated (-)-[3H]-CGP 12177A for this purpose for two reasons, because it is a non-conventional partial agonist and also because it is a hydrophilic radioligand. 2. Increasing concentrations of (-)-[3H]-CGP 12177A, in the absence or presence of 20 microM (-)-CGP 12177A to define non-specific binding, resulted in a biphasic saturation isotherm. Low concentrations bound to beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors (pKD 9.4+/-0.1, Bmax 26.9+/-3.1 fmol mg(-1) protein) and higher concentrations bound to the 'putative beta4-adrenoceptor' (pKD 7.5+/-0.1, Bmax 47.7+/-4.9 fmol mg(-1) protein). In other experiments designed to exclude beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors, (-)-[3H]-CGP 12177A (1-200 nM) binding in the presence of 500 nM (-)-propranolol was also saturable (pKD 7.6+/-0.1, Bmax 50.8+/-7.4 fmol mg(-1) protein). 3. The non-conventional partial agonists (-)-CGP 12177A (pKi 7.3+/-0.2), (+/-)-cyanopindolol (pKi 7.6+/-0.2), [-]-pindolol (pK1 6.6+/-0.1) and (+/-)-carazolol (pKi 7.2+/-0.2) and the antagonist (-)-bupranolol (pKi 6.6+/-0.2), all competed for (-)-[3H]-CGP 12177A binding in the presence of 500 nM (-)-propranolol at the 'putative beta4-adrenoceptor', with affinities closely similar to potencies and affinities determined in organ bath studies. 4. The catecholamines competed with (-)-[3H]-CGP 12177A at the 'putative beta 4-adrenoceptor' in a stereoselective manner, (-)-noradrenaline (pKiH 6.3+/-0.3, pKiL 3.5+/-0.1), (-)-adrenaline (pKiH 6.5+/-0.2, pKiL 2.9+/-0.1), (-)-isoprenaline (pKiH 6.2+/-0.5, pKiL 3.4+/-0.1), (+)-isoprenaline (pKi< 1.7), (-)-RO363 ((-)-(1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenethylamino)-3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenoxy++ +)-2-propranol)oxalate, pKi 5.5+/-0.1). 5. The inclusion of guanosine 5-triphosphate (GTP 0.1 mM) had no effect on binding of (-)-CGP 12177A or (-)-isoprenaline to the 'putative beta4-adrenoceptor'. In competition binding studies, (-)-CGP 12177A competed with (-)-[3H]-CGP 12177A for one receptor state in the absence (pKi 7.3+/-0.2) or presence of GTP (pKi 7.3+/-0.2). (-)-Isoprenaline competed with (-)-[3H]-CGP 12177A for two states in the absence (pKiH 6.6+/-0.3, pKiL 3.5+/-0.1; % H 25+/-7) or presence of GTP (pKiH 6.2+/-0.5, pKiL 3.4+/-0.1; % H 37+/-6). In contrast, at beta1-adrenoceptors, GTP stabilized the low affinity state of the receptor for (-)-isoprenaline. 6. The specificity of binding to the 'putative beta 4-adrenoceptor' was tested with compounds active at other receptors. High concentrations of the beta 3-adrenoceptor agonists, BRL 37344 ((RR+SS)[4-[2-[[2-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxy-ethyl]amino]propyl]phenoxy]acetic acid, 6 microM), SR 58611A (ethyl{(7S)-7-[(2R)-2-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethylamino]-5,6,7,8-tetrahydronaphtyl2-yloxy} acetate hydrochloride, 6 microM), ZD 2079 ((+/-)-1-phenyl-2-(2-4-carboxymethylphenoxy)-ethylamino)-ethan-1-ol, 60 microM), CL 316243 (disodium (R,R)-5-[2-[2-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl-amino]propyl]- 1,3-benzodioxole-2,2-dicarboxylate, 60 microM) and antagonist SR 59230A (3-(2-ethylphenoxy)-1-[(1S)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphth-1-ylamino]-2S-2-propanol oxalate, 6 microM) caused less than 22% inhibition of (-)[3H]-CGP 12177A binding in the presence of 500 nM (-)propranolol. Histamine (1mM), atropine (1 microM), phentolamine (10 microM), 5-HT (100 microM) and the 5-HT4 receptor antagonist SB 207710 ((1-butyl-4-piperidinyl)-methyl 8-amino-7-iodo-1,4-benzodioxan-5-carboxylate, 10nM) caused less than 26% inhibition of binding. 7.Non-conventional partial agonists, the antagonist (-)bupranolol and catecholamines all competed for (-)[3H]-CGP 12177A binding in the absence of (-)propranolol at beta1-adrenoceptors, with affinities (pKi) ranging from 1.6-3.6 log orders greater than at the 'putative beta 4-adrenoceptor'. 8.We have established and validated a radioligand binding assay in rat atrium for the 'putative beta 4-adrenoceptor' which is distinct from beta1-, beta2- and beta 3-adrenoceptors. The stereoselective interaction with the catecholamines provides further support for the classification of the receptor as 'putative beta 4-adrenoceptor'.", 
    "38": "A double-blind, randomised, parallel-group trial was conducted in patients with essential hypertension in British general practices, of nebivolol 5 mg, atenolol 50 mg, and placebo each given once daily. Both active drugs, in comparison with placebo, caused highly significant and similar reductions in systolic and diastolic pressures without orthostatic effect, and small significant falls in heart rate. Both active drugs were well tolerated, nebivolol marginally more so. Nebivolol, a long-acting, cardioselective, vasodilating beta-blocker which acts partly via the l-arginine/nitric oxide mechanism, appears potentially valuable for the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "39": "An in vitro brainstem preparation of the neonatal rat with intact right vagal (X) innervation of the right atrium, and intact medullary roots of the left X and glossopharyngeal (IX) nerves for stimulation was developed. The preparation was continuously superfused with artificial CSF at 25 degrees C. The electrical activity of the right atrium was recorded to determine the heart rate. Applications of atropine or propranolol to the superfusate did not alter the heart rate. Electrical stimulation (0.5 ms pulse, 20 Hz) of the left IX and X afferents elicited a reduction in the heart rate from 70.3 +/- 13.2 to 50.6 +/- 13.2 beats/min (mean +/- SD, p < 0.05), which was abolished after division of the right X or application of atropine to the superfusing solution. A similar reflex bradycardia was seen in a preparation with intact left vagal-right atrium innervation during right IX and X afferent stimulation. Cervical spinal cord transection affected neither the baseline heart rate nor the magnitude of the reflex bradycardia. Longitudinal sectioning of the medulla oblongata in the mid-line down to the level of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery abolished the heart rate response. After bilateral cervical vagotomies, electrical stimulation (0.5 ms pulse, 20 Hz, up to 100 microA) of the ventrolateral medulla oblongata, lateral funiculus at C2 or intermediate nucleus of the spinal cord at Th1-4 did not affect the heart rate. These results indicate that the functions in the lower brainstem are preserved in this preparation, at least in regard to the generation of reflex bradycardia. The results also suggest that the laterality of cardiac vagal innervation and sympathetic innervation will develop during the postnatal period. This preparation may be useful for the study of the central neuronal network controlling the heart rate.",

    "42": "A univariate analysis suggested that all-cause mortality is reduced on amiodarone in patients with an ejection fraction < 30%, with arrhythmia on the initial Holter, on beta-blocker treatment, and with an increased initial heart rate. A trend towards an increase of all-cause mortality was noted in patients with an ejection fraction 30-40%, without arrhythmia on Holter, off beta-blockers, and with a low baseline heart rate. A multivariate analysis suggested that the univariate observations are mutually additive.",

    "45": "Treatment data for 4035 representative patients were collected for the hospital phase and 6 months after discharge. A logistic regression model was developed to describe the predictors of beta-blocker use. In the 11 regional samples, 6-38% (20% overall) of patients had no recorded contraindications but were discharged without a beta-blocker. In the absence of perceived contraindications, there was a strong, independent negative association between age and odds of treatment (P < 0.001), and women were less likely to be treated than men (adjusted odds ratio 0.76, 95% CI 0.58-0.99). Discontinuation of beta-blocker treatment by 6 months was significantly less likely in regions where the proportion given such treatment at discharge was high. In contrast, use of antithrombotic agents in the samples was consistently high.",

Considerable regional variations persist despite shared trials evidence. Discharge treatment strongly influences long-term medication.", 
    "47": "Both experimental and clinical observation suggest that activation of the sympathetic nervous system exerts an important deleterious effect in patients with chronic heart failure. The precise mechanisms responsible for this effect have not been defined, but prolonged exposure to norepinephrine is associated with a variety of adverse physiologic and biochemical/molecular actions. Identification of these deleterious pathways has helped to explain why drugs that block the cardiac effects of norepinephrine (i.e., beta-blockers) retard remodeling and prolong life in experimental models of heart failure. beta-Blockers have been shown to reduce the mortality of patients after an acute myocardial infarction; this effect appears to be particularly marked in patients with postinfarction heart failure. Results of several trials suggest that long-term treatment with beta-blockers can improve symptoms and reduce the frequency of hospitalizations for heart failure. Most recently, carvedilol has been shown to reduce the risk of all-cause mortality by 65% in patients with either an ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy. These findings, taken together, suggest that pharmacologic interference with the sympathetic nervous system can produce important clinical benefits in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction.", 
    "48": "Carvedilol is a new beta-blocker antihypertensive agent with vasodilating properties secondary to alpha 1-blocking activity. Peripheral vascular resistance is reduced and cardiac output and renal function are not altered with carvedilol. The antihypertensive effects of this agent are equivalent to those of other beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and diuretics. Carvedilol has a neutral effect on lipids and glucose metabolism. The percentage of responders is increased when carvedilol is combined with a diuretic. This agent has several unique properties. In addition to its antihypertensive effects, carvedilol in vitro and in vivo has been shown to have antiproliferative effects on smooth muscle cells and to inhibit the action of oxygen-free radicals. The antioxidant properties of this compound are significantly greater than those of vitamin E. In animal models, carvedilol may slow the process of atherogenesis, reduce infarct size, and improve postinfarction survival to a greater degree than other beta-blockers. Recent studies have demonstrated that carvedilol reduces morbidity and mortality in patients with congestive heart failure who are already receiving angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, and digitalis. The antioxidant and antiproliferative activities of carvedilol may present an advantage over other available antihypertensive medications.",

    "52": "The mortality rate was reduced only in early bisoprolol-treated rats (29% vs. 46% in untreated rats, p < 0.05). Heart rate was equally reduced in all treatment groups, and the maximal rate of rise of left ventricular systolic pressure (dP/dt(max)) decreased in sham rats and in rats with a small to moderate infarct size. Stroke volume index was unchanged in sham rats and in rats with a small to moderate infarct with early or late bisoprolol treatment and increased in rats with a large infarct in the late bisoprolol group. Left ventricular volume was increased by bisoprolol in sham rats and rats with a small infarct but not in rats with a large infarct.", 
    "53": "Treatments starting early (30 min) or late (14 days) after coronary artery ligation with bisoprolol increased left ventricular volume in sham rats and in rats with a small infarct but not in rats with a large infarct. Late bisoprolol treatment improved stroke volume index, and early bisoprolol treatment reduced diastolic wall stress, in rats with a large myocardial infarct. Thus, bisoprolol effects on remodeling and cardiac performance after myocardial infarction strongly depend on infarct size and timing of treatment. This finding may explain previous controversial results that did not consider infarct size and timing of treatment.",

Twice daily applications of either artificial tears (n = 6), 0.5% betaxolol (n = 5), or 0.5% apraclonidine (n = 5) were delivered to both eyes, and awake pressures were monitored with a TonoPen XL tonometer for 17 days before the rats were killed.", 
    "56": "For animals administered artificial tears, the mean IOP of the experimental eyes was 39 +/- 2 mm Hg compared with 29 +/- 1 mm Hg for the control eyes. This difference was statistically significant (P < 0.001). Mean IOPs in the experimental eyes of animals administered betaxolol and apraclonidine were 29 +/- 7 and 29 +/- 4 mm Hg, respectively, whereas the mean IOP in the control eyes was 28 +/- 1 mm Hg for both groups. There was no statistically significant difference among these values. The mean IOP for the experimental eyes in the betaxolol and apraclonidine groups was lower than that in animals administered artificial tears (P = 0.003). Quantitative histologic analysis of optic nerve damage in experimental eyes showed that four of the six animals administered artificial tears had damage involving 100% of the neural area. This degree of damage appeared in only 3 of 10 animals administered glaucoma therapy. Optic nerve protection was closely correlated with IOP history because damage was limited to less than 10% of the cross-sectional area in all animals in which the maximal IOP was less than or equal to 39 mm Hg, more than 2 SD below the mean value for eyes administered artificial tears.",

    "58": "Intensive investigations are currently performed in the treatment of cardiac failure, based on the hypothesis of the potentially deleterious effects of compensatory neurohormonal mechanisms. Administration of beta-adrenergic blockers at progressively increasing doses appears well tolerated in most cases, improves left ventricular function and symptoms, and reduces the frequency of hospitalisations for heart failure worsening in patients already receiving a background treatment combining diuretics and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. Survival improvement remains to be established by the ongoing large scale multicentric trials of beta-blockers. Other therapeutic strategies are investigated, mainly inhibition of angiotensin II and endothelin effects by specific antagonists.",

Repeated administrations of atenolol (9 and 18 mg/kg.b.wt.) induced non significant effects on weights of testes, epididymis and seminal vesicle at the first day, 30 and 60 days after the last repeated oral administration for 60 days. Administration of atenolol (9 and 18 mg/kg.b.wt.), metoprolol (3.5 and 7 mg/kg.b.wt.) and propranolol (15 mg/kg.b.wt.) to male rats induced significant decrease in percent of progressive motility of sperm at first day after the last oral administration for 60 days. Atenolol (18 mg/kg.b.wt.), metoprolol (7 mg/kg.b.wt.) and propranolol (7.5 and 15 mg/kg.b.wt.) induced significant increase in sperm head and tail abnormalities at first day after the last repeated dose. All rats treated with atenolol (9 mg/kg.b.wt.), metoprolol (7.5 and 15 mg/kg.b.wt.) and propranolol (7.5 and 15 mg/kg.b.wt.) induced significant decrease in the level of testosterone hormone at first and 30 days after the last dose. Repeated administrations of atenolol, metoprolol and propranolol in therapeutic and double therapeutic doses for 60 days induced nearly similar histopathological alterations in testis, epididymis and seminal vesicles. The induced hazard effects by the tested drugs on the male rat fertility were reversible as they returned to normal values 60 days after discontinuation of therapy.", 
    "60": "The nocturnal increase in circulating melatonin in vertebrates is regulated by 10- to 100-fold increases in pineal serotonin N-acetyltransferase (AA-NAT) activity. Changes in the amount of AA-NAT protein were shown to parallel changes in AA-NAT activity. When neural stimulation was switched off by either light exposure or L-propranolol-induced beta-adrenergic blockade, both AA-NAT activity and protein decreased rapidly. Effects of L-propranolol were blocked in vitro by dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) or inhibitors of proteasomal proteolysis. This result indicates that adrenergic-cAMP regulation of AA-NAT is mediated by rapid reversible control of selective proteasomal proteolysis. Similar proteasome-based mechanisms may function widely as selective molecular switches in vertebrate neural systems.", 
    "61": "It is customary to rotate samples in Raman spectroscopy to avoid absorption or sample heating. In FT-Raman experiments the rotation is always shown (typically 30-60 rpm) because higher speeds are thought to generate noise in the spectra. In this article we show that more rapid rotation is possible. A tablet containing maleic acid and one made up of sub-millimetre silica particles with metoprolol succinate as active ingredient were rotated at different speeds, up to 6760 rpm. The FT-Raman spectra were recorded and studied. We conclude that it is perfectly acceptable to rotate samples up to 1500 rpm.", 
    "62": "We tested the hypothesis that endogenous angiotensin II participates in the direct and reflex effects of adenosine on the sympathetic nervous system. Nine healthy men were studied after 1 wk of the angiotensin II type I receptor antagonist losartan (100 mg daily) or placebo, according to a double-blind randomized crossover design. Bilateral forearm blood flows, NE appearance rates, and total body NE spillover were determined before and during graded brachial arterial infusion of adenosine (0.5, 1.5, 5, and 15 microg/100 ml forearm tissue) and nitroprusside. Adenosine increased total body NE spillover (P < 0.05) whereas nitroprusside did not. Losartan lowered BP (P < 0.05), had no effect on total body NE spillover at rest, or forearm vasodilation during either infusion, but reduced the systemic noradrenergic response to adenosine from 1.0+/-0.4 nmol/min on the placebo day to 0.2+/-0.3 nmol/min (P < 0.01), and forearm NE appearance rate in response to adenosine was lower in the infused, as compared with the contralateral arm (P = 0.04). The sympatho-excitatory reflex elicited by adenosine is mediated through pathways involving the angiotensin II type I receptor. Interactions between adenosine and angiotensin II may assume importance during ischemia or congestive heart failure and could contribute to the benefit of converting enzyme inhibition in these conditions.", 
    "63": "Rodents are the unique species carrying duplicated angiotensin (Ang) type 1 (AT1) receptor genes, Agtr1a and Agtr1b. After separately generating Agtr1a and Agtr1b null mutant mice by gene targeting, we produced double mutant mice homozygous for both Agtr1a and Agtr1b null mutation (Agtr1a-/-; Agtr1b-/-) by mating the single gene mutants. Agtr1a-/-, Agtr1b-/- mice are characterized by normal in utero survival but decreased ex utero survival rate. After birth they are characterized by low body weight gain, marked hypotension, and abnormal kidney morphology including delayed maturity in glomerular growth, hypoplastic papilla, and renal arterial hypertrophy. These abnormal phenotypes are quantitatively similar to those found in mutant mice homozygous for the angiotensinogen gene (Agt-/-), indicating that major biological functions of endogenous Ang elucidated by the abnormal phenotypes of Agt-/- are mediated by the AT1 receptors. Infusion of Ang II, AT1 blockers, or an AT2 blocker was without effect on blood pressure in Agtr1a-/-; Agtr1b-/- mice, indicating that AT2 receptor does not exert acute depressor effects in these mice lacking AT1 receptors. Also, unlike Agt-/- mice, some Agtr1a-/-; Agtr1b-/- mice have a large ventricular septum defect, suggesting that another receptor such as AT2 is functionally activated in Agtr1a-/-, Agtr1b-/- mice.", 
    "64": "Recently, we developed a transgenic mouse with cardiac-specific Gsalpha overexpression (TG mouse), which exhibits enhanced postsynaptic beta-adrenergic receptor signaling, ultimately developing a cardiomyopathy. The goal of the present study was to determine whether cardiac Gsalpha overexpression alters autonomic cardiovascular control, which could shed light on the mechanism responsible for the later development of cardiomyopathy. Mean arterial pressure was increased (P<.05) in conscious, chronically instrumented TG mice (123+/-1 mm Hg) compared with age-matched wild-type (WT) control mice (103+/-1 mm Hg). Respiratory frequency was increased (P<.05) in TG mice (269+/-26/min) compared with WT mice (210+/-20/min). By use of telemetric techniques, baseline heart rate (HR) was elevated (P<.05) in conscious, untethered TG mice (696+/-13 bpm) compared with WT mice (568+/-28 bpm). Intrinsic HR, after propranolol and atropine or after ganglionic blockade with hexamethonium, was not different between TG and WT mice. Both the normal minute-to-minute and circadian variations of HR observed in WT mice were markedly blunted in TG mice. HR variability was assessed by the time-domain and frequency-domain methods. At baseline, time-domain analysis indices were reduced (P<.05) in TG mice compared with WT mice. Although the low frequency (LF) component was higher (P<.05) than the high frequency (HF) component in WT mice, the LF component was less (P<.05) than the HF component in TG mice. In addition, arterial baroreflex regulation of HR was markedly blunted in TG mice in response to both nitroglycerin-induced hypotension and phenylephrine-induced hypertension. The reduced LF/HF ratio in TG mice was surprising in view of enhanced beta-adrenergic signaling and may be due to reduced neural tone secondary to the elevated arterial pressure or alterations in arterial baroreflex control. Dobutamine infusion in WT mice also resulted in depressed HR variability. The combination of elevated baseline HR, arterial pressure, and respiratory frequency suggests that enhanced beta-adrenergic signaling in TG mice results in reduced HR variability, in terms of both minute-to-minute variability and the lack of circadian variations in HR. The lack of normal HR variability in general and the failure of HR to decline, even during sleep, may actually be critical mechanisms contributing to the ultimate development of cardiomyopathy in these animals.", 
    "65": "The objectives of this study were to assess current practice patterns in pharmacotherapy for congestive heart failure at an academic medical center and to analyze temporal trends in management of congestive heart failure from 1990 to 1995. Records of all patients discharged from the hospital in 1990 or 1995 with a primary diagnosis of congestive heart failure who also underwent echocardiography were found by a search of the hospital's medical records database. All charts were reviewed, and relevant clinical data, including all discharge medications, were recorded. On the basis of echocardiograms, patients were classified as having preserved or impaired left ventricular systolic function (estimated ejection fraction > or =45% versus <45%). The use of digoxin, diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium and beta-blockers, nitrates, and hydralazine in 1990 and 1995 were compared in subgroups according to left ventricular function. A total of 297 patients were identified who fulfilled study criteria and for whom all pertinent data were available (1990, n = 109; 1995, n = 188). The median age was 74 years; 37.3% of the patients were men, and 45.1% were white. Among patients with impaired systolic function, the proportion receiving either an ACE inhibitor or the combination of nitrates and hydralazine increased from 80.9% in 1990 to 95.4% in 1995 (p = 0.009). In addition, among patients treated with an ACE inhibitor, the proportion receiving an optimal dose increased from 24.3% in 1990 to 61.5% in 1995 (p < 0.001). The use of beta-blockers also increased significantly during this time period (2.1% versus 15.7%; p = 0.031 ). Among patients with preserved ventricular function, the use of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers increased from 1990 to 1995 (both p < 0.05). The use of other medications did not change for either subgroup. Current use of appropriate vasodilator therapy at an academic medical center is very high and is in accordance with published guidelines for the management of congestive heart failure. The use of vasodilators and beta-blockers has increased significantly since 1990 among patients with congestive heart failure with either impaired or preserved left ventricular contractility.", 
    "66": "The accumulation of medication taken regularly can influence its clinical effects, cumulative toxicities and steady-state equivalent doses to similar agents, and the elimination of concurrent medications. A basic expression of drug accumulation, the Unit Dose Accumulation Ratio (UDAR), is defined as the ratio of the day-average blood drug concentration at steady-state to the peal blood drug concentration after one dose. In a single-compartment analysis the UDAR is found to equal 0.0601 multiplied by the elimination half-life (in hours). The UDARs estimated in this way approximate those found from measurements of valproic acid, desipramine, and reboxetine. Further modeling reveals that in common situations graduality of release has only small effects on UDARs. Extension to multiexponential elimination is described by simple expressions in terms of ratios of kinetic coefficients. Modeling of accumulation with biexponential elimination is depicted on a graph. Several applications of the UDAR are illustrated. The UDAR permits determination of steady-state dose equivalences from single dose equivalences and vice-versa. This facilitates medication interchange, as in clinical withdrawal management by replacement of short-acting sedative-hypnotics with long-acting agents, e.g., alprazolam with clonazepam. The UDAR reflects tolerance, e.g., if 30-mg flurazepam equals 4-mg lorazepam, the UDAR indicates that at steady-state, 30 mg/day of flurazepam approximates 21 mg/day of lorazepam. The UDAR can estimate total exposure, e.g., to organic chlorine. The UDAR complements methods described previously for drug dose prediction and blood drug level monitoring that were simplified by expressing blood levels as averages over the day.",

    "75": "In most patients of myocardial infarction, beta-blockers are used for secondary prophylaxis and a treadmill test is required for risk stratification. To study the effect of oral beta-blockers on interpretation of treadmill test, 54 consecutive patients were subjected to treadmill test four to six weeks after myocardial infarction. Fourteen patients with strongly positive treadmill test were referred for coronary angiography. Treadmill test was repeated in 37 patients 72 hours after withdrawal of beta-blockers. The peak exercise heart rate was significantly different while off and on beta-blockers (148 +/- 13 bpm vs 124 +/- 14 bpm, respectively; p < 0.01). The test was negative on both the occasions in 17 patients. On stopping beta-blockers, the negative test became mildly positive in five and strongly positive in six patients. The mildly positive test became strongly positive in four patients and remained almost unchanged in five. In 10 patients there was conversion of negative or mildly positive treadmill test into strongly positive result after withdrawal of beta-blockers. Thus the risk stratification changed significantly in 27 percent patients. It is suggested that beta-blockers can and should be withdrawn in post-MI patients before doing treadmill test.", 
    "76": "The relationship between depolarization-induced exocytosis and inward Ca2+ current (Ica) in single isolated rat pancreatic beta cells was investigated in perforated patch recordings. Ica was elicited by depolarization and change in cell membrane capacitance (Cm) was monitored as an indicator of resultant exocytosis. While there was significant variety of change in Cm and Ca2+ influx, the increase in Cm had positive correlation with Ca2+ influx and also with duration of depolarization. Removal of extracellular Ca2+ or inclusion of extracellular Cd2+ (100 microM) completely eliminated both Ica and increase in Cm following depolarization. Dihydropyridine (DHP) Ca2+ channel blocker (5 microM) partly and in parallel suppressed depolarization-induced peak Ica, Ca2+ influx, and change in Cm. These data suggest that rat pancreatic beta cell expresses at least two types of Ca2+ channels; Ca2+ entry through these DHP-sensitive, presumably L-type, and DHP-insensitive channels triggers exocytosis with similar efficacy.", 
    "77": "Carvedilol, a multiple action neurohumoral antagonist, has been reported recently to significantly reduce mortality in congestive heart failure (CHF) patients. In addition to being a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, one of the unique aspects of the biological effects of carvedilol is that it is also a potent antioxidant with antimitogenic properties. As there is a significant correlation between plasma immunoreactive endothelin-1 (ET-1) levels and the severity of CHF, the present study was designed to determine the effects of carvedilol on ET-1 biosynthesis in cultured human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs). HCAECs were treated with carvedilol 15 min prior to the addition of serum and ET-1 levels were measured in the cell culture conditioned medium 24 h later. Carvedilol (10 microM) significantly inhibited basal ET-1 production in HCAECs by 62 +/- 8%. Carvedilol produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of serum-mediated stimulation of ET-1 biosynthesis with an IC50 = 1.2 microM. PreproET-1 mRNA expression was also inhibited by carvedilol. Other beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, such as propranolol (10 microM) or celiprolol (10 microM), did not effect ET-1 biosynthesis. Furthermore, the antioxidant probucol (10 microM) did not effect ET-1 production. Immunohistochemical analysis of HCAECs demonstrated that resting HCAECs have expression of ET-1 and can be inhibited by carvedilol. The results of the present study demonstrate that serum stimulation of HCAECs produced an increase in ET-1 expression, and carvedilol treatment caused a marked decrease in stimulated ET-1 expression as compared to serum-treated HCAECs. These data indicate that carvedilol directly inhibits the biosynthesis of ET-1 in HCAECs, and this effect may contribute to its vasodilating and antiproliferative actions. Furthermore, these effects may contribute to the ability of carvedilol to improve clinical outcome in CHF patients.", 
    "78": "A simple assay format was developed for the direct detection of C. trachomatis rRNA utilizing ligation of recombinant MDV-1 probe RNA fragments hybridized to 23S rRNA after capture and release from a solid support. Assay background (equivalent to 10(4) targets) was suppressed by blocking sequences in the 5' MDV reporter probe fragment complementary to the 3' fragment by prehybridization of a DNA oligonucleotide. A pair of reporter fragments bearing a deletion within the region, obtained by a hydrid-selection-amplification protocol, yielded a low level of assay background which was reduced to < 2% with a blocker directed against the remaining pairing sequence. This probe set showed a sensitivity of 10(3) molecules of 23S rRNA (> 95% responding) and could detect a single elementary body (EB) of Chlamydia trachomatis or 1-10 EB added to a clinical matrix of pooled negative human cervical swab samples. The time of first appearance of amplification products by real-time fluorescence detection showed a linear response to log increases in the target level over a 10(5)-fold range, permitting the determination of target level within an order of magnitude. The assay showed approximately 10(9)-fold discrimination over Chlamydia pneumonae (TWAR) rRNA. High levels of cultured C. albicans, E. coli, S. aureus, or N. gonorrhoeae had no detectable effect on assay background or the ability to detect a single elementary body.",

Data are lacking about the comparative knowledge and practice of emergency physicians, cardiologists, and primary care practitioners regarding conditions commonly treated by all three groups, eg, AMI.", 
    "81": "A survey of 1,045 emergency physicians, nationally, was conducted in 1995 regarding five short-term pharmacologic interventions employed for many years in the standard treatment of AMI. The emergency physicians were questioned about the effect on survival of each intervention and the likelihood that they would prescribe each intervention. The findings were then compared with previously published data on the knowledge and practice of cardiologists and primary care practitioners obtained in New York and Texas in 1993. Identical clinical queries and eligibility criteria were employed in all groups.", 
    "82": "The responding emergency physicians' knowledge was similar or significantly greater than that of responding cardiologists for the effect on survival of most of the short-term interventions, and their practice patterns were similar or significantly better than responding cardiologists for all interventions studied. Emergency physicians and cardiologists had significantly better knowledge and practice in this area compared with responding primary care practitioners.", 
    "83": "For the management of AMI, emergency physicians, on average, have a similar or greater awareness of the effects on survival and similar or better practice patterns regarding most acute pharmacologic interventions when compared with those of cardiologists; both groups, on average, have a superior knowledge and practice when compared with primary care practitioners. These results illustrate the importance of emergency medicine and support further consideration of an expanding role for the emergency physician in the nation's evolving health-care system.", 
    "84": "A rapid and simple high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with amperometric detection has been developed for the quantitation of labetalol in urine. The chromatography was performed at 30 degrees C using a reversed-phase column with a base deactivated silica stationary support and an alkylamide bonded phase (Supelcosil ABZ+Plus). A 5 mM acetate buffer (pH 4.5)-acetonitrile (70:30, v/v) mixture was employed as the mobile phase, pumped at a flow-rate of 1 ml/min. Sample preparation was carried out using a simple solid-phase extraction (SPE) procedure, and recoveries higher than 85% were achieved. The method was found to be accurate, precise (R.S.D lower than 8%), and sensitive enough (experimental quantitation limit of 20 ng/ml, detection limit 10 ng/ml) to be applied to doping analysis and pharmacokinetic studies in human urine. The method was applied to the determination of labetalol in pharmaceutical formulations and urine samples obtained from a healthy volunteer after the ingestion of a therapeutic dose of the drug, and the results obtained were in agreement with the pharmacokinetic data.", 
    "85": "Angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) mediates the vasoconstrictive and growth-promoting effect of angiotensin II in humans. It has been reported that a polymorphism of the AT1 gene (an A/C transversion at position 1166: A-C1166) occurs more frequently in resistant hypertensives taking two or more antihypertensive drugs. On the contrary, a recent study of the influence of the A-C1166 polymorphism on aortic stiffness demonstrated that the distribution of the genotypes did not differ between normotensive and hypertensive subjects. In addition, a recent population-based survey of Caucasian hypertensives reported lower blood pressure values in CC homozygotes than in heterozygotes and AA homozygotes. Because of these controversial results and the lack of a sufficient amount of data the present study was designed to assess the contribution of the AT, gene A-C1166 polymorphism to resistant essential hypertension. Forty-eight subjects with resistant essential hypertension (HT) and 48 normotensive (NT), age and sex-adjusted controls (from a population of 300 healthy blood donors) were selected. All subjects were genotyped for the A-C1166 polymorphism in the 3'-UTR of the AT1 gene using PCR-based techniques. The influence of genotype on blood pressure (BP) was investigated using ANOVA Randomized Complete Block (ANOVA RCB) design according to sex, age and BMI. There were no significant differences in allele or genotype frequencies between HT and NT subjects (X2 = 0.61; P = NS). In HT subjects higher values of systolic blood pressure were associated with the C allele of the AT1 gene only in older and overweight patients (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). Also in HT patients an association between the presence of the C allele of the AT1 gene and higher values of diastolic blood pressure was present in overweight patients (P = 0.001). These results suggest that in resistant hypertensive subjects the AT1 A-C1166 polymorphism is potentially involved in the regulation of blood pressure. As the effects of genotypes on blood pressure are pronounced in older and overweight subjects this polymorphism may amplify the effects of age and BMI on resistant essential hypertension.", 
    "86": "DL-threo-beta-Benzyloxyaspartate (DL-TBOA), a novel derivative of DL-threo-beta-hydroxyaspartate, was synthesized and examined as an inhibitor of sodium-dependent glutamate/aspartate (excitatory amino acid) transporters. DL-TBOA inhibited the uptake of [14C]glutamate in COS-1 cells expressing the human excitatory amino acid transporter-1 (EAAT1) (Ki = 42 microM) with almost the same potency as DL-threo-beta-hydroxyaspartate (Ki = 58 microM). With regard to the human excitatory amino acid transporter-2 (EAAT2), the inhibitory effect of DL-TBOA (Ki = 5.7 microM) was much more potent than that of dihydrokainate (Ki = 79 microM), which is well known as a selective blocker of this subtype. Electrophysiologically, DL-TBOA induced no detectable inward currents in Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing human EAAT1 or EAAT2. However, it significantly reduced the glutamate-induced currents, indicating the prevention of transport. The dose-response curve of glutamate was shifted by adding DL-TBOA without a significant change in the maximum current. The Kb values for human EAAT1 and EAAT2 expressed in X. laevis oocytes were 9.0 microM and 116 nM, respectively. These results demonstrated that DL-TBOA is, so far, the most potent competitive blocker of glutamate transporters. DL-TBOA did not show any significant effects on either the ionotropic or metabotropic glutamate receptors. Moreover, DL-TBOA is chemically much more stable than its benzoyl analog, a previously reported blocker of excitatory amino acid transporters; therefore, DL-TBOA should be a useful tool for investigating the physiological roles of transporters.", 
    "87": "UGT2B7 has been cloned and expressed previously in COS cells and HK293 cells. Two forms have been identified: one with a tyrosine and one with a histidine at position 268. UGT2B7 has been shown to catalyze NSAIDs, catechol estrogens, and morphine-3- and -6-glucuronidation. cDNAs for UGT2B7Y268 and H268 were cloned and stably expressed in HK 293 cells. Studies were designed to test each form for reactivity toward a number of opioid compounds, xenobiotics such as menthol, oxazepam, and propranolol, and androgens such as androsterone and testosterone using membrane preparations derived from HK 293 cells. Both UGT2B7Y and UGT2B7H are highly reactive with many opioids, menthol, androsterone, and (R)- and (S)-propranolol, and similar kinetic values were observed. UGT2B7Y and UGT2B7H react poorly with oxazepam and no difference in (R)- or (S)-glucuronidation rate ratios was found. Thus, UGT2B7Y and H cannot account for the variability in the plasma or urine concentrations of these glucuronides in human populations. Our data suggest that UGT2B7 is a major isoform responsible for the glucuronidation of androsterone. Neither UGT2B7Y nor H catalyzes the glucuronidation of testosterone although each catalyzes the glucuronidation of epitestosterone. UGT2B7 seems to be a major human isoform responsible for the glucuronidation of opioids of the morphinan and oripavine class and is capable of catalyzing the glucuronidation of both the 3- and 6-hydroxyl moieties on these molecules. Thus, UGT2B7 plays a major role in the conversion of morphine to morphine-6-glucuronide, the potent analgesic metabolite of morphine.", 
    "88": "Beta-adrenergic involvement in classical conditioning and extinction was investigated. Five groups of rabbits (saline, 1, 3, 5 or 10 mg kg(-1) of the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol) were trained with a tone conditioned stimulus (CS) paired with a corneal air puff unconditioned stimulus (US). Both 5 mg kg(-1) and 10 mg kg(-1) propranolol delayed acquisition of conditioned responses but all groups were able to learn the task to criterion. Consistent changes were not seen during extinction.", 
    "89": "The effects of the alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist SL84.0418 and its two enantiomers, (+) deriglidole and (-)SL86.0714 on glucose and insulin levels were examined in mice and in neonatal streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. It was recently demonstrated in mouse pancreatic beta-cells that both deriglidole and SL86.0714 inhibit ATP-sensitive K+ channel with similar potency whereas alpha2-adrenoceptors are blocked only by deriglidole. In the present study, we showed, in vivo in mice, that SL84.0418 and deriglidole potently reduced glycemia and antagonized diazoxide-induced hyperglycemia, whereas SL86.0714 and tolbutamide were markedly less potent. In diabetic rats, SL84.0418 and deriglidole (10 mg/kg i.p.) fully normalized glucose tolerance whereas SL86.0714 and tolbutamide only slightly improved it. Five min after deriglidole administration in mice a marked and short lasting rise in insulin levels was observed, followed by a progressive reduction of glycemia. In diabetic rats, insulin and norepinephrine levels rose 15 min after deriglidole administration. Sympathetic outflow blockade by chlorisondamine, beta-adrenoceptor blockade by propranolol or their combination markedly reduced deriglidole-induced rise in insulin levels in a similar manner. Furthermore, in chlorisondamine-treated animals norepinephrine levels were strongly lowered and not modified by deriglidole and propranolol administration. However, in spite of sympathetic outflow and beta-adrenoceptor blockade, a moderate rise in insulinemia was still observed after deriglidole administration. Taken together these data demonstrate that deriglidole is the enantiomer that mediates the antihyperglycemic and insulin secretory effects of SL84.0418. Our study suggests that the major part of deriglidole effects is the consequence of the blockade of prejunctional alpha2-adrenoceptors that have reinforced the release of catecholamines in adrenergic nerve endings and indirectly activated postjunctional beta-adrenoceptors to further potentiate insulin secretion. However, it is also suggested that another undefined mechanism is involved in deriglidole potentiation of insulin secretion.", 
    "90": "A new indicator dilution technique for measurement of cardiac output is described. Lithium chloride is injected via a central venous catheter and its dilution curve measured in arterial blood using a lithium-selective electrode. We assessed the lithium dilution cardiac output measurement (LiDCO) and a conventional thermodilution cardiac output measurement (ThDCO) by comparing the results of both with cardiac output determined by electromagnetic flowmetry (EMCO) under controlled laboratory conditions in 10 swine. They were monitored with a pulmonary artery catheter, femoral artery catheter and electromagnetic flowmeter placed around the ascending aorta. LiDCO, ThDCO and EMCO measurements were determined at baseline, in a hyperdynamic state produced by administration of dobutamine, at a second baseline and finally in a hypodynamic state induced by propranolol during deep anaesthesia. Data were analysed by linear regression analysis and the comparison method described by Bland and Altman; bias and precision of both LiDCO and ThDCO compared with EMCO were calculated by the method of Sheiner and Beal. The correlation coefficient between LiDCO and EMCO (0.95) was higher than that between ThDCO and EMCO (0.87). The precision value of LiDCO (0.04) was significantly less (i.e. better) than that of ThDCO (0.09). The results of this study indicated that LiDCO was more reliable compared with conventional ThDCO.", 
    "91": "In this study we examined the ability of compounds varying in their in vitro potencies as inhibitors of dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE) or serotonin (5-HT) reuptake to enhance the discriminative stimulus (DS) effects of cocaine. Compounds were administered in combination with cocaine (2.5 mg/kg i.p.) to rats trained to discriminate a low dose from a high dose of cocaine (2.5 vs. 10 mg/kg i.p.) in a two-lever, FR10 drug discrimination paradigm. All the monoamine reuptake blockers produced high-dose-appropriate responding in a dose-related manner when combined with a low dose of cocaine, but compounds from other pharmacological classes (benztropine, caffeine, diazepam, or 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin) did not enhance the DS effects of cocaine. Analysis of the relationship between behavioral and in vitro biochemical potencies indicated that inhibition of DA and 5-HT transport is responsible for the cocaine-enhancing effects of the monoamine reuptake blockers we examined. In contrast, NE reuptake apparently does not play a strong role, despite the finding that desipramine, talsupram and nortriptyline enhanced the DS effects of cocaine. However, pretreatment with the alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist prazosin failed to alter completely the ability of desipramine to enhance the DS effects of the low training dose of cocaine, but did produce dose-related decreases in the cocaine-enhancing effects of the beta adrenergic antagonist propranolol (10 mg/kg i.p.). These findings suggested that, under some conditions, NE interactions can modulate the DS effects of cocaine. In all, the results confirm reports that monoamine reuptake blockers enhance the DS effects of cocaine and indicate that 5-HT and DA can effectively modulate the DS effects of cocaine, but suggest that NE interactions may be relatively less important in the rat.", 
    "92": "There is continuing uncertainty about whether morbidity and mortality of treated hypertensive patients depends on the drug(s) used to treat or only on the level of blood pressure achieved. This study was undertaken in a sample of special Veterans Administration hypertension clinics to determine which antihypertensive drugs were selected by the involved healthcare providers and how effective they were in achieving normotension. Hypertensive veterans (n = 6100) were followed in six VA Hypertension Screening and Treatment Program clinics for 46 months beginning in May 1989. Their average age was 60.7 years; 53% lived in the Stroke Belt; 46% had target organ damage, 36% were black, 23% smoked, and 10% had diabetes mellitus. Antihypertensive regimens were divided into 12 all-inclusive categories. Blood pressures were averaged at the last study visit for all patients on a regimen. The regimens of diuretic or diuretic plus beta-blocker gave the lowest average pressures (140.6/82.3 mm Hg) and calcium antagonist the highest (149.0/86.5 mm Hg). ANOVA indicated that differences between seven common regimens and also between the four single drug regimens were highly significant (P<.0001). This pattern of low treated pressure with the \"old\" agents and higher treated pressure with newer agents was reflected in the percentage of patients controlled below 140/90 mm Hg and the percentage uncontrolled above 159/94 mm Hg. Blacks and patients with target organ damage resembled the entire cohort in average treated diastolic blood pressure, but the former had lower and the latter had higher treated systolic blood pressure than the entire cohort.", 
    "93": "Stimulation of nonadrenergic noncholinergic (NANC) nerves elicits relaxation of canine cerebral arteries via the nitric oxide (NO)-cGMP pathway. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of halothane and isoflurane on the relaxant response of isolated canine cerebral arteries to NANC nerve stimulation. The isometric tension of isolated canine cerebral arteries, which had been denuded of endothelium, was measured in a tissue bath. The application of transmural electrical stimulation (TES) at a frequency of 5 Hz elicited a transient relaxation of arteries partially contracted with prostaglandin F2alpha. This effect was abolished by treatment with N(G)-nitro-L-arginine (3 x 10[-5] M), 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (10[-5] M), or tetrodotoxin (10[-6] M). Treatment with halothane (2.3%) or isoflurane (2.3% and 3.5%) attenuated the relaxant response to TES (P < 0.05). Halothane (2.3%) but not isoflurane (2.3% and 3.5%) attenuated relaxation induced by s-nitro-N-acetylpenicillamine. We suggest that halothane and isoflurane inhibit cerebroarterial vasodilation mediated via NO-cGMP pathway activated by stimulation of the NANC nerves. The sites of action of halothane and isoflurane on the NO-cGMP pathway may differ.",

    "95": "In anorexia nervosa (AN), growth hormone (GH) hypersecretion and low insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) levels are present. It is unclear whether this is due to a peripheral GH resistance and a reduced IGF-I negative feedback on GH secretion or to a primary hypothalamic dysfunction. In AN, in contrast to normal subjects, cholinergic antagonists and agonists, whose action is somatostatin (SS)-mediated, have reduced and absent effects on the GH response to growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH). Since arginine, another substance acting via inhibition of SS, maintains its potentiating effect on GH secretion in AN, it has been hypothesized that somewhat specific alteration of the SS-mediated cholinergic influence may be present in this condition. To further clarify the neural control of AH secretion in AN, we evaluated the effects of beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists, which are known to inhibit and increase, respectively, the GHRH-induced GH secretion in normal subjects.", 
    "96": "We studied the effect of atenolol (ATE), a beta 1-adrenergic antagonist, and salbutamol (SALB), a beta 2-adrenergic agonist, on the GHRH-induced GH release in 10 patients with AN and in 10 normal age-matched women (NW).", 
    "97": "Basal GH levels were higher, whereas IGF-I were lower in AN than in NW. The GHRH-induced GH rise in AN was higher than that in NW. ATE significantly enhanced the GH response to GHRH in NW, but not in AN. The GH responses to GHRH after ATE pretreatment were similar in NW and in AN. The GH response to GHRH was inhibited by SALB in both NW and AN. The GH responses to GHRH after SALB pretreatment were similar in NW and AN.", 
    "98": "These data reveal an exaggerated somatotrope responsiveness to GHRH in AN that is not further increased by beta-adrenergic blockade, while is abolished by beta-adrenergic activation.

Suppose that an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis shows a significant difference between the randomized groups. We may want to ask questions about the reason for such a difference in outcome between randomized groups: for example, was the difference due to different policies for change to a third more beneficial regime? We address such questions using the semi-parametric accelerated life models of Robins, which exploit the randomization assumption fully and avoid direct comparisons of possibly differently selected subgroups. No assumption is made about the relationship of treatment actually prescribed to prognosis. A sensitivity analysis, using a range of plausible values for the causal effect of a covariate, estimates the contrasts between randomized groups that would have been observed if the covariate had universally been 0. The main technical problem is in dealing with censoring, for the method requires different degrees of recensoring for different values of the causal effect, and this can lead to estimates of low precision. The methods are applied to a randomized comparison of two anti-hypertensive treatments in which approximately half the subjects changed treatment during follow-up. Various time-dependent covariates, representing patterns of side-effects and treatments, are used in the model. We find that the observed difference in cardiovascular deaths between the randomized groups cannot be explained in this way by their different covariate patterns.",

In contrast, propranolol eluted with two peaks at approximately 18 and 128 s after dosing. 3. There was no significant difference in dose-corrected area under the outflow curve (AUC) for [14C]-sucrose, antipyrine or [14C]-taurocholate between the first and second doses whereas the mean propranolol AUC for the second dose was only 0.577+/-0.439 that for the first dose (P<0.05). 4.

Swelling experiments in toluene were run in order to evaluate the network characteristics. The silicone elastomer was loaded with salicylic acid and propranolol hydrochloride and their delivery in distilled water was followed. The results showed that release is almost of zero order for high loading of salicylic acid, while delivery seems to be diffusion controlled up to a certain limit. The administered drug concentrations are relatively low if silicone discs are used, due to the hydrophobic nature of this material. On the other hand, when membranes are used with a thickness of 0.1-0.2 mm, then the delivery rate is much higher depending of course on the hydrophilic character of the drug.",

We studied the relationship between changes in cerebral blood velocity (transcranial Doppler), rectus femoris blood oxygenation (near-infrared spectroscopy) and systemic blood flow (cardiac output from model flow analysis of the arterial pressure wave) as induced by dynamic exercise of large (cycling) vs. small muscle groups (rhythmic handgrip) before and after cardioselective beta 1 adrenergic blockade (0.15 mg kg-1 metoprolol i.v.). During rhythmic handgrip, the increments in systemic haemodynamic variables as in middle cerebral artery mean blood velocity were not influenced significantly by metoprolol. In contrast, during cycling (e.g. 113 W), metoprolol reduced the increase in cardiac output (222 +/- 13 vs. 260 +/- 16%), heart rate (114 +/- 3 vs. 135 +/- 7 beats min-1) and mean arterial pressure (103 +/- 3 vs. 112 +/- 4 mmHg), and the increase in cerebral artery mean blood velocity also became lower (from 59 +/- 3 to 66 +/- 3 vs. 60 +/- 2 to 72 +/- 3 cm s-1; P < 0.05). Likewise, during cycling with metoprolol, oxyhaemoglobin in the rectus femoris muscle became reduced (compared to rest: -4.8 +/- 1.8 vs. 1.2 +/- 1.7 mumol L-1, P < 0.05). Neither during rhythmic handgrip nor during cycling was the arterial carbon dioxide tension affected significantly by metoprolol.

This stability allowed backbone-amide temperature coefficients to be interpreted, and the correlation of these values with hydrogen bonds observed in the structures and with solvent exchange rates is discussed. pKa values have been measured for Asp5, His19 and Tyr23, and the contributions to these pKa values from other residues investigated using the analogues R11Q (denoting substitution of Argll with Gln), R11E, H19K, K22A, Y23A and K30A. These results show that Asp5 (pKa 2.8) makes an electrostatic interaction with Lys30, which may be partially responsible for the importance of these side chains in the folding of synthetic toxin. The phenolic pKa of Tyr23 is reduced to 8.7 in the native toxin, as a result of interactions with the positively charged side chains of Arg11 and to a lesser extent Lys22. Several hydrogen bonds between the Arg11 guanidino group and the Tyr23 phenolic group are found in the solution structures. As these three residues are implicated in the tight binding of ShK toxin to the T-lymphocyte voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.3, their close interactions should be taken into account in models of binding of this toxin to the pore and vestibule of this and other potassium channels.", 
    "119": "Overall thirty six persons with artificial pacemaker (AP), presenting with stage I-II hypertensive disease were examined. Effects of obzidan on cardiohemodynamics (CHD) were studied with single administration and course treatment over two weeks depending on the type of circulation. In hyperkinetic type effects of obzidan on AP and CHD were more pronounced than in eu- and hypokinetic types. But latter subjects developed clinical signs of cardiac insufficiency growing progressively worse. It was found out that cardiohemodynamic effects of obzidan in patients with AP depend upon particular features of intracardiac hemodynamics in ventricular electric stimulation (fixed cardiac rhythm, atrioventricular dissociation, pathologic asynchrony of ventricles) and initial type of circulation.", 
    "120": "Overall thirty-eight patients with exertional angina who had episodes of asymptomatic change of position of T-segment were examined. The above patients were divided into two groups: group I was placed on anaprilin treatment (80-120 mg daily), group II received corinfar (60 mg daily). Episodes of asymptomatic ischemia of the myocardium (AIM) showed two peaks in their 24 h-span occurrence, with the greatest number of these being recordable in early morning hours (from six a.m. to noon), somewhat less--within the time span 12 o'clock-0.6 p.m. Anaprilin monotherapy is more effective than corinfar monotherapy in respect to reduction of AIM episodes occurrences. However, corinfar, unlike anaprilin, prevented the appearance of the evening peak of episodes of \"silent\" ischemia.", 
    "121": "Overall sixty-two patients, in different age brackets, with cirrhosis of the liver were examined. Of these, 42 presented with anemia, while 20 with no anemia. All patients were evaluated for activity of lipid peroxidation and state of the antioxidant systems. Cirrhotic patients with anemia displayed more profound dysfunction of antioxidant systems. This led to disorganization of the erythrocytic membranes' lipid and protein components, worsening of their rheologic properties, causing morbid shifts in the receptors' function. The above pathologies combined affect the degree of anemia in cirrhotic patients. Anemic syndrome in this patient population was managed with anaprilin, a beta-adrenoblocker.", 
    "122": "1 Reactive oxygen species have been demonstrated to play a critical role in post-ischaemic tissue injury. The present experiment was designed to evaluate the effects of SB 211475, a hydroxylated metabolite of the new beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, carvedilol, on rat splanchnic ischaemia (SI, 60 min) and reperfusion(R)-induced shock and tissue injury. 2 Administration of SB 211475 two min before R attenuated SI/R injury in a dose-dependent manner. At doses of 0.5 mg kg(-1) and 1.0 mg kg(-1), SB 211475 exerted significant anti-shock and endothelial protective effects, characterized by prolonged survival times, increased survival rates, attenuated increases in tissue myeloperoxidase activity and haematocrits, and preserved endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation. 3 Administration of 1 mg kg(-1) carvedilol attenuated shock-induced tissue injury and endothelial dysfunction. However, administration of 0.5 mg kg(-1) carvedilol had no protective effects on post-ischaemic tissue injury. 4 Previous studies have shown that SB 211475 has virtually no beta-blocking activity but possesses more potent antioxidant activity than carvedilol. In the present study, SB 211475 exerted more potent protective effects than the parent compound, suggesting that this metabolite of carvedilol is superior to carvedilol with regard to its protection against post-ischaemia tissue injury.",

During a mean follow-up of 34+/-32 months, an arrhythmic event occurred in 14 symptomatic patients (34%) and 6 asymptomatic patients (27%). An automatic defibrillator was implanted in 35 patients, 15 received pharmacological therapy with beta-blockers and/or amiodarone, and 13 did not receive treatment The incidence of arrhythmic events was similar in all therapy groups (log-rank 0.86); however, total mortality was 0% in the implantable defibrillator group, 26% in the pharmacological group, and 31% in the no therapy group (log-rank 0.0005). All mortality was due to sudden death.",

The first-degree relatives were classified as affected (QTc >0.47), borderline (QTc=0.45 to 0.47), and unaffected (QTc <0.45). Cardiac events were defined as the combined incidence of long QT syndrome-related death, aborted cardiac arrest, and syncope. The incidence of cardiac events was compared during equal prepregnancy, pregnancy, and postpartum intervals (40 weeks each). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed by use of a mixed-effects model to identify independent predictors of cardiac events among probands. The pregnancy and postpartum intervals were not associated with cardiac events among first-degree relatives. The postpartum interval was independently associated with cardiac events among probands (odds ratio [OR], 40.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.1 to 540; P=.01); the pregnancy interval was not associated with cardiac events. Treatment with beta-adrenergic blockers was independently associated with a decrease in the risk for cardiac events among probands (OR, 0.023; 95% CI, 0.001 to 0.44; P=.01).",

    "129": "All three subtypes of beta-adrenoceptors are coupled to stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity via the stimulatory guanine-nucleotide-binding protein. Nevertheless, the beta3 adrenoceptor (beta3-AR) differs significantly from the other subtypes in terms of pharmacology. Most strikingly, it recognizes as agonists several compounds acting as potent beta1-AR and beta2-AR antagonists. Furthermore, the human beta3-AR is quite different from the animal beta3-AR. Molecular modelling studies followed by site-directed mutagenesis was used here to identify some of the amino acid residues which may be implicated in ligand binding and signal transduction of the beta3-AR. Three contiguous residues, valine-leucine-alanine, which are present in the first transmembrane domain at positions 48-50 of the human receptor but are absent in all known rodent sequences, were thought to be important for species specificity. When these three residues were deleted from the human receptor, no 'rodent-like' pharmacological profile was obtained in terms of either binding or adenylyl cyclase activation. Glycine at position 53, also in the first transmembrane domain in the human beta3-AR, has been suggested to participate in beta2-/beta3-AR subtype selectivity. Replacement of this glycine residue by phenylalanine, which is the residue present at the homologous position in the human beta2-AR, left the beta3-AR pharmacological profile unaltered in terms of specificity and selectivity. Aspartate residue 117, in the third transmembrane domain, has been found to be essential for ligand binding and consequently adenylyl cyclase activation in several bioamine receptors. When this residue was replaced by a leucine residue in the beta3-AR, ligand binding and signal transduction were suppressed. Finally, replacement of asparagine at position 312 in the sixth transmembrane domain by an alanine residue, led to alterations in the signal-transduction pathway.",

We analyzed the quality of care rendered to 4300 Medicare beneficiaries seen at Maryland and District of Columbia hospitals with retrospectively confirmed acute myocardial infarction by evaluating the use of proven therapies. The proportion of patients ideal for therapies ranged from 10% for reperfusion to 100% for smoking cessation counseling. For ideal patients the following therapies were implemented: aspirin (87%), reperfusion therapy (64%), beta-blockers on discharge (60%), and smoking cessation counseling (41%). A substantial proportion of Medicare patients with acute myocardial infarction has one or more relative or absolute contraindications to standard regimens and therefore are not ideal therapeutic candidates. In the group of ideal patients, those with no therapeutic contraindications, a significant proportion do not receive these treatments.",

    "140": "1 The effects of mesaconitine, the main alkaloid contained in Aconiti tuber, were investigated by use of extracellular recordings of stimulus-evoked population spikes and field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (e.p.s.ps) in the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices. 2 At a concentration of 10 nM, mesaconitine evoked excitations, which were manifested as an increase in the amplitude of the orthodromic spike and the appearance of multiple spikes following the first postsynaptic spike, without affecting the magnitude of paired-pulse facilitation. The increase in spike amplitude was persistent and was not reversed by up to 90 min of washout. At concentrations of 30 and 100 nM, the alkaloid produced a biphasic effect, that is an excitation followed by an inhibition without having any effect upon the field e.p.s.p. At concentrations above 100 nM, mesaconitine suppressed the orthodromic population spike and the field e.p.s.p. 3 The excitatory effect was also observed when electrical stimulation was stopped completely during the application of mesaconitine (10 nM) and during the first 15 min of washout. 4 The enhancement of the population spike and the appearance of multiple spikes induced by mesaconitine (10-100 nM) were blocked by pretreatment with the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists propranolol (1 microM) and timolol (1 microM), whereas the inhibitory effect was blocked by the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists yohimbine (1 microM) and phentolamine (10 microM). However, when the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist timolol was added 10 min after the application of mesaconitine, it failed to block the long-lasting enhancement of the spike amplitude and the appearance of multiple population spikes. 5 Application of the selective beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline (500 nM) to the hippocampal slices induced an increase in the amplitude of the orthodromic population spike and elicited 2-3 additional spikes. Mesaconitine (10 nM) did not further potentiate this enhancement of the spike amplitude when added after a 15 min pretreatment with isoprenaline. 6 Perfusion of forskolin, which directly activates adenylate cyclase, enhanced the population spike. Mesaconitine had no additional effect when applied after pretreatment with forskolin. 7 It is concluded that the excitatory effects evoked by lower concentrations of the plant alkaloid mesaconitine are mediated by stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors and the consequent activation of intracellular processes which lead to the long-lasting changes in excitability.",

    "145": "Propranolol extraction in vivo by the left lobe of the fetal sheep liver is greater than that by the right lobe, and this may be due to the fact that oxygenation of the left lobe is greater than that of the right lobe. To explore this hypothesis, we studied the elimination of (R)-(+)-propranolol (PROP) by right and left lobes of the intact isolated perfused fetal sheep liver model, in which there is equal oxygenation of both liver lobes. After isolation of the liver, near-term fetal sheep livers (n = 11) were perfused (2.68 +/- 1.05 ml/g liver/min) in situ via the umbilical vein in a 1-liter recirculating system. PROP was infused (1.2 mg/hr) into the reservoir after an initial bolus dose (2.3 mg). Perfusate samples were taken from the common and right and left hepatic veins every 10 min for determination of PROP concentrations and oxygen consumption over the 180-min experimental period. Mean ductus venosus shunt through the liver was 42 +/- 21% of perfusate flow. Oxygen consumption was not significantly different between the left and right lobes of the liver (0.79 +/- 0.46 and 0.67 +/- 0.44 micromol/g liver/min, respectively, P > .05), nor was there any significant difference between lobes in PROP hepatic extraction at steady state (0.25 +/- 0.20 and 0.25 +/- 0.23, respectively, P > .05). This supports the hypothesis that the difference between lobes in PROP extraction in vivo may be due to the difference in degree of oxygenation of the left and right lobes that is known to be present in vivo.",

    "154": "Myocardial ischaemia and reperfusion cause dysfunction of the coronary vasculature leading to a sustained reduction in coronary blood flow and an impairment of responses to both endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vasodilators. In contrast, when previously ischaemic arteries are removed from the myocardium and vascular function is examined in vitro, it is evident that while endothelial function is impaired, smooth muscle reactivity remains intact. Therefore, other changes must be responsible for the general reduction in vasodilator reserve. Examination of the vasculature in the ischaemic myocardium by electron microscopy reveals adhesion of leukocytes and plugging of capillaries. There also is evidence that polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) release a factor that constricts coronary arterioles, and that release of this factor is increased by atherosclerosis. The identity of this factor remains uncertain, but the calcium antagonist amlodipine prevents the coronary vasoconstriction. Amlodipine is also able to prevent the impaired perfusion and the reduction in vasodilator reserve that occurs after myocardial ischaemia and reperfusion in the dog. In addition, amlodipine prevents the endothelial dysfunction observed in isolated arteries after ischaemia and reperfusion. The interaction between the endothelium and activated PMNs may be a suitable target for pharmacological intervention to improve postischaemic vascular function.",

    "159": "Despite their widespread use in atrial fibrillation, the effects of beta-adrenoceptor blockers on atrial and atrioventricular (AV) nodal refractoriness, and atrial fibrillatory rate during atrial fibrillation have been incompletely characterised. In particular, it is unknown whether additional sodium channel (class I) blocking effects play a role. Effects of bisoprolol (no class I effect) and metoprolol (mild class I effect) were therefore compared in 12 open-chest pigs. Atrial and AV-nodal effective refractory periods were determined at pacing cycle length 500 ms and 300 ms. Atrial fibrillation was then induced by premature stimulation and topical application of metacholine, and atrial fibrillatory intervals and ventricular intervals were recorded. After resumption of sinus rhythm, bisoprolol 0.1 mg/kg or metoprolol 0.3 mg/kg was administered, and measurements were repeated. Also, effects on plasma catecholamines and signal-averaged QRS duration were determined. Both bisoprolol and metoprolol prolonged atrial and AV-nodal effective refractory periods at both pacing cycle lengths, however, no differences were noted between the two drugs. No significant effects were observed on atrial and ventricular intervals during atrial fibrillation. Plasma catecholamines were low and unaffected by either drug, as was the QRS duration. It is concluded that the mild class I effect of metoprolol does not play a role in atrial fibrillation. Also, the results confirm the clinical notion that beta-blockers exert insignificant effects during atrial fibrillation in the setting of low sympathetic tone.",

Before exercise, hypertensive rats (regardless of gender) had an increased ST (+15 beats/min), increased resting HR (+12 beats/min), and decreased PT (-11 beats/min). Similarly, female rats (regardless of strain) also had an increased ST (+15 beats/min), increased resting HR (+39 beats/min), and decreased PT (-14 beats/min). Hypertensive rats had a significant reduction in AP (-17 +/- 3 mmHg), ST (-26 beats/min), PT (-7 beats/min), and HR (-14 beats/min) after exercise. In contrast, AP was not reduced in normotensive rats and ST (+18 beats/min) and HR (+42 beats/min) were increased in female normotensive rats after exercise. However, male normotensive rats had a postexercise reduction in ST (-14 beats/min) and HR (-19 beats/min). In summary, AP, ST, and resting HR were higher whereas PT was lower in hypertensive vs. normotensive rats. Furthermore, females had a higher resting HR, intrinsic HR, and ST and lower PT than male rats.

Training induced a greater increase in LV systolic shortening, assessed with two-dimensional echocardiography, in response to isoproterenol with a steeper slope of the fractional shortening-end-systolic wall stress (sigma es) relationship and an upward shift of the sigma es-systolic diameter relationship without an acute increase in heart rate or preload. The increase in the early-to-late diastolic flow velocity ratio, normalized for heart rate and preload, in response to isoproterenol was larger after training. LV systolic reserve and cardiac output during peak exercise were higher after training. beta-Adrenergic blockade with esmolol HCl abolished the adaptive increases in LV systolic reserve capacity and cardiac output during peak exercise in the trained state. The results suggest that one of the underlying mechanisms responsible for the adaptive increase in LV systolic function in response to exercise training is an enhanced inotropic sensitivity to catecholamines. Furthermore, the enhanced inotropic responses are associated with increased diastolic filling.", 
    "163": "Tannin, isolated from cotton bracts, inhibits chloride secretion in airway epithelium. In bovine tracheal epithelial cells, tannin (25 micrograms/ml) blunted isoproterenol (Iso)-stimulated adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation. Inhibition was time and dose dependent, with 52 +/- 5% (mean +/- SE, n = 6) inhibition at 60 min and 82 +/- 9% (n = 3) inhibition at 8 h. Inhibition was reversible starting at 4 h. Low-molecular-mass tannin (1,000-5,000 Da) had no effect on Iso-stimulated cAMP accumulation, whereas N-acetylcysteine, which interacts with cysteine residues, blocked the effects of tannin on Iso-stimulated cAMP accumulation. Tannin exposure (25 micrograms/ml for 30 min) had no effect on the dissociation constant (Kd) for [3H]dihydroalprenolol (DHA) (0.41 +/- 0.03 nM, n = 3) but decreased maximal binding from 252 +/- 32 to 162 +/- 36 fmol/mg protein. Using single-point analysis and [3H]CGP-12177, we determined that tannin (25 micrograms/ml for 4 h) decreased surface beta-adrenergic receptor density from 26.4 +/- 4.3 (n = 12) to 11.9 +/- 3.0 fmol/mg protein and that the decrease was dose dependent. Agonist binding affinity by Iso displacement of DHA demonstrated a two-site model (Kd values = 27 +/- 9 and 2,700 +/- 600 nM) and a ratio of high- to low-affinity receptors of 1:1. Tannin (25 micrograms/ml) steepened the curve and shifted it to the right, as did Gpp(NH)p. Gpp(NH)p had no further effect on the shape or position of the displacement curve in the presence of tannin. In contrast, when polymer length was decreased by oxidation, tannin had no effect on the DHA displacement curve. These data demonstrate that tannin reversibly desensitizes bovine tracheal epithelial cells to Iso, decreases beta-adrenergic receptor density, and uncouples the receptor from its stimulatory G protein. These data also suggest that the polymer length of tannin and its interaction with cysteine residues are important for these effects. These studies provide additional evidence for the role of tannin in the occupational lung disease byssinosis.", 
    "164": "Alveolar liquid clearance was examined in ventilated, anesthetized guinea pigs. An isosmolar 5% albumin solution was instilled into the lungs. Alveolar liquid clearance was studied over 1 h and was measured from the increase in alveolar protein concentration as water was reabsorbed. Basal alveolar liquid clearance was 38% of instilled volume. The high basal alveolar liquid clearance was not secondary to endogenous catecholamine release. Compared with control animals, epinephrine and the general beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol increased alveolar liquid clearance to approximately 50% of instilled volume (P < 0.05), whereas the beta 2-adrenergic agonist terbutaline was without effect. The stimulation of alveolar liquid clearance by epinephrine or isoproterenol was completely inhibited by the addition of the general beta-adrenergic inhibitor propranolol or the beta 1-adrenergic inhibitor atenolol. Alveolar liquid clearance was inhibited by the sodium-channel inhibitor amiloride by 30-40% in control animals and in animals treated with epinephrine or isoproterenol. Isoproterenol and epinephrine, but not terbutaline, increased adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate in in vitro incubated lung tissue. The results suggest that alveolar liquid clearance in guinea pigs is mediated partly through amiloride-sensitive sodium channels and that alveolar liquid clearance can be increased by stimulation of primarily beta 1-adrenergic receptors."
