    "0": "In acute experiments on the in utero foetal lamb, angiotensin II was a more potent pressor agent that either noradrenaline or adrenaline, and the response to angiotensin II was not consistently modified by the combined administration of alpha and beta-adrenergic blocking agents. A significant reduction in the pressor response of the foetus to angiotensin II and noradrenaline occurred with infusion of these compounds to the foetus by the umbilical artery when compared with the response obtained with infusions of the same doses of these drugs by the umbilical vein. Moreover, the concentration of angiotensin II (pg. ml-1) present in the foetal circulation was less following umbilical arterial infusions compared with umbilical vein infusions of the same doses. A similar reduction in the pressor activity of adrenaline and the cardio-stimulant effect of isoprenaline occurred when these drugs were infused by the umbilical artery. It is concluded that the foetus, like the adult animal, is more sensitive to angiotensin II than to catecholamines and that the biological activities of noradrenaline, angiotensin II, adrenaline and isoprenaline are reduced by perfusion through the foetal placenta.", 
    "1": "The rate of fluid reabsorption in the cauda epididymidis of rat has been measured in vitro. Both adrenaline and isoprenaline produced a prompt, reversible and dose dependent increase in the reabsorption rate. These effects were completely blocked by propranolol. The response to noradrenaline consisted of two components. In the presence of an alpha blocker, noradrenaline caused an increase, while in the presence of a beta blocker, it produced an inhibition in the rate of fluid reabsorption. The effects of these adrenergic agents were only observed when sodium ions were present in the intraluminal fluid, suggesting that they only affect the Na+-dependent component of fluid reabsorption. The possibility that they may affect the active transport of sodium in terms of the presence of alpha and beta receptors in the epithelium of the rat cauda epididymidis.", 
    "2": "The effects of propranolol, a noncardioselective beta-adrenergic blocking agent, and practolol, a cardioselective agent, on left ventricular function were compared in an awake dog model at an equiblocking dose range. Both agents produced modest depression of inotropic state at rest, and during volume and phenylephrine loading. No significant differences between the two agents were detected.", 
    "3": "Broken cell preparations derived from rat cerebral cortical grey matter were studied cytochemically to localize adenylate cyclase (AC) activity in subcellular organelle membranes. AC activity was localized by visualizing reaction product in brain particulate fractions by electron microscopy. Activity was found in the endoplasmic reticulum, on the inside of the inner mitochondrial membrane and on both leaflets of the nuclear membrane. Reaction product was found in the postsynaptic density area of most synapses. The reaction product tended to be more prominent in the presence of fluoride. A synaptosome-rich fraction was shown to have NE stimulated AC activity which was blocked in vitro by both a alpha- and an beta-blocker and in vivo by propranolol.", 
    "4": "Labetalol is a drug possessing both alpha and beta adrenergic receptor blocking properties. Its possible use in induced hypotension during halothane anaesthesia has been investigated. It causes a satisfactory decrease in arterial pressure unaccompanied by tachycardia. The circulatory effects of the drug during halothane anaesthesia, both with spontaneous and controlled respiration, have been measured and compared with those of halothane alone. In patients anaesthetised with 1% halothane, labetalol, with both spontaneous and controlled ventilation, was associated with a reduction in MAP from 71.5 mmHg to 54.0 mmHg (P less than 0.001) and 66.8 mmHg to 50.4 mmHg (P less than 0.001) respectively. This reduction was associated with decreases in Qt of 18% and 12% respectively. In the presence of labetalol, with 3% halothane and spontaneous respiration, the depressant effects of the anaesthetic on the heart became rapidly apparent: Qt was reduced by a further 28%. In patients not receiving labetalol, the depressant effects of 3% halothane were frequently countered by the positive inotropic effects of hypercarbia.", 
    "5": "The growth hormone (GH) reserve of 15 short children was evaluated with the levodopa-propranolol test (DPT) and the sequential arginine-insulin test (AIT). Four patients failed to respond to both tests and were classified as hyposomatotropic. In the other 11 children, the mean GH peak response to the DPT was significantly higher than that to the AIT, mainly because five subjects who had a normal response to the DPT failed to respond to the AIT. These children had a generally poor yearly growth increment prior to testing associated in three with an obvious emotional problem, and were found at follow-up to have resumed a normal growth pattern. These data confirm the effectiveness of the DPT as a test of GH reserve. Although hypoglycemia can occur occasionally during test, this procedure is safer and easier to perform than the widely used AIT. Finally, the DPT seems to detect a category of children who have a temporary growth failure and nonresponse to the usual GH tests but who are not hyposomatotropic and consequently do not require human GH.", 
    "6": "Vasorenal hypertension was reproduced in experiments on 18--22 day-old and 2--3-month-old puppies and on sexually-mature dogs by bilateral stenosis of the renal arteries. Two weeks later all the animals were given intravenous infusion of obzidan in a dose of 2 mg/kg. The arterial pressure, the minute and systolic volumes (MV, SV), total peripheral resistance (TPR), and the work, strength, and phase structure of the left ventricle were recorded. In animals aged 18--22 days with elevated pressure, obzidan infusion promoted its normalization, led to a decrease in the increased MO to subnormal values, a decrease in TPR and the heart beat rate, and normalization of the increased SV. In puppies aged 2--3 months, obzidan normalized the pressure by causing a fall in the minute output which was already reduced in hypertension, and a certain decrease in TPR with hardly any changes occurring in SV. In adult dogs, despite a sharp decrease in MV, arterial pressure did not significantly change due to the increase in TPR. Energy expenditure per each liter of MV was normalized by obzidan only in puppies.", 
    "7": "The microcirculation of the spinotrapezius muscle in normal and cold-acclimated (4 degrees C) rats was observed by an in vivo microscopic technique. The responses of the arterioles and venules in the skeletal muscle microcirculation to topical application of norepinephrine (NE) were recorded by a photomicrographic method. Results show that the skeletal muscle microcirculation possesses both alpha- and beta-adrenergic vascular receptors. Stimulation of the alpha-receptor results in vasoconstriction, and of the beta-receptor, vasodilatation. These microvascular responses are antagonized by specific alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockers. Cold-acclimation (4 degrees C) for 3 wk decreases the responses of the skeletal muscle microvessels to NE stimulation. This diminished sensitivity is due to an attenuation of the alpha-adrenergic receptor mechanism.", 
    "8": "The effect of alprenolol and other beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, including d-isomers, on blood flow in femoral, coronary and mesenteric vascular beds was measured in anesthetized dogs. Under conditions of constant perfusion pressure, intra-arterial injection of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists produced vasodilation. Propranolol and alprenolol were approximately equipotent in coronary and mesenteric beds but alprenolol was significantly more potent in the femoral bed. Practolol was virtually inactive in all beds. The vasodilating potency of d-alprenolol and d-propranolol was not significantly different from that of the respective racemic mixtures. The vasodilator response to alprenolol was not affected by pretreatment with atropine, diphenhydramine or propranolol. In conscious normotensive dogs i.v. injections of d,l- and d-alprenolol produced dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure and increases in heart rate. Under similar conditions, i.v. d,l-propranolol was without effect on either measurement. The results suggest that the hypotensive action of alprenolol in dogs may derive from its vasodilator activity.", 
    "9": "Electrical stimulation of widespread areas in the CNS has been shown to cause cardiac arrhythmias, which occur most frequently after cessation of stimulation. To determine the reflex and autonomic mechanism responsible for the poststimulation arrhythmias, we anesthetized cats with chloralose, and recorded arterial pressure, ECG, and cardiac vagal nerve activity. Stimulation of the hypothalamus consistently caused increases in blood pressure and heart rate during stimulation and caused arrhythmias, accompanied by vagal hyperactivity, immediately following stimulation. The arrhythmias were mediated solely by the vagus nerves because vagotomy or propantheline administration prevented them, whereas propranolol did not. Administration of either phentolamine or spinal cord transection prevented both the rise in blood pressure during stimulation and the poststimulation arrhythmias, but sectioning the carotid sinus and aortic depressor nerves had no preventative effect. However, when this denervation was combined with sectioning of vagal afferents, bursts of vagal activity (used as an index of cardiac rhythm disturbances) were prevented in three of six animals. Subsequent administration of phentolamine prevented the bursts in the remaining animals. It is concluded that poststimulation arrhythmias are elicited by the rise in blood pressure occurring during stimulation causing a sudden surge in parasympathetic outflow to the heart. The reflexogenic areas involved appear to be stretch receptors innervated by afferent vagal fibers.", 
    "10": "The effect of brief periods of regional ischemia upon left ventricular pump performance was studied in nine dogs standing quietly at rest and during running exercise on a treadmill. Transient occlusions of the left circumflex coronary artery resulted in increase in heart rate at rest (+30 beats/min) but not during exercise. Other changes due to occlusion were similar at rest and during exercise and included decreases in stroke volume (-25% standing, -23% running); in dP/dt max, the maximum first derivative of the left ventricular pressure (-20% standing or running); and in left ventricular peak systolic pressure (-13% standing, -21% running); and rises in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (+4.5 mmHg standing, +6.3 mmHg running). Cardiac output was unchanged by occlusions at rest but fell (-18%) during occlusions while the dogs were running. Propranolol reduced absolute levels of cardiac performance during exercise occlusions but had no effect at rest. Inotropic agents with ischemia had some effects at rest but did not alter exercise hemodynamics. It is concluded that integrated left ventricular function during ischemia is not impaired by exercise, probably because of beta-adrenergic stimulation of nonischemic myocardium.", 
    "11": "Insulin secretory responses via adrenergic mechanisms were studied in vivo with hyperthyroid rats prepared by daily injections with thyroxine and with rats rendered hypothyroid by the addition of methylthiouracil in the drinking water. Isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic agent, caused hyperinsulinemia in hyperthyroid rats more markedly than in euthyroid rats, but failed to induce hyperinsulinemia in hypothyroid rats. The isoproterenol-induced hyperinsulinemia was abolished by a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker in hyperthyroid as well as in euthyroid rats. The glucose-induced hyperinsulinemia was enhanced in hyperthyroid, was not essentially affected in euthyroid, and was inhibited in hypothyroid rats, by an alpha- and beta-adrenergic agent such as epinephrine. It is concluded that the relative function of alpha- to beta-adrenergic receptors responsible for the pancreatic secretion of insulin is dependent on the thyroid state; beta-adrenergic actions are predominant over alpha-actions in hyperthyroidism and vice versa in hypothyroidism.", 
    "12": "1 No correlation was found between the rate of gastric emptying and peak plasma propranolol concentrations in six hypertensive patients after single oral doses of 80 mg. 2 In four normal subjects given oral propranolol the peak plasma concentration was highest when a simultaneous injection of metoclopramide and lowest when propantheline was given. The mean time to peak was 1.5 h after metoclopramide, 2.8 h after normal saline and 4.5 h after propantheline. 3 Gastric emptying has some influence on the time of peak plasma propranolol concentrations but individual variation in its bioavailability is determined mainly by first-pass metabolism in the liver.", 
    "13": "Two children developed persistent, incapacitating, upper extremity tremor following severe head injury from bicycle-automobile collision accidents. Both responded well to treatment with the beta blocking agent, propranolol, improving motor control in school and self-care tasks.", 
    "14": "To study the mechanisms by which acute beta-adrenergic blockade may change the activity of the sympathetic nervous system we have measured haemodynamic responses including splanchnic blood flow in twenty-three patients with ischaemic heart disease at rest and during supine exercise before and after i.v. injection of 0.039 mmol (10 mg) dl-propranolol. After propranolol both at rest and on exercise blood pressure, cardiac output and heart rate decreased, while splanchnic vascular resistance increased; mixed venous oxygen saturation decreased whilst arterial oxygen saturation and oxygen uptake were unchanged. Plasma noradrenaline increased after propranolol, values correlating with mixed venous oxygen saturation and splanchnic vascular resistance, both at rest and during exercise before and after propranolol, only at rest was there any correlation with arterial blood pressure. The increase in sympathetic nervous activity after propranolol may be due to a reduction in cardiac output and thereby alteration of the metabolic state (oxygen or related factors) in tissues. Afferent neural signals from the tissues may play a significant role in the regulation of sympathetic nervous activity.", 
    "15": "A controlled trial was instituted to compare the effect on intraocular pressure of topical administration of timolol maleate with epinephrine hydrochloride. A bottling error by the manufacturer resulted in the placebo bottles containing 1.5% timolol maleate. This drug given twice a day for two weeks significantly reduced intraocular pressure and produced no side effects.", 
    "16": "Twenty-seven patients receiving long-term propranolol therapy underwent myocardial revascularization to relieve stable or unstable angina. The patients were randomly divided into two groups, one (Group 1) in which propranolol was discontinued 48 hours prior to operation and one (Group 2) in which patients received a final dose of propranolol 1 to 2 hours prior to operation. Several physiological variables were compared, and there was no statistically significant difference between the groups except for a slower pulse rate in Group 2 patients. Although the patients in Group 1 showed a greater frequency of hypertension before bypass, the incidence of postoperative complications and perioperative myocardial infarction was the same for both groups. The findings of this study indicate that myocardial revascularization is safe even if propranolol is administered up to 1 or 2 hours before operation.", 
    "17": "The effects of quinidine, propranolol and their combination on atrial and ventricular automaticity were studied in pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs with complete heart block produced by injection of 40% formalin. The indices of atrial and ventricular automaticity were the intrinsic rate and the asystole interval, 10-beat period, and beats per 30 seconds after cessation of a 2-minute overdrive. Potentiation was considered to be a response produced by the combination of a half-dose of quinidine plus a half-dose of propranolol significantly greater than that produced by the full dose of either drug. Two combinations were studied: combination I consisted of 1.0 mg/kg of quinidine and 0.04 mg/kg of propranolol while combination II consisted of 2.0 mg/kg of quinidine and 0.08 mg/kg of propranolol. Neither combination potentiated the action of the individual drugs on the ventricle. Both combinations produced a potentiation of the individual drug effects on atrial intrinsic rate, asystole interval, and 10-beat period while only combination II potentiated the individual drug effects on atrial beats per 30 seconds. These studies indicate that the enhanced effect of the quinidine-propranolol combination in conversion of atrial tachyarrhythmias to sinus rhythm may be a function of its potentiation of the ability of the individual drug to depress atrial automaticity.", 
    "18": "1 The effects of selective and non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blockade upon plasma non-esterified fatty acid concentrations in the fasting state and following insulin stress have been studied in normal subjects. 2 Atenolol, propranolol and placebo were compared in a double-blind cross-over trial in eight normal subjects. 3 Atenolol and propranolol significantly lowered plasma non-esterified fatty acid concentrations by a similar degree in the fasting, non-stressed state. This finding suggests that beta1-adrenoceptors are involved in the control of basal lipolysis. 4 Following insulin-induced stress, lower plasma non-esterified fatty acid concentrations were observed with propranolol than with atenolol. This difference may be due to beta2-adrenoceptor involvement in the stress mechanisms controlling lipolysis, or to the differences in the water-lipid solubility properties of these drugs.", 
    "19": "1 The effects of atenolol (50 mg and 100 mg) and oxprenolol (80 mg) on respiratory function were studied in ten patients with angina pectoris or hypertension complicated by chronic airways obstruction. 2 In patients with \"fixed\" airways obstruction, neither atenolol nor exprenolol significantly affected airways resistance. 3 In patients with \"labile\" airways obstruction, atenolol did not produce a significant increase in airways obstruction, whereas oxprenolol did. 4 Following isoprenaline challenge (1500 microgram by inhalation), atenolol permitted full bronchodilatation, whereas oxprenolol almost completely blocked the action of isoprenaline. 5 Partial agonist activity appears to be of less clinical importance than cardioselectivity.", 
    "20": "Experiments were carried out on the isolated rabbit papillary muscle driven at 0.5 Hz in order to further elucidate the mechanism of the positive inotropic effect evoked by dopamine. The dose-response curve for dopamine was not affected by the antagonists pimozide (10(-6) M), yohimbine (10(-5) M) pindolol (3 x 10(-8) M) and phentolamine (10(-6) M) when these agents were given separately. Only the simultaneous administration of yohimbine plus pindolol and phentolamine plus pindolol, respectively, shifted the entire curve to the right. This shift was not further influenced by pimozide. Dopamine (10(-4) M) increased the cyclic AMP content of the papillary muscle by about 50%; this increase was not affected by pimozide, but was markedly elevated by yohimbine and completely depressed by pindolol. From the present results it is concluded, that dopamine produces its positive inotropic effect through stimulation of myocardial alpha-as well as beta-adrenoceptors to about the same degree; stimulation of specific dopaminergic receptors, however, is not involved. The stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors is accompanied by an increase of the cyclic AMP level, while that of alpha-adrenoceptors is not.", 
    "21": "Isolated chicken bronchus (which had been partially contracted to carbachol) relaxes to isoproterenol and epinephrine but contracts weakly to phenylephrine. Propranolol (a beta-adrenoceptor blocker) antagonizes isoproterenol and reverses epinephrine-induced relaxations to feeble contractions. Phenylephrine-induced bronchoconstrictions and constrictions to epinephrine (in the presence of beta-blockade) were blocked by phentolamine. The results of this study showed the predominance of beta-)inhibitory) adrenoceptors and some alpha-(excitatory) adrenoceptors in the bronchus of the adult domestic fowl.", 
    "22": "Direct radioligand binding methods for studying the alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors have been developed over the past several years. These techniques use radioactively labeled adrenergic antagonists and agonists to identify the receptors in appropriate membrane fractions from catecholamine-sensitive tissues. In the case of the beta-adrenergic receptors, confident receptor identification has been aided by the close correlation of binding data with data on adenylate cyclase activation. Such direct binding studies are providing new insights about the molecular characteristics and regulatory properties of the receptors.", 
    "23": "The application of \"real time\" spectrum analysis to left ventricular pressure during transient phenomena is described. Transient phenomena generated by the injection of drugs (norepinephrine-isoproterenol), anoxia and occlusion of aorta and carotids show sudden changes in the frequency of heart contraction. Propranolol stabilizes the heart rate in similar circumstances.", 
    "24": "The antihypertensive effects on metoprolol and pindolol were compared in 50 patients with essential hypertension belonging to WHO stage 1 or 2. After four weeks of placebo treatment the patients were randomly allocated to treatment with metoprolol or pindolol. During the initial dose-titration period of six weeks the dose was individually adjusted, aiming at a diastolic blood pressure in the seated position less than 95 mm Hg. The maximum possible dosage for metoprolol was 50, 100 and 150 mg b.i.d. and for pindolol 5, 10 and 15 mg b.i.d. Thereafter followed a fixed-dose period of 20 weeks. Six patients did not complete the study. At the end of the study satisfactory blood pressure control, defined as a diastolic blood pressure in the seated position less than 95 mm Hg, was achieved in 15 of the 20 patients (75%) in the metroprolol group and in 13 out of 24 patients (54%) in the pindolol group. The average reduction in diastolic blood pressure was more pronounced with metoprolol than with pindolol, while no difference was found between the two beta-blockers with regard to the reduction of the systolic blood pressure. Generally, metoprolol and pindolol were both well tolerated by the patients.", 
    "25": "Friedreich's ataxia is almost always associated with a cardiomyopathy. The cardiomyopathy and its attendant cardiopulmonary sequelae is the usual cause of death in this disease. The author reviews the known pharmacology of the heart, particularly as it applies to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The important role played by calcium and the possible role of taurine is stressed. Therapeutic possibilities are mentioned.", 
    "26": "Intrinsic membrane effects (non-specific effects) and beta-adrenergic blocking action (specific effects) of l-penbutolol were studied using intracellular microelectrode techniques. l-Penbutolol in concentrations above 0.1 mg/L reduced the maximum rate of depolarization at phase O of both Purkinje fibers and ventricular muscle fibers without affecting their maximum diastolic potential. The action potential duration of Purkinje fibers were also shortened. The shortening of action potential duration and enhancement of automaticity in Purkinje fibers, normally induced by isoproterenol (0.2 mg/L), were antagonized by l-penbutolol in much lower concentraions (0.1--1.0 microgram/L) than those at which nonspecific effects are observed. The difference between these two concentration ranges is sufficient to suggest that l-penbutolol might be a highly specific beta-adrenergic blocking agent.", 
    "27": "In a single-blind, randomised, crossover study in 10 asthmatic patients, the effects of approximately equipotent oral doses of 3 cardioselective beta-blockers-atenolol (100 mg), metoprolol (100 mg), and acebutolol (300 mg)-and 4 non-cardioselective beta-blockers-proranolol (100 mg), oxprenolol (100 mg), pindolol (5 mg), and timolol (10 mg) upon FEV1 were compared. All drugs, except pindolol, produced a significant reduction in standing pulse rate and prevented an increase in heart rate after inhaled isoprenaline (1500 microgram). All drugs caused a fall in FEV1 but only atenolol did not differ significantly from placebo in this respect. The bronchodilator response to inhaled isoprenaline was blocked by the 4 non-cardioselective drugs; the 3 cardioselective agents permitted some bronchodilatation, but only atenolol did not differ from placebo.", 
    "28": "A study on the comparative potency of intravenously administered penbutolol, a new non-selective beta adrenoceptor antagonist, on the resting and post-exercise heart rate and rate-pressure product was carried out in 5 normal human subjects. The effects produced by 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 mg of penbutolol and of 0.025 mg/kg (mean dose 1.28 mg) of propranolol was recorded. The dose of penbutolol producing an effect equivalent to that of propranolol was calculating from the log dose-response curve of penbutolol. In these tests, penbutolol was 7.90 and 7.66 times more potent than propranolol on a weight to weight basis. Penbutolol was well tolerated and no side-effects were observed.", 
    "29": "The hemodynamic effects of a new beta-receptor blocking agent, bufuraolo HCl, were compared with those of pindolol. Contrary to pindolol, bufuralol HCl induces a decrease of the peripheral resistance immediately. Under exercise conditions, the peripheral resistance increases under pindolol whereas it remains constant under bufuralol HCl in spite of reduced cardiac output. As an explanation, an effect of bufuralol HCl on peripheral resistance is discussed which might be independent of the beta-receptor blocking effects in the periphery.", 
    "30": "The functional antagonism of carbachol by fenoterol and salbutamol (beta-adrenoceptor agonists) has been used to demonstrate that the efficacy (intrinsic activity) of fenoterol was about twice that of salbutamol on guinea-pig trachea. The mean maximum shifts of the carbachol concentration--response lines by fenoterol and salbutamol were (log units) 1.07 +/- 0.07 (n = 5) and 0.64 +/- 0.07 (n = 5) respectively. This difference in their efficacies could be demonstrated as differences in maximum relaxation on tracheal preparations contracted with carbachol, although this was dependent on the concentration of carbachol used. beta-Adrenoceptor blocking properties of salbutamol (1 mM) but not fenoterol (1 mM) could be demonstrated on trachea in that salbutamol, but not fenoterol, antagonised the shift in the carbachol concentration--response line produced by isoprenaline. The implications of these findings in relation to the use of fenoterol and salbutamol as bronchodilators is discussed.", 
    "31": "Superior cervical ganglia of rats grown in organ culture were used to study the effect of beta-receptor stimulants and antagonists on 3H-noradrenaline release in response to stimulation by KC1 (75 mM). (--)-Isoprenaline 1X 10(-9)--1 X 10(-7) M) increased 20--25% the release of 3H-noradrenaline from cultured ganglia exposed to KC1. Isoprenaline did not modify either the spontaneous (non-calcium dependent) release of 3H-noradrenaline from cultured ganglia, or the KC1-stimulated release from fresh ganglia. The effect of (--)-isoprenaline was blocked by (--)-propranolol 5 X 10(-9) -- 1 X 10(-8) M and by butoxamine 10(-6) M, but not by (+)-propranolol (1 -- 5 X 10(-8) M), practolol (1 X 10(-8) -- 1 X 10(-6) M), or sotalol (1 X 10(-7) -- 1 X 10(-6) M). Isoprenaline induced augmentation of 3H-noradrenaline release and its antagonism by (--)-propranolol still occurred in the presence of DMI. It is suggested that presynaptic beta-receptors in sympathetic nerve terminals may be involved in a positive feedback of noradrenaline release.", 
    "32": "The effects of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injections of adrenaline on the blood pressure and heart rate of spontaneous hypertensive (SH) rats have been investigated. Adrenaline induced dose-related falls in blood pressure and heart rate in both conscious and urethane anaesthetised rats. In conscious rats, the hypotension and metoprolol, but were unaffected by pretreatment with phentolamine, piperoxan, fluphenazine or methysergide. However, in urethane-anaesthetised rats, the hypotension and bradycardia induced by i.c.v. adrenaline was not significantly affected by i.c.v. pretreatment with propranolol or oxprenolol, while metoprolol significantly antagonised only the bradycardia. Piperoxan, fluphenazine and methysergide were also without effect. Pretreatment with mecamylamine (i.p.) abolished the cardiovascular depressor effects of i.c.v. adrenaline in both conscious and urethane anaesthetised SH rats. It is concluded that the cardiovascular depressor effects of i.c.v. adrenaline are mediated by central adrenoceptors in SH rats and that, in conscious rats, these depressor effects may be mediated by central beta-adrenoceptors rather than alpha-adrenoceptors.", 
    "33": "The dissociation constant of binding (KD) of 125I-labelled 3-(4-iodophenoxy)-1-isoproplyaminopropan-2-ol (IIP) to guinea-pig myocardial membrane preparations was 2.2 x 10-8M. In pharmacological experiments with the non-labelled material and 60 min contact time, IIP produced a parallel shift in the orciprenaline concentration-response line on guinea-pig isolated tracheal and atrial preparations. The dissociation constant (KB) of IIP was 2.9 x 10-8M on atria (pA2 7.54) and 3.3 x 10-8M on trachea (pA2 7-48). These values indicate that IIP is not a selective beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug. In addition, agreement was found between the affinity constant of this antagonist for beta-adrenoceptors as determined by a direct binding study and an indirect pharmacological study.", 
    "34": "1 A comparison of six beta-adrenoceptor stimulants has been carried out on in vitro preparations of guinea-pig uterus which were depolarized in K(+)-Krebs solution. Results have also been obtained on uterine preparations in which contractions to acetylcholine were inhibited. The establishment of the conditions for the K(+)-depolarized preparations are described.2 There was no significant difference between potency values (mean neg log EC(50) values) for any of the drugs on the two types of uterine preparation i.e. the preparations had the same sensitivity to the drugs.3 There was a less than two-fold difference between the relative potency values for the beta-adrenoceptor stimulants on the two types of uterine preparation. The relative potency values (isoprenaline = 100) on the K(+)-depolarized preparation were fenoterol 74.1, salbutamol 15.1, rimiterol 13.5, terbutaline 8.2 and orciprenaline 5.6.4 The relative potency values obtained on uterine preparations were less than three-fold different from those previously found for guinea-pig trachea (after inhibition of extraneuronal uptake).5 The pA(2) value for propranolol on the K(+)-depolarized uterine preparations was 9.13.6 It is concluded that the K(+)-depolarized guinea-pig uterine preparation can be used for quantitative studies on beta-adrenoceptor stimulant drugs. It lacks spontaneous activity, drugs can be added cumulatively and several drugs can be compared on a single preparation. In addition, the results obtained support the classification of the beta-adrenoceptors in guinea-pig uterus and trachea in the same sub-group (beta(2)).", 
    "35": "Binding of [(3)H]dihydroergocryptine to platelet lysates appears to have all the characteristics of binding to alpha-adrenergic receptors. At 25 degrees C binding reaches equilibrium within 20 min and is reversible upon addition of excess phentolamine. Binding is saturable with 183+/-22 fmol of [(3)H]dihydroergocryptine bound per mg of protein at saturation, corresponding to 220+/-26 sites per platelet. Kinetic and equilibrium studies indicate the dissociation constant of [(3)H]dihydroergocryptine for the receptors is 1-3 nM. The specificity of the binding sites is typical of an alpha-adrenergic receptor. Catecholamine agonists compete for occupancy of the [(3)H]dihydroergocryptine binding sites with an order of potency (-)epinephrine> (-)norepinephrine> (-)isoproterenol. Stereospecificity was demonstrated inasmuch as the (+)isomers of epinephrine and norepinephrine were 10-20-fold less potent than the (-)isomers. The potent alpha-adrenergic antagonists phentolamine, phenoxybenzamine, and yohimbine competed potently for the sites, whereas beta-antagonists such as propranolol and dichlorisoproterenol were quite weak. Dopamine and serotonin competed only at high concentrations (0.1 mM). The [(3)H]dihydroergocryptine binding sites could also be demonstrated in intact platelets where they displayed comparable specificity, stereospecificity, and saturability. Saturation binding studies with the intact platelets indicated 220+/-45 receptors per platelet, in good agreement with the value derived from studies with platelet lysates. Ability of alpha-adrenergic agonists to inhibit adenylate cyclase and of alpha-adrenergic antagonists to antagonize this inhibitory effect directly paralleled ability to interact with the [(3)H]dihydroergocryptine binding sites. These data demonstrate the feasibility of directly studying alpha-adrenergic receptor binding sites in human platelets with [(3)H]dihydroergocryptine.", 
    "36": "1 The effects of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists given in single doses by oral or intravenous routes were examined in two double-blind controlled studies performed in healthy volunteers. Heart rate and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) were measured at rest and during standardized exercise. 2 Propranolol 80 mg and metoprolol 100 mg orally tended to reduce, and propranolol and metoprolol 0.2 mg/kg intravenously did reduce the physiological increase in PEFR during exercise; oxprenolol 80 mg orally and 0.2 mg/kg intravenously did not. Practolol 200 mg orally reduced this increase, but practolol 1 mg/kg intravenously did not. 3 In a third study of similar design, pindolol 0.05 mg/kg intravenously did not affect exercise-induced increase in PEFR. 4 Heart rate during exercise was reduced to a comparable extent at different times by all the active treatments. 5 Oxprenolol and pindolol share with practolol the property of partial agonist activity, which might contribute to their apparent lack of effect on airways resistance. A further possibility is that alpha-adrenoceptor blockade helps to maintain exercise-induced increase in PEFR.", 
    "37": "The hypotensive action of labetalol, a new drug with alpha-adrenoceptor and beta-adrenoceptor blocking action, was compared with that of a combination of prindolol and hydrallazine. Fourteen patients with mild to moderately severe hypertension completed a double-blind cross-over study with treatment periods of eight weeks. Both treatments were effective and, in the doses which were used, produced clinically significant lowering of blood pressure (reduction of mean blood pressure by more than 10 mm Hg) both in clinic and in home blood pressures in 12 of the 14 patients. The action of labetalol (600 mg twice a day) was approximately equivalent to that of prindolol (15 mg twice a day) plus hydrallazine (50 mg three times a day). There was a tendency for the second treatment (irrespective of nature) to be more effective than the first. However, when the results for each treatment were combined, the fall in the blood pressure due to labetalol was practically identical with that due to prindolol and hydrallazine. There were no toxic effects from either treatment and side effects were mild. Labetalol is a useful hypotensive drug with effect similar to that of a combination of a beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug and a vasodilator.", 
    "38": "Dispersed pinealocytes have been used to study the role of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) in the \"turnoff\" of N-acetyltransferace activity. Activity was first stimulated 100-fold by treating cells with 1-norepinephrine. 1-Propranolol acted stereospecifically to rapidly reverse this, resulting in a 70 percent loss of enzyme activity within 15 minutes. An even more rapid 1-propranolol-induced decreased in cyclic AMP also occurred. This together with the observation that the inhibitory effect of 1-propranolol on N-acetyltransferase was blocked by dibutyryl cyclic AMP and phosphodiesterase inhibitors indicate that an abrupt decrease in cyclic AMP may be the signal for the rapid decrease in pineal N-acetyltransferase activity.", 
    "39": "Radioimmunoassays and immunocytochemical techniques were used to assess the effect of cyclocytidine, an antitumor agent, on the level and localization of Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) in the submandibular gland of the male mouse. A single intraperitoneal injection of 150 mg/kg of cyclocytidine caused, within 6 h, a degranulation of the granular convoluted tubules (GCT) cells and reduced the concentration of immunoreactive EGF in gland extracts by more than 90%. This effect was largely abolished by the administration of dibenzyline but not by propranolol, indicating that the secretory effect of the drug on the GCT cells is mediated by alpha-adrenergic receptors. By immunocytochemical staining revealed the same trends in changes in EGF concentration as the radioimmunoassays. However, even at the peak of the cyclocytidine effect there were cells which retained their secretory granules and apparently their EGF complement. In addition, there was a lobular variation in the secretory response. Cyclocytidine caused a transiet increase in the blood level of EGF. Furthermore, it stimulated amylase secretion from the gland, which also involved alpha-adrenergic receptors. Cyclocytidine will be useful in future analyses of the release of various biologically active substances from the GCT cells of the mouse submandibular gland.", 
    "40": "The comparative dromotropic activity of timolol (TML) and propranolol (PPL) was studied by means of His bundle electrograms in two groups of pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs: group I, 7 non-atropinized dogs; group II, 8 atropinized dogs. beta-Blocking agents were injected in 4 cumulative doses in each dog at 3 days' interval. The effects upon heart rate (HR), and A-V nodal (AH), His--Purkinje (HV) and intraventricular (QS) conduction times were measured. The dromotropic effects of PPL and TML during atrial electrical stimulation and their effects upon chronotropic and dromotropic isoprenaline-induced changes were compared. TML exerted a 9--10 times more potent negative chronotropic effect than PPL and a 4--5 times more potent negative dromotropic effect than PPL on AH conduction time. PPL and TML increased the duration of HV only in higher doses. This effect which was not modified by isoprenaline may be related to their membrane depressant effect. Neither TML, nor PPL nor isoprenaline modified QS duration. TML was 25 times more potent than PPL to antagonize the chronotropic action of isoprenaline and 11--8 times more potent than PPL to antagonize the dromotropic action of isoprenaline upon AH. Parasympathic blockade with atropine did not modify the negative dromotropic activity of PPL and TML but modified their chronotropic effects.", 
    "41": "The beta1- and beta2-components in antidiuresis and sodium retention induced by beta-adrenergic agonists were analysed in ethanol-anesthetized, water-diuretic rats. Intravenous infusions of isoprenaline, salbutamol and carbuterol did not affect insulin clearance but increased plasma renin concentration to the same same extent. Propranolol completely blocked the decreases in urine volume (V) and urinary sodium excretion (UNaV) induced by isoprenaline; practolol (beta1-blocker) inhibited only the decrease in UNaV and butaxamine (beta2-blocker) inhibited only the decrease in V. The ratios of doses of beta-agonists which decreased UNaV and by 50% (ED50 UNaV decrease/ED50 V decrease) were 0.34, 0.68, 1.56 and 2.36 for isoprenaline, tretoquinol, salbutamol and carbuterol, respectively. This increasing order of the ratios coincided with the order reported for the preponderance of the beta2- over beta1-component of these agonists. These results indicate that the decrease in UNaV induced by beta-agonists is related to beta1 stimulation, while the decrease in V is related to beta2 stimulation.", 
    "42": "The duration of action of a single dose of prazosin and hydrallazine on blood pressure and heart rate was studied in 16 hypertensive patients whose blood pressure was not adequately controlled by a combination of a thiazide diuretic and a beta-adrenergic blocking agent, and had required the addition of either prazosin or hydrallazine. Observations over an eight-hour period, after a single dose of either 3 mg of prazosin, or 75 mg of hydrallazine, in identical capsules, with cross-over study one week later, showed significant reductions in blood pressure within the first hour after oral administration of either agent. This reduction in blood pressure persisted for four to six hours after hydrallazine and six to seven hours after prazosin administration. Tachycardia was more pronounced and prolonged after hydrallazine administration and side effects were more common.", 
    "43": "Suicidal attempt using beta-blockers are rare. Overdose by the ingestion of a large number of tablets rarely exceeds the high therapeutic doses suggested for the treatment of certain resistant cases of hypertension. The case described is that of a 65-year-old patient who took 800 mg of propanolol. Observation of plama levels showed that the half-life propanolol in the case of overdose is prolonged: 8.6 hours in this case, with a maximum plasma level of 1536 ng/ml. Plasma renin activity levels were low during the phase of intoxication and showed evidence of a rebound effect at its end. Treatment is above all that of the circulatory insufficiency produced: isopropylnoradrenaline or glucagon. Indications for extra-renal dialysis should take into account knowledge concerning the pharmacokinetics of these drugs and their prolonged physiological action.", 
    "44": "Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) were found in 54 (7.0%) out of 767 treated hypertensive patients compared with 59 (2.4%) out of 2470 healthy controls. Inclusion of a non-practolol beta-blocker in the treatment regimen did not significantly affect the incidence of ANA. ANA was found in significantly more patients being treated with methyldopa (13.0%) than patients receiving other hypotensive agents (3.8%). Non-practolol beta-blockers in combination with methyldopa did not increase the incidence of ANA further.", 
    "45": "An automatic system was developed to monitor continuously the colonic temperature of laboratory animals during inhalation exposure to toxic chemicals. It includes: an automatic switchbox, a control circuit, a recorder and a digital voltmeter. The system was calibrated for different temperature ranges and used for a year to assess the effects of household solvents on temperature of Sprague-Dawley rats. Reliable monitoring of temperature in 16 rats was carried out in a sequential manner in the manual mode or in the automatic mode for several consecutive days. Very slight changes (.01 - .02 degrees C) in temperature can be measured with this system.", 
    "46": "Plasma noradrenaline and plasma renin activity were measured as indices of sympathetic activity and renin angiotensin system in similar groups of hypertensive patients receiving either propranolol, bendrofluazide or methyldopa. Plasma renin activity was similar in the propranolol and methyldopa groups and significantly lower (p less than 0.01) in both these groups than the diuretic treated subjects. Plasma noradrenaline was significantly lower (p less than 0.01) on methyldopa than either propranolol or bendrofluazide. These different effects on the renin angiotensin system and the sympathetic nervous system of these drugs may be relevant in the choice of long term therapy in hypertension."
