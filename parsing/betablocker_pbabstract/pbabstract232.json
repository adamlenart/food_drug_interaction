    "4": "The aim of the study was to determine the effects on the transport of propranolol across monolayers of the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line, Caco-2, of forming a prodrug by conjugating to generation 3 (G3) and lauroyl-G3 PAMAM dendrimers. Propranolol is a poorly soluble drug and known substrate of the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux transporter. Propranolol-G3 dendrimer conjugates were synthesised by surface attachment of two, four or six propranolol molecules. The apical (A) to basolateral (B) apparent permeability coefficient, P(app), of propranolol was increased and its B-->A P(app) decreased following conjugation to G3 dendrimers. Conjugation of propranolol to lauroyl-G3 dendrimers further increased its A-->B P(app). Our findings show that the A-->B P(app) of propranolol conjugates was reduced in the presence of the endocytosis inhibitor colchicine and was lower at 4 degrees C than at 37 degrees C, suggesting that the enhancement mechanism involves endocytosis-mediated transepithelial transport. The A-->B P(app) of conjugated propranolol was not altered in the presence of the P-gp inhibitor cyclosporin A suggesting that conjugation of drug to dendrimer allows the bypassing of the efflux transporter. The results suggest that dendrimer-drug prodrugs may be used to increase drug solubility and bypass drug efflux transporters, therefore increasing drug bioavailability.", 
    "5": "Heart failure is a leading cause of hospital admissions in North America. Approximately half of patients with symptoms of heart failure have normal or minimally impaired systolic function and are therefore diagnosed, by exclusion, with diastolic dysfunction. The therapy of diastolic dysfunction to date is largely unsatisfactory. There have been few outcome-based clinical trials to guide clinicians, and most treatments have been empirically derived from the data from systolic heart failure studies. In general, acute management consists of central volume reduction with loop diuretics and long-acting nitrates. In some cases improvement in left ventricular filling can be achieved by reducing heart rate, usually with either beta blockers or calcium channel blockers. The role of digoxin is unclear and it should be used with caution. Theoretically, it has the capacity to further impair ventricular function, but one of the few trials in diastolic heart failure suggested that it improves symptoms and reduces hospitalization. Renin-angiotensin system blockade is a very attractive therapeutic avenue; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers effectively reduce afterload, induce regression of left ventricular hypertrophy in excess of their blood pressure-lowering effect, and confer survival benefits to patients at high risk for cardiovascular death. Although the results of a recent trial using an angiotensin receptor blocker in patients with primarily diastolic heart failure were unimpressive, renin-angiotensin system blockade should still be considered because of its aforementioned benefits. The long-term management of these patients includes a careful assessment for and treatment of myocardial ischemia, treatment of hypertension, and reduction in left ventricular hypertrophy. For the treatment of ischemia, long-acting nitrates and calcium channel blockers may be particularly useful. The results of new trials in this area are expected soon, and hopefully therapy that directly targets the pathophysiologic pathways of this important disease is on the horizon.", 
    "6": "Plasmon-waveguide resonance (PWR) spectroscopy is an optical technique that can be used to probe the molecular interactions occurring within anisotropic proteolipid membranes in real time without requiring molecular labeling. This method directly monitors mass density, conformation, and molecular orientation changes occurring in such systems and allows determination of protein-ligand binding constants and binding kinetics. In the present study, PWR has been used to monitor the incorporation of the human beta(2)-adrenergic receptor into a solid-supported egg phosphatidylcholine lipid bilayer and to follow the binding of full agonists (isoproterenol, epinephrine), a partial agonist (dobutamine), an antagonist (alprenolol), and an inverse agonist (ICI-118,551) to the receptor. The combination of differences in binding kinetics and the PWR spectral changes point to the occurrence of multiple conformations that are characteristic of the type of ligand, reflecting differences in the receptor structural states produced by the binding process. These results provide new evidence for the conformational heterogeneity of the liganded states formed by the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor.",

Above 640-fold dilution, the inhibition rate of all drugs became 50% or less and there was no significant difference between drugs. Vehicles also inhibited cell growth. The dilution rates for growth inhibition by vehicles were different from those of drugs. The dilution rate at 50% inhibition of anti-glaucoma eyedrops decreased in the following order: Rescula > Xalatan > Betoptic > Hypadil > Mikelan > Timoptol > Trusopt.

Clenbuterol minimized LPS-induced liver damage, as represented by significantly lowered concentrations of several parameters for liver-failure (AST, ALT, Bilirubin), and improved hepatic tissue morphology. Clenbuterol administration after LPS challenge failed to inhibit TNF alpha-release but reduced liver-damage.

Managed care plans identified adult patients with 1 inpatient or 3 outpatient claims for HF during 2000. A stratified random sample of 971 Medicare and 642 Medicaid patients' outpatient medical records from 5 plans were reviewed by trained nurse abstractors to obtain data regarding type of HF, demographics, comorbidities, and therapies. Left ventricular function assessment was performed in 88% of patients.

    "32": "Heart failure affects nearly 5 million Americans and is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. It is now recognized that activation of multiple neurohormonal systems is intrinsic in the pathophysiology of heart failure. Patients with diabetes mellitus are at high risk for heart failure, and some of the complications of diabetes (e.g., insulin resistance) contribute to the development and progression of heart failure, partly because of their effects on neurohormonal systems. Pharmacologic intervention directed toward these systems (i.e., angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibition, use of aldosterone antagonists, and beta-adrenergic blockade) has been shown to decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with heart failure. Despite this knowledge, ACE inhibitors, aldosterone antagonists, and beta-blockers are grossly underused, and deaths and hospitalizations due to heart failure have steadily increased. Guidelines for the management of heart failure recommend the use of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers in patients with mild, moderate, or severe disease. Aldosterone antagonists are recommended in severe heart failure, and recent data also support their use in mild to moderate heart failure. Concerns about the increased incidence of hypoglycemia, worsening dyslipidemia, and decreased insulin sensitivity with beta-blocker use may be preventing physicians from prescribing these agents for patients with diabetes with heart failure. Although evidence from earlier clinical trials justifies some of these concerns, newer vasodilating beta-blockers (e.g., carvedilol) have been shown to have a neutral or positive effect on dyslipidemia and insulin resistance. beta-Blockade in conjunction with ACE inhibition should be standard therapy for all patients with diabetes who have heart failure. Furthermore, early in-hospital initiation of neurohormonal intervention can provide earlier benefit to these patients.",

The concentration of timolol in rabbit aqueous humor was determined after instillation of timolol ophthalmic solution containing sorbic acid. When the molar ratio of sorbic acid to timolol was two or higher, the concentration of timolol in the aqueous humor was higher than with timolol alone. In the presence of sorbic acid the maximal aqueous humor concentration and the area under the curve were more than two-fold higher than those of Timoptol, a timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, and similar in value to TIMOPTIC-XE, a gel-forming ophthalmic solution. To investigate the transcorneal absorption mechanism, in vitro permeation profiles across the intact and de-epithelialyzed cornea were analyzed on the basis of the bilayer diffusion model. The partition coefficient in the epithelium was about twice as high in the presence of sorbic acid than with timolol alone, although the diffusion coefficient in the epithelium did not change. We conclude that the improved ocular bioavailability in the presence of sorbic acid is due to increased partitioning of timolol in the corneal epithelium.",

A programmed wavelength fluorescence detection method was used to optimise the response of the marker compounds. This marker compound mixture and the corresponding HPLC assay can be used for in house validation of the Caco-2 system or to evaluate simultaneously the effect of test compounds or absorption enhancing strategies on monolayer integrity and P-gp functionality.

    "57": "Complex sympathovagal interactions govern heart rate (HR). Activation of the postjunctional beta-adrenergic receptors on the sinus nodal cells augments the HR response to vagal stimulation, whereas exogenous activation of the presynaptic alpha-adrenergic receptors on the vagal nerve terminals attenuates vagal control of HR. Whether the alpha-adrenergic mechanism associated with cardiac postganglionic sympathetic nerve activation plays a significant role in modulation of the dynamic vagal control of HR remains unknown. The right vagal nerve was stimulated in seven anesthetized rabbits that had undergone sinoaortic denervation and vagotomy according to a binary white-noise signal (0-10 Hz) for 10 min; subsequently, the transfer function from vagal stimulation to HR was estimated. The effects of beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol (1 mg/kg i.v.) and the combined effects of beta-adrenergic blockade and tonic cardiac sympathetic nerve stimulation at 5 Hz were examined. The transfer function from vagal stimulation to HR approximated a first-order, low-pass filter with pure delay. beta-Adrenergic blockade decreased the dynamic gain from 6.0 +/- 0.4 to 3.7 +/- 0.6 beats x min(-1) x Hz(-1) (P < 0.01) with no alteration of the corner frequency or pure delay. Under beta-adrenergic blockade conditions, tonic sympathetic stimulation did not further change the dynamic gain (3.8 +/- 0.5 beats x min(-1) x Hz(-1)). In conclusion, cardiac postganglionic sympathetic nerve stimulation did not affect the dynamic HR response to vagal stimulation via the alpha-adrenergic mechanism.", 
    "58": "The aim of the present study was to evaluate specifically left ventricular (LV) function in rat hearts as they transition from the normal to hypertrophic state and back to normal. Either isoproterenol (1.2 and 2.4 mg.kg(-1).day(-1) for 3 days; Iso group) or vehicle (saline 24 microl.day(-1) for 3 days; Sa group) was infused by subcutaneous implantation of an osmotic minipump. After verifying the development of cardiac hypertrophy, we recorded continuous LV pressure-volume (P-V) loops of in situ ejecting hypertrophied rat hearts. The curved LV end-systolic P-V relation (ESPVR) and systolic P-V area (PVA) were obtained from a series of LV P-V loops in the Sa and Iso groups 1 h or 2 days after the removal of the osmotic minipump. PVA at midrange LV volume (PVA(mLVV)) was taken as a good index for LV work capability (13, 15, 20, 21). However, in rat hearts during remodeling, whether PVA(mLVV) is a good index for LV work capability has not been determined yet. In the present study, in contrast to unchanged end-systolic pressure at midrange LV volume, PVA(mLVV) was significantly decreased by isoproterenol treatment relative to saline; however, these measurements were the same 2 days after pump removal. Simultaneous treatment with a beta(1)-blocker, metoprolol (24 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)), blocked the formation of cardiac hypertrophy and thus PVA(mLVV) did not decrease. The reversible changes in PVA(mLVV) reflect precisely the changes in LV work capability in isoproterenol-induced hypertrophied rat hearts mediated by beta(1)-receptors. These results indicate that the present approach may be an appropriate strategy for evaluating the effects of antihypertrophic and antifibrotic modalities.",

In a 12-month extension of two identically designed 1-year, multicenter, randomized, double-masked clinical trials, patients were treated topically with bimatoprost 0.03% QD (n=167), bimatoprost 0.03% BID (n=131), or timolol 0.5% BID (n=81). Main outcome measures were IOP at 8 am and 10 am and safety parameters. Bimatoprost QD provided significantly greater mean reduction from baseline IOP than did timolol at both measurements at each study visit (P< or =.001). At 10 am (peak timolol effect) at month 24, the mean reduction from baseline IOP was 7.8 mm Hg with bimatoprost QD and 4.6 mm Hg with timolol (P<.001). Patients treated with bimatoprost QD also sustained significantly lower mean IOP than timolol-treated patients at every follow-up visit throughout the 2-year study period (P< or =.006). At 10 am at month 24, a significantly greater proportion of bimatoprost QD than timolol patients achieved target pressures of < or =13-18 mm Hg (P< or =.010). Bimatoprost sustained an excellent safety profile during the second year of treatment. Most adverse events were mild, and there were no reports of increased iris pigmentation, uveitis, or CME. The incidence of hyperemia was significantly higher with bimatoprost QD (13.8%) than with timolol (2.5%) (P=.006). Mean reduction from baseline IOP with bimatoprost BID was not significantly different from that with timolol at month 24 at 10 am (P=.474).

In the overall analysis of IOP measured over the course of 24 hours, mean IOP was significantly lower with bimatoprost or latanoprost than with timolol gel (P<.001; analysis of repeated measures). The analysis of repeated measures also showed a significant difference between bimatoprost and latanoprost (P=.003). In the area-under-the-curve analysis, bimatoprost and latanoprost were superior to timolol gel (P< or =.018) but comparable to each other (P> or =.223). All treatment regimens were well tolerated, with few discontinuations due to adverse events. There were no significant effects on systemic safety parameters.",

    "67": "We have analysed the action of the neuromodulatory catecholamine, dopamine (DA), on the lumbar locomotor network using an isolated in vitro newborn rat spinal cord preparation. We have also attempted to determine the respective contribution of the D1- and D2-like receptors on the dopamine-mediated effects. Bath application of DA-induced slow locomotor-like rhythmic activity (cycle-period 20-30 s) in ventral motor roots. Bursts were alternating between segmental right and left side and between ipsilateral flexor and extensor units. This rhythm was blocked by D1 (SCH-23390) and D2 (raclopride, sulpiride) receptor antagonists, but was unaffected by the dopamine-beta-hydroxylase blocker, fusaric acid, thereby ruling out indirect noradrenaline-mediated effects. The D1 agonist, SKF-81297 induced prolonged slow rhythmic bursting, while the selective D2 agonists, quinpirole and quinelorane, had no effect. DA and the D1 agonist, SKF-81297 also increased the period and burst amplitude of N-methyl-d-l-aspartate-induced locomotor activity. The effects of dopamine and SKF-81297 on the N-methyl-d-l-aspartate-induced rhythm were long-lasting; persisting for 1 hour after washout. The DA action was blocked by MDL-12 330 A, an inhibitor of adenylate cyclase, suggesting the involvement of cAMP. Together these results indicate that dopamine can exert neuromodulatory actions on mammalian motor networks via short-lasting permissive influences and a newly reported, long-lasting modulation of motor network activity.", 
    "68": "Several subtypes of glutamate transporters are abundantly expressed near the excitatory synapses on cerebellar Purkinje cells. We investigated the roles of the glutamate transporters in shaping the excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) and regulating the levels of extracellular glutamate in the mouse cerebellum using a potent blocker of glutamate transporters, dl-threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartate (dl-TBOA). This drug markedly prolonged AMPA receptor-mediated EPSCs in Purkinje cells evoked by stimulating both parallel fibres and climbing fibres. The decay phase of the prolonged EPSCs was fitted by double exponentials, of which the slower component was preferentially inhibited by a low-affinity competitive antagonist of AMPA receptors, gamma-d-glutamyl-glycine, indicating that the slow component induced by dl-TBOA was the AMPA receptor-mediated current activated by lower concentrations of glutamate than those contributing to the peak of the EPSC. This result suggests that dl-TBOA prolongs the stay of synaptically released glutamate in the synaptic cleft and also induces glutamate spillover to extrasynaptic targets as well as neighbouring synapses. Furthermore, high concentrations of dl-TBOA in the presence of cyclothiazide generated a continuous inward current in Purkinje cells, of which the amplitude reached the peak level of the climbing-fibre EPSC. This continuous inward current was abolished by the blocker of AMPA receptors, indicating that the strong inhibition of glutamate uptake causes the rapid accumulation of glutamate in the extracellular space. These results highlight the importance of glutamate transporters in maintaining the proper glutamatergic transmission in Purkinje cell synapses.", 
    "69": "The neurotransmitter acetylcholine, a muscarinic receptor agonist, augments glucose-induced insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells by depolarizing the membrane to enhance voltage-gated Ca(2+) influx. To clarify the electrical events involved in this process, we measured ionic currents from a clonal beta-cell line (HIT-T15) and mouse pancreatic beta-cells. In whole-cell recordings, the muscarinic agonist carbachol (CCh) dose-dependently and reversibly activated a voltage-independent, nonselective current (whole-cell conductance 24 pS/pF, reversal potential of approximately -15 mV). The current, which we refer to as I(musc), was blocked by atropine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist, and SKF 96365, a nonspecific ion channel blocker. The magnitude of the current decreased by 52% when extracellular Na(+) was removed, but was not affected by changes in extracellular Ca(2+), confirming that I(musc) is a nonselective current. To determine if I(musc) activates following release of Ca(2+) from an intracellular store, we blocked intracellular IP(3) receptors with heparin. Carbachol still activated a current in the presence of heparin, demonstrating the presence of a Ca(2+) store-independent, muscarinic agonist-activated ionic current in HIT cells. However, the store-independent current was smaller and had a more positive reversal potential (approximately 0 mV) than the current activated by CCh under control conditions. This result indicates that heparin had blocked a component of I(musc), which likely activates following release of stored Ca(2+). Depleting IP(3)-sensitive calcium stores with thapsigargin also activated a non-selective, SKF 96365-blockable current in HIT cells. The properties of this putative store-operated current were similar to the component of I(musc) that was blocked by heparin, being voltage-independent and reversing near -30 mV. We conclude that I(musc) consists of store-operated and store-independent components, both of which may contribute to the depolarizing action of muscarinic agonists on pancreatic beta-cells.", 
    "70": "In WEHI-231, a representative immature B cell line, Ca(2+) entry is paradoxically augmented by treatment with 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), a blocker of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor and of nonselective cation channels (Nam, J. H., Yun, S. S., Kim, T. J., Uhm, D.-Y., and Kim, S. J. (2003) FEBS Lett. 535, 113-118). The initial goal of the present study was to elucidate the effects of 2-APB on membrane currents, which revealed the presence of novel K(+) channels in WEHI-231 cells. Under whole-cell patch clamp conditions, 2-APB induced background K(+) current (I(K,bg)) and hyperpolarization in WEHI-231 cells. Lowering of intracellular MgATP also induced the I(K,bg). The I(K,bg) was blocked by micromolar concentrations of quinidine but not by tetraethylammonium. In a single channel study, two types of voltage-independent K(+) channels were found with large (346 picosiemens) and medium conductance (112 picosiemens), named BK(bg) and MK(bg), respectively. The excision of membrane patches (inside-out (i-o) patches) greatly increased the P(o) of BK(bg). In i-o patches, cytoplasmic MgATP (IC(50) = 0.18 mm) decreased the BK(bg) activity, although non-hydrolyzable adenosine 5'-(beta,gamma-imino)triphosphate had no effect. A pretreatment with Al(3+) or wortmannin (50 microm) blocked the inhibitory effects of MgATP. A direct application of phosphoinositide 4,5-bisphosphate (10 microm) inhibited the BK(bg) activity. Meanwhile, the activity of MK(bg) was unaffected by MgATP. In cell-attached conditions, the BK(bg) activity was largely increased by 2-APB. In i-o patches, however, the MgATP-induced inhibition of BK(bg) was weakly reversed by the addition of 2-APB. In summary, WEHI-231 cells express the unique background K(+) channels. The BK(bg)s are inhibited by membrane-delimited elevation of phosphoinositide 4,5-bisphosphate. The activation of BK(bg) would hyperpolarize the membrane, which augments the calcium influx in WEHI-231 cells.",

Their performances were compared by means of ANOVA tests, which evidenced that 0 D-PCR, 0D-PLS-1, 1D-PCR, 1D-PLS-1, were reproducible and gave statistically similar results, while 0 D-CLS and 1D-CLS displayed higher variances than the former and failed to comply with the Levene's variance homogeneity test at different stages of the method comparison and validation process.

    "92": "Sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis (SEP) is a rare yet serious complication in patients with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Incidence and prevalence of this syndrome have been defined in some large populations and a few single-centre experiences, but there is no satisfactory estimate of the comparative incidence of dialysis related SEP. The pathogenesis of SEP still remains uncertain, but there could be various causative factors. The diagnosis of SEP remains based on clinical suspicion confirmed with radiologic and/or pathologic findings. The possible variable etiologies and probable distinct pathways leading to this syndrome may make a uniform therapeutic approach unlikely. To determine the prevalence, etiologic factors, clinical features, effect of dialysis duration, and outcome of SEP in Korea, patients undergoing CAPD who developed SEP were retrospectively studied in five University Hospital dialysis centres with large numbers of CAPD patients in Korea. Out of a total 3888 CAPD studied patients between January 1981 to December 2002 in those five medical centres, 31 cases developed SEP with the overall prevalence 0.8%. There were 15 men and 16 women. The mean age of these patients was 44.0 +/- 9.8 years old. The mean duration of CAPD before SEP was 70.3 +/- 41.9 months (range 9-144 months) and 67.8% of patients (21/31) had been on CAPD more than 4 years. Peritonitis, including one fungal peritonitis, was the main cause of SEP in 25 cases (80.6%). Seventy percent of these cases used beta-blocker and the mean duration of the usage was 61.7 +/- 47.6 months. Seven cases were surgically treated and others were treated conservatively with intermittent total parenteral nutrition. The mortality rate was 25.8%. In conclusion, SEP is a serious life threatening complication of CAPD, and most cases had long-term peritoneal dialysis (PD) duration more than 4 years. To reduce the incidence of SEP, careful monitoring may be needed especially in patients with long-term CAPD and peritonitis.",

    "105": "External osmolarity reduction (20%) led to labelled glutamate, GABA and taurine release from rat brain cortical synaptosomes. A Cl--independent, Na+-dependent, La3+-sensitive and tetrodotoxin (TTX) reduced depolarization of synaptosomes occurred upon hyposmolarity, suggestive of Na+ entry through nonselective cation channels. This depolarization, together with cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]I) increase, resulted in exocytosis, monitored by FM1-43. The release fraction resulting from these phenomena was estimated, by its decrease, by La3+, EGTA-AM and tetanus toxin (TeTX), as 34-44% for glutamate, 21-29% for GABA and 18-22% for taurine. Protein kinase C (PKC) activation by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) increased the hyposmolarity-elicited exocytosis and this activation increased glutamate (80%), GABA (51%) and taurine (42%) hyposmotic efflux. Inhibition by chelerythrine reduced glutamate, GABA and taurine efflux by 64%, 50% and 24%, respectively. The Na+-dependence of amino acid release (glutamate 63%, GABA 46% and taurine 29%) may result from both, prevention of the depolarization-exocytosis efflux, and blockade of the carrier reversal operation. Carrier blockade by dl-threo-beta-benzyloxy aspartate (TBOA) and NO-711 resulted in 37% and 28% reduction of glutamate and GABA release, respectively. Contribution of the osmolyte leak pathway to amino acid release, estimated by the influence of Cl- (NPPB) and tyrosine kinase (AG18) blocker, was up to 55% for taurine, but only 10-18% for GABA, with apparently no contribution for glutamate. The predominant osmolyte-type mechanism of taurine release suggest its function in volume control in nerve endings, while glutamate and GABA respond to events concurrent with hyposmolarity by a neurotransmitter-like release mechanism. The hyposmolarity-induced amino acid efflux from nerve endings may have consequences for neuronal excitability during hyponatremia.",

More vigorous control of hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension is likely to be of crucial importance for risk reduction. Although the effect of intensive glycemic control appears to be only minor in terms of prevention of cardiac events in diabetic patients, it has a major beneficial impact during acute myocardial infarction and after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Lipid-lowering treatment is as effective in diabetic patients with coronary artery disease as in nondiabetic patients. In patients with coronary artery disease, there is strong evidence in favor of the use of b-blockers soon after myocardial infarction as well as in the long term. The metabolic treatment may also be considered as a rational approach for patients with stable angina. The long-term angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor trials in patients with left ventricle dysfunction soon after myocardial infarction demonstrated a substantial benefit in the subgroup of diabetic patients. Current evidence leads us to recommend revascularization surgery as the first choice in diabetic patients. The management of risk factors should be more intensive in diabetic patients.

Thirty-six adult mongrel dogs were chronically instrumented and assigned to receive either a high-fat diet alone (n=7) or a high-fat diet combined with a low-sodium diet plus furosemide (n=6), prazosin plus atenolol (n=7), clonidine (n=10), or aspirin (n=6). Blood pressure, heart rate, and body weight were measured daily. Insulin resistance was assessed with a single-dose euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp (2 mU x kg(-1) x min(-1)) before and after 1, 3, and 6 weeks of the high-fat diet. The low-salt diet plus furosemide, prazosin plus atenolol, and clonidine treatments prevented the hypertension associated with feeding the dogs a high-fat diet. Only clonidine treatment totally prevented the development of insulin resistance, and high-dose aspirin, known to prevent insulin resistance by inhibition of the activity of IkappaB kinase-beta, decreased the degree of insulin resistance by almost 70%. However, aspirin had no effect on the development of hypertension. We conclude that obesity-induced hypertension and obesity-induced insulin resistance are not directly related. In addition, there is a suggestion that insulin resistance in this experimental model is mediated through the central and or peripheral alpha2-adrenoceptors, whereas hypertension is mediated through the alpha1- and or beta-adrenoceptors.",

    "115": "Modeling techniques were used to determine the relationships among survival, baseline clinical variables, and time-dependent variables. The following baseline variables were significantly associated with an increased risk of death: increasing age, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes, stroke or transient ischemic attack, smoking, left ventricular dysfunction, and mitral regurgitation. Among the time-dependent variables, the presence of sinus rhythm (SR) was associated with a lower risk of death, as was warfarin use. Antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) were associated with increased mortality only after adjustment for the presence of SR. Consistent with the original intention-to-treat analysis, AADs were no longer associated with mortality when SR was removed from the model.",

SR is either an important determinant of survival or a marker for other factors associated with survival that were not recorded, determined, or included in the survival model. Currently available AADs are not associated with improved survival, which suggests that any beneficial antiarrhythmic effects of AADs are offset by their adverse effects. If an effective method for maintaining SR with fewer adverse effects were available, it might be beneficial.",

This study characterises some of the mechanisms and mediators involved in the orofacial nociception triggered by injection of formalin into the upper lip of the rat, by assessing the influence of various treatments on behavioural nociceptive responses (duration of facial rubbing) elicited either by a low subthreshold (i.e. non-nociceptive; 0.63%) or a higher concentration of the algogen (2.5%). 2. The kininase II inhibitor captopril (5 mg kg(-1), s.c.) and prostaglandin(PG) E(2) (100 ng lip(-1)) potentiated both phases of the response to 0.63% formalin, whereas tumour necrosis factor (TNF alpha; 5 pg lip(-1)), interleukin(IL)-1 beta (0.5 pg lip(-1)), IL-6 (2 ng lip(-1)) and IL-8 (200 pg lip(-1)), or the indirectly acting sympathomimetic drug tyramine (200 microg lip(-1)), each augmented only the second phase of nociception. 3. Conversely, both phases of nociception induced by 2.5% formalin were inhibited by the bradykinin (BK) B(2) receptor antagonist HOE140 (5 microg lip(-1)) or the selective beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol (100 microg lip(-1)). However, the BK B(1) receptor antagonist des-Arg(9)-Leu(8)-BK (1 and 2 microg lip(-1)), antibody and/or antiserum against each of the cytokines, the adrenergic neurone blocker guanethidine (30 mg kg(-1) day(-1), s.c., for 3 days) and the cyclooxygenase(COX)-2 inhibitor celecoxib (50 and 200 microg lip(-1), s.c.; or 1 and 3 mg kg(-1), i.p.) reduced only the second phase of the response. The nonselective COX inhibitor indomethacin and the 5-lipoxygenase activating protein inhibitor MK886 did not change formalin-induced nociception. 4. Our results indicate that BK, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, sympathetic amines and PGs (but not leukotrienes) contribute significantly to formalin-induced orofacial nociception in the rat and the response seems to be more susceptible to inhibition by B(2) receptor antagonist and selective COX-2 inhibitor than by B(1) receptor antagonist or nonselective COX inhibitor.", 
    "118": "Amyloid beta protein (Abeta)- and human group IIA secretory phospholipase A(2) (sPLA(2)-IIA)-induced neuronal cell death have been established as in vitro models for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and stroke. Both sPLA(2)-IIA and Abeta causes neuronal apoptosis by increasing the influx of Ca(2+) through L-type voltage-sensitive Ca(2+) channel (L-VSCC). In the present study, we evaluated effects of a selective L-VSCC blocker, S-(+)-methyl 4,7-dihydro-3-isobutyl-6-methyl-4-(3-nitro-phenyl)thieno[2,3-b]pyridine-5-carboxylate (S-312-d), on Abeta- and sPLA(2)-IIA-induced neuronal apoptosis in primary cultures of rat cortical neurons. S-312-d significantly rescued cortical neurons from Abeta- and sPLA(2)-IIA-induced cell death. Both cell death stimuli caused the appearance of apoptotic features such as plasma membrane blebs, chromatin condensation, and DNA fragmentation. S-312-d completely suppressed these apoptotic features. Before apoptosis, the two death ligands markedly enhanced an influx of Ca(2+) into neurons. S-312-d significantly prevented neurons from sPLA(2)-IIA- and Abeta-induced Ca(2+) influx. Furthermore, the neuroprotective effect of S-312-d was more potent than that of another L-VSCC blocker, nimodipine. On the other hand, blockers of other VSCCs such as the N-type and P/Q-type calcium channels had no effect on the neuronal cell death, apoptotic features and Ca(2+) influx. In conclusion, we demonstrated that S-312-d rescues cortical neurons from Abeta- and sPLA(2)-IIA-induced apoptosis.", 
    "119": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) augmentation with the 5-HT1A antagonist pindolol has met with mixed results. Recent studies using positron emission tomography (PET) suggest that pindolol doses used in these studies were too low to effect 5-HT1A autoreceptor blockade. To test the hypothesis that a single higher dose of pindolol would effectively augment antidepressant responses in SSRI-refractory patients, nine subjects with major depression unresponsive to paroxetine 40 mg/day given for 2 months or more were randomized to AM pindolol 7.5 mg (n=4) or placebo (n=5). Subjects were administered the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D), the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A), the Bech-Rafaelsen Melancholia Scale, and the Zung Depression Inventory at baseline and weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4. Subjects receiving pindolol exhibited significant improvements in all ratings beginning at week 2 which continued through week 4. Aside from transient dizziness and a five-point decrease in systolic/diastolic blood pressure associated with pindolol, no adverse effects were reported. Although results must be verified in a larger sample, these findings support previous studies indicating that pindolol can accelerate antidepressant responses during SSRI therapy. In addition, results reported here suggest that a single high dose of pindolol (7.5 mg) is a more effective augmentation strategy in SSRI-refractory patients compared with the same total dose given at 2.5 mg tid.",

Eight volunteers underwent color Doppler imaging for measurement of hemodynamic parameters in the central retinal artery (CRA) and ophthalmic artery (OA) after instillation of nipradilol. Intraocular pressure (IOP) and systemic blood pressure were also measured. Two months later, the same volunteers were examined after instillation of saline into the same eyes to obtain control data. The pulsatility index in the CRA was significantly lowered in the eyes treated with nipradilol compared with control eyes. Blood velocities in the CRA, hemodynamic parameters in the OA, IOP, blood pressure, and ocular perfusion pressure were unaffected by nipradilol. The current study suggests that nipradilol may dilate the CRA as a result of reduced vascular resistance in humans.",

Dofetilide is a Class III antiarrhythmic agent that is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the conversion of atrial fibrillation, as well as in the maintenance of normal sinus rhythm. Because of the risk of torsades de pointes associated with dofetilide, the FDA mandated in-hospital initiation of therapy and initially restricted dofetilide's availability to institutions and prescribers who completed appropriate educational forums. The use of dofetilide within health care systems requires specific procedures for prescribing, dispensing, and monitoring, as well as a format for educating personnel who will be involved in the care of these patients. Several models have demonstrated success in initiating dofetilide and are also used for sotalol, which also can cause torsades de pointes. The utilization of nonphysician personnel, such as nurse practitioners and clinical pharmacists, in conjunction with a team approach were essential components for the success of these models. Preprinted order forms or procedural guidelines, as well as computer-assisted dosing programs, can be utilized to prevent inappropriate or miscalculated dosing of these agents, which potentially can cause life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.",

In the Netherlands, the cardiac mortality following non-cardiac surgery is 0.68%. The patient groups at risk for cardiac complications are: age 65 years and older, patients with coronary artery disease or risk factors for coronary artery disease, and those undergoing major surgery. The period of greatest risk is the early postoperative phase. Prophylactic beta-blockade significantly reduces perioperative cardiac morbidity and mortality: the odds ratio for myocardial ischaemia is 0.34 (95% CI: 0.23-0.52), for non-fatal myocardial infarction 0.15 (95% CI: 0.06-0.40) and for cardiac mortality 0.25 (95% CI: 0.09-0.73). Long-term continuation of the beta-blockade also reduces cardiac morbidity and mortality in the first two years following the operation.",

These polymers include polysodium N-undecenoxy carbonyl-L-leucinate (poly-L-SUCL) and polysodium N-undecenoxy carbonyl-L-isoleucinate (poly-L-SUCIL). Detailed synthesis and characterization were reported in our previous paper [26]. It was found that poly-L-SUCIL gives better chiral separation than poly-L-SUCL for both nadolol and labetalol isomers. The use of 50-100 mM poly-L-SUCIL as a single chiral selector provided separation of four and three isomers of labetalol and nadolol, respectively. Further optimization in separation of both enantiomeric pairs of nadolol and labetalol was achieved by evaluation of type and concentration of organic solvents, capillary temperature as well type and concentration of cyclodextrins. A synergistic approach, using a combination of poly-L-SUCIL and sulfated beta-CD (S-beta-CD) was evaluated and it showed dramatic separation for enantiomeric pairs of nadolol. On the other hand for labetalol enantiomers, separation was slightly decreased or remain unaffected using the dual chiral selector system. Finally, simultaneous separation of both nadolol and labetalol enantiomers was achieved in a single run using 25 mM poly-L-SUCIL and 5% w/v of S-beta-CD in less then 35 min highlighting the importance of high-throughput chiral analysis.",

In a double-blind, randomized, cross-over study, 17 healthy men received 25 mg carvedilol b.i.d., 100 mg metoprolol b.i.d. or placebo for 6 days. After each treatment, systemic oxidative stress was assessed by measuring urinary excretion of 8-iso-PGF(2alpha) and 2,3-dinor-5,6-dihydro-8-iso-PGF(2alpha), and the plasma concentration of 3-nitrotyrosine by means of gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.

Population-based studies suggest that more than 50% of people over the age of 65 years may have chronic hypertension, defined as blood pressure (BP) > or = 140/90 mmHg. Hypertension, especially systolic hypertension, is the most common, powerful, however treatable risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the elderly. Large randomised trials have demonstrated that treating elderly and even very old persons (age > 80 years) is highly efficacious. A recent meta-analysis, comparing active treatment with placebo in isolated systolic hypertension demonstrated highly significant benefits: stroke was reduced by 30%, coronary heart disease events by 23%, all cardiovascular events by 26%, and cardiovascular deaths by 13%. The classic strategy of an initial thiazide or thiazide-like diuretic therapy has been verified by the most recent trials. Furthermore it is not appropriate to limit the choice of initial drugs for hypertensive older individuals to a single class of agents, since so many older people have other medical problems that affect this decision and reaching the target blood pressure is the determinant factor for cardiovascular risk reduction. Therefore single drug therapy with long-acting (dihydropyridine-type) calcium-antagonists, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor-blockers is justified with respect to individual efficacy and comorbidity. If a combination of antihypertensive drugs is needed to reach blood pressure goal, thiazides remain the cornerstone. First line therapy with an alpha-blocker is no longer recommended, even for men with hypertension and benign prostatic hypertrophy. Today, recommended blood pressure goals are the same for younger individuals and the elderly.",

While in earlier decades arterial hypertension was the main reason for developing heart failure, today coronary artery disease has become the focus of attention. However, arterial hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidemia are also main risk factors for developing coronary artery disease. In addition to non-pharmacological management with reduced fluid intake and periodical exercise training particularly in stable heart failure, in the last decade some special drug compounds have demonstrated a significant reduction in mortality in great double blind randomized trials. ACE-inhibitors and betablockers are essential components in treating congestive heart failure. Angiotensin-II-receptorblockers are indicated if ACE inhibitors and/or beta-blockers are not tolerated. The combined use of all three compounds was shown to result in a further reduction of mortality in the recently presented CHARM study. In progressive heart failure the use of diuretics is necessary and effective especially when fluid overload exists. Not treating heart failure is followed by high mortality, as we know, and so adequate and uncompromising treatment of hypertension is the most important approach to prevent the further development of heart failure.",

Failure to achieve the goal was most commonly due to elevated SBP. In all, 55 % of the patients were prescribed ACE-I or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB).

Immunoblot analyses using anti-S535 phosphospecific eIF2Bepsilon antibody showed that S535 phosphorylation of endogenous eIF2Bepsilon was decreased by LiCl or ISO, suggesting that GSK-3beta is the predominant kinase regulating phosphorylation of eIF2Bepsilon-S535 in cardiac myocytes. Decreases in eIF2Bepsilon-S535 phosphorylation were also observed in a rat model of cardiac hypertrophy in vivo. Overexpression of wild-type eIF2Bepsilon alone moderately increased cell size (+31+/-11%; P<0.05 versus control), whereas treatment of eIF2Bepsilon-transduced myocytes with LiCl (+73+/-22% versus eIF2Bepsilon only; P<0.05) or ISO (+84+/-33% versus eIF2Bepsilon only; P<0.05) enhanced the effect of eIF2Bepsilon. Overexpression of eIF2Bepsilon-S535A, which is not phosphorylated by GSK-3beta, increased cell size (+107+/-35%) as strongly as ISO (+95+/-25%), and abolished antihypertrophic effects of GSK-3beta, indicating that S535 phosphorylation of eIF2Bepsilon critically mediates antihypertrophic effects of GSK-3beta. Furthermore, expression of eIF2Bepsilon-F259L, a dominant-negative mutant, inhibited ISO-induced hypertrophy, indicating that eIF2Bepsilon is required for beta-adrenergic hypertrophy. Interestingly, expression of eIF2Bepsilon-S535A partially increased cytoskeletal reorganization, whereas it did not increase expression of atrial natriuretic factor gene. These results suggest that GSK-3beta is the predominant kinase mediating phosphorylation of eIF2Bepsilon-S535 in cardiac myocytes, which in turn plays an important role in regulating cardiac hypertrophy primarily through protein synthesis.",

    "159": "The slope of the action potential duration (APD) restitution curve may be a significant determinant of the propensity to develop ventricular fibrillation, with steeper slopes associated with a more arrhythmogenic substrate. We hypothesized that one mechanism by which beta-blockers reduce sudden cardiac death is by flattening the APD restitution curve. Therefore, we investigated whether infusion of esmolol modulates the APD restitution curve in vivo. In 10 Yorkshire pigs, dynamic APD restitution curves were determined from measurements of APD at 90% repolarization with a monophasic action potential catheter positioned against the right ventricular septum during right ventricular apical pacing in the basal state and during infusion of esmolol. APD restitution curves were fitted to the three-parameter (a, b, c) exponential equation, APD = a.[1 - e((-b.DI))] + c, where DI is the diastolic interval. Esmolol decreased the maximal APD slope, 0.68 +/- 0.14 vs. 0.94 +/- 0.24 (baseline), P = 0.002, and flattened the APD restitution curve at shorter DIs, 75 and 100 ms (P < 0.05). To compare the slopes of the APD restitution curves at similar steady states, slopes were also computed at points of intersection between the restitution curve and the lines representing pacing at a fixed cycle length (CL) of 200, 225, 250, 275, and 300 ms using the relationship CL = APD + DI. Esmolol decreased APD restitution slopes at CLs 200-275 ms (P < 0.05). Esmolol flattens the cardiac APD restitution curve in vivo, particularly at shorter CLs and DIs. This may represent a novel mechanism by which beta-blockers prevent sudden cardiac death.", 
    "160": "The influence of threshold electrical currents (EC) during regular drive on pulmonary vein (PV) and atrial myocardial cell action potential (AP) duration (APD) is unknown. We determined the effects of EC on cellular APD of PV, atria, and ventricles in isolated perfused and superfused male rat hearts (Fisher-344 strain, 3-4 mo old) at 37 degrees C (n = 14). We determined APD changes caused by subthreshold and threshold EC synchronized with a distant pacing electrode and delivered nearby cells from which transmembrane APs were recorded with a glass microelectrode. Progressive APD shortening (P < 0.001) and membrane hyperpolarization (P < 0.05) developed over a 20-s interval in the PV and atrial cells when the EC was delivered at <2 mm but not at >4 mm from the microelectrode. No such effects were seen in ventricular muscle cells. APD fully recovered 25 s after the cessation of EC application. Premature stimuli applied during EC-induced shortening of the APD caused rapid repetitive PV and atrial activity lasting two to five beats. Atropine (2 microM, n = 10) prevented, whereas propranolol (2 microM, n = 5) had no effect, on EC-induced APD shortening or repetitive activity. We conclude that EC shortens the APD and hyperpolarizes the membrane by local release of acetylcholine and causes the steep repolarization gradient in the vicinity of the current source leading to repetitive activity in atrial and PV cells during premature stimulation.",

For patients with AF and structurally abnormal hearts, atenolol, metoprolol, or carvedilol are appropriate choices. Adequate ventricular rate control by pharmacological agents should be evaluated by either 24-hour Holter monitoring or a submaximal stress test to determine the resting and exercise ventricular rate. If the mean ventricular rate is not close to 80 beats per minute, or the heart rate on moderate exertion is not between 90 to 115 beats per minute, a second agent to control the rate should be added.

Experiments were carried out in ethylurethane-anaesthetised male Wistar rats subjected to haemorrhagic hypotension (mean arterial pressure MAP 20-25 mmHg), which led to the death of all control animals within 30 min. The HNMT inhibitor metoprine (20 micro g; i.c.v.) administered 5 min after establishing the critical hypotension increased the endogenous histamine concentration, measured 20 min after treatment, in the hypothalamus (534.33+/-67.52 vs. 423.98+/-54.17 ng/g wet tissue; P<0.05) and medulla oblongata (53.12+/-9.78 vs. 39.58+/-11.16 ng/g wet tissue; P<0.05). These responses were accompanied by plasma levels of noradrenaline and adrenaline 2.7 and 1.7 times higher respectively than in the control group ( P<0.01). Metoprine evoked dose-dependent (5, 10, 20 micro g; i.c.v.) rises in MAP and heart rate (HR) that were significantly higher than those in normotensive animals, and resulted in a 100% survival rate at 2 h after treatment (20 micro g; i.c.v.). The resuscitative effect was associated with rises in renal, hindquarters and mesenteric blood flows. The nicotinic cholinoceptor antagonist hexamethonium (3 mg/kg; i.v.) attenuated the MAP and HR changes, whereas the muscarinic cholinoceptor blocker methylatropine (2 mg/kg; i.v.) attenuated only the pressor effect. Metoprine-induced MAP and regional haemodynamic effects were also reduced by alpha(1)- and alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonists prazosin (0.5 mg/kg; i.v.) and yohimbine (1 mg/kg; i.v.), while the beta-adrenoceptor blocker propranolol (1 mg/kg; i.v.) diminished only HR changes. Ganglionic transmission inhibitors and adrenoceptor antagonists did not influence the survival rate at 2 h in the metoprine-treated groups. Bilateral adrenal demedullation diminished the pressor effect of metoprine, however, without influence on HR and survival at 2 h after treatment. In conclusion, the study demonstrates the activation of the sympathetic nervous system elicited by endogenous central histamine in haemorrhage-shocked rats and confirms its involvement in histamine-induced resuscitation.", 
    "211": "Numerous extensive, randomized clinical trials of beta-blockers have shown significant reduction of total mortality in patients with myocardial infarction and chronic heart failure. The life-saving therapy of myocardial infarction or chronic heart failure with beta-blockers, however, is often withheld from patients with COPD/asthma. Several studies demonstrate that especially patients with COPD would benefit from such a therapy due to their high cardiovascular risk profile. Recent meta-analyses show that cardioselective beta-blockers are well tolerated by these patients without causing relevant limitations in lung function. Present findings suggest that the mortality reduction of beta-blocker therapy may outweigh the risks in patients with COPD and possibly even in patients with mild asthma. Contraindications for beta-blockers include acute exacerbations and severe forms of COPD as well as moderate to severe asthma and the regular use of beta(2)-sympathomimetics. beta-Blocker therapy should be given with low initial doses on an individual basis after careful consideration of the benefit to risk ratio, preferably using cardioselective substances with proven mortality benefits for myocardial infarction and chronic heart failure.", 
    "212": "The distinction between primary and secondary prevention has been abandoned in favor of cardiovascular prevention, mandating individual risk assessment. First, the individual cardiovascular risk of a person is determined by index diseases like myocardial infarction, peripheral arterial disease or other, or, if absent, by a score consisting of a number of conventional risk factors. According to current guidelines, cardiovascular prevention is indicated, as soon as the risk for fatal cardiovascular disease is > or = 5 %, equivalent to a risk for a major cardiovascular event of > or = 20 %. Non-pharmaceutical approaches are: refraining from smoking, mediterranean diet with fatty fish, physical activity and normal body weight. Blood pressure and diabetes mellitus are optimized. In addition, the following agents are used: platelet inhibitors, beta-blockers, ACE-inhibitors, statins and omega-3 fatty acids. A number of structural problems add to individual factors impeding optimal implementation of cardiovascular prevention in Germany.", 
    "213": "The interaction during stimulation of cGMP and inhibition of cAMP was investigated in control and renal hypertensive hearts. Control and hypertensive [1 kidney, 1 clip (1K1C)] rabbits were used. The anesthetized open-chest groups were vehicle, 8-bromo-cGMP (8-Br-cGMP; 10(-3)M), propranolol (Prop; 2 mg/kg), and Prop + 8-Br-cGMP. O(2) consumption levels (Vo(2)) in the subepicardium (Epi) and subendocardium (Endo) were determined from coronary flow (microspheres) and O(2) extraction (microspectrophotometry). Wall thickening and cAMP levels were also determined. In control, no significant change in Vo(2) was seen for the 8-Br-cGMP group, but Vo(2) was decreased from Epi (9.7 +/- 1.5 ml O(2) x min(-1) x 100 g(-1)) and Endo (10.5 +/- 0.4 ml O(2) x min(-1) x 100 g(-1)) to 6.8 +/- 0.6/7.8 +/- 0.5 ml O(2) x min(-1) x 100 g(-1) in the control Prop group. Control Prop + 8-Br-cGMP did not cause a further fall in Vo(2) but lowered Endo flow. In 1K1C, Vo(2) decreased from Epi/Endo (10.8 +/- 1.3/11 +/- 1.0 ml O(2).min(-1).100 g(-1)) to 7.8 +/- 1.1/8.7 +/- 0.5 ml O(2) x min(-1) x 100 g(-1) in the 1K1C 8-Br-cGMP group and to 7 +/- 0.5/8.1 +/- 0.5 ml O(2) x min(-1) x 100 g(-1) in the 1K1C Prop group. 1K1C Prop + 8-Br-cGMP did not cause a further fall in Vo(2) but lowered blood flow. No significant changes in cAMP levels were present with 8-Br-cGMP in control or 1K1C rabbits, but significant decreases were seen with Prop in both control and 1K1C rabbits. No further change was seen in Prop + 8-Br-cGMP for either control or 1K1C. Thus the negative metabolic effect of stimulating cGMP was seen only in the hypertensive rabbit heart. The negative metabolic effect of inhibiting cAMP was seen in both the control and the hypertensive rabbit heart. However, the negative metabolic effects of cGMP and cAMP were nonadditive.", 
    "214": "Several studies have reported that glucocorticoids impair memory retrieval. The present study examined in male Sprague-Dawley rats the effects of systemically administered corticosterone on retrieval of memory for inhibitory avoidance training. Corticosterone (3.0mg/kg, s.c.) injected 30min before retention testing, 48h after training, significantly impaired retention performance, as compared to vehicle treatment, of rats tested in the training context. In contrast, corticosterone administration did not impair retrieval when rats were tested for retention in a different context. Corticosterone did also not impair retention performance of rats given a mild-intensity footshock that resulted in only weak, non-contextual memory. These findings strongly suggest that corticosterone selectively impaired retrieval of contextual information associated with the training context. The centrally acting beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (2.0mg/kg), co-administered in a dose that did not affect retention performance alone, blocked the impairment in contextual memory retrieval induced by corticosterone. These findings provide evidence for the view that glucocorticoids interact with noradrenergic mechanisms in influencing memory retrieval.",

    "216": "The cells were divided into two groups: the low sugar concentration and high sugar concentration groups. These cells were examined with radioimmunoassay and fluorescence method and the effects of nifedipine (NIF), verapamil (VER), and diltiazem (DIL) on the contents of Ca2+ in the islet cells and the secretion volume of insulin at different concentrations were observed.", 
    "217": "In the low sugar concentration group, NIF, VER and DIL at concentration of 25, 50 and 100 microg/L respectively showed no effect on the contents of Ca2+ in islet cells and the insulin secretion (no statistical significance, P > 0.05). In the high sugar concentration group, these drugs had no inhibitory effect on insulin secretion at concentration of 25 microg/L. However, there was remarkable reduction in Ca2+ contents and insulin secretion when NIF was at the concentration of 50 and 100 microg/L, showing a relationship with dosage (P > 0.05, P > 0.01). VER, when given at 50 microg/L, showed a tendency of reduction in insulin secretion and there was a remarkable reduction at a dosage of 100 microg/L as compared with the control group (P > 0.05). When DIL was given at 100 microg/L, there was a noticeable difference in reduction of insulin secretion as compared with the control group (P > 0.05).", 
    "218": "High dosage of NIF, VER and DIL has an inhibitory effect on the entrance of extracellular Ca2+ into islet cells and thus reduces insulin secretion."
