    "9": "Chronic stress is known to have a profound negative impact on human health and has been suggested to influence a number of disease states. However, the mechanisms underlying the deleterious effects of stress remain largely unknown. Stress is known to promote the release of epinephrine, a catecholamine stress hormone that binds to \u03b2(2)-adrenergic receptors (\u03b2(2)ARs) with high affinity. Our previous work has demonstrated that chronic stimulation of a \u03b2(2)AR-\u03b2-arrestin-1-mediated signaling pathway by infusion of isoproterenol suppresses p53 levels and impairs genomic integrity. In this pathway, \u03b2-arrestin-1, which is activated via \u03b2(2)ARs, facilitates the AKT-mediated activation of Mdm2 and functions as a molecular scaffold to promote the binding and degradation of p53 by the E3-ubiquitin ligase, Mdm2. Here, we show that chronic restraint stress in mice recapitulates the effects of isoproterenol infusion to reduce p53 levels and results in the accumulation of DNA damage in the frontal cortex of the brain, two effects that are abrogated by the \u03b2-blocker, propranolol and by genetic deletion of \u03b2-arrestin-1. These data suggest that the \u03b2(2)AR-\u03b2-arrestin-1 signaling pathway may represent an attractive therapeutic target to prevent some of the negative consequences of stress in the treatment of stress-related disorders.",

Flecainide was initiated because of significant ventricular arrhythmias (n = 8), syncope (n = 3), or cardiac arrest (n = 1). At the baseline exercise test before flecainide, 6 patients had ventricular tachycardia and 5 patients had bigeminal or frequent ventricular premature beats. Flecainide reduced ventricular arrhythmias at the exercise test in 8 patients compared to conventional therapy, similar to that in patients with genotype-positive CPVT in our previous report. Notably, flecainide completely prevented ventricular arrhythmias in 7 patients. Flecainide was continued in all patients except for one who had ventricular tachycardia at the exercise test on flecainide. During a follow-up of 48\u00b194 months, arrhythmia events (sudden cardiac death and aborted cardiac arrest) associated with noncompliance occurred in 2 patients.

    "15": "Arterial hemodynamic assessments with technique of spectral analysis can obtain complete hemodynamic parameters including steady and pulsatile components. The steady parameters include arterial pressure (AP), heart rate, cardiac output, stroke volume and total peripheral resistance (TPR). Parameters of pulsatile hemodynamics are characteristic impedance (Zc), arterial compliance (Cm) and pulse wave reflection (Pb) etc. Studies of ventricular hypertrophy (VH) and arterial hemodynamics have disclosed several important findings. Hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) and human subjects causes functional abnormalities in the resistance and Windkessel vessels. The extent of VH in SHR and hypertensive subjects was not correlated with AP and TPR, but positively correlated with pulsatile hemodynamic factors such as Zc and Pb. Many antihypertensive and vasodilators were capable of reducing the AP, but did not improve the VH. We have also investigated the effects of vasodilatory agents such as nifedipine (a calcium channel blocker), propranol (a non-selective \u03b2-adrenergic blocker) and atenol (a selective \u03b2-adrenergic inhibitor) on the arterial hemodynamics and VH. In addition, the effects of acute and chronic nitric oxide (NO) deprivation with N\u03c9-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) on the arterial hemodynamics and VH were evaluated. We compared the endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilation to acetylcholine, sodium nitroprusside and S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillanine and the endothelium-dependent or -independent vasoconstriction to norepinephrine and phenylephrine between SHR and normotensive Wistar Kyoto strain. In SHR with long-term administration of L-NAME, VH was associated with decreases in left ventricular cGMP and nitrate/nitrite accompanying increase in collagen content. Coadministration of NO precursor L-arginine improved the VH and fibrosis. In VH caused by long-term L-NAME, the LW/BW ratio, total number, numerical density and size of cardiomyocytes were correlated well with both steady and pulsatile hemodymanics. Aortic stiffness has significant impact on the cardiovascular risks. We simulated aortic stiffness by applying silicon gel embedding of the abdominal and/or thoracic aorta. Aortic stiffness did not affect the blood pressure and the steady hemodynamics. It caused VH associated with increases in the pulsatile hemodynamics. The extent of VH (LVW/BW, total number, numerical density, size of cardiomyocytes and collagen volume fraction) was correlated with the pulsatile hemodynamics (impedance, pulse wave velocity and wave reflection). The finding further supports the contention that blood pressure is not the determinant of VH. The ventricular afterload is the major cause of VH. The hemodynamic consequences of ovariectomy (Ovx), menopause and estrogen replacement were investigated. Ovx increased body weight, LVW/BW ratio, Zc and Pb, but decreased Cm. These changes were reversed by estrogen replacement. For steady hemodynamics, Ovx did not much alter the systolic, mean and diastolic pressure. The pulse pressure was slightly elevated. There was large increase in TPR. Again, these changes were reversed by estrogen supplement. The implication of these findings was that menopause tends to exert vasoconstrictory effects on the resistance and Windkessel vessels. On the contrary, estrogen possesses a vasodilatory influence on the systemic vessels.",

    "20": "In this study, we treated PC12 cells with 0-20 \u03bcM amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (25-35) for 24 hours to induce cytotoxicity, and found that 5-20 \u03bcM amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (25-35) decreased PC12 cell viability, but adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channel activator diazoxide suppressed the decrease in PC12 cell viability induced by amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (25-35). Diazoxide protected PC12 cells against amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (25-35)-induced increases in mitochondrial membrane potential and intracellular reactive oxygen species levels. These protective effects were reversed by the selective mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channel blocker 5-hydroxydecanoate. An inducible nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, N\u03c9-nitro-L-arginine, also protected PC12 cells from amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (25-35)-induced increases in both mitochondrial membrane potential and intracellular reactive oxygen species levels. However, the H2O2-degrading enzyme catalase could not reverse the amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (25-35)-induced increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species. A 24-hour exposure to amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (25-35) did not result in apoptosis or necrosis, suggesting that the increases in both mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive oxygen species levels preceded cell death. The data suggest that amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (25-35) cytotoxicity is associated with adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channels and nitric oxide. Regulation of adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channels suppresses PC12 cell cytotoxicity induced by amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (25-35).",

    "22": "Beta-adrenergic receptors (\u03b2-ARs) play a role in angiogenic processes that characterize neovascularization-associated retinal diseases, but the role of \u03b23-ARs has not been disclosed yet. We used ex vivo retinal explants to investigate the role of \u03b23-ARs in regulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) release associated with hypoxia. Whether nitric oxide (NO) mediates \u03b23-AR regulation of VEGF release was also investigated. \u03b23-AR activation was obtained using BRL 37344, whereas SR59230A, L-748,337, or specific siRNAs were used to block \u03b23-ARs. Pharmacological approaches were used to interfere with the NO pathway. Western blot was used to determine \u03b2-AR levels. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure VEGF release. NO production was assessed by a colorimetric assay. We found that hypoxia upregulates \u03b23-ARs. In addition, we observed that \u03b23-AR activation with BRL 37344 increases VEGF release in response to hypoxia. Either \u03b23-AR blocker or \u03b23-AR silencing downregulates drastically hypoxic levels of VEGF. With experiments using NO synthase (NOS) blockade with L-NAME, NOS activation with fluvastatin or NO supplementation with SNAP, we demonstrated that \u03b23-ARs and VEGF are functionally coupled via the NO pathway. In summary, the data presented here support the assumption that \u03b23-ARs are involved in the regulation of angiogenic responses to hypoxia through the NO signalling, a key pathway in hypoxic/ischemic diseases. Although extrapolation of these data to the human situation is difficult, these findings may help to explore the possible role of \u03b23-ARs in vascularization-associated disorders.", 
    "23": "The small GTPase RhoA and its associated kinase ROCKII are involved in vascular smooth muscle cell contraction and endothelial NO synthase mRNA destabilization. Overactivation of the RhoA/ROCKII pathway is implicated in several pathologies, including chronic heart failure (CHF), and may contribute to the enhanced sympathetic outflow seen in CHF as a result of decreased NO availability. Thus, we hypothesized that central ROCKII blockade would improve the sympathovagal imbalance in a pacing rabbit model of CHF in an NO-dependent manner. CHF was induced by rapid ventricular pacing and characterized by an ejection fraction of \u226445%. Animals were implanted with an intracerbroventricular cannula and osmotic minipump (rate, 1 \u03bcL/h) containing sterile saline, 1.5 \u00b5g/kg per day fasudil (Fas, a ROCKII inhibitor) for 4 days or Fas+100 \u00b5g/kg per day N\u03c9-Nitro-l-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride, a NO synthase inhibitor. Arterial baroreflex control was assessed by intravenous infusion of sodium nitroprusside and phenylephrine. Fas infusion significantly lowered resting heart rate by decreasing sympathetic and increasing vagal tone. Furthermore, Fas improved baroreflex gain in CHF in an NO-dependent manner. In CHF Fas animals, the decrease in heart rate in response to intravenous metoprolol was similar to Sham and was reversed by N\u03c9-Nitro-l-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride. Fas decreased angiotensin II type 1 receptor and phospho-ERM protein expression and increased endothelial NO synthase expression in the brain stem of CHF animals. These data strongly suggest that central ROCKII activation contributes to cardiac sympathoexcitation in the setting of CHF and that central Fas restores vagal and sympathetic tone in an NO-dependent manner. ROCKII may be a new central therapeutic target in the setting of CHF.", 
    "24": "The aim of the current study was to characterize the effects of the novel \u03b2-adrenergic antagonist nebivolol on central aortic blood pressures, arterial properties, and nitroxidergic activity in individuals with prehypertension. Prehypertension is emerging as a major risk factor for several adverse cardiovascular consequences. Increased pulse wave velocity, aortic augmentation index, and aortic blood pressures have been linked with augmented risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. While the effects of antihypertensive drugs on these parameters in hypertensive patients have been studied, there are limited data so far in prehypertension. Fifty individuals with prehypertension were randomized to either nebivolol (5 mg per day) or placebo in a double-blind clinical trial. Patients underwent measurement of pulse wave velocity as well as aortic blood pressure and aortic augmentation index via pulse wave analysis at baseline and 8 weeks. Patients also had blood and urine biochemistries done at each visit. Nebivolol achieved significant reductions in central aortic systolic (P=.011), diastolic (P=.009), and mean arterial blood pressure (P=.002). Pulse wave velocity trended toward improvement but did not achieve significance (P=.088). Nitric oxide production, measured as urinary nitrite/nitrite excretion, also rose substantially in the nebivolol group (by approximately 60%, P=.030). Central blood pressures can be effectively lowered by \u03b2-blockade while patients are still in the prehypertension phase, and the effects may be coupled to improve nitric oxide release by the drug.", 
    "25": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate factors that impact outcome following repair of type A aortic dissection. Over 25 years (1984-2009), 252 patients underwent repair of acute type A dissection. Mean follow-up for reoperation or death was 6.9\u00b15.9 years. Operative mortality was 16% (41 of 252). Multivariate analysis identified one risk factor for operative death: presentation malperfusion (P=.003). For operative survivors, 5-, 10-, and 20-year survival was 78%\u00b13%, 59%\u00b14%, and 24%\u00b16%, respectively. Late death occurred earlier in patients with previous stroke (P=.02) and chronic renal insufficiency (P=.007). Risk factors for late reoperation included male sex (P=.006), Marfan syndrome (P<.001), elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP, P<.001), and absence of \u03b2-blocker therapy (P<.001). Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated at 10-year follow-up that patients who maintained SBP <120 mm Hg had improved freedom from reoperation (92\u00b15%) compared with those with SBP 120 mm Hg to 140 mm Hg (74%\u00b17%) or >140 mm Hg (49%\u00b114%, P<.001). At 10-year follow-up, patients on \u03b2-blocker therapy experienced 86%\u00b15% freedom from reoperation compared with only 57%\u00b111% for those without (P<.001). Operative survival was decreased with preoperative malperfusion. Long-term survival was dependent on comorbidities but not operative approach. Reoperation was markedly increased in patients not on \u03b2-blocker therapy and decreased with improved SBP control. Strict control of hypertension with \u03b2-blocker therapy is warranted following repair of acute type A dissection.", 
    "26": "It has long been known that antihypertensive drugs may affect blood glucose in a differential manner. In particular new onset diabetes is significantly increased in association with the use of thiazides or beta-blockers, respectively, compared to placebo, whereas treatment with angiotensin-conversion-enzyme-inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor-blockers is associated with a lower than expected frequency, as also assessed in several meta-analyses. In line with these notions, the NAVIGATOR Trial was the first to report a significant preventive effect of an angiotensin-receptor-blocker on new onset diabetes evaluated as a primary outcome in a prospective randomized study. Hence, and in view of the fact that comparable blood pressure lowering with any of the five major classes of antihypertensive drugs, including calcium-channel-blockers, give comparable benefits in reducing cardiovascular complications, unless there are specific indications or contraindications for an individual drug, caution should be exercised, therefore, to use beta-blockers or thiazides as first-line drugs for blood pressure lowering indications in subjects at high risk to develop diabetes, especially in patients with so called metabolic syndrome. The potential of glycemic worsening in overt diabetic patients with thiazides or beta-blockers has less well been studied systematically, yet paradigmatically in UKPDS evaluating a randomized comparison of a beta-blocker with an angiotensin-conversion-enzyme(ACE)-inhibitor. Not only was there HbA1c worsening with beta-blocker use which required additional blood glucose lowering therapy, but also significantly more weight gain which still was detectable at the 20\u2003year follow-up. On the other hand, the overall cardiovascular outcomes were comparable in the two treatment groups irrespective whether therapy was based on the beta blocker atenolol or the ACE-inhibitor captopril. Awareness of these facts and highly individualized therapy seem to be the way forward.",

Heart rate decreased more in the propranolol arm than in the losartan arm (P\u2009<\u20090.01); however, no correlation between the decrease of heart rate and the reduction of HVPG was observed. One patient in the losartan group, although a responder, had gastrointestinal bleeding 2 months after the drug administration, but the varices were small under endoscopy and did not require definitive therapy. The fall of MABP was greater with losartan, with no statistical difference between the two groups.",

Four years later, her son was diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and she tested positive as a carrier of the mutant gene. It is unclear whether the DMD carrier state alone is associated with increased susceptibility to PPCM or if this is merely the first expression of cardiomyopathy in a previously asymptomatic carrier.",

SAC activation failed to induce abnormal impulses in wild type (WT) myocytes but steadily produced early after-depolarizations and automaticity in KO myocytes in which an increase in L-type calcium channel (LTCC) current (I(Ca)) and a reduction of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) leak and action potential duration (APD) were observed. The abnormal impulses were not suppressed by CaMKII inhibitor AIP whereas a low concentration of nifedipine eliminated abnormal impulses without shortening APD, implicating I(Ca) in promoting stretch-induced abnormal impulses. In addition, APD prolongation by LTCC opener S(-)Bay K 8644 or isoproterenol facilitated abnormal impulse induction in WT ventricular myocytes even in the presence of CaMKII inhibitor AIP, whereas APD prolongation by K(+) channel blocker 4-aminopyridine promoted abnormal impulses in KO myocytes but not in WT myocytes.",

    "40": "Keloids are characterised by the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM), especially overabundant collagen formation. In keloid fibroblasts (KFs), transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2-dependent signalling is closely associated with a variety of keloid pathologic responses such as ECM production and fibroblast overgrowth. Thus, inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 signalling would be a potential therapeutic approach to prevent keloid scar formation. Thereby, we aimed to identify a novel TGF-\u03b2 signalling blocker among natural products using a simplified screening approach. We discovered that the extract of Aneilema keisak (A.K-Ex) lowered TGF-\u03b2-dependent signalling by reducing Smad2 protein levels. Given that KFs showed altered dependency on TGF-\u03b2 for survival and proliferation, A.K-Ex-mediated reduction in Smad2 protein levels significantly inhibited the major characteristics of KFs such as cell growth, migration and collagen synthesis, suggesting that A.K-Ex exhibits possible therapeutic activity on keloids.",

The expression of adhesion molecules in platelets, aorta and monocyte-macrophage were enhanced by HFD. HFD also increased upstream proteins and their phosphorylated form in the aorta. In treatment groups, eugenosedin-A and atorvastatin improved HFD-induced hyperlipidaemia and levels of insulin. Eugenosedin-A reduced the upregulation of P-selectin, ICAM-1, ICAM-2, ICAM-3, VCAM, PECAM in platelets and inhibited E-selectin, ICAM-1, ICAM-2, ICAM-3, VCAM and PECAM protein levels in the aorta. Eugenosedin-A reduced the ACAT-1 protein expression of monocyte-macrophages. The expression of PKC\u03b1, MAPKs, IKK\u03b1 and p65 and their phosphorylated form were reduced in treatment groups.",

This effect is antagonized by administration of protein synthesis inhibitors anisomycin and rapamycin into the hippocampus, but not into the amygdala, immediately after either novelty or extinction training, as well as by the gene expression blocker 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole administered after novelty training, but not after extinction training. Thus, this effect can be attributed to a mechanism similar to synaptic tagging, through which long-term potentiation can be enhanced by other long-term potentiations or by exposure to a novel environment in a protein synthesis-dependent fashion. Extinction learning produces a tag at the appropriate synapses, whereas novelty learning causes the synthesis of plasticity-related proteins that are captured by the tag, strengthening the synapses that generated this tag.",

Frequent ventricular ectopy can be associated with deterioration of cardiac function and may lead to VPC-induced cardiomyopathy. VPC-induced inter- and/or intraventricular dyssynchrony has been postulated as the main mechanism underlying VPC-induced left ventricular dysfunction. For risk stratification, VPCs in the setting of CHF can not be regarded to be a benign arrhythmia as in an apparently healthy subject. However, any potential survival benefits to be derived from suppression of VPCs or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in CHF may be offset by the negative inotropic and proarrhythmic effects of antiarrhythmic drugs and may be masked by the risk of death that is already high in this subgroup of patients. \u03b2-Blockers are currently considered to be the first-line therapy, with amiodarone as a back-up. Catheter ablation, although invasive and not without procedural risk, avoids the common adverse effects of currently available antiarrhythmic medications.

The 75 g oral glucose tolerance test showed a decrease in plasma glucose to 56 mg/dl at five hours, but this was not associated with clear hypoglycemic symptoms, and normal plasma glucose level recovered naturally after the test. At 48-hour fasting test, plasma glucose dropped to under 50 mg/dl, but the patient didn't feel hypoglycemia symptom and plasma glucose recovered naturally, but the patient developed cold sweat and hyperventilation after returning to his own room after the test. At that stage, the heart rate increased to 140 beats/min of sinus tachycardia, as confirmed by Holter monitoring. Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) was suspected because tachycardia occurred only in daytime after an event such as consumption of diet and urination. A head-up tilt test was ordered since sinus tachycardia developed especially on standing. The results showed an increase in heart rate without reduction in blood pressure, confirming the diagnosis of POTS. A repeat head-up tilt test under the use of a beta-blocker showed no increase in heart rate. Though it is generally difficult to distinguish POTS from other forms of tachyarrhythmia, such as inappropriate sinus tachycardia and sinus node reentry tachycardia, and from neutrally mediated reflex syncope (NMS), POTS should be differentiated from hypoglycemia since each condition should be treated differently.",

A consensus conference was held on December 9, 2011. The multidisciplinary team reviewed existing data on the pharmacologic properties of propranolol and all published reports pertaining to the use of propranolol in pediatric patients. Workgroups were assigned specific topics to propose protocols on the following subjects: contraindications, special populations, pretreatment evaluation, dose escalation, and monitoring. Consensus protocols were recorded during the meeting and refined after the meeting. When appropriate, protocol clarifications and revision were made and agreed upon by the group via teleconference. Because of the absence of high-quality clinical research data, evidence-based recommendations are not possible at present. However, the team agreed on a number of recommendations that arose from a review of existing evidence, including when to treat complicated IH; contraindications and pretreatment evaluation protocols; propranolol use in PHACE syndrome; formulation, target dose, and frequency of propranolol; initiation of propranolol in infants; cardiovascular monitoring; ongoing monitoring; and prevention of hypoglycemia. Where there was considerable controversy, the more conservative approach was selected. We acknowledge that the recommendations are conservative in nature and anticipate that they will be revised as more data are made available.", 
    "126": "Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) is a syndrome in which the sinus heart rate is inexplicably faster than expected and associated symptoms are present. The heart rate at rest, even in a supine position, can exceed 100 beats/min; minimal activity accelerates the rate rapidly and substantially. Patients with IST may require restriction from physical activity. Mechanisms responsible for IST are understood incompletely. It is important to distinguish IST from so-called appropriate sinus tachycardia and from postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, with which overlap may occur. Because the long-term outcome seems to be benign, treatment may be unnecessary or may be as simple as physical training. However, for patients with intolerable symptoms, therapeutic measures are warranted. Even at high doses, \u03b2-adrenergic blockers, the first-line therapy, often are ineffective; the same is true for most other medical therapies. In rare instances, catheter- or surgically- based right atrial or sinus node modification may be helpful, but even this is fraught with limited efficacy and potential complications.

Even though the heart rate at the end of the treatment was lower for the nebivolol group, the rate of decrease of heart rates between carvedilol and nebivolol groups was not statistically significant (p=0.074). Both groups demonstrated improvements in the diastolic functions of the left ventricle where certain values showed more improvement for the nebivolol group. Both groups showed improvements in AS and AD rates compared to basal rates; however, these improvements were not statistically significant. Although the improvement rates in AS, AD, and ASI were higher in the nebivolol group compared to the carvedilol group, the differences were not statistically significant (p=0.091, p=0.095, p=0.259, respectively).",

The improvement was more explicit in the nebivolol group. It may be concluded that nebivolol is slightly superior to carvedilol in reducing heart rate and improving left ventricular diastolic functions.

A substantial portion of patients showed elevated levels of anti-gliadin antibodies (IgA: 60%, IgG: 34%) whereas no anti-endomysial antibodies were detected. A significant correlation of portal pressure (i.e., HVPG) with all markers of gastroduodenal/intestinal permeability and with LBP and IL-6 levels was observed. NOD2 and TLR2 risk variants were associated with abnormal intestinal permeability and elevated markers of bacterial translocation. At follow-up HVPG measurements under NSBB, we found an amelioration of gastroduodenal/intestinal permeability and a decrease of bacterial translocation (LBP - 16% p=0.018; IL-6 - 41% p<0.0001) levels, which was not limited to hemodynamic responders. Abnormal SLM test results and higher LBP/IL-6 levels were associated with a higher risk of variceal bleeding during follow-up but not with mortality.",

    "137": "While blood vessels have long been implicated in diverse pain syndromes (e.g., migraine headache, angina pectoris, vasculitis, and Raynaud's syndrome), underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Recent evidence supports a contribution of the vascular endothelium in endothelin-1-induced hyperalgesia, and its enhancement by repeated mechanical stimulation; a phenomenon referred to as stimulus-induced enhancement of (endothelin) hyperalgesia (SIEH). SIEH is thought to be mediated by release of ATP from endothelial cells, to act on P2X3 receptors on nociceptors. In the present study we evaluated the ability of another vasoactive hyperalgesic agent, epinephrine, to induce endothelial cell-dependent hyperalgesia and SIEH. We found that epinephrine also produces hyperalgesia and SIEH. Both P2X3 receptor antagonists, A317491 and octoxynol-9, which attenuate endothelial cell function, eliminated SIEH without affecting epinephrine hyperalgesia. We further evaluated the hypothesis that members of two important classes of drugs used to treat migraine headache, whose receptors are present in endothelial cells - the triptans and \u03b2 blockers - have a vascular component to their anti-hyperalgesic action. For this, we tested the effect of ICI-118,551, a \u03b2\u2082-adrenergic receptor antagonist and sumatriptan, an agonist at 5-HT1B and 5-HT\u2081D receptors, on nociceptive effects of endothelin and epinephrine. ICI-118,551 inhibited endothelin SIEH, and attenuated epinephrine hyperalgesia and SIEH. Sumatriptan inhibited epinephrine SIEH and inhibited endothelin hyperalgesia and SIEH, while having no effect on epinephrine hyperalgesia or the hyperalgesia induced by a prototypical direct-acting inflammatory mediator, prostaglandin E\u2082. These results support the suggestion that triptans and \u03b2-blockers interact with the endothelial cell component of the blood vessel to produce anti-hyperalgesia.",

Oral and intravenous (IV) metoprolol was given to achieve a goal HR of <60 beats/min. Overall, 37 patients (18.5%) did not reach the goal HR despite the administration of oral (181 \u00b1 116 mg) and IV (4.2 \u00b1 9.4 mg) metoprolol. Patients with the \u03b2(1)-AR Ser49Gly or Gly49Gly genotype (n = 49) more often failed to reach an optimal HR compared to those with the Ser49Ser genotype (n = 151) (29% vs 15%, p = 0.04), despite receiving higher doses of oral (210 \u00b1 115 vs 172 \u00b1 115 mg, p = 0.048) and IV (7 \u00b1 13 vs 3 \u00b1 8 mg, p = 0.02) metoprolol.

Multivariate analysis identified \u03b2(1)-AR SNPs at codons 49 and 389 and \u03b2(2)-AR SNP at codon 27 as independent predictors of suboptimal HR response. In conclusion, these data indicate that the selected SNPs of \u03b2(1)-AR and \u03b2(2)-AR genes influence HR response to metoprolol in patients who undergo coronary computed tomographic angiography.",

Medical therapy is often prescribed, and beta-blocker therapy to reduce the stress on the aortic wall is usually recommended. However, very few clinical trials of pharmacologic therapy in humans with thoracic aortic aneurysm disease have been conducted. Mouse models have led to important discoveries and insight into the pathogenesis of aneurysm syndromes, and there is hope these may lead to effective therapy in people. Several studies are ongoing that examine the role of angiotensin receptor blockers in Marfan syndrome. Lifestyle modification is also important for patients with thoracic aortic aneurysm, including restrictions on physical activity, weight lifting, and recommendations about the management of pregnancy.

It is also available generically from several manufacturers. Propranolol hydrochloride is available as tablet, capsule, and oral liquid dosage forms in several strengths. Some patients are unable to tolerate oral tablets and capsules, challenging compounding pharmacies to seek alternative dosing options; namely oral solutions and suspensions. The objective of this study was to determine the stability of propranolol hydrochloride in SyrSpend SF. The drug was compounded into a 1-mg/mL suspension using SyrSpend SF and subsequently stored in a low-actinic plastic prescription bottle at room temperature conditions. Six samples were assayed at each specific time point extending to 90 days by a stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatography method.

    "144": "The goal of this prospective study was to examine the effects of landiolol hydrochloride on prevention of atrial fibrillation and on hemodynamics in the acute postoperative phase after heart valve surgery. The subjects were 60 patients who underwent valve surgery at our hospital from April 2008 to July 2010. The patients were randomly divided into two groups: the landiolol group (30 patients) and the control (no landiolol) group (30 patients). In the landiolol group, continuous intravenous landiolol was initiated immediately on admission to the intensive care unit at a dose of 10 \u00b5g/kg/ minute. Occurrence of atrial fibrillation was compared between the groups over an observation period of 72 hours after surgery. Atrial fibrillation occurred in 6 patients (20%) in the landiolol group and 16 (53.3%) in the control group during the observation period. Landiolol hydrochloride significantly reduced the occurrence of atrial fibrillation in the acute postoperative phase after heart valve surgery. Heart rate was significantly decreased by landiolol, but aggravation of hemodynamics was not observed. These results suggest that landiolol is a useful drug for prevention of atrial fibrillation after valve surgery.", 
    "145": "Lymphatic malformation (LM), which was previously termed lymphangioma, is a rare congenital malformation of the lymphatic system and its treatment is still challenging. Propranolol (beta blocker) has been recently developed as a first-line treatment of infantile hemangioma. Our study aimed to assess the effect of propranolol on pediatric LM and the relationship between its effectiveness and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family members (VEGF-A, C and D). Six Japanese patients with LM (age range: 10 months-19 years old; 2 macrocystic, 2 microcystic and 2 combined type) were enrolled. Oral propranolol was administered at 2 mg/kg/day. The efficacy of propranolol for LM was evaluated by the rate of volume change as calculated from MRI imaging and by symptomatic improvement. In all patients, there were no significant side effects. Patients 3 and 5 were classified as objective responders with tumor volume reduction of 30.6% and 22.9%, respectively, at 24 weeks. Patient 1 showed 8% tumor volume reduction and patient 6 showed symptomatic improvement, hence, both were classified as minimal responders. The other two patients were classified as non-responders. Plasma VEGF-A, C, and D levels were significantly higher in the LM group than in the controls (all P < 0.01 by Mann-Whitney test). VEGF-A and D levels at 24 weeks were significantly lower than those at pre-treatment (P = 0.031, 0.047 by Wilcoxon matched pairs test). Though further trials with this treatment must be carried out, we propose that propranolol may be an alternative therapy option for intractable LM.",

Carvedilol has been used in a limited number of studies examining oxidative injury. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of carvedilol on serum and tissue oxidative stress parameters in the partial unilateral ureteral obstruction (PUUO)-induced rat model. To our knowledge, the protective effects of carvedilol in the PUUO-induced rat model have not been reported. Twenty-six male Wistar albino rats, age 5.5 to 6 months and weighing 250 to 300 g, were used in this study. The rats were randomly divided into three groups. In Group 1 (n = 9), the control group, a sham operation was performed. In Group 2 (n = 8), the PUUO group, the left ureter was embedded into the psoas muscle to create PUUO and maintained for 7 days. In Group 3 (n = 9), carvedilol was orally administered to the rats (2 mg/kg). After the establishment of PUUO, carvedilol was given for the following 7 days. After partial unilateral ureteral obstruction, a nephrectomy was performed to determine the blood and tissue levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyl (PC), and nitric oxide (NO). The median SOD, MDA, PC, and NO levels in the tissues were 0.006 U/mg protein, 5.11 nmol/g protein, 4.31 nmol/mg protein, and 0.337 \u03bcmol/g protein in the control group, respectively. There was a significant increase in tissue SOD (p = 0.014), MDA (p = 0.002), and NO (p = 0.004) levels in Group 2. However, a statistically significant difference was not observed in PC (p = 0.847) enzymatic activity in Group 2. When compared with Group 2, carvedilol treatment caused a reduction in NO (p = 0.003), and PC (p = 0.001) activities in Group 3. The serum SOD (p = 0.004), MDA (p = 0.043), PC (p = 0.043), and NO (p = 0.001) levels were significantly different in Group 3 compared with Group 2. Administration of carvedilol also reduced the detrimental histopathologic effects caused by PUUO. According to histopathological examination of the renal tissues, the inflammation rates were 22.2%, 87.5% and 33.3% in Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively (p < 0.05). The results of the present study show that partial unilateral ureteral obstruction caused oxidative stress in the serum and kidney tissues of rats, and treatment with carvedilol reduced the harmful effects of ureteral obstruction.",

Solvent precipitation-ultrasonication method was opted for the preparation of CRV nanosuspension which further incorporated into the in situ gelling polymer phase. Optimized formulation was extensively characterized for various physical parameters like in situ gelation, rheological properties and in vitro drug release. Formation of in situ gel upon contact with nasal fluid was conferred via the use of ion-activated gellan gum as carrier. In vivo studies in rabbits were performed comparing the nasal bioavailability of CRV after oral, nasal, and intravenous administration. Optimized CRV nanosuspension prepared by combination of poloxamer 407 and oleic acid showed good particle size [d (0.9); 0.19\u00a0\u03bcm], zeta potential (+10.2\u00a0mV) and polydispersity (span; 0.63). The formulation containing 0.5%\u2009w/v gellan gum demonstrated good gelation ability and desired sustained drug release over period of 12\u00a0h. In vivo pharmacokinetic study revealed that the absolute bioavailability of in situ nasal spray formulation (69.38%) was significantly increased as compared to orally administered CRV (25.96%) with mean residence time 8.65\u00a0h. Hence, such in situ gel system containing drug nanosuspension is a promising approach for the intranasal delivery in order to increase nasal mucosal permeability and in vivo residence time which altogether improves drug bioavailability.",

Epinephrine elevates cyclic adenosine monophosphate in SSRBCs and increases adhesion of SSRBCs to ECs in a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor and protein kinase A-dependent manner. Studies in vitro as well as in vivo have suggested that adrenergic stimuli like epinephrine may contribute to vaso-occlusion associated with physiologic stress. We conducted both animal studies and a Phase I dose-escalation study in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients to investigate whether systemically administered propranolol inhibits SSRBC adhesion and to document the safety of propranolol in SCD. Systemically administered propranolol prevented SSRBC adhesion and associated vaso-occlusion in a mouse model. In patients receiving a single oral dose of 10, 20, or 40 mg propranolol, SSRBC adhesion to ECs was studied before and after propranolol, with and without stimulation with epinephrine. Propranolol administration significantly reduced epinephrine-stimulated SSRBC adhesion in a dose dependent manner (p = 0.03), with maximum inhibition achieved at 40 mg. Adverse events were not severe, did not show dose dependence, and were likely unrelated to drug. No significant heart rate changes occurred.

Western blotting and immunohistochemistry showed that SOPs increased the protein expression of COX-2 but not COX-1 in the endothelium. Using dihydroethidium staining and electron paramagnetic resonance spin trapping techniques, SOPs were found to elevate the level of reactive oxygen species in rat aortic endothelial cells, and the effects were reversed by antioxidants tempol, tiron, or diphenylene iodonium. Consistently, these antioxidants reversed SOPs-induced impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxation. Up-regulation of COX-2 expression by SOPs was also reversed by tempol. Moreover, SOPs attenuated nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside-induced relaxation in endothelium-intact, but not endothelium-denuded rings, confirming that SOPs act on the endothelium. Interestingly, a thromboxane-prostanoid (TP) receptor blocker S18886 reversed SOPs-impaired vasorelaxation, suggesting the involvement of TP receptor in mediating the downstream effect. SOPs decreased cGMP production, and the effect could be reversed by inhibiting COX-2 or TP receptor.",

The formulations were prepared by a direct compression method and were evaluated by in vitro dissolution studies. The results showed that sintering temperature and time of exposure greatly influenced the buoyancy, as well as the dissolution properties. As the sintering temperature and time of exposure increased, floating lag time was found to be decreased, total floating time was increased and drug release was retarded.

Isoproterenol, phenylephrine (4, 8, 16 ng each), methoxamine (8 ng), and atenolol (2, 4, 8 ng), propranolol (4, 8, 16 ng), markedly attenuated and accentuated, respectively, EIA indicating the tonic nature of modulation. The attenuation of EIA by isoproterenol is \u03b2(1)-receptor mediated because it is blocked by atenolol. Tonic \u03b2(1) modulation is functionally correlated with EIA potentiation by atenolol and propranolol. The prazosin-induced attenuation of EIA, initially thought of \u03b1(1)-receptor mediated, appeared instead \u03b2(1)-receptor modulated because of: (i) blockade by atenolol; and (ii) phosphodiesterase inhibition by prazosin. The phenylephrine/methoxamine-induced attenuation of EIA seems paradoxical as the response is similar to antagonist prazosin. However, functionally the attenuation seems \u03b2(1) receptor-mediated since atenolol blocked it but prazosin did not. Also norepinephrine (NE) attenuated EIA that was inhibited by atenolol suggesting role of \u03b2(1) receptors.

    "184": "The Nucleus of the Solitary Tract (NTS) receives gustatory and visceral information from afferent fibers in the vagus and projects to the Nucleus Paragigantocellularis (PGi), among several other brain region. PGi sends excitatory fibers, mostly glutamatergic, to the Locus Coeruleus (LC). In turn, LC sends noradrenergic projections to many areas of the brain, including hippocampus (HIPP) and amygdala. Here we show that the NTS-PGi-LC-HIPP pathway is required for the memory consolidation of object recognition (OR). The inhibition of NTS, PGi or LC by microinfusion of the GABA(A) receptor agonist, muscimol, into each of these structures up to 3h after object recognition memory training impairs its consolidation as assessed in a retention test 24h later. The posttraining microinfusion of the \u03b2-blocker, timolol into CA1 mimics this effect. Intra-CA1 NA microinfusion does not alter retention per se, but reverses the disruptive effect of muscimol given into NTS, PGi or LC. This effect of NA is shared by a microinfusion of NMDA into LC. These results support the idea that the NTS-PGi-LC-CA1 pathway contributes to memory consolidation through a \u03b2-noradrenergic mechanism in CA1.",

    "188": "Between 2000 and 2007, 8,837 patients with new onset coronary disease underwent initial CABG, and 14,516 underwent initial PCI. Patients receiving CABG were more likely than patients receiving PCI to not fill a prescription for a statin (7.1% vs. 4.8%, p < 0.0001) or for an ACEI/ARB (29.1% vs. 22.4%, p < 0.0001), but similar proportions never filled a prescription for a beta-blocker (6.4% vs. 6.1%). Among those who filled at least 1 prescription post-revascularization, patients receiving CABG had lower medication possession ratios than patients receiving PCI for ACEI/ARBs (69.4% vs. 77.8%, p < 0.0001), beta-blockers (76.1% vs. 80.6%, p < 0.0001), and statins (82.7% vs. 84.2%, p < 0.001).",

We sought to determine the minimal dose related to survival benefits by comparing the efficacy and safety of three doses of carvedilol and the best predictive parameter for effective outcomes in Japanese patients with CHF.",

    "192": "During the mean 3-year follow-up, resting heart rate (HR) and BNP were significantly reduced with dose-response relations in the early period but without dose-response relations in the late period. The LVEF and the LVDd were increased and decreased, respectively, without a dose-response relation. No significant difference was seen in the composite primary endpoint of all-cause mortality and hospitalization for cardiovascular diseases and heart failure. Multivariate analysis indicated early decreases in HR and BNP predicted long-term outcomes. However, adverse events increased dose-dependently. Among 237 polymorphisms in 87 heart failure-related genes, the osteopontin G-156 del genotype was associated with an event-free survival rate (Wilcoxon test, P=0.030).",

A near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and a near infrared spectroscopic imaging (NIRI) were used to investigate the distribution of TBR crystals in transdermal tapes. The characteristic peak derived from a first overtone of secondary amine which appears based on crystal growth was used for the detection of crystals. NIR images were composed by the integrated values of that peak at each pixel. The time-course analysis by NIRS showed that the intensity of the peaks gradually increased, and the intensity reached a plateau between day 30 and day 42 after preparation of the model tapes. The authors observed the growth and distribution of TBR crystals in small areas in several types of matrices by NIRI time-course measurement. The authors also found that a macroscopic map can provide a rough distribution map of crystalline TBR in a whole matrix. In the case in which a tape distributed from the innovator was examined, the characteristic peak was also detected through a liner or a supporting board, by transmittance-reflectance NIR measurement.",

It is significantly more common in women than in men. A definitive diagnosis of microvascular angina can be made by invasive or noninvasive methods; a presumptive diagnosis can also be made based on fulfillment of diagnostic criteria. Effective treatment of microvascular angina requires aggressive risk factor modification; exercise is one of the most effective treatment modalities. Several other treatment strategies have been shown to relieve anginal symptoms as well as improve vascular function; these include \u03b2-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, ranolazine, L-arginine, statin drugs and potentially estrogen replacement therapy. Nitrates may be effective for symptom relief. Further studies are required to determine whether specific treatments are associated with improved survival as well as decreased symptoms.",

Activation of \u03b22-AR signaling promotes proliferation associated with increased AKT, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, and endothelial NO synthase phosphorylation, upregulation of cyclin D1, and decreased levels of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2. Conversely, silencing of \u03b22-AR expression or treatment with \u03b22-antagonist ICI 118, 551 impairs CPC proliferation and survival. \u03b21-AR expression in CPC is induced by differentiation stimuli, sensitizing CPC to isoproterenol-induced cell death that is abrogated by metoprolol. Efficacy of \u03b21-AR blockade by metoprolol to increase CPC survival and proliferation was confirmed in vivo by adoptive transfer of CPC into failing mouse myocardium.",

    "200": "Slow delayed rectifier potassium current (IKs) is important in action potential (AP) repolarization and repolarization reserve. We tested the hypothesis that there are sex-specific differences in IKs, AP, and their regulation by \u03b2-adrenergic receptors (\u03b2-AR's) using whole-cell patch-clamp. AP duration (APD90) was significantly longer in control female (F) than in control male (M) myocytes. Isoproterenol (ISO, 500 nM) shortened APD90 comparably in M and F, and was largely reversed by \u03b21-AR blocker CGP 20712A (CGP, 300 nM). Inhibition of IKs with chromanol 293B (10 \u03bcM) resulted in less APD prolongation in F at baseline (3.0 vs 8.9 %, p < 0.05 vs M) and even in the presence of ISO (5.4 vs 20.9 %, p < 0.05). This suggests that much of the ISO-induced APD abbreviation in F is independent of IKs. In F, baseline IKs was 42 % less and was more weakly activated by ISO (19 vs 68 % in M, p < 0.01). ISO enhancement of IKs was comparably attenuated by CGP in M and F. After ovariectomy, IKs in F had greater enhancement by ISO (72 %), now comparable to control M. After orchiectomy, IKs in M was only slightly enhanced by ISO (23 %), comparable to control F. Pretreatment with thapsigargin (to block SR Ca release) had bigger impact on ISO-induced APD shortening in F than that in M (p < 0.01). In conclusion, we found that there are sex differences in IKs, AP, and their regulation by \u03b2-AR's that are modulated by sex hormones, suggesting the potential for sex-specific antiarrhythmic therapy.", 
    "201": "Currently, no evidence exists on the effects of beta-receptor blocker (BRB) treatment in patients with unstable severe heart failure. When confronted with this specific patient category, clinical experience in our centre has consistently guided us to lower the dose or stop BRB therapy. To share this experience, we present three clinical case scenarios and discuss background literature motivating our approach in these patients.", 
    "202": "Neuronal electrical activity has been known to affect the viability of neurons in the central nervous system. Here we show that long-lasting membrane depolarization induced by elevated extracellular K(+) recruits nitric oxide (NO)/soluble guanylyl cyclase/protein kinase G signaling pathway, induces 8-nitroguanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-nitro-cGMP)-mediated protein S-guanylation, and confers dopaminergic neuroprotection. Treatment of primary mesencephalic cell cultures with 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+)) for 72 h decreased the number of dopaminergic neurons, whereas the cell loss was markedly inhibited by elevated extracellular concentration of K(+) (+40 mM). The neuroprotective effect of elevated extracellular K(+) was significantly attenuated by tetrodotoxin (a Na(+) channel blocker), amlodipine (a voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channel blocker), N(\u03c9)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) (a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor), 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ) (a soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor), and KT5823 or Rp-8-bromo-\u03b2-phenyl-1,N(2)-ethenoguanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphorothioate (Rp-8-Br-PET-cGMPS) (protein kinase G inhibitors). Elevated extracellular K(+) increased 8-nitro-cGMP production resulting in the induction of protein S-guanylation in cells in mesencephalic cultures including dopaminergic neurons. In addition, exogenous application of 8-nitro-cGMP protected dopaminergic neurons from MPP(+) cytotoxicity, which was prevented by zinc protoporphyrin IX, an inhibitor of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Zinc protoporphyrin IX also inhibited the neuroprotective effect of elevated extracellular K(+). On the other hand, KT5823 or Rp-8-Br-PET-cGMPS did not inhibit the induction of HO-1 protein expression by 8-nitro-cGMP, although these protein kinase G inhibitors abrogated the neuroprotective effect of 8-nitro-cGMP. These results suggest that protein S-guanylation (leading to HO-1 induction) as well as canonical protein kinase G signaling pathway plays an important role in NO-mediated, activity-dependent dopaminergic neuroprotection.",

The purpose of this trial was to compare the efficacy of intravenous metoprolol versus biatrial pacing combined with oral metoprolol in the prevention of AF after CABG.", 
    "204": "A single-centre prospective randomized open trial of 165 consecutive patients undergoing their first CABG. Patients were randomized to receive either intravenous metoprolol infusion 1-3 mg per hour or biatrial overdrive pacing and oral metoprolol (50-150 mg) daily for 72 hours after CABG starting immediately after the surgery.

FMD was significantly correlated with standard deviation of normal-to-normal beats (r=0.33, P=0.022) and the power ratio of low-frequency power to high-frequency power (LF/HF; r=-0.38, P=0.0087). Furthermore, multiple regression analysis indicated that LF/HF was the most important predictor of the magnitude of FMD. This interaction was severely blunted by \u03b2-blockers and the presence of diabetes. Moreover, standardized FMD according to autonomic nervous system activity was a better predictor of future cardiovascular events than FMD. Subjects with cardiovascular events had a significantly smaller corrected FMD (event (+), 3.62\u00b10.41; event (-), 5.10\u00b12.35; P=0.001), and the higher corrected FMD was associated with longer event-free survival.",

    "210": "Review is devoted to the place of \u03b2-adrenoblockers in the treatment of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Currently, it is expedient to use cardioselective -adrenoblockers, such as bisoprolol, metoprolol succinate, carvedilol and nebivolol for the treatment of patients with CVD and COPD. Bisoprolol has the greatest (of all the cardioselective \u03b2-adrenoblockers) evidence base of data on the efficacy and safety of using in patients with COPD and CVD. While using a cardioselective \u03b2-adrenoblockers external respiration function (ERF) should be controlled. When clinical signs of worsening airway conductance appear, and adverse effects on ERF parameters are observed, \u03b2-adrenoblockers dosage should be reduced, while maintaining lower respiratory functions need to be canceled. In general, the use of cardioselective \u03b2-adrenoblockers in patients with CVD and COPD is safe, and the benefits of the drugs in this group exceed the risks of exacerbation of COPD. If possible the use of 2-agonists should be limited in patients with CVD in the treatment of COPD because of their negative impact on the cardiovascular system - the preferred use of anticholinergic drugs.",

    "212": "A novel spherical nanosilica matrix (SNM) together with chitosan (CTS) encapsulated SNM (CTS-SNM) was developed in order to investigate the feasibility of using chitosan to regulate drug release rate from porous silica and obtain an oral sustained drug delivery system. To achieve this goal, we synthesized a spherical nanosilica matrix (SNM) and incorporated chitosan chains on the SNM surface. Solvent evaporation method was adopted to load the model drug carvedilol into SNM and CTS-SNM. The physicochemical properties of the drug carriers and drug-loaded composites were systematically studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nitrogen adsorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The structural changes in CTS-SNM in simulated gastrointestinal fluid as well as the relationships between swelling effect of chitosan and in vitro drug release behaviors were investigated. Pharmacokinetic and bioavailability aspects were also discussed. The results showed that the powerful dispersing effect of SNM and the blocking action due to the swelling of chitosan were the two main factors contributing to the sustained drug release behavior. The swelling effect of chitosan in an acidic environment together with the shrinking effect in a relatively alkaline environment allowed regulation of drug release behavior in simulated gastrointestinal fluid. An in vivo study showed that the bioavailability of CAR was improved 182% compared with that of the commercial capsule when SNM was used as the drug carrier. As for CAR-CTS-SNM, the T(max) of CAR was delayed by about 3.4 h and the bioavailability was slightly increased in comparison with the commercial capsule. We believe that SNM and CTS-SNM developed in this study will help increase the use of polymers and inorganic materials in pharmaceutical applications and stimulate the design of oral drug delivery systems for immediate or sustained release of poorly water-soluble drugs.",

Through a nationwide assessment of QIs at discharge repeated for 3 years, we aimed to quantify the relationship between volume and QIs in survivors after acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "214": "Almost all healthcare centers in France participated. Medical records were randomly selected. Data collection was performed by an independent group. QIs for acute myocardial infarction were defined by an expert consensus group as appropriate prescription at discharge of aspirin, clopidogrel, \u03b2-blocker, statin, and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction <0.40. A composite QI was calculated through the use of the all-or-none method. Volume was classified into 7 categories based on the number of admissions for acute myocardial infarctions in 2008 (centers with <10 acute myocardial infarctions were excluded). Odds ratios adjusted for age and sex with 95% confidence interval for volume categories were calculated by use of logistic regression for each QI. Temporal changes were tested in centers that participated in all 3 campaigns. A total of 46 390 records were examined: 18 159 in 2008, 12 837 in 2009, and 15 394 in 2010. Two hundred ninety-one centers were eligible for the temporal analysis. There was a significant increase between 2008 and 2009 in appropriate prescription of antiplatelet agents, \u03b2-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, statins at discharge, and the composite indicator. Similarly, a significant increase was observed between 2009 and 2010 in appropriate prescription of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and \u03b2-blockers and in the composite QI. Compared with a volume of >300, a significantly lower rate of all QIs was observed in centers with the lowest volume. Odds ratios progressively decreased with increasing volume. Despite a significant increase in the composite QI over the 3 years, a significant relationship persisted between volume and quality of care.",
