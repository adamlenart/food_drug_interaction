Restoration of sinus rhythm overwhelmed the negative inotropic effect of the drug and caused full reversion to normal of the left ventricular dimensions and function.", 
    "1": "As the beta 3-adrenergic receptor (beta3AR) is resistant to short term agonist-promoted desensitization and sequestration, chimeric beta3/beta2 receptors were generated to identify the molecular determinants responsible for these regulatory processes in the beta2AR. By exchanging single or multiple intracellular domains of the beta3AR for the corresponding regions of the beta2AR, we show that specific domains can be identified as additive determinants for desensitization, while sequestration is more dependent on global structural conformation. The carboxyl-terminal tail, the third and the second intracellular loops of the beta2AR provided additive contributions to the desensitization observed upon short term agonist stimulation. The second intracellular loop plays a role which is as important as that of third cytoplasmic loop and carboxyl-terminal tail which had previously been identified as the major determinants of agonist-promoted desensitization. Additive contributions of the cytoplasmic domains of the beta2AR were also observed for agonist-promoted sequestration. The substitution of the first and second intracellular loops and the carboxyl tail were associated with a beta2-like sequestration phenotype. However, in contrast to what is observed for desensitization the co-substitution of the third cytoplasmic loop with any of the other domains completely suppressed sequestration. These results suggest that sequestration depends not only on appropriate interactions of multiple molecular determinants within the cytoplasmic region of the beta2AR but also on conformational determinants that may influence their orientation.", 
    "2": "A tonic inhibitory mechanism on heat production was studied by microinjecting procaine into various regions of the brain while recording temperature changes of the interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT) and rectum in urethane-anesthetized rats at room temperature of 23-25 degrees C. Procaine microinjected bilaterally (10%, 1.0 mu l/site, 1.5 mm to midline) into the midbrain and the upper- to mid-pontine area of the reticular formation increased temperatures of the IBAT and rectum. The highest temperature rise (1.02 +/- 0.11 degrees C for IBAT, 0.64 +/- 0.06 degrees C for rectum) with the shortest onset latency (1.5 +/- 0.3 min for IBAT, 4.6 +/- 1.1 min for rectum) was observed when procaine was injected into the lower midbrain (the area between 6 and 7 mm posterior to the bregma, and 6.5 to 8.5 mm deep from the cortical surface). These regions include the retrorubral field, pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus, and rubrospinal tract. Procaine-induced IBAT and rectal temperature increases were dose-dependent, and reproduced reliably from the same injection site of the same animal. Intravenous indomethacin, a prostaglandin H synthase inhibitor, did not affect procaine-induced temperature rise, and propranolol, a beta-blocker, completely blocked it. These results suggest that microinjected procaine exerts its local anesthetic effect and release a tonic inhibition resulting in a disinhibition-induced temperature increase through the enhanced central sympathetic outflow. They support the hypothesis that a bilateral tonic inhibitory mechanism on heat production exists in the lower midbrain.",

    "4": "1. Propranolol, a beta-blocker, inhibited or stimulated ryanodine binding to both the membrane-bound and purified ryanodine receptor (RyR) depending on the assay conditions. At high NaCl concentrations, propranolol increased the number of ryanodine-binding sites (Bmax) with no effect on the binding affinity. In the presence of 0.2 M NaCl, ryanodine binding was inhibited by propranolol. Half-maximal inhibition was obtained at 1.2 mM and complete inhibition at 2 mM propranolol. The inhibitory effect of propranolol obtained at low NaCl concentration was not restored by increasing the NaCl concentration to 1 M. 2. Modulators of the RyR that are known to alter its conformational states, such as adenine nucleotides, Ca2+ concentration and pH, modified the effect of propranolol on ryanodine binding. In the presence of propranolol and at low NaCl concentrations, ryanodine binding was inhibited and showed no Ca(2+)-, pH-, or time-dependence. 3. Propranolol immediately and completely blocked the channel opening of RyR reconstituted into a planar lipid bilayer. Propranolol-modified non-active channel was reactivated to a subconductive state (about 40% of the control conductance) by ATP. 4. Competition experiments between lidocaine (a stimulatory drug) or tetracaine (an inhibitory drug) and propranolol at 0.2 or 1.0 M NaCl, respectively, suggest the existence of different interaction sites for local anaesthetics and propranolol. 5. These results suggest that propranolol interacts directly with the RyR and modifies its ryanodine binding and single-channel activities. Propranolol effects are altered by the RyR conformational state, suggesting its possible use as a conformational probe for RyR.",

    "6": "In end-stage heart failure the expression of different myocardial regulatory proteins involved in the beta-adrenergic cAMP signalling pathway is altered. The downregulation of beta 1-adrenoceptors and their uncoupling from the effector as well as an increased expression of the inhibitory GTP-binding protein seem to be the most important alterations. Since catecholamine levels are elevated in these patients and since some alterations can be 'restored' after treatment with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists it was hypothesized that excessive beta-adrenergic stimulation could be involved in these alterations. In this article the changes of beta-adrenergic receptors, GTP-binding proteins, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase and of phospholamban found in heart failure are addressed with its possible therapeutic implications.", 
    "7": "Activation of alpha1 adrenergic receptors stimulates mitogenesis in human vascular smooth muscle cells (HVSMCs). To examine signaling pathways by which activation of alpha1 receptors may induce mitogenesis in HVSMCs, we have found that alpha1 receptor stimulated-DNA synthesis and activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase are blocked by wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). To determine directly if activation of alpha1 receptors stimulated PI 3-kinase, in vitro assays of kinase activity were performed in immunocomplexes precipitated by an antibody against the p85 alpha subunit of PI 3-kinase. Noradrenaline stimulated a time- and concentration-dependent activation of PI 3-kinase in the presence of a beta adrenergic receptor antagonist. Noradrenaline-stimulated PI 3-kinase activation was blocked by antagonists of alpha1 receptors and by pertussis toxin, suggesting that alpha1 receptors activate PI 3-kinase via a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein. Direct activation of protein kinase C by a phorbol ester did not stimulate PI 3-kinase; also, a Ca2+ L-channel blocker did not inhibit noradrenaline-stimulated PI 3-kinase activity. Increased PI 3-kinase activity was detected in both anti-Ras and anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates from noradrenaline-stimulated HVSMCs. Moreover, noradrenaline stimulated formation of active Ras-GTP complexes. Because blockade of PI 3-kinase by wortmannin inhibited formation of this complex, this result suggests that Ras might be a target of PI 3-kinase. Noradrenaline stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, and a phosphorylated tyrosine protein could be co-immunoprecipitated with anti-p85 of PI 3-kinase. These results demonstrate that stimulation of alpha1 receptors activates PI 3-kinase in HVSMCs and that alpha1 receptor-activated PI 3-kinase is associated with an increase in active Ras-GTP and activation of tyrosine protein phosphorylation. These pathways may contribute to alpha1 receptor-stimulated mitogenic responses including activation of MAP kinase and DNA synthesis in HVSMCs.", 
    "8": "Glucose stimulation raises the pHi of pancreatic beta-cells, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. We have now investigated the acute effects of metabolizable (glucose and the mitochondrial substrate alpha-ketoisocaproic acid, KIC) and nonmetabolizable (high K+ and the K-ATP channel blocker tolbutamide) insulin secretagogues on the pHi of pancreatic beta-cells isolated from normal mice, as assessed by BCECF fluorescence from single cells or islets in the presence of external bicarbonate. The typical acute effect of glucose (22-30 mM) on the pHi was a fast alkalinization of approximately 0.11 unit, followed by a slower acidification. The relative expression of the alkalinizing and acidifying components was variable, with some cells and islets displaying a predominant alkalinization, others a predominant acidification, and others yet a mixed combination of the two. The initial alkalinization preceded the [Ca2+]i rise associated with the activation of voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels. There was a significant overlap between the glucose-evoked [Ca2+]i rise and the development of the secondary acidification. Depolarization with 30 mM K+ and tolbutamide evoked pronounced [Ca2+]i rises and concomitant cytosolic acidifications. Blocking glucose-induced Ca2+ influx (with 0 Ca2+, nifedipine, or the K-ATP channel agonist diazoxide) suppressed the secondary acidification while having variable effects (potentiation or slight attenuation) on the initial alkalinization. KIC exerted glucose-like effects on the pHi and [Ca2+]i, but the amplitude of the initial alkalinization was about twice as large for KIC relative to glucose. It is concluded that the acute effect of glucose on the pHi of pancreatic beta-cells is biphasic. While the initial cytosolic alkalinization is an immediate consequence of the activation of H+-consuming metabolic steps in the mitochondria, the secondary acidification appears to originate from enhanced Ca2+ turnover in the cytoplasm. The degree of coupling between glucose metabolism and Ca2+ influx as well as the relative efficacies of these processes determines whether the acute pHi response of a beta-cell (or of a tightly coupled multicellular system such as an islet of Langerhans) is predominantly an alkalinization, an acidification, or a mixed proportion of the two.",

    "13": "An intestinal hormone glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a prominent candidate for incretin. In vitro experiment showed (Fridolf and Ahren, Mol. Cell. Endocrinol., 96 (1993) 85-90) that GLP-1 increased both insulin secretion and the efflux of 45Ca2+ in a Na(+)-dependent manner. Further, GLP-1 depolarizes the pancreatic beta cells in the presence of high concentration of glucose. Here, we report the effect of GLP-1 on the membrane potential with a physiological concentration of glucose in perforated patch clamp of primary cultured rat beta cells. 10 nM GLP-1 depolarized the beta cell, which was completely reversed by replacing Na+ with the impermeant molecule N-methyl-D-glucamine (NMDG). The Ca2+ channel blocker, Co2+ suppressed the Ca2+ spikes without hyperpolarizing the cell. GLP-1-induced insulin secretion in perifused islets was also suppressed by a prior replacement of Na+ with NMDG. In addition, GLP-1 slightly augmented the long-lasting Ba2+ current, which was reverted to the control level by a selective inhibitor of protein kinase A, H-89. These results indicate: (i) GLP-1 depolarizes the beta cell by activating the membrane Na+ permeability; (ii) GLP-1 slightly modulates the L-type Ca2+ channel probably through protein kinase A; and (iii) at least in part, these mechanisms may be involved in the insulin secretion induced by GLP-1.",

    "18": "Nebivolol hydrochloride (R067555), is a new antihypertensive drug. Aromatic and alicyclic hydroxylation at the benzopyran ring systems of nebivolol are important metabolic pathways. Generally, NMR is used to unambiguously assign the sites of hydroxylation. Because of the low dose rates and the extensive metabolism of nebivolol in the different species, NMR identification is not always possible, and therefore another spectroscopic technique was searched for to address this problem. UV-chromophore absorption is affected by the kind and arrangement of adjacent atoms and groups (auxochromes). The effect of these auxochromes (e.g. -NH2, -NR2, -SH, -OH, -OR and halogens) can be strongly influenced by the pH. This paper proves that HPLC at high pH combined with on-line diode-array detection is an excellent technique for the location of the hydroxyl functions in hydroxylated metabolites of nebivolol. With this technique it is possible to differentiate between glucuronidation at the automatic and aliphatic or alicyclic hydroxyl functions.", 
    "19": "Eight days' desipramine administration (16 mg/kg per day i.p.) to rats resulted in a significant decrease in the density of beta-adrenoceptors in neuronal and astroglial cells from rat forebrain and cerebellum without modification of their corresponding affinity. beta-Adrenoceptor subtypes, beta 1 and beta 2, which coexist in neurons and astrocytes, are differently distributed in the brain and differently modified by desipramine administration which down-regulates beta 1-adrenoceptor in forebrain neurons and astrocytes and beta 2-adrenoceptor in cerebellum neurons. This down-regulation affects the predominant subtype, beta 1 or beta 2, of the relevant structure. Astroglial and neuronal beta-adrenoceptors are differently coupled to G-proteins. Only neuronal cells contain the high-affinity conformational state of the beta-adrenoceptors which is sensitive to GTP. The percentage of neuronal receptors in the high-affinity state differs according to brain area. Desipramine treatment decreases the neuronal density of both cerebellar high- and low-affinity sites and only the forebrain high-affinity site. The desipramine effects are thus subtype-dependent and differ between the two brain areas selected.", 
    "20": "We recently reported that a beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta2AR) mutant, Y326A, defective in its ability to sequester in response to agonist stimulation was a poor substrate for G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK)-mediated phosphorylation; however, its ability to be phosphorylated and sequestered could be restored by overexpressing GRK2 [Ferguson et al. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 24782]. In the present report, we tested the ability of each of the known GRKs (GRK1-6) to phosphorylate and rescue the sequestration of the Y326A mutant in HEK-293 cells. We demonstrate that in addition to GRK2, GRK3-6 can phosphorylate the Y326A mutant and rescue its sequestration; however, GRK1 was totally ineffective in rescuing either the phosphorylation or the sequestration of the mutant receptor. We found that the agonist-dependent rescue of Y326A mutant phosphorylation by GRK2, -3, and -5 was associated with the agonist-dependent rescue of sequestration. In contrast, overexpression of GRK4 and -6 led mainly to agonist-independent phosphorylation of the Y326A mutant accompanied by increased basal receptor sequestration. Our results demonstrate that phosphorylation per se, but not the interaction with a specific GRK, is required to facilitate beta2AR sequestration.", 
    "21": "We have previously demonstrated that prolonged simulated microgravity (tail-suspension) leads to cardiac alterations with increased resting heart rate, myocardial degradation changes and attenuated myocardial contractility. The present study investigated the potential role of adrenoceptor mechanisms underlying them. Changes of myocardial alpha 1-adrenoceptor (alpha 1-AR) and beta 1-adrenoceptor (beta-AR) in 90-day tail-suspended rats was investigated by the method of radioligand binding assay and application of Scatchard's method. The results showed significantly decreased quantity of specific binding of 125I-BE[2-beta-(4-hydroxy-3-[125I]indophenyl)-ethylaminomethyltetralone] to alpha 1-AR present in membrane derived from ventricular myocardium of the suspended animals, despite the affinity of the alpha 1-AR to 125I-Be was unchanged. But neither the quantity nor the affinity of beta-AR binding to 125I-Pindolol was significantly altered. In addition, the spontaneously beating rate of isolated right atria from tail-suspended animals showed little change in sensitivity and reactivity to the stimulations of graded phenylephrine (alpha-agonist, measured in the presence of beta-antagonist propranolol) and isoproterenol (beta-agonist), compared with the control rats. There were also no obvious differences of the effects of the isoproterenol on the contractility of isolated left ventricular papillary muscles between the two groups. Since myocardial alpha 1-AR mediated-effects include production of cardiac hypertrophy and enhancement of myocardial glucose uptake and glycolysis, the down-regulation of the alpha 1-AR may be a contributor to the cardiac cellular accumulation and the myocardial degradation changes as found in our tail-suspended rats. The data from this study also suggest that the myocardial beta-adrenoceptors are not affected by the prolonged tail-suspension.", 
    "22": "Extracellular recordings were made from 176 spontaneous discharging units in the arcuate nucleus of rat hypothalamic slices. Depending on the patterns of discharge, the units were divided into three types; slow irregular (76%), fast continuous (26.5%) and phasic units (6.3%). The effect of 5-HT on the different types of units were observed. The results indicated that most of neurons were inhibited by 5-HT, and only a small portion of the cells showed excitation and a few of the slow irregular units showed \"excitation after inhibition\". With 5-HT 10(-6) mol/L we found that 12 units inhibited by 5-HT could not be reversed by CHD, while the 4 inhibited units could be partly or completely reversed by MSG. 4 of the 7 neurons inhibited by 5-HT were partly blocked by Pindobind-5-HT1A but not for the remaining 3 neurons. The results suggest that the inhibitory effect of 5-HT on arcuate neurons may be mediated by 5-HT1 receptor, while some by 5-HT1A receptor.", 
    "23": "Studies were performed to determine whether 1) histamine can modify the spontaneous activity of mammalian intrinsic cardiac neurons in situ, 2) histamine-sensitive neurons exist in intrathoracic intrinsic cardiac and extracardiac ganglia that are involved in cardiac regulation, and 3) histamine-sensitive intrathoracic cardiac neurons possess H1 or H2 receptors. histamine (10 microliters; 100 microM), when applied adjacent to spontaneously active canine right atrial neurons in situ, increased ongoing activity in some of them. Histamine, when administered into the local arterial blood supply of these neurons (0.1 ml; 100 microM) not only increased their activity but induced cardiac augmentation. Cardioaugmentor responses were also elicited when histamine (10 microliters or 0.1 ml; 100 microM) was administered into limited loci within stellate and middle cervical ganglia that were connected to the heart, but not in ganglia surgically disconnected the heart. Neuronal and cardiac responses no longer were elicited after local administration of the H1-selective receptor antagonist triprolidine. They were unaffected by local application of the H2-selective receptor antagonist cimetidine. No cardiac augmentation was elicited when histamine was applied to intrathoracic autonomic neurons following timolol (1 mg/kg i.v.) administration. These data indicate that 1) histaminergic neurons exist in intrinsic cardiac and intrathoracic extracardiac ganglia that are involved in cardiac regulation, 2) these neurons possess H1 receptors, and 3) histamine-sensitive intrathoracic neurons directly or indirectly activate cardiac adrenergic neurons, thereby inducing cardiac augmentation", 
    "24": "Left ventricular (LV) volume (V) is an essential parameter for assessment of the cardiac pump function. Measurement of LVV in situ by a conductance catheter method has been widely used in dogs and humans but not yet in small experimental animals such as rats. We instituted a miniaturized six-electrode conductance catheter (3-F) for rat LVV measurement and its signal processing apparatus. We compared stroke volumes (SVs) simultaneously measured with this conductance catheter introduced into the LV through the apex and an electromagnetic flow probe placed on the ascending aorta during gradual decreases in LVV by an inferior vena caval occlusion. A high and linear correlation (r = 0.982) was obtained between these differently measured by SVs pooled from six rats. In another group of three rats, LV pressure was simultaneously measured with a 3-F catheter-tip micromanometer introduced into the LV through the apex. We obtained the slope of the end-systolic pressure-volume (P-V) relationship (Emax) by a gradual ascending aortic occlusion. After administration of propranolol, Emax obviously decreased with no change in volume intercept of the P-V relationship. The conductance volumetry proved to be useful in rats.",

    "26": "beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-ARs) were identified in CG-5 breast cancer cells using a radiometric assay. The total beta-AR concentration was measured using the highly potent beta-adrenergic antagonist (-)[3H]CGP 12177, and the densities of beta-AR subtypes were discriminated in the presence of highly selective unlabelled ligands (CGP 20712A and ICI 118551). Scatchard analysis revealed good linearity (r > 0.95) and Kd values (0.05-1 nM) indicated the presence of high affinity binding sites in CG-5 cell membranes. beta 2-AR concentrations (74%) were significantly (P < 0.05) higher than beta 1-AR concentrations (36%). Displacement studies indicated that tested adrenergic agonists displaced (-) [3H]CGP 12177 from its specific binding sites in the order of potency (-)isoproterenol > (+/-)clenbuterol > (-)adrenaline > (+/-)dobutamine > > (-)noradrenaline, whereas beta-adrenergic antagonists inhibited the binding in the following order of potency: (-)propranolol > > ICI 118 551 > > CGP 20712A. The functionality of beta-ARs identified in CG-5 cell membranes was demonstrated by the significant increase in cAMP production induced by different concentrations of isoproterenol vs unstimulated cells (control). The pathophysiological role of beta-ARs in breast cancer cells is still undefined, but their presence suggests the possible adrenergic regulation of some cellular activities such as proliferation and/or differentiation.", 
    "27": "This study attempted to evaluate the efficacy of several \"long-acting\" antihypertensive agents. One-hundred consecutive hypertensive subjects with normal casual blood pressure after once-daily antihypertensive monotherapy treatment were studied. They were divided into three groups: group A, metoprolol (100 mg, daily); group B, atenolol (100 mg, daily); and group C, nadolol (80 mg, daily). Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) was used to evaluate the efficacy of the antihypertensive agents. The overall average ambulatory blood pressures were within the normal limits for all three groups. However, there were some abnormally high blood pressure (BP) readings shown on ABPM. Patients with an abnormally high systolic blood pressure (SBP) average > 140 mmHg accounted for 16.7% of group A, 19.4% of group B and 20% of group C. Those with an abnormally high diastolic blood pressure (DBP) average > 90 mmHg accounted for 16.7%, 19.4% and 10%, respectively, of the corresponding groups. There were no significant differences in the frequency of abnormally high SBP and DBP among the three groups. These \"long-acting\" antihypertensive drugs did not effectively control BP throughout the entire day. The duration of antihypertensive effect is not necessarily reflected by the blood half-life of the drug. ABPM is an effective way to ascertain the efficacy of \"long-acting\" hypertensive agents.", 
    "28": "The pharmacological properties of the native human beta 3-adrenoceptor are poorly defined. In the present study, the agonist and antagonist properties of beta 3-adrenoceptors in human omental and mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes were compared by measuring lipolysis in the absence or presence of adrenoceptor blockers. Methodological experiments revealed that all three beta-adrenoceptors were functionally expressed in both types of adipocytes. This makes the human and the mouse cells directly comparable in pharmacological studies. CGP 12177 was a selective partial beta 3-adrenoceptor agonist in both cell types with a pD(2) of about 7.5. The order of potency of classical non-selective adrenoceptor agonists, when determined during blockade of beta 1-, beta 2- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors, was isoprenaline>noradrenaline>adrenaline in both human and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. This is different from the order of potency of the same agonists at the beta 1- or beta 2-adrenoceptors. The sensitivity of the beta 3-adrenoceptor to these catecholamines, expressed as pD(2) values, were virtually identical in both adipocyte types. Isoprenaline, noradrenaline, and adrenaline were almost full agonists in both cell types (intrinsic activity from 74% or 95%) during combined beta 1, beta 2- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor blockade. Antagonist potencies (expressed as pA(2) and using CGP 12177 as agonist) at the alpha 3-adrenoceptor were similar in both adipocyte types: bupranolol>propranolol>metoprolol. The corresponding pA(2) values for bupranolol, propanolol and metoprolol were about 7, 6 and 5, respectively in both species. In conclusion, the pharmacological properties of classical catecholamines, beta-adrenoceptor blockers and CGP 12177 are almost identical at the beta 3-adrenoceptors of human omental adipocytes and 3T3-L1 adipocytes.", 
    "29": "Decreased heart rate variability, which may be due to increased sympathetic and decreased parasympathetic activity, has been shown to be predictor of cardiac events after acute myocardial infarction. The present study was undertaken to analyze the effect of beta adrenergic blockade on cardiac autonomic system in patients with chronic stable angina. Nineteen patients (15 males and 4 females, age range 44-74 years) with chronic stable angina were enrolled. After stopping all cardiac medications, patients had two baseline treadmill tests with both reproducible angina and ST depression and a baseline 48-hour ambulatory ECG recording. A long-acting beta-blocker (atenolol or betaxolol) was started and titrated to the maximal tolerated dose. After 1-2 months, a repeat 48-hour ambulatory ECG recording on beta-blocker therapy was obtained. Heart rate variability analysis was performed on the baseline and drug therapy ECG recordings. The average heart rate significantly decreased (P < 0.008), and the mean RR interval significantly increased (P < 0.0001). In the time-domain analysis, the standard deviation, variance, ASDNN5, and SDANN5 were not significantly affected, although the PNN50 increased. In the frequency domain, the total power (P < 0.0001) and the low frequency (P < 0.001) components decreased, while the high frequency spectrum was unchanged. Thus, sympathetic activity significantly declined in patients with chronic stable angina on beta-blocker therapy, while parasympathetic tone demonstrated a heterogenous response.",

The following parameters were recorded: action potential amplitude (APA), resting membrane potential (RMP), AP duration at 95 and 50% of repolarization (APD95, APD50), maximal upstroke velocity (V(max)), and effective refractory period (ERP) at a cycle length of 1 Hz. The measured AP parameters did not differ in dil CMP and CAD. APD50, APD95, and ERP were significantly prolonged at Dof concentration > or = 10(-7) M and at D-Sot concentrations > or = 10(-4) M. No effects were observed on RMP, APA, or V(max). The AP characteristics of dil CMP and CAD did not differ. The data demonstrate class III effects of Dof and D-Sot on endocardial AP of diseased human ventricular myocardium. As compared with those of D-Sot, the effects of Dof on APD and ERP were similar but were obtained with lower concentrations.",

In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the pressor effect of insulin in SHR is medicated by sympathetic nervous system overactivity. Male SHR (7 weeks old) were given daily subcutaneous injection of insulin or vehicle for 3 days, after which each rat received an intravenous infusion of the peripheral ganglionic blocker hexamethonium. Two days later, in a second experiment, the infusion protocol was repeated with the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine, which more selectively inhibits sympathetic (as compared with parasympathetic) nervous system activity. Insulin treatment for 3 days caused a significant increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP; 164 +/- 2 mm Hg vs. saline control 148 +/- 3 mm Hg), but ganglionic blockade with hexamethonium eliminated the difference in blood pressure (BP) between the insulin-treated and control SHR. Infusion of clonidine significantly reduced MAP in the insulin-treated group to the level of the untreated control SHR, but the infusion did not reduce MAP in the latter group. In a second group of rats, acute administration of prazosin also eliminated the difference in MAP between insulin-treated and control SHR. We conclude that in SHR the sympathetic nervous system contributes importantly to the pressor effect of insulin administration and that this effect may be mediated by the central nervous system.", 
    "32": "Low density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation plays a crucial role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis and is enhanced in patients with essential hypertension. This finding has stimulated a search for antihypertensive drugs with high intrinsic antioxidant properties. We investigated the antihypertensive and antioxidant effects of carvedilol, a new vasodilating beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent in a group of patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension after 4-month treatment. Carvedilol administration markedly increased the resistance to oxidation of LDL isolated from treated patients to values comparable to those of control, nonhypertensive subjects. This effect was achieved despite a significant loss in LDL-associated vitamin E. The increased resistance of LDL to oxidation promoted by carvedilol was not related to the normalization of previously increased blood pressure (BP). Indeed, the administration of other conventional antihypertensive drugs, capable of decreasing arterial BP but without high intrinsic antioxidant properties, to a control group of matched hypertensive patients failed to ameliorate LDL oxidation parameters. Carvedilol treatment also reduced the extent of in vivo LDL oxidation, as reflected by the decrease in antioxidized LDL autoantibody titer. This effect as well was detected only in the group of carvedilol-treated hypertensive patients and not after the simple reduction in BP obtained with antihypertensive drugs different from carvedilol.", 
    "33": "The purpose of our work was to evaluate the role of bradykinin B2 receptors in the early phase (first 3 h) of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced shock in anesthetized and mechanically ventilated rabbits and to determine if HOE 140, a specific, potent, and long-acting bradykinin B2-receptor antagonist, could improve survival in two murine models of septic shock. In rabbits, LPS injection induced rapid hypotension associated with metabolic acidosis. Three hours after the injection of LPS, we observed leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and a moderate increase in arterial blood cyclic GMP. The injection-of HOE 140 [1.7-mumol/kg bolus intravenously (i.v.) 20 min before LPS] inhibited the decrease in blood pressure, but did not influence any of the other parameters studied. Mice were subjected to intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of LPS, which induced almost 100% mortality in the 4 days after the injection. Pretreatment with HOE 140 (1 mg/kg i.p.) 30 min before the LPS injection and 4, 8, and 24 h afterward the injection did not improve survival at any given time during the 4 days of the study. Cecal ligation and puncture in mice induced a mortality rate > 90% in < or = 10 days. HOE 140 (1 mg/kg i.v.) given 30 min before cecal ligation did not significantly improve the survival rate. In contrast with previous reports, in the present study in a rabbit model of endotoxic shock (early phase) and in two murine models of septic shock, the involvement of bradykinin B2 receptors appeared to be minimal.", 
    "34": "The objective of the present study was to validate a transonic flowmeter system with two probes (model 3SS for cardiac output (CO) and 1RB for organ flows) in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats first by measuring blood flow through pump-infused isolated renal artery and ascending aorta, and then through measurements of CO and renal, mesenteric, and hindquarter blood flow (RBF, MBF, HBF) in vivo. We measured in vivo baseline flow and changes in flow induced by dopamine and propranolol for CO, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and angiotensin II (AII) for RBF and pentobarbital sodium for MBF and HBF. Correlations between meter and pump flow were linear (r = 0.999, p < 0.001) with close agreement both in ascending aorta and renal artery flow measurements. The baseline values were 15 +/- 0.7 ml/100 g/min for CO, 4 +/- 0.1 ml/100 g/min for RBF, 7 +/- 0.3 ml/100 g/min for MBF, and 6 +/- 0.3 ml/100 g/min for HBF, respectively. The system reliably detected increase and/or decrease in CO and regional blood flows. The transonic flowmeter system is accurate, highly reproducible, and compatible with other established techniques for measuring CO and regional blood flows in the rat.", 
    "35": "1. Tetrazepam (TZP) suppressed rat and guinea-pig tracheal tone by 100% and there was no difference in the relaxant effects against tone induced by 120 mM K+, carbachol (0.5 microM) or histamine (100 microM). 2. In trachealis pretreated with propranolol (1 microM), the relaxant response to TZP was unaltered. 3. TZP (10 microM) added to the relaxant effect of isoprenaline in tissues precontracted with carbachol. 4. The relaxant effect of TZP appears to be unrelated to peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs) because pretreatment with PK 11195 (1 microM) did not modify its effect. 5. Diltiazem (a calcium antagonist) was capable of relaxing the KCl (120 mM) or carbachol (0.5 microM) precontracted trachea, although at a different dose range than that of TZP. 6. The tracheal relaxation by TZP may be due to competition at some point in the chain of events linking carbachol, K+ or histamine to contraction, interacting with one of the transduction pathways, probably Ca2+. This inhibition of contraction is not related to the high-affinity PBRS.", 
    "36": "1. The acute (6h) exposure of guinea-pigs to white noise (110 dB) as a stress stimulus, reduced bronchial reactivity to acetylcholine (Ach) (3-1000 micrograms kg-1 i.v.) in anaesthetized animals. 2. The hyporesponsiveness to Ach in stressed animals was not confirmed in vitro on tracheal preparations (Ach 1 x 10(-9)-1 x 10(-4) g ml-1) and disappeared in vivo when the animals were sensitized with ovalbumin (OA, 100 mg kg-1 i.p. + 100 mg kg-1 s.c.). The hyporesponsiveness was also absent in ovalbumin sensitized guinea-pigs exposed to an aerosol of ovalbumin 60 min before testing with Ach. 3. In non-sensitized guinea-pigs, pretreatment with butoxamine (1 mg kg-1 i.v.) or with theophylline (25 mg kg-1 i.v.), completely abolished the effect of noise-exposure. In contrast, pretreatment with L-NG-nitro-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 10 mg kg-1 i.v.), alpha-chymotrypsin (2 U kg-1 i.v.) or with enprofylline (10 mg kg-1 i.v.), did not affect it. 4. In conclusion, our experiments reveal inhibitory mechanisms upon Ach-induced bronchoconstriction activated by a stress stimulus and this is absent in sensitized animals. These mechanisms seem to be linked to the adrenergic beta 2-receptors and a role for the purinergic system (via A-receptors) may also be present.", 
    "37": "Studies have shown that the noradrenergic system is involved in the analgesic effects of opioids and in the expression and development of physical signs of opioid withdrawal. The purpose of the present experiment was to determine if the noradrenergic system was involved in the discriminative effects of morphine in rats trained to discriminate 5.6 mg/kg morphine from saline under a fixed-ratio schedule of food presentation. A range of doses of morphine (0.3-10.0 mg/kg) produced dose-dependent increases in morphine-appropriate responding without substantial decreases in response rate. Several experiments were conducted to determine whether a number of noradrenergic agonists and antagonists 1) substitute for morphine or 2) alter the discriminative-stimulus effects of morphine when administered concurrently. The alpha 2 agonist clonidine (0.003-0.1 mg/kg), the alpha 1 antagonist prazosin (0.1-10.0 mg/kg), the alpha 2 antagonist yohimbine (0.1-10.0 mg/kg), the beta 2 agonist salbutamol (0.03-10.0 mg/kg), and the beta antagonist propranolol (1.0-10.0 mg/kg), neither substituted for morphine nor altered the discriminative-stimulus effects of morphine when administered in combination. These data suggest that the noradrenergic system is not involved in the discriminative-stimulus effects of 5.6 mg/kg morphine in rats.", 
    "38": "Ibogaine, an indole alkaloid with proposed antiaddictive properties, has structural similarity to serotonin and has been shown to have affinity to the kappa-opioid binding site. In addition to the dopamine system, the serotonin system is a major target for cocaine action and the opioid system can affect the serotonin system. Therefore, the present study examined the effect of ibogaine on cocaine-induced, electrically evoked efflux of [3H]dopamine and [3H]serotonin from striatal tissue incubated in vitro, and their modulation by the kappa-opioid system. Cocaine (10(-6) M) added in vitro increased tthe fractional efflux of both [3H]dopamine (FRS2/FRS1 = 2.42 +/- 0.36) and [3H]serotonin (FRS2/FRS1 = 1.31 +/- 0.06). Mice treated in vivo with ibogaine (40 mg/kg or 2 times 40 mg/kg, IP) and killed 2 or 18 h later still showed the cocaine-induced increase in [3H]dopamine, but [3H]serotonin efflux was not increased. The 5-HTIB agonist CGS-12066A (10(-6) M, added in vitro) increased [3H]dopamine release, but did not alter cocaine-induced efflux of [3H]dopamine. CGS-12066A did not affect [3H]serotonin release, but the cocaine-induced increase in [3H]serotonin was inhibited. CGS-12066A (1 mg/kg, SC) potentiated cocaine (25 mg/kg, SC)-induced locomotor activity. Ibogaine pretreatment reduced both the cocaine and the CGS-12066A cocaine-induced increase in locomotor activity. The kappa-opioid agonist U-62066 (10(-6) M, added in vitro) reduced both [3H] dopamine and [3H]serotonin release. This inhibitory effect was blocked by in vivo administration ibogaine. U-62066 did not alter cocaine-induced [3H]dopamine efflux, but reduced cocaine-induced [3H]serotonin efflux. In striatal tissue from ibogaine-pretreated mice, U-62066 restored the cocaine-induced increase in [3H]serotonin release. U-62066 (1 mg/kg, SC) potentiated cocaine-induced behavior and maintained an increased locomotor activity after ibogaine treatment. The results suggest that ibogaine may block the cocainemediated effects on serotonergic transmission, that subsequently modulate dopamine release. The kappa-opioid modulation of serotonergic transmission is also involved.", 
    "39": "Possible involvement of catecholamine receptor activities in modulating the incidence of yawning, which involves activation of dopaminergic-cholinergic linked neuronal mechanism, was investigated in rats. Subcutaneous injection of talipexole (B-HT 920), a selective dopamine D2-receptor-agonist, elicited yawning behavior. This behavior was increased by prazosin and bunazosin, alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists, and by pindolol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist. The yawning induced by physostigmine, an anticholinesterase agent, and pilocarpine, a direct muscarinic receptor agonist, was increased by pindolol, but was unaffected by prazosin and bunazosin. In addition, the yawning induced by the dopaminergic agonists, but not by the cholinergic agonists, was markedly suppressed by ST587, an alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist. All the yawning responses to dopaminergic and cholinergic agents were reduced not only by scopolamine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist, but also by idazoxan, rauwolscine, and yohimbine, alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists. The results suggest that catecholamine receptor activities seem to play different roles in inhibitory modulation of the occurrence of yawning caused by dopaminergic and cholinergic stimulation.", 
    "40": "AM 92016 (1-(4-methanesulphonamidophenoxy)- 3-(N-methyl-3-4-dichlorophenethylamino)-2-propanol benzoic acid salt), an oxypropanolamine analogue of sotalol, has been shown to possess Class III anti-arrhythmic properties in-vitro at concentrations showing 1000 times more potency than sotalol. The aim of this study was to characterize the effects of AM 92016 in-vivo. When administered to anaesthetized guinea-pigs, AM 92016 (10 micrograms kg-1 -5 mg kg-1) significantly increased heart rate, systolic arterial blood pressure, left ventricular systolic pressure and the contractile index dp dtmax. AM 92016 also significantly decreased the QT interval of the electrocardiogram from 135 +/- 10 to 105 +/- 4 ms (5 mg kg-1). The time to onset of the first arrhythmia and ventricular fibrillation, induced by intravenous infusion of ouabain, was shortened in the presence of AM 92016. Ouabain-induced ventricular fibrillation occurred at 18 +/- 5 and 12 +/- 3 min (P < 0.05) in control and AM 92016-(1 mg kg-1) treated guinea-pigs, respectively. An infusion of AM 92016 (2.5 micrograms kg-1 min-1) to anaesthetized pigs significantly increased the total number of arrhythmias occurring following coronary artery occlusion from 266 +/- 26 in control pigs to 535 +/- 148 (P < 0.05) in those receiving AM 92016. The time to onset of ventricular fibrillation was also significantly reduced in anaesthetized pigs from 24 +/- 1 to 18 +/- 3 min in the presence of AM 92016. The drug did not change haemodynamics in the anaesthetized pig. We conclude that AM 92016 exhibited proarrhythmic rather than antiarrhythmic activity when administered in-vivo to either guinea-pigs or pigs.", 
    "41": "Propranolol, a beta-adrenoceptor blocker, suffers from a high degree of first-pass metabolism resulting in very low bioavailability (< 10%) following administration with conventional oral formulations. To circumvent this significant therapeutic hurdle, we formulated a carboxymethylcellulose-sodium (CMC-Na) based transdermal system for propranolol and evaluated the patch for its in-vitro and in-vivo performance. In-vitro permeation studies using the excised hair-free rat skin model resulted in 66.54% permeation at the end of 24 h in a modified Franz diffusion cell. This zero-order permeation profile was characterized by a drug permeation rate of 52.87 +/- 11.63 micrograms cm-2 h-1. Skin irritation studies in rats (n = 5), evaluated for flare-and-wheal with respect to a formalin control, indicated that the drug-containing patch evoked only a mild response over a 7-day period. Preliminary in-vivo studies in male albino rabbits (n = 3), indicated that plasma drug levels averaged 11.75 +/- 3.40 ng mL-1 in a 24-h study period before patch removal.", 
    "42": "In proestrous rats, serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) receptor agonists inhibit lordosis behavior within 5-15 min following infusion into the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMN). In the present report, the lordosis-inhibiting effects of the 5-HT1A agonist [(+/-) 8-hydroxy-2- (di-n-propylamino) tetralin) (8-OH-DPAT] were shown to be attenuated with 5-HT1A receptor antagonists. Two compounds, propranolol and pindolol, that function as both beta-adrenergic and 5-HT1A receptor antagonists, and (+) WAY100135 (chiral N-t-butyl-3-(1-(4-(2-methoxy) phenyl)piperazinyl)-1-phenylpropionamide dihydrochloride, quarter hydrate), a more selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, were found to reduce the lordosis-inhibiting effects of 8-OH-DPAT infusion into the VMN. Proestrous rats were co-infused into the VMN with 200 ng 8-OH-DPAT plus 1000 ng or 2000 ng pindolol, 1000 ng or 2000 ng propranolol, or 2000 ng (+) WAY100135. Co-infusion with 1000 ng or 2000 ng pindolol attenuated the inhibitory effects of 8-OH-DPAT; co-infusion of 1000 ng, but not 2000 ng, propranolol, reduced the effects of 8-OH-DPAT; and co-infusion with 2000 ng (+) WAY100135 attenuated the effects of 8-OH-DPAT. Bilateral VMN infusion with 2500 ng (+) WAY100135 facilitated lordosis behavior in suboptimally, hormone-primed ovariectomized rats. These findings strengthen the argument that the inhibitory effect of 5-HT1A receptor agonists on lordosis behavior is the result of their activation of VMN 5-HT1A receptors.", 
    "43": "A 43-year-old female showing signs and symptoms of subacute thyroiditis was referred to our hospital for further evaluation of her thyroid function because TSH-binding inhibitor immunoglobulins (TBII) were detected in her serum. A diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis was made based on high levels of thyroid hormones with suppressed TSH level, suppressed radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU), and positive inflammatory findings and ultrasonogram results. She was at first thyrotoxic, then transiently hypothyroid, and finally became euthyroid. The assay results for TBII and thyroid-stimulation blocking antibodies (TSBAb) were positive in the thyrotoxic phase, and the TBII and TSBAb activities were decreased and finally became undetectable during the course of her illness. In contrast, the assay results for thyroid-stimulating antibodies (TSAb) were negative throughout the investigation period. The presence of TSBAb may have induced the development of hypothyroidism because she became euthyroid after the disappearance of TSBAb from the serum, but the duration of the hypothyroid phase was the same as that in typical cases of subacute thyroiditis. Inflammatory or destructive changes in the thyroid gland are thought to be involved in the production of the TSH-receptor antibodies in the patient.", 
    "44": "Effective treatment of heart failure depends on a correct functional and aetiological diagnosis. In asymptomatic patients with cardiac dysfunction following myocardial infarction, treatment is directed to prevent recurrent infarction by aggressive lipid lowering with statins and antiplatelet drugs. Beta blockers are important to reduce sudden death. In symptomatic heart failure, clinical improvement is obtained by inhibition of the renin-angiotensin and sympathetic system. Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors in combination with diuretics reduce morbidity and mortality caused by progression of the myocardial dysfunction and recurrent myocardial infarction. Drugs that activate the neurohormonal systems are clearly counteractive. Digitalis has a definite favourable effect on systems, and in patients with atrial fibrillation, but its effect on mortality is still unsettled. Beta blockers in routine treatment of symptomatic heart failure still remains controversial, but may benefit selected patients.", 
    "45": "The authors analysed survival of 160 patients (121 men and 31 women; average age 57.2 +/- 12.5 years; follow-up 29 +/- 20 months) treated for malignant ventricular arrhythmias (sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, syncope with inducible ventricular tachycardia). The therapeutic evaluation was frequently invasive (145 patients underwent at least programmed ventricular stimulation, 108 patients underwent full endocavitary electrophysiological studies) and non-pharmacological therapy was widely used (defibrillator n = 44; antiarrhythmic surgery n = 28; ablative procedures n = 19; transplantation n = 7). The following underlying pathologies were observed: ischaemic heart disease n = 120; non-ischaemic left heart disease n = 19; right heart cardiac disease n = 4; and apparently normal hearts n = 17). The average ejection fraction was 40.5 +/- 15.5% and 29 patients were in the NYHA functional classes III or IV. Fifty-five patients had life-threatening arrhythmias whilst receiving amiodarone. At 2 years, the actuarial sudden death rate was 5.9 +/- 2.1% and the actuarial total cardiac mortality rate was 13.1 +/- 2.9%. Univariate analysis showed age, the presence of underlying cardiac disease, the presence of dilated cardiomyopathy, the absence of an invasive approach, the need for basal pacing in electrical cardioversion, the absence of betablocker therapy, a decreased left ventricular ejection fraction and a high NYHA functional class, to be predictive of sudden death. In multivariate analysis, age, the NYHA class for total cardiac mortality and the NYHA class for sudden death, were the only independent predictive factors. The authors conclude that in the era of invasive methods of evaluation and widespread use of non-pharmacological therapeutic methods, the symptomatology of cardiac failure assessed by the NYHA classification remains the most powerful independent prognostic factor after an episode of malignant ventricular arrhythmia.",

    "50": "The two groups did not differ in age, sex, body mass index, blood pressure or lipids, and treatment effectively lowered blood pressure. In both groups, insulin sensitivity was impaired at baseline. After metoprolol treatment, insulin sensitivity further decreased significantly by about 14%, whereas it increased after carvedilol. There was also a decrease in high-density lipoprotein and an increase in triglycerides levels in patients in the metoprolol-treated group, whereas these parameters remained unchanged in patients in the carvedilol-treated group.", 
    "51": "This study confirms previous findings of a reduction in insulin sensitivity after chronic metoprolol treatment. Carvedilol treatment, however, resulted in a small amelioration of insulin resistance and a better lipid profile [corrected]. We thus demonstrate that a beta-blocker with alpha 1-blocking properties has favorable effects on glucose metabolism, suggesting a potentially important role of peripheral blood flow in regulating glucose uptake. These findings imply that beta-blocker treatment, when combined with alpha 1-blocking activity has advantageous effects on insulin sensitivity and lipids and could therefore be suitable for patients with the metabolic syndrome.", 
    "52": "The aim of this study was to assess the influence of sotalol hydrochloride on time- and frequency-domain parameters of signal-averaged electrocardiogram (SAECG) in patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD). The study population consisted of 25 patients (16 women and 9 men), mean age 56.6 +/- 8.3. Sotalol was orally used in dose 160 mg/day during 6 weeks. Recording of SAECG and ambulatory Holter monitoring were made at baseline and in 10 day and after 6 weeks of therapy. The following time-domain parameters were analyzed: the root mean square voltage of the last 40 and 50ms of the filtered QRS (RMS 40 i RMS 50), total time duration of filtered QRS (t-QRS) and duration of low amplitude signals < 40 microV in the terminal part of QRS (LPD). Late potentials (LP) were recognized when at least two from three criteria were fulfilled: 1) RMS40 < 20 microV, 2) t-QRS > 114 ms, 3) LPD > 38ms. Frequency analysis of SAECG allowed to calculate the following parameters in logarithmic scale: energy spectrum > -60dB (A) and decibel drop at 40 Hz (Dd) and also in linear scale: area ratio 20-50/0-20 Hz (Ar) and magnitude ratio (MR1-7). The values of RMS40 and RMS50 and also t-QRS and LPD did not significantly change after sotalol treatment. At baseline the presence of LP was recorded in 7 (28%) cases, after 10 days of antiarrhythmic therapy only in 3 (12%), and after 6 weeks occurred in 6 (24%) cases. Moreover, sotalol hydrochloride did not statistically significant change frequency-domain parameters in logarithmic scale: A and Dd. On the other hand, the parameters in linear scale: MR1, MR4 and MR6 significantly change but these changes were not uniform. These findings suggest that oral treatment of sotalol hydrochloride did not significantly change time- and frequency-domain parameters of signal-averaged electrocardiogram in patients with ischemic heart disease.",

    "58": "The prevention of coronary artery disease (CHD) and particularly of myocardial infarction (MI) is based on some well designed strategies aimed at treating both asymptomatic high-risk patients (primary prevention) and patients with established CHD (secondary prevention). A positive impact from primary prevention can be basically achieved trough a reduction in high blood pressure and by correcting dyslipidemia. The benefit can be substantially increased by smoking cessation, increasing physical exercise, reduction of body weight, use of post-menopausal oestrogen, moderate alcohol consumption and use of high doses of vitamin E in those patients who are compliant with the specific strategies. Secondary prevention of MI can be again obtained by controlling blood pressure and reducing serum cholesterol in patients surviving acute MI who can also benefit from the administration of beta-blockers, aspirin and probably ace-inhibitors particularly in presence of left ventricular dysfunction. We suggest that in both arms of prevention, significant results can be achieved mainly by a multifactorial approach capable of correcting all the modifiable risk factors that contribute to the rather complex pathogenesis of CHD.", 
    "59": "Drug treatment with beta-blockers and diuretics in hypertensive men and women aged 70 and above confers highly significant and clinically relevant reductions in cardiovascular (especially stroke) morbidity and mortality. This satisfactory effect is not impaired by a low tolerability of the drugs used. Furthermore, treatment of elderly hypertensives with beta-receptor blockers and/or diuretics is cost-effective. In STOP-Hypertension the cost-effectiveness ratios were low and of the same magnitude for both men and women. The clinical implication of this is that blood pressure lowering therapy should be considered in elderly hypertensives, at least up until they are 80 years old. It should also be remembered that elderly patients often have other diseases than hypertension and that the drug treatment should be adjusted accordingly, e.g. by using a calcium antagonist or an ACE inhibitor, when indicated.",

[125I]-SB 207710 (5-1200 pmol/l) labelled a small population of saturable binding sites (Bmax approximately 4 fmol/mg protein) with a pK(D) of 9.7 and with 5-HT4 receptor characteristics, as assessed with competing ligands. The density of atrial binding sites with 5-HT4 receptor characteristics was 10 and 5 times lower, respectively, than the density of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors. We suggest that the small 5-HT4 receptor population may in part explain why the positive inotropic effects of 5-HT are smaller than those of catecholamines mediated through beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "61": "Activation of prejunctional beta-adrenoceptors has been suggested to increase the release of noradrenaline but to decrease the neural release of ATP in the guinea-pig vas deferens.

In [3H]-noradrenaline-preincubated tissues superfused with medium containing prazosin and suramin, isoprenaline (1-100 nM), salbutamol (0.01-1 microM) and terbutaline (0.1-10 microM) increased the overflow of tritium but reduced the overflow of ATP elicited by electrical stimulation (210 pulses/7 Hz). The effects of isoprenaline were blocked by the beta 2-selective antagonist 1-[2,3-(dihydro-7-methyl-1H-inden-4-yl)oxy]-3- [(1-methylethyl)amino]-2-butanol (ICI 118,551; 100 nM).

Isoprenaline (1-100 nM), salbutamol (0.01-1 microM) and terbutaline (0.1-10 microM) reduced the initial twitch contraction elicited by electrical stimulation (210 pulses/7 Hz) in prazosin- and suramin-free medium as well as the isolated purinergic neurogenic contraction obtained by exposure to prazosin. They increased or tended to increase the secondary sustained concentration elicited by electrical stimulation in prazosin- and suramin-free medium as well as the isolated adrenergic neurogenic contraction obtained in the presence of suramin. The inhibition by isoprenaline of the isolated purinergic contraction was attenuated by ICI 118,551 (100 nM) but not by the beta 1-selective antagonist 1-[2-((3-carbamoyl- 4-hydroxy)phenoxy)ethylamino]-3-[4-(1-methyl-4- trifluoromethyl-2-imidazolyl)phenoxy]-2-propanol (CGP 20712A; 100 nM). The results confirm the opposite beta-adrenoceptor-mediated modulation of noradrenaline and neural ATP release in the guinea-pig vas deferens. They show that the prejunctional beta-adrenoceptor is of the beta 2-subtype.", 
    "62": "It has been suggested that spreading depression may play a role in triggering classical migraine. In this study the retinal spreading depression was used as a pharmacological tool to test the neuronal effects of several common antimigraine drugs. As the chicken retina is void of any blood vessels the observed effects must be of pure neuronal origin. It is shown that propranolol, sumatriptan, methysergide, paracetamol and acetylsalicyclic acid decrease the propagation velocity of retinal spreading depression waves, accelerate the recovery of the optical and electrical signal and reduce the amplitude of the negative potential shift, concomitant with the spreading depression. Barbiturate increases the spreading velocity, and the amplitude of the potential shift. Ergotamine, clonidine, lisuride and iprazochrome have no significant influence on retinal spreading depression.", 
    "63": "The effect on the intraocular pressure (IOP) of 0.5% timolol solution given twice daily was compared to 0.5% timolol in gel-forming solution given once daily. Patients (n = 223) having an IOP of above 22 mmHg were recruited from 16 eye specialist centres in Scandinavia and Finland. The patients were randomized to two treatment groups, timolol solution treatment and timolol in gel-forming solution treatment. Eyes with and without pseudoexfoliation were included. The patients were stratified regarding the presence or not of pseudoexfoliation, to ensure appropriate distribution of this condition. No difference in intraocular pressure reducing effect was registered for the two groups. The pressure reducing effect of the two modes of treatment was not affected by the presence or not of pseudoexfoliation. The study also included registration of local and systemic signs and symptoms possibly related to the study medications. Blurring of vision occurred more often in patients given 0.5% timolol in gel-forming solution compared to timolol solution. The heart rate decreased statistically significantly in patients given timolol solution, but not in patients given timolol in gel-forming solution. This study suggests that treatment with 0.5% timolol in gel-forming solution once a day may be equally as good as 0.5% timolol solution given twice a day in patients with glaucoma both with and without pseudoexfoliation.", 
    "64": "The intraocular pressure reducing effect and side-effects of latanoprost, a phenyl-substituted prostaglandin analogue, were compared with those of timolol, in a group of 31 glaucomatous or ocular hypertensive patients, divided into three subgroups. The study was randomized and double masked. At the end of 6 month's treatment with latanoprost 0.005% once daily, either as a morning dose or as an evening dose, there was a reduction in intraocular pressure of 33% (p < 0.001) and 36% (p < 0.001), respectively. The intraocular pressure reduction of timolol 0.5%, administered twice daily was 26% (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in conjunctival hyperemia between the groups and there were few subjective symptoms in any of the patients. One patient with a light green-brown iris, treated with latanoprost in one eye only, exhibited an increase in iris colour in the treated eye at week 26, and did not show any signs of reversion 9 months after discontinuing the therapy. It may be concluded that latanoprost is well tolerated and at least as effective as timolol in reducing intraocular pressure in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension when applied once daily. The exact mechanism behind the increase in iris pigmentation and the clinical significance of this previously unknown side-effect needs to be investigated further.", 
    "65": "Effective protection from the risk of variceal bleeding is achieved when the hepatic venous pressure gradient is reduced to 12 mmHg or at least by 20% of baseline values. Such a marked decrease is rarely achieved with propranolol, and new agents or combinations of them are now being explored. The present randomized study investigated whether chronic treatment with the combination of propranolol plus molsidomine, a preferential venous dialator that reduces hepatic venous pressure gradient and does not cause pharmacological tolerance, achieves greater reduction in hepatic venous pressure gradient than propranolol alone.", 
    "66": "A hemodynamic study was performed in 34 patients with cirrhosis with portal hypertension in baseline conditions and after 3 months of chronic oral treatment with propranolol alone (n = 19) or propranolol plus molsidomine (n = 15).", 
    "67": "Propranolol produced a significant reduction in hepatic venous pressure gradient (-16%, p < 0.01). Propranolol plus molsidomine also caused a slight but significant decrease in hepatic venous pressure gradient (-9%, p < 0.05). Hepatic blood flow and the hepatic and intrinsic clearance of indocyanine green were significantly reduced by propranolol. The combined administration of propranolol+molsidomine significantly reduced hepatic blood flow but not hepatic and intrinsic clearance of indocyanine green. Both treatment groups produced similar reduction in azygos blood flow, heart rate and cardiac output. However, contrary to propranolol alone, propranolol plus molsidomine did not increase cardiopulmonary pressures.", 
    "68": "The current study shows that although the combined administration of propranolol plus molsidomine prevents some of the adverse effects of propranolol on liver function and cardiopulmonary pressures, it does not achieve a greater reduction in hepatic venous pressure gradient than propranolol alone and therefore, does not support the use of this combined therapy for the pharmacological treatment of portal hypertension.", 
    "69": "The objective of this study was to assess the medium-term effects of betaxolol, a long-acting, lipid-soluble, cardioselective, beta-adrenergic antagonist, alone and in combination with nitrendipine on blood pressure (BP) and metabolism of lipid, lipoprotein and apolipoprotein in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Forty-seven patients (21 men, 26 women, average age 54 years) participated in an open controlled clinical trial. After a 4-week washout period, all of the patients received betaxolol monotherapy at a dose of 5-10 mg daily for 6 months (Phase I). From month 7 through month 12 (Phase II), half of the total patients (Group B, n = 23) with diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 95 mm Hg or more at the end of Phase I were also given nitrendipine (10-20 mg, once daily), while the remaining patients (Group A, n = 24) continued to receive only betaxolol. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), DBP, and heart rate (HR) were monitored once monthly. Serum lipid profiles were measured at study entry and after 6 and 12 months of therapy. Betaxolol significantly reduced SBP, DBP, and HR in both groups during Phase I, and the reductions in SBP and DBP were markedly less in Group B than in Group A. During Phase II, the additional reduction of SBP and DBP to levels similar to those in Group A was achieved by betaxolol in combination with nitrendipine, and HR was slightly but significantly increased. Betaxolol monotherapy reduced serum levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and increased levels of triglyceride, apolipoprotein (apo) C-II and apo C-III. Combination therapy with betaxolol and nitrendipine increased serum apo A-I but did not affect other lipid profiles. Our results indicate that betaxolol is an effective antihypertensive drug which has a preferable effect on HR and HDL profiles when combined with nitrendipine.", 
    "70": "The effects of scorpion venom Leiurus quinquestriatus hebreus were studied on cardiac cells grown in culture. The venom (30 micrograms/ml) increased significantly (P < 0.05) Ca2+ uptake into intact cardiocytes and to sarcoplasmic reticulum of skinned cells. [3H]Deoxyglucose uptake was also increased significantly (P < 0.05) in venom treated cardiocytes. It was found that fractions I and III of the venom, separated by gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography, are responsible for the increased Ca2+ uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum, whereas fraction IIb, III and IV are responsible for the accelerated rate of uptake of 45Ca and [3H]deoxyglucose by intact cells. Ca channel blockers prevented these effects and similar results were obtained by propranolol. Thus, it is concluded that the venom exerts its effect through activation of beta-adrenoceptors which causes the opening of L-type Ca channels.", 
    "71": "The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of penbutolol were examined in healthy volunteers and in cancer patients using a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (pk/pd) model. After receiving a 40 mg single oral dose of penbutolol, the absorption rate constant, apparent volume of distribution and serum clearance of penbutolol were found to be reduced in the cancer group. Changes in the disposition of the conjugate metabolite were also observed in the cancer patients. Penbutolol unbound fraction in serum was statistically decreased (p < 0.005) in the cancer group, according to the increase in the serum levels of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein seen in that group (p < 0.05). The pharmacodynamic effect of penbutolol was measured as the reduction in heart rate (HR); in healthy volunteers, a linear relationship (p < 0.01) between effect and penbutolol serum concentrations (total or unbound) was found. In contrast, in cancer patients, values of HR did not vary statistically in respect to baseline values. These results show that in cancer patients, a change in the pharmacokinetics of penbutolol occurs (associated with changes in drug protein binding), together with an alteration in the pharmacodynamics.", 
    "72": "In patients with postinfarction sustained ventricular tachycardia showing one or more antiarrhythmic drug failures, the question is how long to proceed with new drug trials before deciding to perform map-guided arrhythmia surgery. Although the techniques of this surgery developed rapidly in the early 1980s, this therapy may be offset by damage to residual left ventricular function. However, surgery has been shown to be very effective in selected groups of patients.", 
    "73": "A randomized study was carried out in patients with postinfarction ventricular tachycardia and eligible for arrhythmia surgery based on residual left ventricular function. Therapy failure was defined by the occurrence of the following events: spontaneous recurrence of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, sudden cardiac death, inducibility of sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation with programmed stimulation of the heart, symptomatic non-sustained ventricular tachycardia requiring therapy or side-effects of antiarrhythmic drugs requiring withdrawal. In the drug limb, failure of the first antiarrhythmic drug was accepted but failure of a second and different drug was regarded as true therapy failure.", 
    "74": "After randomization, antiarrhythmic drug therapy was administered in 33 patients, and 30 patients underwent surgery. Neither group differed in baseline characteristics, and the mean number of drug failures before randomization was 2.7. The Kaplan-Meier therapeutic failure of antiarrhythmic drugs was 39 +/- 11%, 42 +/- 11% and 51 +/- 18% at 0.5-, 1- and 4-year follow-up, respectively, whereas the therapeutic failure of cardiac surgery was 37 +/- 11%, 37 +/- 11% and 50 +/- 20% at 0.5, 1 and 4 years, respectively, showing no statistical difference. The 1- and 4-year Kaplan-Meier survival of the antiarrhythmic drug-treated group was 91 +/- 6% and 78 +/- 15%, respectively, and of the surgical group 92 +/- 6% and 59 +/- 20%, respectively, and did not differ between either group. However, the relative risk for total cardiac death was higher in the surgical limb than in the drug limb (relative risk 2.2, CI 0.68-7.48).", 
    "75": "This study demonstrated no difference between the therapeutic result of continuation of two different antiarrhythmic drugs and that of arrhythmia surgery. Despite the small number of patients studied, it is recommended that drug therapy should continue as long as this regimen is tolerated by the patient. When true drug refractoriness or side-effects of drugs arise, arrhythmia surgery offers a valuable alternative. However, when additional reasons for cardiac surgery exist, arrhythmia surgery should be undertaken earlier and may become the first choice of treatment of postinfarction ventricular tachycardia.", 
    "76": "The rationale for beta-blockade in heart failure is now well established. Heart failure mortality, which is predicted by neurohormonal activation, remains high despite modern treatment including ACE inhibition, and additional neurohormonal blockade has further therapeutic potential. Previous clinical trial experience in heart failure, most of which has been in patients with idiopathic cardiomyopathy, indicates consistent improvement in ventricular function although variable changes in symptoms and exercise performance. However, the major burden of heart failure occurs in patients with ischaemic heart disease and in this respect it is notable that beta-blockade following myocardial infarction confers significant mortality benefit in subgroups with heart failure. The Australia and New Zealand carvedilol heart failure study is the largest completed study of beta-blocker treatment in patients with heart failure of ischaemic aetiology, including 415 patients randomized to carvedilol or placebo and indicating excellent tolerability of a titrated dose regimen and improved ventricular function after 6 months of treatment. An overview of all currently available randomized clinical trials of beta-blockade in heart failure, which includes more than 1600 patients, indicates a mortality risk reduction of approximately 20% but with wide confidence intervals. A large scale trial with several thousand patients is required to detect reliably a plausible 15-20% mortality reduction with beta-blockade in heart failure. The dissociation of clinical and mortality effects demonstrated with other heart failure treatments indicates the necessity for an appropriately powered mortality study which could define a major improvement in heart failure therapy for the future.", 
    "77": "The beta-blocking drugs are known to modify the course of hypertensive and atherosclerotic heart disease and significantly reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with these diseases. The place of vasodilating beta-blocking drugs, of which carvedilol is an example, has not been so clear, although they have obvious theoretical advantages. We performed a study on 12 hypertensive subjects using the technique of continuous ambulatory intra-arterial blood pressure recording which demonstrated that carvedilol (50 mg bid) achieved satisfactory blood pressure control throughout the full 24 h cycle. The addition, there was a marked reduction in left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes with prolonged administration, suggesting a decrease in heart size, confirmed in other studies. A second study in patients with chronic stable angina and impaired left ventricular wall motion showed that carvedilol 25 mg bid not only improved exercise tolerance, but also reduced heart size, improved left ventricular ejection fraction, and abolished wall motion abnormalities. These results prompted a further study in 17 patients with chronic ischaemic heart failure. The haemodynamic and clinical responses to intravenous carvedilol followed by the oral drug 50 mgm b.i.d. for 8 weeks were studied. There was an improvement in all haemodynamic indices, although postural hypotension necessitated withdrawing two patients and clinical deterioration was evident in two others. The beneficial effects of carvedilol were considered to be related to the combined reduction in afterload and inhibition of neurohumeral activation. These results have been confirmed in placebo-controlled, double-blind studies from other workers.", 
    "78": "Carvedilol is a vasodilating beta-blocker currently marketed for the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension and application is being filed to the FDA for treatment of congestive heart failure. Carvedilol reduces peripheral vascular resistance by blocking arterial alpha 1-adrenoceptors, thereby producing vasodilation, while preventing reflex tachycardia by blocking cardiac beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors. In addition to the safety and efficacy of carvedilol as an antihypertensive agent, experimental studies indicate that carvedilol also provides significant cardioprotection in animal models of acute myocardial infarction as well as protection against the vascular remodelling that occurs following injury of the vasculature. Recent pharmacological studies have uncovered several novel properties of carvedilol which may function to protect the heart and vasculature from chronic pathological processes, such as ischaemia, atherosclerosis and the remodelling that occurs in the heart and blood vessels as a consequence of pressure overload, injury or shear stress. Specifically, carvedilol, likely as a result of the carbazol moiety, is a potent anti-oxidant. In physicochemical, biochemical and cellular assays carvedilol and several of its metabolites inhibit lipid peroxidation, scavenge oxygen free radicals, inhibit the formation of reactive oxygen radicals and prevent the depletion of endogenous antioxidants, such as vitamin E and glutathione. Moreover, carvedilol blocks the oxidation of low-density lipoproteins (LDL), and thereby prevents the formation of oxidized-LDL which is believed to stimulate foam cell formation and augment the development of atherosclerotic plaque. The ability of carvedilol to prevent the formation of oxidized LDL, in addition to the general anti-oxidant properties of the compound, results in the protection of the endothelium from oxygen free radical injury, and thereby prevents the subsequent events triggered by endothelial damage. Recently, carvedilol has also been shown to inhibit vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration. Because carvedilol can inhibit vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation induced by a wide variety of mitogens (e.g. growth factors, angiotensin II, endothelin, thrombin), it is likely that the site of inhibition occurs at some point beyond the specific mitogen receptors, possibly at a distal common pathway that affects the smooth muscle cell cycle. These unique activities of carvedilol have also been confirmed in vivo in a rat model of neointimal formation following vascular injury by balloon angioplasty, where vascular smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation are the key processes involved in the formation of neointima leading to vascular stenosis. In this model, carvedilol suppressed neointimal growth to a remarkable extent ( > 85% inhibition of neointimal formation) at a dose that is similar to the antihypertensive dose used clinically in hypertensive patients. Taken together, these unique multiple actions of carvedilol provide not only for adequate control of elevated blood pressure, but may also provide for protection of the heart and vasculature from secondary damage due to hypertension itself, as well as from other causes, such as ischaemia, pressure overload, shear stress, vascular injury and atherosclerosis.", 
    "79": "Although heart failure has been viewed primarily as a haemodynamic disorder, the development of pharmacologic agents that address the haemodynamic derangements has not proved to be a successful approach to its management. Consequently, attention in recent years has shifted to the development of neurohormonal antagonists in the hope that prolonged interference with the renin-angiotensin system and the sympathetic nervous system would have favourable effects on the natural history of heart failure. Both converting-enzyme inhibitors and beta-adrenergic blockers have been shown to produce long-term haemodynamic and clinical benefits in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction in controlled clinical trials. For both classes of drugs, the improvement evolves gradually over several months, although initiation of therapy may be accompanied by undesirable (but usually transient) haemodynamic effects. This pattern of response contrasts sharply with the response pattern seen with direct-acting vasodilators that stimulate neurohormonal systems (e.g. flosequinan). Initiation of treatment with flosequinan produces immediate clinical benefits due to the haemodynamic actions of the drug, but this improvement may disappear within weeks as a result of neurohormonal activation, which also may contribute to the increased risk of death seen during long-term administration of the drug. Recognition of the prognostic importance of neurohormonal activation has led to the hope that long-term treatment with beta-blockers might reduce mortality in heart failure in a manner similar to that seen with converting-enzyme inhibitors. Large-scale, long-term studies are being planned to evaluate this possibility.", 
    "80": "There are good theoretical reasons for supposing that long-term treatment with a beta-blocker would improve symptoms and survival in patients with heart failure. A series of small studies have shown that beta-blockers improve haemodynamic parameters, but it is well known that these correlate poorly with symptoms. There is some evidence that exercise tolerance is also improved. Although there is so far no convincing evidence that beta-blockers prolong survival in patients with heart failure the development of a new generation of these drugs with additional vasodilating properties makes further large studies essential.", 
    "81": "Carvedilol is an adrenoceptor antagonist which modulates the activity not only of beta 1 and beta 2 but also of alpha 1 adrenergic receptors present on the cell surface membrane of the human cardiac myocyte. In the heart, carvedilol has approximately 7 times higher potency for beta 1 and beta 2 adrenoceptors, but in the doses 50-100 mg . day-1 used in clinical practice, it is essentially non-selective. In human myocardial preparations and in cultured heart cells, carvedilol has no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity but is able to identify high affinity agonist-binding receptors whose pharmacological signature is reduction in binding by incubation with guanine nucleotides (guanine nucleotide-modulatable binding). This property is more prominent for the human beta 2 than for the beta 1 adrenoceptor. The property of gaunine nucleotide-modulatable binding for carvedilol and structurally related bucindolol correlates with their ability to directly down-regulate beta 1-like receptors present in cultured chick myocytes, and with a lack of reversal of down-regulation of cardiac beta-receptors in patients with heart failure. Carvedilol does not exhibit high levels of inverse agonist activity, which may contribute to its good tolerability in subjects with heart failure. These data indicate that carvedilol produces a high degree of adrenergic receptor blockade in the failing human heart, and does not re-sensitize the beta-receptor pathway to stimulation by adrenergic agonists.", 
    "82": "The treatment of congestive heart failure has seen considerable changes: while treatment with diuretics, digitalis glycosides and vasodilators has remained the mainstay of therapy, recently neurohumeral inhibition has been developed as an important principle: ACE-inhibitors have been shown to significantly improve quality of life and exercise performance and to substantially reduce mortality. Beta-blockers have been employed with increasing success mainly in congestive heart failure due to dilated idiopathic cardiomyopathy, in which a significant improvement in symptoms and life expectancy has been demonstrated. However, the precise mechanisms by which beta-blockade improves congestive heart failure remain to be elucidated. In addition to direct sympathoadrenal inhibition, reduction of heart rate may also play a major role in the therapeutic efficacy of beta-blockade in congestive heart failure. In the normal human heart increase in heart rate is accompanied by an increase in myocardial contractile performance (Bowditch-Treppe phenomenon). In chronic heart failure the myocardium undergoes a phenotype change which includes alterations of the activity of enzymes regulating calcium homoeostasis. The sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) is depressed both in function, as well as in expression. At the same time the sarcolemmal sodium-calcium exchanger is increased both in function and in expression. The result is a characteristic change in calcium homoeostasis with decreased diastolic uptake of calcium into the sarcoplasmic reticulum with subsequently reduced calcium release during the next systole, resulting in reduced contractile performance. At the same time increased capacity of the sodium-calcium exchanger extrudes intracellular calcium ions to the extra-cellular space, thereby rendering these ions unavailable for the contractile cycle. A result of these, seemingly specific, phenotype changes is an alteration of the force/frequency relationship. Instead of increasing force of contraction with increasing heart rates, in the chronically failing myocardium the contractile performance declines with increasing heart rates and only improves with decreasing rates. Optimal performance can be seen at heart rates as low as 30 beats.min. Studies employing photoluminescence markers of free cytosolic calcium, such as aequorin, have shown that there is a direct correlation between free cytosolic calcium and contractile performance at different levels of heart rate. It is likely, therefore, that the heart rate reduction with beta-blockade may provide the major explanation for the therapeutic benefits of beta-blockade in chronic congestive heart failure.", 
    "83": "1. The effects of nipradilol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist which possesses a nitroxy group, on cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), and on tension development were simultaneously measured by front-surface fluorometry and fura-2-loaded strips in the proximal portion of pig coronary arteries. 2. Nipradilol reduced in a concentration-dependent manner both the [Ca2+]i and tension, irrespective of whether the strips were unstimulated or exposed to either high K+ or histamine containing solutions. However, both in the case of contractions induced by high K+-depolarization and histamine stimulation, for a given [Ca2+]i elevation the tension which developed in the presence of nipradilol was smaller than that generated in its absence, so that the [Ca2+]i-tension curves during the contraction were shifted to the right. 3. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, the [Ca2+]i elevation due to the release of Ca2+ from histamine-sensitive store was inhibited by nipradilol. Nipradilol had no effect on the [Ca2+]i elevation due to the release of Ca2+ from caffeine-sensitive stores; however, it did inhibit the caffeine-induced increase in tension. A derivative of nipradilol, which lacked a nitroxy molecule (Nip(-N)), had no effect on the [Ca2+]i and tension elevated by histamine or caffeine in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. 4. The beta-adrenoceptor agonist, isoprenaline, reduced [Ca2+]i tension when applied to steady state contractions induced by high K+, or at the peak level of tension to histamine. The reduction of [Ca2+]i and tension induced by isoprenaline was inhibited by Nip(-N) in a concentration-dependent manner and nipradilol inhibited the isoprenaline-induced relaxation with bell-shaped concentration-response curves. At lower concentrations, nipradilol acted as a beta-blocker, the IC50- value being smaller than that of Nip(-N), and at higher concentrations, it acted as a nitrovasodilator. 5. Thus, it is suggested that, at lower concentrations, nipradilol, an antianginal drug, acts as a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist. At higher concentrations, it relaxes the proximal portion of the coronary artery by directly reducing [Ca2+]i and the Ca2+-sensitivity of the myofilaments, apparently due to the presence of the nitroxy molecule.", 
    "84": "1. Various bradykinin derivatives, acting preferentially at B1 or B2 receptors, were tested in the isolated longitudinal smooth muscle of rat ileum. Experiments were carried out in the presence of chlorpheniramine and atropine (both 1 microM), guanethidine and indomethacin (both 3 microM) and of the peptidase inhibitors (captopril, bestatin and thiorphan, all 1 microM). 2. The rank order of potency was (pD2 values +/- s.e.mean, n = 5 in parentheses, at 5 h from set-up): [des-Arg9]-BK (8.27 +/- 0.11) > or = [des-Arg10]-kallidin (7.67 +/- 0.24) > bradykinin (6.69 +/- 0.25). The B2 receptor selective agonist, [Hyp3,Tyr(Me)8]-BK, was approximately 10 fold less active than bradykinin. Contractile responses to all agonists increased with time. The maximal response to the B1 receptor agonist, [desArg9]-BK at 5 h (94 +/- 2%) was significantly (P < 0.05) greater than that measured at 2 h (74 +/- 2%). 3. The B2 receptor antagonist, D-Arg[Hyp3, Thi5, D-Tic7, Oic8]-BK (Hoe 140, 0.1 microM) did not affect responses to the B1 receptor agonist [des-Arg9]-BK (0.1 nM--1 microM) nor those to the B2 receptor agonist, [Hyp3,Tyr(Me)8]-BK (1 nM--10 microM). In control experiments performed in the longitudinal smooth muscle of guinea-pig ileum and rat isolated urinary bladder as bioassays for B2 receptors, the B2 receptor antagonist Hoe 140 (0.1 microM) antagonized bradykinin-induced contractions. 4. In the rat isolated ileum the B1 receptor antagonist, D-Arg[Hyp3, Thi5, D-Tic7, Oic8, des-Arg9]-BK ([des-Arg10]-Hoe 140, 0.3 - 10 microM) competitively antagonized contractile responses to [des-Arg9]-BK with an estimated pKB of 6.74 +/- 0.08 (Schild plot slope with confidence limits 1.22, (0.70 - 1.73) n = 13). In control experiments in the guinea-pig isolated ileum and rat isolated urinary bladder, [des-Arg10]-Hoe 140 (1 - 10 microM) did not inhibit B2 receptor-mediated contractile responses. 5. The putative B1 receptor antagonist, [Leu8,des-Arg9]-BK, behaved as a partial agonist when responses were determined 2 h from set-up (pD2 6.43 +/- 0.21, n = 5; Emax 30% of that evoked by [des-Arg9]-BK); at 5 h from set-up it behaved as a full agonist (pD2 7.48 +/- 0.12, n = 5; Emax 90% of that evoked by [des-Arg9]-BK). At this time the response to [Leu8,des-Arg9]-BK was antagonized in a concentration-dependent manner by [des-Arg10]-Hoe 140, which at 1 microM and 10 microM, produced dose-ratios of 6.33 +/- 3.66 (n = 4) and 103 +/- 40 (n = 4). 6. In view of the rank order of potency of agonists, the antagonist activity by [des-Arg10]-Hoe 140 and the lack of antagonist activity of Hoe 140, we conclude that the longitudinal smooth muscle of rat ileum, after histamine, acetylcholine, noradrenaline, and prostanoid production blockade, is a sensitive monoreceptor assay for studying the pharmacology of bradykinin B1 receptors. Further the preparation can also be used as a sensitive bioassay to identify partial agonist activity of B1 receptor antagonists such as [Leu8,desArg9]-BK.", 
    "85": "1. The metabolism of a single 80 mg oral dose of propranolol was determined in nine young women before and after administration of ethinyloestradiol alone (EE2) or in combination with norethindrone (OC). 2. Whereas the total clearance of propranolol (2713 +/- 404 ml min-1 (mean +/- s.e.mean)) was not significantly altered by either EE2 (3365 +/- 347 ml min-1) or the combined OC (2905 +/- 345 ml min-1), significant changes in all three primary metabolic pathways were observed. 3. The clearance through side-chain oxidation decreased from 345 +/- 55 ml min-1 to 262 +/- 33 ml min-1 after EE2 (P < 0.05). A similar reduction of cytochrome P450 metabolism by EE2 has been observed for other drugs. 4. The clearance through glucuronidation increased from 364 +/- 61 ml min-1 to 625 +/- 117 ml min-1 after EE2 (P < 0.01). Similar stimulation of glucuronic acid conjugation by EE2 has also been observed for other drugs. 5. The clearance through ring oxidation increased from 697 +/- 109 ml min-1 to 1280 +/- 162 ml min-1 after EE2 (P < 0.01). This observation appears to be a novel finding with EE2 and cytochrome P450 metabolism. 6. The treatment with OC produced changes in propranolol's metabolic clearances which were qualitatively similar to those generated by EE2.", 
    "86": "1. The role of adrenal hormones in the regulation of the systemic and local production of tumour necrosis factor (TNF alpha) was examined in male Balb/c mice. 2. Intraperitoneal injection of 0.3 mg E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 0111:B4) led to high levels of circulating TNF alpha without stimulating TNF alpha production in the peritoneal cavity. Systemic production of TNF alpha in response to LPS was increased in adrenalectomized animals and in normal animals treated with the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol. The glucocorticoid antagonist, RU 486, did not modify systemic TNF alpha production. These results indicate that systemic TNF alpha production is regulated by adrenaline but not by corticosterone. 3. When mice were primed with thioglycollate, TNF alpha was produced in the peritoneal cavity in response to low dose LPS (1 micrograms). The levels of TNF alpha in the peritoneal cavity were not enhanced by adrenalectomy or by treatment with either propranolol or RU 486, indicating local production of TNF alpha in the peritoneal cavity is not regulated by adrenaline or corticosterone. 4. The phosphodiesterase type IV (PDE-IV) inhibitor, rolipram, inhibited both the systemic production of TNF alpha in response to high dose endotoxin (ED50 = 1.3 mg kg-1) and the local production of TNF alpha in the peritoneal cavity in response to low dose endotoxin (ED50 = 9.1 mg kg-1). In adrenalectomized mice there was a slight reduction in the ability of rolipram to inhibit the systemic production of TNF alpha (ED50 = 3.3 mg kg-1) while the ability of rolipram to inhibit the local production of TNF alpha in the peritoneal cavity was virtually abolished (24% inhibition at 30 mg kg-1). The glucocorticoid antagonist, RU 486, also reduced the ability of rolipram to inhibit local TNF alpha production while propranolol was without effect. 5. Systemic treatment with rolipram increased the plasma concentrations of corticosterone in normal mice but not in adrenalectomized mice indicating that rolipram can cause adrenal stimulation in vivo. 6. In summary, these data indicate that systemic production of TNF alpha in response to high dose endotoxin is controlled differently from the local production of TNF alpha in response to low dose endotoxin. The systemic production of TNF alpha is regulated by catecholamines, but not by corticosterone, while the local production of TNF alpha in the peritoneal cavity is not regulated by basal levels of either catecholamines or corticosterone. 7. These data also show that the ability of rolipram to inhibit the local production of TNF alpha is dependent on the release of corticosterone from the adrenal glands.", 
    "87": "The role of beta 3-adrenoceptors in human colonic circular smooth muscle was assessed in vitro by use of the beta 3-selective antagonist SR 59230A. Isoprenaline, in the presence of the selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists CGP 20712A (beta 1) and ICI 118551 (beta 2), both at 0.1 microM, concentration-dependently relaxed the preparation (pEC50 = 5.22). This effect was potently and competitively antagonized by SR 59230A with a pA2 of 8.31, while its R,R enantiomer SR 59483A gave an apparent pKB of 6.21. Relaxation was likewise produced by CGP 12177A (pEC50 = 6.05), but not by BRL 37344. Although only one of these beta 3-selective agonists was effective, the remarkably high potency of SR 59230A as a stereospecific antagonist of non-beta 1 non-beta 2 relaxation of human colonic muscle by isoprenaline provides strong functional evidence of beta 3-adrenoceptors in that tissue.", 
    "88": "We measured DNA single strand breaks (SSB) in cardiac myoblast cells in response to norepinephrine (NE) stimulation. Rat cardiac myoblast cells (H9c2) were stimulated with concentrations of 100 microMs to 1 mM NE for 2, 3, 4, and 12 hours after prior incubation with control solution, bunazosin, propranolol, verapamil, or captopril for 30 min. The DNA damage was measured by fluorometric alkaline elution. The strand scission factor, an index of the severity of SSB, increased slightly after stimulation with 200 microMs NE for 12 hours and with 1 mM NE for 4 hours. This increase was prevented by catalase or superoxide dismutase, which prevent production or accumulation of active oxygen radicals, during the stimulation, but not by pretreatment with a alpha-receptor antagonist, a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, a Ca2+ antagonist, or an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. Thus, DNA SSB were induced by NE in cardiac myoblast cells. Certain active oxygen species may contribute to the DNA damage induced by NE.",

    "90": "Primary hyperaldosteronism was suspected before pregnancy in a 31-year-old women with refractory hypertension and hypokalemia. Pregnancy evaluation revealed suppressed renin levels and high aldosterone levels; computed tomography revealed a 1-cm mass in the left adrenal gland. The patient became pregnant before completion of evaluation and treatment. On high doses of nifedipine and nadolol, the first-trimester blood pressure was 130/98 mm Hg and remained high in the early second trimester. In view of the risks of poorly controlled hypertension, adrenalectomy was performed at 15 weeks' gestation, with rapid improvement in blood pressure and elimination of the patient's requirement for large doses of potassium daily. Antihypertensive medication was withdrawn, with maintenance of normal blood pressure until 36 weeks' gestation. At that time the blood pressure rose slightly but responded to bed rest. A healthy female infant was delivered at term by cesarean section.", 
    "91": "Previous reports of emergency preterm delivery and a case of neonatal mortality in the setting of hyperaldosteronism in pregnancy confirm the significant risks associated with this condition.

    "92": "The effect of age on aortic blood velocity has been studied in 100 patients with angiographically-documented coronary artery disease, 500 of whom were receiving beta-adrenergic blocking agents. Using continuous-wave Doppler ultrasound, the aortic blood velocity signals, both at rest and at maximal-tolerated supine exercise, were obtained. From the Doppler signals the peak velocity (Vp), stroke distance (Sd; the velocity-time integral) and minute distance (Md = Sd x heart rate) were calculated. The measurements were repeated 6 weeks after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), performed in 30 patients. No relationship with age (p < 0.01) was found for any of the indices, either at rest or during exercise, except for the resting Md in patients not on beta-blockers, (p < 0.02). No difference in the slope of the relationship with age was found between patients on or not on beta-blockers, except for the resting Md (p < 0.02). Following CABG, a significant age relationship with Vp, Sd and Md was restored, during both resting and exercise, suggesting improvement of systolic left ventricular function following myocardial revascularization. In conclusion, the normal age relationships of the derivatives of aortic blood velocity Doppler ultrasound signals were not seen in patients with coronary artery disease, irrespective of whether they were on or off beta-blockers. The relationship changed following myocardial revascularization, suggesting their dependence on systolic left ventricular function.", 
    "93": "The aim of the study was to compare changes in blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) variability, catecholamine and neuropeptide Y (NPY) plasma levels induced by passive head-up tilt in normal and sino-aortic denervated (SAD) chloralose-anaesthetized dogs. In controls, 80 degrees head-up tilt test failed to change BP and increased HR. Plasma noradrenaline and NPY levels (but not adrenaline) significantly rose. In SAD dogs, head-up tilt test induced a marked and reproducible decrease in BP without any change in HR or noradrenaline and NPY plasma levels. In SAD dogs, spectral analysis in supine position was characterized by reduced variability in the high frequency (HF) band of the HR spectrum without changes in low frequency (LF) bands of both HR and systolic blood pressure (SBP). Head-up tilt test increased the LF component of SBP variability and decreased the HF component of HR variability in controls but failed to modify HR and BP variabilities in SAD dogs. In conclusion, sino-aortic denervation in dogs elicits a reproducible postural fall in BP with impaired adaptation of sympathetic nervous system activity. This model may be of value in evaluating the pharmacological effects of drugs for the management of orthostatic hypotension.",

    "98": "Patients were randomly assigned to receive midazolam at a target plasma concentration of 150 ng/mL (group 1; n = 10) or 300 ng/mL (group 2; n = 10). Sufentanil infusion was titrated to maintain hemodynamic stability, defined as mean arterial pressure within 15% of baseline values. All patients received preoperative beta-blocking agents. Arterial blood samples of midazolam and sufentanil were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassay, respectively.", 
    "99": "The mean dose of sufentanil (7.5 +/- 1.7 microgram/kg in group 1 v 7.2 +/- 2.5 micrograms/kg in group 2) did not differ. There were no significant differences in hemodynamics between the groups in the period before or after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Before CPB, in two patients in each group, hypertension was controlled with sufentanil only. One patient in group 1 required a vasodilator in addition to sufentanil. No ischemic events occurred before CPB. After CPB, one patient in group 2 required a vasodilator to control hypertension. Two patients in group 2 required treatment with nitroglycerin for myocardial ischemia. Stable plasma concentrations of sufentanil and midazolam were obtained during and after CPB. The midazolam infusion was continued in both groups at a rate of 1.25 micrograms/kg/min during the first 4 postoperative hours. The time to awakening did not differ between the groups (100 +/- 58 minutes in group 1 v 173 +/- 147 minutes in group 2) nor did the plasma concentrations of midazolam (96 +/- 28 ng/mL v 108 +/- 42 ng/mL) at the time of awakening. Intraoperative awareness was not reported.", 
    "100": "In patients undergoing CABG, good hemodynamic control with a similar incidence of hemodynamic interventions was observed at midazolam target plasma concentrations of 150 and 300 ng/mL when coadministered with sufentanil. The sufentanil requirement was identical in both groups. This study suggests that a midazolam plasma concentration of 150 ng/mL is sufficient to provide satisfactory hemodynamic control and to avoid intraoperative awareness.", 
    "101": "Abnormal left ventricular (LV) filling has been observed in patients with heart failure. One feature of this abnormality is a reduction in the left atrial (LA) contribution to filling, a feature that can adversely affect overall LV stroke output. In this study we examined the effects of early, long-term monotherapy with the beta-blocker, metoprolol, on LA contribution to ventricular filling in dogs with moderate heart failure. LV dysfunction (ejection fraction 30 percent to 40 percent) was produced in 14 dogs by multiple, sequential intracoronary microembolizations. Dogs were randomized to 3 months' therapy with metoprolol (25 mg twice daily; n = 7) or to no therapy at all (control; n = 7). Mitral inflow velocity was measured before randomization and after completion of therapy by using pulsed Doppler echocardiography. The percentage of LA contribution to LV filling was calculated as the ratio of the time-velocity integral of the LA component of mitral inflow velocity (Ai) to the time-velocity integral of total diastolic inflow velocity (Ti) times 100. In control dogs, the percentage of LA contribution to filling decreased after 3 months of follow-up compared with that before randomization (14 percent +/- 3 percent vs 23 percent +/- 5 percent; p = 0.02). In contrast, in dogs treated with metoprolol, the percentage of LA contribution to filling increased after 3 months of therapy compared with that before randomization (26 percent +/- 3 percent vs 21 percent +/- 2 percent; p = 0.001). Therapy with metoprolol produced a decrease in LV end-diastolic pressure, end-diastolic wall stress and stiffness, and an increase in LA fractional shortening compared with no therapy at all. We conclude that early, long-term therapy with metoprolol improves LA contribution to LV filling. This beneficial effect is likely caused by the ability of beta-blockers to reduce LA workload and consequently improve LA performance.", 
    "102": "Dobutamine is an effective pharmacologic stress used in conjunction with echocardiography because of its beta-agonist properties. Concurrent beta-blockade might alter this effectiveness; however, current clinical experience has been variable. The purpose of this study is to determine whether concurrent beta-blockade alters the ability of a dobutamine stress echocardiogram to detect a fixed coronary stenosis by preventing the onset of a wall motion abnormality or by altering the dose at which the wall motion abnormality appears. Paired dobutamine stress tests with and without beta-blockade (esmolol 500 microgram/kg initial bolus, 100 microg/kg/min infusion) were performed in a canine model (n = 8) with a fixed single-vessel coronary stenosis. Heart rate, systolic pressure, proximal left anterior descending coronary flow, myocardial thickening (by sonomicrometry), and left ventricular area change (by epicardial echocardiography) were monitored. Simultaneous beta-blockade resulted in (1) a delayed and diminished increase in hemodynamic parameters (peak heart rate 164.1 +/- 22.3 without beta-blockade vs 110.1 +/- 28.9 beats/min with beta-blockade, p < 0.001, and peak systolic blood pressure 137.9 +/- 26.8 mm Hg without beta-blockade vs 107.3 +/- 15.3 mm Hg with beta-blockade, p = 0.01), (2) an elimination of the physiologic effects of low-dose (5 and 10 microg/kg/min) dobutamine (-0.7 percent +/- 16.7 percent change in myocardial thickening from baseline with beta-blockade, p = NS), and (3) an elimination or alteration in timing of inducible wall motion abnormalities caused by severe coronary artery stenoses (mean termination dose 28.8 +/- 9.9 with beta-blockade vs 15.6 +/- 6.1 microg/kg/min without beta-blocker, p < 0.01). The findings in this canine model suggest that the competitive antagonist markedly attenuates the ability of dobutamine stress echocardiography to detect a significant coronary lesion and may alter its ability to detect viable myocardium at low-dose testing. Further clinical studies to determine the sensitivity of dobutamine stress echocardiography in the presence of beta-blockers and to establish protocol standards are necessary.", 
    "103": "The effect of methylprednisolone on the myocardial beta-adrenergic receptors after long term ( > 72 h) catecholamine infusion was studied. In 56 patients with pulmonary arterial catheter, 10 mg/kg of methylprednisolone was given as an intravenous bolus. Significant increases could be seen in cardiac output and blood pressure in patients who were simultaneously treated with vasopressors like dopamine and/or dobutamine. In patients who were on dopamine infusion higher than 10 micrograms/kg/min methylprednisolone there was an increase in the systemic vascular resistance. Patients who were not on vasopressors but received methylprednisolone, had no similar changes in hemodynamic parameters. In an in vitro analysis of tissue from the myocardium in 12/56 patients who succumbed and in four additional patients who expired after multiple trauma, a beta-adrenergic receptor assay was performed. It was found that the long term infusion of catecholamines decreased the receptor number and the methylprednisolone abolished or caused the decrease to be less pronounced. In this study we could not control the selection of the patients; a randomized study needs to be conducted in the future.",

The dose-dependence of AUC was investigated in 12 healthy volunteers (25, 50, 100, and 400 mg rac-talinolol as single p.o. doses). Concentration-dependence of the permeability across Caco-2 cell monolayers included concentrations from 0.1 to 2.0 mM, inhibition by verapamil was tested at 0.5 mM.", 
    "106": "The total clearance as well as the apparent oral clearance (CL/F) were slightly higher for S-(-)- than for R-(+)-talinolol. Calculation of the partial clearances showed that also the residual clearance was higher for the S- than for the R-enantiomer. In the healthy volunteers, CL/F increased with increasing doses, while the S/R ratio decreased approaching unity for the highest dose. Also the results from Caco-2 cell permeation studies yielded a clear concentration-dependence with decreasing stereoselectivity for the higher concentration range. Permeability of both enantiomers was considerably higher for b-->a than a-->b transport, however, this difference disappeared when verapamil was added.", 
    "107": "Although not very expressed, the detected stereoselectivities indicate a preferential absorption of R-(+)-talinolol in a lower concentration and dose range, which is most probably due to a moderate stereoselectivity at the carrier system involved in intestinal secretion.", 
    "108": "Supragingival plaque and calculus indices, salivary flow rates, pH, ionic and total calcium concentrations, total phosphate concentration, and the number of cervical restorations and caries lesions were measured in 29 subjects using systemic beta-(beta) blockers and in 28 subjects who were not taking any systemic medication. After 8 weeks of normal oral hygiene following an oral prophylaxis, a second comparison of each of the above quantities was made. With the exception of the calculus indices and the incidence of cervical restorations, no significant differences were found for any of the measured quantities between the medicated and non-medicated groups at either examination. The medicated group showed significantly lower mean calculus values than the non-medicated group at both examinations and a higher incidence of cervical restorations at the baseline examination, suggesting that beta-blockers decrease the rate of mineralization in the oral cavity. Since beta-blockers did not appear to alter stimulated salivary pH, flow rate, phosphate, ionic calcium or total calcium concentrations, their effect on the mineralization processes must be attributed to other mechanisms. Two hypotheses appear plausible: changes in salivary mineralization rates caused by either direct physico-chemical effects of the secreted beta-blockers in the saliva, or by alterations in the salivary protein/glycoprotein composition, enzymes and oral bacterial flora owing to systemic pharmacological effects of beta-blockers.",

Efficacy and tolerability of treatments were evaluated by clinical observation and rest and exercise radionuclide angiography. At the end of each individual study, it was decided blindly if and which of the 2 drugs seemed preferable, considering symptoms, undesired collateral effects and the results of exercise procedures.",

A significant reduction in resting LV function (that is, a decrease of LVEF > or = 5%) was observed in 2 patients on felodipine and 3 on nifedipine, but in both groups other 3 patients showed improvement in LVEF. During exercise, LVEF decreased 6.1 +/- 2.0% on placebo and 3.3 +/- 3.2% on nifedipine, while it increased 1.0 +/- 2.6% on felodipine (p < 0.01 vs. placebo). At the end of the study, felodipine was blindly judged superior to nifedipine in 10 patients, nifedipine was superior in 1 case, in the other 3 there was no clear difference (p < 0.02).",

The syndrome is complex in that it includes both peripheral and cardiac effects which contribute to the progression of heart failure. In the periphery, elevations in the sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin system increase afterload and contribute to further salt and water retention. The central cardiac abnormalities include remodeling of the heart and downregulation of beta receptors. Traditional heart failure therapy has included treatment of fluid retention with diuretics, although their effect on mortality has never been addressed. The most proven therapy in heart failure is treatment with vasodilators, particularly angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Improved survival with ACE-inhibitor therapy has been demonstrated in patients with severe heart failure (CONSENSUS), mild to moderate heart failure (SOLVD), and in comparison with vasodilator therapy with hydralazine isosorbide dinitrate (VHeFT II). Improved survival has also been noted in postmyocardial infarction when the ejection fraction is decreased (SAVE). The ACE inhibitors have now become standard therapy for heart failure regardless of severity. Additive vasodilator therapy with calcium-channel antagonists is under investigation. Inotropic therapy is controversial at present because of disappointing mortality results. The clinical mainstay digitalis remains without convincing mortality reduction data. Other inotropic agents, particularly phosphodiesterase inhibitors, have shown uniformly negative survival results. However, the new mixed action agents vesnarinone and pimobenden have shown favorable data, with vesnarinone demonstrating a mortality reduction effect. Beta-blocker therapy in heart failure has also found renewed interest, particularly with the new agents carvedolol and bucindolol which also have vasodilating properties.",

In the medial amygdala, when the same tetanic stimulation was applied in the presence of a beta-adrenoceptor agonist, isoproterenol, short-term potentiation was significantly enhanced and long-term potentiation was induced. Phenylephrine, an alpha-adrenoceptor agonist, did not affect short-term potentiation. The short-term potentiation-enhancing effect of isoproterenol was mimicked by forskolin, an adenylate cyclase activator, and was blocked by Rp-adenosine-3',5'-cyclic-monophosphothioate, an inhibitor of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. On the other hand, in the lateral amygdala, isoproterenol suppressed short-term potentiation. The short-term potentiation-suppressing effect of isoproterenol was mimicked by forskolin, and was blocked by Rp-adenosine-3',5'-cyclic-monophosphothioate. These results suggest that the beta-adrenoceptor-cyclic AMP system plays a role in facilitating the induction of long-term potentiation in the medial amygdala, but suppresses synaptic plasticity in the lateral amygdala.", 
    "132": "Heart failure is a physiopathological condition, with an increasing incidence and prevalence, involving the action of a series of mechanisms known as 'compensators', which are phylogenetically ready to normalize minute volume and blood pressure. These mechanisms include the activation of a series of neurohormonal systems: the sympathetic nervous system, the aldosterone renin-angiotensin system, vasopressin arginine, endothelin, which are basically vasoconstrictors, with the counterpoint of other vasodilator systems, such as the endothelial relaxation factor, certain prostaglandins and the bradykinin-kallikrein system, which modulate global response. The authors review the physiopathology of each of these systems, as well as their significance in the diagnosis and prognostic evaluation of heart failure. We analyze the possible deleterious effects of neurohormonal activation, anatomically and at the cardiovascular function level, and try to determine if they are capable of explaining the evolution and progression of heart failure, in a truly vicious circle, up until the irreversible heart failure phase. We review the current importance of the inhibition of the aldosterone renin-angiotensin system in the prophylaxis and treatment of heart failure. Furthermore, we describe the present-day value of the inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system in some forms of heart failure. We also analyze the different pharmacological treatment for heart failure: diuretics, inotropic agents, vasodilators (in their different pharmacological types), paying particular attention to their action on neurohormonal systems and their implications in the prognosis and evolution of heart failure.", 
    "133": "The effects of amosulalol, which blocks alpha 1 adrenoceptors selectively and beta receptors nonselectively almost to the same extent, on intraocular pressure (IOP) and aqueous humor dynamics were studied in pigmented rabbits. Administration of topical amosulalol (0.5%) resulted in a significant difference in IOP between the treated and the contralateral eyes from 0.5 to 6 hours, and the maximum IOP reduction, 6.0 +/- 0.4 mmHg (mean +/- standard error), was observed at 2 hours after administration. Aqueous humor dynamics measurements (mean +/- standard error) in the amosulalol (0.5%)-treated and the contralateral eyes revealed that total outflow facility determined by the two-level constant pressure perfusion method was not significantly different, 0.14 +/- 0.01 and 0.12 +/- 0.01 microliter/min/mmHg, respectively; the aqueous flow measurements determined by fluorophotometry were 3.0 +/- 0.1 and 3.4 +/- 0.2 microliters/min, respectively (p < 0.05, -11%); the uveoscleral outflow measurements determined by the fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran perfusion method were 0.53 +/- 0.04 and 0.46 +/- 0.04 microliter/min, respectively (p < 0.05, +15%). In conclusion, amosulalol lowers the IOP by inhibiting aqueous production and increasing uveoscleral outflow."
