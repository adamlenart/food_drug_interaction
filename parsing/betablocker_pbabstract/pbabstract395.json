The effect of single doses was evaluated with paired bicycle ergometries (PBE); that of course therapy was assessed with crossover randomized placebo-controlled tests of the two agents. During PBE, an adequate antianginal effect of Pd given in single doses of 0.04-0.08 g was seen in 66.5% and that of Pr used in the same doses was observed in 58.4% (p > 0.05). The exercise tolerance in patients given either agent in a single dose was similar. During 1-month course treatment with Pd in a mean daily dose of 186 +/- 24 mg, anginal episodes caused an over 3-fold reduction, which is similar to the clinical effect displayed by Pr, 182 +/- 25 mg/day. A single dose of Pd of 0.04 g produced a more pronounced chronotropic and antihypertensive effect than did the same dose of Pr. No differences were found during their course therapy. Pd was found to cause no orthostatic antihypertensive phenomenon.", 
    "1": "The paper presents the results of the first phase of clinical trials of prodoxolol, a beta-adrenoblocker having alpha-adrenoblocking activity in a ratio of 100:1, in patients with coronary heart disease concurrent with stable exercise-induced angina pectoris. The tolerance of single proxodolol doses (10 mg in 4 patients, 20 mg in 2 and 40 mg in 2) was studied. In all cases, proxodolol reduced resting heart rate by 6-18 beats/min, which lasted for 5 hours or more. Four patients had a proxodolol-induced 20 mm Hg or more decrease in systolic blood pressure lasting for 5 hours. In 10 patients, the antianginal and anti-ischemic effects of proxodolol were evaluated by pharmaco-dynamic studies consisting in threshold treadmill exercise tests before and 30 min, 2 and 6 hours after single placebo (in 10 patients) and proxodolol (40 and 80 mg in 3 and 7 patients, respectively) administration. In addition, 7 patients underwent pharmacodynamic studies with propranolol, 80 mg. The efficacy was judged from the increased exercise duration before an anginal episode (antianginal effect) and from the decreased ST segment depression during the identical exercise (anti-ischemic effect). The antianginal effect of proxodolol began 30 min later, reaching its peak 2 hours later and retained 6 hours later. During all study periods it was more marked than that of propranolol. The anti-ischemic effect of proxodolol was similar to the antianginal effects and it did not correlated with its chronotropic one. Proxodolol was well tolerated with patients. Thus, proxodolol in single doses of 40 and 80 mg produced antianginal and anti-ischemic effects and its action was similar to that of propranolol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "2": "The antihypertensive efficacy and hemodynamic effects of the new hybrid (beta-, alpha-) adrenoceptor blocking agent proxodolol were studied in 74 patients with mild, moderate, and severe arterial hypertension who received a single dose of 10, 20, or 40 mg. Oral and intravenous proxodolol showed a significant dose-dependent antihypertensive action which was independent of the type of hemodynamics and manifested itself by decreasing cardiac output.", 
    "3": "The clinical and instrumental investigations of 38 patients with mild and moderate arterial hypertension have shown that therapy with proxodolol in a daily dose of 120 mg results in correction of blood pressure in 79% of the patients. Proxodolol lowers blood pressure and total peripheral vascular resistance, diminished heart rate and causes some changes in pump functional parameters for the worse. The efficacy and tolerance of proxolol are similar to those of trandate and albetol.", 
    "4": "The new original Russian drug proxodolol having alpha- and beta-adrenoblocking activities in a ratio of 1:100 was examined at Stages I and II of clinical trials. The drug was given to 29 male patients aged 30-63 years who suffered from Stages I and II persistent hypertensive disease with a baseline diastolic blood pressure of >95 mm Hg. Proxodolol as 10- and 40-mg tablets was demonstrated to be an effective antihypertensive agent, its antihypertensive effects being revealed in acute and chronic uses. The drug was well tolerated by the patients, causing no significant adverse reactions. Further comprehensive comparative controlled studies of proxodolol including larger patient groups will define the contribution of the drug in long-term antihypertensive prophylaxis.", 
    "5": "In non-inbred rats, the pharmacokinetics of proxodolol was studied after its intravenous administration in a dose of 1 mg/kg or oral use in a dose of 50 mg/kg as 1% aqueous solution, in Chinchilla rabbits, it was examined after intravenous administration in a dose of 1 mg/kg as 1% aqueous solution and oral use in a dose of 40-50 mg/kg as 40-mg tablets. The equilibrium dialysis method was applied to explore proxodolol binding to human and rat serum proteins in vitro. Proxodolol was demonstrated to be slightly distributed in the rat peripheral tissues and more actively in the rabbits (the stationary distribution volume was 0.264 and 2.27 1/kg, respectively). After intravenous injection, the total proxodolol clearance in the rats and the rabbits was 0.229 and 2.24 1/h/kg, the area beneath the concentration-time curve was 5702 and 964 ng/h/ml, the terminal half-life was 1.44 and 1.49 h, the mean retention time was 1.16 and 1.52 h, respectively. The pattern of rabbit serum proxodolol concentration curves after intravenous infusion suggests that the drug shows enterohepatic recirculation. After oral administration, the drug was rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract; the maximum concentration time was 0.58 h in rats and 0.70 h in rabbits. The mean absorption time was 0.77 and 0.64 h in rats and in rabbits, respectively. The absolute proxodolol bioavailability was determined to be 3.51 and 3.02% in rats and in rabbits, respectively. The in vitro serum protein-binding of proxodolol was 34% in rats and 66% in man.",

Proxodolol given in beta-adreno-blocking doses similar to those of labetalol was shown to exert vasodilating effects in normotensive rats. Renal, adrenal, splenic, and skeletal muscle vessels were most sensitive to labetalol, whereas cardiac and pulmonary vessels were responsive to proxodolol. In rats with persistent renovascular hypertension, proxodolol had a vasodilating effect only when it was used in doses inducing alpha-adrenoceptor blockade.", 
    "7": "The beta- and alpha-adrenoceptor blocking activity, the specificity of its beta-adrenoceptor blocking action, partial agonistic and membrane-stabilizing properties, as well as antihypertensive, antiarrhythmic, and anti-ischemic effects were studied. Proxodolol was shown to be superior to labetalol in its beta-adrenoceptor blocking action and similar to it in its alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agent. The drug has no a partial agonistic activity and produces a moderate membrane-stabilizing action. Proxodolol proved to be effective in treating experimental hypertension and arrhythmias. It exhibits anti-ischemic activity.",

The most potent compound is 3-methyl-5-[2-(3-tret.butylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy) phenoxymethyl]-1,2,4-oxadiazole (Compound 1, prodolol) which is superior to propranolol, oxprenolol, and particularly labetalol in its beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity. The agent does not greatly differ from labetalol in its alpha-adrenoblocking activity. Proxodolol has been chosen for preclinical and clinical studies.", 
    "9": "The hypothesis that the long-term use of beta-blockers improves symptoms, cardiac function, and ejection fraction in patients with heart failure is increasingly being accepted. Multiple small studies have consistently demonstrated favorable outcomes with beta-blocker use, and a large-scale mortality study is now planned. However, important questions remain regarding which patients with heart failure should be treated and the mechanism by which beta-blockade exerts its beneficial effects. These questions undoubtedly need to be answered before physicians will be willing to prescribe these medications, the use of which is so counterintuitive.",

The blood flow in the iris and ciliary body was detected by laser-Doppler flowmetry (bpm, 403a; TSI; wavelength, 780 nm; power, < 1.6 mW). The blood flow in the ophthalmic artery was measured by pulsed Doppler sonography (4 MHz, EME). The blood pressure, pulse respiration, and intraocular pressure (IOP) were recorded. Vascular resistance (RF) was calculated by the equation RF = (RRmean--IOP)/blood flow. Group 1 was treated with a single drop of Betamann (3 mg/ml) applied topically, and group 2 was treated with Isoglaucon (2.5 mg/ml). Measurements were made before and 30 min after application. Both drugs significantly lowered the IOP by about 7% (P = 0.01). Clonidine did not affect the blood velocity in the ophthalmic artery. In group 2 (metipranolol) we found a significant increase in the blood velocity in the ophthalmic artery during the diastolic period (from 11.0 +/- 3.7 to 11.9 +/- 2.2 cm/s, P = 0.05). Both clonidine and metipranolol decreased the iridal blood flow [clonidine, from 9.3 +/- 3.9 to 7.6 +/- 3.1 (flux), P = 0.05; metipranolol, from 7.5 +/- 2.9 to 6.5 +/- 2.6 (flux), P = 0.05].

    "11": "Essential tremor (ET) is typically 4 to 12 Hz frequency, absent at rest, maximal during maintenance of a posture, attenuated during movement and often accentuated at the termination of movement. Prevalence in Americans is 300 to 415 per 100,000 population, and it is frequently disabling. There is controversy about the central or peripheral origin of ET. There is no specific diagnostic test for ET; the diagnosis is made clinically. Ethanol is the most effective suppressor of ET. Treatment is with beta-adrenergic blockers, primidone, and benzodiazepines. The first systematic description of essential tremor (ET) was 100 years ago by Dana in 1887, who regarded the disorder as a hereditary tremor that was a form of \"motor neurosis.\" Most subsequent contributions to the English literature consisted predominantly of case reports until Critchley's exhaustive survey of the subject in 1949. The disorder has been variously termed essential, benign essential, hereditary, familial, idiopathic, juvenile, presenile or senile tremor.",

The present study was undertaken to characterize the beta 3-adrenoceptor agonist activity of ICI-215001 and to determine whether it exhibits additional activities on beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors in isolated spontaneously beating atrium, trachea and ileum of guinea-pig. 2. In guinea-pig atrium, isoprenaline, a non-selective beta-adrenoceptor agonist, caused concentration-dependent, positive chronotropic effects that were inhibited by atenolol, a selective beta 1-antagonist. ICI-215001 also competitively antagonized the increase in heart rate caused by isoprenaline. 3. ICI-215001 exhibited low intrinsic activity at increasing the beating rate of atrium and no activity on resting or induced tone of tracheal strips. 4. In strips of guinea-pig trachea, contracted submaximally with carbachol, isoprenaline, caused concentration-dependent relaxations. Both ICI-118551, a selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, and ICI-215001 competitively inhibited the relaxations caused by isoprenaline. 5. In isolated strips of guinea-pig ileum longitudinal smooth muscle contracted with histamine, isoprenaline and ICI-215001 caused relaxations which were inhibited by alprenolol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with modest affinity for beta 3-adrenoceptors, but were resistant to ICI-118551 and atenolol. 6. These results indicate that ICI-215001 exhibits beta 3-adrenoceptor agonist activity as demonstrated by relaxations mediated via atypical beta-adrenoceptors in the longitudinal smooth muscle of guinea-pig ileum. Further, the studies demonstrate that ICI-215001 can act as an antagonist at beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors in situations where its intrinsic agonist activity is low.", 
    "13": "This review describes circadian patterns in cardiovascular disease processes and analyses the findings of recent studies. The awareness of an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death in the early morning hours, shortly after waking, has stimulated an interest in the relationship of these events and the occurrence of both silent and symptomatic myocardial ischaemia. A number of studies have been reported that examine both the physiological triggers and the underlying causes of these events. Beta-adrenergic blockers have been shown to abolish the early morning peak of myocardial infarction and blunt the morning peak in sudden cardiac death. Newer calcium antagonists, such as amlodipine, have been demonstrated to control angina throughout a 24-hour period. Aspirin is effective in preventing morning infarction. It is a reasonable aim for investigators to extend progress in the treatment of cardiovascular disease to include prevention.",

    "16": "Using an immunohistochemical method dopamine-beta-hydroxylase-positive neurones were found in the papillary muscle and right atrial appendage sample. The release of noradrenaline from the papillary muscle, associated with axonal activity, was enhanced by 7,8(methylenedioxy)-14-alpha-hydroxyalloberbane HCl (CH-38083), a selective alpha 2 adrenoceptor antagonist, and inhibited by xylazine, an alpha 2 adrenoceptor agonist, indicating that negative feedback modulation was functioning. In addition, the release of [3H]NA was enhanced by atropine, pancuronium, and 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide (4-DAMP), a selective M3 muscarinic receptor antagonist, and reduced by oxotremorine, a selective muscarinic receptor agonist, indicating that acetylcholine released from the parasympathetic nerve ending was able to reach the varicose noradrenergic axon terminals that are equipped with inhibitory M3 muscarinic receptors.", 
    "17": "These findings, obtained for the first time in human papillary muscle, indicate that the release of noradrenaline is modulated by alpha 2 autoreceptors activated by noradrenaline and M3 muscarinic heteroreceptors. Thus during parasympathetic stimulation the release of noradrenaline from the sympathetic axon terminals is presynaptically controlled through muscarinic receptors.", 
    "18": "Topical beta adrenergic receptor blocking agents (beta blockers) are among the most frequently prescribed ophthalmic drugs. It has been suggested that some of these agents have a toxic effect on the corneal epithelium. In the present study, four beta blockers in common therapeutic concentrations, as well as their vehicles, were applied to rabbit corneas that had undergone mechanical removal of epithelium from a 6 mm diameter corneal wound. The tested drugs (0.25% timolol, 0.25% levobunolol, 0.25% betaxolol, and 0.3% metipranolol) were found significantly to accelerate wound closure, compared with saline treatment in controls. Eyes treated with two of the vehicles (betaxolol vehicle and metipranolol vehicle) also demonstrated more rapid healing than controls, but the magnitude of the effect was not as great as that seen with the drugs. Only the beta blockers were responsible for wound closure before 60 hours, whereas the saline treated controls and vehicle treated eyes required longer times for wound closure. In this model of wound healing, beta blockers appear to have no deleterious effect on corneal epithelial wound healing.",

TZC-5665 showed negative chronotropic and inotropic effects, whereas M-2 showed a potent positive inotropic effect with a slight positive chronotropic effect. The positive inotropic effect of M-2 was not modified by phentolamine, propranolol and cimetidine, but completely depressed by carbachol. In blood-perfused dog heart preparations, M-2 increased the contractile force and coronary blood flow of paced papillary muscles and sinus rate. Although TZC-5665 scarcely affected the contractile force and sinus rate, it increased coronary blood flow. TZC-5665 scarcely affected atrio-ventricular (AV) conduction time, whereas M-2 slightly shortened AV conduction time. The rate of ventricular automaticity was slightly increased by M-2, but suppressed by TZC-5665 at higher doses. TZC-5665 showed a non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity comparable to that of propranolol in guinea-pig atrial and tracheal preparations. In enzyme preparations, TZC-5665 and M-2 were more potent and selective inhibitors of phosphodiesterase (PDE) III than milrinone. Combination of beta-adrenoceptor blocking effect of TZC-5665 and positive inotropic effect of M-2 could be useful in the treatment of congestive heart failure by mutual prevention of undesirable effects.",

The next day, the exercise and sampling procedure were repeated after an oral dose of propranolol (40 mg).", 
    "23": "Patients tolerated exercise poorly after beta blockade, which was reflected in the maximum workload reached. Heart rate and blood pressure were significantly higher at rest and during exercise before beta blockade. Although there was no significant difference when resting, mean (SEM) noradrenaline concentrations during peak exercise were higher after beta blockade (16.2 (2) v 23.6 (2.9) nmol/l, p = 0.001). Adrenaline concentrations at peak exercise were also greater after beta blockade (0.89 (0.31) v 1.18 (0.38) nmol/l, p = 0.055). Atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations tended to be higher after beta blockade (118.75 (50.2) v 169.79 (39.3) pmol/l, p = 0.36). There was no significant change in plasma renin activity.", 
    "24": "A small oral dose of a competitive beta blocker such as propranolol has an adverse effect on exercise tolerance and cardiovascular response to exercise in cardiac transplant recipients. There are also increased concentrations of circulating noradrenaline and therefore, sympathetic activity during exercise. beta blockers should be used with caution in cardiac transplant recipients.", 
    "25": "The management of migraine usually centers on two approaches: preventive and abortive therapy. Preventive therapy, designed to reduce the frequency, duration, and intensity of attacks, can be accomplished through a wide variety of medications. The most commonly used are beta-blockers, but calcium channel blockers, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents have all been used with success. Agents used in abortive migraine therapy treat the intensity and duration of pain, as well as the associated symptoms. New treatment options have been developed, including such newly approved medications as sumatriptan. Sumatriptan is a very effective agent that has joined the ranks of other effective abortive migraine treatments, such as ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, as well as narcotic analgesics. New delivery systems, such as the nasal-spray formulation of butorphanol, allow for a route of administration previously unavailable to migraine sufferers. These new and developing treatment modalities will give physicians a wider choice of outpatient therapy options.",

Heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), stroke volume (SV) and cardiac output (Q) were measured (the latter two by Doppler ultrasonography) every 1 min for 5 min after injection of either placebo or esmolol 100 mg or 200 mg. HR, MAP, SV and Q decreased significantly (P < 0.05) for both esmolol groups compared with placebo and, except for MAP, esmolol 200 mg had a greater effect than esmolol 100 mg (P < 0.05).

The application of these findings to humans remains to be elucidated.", 
    "31": "Therapy with racemic compounds produces effects that can be attributed to both (S)- and (R)-enantiomers. Here we have tested the hypothesis that an enantiomer-enantiomer interaction would modulate the effects of treatment with a racemate, the antiarrhythmic propafenone. Previous studies have shown that while the enantiomers of propafenone exert similar sodium channel-blocking (QRS widening) effects, it is the (S)-enantiomer that produces beta-blockade; moreover, we have demonstrated recently that (R)-propafenone inhibits the metabolism of (S)-propafenone in vitro.",

The clearance of (S)-propafenone was significantly lower (-55 +/- 24%, P < .001) during treatment with (R/S)-propafenone than with the (S)-enantiomer alone, and delta HRmax was significantly altered during (R/S)-propafenone (-8.8 +/- 6.6 beats per minute; P < .01) and during (S)-propafenone (-4.3 +/- 4.8 beats per minute; P < .01) but not during (R)-propafenone (-1.8 +/- 6.4 beats per minute) or placebo (0.3 +/- 7.1 beats per minute).

As a result, the beta-blocking effects of 150 mg of racemic propafenone (75 mg of the [S]-enantiomer) were more pronounced than those of 150 mg of (S)-propafenone alone. Thus, the effects of racemic drug therapy are not necessarily those predicted by summation of the effects of the individual enantiomers.", 
    "34": "In the recovery period after strenuous exercise, there is an increase in O2 uptake termed the excess post-exercise O2 consumption (EPOC), consisting of a rapid and a prolonged component. Mechanisms regulating the prolonged component of EPOC are not completely understood, but an effect of catecholamines has been suggested. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of beta-adrenoceptor blockade on EPOC. Six healthy young men were randomized to one control experiment and two exercise experiments, one with and one without nonselective beta-adrenoceptor blockade. In the exercise experiments, they exercised for 60 minutes at 78% +/- 3% (mean +/- SD) of maximal O2 uptake (VO2max) on a cycle ergometer followed by 6.5 hours' bedrest. In the beta-adrenoceptor blockade experiment, propranolol (0.1 mg.kg-1 body weight [BW]) was administered intravenously immediately after the exercise bout and again 3.5 hours after exercise. The control experiment was performed without exercise or beta-adrenoceptor blockade. EPOC was calculated as the difference in O2 uptake between the exercise and control experiments. A supplementary study on 15 subjects showed resting O2 uptake to be unaffected by propranolol. O2 uptake was significantly increased during the recovery period after exercise when no beta-adrenoceptor blocker was administered. After 6.5 hours of bedrest, the mean increase (+/- SE) in O2 uptake was 19 +/- 4 mL.min-1. In contrast, when propranolol was administered during recovery from exercise, O2 uptake was significantly increased for only the first 2 hours. Propranolol decreased total EPOC (+/- SE) by about one third, from 14.4 +/- 1.9 to 9.5 +/- 2.5 L.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

A second aim was to determine possible gender differences in fibrinolytic activity among patients with hypertension. Ninety-nine patients (58 women [88% post-menopausal] and 41 men) had drug-treated hypertension. In women, hypertension was a positive, independent predictor of the major inhibitors of fibrinolysis, plasminogen activator inhibitor antigen (p = 0.017), and plasminogen activator inhibitor activity (p = 0.004). In men and women, major risk factors for atherosclerosis were significant, independent predictors of reduced basal fibrinolysis. Median Lp(a) in the 99 patients with hypertension (16 mg/dL) did not differ from Lp(a) (18 mg/dL) in normotensive patients (p > 0.1). Of the 385 patients, the 39 beta blocker users had higher plasminogen activator inhibitor activity (p = 0.01), higher triglyceride (p = 0.02) levels, and higher Quetelet Indices (p = 0.01) than non-users (n = 346). After covariance adjusting for age, Quetelet Indices, sex, and triglycerides, plasminogen activator inhibitor activity was not higher in beta blocker users than in non-users (p > 0.1). Median Lp(a) did not differ in beta blocker users (16 mg/dL) and in non-users (17 mg/dL), p greater than 0.1.

    "36": "Several studies have suggested that beta-blockade could provide functional benefit in heart failure, suggesting a deleterious role for the compensatory sympathetic stimulation. Beta-blockade induced benefit could result from either antagonism of any myocardial beta-adrenergic stimulation or on the opposite a paradoxical cardiac beta-adrenergic responsiveness secondary to beta-adrenergic receptor up-regulation. Two recently completed large scale multicentric placebo controlled studies, the MDC trial with metoprolol and CIBIS with bisoprolol, have confirmed that beta-blockade could functionally improve patients with heart failure. The observed survival improvement in non ischemic patients was observed only in the CIBIS trial. Such a result must be confirmed with additional studies.", 
    "37": "Previous studies with direct-acting serotonin (5-HT) agonists and antagonists have demonstrated that stimulation of 5-HT1A, 5-HT1C and 5-HT2 receptors may promote cortisol and prolactin (PRL) secretion in man. There is also evidence that 5-HT1C/2 receptor stimulation contributes to the cortisol and PRL responses following administration of the 5-HT precursor, L-5-hydroxytryptophan (L-5-HTP), in man. To clarify the possible contribution of 5-HT1A receptor stimulation to the ability of L-5-HTP to stimulate cortisol and PRL secretion in man, the effect of pindolol, a beta adrenoceptor antagonist that is also a 5-HT1A partial agonist, on the L-5-HTP-induced increases in cortisol and PRL secretion, was examined in 12 normal male volunteers. Pretreatment with pindolol, 30 mg orally, significantly inhibited the PRL but not the cortisol response to L-5-HTP, 200 mg PO. Pindolol alone decreased basal plasma PRL levels and increased basal plasma cortisol levels, possibly due to 5-HT1A antagonist and agonists effects, respectively. These data, coupled with observations from other studies, suggest that the L-5-HTP-induced increase in PRL but not cortisol secretion requires 5-HT1A receptor activation. PRL secretion due to 5-HT formed from exogenous L-5-HTP may require the availability of both intact 5-HT1A and 5-HT2/5-HT1C receptors, since blockade of either receptor type inhibited the PRL response to L-5-HTP. The implication of this synergistic effect for interpretation of neuroendocrine studies involving the serotonergic system in man is discussed.", 
    "38": "The effects of the active metabolite (18-502) of bopindolol, which is a new nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, were studied on the ischemic changes in myocardial segment shortening, cardiac lactate metabolism and S-T segment of subendocardial electrocardiogram during coronary stenosis and on their recoveries after reperfusion in anesthetized dogs, and were compared with those of propranolol at a dose exhibiting a comparable degree of beta 1-blocking activity. In the presence of coronary stenosis, intravenous administration of 18-502 (5 micrograms/kg) and propranolol (0.2 mg/kg), but not saline, produced significant improvements of regional myocardial dysfunction, lactate production and S-T segment elevations in the ischemic myocardium, which were associated with significant decreases in heart rate and cardiac contractility. After release of the stenosis, administration of 18-502, but not propranolol, resulted in a significantly accelerated recovery of the ischemic segment function as compared with the control group. In rat heart homogenates, 18-502 inhibited the lipid peroxidation approximately 4 times more potently than propranolol. These data show that 18-502 exerts favorable effects during myocardial ischemia produced by coronary stenosis and that it has a cardioprotective action against the contractile dysfunction following reperfusion.", 
    "39": "In previous experiments on male rats we showed that 2 mg kg-1, intravenously, lipopolysaccharide from Escherichia coli, a sublethal nonhypotensive dose, induced circulating cardiodepressant activity, maximal alterations in steroid hormonal response, and myocardial adenylate cyclase hyperactivity 4 h later. The purpose of the present study was to investigate a possible relation between this adenylate cyclase hyperactivity and alterations in total ventricular beta-adrenoceptors. To this end, ventricular beta-adrenoceptor concentration and affinity were measured under the same conditions. Binding assays were performed using [3H]dihydroalprenolol. No significant change was observed in both parameters.", 
    "40": "The studies were performed on healthy closed-chest chloralose-anaesthetized dogs using catheterization, extracorporal perfusion and resistography of coronary arteries and catheterization and continuous drainage of the coronary sinus. Insulin (0.1 and 1.0 IU/kg, i.v.) injected to healthy animals produced dose-dependent biphasic cardiohaemodynamic reactions. The first phase of the reaction includes transient (5-10 min) cardiac function strengthening, coronary arteries constriction, heart rate acceleration, myocardial oxygen consumption elevation, coronary sinus blood pH elevation and pO2 decrease. After that there arises more prolonged and constant dilation of coronary arteries reduction of the cardiac function, slowing of the heart rate, lowering of the myocardial oxygen consumption, decrease of cardiac venous blood pH and increase of pO2, reduction of T waves magnitude and ST segments shifts both in standard and breast leads. The second phase of the reaction is either attenuated or even absent after blockade of beta-adrenoceptors (propranolol, 0.5 mg/kg, i.v.). The results indicate that insulin effects on cardiohaemodynamics are realized through the interaction between insulin and heart and vessels of the adrenergic system.", 
    "41": "We wished to elucidate the effect of beta-blockade on fibrillatory rate and atrioventricular (AV) nodal concealed conduction during atrial fibrillation (AF). Subsequent to determination of the effect on atrial functional refractoriness with the extrastimulus technique (basic cycle length 400 ms), the effect of metoprolol (0.3 mg/kg) on atrial fibrillatory rate was determined in 8 open-chest pigs with metacholine-facilitated AF. Once stable AF was established, fibrillatory rate was recorded with a bipolar epicardial electrode, together with the ventricular response during 500 ventricular intervals. For each episode of AF, three indexes were calculated to determine the degree of concealed conduction: the ratio of the longest to the shortest ventricular interval, the ratio of the median ventricular interval to the median atrial interval, and the coefficient of variation of the ventricular intervals. Metoprolol decreased fibrillatory rate (571-432 beats/min, p < 0.01), suggesting a proportionate increase (+32%) in atrial functional refractoriness during AF that far exceeded the increase (+7%) during sinus rhythm (217-233 ms, p < 0.05). None of the indexes of concealed conduction was affected by metoprolol. Metoprolol decreases fibrillatory rate in AF, possibly due in part to its class I effect, causing rate-dependent prolongation of atrial refractoriness. Despite reducing fibrillatory rate, metoprolol does not affect AV nodal concealed conduction measurably. Our results support the assumption that the reducing effect of beta-blockers on ventricular rate during AF is due to direct prolongation of AV nodal refractoriness.", 
    "42": "We have found previously that arotinolol, an alpha/beta-adrenergic blocker, increases blood flow in brown adipose tissue (BAT) in a similar extent as BRL 26830A, a beta 3-adrenoceptor agonist. We tested the hypothesis that arotinolol activates thermogenesis in BAT, leading to weight loss in monosodium-L-glutamate-induced (MSG-induced) obese mice and saline-treated controls. Six weeks of standard animal feed (CE-2) containing arotinolol hydrochloride (350 mg/kg CE-2), which reduced mean blood pressure in MSG-treated mice, significantly increased the mitochondrial protein content in BAT, and activated the specific and total binding of guanosine-5'-diphosphate (GDP) in BAT mitochondria, leading to a reduction of obesity in both MSG- and saline-treated mice vs. the control groups fed with CE-2 diet alone. However, six weeks of CE-2 diet containing propranolol hydrochloride (525 mg/kg CE-2) a non-selective beta-blocker, markedly reduced the specific and total binding of GDP in BAT mitochondria, leading to weight gain in both MSG- and saline-treated mice. These findings support the hypothesis, that arotinolol activates BAT thermogenesis, leading to weight loss.", 
    "43": "We report a patient with congenital long QT syndrome in whom early afterdepolarizations (EADs) were demonstrated on monophasic action potential (MAP) recordings in the left ventricular mid-base inferior wall. Epinephrine infusion at 5 micrograms/min increased the amplitude of the EADs and the late component of the T(U) wave. Epinephrine also induced ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) with right bundle branch block morphology and left-axis deviation that occurred from the peak of the EADs. Verapamil injection (5 mg) during continuous epinephrine infusion abolished all VPCs with a slight reduction in the amplitude of the EADs. Propranolol injection (5 mg) in addition to verapamil further reduced the amplitude of the EADs and the late component of the T(U) wave. These findings suggest that the epinephrine-induced VPCs were closely related to triggered rhythm arising from the EADs, and that both verapamil and propranolol were effective for the suppression of VPCs and EADs.", 
    "44": "In summary, the Class III antiarrhythmic agents amiodarone and sotalol are effective in restoring sinus rhythm in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation with a higher effectiveness of amiodarone. Both agents successfully prevent recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation after electrical cardioversion and both can control heart rate in persistent atrial fibrillation. Amiodarone appears to be particularly suitable in patients with atrial fibrillation and concomitant congestive heart failure because it lacks clinically relevant negative inotropic activity. Both substances are also effective in controlling ventricular arrhythmias that are frequently present in patients with atrial fibrillation. Finally, both drugs possess antiadrenergic activity, which makes the substances particularly attractive in patients with coronary heart disease as the underlying cause of atrial fibrillation.", 
    "45": "The aim was to determine whether regional differences in arterial responses to vasoconstrictor and vasorelaxant agonists exist within the minipig coronary vasculature.", 
    "46": "Hearts were obtained from miniature pigs (20-40 kg) immediately after death. First and third order arterial branches of the left anterior descending artery were dissected from within the subepicardium and mounted as ring preparations in a small vessel myograph for measurement of isometric tension under standardised conditions. Contractile responses to acetylcholine, noradrenaline, and U46619, and the relaxation responses to noradrenaline, bradykinin, and substance P were measured. Arterial tone was increased with KCl or acetylcholine prior to addition of vasodilator agonists.", 
    "47": "First order branches were more sensitive to the constrictor influence of acetylcholine than third order branches [pD2 values 6.42(SEM 0.07), n = 13, and 6.26(0.07), n = 13, for first and third order respectively, p < 0.05]. U46619 did not induce contractile responses in arteries less than 210 microns in diameter. Noradrenaline only induced small contractile responses in the presence of propranolol following removal of the endothelium. In arteries preconstricted with 40 mM KCl, noradrenaline induced relaxation which was inhibited by propranolol and was uninfluenced by arterial calibre. In the presence of propranolol, noradrenaline-mediated relaxations of acetylcholine-preconstricted arteries were endothelium dependent and alpha 2 adrenoceptor mediated, and greater in first order than in third order branches [58(5)%, n = 9, and 26(8)%, n = 9, for first and third order branches respectively, p < 0.05]. Relaxations mediated by bradykinin and substance P were not influenced significantly by arterial calibre but were greater in arteries preconstricted with acetylcholine than with KCl.", 
    "48": "In isolated minipig coronary arteries the vasoconstrictor responses to acetylcholine and U46619, and the endothelium dependent, noradrenaline mediated relaxations, differ according to the branching order studied. These data provide further evidence for a regional heterogeneity of vascular responses in the porcine coronary vasculature.", 
    "49": "The incidence and consequences of inappropriate sinus tachycardia following modification of the AV nodal area with radiofrequency energy were prospectively studied in a consecutive series of 118 patients. Twelve (10%) patients developed this complication, which persisted less than 1 week in all but three patients. Inappropriate sinus tachycardia was only observed after fast pathway ablation. Only four patients required temporary treatment with a beta blocker.", 
    "50": "Influence of arotinolol hydrochloride and atenolol on the balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems was evaluated in 8 hypertensive subjects by spectral analysis of heart rate (HR) and systemic blood pressure (BP). Before and after administration of either arotinolol (n = 7) or atenolol (n = 7) for 2 weeks, BP was continuously and non-invasively monitored by a finger-cuff manometry (Finapres). A time series of instantaneous HR was constructed from the BP signal. A time series of mean BP was also constructed. Spectral analysis was performed by the use of an autoregressive algorithm on these time series (approximately 180 sec). Each spectrum was subdivided into low-(0.05-0.15 Hz, LF) and high-frequency (0.15-0.4 Hz, HF) components, and each component was divided by the sum of the two for normalization. As a measure of the balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, the ratio of LF to HF (LF/HF) was evaluated. Arotinolol increased fractional HF in the HR spectrum from 0.45 +/- 0.12 to 0.73 +/- 0.08 (p < 0.01) and decreased fractional LF from 0.55 +/- 0.12 to 0.27 +/- 0.08 (p < 0.01); consequently, it decreased LF/HF from 1.4 +/- 0.5 to 0.4 +/- 0.2 (p < 0.01). Atenolol had similar effects on these parameters. Neither of these beta-adrenergic blockades produced a discernible decrease in LF/HF in the BP spectrum. In conclusion, these beta-adrenergic blockades decreased LF/HF in the HR spectrum in hypertensive subjects, which suggests that they improved the balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems.", 
    "51": "Functional role and anatomic location of nitroxidergic nerves were determined in dog retinal arteries and arterioles. Isolated retinal central arteries responded to nicotine with relaxations that were not influenced by atropine, timolol, or indomethacin and damage of the endothelium, but were abolished by hexamethonium, methylene blue, and oxyhemoglobin. The relaxation was abolished by NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA), a nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor, and was restored by L-arginine. Relaxations caused by NO were not affected by L-NNA. Transmural electrical stimulation at 5 Hz relaxed the strips; the relaxation was abolished by L-NNA and tetrodotoxin. In anesthetized dogs, intraarterial injections of nicotine dilated retinal arterioles in the fundus oculi. This effect was abolished by L-NNA and restored by L-arginine. Intravenous injections of L-NNA constricted retinal arterioles, the effect being prevented by hexamethonium. There were nerve bundles and fibers containing NO synthase immunoreactivity in the adventitia and media in the retinal artery. These findings are consistent with our hypothesis that NO liberated from vasodilator nerves acts as neurotransmitter in dog retinal arteries and arterioles, and the arteriolar muscle tone is regulated by vasodilator nerve activity in vivo.", 
    "52": "Propranolol and sphingosine exhibit several common biochemical effects, including inhibition of phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase and protein kinase C (PKC) activities. In NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, sphingosine has also been shown to stimulate phospholipase D (PLD)-mediated hydrolysis of both phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) (Kiss Z and Anderson WB, J Biol Chem 265: 7345-7350, 1990). The present study demonstrates that in [14C]palmitic acid-labeled NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, propranolol (50-100 microM) and sphingosine had similar stimulatory effects on PLD-mediated synthesis of phosphatidylethanol in the presence of ethanol. In [14C]choline- and [14C]-ethanolamine-labeled fibroblasts, both compounds also stimulated the hydrolysis of both [14C]PtdCho and [14C]PtdEtn. However, while sphingosine preferentially stimulated PtdEtn hydrolysis, propranolol had greater effects on PtdCho hydrolysis. At each time point examined (15-45 min), lower concentrations (25-50 microM) of propranolol and 100 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) synergistically enhanced PtdEtn hydrolysis; a higher concentration (100 microM) of propranolol inhibited this PMA effect only when the incubation time was 45 min. On the other hand, propranolol (10-100 microM) had either no effect or it inhibited PMA-induced PtdCho hydrolysis after treatments for 15 or 45 min, respectively. These potentiating and inhibitory actions of propranolol on the hydrolysis of PtdCho and PtdEtn were similarly elicited by sphingosine. The present study identified the PLD system as another common target for the pharmacological actions of sphingosine and propranolol.", 
    "53": "The stimulation of glycogen degradation by adrenergic agonists and glucagon was determined in hepatocytes isolated from the periportal and perivenous zones of rat liver and maintained in culture. Glucagon, epinephrine and phenylephrine (an alpha-adrenergic receptor agonist) caused a greater stimulation of glycogen degradation in periportal than in perivenous hepatocytes, whereas isoproterenol (a beta-adrenergic receptor agonist) caused a similar degree of glycogenolysis in the two cell populations. The results suggest that the hormonal stimulation of glycogen degradation differs in periportal and perivenous hepatocytes.", 
    "54": "The potent antioxidant activity of carvedilol could explain part of its protective action in brain ischemia, and interaction as a low-affinity non-competitive (uncompetitive) antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor would provide rapid channel blockade at this subtype of glutamate receptor. We have now found carvedilol to be neuroprotective (PC50 = 306 nM) against 40 microM veratridine which kills cerebellar granule cell neurons in 60 min regardless of energy state. Carvedilol was also a potent inhibitor (IC50 = 1.7 microM) of veratridine-stimulated 3[H]aspartate release from preloaded neurons, caused by reversal of the Na(+)-dependent glutamate transporter. Veratridine caused a sustained 4.3-fold increase in intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) up to 368 nM (n = 22). Carvedilol reversed the [Ca2+]i levels by a maximum of 73% with an IC50 of 0.9 microM. Such reversal of [Ca2+]i was facilitated by Na+/Ca2+ exchange since the stoichiometry of exchange could be disrupted by prior treatment with 1 microM ouabain to inhibit the Na+/K+ pump. These data suggest that, in addition to its antihypertensive effects, antioxidant activity and ability to act as a non-competitive inhibitor at the NMDA receptor, carvedilol has additional neuroprotective activity as a Na+ channel modulator and glutamate release inhibitor.", 
    "55": "Experiments were done on aortic rings (thoracic and abdominal) from young and retired breeder Lewis and Sprague-Dawley male rats. Constriction responses to norepinephrine, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), and prostaglandin F2 alpha, were done +/- the cyclooxygenase blockers, indomethacin or mefenamic acid. Indomethacin significantly depressed norepinephrine constriction in abdominal (but not thoracic) aorta of all groups. In additional studies of abdominal aorta from Lewis retired breeders, indomethacin and mefenamic acid depressed norepinephrine (but not 5-HT or prostaglandin F2 alpha) construction. Furthermore, indomethacin depressed norepinephrine constriction in vessels denuded of endothelial cells. The thromboxane receptor antagonist SQ 29548 did not alter norepinephrine constriction. Thus, in rat abdominal aorta, norepinephrine constriction is mediated by a constrictor prostanoid of vascular smooth muscle origin that is not thromboxane A2.", 
    "56": "The female dark agouti (DA) rat lacks CYP2D1, the equivalent enzyme in the rat to human CYP2D6 (debrisoquine hydroxylase), and shows impaired metabolism of a number of CYP2D6 substrates. However, from the data available in the literature it is not entirely clear whether the enzyme deficiency in the DA rat is restricted to CYP2D1, and whether factors such as age and substrate concentration are important determinants of interstrain differences in the activity of this enzyme. Given that the female DA rat is used as a model of the human CYP2D6 poor metaboliser phenotype, there is a need for a systematic evaluation of the P450 activities in the DA rat, and of its suitability as a model of the PM phenotype. In the present study metoprolol was used as a probe substrate to investigate CYP2D1 activity since both the alpha-hydroxylation and O-demethylation of this drug are catalysed by CYP2D6 in man. Formation of alpha-hydroxymetoprolol (AHM) and O-demethylmetoprolol (ODM) was 10- and 2.5-fold lower in liver microsomes from female DA rats compared with microsomes from age-matched female Wistar rats, the latter representing the extensive metaboliser strain. Kinetic analysis suggested that in both strains of rat both the alpha-hydroxylation and O-demethylation of metoprolol were catalysed by more than one enzyme. By using quinine as a specific inhibitor of the enzyme, CYP2D1 was identified as an intermediate affinity site in the Wistar strain and was shown to have impaired activity in the DA strain. The activities of lower and higher affinity sites were similar in the two strains. Thus, the only difference between the two strains with respect to both routes of metoprolol metabolism appeared to be in the activity of CYP2D1. Interstrain differences were found to be highly dependent on the choice of substrate concentration, being more marked at lower concentrations. We have also investigated the metabolism of a number of probe compounds for some of the other P450 isoforms commonly involved in drug metabolism to determine the selectivity of the deficiency in the DA strain. p-Nitrophenol hydroxylation and erythromycin N-demethylation were catalysed at higher rates by DA than by Wistar liver microsomes, indicating higher levels of activity of CYP2E1 and CYP3A in the former strain. Felodipine oxidation, tolbutamide hydroxylation and both the hydroxylation and N-demethylation of S-mephenytoin were catalysed at similar rates by microsomes from the two strains, indicating similar activities of enzymes in the CYP2C and CYP3A families.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "57": "The effect of ventral medial frontal cortex (MFC) lesions on heart rate and blood pressure during conditioned emotional responses (CER) was investigated. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into two groups: MFC-lesioned rats (n = 11) sustained bilateral lesions of the infralimbic and ventral prelimbic regions of the MFC via microinjection of the neurotoxin N-methyl-D-aspartate; Controls (n = 13) received sterile saline. Following a 2-week recovery period, all animals were trained; one of two tones served as the conditioned stimulus (CS) and a 2 mA footshock served as the unconditioned stimulus (US). The CS+ tone was consistently paired with the US, while the CS- tone was randomly paired with the US. Heart rate and blood pressure were recorded during CS+ and CS- presentations before and after administration of the following pharmacological agents: atropine, atenolol, and atropine + atenolol. All animals responded to the CS+ with increased BP compared to baseline; the increase was not significantly different between groups. Controls responded to the CS+ with increased HR, while MFC-lesioned animals displayed a bimodal HR response which was not significantly different from baseline, but was significantly different from Controls. Pharmacological blockade of the HR response revealed coactivation of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems during the CS+, with a significant decrease (52%) in the sympathetic tachycardia component of the CS+ HR response in MFC-lesioned rats as compared to Controls; the parasympathetic bradycardia component was not altered by MFC lesions. In all cases, CS- responses were smaller than the CS+ responses. Pharmacological analysis revealed that the CS- HR response was mediated by the sympathetic component only, which was also significantly reduced in MFC-lesioned animals as compared to Controls. This significant reduction in the sympathetically mediated HR component of both the reinforced CER (CS+) and the unreinforced CER (CS-) following ventral MFC lesions implies that the MFC is necessary for complete sympathetic activation of cardiovascular responses to both severely and mildly stressful stimuli. The role of the MFC in emotion is also discussed.", 
    "58": "The muscarinic M2 receptor that normally couples via Gi to inhibit adenylyl cyclase was made to couple to Gs by exchange of its third intracellular loop for the comparable domain of the beta 2-adrenoceptor. In HeLa cells transfected with the recombinant M2 beta i-3 cDNA, the chimaeric receptor showed carbachol-mediated activation of adenylyl cyclase (EC50 = 73 nM) that was blocked by atropine, but not by propranolol. The chimaeric receptor was shown to mediate a carbachol-stimulated, Bordetella pertussis toxin-sensitive GTPase activity in membranes of transfected HeLa cells. Interestingly, stimulation of adenylyl cyclase by carbachol was 2-fold higher in transfected cells that had been pretreated with pertussis toxin. These data suggested that the M2 beta i-3 receptor was able to couple to both Gi and Gs, and that the ability to recognise and stimulate Gi did not involve the third cytoplasmic loop of M2. We investigated peptide elements taken from the second intracellular loop of the M2 receptor for their ability to mediate activation of Gi and found that a nine amino acid peptide representing the C-terminal sequence, VKRTTKMAG-NH2 (V9G), was capable of inhibiting forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase by up to 18% and could stimulate high affinity GTPase activity of rat brain membranes by 32%. Further, V9G was shown to cause a doubling of the initial rate of [35S]GTP gamma S binding to purified bovine brain Gi/Go in reconstituted phospholipid vesicles. These data identify a domain on the second intracellular loop of the muscarinic M2 receptor that is involved in the selection of a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein.", 
    "59": "The effect of oxytocin on low back pain in patients and its mechanism in rats were investigated.", 
    "60": "Intrathecal injection, radioimmunoassay, and potassium iontophoresis tail-flick test were used to investigate the effect of oxytocin.", 
    "61": "In humans, acute and chronic low back pain causes a marked change of oxytocin content within cerebral spinal fluid and plasma; oxytocin relieves low back pain (ED50 0.172 in chronic and 0.121 micrograms/kg in acute). In rats, oxytocin had a dose-related analgesic effect (ED50 0.067 micrograms/kg). At high levels, oxytocin induced locomotor ataxia (ED50 17.915 micrograms/kg) and death (LD50 27.224 micrograms/kg). Oxytocin antagonist [d(CH2)5, Tyr(Me)2, Orn8]-vasotocin and opiate receptor-blocker naloxone could reverse oxytocin-induced analgesia. Oxytocin also increased beta-endorphin, L-encephalin, and dynorphin A1-13 contents in the spinal cord, whereas oxytocin antagonist caused a decrease.", 
    "62": "These results suggest that oxytocin induces analgesia in low back pain involving the endogenous opiate peptide system and may be effective and safe in acute and chronic low back pain.", 
    "63": "Cholinergic modulation of heart rate in isolated spontaneously beating single cells from the rabbit sino-atrial node was investigated by measuring transmembrane ionic currents using the nystatin-perforated patch whole-cell voltage-clamp technique. Carbamylcholine (CCh), a stable analogue of acetylcholine (ACh), significantly inhibited L-type calcium currents (Ica(L) which had been augmented by beta-adrenergic stimulation. In addition, CCh activated a potassium outward current (IK(ACh)). Both effects were blocked by atropine. The possible involvement of nitric oxide (NO) in these responses was evaluated by inhibiting NO synthesis. In the presence of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA, 100 microM) or nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 1 mM), two specific inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), CCh no longer inhibited ICa(L). IK(ACh) could still be activated. Co-incubation of cells in L-NAME or in L-NMMA with arginine (the endogenous substrate of NOS) restored the CCh-induced attenuation of ICa(L), indicating that L-NAME or L-NMMA did not interfere directly with the muscarinic action of CCh on ICa(L). Effects of the NO-releasing agent molsidomine (SIN-1) on CCh-induced changes in ICa(L) were also investigated. After ICa(L) had been augmented by beta-adrenergic stimulation, SIN-1 (0.1 mM) inhibited ICa(L); however, SIN-1 had no further inhibitory effect after a maximal CCh concentration had been applied. These findings suggest that NO generation is an obligatory process in cholinergic inhibition of ICa(L) in mammalian cardiac pacemaker tissue.", 
    "64": "To examine the regulation of angiotensin receptors in vascular smooth muscle cells, we studied the effects of antihypertensive drugs on angiotensin type 1A (AT1A) receptor gene expression in aortic smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) using both ribonuclease protection assay and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. An increase in AT1A receptor gene expression in ASMCs of SHRs was induced by treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril) for 2 weeks and 4 weeks, but not by other types of antihypertensive drugs such as alpha-blocker (doxazosin), alpha, beta-blocker (arotinolol), Ca antagonist (nicardipine) or vascular smooth muscle relaxant (hydralazine). Since all antihypertensive drugs lowered the blood pressure of the rats almost equally, our results suggest that AT1A receptor gene expression in ASMCs of SHRs may be regulated by the vascular renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "65": "The involvement of catecholamines in blood neutrophilia observed after administration of platelet activating factor (PAF) to rats was studied. Intravenous (i.v.) injection of PAF (4 micrograms/kg) into naive rats more than doubled the number of neutrophils after 1 h. In contrast, PAF failed to induce neutrophilia in both adrenalectomized rats and those which had their catecholamine stores depleted by reserpine. PAF-induced neutrophilia was not inhibited by the selective antagonism of alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors with prazosin and yohimbine, respectively. However, pretreatment with the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol, significantly inhibited the phenomenon. Increase in the blood neutrophil counts was also achieved following the i.v. injection of the beta-agonist, salbutamol (1 mg/kg, i.v.). This response was clearly sensitive to propranolol but was not modified in rats submitted to adrenalectomy or reserpine pretreatment. The results suggest that the blood neutrophilia induced by the i.v. administration of PAF in rats is dependent on the stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors by catecholamines released from adrenal glands.", 
    "66": "Techniques for the preparation of biological samples are often based nowadays on solid-phase extraction (SPE). The different SPE steps can be performed automatically on disposable extraction cartridges (DECs) by means of a sample processor. A knowledge-based system was developed to facilitate the development of fully automated methods for the solid-phase extraction of relatively hydrophobic basic drugs from plasma, coupled with their determination by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The DEC filled with 50 mg of cyanopropyl-bonded silica phase is first conditioned with methanol and buffer solution (pH 7.4). After sample application, the DEC sorbent is washed with the same buffer. The analytes are then desorbed with an appropriate eluent and the eluate is finally diluted with the same buffer as used in the HPLC mobile phase before injection. Under these conditions, only three variables are still to be optimized: the composition and volume of the elution solvent and the volume of buffer to be added to the eluate. On the basis of this general strategy, a decision tree providing information about suggested starting conditions and guidelines for the optimization of the three variables was developed and implemented by use of a hypermedia software. This didactic expert system was evaluated using several beta-receptor blocking agents as model compounds and the operating conditions obtained for the automated SPE of these compounds are presented. A method for the determination of propranolol in plasma using the SPE conditions deduced from the knowledge-based system was validated. The absolute recovery of propranolol is ca. 93% and the limit of detection is 1.3 ng ml-1. The mean within-day and between-day reproducibilities are 2.3 and 3.6%, respectively.", 
    "67": "It has previously been shown that a lethal dose of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) increases the brain concentrations of serotonin precursor, tryptophan, and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in TCDD-susceptible Long-Evans but not in TCDD-resistant Han/Wistar rats. In the present study, TCDD (50 micrograms/kg; LD100 for Long-Evans and nonlethal for Han/Wistar rats) enhanced de novo biosynthesis of serotonin in the brain of Long-Evans but not Han/Wistar or food-restricted Long-Evans rats 10 days after exposure. Furthermore, TCDD increased the plasma level of free tryptophan in Long-Evans rats alone, which may be causally related to the observed effects of TCDD on brain tryptophan levels. Administration of hemin modified the time course of TCDD-induced anorexia although 10 day cumulative food consumption was not altered. Hemin tended to attenuate TCDD-elicited increases in brain serotonin turnover, whereas a beta-adrenergic blocker, propranolol, did not. In the majority of Long-Evans rats, TCDD inhibited the main tryptophan degrading enzyme in the liver, tryptophan pyrrolase, but the rest exhibited augmented activities; these effects were not altered by hemin. TCDD increased the plasma levels of nonesterified fatty acids in Long-Evans (five-fold) but not in Han/Wistar rats. A slight elevation (two-fold) was also seen in food-restricted Long-Evans rats. It is concluded that TCDD selectively promotes brain serotonin turnover in Long-Evans rats and this acceleration is related to increased plasma levels of free tryptophan. The inhibition of tryptophan catabolism in the liver and elevation of plasma nonesterified fatty acids may contribute to these changes.", 
    "68": "On the basis of the available data concerning the indications for and the timing of arteriography after thrombolysis, the inevitable conclusion is that conservative instead of aggressive management is indicated for the 40% to 50% of patients at low risk who do not have spontaneous myocardial ischemia or myocardial ischemia that was provoked. Factors to be considered in treatment decisions for individual patients after thrombolytic therapy include risk factors before and after thrombolytic therapy, the results of studies assessing conservative versus aggressive post-thrombolytic management, the accuracy of risk stratification by noninvasive testing, and the relevance of the \"open artery\" hypothesis. The low-risk patient with a left ventricular ejection fraction above 40% and no ischemia during adequate stress testing has a low 3-year mortality rate. Although benefits of routine coronary arteriography exist relative to determining the severity of coronary artery disease and whether the infarct-related artery is patent, selective coronary arteriography is a more feasible and less expensive approach for appropriate patients. The low annual mortality rate with this approach is equal to that obtained when patients undergo routine coronary arteriography with myocardial revascularization based upon the result of the routine procedure. The modification of various coronary risk factors appears as valuable for patients who have undergone thrombolytic therapy as for those who did not. Specifically, the cessation of smoking, the control of hypertension, and the treatment of hypercholesterolemia are indicated for patients after thrombolysis when any of these modifiable risk factors are present. Secondary prevention with pharmacologic agents appears to be similar for those who have undergone standard or thrombolytic therapy. Long-term aspirin therapy is routine for secondary prevention; long-term beta-blocker therapy is useful for high-risk patients; and long-term treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is indicated for patients after thrombolysis who have a low left ventricular ejection fraction.", 
    "69": "The effects of epinephrine and of splanchnic nerve activation on adrenocortical androstenedione release were studied in intact isolated perfused pig adrenals with preserved nerve supply. In addition, long-term effects of epinephrine were characterized in bovine adrenocortical cells in primary culture. To investigate the contact zones of the androgen-producing cells of the zona reticularis with the catecholamine producing cells of the adrenal medulla, cortical cells were immunostained for cytochrome P450 side chain cleavage (P450SCC). Perfusion of the isolated adrenals with epinephrine (10(-7) to 10(-5) M) stimulated androstenedione release in a dose-dependent manner. At a concentration of 10(-6) M, epinephrine provoked an increase to 179.11 +/- 16.14% of basal secretion (p < 0.05). Electrical stimulation of the splanchnic nerves led to an increase to 151.5 +/- 9.24% of basal values (p < 0.05). Epinephrine (10(-6) M) reached 40% and activation of the splanchnic nerves 26% of the stimulatory effect of ACTH at a physiological concentration (10(-10) M). The alpha-agonist phenylephrine had no effect on androstenedione release. In cell cultures, epinephrine stimulated the release of androstenedione in a dose-dependent manner with an ED50 of 0.75 x 10(-6) M. The maximal effect was reached at 10(-5) M with 8.92 +/- 0.66 pmol androstenedione/dish/24 h; the basal secretion was 1.44 +/- 0.54 pmol/dish/24 h. The epinephrine-stimulated androstenedione release was abolished by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol while the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine had no effect. Immunohistochemical staining of paraffin sections of bovine and porcine adrenals for P450SCC revealed that zona reticularis and zona medullaris are closely interwoven.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "70": "Seventy-two social phobics were randomly assigned to behavioral (flooding) or drug treatment with atenolol or placebo. Treatment was administered over a 3-month period of time, and duration of treatment effects was determined at a 6-month follow-up assessment. Multiple measures of outcome were used, including self-report, clinician ratings (including assessment by independent evaluators), behavioral assessment, and performance on composite indexes. The results indicated that flooding consistently was superior to placebo, whereas atenolol was not. Flooding also was superior to atenolol on behavioral measures and composite indexes. Those subjects who improved during treatment maintained gains at the 6-month follow-up regardless of whether they received flooding or atenolol. The variability of outcome on different measures in social phobia research is discussed, and the need for broad-based treatment strategies to address the pervasive deficits associated with social phobia is noted.",

Within-day and between-day coefficients of variation are less than 10%. The lower limits of detection are 4, 2, and 4 ng/mL for celiprolol, deacetyldiltiazem, and verapamil, respectively.

The findings of MIBG-myocardial SPECT were compared with the changes in cardiac function obtained by echocardiograms. The patients enrolled in the study were seven males who has been diagnosed as definitely suffering from DCM according to diagnostic guidelines provided by the Ministry of Health and Welfare. The patients were aged 57.5 +/- 10.2 years. Following intravenous administration of 111 MBq (3 mCi) of MIBG, myocardial SPECT was taken 20 minutes, and 4 hours later. The washout rate of the left ventricular wall was higher in the unchanged group (40.7 +/- 1.2%) than in the improved group (30.3 +/- 6.1%). Both the early and delayed images showed higher extent and severity scores for the unchanged group than for the improved group. A correlation of LVEF with the washout rates was demonstrated (r = -0.819, p < 0.05). A correlation was also observed between the variations in LVEF before and after beta blocker therapy with the washout rates (r = -0.969, p < 0.01), MIBG-myocardial SPECT suggested possibility of the evaluation of severity and prognosis in the patients with DCM.", 
    "73": "The effect of beta-adrenergic blockade on the plasma potassium elevation induced by acute respiratory acidosis (CO2 inhalation) was studied in adult mongrel dogs during halothane or fentanyl anesthesia. Twenty-two dogs were divided into 4 groups: halothane-control (HC, n = 15), halothane-beta-blockade (H beta, n = 8), fentanyl-control (FC, n = 15) and fentanyl-beta-blockade (F beta, n = 10). Beta-blockade was achieved by continuous infusion of propranolol. The maximum levels of plasma potassium after 14% CO2 inhalation were 5.0 +/- 0.7 mM (mean +/- SD) in HC, 6.1 +/- 0.8 mM in H beta, 4.3 +/- 0.4 mM in FC and 4.8 +/- 0.5 mM in F beta. With halothane anesthesia more prominent elevation was observed in the beta-blockade group (P < 0.05), but with fentanyl anesthesia this elevation was not significantly different between the two groups. In acute respiratory acidosis, pH-induced plasma potassium elevation is suppressed by simultaneously increased catecholamines, especially epinephrine. Beta-adrenergic blockade, therefore, may cause severe hyperkalemia due to inhibition of adrenergic potassium disposal. During fentanyl anesthesia plasma potassium elevation was less marked than during halothane. This indicates that fentanyl has less suppressing action on the secretion of stress hormones, including epinephrine, under similarly stressful conditions as halothane anesthesia.", 
    "74": "In patients with malignant ventricular arrhythmias, antiarrhythmic therapy is known to carry a substantial risk of proarrhythmia. This risk is usually considered to be low when supraventricular arrhythmias or benign ventricular arrhythmias are considered. We were able to collect data on four patients without a history of life-threatening arrhythmias, in whom antiarrhythmic therapy was used and resulted in documented ventricular fibrillation or torsade de pointes. In Cases No. 1 and 2, atrial fibrillation was treated with either quinidine or quinidine and sotalol in combination. In both patients Holter monitoring, 4-12 h after conversion to sinus rhythm, documented the spontaneous occurrence of torsade de pointes degenerating into ventricular fibrillation and requiring DC shock for termination. In Case No. 3, atrial fibrillation was treated with sotalol and amiodarone for 2 months when incessant episodes of torsade de pointes were documented. In Case No. 4, frequent but unsustained ventricular arrhythmias were treated with amiodarone in a patient suffering dilative cardiomyopathy. After 6 days of treatment at a heart rate of 54 beats/min, a marked QT increase was associated with the occurrence of repetitive episodes of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia degenerating into ventricular fibrillation. None of the patients presented significant electrolyte abnormalities in the laboratory. A pathologic increase of the QTc-time was documented in Cases No. 1, 3, and 4. In all patients antiarrhythmic therapy was withdrawn after the proarrhythmic event and the patient became free of malignant tachyarrhythmias. Antiarrhythmic therapy also carries a considerable risk of proarrhythmia when \"benign\" cardiac arrhythmias are treated. The risk seems to be lower than in patients with malignant arrhythmias, however it includes the occurrence of lethal tachyarrhythmias. Special attention should be paid to the selection of antiarrhythmic agents when used in combination.", 
    "75": "The effects of aging on atrioventricular (AV) nodal and right and left ventricular beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) characteristics were studied in Fischer 344 rat hearts using quantitative autoradiography. Twenty-micrometer-thick cardiac sections containing the compact AV node from 16 mature (4-6 mo old) rats, 6 middle-aged (12 mo old) rats, and 16 old (24 mo old) rats were incubated with [125I]iodocyanopindolol, [125I]iodocyanopindolol plus atenolol, or ICI 118551. Saturation experiments revealed a significant age-related decrease in AV nodal beta-AR density (mature: 190 +/- 46, middle-aged: 165 +/- 27, old: 133 +/- 34 amol/mm2; P < 0.01), with no change in affinity (mature: 106 +/- 62, middle-aged: 132 +/- 46, old: 128 +/- 66 pM). No age-related changes in AV nodal beta-AR subtype ratio (55% beta 1, 45% beta 2) or estimated compact AV node volume were detected (mature: 66 +/- 17, old: 65 +/- 23 microns 3). No difference in beta-AR density or affinity was detected between mature and old rats in either left (LV) or right (RV) ventricular tissue (LV, mature: 60 +/- 11, middle-aged: 59 +/- 11, old: 62 +/- 11 amol/mm2; RV, mature: 65 +/- 9, middle-aged: 65 +/- 11, old: 58 +/- 10 amol/mm2). beta-AR subtype ratios for the left ventricle (64% beta 1, 36% beta 2) and right ventricle (63% beta 1, 37% beta 2) did not significantly differ between mature and old rats. To summarize, aging from 4 to 24 mo in the Fischer 344 rat is associated with 1) a decrease in AV nodal beta-AR density with no change in affinity; 2) no change in volume of the compact region of the AV node; 3) no change in beta-AR subtype ratio in the AV node, left ventricle, or right ventricle; and 4) no change in either RV or LV beta-AR density.", 
    "76": "In one-kidney rats the resting blood flow in the renal artery was recorded for 10 minutes then the artery was clipped for one hour and the following reperfusion blood flow was registered again for 10 minutes. The animals were divided into three groups: Series A, untreated control animals. Series B, two weeks before renal ischemia the rats were fed a diet containing 0.1% of BM-14.190, a derivate of carvedilol. Series C the rats received a diet with 0.1% of carvedilol. The resting renal blood flow was 4.58 +/- 0.13 ml/min (x +/- S.E.M.) in series A whereas 6.36 +/- 0.41 ml/min. in series B and 5.87 +/- 0.59 ml/min. in series C (p < 0.01), also the reperfusion blood flow in series B and C was significantly higher (p < 0.01) i.e. 3.65 +/- 0.25 ml/min. and 3.08 +/- 0.33 ml/min. respectively than in series A, 1.08 +/- 0.13 ml/min. The ischemia and the ensuing reperfusion elicited in series A serious injury, especially in renal proximal tubules and their reticulin skeleton whereas the renal injury in series B and C was of a markedly lesser degree. Carvedilol and its derivate BM-14.190 possess beside vasodilatory potency and alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity a potent scavenger property. This may be the cause of the protective effect preventing the ischemia and reperfusion injury in the renal tissue.",

    "78": "Circadian regulation of pineal melatonin content was studied in Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus), especially melatonin peak width and the temporal correlation to wheel-running activity. Melatonin was measured by radioimmunoassay in glands removed at different circadian times with respect to activity onset (= CT 12). Pineal melatonin peak width (h; for mean > or = 125 pg/gland) and activity duration (alpha) were both 4-5 h longer after 12 or 27 weeks than after 5 or 6 days in continuous darkness (DD). Increased peak width was associated with a delay in the morning decline (M) of melatonin to baseline, correlated with a similar delay in wheel-running offset. In contrast, the evening rise (E) in melatonin occurred at approximately the same circadian phase regardless of the length of DD. Fifteen min light pulses produced similar phase-shifts in melatonin and activity. In a phase advance shift, M advanced at once, while E advanced only after several days of adjustment. Independent timing of shifts in the E and M components of the melatonin rhythm suggest that these events are controlled separately by at least two circadian oscillators whose mutual phase relationship determines melatonin peak width. This two-oscillator control of melatonin peak width is integral to the circadian mechanism of hamster photoperiodic time measurement.", 
    "79": "The aim was to test directly the hypothesis that the magnitude of previous beat contraction history will be greatest for short pulse intervals, will become smaller as pulse interval is lengthened, and will vanish when pulse interval is long enough to allow complete restitution.", 
    "80": "Experiments were performed in isolated rabbit and ferret left ventricles in which pressure and volume were controlled with a servo-motor system. Two restitution curves were generated, each constructed from isovolumetric beats that were preceded by a beat with differing amounts of ejection: one curve was constructed from isovolumetric beats preceded by non-ejecting beats, while the other was constructed from isovolumetric beats preceded by a beats that had a high level of ejection (ejection fraction approximately 50%).", 
    "81": "When the isovolumetric beats used to construct a restitution curve were preceded by ejecting beats, the restitution curve was shifted upward (that is, higher activation at a given interval between beats) when compared to a restitution curve constructed from isovolumetric beats that were preceded by non-ejecting beats.", 
    "82": "Mechanical restitution is affected by the mechanical events of preceding contractions, implying that previous beat contraction history and restitution share a common mechanism and that restitution sets the stage for previous beat contraction history. Hence restitution is not simply a useful tool for assessing calcium cycling or interval dependent behaviour and should be viewed more broadly as a fundamental process in the beat to beat regulation of cardiac contraction.", 
    "83": "The leukotrienes (LTs), referred to as the slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A), are reported to have little or no activity in the canine airway. The objective of this study was to determine whether LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4 (10(-10)-10(-7) M) play a role in neuromuscular control of third- to fifth-order canine bronchi. In the presence of 1 microM indomethacin (Indo), canine bronchial smooth muscle contracted and was depolarized in a concentration-dependent manner by LTC4 or LTD4 but not by LTE4. LTC4 and LTD4 concentration-response curves were not significantly affected when conducted in the presence of any of the following: 10(-7) M propranolol (beta-adrenoceptor antagonist), 10(-6) M chlorpheniramine (H1-receptor antagonist), 10(-6) M ketanserin (nonselective 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor antagonist), 10(-7) M atropine (muscarinic receptor antagonist), and 10(-6) M tetrodotoxin (sodium channel blocker). LTC4 and LTD4 also potentiated electrical field-stimulated (EFS) excitatory junction potentials (EJPs), suggesting a possible prejunctional enhancement of acetylcholine release. In the absence of Indo, no postjunctional responses to LTC4 and LTD4 occurred. Endogenous prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha (a stable metabolite of PGI2) levels from canine bronchi were significantly reduced by Indo. In the presence of Indo, addition of > or = 10(-8) M of PGE2 suppressed contractions to LTC4 and LTD4. These data suggest that the decrease in PGE2 and PGI2 production by Indo is sufficient to unmask the excitatory postjunctional actions of LTC4 and LTD4 on bronchial smooth muscle. Serine borate (45 mM; an inhibitor of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, which prevents the conversion of LTC4 to LTD4) increased selectively the contractile activity of LTC4. L-Cysteine (3 mM; an inhibitor of an aminopeptidase, which prevents the conversion of LTD4 to LTE4) enhanced the contractile responses to LTD4. Serine borate increased the amplitude and duration of EFS contractions and potentiated the amplitude of EFS EJPs; the last effects were prevented by nordihydroguaiaretic acid. These and other studies suggest that LTs are synthesized by canine bronchi and have receptors on canine bronchial smooth muscle but that contractions to LTC4 and LTD4 in the canine airway are usually not observed because of the presence of inhibitory prostanoids (PGE2 and PGI2). We suggest that decreases in PGE2 and PGI2 in models of airway disease in combination with increases in LTC4, LTD4, and thromboxane A2 may contribute to airway hyperresponsiveness in vitro.", 
    "84": "beta-Dendrotoxin (beta-DTX), a polypeptide component of Eastern Green Mamba snake venom, inhibits a slow voltage-activated 86Rb efflux from synaptosomes, suggesting that beta-DTX inhibits K+ channels. The effects of beta-DTX on the K+ currents in primary cultured and subcultured (passages 8-12) rat tail artery vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were studied using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. A delayed rectifier K+ current was observed in both types of cells. The current, which was relatively insensitive to tetraethylammonium, was activated at -40 to -30 mV and showed almost no inactivation. beta-DTX (1-1000 nM) decreased the outward K+ current. The effect was concentration dependent and reversible by washout but did not depend on the frequency of stimulation (use dependence) or the membrane potential. beta-DTX was more effective in primary cultured cells than in subcultured cells. K+ channels in primary cultured cells were maximally (45%) inhibited by 1 microM beta-DTX compared with 35% inhibition in subcultured cells. The concentration producing half-maximal inhibition was 5.1 x 10(-8) M for primary cells and 7.1 x 10(-8) M for subcultured cells. The delayed rectifier current was not affected by alpha-DTX, a blocker of the fast-inactivating outward K+ current (IA). These results clearly demonstrate that beta-DTX is a novel antagonist of the delayed rectifier K+ current in primary and subcultured rat tail artery VSMCs.", 
    "85": "Sotalol is a class III antiarrhythmic drug with additional beta-blocker activity that has been shown to be effective in supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. Its long-term efficacy for ventricular arrhythmias is not as well described. Patients with documented sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) who had their clinical arrhythmia inducible at baseline electrophysiologic study received sotalol 320 to 640 mg/day. Repeat programmed stimulation was performed after a minimum of 72 hours while receiving the final dose. Of 28 patients (25 men and 3 women) whose arrhythmias were inducible at baseline, 15 had their arrhythmias suppressed with sotalol. Sotalol had greater success in suppressing arrhythmias in those with VF (8 of 9, 89%) than in those with VT (7 of 19, 37%, p < 0.01). In patients with a history of coronary artery disease but no history of myocardial infarction the arrhythmia was suppressed in 7 of 8 (88%) compared with 8 of 20 (40%, p < 0.05) patients with a history of myocardial infarction. All 15 patients in whom ventricular arrhythmias were suppressed continued to take long-term sotalol, and at a follow-up of 10.3 +/- 6.4 months none has had arrhythmia recurrence. Thus, sotalol is an effective drug for the suppression of ventricular arrhythmias as judged by programmed electrical stimulation. It appears to be more effective in patients in whom the clinical arrhythmia is VF rather than VT.", 
    "86": "The implantable cardiac defibrillator was first used in 1980 and has gained widespread acceptance. However, no randomized controlled trials have been reported that compare the implantable cardiac defibrillator with antiarrhythmic drugs. Most published studies have used historical control subjects or nonrandomized concurrent patients for comparison with patients who received an implantable defibrillator. To reduce bias, studies are needed that compare therapies randomized between antiarrhythmic drugs and implantable defibrillators. The Antiarrhythmics Versus Implantable Defibrillators (AVID) Study was designed to evaluate the nonthoracotomy, tiered-therapy implantable defibrillator compared with drug therapy (amiodarone or sotalol). Patients are eligible for randomization if they have a history of recent cardiac arrest caused by ventricular fibrillation or have hemodynamically serious ventricular tachycardia. A pilot study to enroll 200 patients began on June 1, 1993, before the start of the main study of 1000 patients. Analysis of the main study by intention to treat will assess the primary endpoint of total mortality.", 
    "87": "In 1987, the Cardiac Arrest Study Hamburg (CASH), a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled study, was started in survivors of sudden cardiac death resulting from documented ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Through December 1991, 230 survivors (46 women, 184 men; mean age 57 +/- 11 years) of cardiac arrest caused by ventricular tachyarrhythmias were randomly assigned to receive either oral propafenone (56 patients), amiodarone (56 patients), or metoprolol (59 patients) or to have an implantable defibrillator (59 patients) without concomitant antiarrhythmic drugs. The primary endpoint of the study was total mortality. In March 1992, the propafenone arm of CASH was stopped because of excess mortality compared with the implantable defibrillator group. This article presents preliminary results of the comparison of implantable defibrillator therapy with propafenone therapy. A significantly higher incidence of total mortality, sudden death (12%), and cardiac arrest recurrence or sudden death (23%) was found in the propafenone group compared with the implantable defibrillator-treated patients (0%, p < 0.05). It was concluded that, in survivors of cardiac arrest, propafenone treatment is less effective than implantable defibrillator treatment.", 
    "88": "In a randomized double-blind crossover study in 42 patients with essential hypertension, the metabolic effects of a beta-adrenergic blocker with a pronounced beta 2-agonistic effect, dilevalol 400 mg x 1, were compared with those of metoprolol succinate 200 mg x 1. The effects of glucose metabolism were evaluated by the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp technique and an intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT). Insulin-mediated glucose disposal (M) and the insulin sensitivity index (M/I) increased by 19% (P = .011) and 10% (P = .27), respectively, during dilevalol treatment, but decreased by 10% (P = .15) and 22% (P = .0025), respectively, during metoprolol treatment, giving rise to significant differences between the two treatment regimens. Compared with dilevalol-treated patients, those treated with metoprolol showed increased plasma insulin values at the end of the IVGTT, but there was no difference in plasma glucose concentrations or glucose tolerance. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels increased by 5.4% (P = .04) in the metoprolol group. Serum cholesterol, total serum and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglycerides, and serum urate levels decreased significantly (by 6%, 22%, 29%, and 14%, respectively) during dilevalol treatment, and there was a significant difference between the effects of the two drugs on total, VLDL, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) triglyceride and serum urate levels. These data demonstrate that a beta-blocker with a partial beta 2-agonist action differs in its metabolic effect profile from a selective beta 1-blocker and may offer advantages by improving glucose and lipid metabolism.", 
    "89": "Intracellular recordings were made from neurons of the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi in slices of guinea pig medulla. 5-HT (serotonin) caused a hyperpolarization followed by a late depolarization. The hyperpolarization was mediated by 5-HT1A receptor activation and could be selectively blocked by pindobind-5HT1A (PBD). 5-HT then caused a depolarization only. A selective 5-HT2 agonist, (+)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI), also caused a depolarization. Ketanserin and spiperone, 5-HT2 antagonists, blocked the depolarization due to both 5-HT and DOI. Focal electrical stimulation caused an IPSP mediated by 5-HT acting upon 5-HT1A receptors and a slow EPSP (s-EPSP). PBD blocked the IPSP, leaving an isolated s-EPSP. Both spiperone and ketanserin antagonized the s-EPSP, while DOI occluded it. The s-EPSP was from 2 to 10 mV in amplitude and 35-50 sec in duration, and showed voltage dependence consistent with a decrease in potassium conductance. Both the IPSP and the s-EPSP were presynaptically inhibited by the 5-HT1D agonist sumatriptan. These data indicate that the s-EPSP is mediated by 5-HT acting upon 5-HT2 receptors. This represents strong support for the role of 5-HT as an excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS. Further, it demonstrates that synaptic release of 5-HT can mediate opposing effects on the membrane potential of a single cell.", 
    "90": "alpha-Melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH1-13) and its COOH-terminal tripeptide alpha-MSH11-13 (Lys Pro Val) inhibit inflammation when administered systemically. Recent evidence indicates that alpha-MSH1-13 can likewise inhibit inflammation in the skin solely via an action within the brain. Because of the potential importance of this discovery to understanding the control of inflammation and because alpha-MSH molecules might be useful for treatment of inflammation, experiments were performed to learn more about the mechanisms of action of these peptides. In tests on inflammation induced in the mouse ear by intradermal injections of recombinant human interleukin-1 beta, alpha-MSH1-1-13 administered intracerebroventricularly effectively reduced inflammation. This effect of centrally administered alpha-MSH1-13 was inhibited by systemic injection of the nonspecific beta-adrenergic receptor blocker propranolol and by administration of a specific beta 2-adrenergic receptor antagonist; the effect was not altered by blockade of cholinergic, alpha-adrenergic, or beta 1-adrenergic receptors. In mice with inflammation induced in a hind paw and with the spinal cord transected, the antiinflammatory effect of centrally administered alpha-MSH1-13 was prevented, indicating that intact descending neuronal pathways are required for the antiinflammatory influence of the central peptide. Systemic injection of alpha-MSH1-13 in animals with spinal cord transection had a smaller and later antiinflammatory effect, which suggests that the molecule also has an action, albeit lesser, in the periphery. However, alpha-MSH11-13 injected intraperitoneally had marked antiinflammatory activity in animals with spinal cord transection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "91": "The effects of metoprolol on early infarct expansion after acute myocardial infarction were studied in rats (n = 54) that underwent either left coronary artery ligation (MI) or sham operation. Immediately after surgery, the rats received either metoprolol (M) by mouth, which had been dissolved in drinking water, for 72 hours supplemented with three intraperitoneal doses over the first 24 hours or no treatment (H2O). Three days after the initial surgery, hemodynamic measurements were made before and after volume loading. The rats were killed, the hearts were removed, and passive pressure-volume curves were obtained. The hearts were then fixed at a constant pressure and analyzed morphometrically. Infarct size was nonsignificantly lower in the metoprolol-treated group compared with the untreated group (38% +/- 5% MI-M vs 48% +/- 3% MI-H2O, p = 0.10) Compared with infarcted untreated rats, infarcted metoprolol-treated rats had a lower heart rate (322 +/- 13 beats/min MI-M vs 452 +/- 19 beats/min MI-H2O, p < 0.001), lower left ventricular systolic pressure (63 +/- 4 mm Hg MI-M vs 90 +/- 6 mm Hg MI-H2O, p = 0.004), and lower +dp/dt (1340 +/- 169 mm Hg/sec MI-M vs 2872 +/- 273 mm Hg/sec MI-H2O, p < 0.001), but left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and cardiac index did not differ between the two groups. Left ventricular weight corrected for body weight was higher in infarcted rats treated with metoprolol compared with infarcted untreated rats (2.76 +/- 0.07 gm/kg MI-M vs 2.41 +/- 0.09 gm/kg MI-H2O, p < 0.05). The initial slope of the pressure-volume relationship Ki, an index of operative volume stiffness, was lower in infarcted rats treated with metoprolol compared with infarcted untreated rats (p = 0.03). There were, however, no significant differences in the expansion index, thinning ratio, or left ventricular volume between the two infarcted groups. Thus metoprolol therapy begun in the immediate postinfarction period promotes an increase in left ventricular weight and reduces operative volume stiffness but has no significant effect on indexes of early infarct expansion.",

Metoprolol CR reduced diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate; fasting free fatty acids and the urinary potassium increased (P < 0.05 for all). No effect of metformin or metoprolol CR was seen on the glucose disposal rate, blood glucose, plasma insulin, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, lipoprotein(a), uric acid or plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 activity or antigen. The glucose uptake was not particularly decreased in these subjects.", 
    "96": "The study shows that metformin has some favourable effects on metabolism and that metoprolol CR is fairly neutral in this regard. The lack of effect of metformin on glucose disposal rate and blood pressure can be explained by the fact that the individuals studied were neither insulin resistant nor hypertensive. The data does not preclude an antihypertensive effect by treating a concomitant insulin resistance.", 
    "97": "In previous studies, we have demonstrated that stimulation of alpha 1 but not alpha 2 or beta adrenergic receptors in rat embryos grown in culture interferes with normal development of the left/right body axis leading to situs inversus. In the present study, we aimed to determine the alpha 1 adrenergic receptor subtype and signal transduction pathway involved in this phenomenon. Rat embryos at Stage 11a by a modified Theiler's staging system were cultured for 50 hr in medium containing various compounds which are known to activate or inhibit different sites of the signal transduction pathways associated with alpha 1 adrenergic receptors. They were then examined to determine the sidedness of asymmetric body structures. WB4101, a selective antagonist of alpha 1A adrenergic receptor subtype, but not chlorethylclonidine, a selective antagonist of alpha 1B adrenergic receptor subtype, inhibited phenylephrine (an alpha 1 adrenergic agonist)-induced situs inversus. Neither the protein kinase C (PKC) activators phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and SC-9 nor the PKC inhibitor calphostin C caused situs inversus. Furthermore, calphostin C did not block phenylephrine-induced situs inversus. A23187, a Ca2+ ionophore, induced situs inversus; nifedipine, a L-type Ca2+ channel blocker, partially blocked phenylephrine-induced situs inversus. The calmodulin antagonists trifluoperazine, W-7, and W-13 blocked phenylephrine-induced situs inversus, although they did not cause situs inversus by themselves. KN-62, a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) inhibitor, dose-dependently blocked phenylephrine-induced situs inversus. However, higher concentrations of this compound produced no block in the presence of phenylephrine and in its absence produced a 50% incidence of situs inversus. These results indicate that alpha 1 adrenergic stimulation-induced situs inversus is mediated by the alpha 1A adrenergic receptor subtype and that activation of CaM kinase II but not PKC may be involved.",

The signal-averaged ECG was recorded at baseline and after physiological and pharmacologic beta-adrenergic stimulation (tilt, exercise, and epinephrine and isoproterenol infusions), sequential and combined beta-adrenergic and parasympathetic blockade, and alpha-adrenergic stimulation before and after parasympathetic blockade. Analysis was performed with a bidirectional filter (40-Hz high-pass). Significant changes in the signal-averaged QRS duration from baseline (105.1 +/- 12.0 milliseconds) were noted with tilt (96.8 +/- 8.8 milliseconds), tilt after double blockade (97.5 +/- 9.0 milliseconds), epinephrine (110.5 +/- 11.8 milliseconds), and isoproterenol (99.6 +/- 12.6 milliseconds). Changes in the root-mean-square voltage of the terminal 40 milliseconds and the low-amplitude (< 40 microV) signal duration paralleled the changes in the QRS duration.", 
    "100": "The signal-averaged ECG does not measure only \"fixed\" parameters but rather is altered under a variety of physiological and pharmacologic conditions. Upright tilt leads to shortening of the QRS duration before and after autonomic blockade; thus, the decrease in QRS duration with tilt may be related to factors other than changes in autonomic tone. These findings have implications for interpretation of the results of signal-averaged ECG.",

Terbutaline effects were antagonized only by the beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118,551, indicating that they were mediated by beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation. In vivo intravenous infusions of terbutaline (dose range 25 to 300 ng/kg body weight per min for 15 min) dose dependently increased heart rate and shortened the pre-ejection period and heart rate-corrected electromechanical systole (QS2) time. These effects are mediated predominantly by beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation because they were only marginally affected by the beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist bisoprolol (1 x 10 mg orally), either given 2 h before infusion or long term for 3 weeks.",

    "106": "The heart rate responses observed after both squatting and standing are thought to be of reflex nature and may be useful to assess the functional integrity of parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves in diabetes. In the standard maneuver, each subject stood still for 3 min, then squatted down for 1 min, and at last stood up during an inspiratory phase. In 10 healthy subjects (25-31 years of age), lengthening of the R-R interval during squatting was abolished by atropine, whereas propranolol markedly attenuated shortening of the R-R interval at standing from squatting. Squatting test (SqT) ratios (SqT vagal [SqTv] = ratio between the R-R interval mean before squatting and the longest R-R interval after squatting; SqT sympathetic [SqTs] = ratio between the basal R-R interval and the shortest R-R interval at standing) were calculated in 558 healthy subjects and 346 diabetic patients (insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus/non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus: 103/243). Normal ranges (95 and 99% confidence intervals [CIs]) for subjects 20-74 years of age showed a statistically significant negative correlation with age. SqTv was outside the 99% CI in 145 (42%) diabetic patients and in 7 (1.3%) of the control subjects. The corresponding figures for SqTs were 40 and 0.8%, respectively. Age and duration of diabetes had a negative influence on SqT ratios. SqT ratios were compared with other reflex tests currently used for diagnosis of autonomic neuropathy: deep breathing (DB), lying-to-standing (LS), Valsalva manuever, and blood pressure change after standing (orthostatic hypotension [OH]).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "107": "The effects of beta 2-stimulants [clenbuterol (CB) and terbutaline (TB)] on the contractility of the urethral sphincter of female dogs were studied by measuring intraurethral pressure (IUP) during stimulation of bilateral pudendal nerves. In nine dogs 1, 10 and 100 micrograms/kg. of CB were administered, but no changes in IUP were observed. In the other 33 dogs, sphincteric fatigue was experimentally prepared by electrically stimulating the pudendal nerves at 15 V, 20 Hz for 30 to 40 minutes. In fatigued sphincters, CB (n = 17) and TB (n = 7) increased the contracting pressure (pressure difference between stimulation-generated peak level and baseline level of IUP). The inotropic effect of beta 2-stimulant (TB) on the fatigued urethral sphincter was abolished by a beta-blocker, propranolol. From the present study it was concluded that beta 2-stimulants have little effect on the total contractility of the nonfatigued urethral sphincter because it is composed of smooth and striated muscles (fast- and slow-contracting muscles). However, beta 2-stimulants enhanced the contractility of fatigued urethral sphincter. These results suggest that beta 2-stimulants act on fast-contracting fibers in the urethral sphincter because the inotropic effect of sympathomimetic amine is much greater on fatigued, fast-contracting fibers than on nonfatigued ones and its depressive effect on slow-contracting fibers is not potentiated after fatigue.", 
    "108": "In coronary arterial rings isolated from horse, norepinephrine (NE)(10(-7) - 10(-5) M) induced concentration-dependent contractions which were not influenced by endothelial denudation. Prazosin (alpha 1-antagonist) inhibited the contraction, but yohimbine (alpha 2-antagonist) did not, and propranolol (beta-antagonist) enhanced the contraction. Pretreatment with phentolamine (10(-5) M) (alpha-antagonist) converted the contraction induced by NE to relaxation in coronary rings precontracted with ONO11113 (thromboxane A2 derivative). The relaxation was not influenced by removal of the endothelium, and was inhibited by propranolol and atenolol (beta 1-antagonist) but not by butoxamine (beta 2-antagonist). These results suggest that in equine coronary arteries, the contractile response to NE is mediated by stimulation of alpha 1-adrenoceptors on the smooth muscle, and that stimulation of beta 1-adrenoceptors on the smooth muscle modifies the contraction by inducing relaxation.", 
    "109": "By and large, the results of the different studies on quality of life in hypertension suggest that among beta-blockers only the nonselective beta-blocker propranolol has a negative effect on well-being, being associated with depression and side-effects. The findings on diuretics are comparatively few, and mainly observed as an adverse impact on sexual function. If one broadens the treatment scenario to include mortality and morbidity, evidence of a beneficial impact has only been proven for beta-blockers and diuretics. With the primary aim of antihypertensive drug therapy given as a reduction in cardiovascular risk factors, the aim with regard to quality of life is that quality of life be maintained. The new guidelines on the management of mild hypertension issued in the United States highlight the danger of relaxing the concern for risk reduction and costs in favour of surrogate end-points, even though these may carry great significance in the individual patient.", 
    "110": "Stereoselectivity in the oxidative metabolism of propafenone (PPF) enantiomers to 5-hydroxypropafenone was studied with untreated and inducer-treated mouse hepatic microsomes. In the untreated microsomes, Lineweaver-Burk plots of the 5-hydroxylation of R(-)- and S(+) PPF. single lines, and the intrinsic clearance (Vmax/Km) value of R(-)-PPF was 1.3-fold higher than that of S(+)-PPF. When racemic PPF was used as a substrate, the plot was shifted to the upper region, in comparison with that estimated from the sum of the individual 5-hydroxylase activities of each enantiomer, suggesting enantiomer/enantiomer interaction. In phenobarbital-induced microsomes, the Lineweaver-Burk plot for R(-)-PPF was a single line, but that for S(+)-PPF was biphasic. When racemic PPF was used as a substrate, the plot was biphasic and was shifted to the upper region in comparison with that estimated from the sum of the individual 5-hydroxylase activities of each enantiomer. The observed value of intrinsic clearance of the PPF racemate at lower concentrations (Vmax/Km1) was consistent with the estimated value, suggesting no interaction between R(-)- and S(+)-PPF. These findings indicate that most of the 5-hydroxylation of R(-)- and S(+)-PPF is catalyzed by common cytochrome P-450 species, but a part of S(+)-PFF 5-hydroxylation is catalyzed by another phenobarbital inducible cytochrome P-450 species, particularly at lower substrate concentrations.",

The CAD(+) and PMI groups were distinguished from the CAD(-) and controls by raised concentrations of plasma triglyceride, very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol, small, dense LDL (LDL-III density (d) 1.044-1.060 g/ml) and lower concentrations of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and large, buoyant LDL (LDL-I d 1.025-1.034 g/ml). In all groups, a subfraction of intermediate density, LDL-II (d 1.034-1.044 g/ml), was the predominant LDL species but was not related to coronary heart disease risk. Plasma triglyceride showed a positive association with LDL-II (r = 0.51, P < 0.001) below a triglyceride level of 1.5 mmol/l. Above this threshold of 1.5 mmol/l, LDL-II and LDL-I showed significant negative associations with triglyceride (LDL-II r = -0.5, P < 0.001; LDL-I r = -0.45, P < 0.001). Small, dense LDL-III showed a weak positive association with triglyceride that became highly significant above the 1.5 mmol/l threshold (r = 0.54, P < 0.001). While age was positively related to LDL-II within the control subjects (r = 0.3, P < 0.05), there was no difference in the percentage abundance or concentration of LDL-III within control and CAD(-) subjects above and below the age of 40 years. Smoking was associated with a relative deficiency of the LDL-I subfraction (LDL-I to LDL-III ratio in smokers = 0.77, in ex-smokers = 0.95, in non-smokers = 1.89; P < 0.01), as was beta-blocker medication (% LDL-I, users vs. non-users, P < 0.05). Both of these effects could be explained by their primary influence on plasma triglyceride. Analysis of the frequency distributions for the three LDL subfractions revealed the concentration of small, dense LDL-III to be bimodal around a concentration of 100 mg (lipoprotein mass)/100 ml plasma. The calculation of odds ratios based on this figure indicated relative risk estimates of 4.5 (chi 2: P < 0.01) for the presence of coronary artery disease and 6.9 (chi 2: P < 0.001) for myocardial infarction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

CGRP (0.1-3.0 nmol i.c.v.) increased mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) and HR. CGRP (3.0 nmol i.c.v.) also significantly increased both plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine concentrations. Pretreatment with 16.5 nmol i.c.v. CGRP(8-37), a specific CGRP receptor antagonist, significantly inhibited the i.c.v. CGRP (1.0 nmol)-induced increases in MABP and HR. Phenoxybenzamine inhibited the i.c.v. CGRP-induced increase in MABP, while propranolol suppressed the tachycardiac response to i.c.v. CGRP. Chemical sympathectomy by 6-hydroxydopamine inhibited the increases in MABP and HR produced by i.c.v. CGRP. These results suggest that the central pressor and tachycardiac effects of i.c.v. CGRP are mediated by catecholamine release due to stimulation of sympathetic nervous system activity, possibly via specific CGRP receptors in the central nervous system.", 
    "113": "The results of binding studies suggest the presence of histamine H1-receptors in human monocytes, but it is not known whether these receptors are functionally active. This prompted us to study the effects of histamine (HA) on cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and superoxide anion (O2-) formation in HL-60 cells differentiated towards monocytes with 1 alpha,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol. In HL-60 monocytes, HA increased [Ca2+]i with a half-maximal effect at 8 microM and a maximum at 30-100 microM. Pertussis toxin (PTX) partially inhibited the stimulatory effects of HA on [Ca2+]i. Betahistine, a weak partial H1-receptor agonist, also increased [Ca2+]i, whereas H2- and H3-receptor agonists were ineffective. H1- but not H2- and H3-receptor antagonists inhibited HA-induced rises in [Ca2+]i. HA-induced rises in [Ca2+]i were desensitized in a homologous manner and were also inhibited by the activator of protein kinase C, 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Various protein kinase C inhibitors did not interfere with homologous desensitization. The stimulatory effects of HA on [Ca2+]i were completely dependent on the presence of extracellular Ca2+ and were inhibited by the blocker of non-selective cation (NSC) channels, 1-(beta-[3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propoxyl]-4-methoxyphenethyl)-1 H-imidazole hydrochloride (SK & F 96365). HA was much less effective than the chemotactic peptide, N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (fMLP), to induce rises in [Ca2+]i. Unlike fMLP, HA did not activate O2- formation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "114": "It has been shown previously that biogenic amines and a number of pharmaceutical agents can redistribute across vesicle membranes in response to imposed potassium ion or proton gradients. Surprisingly, drug accumulation is observed for vesicles exhibiting either a pH gradient (interior acidic) or a membrane potential (interior negative), implying that these compounds can traverse the lipid bilayer as either the neutral or charged species. This interpretation, however, is complicated by the fact that vesicles exhibiting a membrane potential (interior negative) accumulate protons in response to this potential, thereby creating a pH gradient (interior acidic). This raises the possibility that in both vesicle systems drug redistribution occurs in response to the proton gradient present. We have therefore compared the uptake of several lipophilic cations by reconstituted cytochrome c oxidase vesicles and by similar vesicles exhibiting a potassium ion diffusion potential. While turnover of the oxidase generates a membrane potential of comparable magnitude to the potassium ion diffusion system, it is associated with a proton gradient of opposite polarity (interior basic). Both systems show rapid uptake of the permanently charged lipophilic cation, tetraphenylphosphonium, but only the potassium ion diffusion system accumulates the lipophilic amines doxorubicin and propranolol. This provides compelling evidence that such weak bases redistribute only in response to pH gradients and not membrane potential.", 
    "115": "To assess the influence of intrauterine growth retardation on heart rate (HR) and HR variability during sleep, we performed polygraphic recordings in 10 small-for-gestational age (SGA) and 16 appropriate-for-gestational age (AGA) newborns. Both groups were clinically and neurologically normal and were at 37 to 41 wk conceptional age. RR intervals were analyzed using the short-time Fourier transform in three frequency bands: 1) high frequency, with a period 3-8 heartbeat; 2) mid frequency, with a period 10-25 heartbeat; and 3) low frequency, with a period 30-100 heartbeat. In both active and quiet sleep, SGA newborns significantly differed from AGA newborns by having a shorter RR interval (p < 0.01) and lower amplitude of HR variability in all bands (p < 0.05) except low frequency in quiet sleep. Quiet sleep differed from active sleep by having a longer RR interval (p < 0.05), higher high-frequency variability (p < 0.02) in both SGA and AGA newborns, and lower low-frequency variability (p < 0.005 for AGA newborns). Our data give evidence of clear modifications of both sympathetic and parasympathetic HR control in the at-risk SGA population. Similarity of between-state characteristics suggests maintained CNS control of HR in SGA as well as in AGA newborns. We speculate that between-group HR and HR variability differences may be related to augmented metabolic rate in SGA compared with AGA newborns.", 
    "116": "Residence at high altitude has been associated with elevation in systemic arterial blood pressure, but the time course has been little studied and the mechanism is unknown. Because plasma epinephrine (E) and norepinephrine (NE) also increase at altitude, we hypothesized that heightened sympathoadrenal activity may cause increased arterial pressure. We measured ambulatory blood pressure by cuff monitor in relation to 24-h urinary excretion of E and NE at sea level and during 3 wk of residence at 4,300 m (Pikes Peak, CO) in 11 healthy men. In five subjects taking placebo, arterial pressure progressively increased at 4,300 m from 82 +/- 1 (SE) mmHg at sea level to 88 +/- 3 on day 2, 91 +/- 3 on day 8, and 97 +/- 6 on day 17. In six subjects, propranolol (240 mg/day) decreased pressure from 85 +/- 4 to 77 +/- 1 mmHg at sea level but did not prevent sustained increase in pressure at 4,300 m (84 +/- 1, 81 +/- 1, and 85 +/- 3 mmHg on days 2, 8, and 17, respectively). Compared with the placebo group, blood pressure did not increase further over the initial elevation observed on day 2 in the propranolol group. There was interindividual variability in the blood pressure responses in both groups, with some subjects demonstrating a more marked increase in blood pressure. Urinary excretion of NE increased concomitantly with pressure at altitude in both groups, with a greater rise in the placebo group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "118": "This study examined the role of the adrenergic system in the regulation of growth hormone (GH) secretion in sheep. Intravenous infusion of noradrenaline (0.5 microgram/kg per min for 2 hr) totally suppressed plasma GH concentrations. Concomitant treatment of animals with the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol completely blocked the noradrenaline-induced suppression of GH. In contrast, intravenous injection of the centrally acting alpha 2-agonist clonidine (2 micrograms/kg) elicited a release of GH. To further investigate the central adrenergic regulation of GH secretion 10 micrograms of noradrenaline or adrenaline was microinjected (1 microliter) directly into the preoptic area of the hypothalamus of ovariectomized ewes. When the time of injection coincided with a GH trough period, both noradrenaline and adrenaline caused an increase in plasma GH concentrations, whereas if the injection coincided with an endogenous pulse of GH no additional GH response was obtained. In conclusion, these results provide evidence for the involvement of the adrenergic system in the regulation of GH secretion in sheep. Centrally, adrenergic pathways exert a stimulatory effect on GH release via an alpha 2-adrenergic system, whereas peripherally adrenergic pathways exert an inhibitory effect via beta-adrenergic mediated mechanisms. Furthermore, adrenergic stimulation of the preoptic area may inhibit somatostatin activity and directly facilitate a GH pulse. Alternatively, adrenergic innervation of the preoptic area may influence neurons (somatostatin or other) that project to the arcuate nucleus and stimulate the release of GH-releasing factor.",

After propranolol administration, (1) in normal vessels in both groups, the baseline luminal diameter varied in parallel with the changes in myocardial O2 demand; (2) narrowings in group 1 patients invariably dilated and in group 2 the caliber varied according to changes in O2 demand; (3) during cold stimulation, luminal narrowing in group 1 varied in parallel with O2 demand, and, in group 2, vessels were uniformly constricted.",

Rinsaterine, a 5-HT2 receptor blocker, reduces PP in experimental models of PH. This pilot study was designed to verify if ritanserine has a sustained and additive effect to propranolol on PP in cirrhotic patients with PH. Ten chronic patients with EV, under prophylactic therapy with propranolol and with a suprahepatic venous pressure gradient (SVPG) > 12 mm Hg, received ritanserine (0.11-0.14 mg/kg/day). One patients completed one month of treatment due to drug intolerance. Nine patients completed one month of treatment; SVPG did not show any significant variation in four patients and decreased 3 mm Hg in five patients, which were treated during 70 days more. After then, HVPG returned to its previous values except in one patient. The long-term association between ritanserine and propranolol does not improve the results of propranolol. However, the initial response observed in all of these patients supports the role of the serotoninergic system in the PH and states the need for further studies on 5-HT2 blocking for the prophylaxis of EV rupture."
