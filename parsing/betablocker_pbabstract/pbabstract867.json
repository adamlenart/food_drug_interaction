    "0": "In controlled trials of the beta-adrenergic blocking drugs oxprenolol and practolol in hypertension both drugs were well tolerated without side effects and caused statistically significant non-postural reduction of blood pressure. In less than half the patients on eitherdrug the reduction of blood pressure was clinically adequate. No attempt was made to compare the two drugs.", 
    "1": "To investigate the role of the autonomic nervous system in controlling insulin secretion 13 normal subjects and 5 patients with heart failure underwent insulin secretion tests. Alpha-adrenergic stimulation and beta-receptor blockade significantly depressed the secretion of insulin in response to intravenous tolbutamide in normal subjects, while both alpha-blockade and beta-stimulation significantly increased the insulin secretion response in both normal subjects and patients in heart failure. Parasympathetic stimulation and blockade had no significant effect on the insulin secretion response. These findings suggest that drugs that block the alpha-adrenergic receptors or stimulate the beta-adrenergic receptors by their ability to counteract the insulin suppression resulting from increased sympathetic nervous activity may play a vital metabolic part in the deranged metabolism of the failing heart in addition to their direct haemodynamic benefits.", 
    "2": "Twenty-one patients with muscular subaortic stenosis were treated with oral propranolol for periods of 6 to 34 months for a total of 42.5 patient years. The average follow-up was 2 years. Four patients with latent obstruction became asymptomatic on propranolol therapy. Of the 17 patients with resting obstruction, 7 improved, 2 were unchanged, 5 deteriorated, and 2 died during the period of treatment. The 7 patients with resting obstruction who are still improved on propranolol have had relatively short periods of treatment (average 15 months), and none experienced the degree of improvement that occurred in the patients with latent obstruction. This study indicates that propranolol is most effective in patients with muscular subaortic stenosis who have latent obstruction. It is of limited value in patients with resting obstruction because the benefit of propranolol therapy in the majority of these patients is eventually overtaken by progression in the disease.", 
    "3": "In order to assess the role of the autonomic system in the age differences in heart rate, propranolol 0.2 mg./kg. and atropine 30 micrograms/kg. were given to 103 infants and children during the course of heart catheterization. Mean control minute heart rate varied from 118 at age 1 year to 81 at age 16 years. Heart rate after drugs was termed intrinsic heart rate after Jose, and the mean varied from 139 at age 1 to 102 at age 16 years. After propranolol alone, mean heart rate was 120 at age 1, 71 at age 16, and after atropine corresponding rates were 162 and 128. The scatter in predicting heart rate from age was not lessened by autonomic blockade, suggesting that inter-individual variations in heart rate are not entirely dependent on different levels of autonomic function. The inverse relation between heart rate and age persisted after autonomic blockade, indicating that different levels of autonomic function are not responsible for the age differences in heart rate. The most important determinant of the heart rate after blockade was the initial control heart rate. Increases in cardiac index followed autonomic blockade in patients over 4 years of age and in patients without intracardiac shunts, while stroke index decreased, and femoral artery pressure increased 2/7 mm. Hg.", 
    "4": "The long-term results of 356 episodes of atrial defibrillation by DC shock carried out in 250 patients are reviewed. In 78 per cent of the cases, atrial fibrillation recurred by the end of 12 months in spite of the administration of quinidine or procainamide or propranolol, singly or combined. However, when no antidysrhythmic drugs were used the recurrence rate was higher at all periods of observation and 100 per cent at the end of 12 months. The difference in the overall results between the untreated group and the treated groups with the exception of the propranolol group is significant (p less than 0.05). In addition, the propranolol group showed an obviously reduced recurrence rate at 1 month, but afterwards the results tended to approximate those in the untreated group. The period during which sinus rhythm could be maintained in patients who underwent valve operations was on the whole the same as in patients who did not have heart surgery. However, in a small number of patients sinus rhythm was maintained for longer periods after mitral valve replacement than before it. Sinus rhythm was maintained for significantly longer periods when atrial fibrillation lasted less than 1 year than when it had been present for more than 1 year (p less than 0.001). It is concluded that there is justification for a judicious antidysrhythmic prophylaxis after atrial defibrillation.", 
    "5": "After blockade of myocardial, but not coronary vascular beta-adrenoceptors by practolol, cardiac sympathetic stimulation or exogenously administered noradrenaline gave rise to coronary vasoconstriction, possibly due to stimulation of coronary alpha-adrenoceptors.", 
    "6": "1. Administration of two doses of amphetamine HCl (5 mg/kg intraperitoneally) 45 min apart raised body temperature of rats by an average of 3.4 degrees C and increased the turnover rate of brain 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) by almost one-half.2. Both effects were blocked by exposure to 4 degrees C or by pretreatment with the beta-blocker K\u00f6 592 (1-(2-methylphenoxy)-3-isopropylamine-2-propanol), but not by the administration of the ganglionic blocker chlorisondamine combined with atropine.3. Since it has previously been shown that hyperthermia per se increases the turnover rate of brain 5-HT, and that amphetamine does not directly affect the uptake and release of 5-HT in brain slices, it is concluded that the amphetamine-induced increase in 5-HT turnover may be secondary to the rise in temperature produced by the drug.", 
    "7": "1. The responses of pigeon duodenal villi to intravenous injection or local application of \"autonomic drugs\" were studied and compared with those reported in dogs by other workers.2. Choline esters, anticholinesterases, noradrenaline, adrenaline and nicotine all stimulated villous movement in the pigeon. Similar responses to these drugs have been reported in the dog. The effects of these drugs on villous activity could be inhibited by pretreatment of the bird with suitable antagonists, although hexamethonium was ineffective in preventing the effects of nicotine. Some of the antagonists also stimulated the villi.3. Isoprenaline caused inhibition of villous movements, which could be prevented by pretreatment of the bird with propranolol. It appears that in pigeons the villi have both alpha-adrenoceptors, stimulation of which increases villous activity, and beta-adrenoceptors, stimulation of which depresses villous movements.", 
    "8": "1. Chronotropic dose-response curves (non-cumulative) for beta-adrenoceptive antagonists were constructed from results in rats anaesthetized with pentobarbitone and depleted of catecholamines by pre-treatment with syrosingopine.2. Depletion of catecholamines lowered resting heart rate and reduced the threshold to the chronotropic action of isoprenaline by about 50%. Eight beta-adrenoceptive antagonists produced a dose-dependent chronotropic response but the maximum response was in all cases smaller than that obtained with isoprenaline. The order of activity was dichloroisoprenaline>LB 46>practolol>INPEA>oxprenolol>pronethalol>alprenolol>I.C.I. 45,763 (K\u00f6 592). Propranolol and sotalol were without significant activity. The duration of the chronotropic response to the antagonists was more prolonged than that to isoprenaline. Propranolol caused a parallel shift to the right of the dose-response curves for the agonist effects of the antagonists.3. Estimation of beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity in anaesthetized cats gave an order of activity dissimilar to that found for maximum agonist responses: LB 46 > oxprenolol > alprenolol > propranolol > I.C.I. 45,763 > practolol > dichloroisoprenaline > sotalol > INPEA > pronethalol.4. Consideration of chemical structure and physico-chemical properties did not explain the differences between the agonist activities of the adrenoceptive antagonists.", 
    "9": "Our studies demonstrated that phenoxybenzamine, 10 mg/kg, administered intravenously to intact anesthetized dogs, produced an immediate and significant increase of heart rate and cardiac output. In heart-lung preparations, phenoxybenzamine had no effect or a negative cardiac inotropic effect, hence these actions were not related to direct cardiac action or to release of myocardial norepinephrine stores. Serial estimations of arterial blood catecholamines after phenoxybenzamine showed an increase of epinephrine and norepinephrine; the peak values of these catecholamines did not correlate well with the maximum cardiac output responses. Ganglionic blockade largely eliminated the early cardiac effects of phenoxybenzamine, hence its action did not appear to be upon peripheral terminals of postganglionic sympathetic or parasympathetic nerves. Phenoxybenzamine was found to have antivagal actions which might account for some of the delayed cardiac acceleration. When beta adrenergic receptor blockade was induced by sotalol, the cardiac effects of phenoxybenzamine were largely eliminated. Baroreceptor denervation prevented the increase of cardiac output after phenoxybenzamine. These observations are consistent with the concept that the increase of cardiac rate and output produced by phenoxybenzamine is principally mediated by baroreceptor reflexes acting through sympathetic cardiac nerves or circulating catecholamines.", 
    "10": "Recordings of the transmembrane action potential of the cardiac myofibril from a patient with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy showed that the repolarization time was appreciably prolonged and that the maximum rate of follow was grossly reduced. This electrical abnormality is compatible with the late and irregular activation of the ventricular muscle in the disease. Propranolol was found to produce a similar \"quinidine-like\" effect on the transmembrane actionpotential in both cardiomyopathic and control tissue.", 
    "11": "1. The antihypertensive action of methyldopa was investigated in the light of the prevailing false sympathetic neurotransmitter hypothesis of Day & Rand (1963). Immunosympathectomized and normal animals were used for the investigation.2. Methyldopa in a single injection significantly decreased the blood pressure in control hypertensive, immunosympathectomized normotensive, and normal rats. Guanethidine did not decrease the blood pressure of immunosympathectomized rats; it decreased the blood pressure of control and control hypertensive rats.3. The hypotensive effect of methyldopa was not antagonized by adrenoceptor and ganglion blocking agents or by the inhibition of dopamine beta-oxidase.4. High doses of methyldopa produced less hypotension than relatively low doses. This might be due to an antagonism of the hypotensive effect by methylnoradrenaline, which is formed from methyldopa.5. The antihypertensive action of methyldopa could not be correlated with any change in aortic sodium or potassium.6. It is concluded that methyldopa does not exert its hypotensive effect by producing a weakly active false sympathetic neurotransmitter.", 
    "12": "An analysis of the role of adrenergic transmission in mediating the hyperpolarizing, slow inhibitory postsynaptic potential has revealed that dopamine is apparently the specific synaptic transmitter for this response. An additional action of dopamine was discovered, namely the selective facilitation of another synaptic response, the slow excitatory postsynaptic potential. (This potential is a depolarizing response to the muscarinic action of acetylcholine.) This second, modulatory, role of dopamine has characteristics strikingly different from other known modes of synaptic action. After a brief initial action by dopamine, the facilitation of the slow excitatory postsynaptic potential response can persist for hours and is unaffected by a delayed blockade of the postsynaptic receptors for dopamine. This suggests that the modulation consists of a long-lasting metabolic and/or structural change induced in the postsynaptic neuron by dopamine. These conclusions are based on the demonstrated actions of dopamine and other catecholamines, as well as on effects (on dopamine actions and on slow postsynaptic potentials of alpha-adrenergic blockers, of blockade, of dopamine oxidase, of depletion of ganglionic catecholamine by muscarinic excitation, and of a selective re-uptake of dopamine after such depletion.", 
    "13": "The injection of adrenergic and adrenolytic drugs directly into the brain through permanently implanted cannulas has yielded results showing that food consumption in the rat is regulated by a hypothalamic alpha-adrenergic \"hunger\" system. and a hypothalamic beta-adrenergic \"satiety\" system. The rats' differential responses to alpha-adrenergic and beta-adrenergic drugs injected into different hypothalamic sites indicate the following: (1) the lateral hypothalamic \"feeding\" center contains beta receptors, the activation of which produces satiation, presumably by inhibition of the lateral \"feeding\" cells; (2) the ventromedial hypothalamic \"satiety\" center contains alpha receptors, the activation of which produces eating, presumably by inhibition of the ventromedial \"satiety\" cells; and (3) the medio-lateral perifornical area of the hypothalamus contains both alpha and beta receptors, which lead to inhibition of the ventromedial or lateral hypothalamic centers respectively. It is suggested that the ventromedial and lateral hypothalamus are connected by reciprocal circuits, so that activation of the ventromedial center results in stimulation of the lateral beta receptors which inhibit the lateral \"feeding\" cells, and activation of the lateral center results in stimulation of the ventromedial alpha receptors which inhibit the ventromedial \"satiety\" cells."
