Twenty-five per cent of 65-79 year-old-patients (subgroup A1) and 36.15% of 80+ year-old-patients (subgroup A2) received ACEI/ARB. At least one package of NSAID or spironolactone was prescribed to subgroup A1 in 25.44 and 5.80%, respectively, and to subgroup A2 in 22.04 and 9.89%, respectively.

    "4": "ASCOT compared the effect of atenolol combined with a thiazide versus amlodipine with perindopril in hypertensive patients. It also studied the effect of atorvastatin in those with normal cholesterol. ASCOT concluded that reductions in cardiovascular events with atorvastatin were significant, and that amlodipine-based treatment prevented more cardiovascular events. The latter seemed to be due to better control of central blood pressure. Both statin and amlodipine-based treatments were cost-effective. According to the ASCOT study, it does matter how blood pressure is lowered.", 
    "5": "The goal of this proof-of-concept study was the fabrication of drug-loaded silk fibroin (SF) spheres under very mild processing conditions. The spheres were fabricated using the laminar jet break-up of an aqueous SF solution, which was induced by a nozzle vibrating at controlled frequency and amplitude. SF particles were spherical in shape as determined by SEM with diameters in the range of 101 microm to 440 microm, depending on the diameter of the nozzle and the treatment to induce water insolubility of SF. Both treatments, either methanol or exposure to water vapor, resulted in an increase in beta-sheet content as analyzed by FTIR. High encapsulation efficiencies, close to 100%, were obtained when salicylic acid and propranolol hydrochloride-loaded SF spheres were left untreated or exposed to water vapor. Methanol treatment resulted in drug leaching and lowered the overall encapsulation efficiency. When 9% SF solutions were used for SF sphere preparation, release rates were more sustained than from spheres made with 3% SF solutions, and propranolol hydrochloride release was more sustained than salicylic acid release. However, no difference in the release profiles was observed between methanol and water vapor treated SF spheres. Because of its very mild conditions, which are potentially advantageous for the encapsulation of sensitive drugs, we also tested this method for the encapsulation of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). Again encapsulation efficiencies were close to 100%, even after treatment with methanol. IGF-I was continuously released over 7 weeks in bioactive form, as analyzed by the proliferation of MG-63 cells. These results favor further investigation of SF spheres as a platform for the controlled release of sensitive biologicals.", 
    "6": "While acute cortisol administration has been found to impair retrieval of emotional memories in healthy subjects, the duration of this memory impairment is still unknown. Propranolol, on the other hand, may impair the reconsolidation of emotional memories during reactivation, although human studies examining such effects are scarce. The present investigation was therefore undertaken to examine the immediate and prolonged effects of a single administered dose of cortisol or propranolol on memory retrieval in a double-blind placebo controlled design.",

Both the drugs were extracted by simple liquid-liquid extraction with chloroform. The chromatographic separation was performed on a reversed-phase peerless basic C18 column with a mobile phase of methanol-water containing 0.5% formic acid (8:2, v/v). The protonated analyte was quantitated in positive ionization by multiple reaction monitoring with a mass spectrometer. The method was validated over the concentration range of 1-100 ng/ml for MPS and 1-15 ng/ml AM in human plasma. The MRM transition of m/z 268.10-103.10, m/z 409.10-334.20 and m/z 296.00-205.10 were used to measure MPS, AM and HCTZ (IS), respectively.

    "19": "The treatment of chronic heart failure secondary to Chagas disease has been based on extrapolation of data achieved in the treatment of non-Chagas disease heart failure. Because beta-blockers decrease the incidence of sudden cardiac death in non-Chagas disease heart failure and sudden cardiac death occurs preferentially in patients with mild Chagas disease heart failure, beta-blockers may be administered first to class I/II patients with Chagas disease heart failure. In advanced Chagas disease heart failure, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and diuretics may be given at first to compensate for congestive symptoms. After clinical status improvement, beta-blockers should be given at targeted doses, if necessary reducing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor doses. Primary and secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death may be accomplished with implantable cardioverter defibrillators because of the high recurrence of life-threatening arrhythmias despite amiodarone administration. In refractory heart failure, heart transplantation is the treatment of choice.",

Eligible patients were administered the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire by a blinded interviewer and were randomized to receive metoprolol (starting dose 25 mg) or nebivolol (starting dose 2.5 mg) once daily for 6 weeks. The first dose was administered before patients left the clinic. Visits were scheduled for 1, 2, 4, and 6 weeks after the initiation of therapy.

Four formulations were prepared. Formulations MF-1, MF-2, MF-3 and MF-4 were composed of EC and PVP in the following ratios: 4.5:0.5, 4:1, 3:2 and 2:3 respectively. The formulations were subjected to various physical characterization studies namely, thickness, weight variation, drug content, moisture uptake, in vitro drug release and in vitro skin permeation. The in vitro permeation studies were carried out across excised porcine ear skin using Franz diffusion cell. Cumulative amounts of the drug released in 24 hours from the four formulations were 69.58%, 96.13%, 98.85% and 99.60%, respectively. Corresponding values for the cumulated amounts of drug permeated across the porcine skin for the above matrix films were 124.38, 153.22, 156.46 and 163.25 mug/cm(2) respectively. By fitting the data into zero order, first order and Higuchi model, it was concluded that drug release from matrix films followed Higuchi model (r(2)=0.9147-0.9823), and the mechanism of release was diffusion mediated. Based on the physical evaluation, in vitro drug release & permeation characteristics, it was concluded that for potential therapeutic use, monolithic drug matrix films MF-3, composed of EC: PVP (3:2), may be suitable for the development of a transdermal drug delivery system of MT.", 
    "25": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of Timolol maleate on tear film break-up time in a Nigerian population. 192 eyes of 96 subjects were examined in a hospital based case-control study after being administered pre-coded questionnaires. The mean tear film break-up time was measured. There was significant difference (t = 10.164, P < 0.001) in the mean break-up time of cases (10.45 secs) and controls (30.18 secs). Half of the cases had some ocular discomfort with the instillation of Timolol maleate, a significant number of them having just been commenced on the medication (chi2 = 8.889, P = 0.003). Long-term instillation of Timolol maleate impairs tear film stability. The ocular discomfort experienced by patients on Timolol may contribute to poor drug compliance observed in patients on chronic drug therapy. Regular screening of patients on Timolol maleate for tear film instability and dry eyes is important and drug manufacturers should explore the possibility of incorporating artificial tears in Timolol maleate preparation.", 
    "26": "Congenital long QT syndrome is an inherited disorder of cardiac repolarization that predisposes to syncope and to sudden death from polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. The disorder should be suspected when the electrocardiogram shows characteristic QT abnormalities, or when there is a family history of long QT syndrome or of an event that raises suspicion of long QT syndrome, such as sudden death, syncope, or ill-defined \"seizure\" disorder. We can now classify some types of congenital long QT syndrome according to their genetic mutations and their triggers, such as exercise, rest, or startle.", 
    "27": "The role of beta-receptor selectivity for the interaction between the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) insertion/deletion polymorphism and beta-blocker therapy was investigated in 479 subjects with left ventricular dysfunction. Subjects were separated into no beta-blocker, beta1 -selective, and nonselective beta-blocker treatment groups. The D allele adversely affected transplant-free survival for subjects not on beta-blockers (p= 0.004). Treatment with selective beta1-blockers eliminated the impact of the D allele (p= 0.51) in a manner similar to nonselective beta1,2-blockers (p= 0.80). Treatment with beta1-blockers was sufficient to eliminate the adverse impact of the ACE D allele, suggesting this pharmacogenetic interaction is mediated through the beta1-receptor.", 
    "28": "Several classes of antihypertensive drugs have been shown to improve vascular function through mechanisms other than reducing blood pressure (BP) alone. Certain dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) increase nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and decrease oxidative stress, thereby improving endothelial activity and vascular function. Pulse wave analyses have shown that these agents reduce the impact of pressure wave reflections on central systolic BP (SBP), consistent with a decrease in arterial stiffness. The complementary vascular mechanisms of these drug classes suggest that combination therapy may be effective for improving clinical outcomes. In animal model studies, combination calcium channel/RAS blockade has been shown to be more effective in improving endothelial dysfunction than treatment with drugs from either class alone. Furthermore, results from recent clinical trials suggest a greater reduction in central aortic SBP, pulse pressure, and cardiovascular events with calcium channel/RAS blockade vs. beta-blocker/diuretic therapy. These studies support the potential benefit of combination calcium channel and RAS blockade in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease.", 
    "29": "Previously, we showed that orexin-A, a 33-aa peptide, influences renal sympathetic nerve activity. Because the autonomic nervous system plays an important role in the regulation of lipid metabolism, we investigated the in vivo effects of orexin-A on the sympathetic nerve activity innervating white adipose tissue (WAT-SNA) and lipolysis. We found that intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of orexin-A at doses of 1 microg/rat and 10 ng/rat elevated and suppressed WAT-SNA, respectively. The effect of the high dose of orexin-A (1 microg/rat) was eliminated by pretreatment with diphenhydramine hydrochloride, a histamine H(1) receptor antagonist. In contrast, the effect of the low dose of orexin-A (10 ng/rat) was suppressed by thioperamide maleate salt, a histamine H(3) receptor antagonist. Moreover, icv administration of 1 microg/rat and 10 ng/rat of orexin-A increased and decreased the levels of plasma free fatty acids (FFAs), respectively. The effect of 1 microg/rat of orexin-A on plasma FFA was eliminated by propranolol hydrochloride, a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker, and also by diphenhydramine. The effect of orexin-A at dose of 10 ng/rat disappeared by pretreatment with atropine sulfate, a muscarinic receptor blocker, and thioperamide maleate salt. Our results suggest that high doses of orexin-A may regulate the lipolytic processes in adipose tissue through facilitation of the sympathetic nervous system, which is driven by histamine neurons through the H(1) receptor, and that the beta(3)-receptor may be involved in this enhanced lipolytic response. Low doses of orexin-A, on the other hand, may lower lipolysis by suppressing sympathetic nerve activity via the H(3)-receptor, and the muscarinic receptor may be related to this response.", 
    "30": "Endogenous polyamines mediate acute metabolic effects and cardiac hypertrophy associated to beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. The aim of this study is to characterize the role of polyamines on beta-adrenoceptor system mediated responses. To this end, the functional interaction of polyamine modifying drugs on isoproterenol-elicited cardiotonic effect, in isolated left atria of male Wistar rats, and their effects on [(3)H]dihydroalprenolol (DHA) binding on beta-adrenoceptors and on adenylyl cyclase activity of membrane heart were studied. Polyamines interact with beta-adrenoceptors in rat heart, as shown by the displacement of [(3)H]DHA binding. Furthermore, putrescine (but not spermidine or spermine) increased adenylyl cyclase activity, elicited a positive inotropism and increased intracellular cAMP. The putrescine effect on adenylyl cyclase was not antagonized by the beta-adrenoceptors blockers, alprenolol and ICI-118,551, and facilitated the isoproterenol effect. Neither alprenolol, atenolol nor ICI-118,551 antagonized putrescine-elicited positive inotropism. However, the effect was abolished in preparations with desensitized beta-adrenoceptors. alpha-Difluoromethylornithine, an inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, antagonized the effect of isoproterenol on inotropism and cAMP increase. In addition, putrescine might elicit effects by mechanisms independent of beta-adrenoceptor system, since in left atria with functional desensitized receptors an interaction with ouabain-elicited cardiotonic effect was observed. These results suggest that putrescine may act as a low affinity agonist on beta-adrenoceptors and modulate acute responses mediated by beta-adrenoceptors. These findings may be of importance in the physiology and in diseases involving cardiac beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "31": "The medical treatment available for patients with essential tremor (ET) is often inadequate. Furthermore, the efficacy of the medical treatments currently available for patients with ET of cranial nerve areas is less satisfactory than that of the medical treatments available for patients with ET involving the upper extremities. This pilot study was performed to evaluate whether zonisamide (ZNS) is effective in the treatment of patients with isolated head tremor.", 
    "32": "All subjects with isolated head tremor were randomly treated with either ZNS or propranolol. After a washout period, the subjects were switched to the alternative drug.", 
    "33": "ZNS was found to be more effective in the treatment of patients with isolated head tremor than propranolol. No severe adverse effects were reported with either ZNS or propranolol.",

    "35": "Preventing left ventricular (LV) remodeling after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) is important to avoid long-term congestive heart failure. The present study evaluated the effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and beta-blockers on LV remodeling. Twenty-three patients with angina pectoris and 36 with old myocardial infarction underwent CABG. We assessed end diastolic volume index (EDVI), end systolic volume index (ESVI), and ejection fraction (EF) using left ventriculography before and after CABG. Changes in EDVI, ESVI, and EF were studied in the ACEI, beta-blocker, and control groups. Although EDVI was reduced in the ACEI group, ESVI and EF improved only slightly, whereas in the group given beta-blockers, ESVI was reduced, EF improved, and EDVI was minimally reduced. These results indicate that ACEIs and beta-blockers both protect against LV remodeling, although through different mechanisms.", 
    "36": "Peak capacity (i.e. maximal number of resolved peaks that fit in a chromatographic window) is a theoretical concept with growing interest, but based on a situation rarely met in practice. Real chromatograms tend to have uneven distributions, with overlapped peaks and large gaps. The number of resolved compounds should, therefore, be known from estimations. Several equations have been reported for this purpose based on three perspectives, namely, the intuitive approach (peak capacity as the size of the retention time window measured in peak width units), which assumes peaks with the same width, and the outlines of Giddings and Grushka, which consider changes in peak width with retention time. In this work, the peak capacity concept is discussed and three new approaches are derived based on realistic descriptions of peak shape. The first one is based on the Grushka's approach and considers the contributions of column and extra-column peak variances. The second one relies on Giddings' and assumes asymmetrical peaks where left and right peak half-widths depend linearly on retention time. The third equation, based on the intuitive approach, uses a mean peak width obtained by integration, instead of a mean value from several representative peaks. The accuracy of the classical Giddings' approach for ideal peaks, a modification of the Grushka's approach that considers variation of peak width at half-height, and the three new approaches were checked on combined chromatograms built by adding real peaks. The results demonstrate that the change in efficiency (and not in skewness) is the relevant factor, at least in the studied examples. Also, peak width should be measured at low peak height ratios (i.e. 10%) to better account peak deformation.", 
    "37": "It is found that 4,4'-bipyridines functionalized in their 3,3'-positions with Fr\u00e9chet dendrons of 0th to 3rd generation self-assemble with (dppp)M(II) triflates (dppp: bis-(diphenylphosphino)propane; M = Pd, Pt) into metallo-supramolecular squares. They bear a nanometer-sized cavity inside an unpolar dendritic shell. A total of eight amide groups decorate the rims of the cavity connecting the dendrons to the square. Evidence for their formation up to the third generation comes from ESI-FTICR mass spectrometry and NMR experiments. Based on these results, the presence of significant amounts of other polygons or open-chain oligomers can be excluded. Exchange processes have been studied by variable-temperature NMR spectroscopy and by following the ligand exchanges between different squares by mass spectrometry. The ligand exchange is much slower for the Pt(II) squares as compared to their Pd(II) analogs. Visualization of films of these dendrimers using atomic force microscopy (AFM) provides information on their molecular dimensions. After deposition of a square monolayer on the surface, a slow reorganization within this layer is observed which leads to the formation of \"tower-like\" aggregates and multi-layer formation. The interplay of interactions between the dendrimers and the surface and interactions between different dendrimers are invoked to rationalize the observations.", 
    "38": "Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide. Increased intraocular pressure (IOP) is considered to be the most important risk factor. Major outcome studies from recent years have shown that lowering IOP is beneficial in primary open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension. The introduction of new classes of IOP-lowering drugs (alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonists, topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and hypotensive lipids) in the last decade has contributed to a change in the drug prescription pattern. Together with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers), these drugs are now considered to be first-choice classes, giving ophthalmologists ample opportunities to choose from a broad spectrum of IOP-lowering drugs. The number of possible medical treatment combinations has increased likewise.We review medical treatment combinations of two, three or four drugs from the four major first-choice glaucoma drug classes and provide an overview of the scientific evidence for IOP efficacy of second-line medical options when first-line therapy has been effective but additional IOP lowering is necessary. A systematic search of the literature initially revealed 2729 publications. After a thorough selection process, 42 studies were found to be eligible for inclusion in the review. Publications were excluded if the primary endpoint of the study was not IOP or if glaucoma topics other than IOP lowering of drugs were studied. In addition, studies that reported results for monotherapies only were excluded. The vast majority of study arms reported on combinations of a beta-blocker with either a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor or a hypotensive lipid. For a number of treatment combinations no eligible studies were available or could be included.This review shows that combining drugs from the different first-choice classes results in an additional IOP decrease. The exact magnitude of this additional decrease and the patients to whom it applies remain unclear. In many studies, no information on IOP before the run-in phase was available. However, such data are important in order to determine whether patients with high untreated IOP or patients non-responsive to the run-in drug(s) were preferentially included. Another issue that hampers interpretation is the fact that the timepoints of measurements of IOP before and after adding a drug should be related to the peak and trough times of the drugs. Finally, differences between concomitant use and fixed combined use of drugs may have consequences for the interpretation of results.",

    "40": "A 26-year-old man presented with episodes of fatigue, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and chest pain approximately 2 months after the initiation of duloxetine 20 mg/day for dysthymic disorder. Cardiac workup including echocardiogram, exercise treadmill testing, and Holter monitoring was negative, except for tachycardia (heart rate 110-120 beats/min). Duloxetine was withheld, and the patient's heart rate returned to normal in less than a week. Duloxetine was restarted at the same dosage, and tachycardia returned within 2 days. Propranolol was added to the treatment regimen to lower the heart rate. Because of therapeutic failure of other antidepressants, duloxetine was continued because of its beneficial effects on mood.", 
    "41": "One published case report describing tachycardia in association with duloxetine in 2 heart failure patients was found in a MEDLINE search (1966-July 2008). Increased blood pressure and heart rate have been reported in duloxetine trials.

    "43": "In experiments on unanaesthetized rabbits myoelectric activity (contractile activity index) of proximal (postpyloric) and distal sites of duodenum, and proximal part of jejunum was studied under stress induced by fastening a rabbit to a table in supine position. In both sites of duodenum, the stress impact induced a short-time decrease of contractile activity which was followed by its increase that exceeded the initial level. In the proximal part ofjejunum, the increase of contractile activity took place only during the second part of stress response. The strengthening of the contractile activity of the proximal part of duodenum was preserved after muscarinic or nicotinic cholinoceptor blockage, and after beta-receptor blockage. It was concluded that the contractile response of the proximal part of duodenum did not result from the contribution of central or local neurogenic mechanism, including excitatory cholinergic one, but was humoral in origin. The strengthening of the contractile activity of the distal part of duodenum and proximal part ofjejunum was abolished by muscarinic cholinoceptor and beta-receptor blockage, and resulted from the action of circulating catecholamines on the excitatory beta-adrenoceptor, localized on the cholinergic neurones of the enteric nervous system.",

    "45": "Findings from animal studies have suggested that bone remodeling is under beta-adrenergic control. However, the level of adrenergic inhibition required to achieve the most favorable effects on the skeleton remains unknown. To address this question, we compared the effects of low (0.1 mg/Kg/day), medium (5 mg/Kg/day) or high (20 mg/Kg/day) doses of propranolol given 5 days per week for 10 weeks in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Characteristics of bone microarchitecture, biomechanical properties and bone turnover were investigated, whilst heart functions were assessed by echocardiography and catheterization of the left ventricle. We first confirmed the expression of Adrbeta2R and the absence of Adrbeta1R on osteoblasts by PCR and confocal microscopy. We then showed that low dose propranolol prevented OVX induced bone loss by increasing bone formation (+30% of MAR vs. placebo, P = 0.01) and decreasing bone resorption (-52% of osteoclast surface on bone surface vs. placebo, P = 0.01). Consequently, rats receiving 0.1 mg/kg/day propranolol displayed higher stress (+27%), intrinsic energy (+28.7%) and Young's Modulus in compression versus placebo (all, P < 0.05). No significant effects on heart hemodynamic parameters were found in rats receiving this dose. In contrast, medium and high doses of propranolol had a negative effect on heart functions but no significant protective effects on bone mass in ovariectomized rats. These results, consistent with the dominant nature of the high bone mass phenotype and normal heart function of Adrbeta2R-deficient mice, suggest that low doses of beta-blockers may have a therapeutic utility in the treatment of osteoporosis with high selectivity for bone tissues.", 
    "46": "A medical treatment that decreases the likelihood of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction or symptoms would benefit patients with moderate to severe degenerative mitral regurgitation. The aim of this pilot study was to determine the short-term effects of a beta-blocker on mitral regurgitant volume and LV work in these patients.", 
    "47": "Twenty-five patients with moderate or severe degenerative mitral regurgitation were randomized in a double-blind crossover study to the beta(1)-selective adrenergic blocker metoprolol (mean daily dose, 119 mg; range 23.75 to 190 mg) and placebo for 14+/-3 days. At the end of each treatment period, ascending aortic flow and LV stroke volume were measured by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and mitral regurgitant volume was calculated. On beta-blocker, heart rate decreased from 65+/-10 by 10+/-7 bpm (mean+/-SD) and systolic blood pressure decreased from 138+/-18 by 16+/-12 mm Hg (P<0.0001 for both). No significant change occurred in LV ejection fraction (from 65+/-5%; change, -0.6+/-2.7%; P=0.3) or mitral regurgitant volume (from 59+/-36 mL; change, 3+/-13 mL; P=0.3), but forward stroke volume increased from 89+/-21 by 5+/-11 mL (P=0.03). Because heart rate was lower on metoprolol, cardiac output decreased from 5.68+/-1.04 by 0.56+/-0.78 L/min (P=0.001), but a greater decrease occurred in LV output, from 9.51+/-2.22 by 1.30+/-1.08 L/min (P<0.0001). Mitral regurgitant volume per minute decreased from 3.83+/-2.41 by 0.74+/-1.00 L/min (P=0.001). The decrease in LV work on beta-blocker (mean, 21%; 95% confidence interval, 15 to 27) was greater (P=0.001) than the decrease in cardiac output (mean, 9%; 95% confidence interval, 3 to 15).", 
    "48": "In this pilot study, short-term treatment with a beta-blocker did not change mitral regurgitant volume per beat but decreased LV work in patients with moderate to severe degenerative mitral regurgitation. Further research is needed to determine whether longer-term treatment with beta-blockers will decrease progressive LV dysfunction and symptomatic deterioration.", 
    "49": "The purpose of the present study was to investigate the role of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in drug disposition in skin. The distribution of P-gp substrates (rhodamine 123 and itraconazole) to the skin after administration from the epidermal side was lower in P-gp gene knockout (mdr1a/1b(-/-)) mice than that in wild-type mice. Coadministration of propranolol, a P-gp inhibitor, decreased the distribution of itraconazole to the skin in wild-type mice, but not in mdr1a/1b(-/-) mice. These results suggest that P-gp contributes to the influx (from the epidermal side) of its substrates into skin, although P-gp is generally involved in efflux of drugs from various tissues. This finding was supported by the lower vectorial transport of rhodamine 123 from the epidermal to the hypodermal side in mdr1a/1b(-/-) mice in Ussing-type chamber experiments and by the immunohistochemical localization of P-gp throughout the dermal layer. Distribution of itraconazole after intravenous administration, on the other hand, was higher in mdr1a/1b(-/-) mice than that in wild-type mice, suggesting that P-gp transports this drug from the skin to the circulation. The present findings are the first to demonstrate involvement of P-gp in dermal drug disposition.", 
    "50": "G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) is a serine/theorinine kinase that phosphorylates and desensitizes agonist-bound G protein-coupled receptors. GRK2 is increased in expression and activity in lymphocytes and vascular smooth muscle (VSM) in human hypertension and animal models of the disease. Inhibition of GRK2 using the carboxyl-terminal portion of the protein (GRK2ct) has been an effective tool to restore compromised beta-adrenergic receptor (AR) function in heart failure and improve outcome. A well-characterized dysfunction in hypertension is attenuation of betaAR-mediated vasodilation. Therefore, we tested the role of inhibition of GRK2 using GRK2ct or VSM-selective GRK2 gene ablation in a renal artery stenosis model of elevated blood pressure (BP) [the two-kidney, one-clip (2K1C) model]. Use of the 2K1C model resulted in a 30% increase in conscious BP, a threefold increase in plasma norepinephrine levels, and a 50% increase in VSM GRK2 mRNA levels. BP remained increased despite VSM-specific GRK2 inhibition by either GRK2 knockout (GRK2KO) or peptide inhibition (GRK2ct). Although betaAR-mediated dilation in vivo and in situ was enhanced, alpha(1)AR-mediated vasoconstriction was also increased. Further pharmacological experiments using alpha(1)AR antagonists revealed that GRK2 inhibition of expression (GRK2KO) or activity (GRK2ct) enhanced alpha(1D)AR vasoconstriction. This is the first study to suggest that VSM alpha(1D)ARs are a GRK2 substrate in vivo.", 
    "51": "The opening of the Alzheimer's Abeta channel permits the flux of calcium into the cell, thus critically disturbing intracellular ion homeostasis. Peptide segments that include the characteristic histidine (His) diad, His(13) and His(14), efficiently block the Abeta channel activity, blocking Abeta cytotoxicity. We hypothesize that the vicinal His-His peptides coordinate with the rings of His in the mouth of the pore, thus blocking the flow of calcium ions through the channel, with consequent blocking of Abeta cytotoxicity. To test this hypothesis, we studied Abeta ion channel activity and cytotoxicity after the addition of compounds that are known to have His association capacity, such as Ni(2+), imidazole, His, and a series of His-related compounds. All compounds were effective at blocking both Abeta channel and preventing Abeta cytotoxicity. The efficiency of protection of His-related compounds was correlated with the number of imidazole side chains in the blocker compounds. These data reinforce the premise that His residues within the Abeta channel sequence are in the pathway of ion flow. Additionally, the data confirm the contribution of the Abeta channel to the cytotoxicity of exogenous Abeta.",

Groups showed similar baseline values in NYHA class, heart rate, and ejection fraction (EF) and were followed up to 10 years. The resting and mean 24 h heart rate after 1 year decreased by -2.6/-5 bpm in INH, but increased by +3.6/+6.0 bpm in the OPT group (P < 0.001). The QRS interval after 1 year increased by 12 +/- 23 ms in the INH group, but +32 +/- 36 ms in the OPT group (P < 0.01). Patients with INH developed a greater left ventricular EF (LVEF) when compared with OPT patients (+10.6 +/- 8 vs. +2 +/- 10%, respectively; P = 0.04). Changes in LVEF were negatively correlated with heart rate, but not with QRS width changes. Prognosis and the event rate were better in the INH group.",

    "55": "The chiral recognition mechanisms responsible for the enantioselective binding on the alpha3beta4 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha3 beta4 nAChR) and human organic cation transporter 1 (hOCT1) have been reviewed. The results indicate that chiral recognition on the alpha3beta4 nAChR is a process involving initial tethering of dextromethorphan and levomethorphan at hydrophobic pockets within the central lumen followed by hydrogen bonding interactions favoring dextromethorphan. The second step is the defining enantioselective step. Studies with the hOCT1 indentified four binding sites within the transporter that participated in chiral recognition. Each of the enantiomers of the compounds used in the study interacted with three of these sites, while (R)-verapamil interacted with all four. Chiral recognition arose from the conformational adjustments required to produce optimum interactions. With respect to the prevailing interaction-based models, the data suggest that chiral recognition is a dynamic process and that the static point-based models should be amended to reflect this.", 
    "56": "We compared arterial blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) control in 9- to 11-week old obese Zucker rats (n=10; weight=452+/-45 g, average+/-SD) to age-matched, lean Zucker animals (n=13; weight=280+/-46 g). BP was measured by indwelling catheter. Baseline pressure was 113.1+/-7.0 mm Hg in the lean vs. 111.7+/-5.6 in the obese rats (NS). Baseline HR was 413+/-43 in the lean vs. 422+/-22 bpm in the obese animals (NS). Rats were classically conditioned by following a 15-second tone (CS+) with a 0.5-second tail shock. There were no between-group differences in the BP response to CS+. Conversely, heart rate (HR) decreased significantly (p<0.05) more during the last 10 s of the tone in the lean group (-46.0+/-21.5 bpm) vs. the obese (-17.8+/-21.7 bpm). This bradycardia was blocked by atropine. Finally, the change in HR divided by the change in arterial BP (DeltaHR/DeltaBP) following an intravenous bolus of phenylephrine (PE; 5 microg/kg) and following sodium nitroprusside (NP; 5 microg/kg) was determined. The DeltaHR/DeltaBP following PE was smaller in the obese (n=6; -1.36+/-0.60) vs. lean (n=5; -2.80+/-0.92); there was no difference in the response following NP. These data indicate that the BP response to a behavioral challenge did not differ in the obese rat vs. the lean animal, but that the obese subjects had an attenuated parasympathetic response to the stress, probably secondary to alterations in baroreflex function.",

Although many drugs administered to these patients decrease BP, the relationship between changes in BP and survival has not been investigated. Nor have previous analyses distinguished among different forms of death. We investigated the influence of baseline BP and changes in BP during a 1-year period on the survival of patients with HF, distinguishing among sudden cardiac death, nonsudden cardiac death, and noncardiac death. We also identified the possible relationship with the baseline values of and changes in other clinical and treatment variables, including pharmacologic treatments.", 
    "59": "A total of 1062 patients with chronic HF included in the Spanish National Registry of Sudden Death (mean age of 64.5 +/- 11.8 years, 72% were men, and 21% were in New York Heart Association class III with a mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 36.7% +/- 14.2%) were prospectively investigated for a mean of 1.9 +/- 0.6 years. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for clinical and therapeutic variables showed an independent association between low baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) and nonsudden cardiac death (hazard ratio [HR] 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.93-0.98), but changes in SBP during the following year did not influence survival, regardless of the baseline SBP level (P = .55). Contrariwise, baseline diastolic BP was not associated with mortality, but an increase in diastolic BP during the following year showed a borderline independent significant association with lower nonsudden cardiac death (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.82-1.00). Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or beta-blockers at baseline was also associated with lower nonsudden cardiac mortality, as was an increase in left ventricular ejection fraction during the following year (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.51-0.93; P = .015).", 
    "60": "Among patients with stable HF, low SBP is associated with a greater risk of nonsudden cardiac death. The change in SBP during a 1-year period has no prognostic value. Because the beneficial effects of drugs associated with increased survival (in this study, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers) thus seem to be independent of their effects on BP, changes in BP should probably not influence the decision to use such drugs or continue their administration.",

Titration of these agents is guided by clinic blood pressure readings; however, the impact of such treatment on blood pressure is unknown because diurnal blood pressure patterns remain poorly described.

There was no change in clinic blood pressure before and after titration. In a cross-sectional analysis on 144 patients, those with the most diastolic hypotensive episodes had higher rates of HF readmissions (P = .01) and the composite end point of all-cause mortality and all-cause readmissions (P = .03).",

After 20+/-10 weeks' treatment with a beta(1)-blocker (Bisoprolol), the measurements were repeated. Measurements were also made on an age- and sex-matched group of healthy controls (HC). In each case data were recorded for 30 min. In HC, the difference in absolute spectral amplitude of LDF oscillations between the two vasodilators manifests in the frequency interval 0.005-0.0095 Hz (p<0.01); this difference is initially absent in patients with CHF, but appears following the beta(1)-blocker treatment (p<0.01). For HC, the difference between the two vasodilators also manifests in normalised spectral amplitude in 0.0095-0.021 Hz (p<0.05). This latter difference is absent in CHF patients and is unchanged by treatment with beta(1)-blockers. It is concluded that there are two oscillatory skin blood flow components associated with endothelial function. Both are reduced in CHF. Activity in the lower frequency interval is restored by beta(1)-blocker treatment, confirming the association between CHF and endothelial dysfunction but suggesting the involvement of two distinct mechanisms.", 
    "65": "We aimed to further define the pathway mediating the inhibitory effects of kappa-opioid receptor stimulation on Ca(2+) transients and hypertrophic responses to beta(1)-adrenoceptor stimulation. We determined the effects of trans-(+/-)-3,4-dichloro-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-cyclohexyl]-benzeneacetamid methanesulfonate salt (U50,488H), a selective kappa-opioid receptor agonist, on the enhancement of spontaneous Ca(2+) transients and the induction of hypertrophy by isoprenaline, a beta-adrenoceptor agonist, in cultured neonatal ventricular myocytes. The results were compared with those found with KN93, a selective Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase (CaMKII) inhibitor, propranolol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, and verapamil, a L-type Ca(2+) channel antagonist. Hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes was characterized by increases in (i) total protein content; (ii) cell size; and (iii) [(3)H]leucine incorporation. 10 micromol/l isoprenaline increased all three parameters. We also determined the expression of nuclear CaMKIIdelta in response to U50,488H in the presence or absence of isoprenaline. To determine whether the effects of U50,488H were receptor-mediated, its effects were also measured following blockade of the kappa-opioid receptor with nor-binaltorphimine. kappa-Opioid receptor stimulation suppressed the stimulatory effect of isoprenaline on Ca(2+) transients and cardiac hypertrophy, as did KN93, propranalol and verapamil. U50,488H also suppressed the expression of nuclear CaMKIIdelta(B) in the presence, but not in the absence of isoprenaline. These results suggest that the inhibitory effect of kappa-opioid receptor stimulation on beta(1)-adrenoceptor stimulation may also involve CaMKIIdelta.", 
    "66": "Chronic volume overload from chronic severe mitral regurgitation (MR) results in neuroendocrine activation similar to the heart failure syndrome despite normal left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF). Hence, the hypothesis that beta-blocker (BB) therapy may have a beneficial effect in these patients was tested using a large observational cohort. Our echocardiographic database was searched for patients with severe MR and normal LVEF. Full chart reviews were conducted for clinical and pharmacologic data. Survival was analyzed as a function of BB therapy. The search produced 895 patients aged 68 +/- 17 years, 44% men, with LVEF 66 +/- 7%. Of these, 32% were on BB therapy. Use of a BB was associated with a significantly decreased mortality hazard of 0.62 (95% confidence interval 0.46 to 0.83, p = 0.002), which was unchanged after adjusting for age, gender, LVEF, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and cardiac valve surgery. The independent beneficial effect of BBs was seen in patients with or without coronary artery disease, those with or without hypertension, and patients managed both medically and surgically. In conclusion, use of BB therapy was associated with a significant independent survival benefit in patients with chronic severe MR with normal LVEF. This benefit was seen in patients with or without coronary artery disease, as well as patients managed both medically and surgically. Use of BBs in patients with severe MR despite normal LVEF is suggested.",

Transdermal flux, permeability coefficient and enhancement factor were calculated for each penetration enhancer. Black cumin oil (5% v/v) was selected on the basis of its highest enhancement in permeation and was evaluated further for its mode of action using DSC, FTIR and histological studies. The results indicated that the oil shows its action by extraction of lipids from stratum corneum as well as by loosening the hydrogen bonds between ceramides subsequently leading to fluidization of the lipid bilayer.",

Maximum respiratory exchange ratio did not differ between the groups (1.2+/-0.5 for controls and 1.15+/-1 for heart failure patients; p=0.42). All controls reached the maximum heart rate for their age, while no patients in the heart failure group reached the maximum.

    "77": "This study is to explore the possible mechanisms of the antidepressant-like effect of agmatine. By using two traditional \"behavior despair\" model, tail suspension test and forced swimming test, we examined the effects of some monoamine receptor antagonists (including beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol, beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist/5-HT1A/1B receptor antagonist pindolol, alpha2-adrenergic receptor antagonists yohimbine and idazoxan and 5-HT3 receptor antagonist tropisetron) on the antidepressant-like action of agmatine in mice. Activity of adenylate cyclase (AC) in the synapse membrane from rat frontal cortex was determined by radioimmunoassay. Single dose of agmatine (5-40 mg x kg(-1), ig) dose-dependently decrease the immobility time in tail suspension test in mice, indicating an antidepressant-like effect. The effect of agmatine (40 mg x kg(-1), ig) was antagonized by co-administration of beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist/5-HT1A/1B receptor antagonist pindolol (20 mg x kg(-1), ip), alpha2-adrenergic receptor antagonists yohimbine (5-10 mg x kg(-1), ip) or idazoxan (4 mg x kg(-1), ip), but not beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol (5-20 mg x kg(-1), ip) and 5-HT3 receptor antagonist tropisetron (5-40 mg x kg(-1), ip). Agmatine (5-40 mg x kg(-1), ig) also dose-dependently decrease the immobility time in forced swimming test in mice. The effect of agmatine (40 mg x kg(-1), ig) was also antagonized by pindolol (20 mg x kg(-1), ip), yohimbine (5-10 mg x kg(-1), ip), or idazoxan (4 mg x kg(-1), ip). Incubation of agmatine (0.1-6.4 micromol x L(-1)) with the synaptic membrane extracted from rat frontal cortex activated the AC in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. While the effect of agmatine (6.4 micromol x L(-1)) was dose-dependently antagonized by pindolol (1 micromol x L(-1)) or yohimbine (0.25-1 micromol x L(-1)). Chronic treatment with agmatine (10 mg x kg(-1), ig, bid, 2 w) or fluoxetine (10 mg x kg(-1), ig, bid, 2 w) increased the basic activity, as well as the Gpp (NH)p (1-100 micromol x L(-1)) stimulated AC activity in rat prefrontal cortex. These results indicate that regulation on 5-HT1A/1B and alpha2 receptors, and activation AC in the frontal cortex is one of the important mechanisms involving in agmatine's antidepressant-like action.",

Multiple imaging was obtained because of concern for von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) after bilateral retinal angiomas were discovered on ophthalmologic consultation as a follow-up from the Emergency Department. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were able to localize the adrenal and extra-adrenal tumors; however, accurate differentiation between pheochromocytomas and other adrenal tumors was not possible. I-123 MIBG is the test of choice for evaluating functionality and location of pheochromocytomas because of its high sensitivity and specificity. I-123 MIBG was performed before surgery to confirm that the lesions were indeed pheochromocytomas and also to rule out metastatic disease. He was started on alpha- and beta-blocker medication for at least 3 weeks, followed by surgery. The postoperative period was uneventful. DNA testing was performed and revealed mutations in the VHL gene previously reported to be associated with von Hippel-Lindau syndrome type II and genetic counseling was recommended. He was presented in urology tumor board conference with recommendations for follow-up CT and laboratory tests after 3 months. Otherwise, the patient is doing well and asymptomatic at this time.",

The symptoms were not related to the bladder or bowel. The episodes did not seem to be linked to any mechanical cause. The patient was incidentally diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. Treatment with antithyroid medication resulted in resolution of the autonomic dysreflexia. This case suggests that hyperthyroidism may trigger autonomic dysreflexia in tetraplegic patients.", 
    "80": "Telmisartan is a unique angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and partial agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma. Here, we investigated the preventive effect of telmisartan on cognitive decline in Alzheimer disease. In ddY mice, intracerebroventricular injection of Abeta 1-40 significantly attenuated their cognitive function evaluated by shuttle avoidance test. Pretreatment with a non-hypotensive dose of telmisartan significantly inhibited such cognitive decline. Interestingly, co-treatment with GW9662, a PPAR-gamma antagonist, partially inhibited this improvement of cognitive decline. Another ARB, losartan, which has less PPAR-gamma agonistic effect, also inhibited Abeta-injection-induced cognitive decline; however the effect was smaller than that of telmisartan and was not affected by GW9662. Immunohistochemical staining for Abeta showed the reduced Abeta deposition in telmisartan-treated mice. However, this reduction was not observed in mice co-administered GW9662. These findings suggest that ARB has a preventive effect on cognitive impairment in Alzheimer disease, and telmisartan, with PPAR-gamma activation, could exert a stronger effect.", 
    "81": "Syncope is a very common presentation with a wide differential diagnosis and equally wide prognostic implications. Recent work has highlighted the importance of an accurate history and physical examination as the basis of diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Several centers have evaluated the role of structured histories and comprehensive syncope evaluation guidelines and units in managing syncope. Although these do provide comprehensive care, whether they improve overall outcome and reduce costs is far from clear. This is partly because there are few effective treatments for the major cause of fainting, vasovagal syncope. Recent randomized trials have highlighted the roles of physical counterpressure maneuvers and midodrine and the limitations of treatment with beta blockers and permanent cardiac pacing.", 
    "82": "There is an increasing awareness that an elevated resting heart rate is associated with increased all-cause mortality in the general population and that this may be an independent coronary risk factor This review was undertaken to determine whether heart rate is predictive of increased mortality and major morbidity in noncardiac surgical patients and whether heart rate manipulation improves perioperative outcome. A search of Medline from 1966 until October 2007 was conducted using the terms \"heart rate\", \"surgery\", \"cardiac\", \"morbidity\", \"mortality\" and \"perioperative\". The main findings were that an elevated perioperative heart rate, an absolute increase in heart rate and heart rate lability are independent predictors of both short- and long-term adverse outcomes in patients at cardiovascular risk undergoing major noncardiac surgery. Although prospective nonrandomised and retrospective data suggest heart rate control improves perioperative outcome, there is conflicting evidence from randomised trials that perioperative heart rate control improves outcome. This may be because drug-associated bradycardia influences mortality in the perioperative period. Further studies reporting the absolute heart rate, the absolute change of heart rate and the time period of the observations are needed to identify 'early warning systems', which may allow earlier triage and improved outcome. Enthusiasm for this approach must be tempered by the appreciation that a J-shaped relationship probably exists between heart rate and morbidity, particularly following bradycardic therapy. Therefore, any bradycardic manipulation of heart rate in the perioperative period must be accompanied by simultaneous attention to other physiological variables associated with increased morbidity and mortality.",

The purposes were to describe concentration-response relationship and receptor mechanism of the effect of norepinephrine on muscle function of pyeloureter and to reveal possible side effects on cardiovascular and renal functions. Renal pelvis was perfused, while pelvic pressure, cardiovascular and renal functional parameters were recorded. In group A, a pelvic pressure increase was examined during pressure flow studies with norepinephrine solutions (0, 1, 5, 50 and 100 microg/ml). In group B, pelvis was perfused with 6 ml/min. norepinephrine solutions (0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1 and 1 microg/ml). In group C, pelvis was perfused with 6 ml/min. norepinephrine, norepinephrine + sotalol 10(-) (6) mol/l and norepinephrine + phentolamine 10(-) (6) mol/l. Norepinephrine solutions of 0, 10(-) (8), 10(-) (7), 10(-) (6), 10(-) (5) and 10(-) (4) mol/l were used. In group A, all norepinephrine solutions lowered the pelvic pressure increase significantly. Large increases in plasma and urine norepinephrine occurred with 50 and 100 microg/ml, but cardiovascular and renal functions remained unchanged. In group B, a significant diminishing pelvic pressure increase with all solutions was seen with a significant difference between all solutions. In group C, norepinephrine demonstrated a concentration-response curve with EC(50) between 10(-) (8) and 10(-) (7) mol/l (10(-) (7.27+/-0.40)). Sotalol had a smooth muscle inhibitory effect on the pyeloureter and inhibited the effect of norepinephrine increasing EC(50) by about a factor 10 (10(-) (6.40+/-1.17)). No convincing effect of phentolamine was observed.

Epidermis obtained after 12 hr treatment of viable rat skin with a glycyrrhizin-chitosan mixture showed significantly higher (p < 0.05) permeability to carvedilol as compared to that after treatment with glycyrrhizin or chitosan alone. Further, the application of patches containing glycyrrhizin-chitosan mixture resulted in sustained release of carvedilol, which was able to control the hypertension in deoxycorticosterone acetate induced hypertensive rats through 28 hr. Estimation of microconstituents in rat epidermis revealed maximum extraction of cholesterol, sphingosine, and triglycerides after treatment with glycyrrhizin-chitosan mixture. This was manifested in altered lipid and protein-specific thermotropic transitions. Further, increase in intercellular space, disordered lipid structure and corneocyte detachment as observed in SEM and TEM suggests great potential of glycyrrhizin for use as a percutaneous permeation enhancer.",

Tracheas from sensitized animals displayed reduced relaxation as compared with controls. In tracheas precontracted with histamine, a concentration response curve to 5-HT (32, 100 and 320 microM) induced relaxation and this effect was abolished by charybdotoxin, iberiotoxin or ketanserin.

When full information (mean, SEM) about these distributions is given, performing meta-analysis is straightforward.

Currently, the most common approaches are either ignoring such trials or for each trial with a missing SEM, finding a similar trial and taking its SEM value as the missing SEM. Both approaches have drawbacks. As an alternative, this paper develops and tests two new methods, the first being the prognostic method and the second being the interval method, to estimate any missing SEMs from a set of sampling distributions with full information. A merging method is also proposed to handle clinical trials with partial information to simulate meta-analysis.",

For example, the meta-analysis result of Latanoprost versus Timolol on IOP reduction for six months provided in 1 was 5.05 +/- 1.15 (Mean +/- SEM) with full information. If the last trial in this study is assumed to be with partial information, the traditional analysis method for dealing with incomplete information that ignores this trial would give 6.49 +/- 1.36 while our prognostic method gives 5.02 +/- 1.15, and our interval method provides two intervals as Mean in [4.25, 5.63] and SEM in [1.01, 1.24].",

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether metoprolol increases beta(3)-adrenoceptor expression and downstream Akt-mediated signaling. Left ventricular function was measured in paced isolated working hearts. beta(1), beta(2) and beta(3) adrenoceptor-expression levels were measured using Western blotting. Protein kinase A (PKA) and calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CAMK-II) activities, as well as Akt phosphorylation, were measured as indices of downstream target activation. Chronic metoprolol treatment improved cardiac function and produced a marked increase in the expression of all three beta-adrenoceptor subtypes which was associated with a decrease in PKA activity and an increase in Akt phosphorylation. Akt-mediated phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) was not altered, but phosphorylation of the transcription factor FOXO-3 was increased. Metoprolol increased the expression of beta(1), beta(2) and beta(3) adrenoceptors, associated with repression of FOXO-3 expression. beta-adrenoceptor signaling shifted from PKA to Akt-mediated signaling, associated with phosphorylation of FOXO-3 but not eNOS.",

The animals were divided into eight experimental groups. Mirtazapine (5 and 10 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally for 14 days. Twenty-four hours after the last administration of the drug, the rats received a single intraperitoneal dose of hypotensive drugs (propranolol 5 mg/kg or enalapril 10 mg/kg) or 1% solution of methylcellulose. Mirtazapine administered chronically did not affect the hypotensive effect of a single dose of propranolol or enalapril in spontaneously hypertensive rats.

In the present study, we employed an atrial pacing method to clarify a net effect of a drug on the QT interval in this model. The atrial pacing catheter was inserted via the jugular vein with a minimal surgical invasion, and the effects of d-sotalol (0.3 and 3 mg/kg, intravenously) and verapamil (0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg, intravenously) on electrocardiogram parameters were assessed under the sinus rhythm and during the atrial pacing of 200 and 240 beats/min. d-Sotalol significantly prolonged the QT interval in a reverse use-dependent manner and decreased the heart rate, while verapamil prolonged the PR interval without affecting the heart rate or QT interval, indicating the sensitivity and specificity of this model in assessing the pharmacodynamics of the drug-induced QT-interval prolongation. Using the QT/RR relationship under the sinus rhythm, we obtained the following two types of QT-interval correcting formulae; namely, QTc = QT - 0.207(RR - 300) by a linear regression method; and QTc = QT/(RR/300)0.332 by a non-linear regression method, the latter of which is equal to 0.67 times of Fridericia's formula, providing rationale for the use of mathematical correction in this model. Thus, the halothane-anaesthetized, closed-chest, guinea-pig model may be highly useful for assessing the drug-induced QT-interval prolongation, which may become an alternative to current models for the in vivo QT assay.", 
    "134": "Hemitoxin (HTX) is a new K+ channel blocker isolated from the venom of the Iranian scorpion Hemiscorpius lepturus. It represents only 0.1% of the venom proteins, and displaces [125 I]alpha-dendrotoxin from its site on rat brain synaptosomes with an IC50 value of 16 nm. The amino acid sequence of HTX shows that it is a 35-mer basic peptide with eight cysteine residues, sharing 29-69% sequence identity with other K+ channel toxins, especially with those of the alphaKTX6 family. A homology-based molecular model generated for HTX shows the characteristic alpha/beta-scaffold of scorpion toxins. The pairing of its disulfide bridges, deduced from MS of trypsin-digested peptide, is similar to that of classical four disulfide bridged scorpion toxins (Cys1-Cys5, Cys2-Cys6, Cys3-Cys7 and Cys4-Cys8). Although it shows the highest sequence similarity with maurotoxin, HTX displays different affinities for Kv1 channel subtypes. It blocks rat Kv1.1, Kv1.2 and Kv1.3 channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes with IC50 values of 13, 16 and 2 nM, respectively. As previous studies have shown the critical role played by the beta-sheet in Kv1.3 blockers, we suggest that Arg231 is also important for Kv1.3 versus Kv1.2 HTX positive discrimination.

In all patients at baseline, before carvedilol, and then at 3 and 12 months after initiation of treatment, the following parameters were assessed: HR(s), serum BNP, echocardiographic parameters, and exercise capacity with gas monitoring during cardiopulmonary stress test. Before carvedilol there was a positive correlation between BNP and E/A (r = 0.17; p = 0.05). BNP was significantly higher in patients with restrictive MFP (rMFP) as compared with nonrestrictive MFP (nrMFP) (541.5 +/- 206.7 vs. 412.6 +/- 207.2; p = 0.009), and lower VO(2peak) in rMFP as compared with nrMFP (12.5 +/- 3.7 vs. 16.5 +/- 4.7; p = 0.001). After initiation of carvedilol, the patients with rMFP had reduced E/A (2.9 vs. 1.4; p = 0.003), and rMFP was changed to nrMFP in 60.8% of patients. Respective BNP concentrations were 342.16 +/- 284.31 vs. 326.40 +/- 264.6; NS. In patients with rMFP VO(2peak) , %N increased significantly from 42.4 +/- 10.2 to 52.4 +/- 14.4; p = 0.012.",

Comparison of the major cardiac functional parameters and transplant-free survival patterns between carrier and noncarrier patients did not reveal any significant differences. Furthermore, echocardiographic evaluation showed similar outcomes of beta-blocker treatment between G147D carriers and noncarriers.",

    "142": "Association techniques could be the answer for evaluating electromechanical coupling and gastric emptying under basal conditions and after administration of drugs. Electrogastrography (EGG) and alternating current biosusceptometry (ACB) emerged due to their interesting nature, noninvasiveness and low cost. The aims were to examine in dogs the effect of erythromycin on gastric emptying by ACB and electrical and motor responses to erythromycin and propranolol by ACB and EGG respectively. Twelve beagle dogs ingested a solid test meal on separate days. Under anesthesia, gastric motility was evaluated by EGG and ACB after erythromycin and propranolol administration. Without anesthesia, gastric emptying was assessed under basal conditions and after erythromycin by ACB. ACB and EGG showed a strong temporal correlation. Erythromycin and propranolol presented the same profile with different power ratios; the amplitude increased whereas frequency decreased. Also, erythromycin administration hastened gastric emptying while reducing the orocaecal transit time. There is a demand for reliable, easy-to-perform and comfortable techniques to record gastric emptying and gastric activity in medicine and veterinary practice. In summary, the association of ACB with EGG accompanied by an appropriate animal model is promising for evaluating effects of drugs in gastric myoelectrical and contractile activity.",

There were 4201 patients (12.4%) discharged alive with CRT, including 811 new implants. Patients discharged with CRT were older (median age, 75 versus 72 years) and had lower median left ventricular ejection fraction (30% versus 38%), more frequent ischemic cardiomyopathy (58% versus 45%), more history of atrial fibrillation (38% versus 27%), and higher rates of beta-blocker and aldosterone antagonist use (P<0.0001 for all) than those without CRT. We found that 4.8% of patients with left ventricular ejection fraction <or=35% were discharged with a new CRT implant, which varied greatly by hospital. Ten percent of patients discharged with a new CRT implant had a left ventricular ejection fraction >35%. Major factors associated with lower rates of new CRT placement were treatment in the northeast (odds ratio, 0.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.30 to 0.53), black race (odds ratio, 0.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.36 to 0.57), increasing left ventricular ejection fraction per 10% (odds ratio, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.60), and increasing age per 10 years in those >70 years of age (odds ratio, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.48 to 0.65).",

The majority (78%) of the hepatically cleared drugs were found to be subject to oxidative metabolism via cytochromes P450 of the families 1, 2 and 3, with major contributions from CYP3A4/5 (37% of drugs) followed by CYP2C9 (17%), CYP2D6 (15%), CYP2C19 (10%), CYP1A2 (9%), CYP2C8 (6%), and CYP2B6 (4%). Clinically well-established polymorphic CYPs (i.e., CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6) were involved in the metabolism of approximately half of those drugs, including (in particular) NSAIDs metabolized mainly by CYP2C9, proton-pump inhibitors metabolized by CYP2C19, and beta blockers and several antipsychotics and antidepressants metabolized by CYP2D6.

Choudhry et al. used a computer model to simulate the effectiveness and cost of improving medication adherence by eliminating out-of-pocket costs for the four-drug regimen in a hypothetical cohort of 65-year-old Medicare beneficiaries with MI. Based on the model's main assumptions, eliminating cost sharing for the regimen would be cost saving from a societal perspective, but would cost Medicare $7,182 per quality-adjusted life year. The results of the Choudhry et al. analysis suggest that improving adherence to a secondary prevention strategy by eliminating out-of-pocket costs for standard post-MI medications would be a cost-effective Medicare policy.",

We excluded any structural heart defect through echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging studies in all the children. A negative tridimensional electroanatomic mapping was performed on five of them. Holter analysis of ventricular rate variability was performed in the frequency domain. Two main components were distinguished in a spectrum calculated on the basis of 24 h-long recordings. We studied low frequency and high frequency components. We compared the values obtained with those of a control group of 10 healthy children, admitted to our cardiology division, day-care system.

A combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor with an angiotensin receptor blocker or other classes of medications shown to decrease protein excretion, such as nondihydropyridine calcium antagonists or aldosterone receptor blockers, should be considered to decrease albuminuria further; beta-blockers with alpha-blocking properties such as carvedilol have also been shown to reduce microalbuminuria probably secondary to its antioxidant properties.",

Melatonin also exerts powerful anti-adrenergic actions based on its effects on contractility of isolated papillary muscles. The aims of this study were to determine whether melatonin also has anti-adrenergic effects on the isolated perfused rat heart, to determine the mechanism thereof and to establish whether these actions contribute to protection of the heart during ischaemia/reperfusion. The results showed that melatonin (50 microM) caused a significant reduction in both isoproterenol (10(-7) M) and forskolin (10(-6) M) induced cAMP production and that both these responses were melatonin receptor dependent, since the blocker, luzindole (5 x 10(-6) M) abolished this effect. Nitric oxide (NO), as well as guanylyl cyclase are involved, as L-NAME (50 microM), an NO synthase inhibitor and ODQ (20 microM), a guanylyl cyclase inhibitor, significantly counteracted the effects of melatonin. Protein kinase C (PKC), as indicated by the use of the inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide (50 microM), also play a role in melatonin's anti-adrenergic actions. These actions of melatonin are involved in its cardioprotection: simultaneous administration of L-NAME or ODQ with melatonin, before and after 35 min regional ischaemia, completely abolished its cardioprotection. PKC, on the other hand, had no effect on the melatonin-induced reduction in infarct size. Cardioprotection by melatonin was associated with a significant activation of PKB/Akt and attenuated activation of the pro-apoptotic kinase, p38MAPK during early reperfusion. In summary, the results show that melatonin-induced cardioprotection may be receptor dependent, and that its anti-adrenergic actions, mediated by NOS and guanylyl cyclase activation, are important contributors."
