    "0": "The effect of Ritodrine (4-hydroxy alpha-1-2-4-hydroxyphenyl ethylamino acetylbenzyl alcohol hydrochloride) on fallopian tubal activity was studied in 26 women of reproductive age who underwent abdominal surgery for tuboplasty (8 women), tubal ligation (6 women), or ovarian or uterine pathology (12 women). Tubal mobility was recorded by the intratubal microballoon method. Ritodrine was given intravenously at infusion rates of 50-600 mcg/minute or orally. At infusion rates of 200-300 mcg/minute, Ritodrine suppressed the spontaneous outbursts of increased activity, but tubal quiescence was achieved only at infusion rates of 400 mcg/minute or higher. Oral administration of 5-10 mg of Ritodrine was insufficient to depress motility, however 15-20 mg achieved quiescence lasting longer than 1 hour. It was suggested that it is conceivable that the administration of a beta-adrenergic activator such as Ritodrine at appropriate times of the menstrual cycle would interfere with conception through inhibition of the ovum retention mechanism in the tube.", 
    "1": "Beta-blocking drugs that prevent cranial vasodilatation are potentially valuable in the prophylaxis of migraine. Forty-nine patients with either classic or common migraine were treated with propranolol 160 mg/day for an average of six months. The first 30 of the patients to respond well to this treatment then participated in a double-blind cross-over trial with a placebo and propranolol. The mean frequency of headache attacks was significantly reduced by propranolol. None of the patients expressed a preference for placebo. Propranolol seems to be an effective prophylactic for common and classic migraine but the antimigraine properties of the various beta-blocking agents probably differ.", 
    "2": "1 The effects of some adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists which have been reported to affect histamine formation in leucocytes (Assem & Feigenbaum, 1972) have been investigated on gastric secretion in conscious dogs with Heidenhain pouches.2 Submaximal secretion in response to pentagastrin was enhanced by propranolol (0.1-1.0 mg/kg i.v.) and phenylephrine (1.0 mug kg(-1) min(-1) i.v. for 20 min), which increase histamine formation, and was decreased by phentolamine (2 mg/kg i.v.) and isoprenaline (0.05-0.2 mug kg(-1) min(-1) i.v. for 30 min), which decrease histamine formation. Practolol (2 mg/kg i.v.), which has no effect on histamine formation, had no effect on secretion.3 Acid secretion in response to histamine was either unaffected or affected in the opposite direction by these drugs.4 The effects of the drugs on pentagastrin-induced secretion were not secondary to changes in mucosal blood flow (radioactive aniline clearance).5 The results are consistent with the hypothesis that acid secretion in response to pentagastrin involves the formation of endogenous histamine.", 
    "3": "1 Effects of graded doses of propranolol have been studied on gastric secretion and gastric ulcers in pylorus-ligated rats.2 A dose-dependent action of propranolol was observed; small doses increased total volume, acid output and pepsin secretion along with an increase in the incidence of ulcers but high doses were inhibitory.", 
    "4": "1. Isoprenaline hydrochloride injected subcutaneously or infused intravenously caused drinking and simultaneous antidiuresis in the dog. The minimal effective dose was between 20 and 50 mug per dog.2. Isoprenaline-induced drinking was prevented by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol and enhanced by the alpha-antagonist phentolamine.3. Ganglionic blockade with pentolinium or with hexamethonium did not interfere with the response.4. A delay of 1 hr after injection of 100 mug isoprenaline, before drinking was permitted, did not significantly reduce the amount of water subsequently drunk. A preload of water approximately equal to the volume of water normally drunk caused a greater reduction in water intake in some dogs.5. Isoprenaline caused an increase in heart rate and pulse pressure which lasted for between 1 and 3 hr according to dose. Central venous pressure fell, but mean arterial pressure was little altered. Haemodynamic changes preceded drinking by about 5 min.6. Infusion of isoprenaline caused drinking in the bilaterally nephrectomized dog.7. We conclude that isoprenaline is a potent stimulus to drinking in the dog and that the effect is not exclusively mediated by the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "5": "1. Single unit recordings from type B atrial receptors were obtained from slips of the left cervical vagus nerve during acute increases and decreases in atrial pressure produced by infusion of isotonic saline and withdrawal of blood.2. Atrial receptor discharge reached a peak frequency at the peak of the ;v' wave of the atrial pulse, a time when the rate of change of atrial pressure was zero.3. The receptor discharge exhibited hysteresis when increases in atrial pressure were compared to decreases in atrial pressure during circulatory volume expansion and haemorrhage, respectively. This hysteresis was not due to a change in atrial compliance.4. The hysteresis was still observed when the pulse pressure of the ;v' wave was plotted against receptor discharge.5. Type B atrial receptors did not show adaptation after 15 min of a sustained increase in left atrial pressure.6. Acute depression of atrial contractility with propranolol increased resting fibre discharge as a result of the associated increase in atrial pressure.", 
    "6": "1 At higher temperatures, near the physiological range for mammals and nonhibernating frogs, the adrenoceptors for both inotropic responses to adrenaline and noradrenaline and for cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) production in rat and frog isolated heart preparations, had typical beta characteristics. Phenoxybenzamine potentiated the inotropic response and the accumulation of cyclic AMP; conversely, propranolol inhibited the two responses.2 When the ambient temperature was reduced, the adrenoceptors mediating cyclic AMP production changed very little; they were blocked as effectively as at the higher temperature by propranolol and were not blocked by phenoxybenzamine. However, the adrenoceptors mediating the inotropic response were markedly changed by the decrease in temperature; phenoxybenzamine now inhibited this response and the inhibitory activity of propranolol was reduced about tenfold.3 These results indicate that the adrenoceptors that mediate cardiac inotropic responses at physiological temperatures are distinct from those that mediate the production of cyclic AMP, and that the activation of adenylate cyclase and the accumulation of cyclic AMP are probably not intermediate steps in cardiac inotropic responses to catecholamines.", 
    "7": "1. Intracellular recordings of membrane potential were made from superficial cells of isolated mouse liver segments superfused with physiological salt solutions.2. The mean resting cell membrane potential was -39.4 mV.3. Glucagon caused a dose-dependent membrane hyperpolarization which was detectable at 10(-9)M and maximal (7 mV) at 10(-7)M. The hyperpolarization started within half a minute after exposure to glucagon. Secretion (2 x 10(-7)M) had no effect on the membrane potential.4. Adrenaline (10(-6)M) and isoprenaline (10(-6)M) also caused membrane hyperpolarization (4-6 mV). The effect of isoprenaline, but not that of adrenaline, was blocked by propranolol (5 x 10(-6)M).5. Dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (10(-3)M) caused a membrane hyperpolarization of 4-8 mV.6. In the absence of extracellular K or the presence of Strophanthin-G (10(-3)M) the resting potential was decreased and the response to glucagon reduced. During exposure to a solution containing 20 mM-K the resting potential was slightly enhanced and the amplitude of the glucagon-induced hyperpolarization reduced compared with control conditions.7. It is concluded that the effect of glucagon on the membrane potential is due to an interaction with specific membrane receptors probably leading to activation of the membrane-bound adenyl cyclase. It is probable that the hyperpolarization is mediated by cyclic AMP. The hyperpolarization induced by glucagon is dependent on a normal function of the membrane Na-K pump.", 
    "8": "Adenylate cyclase (EC 4.6.1.1) activity was stimulated by low concentrations of dopamine and apomorphine, but not by low concentrations of norepinephrine in homogenates of malignant mouse neuroblastoma cells. In cyclic AMP-induced \"differentiated\" cells, dopamine concentration required for a maximal increase in adenylate cyclase activity was about 10-fold less than that required for a similar increase in control cells, and norepinephrine-sensitive adenylate cyclase activity became apparent at low norepinephrine concentrations. The pharmacological properties of dopamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase were different from those of norepinephrine-sensitive enzyme. For example, dopamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was markedly reduced by low concentrations of haloperidol and phentolamine, whereas norepinephrine-stimulated enzyme activity required higher concentrations of these blocking agents for a similar amount of inhibition. Norepinephrine-stimulated enzyme activity was markedly blocked by low concentrations of propranolol, whereas dopamine-stimulated enzyme activity required a much higher concentration of this blocking agent for a similar amount of inhibition. Low concentrations of isoproterenol increased adenylate cyclase activity in malignant cells, but in \"differentiated\" cells even a high concentration failed to do so. The fact that dopamine and norepinephrine produced an additive stimulatory effect on adenylate cyclase activity suggests that they interact at different receptor sites. This suggestion is further supported by the observation that the combination of prostaglandin E(1) and norepinephrine produced an additive stimulatory effect of enzyme activity. The observation that the effects of dopamine and prostaglandin E(1) are not additive, coupled with the observation that a low concentration of phentolamine blocked the effect of prostaglandin E(1), suggests that these two agents may interact at a common site.", 
    "9": "1 Low doses of tiprenolol (0.01-0.02 mg/kg) and propranolol (0.05 mg/kg) abolished the ventricular arrhythmias produced by the intravenous injection of adrenaline in anaesthetized dogs respired with halothane.2 Larger doses of tiprenolol (2.0-4.0 mg/kg) restored sinus rhythm in four of five dogs with ventricular tachycardia produced by toxic doses of ouabain. Propranolol (2.0-4.0 mg/kg) had the same effect in each of four dogs.3 Both tiprenolol (4.0-8.0 mg/kg) and propranolol (4.0 mg/kg) increased the frequency of sinus beats and reduced the ventricular rate in dogs with ventricular tachycardia 20-44 h after ligation of a coronary artery.4 Practolol (0.5-16.0 mg/kg) did not reduce the ventricular rate or increase the frequency of sinus beats in dogs with ventricular tachycardia after ligation of a coronary artery.5 In dogs with ouabain-induced ventricular tachycardia mean arterial pressure was reduced after the administration of tiprenolol (0.5-8.0 mg/kg) or propranolol (4.0-8.0 mg/kg). Depression of sinus and atrioventricular nodal function, and of intraventricular conduction developed in some of the dogs given tiprenolol (4-8 mg/kg) or propranolol (8.0 mg/kg).6 The administration of tiprenolol (1.0-8.0 mg/kg) or propranolol (4.0-8.0 mg/kg) depressed the arterial pressure and caused the deaths of some dogs in which a coronary artery had been ligated. Such deaths did not occur in the group which had been given toxic doses of ouabain.", 
    "10": "1 The actions of 4-(2-hydroxy-3-isopropylaminopropoxy) phenyl acetamide (ICI 66082), a new beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug, on the twitch response of the isolated papillary muscle of the rabbit and on dP/dt max and free heart rate of a denervated dog heart preparation, are described.2 ICI 66082 (up to 1 mg/ml) did not produce any depression of the twitch response of the rabbit papillary muscle. ICI 66082 antagonized the action of isoprenaline on this preparation at a concentration of 0.01 mug/ml.3 ICI 66082 (0.5-1.0 mg/kg intravenously) reduced the control value of dP/dt max in four dog preparations by a mean value of 529 mmHg/s (s.e. mean +/- 139 mm Hg/s), with no significant change in free heart rate. Antagonism of the effect of isoprenaline on dP/dt max and on free heart rate was demonstrated with ICI 66082 (0.1 mg/kg).4 ICI 66082 (1.0-1.5 mg/kg) produced no significant changes in dP/dt max or in free heart rate in four dogs pretreated with reserpine. A significant reduction (16% of the control value) in dP/dt max was observed with ICI 66082 at a high dose of 40-50 mg/kg.5 It is concluded that ICI 66082 is a competitive antagonist against the actions of isoprenaline on cardiac muscle, has no negative inotropic action (unless the dose exceeds 40 mg/kg) and lacks intrinsic sympathomimetic activity.", 
    "11": "1 A dog's hind limb was vascularly isolated by strong nylon snares and its sympathetic nerve supply interrupted. Blood was perfused at constant flow into the femoral artery and drained from the femoral vein. In some dogs the cardiac nerves were cut.2 Isoprenaline infused intravenously caused an increase in heart rate and a decrease in arterial resistance.3 Practolol (2 mg/kg) effectively blocked heart rate responses to isoprenaline infused at up to 10 mug/min but was relatively ineffective in blocking arterial responses. ICI 66082 (2 mg/kg) reduced vasomotor responses and propranolol (0.5 mg/kg) abolished vasomotor responses.4 Small cumulative doses of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists were given to some dogs. Practolol blocked heart rate responses in lower doses than were required to block vasomotor responses. Propranolol preferentially blocked vasomotor responses and ICI 66082 was intermediate between the other two in its effects.", 
    "12": "1. After previous extirpation of the superior cervical ganglion saliva was found to flow from the cannulated submaxillary duct of rats under chloralose anaesthesia. The secretion started 13-14.5 hr after sympathectomy, increased gradually in rate and then slowed down and ceased, lasting for about 12 hr.2. Injection of alpha- or beta-adrenoreceptor blocking drugs reduced the flow and a combination of both types of drugs abolished it. It is concluded that the secretion was caused by noradrenaline released from the degenerating nerves, and that the phenomenon is an example of the degeneration activity described in other preparations as an effect of section of post-ganglionic autonomic nerves.3. A similar, but less pronounced, secretion was found in the parotid gland of the rat.", 
    "13": "To decide whether adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic AMP) plays a role as a second messenger in the trans-synaptic induction of tyrosine 3-monooxygenase (EC 1.14.16.2), it is desirable to discriminate between neuronal and extraneuronal changes in cyclic AMP concentration. Treatment of newborn rats with nerve growth factor antiserum or 6-hydroxydopamine, leading to destruction of 61-85% of the adrenergic nerve cell bodies in the superior cervical ganglion, led to a decrease in cyclic AMP of only 16-28%. This observation demonstrates that a relatively small portion of cyclic AMP is localized in the adrenergic neurons. However, administration of isoproterenol produced an increase (12-fold) in cyclic AMP only in this neuronal pool. Neither single nor repeated injections of isoproterenol led to induction of tyrosine monoxygenase. This, together with previous observations that experimental conditions leading to induction of the enzyme do not produce significant increases of cyclic AMP in the whole ganglion, is taken as an indication that cyclic AMP is not acting as a second messenger in the trans-synaptic induction of tyrosine monooxygenase in the rat superior cervical ganglion. In the rat adrenal medulla, treatment with reserpine led to both a shortlasting (60-90 min) increase in cyclic AMP and a subsequent induction of tyrosine monooxygenase. However, the increase in cyclic AMP was almost completely prevented (40 compared to 320%) by pretreatment of the rats with propranolol while the induction of tyrosine monooxygenase was not diminished. This observation also argues against an exclusive key-function of cyclic AMP in trans-synaptic induction of tyrosine monooxygenase in the adrenal medulla."
