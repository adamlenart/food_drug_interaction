These recommendations were challenged recently by results of the Perioperative Ischemic Evaluation (POISE), a large randomized trial of extended-release metoprolol succinate started immediately before noncardiac surgery in patients at high risk for atherosclerotic disease. While metoprolol significantly reduced myocardial infarctions relative to placebo in POISE, it also was associated with significant excesses of both stroke and mortality. The merits and limitations of POISE and its applicability in light of other trials of perioperative beta-blockade are debated here by two experts in the field-Dr. Don Poldermans and Dr. P. J. Devereaux (co-principal investigator of POISE).", 
    "1": "Recent studies suggest an important role for neurotransmitters as modulators of inflammation. Neuroinflammatory mediators such as cytokines and molecules of the arachidonic acid pathway are generated and released by microglia. The monoamine norepinephrine reduces the production of cytokines by activated microglia in vitro. However, little is known about the effects of norepinephrine on prostanoid synthesis. In the present study, we investigate the role of norepinephrine on cyclooxygenase- (COX-)2 expression/synthesis and prostaglandin (PG)E2 production in rat primary microglia.", 
    "2": "Interestingly, norepinephrine increased COX-2 mRNA, but not protein expression. Norepinephrine strongly enhanced COX-2 expression and PGE2 production induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This effect is likely to be mediated by beta-adrenoreceptors, since beta-, but not alpha-adrenoreceptor agonists produced similar results. Furthermore, beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists blocked the enhancement of COX-2 levels induced by norepinephrine and beta-adrenoreceptor agonists.", 
    "3": "Considering that PGE2 displays different roles in neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders, norepinephrine may play an important function in the modulation of these processes in pathophysiological conditions.",

    "5": "Acute coronary syndrome patients with nonobstructive CAD are less likely to receive effective cardiac medications upon discharge from the hospital.", 
    "6": "We identified patients hospitalized with ACS that underwent coronary angiography and had a 6-month follow-up. Patients were grouped by CAD severity: nonobstructive CAD (<50% blockage in all vessels) or obstructive CAD (> or =50% blockage in > or = 1 vessels). Data were collected on demographics, medications at discharge, and adverse outcomes at 6 months, for all patients.", 
    "7": "Of the 2264 ACS patients included in the study: 123 patients had nonobstructive CAD and 2141 had obstructive CAD. Cardiac risk factors including hypertension and diabetes were common among patients with nonobstructive CAD. Men and women with nonobstructive CAD were less likely to receive cardiac medications compared to patients with obstructive CAD including aspirin (87.8% vs 95.0%, P = 0.001), beta-blockers (74.0% vs 89.2%, P < 0.001), or statins (69.1% vs 81.2%, P = 0.001). No gender-related differences in discharge medications were observed for patients with nonobstructive CAD. However, women with nonobstructive CAD had similar rates of cardiac-related rehospitalization as men with obstructive CAD (23.3% and 25.9%, respectively).", 
    "8": "Patients with nonobstructive CAD are less likely to receive evidence-based medications compared to patients with obstructive CAD, despite the presence of CAD risk factors and occurrence of an ACS event. Further research is warranted to determine if receipt of effective cardiac medications among patients with nonobstructive CAD would reduce cardiac-related events.", 
    "9": "Early reperfusion in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is imperative. Acute reperfusion may be achieved with fibrinolytic agents and/or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI); however, PCI is associated with lower rates of death and myocardial infarction compared with fibrinolysis. As treatment delays are associated with worse outcomes, current guidelines recommend minimizing time from symptom onset to treatment initiation. Regardless of the reperfusion strategy, patients with STEMI are at increased risk of early recurrent ischemic events and death. These risks can be significantly reduced by promptly initiating a combination of pharmacotherapies that includes antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents, beta-blockers, and inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. This manuscript reviews the evidence supporting the most recent guidelines for STEMI management published jointly by the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association. More recent evidence and its potential impact on future evidence-based guidelines are also addressed.", 
    "10": "The purpose of the present work was to provide theoretical and experimental support in generating an optimal pH (pH(max)) for a representative weak base compound (propranolol), that can lead to enhanced sublingual absorption. Initially equations for pH-solubility and pH-permeability profiles were derived and compared to the profiles obtained experimentally. Excellent correlation (R(2)=0.999) of solubility profiles was obtained using non-linear regression, and the permeability profiles further predicted that at certain pH (pH(max)), optimal mucosal permeation could be achieved. Subsequently, in a pharmacokinetics study, a buffered sublingual propranolol tablet, designed to achieve its pH(max) (when dissolved in saliva), were compared to that from a marketed product (Inderal) which could not achieve pH(max)) in 8 healthy subjects. Each subject received the products sublingually for 15 min followed by swallowing the remaining drug-saliva. The plasma propranolol concentrations of AUC during first 30 min from the buffered tablet were significantly higher than that from the Inderal tablet (p<0.05), and no significant differences in the remaining AUC were observed. These in vitro and in vivo results on propranolol provided experimental confirmation of the pH(max) concept as well as its utility in sublingual drug delivery. Such an approach may be applicable to other similar compounds to improve sublingual drug delivery.", 
    "11": "Environmental factors play an important role in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) development and stress may accelerate the progression of AD. Beta-adrenergic receptors are activated by stress and may influence different aspects of cognitive function. So, it was hypothesized that stress may accelerate the pathological progression of AD by the activation of beta(2)-adrenergic receptor (beta(2)-AR). We have investigated the role of acute stress and activation of beta(2)-AR in amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides production in a mouse model of acute restraint stress. Injections of the beta(2)-AR-selective agonist clenbuterol hydrochloride enhanced the production of acute stress-induced Abeta peptides production; the beta(2)-AR-selective antagonist ICI 118,551 reduced Abeta peptides production. It is suggested that acute stress induces abnormal activation of beta(2)-AR which subsequently enhances Abeta peptides (the main neuropathological hallmarks of AD) production possibly resulting in the onset of AD. The findings indicate that new therapeutic strategies designed to blocking beta(2)-AR might be valuable for the prevention and treatment of AD.", 
    "12": "To examine the molecular details of ligand activation of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), emphasis has been placed on structure determination of these receptors with stabilizing ligands. Here we present the methodology for receptor dynamics characterization of the GPCR human beta(2) adrenergic receptor bound to the inverse agonist carazolol using the technique of amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange coupled with mass spectrometry (HDX MS). The HDX MS profile of receptor bound to carazolol is consistent with thermal parameter observations in the crystal structure and provides additional information in highly dynamic regions of the receptor and chemical modifications demonstrating the highly complementary nature of the techniques. After optimization of HDX experimental conditions for this membrane protein, better than 89% sequence coverage was obtained for the receptor. The methodology presented paves the way for future analysis of beta(2)AR bound to pharmacologically distinct ligands as well as analysis of other GPCR family members.", 
    "13": "Classic antimalarial drugs, particularly quinine and its derivatives, are well known for their potential pro-arrhythmic effects. Recently developed synthetic antimalarials are widely used among travelers for prophylaxis. Nevertheless, their safety is open to question, especially for travelers under common cardiovascular drug therapy. We report the case of a patient admitted for symptomatic high-grade atrioventricular (AV) block, caused by combined therapy with a common malaria prophylactic drug--mefloquine--and a beta-blocker prescribed for a symptomatic arrhythmia. Withdrawal of the beta-blocker led to disappearance of the AV block despite continuation of the malaria prophylaxis. Mefloquine drug interactions are briefly described, particularly in terms of the caution needed in travelers already under beta-blocker therapy in whom antimalarial drug prophylaxis is recommended.", 
    "14": "Some antiglaucomatous eyedrops can cause blurred vision after application. Contrast sensitivity after application, however, has not been examined. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of antiglaucomatous eyedrops on contrast sensitivity function.", 
    "15": "In 23 eyes of 23 normal volunteers (34.9 +/- 14.5 years [mean +/- SD]), contrast sensitivity was measured before and 2, 5, 10, and 15 minutes after application of antiglaucomatous eyedrops. Three drugs, timolol maleate ion-activated gel, timolol maleate thermosetting gel, and brinzolamide were tested in this study, and the time course of changes in contrast sensitivity after instillation was statistically analyzed and compared between the drugs.", 
    "16": "All drugs significantly reduced contrast sensitivity function (p<0.001). The reduction in contrast sensitivity persisted for approximately 5 minutes after instillation of timolol maleate ion-activated gel and brinzolamide. For timolol maleate thermosetting gel, the reduction in contrast sensitivity lasted for about 10 minutes, but the reduction immediately (two minutes) after instillation was significantly smaller than that of the other two drugs (p<0.05).", 
    "17": "Instillation of these three drugs temporarily degrades contrast sensitivity function, leading to blurred vision, which should be sufficiently explained to patients before treatment with these eyedrops.", 
    "18": "Chronic aortic dissections are complex lesions with a fairly predictable natural history depending on factors such as baseline aortic diameter, the degree of false lumen thrombosis, the presence of a persistent communication, an underlying connective tissue disorder, and the control of hypertension. Medical management with antihypertensive therapy including beta-blockers is the treatment of choice for all stable chronic aortic dissections. Repair is indicated in the case of complications: aortic rupture, malperfusion syndromes, symptomatic dissections, asymptomatic dissections becoming significantly aneurysmal or demonstrating a rapid growth rate. In this regard, serial imaging of the aorta is crucial to detect unstable lesions requiring surgery or an endovascular intervention. As endograft technologies improve endovascular approach may become the future standard of care.", 
    "19": "The purpose of the present study was to determine whether change in plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level at an early phase of carvedilol therapy is a predictor of improvement in cardiac function and long-term prognosis in patients with systolic chronic heart failure (CHF).", 
    "20": "Neurohumoral factors and haemodynamics were examined in 64 patients with systolic CHF (left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) below 45%) before and one month (early phase) and 3 to 6 months (late phase) after the start of carvedilol therapy. These patients were followed up for a mean period of 57 months. Plasma BNP levels were already decreased in the early phase before improvement of LVEF in response to carvedilol therapy. Univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses showed that Delta log brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)E (= log BNP at baseline--log BNP at early phase) (P < 0.0001) was a significant independent predictor of improvement in LVEF in the late phase. Cardiac events occurred in I I patients during the follow-up period. In addition, multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis showed that Delta log BNPE (P = 0.0045) and systolic blood pressure at baseline (P = -0.048) were significant independent predictors of the development of cardiac events.",

    "22": "Poor bioavailability (<1%) of drugs from conventional eye drops is mainly due to the various precorneal loss factors which include rapid tear turnover, systemic drug absorption through naso-lachrymal duct, transient residence time of the drug solution in the cul-de-sac and the relative impermeability of the drugs to corneal epithelial membrane. The present study describes the formulation and evaluation of chitosan and gellan gum based novel in-situ gel system activated by dual physiological mechanisms. Chitosan (a pH-sensitive polymer) in combination with gellan gum (an ion-activated polymer) were used as gelling agent. Timolol maleate, the drug which is frequently used for glaucoma therapy was used as model drug to check the efficacy of the formulation. The developed formulation was characterized for various in vitro parameters, for example, clarity, gelation pH, isotonicity, sterility, viscosity, transcorneal permeation profile, and ocular irritation. Ocular retention was studied by gamma scintigraphy and a significant increase in retention time was observed. The formulation was also found to be nonirritant and well tolerable. The developed system can be a viable alternative to conventional eye drops for the treatment of various ocular diseases and is suitable for clinical application.", 
    "23": "A 35-year-old man with multiple bone fractures underwent an emergency operation. On arriving at the operating room, his heart rate was 160 beats x min(-1), and blood pressure was 100/50 mmHg. We anesthetized him with oxygen, sevoflurane, fentanyl and remifentanil. We suspected hypovolemia, and treated him with crystalloid and transfused red cells and fresh frozen plasma so that heart rate and blood pressure could be stabilized. Tachycardia of 140 beats x min(-1) persisted, and landiolol was continuously administered at a rate of 5-10 mg x hr(-1) after a 2.5 mg bolus injection. Heart rate became controlled around 120 beats x min(-1) without hypotension during anesthesia. Finally, we noticed thyroid crisis in this case, and diagnosed it with laboratory data after operation. We should be aware that atypical tachycardia is caused by thyroid crisis.", 
    "24": "G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are seven-transmembrane proteins that mediate most cellular responses to hormones and neurotransmitters. They are the largest group of therapeutic targets for a broad spectrum of diseases. Recent crystal structures of GPCRs have revealed structural conservation extending from the orthosteric ligand-binding site in the transmembrane core to the cytoplasmic G-protein-coupling domains. In contrast, the extracellular surface (ECS) of GPCRs is remarkably diverse and is therefore an ideal target for the discovery of subtype-selective drugs. However, little is known about the functional role of the ECS in receptor activation, or about conformational coupling of this surface to the native ligand-binding pocket. Here we use NMR spectroscopy to investigate ligand-specific conformational changes around a central structural feature in the ECS of the beta(2) adrenergic receptor: a salt bridge linking extracellular loops 2 and 3. Small-molecule drugs that bind within the transmembrane core and exhibit different efficacies towards G-protein activation (agonist, neutral antagonist and inverse agonist) also stabilize distinct conformations of the ECS. We thereby demonstrate conformational coupling between the ECS and the orthosteric binding site, showing that drugs targeting this diverse surface could function as allosteric modulators with high subtype selectivity. Moreover, these studies provide a new insight into the dynamic behaviour of GPCRs not addressable by static, inactive-state crystal structures.",

Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the association between 4 quartiles of SUA level and correspondent serum creatinine (SCr) concentrations.", 
    "27": "Hypertensive subjects had a high prevalence of hyperuricemia (men, 35%; women, 43%). SUA was significantly associated with the independent risk factors of SCr, diuretic usage, and diabetes (inversely related) in both genders, whereas \u03b2-blocker usage and body mass index were only associated in men. Multiple logistic regression models showed that in the non-diuretic user group the highest SUA quartile entailed >4 times greater risk for SCr elevation than the lowest. In the diuretic user group, a >2 times greater risk was noted.",

    "31": "Fifteen of the 18 anti-\u03b21/2AR ELISA-positive samples demonstrated evidence for negative inotropic muscarinic effects which were blocked using atropine. Atropine failed to uncover a positive inotropic response in 2 of the 18 IgG samples (false positive ELISA for AA\u03b2AR). In the remaining 16 AA\u03b2AR true-positive subjects, the \u03b21AR-induced increase in contractility (concurrent M2/\u03b22 blockade) was augmented to 140.5\u00b112.2% of baseline compared to 127.4\u00b17.2% of baseline with M2 blockade (atropine) only (p<0.001, n=16).

A significant decrease in mean arterial pressure occurred in the low EF group, but the decrease was within 30% of the baseline. In the normal EF group, there was no decrease in cardiac index (CI), whereas in the low EF group, CI significantly decreased along with the decrease in HR.

    "49": "A co-morbidity of sleep apnoea is hypertension associated with elevated sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) which may result from conditioning to chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH). Our hypothesis is that SNA depends on input to the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) from neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) that release arginine vasopressin (AVP) and specifically, that increased SNA evoked by CIH depends on this excitatory input. In two sets of neuroanatomical experiments, we determined if AVP neurons project from the PVN to the RVLM and if arginine vasopressin (V(1A)) receptor expression increases in the RVLM after CIH conditioning (8 h per day for 10 days). In the first set, cholera toxin beta subunit (CT-beta) was microinjected into the RVLM to retrogradely label the PVN neurons. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that 14.6% of CT-beta-labelled PVN neurons were double-labelled with AVP. In the second set, sections of the medulla were immunolabelled for V(1A) receptors, and the V(1A) receptor-expressing cell count was significantly greater in the RVLM (P < 0.01) and in the neighbouring rostral ventral respiratory column (rVRC) from CIH- than from room air (RA)-conditioned rats. In a series of physiological experiments, we determined if blocking V(1A) receptors in the medulla would normalize blood pressure in CIH-conditioned animals and attenuate its response to disinhibition of PVN. Blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), diaphragm (D(EMG)) and genioglossus muscle (GG(EMG)) activity were recorded in anaesthetized, ventilated and vagotomized rats. The PVN was disinhibited by microinjecting a GABA(A) receptor antagonist, bicuculline (BIC, 0.1 nmol), before and after blocking V(1A) receptors within the RVLM and rVRC with SR49059 (0.2 nmol). In RA-conditioned rats, disinhibition of the PVN increased BP, HR, minute D(EMG) and GG(EMG) activity and these increases were attenuated after blocking V(1A) receptors. In CIH-conditioned rats, a significantly greater dose of blocker (0.4 nmol) was required to blunt these physiological responses (P < 0.05). Further, this dose normalized the baseline BP. In summary, AVP released by a subset of PVN neurons modulates cardiorespiratory output via V(1A) receptors in the RVLM and rVRC, and increased SNA in CIH-conditioned animals depends on up-regulation of V(1A) receptors in the RVLM.",

Patients with systemic hypertension with known or suspected CAD without a clinical history of myocardial infarction were enrolled. All patients underwent CMR for assessment of cardiac function and LGE. Prognostic data was determined by the occurrence of a hard cardiac endpoint, defined as cardiac death or a non-fatal myocardial infarction, or major adverse cardiac events (MACEs), defined as cardiac death, a non-fatal myocardial infarction, or hospitalization due to heart failure, unstable angina, or life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia. A total of 1,644 patients were enrolled; 48% were males and the mean age was 65 +/- 11 years. The average follow-up time was 863 +/- 559 days. Four hundred fifty-three (28%) patients had LGE. LGE was the strongest and most independent predictor for hard events and MACEs with hazard ratios of 4.77 and 3.38, respectively. Other independent predictors of hard events and MACEs were left ventricular ejection fraction and mass, the use of a beta-blocker, and a history of heart failure. The risk of cardiac events increased as the extent of LGE increased; the hazard ratio was 12.74 for hard events for those with a LGE >20% of the myocardium.

For this purpose, combination of multiple antihypertensive drug is required in a large part of hypertensive patients. In combining antihypertensive drugs, it is preferable that the antihypertensive effects are augmented and the adverse effects are cancelled each other. Calcium channel blockers exert consistent hypotensive effects dose-dependently and scarcely cause hazardous side effects. Calcium channel blockers are preferentially used when angina pectoris and cerebrovascular disease exist, moreover, the prominent antihypertensive effects are useful as combination drugs for the treatment of diabetes mellitus and chronic renal diseases where the strict blood pressure control is strongly needed.",

To elucidate the mechanisms of strain responsiveness in bone cells, we investigated in vitro the responses of primary mouse osteoblasts and UMR-106 osteoblast-like cells to a single period of dynamic strain. This stimulates a cascade of events, including activation of insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-mediated phosphorylation of AKT, inhibition of GSK-3beta, increased activation of beta-catenin, and associated lymphoid-enhancing factor/T cell factor-mediated transcription. Initiation of this pathway does not involve the Wnt/LRP5/Frizzled receptor and does not culminate in increased IGF transcription. The effect of strain on IGF-IR is mimicked by exogenous des-(1-3)IGF-I and is blocked by the IGF-IR inhibitor H1356. Inhibition of strain-related prostanoid and nitric oxide production inhibits strain-related (and basal) AKT activity, but their separate ectopic administration does not mimic it. Strain-related IGF-IR activation of AKT requires estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) with which IGF-1R physically associates. The ER blocker ICI 182,780 increases the concentration of des-(1-3)IGF-I necessary to activate this cascade, whereas estrogen inhibits both basal AKT activity and its activation by des-(1-3)IGF-I. These data suggest an initial cascade of strain-related events in osteoblasts in which strain activates IGF-IR, in association with ERalpha, so initiating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT-dependent activation of beta-catenin and altered lymphoid-enhancing factor/T cell factor transcription. This cascade requires prostanoid/nitric oxide production and is independent of Wnt/LRP5.",

However, surgery also constitutes a risk factor for promotion of pre-existing micrometastases and the initiation of new metastases through several mechanisms, including the release of prostaglandins and stress hormones (e.g., catecholamines and glucocorticoids). However, the perioperative period also presents an opportunity for cell mediated immunity (CMI) and other mechanisms to eradicate or control minimal residual disease, provided that the deleterious effects of surgery are minimized. Here, we discuss the key role of endogenous stress hormones and prostaglandins in promoting the metastatic process through their direct impact on malignant cells, and through their deleterious impact on anti-cancer CMI. We further discuss the effects of anesthetic techniques, the extent of surgery, pain alleviation, and timing within the menstrual cycle with respect to their impact on tumor recurrence and physiological stress responses. Last, we suggest an attractive perioperative drug regimen, based on a combination of a cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitor and a \u03b2-adrenergic blocker, which we found effective in attenuating immune suppression and the metastasis-promoting effects of surgery in several tumor models.

In May 2009, he underwent routine CASP at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (Singapore), and ambulatory BP measurements using a BPro watch (HealthSTATS, Singapore). The patient had a CASP of 132 mmHg at the hospital, but his calculated CASP by ambulatory BP measurement at 1 pm was 120 mmHg.

However, there is a dearth of information on the role of adrenergic mediators in gastric cell proliferation. In the present study, the effects of adrenaline (ADR) and noradrenaline (NOR) on mucosal cell growth and the cell cycle were evaluated in vitro using a normal rat gastric mucosal cell line RGM-1. Cell proliferation was assessed using [3H]-thymidine incorporation and cell cycle patterns were determined by DNA labeling with propidium iodide and flow cytometric quantification. The expressions of adrenoceptors in RGM-1 were determined by Western blot. ADR (0.01 - 10\u00b5M) and NOR (0.01 - 10\u00b5M) inhibited the growth of RGM-1 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Pre-treatment of cells with ADR and NOR also inhibited the proliferation stimulated by epidermal growth factor (EGF). Neither phentolamine (non-selective \u03b1-adrenergic blocker), methoxamine (\u03b11-selective agonist) nor clonidine (\u03b12-selective agonist) significantly affected the inhibition of cell proliferation produced by ADR and NOR. Propranolol (non-selective \u03b2-adrenergic blocker) and butoxamine (selective \u03b22-adrenergic blocker) significantly (but not totally) reversed the inhibitory action of ADR on cell proliferation. Furthermore, procaterol (selective beta-2 agonist) but not dobutamine (selective beta-1 agonist) had effects similar to those produced by ADR and NOR. Exposure of RGM-1 cells to both ADR and NOR caused significant inhibition of the G1 - S cycle progression as evidenced by the higher percentage of the G0/G1 phase and a decreased S- phase. This effect was blocked by pre-treatment with propranolol but not phentolamine These results indicate that catecholamines inhibit the proliferation of RGM-1 cells probably partly through beta-2 receptors.",

    "113": "Review oral modified release drug forms of beta-adrenoblocker metoprolol which is used in arterial hypertension and ischemic heart disease is presented. Metoprolol has salts such as tartrate which is used for production of immediate release (IR) and sustained release (SR) forms and succinate used for production of controlled release form (CR/XL). Metoprolol SR has monolith matrix type, metoprolol CR/XL-system of multiple pellets. Effect of metoprolol tartrate (IR) on mortality was demonstrated in a number of studies in patients with arterial hypertension (AH) (MAPHY), myocardial infarction (SMT, GMT, MIAMI), dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure (MDC). Studies of efficacy of metoprolol SR are scarce. Antihypertensive efficacy of metoprolol SR in patients with AH did not exceed that of a metoprolol IR or CR/XL. First retrospective analysis of efficacy of metoprolol tartrate and succinate (CR/XL) in patients after myocardial infarction allowed to obtain comparable results of 34% mortality lowering. In a prospective study in patients with chronic heart failure (COMET) metoprolol tartrate IR was not superior to carvedilol when mortality lowering was concerned. At the same time administration of controlled release metoprolol (CR/XL) in 2 large clinical trials (RESOLVD, MERITAHF) was advantageous in patients with chronic heart failure relative to lowering of mortality and rate of hospitalizations. A novel controlled release form of metoprolol has been created as a tartrate salt on the basis of pellet technology (CD/ERT) and its bioequivalence to metoprolol CR/XL has been proved.",

While not as extensively investigated as AF following cardiac surgery, some strategies for prophylaxis of AF after noncardiac thoracic surgery have been studied. Evidence from prospective, randomized controlled studies supports the use of beta-blockers, diltiazem, amiodarone or magnesium for prevention of AF after pulmonary resection. Limited evidence supports the efficacy of intravenous amiodarone for prevention of AF after esophagectomy. Further study is necessary to determine the safest and most effective methods of prophylaxis of AF after noncardiac thoracic surgery, and to identify patients most likely to benefit from AF prophylaxis.",

According to the SSRC PM data in a cohort of 300 men with high cardiovascular risk ED was diagnosed in 61% of cases, while among 300 men with verified diagnosis of IHD was detected in 92.7% of cases. According to recommendations of the European Society of Urology changes of life style and correction of risk factors should precede therapy of ED or be components of complex therapy. It is known that some antihypertensive drugs (nonselective beta-adrenoblockers, thiazide diuretics) can negatively affect erectile function. According to data of comparative randomized clinical study average therapeutic doses of thiazide-like and thiazide diuretics in combination with ACE inhibitors do not worsen erectile function. Data on effect of lipid lowering therapy on erectile function are equivocal. Type 5 phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDI) are first line preparations for the treatment of patients with ED. Safety of combination of type 5 PDI with main groups of antihypertensive drugs has been demonstrated in persons with risk factors of CVD and ED. The use of type 5 PDI in men depends on degree of compensation of cardiovascular system. In unstable cardiovascular events preparations of this group can be also carefully used. Simultaneous administration of nitrates is a contraindication for type 5 PDI.",

But often a necessity arises to enhance pulse slowing therapy with the use of combinations of drugs exerting negative chronotropic effect. We present here results of the CONTROL study (n=1777), conducted with the aim of studying antianginal efficacy and tolerability of the If-channels blocker ivabradine used in combination with beta-adrenoblockers in patients with stable functional class II-III angina and frequency of attacks > or = 3/week and HR>70 bpm. The use of ivabradine for 12 weeks allowed to achieve greater reduction of frequency of anginal attacks (by 4 per week, 95% confidence interval 3-6) compared with the group of usual care (treatment at physicians discretion). At the end of the study in ivabradine group 43% of patients had no angina at all, HR lowering < or =60 bpm was noted in 46% of patients (in the comparison group14 and 6%, respectively, p < 0.001). Reduction of frequency of attacks of angina correlated with HR lowering, more with pulse rate measured by patients themselves (r = 0.411, p < 0.001), than with values measured at visits to physicians (r = 0.266, p < 0.001). Rate of lethal outcomes as well as rate of nonfatal cardiovascular complications (myocardial infarction, stroke, urgent revascularization) were similar in compared groups. In ivabradine group compared with usual care group there were less hospitalizations (5.0 and 8.6%, respectively, p = 0.021), calls for emergency service (13.3 and 25.4%), and sick leaves (6.6 and 13.1%, p = 0.018).

During long-term carvedilol therapy, CHF patients with the Arg/Arg genotype of the ADRB1 gene were observed to have a more pronounced decrease in the functional class of heart failure, a significant increase in left ventricular ejection, and a decrease in left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic sizes as compared with patients with the Gly/Arg genotype.",

Daily AP profile, structural and functional characteristics of left ventricle were evaluated before and after therapy by echocardiography, cerebral dopplerography, conjunctival biomicroscopy, measurement of MC, hemorheologic parameters, blood lipid spectrum and glucose level. The target AP level and normalization of AP daily profile were achieved in 65% of the patients. The treatment improved myocardial contractility and diastolic function, decreased LV mass, corrected autoregulation of cerebral blood flow and MC. Metoprolol was shown to be metabolically inert.

The group IValpha PLA(2) also participates in the release, while secretory PLA(2)s play a minor role. Two anti-inflammatory synthetic fatty acids, tetradecylthioacetic acid and tetradecylselenoacetic acid, are shown to interfere with signalling events upstream of group IValpha PLA(2) activation. In summary, our major novel finding is the involvement of the arachidonyl non-selective group VI PLA(2) in PAF-induced inflammatory responses.", 
    "128": "We propose a simple and practical approach to the identification, evaluation and treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) resulting from an enlarging and obstructive prostate. The proposed Simplified Treatment for Enlarged Prostate (STEP) plan is a logical guide to patient management by the primary care provider (PCP). Symptoms of enlarged prostate (EP) are common and may frequently progress into a condition with profound adverse effects on quality of life. Despite the high prevalence, EP is underdiagnosed and undertreated. This situation may result from patient- and provider-related issues. Assessment of symptoms of EP should be initiated with a discussion of LUTS. Evaluation includes a focused history, physical examination and selected laboratory tests. Certain factors put the symptomatic patient at risk for disease progression; however, not all factors can be readily evaluated in the PCP setting. The serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level acts both as an indicator of prostatic size and a screening tool for prostatic cancer, and thereby provides an important tool for PCPs. The STEP plan is a logical guide to patient management. Step 1, watchful waiting, is appropriate in patients with symptoms that are not bothersome. If symptoms cause bother, the initiation of an alpha-blocker (AB) in step 2, provides relatively rapid symptom improvement. Patients with bothersome symptoms and a PSA > or = 1.5 ng/ml are at risk for progression and consideration should be given to combination treatment with an AB and a 5alpha-reductase inhibitor (step 3). Patients with refractory symptoms should be referred to a urologist (step 4). Identification, evaluation and management of EP are within the domain of the primary care setting. The STEP approach provides a simple and practical framework for PCPs to manage most men with symptoms of EP.",

As such, it can be used as a model system for analyzing the molecular mechanisms of water permeability. We investigated AQP dynamics and water permeability in the pelvic skin of H. japonica following challenge with AVT, hydrins (intermediate peptides of pro-AVT) and beta-adrenergic effectors. In the in vivo experiment, both AQP-h2 and AQP-h3 proteins were translocated to the apical plasma membrane in the principal cells of the first-reacting cell (FRC) layer in the pelvic skin following challenge with AVT, hydrin 1 and hydrin 2, thereby increasing the water permeability of the pelvic skin. The beta-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol (IP) and its anatagonist propranolol (PP) in combination with AVT or hydrins were used as challenge in the in vitro experiment. IP increased water permeability whereas PP inhibited it, and both events were well correlated with the translocation of the AQPs to the apical membrane. In the PP+AVT-treated skins, labels for AQP-h2 and AQP-h3 were differentially visible among the principal cells; the apical plasma membrane of some cells was labeled while others were not, indicating that the response of PP or AVT is different from cell to cell. These results provide morphological evidence that the principal cells of the FRC layers may have two kinds of receptors: a V2 receptor and beta-adrenergic receptor.",

Both centrally active drugs impaired spatial learning when administered together, exerting no effect in separate applications. Locomotion was impaired only in a combined application of higher doses of both drugs (2 mg/kg prazosin and 20 mg/kg propranolol). These results suggest an in vivo interaction between these two types of receptors in spatial navigation regulation.", 
    "149": "During exercise, beta-feedforward coronary vasodilation has been shown to contribute to the matching of myocardial oxygen supply with the demand of the myocardium. Since both beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptors are present in the coronary microvasculature, we investigated the relative contribution of these subtypes to beta-feedforward coronary vasodilation during exercise as well as to infusion of the beta(1)-agonist norepinephrine and the beta(1)- and beta(2)-agonist isoproterenol. Chronically instrumented swine were studied at rest and during graded treadmill exercise (1-5 km/h) under control conditions and after beta(1)-blockade with metoprolol (0.5 mg/kg iv) and beta(1)/beta(2)-blockade with propranolol (0.5 mg/kg iv). The selectivity and degree of beta-blockade of metoprolol and propranolol were confirmed using isoproterenol infusion (0.05-0.4 microg. kg(-1).min(-1)) under resting conditions. Isoproterenol-induced coronary vasodilation was mediated through the beta(2)-adrenoceptor, whereas norepinephrine-induced coronary vasodilation was principally mediated through the beta(1)-adrenoceptor. Exercise resulted in a significant increase in left ventricular norepinephrine release and epinephrine uptake. beta(1)-Adrenoceptor blockade with metoprolol had very little effect under resting conditions. However, during exercise, metoprolol attenuated the increase in myocardial oxygen supply in excess of the reduction in myocardial oxygen demand, as evidenced by a progressive decrease in coronary venous Po(2). Consequently, metoprolol caused a clockwise rotation of the relationship between myocardial oxygen consumption and coronary venous Po(2). Additional beta(2)-adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol further inhibited myocardial oxygen supply during exercise, resulting in a further clockwise rotation of the relationship between myocardial oxygen consumption and coronary venous Po(2). In conclusion, both beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptors contribute to the beta-feedforward coronary resistance vessel dilation during exercise.",

Block of the human Ether-a-go go Related Gene (hERG) ion channel in particular is associated with life-threatening arrhythmias, such as Torsade de Pointes (TdP). Here we investigated human cardiomyocytes derived from pluripotent (embryonic) stem cells (hESC) as a renewable, scalable, and reproducible system on which to base cardiac safety pharmacology assays. Analyses of extracellular field potentials in hESC-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CM) and generation of derivative field potential duration (FPD) values showed dose-dependent responses for 12 cardiac and noncardiac drugs. Serum levels in patients of drugs with known effects on QT interval overlapped with prolonged FPD values derived from hESC-CM, as predicted. We thus propose hESC-CM FPD prolongation as a safety criterion for preclinical evaluation of new drugs in development. This is the first study in which dose responses of such a wide range of compounds on hESC-CM have been generated and shown to be predictive of clinical effects. We propose that assays based on hESC-CM could complement or potentially replace some of the preclinical cardiac toxicity screening tests currently used for lead optimization and further development of new drugs.",

Patients undergoing PCI in the recent waves were older and more often reported comorbidities. However, fewer patients across the waves reported post-PCI angina at one year (wave 1 to 5: 24%, 23%, 18%, 20%, 20%; P(trend)<0.001). The lower risk of angina in recent waves was explained by patient characteristics including use of antianginal medications at discharge (relative risk [95% CI] for waves 2, 3, 4 versus 1: 1.0 [0.9 to 1.2], 0.9 [0.7 to 1.1], 1.0 [0.8 to 1.3], 0.9 [0.7 to 1.1]). Similar trend was seen in the average quality of life scores over time (adjusted mean score for waves 1 to 5: 6.2, 6.5, 6.6 and 6.6; P(trend)=0.01).

Patients presenting to OHS hospitals had substantially lower in-hospital mortality (7.0% versus 9.8%, P<0.001) and were more likely to receive any form of acute reperfusion therapy (80.8% versus 70.8%, P<0.001). Patients who presented to OHS hospitals were more likely to receive guideline recommended medications within 24 hours of arrival. In a propensity score model matching for patient characteristics and transfer status, in-hospital mortality remained significantly lower among patients presenting to OHS hospitals (7.2% versus 9.3%, P=0.025). When this model was further adjusted for differences in the use of acute reperfusion therapy, medications administered within 24 hours and hospital characteristics, the mortality difference was of borderline significance (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.01; P=0.067).

Guideline-recommended medical therapy use for the combination of aspirin and statins in all patients and beta-blockers in patients with ischemic heart disease was 41% in the perioperative period. The use of perioperative evidence-based medication was associated with a reduction of 3-year mortality after adjustment for clinical characteristics (hazard ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.94). After 3 years of follow-up, aspirin was used in 74%, statins in 69%, and beta-blockers in 54% of the patients respectively.

The main outcome measures were hospitals' combined compliance with 5 AMI measures (aspirin and beta-blocker on admission and discharge and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker use at discharge for patients with left ventricular dysfunction) and risk-adjusted 30-day mortality for 2005. We stratified hospitals into those with low AMI adherence (ranked in the lowest decile for AMI adherence for 3 consecutive years [2004-2006, n=105]), high adherence (ranked in the top decile for 3 consecutive years [n=63]), and intermediate adherence (all others [n=2593]). Mean AMI performance varied significantly across low-, intermediate-, and high-performing hospitals (mean score, 68% versus 92% versus 99%, P<0.001). Low-performing hospitals were more likely than intermediate- and high-performing hospitals to be safety-net providers (19.2% versus 11.0% versus 6.4%; P=0.005). Low-performing hospitals had higher unadjusted 30-day mortality rates (23.6% versus 17.8% versus 14.9%; P<0.001).

In heterozygous A/G individuals, there was no difference in the occurrence of the primary outcome when randomized to verapamil SR versus atenolol treatment (odds ratio 1.47 95% CI 0.86 to 2.53), whereas homozygous G/G individuals had a greater than 4-fold increased risk of the primary outcome with verapamil treatment compared with those randomized to atenolol treatment (odds ratio 4.59 95% CI 1.67 to 12.67).

    "182": "The conversion of the antibiotic ofloxacin and the beta-blocker atenolol by means of TiO(2) photocatalysis was investigated. Irradiation was provided by a UVA lamp at 3.37x10(-6)einstein/s photon flux, while emphasis was given on the effect of catalyst type and loading (50-1500mg/L), initial substrate concentration (5-20mg/L), initial pH (3-10) and the effect of H(2)O(2) (0.07-1.4mM) as an additional oxidant on substrate conversion and mineralization in various matrices (i.e. pure water, groundwater and treated municipal effluent). Conversion was assessed measuring sample absorbance at 288 and 224nm for ofloxacin and atenolol, respectively, while mineralization measuring the dissolved organic carbon. Degussa P25 TiO(2) was found to be more active than other TiO(2) samples for either substrate degradation, with ofloxacin being more reactive than atenolol. Conversion generally increased with increasing catalyst loading, decreasing initial substrate concentration and adding H(2)O(2), while the effect of solution pH was substrate-specific. Reaction rates, following a Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic expression, were maximized at a catalyst to substrate concentration ratio (w/w) of 50 and 15 for ofloxacin and atenolol, respectively, while higher ratios led to reduced efficiency. Likewise, high concentrations of H(2)O(2) had an adverse effect on reaction, presumably due to excessive oxidant scavenging radicals and other reactive species. The ecotoxicity of ofloxacin and atenolol to freshwater species Daphnia magna was found to increase with increasing substrate concentration (1-10mg/L) and exposure time (24-48h), with atenolol being more toxic than ofloxacin. Photocatalytic treatment eliminated nearly completely toxicity and this was more pronounced for atenolol.", 
    "183": "Nebivolol is a third-generation beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist (beta-blocker) with high selectivity for beta(1)-adrenergic receptors. In addition, it causes vasodilatation via interaction with the endothelial L-arginine/nitric oxide (NO) pathway. This dual mechanism of action underlies many of the haemodynamic properties of nebivolol, which include reductions in heart rate and blood pressure (BP), and improvements in systolic and diastolic function. With respect to BP lowering, the NO-mediated effects cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and an increase in stroke volume with preservation of cardiac output. Flow-mediated dilatation and coronary flow reserve are also increased during nebivolol administration. Other haemodynamic effects include beneficial effects on pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary wedge pressure, exercise capacity and left ventricular ejection fraction. In addition, nebivolol does not appear to have adverse effects on lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity like traditional beta-blockers. The documented beneficial haemodynamic effects of nebivolol are translated into improved clinical outcomes in patients with hypertension or heart failure. In patients with hypertension, the incidence of bradycardia with nebivolol is often lower than that with other currently available beta-blockers. This, along with peripheral vasodilatation and NO-induced benefits such as antioxidant activity and reversal of endothelial dysfunction, should facilitate better protection from cardiovascular events. In addition, nebivolol has shown an improved tolerability profile, particularly with respect to events commonly associated with beta-blockers, such as fatigue and sexual dysfunction. Data from SENIORS (Study of the Effects of Nebivolol Intervention on Outcomes and Rehospitalization in Seniors with Heart Failure) showed that significantly fewer nebivolol versus placebo recipients experienced the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality or cardiovascular hospitalization. The benefits of nebivolol therapy were shown to be cost effective. Thus, nebivolol is an effective and well tolerated agent with benefits over and above those of traditional beta-blockade because of its effects on NO release, which give it unique haemodynamic effects, cardioprotective activity and a good tolerability profile.", 
    "184": "The fate of beta blockers (atenolol, acebutolol, bisoprolol, celiprolol, metoprolol, nadolol, pindolol, propranolol, and sotalol) was studied in surface water-sediment systems. A new analytical method was developed to determine the beta blockers in sediments by LC-ESI-tandem MS detection. The relative recoveries in sediments ranged from 89 +/- 7% (acebutolol) to 102 +/- 3% (nadolol) using deuterated surrogate standards. Beta blockers were present with concentrations up to 86 ng/g (bisoprolol) in the sediments of small German streams containing an elevated percentage of treated wastewater. Biotransformation studies and sorption isotherms of the beta blockers were performed with two natural river sediments (\"Burgen\", \"Dausenau\") differing in organic carbon content and particle size distribution. Biotransformation of beta blockers in the surface water-sediment systems exhibited a low to high persistence with 90% disappearance (DT(90)) ranging from 0.4-10 d (pindolol, atenolol) to >100 d (sotalol, propranolol or celiprolol). For sorption studies neither NaN(3) addition nor autoclavation led to a complete mass balance of the beta blockers, probably due to biotransformation. Isotherms at 6 h (apparent equilibrium, measuring aqueous and sediment phase) fitted by the Freundlich equation show that sorption of all beta blockers to the Burgen sediment were linear or close to it (i.e., n-values between 0.93 and 1.13), while in the Dausenau sediment the sorptions were slightly non linear (i.e., n-values 0.77-0.91). In river water the sorbed fraction is negligible in comparison to the dissolved fraction. Nevertheless, beta blockers can be detected with concentrations up to 86 ng/g (bisoprolol) in sediments of small streams containing more than 50% treated wastewater."
