    "0": "The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of propranolol upon protein synthesis and degradation processes in cell-free subfractions of rat myocardium in experimental cardiac hypertrophy induced by aortic stenosis. It was found that hypertrophy stimulates incorporation of 3H-amino acids by the postmitochondrial supernatant (PMS) by 17 +/- 4% (mean +/- SE). Propranolol 10 6M inhibited protein synthesis in the control and experimental groups by 37 +/- 5% and 34 +/- 7%, respectively. At a concentration of 5 X 10 6M, propranolol-induced inhibition in each group was 74 +/- 4% and 58 +/- 5%, respectively. The activity of neutral proteases in PMS of hypertrophic hearts increased up to 255 +/- 29 IU in comparison to 154 +/- 10 IU in controls; in the cytosol it was unchanged. Propranolol had no effect upon the activity of proteases in both fractions. Activity of calcium-activated neutral proteases (CANP) remained at the same level in control and hypertrophic hearts and was unaffected by propranolol.", 
    "1": "Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) was measured during dynamic exercise in 10 patients with coronary heart disease before and after single dose atenolol 50 mg and acebutolol 200 mg, respectively. Systolic blood pressure, heart rate and the rate-pressure product increased during exercise before and after beta-blockade, but levels were lower after beta-blockade. Plasma ANP levels at rest were unchanged after atenolol, but rose after acebutolol (p less than 0.01). During exercise plasma ANP increased significantly both before and after beta-blockade, but plasma ANP levels were higher after acebutolol at all workloads (p less than 0.05), whereas plasma ANP levels after atenolol were higher at 125 W exclusively (p less than 0.05). The augmented ANP levels during exercise after beta-blockade probably reflect catecholamine-stimulated ANP release, whereas the elevated plasma ANP levels after acebutolol at rest might be a beta-adrenoceptor-mediated ANP release due to the intrinsic sympathomimetic effect of acebutolol.", 
    "2": "The effects of butyl 3'-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)oxanilate (WP-833), a new antiallergic drug, on type I to type IV allergic reactions were investigated by employing various animal models. WP-833 (i.v. and p.o.) dose-dependently inhibited homologous or heterologous passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) mediated by rat or mouse immunoglobulin E (IgE) in rats. Homologous PCA caused by guinea pig IgE was also inhibited by WP-833. In addition, WP-833 had inhibitory actions upon homologous PCA induced by rat or guinea pig IgG. However, WP-833 showed no inhibition of rat skin reactions caused by histamine, serotonin and bradykinin, contrasting with the inhibition of prostaglandin E1-induced skin reaction. Furthermore, both adrenalectomy and propranolol treatment exerted no influences on the inhibition of IgE-mediated homologous PCA in rats by WP-833. In contrast to above findings demonstrating that WP-833 clearly inhibited type I allergic reaction, systemic Forssman shock in guinea pigs and reversed cutaneous anaphylaxis in rats (type II), passive Arthus reaction in rats (type III), and contact dermatitis and tuberculin reaction in mice (type IV) were unaffected by WP-833 even in higher doses than in those capable of completely inhibiting type I allergic reaction.", 
    "3": "Arterial blood pressure and central hemodynamic changes were assessed in 44 patients with essential hypertension, uncontrollable by prazosin alone, after propranolol (anaprilin), celiprolol, clonidine (clofelin) or verapamil were added to the treatment schedule. A selective beta 1-adrenoblocker, celiprolol, is shown to be the best option in prazosin-treated patients with reflex increment of heart rate and stroke volume. The prazosin-verapamil combination is also justified in cases of moderately increased pulse rate, while propranolol and clonidine produce no additional hypotensive effect when combined with prazosin.", 
    "4": "A patient is presented who suffered for 3 years from increasing photosensitivity with chronic eczematous lesions in sun-exposed areas. He had taken one Neotri (triamterene, xipamide) tablet daily for 6 years. After discontinuation of the drug, phototesting and a photopatch test failed to reveal pathological reactions. Eczematous lesions, however, were induced in test areas upon systemic photochallenging with Neotri. One year later, after the antihypertensive medication had been changed from Adalat (nifedipine) to Teneretic (atenolol, chlortalidone) the eczematous photosensitive reaction recurred. Since both xipamide and chlortalidone have a chlorsulfamoyl-substituted aromatic ring in common, it seems that a photoallergic cross-reaction occurred.", 
    "5": "To characterize the responses of the canine coronary artery to serotonin, rings with and without endothelium were suspended in organ chambers for isometric tension recording. Serotonin evoked an endothelium-dependent relaxation of prostaglandin F2 alpha-contracted rings which was inhibited by antagonists with affinity for 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1 and 5-HT2 receptors, methiothepin and metergoline, but was not mimicked or antagonized by the 5-HT1A-selective ligand, 8-hydroxy-2-di-n-propylamino tetralin. This relaxation is not mediated by 5-HT1B receptors as it was not antagonized by cyanopindolol; similarly, lack of inhibition by ketanserin and MDL 72222 rule out contributions of 5-HT2 receptors or 5-HT3 receptors. Rings without endothelium contracted to serotonin; this contraction was not blocked by cyanopindolol and was only weakly inhibited by ketanserin, but was antagonized in an apparently competitive fashion by methiothepin and was mimicked by 8-hydroxy-2-di-n-propylamino tetralin (although at higher concentrations than would be expected for its action at a 5-HT1A receptor). At high concentrations, serotonin evoked a relaxation of endothelium-denuded rings, which was blocked by very low concentrations of methiothepin but was unaffected by ketanserin or cyanopindolol. Thus, there appear to be three different serotonergic receptors in the coronary artery. Although available agents do not allow their precise classification as yet, none of them is of the 5-HT2 type.", 
    "6": "Atriopeptin II has been reported to cause profound coronary vasoconstriction in the isolated perfused guinea pig heart and in the blood perfused canine heart. Consequently, this study was carried out to examine possible mechanisms by which vasomotor effects of human atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) occur in the canine coronary circulation. Bolus dosages of ANP were administered into the left circumflex coronary artery of in situ dog hearts perfused at constant flow rate. ANP produced dose-related coronary vasodilation with a threshold dosage of 2 ng/kg; a dosage of 2 micrograms/kg caused a 27 +/- 4% decrease in coronary vascular resistance. Coronary vasodilation produced by ANP was not altered by beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol (1 mg/kg i.v.). In addition, neither adenosine receptor blockade with 8-phenyltheophylline (5 mg/kg i.v.) nor cyclooxygenase inhibition with indomethacin (5 mg/kg i.v.) significantly altered the response to intra-arterial ANP. These data demonstrate that in the in vitro blood perfused canine heart, ANP administered intra-arterially results in coronary vasodilation that does not utilize adenosine-dependent or prostaglandin-dependent mechanisms.", 
    "7": "Twenty-five patients scheduled for lumbar fusion or cerebrovascular surgery were enrolled in an open label treatment controlled study comparing blood pressure and heart rate responses during deliberate hypotension with either esmolol or nitroprusside during steady-state N2O/isoflurane anesthesia. The first 5 patients were empirically assigned to the esmolol group; the remaining 20 patients were randomized to receive either esmolol or nitroprusside. The target of 15% reduction in mean arterial pressure (MAP) from baseline determined during anesthesia was attained with esmolol 195 +/- 10 micrograms/kg/min (mean +/- SEM) for the group (n = 15) or nitroprusside 1.9 +/- 0.3 micrograms/kg/min for the nitroprusside group (n = 10). Nitroprusside use was associated with a 15.9 +/- 5.3% increase in heart rate compared to a 12.1 +/- 2.2% decrease in the esmolol group (p = 0.0001 between groups). Upon termination of the hypotensive infusions, nitroprusside patients had a MAP increase of 13.9 +/- 5.5% above baseline (p less than 0.05 compared to prehypotension) while the 7.4 +/- 3.5% increase in the esmolol group was not statistically significant. Although 30% of nitroprusside patients overshot their baseline MAP by more than 25%, no esmolol patients had this degree of rebound. One esmolol patient had a brief period of atrial premature contractions. No patient in either group suffered any adverse reaction to hypotension. It is concluded that in moderate doses esmolol is a safe and effective hypotensive agent during isoflurane anesthesia, with no reflex tachycardia and no significant potential for rebound hypertension. A MAP reduction of 30% from preanesthesia baseline was readily obtained with this combination.", 
    "8": "The study was aimed at evaluation of the effect of short-term treatment with one of the six beta adrenolytic drugs (propranolol, metoprolol, atenolol, pindolol, nadolol, acebutolol) and calcium antagonist nifedipine on the values of several parameters of calcium-phosphorus metabolism in 81 patients with hyperthyroidism (14 patients with Graves' disease, and 67 patients with toxic nodular goiter), and 82 patients with simple goiter. The patients studied have been divided into seven groups, each receiving one of the investigated drugs during four days. A significant decrease in the urinary excretion of hydroxyproline was found only in the patients with hyperthyroidism receiving propranolol. This effect of propranolol on hydroxyprolinuria was not related to the degree of lowering of serum T3 concentration observed in these patients.", 
    "9": "The aim of this multicentre, double-blind, randomised, controlled study was to evaluate the antihypertensive effect and to determine the response rates, safety and tolerability of 3 doses of carvedilol (25, 50 and 100 mg) compared with those of pindolol 15 mg, in ambulatory patients with mild to moderate uncomplicated essential hypertension. Mean supine diastolic blood pressure was the primary efficacy variable. 205 subjects between 23 and 70 years of age were randomly assigned to receive an oral dose of carvedilol or pindolol once daily for 13 weeks after a placebo run-in period of up to 4 weeks. Before administration of the study medication, blood pressure was recorded at each visit by use of the cuff method, and heart rate was counted. The results showed similar reductions in mean supine diastolic blood pressure among all 4 treatments after 13 weeks. Carvedilol showed a good and similar response rate of approximately 84% at all doses. Heart rate was not significantly changed. The number of patients having adverse experiences possibly related to drug therapy was 4, 16 and 15 with 25, 50 and 100 mg carvediolol, respectively, and 9 with pindolol 15 mg. Dizziness was the most common side effect reported for all medications. In conclusion, carvedilol 25 mg appeared to be the optimum dose in the present study, displaying a high antihypertensive potency with few side effects.", 
    "10": "Carvedilol 12.5, 25 and 50 mg was administered once daily for 4 weeks to patients with mild to moderate hypertension. The purpose of the study was to investigate the antihypertensive action of carvedilol when administered once daily and to investigate the pharmacokinetics of carvedilol in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Measurable decreases in blood pressure (BP) occurred within 1 hour after the first dose. Peak decreases in supine diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were 9.0 +/- 6.8, 15.5 +/- 6.7, 14.7 +/- 10.6 and 22.5 +/- 7.6mm Hg (+/- SD) for the placebo, 12.5, 25 and 50mg carvedilol groups, respectively, and occurred between 3 and 7 hours after the dose. Administration of carvedilol once daily for 4 weeks kept supine DBP below baseline levels for 24 hours. Trough supine DBP after 4 weeks of treatment were 0.6 +/- 6.5, 7.3 +/- 7.9, 8.8 +/- 7.4 and 12.1 +/- 3.8mm Hg (+/- SD) below baseline. Serum levels of carvedilol were proportional to the dose. Peak serum levels were 39 +/- 27, 75 +/- 38 and 161 +/- 131 mu/L for carvedilol 12.5, 25 and 50mg. The kinetics of carvedilol did not change with repeated administration. Carvedilol was well tolerated; 2 patients experienced dizziness associated with postural hypotension after administration of the 50mg dose. Carvedilol 12.5, 25 and 50mg effectively reduced BP for 24 hours when administered once daily.", 
    "11": "This study was performed to find the optimal dose of carvedilol, in terms of efficacy and safety, in Japanese patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. 134 patients with blood pressure greater than 160/95 mm Hg after a 4-week placebo run-in period were initially given carvedilol 5mg once daily. The dose was increased to 10 and 20mg at 4-weekly intervals if the target blood pressure was not achieved. The duration of treatment was 12 weeks. After 12 weeks' administration, the average blood pressure was significantly (p less than 0.001) reduced from 170/101 to 150/91 mm Hg. The hypotensive activity of carvedilol 5mg was mild, but sufficient hypotensive effect was observed in 65% of patients receiving up to 20 mg/day. No significant postural changes in blood pressure were observed. Although heart rate was significantly decreased (77 to 66 beats/min, p less than 0.001), no patient was judged to have bradycardia. Side effects occurred in 5.2% of patients. Carvedilol 10 to 20mg once daily is considered to be an effective and safe treatment for essential hypertension.", 
    "12": "Six weeks of treatment with carvedilol, N-696, celiprolol, dilevalol, acebutolol, urapidil, doxazosin and altiopril reduced blood pressure with various changes in heart rate. Cardiac index decreased and total peripheral resistance index (TPRI) stayed at the pretreatment levels in the carvedilol, N-696 and acebutolol groups, whereas TPRI tended to decrease in the celiprolol (p less than 0.05), dilevalol (p less than 0.05), urapidil, doxazosin (p less than 0.05) and altiopril groups; cardiac index was unchanged in these groups. As carvedilol and N-696 have no beta 1-selectivity and no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), their direct vasodilating property (and the possible alpha-blocking activity of carvedilol) may precipitate in minimising an increase in TPRI induced by vascular beta 2-blockade and suppressed cardiac pump function. Celiprolol and dilevalol, with beta 2-selective ISA, reduced cardiac index slightly and insignificantly, and decreased TPRI. These results indicate that ISA on vascular beta 2-receptors may induce vasodilatation and ISA on cardiac beta 2-receptors may counteract cardiac beta 2-blockade. Differences in haemodynamic responses between these drugs with ISA and vasodilators such as alpha-blocking agents (urapidil and doxazosin) and an ACE inhibitor, altiopril, may be attributable to manifestation of cardiac beta-blockade as observed in the drugs with ISA.", 
    "13": "There is conflicting evidence regarding the main mechanism of the vasodilating effect with carvedilol at therapeutic doses, and to examine this, single doses of carvedilol 50mg and 100mg were compared with labetalol 400mg, propranolol 160mg, propranolol 80mg plus hydralazine 50mg and placebo in healthy subjects. Dose-response studies (required to increase heart rate or systolic blood pressure by 25 beats/min and 20mm Hg, respectively) were performed with phenylephrine, angiotensin and isoprenaline after each drug, and placebo administration and the effects of physiological pressor stimuli were compared. Phenylephrine systolic pressure dose-response curves were shifted by labetalol (dose ratio 2.4) and both carvedilol doses (dose ratios 50mg 1.9, 100mg 20.2). The slight shift to the right of the angiotensin dose-response curves with hydralazine plus propranolol (dose ratio 1.4) and carvedilol 50mg (dose ratio 1.4) was not significant. beta-Blockade was greatest with propranolol 160mg, followed by carvedilol 100mg, propranolol 80mg plus hydralazine 50mg, carvedilol 50mg and was least with labetalol 400mg (isoprenaline dose ratios required to increase heart rate by 25 beats/min were 55.2, 27.2, 20.2, 14.2, 11.5, respectively). Blood pressure rise with cold pressor and isometric exercise was inhibited most by labetalol. At these acute doses carvedilol displayed some alpha-blockade, but the lower ratio of alpha-blockade to beta-blockade differed from that seen with labetalol, which may account for the different haemodynamic responses at rest and during physiological pressor stimuli with the 2 drugs. There was no definite evidence of direct vasodilator effect.", 
    "14": "The present experiments were carried out to examine the vasodilator mechanism(s) of carvedilol by use of pithed spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Animals were pithed and the dose-pressor response curves to various agonists were obtained 0.5 or 1 hour after oral administration of either carvedilol (30 mg/kg), labetalol (60 mg/kg), prazosin (0.1 mg/kg) or hydralazine (3 mg/kg). These doses of drugs caused approximately equihypotensive responses in the conscious state. Carvedilol significantly shifted the dose-pressor response curve to the right for phenylephrine but not for B-HT 920, angiotensin II and vasopressin. Labetalol and prazosin also significantly shifted the dose-response curve to the right for phenylephrine but not for angiotensin II. The rank order of inhibitory action on the phenylephrine response was prazosin greater than labetalol greater than carvedilol. In addition, carvedilol produced a slight but significant inhibition of the pressor responses to serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), which was nearly identical in magnitude to that seen with hydralazine. These results suggest that the vasodilator action of carvedilol is mainly attributed to alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade, although additional non-adrenergic mechanism(s) of action cannot be excluded.", 
    "15": "The beta-blockers in clinical use have been classified into 2 major divisions, nonselective or selective agents, and those with or without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA). These properties confer differing pharmacological properties with some relevance to the treatment of hypertension. A beta-blocker with significant beta 2-ISA can be regarded as a multiple-action drug. A third division of beta-blockers is a newer development; these agents, besides blocking the beta-receptor, possess important peripheral vasodilator activity. Labetalol was the first drug of this group and prizidolol followed, but has been withdrawn because of toxicity. Several other agents now under evaluation include bucindolol and medroxolol, and carvedilol and dilevalol (1 of the isomers of labetalol), which have been the most widely studied in hypertension. Combined action results in important haemodynamic differences compared with pure beta-blockade. Notably, peripheral resistance is reduced, and there is less reduction in, or no effect on, cardiac output. The 3 following mechanisms have been described as responsible for peripheral vasodilatation: alpha-receptor blockade, beta 2-agonism, and a dilator action independent of either the alpha- or beta-receptors. Evidence for these various mechanisms is more readily obtainable from animal experiments, but some confirmatory evidence has been obtained in man. Inhibition of alpha-stimulation has been found with labetalol and to a small degree with medroxalol and carvedilol. beta 2-Mediated vasodilatation has been shown by dilevalol and medroxolol, and evidence of vasodilatation independent of alpha- or beta-receptors has been obtained with carvedilol. More evidence is required to confirm the exact contribution of each of these mechanisms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "16": "Pharmacological treatment of hypertension can, cause clinically significant alterations in endocrine function and glucose homeostasis. The aim of this study was to investigate the antihypertensive efficacy and the influence on carbohydrate metabolism of carvedilol and metoprolol in non-insulin-dependent diabetics with mild to moderate hypertension. The patients received either carvedilol 25mg twice daily or metoprolol 50mg twice daily for a period of 4 weeks; if diastolic blood pressure was over 90mm Hg at this time, the dosage was doubled for the subsequent 4 weeks. 49 of 89 enrolled patients completed the trial according to the protocol and were statistically evaluated. After 4 weeks of carvedilol treatment, 23 of 25 patients (92%) showed a good response to therapy (reduction of diastolic blood pressure below 90mm Hg). Doubling of dosage in the carvedilol group did not further increase the response rate after another month of treatment. The response rate after 4 and 8 weeks of metroprolol treatment was 79 and 83%, respectively. In both treatment groups, blood glucose concentrations were maintained within narrow limits. Glycated haemoglobin A1, which provides a profile of the mean blood glucose levels present during the preceding weeks, also remained unchanged. Oral antidiabetic medication taken by the patient remained constant and no hypoglycaemia was reported. When used in therapeutic doses in non-insulin-dependent diabetics, carvedilol is thus unlikely to cause a deterioration of carbohydrate metabolism.", 
    "17": "Carvedilol, a new beta-blocker with vasodilating activity, was given orally to 9 hypertensive inpatients with impaired renal function in a dosage regimen of 5 to 20mg once daily to evaluate its clinical efficacy and safety. Treatment with carvedilol produced a significant decrease in blood pressure from 172/101 to 150/87mm Hg (p less than 0.01), but it did not cause orthostatic hypotension. Heart rate was decreased from 74.3 to 72.8 beats/min, but the decrease was not statistically significant. Serum creatinine and BUN levels were unchanged and other laboratory parameters were within normal limits. There were no side effects in any of the patients during the trial. These results suggest that carvedilol is a useful and safe drug for the treatment of renal hypertension.", 
    "18": "The acute antihypertensive effects and possible underlying mechanisms of 3 beta-adrenergic-blocking drugs with alpha-blocking activity, i.e. labetalol, drugs with alpha-blocking activity, i.e. labetalol, nipradilol and arotinolol, were studied in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and compared with the effects of prazosin, propranolol and hydralazine. Prazosin produced a dose-dependent antihypertensive effect which paralleled inhibition of the pressor response to phenylephrine. Labetalol (30 mg/kg), nipradilol (30 and 100 mg/kg) and arotinolol (30 and 100 mg/kg) also produced a fall in blood pressure. However, inhibition of the pressor response to phenylephrine was not seen in association with the antihypertensive effect after the lower dose of nipradilol and arotinolol. Propranolol (100 mg/kg) did not lower blood pressure. These results suggest that a mechanism(s) other than an alpha-adrenergic-blocking effect plays a role in the acute antihypertensive effects produced by the lower dose of nipradilol and arotinolol.", 
    "19": "The present paper is a review of the use of psychophysiology in diagnosis and treatment of simple phobias. The paper begins with a definition and characterization of phobic fears, together with a description of prevalence rates, age onset, and gender differences. Acquisition is then discussed within a Three-Systems model. Psychophysiological measures are described, and the typical response patterns obtained in phobic reactions are outlined. Special attention is devoted to the paradoxical response seen in blood injury phobias, and the use of beta-blockers and other pharmacological drugs. The paper is ended with a discussion of Lang's emotional imagery as a psychophysiological model for fear reactions and fear therapy.", 
    "20": "Iprindole, an active antidepressant in clinical use, has no effect on norepinephrine reuptake and does not bind to receptors of the noradrenergic system. Iprindole weakly antagonizes reserpine hypothermia and potentiates yohimbine toxicity. This effect is antagonized by propranolol but not by atenolol or metoprolol. In an acute dose, iprindole potentiates the effect of maprotiline on yohimbine toxicity. Beta 2-adrenergic agonists and antagonists specifically modify the effect of iprindole on spontaneous motility. These results indicate that iprindole has an indirect beta 2-mimetic effect.", 
    "21": "Twenty patients with moderate (4) to severe (16) hypertension, whose blood pressure (BP) could not be controlled on the previous combined antihypertensive therapy, were investigated. In acute studies the first doses of captopril, 25 and 50 mg led to a significant drop in BP 30 min after administration. The maximum fall in BP was recorded at 90-120 min and this effect was maintained throughout the whole observation period (8 hours). The fall in BP was similar in supine and standing positions and there was no change in the heart rate. During long-term (14.5 months) therapy only 2 out of the 20 patients exhibited continuing good BP control with captopril monotherapy of a maximum daily dose of 150 mg. A comparison of the acute and chronic BP lowering effects of captopril showed that the first dose of captopril caused a significantly greater decrease in BP than chronic monotherapy. However, combined captopril with a diuretic or with a diuretic and calcium antagonist or beta blocker provided a sustained BP control, significantly better than the previously used anti-hypertensive combinations (182 +/- 27/115 +/- 11 mmHg vs 164 +/- 20/104 +/- 11 mmHg p less than 0.05). The Hungarian captopril preparation (Tensiomin), similarly to other captopril products, through its angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition, caused an increase in plasma renin activity and in concentration of plasma angiotensin I and a decrease in plasma angiotensin II. Eight out of the 20 patients developed side effects, which disappeared spontaneously in 4 patients within 2-14 days. Captopril was withdrawn in 3 patients for not achieving satisfactory BP control and/or because of side effects. It is concluded that captopril is safe and effective in the long-term treatment of hypertension, however, majority of the patients with severe forms of hypertension required double or multiple combinations.", 
    "22": "H-Phe-Ile-Tyr-His-Ser-Tyr-Lys-OH after intracerebroventricular (icv.) administration inhibited the extinction of active avoidance behaviour for a short period. The dopamine receptor blocker haloperidol completely blocked this effect of the heptapeptide, while the muscarinic anticholinergic agent atropine only partly inhibited it. The alpha 1-receptor blocker phenoxybenzamine and the beta-receptor blocker propranolol did not significantly influence the extinction inhibition induced by the peptide. These results suggest that the dopaminergic and, in part the cholinergic system, play important roles in this behavioural action of H-Phe-Ile-Tyr-Ser-Tyr-Lys-OH.", 
    "23": "Effects of autonomic innervation of the heart for blood pressure oscillation (BPO) caused by a side pressure exertion procedure in rabbits were studied by intravenous administrations of atropine or beta-blockers (metoprolol and propranolol). When relatively large doses of these drugs were injected the oscillation disappeared. Atropine injection caused three types of effects on BPO: mostly abolition, diminution and sometimes augmentation. In the diminished cases, the oscillation waves were subjected to a successive decrease in the height and the gradient of ascending limbs. And the extent of bradycardia on the descending limb was less than that of the control. In the augmented cases which accounted for one fifth of all the results, the injection enhanced the BPO in wave height and gradient. Meanwhile, the administration of beta-blockers resulted in disappearance or a decrease in wave height and gradient of the ascending limbs of waves. From these, it is suggested that cardiac sympathetic and vagal discharges accelerate blood pressure rise of the ascending limb, and vagal discharges contribute to active descent of each wave. It is suggested that the BPO is influenced not only by the periodic change of the total peripheral resistance but also by the concomitant changes in tones of cardiac nerves.", 
    "24": "The effects of pacing frequency, overdrive duration and stimulus amplitude on the sinus node recovery time (SNRT) were studied in the isolated right atrium of the rat. A positive relationship between pacing frequency and the SNRT was observed, whereas overdrive duration and stimulus amplitude did not affect SNRT. There was no significant interaction among the factors studied. The effect of frequency upon SNRT probably does not involve neurotransmitter release due to stimulation, since in vitro pretreatment with atropine plus propranolol does change the SNRT-frequency relation.", 
    "25": "A number of symmetrical as well as asymmetrical bis-arenoxypropanolamines have been synthesized and evaluated for their beta-adrenolytic properties. The pharmacological characterization of these compounds was performed in vitro by direct studies (3H-dihydroalprenolol was used as the specific ligand for beta-receptors), and by determining the beta-blocking capacity on isoproterenol (ISO)-induced increased heart rate (isolated guinea-pig atrium); and in vivo by evaluating the antagonism on ISO-induced hypotension and tachycardia, as well as the intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) on reserpinized and vagotomized rats. The best result was observed with the simplest derivative, i.e. the bis-phenoxypropanolamine compound, which shows in vitro and in vivo potencies almost comparable to propranolol and, moreover, significant bronchodilating activity.", 
    "26": "One piperazine derivative of tetraline (with code P11), possessing hypotensive and anti-hypertensive activity, is studied. Its alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blocking properties are characterized by using indicators of adrenergically mediated metabolic responses in cats and rats. The parameters studied are: glucose and lactate in the blood, free fatty acids in the plasma and the activity of phosphorylase \"a\" in rat myocardium. The alpha- and beta-adrenergic properties of P11 are characterized by using adrenergic and dopaminergic agonists and antagonists (adrenaline, isoproterenol, phenylephrine, propranolol, phentolamine, apomorphine and pimozide) in the different experimental setups. Compound P11 studied inhibits the effect of phenylephrine on the glucose level in the blood of rats in a definite dose interval (1-4 mg/kg) which suggests that it possesses alpha-adrenoblocking properties. P11 decreases slightly the effects of isoproterenol or does not change these effects on the levels of glucose, lactate and free fatty acids in cats. There are no changes in the effect of adrenaline on the glucose content in rat blood and the isoproterenol-activated phosphorylase in rat myocardium is not inhibited. This gives grounds to assume that P11 possesses slight beta-adrenoblocking properties. From the analysis of the proper hyperglycaemizing action of P11 in rats in the 1-8 mg/kg dose range it may be assumed that dopamine-agonistic mechanisms are involved.", 
    "27": "The purpose of this study was to examine the conditions whereby beta-blockers cause a pressor response in conscious, unrestrained rats: (1) whether beta-blockers cause a pressor response in rats subjected to, or not subjected to, nonselective alpha-blockade with phentolamine; (2) whether the pressor response to beta-blockers is due to the blockade of vasodilator beta 2-adrenoceptors, and (3) whether it is due to an acute increase in the release of adrenaline (A) and noradrenaline (NA). In the first series of experiments cumulative dose-response curves for propranolol, atenolol and ICI 118,551, nonselective beta-, beta 1- and beta 2-selective antagonists, respectively, were constructed in rats subjected to a continuous intravenous infusion of phentolamine. The administration of each of the beta-antagonists caused a significant dose-dependent increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP). The ED50 values for the increase in MAP were found to be 3.6 +/- 0.8, 10 +/- 2.6 and 4.6 +/- 0.8 micrograms/kg for propranolol, atenolol and ICI 118,551, respectively. In the second series of experiments, a single bolus injection of a selective or nonselective beta-antagonist or saline vehicle was given to rats subjected to a continuous intravenous infusion of phentolamine. Plasma levels of A and NA were determined in the control condition, during the infusion of phentolamine and again after the injection of a beta-antagonist. The infusion of phentolamine significantly decreased MAP and increased plasma levels of A and NA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "28": "The in vivo immune effects of nine beta (beta)-blockers are studied in C5B1/6 mice after 7 days of treatment. Humoral and cellular studies indicate that several beta-blocking agents, particularly pindolol and acebutolol, may induce a polyclonal activation of lymphocytes. It may involve all the classes and subclasses of immunoglobulins with a preferential effect on IgA and IgG2a. Further investigations, conducted using the laevorotatory and dextrorotatory forms of pindolol indicate that this immune effect is not mediated by specific beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "29": "The beta-adrenoceptor blocking and diuretic properties of tienoxolol (150 mg and 300 mg) were investigated and compared to those of a placebo in a double-blind, cross-over trial in six healthy volunteers. Heart rate (HR), systolic and diastolic blood pressures, peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) at rest and during vigorous exercise, plasma renin activity (PRA) and aldosterone levels at rest, and diuresis and urinary electrolyte excretion values were measured before and at intervals up to 24 h after oral administration of the drugs. In addition, the clearances of electrolytes, uric acid, and creatinine were calculated, as well as the fractional sodium excretion (Fe Na%) before and 4 h and 24 h after drug intake. Finally, tienoxolol plasma levels were measured. Tienoxolol significantly and dose-dependently reduced exercise-induced tachycardia. This effect started 1 h after drug administration, peaked between 4 h and 6 h (-12% and -17% from control values at 150 mg and 300 mg, respectively), and lasted at least 12 h. Resting HR was decreased at 300 mg (P less than 0.05), PRA was decreased at both doses (P less than 0.05), but PEFR was not drug-affected. 24-h cumulative sodium excretion was increased (+24% at 150 mg [NS], +38% at 300 mg [P less than 0.01]) as compared to placebo, and Fe Na% did not change, regardless of the dose administered. 24-h cumulative diuresis was moderately increased by tienoxolol (NS), whereas creatinine clearance rose after the 300-mg dose, suggesting that tienoxolol might increase glomerular filtration rate. Plasma aldosterone levels remained unchanged. Finally, the elimination half-life of tienoxolol was 7.5 h. Thus, in healthy volunteers, tienoxolol behaves as an early acting and relatively long-lasting selective beta 1-adrenoceptor blocking drug endowed with significant natriuretic properties.", 
    "30": "To determine the optimal antihypertensive dose of bopindolol, we performed a randomized double-blind study in parallel groups. After 15 days of placebo single-blind, 115 hypertensive patients received daily for 28 days one of 4 doses: 0 mg (placebo), 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg, 2.0 mg. The reduction of supine diastolic blood pressure (BP) did not exhibit the pattern of a dose-effect relationship. The effect of 0.5 mg belonged to the plateau of the dose-effect curve (P = 0.1, analysis of variance). The reduction of heart rate (HR) followed a typical dose-effect curve, with a plateau beginning with 1 mg (P = 0.02). A trend toward an increase in the incidence of side-effects with dosage was observed (P = 0.3). Thus, the optimal antihypertensive dose may be 0.5 mg or less. Previous studies not using parallel randomized groups suggested an antihypertensive dose ranging from 2 to 4 mg. This study confirms that the dose-effect curves of beta blockers on HR and BP are dissociated. The dose-effect curve of HR seems unsuitable for assessing the optimal antihypertensive dose of a beta blocker.", 
    "31": "The pharmacokinetics of penbutolol 40 mg, its reduction in exercise-induced tachycardia, and the in vitro inhibition of radioligand binding to beta-adrenoceptors by plasma have been investigated in 7 healthy volunteers. The peak penbutolol concentration of 285 ng/ml was observed 1.2 h after administration, and the maximum of 4'-OH-penbutolol of 4.76 ng/ml was found after 1.64 h. Penbutolol was detected for up to 48 h, and 4'-OH-penbutolol dropped below the limit of detection after about 10 h. The terminal plasma concentration of penbutolol declined with an average half-life of 19 h. The maximum reduction in exercise-induced tachycardia was 33 beats/min 2.6 h after taking penbutolol. There was still a significant reduction of about 7 beats/min after 48 h. This effect could be adequately explained by the concentration-time course of penbutolol in combination with Clark's model of the concentration-effect relationship. Antagonist activity in plasma caused 91% inhibition of radioligand binding in vitro to beta 2-adrenoceptors on rat reticulocyte membranes 1.6 h after intake of penbutolol. By 48 h after intake, radioligand binding was still significantly inhibited (23%). The in vitro inhibition of radioligand binding by plasma showed a linear correlation with the reduction in exercise-induced tachycardia for all phases of the workload. The time course of the reduction in heart rate was completely explained by the in vitro inhibition of radioligand binding. However, it was not possible to explain the in vitro inhibition of radioligand binding by the concentration-time course of penbutolol using a simple competition model, although both variables were based on the same sampling site. When the in vitro inhibition of radioligand binding was plotted against the penbutolol concentration at the same sampling times (with both variables transformed to multiples of the apparent inhibition constant) the discrepancy became even more apparent as time-related counterclockwise hysteresis. None of the known metabolites of penbutolol can explain the discrepancy between the penbutolol concentration and the inhibition of radioligand binding in vitro. It appears that an other active metabolite is formed, which contributes to the effect in vitro and in vivo and so can explain the observed discrepancy.", 
    "32": "The antihypertensive effect of ketanserin 40 mg b.d. in combination with a beta-adrenergic blocking agent or a diuretic was assessed in an open study in 35 patients with essential hypertension, who had not responded to treatment with beta-blockers, diuretics or their combination. The ketanserin/beta-blocker combination decreased mean sitting systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) from 169/107 mmHg to 156/91 mmHg at the end of the 12-week active treatment period. The decrease in systolic blood pressure was significant only at Week 8, while the decrease in diastolic blood pressure was highly significant at all times. A significant reduction in heart rate by 10 beats.min-1 was observed with the ketanserin + beta-blocker combination. The ketanserin/diuretic combination led to a significant reduction in mean SBP/DBP from 164/106 mmHg to 146/92 mmHg after 12 weeks, with no significant change in heart rate. Body weight slightly increased in both groups. There were significantly fewer adverse reactions with the ketanserin/diuretic combination than with the ketanserin/beta-blocker combination. The results indicate a potentially useful therapeutic role for ketanserin in combination with beta-blockers or diuretics.", 
    "33": "Forty patients with chronic open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension participated in this randomized double-masked clinical trial. The patients instilled either 0.5% Levobunolol or 0.5% Timolol into each eye twice daily for three months. Levobunolol produced an overall decrease in mean intraocular pressure of approximately 7 mmHg, while Timolol produced an overall decrease of approximately 5 mmHg but no significant difference has been proved. Intraocular pressure was inadequately controlled in five patients in each treatment group. Both drugs caused heart rate decreases that were judged to be of limited clinical significance. Levobunolol was found to be as safe and effective as Timolol for the treatment of patients with open-angle glaucoma as for those with chronic ocular hypertension.", 
    "34": "The synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of a number of symmetrical bivalent ligand type beta-adrenolytics related to practolol are reported. The best results have been observed with N,N'-bis[3-[2-hydroxy-3-[1-methylethyl)amino]propoxy]phenyl] ethanediamide.", 
    "35": "Male Sprague-Dawley rats deprived of food for 18 h were injected with the 5-HT agonists RU 24969, 1-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazine (mCPP) or 1-[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)]piperazine (TFMPP) and 20 min later presented with their normal diet. Food intake was determined 1, 2 and 4 h later. All three drugs reduced intake over 1 and 2 h. Three out of four drugs with high affinity for 5-HT1C receptors (metergoline, mianserin, and mesulergine but not cyproheptadine) opposed hypophagia caused by mCPP. Another drug reported to have high affinity for the 5-HT1C site, 1-naphthyl-piperazine (1-NP), also blocked the hypophagic response to mCPP at doses which attenuated mCPP-induced hypolocomotion. Only one of the above drugs (metergoline) which also has high affinity for other 5-HT sites opposed hypophagia caused by RU 24969. Two out of three 5-HT1B receptor antagonists [(+/-) cyanopindolol, (-) propranolol, but not (-) pindolol)] which oppose hypophagia caused by RU 24969 (Kennett et al. 1987) also opposed hypophagia caused by mCPP. The 5-HT2 antagonists ketanserin and ritanserin, the 5-HT3 antagonist ICS 205-930 and the alpha 2 adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan did not oppose the hypophagic effect of mCPP. In agreement with results for mCPP, hypophagia caused by TFMPP was opposed by both, mianserin and (+/-) cyanopindolol. Given alone, mianserin 1-NP and cyproheptadine but not ICS 205-930 increased food consumption of normally fed rats. The results suggest that RU 24969-induced hypophagia depends on 5-HT1B receptors but not on 5-HT1C receptors, while mCPP (and TFMPP)-induced hypophagia may depend on both receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "36": "Rats were trained to discriminate phencyclidine (PCP) from saline at doses of 2 and 4 mg/kg, using a two-lever food reinforced operant technique. +/- N-allylnormetazocine (+/- SKF 10047), +5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[A,D]cyclohepten-5,10-imine MK 801), 3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl) propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP) and ifenprodil, which have been shown to antagonise the effects of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), were tested for their ability to give rise to PCP-appropriate responding. In rats trained at both doses of PCP, +/- SKF 10047 (2-12 mg/kg) and MK 801 (0.0125-0.2 mg/kg) produced dose-related responding on the lever associated with PCP injection. The relative potency of these two compounds was the same in the two groups of animals, but their absolute potencies to produce a PCP-like discriminative stimulus were dependent on the training dose of PCP. In contrast, neither the competitive NMDA antagonist CPP (4-20 mg/kg) nor the non-competitive antagonist ifenprodil (2-12 mg/kg) produced PCP-appropriate responding and ifenprodil (4 mg/kg) neither potentiated nor antagonised PCP. These findings are discussed in the light of the hypothesis that the behavioural effects of PCP are mediated via a reduction of neurotransmission at the NMDA-subtype of glutamate receptors.", 
    "37": "Purposeless chewing in rats was induced by the acute administration of the cholinergic agonist pilocarpine or by physostigmine. Pilocarpine-induced chewing was antagonised by the centrally acting anticholinergic drugs scopolamine, benzhexol and secoverine, but not by the peripherally acting anticholinergic drug methylscopolamine. Both benzhexol and secoverine caused dose-dependent inhibition of pilocarpine-induced chewing. The D-2 antagonist sulpiride and the D-1 antagonist SCH 23390 did not inhibit pilocarpine-induced chewing. The non-selective neuroleptics pimozide, trifluoperazine and thioridazine also were inactive. In contrast, clozapine caused a dose-related inhibition of pilocarpine-induced chewing. The alpha-1 antagonist prazosin, the alpha-2 antagonist idazoxan, the beta-antagonists propranolol and metoprolol and the H-1 antagonist mepyramine did not reduce pilocarpine-induced chewing. Purposeless chewing behaviour induced by pilocarpine was reduced in a dose-related manner by the administration of the 5-HT antagonists methiothepin and mianserin, but not by spiperone or ketanserin. These data confirm that pilocarpine-induced chewing behaviour in the rat is a model of central cholinergic activity, but suggest that a serotonergic component may be involved in the mediation of this behaviour.", 
    "38": "We conducted a randomized, double-blind clinical trial of propranolol versus placebo as a single treatment of neuroleptic-induced akathisia in eleven schizophrenic patients. Neither propranolol nor placebo treated patients showed a significant improvement in akathisia. While propranolol may be useful as an adjunct to anticholinergic medication in the treatment of neuroleptic-induced akathisia, propranolol does not appear to be effective within 48 hours as a primary treatment in a select group of schizophrenic patients.", 
    "39": "The role of the adrenergic system in the duodenal mechanisms that inhibit gastric acid secretion (GAS) after duodenal acidification (DA) was studied. In 12 mongrel dogs, with gastric and duodenal fistulas, six experiments were carried out evaluating pentagastrin-stimulated GAS and serum secretin levels: DA (HCl 2 ml/min) for 1 h (group A); DA (HCl 2 ml/min) for 1 h plus propranolol (group B); DA (HCl 2 ml/min) for 1 h plus phentolamine (group C); duodenal instillation of saline (2 ml/min) for 1 h (group D); (duodenal instillation of saline (2 ml/min) for 1 h plus propranolol (group E), and duodenal instillation of saline (2 ml/min) for 1 h plus phentolamine (group F). Significantly (p less than 0.05) high percentages of inhibition of GAS (49-70.5%) paralleled with increases of serum secretin levels (48.4-84%) were noted in group A and C experiments. However, DA did not inhibit GAS nor did it increase the levels of secretin in group B and D-F experiments. It is concluded that the inhibition of GAS after DA is controlled, at least in part, by the action of the beta-adrenoreceptors.", 
    "40": "Sympathetic nerve stimulation (2 min, 2 and 10 Hz) increased perfusion pressure in the blood perfused canine gracilis muscle in situ after pretreatment with atropine, desipramine and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. This vasoconstriction was accompanied by clear-cut increases in the overflow of endogenous noradrenaline (NA) at both frequencies and, at 10 Hz but not at 2 Hz, also of neuropeptide Y-like immunoreactivity (NPY-LI). The irreversible alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phenoxybenzamine enhanced the nerve stimulation induced overflows of NA and NPY-LI five- to eightfold and threefold, respectively. The fractional overflows of NA and NPY-LI per nerve impulse were similar in response to the high-frequency stimulation, indicating equimolar release in relation to the tissue contents of the respective neurotransmitter. The maximal vasoconstrictor response elicited by 10 Hz was reduced by about 50% following a dose of phenoxybenzamine which abolished the effect of exogenous NA and the remaining response was more long-lasting. Local i.a. infusion of NPY evoked long-lasting vasoconstriction in the presence of phenoxybenzamine, while the stable adenosine 5(1)-triphosphate (ATP) analogue alpha-beta-methylene ATP was without vascular effects. Locally infused NPY reduced the nerve stimulation evoked NA overflow by 31% (P less than 0.01) at 1 microM in arterial plasma, suggesting prejunctional inhibition of NA release. In conclusion, NPY-LI is released from the canine gracilis muscle upon sympathetic nerve stimulation at high frequencies. There is nerve stimulation evoked vasoconstriction, which is resistant to alpha-adrenoceptor blockade. This may in part be mediated by NPY released together with NA from the sympathetic vascular nerves.", 
    "41": "Previous pharmacological investigations of a newly synthetized derivative of 2-aminotetraline: trans-2-isopropylamino-3-hydroxy-5,8-dimethoxy 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene (3b) have shown it to possess a beta-adrenergic blocking activity. In the present work we studied the influence of 3b on some biochemical indices characteristic of beta-adrenergic stimulation: blood levels of glucose, lactate and FFA in cats and rats, and phosphorylase \"a\" activity in rat myocardium. The dose used (0.5 mg/kg) in rats was the same as the dose of propranolol (0.5 mg/kg). In all experiments on cats and rats compound 3b decreased the effects of isoproterenol on the blood levels of glucose, lactate and FFA and on the phosphorylase \"a\" activity of the myocardium and this action was comparable with that of propranolol. The similar molecular mass and LD50 of 3b and propranolol allowed quantitative comparisons of the beta-adrenoblocking effects of both drugs in the dose used. The results suggest that compound 3b possesses metabolic effects characteristic of beta-adrenoblocking agents.", 
    "42": "The experiments were carried out on dogs with chronically implanted bipolar ball-shaped silver electrodes in the antral part of the stomach and duodenum. The effect of bombesin (injected intravenously in a dose of 200 ng/kg) on the migrating myoelectrical complex (MMC) was examined after pretreatment with hexamethonium (10 mg/kg) or atropin (100 micrograms/kg), or alpha-antagonists (phentolamine, 2 mg/kg) and beta-antagonists (propranolol, 2 mg/kg) of the adrenergic receptors. Introduced during the second MMC phase, bombesin caused inhibition of the spike activity, accompanied by an increase of the slow potential frequency. Prolonged intensified spike activity occurred 5-10 min later. Early brief appearance of spike potentials was observed after bombesin in the presence of hexamethonium, which was not manifested on the background of atropin. After hexamethonium or atropin, however, the phase of the late activation of the spike activity did not occur and there was no change in the effect of bombesin on the frequency of the slow potential. The alpha- and beta-antagonists of the adrenergic receptors do not change the effect of bombesin on the electrical activity of the stomach and the intestines.", 
    "43": "1. Potentiation of yohimbine-induced sublethality has been largely used to predict antidepressant action. 2. Several products were tested in order to understand the mechanism of this toxicity better: an alpha-1 central stimulant (adrafinil); an alpha-2 central stimulant (clonidine); and 4 beta-blockers (propranolol, atenolol, penbutolol and metoprolol). 3. It was found that atenolol and adrafinil could not antagonize toxicity, whereas clonidine and the other 3 beta-blockers could. 4. It is suggested that a central beta-origin toxicity exists since only beta-blockers which cross the blood-brain barrier are capable of antagonizing this activity. 5. The fact that clonidine also antagonized this toxicity may be explained by the beta-antagonist action of this substance at the high doses used.", 
    "44": "The beta-adrenergic receptor binding sites on peripheral lymphocytes in children with bronchial asthma (n = 16) and seasonal allergic rhinitis (n = 8) were examined in comparison with normal controls (n = 18) by means of 124I-cyanopindolol. The number of beta-adrenergic receptors was significantly lower in the asthmatic group (858 +/- 460/lymphocyte) than in the controls (1564 +/- 983/lymphocyte). The value (1891 +/- 1502/lymphocyte in children with allergic rhinitis was slightly higher than that in healthy controls. Of the 24 patients suffering from allergic diseases of the lower or upper airways, the bronchial histamine provocation test was performed in 21; 16 gave positive results, while 5 were negative. No difference in beta-adrenergic receptor count was found between the histamine-positive and negative patients. Neither was there any correlation between the number of beta-adrenergic receptors and the high (16/24) and low (8/24) serum IgE concentrations found in allergic patients. The significant decrease in beta-adrenergic receptor count in asthmatic children lends support to Szentiv\u00e1nyi's concept. Further qualitative and quantitative analysis of lymphocyte beta-adrenergic receptors may provide an individual approach to the treatment of bronchial asthma with beta-sympathomimetic drugs.", 
    "45": "The characteristics of the beta-adrenoceptor population mediating the actions of noradrenaline and isoproterenol in the rat portal vein were examined in comparison with those in the rat atria. In the portal vein, the pA2 values obtained for the selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist betaxolol were 100-fold lower than those obtained in the atria, suggesting that in the rat portal vein a population of beta 2-adrenoceptors is highly predominant.", 
    "46": "With hindsight it is now possible to define some of the additional pharmacological characteristics which enhance the pharmacodynamic and therapeutic efficacy of a drug whose primary purpose is to antagonize competitively sympathetic stimulation of the heart. The ideal pharmacokinetic profile for a beta-blocker includes ready and unimpeded absorption; a predominantly hydrophilic distribution; a relatively long duration of pharmacological activity and alternative routes of elimination. The ideal pharmacodynamic activity of such a drug involves a number of factors, including the essential element of beta 1-adrenoceptor selectivity. In addition, moderate beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist activity and mild stimulation of myocardial contractibility afford enhanced haemodynamic efficacy. The intrinsic ability to relax vascular and bronchial smooth muscle are also highly desirable ancillary pharmacodynamic properties. From the therapeutic aspect, a drug administered with the primary objective of reducing myocardial ischaemia in patients with a coronary heart disease, or of lowering blood pressure in patients with hypertension, should not only prove effective in clinical practice, but should also be shown to have beneficial haemodynamic properties and a minimum of undesirable pharmacological effects. The unique pharmacological profile of celiprolol appears to allow fulfillment of many of these desirable objectives.", 
    "47": "Muscular exercise is the most common stress imposed on the cardiovascular system and, in hypertensive patients, it causes an exaggerated increase in the already elevated blood pressure. The evaluation of any antihypertensive drug must, therefore, include an investigation of its effects on the haemodynamic response to exercise. For this reason the effects of celiprolol and enalapril were studied in hypertensive patients, both at rest and during an exercise stress test performed on a bicycle ergometer. The haemodynamic changes observed were very similar at rest: both drugs consistently reduced blood pressure without impairing either myocardial geometry or function. The only between drug difference found at rest was slight bradycardia with celiprolol, whereas heart rate was unaffected by enalapril. By contrast, there was a marked difference in the effect on the blood pressure increase caused by muscular exercise: 24 h after dosing, celiprolol continued to attenuate the hypertensive response to exercise while enalapril failed to show any significant antihypertensive effect possibly because after this time there was a reduction in angiotensin converting enzyme inhibiting activity. Thus, celiprolol and enalapril are both effective once-a-day antihypertensive agents, but celiprolol provides a longer lasting protection from hypertensive peaks caused by exercise.", 
    "48": "The antihypertensive efficacy of a new beta-blocker, celiprolol, was compared with that of a well established antihypertensive drug, metoprolol. Systemic and forearm haemodynamic effects were investigated using echocardiography and two-dimensional pulsed Doppler flowmetry, respectively. Twenty hypertensive patients completed the double-blind crossover randomized study. Each 6-week active treatment period was both preceded and followed by 2 weeks of placebo treatment such that the total duration of the study was 18 weeks. Despite comparable efficacy in reducing systolic and diastolic blood pressures by approximately 10% of the basal value, the two drugs differed in their systemic and haemodynamic effects. Celiprolol significantly decreased forearm peripheral resistance and total peripheral resistance. Cardiac output remained unchanged and forearm blood flow was increased. Metoprolol reduced cardiac output through a reduction in heart rate, but stroke volume was unaltered. Neither drug significantly modified cardiac performance, as evaluated by left ventricular circumferential fibre shortening and left ventricular ejection fraction. Differences in the systemic and regional haemodynamic effects of the two drugs could account for the different blood pressure response seen in some patients. There was no observable change in left ventricular wall thickness or left ventricular mass. These results confirm previous reports which demonstrate that antihypertensive treatment with beta-blockers does not reduce left ventricular mass in patients with a left ventricle of normal size. It is generally accepted, however, that the ability of beta-blockers to reverse left ventricular hypertrophy is unrelated to the individual pharmacological characteristics of each agent.", 
    "49": "Celiprolol, 400 mg once daily, and atenolol, 100 mg once daily, were compared in a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study of 16 patients with stable angina. Both drugs reduced angina frequency and delayed the onset of ischaemia during exercise, although only celiprolol prolonged exercise time. Celiprolol produced less suppression of heart rate than atenolol during exercise, and atenolol, but not celiprolol, lowered resting and exercise cardiac output. Thus, the ancillary properties of celiprolol, including partial beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist activity and direct vasodilating activity, have detectable effects on cardiac function that may be beneficial in patients with angina.", 
    "50": "Many beta-blockers adversely affect serum lipid levels. We have, therefore, monitored blood pressure and serum lipids in 22 patients (mean age: 42.5 years) with essential hypertension (WHO stages I-II) who were treated with celiprolol for 4 weeks, and in 12 patients (mean age: 39.8 years) with essential hypertension (WHO stages I-II) who received celiprolol for 12 months. Standing blood pressure was significantly reduced after 4 weeks and 12 months of treatment, and there were slight decreases in serum cholesterol. In addition, serum triglyceride levels decreased significantly after 4 weeks, and there was a smaller decrease in the patients treated for 12 months. The pathologically elevated pre-treatment lipid values were, therefore, reduced to levels within the normal range. Analysis by lipid electrophoresis showed an increase in the high density lipoprotein (HDL) fraction and a decrease in both the low density lipoprotein (LDL) fraction and the LDL/HDL ratio. During the long-term study there was also a significant reduction in serum fibrinogen. Our results show that celiprolol does not adversely alter serum lipids, and it may even have a beneficial effect on these variables.", 
    "51": "The results of an extensive pre-clinical and clinical research programme indicate that celiprolol is a safe and effective treatment for both hypertension and angina pectoris. Celiprolol is well absorbed, is largely unmetabolized, and is excreted equally in the urine and bile. As a result of this pharmacokinetic profile celiprolol can be safely administered to the elderly and to patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Haemodynamic studies indicate that celiprolol lowers arterial blood pressure, and decreases both renal vascular resistance and peripheral vascular resistance. Celiprolol does not depress myocardial function, neither does it induce bronchoconstriction in asthmatic patients. Weak alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonism, combined with beta 2-adrenoceptor agonism are thought to contribute to these properties. The antihypertensive efficacy of celiprolol, 200 mg/day, is comparable to that of propranolol, atenolol and nadolol. Moreover, the actions of celiprolol last for 24 h, and are accompanied by less resting bradycardia than that seen with other beta-blockers. The anti-anginal efficacy of celiprolol is similar to that of atenolol, propranolol and metoprolol. In addition, celiprolol decreases the ventricular rate in patients with atrial tachyarrhythmias. This effect results from its ability to slow atrioventricular conduction. Celiprolol is generally very well tolerated.", 
    "52": "The effects of oral dilevalol (an R, R-isomer of labetalol), a new beta-adrenoceptor blocker with beta 2-receptor stimulating and alpha-recepter blocking properties on blood pressure, renal function, plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone have been studied in 15 patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension treated with it for 6 weeks. Two patients with apparent treatment failure and one patient who developed muscle pain and cramps, and had an elevated creatine phosphokinase level, were excluded from the study. Dilevalol monotherapy 100 mg once daily for 6 weeks significantly lowered both the systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared to placebo. Total renal vascular resistance was significantly reduced, and RBF and GFR remained unchanged. Dilevalol significantly decreased PRA. The results suggest that prolonged daily treatment with dilevalol preserves renal function and produces a concomitant hypotensive action in patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. The ancillary pharmacological properties of dilevalol rather than PRA suppression may be relevant to its renal effects.", 
    "53": "The effects of three different types of beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents on platelet aggregation and on platelet and plasma cyclic AMP content have been studied in 14 patients with mild hypertension given each drug in turn for two weeks. The drugs were a non-selective blocking agent with high intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, pindolol, the nonspecific blocking agent propranolol, and the beta 1-selective metoprolol. The threshold values of ADP and adrenaline for irreversible platelet aggregation were significantly higher for pindolol and metoprolol than for propranolol. The cyclic AMP content of platelets was higher during pindolol and metoprolol than during propranolol treatment. Pindolol produced a substantial increase in plasma cyclic AMP relative to the other two drugs. Thus, platelet aggregation and cyclic AMP formation are influenced by beta-adrenoceptor blockade in proportion to intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and affinity for different beta-adrenoceptor subtypes.", 
    "54": "The effects of beta-blocking propranolol, metoprolol, atenolol and labetalol on the production of the proaggregatory and vasoconstrictive thromboxane A2 (TxA2) by fetal platelets were studied. To this end, umbilical blood samples were allowed to clot in the absence or presence of various concentrations of these agents, and the release of TxB2 (a metabolite of TxA2) was measured. Propranolol and labetalol inhibited TxA2 production in 0.1-mmol concentrations and metoprolol and atenolol in 1-mmol concentrations. The required concentration was always higher than could be achieved by peroral treatment. Beta blockers may have this effect through phospholipase A2 because the conversion of exogenous arachidonic acid to TxB2 was not affected except in the case of propranolol, which inhibited slightly TxB2 formation from exogenous arachidonic acid.", 
    "55": "Circulatory effects of bopindolol, a new nonselective beta blocking agent with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and atenolol were compared. After baseline and first dose measurements atenolol 25 mg twice daily and bopindolol 1 mg daily were given to 10 healthy young subjects. Haemodynamic measurements were made noninvasively using echocardiography and systolic time intervals. Clinical and circulatory indices were measured at baseline, after initial dose and after one week of regular treatment at rest and at isometric handgrip exercise (IE) (HG). Atenol reduced the heart rate from 62 bpm to 49 and blunted totally the HR increase during IE (p less than 0.01). Bopindolol caused a 10% fall in heart rate (NS) at rest and a 15% fall (p less than 0.05) during IE. BP fell by 6% after atenol administration and 4% after bopindolol (NS) at rest and similarly during IE. In contrast to bopindolol, atenolol caused small increases initially in left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVEDD) and left ventricular end-systolic dimension (LVESD). A 10% increase in FS was seen at rest after bopindolol administration (NS). With the fall in heart rate the estimated cardiac output (CO) also fell from 3.66 to 3.151/min (P less than 0.05) after atenolol but rose from 3.87 to 3.93 after bopindolol (NS) during chronic treatment. Consecutively the total peripheral resistance (TPR) was increased to some extent by atenolol, whereas bopindolol reduced it at rest and during IE. A similar response was also found in systolic time intervals PEP/LVET which were reduced during bopindolol administration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "56": "Clinically significant differences between various beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs exist. Patients with ischaemic heart disease and exertional angina pectoris benefit from all types of beta-blockers. Drugs with intrinsic sympathomimetic action (ISA) given intravenously may be safer in some patients with acute myocardial infarction than those drugs without ISA. In cardiac patients at rest they may have a vasodilator action and cause less myocardial depression than beta-blockers without ISA. When, however, the cardiac sympathetic tone is high pindolol and other beta-blockers with ISA act as any other beta-blockers, producing haemodynamic impairment. Studies have shown that beta-blockers with ISA confer less benefit in secondary prevention after myocardial infarction and they are not suitable for the treatment of obstructive cardiomyopathy. Non-selective beta-blockers may be advantageous in hypokalaemic arrhythmias. Beta 1-blockers may be preferred for patients with bronchoconstriction, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease and, theoretically to some extent in theory also in patients with hypertension. The extent and nature of side effects may also influence the selection of the most suitable beta-blocker in cardiovascular therapy.", 
    "57": "The treatment of childhood asthma should be considered with respect to age, severity and aetiology. Treatment should be instituted early from the first crisis in order to avoid progression to a more severe form. It consists of two aspects: the treatment of the acute episode and the chronic treatment. The treatment of the acute episode consists of using bronchodilators (BD) (rapid release Theophylline and/or beta agonists) to which one might add corticosteroids if the crisis lasts for more than a few hours or seems severe at the outset, an antibiotic should also be used as infection is often a trigger factor in infants. Maintenance treatment is necessary in asthmatics with frequent exacerbations. It should be tailored to the symptomatology and aetiology. The symptomatic treatment consists of a bronchodilator (slow release Theophylline or an atropine-like pharmacological derivative) to which one may add, in severe cases, corticosteroids which may be in the form of aerosol, or as rarely as possible by mouth. The second aspect of treatment relating to the aetiology is the most difficult to apply as childhood asthma is often multi-factorial: in allergic asthma the avoidance of allergens, disodium cromoglycate, ketotifen, and if necessary specific desensitization. In non-allergic asthma, physiotherapy, treatment of infectious foci, particularly ENT (ORL), and attention to psychosomatic features. When asthma is diagnosed and treated early the prognosis is transformed and progress towards chronicity is avoided.", 
    "58": "Evidence supporting the efficacy of beta blockers in anxiety is reviewed. Propranolol and oxprenolol are the most clearly established in efficacy. A placebo-controlled trial is described, in which propranolol and atenolol were both effective in the symptomatic treatment of generalized anxiety in patients who had been referred by their family doctors for specialist treatment. If initial psychological treatment for chronic anxiety is ineffective, and a drug is considered necessary, then a beta blocker or an antidepressant should be considered as first choice in preference to a benzodiazepine.", 
    "59": "Forty four subjects were treated for benzodiazepine dependence. The withdrawal programme lasted for 10 weeks and included regular group support sessions. Patients were also treated with either propranolol, placebo or \"no pill\" under double blind conditions. Twenty three patients complied with the full treatment regimen and completed the trial. The outcome of treatment was moderately successful, with 8 out of the 23 patients stopping their tranquilizers and a further 11 achieving a reduction of 50% or more of their original benzodiazepine dose. Tranquilizer dependence is a difficult condition to treat, but preliminary results suggest that propranolol is helpful in reducing the symptoms of benzodiazepine withdrawal.", 
    "60": "The Stress Clinic has been established for the systematic investigation and quantification of various stress factors that may produce adverse effects on health. Nine areas are investigated: social habits, social relationships, life events, psychiatric, sexual, sleep, geriatric, menstrual, and stress and the heart. The degree of stress in each area is quantified and a Stress Profile constructed for each patient. The Stress Profile can then be used to determine in which areas stress is most important and appropriate treatment can then be prescribed. In a preliminary analysis, the commonest principal diagnosis was depression (47%), followed by anxiety (27%), whilst in 18% the main stress was insomnia and in three patients an organic illness (7%). The Stress Profile is also used to assess improvement and significant reduction in many of the main stress areas has been demonstrated, coincident with response to treatment. In particular, we have been using centrally acting beta-blocking drugs in the treatment of anxiety and panic attacks with similar results.", 
    "61": "1. The effect of the adrenergic blockers prazosin and atenolol were tested in hypercholesterolemic G\u00f6ttingen minipigs. 2. After 1 yr there was a significant reduction of plasma triglycerides and total cholesterol in the medicated animals as compared to untreated ones. 3. No significant difference in atherosclerotic lesions was observed.", 
    "62": "Extracellular recordings from raphe dorsalis neurons in rats during development were performed, and the response to iontophoretically applied beta-antagonists was analysed. In pups younger than 2 weeks, raphe dorsalis firing was totally or partially inhibited by application of beta-antagonists, while after 2 weeks of age the neurons were insensitive to the same application. The beta-receptors appeared to be involved in the control of raphe firing during a transient period of ontogenesis and thus the disappearance of beta-regulation at older ages may reflect the regression of this population of neurotransmitter receptors.", 
    "63": "Buspirone, a drug with high affinity for serotonin1A receptors, was studied for its ability to reduce rats' immobility in the forced swimming test when injected systemically or into the nucleus raphe dorsalis (DR). Between 0.1 and 10 mg/kg buspirone had no effect on rats' immobility when injected systemically as a single dose or as a 3-injection course during 24 hours. Direct injection of 1 and 5 mu/0.5 microliter buspirone in the DR significantly reduced the duration of immobility without changing rats' activity in an open field. The anti-immobility effect of 1 microgram/0.5 microliter buspirone in the DR was completely prevented by injecting 2.5 micrograms (-)-propranolol in the same area. Oral administration of 0.3-1.0 mg/kg 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)piperazine (1-PP), one of the main metabolites of buspirone, and 0.3-3.0 mg/kg s.c. idazoxan, two substances with alpha 2 adrenergic blocking properties, completely antagonized the effect of 0.25 mg/kg s.c. 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)-tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), an agent with selective affinity for serotonin1A receptors. The anti-immobility effect of an infusion of 1 microgram/0.5 microliter buspirone or 8-OH-DPAT in the DR was also antagonized by 1 mg/kg p.o. 1-PP. The results suggest that buspirone possesses potential antidepressant properties but its effects may be masked in certain tests by its metabolite, 1PP, through its alpha 2 adrenergic blocking activity.", 
    "64": "beta-adrenoceptors in the porcine coronary artery were characterized by a radioligand binding assay using (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol (DHA) and also by measuring the relaxant response of isolated coronary artery to norepinephrine. Specific (-)-[3H]DHA binding in the porcine coronary artery was saturable, reversible and of high affinity (Kd = 1.6 nM) with a maximal number of binding sites of 63 fmol/mg protein, and it showed a pharmacological specificity as well as stereoselectivity which characterized beta-adrenoceptors. The Hofstee analysis of inhibition of (-)-[3H]DHA binding by atenolol, practolol and ICI 118551 has shown that the averaged concentration of beta 1 and beta 2-adrenoceptors in this tissue was 68% and 32% respectively. The relaxant response of isolated coronary artery to norepinephrine was competitively antagonized by (-)propranolol, (+)propranolol, atenolol, practolol and ICI 118551. The pA2 values of these adrenoceptor antagonists were significantly correlated with the Ki values for beta 1 but not beta 2-adrenoceptors determined by the (-)-[3H]DHA binding assay. Thus, the present study demonstrates that the relaxant response of porcine coronary artery to norepinephrine is predominantly mediated through the stimulation of beta 1-adrenoceptors on vascular smooth muscles.", 
    "65": "Previous pharmacological characterization of central noradrenergic receptors has been interpreted as favoring beta-type receptors on cerebellar Purkinje neurons and hippocampal pyramidal neurons. However, the recent development of additional noradrenergic antagonists suitable for single neuron analysis, prompted an initial re-evaluation of alpha and beta adrenergic receptors in these two cell populations. In contrast with earlier data based on local antagonism of iontophoretric or synaptically released norepinephrine (NE), we now find that systemic phenoxybenzamine, the alpha antagonist, was effective in blocking responses to NE in cerebellum and hippocampus, whereas systemic beta antagonists metoprolol, ICI 118.551 [correction of ICI 181.551], or proprandol did not interfere with local NE responses at systemic doses that altered spontaneous discharge rates. These preliminary data suggest that a more complete re-evaluation of the nature of central noradrenergic response mechanisms may be warranted.", 
    "66": "The effect of verapamil (240 mg) on exercise capacity was studied during a short graded and a single-level endurance exercise test in 12 normal volunteers; it was compared to the effects of atenolol (100 mg x day-1). Intake of verapamil, atenolol and placebo, administered according to a randomized, double-blind cross-over design, was started 3 days before the exercise tests. Compared to placebo, verapamil did not affect peak oxygen uptake in the graded test or exercise duration in the endurance test. Heart rate, systolic blood pressure, rating of perceived exertion and respiratory data at submaximal and peak exercise were unaffected in either test. On the other hand atenolol reduced maximal oxygen uptake by 5% (p less than 0.001) and endurance exercise duration by 17% (p less than 0.05). Besides marked decreases in heart rate and systolic blood pressure during the two types of exercise, atenolol also reduced oxygen uptake at submaximal exercise levels and it increased the rating of perceived exertion (p less than 0.05), the latter only during the endurance exercise test.", 
    "67": "The effect of prolonged exercise on the glycogen level in the respiratory muscles (diaphragm--D, external intercostal--IE and internal--II) has been studied in four groups of rats: 1-control, 2-fasted for 24 h, 3-treated with nicotinic acid and 4-treated with propranolol. There was a sharp reduction in glycogen level in each muscle after 30 min exercise in the control and fasted groups. Exercise till exhaustion further lowered the glycogen level in D in the control group and in IE and II in the fasted group. In the fasted group, the level of glycogen in each muscle, at rest, and after 30 min exercise, and in IE and II muscles after exercise till exhaustion was lower than in the control group. Nicotinic acid did not affect the glycogen level either at rest or during exercise as compared with the control group. Propranolol increased the glycogen level in the muscles at rest and during 30 min exercise. It partially prevented glycogen mobilization in D and IE and fully in II during exercise till exhaustion. In the control group, 24 and 48 h after exercise till exhaustion, the level of glycogen in each muscle exceeded the resting control value. It is concluded that exercise-induced glycogen metabolism in the respiratory muscles differs in some respects from that in the limb or heart muscles.", 
    "68": "1. The abilities of two indole agonists and some nonindole agonists to induce relaxation of catch contraction and the influence of the agonists on cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels in the anterior byssus retractor muscle (ABRM) of Mytilus were investigated. 2. 5-MeOT (5-methoxytryptamine) and 5-MeODMT (5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine) dose-dependently relaxed the contraction. 3. TFMPP (m-trifluoromethylphenyl piperazine), PAPP (p-amino-phenyl TFMPP) and mCPP (1-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazine dose-dependently relaxed the contraction, but 2MPP (1-(2-methylphenyl) piperazine and quipazine did not. 4. 5-MeOT (10(-6)M), 5-MeODMT (10(-6)M), TFMPP (10(-4)M), 2MPP (10(-4)M), quipazine (10(-4)M) and 8-OH-DPAT (3 x 10(-5) M) significantly reduced the cAMP levels, but PAPP (3 x 10(-4)M) and mCPP (10(-4)M) did not have any effect on cAMP levels. 5. These findings indicate that the pharmacological properties of 5-HT1-like receptors in the ABRM are similar to those of 5-HT1A receptors in mammalian tissues, and that the changes in cAMP levels induced by the agonists used are unlikely to be directly linked to the relaxation induced by them.", 
    "69": "1. Exogenous dopamine (DA), octopamine (OA), noradrenaline (NA), and the alpha 1-agonist methoxamine (MX), all induce tonic and rhythmic contractions in the rat vas deferens. 2. Tonic and rhythmic contractions can be separated by use of different concentrations of alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists, verapamil, pyrogallol (a COMT-inhibitor) and lowering bath temperature (greater than 20 degrees C). 3. The two types of contraction could not be distinguished by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, cocaine (uptake 1 blocker) or metanephrine (uptake 2 blocker). 4. It is suggested that the tonic and rhythmic contractions induced by amines are mediated by different alpha-adrenoceptors.", 
    "70": "Good clinical control of hypertension is achieved with low doses of the potent beta-blocker bopindolol. Pharmacokinetic evaluations therefore require an analytical technique of high sensitivity. Analysis of plasma by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using electrochemical detection provides this sensitivity. This article describes the development of an analytical procedure and presents a reversed-phase HPLC method with coulometric detection suitable for plasma analyses during pharmacokinetic investigations of bopindolol therapy.", 
    "71": "In an attempt to elucidate whether antiglaucomatous drugs, especially beta-blockers, affect systemic and/or ocular blood flow, we measured ocular perfusion pressures (PP), systemic blood pressure (BP) and heart rate in 50 healthy subjects before and after topical instillation of the following eye drops: timolol 0.5% (n = 10), betaxolol 0.5% (n = 10), carteolol 2% (n = 10), pilocarpine 2% (n = 10) and acetazolamide 750 mg per os (n = 10). The ocular perfusion pressures were measured by OODG as described by Ulrich. By means of this method--retinal and ciliary perfusion pressure can be recorded separately and simultaneously. Our results indicated that, in spite of a statistically significant decrease in IOP in all 5 groups, there was no change in retinal or ciliary perfusion pressure, heart rate or blood pressure in any of the groups except the carteolol subjects. The ocular perfusion pressures should be increased with reduction of the IOP when the systemic parameters remain unchanged. This was not the case in our experiments and therefore it can be suggested that a relative reduction in ocular perfusion pressure occurs with all agents and, in this respect, timolol and betaxolol did not affect ocular perfusion pressure more than pilocarpine and acetazolamide. Carteolol, however, produced a slight decrease (alpha less than 0.02) in ocular perfusion pressure, in spite of lowering of the IOP.", 
    "72": "1. Ovine TSH stimulated an increase in plasma T4 levels in brook charr, but plasma T3 levels, hepatic T3 content and hepatic T4-monodeiodination to T3 were unaffected. TSH-induced plasma T4 levels were further enhanced in propranolol-pretreated fish. 2. Fish treated with ovine prolactin + TSH had elevated plasma T3 levels, hepatic T3 content and hepatic T4-monodeiodination rates compared with TSH-treated animals. Propranolol-pretreatment further enhanced hepatic T4-monodeiodination in these fish. 3. Propranolol, a beta-adrenoceptor blocker, appears to enhance peripheral T4 to T3 conversion in physiological situations when plasma thyroid hormone levels and T4-monodeiodination rates are high.", 
    "73": "Antireceptor antibodies have been developed as a probe to study the cellular receptor for reovirus type 3. Using this probe, a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 65-67 kilodaltons and a pI of 5.8-6.0 was isolated and identified as the reovirus receptor. This protein was also structurally similar to the affinity-purified beta-adrenergic receptor from calf lung. In this report, we employ [125I]-iodocyanopindolol, a high affinity beta-adrenergic antagonist, to further characterize this protein. We show that R1.1, a murine thymoma cell line, possesses about 2,000 receptors per cell with high affinity for ICYP (kD = 3.3 X 10(-11) M). Competitive inhibition studies suggest that the receptor is of the beta-2 subtype. Solubilized receptor proteins from R1.1 cells bound to the antireceptor antibody were further purified by SDS-PAGE and electroelution from the gel. Five percent of the proteins thus obtained could bind ICYP with high affinity (kD = 1.6 X 10(-10) M). This suggests that the purification procedure produced a collection of forms of this 65- to 67-kilodalton protein, some of which retained the conformation for binding the beta ligands. We also demonstrate that the isolated receptor protein was able to bind ICYP even when the virus binding site was occupied by the anti-idiotype, suggesting that reovirus type 3 and the beta ligands bind to distinct domains on the receptor protein.", 
    "74": "In an attempt to determine whether the excitatory and inhibitory orthodromic responses of single medial preoptic-medial septal (MPO-S) neurons to discrete electrical stimulation of the A1 noradrenergic region were mediated specifically by norepinephrine (NE) and involved different types of adrenoreceptors, a series of electrophysiological and neuropharmacological experiments was conducted. Extracellular single unit recording and local drug application techniques were used in female rats under urethane anesthesia. Chemical lesion of the catecholaminergic nerve terminal plexus in the medial preoptic area with 6-hydroxydopamine abolished both excitatory and inhibitory orthodromic effects of A1 region stimulation on MPO-S neurons, suggesting the noradrenergic nature of the effects. This conclusion was corroborated by the observation that the orthodromic effects were mimicked by locally applied exogenous NE. The excitatory effects were reliably mimicked by a low concentration of NE (0.5 mM; in-barrel concentration) and methoxamine (1.0 mM, an alpha-1 agonist), but not by either low or high concentrations (1 and 100 mM) of clonidine (an alpha-2 agonist) and isoproterenol (a beta agonist). The inhibitory orthodromic effects of A1 region stimulation were reliably mimicked by a high concentration of NE (50 mM), clonidine (100 mM) and isoproterenol (100 mM), but not by a low concentration of NE (0.5 mM), methoxamine (1 mM), clonidine (1 mM) or isoproterenol (1 mM). A high concentration (100 mM) of methoxamine mimicked the inhibitory effects less than 40% of the time. The low concentration (0.5 mM) NE-induced excitation that matched the excitatory orthodromic effect of A1 region stimulation was blocked by phentolamine (100 mM), an alpha blocker, but not by timolol (100 mM), a beta blocker. On the other hand, the high concentration (50 mM) NE-induced inhibition that matched the inhibitory orthodromic effect of A1 region stimulation was blocked by timolol, but not by phentolamine. Taken together, the present results are consistent with the hypotheses that the ascending noradrenergic projections from the A1 region affect the excitability of MPO-S neurons directly through NE and that the excitatory and inhibitory orthodromic effects involve different types of adrenoreceptors, i.e., alpha-1 and beta receptors, respectively.", 
    "75": "Cardiac patients are often on drugs. They invariably benefit from a rehabilitation programme where they may be seen more frequently than in a routine follow-up clinic. Rehabilitation units must keep alert for drug-induced adverse effects or symptomatic deterioration, as well as the more usual psychological and physical benefits they induce.", 
    "76": "The injection of DL-octopamine to emerging adult honey bees (1 nanomol per individual) promptly rises the haemolymph levels of steroids, diacyl and triacylglycerols (over 100% increase occurring after 10 min). Free fatty acids are then increased (by 131%) 45 mn after injections. These responses are completely abolished by 2.5 nanomol propranolol and 0.07 nanomol cyclic somatostatin. Octopamine thus seems to be more strongly involved in the lipemia than in the glycemia regulation, by contrast with noradrenaline which is, apparently, more active on carbohydrates.", 
    "77": "Beta-receptor-blocking agents are commonly used in the management of various cardiovascular diseases. Recently, esmolol, a pharmacokinetically novel cardioselective beta-receptor-blocking agent, has been introduced for use in the treatment of critically ill patients. It is devoid of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and in doses used clinically, it has no direct depressant effect on the heart. Esmolol is an ester and is metabolized by choline-esterase to ASL 8123, an inactive molecule. Esmolol has an elimination half-life of nine minutes which accounts for its ultrashort duration of action. This unique pharmacokinetic property provides two advantages over other longer-acting beta-receptor-blocking agents. First, the magnitude of beta-receptor blockade can be titrated to a desired level. Second, if adverse effects are experienced, reducing the dosage or terminating the infusion results in rapid reversal of its pharmacological effects. Another ultrashort-acting, non-cardioselective beta-receptor blocking agent, flestolol is undergoing clinical evaluation. Esmolol has been approved for the management of supraventricular tachycardia. The clinical safety of these novel drugs will expand the use of beta-receptor-blocking agents in the management of cardiovascular diseases in critically ill patients.", 
    "78": "Blood (5 to 15 ml) was infused into aorta of the anesthetized rabbit through the carotid artery or femoral artery at a constant rate (0.55 to 8.3 ml/s). The carotid sinuses were occluded. The systemic arterial pressure (SAP) began to rise immediately at the onset of the infusion and dropped gradually in most cases during the infusion. SAP continued to decline after the infusion and in many cases became lower than the preinfusion pressure. Within seconds, SAP tapered off to its lowest point and resumed a gradual rise, leveling off higher than its initial pressure. A depressor effect caused by the rapid infusion of blood into the aorta (DRIA) was observed in every rabbit. DRIA was not suppressed much by the section of aortic or vagal nerves. DRIA was markedly suppressed by the administration of alpha-adrenergic blockade, but beta-adrenergic blockade had little effect on DRIA. By using a hydraulic model of the closed circulatory system, a theoretical analysis was made on the basis of the \"theory of active fluid element,\" a theory developed by Hatakeyama, one of the authors, and it was demonstrated that DRIA must not be considered to be a passive hemodynamic phenomenon. The results obtained suggest that a nervous regulatory mechanism--rather than the reflex via the carotid sinus or aortic baroreceptors, or other mechanoreceptors--plays an important part in the venous and the cardiac regions."
