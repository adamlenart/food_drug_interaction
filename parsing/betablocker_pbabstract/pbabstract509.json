    "0": "In a randomized double-blind study, treatment with either metoprolol, nifedipine, or their combination was compared for effects on ischemic variables and heart rate obtained during ambulatory monitoring in 42 patients with chronic stable angina. All patients had severe chronic stable angina of at least 6 months' duration despite medical treatment, and exhibited coronary artery stenosis of 75% in one or more coronary arteries. Metoprolol reduced the frequency of total (p less than 0.01) and asymptomatic ischemic episodes (p less than 0.05), the duration of ischemia (p less than 0.05), and the ischemic burden (p less than 0.05), which contrasted to the lack of any similar significant effect during nifedipine monotherapy. During combination therapy, there was a tendency to further improvement, which did not reach statistical significance compared with metoprolol monotherapy. Heart rate at the onset of ischemia was reduced by metoprolol therapy (p less than 0.01), indicating that metoprolol acts by reducing myocardial oxygen demand even during ischemic episodes observed in daily life, where impairments of myocardial oxygen supply are suspected. No change in heart rate at the onset of ischemia could be detected during nifedipine monotherapy. It is concluded that metoprolol monotherapy, as well as its combination with nifedipine, effectively reduces total ischemic activity compared with placebo and nifedipine monotherapy. Control of ischemic activity in chronic stable angina may have prognostic implications.", 
    "1": "This study examined the effect of changes in plasma concentrations of total protein, albumin, alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, and free fatty acids occurring after heart operations on the protein binding of chemically basic drugs. Plasma protein and free fatty acid concentrations were measured simultaneously with in vitro determinations of the protein binding of lidocaine, quinidine, and propranolol: immediately before operation, immediately on weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass, on arrival in the recovery room, and 12, 24, 72, and 120 hours postoperatively. Initial decreases in the concentrations of all proteins were followed by a rise in alpha 1-acid glycoprotein to 254% of baseline at 72 to 120 hours. The free fractions of drug were initially increased to 168% of baseline for lidocaine, 206% for quinidine, and 200% for propranolol and fell progressively with time, reaching sustained troughs of 65% for lidocaine, 50% for quinidine, and 57% for propranolol at 72 to 120 hours. Regression analysis indicated a major influence of changing alpha 1-acid glycoprotein concentrations on free fractions of all three drugs, with a smaller effect of albumin that reached statistical significance only for lidocaine. There were no significant perioperative changes in plasma concentrations of free fatty acids when the in vitro effects of heparin were controlled. In conclusion, sequential changes in plasma protein concentrations after cardiac operations predictably alter the protein binding of lidocaine, quinidine, and propranolol and should be considered when interpreting total plasma drug concentrations.", 
    "2": "Maternal and fetal disposition of the beta adrenoceptor blocking drug, propranolol was examined in the pregnant sheep from day 95 to day 140 (term, 145 days) of gestation. Propranolol was administered to the mother (bolus dose, 1.5 mg/kg followed by an infusion of 1.2 mg/kg/hr over 3 hr) to achieve an average steady-state maternal total drug concentration of 600 ng/ml. Total steady-state maternal plasma propranolol concentration was 666 +/- 266 ng/ml, reflecting a 4-fold variation in maternal drug clearance and a 14-fold variation in binding. Neither maternal clearance nor binding showed a significant change with gestational age. Total plasma drug concentrations in the fetus increased significantly with gestational age (r = 0.58, P less than .05), due to a concomitant increase in binding (r = 0.66, P less than .01). Fetal steady-state unbound drug concentrations were 50% of those seen in the mother, indicating that the fetus is capable of irreversible elimination of the drug. This ratio did not change with gestational age, suggesting that the capacity of the fetus to eliminate propranolol does not increase detectably in the latter part of pregnancy. The significant correlation between maternal and fetal unbound drug concentrations indicates that a major determinant of fetal exposure to propranolol is the clearance of the drug by the mother.", 
    "3": "The oxidation of the beta adrenoceptor antagonist metoprolol exhibits genetic polymorphism of the sparteine/debrisoquine (SP/DB) type. The alpha-hydroxylation of metoprolol is absent in poor metabolizers, whereas metoprolol O-demethylation is only partially impaired, suggesting that an enzyme or enzymes other than cytochrome P450-SP/DB contribute to the latter reaction. Using inhibition by the quinidine/quinine isomer pair as a marker for the activity of cytochrome P450-SP/DB, the role of this enzyme in the in vitro oxidation of the enantiomers of metoprolol by human liver microsomes was examined. Unlike alpha-hydroxylation, only a portion of metoprolol O-demethylation showed the stereoselective inhibition by quinidine and quinine characteristic of in vitro reactions catalyzed by cytochrome P450-SP/DB. Furthermore, the kinetics of metoprolol O-demethylation were biphasic, the two components of O-demethylase activity being distinguishable by their enantioselectivity and sensitivity to inhibition by quinidine. Microsomes from one liver formed no detectable alpha-hydroxymetoprolol, and O-demethylation by these microsomes corresponded to the low affinity site observed in eight other livers. The rate of metoprolol O-demethylation by the quinidine-inhibitable high affinity component was directly proportional to the rate of alpha-hydroxylation. These findings support the hypothesis that cytochrome P450-SP/DB catalyzes the formation of alpha-hydroxymetoprolol, but is only partially responsible for metoprolol O-demethylation. Such a mechanism could explain the previously reported inability to detect polymorphism in the O-demethylation pathway in vivo.", 
    "4": "Eight nonsmoking subjects with asthma, nonresponsive to the bronchoconstrictive effect of oral propranolol, were studied. The airway response to increasing concentrations of histamine aerosol was assessed by measuring FEV1. The threshold provocative dose of histamine needed to cause a 20% fall in starting FEV1 (PD20) was measured by log dose-response curve. Histamine challenge was performed in duplicate after premedication with placebo or 40 mg of propranolol on separate days. The mean starting FEV1 did not change significantly after placebo and after propranolol administration. The mean PD20 values after propranolol (0.37 mg/ml and 0.32 mg/ml, respectively, for the first and the second challenge) were significantly lower (p less than 0.01) than mean control PD20 values (1.36 mg/ml and 1.48 mg/ml, respectively, for the first and the second challenge). These results indicate that propranolol increases airway responsiveness to histamine, even in those subjects with asthma in whom propranolol has little bronchoconstrictive effect.", 
    "5": "Anterior chamber aqueous humor flow rate was measured in unanesthetized owl monkeys using fluorophotometry and anterior chamber photogrammetry. The mean anterior chamber turnover constant (ko) was 0.01, the mean aqueous humor flow rate was 2.75 microliters min-1, and the mean anterior chamber volume was 317 microliters in 16 eyes of eight monkeys. A significantly lower (11%, P less than 0.002) flow rate was measured in the afternoon compared to flow rates measured in the morning. This diurnal cycle is analogous to the fluctuations in flow in humans and supports the hypothesis that aqueous humor formation in primates is regulated by endogenous mechanisms. To investigate the role of adrenergic mechanisms in regulating flow, the dose-response effect of topical timolol (0.5-100 micrograms) was measured. Five microliters drops were used to minimize systemic absorption. Lower concentrations (0.01% and 0.05%) caused sporadic changes in flow. Topical 0.1% timolol (5 micrograms) significantly decreased aqueous humor flow in the treated eye compared to baseline flow while flow in the contralateral eye was not significantly different from baseline flow. Higher concentrations of timolol (0.5% and 1%) caused a dose-related bilateral decrease in flow. These results indicate that even with small topical volumes systemic absorption of the higher concentrations of timolol occurs. Significant local inhibition of flow occurred following 5 micrograms of topical timolol whereas an equal bilateral decrease in flow occurred following a 100 microgram dose. These results suggest that the standard clinical dose (approximately equal to 100 micrograms) is supramaximal for decreasing aqueous flow.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "6": "This study was undertaken to observe the effect on the differential light sensitivity in glaucoma suspects produced by a long-term reduction in intraocular pressure (IOP) with timolol maleate. The results are taken from an ongoing 6 year follow-up study of glaucoma suspects randomly selected for treatment and nontreatment. We present fine-grid meridional data, recorded every 4 months by automated perimetry, of all 46 patients (24 treated and 22 untreated) who completed the 6 year follow-up without developing localized visual field defects, acquired optic disc changes and whose IOP was not judged clinically dangerous during the follow-up. Methods of analyzing the profile sensitivity, the profile slope and the sensitivity of specific locations over the follow-up are described. The results show that the long-term fluctuation in differential light sensitivity in the two groups was not significantly different (P = 0.395) and that the sensitivity at most of the locations remained stable. The number of stable locations was not significantly different in the two groups (P = 0.412) and there was also no difference in the number of locations where the sensitivity appeared to decrease (P = 0.193) or increase (P = 0.540). Analysis of covariance showed no group difference in the profile sensitivity or the profile slope and that these variables remained stable in both groups over the 6 year period. Although the treated group maintained a consistently lower IOP than the untreated controls, our results showed that long-term pressure reduction with timolol in glaucoma suspects appeared not to influence the differential light sensitivity in the tested meridian.", 
    "7": "Antianginal treatment of animals with experimentally induced myocardial ischemia produced significant effects on the quantitative and qualitative composition of phospholipids: total phospholipids returned to normal levels, cardiolipins and phosphatidilinosytes were drastically increased. In ischemia, this lipid metabolism derangement appears to be of great significance as it enables the physiochemical status of biological membranes to be relatively stabilized, which is an essential condition for the enzymic system of cardiomyocytes to act.", 
    "8": "Only in 115 of 320 patients who had attended the polyclinic for cardialgias, static exercise and bicycle ergometer tests could be performed because of medical contraindications and the patients' refusal to participate in the investigation. Positive results were found in 15 patients who had undergone bicycle ergometer tests and in 12 patients who did static exercise. It has been shown that static exercise tests may be useful for selecting antianginal drugs (glyceryl trinitrate, anapriline, corinfar) for outpatients with coronary heart disease on an individual basis.", 
    "9": "Sotalol is a beta-blocker which also prolongs repolarization. Its relative efficacy towards suppressing chronic ventricular arrhythmia was tested by comparison with propranolol. This double blind parallel comparison study involved 30 patients with or without coronary artery disease who had chronic symptomatic ventricular arrhythmia and more than an average of 30 premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) per hour. After the placebo baseline period patients received four weeks of active treatment with sotalol or propranolol. Responders were patients who had 75% or more reduction of PVCs during 24 h Holter monitoring. One patient in each treatment group had intolerable side effects on a low dose of the drug and were withdrawn. Side effects were present more frequently in the propranolol group compared with sotalol. Proarrhythmic effects were present in one patient on sotalol. There was no significant difference in suppression of ventricular extrasystoles (sotalol 65%, propranolol 44%), with reduction in ventricular couplets being 99% for sotalol and 49% for propranolol. There was a significant increase in QTc in patients on sotalol. Therefore, sotalol is a well tolerated drug and may be preferable to propranolol for control of chronic ventricular arrhythmia.", 
    "10": "Single intravenous doses of isoptin (10 mg) and obsidan (5 mg) were tested for their effects on hemodynamic and coronary blood flow parameters in 35 patients with coronary heart disease and functional classes II-III angina pectoris of effort. In most cases, hemodynamic and coronary blood flow responses to the drug administered were found to be identical. It was concluded that isoptin was effective as an antianginal agent in eukinetic hemodynamics, obsidan, in hyperkinetic one.", 
    "11": "The hypotensive effects of some antihypertensive drugs are augmented under sodium restriction, while those of others are not. The mechanisms of these interactions were theoretically analyzed based on the arterial pressure-natriuresis relationship. Four-week studies were performed in 24 patients with essential hypertension who were given a regular sodium diet (12-15 g of NaCl/d) in the first and third weeks and a sodium-restricted diet (1-3 g/d) in the second and fourth weeks. One of three antihypertensive drugs, 60 mg/d of nicardipine (Ca-antagonist), 120 mg/d of propranolol (beta-blocker) or 150 mg/d of captopril (converting-enzyme inhibitor) was administered in the third and fourth weeks. The mean arterial pressure and urinary sodium excretion were measured on the last three days of each week. The degree of interaction between the antihypertensive drugs and sodium restriction was statistically compared. The hypotensive effect of nicardipine and propranolol did not differ with the change in sodium intake, whereas that of captopril was greater under sodium restriction than under the regular sodium diet. Urinary sodium excretion was plotted on the ordinate as a function of arterial pressure before and after administration of the antihypertensive drugs. The pressure-natriuresis curve was shifted left, without a change in the slope, by nicardipine and propranolol and also left, but with a decrease in the slope, by captopril. The hypotensive effect of nicardipine and propranolol, being independent of the amount of sodium intake, was based on the leftward shift of the pressure-natriuresis curve that was probably due to the decrease in renal vascular resistance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "12": "We compared the antihypertensive efficacy of atenolol (100 mg/d), canrenoate potassium (200 mg/d), and captopril (75 mg/d) in 30 essential hypertensives. The three drugs were administered in a randomized change-over sequence for four-months each. The main variables associated with blood pressure regulation were measured in the basal condition and at the end of each treatment period. The erythrocyte Na transport systems were measured only in the basal condition and at the end of the first treatment period. The average blood pressure reduction was similar for each drug. Mean blood pressure levels after captopril correlated positively with those after atenolol in the individual patients (P less than 0.0001); mean blood pressure levels after canrenoate potassium, on the contrary, did not correlate with those after the other two drugs. Captopril and canrenoate potassium treatment reduced intraerythrocyte Na content (P less than 0.02), canrenoate potassium increased Na-K pump (P0.05), atenolol did not change any erythrocyte membrane Na transport parameters. The ouabain-resistant Na transport systems were not modified by any drug. The patients were divided in three groups according to their antihypertensive response: nonresponders (six patients), canrenoate potassium responders (nine patients) and captopril-atenolol responders (15 patients, equally responsive to both drugs). Nonresponders had the lowest basal Na pump (P less than 0.02). Canrenoate potassium responders had higher basal Na-K cotransport than captopril-atenolol responders (P less than 0.02). Atenolol-captopril responders had the highest basal plasma renin activity (PRA, P less than 0.02). The blood pressure reduction after atenolol correlated with the induced fall in PRA (P less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "13": "A multicentre study, involving 358 subjects, was carried out to evaluate the effects of a low-Na/high-K dietary salt in hypertensive patients receiving beta-blocker monotherapy. At the end of a 4-week treatment period with 200 mg slow-release metoprolol patients were randomly divided into two groups: one group was given common salt and the other the dietary salt. Both salts were given at table, in double-blind conditions over a period of 4 weeks. The dietary salt group showed a systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) reduction (4.2 and 3.0 mmHg, respectively, in the supine position and 4.0 and 2.5 mmHg in the standing position), which was virtually absent in the common salt group. A statistically significant difference between the two groups was found only between the systolic values (P less than 0.05). Twenty-four-hour urinary sodium excretion did not change in either group, while the excretion of 24-h urinary potassium increased significantly in the dietary salt group. It is concluded that in mild or moderately hypertensive patients already receiving a beta-blocker, ancillary treatment with a low-Na/high-K salt can be expected to lead to a further, slight reduction in systolic BP, probably due to the daily potassium load (around 20 mmol).", 
    "14": "Endoscopic sclerotherapy (ES) and continuous propranolol (P) treatment have both been proposed as useful methods to prevent recurrent esophageal variceal bleeding. We report a prospective randomized trial in 65 patients with a previous history of endoscopically proven esophageal variceal bleeding. Patients were randomized by sealed envelopes stratified for Child's A and B groups to receive either endoscopic sclerotherapy (n = 31) or propranolol (n = 34). The dose of oral propranolol was based on a reduction of the resting pulse rate by 25%. Intravascular ethanolamine oleate was used for the endoscopic sclerotherapy in a 3-week schedule. The follow-up period ranged from 17 to 57 months (median: ES = 31; P = 28 months). There was no difference in the cumulative percentages of patients free of rebleeding from any source: esophageal and gastric varices, acute esophageal and gastric ulcers or erosions (ES = 37%; P = 16%). Also, there was no difference in the cumulative survival (ES = 69%; P = 54%). However, patients in the propranolol group had significantly more variceal rebleeding from the esophagus (n = 21) than did those in the sclerotherapy group (n = 9). The cumulative percentages of patients free of esophageal variceal rebleeding after inclusion were 67% in the endoscopic sclerotherapy group and 25% in the propranolol group (log-rank test, P less than 0.02). These differences indicated that sclerotherapy should be used in 29% of the propranolol patients who rebled. Based on these results we recommend elective sclerotherapy as long-term therapy for preventing rebleeding of esophageal varices.", 
    "15": "1. The position in the gastrointestinal tract of an orally administered oxprenolol Oros drug delivery system labelled with technetium-99m DTPA was followed by gamma scintigraphy, and the corresponding plasma drug concentration-time profiles after oral and i.v. administration were used to relate pharmacokinetic and transit data. 2. Gastric emptying time (0.8 +/- 0.4 h, mean +/- s.d.), and the time to arrival in the colon (3.8 +/- 0.7 h) were reasonably consistent after administration of the Oros system to fasted subjects, as were the calculated small intestine transit times (3.0 +/- 0.7 h). As expected there were wide individual variations in colonic transit, so that recorded values for total transit ranged from 6 to 32 h (median, 24.7 h). 3. Absorption of oxprenolol occurred throughout the GI tract including the colon. Plasma drug concentration-time profiles and input functions (calculated by deconvolution) could be related to transit behaviour and in vitro release. Inflexions in the calculated rate of drug input when the Oros system was located in the colon corresponded with periods of stagnation at the hepatic and splenic flexures in two subjects and the ileocaecal junction in two others. The mechanism of these changes is unclear.", 
    "16": "A multicentred, randomised, blind study was started in 1978 to compare propranolol or hyaluronidase with placebo in patients with acute myocardial infarction admitted within 18 hours of onset of symptoms. Patients were randomised to group A and received hyaluronidase, propranolol, or placebo, or, if propranolol was contraindicated, to group B and received hyaluronidase or placebo. Hyaluronidase (500 U/kg given every six hours for 48 hours) had no effect on mortality or infarct size in the overall population. Because spontaneous reperfusion was more common in patients with early peaking of plasma creatine kinase MB or non-transmural electrocardiographic changes or both, the results were reanalysed for two subgroups: those in whom plasma creatine kinase peaked less than 15 hours after the onset of symptoms (early peak, n = 184) and those with a peak greater than 15 h after the onset of symptoms (late peak, n = 546). The distribution of time to peak activity of creatine kinase MB was similar in the hyaluronidase and placebo groups. In the early peak patients who were given hyaluronidase (groups A and B) total mortality and cardiac-specific four year mortality were significantly lower. This was most pronounced in group B in which the total mortality was 45% and cardiovascular mortality was 47% less than in the placebo group. Similarly, mortality from cardiovascular disease in patients (groups A and B) with nontransmural ischaemia (ST-T changes) given hyaluronidase was significantly lower, with group B showing a 50% reduction. In the subsets of patients with late peaking of creatine kinase MB or those presenting with transmural electrocardiographic changes there was no difference in total mortality or deaths from cardiac disease between those given hyaluronidase and those given placebo. Hyaluronidase was associated with improved survival in patients with early peaking of plasma creatine kinase MB, suggesting the possibility of salvage of myocardium in patients who have early spontaneous reperfusion and possibly after therapeutic reperfusion.", 
    "17": "Hypermetabolism, increased heart rate, and lipolysis are responses to high catecholamine levels associated with burn injury. This study tests the hypothesis that adrenergic beta blockade in burns could reduce myocardial work, lipolysis, and negative nitrogen balance without adversely affecting cardiac or metabolic function. Eighteen patients with burns of 70 +/- 3% total burn surface area (TBSA) (Mean +/- SEM), were studied after a 5-day infusion of 2 mg/Kg of intravenous (I.V.) propranolol infusion every 24 hours without their cardiac output or resting energy expenditure being adversely reduced. Heart rate, left ventricular work, and rate pressure product were significantly reduced by 20, 22, and 36%, respectively (P less than 0.05). Plasma glucose, free fatty acids, triglycerides, and insulin levels remained unchanged. The rate of urea production, however, was significantly increased by 54 +/- 12% in fasted patients, and to a much lesser 12 +/- 2% in fed patients. The marked decrease in myocardial work afforded by propranolol administration may be of clinical benefit in the treatment of large burns. Variations in drug dosage and feeding regimens will, however, need to be perfected to limit catabolic effects.", 
    "18": "Extracellular high potassium inhibits renin release in vitro by increasing calcium concentrations in the juxtaglomerular cells. We found that the decreased response of renin release from rat kidney cortical slices in high potassium solution (20-80 mM) changed to a strikingly increased one in the presence of nifedipine at doses over 10(-6) M. We then examined the stimulatory effect of extracellular high potassium in the presence of nifedipine on renin release. The enhancement of release was significantly suppressed either by propranolol or by metoprolol but not by prazosin. High potassium plus nifedipine-induced increase in renin release was markedly attenuated by renal denervation. The enhancing effect was not observed when the slices were incubated in calcium-free medium. Divalent cations such as Cd2+, Co2+, and Mn2+ (0.1-3.0 mM) blocked this enhancement in a concentration-dependent manner. High potassium elicited an increase in 3H efflux from the slices preloaded with [3H]norepinephrine. The increasing effect was not influenced by nifedipine but was abolished by the removal of extracellular calcium or by the addition of divalent cations. These observations suggest to us that the high potassium plus nifedipine-induced increase in renin release from the slices is mediated by norepinephrine derived from renal sympathetic nerves and that this neuronally released norepinephrine stimulates renin release via activation of beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "19": "In the anterogradely perfused rat heart with glucose as fuel, 1 microM isoproterenol (ISO) inhibited the insulin (INS) plus adenosine deaminase (AdoDA) stimulation of ventricular protein synthesis by 72%. ISO (1 microM) alone had no effect on ventricular protein synthesis but inhibited atrial protein synthesis by 20%. The concentration dependence of the ISO inhibition was similar to the stimulation of glucose uptake by ISO. Inhibition could not be overcome by increasing INS concentrations. The effects of ISO were diminished by propranolol and could be partially mimicked by forskolin (FSK) or 8-(4-chlorophenylthio-)adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (CPT-cAMP). The stimulation of protein synthesis by noncarbohydrate fuels was antagonized by ISO. Hypoxia (PO2 = 50%) also antagonized the INS stimulation of ventricular protein synthesis but did not affect basal rates. ATP contents were decreased by ISO but not by a PO2 of 50%. Both manipulations increased lactate output. The inhibition of protein synthesis by ISO could possibly be explained by indirect effects of ISO on cardiac \"energy status.\" Furthermore, inhibition may thus represent purely an in vitro phenomenon and may not occur in vivo. However, the possibility that there are more direct effects of ISO on the machinery of protein synthesis has not been excluded. The inhibition of protein synthesis by hypoxia cannot be explained by changes in energy status and may result from intracellular lactoacidosis.", 
    "20": "Multifocal atrial tachycardia is a difficult arrhythmia to treat. Patients not showing a response to the correction of predisposing conditions present a therapeutic dilemma. To assess the efficacy of two agents reported to be effective in this condition, verapamil, metoprolol, or placebo was given intravenously in a randomized, double-blind trial.", 
    "21": "Thirteen patients meeting inclusionary criteria were enrolled. Therapeutic response was defined as conversion to sinus rhythm, a decline in the ventricular rate of 15 percent or more [corrected], or a ventricular rate of less than 100 beats/minute. Four male and nine female patients having a mean age (+/- SD) of 81.9 +/- 14.2 years were enrolled. Automated serum chemistries, complete blood cell count with differential, arterial blood gas values, and serum digoxin and theophylline levels were determined and a 12-lead electrocardiogram was obtained at the start of the trial.

    "24": "Comparison of the hemodynamic and hormonal effects of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists with different ancillary properties may help to clarify the antihypertensive mechanism of these drugs. Under strict basal conditions, the effects of acebutolol (400 mg b.i.d.), atenolol (100 mg b.i.d.), pindolol (10 mg b.i.d.), and propranolol (80 mg t.i.d.), were studied for the first 24 hours in 40 hypertensive patients. With pindolol, mean arterial pressure was reduced (p less than 0.05) 1 hour after administration, whereas the cardiac index and the systemic vascular resistance index did not change. With the other three drugs, the fall in mean arterial pressure was delayed 2-3 hours. With these drugs, the fall in mean arterial pressure was preceded by a rise in the resistance index, which compensated for the initial fall in cardiac index. With each drug, the decrements in mean arterial pressure were associated with parallel decrements in the resistance index, and percent changes in mean arterial pressure and the resistance index were always significantly (p less than 0.001) correlated. At the end of the 24-hour period, the four drugs shared an equal antihypertensive effect, which varied 14-17%. This was associated with a return of the cardiac index toward control values by acebutolol, atenolol, and propranolol treatment and a moderately increased cardiac index above pretreatment values (13%, p less than 0.01) with pindolol. The secondary rise in the cardiac index was inversely correlated (p less than 0.001) with the fall in mean arterial pressure with all four drugs. Plasma renin was maximally suppressed 2 hours after treatment, thus before any change in mean arterial pressure had occurred with acebutolol, atenolol, and propranolol. Pretreatment values of active renin and the reduction of mean arterial pressure 24 hours after administration were not correlated in any of the four groups. Despite the \"vasodilator\" action of the four drugs, plasma norepinephrine did not rise. Our data show that the main hemodynamic change that occurs at the time blood pressure falls after beta-adrenoceptor antagonism is vasodilation. Neither autoregulation of blood flow nor renin suppression can explain this vasodilator action. The absence of an increase in norepinephrine, despite vasodilation, suggests that beta-adrenoceptor antagonism interferes with sympathetic vasoconstrictor nerve activity. This effect may explain the vasodilator and antihypertensive potential of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists.", 
    "25": "TMB-8 has been used experimentally in many cell types, including endocrine cells, because of its ability to block the efflux of Ca2+ from intracellular stores without affecting influx. Unexpectedly, TMB-8 potentiates stimulated insulin release from pancreatic islets, a process believed to be dependent on the level of cytosolic Ca2+. In the present study, while having no effect on basal insulin release (in the presence of 2.8 mM glucose), TMB-8 (10, 30, and 100 microM) caused a concentration-dependent increase in 45Ca2+ efflux from 45Ca2+-preloaded islets. TMB-8 (100 microM) stimulated 45Ca2+ efflux even in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. In the presence of 5.6 mM glucose, TMB-8 (30 and 100 microM) potentiated insulin release and again increased 45Ca2+ efflux in a concentration-dependent manner. Similarly, insulin release stimulated by isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) was potentiated significantly, and IBMX-stimulated 45Ca2+ efflux was increased by the simultaneous introduction of 30 microM TMB-8. Thus, in pancreatic islets, TMB-8 appears to mobilize Ca2+ from intracellular stores, rather than inhibit the efflux as has been commonly accepted. In further studies, using insulin-secreting beta-cells of the RINm5F cell line, TMB-8 was shown to increase the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in the presence and absence of extracellular Ca2+. This confirmed that mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ was occurring in the pancreatic beta-cell in response to TMB-8. Furthermore, a rise in cytosolic Ca2+ of not more than 10 nM (as induced with KCl) was found to mimick the effect of TMB-8 in conjunction with IBMX. No additional effect of TMB-8 to alter Ca2+ handling at the plasma membrane was found when 45Ca2+ uptake experiments were performed. Therefore, the paradoxical mobilization of beta-cell Ca2+ by TMB-8 appears to be a sufficient explanation for its potentiating effect on the rate of insulin secretion.", 
    "26": "1. The ability of the cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist bisoprolol ((+/-)-1-[4-(2-isopropoxyethoxymethyl)-phenoxy]-3-isopropyl-amino -2-propanol hemifumarate, EMD 33512) to suppress isoprenaline-induced increases in heart rate and maximal rate of rise in left ventricular pressure (LVdP/dtmax) was studied in 6 anaesthetized pigs given 4 cumulative doses (16, 64, 256 and 1024 micrograms kg-1). Bisoprolol was about 2 times more effective in suppressing isoprenaline-induced increases in LVdP/dtmax than those in heart rate. 2. In 8 animals which had a partial stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LADCA), the effects of 3 consecutive doses (50, 200 and 750 micrograms kg-1) of bisoprolol were studied on systemic haemodynamics, regional myocardial perfusion and function. The effects of the drug were compared with those obtained in a group of 9 animals with LADCA stenosis which did not receive any treatment. 3. The lowest dose of bisoprolol (50 micrograms kg-1) increased perfusion of the ischaemic myocardium (which had been reduced from 123 +/- 20 ml min-1 100 g-1 to 42 +/- 11 ml min-1 100 g-1) by 21 +/- 10 ml min-1 100 g-1 (P less than 0.05). In particular the subendocardial layers, which were most severely affected by the stenosis (a decrease from 128 +/- 19 ml min-1 100 g-1 to 20 +/- 6 ml min-1 100 g-1) benefited from the administration of the drug (an increase of 30 +/- 10 ml min-1 100 g-1). Perfusion of the subepicardium was not significantly affected. With the higher dose only a minor additional improvement in perfusion of the ischaemic myocardium was observed. 4. The negative chronotropic response is the most likely factor leading to the improvement in perfusion. 5. Myocardial wall thickening, which decreased from 41 +/- 2% to 9 +/- 4% (P less than 0.05) due to the hypoperfusion, did not improve after administration of the drug. This lack of improvement may possibly be due to the duration of ischaemia before and the magnitude of the flow deficit after bisoprolol administration. 6. Between 15 and 60 min of ischaemia, 5 of the 9 untreated animals had an episode of ventricular fibrillation compared with only 1 of the 8 animals treated with bisoprolol, in spite of an initially larger flow reduction in the treated animals. The more homogeneous flow distribution after bisoprolol might account for the lower incidence of arrhythmias in this group. 7. It was demonstrated that bisoprolol improves perfusion of ischaemic myocardium in anaesthetized pigs even at doses (50.pgkg-1) that only moderately antagonize isoprenaline-induced cardiostimulatory effects.", 
    "27": "There is now considerable evidence in favor of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) as a neurotransmitter of nonadrenergic noncholinergic nerves in the airways. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the influence of inhaled VIP on bronchomotor tone after a beta-adrenergic- and cholinergic-receptor blockage. The study was performed in six patients with asthma in 4 days. On the first day, a propranolol provocative dose producing a 20% change in FEV1 (PD20) was determined from the individual semilogarithmic dose-response curve. On the other days, the propranolol challenge was performed after inhalation of ipratropium bromide (40 micrograms), VIP (70 micrograms), and both drugs in randomized double-blind order. Statistical analysis was performed by two-way analysis of variance. The results demonstrated that mean propranolol PD20 was 0.14 mg (geometric mean + SD = 1.22). Ipratropium bromide administration, like VIP administration, significantly raised the PD20 value. The administration of both drugs elicited a further remarkable increase of mean propranolol PD20. The results demonstrated that inhaled VIP influences bronchomotor tone and that this effect is independent of the cholinergic blockage.", 
    "28": "Celiprolol is a newly developed cardioselective beta-blocking agent with mild beta 2-agonist and weak alpha 2-antagonist properties. To evaluate the acute (2.5 hours) and chronic (2 weeks) effects of celiprolol (400 mg once a day) on plasma renin, aldosterone, norepinephrine and epinephrine, 20 patients with mild to moderate primary hypertension were studied in a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial. Two and one-half hours after the first dose of both placebo and celiprolol, supine and standing measurements of blood pressure showed a significant reduction, whereas plasma norepinephrine increases were comparable with baseline values. Placebo and celiprolol produced similar changes on supine blood pressure and plasma norepinephrine. In 9 patients celiprolol decreased plasma renin (from a mean +/- standard deviation of 1.09 +/- 0.35 to 0.77 +/- 0.52 ng/ml/hr, p less than 0.05) and aldosterone (from 9.2 +/- 3.7 to 6.7 +/- 3.9 ng/dl, p less than 0.05) acutely both supine and standing, but placebo did not change these parameters. Celiprolol increased pulse rate supine (but not standing) as compared with baseline values. After 2 weeks of celiprolol therapy, blood pressure was decreased both supine and standing compared with placebo in 18 patients (140 +/- 18/88 +/- 8 vs 149 +/- 18/94 +/- 7, 136 +/- 18/91 +/- 6 vs 142 +/- 20/97 +/- 9 mm Hg, respectively, each p less than 0.05), without a change of pulse rate when supine and with a reduction when standing. There were no significant changes of plasma renin, aldosterone, norepinephrine and epinephrine levels during chronic therapy compared with placebo.", 
    "29": "The effects of the two putative neurotransmitters acetylcholine and norepinephrine on immunoreactive CRF-41 release from incubated rat hypothalami were studied. Acetylcholine at concentrations of 10(-11) to 10(-7) M stimulated CRF-41 release. This effect was blocked in a dose-dependent manner by the muscarinic antagonist atropine (10(-9) to (-7) M). The nicotinic antagonist hexamethonium was ineffective at a dose of 10(-7) M, but produced slight inhibition of this response at 10(-5) M. Norepinephrine at concentrations of 10(-10) to 10(-6) M also produced a dose-dependent stimulation of CRF-41 release. The beta-adrenoceptor antagonists propranolol (10(-5) M) and timolol (10(-6) M) blocked norepinephrine-induced CRF-41 release. The alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists thymoxamine (10(-5) M), prazosin (10(-5) M), and corynanthine (10(-4) M), and the alpha 2-antagonist idazoxan (10(-5) M), were ineffective. Potassium depolarization (56 mM) caused stimulation of CRF-41 release which was dependent on the presence of calcium in the incubation medium. Authenticity of immunoreactive CRF-41 released was demonstrated by chromatographic criteria using gel filtration and reversed phase HPLC. These results provide evidence for a stimulatory role of acetylcholine and norepinephrine on CRF-41 release, and consequently on hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis in the rat, through actions at a hypothalamic level. The stimulatory effect of acetylcholine is mediated principally through muscarinic receptors and that of norepinephrine through beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "30": "symptomatic dilated cardiomyopathy were studied in order to evaluate the effect of long term sympathetic beta-blockade with metoprolol. Clinical evaluation, stress test, two-dimensional echocardiography, 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiography and hemodynamic assessment with Swan-Ganz catheter were performed before enrollment in the study. Patients were randomly assigned to the relative placebo (8 pts) or metoprolol group (12 pts) in a single-blind fashion. The placebo group received standard therapy (digitalis, diuretics, vasodilators and anticoagulants as needed), while the metoprolol group, along with standard therapy received low-dose beta-blockade, starting with 6.25 mg twice daily and then doubling every 4 days on the two daily administrations. The therapeutic end-point was 100 mg. Patients received less than 100 mg if their systolic blood pressure was less than 100 mmHg or if their resting heart rate was less than 55 beats/min. Patients were clinically assessed every month and a 24-hour electrocardiography, echocardiography and hemodynamic control was repeated after six months. In the metoprolol group there was one sudden death and two drop-outs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "31": "A method has been developed which allows the kinetics of oral mucosal drug absorption from solutions to be studied in a single 15-20 min test. This is an improvement over the traditional buccal absorption test which requires a separate experiment for each time point, thus taking days for each kinetic profile. It should also allow for disappearance of drug from the mouth and appearance in the plasma to be monitored simultaneously. The drug solution includes 8 micrograms mL-1 phenol red as a marker for salivary secretion. Samples are withdrawn at suitable times with a positive displacement pipettor and analysed for drug and phenol red. Salivary volume time data are described by least squares polynominals. Kinetic parameters are estimated by non-linear least squares regression. The method, which requires that phenol red is not lost during a test, provides an internal test for this. It also requires that phenol red and the drug do not interfere with each other's assay, that saliva does not affect the assays of these materials, and that phenol red does not interfere with the absorption of the drug.", 
    "32": "Low concentrations of betaxolol in blood plasma and physiological buffers were determined by selected ion monitoring of the intense m/z 72 fragment [CH2 = NH-CH(CH3)2]+ formed by electron impact ionization of the O-trimethylsilyl derivative. At a mass spectrometric resolution of 3000, fewer potentially interfering peaks were seen than at low resolution. There remained a chemical interference, corresponding to 100 pg/sample, which arose during treatment of the samples. This method is more sensitive than previous ones, but it is restricted to situations where the specificity can be controlled. When the m/z 72 fragment was mass-shifted by using betaxolol appropriately labelled with deuterium or 13C, both the interference and the baseline noise were greatly reduced; concentrations of labelled betaxolol as low as 10-20 pg/sample can be determined with little difficulty.", 
    "33": "The combined effect of a beta 2-antagonist and an alpha 2-agonist on the release of adrenal catecholamines was studied in the anaesthetized and vagotomized dog. The electrical stimulation of the splanchnic nerve (5-V pulses of 2 ms duration for 3 min at a frequency of 3 Hz) produced a significant rise in adrenal catecholamine release in the adrenal vein. Intravenous injection of a beta 2-antagonist significantly reduced this response and a subsequent injection of an alpha 2-agonist further reduced the release of catecholamines. However, if the alpha 2-agonist is injected first, the release is not different compared with the control stimulation, and the subsequent injection of the beta 2-antagonist also did not modify the release in response to electrical stimulation. These results suggest that the blockade of presynaptic beta 2-receptors reduces the release of adrenal catecholamines without interfering with the activation of the alpha 2-adrenoceptors. In contrast, the pretreatment with the alpha 2-agonist, which does not modify the release of catecholamine at 3 Hz, seems to interfere with the inhibitory effect of the beta 2-antagonist.", 
    "34": "These experiments investigated in the awake rat the involvement of noradrenergic projections to the rostral hypothalamus in the drinking and pressor responses elicited by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injections of 25 ng of angiotensin II. Phentolamine mesylate in doses of 2.5-125 micrograms injected into the rostral hypothalamus produced a dose-dependent depression of both the drinking and pressor responses elicited by i.c.v. administration of angiotensin II. A paradoxical increase in heart rate was associated with a decrease in pressor responses with increasing doses of phentolamine. This response was due to tissue injections, since pretreatment by injecting 12.5 micrograms of phentolamine into the ventricle did not block either the cardiovascular or drinking responses to i.c.v. injections of angiotensin II. Yohimbine (0.33-3.3 micrograms), DL-propranolol (25 micrograms), and atenolol (25 micrograms) did not, but prazosin (0.7 microgram) did significantly alter the pressor responses. Although yohimbine also was without effect on drinking, prazosin reduced the drinking responses. These results suggest that alpha 1-adrenergic receptors in the rostral hypothalamus are involved in the control of both the drinking and pressor responses elicited by i.c.v. injections of angiotensin II. In the case of propranolol and atenolol, beta-adrenergic receptors altered only the drinking response in a nonspecific manner by eliciting competing behaviors. Whether they are involved in modifying the drinking response only remains to be demonstrated.", 
    "35": "We found in an earlier investigation that the frequency of hypertension is considerably lower among male athletes than in a random sample of the general population. The cases of hypertension in younger athletes are primarily hypertension stage I (WHO). We followed up on the question of the course of hypertension stage I and the possibility of spontaneous remission. For this, we observed 28 nonmedicated patients with hypertension stage I for 4.2 +/- 2.3 years, 20 patients undergoing drug therapy for 2.5 +/- 1.3 years, and 12 healthy athletes for 4.2 +/- 2.2 years. Under drug therapy, as expected, there was a normalization of both basic and exercise blood pressures. Fifty percent of patients without drug therapy showed remission of the elevated basic and exercise pressures after 2 to 3 years; 50% had an unchanged high pressure or deterioration. The transition of hypertension WHO stage I to stage II with regard to left ventricular hypertrophy could be ruled out echocardiographically in patients with a favorable course (remission). However, there was a tendency in this direction among patients with the least favorable course.", 
    "36": "The systemic administration of isoprenaline to rats produced a dose-dependent increase in drinking which was antagonized by propranolol. While oral administration of the antidepressant, imipramine, alone had no significant effect on this response, the increase was significantly inhibited by administration of imipramine together with each of the following drugs over a period of 4 days: bupropion (21.0 mg/kg/day, p.o.), a selective inhibitor of the uptake of dopamine and nomifensine (10.6 mg/kg/day, p.o.), a relatively selective dopamine and a blocker of the uptake of noradrenaline. Similarly, the combination of the selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin (2.37 mg/kg/day, p.o.); the selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine (2.38 mg/kg/day, p.o.) or the non-selective alpha-adrenoceptor blocker, phentolamine (4.65 mg/kg/day, p.o.) with imipramine caused a significant inhibition of the isoprenaline-induced drinking. It is concluded that fast desensitization of central beta-adrenoceptors in the rat can be produced after the oral subacute simultaneous administration of imipramine with alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists or atypical antidepressants, such as nomifensine or bupropion.", 
    "37": "1. The actions of the two peptides, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and peptide histidine isoleucine (PHI) have been compared to that of isoprenaline on the smooth muscle systems of the isolated blood-perfused dog spleen. 2. Intra-arterial injections of VIP and PHI caused graded increases in splenic arterial blood flow at constant perfusion pressure indicative of splenic arterial vasodilatation. 3. VIP was significantly more potent than PHI, with their respective molar ED50 values being 9.9 +/- 3.7 and 830 +/- 141 pmol (P less than 0.002). VIP was approximately 10 and 200 times more potent than isoprenaline and PHI respectively. 4. The maximum reduction in splenic arterial vascular resistance was the same (P greater than 0.5) in response to intra-arterial VIP and PHI, although both peptide maxima were significantly less (P less than 0.05, 0.01 respectively) than that obtained with isoprenaline. 5. Small increases in spleen volume accompanied the splenic vasodilator responses to both peptides. They were probably passive in origin, secondary to splenic arterial vasodilatation. 6. The selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, ICI 118,551, did not antagonize the splenic arterial vasodilator response to VIP or PHI but markedly attenuated the effect of isoprenaline. 7. These observations indicate that VIP and PHI, when either co-released locally or present together in the systemic circulation, may exert a differential action on different components of the circulation.", 
    "38": "1. To determine which subtype(s) of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor are involved in the anorectic action of quipazine, the ability of selective antagonists at 5-HT2- and 5-HT3-receptors, and an antagonist at 5-HT1-like receptors, to block this response were investigated in non-deprived rats, trained to eat a palatable diet. 2. Quipazine (0.5-8 mg kg-1, i.p.) produced a dose-related reduction in the intake of palatable diet. 3. The anorectic effect of 4 mg kg-1 quipazine was antagonized by the nonselective 5-HT-receptor antagonist methysergide (5 mg kg-1, i.p.) and by the selective 5-HT2-receptor antagonists ketanserin (1 mg kg-1 and 2.5 mg kg-1, i.p.) and ritanserin (0.5 mg kg-1 and 1 mg kg-1, i.p.). The selective 5-HT3-receptor antagonist GR38032F (1 mg kg-1, i.p.) and (-)-pindolol (4 mg kg-1, i.p.), which blocks some of the effects mediated at 5-HT1-like receptors, did not block the reduction in food intake produced by this dose of quipazine. 4. None of the 5-HT-receptor antagonists had any effect on food intake when they were administered alone, suggesting that endogenous 5-HT is not involved in the tonic control of food intake under the conditions of these experiments. 5. It is concluded that the anorectic action of quipazine is mediated, at least in part, by activation of 5-HT2-receptors.", 
    "39": "The greatest differences in ventricular arrhythmias and adverse effects of lidocaine observed in this study were between patients on both lidocaine and a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent and those on neither drug. Although free fractions of lidocaine and methylglycylxylidine tended to be higher in patients on beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents, this difference was not significant nor were any other differences in serum drug levels observed.", 
    "40": "The large clinical trials of the treatment of hypertension, in which diuretics were used as initial drug therapy, have demonstrated a major reduction in stroke but little benefit in the incidence of coronary heart disease. The limited effect of treatment on coronary disease is surprising given the strong risk factor relationship to pre-existing hypertension. This may mean that the risk factor relationship is not a causal one. Alternatively, the drug therapy may have subtle toxicity that in the long term offsets the benefit of lowering blood pressure. This review explores the latter possibility by reviewing the evidence that the antihypertensive drugs used preferentially heretofore have adverse effects on the lipid profile. Diuretics increase triglycerides (average of 30%), total cholesterol (average of 6-8%), and LDL or VLDL cholesterol. beta-1 selective and nonselective beta-blockers increase triglycerides (average of 30%) and lower HDL cholesterol (average of 5-15%). Whereas the adverse modifications of the lipid profile appear small and inconsequential, the increase in total cholesterol during diuretic therapy is of the same magnitude as observed in the Lipid Research Clinic trial (although opposite in direction) that significantly affected coronary events. The persistence of the lipid changes during long-term treatment is unresolved due to fragmentary and poorly controlled observations. Nevertheless, considerable data suggest that it continues during extended therapy. Selective alpha-1 adrenoceptor blocking drugs and perhaps calcium antagonists and beta-blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity have a favorable influence on the lipid profile.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "41": "While many interactions between nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) and other drugs are reported, only a limited number of them are clinically important. These interactions can be divided into those explainable on mainly pharmacokinetic grounds, those explainable on interactions between pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and those that remain unexplained. Among those explainable on primarily kinetic grounds are interactions of NSAID with antacids, anticoagulants, hypoglycemics, methotrexate, lithium, probenecid, and phenytoin. More complex interactions between dynamics and kinetics are those relating NSAID interactions with diuretics, beta-blockers, other NSAID, and some anticoagulants. Finally important interactions whose causes are not understood include those between aspirin and corticosteroid, indomethacin and triamterene, and flurbiprofen with certain anticoagulants.", 
    "42": "This review describes the effects of antihypertensive drugs on the performance of aerobic exercise. All available antihypertensive drugs lower blood pressure both at rest and decrease the rate of increase during exercise. However, they differ in their effects on exercise performance. The ideal antihypertensive agent should not have significant depressant effects on the myocardium, should not promote arrhythmias, should preserve the distribution of blood flow to exercising muscle, and should not interfere with substrate utilization. Diuretics, one of the most commonly prescribed class of antihypertensives, have few deleterious effects on exercise performance but have adverse metabolic effects; beta blockers have many adverse effects on exercise performance. Agents which have the least potential for adverse effects on exercise performance and metabolic effects are the converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and alpha blockers, and central alpha agonists. The literature concerning each of these drugs is reviewed and recommendations are made for prescribing for the hypertensive who wishes to engage in vigorous exercise.", 
    "43": "Post-exercise ketosis is not abolished by glucose ingestion immediately after exercise but is counteracted by simultaneous beta-adrenergic blockade. To investigate the effect of beta-adrenergic blockade on post-exercise ketosis without the ingestion of glucose, we administered propranolol (1 mg/kg body mass) to 15 carbohydrate-starved people, of whom five had just walked 9 km in 2 h. There were 43 control subjects (no propranolol). The blood concentration of 3-hydroxybutyrate rose from 0.18 +/- 0.02 (S.E.M.) mmol/l at 07.00 h to 0.35 +/- 0.04 mmol/l at 09.00 h whether the subjects had exercised during those 2 h or not (d.f. = 57). The blood concentration of 3-hydroxybutyrate at 15.00 h in the groups not treated with propranolol was not affected by exercise (0.95 +/- 0.90 mmol/l; d.f. = 42). Propranolol significantly raised the concentration of 3-hydroxybutyrate at 15.00 h to 1.68 +/- 0.26 mmol/l when given after exercise (d.f. = 4), but lowered it to 0.46 +/- 0.07 mmol/l in the non-exercised group (d.f. = 9). This was not accompanied by significant differences in the blood concentrations of glucose, free fatty acid, insulin or glucagon. The difference in response to propranolol administration is probably determined by the alanine and lactate flux from muscle for hepatic oxaloacetate synthesis.", 
    "44": "Our objectives were 1) to quantify the magnitude of the hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstrictor (HPV) response in conscious dogs by utilizing pulmonary vascular pressure-cardiac index (P/Q) plots and 2) to assess the extent to which the autonomic nervous system (ANS) modulates the HPV response. Multipoint P/Q plots were constructed in conscious dogs during normoxia and during bilateral alveolar hypoxia by stepwise constriction of the thoracic inferior vena cava to reduce Q. With the ANS intact, the pulmonary vascular pressure gradient (pulmonary arterial pressure-pulmonary capillary wedge pressure) increased (P less than 0.01) approximately twofold during hypoxia over a broad range of Q. The absolute magnitude of the HPV response was related (P less than 0.01) to the level of Q. We hypothesized that if ANS activation reduces the magnitude of HPV in intact dogs, then we would expect the magnitude of HPV to be increased both after combined sympathetic alpha-(phentolamine) and beta-(propranolol) adrenergic block and after total autonomic ganglionic block (hexamethonium). A marked HPV response (P less than 0.01) was observed after both combined sympathetic block and ganglionic block over a broad range of Q during alveolar hypoxia. The magnitude of the HPV response with the ANS intact, however, was not significantly different from the magnitude of HPV after combined sympathetic block (P = 0.45) or after ganglionic block (P = 0.64) at any level of Q. Thus, during bilateral alveolar hypoxia, the ANS does not appear to attenuate the HPV response of intact conscious dogs.", 
    "45": "The eyes from pigmented rabbits were instilled with the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists H 216/44 or timolol. After a single instillation (1.9 mumol), the iris and ciliary body contained H 216/44, which decreased with a half-life of approx. 43 days. Daily instillation caused a gradual increase in the content of H 216/44 and timolol in the iris and ciliary body, the steady-state concentration of timolol being 10 times higher than that of H 216/44. The concentrations of H 216/44 were seven times higher in the iris and ciliary body of pigmented rabbits than in albino animals. H 216/44 was reversibly bound to the melanosomes from the iris and ciliary body and not metabolized in this tissue. In vitro binding of timolol and H 216/44 to bovine melanosomes showed comparable multi-site binding curves. The binding of chlorpromazine was substantially higher. The beta-blockers could be more readily released from the melanosomes with aqueous solutions of salt and ethanol than with distilled water. It is concluded that both H 216/44 and timolol bind reversibly to ocular melanin. The differences in binding characteristics in vitro may only partly explain the differences in the in vivo binding to ocular melanin in the rabbit eye.", 
    "46": "The actions of alkylating pindolol (N8-bromoacetyl-N1-3'-(4-indolyloxy)-2'-hydroxypropyl[z]-1,8- diamino-p-menthane; BIM) have been examined on beta-adrenoceptors in guinea-pig left atria and trachea. In organ bath experiments, addition of BIM (greater than or equal to 0.1 microM), followed by washout, produced concentration-dependent rightward shifts of the dose-response curve to cumulative additions of (-)-isoprenaline and oxymethylene-isoprenaline and reductions in the maximal response. The \"apparent\" pA2 value for BIM was 9.23 +/- 0.20 (slope = 0.98 +/- 0.20). Changes in the maximal density of beta-adrenoceptor binding sites were determined in guinea-pig left atrial membranes using [125I]-cyanopindolol. BIM (0.1, 1.0 and 10 microM) produced 14, 23 and 41% reductions in Bmax with no change in KD. The binding of [125I]-BIM to guinea-pig left atrial membranes had a high non-specific binding component and a pseudo-Hill coefficient less than unity. The \"apparent\" KD value of [125I]-BIM at beta-adrenoceptor binding sites was 85.7 +/- 57.9 pM.", 
    "47": "Endothelin (ET), a novel 21-amino acid peptide isolated from the culture supernatant of porcine aortic endothelial cells, has been shown to be the most potent of all known vasoconstrictor substances. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects and the mode of actions of ET on the heart. ET exerted a positive inotropic effect in a dose-dependent manner on the electrically driven left atria of guinea pigs. The ET-induced response was of slow onset and characteristically long lasting. The half-maximal effective dose of the ET-induced response was about 1 nM, indicating that ET is one of the most potent cardiotonic substances. The response was presumably caused through direct actions of ET on the myocytes, since adrenergic, histaminergic, and serotonergic antagonists showed no effect on the response. The dose-response relationship of ET for the positive inotropic effect was displaced to the right in a parallel fashion by 0.3 microM nicardipine. In the left atria depolarized with 22 mM KCl, ET produced gradually increasing contractions in conjunction with the slow response action potentials in response to the electrical pacing. These results suggest that the ET-induced response on the left atria is intimately related to the influx of extracellular Ca2+.", 
    "48": "Changes in blood pressure and renal, mesenteric, and hindquarters vascular resistances were measured in conscious Long-Evans and Brattleboro (vasopressin-deficient) rats in response to sequential, continuous administrations of prazosin and idazoxan in the absence or presence of ICI 118551 (beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist) or propranolol. The large transient hypotensions elicited by prazosin and, subsequently, by idazoxan were associated with renal and hindquarters vasodilatations in both strains of rat. In Brattleboro rats, prazosin also elicited mesenteric vasodilatation. Pretreatment with ICI 118551 reduced the initial hypotensive effects and hindquarters vasodilatations elicited by prazosin and idazoxan, but the hemodynamic effects of prazosin were not significantly affected by propranolol. These results are consistent with propranolol antagonizing beta 1-adrenoceptor-mediated effects on the heart and the renin-angiotensin system that act to offset a beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilatation, which contributes to the effects elicited by alpha-adrenoceptor antagonism. Hemodynamic responses to captopril and d(CH2)5DAVP (in Long-Evans rats) in the presence of adrenoceptor antagonists were consistent with a major cardiovascular role of the renin-angiotensin system and a less overt role of vasopressin until the latter system was blocked.", 
    "49": "Celiac and superior mesenteric arterial blood flows were measured simultaneously in conscious beagle dogs. The responses to food were completely different between the two arteries. Celiac flow increased quickly to 180-200% of the control 2 min after food but started to decline rapidly to preprandial levels, though greater than 90% of food was still in the stomach. It remained at preprandial levels over the next 1-6 h. Superior mesenteric flow increased gradually in 20-50 min (peak: 230%) and remained above the control levels for 3-6 h. The celiac response was inhibited by vagal block, hexamethonium, and gastric mucosal anesthesia by oxethazaine but not by atropine, phenoxybenzamine, or propranolol. Postprandial superior mesenteric hyperemia was blocked by mucosal anesthesia and was reduced by atropine by 80%. Ganglionic or adrenergic blockades were without effect. It is concluded that the celiac peak response to food is mediated by a nonadrenergic, noncholinergic vagal reflex in conscious dogs. Extrinsic nerves probably play little part in the postprandial increase of superior mesenteric flow.", 
    "50": "Episodes of myocardial ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease may be due to transient increases in coronary vasomotor tone superimposed on a fixed atherosclerotic obstruction. The purpose of this study was to determine whether identification of the clinical pattern of angina could predict the therapeutic response to the addition of nifedipine to a regimen of beta blockers and/or long-acting nitrates. Seventy-two patients with stable exertional angina were divided into two groups: \"classic exertional angina\" (17 patients), defined as exertional angina with a stable threshold; and \"mixed angina\" (55 patients), defined as exertional angina provoked by a variable threshold and/or at least two episodes of rest angina within the 3 months prior to screening. Patients were studied with nifedipine and placebo in a 6-week, double-blind, crossover design that used serial anginal diaries, exercise treadmill tests, and 24-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring. In patients with mixed angina, nifedipine reduced the frequency of angina compared to that during placebo treatment (13.1 vs 9.9 episodes/3 weeks, p less than 0.01) and reduced nitroglycerin consumption (11.7 vs 7.5 tablets/3 weeks, p less than 0.05); while in patients with classic exertional angina, nifedipine had no symptomatic effect (7.9 vs 6.8 anginal episodes/3 weeks, NS; 6.4 vs 5.8 nitroglycerin tablets/3 weeks, NS). Patients in both groups experienced a significant decrease in the manifestations of ischemia during exercise testing. Patients with mixed angina experienced a reduction in the daily frequency of painful episodes of ST segment depression during nifedipine treatment compared to placebo (0.6 vs 0.2 episodes, p less than 0.05), but there was no effect on the frequency of episodes of silent ischemia (4.2 vs 3.4 episodes, NS). In patients with classic exertional angina, the addition of nifedipine had no effect on any measure of ambulatory ischemia. We conclude that patients with mixed angina are more likely to benefit symptomatically from the addition of nifedipine therapy than patients with classic exertional angina. The lack of a consistently preferential response to nifedipine in patients with mixed angina, however, suggests that episodic coronary vasoconstriction may not be the only mechanism responsible for ischemia in these patients, and/or that nifedipine may not necessarily provide additional therapeutic benefit beyond that conferred by a regimen of beta blockers and/or nitrates.", 
    "51": "beta-Adrenergic receptor (beta AR) blocking agents with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) can induce modest increases in beta AR-stimulated activity, such as rate and force of contraction in cardiac tissue. The molecular basis for this activity has been elusive. Previous studies have suggested that these compounds do not stimulate cyclic AMP (cAMP) formation even though activation of adenylate cyclase is the generally accepted mechanism for beta AR promotion of target cell response. In the current studies, we show that several beta AR antagonists with ISA (dichloroisoproterenol, pindolol, and celiprolol) stimulate cAMP accumulation five-, two-, and threefold, respectively, in S49 lymphoma cells, but only if cells are simultaneously incubated with the diterpene forskolin. The KI values observed for inhibition of isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP accumulation or of beta AR [( 125I]iodocyanopindolol) binding for each of the beta blockers with ISA were comparable in magnitude to their respective EC50 values for forskolin-potentiated cAMP accumulation. The forskolin-potentiated responses of these compounds were abolished by the beta AR-antagonist propranolol. These results indicate that the ISA of beta-blocking drugs most likely results from a modest beta AR-mediated stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity. The results further suggest that treatment of target cells with forskolin provides a means to define partial agonism at receptors that are linked to stimulation of adenylate cyclase.", 
    "52": "During the past decade, the therapy for stable angina pectoris has greatly expanded with the introduction of the calcium-channel blockers. Initially studied as monotherapy, these agents have been regularly used in combination with other antianginal medications, most notably the beta-adrenergic blockers. Although there are pharmacologic rationales for combining these agents, in daily practice, the major impetus for combination therapy is continuing angina during monotherapy. At least one well-conducted double-blind study was done to confirm that diltiazem, verapamil, and nifedipine each can markedly improve both subjective and objective measures of efficacy when used in combination with a beta-blocker. However, individual patient responses are of chief importance. Many persons do better with monotherapy than with combination treatment. The offsetting hemodynamic effects of nifedipine and a beta-blocker generally work well together; however, minor side effects are not infrequent. In the patient with underlying conduction system disease, this combination is clearly preferable. Diltiazem with a beta-blocker is usually well-tolerated, with a low incidence of adverse effects, similar to the experience with diltiazem monotherapy. Verapamil in conjunction with a beta-blocker warrants the greatest concern; approximately 10% to 15% of patients will have significant bradycardia, heart block, hypotension, or congestive failure. When these agents are used concurrently, reduced dosages, especially of the beta-blocker, will likely result in a lower incidence of adverse effects with maintained efficacy.", 
    "53": "6264 hours of ambulatory ST segment monitoring of 150 unselected patients with proven coronary artery disease, who were off all routine anti-anginal treatments, showed 598 ischaemic episodes, of which 446 (75%) were silent (symptom-free). Most (68%) ischaemic episodes occurred between 0730 and 1930, with a peak in the morning and a lesser peak in the evening. Two subgroups were studied further in double-blind controlled trials: 33 patients had a total of 1313 hours of ST segment monitoring while treated with nifedipine; and 41 patients a total of 1581 hours while treated with atenolol. Nifedipine did not alter the circadian pattern of ischaemic episodes; atenolol abolished the morning peak, and the peak incidence of ischaemia then occurred in the evening. Circadian patterns for total duration of ischaemic episodes corresponded closely to those of episodes of ischaemia, and were similarly altered by treatment. The circadian pattern of silent ischaemic episodes and their total duration were very similar to those of total ischaemia for the group as a whole and the different subgroups. This circadian distribution of ischaemic episodes and the observed changes with treatment resemble the reported circadian variation of acute myocardial infarction and sudden death.", 
    "54": "The distribution of beta-adrenergic receptor sites has been studied in chicken spinal cord and cerebellum using a fluorescent analogue of propranolol, 9-amino-acridin-propranolol (9-AAP). In the cervical and lumbar regions of the spinal cord, beta-adrenoceptor sites were concentrated on cell bodies of alpha-motor neurons of the dorsolateral and ventrolateral nuclear groups of the ventral horn. In the thoracic region, they were present on cell bodies of the preganglionic sympathetic nucleus (dorsal commissural nucleus). In the dorsal horn, the receptor sites were present mainly on cell bodies of columna dorsalis magnocellularis. Sparse distribution of fluorescence was present in other regions of the gray matter. In the cerebellum, a dense distribution of beta-adrenergic receptor sites was observed on Purkinje cell bodies and their apical dendrites. Sparse distribution of receptor sites was present on fine ramifications of Purkinje cell dendrites in the molecular layer. Receptor sites were absent in the granule cell layer and the white matter. These observations indicate that alpha-motor neurons, preganglionic sympathetic neurons, neurons of columna dorsalis magnocellularis, and Purkinje cells are adrenoceptive, while granule cells are non-adrenoceptive.", 
    "55": "In isolated papillary muscles of guinea pigs, the influence of isoproterenol, histamine, theophylline, and phenylephrine on the maximal rate of rise (Vmax) of Na+-dependent action potentials and on isometric contractile force was studied under rested state conditions. Isoproterenol (1 x 10(-7) mol/L), histamine (2 x 10(-5) mol/L), and theophylline (2 x 10(-3) mol/L) shifted the voltage dependence of Vmax into the hyperpolarizing direction and, consequently, led to a voltage-dependent Vmax blockade. The alpha-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine, on the other hand, proved to be ineffective in depressing Vmax. The beta-receptor blocker pindolol (4 x 10(-6) mol/L) or the H2-receptor blocker cimetidine (4 x 10(-5) mol/L) abolished the inhibitory effects of isoproterenol and histamine, respectively, and caused Vmax to return to the initial control value. A concentration-response relationship analysis at -65 mV revealed that isoproterenol exerted only a weak inhibitory effect on Vmax compared with its positive inotropic action. The IC50 value of the former effect amounted to approximately 5 x 10(-6) mol/L, but the EC50 value of the latter effect was 4 x 10(-8) mol/L. It is, therefore, concluded that, in physiologically relevant concentrations, beta-adrenergic agonists are unlikely to significantly modulate Na+-dependent excitability even in partially depolarized myocardium.", 
    "56": "Experiments were performed on isolated rat soleus and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles of 4-week-old rats. In the soleus, direct electrical stimulation for 10 min induced a frequency-dependent increase in the ouabain-suppressible 86Rb+ uptake, which was maximal (+110%) at a frequency of 2 Hz. In the EDL this frequency only induced a 31% increase. A supramaximal concentration of adrenaline (10 mumol l-1) stimulated ouabain-suppressible 86Rb+ uptake by 80% and 27% in soleus and EDL, respectively. The combined effect of stimulation at 2 Hz and adrenaline was not significantly larger than each of the interventions alone in either of the muscles. The fractional loss of 22Na+ from soleus muscle was increased by around 50% by the exposure to adrenaline, electrical stimulation at 2 Hz or a combination of both. The effect of electrical stimulation on 22Na+ efflux was not prevented by addition of propranolol (1 or 10 mumol l-1). The results indicate that the stimulation of active Na+-K+ transport induced by adrenaline or electrical stimulation is much more pronounced in soleus (slow-twitch) muscle than in EDL (fast-twitch) muscle. Since it has been suggested that an accumulation of K+ ions in the extracellular space may play a role in the development of fatigue (Bigland-Ritchie 1984), our findings might be related to the fact that slow-twitch muscles have a much higher resistance to fatigue than fast-twitch muscles (Burke et al. 1971).", 
    "57": "Previous reports suggest that A1 noradrenergic projections to the hypothalamus may have stimulatory or inhibitory effects on the release of luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LH-RH), depending upon the steroid environment of the rat. In the present study, we reevaluated the effects of electrical stimulation (ES) of the A1 cell group on LH release in estrogen-primed, ovariectomized rats which had been anesthetized with chloral hydrate. This anesthetic blocked spontaneous LH surges which normally occur in estrogen-treated ovariectomized rats. ES of the A1 cell group in chloral hydrate treated rats failed to alter basal LH concentrations. Therefore, we evaluate the effects of A1-ES on LH release in rats in which prior electrochemical stimulation (ECS) of the medial preoptic nucleus (MPN) was performed. Bilateral MPN-ECS induced a significant increase in plasma LH. When the A1 cell group was unilaterally stimulated (1 mA) for 15 min, beginning 30 min after MPN-ECS, peak LH concentrations were significantly augmented with peak values being reached at 60 min. Thereafter, plasma LH declined from 75 to 180 min towards basal levels. In a second experiment, unilateral MPN-ECS was performed, and 30 min later either the ipsilateral or contralateral A1 cell group was ES. When MPN + A1 were stimulated on the ipsilateral side of the brain, no amplification in LH release occurred above that obtained after only MPN-ECS. In contrast, contralateral A1-ES markedly amplified LH release, suggesting that most stimulatory A1 fibers decussate to reach contralateral LH-RH neurons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "58": "The effects of extracellular ATP on intracellular free calcium concentration [( Ca2+]i), phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) turnover, amylase release and Ca2+-activated membrane currents were examined in isolated rat parotid acinar cells and contrasted with the effects of receptor agonists known to activate phospholipase C. ATP was more effective than muscarinic and alpha-adrenergic agonists and substance P as a stimulus for elevating [Ca2+]i (as measured with quin2). The ATP effect was selectively antagonized by pretreating parotid cells with the impermeant anion-exchange blocker 4,4'-di-isothiocyano-2,2'-stilbenedisulphonate (DIDS), which also inhibited binding of [alpha-32P]ATP to parotid cells. By elevating [Ca2+]i, ATP and the muscarinic agonist carbachol both activated Ca2+-sensitive membrane currents, which were measured by whole-cell and cell-attached patch-clamp recordings. However, there were marked contrasts between the effects of ATP and the receptor agonists linked to phospholipase C, as follows. (1) Although the combination of maximally effective concentrations of carbachol, substance P and phenylephrine had no greater effect on [Ca2+]i than did carbachol alone, there was some additivity between maximal ATP and carbachol effects. (2) Intracellular dialysis with guanosine 5'-[beta-thio]diphosphate did not block activation of ion channels by ATP, but did block channel activation by the muscarinic agonist carbachol. This suggests that a G-protein is involved in the muscarinic response, but not in the response to ATP. (3) Despite its pronounced effect on [Ca2+]i, ATP had little effect on PtdIns turnover in these cells, in contrast with the effects of carbachol and other Ca2+-mobilizing agents. (4) Although ATP was able to stimulate amylase release from parotid acinar cells, the stimulation was only 33 +/- 9% of that obtained with phospholipase C-linked receptor agonists. These differences suggest that ATP increases [Ca2+]i through specific activation of a pathway which is distinct from that shared by the classical phospholipase C-linked receptor agonists.", 
    "59": "In vitro autoradiography was used to determine the binding properties and distribution of 9 major neurotransmitter receptors and their subtypes in the striate (area 17 of Brodmann) and extrastriate (areas 18 and 19) cortex of 1 infant and 3 adult rhesus monkeys. Differences in total labeling and nonspecific labeling, as well as Kd and Bmax values, were determined for all cortical layers and sublayers in both cytoarchitectonic areas by Scatchard analysis of autoradiograms. Area 17 differed from area 18 in the laminar pattern and density of virtually every ligand examined, i.e., 3H-clonidine, 3H-prazosin, 125I-iodopindolol, 3H-quinuclidinyl benzilate, 3H-5-hydroxytryptamine, 3H-ketanserin, 3H-muscimol, 3H-flunitrazepam, and 3H-spiperone. Kd and Bmax values for each ligand were remarkably consistent across the 3 adult monkeys analyzed quantitatively. Particularly dramatic contrasts were observed with clonidine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, and ketanserin, which have high affinity for alpha 2-adrenergic, 5-HT1-, and 5-HT2-receptors, respectively. The differences in distribution of these ligands, especially clonidine and 5-hydroxytryptamine, correlated well with specific laminae and hence exhibited distinctly different patterns in areas 17 and 18. Other ligands, such as flunitrazepam and quinuclidinyl benzilate that bind to GABAergic and cholinergic receptors, were visually less discriminating both among layers and between regions. However, layer for layer, the Bmax values for quinuclidinyl benzilate were higher in area 17 than 18, indicating the subtle differences between areas may be revealed only by quantitative measures. Some ligands were particularly dense in layer I (iodopindolol in areas 17 and 18; 5-hydroxytryptamine in area 18), and others subdivided cortical layers that are otherwise cytoarchitectonically uniform (e.g., flunitrazepam and clonidine in layer VI of area 17), indicating that areal differences in ligand binding are not a simple read-out of cell-packing density but most likely reflect a genuine difference related to the neurotransmitters of intrinsic and extrinsic afferents in each area. The presence of binding sites in every layer of both areas for all ligands examined indicates that their distribution across laminae is quantitative and not all-or-none. No layer contained less than 50% of binding sites present in any other layer. These findings reveal that visual cortical areas differ in density and lamination of neurotransmitter receptors and presumably in their sensitivity to circulating levels of endogenous neurotransmitters and pharmacologically active compounds.", 
    "60": "Exogenous prostaglandins (PGs) have been shown to have differing effects on frog lung contractility. In this study, prostaglandin synthesis was measured in lung tissues from warm-acclimated (WA, 22 degrees C) and cold-acclimated (CA, 5 degrees C) American bullfrogs, Rana catesbeiana, incubated for 30 min at 5 degrees or 22 degrees C. Media were assayed by radioimmunoassay for PGE2, PGF2 alpha, 6-keto PGF 1 alpha (the metabolite of PGI2), and thromboxane (TX)B2 (the metabolite of TXA2). PGE2 was produced in greatest quantity by tissues from WA and CA animals, at both incubation temperatures. Epinephrine stimulated PGE2, PGF2 alpha, and TXB2 synthesis at 22 degrees C but only stimulated PGE2 production at 5 degrees C. In tissues from CA frogs, epinephrine did not stimulate prostaglandin synthesis at either incubation temperature. Ibuprofen (10(-5) M) inhibited basal and epinephrine-stimulated prostaglandin synthesis in tissues from WA frogs incubated at 22 degrees C. The beta receptor antagonist propranolol (10(-6) M) blocked the epinephrine-stimulated synthesis of PGE2, PGF2 alpha and TXB2, suggesting epinephrine stimulates prostaglandin synthesis through beta receptor activation. The absence of stimulation by epinephrine in lung from CA animals, but not in 5 degrees C incubations of tissues from WA animals, suggests that a modification of beta receptors occurs during prolonged cold exposure.", 
    "61": "The ciliated epithelium of the mammalian trachea separates the neurohumoral milieu of the tissue from that of the environment of the airway lumen. To determine whether specific autonomic receptors regulating ciliary beat frequency (CBF) were located on mucosal or serosal sides, we measured CBF by heterodyne mode correlation analysis laser light scattering in bovine tracheal tissues mounted in a two-sided chamber. A beta 2-adrenergic agonist, fenoterol, at 10(-7) M, stimulated serosal CBF from 7.9 +/- 1.3 to 20.2 +/- 5.8 Hz (P less than 0.01) and mucosal CBF from 6.6 +/- 0.9 to 14.7 +/- 4.6 Hz (P less than 0.01). A muscarinic cholinergic agonist, methacholine, at 10(-7) M, increased mucosal CBF from 8.4 +/- 1.0 to 19.5 +/- 5.5 Hz (P less than 0.01) and serosal CBF from 8.0 +/- 0.9 to 15.4 +/- 5.0 Hz (P less than 0.01). The differences in stimulation of CBF on the mucosal and serosal sides between fenoterol and methacholine were significant (P less than 0.01). Studies in which these autonomic agonist stimulating effects were inhibited by their respective antagonists, propranolol and atropine sulfate, demonstrated that CBF can be regulated independently by mediators both in the submucosa and within the mucus lining.", 
    "62": "The purpose of this study was to determine the role of the autonomic nervous system's control of the heart in fitness-related differences in blood pressure regulation. The cardiovascular responses to progressive lower-body negative pressure (LBNP) were studied during unblocked (control) and full blockade (experimental) conditions in 10 endurance-trained (T) and 10 untrained (UT) men, aged 20-31 yr. The experimental conditions included beta 1-adrenergic blockade (metoprolol tartrate), parasympathetic blockade (atropine sulfate), or complete blockade (metoprolol and atropine). Heart rate, blood pressure, forearm blood flow, and cardiac output were measured at rest and -16 and -40 Torr LBNP. Forearm vascular resistance, peripheral vascular resistance, and stroke volume were calculated from these measurements at each stage of LBNP. Blood pressure was maintained, primarily by augmented vasoconstriction, equally in T and UT subjects during complete and atropine blockade. The fall in systolic and mean pressure from 0 to -40 Torr was greater (P less than 0.05) in the T subjects during the unblocked and metoprolol blockade conditions. This reduced blood pressure control during unblocked condition was attributable to attenuated vaso-constrictor and chronotropic responses in the T subjects. We hypothesize that an autonomic imbalance (elevated base-line parasympathetic activity) in highly trained subjects restricts reflex cardiac responses, which accompanied by an attenuated vasoconstrictor response, results in attenuated blood pressure control during a steady-state hypotensive stress.", 
    "63": "Angiotensin II (ANG II) decreases blood pressure of fowl. To characterize the vasodilating action of ANG II and its underlying mechanisms, we examined the effect of [Asp1, Val5]ANG II (fowl ANG II) on isometric tension of fowl aortic rings. [Val5]ANG II (10(-8) to 10(-5) M) produced rapid, reversible, dose-dependent relaxation of aortas precontracted with phenylephrine. [Sar1,Ile8]ANG II blocked ANG II-induced relaxation; propranolol, atropine, methysergid, pyrilamine, and cimetidine did not. Endothelium removal abolished relaxation responses to ANG II and acetylcholine but not to isoproterenol or sodium nitroprusside. Inhibitors of phospholipase or arachidonic acid metabolism (quinacrine, indomethacin, 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid, hydroquinone, metyrapone, SKF 525A) and a calcium channel blocker (verapamil) did not inhibit ANG II-induced relaxation, whereas indomethacin nearly completely blocked arachidonic acid-induced dilation of aortas with or without endothelia. Guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) levels in the aorta increased 15 s after ANG II application. Aortic relaxation was caused by 8-bromo-cGMP with or without intact endothelium. These results suggest that ANG II-induced relaxation of fowl aortas involves 1) an endothelium-dependent mechanism and 2) cGMP but not arachidonic acid metabolites.", 
    "64": "Respiratory alkalosis results in a resistance to the phosphaturic effect of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP). The present studies evaluated the role of the beta-adrenergic system in that resistance phenomenon. In clearance experiments on acutely thyroparathyroidectomized male Wistar rats, respiratory alkalosis blunted the PTH-mediated increase in absolute and fractional excretion of phosphate (FEPi). Propranolol infusion restored the phosphaturic response to PTH:FEPi, 0.8 +/- 0.3 vs. 8.1 +/- 2.5% (P less than 0.005). Similarly, the increase of FEPi during cAMP infusion was also diminished by respiratory alkalosis: FEPi, 15.5 +/- 2.2 vs. 5.5 +/- 1.1% (P less than 0.005). This hypophosphaturic effect of respiratory alkalosis in the presence of cAMP was not observed in rats infused with propranolol compared with the period of normal ventilation: FEPi, 21.1 +/- 1.7 vs. 15.3 +/- 1.6 (P less than 0.02). Also, during the infusion of the highly selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, ICI 118,551, cAMP was phosphaturic in respiratory alkalosis compared with FEPi in the absence of the antagonist: FEPi, 13.0 +/- 2.5 vs. 5.5 +/- 1.1% (P less than 0.02). Finally, the infusion of the beta 2-agonist, fenoterol, to the normally ventilated rats significantly decreased FEPi in cAMP-infused rats in comparison to the absence of the agonist: FEPi, 4.0 +/- 0.7 vs. 22.1 +/- 2.6% (P less than 0.001). We conclude that the resistance to the phosphaturic effect of PTH and cAMP in respiratory alkalosis is mediated by beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "65": "The effects of intravenously and intrahypothalamically administered alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists on exercise-induced alterations in blood glucose, plasma free fatty acids (FFA), and insulin were investigated in rats. Exercise consisted of strenuous swimming against a counter current for 15 min. Before, during, and after swimming, blood samples were withdrawn through a permanent heart catheter. Intravenous administration of the alpha-blocker phentolamine led to a reduction in glucose and a substantial increase in insulin levels. Infusion of phentolamine through permanent bilateral cannulas into either the ventromedial or lateral area of the hypothalamus (VMH and LHA, respectively) completely prevented the increase in glucose while the decline in insulin was unaffected. Infusion of phentolamine into the VMH caused much higher plasma FFA levels than in controls. The beta-blocker timolol given intravenously caused a delayed increase in glucose and prevented the increase in FFA. Infusion of timolol into either VMH or LHA caused a delay in the increase in both glucose and FFA. The results suggest that 1) both peripheral and hypothalamic adrenoceptors are involved in energy metabolism during exercise and 2) FFA, glucose, and insulin concentrations in blood are independently regulated by VMH and LHA.", 
    "66": "This report describes electron microscopic localization of the beta-adrenergic receptor using a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist conjugated to ferritin. The conjugate was synthesized by reacting a carboxylic acid derivative of alprenolol with ferritin. The ferritin-alprenolol compound was shown to be effective in displacing specific [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding from rat erythrocyte membranes with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 25 nM. Rat erythrocyte ghosts were incubated with the compound and quantitative electron micrographic analysis yielded total binding of 1367 +/- 129 ferritin particles and nonspecific binding of 688 +/- 111 (six experiments). Thus, specific binding was 680 +/- 60 ferritin particles per red cell profile. Qualitative observations suggested that the particles were distributed randomly on the surface of the erythrocyte, although an occasional cluster was seen. A compound from another synthesis was shown be to effective in displacing specific [125I]iodocyanopindolol binding from neonatal rat cardiac myocyte membranes, with a dissociation constant of 13.8 nM, whereas native alprenolol had a dissociation constant of 1.3 nM. Neonatal rat cardiac myocytes were incubated with the compound and processed for electron microscopy. Total binding along the sarcolemmal membrane was 504 +/- 38 ferritin particles/100 micron of membrane and nonspecific binding was 301 +/- 26 ferritin particles/100 micron of membrane (seven experiments), yielding specific binding of 203 ferritin particles/100 micron of membrane. In additional studies, specific binding was inhibited 95% with 10(-5) M l-isoproterenol and 29% with d-isoproterenol, indicating stereoselectivity (seven experiments). The probe was distributed randomly along the sarcolemma with no preferential localization to coated pits or other membrane specializations. From measurements of the surface area of the average cardiac myocyte (732 micron 2), the specific binding of ferritin-alprenolol per 100 micron of membrane (203), and section thickness (0.08 micron), we calculated that cardiac myocytes had 18,575 beta-adrenergic membrane receptor sites. Thus, we have described a method for synthesizing and applying an electron-dense probe for electron microscopic localization of beta-adrenergic receptors. In these studies we determined the distribution of these receptors on rat erythrocyte ghosts and neonatal rat cardiac myocytes.", 
    "67": "The purpose of this study was to quantitatively examine to what extent acute exertion diminishes the activity of beta-adrenergic receptors through diminishing coupling. Normal neutrophil membrane preparations containing beta 2-adrenergic receptors were obtained from healthy human volunteers, then exposed to autologous venous plasma obtained before and after acute forearm exertion. There was an acute, dramatic diminution in coupling (P less than .003) after only a few minutes of exercise. Preexertion plasma had no significant effect upon coupling. Substantial diminution in beta-adrenergic receptor sensitivity is thus acutely demonstrable in this model which serves as a model for both metabolic acidosis and acute exertion.", 
    "68": "The study of chemical and biological effects of fluorine substitution on the aromatic ring of catecholamines has now been extended to epinephrine (Epi). 2- and 6-fluoroepinephrines (2-FEpi and 6-FEpi) have been synthesized. Fluorine substitution on the 2- or 6-carbon of the aromatic ring alters the selectivity of epinephrine toward alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors, similar in manner to the change in selectivity seen with norepinephrine (NE). Thus, 2-FEpi is a relatively selective beta-adrenergic ligand, while 6-FEpi is a relatively selective alpha-adrenergic ligand. Fluorine substitution of Epi also can markedly increase potency at either alpha- or beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "69": "This study compares the regulation of the subtypes of central beta adrenoceptors produced by treatment of rats with desipramine (10 mg/kg i.p. twice daily for 10 days) to that caused by central infusion of l-isoproterenol (5 micrograms/hr for 7 days). Beta adrenoceptors were measured by quantitative autoradiography of the binding of [125I]iodopindolol ([125I]IPIN) to coronal sections of rat brain as well as the binding of this radioligand to homogenates of certain areas of brain. Administration of desipramine caused significant reductions in the total specific binding of [125I]IPIN in many areas of the brain, including regions of the amygdala, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus and thalamus. This reduction in the total specific binding of [125I]IPIN was primarily the result of a reduction in its binding to beta-1 adrenoceptors in most brain regions. With the exception of the paraventricular nuclei of the thalamus, no desipramine-induced change in the binding of [125I]IPIN to beta-2 adrenoceptors was observed in any region of the brain. Treatment of rats with desipramine did not alter the binding of [125I]IPIN to the caudate putamen, globus pallidus or the cerebellum. Intracerebroventricular fusion of the nonselective beta adrenoceptor agonist, isoproterenol, reduced the maximum binding site density of the binding of [125I]IPIN to homogenates of cerebellum and hypothalamus, but not to homogenates of cerebral cortex. Autoradiography of the binding of [125I]IPIN to brain sections from rats treated with isoproterenol revealed reductions in many subcortical areas and the cerebellum. In contrast to the effects produced by treatment with desipramine, reductions in the binding of [125I]IPIN after infusions of isoproterenol were a result of a decrease in the binding of [125I]IPIN to beta-2 adrenoceptors in most brain regions. Infusion of isoproterenol reduced the binding of [125I]IPIN to beta-2 adrenoceptors in 10 areas of brain in which the binding of the ligand to beta-1 adrenoceptors was not affected significantly. Inasmuch as there is a selective regulation of beta-1 adrenoceptors by the norepinephrine uptake blocker, desipramine, it may be inferred that these receptors are under the influence of endogenous norepinephrine. By contrast, the density of central beta-2 adrenoceptors are regulated more easily by an exogenous beta adrenoceptor agonist, even one like isoproterenol which is a full agonist at both beta-1 and beta-2 adrenoceptors.", 
    "70": "Since both glucocorticoids and catecholamines are involved in the regulation of normal blood pressure, we investigated the modulation of beta-adrenergic receptors of cultured rat arterial smooth muscle cells by glucocorticoids. The synthetic glucocorticoids dexamethasone and RU 28362, at 10(-8) M concentration, increased maximum beta-adrenergic binding but had no effect on the dissociation constant (Kd). Each steroid caused an increase in maximum [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding over the concentration range of 10(-8) to 10(-6) M, but not at 10(-9) M. The glucocorticoid effect on beta-adrenergic receptors of arterial smooth muscle cells required a minimum of 20 hours of incubation in the presence of the steroid and was significantly inhibited by cycloheximide (10 micrograms/ml), indicating that the glucocorticoid effect required protein synthesis. The effect of dexamethasone on [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding was significantly inhibited by the glucocorticoid antagonist RU 38486. Basal and agonist-stimulated cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) levels in arterial smooth muscle cells, before and after glucocorticoid treatment, were measured as an indicator of the physiological significance of the observed glucocorticoid-induced increase in beta-adrenergic receptor binding. While causing no change in the basal cAMP level, treatment of arterial smooth muscle cells with 10(-6) M dexamethasone for 24 hours increased the 10(-6) M isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP levels.", 
    "71": "The mechanisms by which insulin and catecholamines affect low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-receptor activity were studied in freshly isolated human mononuclear leukocytes. Incubation of cells for up to 24 h in a lipid-free medium resulted in an increase in the specific binding, accumulation, and degradation of 125I-labeled LDL. Insulin stimulated the ability of the cells to bind, accumulate, and degrade the lipoprotein with high affinity, which may be caused by an increase in the LDL-receptor number without altering binding affinity. (-)-Epinephrine inhibited the specific binding, accumulation, and degradation of 125I-LDL. This effect appears to be mediated by a decrease in the number of LDL receptors and not by a change in the binding affinity. (-)-Norepinephrine, the unspecific beta-adrenergic agonist (-)-isoproterenol, and the beta 2-specific agonist terbutaline mimicked the effect of epinephrine on LDL-receptor activity. Catecholamines and beta-adrenergic agonists yielded sigmoidal log-concentration effect curves. The action of epinephrine was attenuated by the beta-antagonist (dl)-propranolol. These results demonstrate that insulin stimulates and catecholamines suppress the specific binding, accumulation, and degradation of 125I-LDL in human mononuclear leukocytes. The catecholamine action appears to be mediated by beta 2-adrenergic receptors. A suppression of LDL-receptor activity resulting from deficiency of insulin and elevated plasma catecholamine concentrations in uncontrolled insulin-dependent diabetic patients may contribute to the increased levels of LDL cholesterol observed in these patients.",

Other effects (increase in heart rate blood pressure and enhanced atrioventricular conduction) were thought to be due to a release of endogenous catecholamines. To investigate the non-catecholamine-mediated effects of bethanidine, we administered 10 mg/kg i.v. bethanidine to eight neonatal puppies ages 6-14 days pretreated with 0.6 mg/kg of propranolol and compared them with a control group of six neonates that received propranolol followed by a placebo. In the bethanidine group, the mean atrial effective and functional refractory periods increased significantly from 58 to 109 ms and from 108 to 185 ms, respectively (p less than 0.0001). Bethanidine also caused a decrease in resting heart rate (from 154 beats/min postpropranolol to 144 beats/min postbethanidine, p less than 0.002). These effects were not observed in the placebo group. Wenckebach periodicity during incremental atrial pacing did not change significantly. There was a modest increase in the ventricular refractory periods following bethanidine. Thus, the direct electrophysiologic effects of bethanidine in the neonate include a significant prolongation of atrial refractoriness and a decrease in sinus node automaticity. Ventricular refractory periods, while increased, did not show the dramatic prolongation exhibited by the atrium. The atrial specificity of bethanidine is unique and may prove useful in the treatment of supraventricular arrhythmias in the neonatal period.", 
    "73": "The effect of the intrathecal administration of neuropeptide Y (NPY) on blood pressure and heart rate of anesthetized normotensive and hypertensive rats was studied. Neuropeptide Y was observed to produce a decrease in the blood pressure of Sprague-Dawley, Wistar Kyoto (WKY), DOCA-salt, and DOCA-sham control rats. The maximum percent decrease in blood pressure of Sprague-Dawley rats was 12.8 and 15.2% in response to 0.1 and 1.0 nmol NPY, respectively. Similar changes in heart rate were observed. The depressor effect of intrathecal NPY was attenuated by prior treatment with yohimbine and propranolol but not prazosin. The depressor effect of intrathecal NPY observed in normotensive and DOCA-salt hypertensive rats was not seen in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). The studies extend to the spinal cord the list of regions and tissues where NPY can produce physiological effects. It is concluded that the effects of NPY are closely associated with sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the spinal cord that the depressor effect of NPY involves alpha 2 and beta adrenoceptors, and that a loss of the depressor effect of NPY may contribute to the development or maintenance of hypertension in the SHR.", 
    "74": "The antihypertensive effect and safety of doxazosin once-daily was compared with that of atenolol once-daily in 40 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. During the first 4 weeks all patients received placebo therapy. During the subsequent 10 weeks patients were randomized to doxazosin or atenolol treatment. Treatment was initiated with 1 mg doxazosin or 50 mg atenolol once-daily. The dose could be doubled biweekly until a final dose of 16 mg doxazosin or 100 mg atenolol was reached. The average final dose of doxazosin was 6.4 +/- 0.8 mg (SEM) and that of atenolol 66.7 +/- 5.7 mg. During the 10 weeks of active treatment, the systolic and diastolic blood pressure tended to be lower (p less than 0.05) in patients on atenolol, this difference was however not significant for the standing blood pressure. Recumbent and standing heart rate were lower (p less than 0.01) during atenolol. Multiple regression analysis showed that in the doxazosin group the recumbent systolic blood pressure after 10 weeks of treatment was significantly (p less than 0.05) and independently related to age, recumbent systolic blood pressure at randomization, and the changes in recumbent heart rate. In neither group severe adverse reactions were observed. However, two patients on doxazosin dropped out of the study: one because of blurred vision and persistent high blood pressure, and one because of fatigue and palpitations. No patient dropped out of the atenolol group during the study.", 
    "75": "The effects of 5-hydroxypropafenone (5-OH-P) on transmembrane action potentials were studied in isolated guinea pig papillary muscles. 5-Hydroxypropafenone, 10(-7) M to 5 X 10(-5) M, produced a dose-dependent decrease in the Vmax and amplitude of the action potential and a depolarization of the resting membrane potential, whereas the action potential duration was not affected by the drug. In the presence of 5-OH-P, trains of stimuli at rates between 0.2 and 2 Hz led to an exponential decline in Vmax (onset rate at 1 Hz 0.07 +/- 0.01 per action potential) to a new steady-state level. This phasic, use-dependent Vmax block was augmented at higher stimulation frequencies. The time constant for the recovery of Vmax from the phasic block (offset) was 200.0 +/- 9.3 s. In papillary muscles depolarized with 10 mM K the inhibitory effect of 5-OH-P on Vmax of the first action potential after a long quiescent period (tonic block) was markedly increased, but the rates of onset and offset of the phasic block were similar to those found in normally polarized fibers under 5.4 mM K. 5-OH-P also shifted the curves relating membrane potential and Vmax in the hyperpolarizing direction. These findings suggest that 5-OH-P exhibited similar phasic inhibitory action of the fast sodium channels than other class Ic antiarrhythmic drugs. This phasic Vmax block, and its greater inhibition of Vmax in depolarized muscles through the increase of tonic block, would play a major role for the antiarrhythmic effect of the drug."
