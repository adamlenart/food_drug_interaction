    "0": "Direct effects of adrenergic stimuli on coronary vessels in dogs were compared with effects on vessels to skin (hind paw) and skeletal muscle (gracilis muscle) after intravenous administration of practolol (2 mg/kg), a selective myocardial beta receptor blocker which minimized indirect effects of myocardial stimulation on coronary vascular resistance. The left circumflex coronary, cranial tibial, and gracilis arteries were perfused separately but simultaneously at constant flow. Perfusion pressures, left ventricular pressure and dP/dt. and heart rate were recorded. Changes in perfusion pressure to each bed reflected changes in vascular resistance. The direct constrictor effects of sympathetic nerve stimulation, norepinephrine and phenylephrine on coronary vessels were minimal compared with effects on cutaneous and muscular vessels. Subsequent blockade of vascular beta receptors did not augment the constrictor responses. Angiotensin, a nonadrenergic stimulus, produced striking coronary vasoconstriction which exceeded that in skin and approximated that in muscle. These results suggests that there is a paucity of alpha adrenergic receptors in coronary vessels compared to cutaneous and muscular vessels. Direct dilator responses to isoproterenol were similar in coronary and cutaneous vessels, but were greater in muscular vessels. Responses to glyceryl trinitrate, a nonadrenergic dilator, also were greater in skeletal muscle. Therefore, differences in effects of isoproterenol on the three beds may reflect differences in reactivity to dilator stimuli rather than differences in the density of beta receptors. In contrast to norepinephrine, the predominant direct effect of epinephrine on coronary vessels was dilatation mediated through activation of vascular beta receptors. A constrictor effect caused by stimulation of alpha receptors was unmasked by propranolol.Finally, the order of potency of agonists in stimulating coronary vascular beta receptors and the demonstration of selective beta receptor blockade with practolol suggest that beta receptors in coronary vessels resemble those in peripheral vessels more than those in myocardium.", 
    "1": "1. The alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blocking action of AH 5158A was investigated in man using the veins of the hand, the arterial bed of the forearm, and certain responses of the circulation as a whole.2. In the veins, locally infused AH 5158A resulted in specific and competitive antagonism of the constrictor response to locally infused noradrenaline and of the dilator response to isoprenaline.3. Brachial artery infusions of AH 5158A resulted in competitive antagonism of the arterial blood flow changes produced by local infusions of noradrenaline and isoprenaline.4. Systemic infusion of AH 5158A (0.5-0.9 mg/kg) produced clear blockade of the heart rate response to systemic infusion of isoprenaline. It also attenuated the response to exercise at 80 watts for 4 min; mean arterial pressure during exercise was reduced by 16% and heart rate by 18%. Blockade lasted at least 1 hour.5. AH 5158A caused small changes in arterial pressure and heart rate at rest supine, but had no effect on the response of pressure and rate to tilting.", 
    "2": "1. Localized distension of the junction between the superior vena cava and the right atrium without obstructing venous return caused an increase in heart rate.2. This increase in heart rate was a reflex response; the afferent path was in the vagi and the efferent solely in the sympathetic nerves.3. The receptors most likely to be stimulated by the distension of the junction between the superior vena cava and the right atrium are the right atrial receptors located on the endocardial surface of the intrapericardial portion of the superior vena caval-right atrial junction.", 
    "3": "1. Electrophysiological techniques were utilized to study the mechanisms underlying adrenergic inhibition in the urinary bladder of the cat.2. It has been shown that catecholamines administered by close intraarterial injection or released endogenously by electrical stimulation of the hypogastric nerves elicit two distinct inhibitory responses in the bladder: (1) a direct depression of the vesical smooth muscle and (2) a depression of transmission in vesical parasympathetic ganglia.3. Pharmacological studies revealed that the inhibitory mechanisms were mediated via different adrenergic receptors: beta-receptors on the smooth muscle and alpha-receptors in the parasympathetic ganglia.4. We have been unable, however, to demonstrate that either of these mechanisms is activated by naturally occurring sympathetic firing."
