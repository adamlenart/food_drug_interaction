    "0": "This paper describes a method for determining whether beta-blocking agents reduce myocardial oxygen consumption by a direct action on the myocardium in addition to that reduction produced by changes in cardiac mechanical function. Measurements of myocardial oxygen consumption were made in anaesthetized dogs . Changes in heart rate were produced by atropine and by ventricular pacing. Alterations in ventricular loading were achieved by balloon inflations in the descending aorta and by infusions of nitroprusside and dextran. Measurements under these conditions were repeated after beta-blockade. Analysis required the separation of the part of reduced myocardial oxygen consumption resulting from the mechanical effects of beta-blockade from any possible additional direct effect on the myocardium. There was no evidence for a significant direct effect. The average overall reduction in myocardial oxygen consumption after beta-blockade was 18% but the estimated reduction not accountable to mechanical effects was only 2% (range, 95% probability, -7% to 3%).", 
    "1": "1 Physiological studies support the possibility of adrenergic regulation of aqueous humor secretion from the ciliary process, a tissue which has recently been shown to contain a predominance of beta 2-adrenoceptors. 2 The present experiments examine the effects of a potent and highly specific beta 2-antagonist (IPS 339) on intraocular pressure in the normal rabbit eye. 3 The observed decrease in pressure caused by IPS 339 suggests that highly specific beta 2-antagonists may be useful in decreasing elevated intraocular pressure.", 
    "2": "1 Changes in hepatic blood flow have been estimated by measurement of single-dose indocyanine green kinetics in groups of healthy individuals. 2 The effects of change in posture, exercise and ingestion of milk on estimated hepatic blood flow have been assessed. 3 The erect posture and exercise significantly decreased ICG clearance. However, no consistent change was noted after ingestion of milk. 4 The effects of the adrenoceptor blocking drugs phenoxybenzamine, propranolol and labetalol on hepatic blood flow were also assessed. 5 Propranolol and labetalol caused a significant fall in ICG clearance in the supine position. Phenoxybenzamine did not show a consistent change. 6 Posture, exercise and adrenoceptor blockade appear to be important variables affecting hepatic blood flow. They should be considered when kinetics of high-clearance drugs are measured, and may provide a useful model for the assessment of the effects of alterations in hepatic blood flow on the clearance of drugs.", 
    "3": "In 14 healthy physical education students the effect of acute beta 1-adrenergic blockade (100 mg metoprolol) on maximal and prolonged exercise capacity, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, catecholamines, insulin, growth hormone, and cortisol was studied in a double-blind trial. Metoprolol had no effect on maximal oxygen uptake. The 3.5% reduction of maximal exercise capacity had to be attributed to the reduced maximal lactate concentration. Maximal heart rate was reduced by approximately 22%. At submaximal work loads (treadmill) exercise with gradually increasing velocity), lipolysis appeared to be inhibited, arterial glucose and lactate concentrations were unaffected. With metoprolol, epinephrine levels at rest and submaximal work loads were elevated; no effect was apparent at maximal loads. Norepinephrine, insulin, growth hormone, and cortisol were unaffected in exercise with increasing work loads. In prolonged exercise at a constant load of approximately 70% of maximal exercise capacity, mean heart rate was reduced by 26%. Arterial lactate and glucose levels were essentially unchanged, free fatty acids and glycerol decreased by 50 and 30% respectively. With metoprolol, epinephrine increased by 100%, norepinephrine by 50% growth hormone by 60%, and cortisol by 90%, insulin remained unchanged. The results indicate that a reduction of exercise capacity by beta 1-adrenergic blockade in patients undergoing an endurance type training for therapeutic or rehabilitative purposes is unlikely to occur. The inhibition of lipolysis under metoprolol appears to be counteracted by the increased carbohydrate utilisation and by the increased secretion of the regulating hormones.", 
    "4": "The dose-dependent haemodynamic effects and pharmacokinetics and parenteral prenalterol (0.5-10 microgram/kg/min), a new cardioselective beta-1-adrenoceptor agonist, have been studied in 10 healthy volunteers by computed echocardiography. Prenalterol induced a dose-dependent strong and persistent increase in contractility (FV 46%, VCF70 64%, STI 12%), heart index (46%) and heart rate (27%) and a moderate not significant decrease in VED (14%). Afterload and mean arterial blood pressure was nearly unaltered. The hemodynamically effective threshold concentration of prenalterol in plasma was 20-30 nmol/l, the mean value of maximum concentration 493 nmol/l; 1 hour after stopping the infusion prenalterol plasma level was about 90 nmol/l. A strong linear correlation between the haemodynamic alterations and the logarithm of prenalterol plasma concentrations was not apparent.", 
    "5": "Important prerequisites in the treatment of arterial hypertension are presented. The mechanisms of action leading to reduction of blood pressure by various drug groups are described. Special emphasis is placed on side-effects induced by different antihypertensive agents which necessitate a combination therapy with diuretics. In addition a step by step approach in antihypertensive therapy is given with the aim of reducing side-effects during treatment.", 
    "6": "The properties of a new antihypertensive agent, bucindolol, were studied in the anaesthetized rat. When administered intravenously in the dose range 0.03 to 1.0 mg/kg, bucindolol evoked dose-related decreases in mean arterial blood pressure wtih relatively little change in heart rate. Bucindolol retained nearly 50% of its hypotensive activity after ganglionic blockage with pentolinium. When administered intravenously in a dose of 0.25 mg/kg, bucindolol caused approximately 1000-fold and 100-fold shifts to the right in the dose-response curves for isoprenaline-induced chronotropic activity and hypotensive activity, respectively. The same dose of bucindolol caused a decrease in pressor responsivity to angiotensin II, no significant change in that to noradrenaline, and an increase in that to adrenaline. Bucindolol was an effective hypotensive agent, which under the conditions of test, had relatively little effect on basal heart rate, exhibited no significant alpha-adrenoceptor blocking activity in the dose range tested, had potent beta-adrenoceptor blocking properties, and exhibited an apparent direct relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle.", 
    "7": "The effect of an oral alpha/beta blocker on serum lipids was studied over a 6-month period of administration to patients with essential hypertension. Serum free fatty acid level was lower after 1 month than initially but not after 3 and 6 months. There were no significant changes in the concentrations of total cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol or in the ratio of HDL-cholesterol to total cholesterol during therapy. Serum triglycerides increased from 1.9 +/- 1.1 mmol/1 to 2.6 +/- 1.5 mmol/1 at 3 months and to 2.5 +/- 1.6 mmol/1 at 6 months, but this increase was significant only at 3 months (p less than 0.05).", 
    "8": "The preejection period (PEP) of the fetal cardiac cycle was studied in the chronically instrumented fetal lamb. A specially constructed device permitted the occlusion of either both umbilical veins, or of both umbilical arteries, or of the total umbilical cord. A prolongation of the PEP together with an increase in blood pressure was a consistent finding during any type of cord occlusion. In poorly oxygenated fetal lambs a two-step increase in the duration of the PEP was observed during the occlusion. It was accompanied by a simultaneous two-step increase in fetal arterial blood pressure. A correlation was found between the steady-state fetal pO2 before the occlusion and the increase in fetal arterial diastolic blood pressure during the blockade of the umbilical circulation. During occlusion the main determining factors of the PEP prolongation appear to be the increase in afterload and the decrease in preload of the fetal heart. The second step in the prolongation of the PEP during the occlusions in poorly oxygenated fetal lambs is attributed to a chemoreceptor-induced reflex, resulting in a redistribution of cardiac output in the fetal lamb.", 
    "9": "The aminohydroxypropoxy moiety has been incorporated into the dihydrolutidine class of vasodilators. In the spontaneously hypertensive rat, one of these, (S)-4-[2-methyl-4-[3-(tert-butylamino)-2-hydroxypropoxy]phenyl]-3,5-dicarboethoxy-1,4-dihydrolutidine (4c), exhibited antihypertensive activity on the order of the standard 4-[2-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-3,5-dicarboethoxy-1,4-dihydrolutidine (2a). This antihypertensive activity could not be explained in terms of a vasodilating effect, as determined in the dog. In this latter model, 2a decreased both mean arterial and hindlimb perfusion pressures.", 
    "10": "Immobilization stress (2.5 h daily) or repeated injection of isoproterenol (1 mg/kg, 3 times daily) for 1 wk caused a subsensitivity to the chronotropic and pressor effect of epinephrine in pithed rats. Propranolol (1 mg/kg) inhibited, to a greater extent in control than in immobilized rats, the chronotropic effect of epinephrine. The residual heart rates did not differ significantly among control, immobilized, and isoproterenol-treated rats. Practolol (1 mg/kg) but not butoxamine (5 mg/kg) mimicked the effect of propranolol. The subsensitivity in the blood pressure responses was not abolished by injection of either of the beta-adrenoceptor blockers. Butoxamine or propranolol shifted the epinephrine dose-blood pressure response curves to the left. The degree of shift was similar in control and immobilized or isoproterenol-treated rats. Daily injection of quinacrine (16 mg/kg), an antimalarial agent that inhibits phospholipase A2, blocked the subsensitivity to the chronotropic effect of epinephrine, but not that to the pressor effect of epinephrine. These observations suggest that immobilization stress causes desensitization of alpha- and beta 1-receptors but not beta 2-receptors. The mechanism of desensitization of beta 1-receptors by immobilization appears to be similar to that after isoproterenol treatment, possibly due to increased turnover of phospholipids.", 
    "11": "We investigated the proposed catecholamine receptor in the superior cervical ganglion of the rabbit with the sucrose-gap technique to characterize the receptor pharmacologically. It has been suggested that this receptor is involved in the slow inhibitory postsynaptic potential in sympathetic ganglia. Epinephrine, norepinephrine and dopamine consistently hyperpolarized the ganglion membrane (N = 60). The order of potency was epinephrine greater than or equal to norepinephrine much greater than dopamine. Clonidine (10(-5) M), phenylephrine (10(-4) M) and isoproterenol (10(-3) M) also hyperpolarized the ganglion. However, apomorphine, even at millimolar concentration, did not hyperpolarize the membrane. The alpha antagonists phentolamine (10(-6) M) and yohimbine (10(-6) M) depressed the response to all catecholamines and shifted the catecholamine concentration-response curve to the right; dopamine and beta antagonists and the alpha-1 antagonist prazosin had no effect on the catecholamine hyperpolarizations. In contrast, the nerve-evoked slow inhibitory postsynaptic potential was selectively depressed only by atropine (10(-7) M). In conclusion, we characterized an alpha-2 adrenergic receptor in the rabbit superior cervical ganglion responsible for the catecholamine hyperpolarization and found that the slow inhibitory postsynaptic potential does not appear to be mediated by the same receptor.", 
    "12": "Single oral doses of 1.5, 3.0, 4.5 and 6.0 mg/kg prizidilol HCl, an antihypertensive with vasodilator and beta-adrenoceptor blocking actions, were given to 12 patients with primary hypertension on separate days. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) decreased after 4.5 and 6.0 mg/kg and systolic BP also after 3.0 mg/kg. The antihypertensive effect was evident in 1 to 2 hr with maximum effect in 4 to 5 hr (supine systolic BP 20 and diastolic 13 mm Hg after 6.0 mg/kg); the effect was sustained for more than 8 hr. An initial slight reduction in heart rate (HR) after 1 to 2 hr was followed by a slight rise after 6 to 8 hr. There were higher plasma drug levels and greater antihypertensive effects after the 6.0-mg/kg dose in slow acetylators (n = 5) than in rapid acetylators (n = 7). Due to its hydrazine moiety, prizidilol, like hydralazine, seems to be a substrate for the polymorphic N-acetyltransferase enzyme system.", 
    "13": "Adenylate cyclase (AC) and guanylate cyclase (GC) activities were studied in normal B-enriched and T-enriched lymphocytes, in lymphocytes of children with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and in lymphocytes of adults with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). AC activity was greater in normal B than T lymphocytes (215 pmole/min/mg protein versus 80 pmole in the membrane-enriched fraction) and i both increased greatly after stimulation with isoproterenol and more so with prostaglandins E and F2 alpha. In leukemic lymphocytes, AC showed depressed activity (20 pmole in ALL cells and 55 pmole in CLL cells) and was less sensitive to hormonal stimulation: this loss of sensitivity occurred to a greater extent in ALL than in CLL lymphocytes. GC activity was greater in normal T than B cells (in membrane-enriched fraction: 10.2 pmole versus 5.3 pmole). It increased little with isoproterenol and prostaglandins stimulation, and much more with sodium azide and dehydroascorbic acid stimulation. GC activity was increased in both types of leukemic lymphocytes (23 pmole for ALL cells and 18 pmole for CLL cells) and was insensitive to stimulation. Possible derangement of cyclase and cyclic nucleotide regulation in leukemic cells is suggested.", 
    "14": "Five patients with malignant arterial hypertension and terminal (3) or advanced (2) renal failure were treated with the alpha-beta blocker labetalol and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril. Labetalol alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents had been ineffective in two cases and captopril alone in one; yet hypertension was rapidly controlled when the two drugs were given together. The return of blood pressure to normal levels brought about regression of digitalis-resistant cardiac failure in 2 patients and slight improvement of renal function in 2 other patients. The captopril-labetalol combination probably has a synergistic effect, and although its mechanism remains obscure this effect may be used to treat patients with severe or malignant arterial hypertension.", 
    "15": "Of 58 patients treated with captopril, 3 have now received the drug for more than 2 years and 22 for more than one year. This study concerns 38 patients treated for 6 months, captopril having been given alone during the first 2 months. They all had severe hypertension (diastolic BP Greater Than 110 mmHg) which had resisted previous treatments in normally effective doses, including at least one beta-blocker, dihydralazine and a diuretic. After 6 months blood pressure levels were normal in 53% of the patients, reduced in 31% and unchanged in 16%. Clinical improvement was habitual with, in particular, disappearance or decrease of tiredness and dyspnoea. Since some side-effects of the drug, such as granulopenia, proteinuria and ageusia, are mainly observed with high dosage, captopril is usually administered in doses lower or equal to 400 mg/day. In resistant or malignant hypertension it must be used in combination with salt-free diet, a beta-blocker and/or prazosin. Clinical, haematological and renal surveillance is necessary during treatment. When these precautions are observed, captopril constitutes a very useful drug for the treatment of patients with severe resistant hypertension.", 
    "16": "The delayed therapeutic effects of antidepressants (usually between 10 and 14 days) and of the tricyclic antidepressants in particular, are believed (on the basis of animal experiments) to lie in a progressive decrease of the sensitivity of cortical beta-adrenergic receptors. This is thought to be due to an increase in the synaptic concentration of noradrenaline, in turn accomplished by a decrease in the sensitivity of the presynaptic alpha 2 receptors which normally regulate noradrenaline secretion by a negative feedback mechanism. This model suggests that the desensitization of postsynaptic beta-receptors by antidepressants should be accelerated by the inhibition of the presynaptic alpha 2- adrenergic system, and we have indeed observed such an effect in preliminary studies with desipramine and phenoxybenzamine (PBZ) combined. We now show that the administration of either tricyclic or monoamine oxidase inhibitor antidepressants in combination with PBZ, an irreversible alpha-adrenergic blocker, accelerates and intensifies the desensitization of beta-adrenergic receptors. Our observations may have therapeutic implications.", 
    "17": "Subseizure electrical stimulation of the amygdala produced retrograde amnesia for a visual discrimination shock-motivated task. Animals pretreated with the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phenoxybenzamine, or the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, did not develop amnesia. The findings indicate that adrenergic antagonists attenuate amnesia produced by amygdala stimulation for visual discrimination training. These results are consistent with previous evidence indicating that adrenergic antagonists attenuate the amnesias produced by a variety of agents, and thus, suggest that adrenergic mechanisms may be involved in the production of retrograde amnesia.", 
    "18": "A 30 year-old male patient with accelerated arterial hypertension relatively resistent to diazoxide received a single oral dose of 100 mg of atenolol, following which hypotension of more than 24 hours duration and acute renal failure ensued. These alterations were reversible and did not recur with subsequent doses of atenolol. Prior therapy with diazoxide might have potentiated the hypotensive action of atenolol. The abnormality could be due to a phenomenon of hyperreactivity to the first dose of atenolol, similar to what has been described following first doses of prazosin or labetalol. This observation suggests that atenolol therapy must be started with caution, especially in patients previously treated with diazoxide.", 
    "19": "The functional study of growth hormone (GH) requires at least three different stimulation tests. To obtain a degree of hypoglycemia good enough to stimulate GH release is difficult in diabetic patients, and this fact has prompted us to utilize the stimulation induced by glucagon-propranolol. The test was performed in 15 diabetic patients and the results compared to those of 15 non-diabetic subjects. In the diabetic patients GH increased after stimulation from a mean basal level of 2.14 ng/ml to 15.32 ng/ml (p less than 0.01). Peak GH levels in plasma were reached between 120 and 180 minutes. Two failures were found and there were only minimal side effects. The results indicate that the test is valuable for the study of GH release in diabetic patients, and that it may substitute for the induction of hypoglycemia, which is more difficult to obtain in these patients. Finally, the results are compared to those obtained by other authors.", 
    "20": "Placebo or propranolol was given randomly of two groups of 12 adults with cirrhosis who had recently held from oesophageal or gastric varices or from acute gastric erosions. During three months' follow-up 5 patients in the placebo and none in the propranolol group had recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding.", 
    "21": "The effect of 4-aminopyridine (4AP) and 4-methyl-2-aminopyridine (4M2AP), 10(-3) M, was studied on isolated spontaneously beating right atria and electrically driven left atria of the rabbit and the cat. In the rabbit preparations, 4AP had a positive inotropic effect which was unaffected by propranolol or atropine, and a negative chronotropic effect which was abolished by atropine. In the cat, 4AP decreased both force and rate, and these effects were reversed when 4AP was repeated in the presence of atropine. In contrast, 4M2AP increased the rate and force of contraction in both species. These effects were reduced but not abolished when 4M2AP was repeated in the presence of propranolol. It is concluded that 4AP has a cholinergic effect presumably mediated by acetylcholine release which predominates over its direct positive inotropic effect in the rabbit but not in the cat, and which is responsible for its effect on rate in both species. 4M2AP also has a direct positive inotropic action, but its marked effects on force and rate of contraction are largely due to noradrenaline release. The selectivity of 4AP for cholinergic and 4M2AP for noradrenergic transmission suggests that there are differences in potassium channels or in calcium uptake or release mechanisms in the respective nerve terminals.", 
    "22": "Prostaglandin E2 synthesis in rabbit splenic fibroblasts was stimulated by noradrenaline but not by isoprenaline. Noradrenaline, isoprenaline and prostaglandin E2 increased intracellular cAMP accumulation. Noradrenaline-, but not isoprenaline-evoked cAMP accumulation was reduced by indomethacin; only combinations of phentolamine or indomethacin with propranolol abolished the noradrenaline effect. We conclude that the noradrenaline-induced increase in cAMP levels of rabbit splenic fibroblasts was due to stimulation of both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors. The response to alpha-receptor stimulation was possibly mediated by prostaglandin E2.", 
    "23": "In a group of 300 patients with essential hypertension, grades I and II (WHO), the medicamental treatment and the relation of blood pressure before and during their stationary treatment at a clinic for rehabilitation of cardiovascular disease were explored. 23% of the patients were admitted to the clinic without any antihypertensive treatment. Only 18% of the patients had been treated before according to the general directions with beta-receptor-blockers and/or diuretics (so-called basic therapy). These percentages remained almost constant during the period of observation from 1977 to 1979. According to the relation of blood pressure a change of medicaments to the so-called basic therapy was necessary in 59% of the cases. In 11% of the patients an adequate reduction of weight made medicamental treatment unnecessary.", 
    "24": "The effects of various beta-adrenergic agents on insulin secretion were investigated in vivo in mice. The non-selective beta-stimulator isopropylnoradrenaline and the selective beta 2-stimulator terbutaline both stimulated insulin secretion markedly, with the same efficacy and in a dose-dependent manner. The peak levels of plasma insulin after these two beta-agonists were achieved at a later time point (5-6 min) than after stimulation with glucose or carbachol (1.5-2.5 min). At very high dose levels the beta 2-stimulator isopropylaminothiazoloxypropanol slightly increased plasma insulin concentrations. The non-selective beta-blocker propranolol and the beta 2-selective blocker ICI 188,551 inhibited terbutaline-induced insulin release markedly and at comparable low dose levels, whereas the selective beta 1-blocker metoprolol exerted this effect only at a high dose level. At higher dose levels these three blockers moderately depressed the insulin response to glucose suggesting a partial dependence on intact beta-adrenoceptors for the effect of glucose. The beta 2-blocker butoxamine and the beta 1-blocker pamatolol did not influence insulin secretion. In conclusion, beta-adrenoceptor stimulation enhanced insulin secretion in vivo, but the beta-adrenoceptors regulating insulin secretion do not fit well into the conventional subdivision of beta 1 and beta 2, though they apparently are mainly of the beta 2-type.", 
    "25": "Acetylcholine failed to change the frequency of spontaneous contractions in the proximal region of isolated rabbit renal pelvis, but significantly increased the contractile frequency in the middle and distal regions, which then reached similar levels to those of the proximal region. Pretreatment with reserpine caused a decrease in the frequency of spontaneous contractions in the proximal, but not in the middle or distal regions. Reserpine-pretreated tissues developed hypersensitivity to catecholamines, while acetylcholine produced effects similar to those observed in control preparations. Atropine and N-methyl-scopolamine antagonized the action of acetylcholine in both the middle and the distal regions, suggesting that the action was exerted through muscarinic receptors. Adrenaline and alpha-stimulating drugs, but not isoprenaline, significantly increased the contractile frequency of all three tissues: the increase in the proximal region reached levels in excess of its fundamental maximal frequency. Phentolamine caused a significant decrease in the frequency of the proximal region and fully inhibited the stimulating action of catecholamines, indicating that this stimulation was mediated by alpha-adrenoceptors. The myogenic nature of pacemaking cells was confirmed by the effect of tetrodotoxin, ouabain and verapamil. The decrease in frequency in the pacemaker region of the proximal pelvis whether caused by reserpine or phentolamine indicates a significant role of catecholamines in modulating pacemaker activity.", 
    "26": "The effects of drug on phospholipid composition of cell surface membranes are not well understood at this time. The effects of membrane-active drugs and membrane depolarization on the phospholipid composition were determined in murine LM fibroblasts. Receptor-aggregating drugs such as concanavalin A and cytoskeleton-disrupting agents such as colchicine, vinblastine, and cytochalasin B decreased phosphatidylserine content of the plasma membrane from 5.4 +/- 1.5% to as low as 1.4 +/- 0.2%. In addition, concanavalin A and colchicine increased the phosphatidylglycerol content from 6.9 +/- 1.6% to 13.1 +/- 0.7% and 10.6 +/-1.7%, respectively, while vinblastine and cytochalasin B had no effect. Pentobarbital decreased the content of phosphatidylinositol+ phosphatidylserine and of phosphatidylglycerol almost 2-fold. Propranolol, ethanol, and depolarization with 120 mM KCl had small or ne effects on plasma membrane phospholipid composition. None of the above drugs or treatments significantly altered the asymmetric distribution of phosphatidylethanolamine across the LM cell plasma membrane under the conditions tested. In addition, energy inhibitors that deplete the proton-motive force of the cell (NaN3 and KCN) and inhibitors of ATP synthesis such as NaAsO4 did not affect the asymmetric distribution of phosphatidylethanolamine. It is concluded that the mechanism of action of membrane-active drugs such as concanavalin A, vinblastine, colchicine and pentobarbital may involve alterations in plasma membrane composition. It also appears that microfilaments, microtubules, beta-adrenergic receptors, membrane fluidity, and membrane potential are not critical for the regulation of the asymmetric distribution of membrane phosphatidylethanolamine.", 
    "27": "1. Deoxycorticosterone, which does not enhance tryptophan pyrrolase activity, also fails to alter the concentrations of the NAD(P) couples in livers of fed rats, whereas corticosterone increases both pyrrolase activity and dinucleotide concentrations. 2. Starvation of rats increases serum corticosterone concentration, lipolysis, tryptophan availability to the liver, tryptophan pyrrolase activity and liver [NADP(H)]. Glucose prevents all these changes. 3. The beta-adrenoceptor-blocking agent propranolol prevents the starvation-induced lipolysis and the consequent increase in tryptophan availability to the liver, but does not influence the increase in serum corticosterone concentration, liver pyrrolase activity and [NADP(H)]. 4. Actinomycin D, which prevents the starvation-induced increases in liver pyrrolase activity and [NADP(H)], does not affect those in serum corticosterone concentration and tryptophan availability to the liver. 5. Allopurinol, which blocks the starvation-induced enhancement of pyrrolase activity, also abolishes the increases in liver [NADP(H)], but not those in serum corticosterone concentration or tryptophan availability to the liver. 6. It is suggested that liver tryptophan pyrrolase activity plays an important role in NAD+ synthesis from tryptophan in the rat.", 
    "28": "Concentration-response curves for the chronotropic and inotropic effects of isoprenaline, in the absence and presence of propranolol, were obtained on heart atria isolated from normo- or dysthyroid rats. Hyperthyroidism increased the chronotropic potency and efficacy of the beta-adrenergic agonist. The results are compatible with the view that thyroid hormone increases the density of functional beta-adrenoceptors in cardiac pacemaker tissue.", 
    "29": "Basal tryptophan hydroxylase activity was measured in several serotonergic nerve terminal regions of the rat brain and was found to vary from one terminal region to another. Acute administration of methamphetamine produced a marked decrease in tryptophan hydroxylase activity in all serotonergic nerve terminal regions of rat brain examined. This decrease was antagonized in a regionally selective manner by propranolol. In contrast, haloperidol did not produce a similar antagonism. The results are discussed in the context of the previously reported efficacy of large doses of propranolol in some schizophrenic patients.", 
    "30": "The concentration of alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors--as measured by specific [3H]WB-4101 and (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol binding--was diminished by 60% below control values in the hearts of rats exposed to tobacco smoke. These changes in receptor numbers took place almost immediately after tobacco smoke exposure and were rapidly reversible after termination of the exposure. The dissociation constant, KD, for [3H]WB-4101 was identical in exposed (KD = 0.34 +/- 0.09 nM) and control (KD = 0.35 +/- 0.07 nM) hearts but was significantly different in the case of (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol binding (exposed, KD = 2.83 +/- 0.30 mM vs. control KD = 5.22 +/- 0.61 nM). For beta-receptor binding there was no significant difference between exposed and control animals in the Ki values for (-)-epinephrine, (-)-norepinephrine, (-)-alprenolol, (+/-)-propranolol or timolol. (-)-Isoproterenol, however, was found to bind with lower affinity in exposed compared with control hearts. For alpha-receptor binding there was no significant difference between control and 'smoked' animals in the Ki values for (-)-epinephrine, (-0)-norepinephrine or phentolamine. The decrease in alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor concentration may be related to the phenomenon of receptor desensitization resulting from a release of catecholamines in rats exposed to tobacco smoke.", 
    "31": "Labetalol was used in a multicentre open clinical trial in 128 patients in 10 centres. Nearly half had had either poor response to other drugs or side effects with them, while another 25 percent had failed to respond satisfactorily to a diuretic alone and 35 percent were previously untreated. The results at one year showed that labetalol had an excellent antihypertensive effect, often successful in patients who had failed to respond adequately to pure beta-blockers or other drugs and it proved easy to use. Side effects necessitated stopping the drug at less than adequate dosage in some patients who might also have proved resistant to labetalol and other drugs were added to improve blood pressure control in 25 patients who continued labetalol. The mean dose of labetalol was 707 mg/day and there was no evidence of tolerance developing. Side effects were fairly common and led to withdrawal of 28 patients (22 percent).", 
    "32": "A dopamine-activated adenylate cyclase has been identified in a membrane fraction of rat spinal cord. The concentration of dopamine producing half-maximal activation is about 5 microM and the activation is blocked by haloperidol. Apomorphine also activates the cyclase. Following transection of the cord, adenylate cyclase becomes about 5-10 times more sensitive to dopamine below the transection. The presence of dopamine-activated adenylate cyclase in the cord is consistent with reports of dopamine-containing tracts in spinal cord. This neuronal system may play an essential role in normal spinal mechanisms, in disease associated with dopaminergic neurons, as well as in the side-effects of neuroleptic drugs.", 
    "33": "The antihypertensive effect and metabolic side effects of bendroflumethiazide have been compared with those of propranolol in two randomly selected groups, of 53 previously untreated middle-aged men during 6 years' treatment for mild to moderately severe essential hypertension. The blood pressure-reduction was the same in the two groups. During the follow-up 1 man in the bendroflumethiazide group and 3 in the propranolol group died while 2, 1 on each treatment, became diabetic. None had gout but serum urate increased in both groups. Glucose tolerance improved significantly in both groups during the first year and this improvement was sustained for the follow-up period. Serum potassium did not differ in the two groups during the first 5 years but during the sixth year it decreased in the diuretic group. Total potassium was, however, unchanged in both groups. These results indicate that the frequency of metabolic side effects during diuretic treatment of mild to moderately severe essential hypertension is low and has been grossly exaggerated. Since the antihypertensive effect and side effects were equal with both drugs, and since the diuretics are cheaper, they should be the drug of first choice in this type of hypertension.", 
    "34": "A multicenter double-blind randomized study was carried out to compare the effect of timolol (10 mg twice daily) with that of placebo in patients surviving acute myocardial infarction. Treatment was started seven to 28 days after infarction in 1884 patients (945 taking timolol, and 939 placebo), who represented 52 per cent of those evaluated for entry; the patients were followed for 12 to 33 months (mean, 17). There were 152 deaths in the placebo group and 98 in the timolol group. When deaths that occurred during treatment or within 28 days of withdrawal were considered, the cumulated sudden-death rate over 33 months was 13.9 per cent in the placebo group and 7.7 per cent in the timolol group--a reduction of 44.6 per cent (P = 0.0001). The cumulated reinfarction rate was 20.1 per cent in the placebo group and 14.4 per cent in the timolol group (P = 0.0006). We conclude that long-term treatment with timolol in patients surviving acute myocardial infarction reduces mortality and the rate of reinfarction.", 
    "35": "A number of drugs bind to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein in plasma. To determine whether age-related changes in alpha 1-acid glycoprotein influence drug binding in mother and newborn infant and also the effects of sex, pregnancy, and oral contraceptives on drug binding, the binding of lidocaine, diazepam, propranolol, d-tubocurarine, and metocurine was determined by equilibrium dialysis in 17 men, 16 nonpregnant women, 16 nonpregnant women on oral contraceptives, and 15 mothers and their newborn infants at delivery. The free fraction of d-tubocurarine (p less than 0.05), metocurine (p less than 0.01), propranolol (p less than 0.001), and lidocaine (p less than 0.02) was higher in neonatal blood than in maternal blood, whereas the free fraction of diazepam was less in fetal cord blood than the mother's (p less than 0.02), but higher than that in nonpregnant women (p less than 0.001). The free fractions of diazepam, propranolol, and lidocaine were higher (p less than 0.001) in pregnant women compared with nonpregnant women while the diazepam and lidocaine free fractions were higher (p less than 0.05) in nonpregnant women and oral contraceptives than in women not using them. Alpha 1-acid glycoprotein was lower in the fetus (15.3 +/- 4.7 mg/100 ml) than the mother (49.6 +/- 6.5 mg/100 ml) (p less than 0.002). There was a positive correlation between plasma alpha 1-acid glycoprotein concentrations and the binding ratio (bound/free concentrations) of lidocaine (p less than 0.001; r = 0.623) and propranolol (p less than 0.001); r = 0.652), indicating that it is likely that the elevation of the free fraction of these drugs in the fetus is due in part to lower levels of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein.", 
    "36": "Hemodynamic and humoral effects of lofexidine were assessed in 11 patients with essential hypertension after a total of 1.5 mg were given orally over 24 hr. Heart rate (bpm) slowed (-12 +/- 6 [SEM], p less than 0.05) and cardiac output (liters per minute) was reduced (-0.78 +/-0.18, p less than 0.01) irrespective of blood pressure response; the latter was related to changes in systemic resistance (TPR) (r = 0.72, p less than 0.01). Cardiac performance judged from ejection fraction (0.61 +/- 0.03 to 0.59 +/- 0.03, NS) and mean transit time (8.73 +/- 0.53 sec to 9.20 +/- 0.35, NS) were not altered. Plasma volume was expanded more than 10% in two patients but not changed in the others. Supine plasma catecholamines determined in five patients were reduced in all but one with no correlation to changes in either TPR or diastolic blood pressure. On the other hand, there was an increase in plasma catecholamines during head-up tilt in four of five patients, indicating normal catecholamines release. Orthostatic hypotension occurred de novo in three patients; two of them had simultaneous slowing of heart rate (vasovagal attack). Results suggested that reduction of blood pressure by lofexidine depended on lack of increase in TPR in response to reduction of cardiac output; the hemodynamic pattern of this centrally acting adrenergic blocker closely resembled that reported for beta blockers.", 
    "37": "Kinetics of sotalol, a beta adrenoceptor blocker, was studied in 20 patients with varying renal function. In subjects with creatinine clearance (Clcr) greater than or equal to 39 ml/min/m2, sotalol plasma clearance (x +/- SD) was 71 +/- 31 ml/min/m2, elimination half-life (t 1/2) was 8.1 +/- 3.4 hr, and renal clearance was 46 +/- 26 ml/min/m2. In patients with moderate renal impairment (Clcr = 8 to 38 ml/min/m2) elimination t 1/2 rose to 24.2 +/- 7.5 hr, and plasma clearance fell to 24 +/- 7 ml/min/m2. In patients receiving dialysis, elimination t 1/2 rose to 33.9 +/- 27.1 hr. Elimination t 1/2 during hemodialysis was 5.8 +/- 2.1 hr and was associated with a 56.7 +/- 21% reduction in plasma levels.", 
    "38": "Thirty-two patients were studied before and after i.v. administration of 0.15-0.20 mg/kg of propranolol. Twenty-one of the 32 underwent combined autonomic blockade with the additional infusion of 0.04 mg of atropine. Twenty other patients with sinus node disease underwent electrophysiologic studies both before and after i.v. administration of 0.04 mg of atropine alone. Spontaneous cycle length, maximal corrected sinus node recovery time, sinoatrial conduction time, secondary pauses and intrinsic heart rate were measured. Secondary pauses were more common in those with abnormal intrinsic heart rates, and they did not correlate with changes in maximal corrected sinus node recovery time or sinoatrial conduction time. In patients with normal intrinsic heart rate, abnormal test measurements usually returned to normal after combined blockade (hypervagotonia); however, some patients showed a new abnormality after propranolol that was not reversible with atropine (catecholamine-dependent). Abnormal test responses in patients with abnormal intrinsic heart rate persisted or increased after combined blockade. We conclude that patients with sinus node disease may be categorized as (1) those with intrinsic sinus node disease; (2) those with normal intrinsic sinus node function but either relative hypervagotonia or catecholamine dependency; and (3) those with abnormal intrinsic sinus node function affected by vagal or catecholamine factors.", 
    "39": "The hemodynamic and myocardial metabolic responses to the cold pressor test were studied in 15 patients with coronary artery disease and stable exertional angina. Every patient had abnormal coronary vasoconstriction during a control cold pressor test, even though 14 were receiving propranolol and 12 were receiving long acting nitrates. Mean coronary vascular resistance for the group increased 18 +/- 6% (SD) (from 0.80 +/- 0.12 to 0.94 +/- 0.20 mm Hg/ml/min, p less than 0.05); coronary sinus blood was unchanged, and the arterial-coronary sinus oxygen difference widened significantly (from 11.5 +/- 1.2 to 12.3 +/- 1.2 ml/100 ml, p less than 0.05). Four patients developed angina, accompanied in each instance by a negative arterial-coronary sinus lactate difference. After the administration of nifedipine (10 mg buccally) in 10 patients, the coronary vascular responses to a repeat cold pressor test were normal in each patient. Mean coronary sinus blood flow increased 27 +/- 12% (from 122 +/- 32 to 153 +/- 35 ml/min, p less than 0.05), coronary vascular resistance decreased 10 +/- 6% (from 0.85 +/- 0.16 to 0.76 +/- 0.16 mm Hg/ml/min, p less than 0.05), and the arterial-coronary sinus oxygen difference was unchanged. No patient experienced angina. The hemodynamic and coronary vascular responses to a repeat cold pressor test in five patients given placebo were unaltered from control responses. The protective effects of nifedipine were unaccompanied by any change in mean arterial pressure, left ventricular filling pressure or myocardial oxygen consumption either at rest or in response to the cold pressor test. Nifedipine appears to exert a selective antivasoconstrictor effect on the coronary vasculature.", 
    "40": "A patient undergoing prostatectomy under epidural analgesia developed clinical signs of a severe TURP syndrome. During resuscitation, it was revealed that serum sodium was only moderately decreased. Plasma oncotic pressure was, however, markedly decreased and the pressure gradient between plasma oncotic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (approximately hydrostatic pressure) was 1 mmHg (0.13 kPa) only, allowing almost free filtration of fluid through the pulmonary capillary wall, resulting in a non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. The patient was successfully resuscitated with albumin and inotropic stimulation with prenalterol.", 
    "41": "The effect of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) on the cerebral blood flow was investigated in the goat. An electromagnetic flow probe was placed around the internal maxillary artery for continuous measurement of ipsilateral blood flow. Intraarterial injection of VIP resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the cerebral blood flow. The effect was not antagonized by any of the antagonists atropine, propranolol, phentolamine and naloxone administered intraarterially 1 min before VIP. It is discussed that VIP may play a physiological role in the local blood flow regulation in the CNS.", 
    "42": "The placental transfer, and maternal and fetal disposition, of the beta-adrenoreceptor blocking drug propranolol were studied in the pregnant sheep near term. In separate studies, propranolol (1 mg/kg) was administered peripherally or into the portal vein as an i.v. bolus, to either mother or fetus. Both mother and fetus were provided with vascular and bile duct cannulae, enabling plasma concentrations and biliary excretion of the drug to be measured over 6 hours. Placental transfer of propranolol was rapid and bidirectional. Comparison of the systemic blood levels obtained after peripheral and portal dosage indicated that hepatic extraction was much more efficient in the adult. This was supported by an apparent/true biliary clearance ratio of approximately 20 in the adult, and only 2-3 in the fetus. These studies show that the fetus near term is exposed to propranolol administered to the mother at a time when its ability to clear the drug is not fully developed.", 
    "43": "The arterial blood from the femoral artery and venous blood from the femoral vein wee simultaneously collected following intravenous administration of propranolol, lidocaine, procainamide, furosemide, theophylline and griseofulvin to dogs or rabbits. The preliminary results of arterial-venous (A-V) plasma concentration profiles are reported in this communication. The maximum A/V ratios shortly after a rapid intravenous bolus dose were 277-, 15-, 34-, 33-, 5.4- and 3240-fold, respectively, for the above six drugs. The venous plasma levels were higher than arterial plasma levels during parallel terminal phase by as much as 104, 48, 134, 29, 16, and 47%, respectively, for the above six drugs. These data suggest a very rapid and extensive uptake of the drugs by the sampling tissues (the leg) shortly after dosing. The potential significance of A-V differences in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies are briefly discussed.", 
    "44": "The cardiac effects of magnesium were studied on 40 spontaneously beating rabbit atria at 37 degrees C. Magnesium administered in doses of 30, 60, 120 and 240 mmol elicited dose dependent negative inotropic and chronotropic responses. Larger doses above 240 mmol caused complete atrial arrest. Further it was observed that propranolol with magnesium became more effective in blocking the positive chronotropic and inotropic responses to isoprenaline. The finding is interesting and suggestive that magnesium could be employed either alone or in combination with propranolol in treatment of arrhythmias which are non-responsive to propranolol.", 
    "45": "Effects on blood pressure and heart rate of labetalol, a new beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent with alpha-blocking action were studied in conscious hypertensive rats (SHR, DOCA-hypertensive rats and renal hypertensive rats (RHR)). Labetalol with two asymmetric carbon atoms consists of an equal proportion of two racemates. In SHR, prevention of the development of hypertension was noted after 1.5 weeks of chronic oral administration of labetalol 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg/day, while bradycardia occurred beginning with the day of administration. Thus, the prevention of the development of hypertension appeared much earlier than in the case of the other beta-blockers. Antihypertensive effects and bradycardia were also noted in DOCA hypertensive rats and RHR after oral administration of labetalol 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg/day for six days. In DOCA hypertensive rats, the antihypertensive effect was more pronounced that in the RHR. These findings are in contrast to those with other beta-blockers. Other beta-blockers produced antihypertensive effects only in SHR. It is concluded that not only the beta-blocking action, but also the alpha-blocking action of labetalol plays an important role in the antihypertensive effects of labetalol.", 
    "46": "The systemic bioavailability of timolol, a beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent, was calculated from published data in normal volunteers and uremic patients after oral doses. Equations based on the perfusion limited model that account for the biological determinants affecting drug disposition were derived and applied to calculate systemic bioavailability. The means of the fraction of the administered oral dose reaching the systemic circulations intact drug were calculated to be 0.58 and 0.60 for normal volunteers and uremic patients, respectively. Minimal first pass biotransformation during absorption was inferred from these figures for timolol when compared with other analogs such as propranolol and alprenolol, each of which undergoes an extensive first pass effect.", 
    "47": "In this comparative bioavailability study in 12 healthy volunteers the blood level profiles of both propranolol and bendrofluazide were studied following the multiple oral administration of the drugs as a fixed combination (Inderetic) and as a free combination at doses of 80 mg propranolol twice daily and 2.5 mg bendrofluazide twice daily. There were no statistically significant differences between the two regimens in terms of individual propranolol blood levels, half-lives and areas under the curve. The half-lives were between 5 and 8 h. Thus the bioavailability of propranolol from the fixed combination is equivalent to that from the free combination. The mean peak bendrofluazide blood levels were slightly higher following the administration of the fixed combination. This difference was statistically significant only at 1 and 2 h after the first dose. There were no statistically significant differences between these two bendrofluazide regimens in terms of half-life and area under the curve. Thus the bioavailability of bendrofluazide from the fixed combination is equivalent to that from the free combination. It is concluded therefore that by combining bendrofluazide and propranolol in a fixed capsule formulation does not affect significantly the systemic bioavailability of either component.", 
    "48": "In this comparative bioavailability study in 12 healthy volunteers the blood level profiles and urinary recoveries of both atenolol and chlorthalidone were studied following the administration of the drug as a fixed combination ('Tenoretic'), as a free combination, and individually, at doses of 100 mg atenolol, and 25 mg chlorthalidone. There were no statistically significant differences between the three formulations of atenolol in terms of individual blood levels, half-life, area-under-the-curve, and urinary excretion. The half-lives were between 5 and 6 h in agreement with other published data. Thus the bioavailability of atenolol from the fixed combination is equivalent to that from the free combination and from the atenolol tablet. The chlorthalidone blood levels were slightly higher following the administration of the fixed combination when compared with the free combination or the chlorthalidone tablet. This observation was reflected in estimates of the area under the curves and the urinary recoveries. The half-lives of all three formulations were similar at about 60 h. It is concluded that combining chlorthalidone and atenolol in a single tablet does not reduce the systemic bioavailability of either component.", 
    "49": "The pharmacokinetics of acebutolol have been studied in eight healthy male volunteers following the oral administration of acebutolol hydrochloride ('Sectral', May & Baker) as a single dose (400 mg), and during and after repeated oral dosing (400 mg, b.d. for 56 days). Following single dose administration, considerable inter-subject variation in plasma levels of parent drug and the major metabolite, diacetolol, was evident. Acebutolol appeared to be eliminated from plasma in a bi-phasic manner, and this was confirmed from urinary excretion rate data. Mean initial and terminal half-lives of about 2 and 11 h, respectively, were determined. Plasma levels of diacetolol were greater than those of parent drug from 3 to 4 h following dose administration. Total urinary excretion of diacetolol was generally greater than that of acebutolol. During repeated dosing, steady-state plasma levels of acebutolol and diacetolol were achieved in 6 volunteers. Acebutolol did not appear to stimulate or inhibit its metabolism.", 
    "50": "Sauvagine, a linear peptide of 40 amino acids, produced hypotension when administered intravenously to anesthetized dogs. Diastolic pressure was always more affected than systolic pressure. Aortic blood flow and venous return both increased to the same extent. The mechanism of the hypotensive response was mainly, if not exclusively, due to dilatation of the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries. Intravenous infusion of sauvagine in doses ranging from 3 to 10 ng . kg-1 . min-1 produced a dose-related increase of mesenteric blood flow up to 400% control values. Mucosal-submucosal blood flow of ileum and colon was increased, while blood flow in muscle was unaffected or slight decreased. The mesenteric vasodilator response was not prevented by adrenergic or muscarinic receptor blockade. The hypotensive response was more marked and sustained in dibenamine-propranolol treated dogs."
