    "0": "In recent studies carried out during the last decade, it has been found that beta-blocker agents have many central effects. These findings raise the question how beta-blocker agents act when they influence central effects. In spite of intensive research efforts on this subject, no answer has been offered so far. Several studies indicate that the effect of beta-blocker agents on the dopaminergic receptors in the brain is very similar to their effect on beta-adrenergic receptors. In a set of experiments we checked the effect of two beta-blocker agents: oxprenolol and dl-propranolol, and the effect of d-propranolol on hypothermia induced by d-amphetamine and apomorphine at an ambient temperature of 4 degrees C. It was found that the two beta-blockers and the d-propranolol significantly potentiated the effect of hypothermia induced by d-amphetamine and apomorphine, an effect which is mediated by the central dopaminergic system. However, the activity of the beta-blockers was agonistic. Furthermore, the influence of d-propranolol on hypothermia shows that this dopaminergic agonistic activity of the beta-blockers is not related to peripheral or central beta-receptor blockage.", 
    "1": "Experiments on an isolated ileum of the rat with experimental hyperlipidemia have shown the decreased acetylation rate of sulfalen, sulfamonomethoxin and sulfapyridazine. The absorption rate of the free forms of sulfanilamides was increased (significantly for sulfalen and sulfapyridazine). Isadrin (1 . 10(-8) M) and cAMP (1 . 10(-5) M) introduced into the liquid exposed to the mucosa of the rat ileum raised the acetylation rate of sulfamonomethoxin by the ileic wall while anaprilin (1 . 10(-6) M) led to the reduction of both absorption and acetylation of this sulfanilamide. Addition of cAMP to the incubation mixture of mitochondria and microsomes increased the acetylation rate of sulfamonomethoxin.", 
    "2": "There is evidence that repeated electroconvulsive shocks (ECS) in rats potentiate dopamine (DA)-, serotonin (5HT)- and alpha-noradrenergic (alpha-NA)-mediated drug-induced behaviour and reduce opiate-induced behaviours. These studies suggest changes at the level of the receptor or beyond. However, high affinity in vitro 3H-ligand binding studies in brain membranes from ECS-treated control rats failed to demonstrate generalized ECS-induced changes in 5HT, DA, alpha-NA or opiate receptor binding. Binding of the beta-receptor ligand dihydroalprenolol (3H-DHA) was significantly reduced in ECS-treated rat brain membranes. This may be secondary to effects on NA neurones since ECS-induced reduction of 3H-DHA binding did not occur in animals with 6-hydroxydopamine-induced depletion of cortical noradrenaline. In conjunction with other studies, the results suggest that electroconvulsive therapy may have a noradrenergic mechanism of action.", 
    "3": "Propranolol introduced by a cut-end method into atrial trabeculae evoked negative inotropic response without any significant changes in basic electrical parameters. This effect was resistant to noradrenaline but not to dibutyryl cAMP. These results suggest that existence of intracellular beta adrenoreceptors involved in the control of the contraction.", 
    "4": "Desensitization of turkey erythrocyte adenylate cyclase by exposure of these cells to the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol leads to a decrease in subsequent adenylate cyclase stimulation by isoproterenol, F-, or Gpp(NH)p without any apparent loss or down regulation of receptors (B.B. Hoffman et al. J. Cyclic Nucl. Res. 5: 363-366, 1979). We now report that the desensitization is associated with a functional \"uncoupling\" of the beta-adrenergic receptor. This is evidenced by an impaired ability of receptors to form a high affinity, guanine nucleotide sensitive complex with agonist as assessed by computer analysis of radioligand binding data. The changes in adenylate cyclase responsiveness as well as the alterations in receptor affinity for agonists are reproduced by incubation of turkey erythrocytes with the cAMP analog 8-Bromo-adenosine 3':5'- cyclic monophosphate. These findings suggest that one possible mechanism for the development of desensitization in adenylate cyclase systems may be a cAMP mediated alteration of a component(s) of the beta-adrenergic receptor-adenylate cyclase complex which results in impaired receptor-cyclase coupling.", 
    "5": "When utilizing iodohydroxybenzylpindolol (IHYP) as an adrenergic receptor probe in muscle membrane systems, the data demonstrated an unacceptably high nonspecific binding component. Bearer et al. have reported that chloramine-T induced iodination of hydroxybenzylpindolol (HYP) results in the incorporation of iodine into the indole ring rather than into the phenolic moiety as noted previously by others. These results suggest that pindolol itself can also be iodinated. Therefore, the usefulness of carrier free 125I-labeled iodopindolol (IPIN) as an adrenergic receptor probe was investigated. Using between 0.01 nM and 0.1 nM [125I]IPIN in two different muscle membrane systems, we found the nonspecific binding component to be 10% or less of total binding. When [125I]IPIN was used with membranes prepared from rat skeletal muscle, we found it to interact with a single set of high affinity binding sites (KD = 0.13 +/- 0.01 nM) with the characteristics of beta adrenergic receptors and a density of 48.5 fmoles/mg protein. IPIN binding was also studied with purified dog cardiac sarcolemma. A single set of binding sites was detected having a KD of 1.64 +/- 0.5 nM; the density of these sites was 289 fmoles/mg membrane protein. [125I]IPIN may be a useful probe for the beta adrenergic receptor of tissues in which [125I]IHYP and other beta adrenergic receptor probes have a non-specific binding component which approaches that of the specific binding component.", 
    "6": "Pharmacological studies of abomasum motor activity were carried out in 3 sheep with chronic fistulae in the rumen and the fundus and pyloric part of the abomasum. The contractions of these parts of the stomach were recorded by the balloon method. The obtained results showed that in the abomasum stimulation of alpha-adrenergic receptors raises the degree of motor activity while stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors inhibits it. It has been shown also that the sympathetic system has a greater influence through the beta-adrenergic receptors on the motor activity of the pyloric part than on that of the fundus of the abomasum. The analysis of the records obtained after bilateral vagotomy demonstrated that the automatism of the pyloric part was greater than that of the fundus of the abomasum.", 
    "7": "Membrane structure in intact human erythrocytes was analyzed by electron-spin-resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. The spin probes 5-doxyl stearate and 5-doxyl stearate methyl ester revealed thermally-induced structural transitions in the membrane at 37 degree C and 15 degree C. The addition of propranolol, diazepam, chlorpromazine, or Pluronic F68 all caused a decrease in the temperature of the upper transition, but did not markedly alter the temperature of the lower transition. In addition, diazepam caused a significant decrease in the ordering or packing of the membrane-lipid acyl chains. It is proposed here that the protection from hypotonic hemolysis that has been reported in the presence of these drugs is mediated by a structural rearrangement in the erythrocyte membrane involving a change in protein-lipid interactions.", 
    "8": "Spontaneous and stimulated lipolytic activity of subcutaneous abdominal adipocytes from obese subjects treated by a hypocaloric diet (800-1000 kcal/d) for 13-15 d were studied. A strong increase in basal lipolytic activity of the adipocytes occurred after the restrictive diet treatment. Linked to this phenomenon, an important alpha-adrenergic antilipolytic effect of adrenaline appeared whereas, the beta-stimulating effect of isoproterenol (beta-adrenomimetic drug) was not affected. The increased alpha-inhibitory effect of adrenaline was shown to theophylline-stimulated adipocytes of energy-restricted subjects. It is concluded that after a period of hypocaloric diet, the adrenaline-dependent lipolysis of subcutaneous abdominal fat cells of obese subjects is reversed. The lipolytic response induced by adrenaline, described in the adipocytes of obese controls, develop towards an alpha-adrenergic antilipolytic response after the hypocaloric treatment. Our data suggest that, in states with increased rate of lipolysis, there is an increased readiness for alpha-adrenergic response.", 
    "9": "The role of the sympatho-adrenal system in the acute respiratory and cardiovascular responses to high altitude was studies in 20 volunteers during ascent to 6,000 m in a low pressure chamber, once without (control) and once with beta-adrenergic blockade. Special attention was paid to the hypoxia-induced ECG changes. Propranolol lowered the level of hypoxia-induced cardiovascular reactions, whereas it had no effect on hypoxic hyperventilation and alveolar gases. At altitude, ECG changes during myocardial depolarization occurred in both the propranolol and the control groups, probably due to the direct effects of hypoxia. During the repolarization phase, propranolol led to an almost complete abolition of S-T depression and to significant reduction of T wave flattening. The minor but still significant flattening of the T wave as well as the relative (to the heart rate) lengthening of Q-T is probably due to the direct effects of hypoxia. Propranolol abolishes or diminishes the signs of cardiac hypoxia by antagonizing the effects of catecholamine release and/or by reducing myocardial oxygen consumption, thus probable increasing the ability to withstand oxygen-want at altitude.", 
    "10": "Gas chromatography was used to study both the relative composition and level of nonesterified fatty acids in the blood of pigs, following target-oriented deflection of two hormonal systems, hypothalamus-pituitary gland-thyroid and hypothalamus-pituitary gland-adrenal cortex. The findings originally expected were not made. Percentual C-18 was increased, following long-time application of tri-iodothyronine/thyroxine, while c-12 was percentually lowered, as compared to the perchlorate group. Deflection of the hypothalamus-pituitary gland-adrenocortical system caused slight alteration in both the composition and overall concentration of blood-borne non-esterified fatty acids.", 
    "11": "In rabbit left atrium and ileum as well as in guinea-pig tracheal chain preparations dose-response curves for isoprenaline, adrenaline, noradrenaline and fenoterol have been determined. In order to assess the coexistence of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor subtypes in these tissues the antagonism of the relative selective adrenolytic drugs metoprolol (beta 1-) and H35/25 (beta 2-) against these sympathomimetic agents was tested. The determination of the pD2-values for the agonists showed a relative high affinity of fenoterol and adrenaline to tracheal beta-adrenoceptors whilst noradrenaline was most affine to atrial beta-adrenoceptors. In all three organs isoprenaline showed the highest affinity. On rabbit atrium driven by 1 Hz both beta-adrenolytic drugs competitively inhibited the effects of all sympathomimetic agents. The pA2-values characterizing the antagonism between metoprolol and isoprenaline, adrenaline or noradrenaline were comparable. Those determined for the interaction of H35/25 with these agonists also were in the same range but lower than those for metoprolol. Both adrenolytic drugs showed higher pA2-values to fenoterol. Furthermore for classification of beta-adrenoceptor binding sites the method of Paton and Rang (1965) was applied. The dose-ratio of isoprenaline after combination of metoprolol and H35/25 was multiplicative thus confirming the existence of different binding sites in the atrium. On rabbit ileum pA2-values for both antagonists could only be determined when isoprenaline was the agonist. The effect of the endogenous catecholamines, adrenaline and noradrenaline, was only blocked by metoprolol. On the other hand, fenoterol could not be blocked by either antagonist alone, but only by the combination of both adrenolytic drugs indicating a comparable affinity of fenoterol to both binding sites.--The Schild-plot for the antagonism of propranolol versus noradrenaline or fenoterol supports the view of the existence of different types of adrenoceptors stimulated by either agonist. On the guinea-pig tracheal chain both adrenolytic drugs inhibited competitively the effects of the sympathomimetic agonists. The pA2-values for H35/25 where the highest when compared with those of atrium or ileum. Using the combination of metoprolol and H35/25 the resulting dose-ratio for adrenaline was multiplicative demonstrating again the presence of two binding sites. The present results indicate the coexistence of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor subtypes on the organs investigated. This conclusion has been reached by the use of at least two methods in parallel, namely the determination of the pA2-values for selective antagonists to selective agonists and that for a nonselective antagonist to selective agonists and furthermore, the calculation of the dose-ratio of agonists after the combined administration of two selective antagonists.", 
    "12": "Rat sarcolemma preparations were incubated with some membranes stabilizers to study their effects on the (Na+,K+)- and Ca2+-ATPase activity. The drugs inhibited the enzymes with the same order of potency as in the earlier observed muscle contractures: chlorpromazine greater than dibucaine greater than propranolol greater than tetracaine greater than procaine (range 0.1-3.6 mM) (R\u00f8ed & Brodal 1979). The contracture inducing effect of the stabilizers is suggested to be caused by a membrane depolarization due to the (Na+,K+)-ATPase inhibition. Ouabain inhibited the (Na+,K+)-ATPase activity in purified plasma membrane, but did not inherit the sarcolemma located ATPases or induce any contracture.", 
    "13": "The present study was undertaken in order to clarify the possible involvement of a central beta-adrenoceptor mediated action on the stimulation of locomotor activity by the dopamine agonist apomorphine and the noradrenergic agonist clonidine. The effect of pretreatment with various doses of d-and dl-propranolol on apomorphine- and apomorphine plus clonidine-induced locomotor stimulation in reserpinized mice was measured in photocell activity chambers. Pretreatment with dl-propranolol prolonged the duration of apomorphine-induced locomotor stimulation without affecting the maximal level of activity. A similar tendency was seen after pretreatment with the d-form of propranolol, which has a much lower beta-receptor blocking activity. The potentiation by clonidine of the apomorphine-induced locomotor stimulation in reserpinized mice was dose-dependently reduced by pretreatment with dl-propranolol whereas d-propranolol was found to be ineffective. The results indicate that central beta-receptor mechanisms might be involved in the apomorphine plus clonidine-induced locomotor stimulation of reserpinized mice.", 
    "14": "The effects of propranolol on angiotensin II (AII) enhancement of sympathetic nerve transmission were investigated in the in situ blood-perfused mesenteric vascular bed of the rat. Angiotensin II in subpressor concentrations (3 ng/ml) potentiated the vasoconstrictor responses to both sympathetic nerve stimulation (NS) and exogenous norepinephrine (NE). The dl-propranolol had no effect on the basal vasoconstrictor responses to NS and NE, yet inhibited the AII-enhanced vasoconstrictor responses to NS by 47% (p less than 0.05) and 81% (p less than 0.001) at 100 and 300 ng/ml respectively. In contrast, the potentiation of NE responses by AII was unaffected by propranolol. A similar blockade of AII enhancement of NS was observed with the d-isomer of propranolol. Dibucaine (300 ng/ml), a local anesthetic, failed to alter the basal or AII-enhanced responses to either NS or NE. Indomethacin, a prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor (5 mg/kg, s.c.), abolished the inhibitory effect of dl-propranolol on AII enhancement of NS. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), but not prostaglandin I2, (3 ng/ml) inhibited AII enhancement of NS without altering the basal response to NS or NE in indomethacin-pretreated animals. Intraarterial infusions of dl-propranolol, d-propranolol, AII, and dl-propranolol-plus-AII into the superior mesenteric artery increased mesenteric venous PGE2 concentrations from 216 +/- 33 to 355 +/- 33 (p less than 0.01), 328 +/- 44 (p less than 0.05), 325 +/- 27 (p less than 0.02), and 407 +/- 44 pg/ml (p less than 0.01) respectively. We conclude that propranolol antagonizes AII enhancement of NS by increasing prostaglandin levels in vascular tissue. Furthermore, these findings suggest that propranolol may exert its antihypertensive effect through the release of prostaglandins when used in therapeutic doses in excess of those required for beta-adrenergic blockade.", 
    "15": "The effects of cholinergic and adrenergic blocking agents on the period and amplitude of sustained oscillations in plasma levels of insulin and glucose were studied in 16 overnight-fasted conscious rhesus monkeys. Blood samples were withdrawn at 2-min intervals before and during or following administration of drugs that affect neurotransmission. Cholinergic blockade with atropine had no effect on the oscillations. alpha-Adrenergic blockade with phentolamine caused a rise in plasma insulin that lasted less than 10 min and was followed by a slight, although not consistent, decrease in mean insulin and a consistent small decrease in glucose. There was a sustained increase in heart rate, but no effect on the oscillations of insulin or glucose. beta-Adrenergic blockade induced by propranolol led to persistent decreases in mean plasma insulin 60% below the base line, small but variable decreases in glucose, and a sustained decrease in heart rate, but no change in period or relative amplitude of the oscillations in plasma levels of either insulin or glucose. General anesthesia with pentobarbital did not eliminate these oscillations. Our observations on the failure of the blockade of certain putative efferent pathways or depression of higher cortical centers to alter the period of the oscillations of insulin reduce the likelihood that the oscillations are transmitted from a pacemaker in the central nervous system.", 
    "16": "The plasma concentrations of beta-thromboglobulin (beta-TG) and platelet factor 4 (PF4) were measured in 100 patients with documented coronary artery disease (CAD) and in 40 controls. 18 patients had had coronary artery bypass surgery (CABS), 25 patients were on therapy with beta-blocking agents and 19 were treated with oral anticoagulants. 38 patients with CAD received neither CABS nor beta-blocking or anticoagulating drugs. The highest plasma concentrations of beta-TG and PF4 were found in the patient group without medical or surgical treatment (patients versus controls: p less 0.01). Patients with CABS showed beta-TG and PF4 levels within the normal range. Patients with beta-blocking agents also had lower beta-TG and PF4 values than the patient group without therapy (p less than 0.05). By contrast, patients on oral anticoagulation therapy presented with similar plasma concentrations of beta-TG and PF4 as untreated patients. Our data indicate that surgical or medical treatment with beta-blocking agents, but not with oral anticoagulants, may have some influence on platelet function in patients with CAD. beta-TG and PF4 radioimmunoassay may be a simple method to study platelet involvement in various diseases and to evaluate possible influences of medical of surgical treatment on in vivo platelet function.", 
    "17": "The present paper analyzes the causes, signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism in children and the problems, complications and results associated with the various therapeutic regimes. Childhood hyperthyroidism is usually due to Grave's disease, an autoimmune thyroid disease. Genetic factors are also involved in its development. The diagnosis and in particular the differential diagnosis with Hashimoto's thyroiditis are discussed. Treatment of Graves' disease is controversial, but medical therapy is commonly accepted as the treatment of choice. Some dosage schedules of antithyroid drugs are considered, and some techniques for predicting remission status and relapse of disease are reported. Both the minor and more serious complications of medical therapy are examined. Careful follow-up for the development of hypothyroidism is advocated, especially in patients treated with radiation or surgery. Autonomous hyperfunctioning thyroid adenoma is rare, but occurs even in childhood, and can degenerate into carcinoma.", 
    "18": "The effects of disodium cromoglycate (DSCG) on in vitro histamine release from peritoneal and pleural mast cells, and a possible interference with adrenergic mechanisms was studied. Parallel to this study, the effects of DSCG on the well-established adrenoceptor-mediated amylase release from parotid glands were investigated. It was found that DSCG in low concentrations potentiates histamine release from peritoneal mast cells. Further more, this potentiation is enhanced by alpha-adrenoceptor blockade and diminished by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. Histamine release from pleural mast cells is affected inversely to peritoneal cells, that is, the secretion is inhibited by DSCG at a high concentration but not at a low one. The inhibition is unaffected by alpha-blockers but totally abolished by the beta-antagonist propranolol. The amylase release induced by norepinephrine, mediated via beta1-adrenoceptor, is depressed by DSCG. The beta-antagonist-sensitive amylase release induced by phentolamine is also inhibited by DSCG. Finally, DSCG alone induces amylase release from the parotid gland. These results would seem to indicate that DSCG exerts some alpha-adrenoceptor activity. However, it is not possible, at present, to state whether this activity is of agonistic nature. DSCG has effects which with respect to pattern, correspond well to the action of beta-adrenoceptor agonists.", 
    "19": "The hemodynamic pattern in hypertension varies according to the age of the subject and the stage of the hypertensive disorder. In the early stage, both cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance tend to be elevated. Already at that stage, mild degrees of left ventricular function disturbance can be detected. Advanced stages are characterized by a hypokinetic type of circulation with subnormal cardiac output and considerably increased systemic vascular resistance. Both cardioselective and nonselective beta-receptor antagonists lower cardiac output and tend to raise systemic vascular resistance. Even left ventricular filling pressures tend to be higher. While these effects are most distinct in the acute experiment, cardiac output remains always depressed and systemic vascular resistance stabilizes often at a higher level, compared with pretreatment values, even during long-term therapy. The antihypertensive action of beta-receptor blockers appears to be mainly due to the reduction of cardiac output. Combined alpha--beta-adrenergic blockade lowers blood pressure predominantly by alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated reduction of systemic vascular resistance both when induced acutely and during long-term administration. Owing to its beta-adrenoceptor blocking component, the increase of cardiac output is abolished: cardiac output is maintained at pretreatment levels, as is left ventricular filling pressure. Since a well-balanced blockade of both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors counteracts the hemodynamic changes occurring in the course of hypertension and tends to restore cardiovascular dynamics towards normal, combined alpha--beta-adrenoceptor blockade appears to be one of the most logical and rational therapeutical approaches to hypertension.", 
    "20": "The effective drug treatment of hypertension has become a reality over the past 25 years. People no longer need die from complications of untreated hypertension. Pharmacologic treatment is available with a variety of antihypertensive drugs: diuretics, central nervous system agents, alpha-adrenergic blockers, beta-adrenergic blockers, vasodilator, and new drugs that are still under investigation. The desired outcome of a lowered blood pressure can usually be achieved by the stepped-care approach coupled with nonpharmacologic measures. Individualization of therapy, however, is essential.", 
    "21": "The effect of antiarrhythmic drugs on myocardial refractoriness may be due to changes either in Vmax of phase 0 or the phase of repolarization of the AP or both. By using programmed electrical stimulation in combination with MAP recordings at different pacing rates in the intact dog heart, it was possible to classify and to a certain extent to elucidate the mode of action of various cardioactive drugs in vivo.", 
    "22": "The effect of substance P on the rabbit iris was investigated by continuously monitoring the pupil size in vitro. Continuous perfusion with substance P caused a concentration-dependent contraction of the iridial sphincter muscle. The threshold was 2 x 10(-10) M. A concentration-response curve was made for 60 sec exposures of the iris to substance P. Blockade of muscarinic, nicotinic, alpha-, and beta-adrenergic receptors as well as blockade with the putative presynaptic substance P-blocking agent baclofen did not affect the constrictor response to substance P. Pretreatment of the rabbits with indomethacin was also without effect. No effect of substance P was seen on the isolated iridial dilator muscle. Although the miotic response to substance P was observed in a calcium-free perfusion fluid, EGTA added to calcium-free perfusate diminished the effect of substance P. The response of the iris to substance P and the time course of the response make it likely that substance P is involved in the miosis of the nerve-mediated irritative response of the eye.", 
    "23": "The influence of animal age of drug-induced vasodilation was investigated in the perfused rat mesentery constricted with norepinephrine. Responses to isoproterenol, a beta-receptor stimulant, decreased with increasing age. Also, there was a modest decline in the relaxation produced by papaverine. In contrast, dilation of the rat mesentery by acetylcholine, histamine, or nitroglycerin either did not change with age or the responses became somewhat larger. Dobutamine, a myocardial beta-receptor stimulant, produced a marked relaxation of the mesentery. A comparison of the action of isoproterenol and dobutamine revealed that isoproterenol stimulated vascular beta-receptors, whereas dobutamine relaxed the mesentery by antagonizing the tone produced by norepinephrine. The dilation resulting from the alpha-receptor-blocking action of dobutamine was unrelated to animal age.", 
    "24": "Rats were given a slow-release depot implantation containing adrenaline (0.33 mumole/kg). Adrenaline was released from the implant, giving a plasma level of 1.0 nmole/liter the day after implantation. Adrenaline-treated rats had elevated blood pressures compared to control rats from 1 day to 8 weeks after treatment. However, 8 weeks after treatment no adrenaline from the implant was found in the plasma, suggesting that at this time factors other than the adrenaline were responsible for maintaining the rise in blood pressure. In rats given metoprolol tartrate (5 mg/kg/day, p.o.), adrenaline treatment did not increase the blood pressure.", 
    "25": "This study examined the role of cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors and cardiac sympathetic and vagal nerves in the cardiotoxicity of 3-beta-0-(4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-beta-D-glucopyranosyl) digitoxigenin hydrochloride (ASI-254). Vagally intact dogs received a constant rate intravenous infusion of either digoxin or ASI-254 in the presence and absence of practolol. Practolol pretreatment increased the dose of digoxin required to produce arrhythmias and markedly altered the pattern of toxicity, but did not alter the lethal dose. The terminal event was cardiac standstill rather than ventricular fibrillation as seen in digoxin control dogs. Practolol did not alter the toxic dose of ASI-254 and produced little change in the pattern of cardiotoxicity; both control and practolol-treated dogs died in cardiac standstill. Surgical sympathectomy did not alter the toxic dose of ASI-254, the character of toxicity, or the lethal dose compared to neurally intact dogs. However, vagal innervation may play a role in determining the type of cardiotoxicity produced by ASI-254. Vagotomy alone did not alter the toxic or the lethal dose of ASI-254; vagotomy did, however, alter the character of cardiotoxicity and terminal event. Our results indicate that ASI-254 infused intravenously does not interact with sites, central or peripheral, which activate the sympathetic nervous system. ASI-254 administered into the lateral ventricles produced signs of increased cardiac sympathetic nervous system activity. Tachycardia and arrhythmias produced by ICV ASI-254 appear to be neurally mediated since ganglionic blockade blunted these effects. These results suggest that ASI-254 is capable of interacting with central sympathetic nervous system structures, but in contrast to digoxin, access to these structures from intravenous administration is limited.", 
    "26": "In this review article on short term-effects of theophylline, results of studies with single administration of theophylline are compiled, supplemented by several studies with a therapeutic administration up to 4 Days. Data at hand show limited to moderate bronchodilatator effect of theophylline, which is comparable to beta 2-adrenergic drugs only in some studies using high dose regimen with theophylline levels of about 20 mg/l, i.e. with a considerable risk of unwanted side effects. In normal subjects no bronchodilatator effect is present at all, thus differing from beta 2-adrenergic drugs. In contrast, protection against allergic and non-allergic (exercise) stimuli is provided by theophylline already at serum levels about 3-4 mg/l, and with a dose-dependent increase of protection. These data are in accordance with in vitro-studies, demonstrating protection against leukocyte histamine release, rat passive cutaneous anaphylaxis, and mast cell degranulation. In man, there is a transient increase of alveolar ventilation via an increase of total ventilation VE, tidal column Vt, and respiratory frequency f. This phenomenon may, at least in part, be due to an increase of contractility of the respiratory muscles, as suggested by a recent study, demonstrating an inhibition of diaphragmatic fatigue by theophylline. In conclusion, theophylline seems to act via several mechanisms: bronchodilation, protection against various stimuli, increase of ventilation and muscular contractility, which might explain its clinical benefit, although less potent than other drugs as a bronchodilatator of prophylactic agent.", 
    "27": "A group of 116 patients with grade I-II (W.H.O.) essential hypertension was studied. A diuretic treatment was instituted as a first step of therapy in 50 patients while the remaining 66 were firstly treated with beta-blockers. After 6 weeks of treatment the drugs were combined in those patients who did not achieve blood pressure control; this combination therapy was again maintained for 6 weeks and, if necessary, a vasodilating agent was added thereafter. The results show that with diuretic treatment alone diastolic blood pressure was brought to normal values (less than 95 mmHg) in 3/4 of our low renin patients, in 2/3 of normal renin and in 1/3 of high renin hypertensives. On the contrary among the group of patients treated with a beta-blocker alone more than half of the high and normal renin patients were controlled whereas this goal was achieved in only 1/4 of the low renin patients. Similar behaviour was observed subdividing the subjects in young (less than 35 yrs), middle-aged (36-49 yrs) and older (greater than 50 yrs) patients. In conclusion our data indicate that age must be taken into account in classifying hypertensive patients in renin subgroups. In addition if a renin-sodium profile is available, it can be useful in choosing between diuretics or beta-blocker as a first step treatment. Alternatively, younger patients are more likely to have better hypotensive responses with beta-blockers whereas in older patients antihypertensive treatment should preferentially be started with diuretics alone.", 
    "28": "Electrical stimulation of the splanchnic nerves in anesthetized pigs was found to stimulate markedly the pancreatic secretion of glucagon. The response pattern was glucose dependent, the glucagon responses at blood glucose concentrations below 4.5 mmol x l-1 being significantly greater than those noted during stimulation at higher concentrations. Insulin secretion was stimulated weakly and variably and only at higher glucose levels. The magnitude of the glucagon response was comparable to that obtained by electrical stimulation of the thoracic vagus nerves with the same frequency. The glucagon response to combined vagal and splanchnic stimulation was nearly identical to the sum of the responses to the two types of stimulation, whereas splanchnic stimulation abolished or reduced the increase in insulin secretion elicited by vagal stimulation. Combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade markedly reduced the glucagon responses to splanchnic stimulation.", 
    "29": "In 4 Pi\u00e9train-pigs and 4 crossbred (Duroc X Landrace) pigs (32-47 kg body weight; b.w.) the effect of an intravenous injection of epinephrine (80 micrograms/kg b.w.) or isoprenaline (55 micrograms/kg b.w.) was investigated during a continuous infusion of 0.9% NaCl-solution (1 ml/min and pig), propranolol or phentolamine (priming dose 100 micrograms/kg b.w. and thereafter 2 micrograms/kg and min over 45 min) on the plasma concentration of glucose, lactate, free fatty acids (FFS) and free over 45 min) on the plasma concentration of glucose, lactate, free fatty acids (FFS) and free glycerol. Furthermore the effect of a continuous infusion of the blocking agents alone was examined in the 4 crossbred animals. Lipolysis was stimulated via beta-adrenergic receptors and was inhibited through an alpha-adrenergic mediated effect in pigs. The lean Pi\u00e9train-pigs showed a significant higher response than the crossbred pigs. The catecholamine induced increase in plasma glucose and lactate was equal in both breeds. The rise of glucose concentration resulted from an alpha- and beta-adrenergic component, with the alpha-adrenergic effect dominating. Compared to isoprenaline, the higher increase in plasma lactate after adrenaline injection is attributed to clinical reactions.", 
    "30": "Investigation of the properties of the binding of the radiolabelled antagonists (125I)-iodohydroxybenzylpindolol, (125I)-iodopindolol, and (125I)-iodocyanopindolol to beta-adrenergic receptors of L6 myoblast membranes revealed that guanine nucleotides caused a 2 to 4.5 fold increase in the apparent affinity of these antagonists. No significant effects of GTP were observed on the density of binding sites determined with each radioligand. GTP, GDP, and GMPPNP were of similar high affinity in producing this effect, while GMP was much less potent, and ATP was without effect. Under similar assay conditions GTP reduced the apparent binding affinity of the agonist isoproterenol for the beta-adrenergic receptors of L6 cells. The results indicate that, contrary to previous observations, guanine nucleotides affect not only the interactions of agonists with beta-adrenergic receptors, but also the interaction of antagonists with these adenylate cyclase-linked receptors.", 
    "31": "The different segments of the guinea pig vas deferens circular muscle exhibit differential response patterns upon pharmacological stimulation. Namely, apart from barium chloride, the affinity and intrinsic activity of certain agonists and the strength of maximum contractions they induce appear to decrease along the path from the epididymis toward the prostate. If one subdivides the vas deferens into 3 parts of equal length such as epididymal, medial and prostatic portions, then adrenaline, acetylcholine, acetyl-beta-methylcholine, dopamine, histamine and bradykinin induce contractions on each of the 3 parts; whereas tyramine, ephedrine elicit responses in the epididymal and medial portions; amphetamine, DMPP, serotonin and PGF2 alpha in turn provoking contractions exclusively on the epididymal portion. The effects of adrenaline and noradrenaline are blocked by phentolamine and tolazoline; the responses to acetylcholine, acetyl-beta-methylcholine and carbamyl-beta-methylcholine are antagonized by atropine over a specific concentration range. The effects of tyramine, ephedrine and amphetamine are inhibited by phentolamine in an remarkably low dose range (pA2 = 13.51 +/- 0.09; 14.54 +/- 0.31; 14.35 +/- 0.12). The situation was the same when tyramine-dibenamine and tyramine-phenoxybenzamine combinations were tested (pD'2 = 14.03 +/- 0.37; 13.26 +/- 0.03). Based on these findings the presence of a peculiar alpha adrenergic receptor is suggested on the sympathetic postganglionic fibres. In addition to the already identified alpha adrenergic, muscarinic cholinergic and histamine H1 receptors, we could show the presence of dopaminergic receptors too in the vas deferens circular muscle.", 
    "32": "The effects of theophylline upon cardiovascular function were studied in 8 male subjects, aged 22-33 years, before and during concomitant administration of metoprolol (50 mg every 6 h) and propranolol (40 mg every 6 h). Theophylline, as aminophylline (6.7-7.3 mg/kg) was given over 30 min. The theophylline level five minutes after completion of the aminophylline infusion was 15.9 +/- 1.8 micrograms/ml in the absence of beta blockade, 16.1 +/- 1.7 micrograms/ml during metoprolol, and 15.1 +/- 1.6 micrograms/ml during propranolol. Theophylline produced a 7% increase in mean arterial pressure which was not attenuated by either metoprolol or propranolol. Heart rate was not changed by theophylline. The QS2 Index (QS2I), a sensitive indicator of inotropism, was shortened from 488 +/- 16 to 476 +/- 16 msec (p less than 0.01) by theophylline alone. After administration of metoprolol or propranolol, theophylline produced no shortening of the QS2I. Theophylline has a mild inotropic effect in healthy subjects. This effect is prevented by pretreatment with beta-adrenergic antagonists.", 
    "33": "This study was conducted to characterize the mechanisms of hyperglycaemia in exercising sheep. Sheep were run on a treadmill for 45 min (5.5 km h-1, 8% incline) during adrenergic blockade (propranolol or phentolamine mesylate infusions) and during suppression of the rise in glucagon by infusion of somatostatin (SRIF). Propranolol did not alter the glucagon, insulin or glucose responses, except it tended to increase the metabolic clearance of glucose, presumably as a result of blocking the beta-adrenergic inhibition of glucose uptake. Phentolamine mesylate administration was associated with a suppression of the rise in glucagon concentrations, a reversal of alpha-adrenergic inhibition of insulin release and a reduction in glucose appearance during exercise. SRIF prevented the rise in glucagon and reduced insulin concentrations to below resting values. Propranolol and phentolamine mesylate did not alter the glucagon, insulin or glucose response to SRIF. However, SRIF prevented the insulin rise that occurred during phentolamine administration. The increment in glucose appearance produced in response to exercise was the same for SRIF, plus phentolamine mesylate and phentolamine mesylate in the first 25 min of exercise, but was significantly less than in the controls. During the last 20 min of exercise, glucose appearance was not significantly different from the control for any of the groups. The depression by SRIF and alpha-adrenergic blockade of the increment in glucose appearance due to exercise was associated with an impairment of the glucagon response. It appears, therefore, that glucagon may stimulate glucose production early in exercise in sheep directly, as well as by having a permissive effect.", 
    "34": "The presence of beta-adrenergic receptors on murine lymphocytes has recently been demonstrated (8). beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists have been found to alter the murine lymphocyte's response to either Concanavalin A or Lipopolysaccharide B. The regulation of the response to Concanavalin A or Lipopolysaccharide B by these beta-adrenergic ligands is most effective if the beta-adrenergic ligand is added within one hour of the addition of mitogen and at concentrations greater than 1 x 10(-7) M. The possibility that adrenergic modulation of the lymphocyte response may be beta-receptor mediated is supported by the observation of competition between adrenergic agonists and antagonists.", 
    "35": "In rat liver membranes three types of ligand binding were seen using [3H]-dihydroalprenolol (DHA) and [125I]-hydroxybenzylpindolol (HYP): binding stereospecifically displaced by beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists, binding nonstereospecifically displaced by beta-adrenergic antagonists, and binding which was not displaced by beta-adrenergic agonists or antagonists. The magnitude of the nonstereospecific displaceable binding varied with the physiological state of the animal. It was sufficient to prevent the quantitation of the stereospecific displaceable binding in some preparations from young rats but in all preparations of rats greater than 150 g or more than about 6 weeks of age. In adrenalectomized weanling rats 10-30% of the total binding was of nonstereospecific displaceable type while in control rats it comprised up to 60% of the total binding. Addition of 5 X 10(-6) M phentolamine to the assay eliminated a large proportion of the nonstereospecific displaceable binding. When phentolamine was included in the assay, liver membranes from weanling rats stereospecifically bound 30-35% of total binding; membranes from adrenalectomized rats showed stereospecific binding of up to 50 to 80%. Because the amount of displaceable, nonstereospecific binding varied greatly depending on the physiologic state of the animals, stereospecific displacement should be monitored for every type of liver membrane preparation. Furthermore, animal age is an important variable. Using the published antagonist binding methodology (DHA or HYP) in liver membranes, it is not presently possible to quantitate liver beta-adrenergic receptors in normal rats that have reached maturity.", 
    "36": "In a cross-sectional study, antihypertensive drug treatment was studied in a representative population sample of people aged 30-64 years, using a combination of postal survey, personal interview, clinical assessment and drug prescriptions. 11% of the men and 16% of the women were currently taking antihypertensives; 54% of patients used one, 38% used two, and 8% used three or more preparations. Men used slightly more drugs than women. Diuretics were used by 62% and betablockers by 49% of the sample population. Fixed combinations of thiazides and potassium-sparing agents formed 70% of all diuretic preparations used. Only 12% of the patients used fixed antihypertensive combinations, of which over half were diuretic-reserpine-vasodilator combinations; women and older patients used them most often. The most common freely combined preparations were diuretics and betablockers, which formed almost half of all two-drug combinations, and were also present in 70% of all triple combinations. Adequate control of blood pressure (DBP less than 100 mmHg) was achieved by slightly under 50% of the patients, the BP of women being more adequately controlled than that of men. Differences in BP control were found between the different drugs and combinations. Antihypertensive combination therapy is important in successful treatment, but we still cannot be sure whether fixed combination preparations or, as in this study, free combinations of marketed preparations are better alternatives for treatment.", 
    "37": "We have studied a group of 47 patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis; 27 of them have been operated, while 20 have been subjected to medical treatment. Among the surgically treated patients, 18 out of the 22 cases with an unilateral stenosis had satisfactory results and didn't assume any treatment after surgical cure. All the 5 cases of bilateral stenosis presented a regular blood pressure after surgery. Nine among the 12 patients affected by unilateral stenosis and 3 among the 8 patients presenting bilateral forms who received medical treatment had successful results with the conventional therapy. The parameters that seems give a better prognostic indication for the surgical cure are either significant renal veins renin ratios (Ra/Rc and Rc/P), either high peripheral PRA values combined with a renal artery stenosis greater than or equal to 70%, in all the cases without evident damages in the opposite kidney, even if the renin ratios are not significant. The results of the medical treatment may be predicted from the entity of the renal stenosis. Failures are more likely to occur in the bilateral forms. In these cases the most satisfactory results can be obtained using minoxidil or the inhibitor of the converting enzyme of angiotensin I.", 
    "38": "The betablocker nadolol was investigated with respect to dose-response relationship and duration of action on the basis of single-drop application in four groups of ten volunteers each. A significant dose-dependent IOP reduction could be verified between 0.3% and 2% drug concentration with increasing duration of action. The maximum IOP effect for the above concentrations was between 8 and 11.6 mmHg 3 h after drug application. The duration of action was more than 6 h for 0.3% and more than 9 h for 15 and 2% nadolol. Nadolol eye drops produced no effects on blood pressure or heart rate with either concentration and no ocular irritation.", 
    "39": "After myocardial infarction the mortality during the first post hospital year declines from approximately 10 per cent to 5 per cent during the second year. The rates of non-fatal recurrencies are similar. Mortality is related to age but not to the same extent to sex. Non-fatal recurrencies are, however, not related to age. Prediction of mortality is feasible by several prognostic models. Factors related to size of myocardial damage stand out as the important secondary risk factors for the years immediately after infarction. Most of these factors are not generally related to risk of non-fatal recurrencies. The proportion of cardiovascular deaths is 90 per cent during the first years and declines thereafter. Simplistically it may be said that the prognosis during the first years is related to the extent of the myocardial damage and thereafter primary risk factors become more important. Thus, it seems logical in the short-term perspective to influence myocardial factors and related arrhythmias and in the long-term perspective to influence primary risk factors which more likely operate on the vascular factors. Three preventive methods have demonstrated a positive benefit: 1) chronic beta-blockade, 2) cessation of smoking, 3) by-pass surgery in certain categories. After careful calculations it may be argued that at least half of the total mortality may be inhibited by beta-blockade and cessation of smoking. The impact of coronary surgery, lipid lowering and reduction of high blood pressures is more difficult to assess.", 
    "40": "The beta-blocker trials published so far may be subdivided into three different categories: 1) retrospective, 2) prospective non-conclusive, 3) prospective conclusive studies. The retrospective studies suffer the weaknesses of the retrospective method and may only be used as supportive evidence. There have so far been four prospective studies producing positive results, three with alprenolol and one with practolol. The studies presented support the concept that practolol and alprenolol reduce the long-term mortality due to sudden death from ischemic heart disease after myocardial infarction. All the studies have been criticized on various grounds and a list of unanswered remaining issues may be made. Acute and long-term effects of betablockade need not be the same. Our knowledge about the necessary doses and plasma levels is incomplete. All the studies published so far cover a maximum period of two years. If the study observation periods were prolonged it is likely that at some time the relative benefit becomes less. Ideal treatment should be reserved for those patients likely to derive significant benefit from it. At the present time identification of such patients is not sufficiently precise. Whether or not the beta-blockers have an antiarrhythmic effect, for instance demonstrated on chronic PVC's, this information is of little value in interpreting the proper mechanism of the beta-blockers in acute ischemia and lethal arrhythmias. In order to contribute new knowledge future studies should involve sufficiently large numbers of representative groups of patients, a stratified study design and a beta-blocker with ancillary properties different from alprenolol.", 
    "41": "In 1965 Snow reported a clinical trial in which treatment with propranolol significantly reduced mortality following myocardial infarction. Unfortunately the design of this trial was inadequate by modern standards, and the results must be discounted. None of the studies published since then have provided convincing evidence that beta blockers are useful following myocardial infarction. Survival after a myocardial infarction depends principally upon the amount of heart muscle that has been destroyed, and it is probably unreasonable to expect any treatment to reduce mortality by more than 20 or 30%. In patients who survive an infarction for more than 48 hours, the expected fatality rate in the next year is approximately 15%. To detect a reduction of this mortality to 10%, 2300 patients would be needed in the trial. The analysis of several of the published trials has been made difficult by a lack of data, the failure on the part of authors and journal editors to agree on a common method of presenting results, and disagreement as to whether results should be analysed on an \"all patients--intention to treat\" basis or by considering only \"clinical effectiveness\" among patients who remained on treatment. Examples of these problems will be given, together with a suggested scheme for data presentation. The 95% confidence intervals of all the randomised and double blind studies of beta blockers after myocardial infarction show that by \"intention to treat\" analysis, none demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in mortality among treated patients. Only the practolol trial was of a reasonable size, but even here total mortality was not significantly reduced; the result is in any case of only theoretical interest. The trials showing a reduction of mortality in association with alprenolol treatment are not convincing, and the stratified trial design of one of these may have given misleading results because of the relatively small number of patients involved.", 
    "42": "The value of beta-blockade and of disopyramide phosphate in the immediate treatment of patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction was assessed in two placebo controlled trials. In the first study 388 patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction were randomly allocated to treatment with propranolol, atenolol, or placebo, and when analysed on an initial intention to treat basis there was no significant difference between the three groups in respect of the mortality at one year. In addition, there was no evidence to suggest that either atenolol, or propranolol reduced the incidence of 'serious' ventricular arrhythmias in the coronary care unit. In the second study 473 patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction were randomly allocated to treatment with oxprenolol, disopyramide phosphate, or placebo. Again no significant differences were seen with respect to the mortality at six weeks. There was, however, a significantly increased incidence of heart failure in the group which received disopyramide phosphate. Patients who received this drug also showed a reduced number of dysrhythmic episodes on 24-hour ECG recordings, but this trend did not achieve statistical significance. These results suggest that none of the three beta-blockers tested nor disopyramide phosphate is likely to reduce the mortality from acute myocardial infarction when given prophylactically, although disopyramide phosphate does reduce the incidence of 'serious' ventriicular arrhythmias.", 
    "43": "Widespread interest has developed in the possibility of using beta-adrenoceptor antagonists to protect the myocardium against the deleterious consequences of an impaired coronary blood flow. The consequences include loss of active tension generating capacity, impaired mitochondrial function, destruction of tissue ultrastructure and loss of ionic homeostasis. The ionic imbalance includes loss of tissue K+ and gain in Na+ and Ca2+. Under conditions of low flow, or when coronary flow is absent, a loss of K+ from the cell must result in a localized increase in extracellular K+. This, in turn, may be sufficient to trigger arrhythmias. Theoretically beta-adrenoceptor antagonists should protect against such an ischaemic induced increase in extracellular K+. To test this hypothesis isolated Sprague-Dawley rat hearts have been pretreated with either timolol (25 micrograms/1) or propranolol (100 micrograms/l). The hearts have then been made ischaemic at 37 degrees C for 60 minutes and then reperfused. Coronary effluent collected during the first 5 minutes reperfusion showed a significant (p less than 0.001) increase in K+. This increase in coronary K+ was attenuated by prior beta-blockade. Adding the beta blockers during the phase of reperfusion had no effect on the rate of K+ loss. The significance of these results will be discussed with reference to the use of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists for the protection of ischaemic heart muscle.", 
    "44": "The effect of atropine and the beta-blocker Tobanum was studied on intrinsic heart rate (IHR) and on rapid atrial pacing carried out before and after administration of the drugs. The primary and secondary postpacing parameters were examined in both circumstances. In patients with normal IHR, return to the basic heart frequency after the drugs showed an exponential characteristic while in patients with abnormal IHR, the cycles of PPC 2-10 have lost this characteristic feature. The latter was a more characteristic electrophysiological sign of sinus node dysfunction than the recovery time of the sinus node. In patients with abnormal IHR, maximum CPPC1 is sometimes normal.", 
    "45": "The purpose of this study was to elucidate the effect of a beta 1-adrenoceptor agonist on gastric acid secretion in conscious dogs with gastric fistula. Isoprenaline, a beta 1- and beta 2-agonist was used alone and in conjunction with selective blockade of beta 2- and beta 1-receptors. Isoprenaline dose-dependently inhibited the secretory volume and the acidity. The antisecretory effect of isoprenaline was significantly blocked by the beta 1-adrenoceptor blocker practolol and by the beta 1 + beta 2-adrenoceptor blocker propranolol but not by H 35/25, a beta 2-adrenoceptor blocker. This indicates that isoprenaline acts on the acid secretion exclusively through beta 1-receptors. Dose-response experiments with five logarithmically increased doses of pentagastrin and one dose of isoprenaline showed unchanged calculated maximum response and an increase in half-maximum acid response. It is concluded that the inhibitory effect of isoprenaline on gastric acid secretion is of competitive or uncompetitive type.", 
    "46": "A multicentre study was carried out by 300 French general practitioners to evaluate the efficacy and acceptability of indapamide in a single daily dose of 2.5 mg in 2,184 patients with essential hypertension. There was a significant reduction in blood pressure, 65.7% of the patients attaining a normal blood pressure. In addition, it was found that indapamide produced an excellent reduction in blood pressure in severely hypertensive patients, including those on combined therapy with a beta-blocker. The elderly patients were found to benefit from the simple dosage and the lack of side effects such as postural hypotension. There was little change in any of the biochemical measurements.", 
    "47": "For this study hypertensive patients were selected who were taking at least a diuretic, a beta-blocker and a vasodilator. The diuretic was replaced by indapamide 2.5 mg daily. The objective was to assess the effect on blood pressure control and if possible reduce the total dose of the drugs administered, and also the side effects. 25 patients were admitted to the study. Four withdrew because of side effects. Of the remainder, blood pressure control improved in 10 patients, and in 7, some of the concomitant therapy was either withdrawn or reduced. Transient hypokalaemia developed in one patient byt the patient recovered without therapy. There was no significant increase in either serum uric acid or blood glucose.", 
    "48": "(+/-)[125Iodo] cyanopindolol (ICYP) is a radioligand which binds with an extraordinarily high affinity and specificity to beta-adrenoceptors. In contrast to (+/-) [125Ido]-hydroxybenzylpindolol (IHYP), the new ligand has neither affinity to alpha-nor to 5-HT-receptors. The dissociation constants of ICYP for beta- adrenoceptors in various tissues range from 27 to 40 pM, thereby exceeding the affinity of IHYP by a factor of approximately 3. ICYP does not discriminate between beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors. Therefore, the densities of the two receptor subtypes can be determined from competition curves of ICYP by drugs previously found to show in vitro selectivity for beta 1-adrenoceptors. The guinea pig left ventricle contains only beta 1-adrenoceptors, whereas in a lung tissue, the ratio of beta 1-to beta 2-adrenoceptors is 1 to 4. The calculated affinities of five beta 1-selective antagonists for beta 1-adrenoceptors were nearly identical in the ventricle and the lung. Kinetic studies of ICYP binding to guinea pig lung membranes indicated that the dissociation reaction consists of two components, a fast process (t 1/2 = 9 min) and a slower process (t 1/2 = 8.8 h). A mathematical treatment revealed two possibilities of interpretation: 1. Two forms of the receptor exist which are interconvertible. 2. The (+)- and (-)- enantiomers of ICYP dissociate with different rate constants. The low dissociation constant of ICYP in combination with its high specific radioactivity (2175 Ci mmole -1) allows binding studies to be carried out with small protein and ligand concentrations, e.g. 3 microgram protein per assay in guinea pig lung membranes.", 
    "49": "Pharmacoelectroencephalography is a new methodology using clinical pharmacological research designs and the method of electroencephalography, and its parametrisation by computer analysis. Pharmacoelectroencephalography is considered to be the most sensitive method for describing drug effects on the human CNS on a functional electrophysiological level. There is an unrevoked hypothesis that all drugs effecting the CNS do reflect those effects in well designed, well conducted and well analysed pharmacoelectroencephalographical studies. On the other hand, if a systematic pharmacoelectroencephalographical study does not verify an effect, then, according to this hypothesis, the drug does not have functional effects on the CNS. The EEG however, is not a direct indicator of toxic effects on the central nervous system. Therefore, from lack of pharmacoelectroencephalographical effects it cannot be concluded that a drug has no toxic effects on the CNS. Pharmacoelectroencephalography has been used to show the efficacy of drugs on a functional CNS level, to establish dose- and time relationships of CNS active drugs, and to suggest dosage levels for therapeutic use and time intervals for their application. Furthermore, with pharmacoelectroencephalography a drug's influence on vigilance and vigilance regulation can be described, and substances can - within certain limits - be screened for their eventual psychotropic properties. It will be demonstrated that pharmacoelectroencephalography provides a sensitive and very useful method for clinical pharmacology, without which the development of new drugs is nowadays almost impossible. However, there are strict limitations for the use of this method and the interpretation of its results: The EEG is not sufficiently validated externally. It is an experimental model based on the electrical activity of the awake brain. The meaning of the changes in this activity is almost completely unknown. Although it has been possible to classify a high number of psychotropic drugs into a predetermined five drug class system on the basic of their EEG effects (19) and although certain drugs have been found whose psychotropic properties were predicted from the EEG (26), it is not possible to describe a drug's psychotropic properties by means of the EEG. The EEG indicates CNS effects, but not necessarily psychotropic properties, even though useful information can be obtained at very early stages in a drug's development, about its influence on vigilance and the organization of the brain's electrical activity.", 
    "50": "1. Six healthy male volunteers received equivalent intravenous beta-blocking doses of propranolol, practolol and betaxolol (SL75212) or saline at weekly intervals Sixty minutes later 0.1 unit/kg insulin was given intravenously. 2. In all studies, maximum hypoglycaemia (mean 1.2 mmol/l) was reached thirty minutes after insulin. Recovery from hypoglycaemia was delayed with propranolol but practolol and betaxolol had no effect. 3. Propranolol blocked the tachycardia and widening of pulse pressure seen in saline treated subjects. It also blocked the rebound rise in free fatty acids (FFA) and glycerol concentrations that followed the nadir of hypoglycaemia. 4. Neither practolol nor betaxolol had significant effects on pulse rate or blood pressure but betaxolol resembled propranolol in blocking the rebound rise in FFA and glycerol, while practolol blocked the rise in glycerol alone. 5. The magnitude of the rise in growth hormone following hypoglycaemia was similar in all groups, but the peak was earlier after practolol and betaxolol.", 
    "51": "Relatively selective beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic agonists (tazolol and terbutaline) and antagonists (metoprolol and butoxamine) were topically applied to albino rabbit eyes and to isolated ciliary epithelium. The beta 2-agonist, terbutaline, was the most effective agent in reducing intraocular pressure although all compounds induced changes in aqueous humor formation rate and pseudofacility. The effects on the isolated ciliary epithelium were determined on tissues derived from both normal and superior cervical ganglionectomized eyes. The beta 1- and beta 2-agonists as well as the beta 1-antagonist induced large permeability increases while the beta 2-antagonist induced a small permeability increase in normal tissues. In ganglionectomized tissues the beta 1-antagonist effect was decreased and the beta 2-antagonist effect enhanced while the agonist effects were almost unchanged. The results show that both beta 1- and beta 2-receptors exist in the ciliary epithelium and that stimulation of either receptor leads to an increase in fluid permeability and alterations in aqueous dynamics.", 
    "52": "In two studies including 73 patients the stress reducing effects of the tranquilizer Cloxazolam (Olcadil) and the beta-receptor-blocking drug pindolol (Visken) were investigated after the application of a single oral dose (3 mg Cloxazolam, 5 mg pindolol). The drugs were tested against placebo by the double blind method. After local anesthesia and during oral surgery an increase of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH)-activity, noradrenaline-, c-AMP-, ACTH and cortisol concentration was found in the placebo group. Cloxazolam antagonized all these effects, except the increase of the plasma levels of c-GMP under surgical stress. After pindolol noradrenaline concentration, DBH-activity, and c-AMP concentration were no longer increased during oral surgery. But the hypothalamic and adrenal stimulation were still present and resulted in an unchanged stress reaction of ACTH and cortisol concentration in plasma. In conclusion, the application of the beta-receptor-blocking drug pindolol prevents the stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system by suppressing the stress induced increase of plasma system by suppressing the stress induced increase of plasma noradrenaline and by blockade of peripheral beta-receptor sites. Cloxazolam reduces hypothalamic and adrenal reaction as well as peripheral ones due to stress."
