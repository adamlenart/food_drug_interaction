Clinic brachial BP and 24-hour ambulatory BP, carotid BP, left ventricular mass index, CCA intima-media thickness, lumen diameter, intima-media area, and carotid blood flow were measured. Distensibility, circumferential tensile stress, Young's elastic modulus (E(m)), and shear stress (tau) in the CCA were also calculated.", 
    "3": "Both candesartan and atenolol reduced intima-media thickness and intima-media area and increased distensibility to similar extents after 52 weeks of treatment.

Isoprenaline increased transgene expression from MIECMV up to 8-fold (P<0.001), but had no effect on a promoter containing no CRE. The effect of isoprenaline was inhibited by beta-blockade and by specific CRE-decoy oligonucleotides. Beta-blockers did not reduce transgene expression below basal levels. After adenovirus-mediated porcine intracoronary gene transfer, however, beta-blockade reduced beta-galactosidase expression by up to 250-fold compared with non-beta-blocked animals (P<0.01).",

BP and HR were measured telemetrically after a single intraperitoneal application of NEB or MET at 07.00 and 19.00 h in male rats and at 19.00 h in proestrus female rats. The two beta-blockers varied in time of decreasing BP and HR and also in duration. In males, MET decreased BP and HR for few hours exclusively when applied at the onset of the activity phase (i.e., at 19.00 h), while after its application at 07.00 h, BP and HR were unchanged. In females, MET also caused a short-lasting BP and HR reduction, with the effect being more pronounced than in males. In males, NEB at either dosing time decreased HR and BP to a greater extent than did MET. This effect was evident both during the activity and rest periods and persisted for at least five days. In females, NEB provoked a similar, but more pronounced, effect on BP and HR in comparison to males. These findings demonstrate that significant gender-dependent differences in the circadian profile of BP and HR exist. BP and urinary NOx as well as eNOS expression are inversely correlated, and the cardiovascular effects of NEB and MET vary, depending on the time of application as well as gender.",

Only one of the five cases had a raised blood pressure at the time of the acute presentation. Initiation of beta blockers in four patients was associated with further deterioration in haemodynamic status, labile blood pressure and cardiac arrhythmias, which led to the diagnosis of the underlying phaeochromocytoma. Following intensive supportive therapy and alpha blockade, all five patients recovered and underwent elective surgical removal of phaeochromocytoma, uneventfully.",

However, the effects of these substances on the cardiovascular system of higher vertebrates are not very well documented. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a cardioexcitatory substance (CES) isolated from the eyestalk of the shrimp Peneaus vanameii on rat cardiovascular function. The administration of a purified fraction of this substance raised mean arterial pressure by 37.33 +/- 5.00 mm Hg, pulse pressure 35.00 +/- 4.93 mm Hg and heart rate 80.00 +/- 12.83 beats/min over basal values (p < 0.01). Evaluation of the possible underlying mechanisms of this hypertensive and tachycardic effect reveled that dihydroergotamine pretreatment (20 microg/0.2 mL) reduced the effect of CES on mean blood pressure, but not on heart rate. Propranolol pretreatment (4 microg/0.2 mL) reduced the tachycardia, but not the hypertensive response. Enalapril pretreatment (5 microg/0.2 mL) did not modify the effects induced by CES on heart rate or blood pressure, and the verapamil pretreatment (1 microg/0.2 mL) reduced both cardiovascular changes by 85% (p < 0.01). These results indicate that CES isolated from the shrimp eyestalk produces hypertension and tachycardia mediated by adrenergic receptors in association to calcium channels activation.", 
    "17": "The prognostic value of heart rate (HR) was analysed based on the reports from the literature in the general population and in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Multivariate analyses showed that elevated resting HR was found to be an independent predictor of total and cardiovascular mortality. The behaviour of HR during exercise testing was predictive of sudden death. The beneficial effects of betablockers in post-infarction patients are well established. Calcium channel blockers that increase resting HR are associated with a deleterious effect on mortality. Therefore, resting HR should not be overlooked in risk stratification of CAD patients. Reduction of resting HR should be viewed as an attractive therapeutic target in CAD patients.",

Finally, 498 patients, aged 22-98 years (mean age 69+/-12 years) in whom creatinine concentration was measured and creatinine clearance was estimated at admission with the Cockroft-Gault quotation and with long-term follow-up results obtained, were enrolled in the study.

The incidence of re-hospitalisation for cardiovascular reasons (CHF worsening, myocardial infarction, stroke) was significantly higher in patients with renal dysfunction (70% vs 55%, p <0.005). Multivariate analysis of all factors affecting one-year mortality demonstrated that renal dysfunction is a strong and independent risk factor for death in patients with CHF (RR=2.13, 95% CI: 1.31-3.45; p <0.05) and it increases the risk of re-hospitalisation (RR=1.53, 95% CI: 1.01-2.14; p <0.05).",

    "24": "beta-Blockers have generally demonstrated smaller reductions in cardiovascular events, compared with other antihypertensive classes, despite similar reductions in blood pressure. This may be due to the ineffectiveness of traditional beta-blockers, such as atenolol, in reducing central aortic pressure, a strong, independent predictor of cardiovascular outcome. However, the beta-blocker class is heterogeneous, and some newer beta-blockers, which exhibit vasodilatory effects independent of beta-blockade, provide beneficial effects on arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction, which may lead to reductions in central aortic pressure and improvements in clinical outcomes. For example, the vasodilating beta-blocker nebivolol was shown to improve forearm blood flow and arterial stiffness and, in a large clinical study, to significantly reduce morbidity and mortality, independent of left ventricular ejection fraction, among patients with chronic heart failure. Further research is warranted to investigate any potential differences between traditional and newer vasodilating beta-blockers on cardiovascular outcomes.",

    "30": "The butanol extract of Phellinus igniarius (BPI) induced relaxation of the phenylephrin e-precontracted rat aorta in a dose-dependent manner, and its effect was abolished by the removal of functional endothelium. Pretreatment of the aortic tissues with N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), methylene blue, or 1H-[1,2,4]-oxadiazole-[4,3-alpha]-quinoxalin1-one (ODQ) inhibited the vascular relaxation induced by BPI. BPI-induced vascular relaxations were also markedly attenuated by the addition of verapamil or diltiazem, while the relaxant effect of BPI was not blocked by pretreatment with indomethacine, glibenclamide, tetraethylammonium (TEA), atropine, or propranolol. Incubation of endothelium-intact rat aorta with BPI increased the production of cGMP in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that BPI dilates vascular smooth muscle via endothelium-dependent nitric oxide-cGMP signaling pathway, with the possible involvement of L-type Ca(2+) channels.", 
    "31": "The objective of this study was to develop a general method to assess the intestinal permeability of poorly water-soluble drugs where low-aqueous drug solubility requires conduct of experiments under solubilizing experimental conditions. The permeability (Papp) of diazepam (DIA) was assessed across excised rat jejunum in the absence (Pappcontrol) and presence (Pappuncorr) of polysorbate-80 (PS-80). The micellar association constant (Ka) of DIA, estimated via equilibrium solubility studies, was used to correct Pappuncorr data and obtain an estimate of the true permeability coefficient (Pappcorr). An alternate approach was also developed (the reciprocal permeability approach) to allow direct estimation of Pappcorr without the need for independent estimation of Ka. The approach was further examined experimentally using a range of model drugs. DIA Pappcorr values obtained using the Ka from equilibrium solubility studies deviated from Papp(control) values, especially at PS-80 concentrations above 0.1% w/v. In contrast, data obtained using the reciprocal permeability method were consistent with Pappcontrol across the PS-80 concentration range. Similar trends were observed with propranolol (PRO), antipyrine (ANT), naproxen (NAP), and cinnarizine (CIN). The reciprocal permeability approach therefore provides a simple and accurate method by which the permeability of poorly water-soluble compounds may be estimated under solubilizing conditions.",

Group A received loading dose of clopidogrel (300 mg) in addition to conventional therapy (TLT, aspirin, statin, ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker). Group B received only conventional therapy. The follow-up was 6 months after inclusion during which patients in group A continued to receive clopidogrel (75 mg/day after Day 2 of the study). Primary endpoint included death, re-infarction, recurrence of angina and bleedings. In addition, changes of ST segment after TLT and local contractility were assessed.",

    "37": "The hepatic uptake of imipramine and propranolol was investigated after incubation with isolated rat hepatocytes over a wide concentration range (0.04-400 microM). The cell-to-medium concentration ratio (K(p)) was concentration-dependent and could be described using a two-site binding model incorporating a high affinity/low capacity site and a linear component for a site which was apparently not saturated. Maximum (at 0.04 microM) and minimum K(p) values (at 400 microM) were 360 and 280, and 110 and 70 for imipramine and propranolol, respectively. During these incubations, metabolism was inhibited using aminobenzotriazole (an irreversible inhibitor of cytochrome P450). Pretreatment of cells either by freeze-thawing or with saponin (which permeabilizes the plasma membrane) eliminated the saturable process. The saturable uptake process of imipramine was also inhibited by 18 other lipophilic amine drugs (including propranolol). This uptake component may involve membrane transporter(s), whereas the nonsaturable component probably represents partition into the phospholipid component of membranes. Propranolol was further investigated to determine the impact of high K(p) values on hepatocellular clearance. The area under the curve for propranolol concentrations in the total incubate (medium including the cells) from the depletiontime profile was substantially greater than the corresponding area under the curve for the drug concentration in the extracellular medium, and this difference approximated the nonsaturable uptake component. It is concluded that the clearance of propranolol in isolated hepatocytes is not rate-limited by hepatic uptake and is directly proportional to unbound drug concentration, being independent of the higher K(p) value.", 
    "38": "This study investigated whether genetic selection on a divergent behavioural trait of fearfulness (tonic immobility duration) was related to changes in the nervous control of the heart. Quail selected for either long or short tonic immobility (LTI or STI, respectively) duration was compared with an unselected control line (CTI). The autonomic control of the heart was assessed by heart rate variability analysis and pharmacological blockades. Quail were surgically fitted with a telemetric device. Heart rate before injection did not differ between the three lines. The vagal-sympathetic effect (VSE) at rest differed significantly from 1 in CTI and STI quail, suggesting that parasympathetic activity was dominant. In LTI quail, VSE did not differ from 1, suggesting a balance between parasympathetic and sympathetic activities. The intrinsic heart rate reached after the successive injections of propranolol and atropine did not differ between lines and was higher than the heart rate at rest in STI, which was in line with results of VSE at rest. After atropine injection, the sympathetic activity indicated by the low-frequency power was lower in CTI than in the two selected quail. After propranolol injection, the parasympathetic activity indicated by the root of the mean squares of successive differences and the high-frequency power was higher in STI than in CTI and LTI quail. Selection on tonic immobility duration thus appears to be associated with changes in the sympathovagal control of the heart, which may influence behavioural responses to stressful situations.",

    "43": "Currently it is generally accepted that an individual's genetic makeup can modify the efficacy of drug treatment or the risk of adverse reactions. Although not a new concept, the availability of human genome sequence and rapid genotyping at variable loci in drug targets or metabolizing genes has provided new opportunities for the field termed \"pharmacogenetics\". Somewhat surprisingly, multiple studies have shown the existence of common variants (polymorphisms) in members of the G-protein coupled receptor superfamily, which constitute around 50% of all the targets of currently prescribed drugs. The beta1-adrenergic receptors (beta1ARs) are interesting candidates for pharmacogenetic studies in two complex cardiovascular disease, heart failure and hypertension, since they mediate the effects of catecholamines in the sympathetic nervous system. These receptors are involved in the progression and treatment (beta-blockers therapy) of both diseases, and have polymorphisms that show altered function or regulation as compared to their allelic counterparts in recombinant expression systems and genetically modified mice. These results have prompted prospective and retrospective clinical studies examining whether polymorphisms of these genes are risk factors, disease modifiers, or predictors of b-blocker response in heart failure and hypertension. To date, it appears that beta1AR variants are very likely one genetic component that defines responsiveness to beta-blockers in heart failure and hypertension. Altogether, results are promising, but discrepancies between studies require resolution before these polymorphisms can be utilized in practice. With the goal of personalizing therapy based on an individual's genetic makeup, additional adequately powered, multiethnic, multi-drug studies will be needed.",

    "49": "The 5'-HS4 chicken beta-globin insulator functions as a positional enhancer blocker on chromatinized episomes in human cells, blocking the HS2 enhancer of the human beta-globin locus control region from activating a downstream epsilon-globin gene. 5'-HS4 interrupted formation of a domain of histone H3 and H4 acetylation encompassing the 6-kb minilocus and inhibited transfer of RNA polymerase from the enhancer to the gene promoter. We found that the enhancer blocking phenotype was amplified when the insulated locus contained a weakened HS2 enhancer in which clustered point mutations eliminated interaction of the transcription factor GATA-1. The GATA-1 mutation compromised recruitment of histone acetyltransferases and RNA polymerase II to HS2. Enhancer blocking correlated with a significant depletion of nucleosomes in the core region of the insulator as revealed by micrococcal nuclease and DNase I digestion studies. Nucleosome depletion at 5'-HS4 was dependent on interaction of the insulator protein CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and was required for enhancer blocking. These findings provide evidence that a domain of active chromatin is formed by spreading from an enhancer to a target gene and can be blocked by a nucleosome-free gap in an insulator.",

Spontaneously differentiated murine (C57BL/6) ESC-CMs were cultured for 21 days. At different stages, growth characteristics of the CMs were assessed by immunocytochemistry, RT-PCR, transmission electron microscopy, and by addition of chronotropic drugs. EB-derived spontaneously beating cells expressed markers characteristic of CMs including alpha-actinin, desmin, troponin I, sarcomeric myosin heavy chain (MHC), pan-cadherin, connexin 43, cardiac alpha-MHC, cardiac beta-MHC, atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), and myosin light chain isoform-2V (MLC-2V) and responded to drugs in a maturation- and dose-dependent manner.

In 7+21 days CMs, all sarcomeric components, such as Z-discs, A-, I- and H-bands as well as M-lines, T-tubules, intercalated discs, and the sarcoplasmic reticulum were present.

Human serum albumin is coated on the gold film surface of the proposed biosensor to detect the concentration of beta-blocker, which is a remedy for heart disease. As the applied voltage increases such that the effective index of guided mode rises, the SPR wavelength shifts toward the long wavelength side and the output optical intensity at the wavelength of 632.8 nm diminishes. The linear regression slope of the relation between the measurand and the applied voltage is dependent on the analyte concentration and can be used to determine the concentration variation. Experimental results measured by the electro-optically modulated SPR methods are compared with those measured by the conventional spectral and intensity methods, and the effects of waveguide width on the biosensor performance are discussed.", 
    "52": "This study was conducted to assess the site of drug absorption in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract after oral administration. Drug permeability to different regions of rat intestine, jejunum, ileum and colon, was measured by in situ single-pass perfusion method. It was revealed that the epithelial surface area should not be a determinant of the regional difference in the intestinal permeability of highly permeable drugs. Effects of the mucus layer at the surface of the epithelium and the fluidity of the epithelial cell membrane on the drug permeability were investigated. These factors are demonstrated to contribute to the regional differences in intestinal drug permeability. The luminal drug concentration in each segment of the GI tract after oral administration was measured directly in fasted rats. Water ingested orally was absorbed quickly in the jejunum and the luminal fluid volume was diminished in the middle to lower part of the small intestine. According to the absorption of water luminal concentration of atenolol, a drug with low permeability, was elevated and exceeded the initial dose concentration. In contrast, the concentration of highly permeable drugs, antipyrine and metoprolol, decreased quickly in the upper part of the intestine and a significant amount of drugs was not detected in the lower jejunum and the ileum. From the time-profiles of luminal drug concentration, fraction of dose absorbed from each segment of the GI tract was calculated. Both antipyrine and metoprolol were found to be absorbed quickly at the upper part of the small intestine. In addition, the possible contribution of gastric absorption was demonstrated for these drugs. The pattern of site-dependent absorption of atenolol showed the higher absorbability in the middle and lower portion of the jejunum. These informations on site-dependent absorption of drugs are considered to be important for effective oral delivery systems.", 
    "53": "The signal transduction pathways of intracellular calcium and adenosin 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) participate in the regulation of intrahepatic metabolism of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL). The adrenoceptors are linked to calcium and cAMP signal transduction pathways so it is proposed that they may be involved in the regulation of VLDL secretion. The current study is designed to test the effects of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists on triacylglycerol secretion in freshly isolated rat hepatocytes. The inhibitory effect of epinephrine appeared at concentrations of more than 1 microM and reached a plateau at 100 microM. Epinephrine concentration for the half of the maximal bio-effect (EC(50)) was about 10 microM. Epinephrine at a concentration of 10 microM suppressed the secretion of triacylglycerol by 33% (P<or=0.01) and increased cellular content of triacylglycerol (18%, P<or=0.05) and total phospholipids (20%, P<or=0.05). Time course experiments for triacylglycerol secretion exhibited a linear relationship with a slope of 8.2+/-0.6 mug triacylglycerol/3 h mg cell protein. In the presence of epinephrine, cellular triacylglycerol and total phospholipids were slightly but significantly higher than the respective control at all points of time examined. The inhibitory effect elicited by epinephrine (10 microM) was abolished by the inclusion of the general alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine (10 microM) and the specific alpha(1)-antagonist prazosin (1 microM) but not with the nonselective beta-antagonist propranolol (10 microM). Trifluoperazine an alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist and anticalmodulin agent, concealed the inhibitory effect of epinephrine in a concentration dependent manner, whereas theobromine a cAMP-phosphodiestrase inhibitor did not have any significant effect. The secretion of triacylglycerol was decreased not only by the alpha-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine (10 microM) but also by the beta-agonist isoproterenol (10 microM). Dibutyryl-cAMP (0.1 mM) also inhibited the secretion of triacylglycerol by 30% (P<or=0.01). The results suggest that epinephrine inhibits the secretion of triacylglycerol from rat hepatocytes via the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor while stimulation of beta- as well as alpha-adrenoceptors can also exert a similar effect.",

    "57": "Of the 25,268 patients, 71.3% had hyperlipidemia, and 66.8% were prescribed lipid-lowering drugs. AF prevalence was 25.1% in patients taking lipid-lowering drugs compared with 32.6% in untreated hyperlipidemic patients and 32.8% in patients without hyperlipidemia (P <.001 for both comparisons). In multivariable analysis, lipid-lowering drug use remained significantly associated with reduced odds of AF (odds ratio [OR] 0.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64-0.74), and this effect was larger than that of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.79-0.92) or beta-blockers (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.88-1.02). The beneficial impact of lipid-lowering drugs on AF risk was independent of their effects on the lipid profile.

This effect is larger than that of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers or beta-blockers and may be the result of the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of statins and fibrates.", 
    "59": "Few recent studies have demonstrated similar quality of care for hospitalized black and white patients with heart failure (HF). However, systematic evaluation of racial differences in both the quality of care and outcomes is needed in the outpatient setting, where most patients with HF are treated and where care may be more fragmented.",

    "67": "Cardiovascular effects of Labd-8 (17)-en-15-oic acid (Labd-8), a labdenic diterpene isolated from methanolic extract of Moldenhawera nutans were investigated in normotensive rats. Additionally, this study examined the role of autonomic nervous system in the mediation of these cardiovascular effects. In pentobarbital-anesthetized rats, bolus intravenous (i.v.) injection of Labd-8 (1-10 mg/kg) induced dose-dependent hypotensive and tachycardiac responses. After cervical bivagotomy, hypotensive responses to Labd-8 were significantly enhanced whereas the tachycardia was completely abolished. In conscious rats, Labd-8 (1-10 mg/kg, i.v.) also decreased blood pressure and increased heart rate in a dose-dependent manner. Pretreatment with methylatropine (1 mg/kg, i.v.) or propranolol (2 mg/kg, i.v.) significantly reduced the tachycardia evoked by Labd-8 without affecting the hypotension. Blockade of ganglionic neurotransmission with hexamethonium (30 mg/kg, i.v.) reduced and abolished the hypotensive and tachycardic effects of Labd-8, respectively. However, hypotensive effects of Labd-8 were not reduced by pretreatment with N(w)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 20 mg/kg, i.v.), a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor. In rat endothelium-containing aorta preparations, Labd-8 (1-1000 micro g/ml) induced a concentration-dependent reduction of potassium (60 mM)-induced contraction [IC(50) (geometric mean +/-95% confidence interval)=313.6 (191.4-513.8) micro g/ml], an effect that remained unaffected [IC(50)=440.8 (225.1-863.3) micro g/ml] by removal of vascular endothelium. These results show that i.v. treatment with Labd-8-induced dose-dependent hypotensive and tachycardiac effects in both conscious and anesthetized rats. The tachycardia is mediated reflexly through inhibition of vagal and activation of sympathetic drive to the heart. The hypotension is mainly due to withdrawal of sympathetic tone to the vasculature and also partly to an active vascular relaxation. Released nitric oxide from vascular endothelial cells is not involved in the mediation of Labd-8-induced hypotension.", 
    "68": "The aim of the study was to compare the hypotensive effect and safety of carvedilol, a non-selective alpha-beta blocker, and monopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi), in patients with arterial hypertension and a chronic renal disease. The main group (MG), 26 patients, was treated with carvedilol, which was administered as a hypotensive agent instead of the ACEi. The control group (CG) included 24 patients on a \"standard\" therapy with hypothiazide 12.5 mg a day, amlodipine 10 mg a day, and monopril 20 mg a day. Patients who received carvedilol displayed an earlier hypotensive effect (HE). Together with HE realization, the patients of both groups displayed a moderate increase in glomerular filtration (not more than by 10 ml/min), and an increase in creatinine blood level (not more than by 15%) during the first two weeks, which can be explained by a decrease in intraglomerular hypertension. A significant decrease in total cholesterol level and a more pronounced regress of left ventricular myocardial hypertrophy were noticed in the MG vs. the CG. Measurement of the serum levels of cortisol, aldosterone, and angiotensin I showed that the patients of the MG displayed a significant decrease in aldosterone level together with a clear tendency of cortisol level increase. The concentrations of these hormones in CG patients did not change significantly. The result demonstrate that prolonged administration of carvedilol leads to a noticeable decrease in the serum level of aldosterone, an increase in cortisol level, and electrolyte changes, such as an increase in sodium level and a decrease in potassium level in blood plasma.",

The Karvonen training heart rate was significantly lower than the heart rate at the anaerobic threshold (91+/-5 versus 102+/-17 bpm, P<0.0001) in the first sample of patients and this difference was clinically relevant in 40% of patients. Thus, a 'modified Karvonen training heart rate', equal to 0.8xx(maximum heart rate-resting heart rate)+resting heart rate, was calculated by linear regression in the derivation sample and prospectively assessed in the validation sample. The modified Karvonen training heart rate was closer to the heart rate at the anaerobic threshold than the Karvonen training heart rate, and the difference between the modified Karvonen training heart rate and the heart rate at the anaerobic threshold was clinically relevant in only 5% of patients.",

To control for potential bias related to use of statin therapy, the study estimated propensity scores by logistic regression to determine the predicted probability of inclusion in the \"statin\" group. Multivariate, stepwise logistic regression was then performed, controlling for patient demographics, medical history, operative characteristics, and propensity score to determine whether preoperative statin therapy was independently associated with a reduction in the risk of early (DOS-POD3) cardiac death and/or nonfatal, in-hospital postoperative myocardial infarction.",

    "81": "Progressive cardiac dilatation and pump failure of unknown etiology has been termed idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). During recent years a large body of data has accumulated indicating that functionally active antibodies or autoantibodies being able to recognize and to stimulate the cardiac beta(1)-adrenergic receptor (anti-beta(1)-AR) may play an important role in the initiation and/or clinical course of DCM. Recent experiments in rats even point towards a cause-and-effect relation between stimulatory anti-beta(1)-AR antibodies and DCM. Immunization of rats against the second extracellular loop of the human beta(1)-adrenergic receptor (100% sequence-identity between human and rat) resulted in both development of stimulatory anti-beta(1)-AR antibodies and development of progressive cardiac dilatation and dysfunction. Isogenic transfer of stimulatory anti-beta(1)-AR from cardiomyopathic into healthy inbred animals reproduced the disease, hence providing conclusive proof for a beta(1)-receptor-directed autoimmune attack as a possible cause of cardiomyopathy. This kind of cardiomyopathy is now referred to as anti-beta(1)-AR-induced dilated immune-cardiomyopathy (DiCM). The following article reviews recent evidence obtained from experimental animal-models implying a significant role of the cardiac beta(1)-adrenergic receptor as a pathophysiologically and clinically relevant autoantigen also in human DCM.", 
    "82": "Peripherally administered beta3-adrenergic receptor (beta3-AR) agonists stimulate lipolysis and inhibit food intake. To test the hypothesis that this inhibition of feeding is due to a substrate-driven increase in hepatic fatty acid oxidation (FAO), we assessed the ability of the FAO inhibitor mercaptoacetate (MA) to reverse the feeding-inhibitory effect of the beta3-AR agonist CGP 12177A (CGP). Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats received intraperitoneal injections of 1 mg/kg CGP, of 45.6 mg/kg MA, or of both drugs, and the effects on food intake, plasma free fatty acids (FFA), and plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), an indicator for hepatic FAO, were assessed. Control rats received saline injections. CGP significantly reduced food intake after 0.5 and 6 h and increased plasma FFA and BHB at 0.5 h, suggesting increased lipolysis and hepatic FAO. MA completely reversed the increase in plasma BHB and thus appeared to effectively abolish CGP's effect on hepatic FAO, but MA failed to affect CGP's feeding-inhibitory action. These findings do not support the hypothesis that the beta3-AR agonist CGP inhibits feeding by enhancing hepatic FAO or ketogenesis. Although the beta3-AR agonist CGP reduced saccharin intake in a one-bottle condition taste aversion test, it seems unlikely that the hypophagic effect of CGP is elicited by malaise.",

However, the potential role of RAS inhibition on expression transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta-Smads in hepatic fibrosis remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect and mechanism of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (perindopril) and an angiotensin II receptor blocker (valsartan) on TGF-beta1 and TGF receptor II (TRII) mRNA, Smad3 and Smad7 in fibrotic hepatic livers in rats.",

    "88": "The most frequent complication suffered by critically ill patients is sepsis, with encephalopathy as the main manifestation, and this has a direct effect on their prognosis. Polyneuropathy of the critically ill patient is linked to sepsis, as the main precipitating factor, as well as to the presence of high levels of glucose, which plays an important role in deciding whether mechanical ventilation can be withdrawn or not. Myopathy of the critically ill patient is related to the use of fluorinated steroids and neuromuscular blockers, which are frequently administered to these patients. All these entities represent a significant diagnostic challenge for the physician and are accompanied by important sequelae that continue after the patient's discharge from hospital, as well as myopathies and neuropathies associated to the use of drugs that are commonly administered to critically ill patients. It is therefore necessary to be familiar with the pathophysiology of the damage and with the associated factors, if a suitable diagnostic approach is to be employed.",

    "90": "The reactivities of the amine-containing pharmaceuticals fluoxetine and metoprolol with hypochlorite were studied using conditions that simulate wastewater disinfection including neutral pH (7.0), a range of reaction times (2-60 min), and a molar excess of hypochlorite relative to the pharmaceutical concentration (5.7 times). The reactions were monitored using liquid chromatography (LC) with several detection modes including ultraviolet absorbance (UV), mass spectrometry (MS), and post-column reaction/reductive electrochemistry (EC) for determining active chlorine products. At levels of 10 microM, both compounds reacted rapidly (<2 min) to form principally N-chloramine products that were stable in aqueous solution for at least 1h. The reaction was also studied in wastewater, and similar reactivity was noted. These results demonstrate that the cations fluoxetine and metoprolol are likely to be rapidly transformed into neutral N-chloramines during wastewater disinfection. The reactivity of the N-chloramines was also studied with sulfite to simulate dechlorination, which is often employed in wastewater treatment. Both N-chloramines reacted slowly with sulfite. In the pure water dechlorination experiments, it was estimated that 70% and 10% of the peak areas remained after 2 min reaction time for fluoxetine and metoprolol, respectively. At longer reaction times both N-chloramines had been completely reduced by sulfite, and the product of the sulfite reduction reaction was the parent pharmaceutical amine. Since typical dechlorination times in wastewater treatment are on the order of seconds, this suggests the chloramines formed from these two basic drugs might evade dechlorination and be released into the environment. The implications of chloramine release are discussed.",

    "95": "Perioperative atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most frequent complications of cardiac surgery. Its development is associated with an increased morbidity and mortality, for example from perioperative stroke, as well as ventricular arrhythmias, postoperative myocardial infarction, congestive cardiac failure, renal failure, increased use of inotropic medications and the need for intra-aortic balloon pump. Furthermore, AF after cardiac surgery results in prolonged hospitalization after the procedure, as well as an excess utilization of hospital resources and increased hospital costs. Given the importance of AF for patient outcome, a wide variety of prophylactic pharmacologic strategies have been evaluated. The risk of post-operative AF should be reduced by the administration of amiodarone, a beta-blocker, sotalol or rate-limiting calcium antagonists. In addition, in patients undergoing cardiac surgery on pre-existing beta-blocker therapy, this treatment should be continued unless contraindications develop (such as post-operative bradycardia or hypotension). Unless contraindicated, a rhythm control strategy is recommended as the initial option for the treatment of post-operative AF following cardiothoracic surgery. More recently, some data regarding magnesium, statins and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in reducing post-op AF are available. Clearly, perspectives are changing in our management of this common arrhythmia.", 
    "96": "The interpretation of congestive heart failure (CHF) in '80 was exclusively in haemodynamic terms. In accordance with such a pathophysiologic hypothesis, cardiovascular drugs, mainly positive inotropics and/or vasodilators were experimented with not significative results. From the second half of the 80's the attention starts focusing on the neurohumoral asset, strongly activated in patients suffering from CHF and that was it selves cause of worsening of CHF and responsible for the poor prognosis of these patients, so as to become therapeutic targets and to represent the rationale for using ace-inhibitors (ACE-I), betablockers and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). Evidence has been provided that these drugs can reduce morbidity and mortality. However, this evidence derives only from studies on general population. In uraemic patients there are no controlled trials dedicated and the nephrological guidelines recommends the use of ACE-I on the hypothesis that they may have similar efficacy than non uremic patients. Among all the medications used to treat CHF in the general population, only betablockers has been shown to be effective in a randomized trial in the dialysis population. Carvedilol was found to improve left ventricular function and decrease hospitalization, cardiovascular deaths and total mortality, remarking that pathophysiology, rationale for using and results may be similar in uremic and non uremic patients suffering from CHF.", 
    "97": "Lowering blood pressure (BP) in hypertensive patients reduces morbidity and mortality. However the long-term safety of some antihypertensive agents was a matter of concern. Diuretic, the gold standard treatment in hypertension may impair glucose tolerance and thereby accelerate the development of diabetes mellitus. It was also associated with increased cardiovascular mortality in diabetic patients. However, recent evidence showed that low-medium dose of thiazide diuretic especially when given in combination with potassium sparing agent is effective in reducing BP and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Beta blockers are less effective than other antihypertensive agents in the elderly. Therefore they may be appropriate as a first choice in young and middle-age hypertensives, and in those with fast heart rate, but they should not be considered appropriate as the first-line therapy in the elderly with uncomplicated hypertension. Several years ago a plethora of publications showed that short-acting calcium antagonists may increase the risk for myocardial infarction and cancer. A few years ago two studies showed that calcium antagonists are less effective than angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in preventing cardiovascular events in diabetic hypertensive patients. However, recent results from large prospective randomized studies showed that calcium antagonists reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in diabetic and non-diabetic hypertensive patients. Some investigators have suggested that angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may increase the risk of myocardial infarction in hypertensive patients. However, recent meta analyses refuted this conclusions and showed that ARBs are probably as effective as other antihypertensive agents in prevention of myocardial infarction. Despite the concern that has been raised regarding the long-term safety of some antihypertensive agents, it is clear that lowering BP is safe and beneficial.",

Experimental MIR was produced by ligating and reperfusing the left anterior descending coronary artery in the rats. The elevated ST segments of electrocardiogram (ECG), cardiac arrhythmias, and ratio of infarct size/risk zone were compared among the normal control (NC), ischemia and reperfusion (IR), electro-acupuncture (EA), electro-acupuncture plus propranolol (EAP), and EA at nonacupoint (EAN) groups. Before the experiment, EA was applied at bilateral Neiguan acupoints (PC6) in the forelimbs in EA and EAP groups for 30 min once a day for 3 consecutive days. In the EAN group, the same EA treatment was administered at bilateral nonacupoints in the hind limbs. In the EAP group, propranolol, a nonspecific antagonist of beta-adrenoceptors, was administered intraperitoneally 15 min before each EA pretreatment. The results showed that the elevated ST segment of ECG, cardiac arrhythmia score, and ratio of infarct size/risk zone were significantly attenuated in the EA group when compared with those in the IR group (P < 0.05), indicating a cardioprotection of EA pretreatment. When propranolol was given before each EA pretreatment in the EAP group, the cardioprotective effect of EA pretreatment was abolished, showing an involvement of beta-adrenoceptors in mediating the effect of EA pretreatment. There was no significant cardioprotective effect observed in the EAN group. The results suggest that pretreatment may be a better way to apply acupuncture in the prevention and treatment of coronary heart disease.",

The current study further defines this risk, particularly in the common scenario of ingestion of one or two tablets. A prospective cohort of 208 pediatric patients, 6 months to 6 years of age, reported to two regional poison centers serves as the study population. Data were collected with a standardized instrument during the care of each patient and for a minimum of 24 hours after exposure. No instances of serious toxicity typical of beta-blocker intoxication, such as 'shock-like' states, arrhythmias or seizures were observed in this series. Furthermore, there were no reported episodes of hypoglycemia, symptomatic bradycardia or bronchospasm. Nine instances of altered mental status or behavioral changes were reported. All appeared to be minor in nature. The most serious outcome was charcoal aspiration during gastrointestinal decontamination. This study adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that exposure to one or two beta-blocker tablets places children at very little, if any, risk of toxicity.",

A 52-year-old woman developed double vision, myalgias, muscle cramps, and hip and thigh muscle stiffness. Clinical neurologic examination revealed ptosis, dysarthria, sore neck muscles, weakness and wasting of the thighs, and generally brisk tendon reflexes. Lactate stress testing was significantly abnormal. Needle electromyography was nonspecifically abnormal and myopathic. Muscle biopsy showed mild myopathic changes, target fibers, and a single COX-negative fiber. Probable mitochondrial disorder was diagnosed. The patient had been on 30 mg of propranolol during 7 years for arterial hypertension. Shortly after discontinuation of the drug, her double vision gradually disappeared, myalgias and muscle cramps gradually resolved, and the patient reported an increase in muscle mass on repeated follow-ups. Long-term administration of propranolol may aggravate a mitochondrial disorder. Discontinuation of propranolol may result in a gradual resolution of these adverse reactions.",

We determined the prevalence of a raised ARR in an unselected group of patients who were referred to the hypertension clinic at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary. Over a 4-month period, all newly referred patients had an ARR, urea and electrolytes, and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) performed in addition to a detailed clinical examination. One hundred and twenty-two patients (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) were examined over the study period; 57 (47%) were receiving no anti-hypertensive medication, 32(26% of total) had a normal 24-h ABPM of which 15 patients were receiving antihypertensive medication (\"controlled\" hypertensives) and 17(14%) were receiving no anti-hypertensive medication (\"white-coat hypertensives).

Patients with a raised ARR were more likely (odds ratio 3.6, 95% confidence interval 1.2-13.2, p < 0.05) to be classified as a \"non-dipper\" compared with those whose blood pressure fell at night. The proportion of newly referred hypertensive patients with a raised ARR is still significant and confirms that of previous studies The ratio appears to be significantly driven by a suppressed renin value and further investigation is required to clarify the status of those patients receiving anti-hypertensive medications, particularly beta-blockers.", 
    "124": "Although their role in the cardiovascular system is still largely unknown, mast cells are present in the myocardium of both experimental animals and humans. Interestingly, cathecolaminergic nerve fibres and mast cells are often described in close morphological and functional interactions in various organs. In the present study we investigated the effects of chronic interference with beta-adrenergic receptors (via either sympathectomy or beta-blockade) on cardiac mast cell morphology/activation and on interstitial collagen deposition. In rats subjected to chemical sympathectomizy with the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) we observed a significant increase of mast cell density, and in particular of degranulating mast cells, suggesting a close relationship between the cardiac catecholaminergic system and mast cell activation. In parallel, chronic 6-OHDA treatment was associated with increased collagen deposition. The influence of the beta-adrenergic receptor component was investigated in rats subjected to chronic propranolol administration, that caused a further significant increase in mast cell activation associated with a lower extent of collagen deposition when compared to chemical sympathectomy. These data are the first demonstration of a close relationship between rat cardiac mast cell activation and the catecholaminergic system, with a complex interplay with cardiac collagen deposition. Specifically, abrogation of the cardiac sympathetic efferent drive by chemical sympathectomy causes mast cell activation and interstitial fibrosis, possibly due to the local effects of the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine. In contrast, beta-adrenergic blockade is associated with enhanced mast cell degranulation and a lower extent of collagen deposition in the normal myocardium. In conclusion, cardiac mast cell activation is influenced by beta-adrenergic influences.",

The quantitative effects of the polymers used i.e. poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) on mucoadhesion could be predicted using polynomial equations. A formulation of 20% PAA, 20% CMC and 20% PVP was identified for maximising mucoadhesivity and obtaining a controlled drug release profile. Reproducibility of the optimal formulation in terms of mucoadhesivity and controlled drug release was confirmed. The optimal formulation was characterised in terms of mucoadhesivity, release kinetics, swelling/erosion, hydration dynamics and surface pH. From the model fitting analyses, drug release was found to be diffusion, polymeric relaxation and erosion based with the former two being more dominant over erosion. This was in agreement with the erosion and swelling studies which showed swelling and erosion occurring in the tablet matrix. Textural profiling showed initial rapid hydration, which could be beneficial for enhanced mucoadhesivity. Surface pH of the multipolymeric matrices was similar to salivary pH and did not show extremes in changes over the test period. The optimal preparation of multipolymeric propranolol matrices identified in this study shows potential for buccal administration.",

Several different criteria for diagnosis exist, and each differs from the others slightly. We describe a 66-year-old woman with chronic paranoid schizophrenia who was prescribed olanzapine along with several other psychiatric drugs and an antihypertensive drug. The patient displayed several characteristics of NMS during therapy with olanzapine, including fever, elevated creatine kinase level, leukocytosis, and mild muscle rigidity. When olanzapine was held, the signs and symptoms improved and then returned with rechallenge of olanzapine. For this reason, olanzapine was considered strongly associated with this patient's apparent NMS episode. The patient's beta-blocker therapy may have masked additional signs of NMS. In addition, the patient tolerated other neuroleptics that were started in the hospital after the suspected NMS episode. The variation among different diagnostic criteria makes this syndrome a challenging diagnosis at times, in particular when atypical antipsychotics are suspected as the causative agent.",

Cerebral autoregulation is disrupted in acute stroke, and efforts to lower blood pressure may reduce cerebral perfusion and worsen outcomes. Although most patients with stroke have elevated blood pressure, evidence from clinical trials to guide therapy are scarce. Current national guidelines recommend lowering blood pressure after stroke only if end-organ damage is present or if systolic/diastolic blood pressures exceed 220/120 or 185/110 mm Hg in patients ineligible and in those eligible to receive thrombolytic drug therapy, respectively. Recommended pharmacologic interventions for elevated blood pressure after acute ischemic stroke include labetalol, nicardipine, or nitroprusside, depending on the severity of the elevation. Similar recommendations have been made for intracerebral hemorrhage. Subarachnoid hemorrhage is managed with nimodipine and other calcium channel blockers to prevent vasospasm and improve clinical outcomes.

The method is based on the use of the fluorescence technique to measure diastereomeric interactions between both enantiomeric forms of a drug with an optically active room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) followed by partial least squares analysis of the data. The chiral RTIL used in this study, S-[(3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl) trimethylammonium] [bis((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)amide] (S-[CHTA](+) [Tf(2)N](-)), is a novel chiral RTIL that has been synthesized successfully recently in our laboratory in optically pure form using a simple one-step reaction with commercially available reagents. The high solubility power and strong enantiomeric recognition ability make it possible to use this chiral RTIL to solubilize a drug and to induce diastereomeric interactions for the determination of enantiomeric purity, that is, to use it as both solvent and chiral selector.

Several possible mechanisms, such as changing pharmacokinetics of opioid and implication with inhibitory G protein, for short-acting beta1-adrenergic receptor antagonists to produce antinociceptive effects were proposed. However, direct mechanism underling antinociceptive effects of short-acting beta1-adrenergic receptor antagonists has not been fully established. The merits to use short-acting beta1-adrenergic receptor antagonists as anesthetic adjuvants could be to reduce anesthetic and opioid requirements (thus, to avoid its side effects such as nausea and vomiting), to maintain hemodynamic stability, and to achieve early recovery from anesthesia. Administration of a sufficient dose of a short-acting beta1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, for example by neuraxial route, may potentially be a new treatment strategy for the perioperative pain, although further study is necessary to establish its efficacy and toxicity. Short-acting beta1-adrenergic receptor antagonists will be used as agents for antinociception in future.", 
    "153": "Esmolol and landiolol are ultra-short-acting intravenous beta-blockers. Both drugs have high cardioselectivity (beta1/beta2 selectivity of esmolol : 33, landiolol: 255) and short elimination half time (esmolol : 9 min, landiolol : 4 min). Since the duration of beta-adrenergic blockade is short and cardioselectivity is high compared with traditional intravenous beta-blocker propranolol, both drugs are titrated easily. Its use is particularly suited to critically ill patient and for perioperative period. In clinical settings, both drugs have been used for prevention of perioperative tachycardia after endotracheal intubation or surgical incision and treatment of supuraventricular arrhythmias. Esmolol also has been used for treatment of perioperative hypertension and for reducing cardiac work in patients with ischemic heart disease. Recently, it was reported that prophylactic administration of esmolol may prevent perioperative myocardial ischemia in high risk group. Landiolol is a newer drug compared with esmolol. There are not many clinical trials on landiolol. However, since landiolol has higher cardioselectivity and tends to have less cardiodepressant effect than esmolol, clinical indication of landiolol may be extended. Additional data from large studies are required to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of landiolol for a variety of diseases.", 
    "154": "The hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) matrix tablet containing metoprolol succinate (MS) as a model drug was obtained by wet method compression tablet. The effects of the amount and viscosity of HPMC, the preparation method, compressing pressure, the amount of ethycellulose (EC), the pH of dissolution medium and the speed of basket rotation on the drug release from the matrix tablets were evaluated. The results showed that the release rate of metoprolol succinate from HPMC matrix tablets followed Higuchi equation. The release mechanism was in line with the synthetical effect of diffusion and corrosion. Drug release was influenced by the amount and viscosity of HPMC, the amount of EC in matrices, the preparation method and compressing pressure, etc. Drug release was not influenced by the pH of dissolution medium used, and not by the speed of basket rotation, either.", 
    "155": "The incidence of diabetes among patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) is increasing. Despite advances in therapy for CHF, mortality remains about 30% higher for diabetics with CHF than non-diabetics. Multiple mechanisms are responsible for development of CHF in diabetes with ischemic heart disease and its attendant complication of left ventricular dysfunction playing a major role. The prevalence of diabetes is rising worldwide. Thus in the foreseeable future, it appears that physicians will have to deal with increasing numbers of subjects with diabetes, coronary disease and heart failure. Management of diabetes and co-morbid conditions plays a vital role in the prevention of development CHF in subjects with diabetes. Treatment of asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction and management of CHF has been evolving over last few years with major clinical trials advancing our knowledge. This review highlights some of the new developments in this field.", 
    "156": "The biosynthesis of norepinephrine occurs through a multi-enzymatic pathway that includes the enzyme dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH). Mice with a homozygous deletion of DBH (Dbh-/-) have a selective and complete absence of norepinephrine. The purpose of this study was to assess the expression of alpha-1, alpha-2 and beta adrenergic receptors (alpha1-AR, alpha2-AR and beta-AR) in the postnatal absence of norepinephrine by comparing noradrenergic receptors in Dbh-/- mice with those in Dbh heterozygotes (Dbh+/-), which have normal levels of norepinephrine throughout life. The densities of alpha1-AR, alpha2-AR and beta-AR were assayed with [3H]prazosin, [3H]RX21002 and [125I]-iodo-pindolol autoradiography, respectively. The alpha2-AR agonist high affinity state was examined with [125I]-para-iodoclonidine autoradiography and alpha2-AR functionality by alpha2-AR agonist-stimulated [35S]GTPgammaS autoradiography. The density of alpha1-AR in Dbh-/- mice was similar to Dbh+/- mice in most brain regions, with an up-regulation in the hippocampus. Modest decreases in alpha2-AR were found in septum, hippocampus and amygdala, but these were not reflected in alpha2-AR functionality. The density of beta-AR was up-regulated to varying degrees in many brain regions of Dbh-/- mice compared to the heterozygotes. These findings indicate that regulation of noradrenergic receptors by endogenous norepinephrine depends on receptor type and neuroanatomical region.", 
    "157": "Cardiac events in patients undergoing surgery may have serious consequences for both short- and long-term postoperative prognosis. Recently conducted trials have not demonstrated beneficial effects of perioperative beta-blockade, although originally small trials with methodological flaws did suggest this. We evaluate the evidence for using perioperative beta-blockade in both cardiac and non-cardiac surgery, and conclude that there is no statistically significant effect on mortality and insufficient evidence for a reduction of the incidence of mycocardial infarction in meta-analyses of all randomized trials. However, confidence intervals of the intervention effects in the meta-analyses are wide, leaving room for both benefits and harms. The largest observational study performed suggests that perioperative beta-blockade is associated with higher mortality in patients with low cardiac risk or diabetes, and with lower mortality in patients with high cardiac risk undergoing non-cardiac surgery. Larger randomized trials are needed to determine dosage, optimal duration, and safety of therapy, and to identify populations in whom-and how-perioperative beta-blockade may be beneficial.", 
    "158": "Portopulmonary hypertension (POPH) is an uncommon but serious pulmonary vascular consequence of portal hypertension. Untreated, POPH results in right heart failure and death, regardless of the severity of portal hypertension. The existence of moderate to severe POPH has posed higher risk for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). New and evolving medical approaches may change the natural history of this disorder. Such approaches include administration of prostacyclins, endothelin receptor antagonists, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Administration may involve 24-hour continuous infusions, periodic inhaled, and oral routes. Liver transplantation in patients with moderate to severe POPH is problematic. Aside from patients being denied OLT specifically because of POPH, intraoperative death has occurred and unacceptable mortality during the transplant hospitalization has been reported. Finally, guidelines are evolving concerning which patients will benefit from the combination of evolving medical therapies and OLT. Whether the natural history of POPH can be dramatically changed remains an optimistic conjecture.", 
    "159": "Left ventricular hypertrophy refers to a pathologic increase in left ventricular mass and is associated with an increased risk of subsequent cardiovascular morbidity and mortality from any cause. In the development of left ventricular hypertrophy there is growth of cardiomyocytes and accumulation of extracellular matrix and fibrosis. The actions are partly induced by angiotensin II, the principal effector of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, binding to the AT1 receptor. Biochemical markers, some implicated in inflammatory changes, correlate with changes in left ventricular mass. The reduction in left ventricular mass brought about with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy correlates with a reduction in these inflammatory changes, monitored by brain natriuretic peptide. Recent studies incorporating trials of ARBs have found ARBs to be more effective in reducing left ventricular mass than beta blockers and possibly more effective than calcium antagonists. Initial studies suggest that ARBs and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may have similar effects in terms of reducing left ventricular hypertrophy, and the combination of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and ARBs is thought to be synergistic due to a more complete inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. In conclusion, these agents are efficacious in antihypertensive therapy and can play an important role in the prevention or regression of left ventricular hypertrophy due to hypertension.", 
    "160": "Both peripheral innervation and nitric oxide (NO) participate in ovarian steroidogenesis. The purpose of this work was to analyse the ganglionic adrenergic influence on the ovarian release of steroids and NO and the possible steroids/NO relationship. The experiments were carried out in the ex vivo coeliac ganglion-superior ovarian nerve (SON)-ovary system of prepubertal rats. The coeliac ganglion-SON-ovary system was incubated in Krebs Ringer-bicarbonate buffer in presence of adrenergic agents in the ganglionic compartment. The accumulation of progesterone, androstenedione, oestradiol and NO in the ovarian incubation liquid was measured. Norepinephrine in coeliac ganglion inhibited the liberation of progesterone and increased androstenedione, oestradiol and NO in ovary. The addition of alpha and beta adrenergic antagonists also showed different responses in the liberation of the substances mentioned before, which, from a physiological point of view, reveals the presence of adrenergic receptors in coeliac ganglion. In relation to propranolol, it does not revert the effect of noradrenaline on the liberation of progesterone, which leads us to think that it might also have a \"per se\" effect on the ganglion, responsible for the ovarian response observed for progesterone. Finally, we can conclude that the ganglionic adrenergic action via SON participates on the regulation of the prepubertal ovary in one of two ways: either increasing the NO, a gaseous neurotransmitter with cytostatic characteristics, to favour the immature follicles to remain dormant or increasing the liberation of androstenedione and oestradiol, the steroids necessary for the beginning of the near first estral cycle.", 
    "161": "In this experimental study both biological treatability of pharmaceuticals and their potential toxic effect in biological processes were evaluated. The pharmaceuticals were selected among those that are present at higher concentration in the Italian wastewater treatment plant effluents and widely used as antiulcer (ranitidine), beta-blocker (atenolol) and antibiotic (lincomycin). The present paper is the continuation of a work already presented,[1] which used a synthetic wastewater fed to laboratory scale SBR (Sequencing Batch Reactor) operated with different sludge ages (8 and 14 days), different biochemical conditions (aerobic or anoxic-aerobic mode) and several influent drug concentrations (2, 3 and 5 mg/L). In this case a real municipal wastewater was used as influent to the SBR. In parallel, batch tests were conducted to determine the removal kinetics of drugs and nitrogen. Toxicity tests using a titrimetric biosensor to verify possible inhibition on microorganisms were also performed. Finally, the possible adsorption of the pharmaceuticals on activated sludge was evaluated. The drugs under investigation showed different behaviours in terms of both biodegradability and toxicity effect on nitrifiers. Ranitidine showed generally low removal efficiencies (17-26%) and a chronic inhibition on nitrification. Atenolol showed generally higher removal efficiencies than ranitidine, even if the fairly good efficiency obtained in the previous experimentation with synthetic wastewater (up to 90%) was not attained with real wastewater (36%). No inhibition on nitrification was observed on both acclimated and non acclimated microorganisms with a high nitrification activity, whilst it was present with activated sludge characterised by a lower nitrification activity. Consistently with his pharmaceutical properties, lincomycin showed significant inhibition on nitrification activity.",

The administration of atropine was randomized into two groups: A or B (early protocol when atropine was administered at 10 and 20 mcg/kg/min of dobutamine, respectively) and C (standard protocol with atropine at 40 mcg/kg/min of dobutamine). Analysis of the effects of Beta-blockers was done regarding the behavior pattern of heart rate and blood pressure, test time, number of conclusive and inconclusive (negative sub-maximum test) results, total doses of atropine and dobutamine, and general complications.",

The same findings occurred in the standard protocol (Group C), however the early administration of atropine reduced test time both in the presence and absence of this therapy (p = 0.0001). The patients with Beta-blockers in Group A&B had a lower rate of inconclusive tests (26%) compared to those in Group C (40%). Complications were similar in both groups.",

In this issue of Clinical Science, Eldadah and co-workers have investigated the effect of the beta-adrenergic receptor blocker propranolol in preventing syncope in a double-blind cross-over trial in eight subjects with a diagnosis based on tilt table testing and elevated plasma adrenaline levels during syncope. Of these, seven did not respond and the authors therefore suggest that this drug has no role in the management of vasovagal syncope. Their laboratory-based study, however, raises a number of issues regarding terminology, choice of subjects, the value and role of investigations directed towards diagnosis and in understanding pathophysiological mechanisms, and the relevance of such trials to individual subjects with vasovagal syncope.",

Patches were prepared at different ratios of PVP K-30 and evaluated for various physicochemical characteristics such as weight variation, drug content uniformity, folding endurance, surface pH, ex-vivo mucoadhesive strength, ex-vivo residence time, in vitro drug release and in vitro buccal permeation study. Patches exhibited sustained release over a period of 7 hours. The mechanism of drug release was found to be Non-Fickian diffusion. Addition of PVP K-30 generally enhanced the releasing rate. The ex-vivo mucoadhesive strength was performed using sheep buccal mucosa on modified physical balance. Optimized patches (batch F4) showed satisfactory bioadhesive strength (9.6 degrees 2.0 gram) and ex vivo residence time (272 degrees 0.25 minutes). Swelling index was proportional to PVP K-30. The surface pH of all batches was within satisfactory limit (7.0+/-1.5) and hence patches would not cause irritation in the buccal cavity. Good correlation was observed between in vitro drug release and in vitro drug permeation with correlation coefficient of 0.9364. Stability of optimized patches was performed in natural human saliva showed that both drug and dosage forms were stable in human saliva.",
