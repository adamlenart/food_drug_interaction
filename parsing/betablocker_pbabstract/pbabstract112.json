The aims of our study were to prospectively assess the efficacy of propranolol as a first line treatment for problematic haemangioma, and develop a treatment regime. 31 consecutive patients with rapidly proliferating infantile haemangioma with functional impairment or cosmetic disfigurement were treated with propranolol as a first line treatment. All patients had cardiovascular pre-treatment work-up and commenced on propranolol at 3 mg/kg/day. A rapid halt in haemangioma proliferation was seen in 100% of patients and significant regression in 87% of patients. This treatment is well tolerated and has little side effects. Since this study, our unit has adopted the policy of using propranolol as a first line treatment for all problematic proliferative infantile haemangiomas.",

Recent work showed that mice with null mutation for the gene coding TIP39 (TIP39-KO mice) display increased susceptibility to environmental provocation. Based on this stressor-dependent phenotype, the neuroanatomical distribution of TIP39, and knowledge that novelty-induced arousal modulates memory functions via noradrenergic activation, we hypothesized that exposure to a novel environment differently affects memory performance of mice with or without TIP39 signaling, potentially by differences in sensitivity of the noradrenergic system. We tested TIP39-KO mice and mice with null mutation of its receptor, the parathyroid hormone 2 receptor (PTH2-R), in tasks of short-term declarative and social memory (object recognition and social recognition tests, respectively), and of working memory (Y-maze test) under conditions of novelty-induced arousal or acclimation to the test conditions. Mice lacking TIP39 signaling showed memory impairment selectively under conditions of novelty-induced arousal. Acute administration of a PTH2-R antagonist in wild-type mice had a similar effect. The restoration of memory functions in TIP39-KO mice after injection of a \u03b2-adrenoreceptor-blocker, propranolol, suggested involvement of the noradrenergic system. Collectively, these results suggest that the TIP39/PTH2-R system modulates the effects of novelty exposure on memory performance, potentially by acting on noradrenergic signaling.",

The use of therapeutic interventions such as hypertonic saline administration and decompressive craniectomy have solid foundations and can improve outcomes, although questions remain about patient selection, optimal timing, and comparisons to other treatments. Hypothermia, while having promise, has not definitively been shown to benefit patients with traumatic brain injury, although clinical trials are underway. The use of beta-blockers in traumatic brain injury has been proposed as a neuroprotective measure, but data are lacking to support widespread clinical use. Brain tissue oxygenation monitoring is gaining widespread acceptance as a safe tool to provide additional information both to guide therapeutic interventions and to further elucidate mechanisms of secondary brain injury. Evidence is also mounting that guided therapy using brain tissue oxygenation in addition to intracranial pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure monitoring leads to better outcomes after traumatic brain injury.",

The maximum concentrations found were 178ng/L for carbamazepine, 3.65ng/L for diazepam, 70.3ng/L for fenofibric acid, 3.18ng/L for propranolol, 15.7ng/L for trimethoprim and 53.3ng/L for sulfamethoxazole. Carbamazepine was the most ubiquitous compound with 100% positive detection frequency followed by propranolol (38%), trimethoprim (34%) and sulfamethoxazole (33%). The pharmaceutical compounds were quantified at higher levels in the lower stretch of the estuary, especially near the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The data proves that pollution of the Douro River estuary by pharmaceuticals is consistent and is occurring in a fairly constant manner in time, covering a wide area and displaying hot-spots. Individually, the concentration levels are not likely to cause acute effects, based on reference experimental data. However, the fact that complex mixtures exist gives cause for concern as regards potentially relevant toxicological risks.

Here, we demonstrate that propranolol dose-dependently inhibited growth factor-induced proliferation of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) through a G\u2080/G\u2081 phase cell cycle arrest. This was correlated to decreased cyclin D1, cyclin D3, and cyclin-dependent kinase CDK6 protein levels, while increases in the CDK inhibitors p15(INK4B), p21(WAF1/Cip1) and p27(Kip1) were observed. Chemotactic motility and differentiation of HUVECs into capillary-like tubular structures in Matrigel were also inhibited by propranolol. Furthermore, inhibition by propranolol of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGF receptor-2 lead to inhibition of downstream signaling such as the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 and the secretion of the extracellular matrix degrading enzyme MMP-2.

    "66": "Aim of this research was to evaluate novel microspheres based on poloxamer 407, alone or in mixture with Gelucire(\u00ae) 50/13, as possible buccal delivery system for atenolol (AT). The microspheres have been prepared by spray congealing and investigated to assess AT in vitro delivery through cellulose membranes and ex vivo permeation using porcine buccal mucosa. The microparticles were tested as such or directly compacted to obtain tablets. For comparison the physical mixtures, tablets of the physical mixtures and an AT solution were examined. Finally, the microparticles were sublingually administered in rabbits to evaluate AT pharmacokinetics compared to a market oral tablet (reference). The AT release from microspheres through the synthetic membrane was delayed with respect to the drug solution, more markedly when microparticles contained poloxamer as unique adjuvant; this formulation enhanced AT transmucosal permeation. The enhancement effect of poloxamer was confirmed by the permeation experiments on the corresponding physical mixture. Tabletting hindered both release through cellulose membranes and transmucosal permeation of drug. In vivo studies revealed that the absolute bioavailability of microsphere formulations was higher than that of reference in spite of a lower dosage of drug, suggesting a possible dose reduction by AT microparticles orotransmucosal administration.", 
    "67": "Patients with diabetes mellitus can develop cardiac dysfunction in the absence of underlying coronary artery disease or hypertension; a condition defined as diabetic cardiomyopathy. Mice lacking the intracellular protein kinase Akt2 develop a syndrome that is similar to diabetes mellitus type 2. Expression profiling of akt2(-/-) myocardium revealed that Rab4a, a GTPase involved in glucose transporter 4 translocation and \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2AR) recycling to the plasma membrane, was significantly induced. We therefore hypothesized that Akt2 deficiency increases myocardial \u03b2-adrenergic sensitivity. Confirmatory analysis revealed up-regulation of Rab4a mRNA and protein in akt2(-/-) myocardium. In cultured cardiomyocyte experiments, Rab4a was induced by pharmacological inhibition of Akt as well as by specific knockdown of Akt2 with siRNA. Isolated akt2(-/-) hearts were hypersensitive to isoproterenol (ISO) but exhibited normal sensitivity to forskolin. Prolonged ISO treatment led to increased cardiac hypertrophy in akt2(-/-) mice compared to wild type mice. In addition, spontaneous hypertrophy was noted in aged akt2(-/-) hearts that was inhibited by treatment with the \u03b2AR blocker propranolol. In agreement with previous results demonstrating increased fatty acid oxidation rates in akt2(-/-) myocardium, we found increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1 (PPAR\u03b1) activity in the hearts of these animals. Interestingly, increased myocardial Rab4a expression was present in mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of PPAR\u03b1 and was also observed upon stimulation of PPAR\u03b1 activity in cultured cardiomyocytes. Accordingly, propranolol attenuated the development of cardiac hypertrophy in the PPAR\u03b1 transgenic mice as well. Our results indicate that reduced Akt2 leads to up-regulation of Rab4a expression in cardiomyocytes in a cell-autonomous fashion that may involve activation of PPAR\u03b1. This maladaptive response is associated with hypersensitivity of akt2(-/-) myocardium to \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation.", 
    "68": "The objective of the present study was to employ suitable adsorbent with free flowing characteristics for improving the stability and physical properties of solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) for oral administration. Stearic acid based nanoparticles of carvedilol phosphate were fabricated by solvent emulsification evaporation technique in sodium taurocholate solution prepared in pH 7.2 buffers (I-KH2PO4/NaOH or II-NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4) with 1% polyvinyl alcohol. Nanoparticles were then adsorbed by passing the nanodispersion through a Neusilin US2 (adsorbent) column. Interestingly, scanning electron microscopy revealed round deformed and even collapsed nanoparticles in Buffer-I and discrete spherical to ellipsoidal nanoparticles in Buffer-II which indicates the inability of nanoemulsion to crystallize and form SLN in Buffer-I. The successful formation of SLN in Buffer-II was confirmed by differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction. The retention of SLN from the nanodispersion by adsorption on the adsorbent imparted good flow property and resulted in a marked stability improvement of the formulation in terms of drug retention efficiency and release profile as compared to the simple nanosuspension. In conclusion, the adsorbent technology would be instrumental in imparting additional features to the existing conventional colloidal system for pharmaceutical application which would ease the process of capsule filling at industrial scale, simplify the handling of formulations by patients and can significantly improve the shelf life of the product for a longer period of time as compared to liquid formulations.", 
    "69": "Clinically overt hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most common cause of sudden unexpected death in childhood and has significantly higher sudden death mortality in the 8- to 16-year age range than in the 17- to 30-year age range. A combination of electrocardiographic risk factors (a limb-lead ECG voltage sum >10 mV) and/or a septal wall thickness >190% of upper limit of normal for age (z-score > 3.72) defines a paediatric high-risk patient with great sensitivity. Syncope, blunted blood pressure response to exercise, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia and a malignant family history are additional risk factors. Of the medical treatments used, only beta-blocker therapy with lipophilic beta-blockers (i.e. propranolol, metoprolol or bisoprolol) have been shown to significantly reduce risk of sudden death, with doses \u2265 6 mg/kg BW in propranolol equivalents giving around a tenfold reduction in risk. Disopyramide therapy is a very useful adjunct to beta-blockers to improve prognosis in those patients that have dynamic outflow obstruction in spite of large doses of beta-blocker, and its use in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is not associated with significant pro-arrhythmia mortality. Calcium-channel blockers increase the risk of heart failure-associated death in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients with severe generalized hypertrophy and should be avoided in such patients. Amiodarone does not protect against sudden death, and long-term use in children usually has to be terminated because of side effects. Therapy with internal cardioverter defibrillator implantation has high paediatric morbidity, 27% incidence of inappropriate shocks, and does not absolutely protect against mortality but is indicated as secondary prevention or in very high-risk patients.",

    "74": "Utilization of chemical penetration enhancers in conjunction with iontophoresis is regarded as the most effective method to enhance the passage of molecules across the skin barrier. A systematic approach to enhance the transdermal delivery of metoprolol tartrate and the subsequent release of the drug depot in the skin was investigated. Gel formulations with proximate viscosity were prepared and assessed for the effect of polymers (carbopol, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, and methyl cellulose), permeation enhancers (5% w/w, sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), dimethyl formamide, n-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, and polyethylene glycol 400), and the combination approach (permeation enhancers with iontophoresis-0.5\u2009mA/cm\u00b2 on the drug delivery. The flux values observed in passive (4.59-5.89\u2009\u00b5g/cm\u00b2/h) and iontophoresis (37.99-41.57\u2009\u00b5g/cm\u00b2/h) processes revealed that the permeation of metoprolol was not influenced by the polymers studied, under similar conditions, and further studies were carried out using carbopol gel as a representative polymer. Appreciable enhancement (~5-fold) in drug delivery was observed with SLS in the passive process while the optimum iontophoretic delivery condition ensured better delivery (~7-fold). Combination of iontophoresis with SLS further enhanced the drug delivery (~9-fold) and leads to noticeable drug retention in the skin as well. Moreover, the drug retained in the cutaneous layer of the skin eventually released over a period of time (5 days) and followed a near first order profile. This study concludes that the combination of iontophoresis with SLS augmented the metoprolol delivery and rendered skin drug depot, which eventually released over a period of time.", 
    "75": "Current national and international guidelines for patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) are mainly based on the results of randomised clinical trials. However, it is well perceived that patients in such trials often represent a low risk population. Therefore the results of randomised clinical trials are not necessarily applicable to patients in clinical practice. This gap can be filled by prospective registries. Since the early nineties a number of prospective large registries in patients with STEMI have been performed in Germany. It could be shown that guideline adherent acute therapies and secondary prevention therapies were associated with an improvement in inhospital and mid-term outcomes. The benefit of guideline adherent therapy observed was especially high in patients with higher baseline risk. Registries are not able to replace randomised clinical trials, but can help to test if the results of these trials are comprehensible in clinical practice. Therefore prospective STEMI registries are an important part of clinical research to optimize therapies and improve outcome in patients with STEMI.",

Direct infusion Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) metabolomics provides a sensitive and nontargeted analysis of potentially a thousand endogenous metabolites. Our previous work has shown that mass spectra can be recorded from whole-organism homogenate or hemolymph of single adult Daphnia magna. Here we develop multivariate models and discover perturbations to specific metabolic pathways that can discriminate between the acute toxicities of four chemicals to D. magna using FT-ICR MS metabolomics. We focus on model toxicants (cadmium, fenvalerate, dinitrophenol, and propranolol) with different MOAs. First, we confirmed that a toxicant-induced metabolic effect could be determined for each chemical in both the hemolymph and the whole-organism metabolome, with between 9 and 660 mass spectral peaks changing intensities significantly, dependent upon toxicant and sample type. Subsequently, supervised multivariate models were built that discriminated significantly all four acute metabolic toxicities, yielding mean classification error rates (across all classes) of 3.9 and 6.9% for whole-organism homogenates and hemolymph, respectively. Following extensive peak annotation, we discovered toxicant-specific perturbations to putatively identified metabolic pathways, including propranolol-induced disruption of fatty acid metabolism and eicosanoid biosynthesis and fenvalerate-induced disruption of amino sugar metabolism. We conclude that the metabolic profiles of whole-daphnid homogenates are more discriminatory for toxicant action than hemolymph. Furthermore, our findings highlight the capability of metabolomics to discover early-event metabolic responses that can discriminate between the acute toxicities of chemicals.",

His dry weight increased slowly from 57 kg to 58.5 kg for a month increasing the intravascular volume. Neither did the patient develop pulmonary edema nor congestive heart failure preoperatively. Tumor resection was successfully completed under general anesthesia. Although noraderenaline was required to keep adequate blood pressure during surgery and the first day of intensive care unit stay, there was no adverse event during perioperative period. The increasing intravascular volume before pheochromocytoma surgery in a patient on hemodialysis might make the perioperative management safer, although further study is required to determine the adequate level of increment in the preoperative dry weight.",

Recently, stress-induced catecholamines have been shown to increase the expression of various cancer progressive factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), matrix metalloproteinases and interleukins. However, a detailed mechanism remains to be identified. In this study, we investigated the role of adrenergic receptors and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1\u03b1 protein in catecholamine-induced VEGF expression and angiogenesis. Treatment of the cells with norepinephrine (NE) or isoproterenol induced VEGF expression and HIF-1\u03b1 protein amount in a dose-dependent manner. Induction of VEGF expression by NE was abrogated when the cells were transfected with HIF-1\u03b1-specific siRNA. Similarly, adenylate cyclase activator forskolin and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A inhibitor H-89 enhanced and decreased HIF-1\u03b1 protein amount, respectively. More importantly, conditioned medium of NE-stimulated cancer cells induced angiogenesis in a HIF-1\u03b1 protein-dependent manner. In addition, pretreatment of cells with propranolol, a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (AR) blocker, completely abolished induction of VEGF expression and HIF-1\u03b1 protein amount by NE in all of the tested cancer cells. However, treatment with the \u03b11-AR blocker prazosin inhibited NE-induced HIF-1\u03b1 protein amount and angiogenesis in SK-Hep1 and PC-3 but not MDA-MB-231 cells. Collectively, our results suggest that ARs and HIF-1\u03b1 protein have critical roles in NE-induced VEGF expression in cancer cells, leading to stimulation of angiogenesis. These findings will help to understand the mechanism of cancer progression by stress-induced catecholamines and design therapeutic strategies for cancer angiogenesis.", 
    "120": "Previously consolidated memories may become labile when they are reactivated and require reconsolidation. It has been suggested that when novel information is present at the time of memory reactivation reconsolidation is engaged but when no new information is present, reconsolidation may not occur, and extinction may be the dominant process instead. To test this idea we trained rats to associate a context with the rewarding properties of morphine (5 mg/kg, sc) over four conditioning pairings. Following training, animals were reactivated by a 30-min test session, once a day for 3 days. Rats were injected with the amnestic drug propranolol (10 or 40 mg/kg, sc) following reactivation either on the first or on the second day. They received saline on the alternate day. Propranolol disrupted reconsolidation for a conditioned place preference only when given on the first reactivation day, and this effect was more robust following the higher dose of propranolol. In contrast, animals given propranolol on the second reactivation day still displayed a preference for the morphine-paired context on the final test day. These results support the view that for memory to return to a labile state, the situation that evokes reactivation needs to be novel in some way. If the reactivation situation is familiar, reconsolidation may not occur.",

The CZE was used as the first dimensional separation, from which the eluting components were transferred and further analyzed by MEKC. Online dual concentration method, pH junction-sweeping, was used to avoid sample zone diffusion at the interface. The separation efficiencies and detection limits were (2.8-4.3) x 10(4)/m and 0.015-0.052 mg/L, respectively. The proposed method has successfully demonstrated that in the separation of four drugs and their enantiomers in urine samples, the relative standard deviations (RSDs) of peak area and migration time were in the ranges of 1.7%-3.8% and 1.3%-4.6%, respectively. The method was proved to have good reproducibility, high sensitivity and resolution, large peak capacity.

The patient was a 27-year-old woman who underwent elective cesarean section scheduled at 36\u00a0weeks of pregnancy given her history of HOCM. She was managed with spinal anesthesia with monitoring of invasive blood pressure and arterial pressure cardiac output.

Approximately 5\u00a0min after initiation of administration, her heart rate decreased gradually and blood pressure rose. Circulatory dynamics stabilized and landiolol was discontinued 3\u00a0h after she was admitted to the intensive care unit.

    "125": "A best evidence topic in cardiac surgery was written according to a structured protocol. The question addressed was whether radiographic and clinical control after surgery for acute type A aortic dissection (AAD) is needed for improved long-term survival. Altogether, 118 relevant papers were identified using the reported search, of which seven represented the best evidence to answer the question. The author, journal, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes and results of these papers are tabulated. We conclude that most patients after surgery for AAD remain at risk for dissection-related aortic complications. Late aortic growth is often slow and linear, but the occurrence of major aortic events is unpredictable and can initially present more than a decade postoperatively. Risk factors for rapid late aortic enlargement and reoperations include patent or partially thrombosed false lumen, large aortic size, Marfan syndrome and younger age. Whether performing a more extensive first procedure (e.g. aortic arch replacement\u00b1elephant trunk) can be translated into improved outcome and a lower incidence of aorta-related reoperations remains to be elucidated. Aortic reoperation rates range between 10% and >20% within the first 10 years. Optimal systolic blood pressure control (<120 mmHg), including \u03b2-blocker therapy, seems to decrease late aortic dilatation and the incidence of aortic reoperations. Close and careful lifelong surveillance of patients after AAD repair including radiographic and clinical controls to evaluate the status of the remaining aorta, and thus to facilitate adaptations of medical therapy and planning of timely reprocedures seems mandatory for improved long-term survival. A suggested timeframe for computed tomographic (CT) imaging after surgery for AAD is before discharge, at six and 12 months postdissection and, if stable, annually thereafter. Patients with large aneurysms (aortic diameter\u226550 mm) should be maintained at radiographic intervals of six months or less. If the thoracic aneurysm is moderate in size and remains stable over time, magnetic resonance imaging instead of CT-scanning is reasonable to minimize the patient's radiation exposure.",

The presence of \u03b23-AR, by using Western blotting analysis, has been also identified. BRL(37344), a selective \u03b23-AR agonist, induced a dose-dependent negative inotropic effect at concentrations from 10(-12) to 10(-6)M. This effect was not modified by nadolol (\u03b21/\u03b22-AR antagonist) and by phentolamine (\u03b1-AR antagonist), but it was suppressed by the \u03b23-AR-specific antagonist SR(59230) and by exposure to the Gi/o proteins inhibitor Pertussis Toxin. In addition, the involvement of EE-NOS-cGMP-PKG/PDE2 pathway in the negative inotropism of BRL(37344) has been assessed. BRL(37344) treatment induced eNOS and Akt phosphorylation as well as an increase of cGMP levels. \u03b23-ARs activation induce a non-competitive antagonism against ISO stimulation which disappeared in presence of PKG and PDE2 inhibition.

    "144": "In the brain, high cognitive functions are encoded by coherent network oscillations. Key players are inhibitory interneurons that, by releasing GABA into principal cells, pace targeted cells. Among these, oriens-lacunosum moleculare (O-LM) interneurons that provide a theta frequency patterned output to distal dendrites of pyramidal cells are endowed with HCN channels responsible for the slowly activating inwardly rectifying Ih current and their pacemaking activity. Here we show that, in transgenic mice expressing EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) in a subset of stratum oriens somatostatin-containing interneurons that mostly comprise O-LM cells, nicotine, the active component of tobacco, reduced Ih and the oscillatory behavior of O-LM interneurons. In cells hyperpolarized at -90 mV, nicotine suppressed the theta resonance in the same way as ZD 7288 (4-ethylphenylamino-1,2-dimethyl-6-methylaminopyrimidinium chloride), a selective blocker of Ih. Nicotine blocked Ih in a concentration-dependent way with an EC50 of 62 nm. Similar effects were produced by epibatidine, a structural analog of nicotine. The effects of nicotine and epibatidine were independent on nicotinic ACh receptor (nAChR) activation because they persisted in the presence of nAChR antagonists. Furthermore, nicotine slowed down the interspike depolarizing slope and the firing rate, thus severely disrupting the oscillatory behavior of O-LM cells. Molecular modeling suggests that, similarly to ZD 7288, nicotine and epibatidine directly bind to the inner pore of the HCN channels. It is therefore likely that nicotine severely influences rhythmogenesis and high cognitive functions in smokers.",

This direct correlation between human permeability and F(abs) has been recently controversial, since the \u03b2-blocker sotalol showed high F(abs) (90%) and low Caco-2 permeability. The purpose of this study was to investigate the scientific basis for this disparity between permeability and F(abs). The effective permeabilities (P(eff)) of sotalol and metoprolol, a FDA standard for the low/high P(eff) class boundary, were investigated in the rat perfusion model, in three different intestinal segments with pHs corresponding to the physiological pH in each region: (1) proximal jejunum, pH 6.5; (2) mid small intestine, pH 7.0; and (3) distal ileum, pH 7.5. Both metoprolol and sotalol showed pH-dependent permeability, with higher P(eff) at higher pH. At any given pH, sotalol showed lower permeability than metoprolol; however, the permeability of sotalol determined at pH 7.5 exceeded/matched metoprolol's at pH 6.5 and 7.0, respectively. Physicochemical analysis based on ionization, pK(a) and partitioning of these drugs predicted the same trend and clarified the mechanism behind these observed results. Experimental octanol-buffer partitioning experiments confirmed the theoretical curves. An oral dose of metoprolol has been reported to be completely absorbed in the upper small intestine; it follows, hence, that metoprolol's P(eff) value at pH 7.5 is not likely physiologically relevant for an immediate release dosage form, and the permeability at pH 6.5 represents the actual relevant value for the low/high permeability class boundary. Although sotalol's permeability is low at pH 6.5 and 7.0, at pH 7.5 it exceeds/matches the threshold of metoprolol at pH 6.5 and 7.0, most likely responsible for its high F(abs). In conclusion, we have shown that, in fact, there is no discrepancy between P(eff) and F(abs) in sotalol's absorption; the data emphasize that, if a compound has high fraction of dose absorbed, it will have high-permeability, not necessarily in the jejunum, but at some point along the relevant intestinal regions.",

Given the vast physiologic effects of nonselective BB, the aim of this study is to delineate the role of selective BB in HPC growth and mobilization.", 
    "162": "Rats underwent daily intraperitoneal injections of propranolol (Prop), atenolol (B1), butoxamine (B2), or SR59230A (B3) for 3 days to induce BB. All groups then underwent lung contusion (LC). HPC presence was assessed by GEMM, BFU-E, and CFU-E colony growth both in injured lung and bone marrow (BM). Flow cytometry, using c-kit and CD71, was used to determine mobilization into PB.", 
    "163": "LC alone decreased BM HPC growth in all erythroid cell types and increased their number in injured lung (all *p < 0.05). beta-Blockade with Prop, B2, and B3 blockades restored BM HPC growth to control levels and decreased HPCs recovered in the injured lung. Similarly, Prop, B2, and B3 blockade prevented HPC mobilization to PB. B1 blockade with atenolol had no impact on HPC growth and mobilization following LC.", 
    "164": "Nonselective BB reduced suppression of HPC growth in BM after injury and prevented the mobilization and subsequent sequestration of HPCs in injured tissue. Our data have shown that this effect is mediated through the B2 and B3 receptors. Therefore, after trauma, treatment with selective B2 or B3 blocker may attenuate the BM suppression associated with tissue injury.", 
    "165": "Migraine patients who experience an average of 2 or more attacks per month are eligible for preventive treatment as well as treatment for acute attacks. The decision to offer preventative treatment is also made on the basis of the average attack duration, severity of the attacks, and response to attack treatment. Prior to initiating preventive treatment, the average attack frequency per month should be assessed, preferably by means of a headache diary over a number of months, as attack frequency is extremely variable. None of the currently available preventive drugs, such as beta-blockers, sodium valproate, topiramate and candesartan, were developed specifically for treating migraine, but were all originally intended for other indications. 50% of the migraine patients receiving preventive treatment can expect a 50% reduction in attacks, and the remaining attacks often seem to be less severe. The effects of the drugs are often unpredictable per individual, and side-effects frequently lead to early discontinuation of treatment. Drugs usually prescribed for cardiovascular disorders are often used. In the case of a disorder such as migraine with a high burden of disability, patients with cardiovascular or pulmonary comorbidity should receive medication that is optimally adjusted for both indications.",

    "168": "A discrete-trial intracranial self-stimulation procedure was used to assess the negative affective state of nicotine withdrawal. Elevations in brain reward thresholds are indicative of a deficit in brain reward function.", 
    "169": "In all the experiments, the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist mecamylamine (3 mg/kg) elevated the brain reward thresholds of the nicotine-treated rats and did not affect those of the control rats. The \u03b11-adrenergic receptor antagonist prazosin (0.0625 and 0.125 mg/kg) dose-dependently attenuated the elevations in brain reward thresholds associated with precipitated nicotine withdrawal. The \u03b12-adrenergic receptor agonist clonidine (10-40 \u03bcg/kg) and the nonselective \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol (2.5-10 mg/kg) did not attenuate the elevations in brain reward thresholds associated with nicotine withdrawal. Furthermore, mecamylamine (2 mg/kg) induced more somatic signs in the nicotine-treated rats than in the control rats. Clonidine and propranolol, but not prazosin, decreased the total number of somatic signs associated with nicotine withdrawal.", 
    "170": "Blockade of \u03b11-adrenergic receptors attenuates the deficit in brain reward function associated with nicotine withdrawal. Antagonism of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors or stimulation of \u03b12-adrenergic receptors attenuates the somatic symptoms of nicotine withdrawal.", 
    "171": "The extent and the severity of acute myocardial infarction (MI) is decreasing. Out-of-hospital medical management before the hospital admission could alter clinical presentation in acute MI. We used a large national patient register to investigate the relation between previous medication use (aspirin, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, and statins) and the risk of presenting with ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI) or non-STEMI.", 
    "172": "We included 103 459 consecutive patients from the Swedish Register of Information and Knowledge About Swedish Heart Intensive Care Admissions (RIKS-HIA) admitted between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 2006, with a first acute MI.", 
    "173": "The patients with STEMI (43.5% of the total) were younger, had less prior cardiovascular disease, and used fewer medications before hospitalization. Of the STEMI patients, 61.4% had used no medication vs 45.9% of the patients with non-STEMI. After multiple adjustments, use of aspirin, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and statins before hospitalization were all associated with substantially lower odds of presenting with STEMI. Furthermore, the risk decreased with the number of previous medications, and the use of 3 or more medications was associated with a multiply adjusted odds ratio of presenting with STEMI of 0.48 (99% confidence interval, 0.44-0.52) compared with no medications at admission.", 
    "174": "Use of aspirin, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, or statins before hospital admission in patients with a first acute MI is associated with substantially less risk of presenting with STEMI. The risk decreases with the increasing number of these medications used before acute MI, underlining the benefit of preventive medication in high-risk patients.", 
    "175": "Sorption and combined sorption-biodegradation experiments were conducted in laboratory batch studies with 100 g soil/sediments and 500 mL water to investigate the fates in aqueous environments of acetaminophen, caffeine, propranolol, and acebutolol, four frequently used and often-detected pharmaceuticals. All four compounds have demonstrated significant potential for degradation and sorption in natural aqueous systems. For acetaminophen, biodegradation was found to be a primary mechanism for degradation, with a half-life (t(1/2)) for combined sorption-biodegradation of 2.1 days; in contrast, sorption alone was responsible only for a 30% loss of aqueous-phase acetaminophen after 15 days. For caffeine, both biodegradation and sorption were important (t(1/2) for combined sorption-biodegradation was 1.5 days). However, for propranolol and acebutolol, sorption was found to be the most significant removal mechanism and was not affected by biodegradation. Desorption experiments revealed that the sorption process was mostly irreversible. High values were found for K(d) for caffeine, propranolol, and acebutolol, ranging from 250 to 1900 L kg(-1), which explained their greater tendency for sorption onto sediments, compared to the more hydrophilic acetaminophen. Experimentally derived values for logK(oc) differed markedly from values calculated from correlation equations. This discrepancy was attributed to the fact that these equations are well suited for hydrophobic interactions but may fail to predict the sorption of polar and ionic compounds. These results suggest that mechanisms other than hydrophobic interactions played an important role in the sorption process.", 
    "176": "The demand for cross-sectional imaging of the heart is increasing dramatically and in many centres these imaging techniques are being performed by radiologists. Although radiologists are familiar with the computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques to generate high-quality images and with using contrast agents, many are less familiar with administering the drugs necessary to perform CT coronary angiography and cardiac MR reliably. The aim of this article is to give an overview of the indications for and the contraindications to administering cardiac drugs in cross-sectional imaging departments. We also outline the complications that may be encountered and provide advice on how to treat these complications when they occur.", 
    "177": "The sandwiched osmotic tablet system that could deliver Nifedipine and Metoprolol tartarate simultaneously for extended period of time was developed in order to reduce the problems associated with multidrug therapy of hypertension. This system composed of a middle push layer and attached drug layers of Nifedipine and Metoprolol. The advantage of the sandwiched osmotic tablet system over the commercialized push-pull osmotic tablet system is its simplicity of preparation, as the surface identification was avoided. Polyethylene oxide 600,000 and 8,000,000 g/mole were used as thickening agent of drug layer and the expandable hydrogel of push layer, respectively. It has been observed that amount of polyethylene oxide (PEO) and KCL of the drug and push layer had profound influence on Nifedipine and Metoprolol release. Further, the release of drugs was optimized by the size of the delivery orifice, level of plasticizer and membrane thickness. The optimal osmotic pump tablet was found to deliver both drugs at a rate of approximately zero order for up to 16 h independent of pH and agitational intensity, but dependent on the osmotic pressure of the release media. The formulations were found to be stable after 3 months of accelerated stability studies. Prediction of steady-state levels showed the plasma concentrations of Nifedipine and Metoprolol to be within the desired range. Further sandwiched system had a good sustained effect in comparison with the conventional product. Hence the prototype design of the system could be applied to other combinations of drugs used for cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, etc.", 
    "178": "The work purpose was research of degree of free-radical processes intensity and catalase activity in blood serum of patients with a thyreotoxicosis syndrome at traditional treatment and the combined therapy with epifamin. Patients (n=25) have been divided into 2 groups: the first group of patients--12 persons who are on traditional treatment (antithyreoid drugs, beta-adrenoblockers); the second group--13 persons, are padding to basic therapy received epifamin on 1 tablet (10 mg) 3 times a day 10-15 minutes prior to meal within 7 days. Patients with thyreotoxicosis syndrome had an intensification of free-radical oxidation that was traced at measurement of biochemiluminescence parameters in blood serum. At the combined therapy with epifamin less expressed intensity of free-radical processes, and also increasing of the general antioxidant activity of an organism that did not descend at traditional treatment was observed. At carrying out of standard therapy of thyreotoxicosis syndrome, including application of antithyreoid drugs and beta-adrenoblockers, catalase activity decreased, that unfavorable affected antioxidant potential of an organism. At the combined therapy with epifamin level of catalase activity, on the contrary, increased, that could influence positively on antioxidant protection of an organism.", 
    "179": "We report the case of a 46-year-old woman presenting with postoperative bilateral cerebral visual loss that was initially misinterpreted as an irreversible ischemic event. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed high signal intensity on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images and normal signal intensity on diffusion-weighted images of the posterior lobe, which mostly disappeared with the improvement of clinical symptoms. Subsequent diagnosis revealed posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). Recognition of PRES as the correct diagnosis led to the appropriate management strategy and the recovery of normal vision. Differentiation from acute cerebral ischemia is important in order to prevent permanent vision loss due to delay in initiating prompt and vigorous treatment of exacerbating factors, such as intermittent hypertension. We believe that it is important for anesthesiologists and critical care physicians to accurately diagnose PRES in view of the key differences in the management of similarly presenting conditions.", 
    "180": "Randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses provide conflicting guidance on the role of beta-adrenergic receptor blockers (beta-blockers) in reducing perioperative complications. We hypothesize that variability in trial results may be due in part to heterogeneous properties of beta-blockers. First, we propose that the extent of beta-blocker metabolism by cytochrome P-450 and the time available to titrate the dosage before surgery (titration time) may interact; dependence on P-450 may be most harmful when titration time is short. Second, beta-blockers vary in their selectivity for the beta-1 receptor and reduced selectivity may contribute to cerebral ischemia.", 
    "181": "We used meta-analysis and meta-regression of existing trials to explore the role of these pharmacological properties.", 
    "182": "We found that both of these pharmacological factors are significantly associated with reduced efficacy of beta-blockers.", 
    "183": "Pharmacological properties of beta-blockers may contribute to heterogeneous trial results. Many trials have used metoprolol, which is extensively metabolized by cytochrome P450 and is less selective for the beta-1 receptor. For these two reasons, the efficacy of metoprolol to prevent perioperative cardiac complications should be compared with the efficacy of other beta-blockers.", 
    "184": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between QT interval (QT) and serum sotalol concentration following a single low dose of oral and intravenous sotalol.", 
    "185": "Fifteen healthy volunteers received 75 mg intravenous sotalol over 2.5 h and 80 mg oral sotalol in a random order. Serum sotalol concentrations and 12-lead electrocardiograms were obtained simultaneously at baseline and 7 times following dosings. Rate-corrected QT (QTc) was calculated by the Bazett, Fridericia and Framingham formulas. Linear regression analysis was performed between sotalol concentrations and QT measurements.", 
    "186": "Significant QT prolongation was seen at very low sotalol doses and serum concentrations. QTc intervals calculated by the Framingham and Fridericia formulas showed the strongest and virtually identical correlations with serum sotalol concentration (r >or= 0.97, p < 0.001) following oral and intravenous administrations. The equation QTc = 0.0342 (sotalol concentration) + 398 closely predicted actual QTc at any sotalol concentration.", 
    "187": "A strong correlation was observed between serum sotalol concentration and QTc prolongation across the entire concentration range. Low-dose sotalol caused significant QT prolongation. At similar concentrations, intravenous and oral sotalol caused similar QT and QTc effects. Knowing the QT effect can be used to guide further dose increase.", 
    "188": "Levosimendan is a relatively new inotropic agent. Unlike other inotropic agents, Levosimendan does not increase cellular calcium intake, so that, does not cause intracellular calcium overload and related arrhythmias. Atrial fibrillation (AF) was shown to be an independent risk factor for mortality and morbidity in large heart failure (HF) trials. Heart failure induces AF, AF aggravates HF and therefore they generally coexist. We conducted a study to investigate if there is any differential effect of Levosimendan in HF patients with chronic AF and without AF.", 
    "189": "This is a prospective study. Consecutive patients, who were hospitalized because of acutely decompensated HF due to systolic dysfunction and decided Levosimendan administration, were enrolled. Patients were classified into two as those with AF (group A) and those with sinus rhythm (control group, group S). All patients had echocardiography before and after administration. Echocardiographic data were evaluated by ANOVA repeated measurements test.", 
    "190": "Baseline left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) was poorer in group with AF (mean LVEF for group A: 20.9%, for group S: 26.4%, p=0.04). Baseline diastolic parameters were equally impaired. After infusion, diastolic parameters like velocity of propagation (Vp) and isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT) improved almost to same extent in both groups but deceleration time (DT) did not. IVRT values decreased (p=0.012) both in group S (from 108.6+/-23.2 msec to 100.4+/-28.4 msec) and group A (from 117.3+/-25.1 msec to 92.0+/-20.9 msec) without a significant difference between groups (p=0.180 for interaction). Another valuable diastolic parameter, Vp was also similarly improved (p=0.01) in both groups to similar extent (for group A, from 35.4+/-8.8 cm/sec to 41.1+/-7.7 cm/sec, for group S, from 33.7+/-7.5 cm/sec to 37.8+/-7.6 cm/sec; p=0.498 for interaction).", 
    "191": "We have shown that in patients with chronic HF and AF, levosimendan improves left ventricular systolic and diastolic functions as good as those with HF and sinus rhythm. We suggest that a positive electrophysiological effect of levosimendan on failing myocardial tissue seems to fill the absence of atrial booster in patients with AF who are on beta-blocker therapy.", 
    "192": "Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) is a natural product with potent anti-inflammatory, antitumor and antioxidant activities and attenuates inflammation and lipid peroxidation induced by ischemia-reperfusion injury. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of CAPE on isoproterenol (ISO) -induced myocardial infarction.", 
    "193": "A randomized controlled experimental design was used in this study. Rats were divided into four groups and treated with saline, CAPE, ISO and ISO+CAPE. Rats were treated with CAPE (10 micromol kg/day i.p.) or saline starting 3 days before injecting ISO (150 mg /kg s.c., 24 hours). Seven days later, rats were sacrificed and the hearts were excised for biochemical analyses and microscopic examination. One-way ANOVA test with post hoc multiple comparisons using LSD method were used for statistical analysis of the data.", 
    "194": "The administration of ISO alone resulted in higher myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, lipid peroxidation, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) than in the control. The enzyme activities did not change in rat given CAPE alone. CAPE treatment prevented the increase in MPO activity and malondialdehyde, but did not affect the activities SOD and CAT enzymes.", 
    "195": "In light of these results, we conclude that CAPE prevents MPO-and lipid peroxidation-mediated myocardial injury via inhibition of neutrophil's MPO activity.", 
    "196": "A young woman who presented with chest pain was shown with CT and selective coronary angiography to have spontaneous dissections of her left anterior descending and distal right coronary arteries. She was managed with enoxaparin, aspirin, clopidogrel and metoprolol: she was well with a normal stress echocardiogram fourteen months later. Surgical intervention or angioplasty and stent deployment may be avoided in such patients if they are clinically stable.", 
    "197": "Carvedilol is a \u03b2-antagonist with strong anti-oxidant effect in lipids, proteins and superoxide production protecting biological membranes from oxidative stress. We hypothesised a possible therapeutical application of carvedilol in familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP), a neurodegenerative disease caused by deposition of transthyretin (TTR) amyloid fibrils. Oxidative stress, apoptosis and inflammation related to aggregation of non-fibrillar and fibrillar TTR have been detected both in pre-symptomatic and symptomatic stages of the disease, respectively. In this study we show by semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis that administration of carvedilol to a transgenic mouse model of FAP influences the expression of oxidative and apoptotic biomarkers usually associated with TTR deposition, namely oxidation products such as HNE and 8-OHdG, and markers of ER stress. Most important, carvedilol treatment significantly reduced TTR aggregates in as much as 50%. We also observed that carvedilol rescues a mice neuroblastoma cell line from death induced by TTR oligomers, by decreasing activation of BiP and other ER stress biomarkers. Since carvedilol has no effect on TTR aggregation \"in vitro\", this finding points for the \"in vivo\" modulation of TTR aggregation by oxidative stress and apoptosis and prompts for the use of this safe drug in prophylactic and therapeutical measures in the FAP population.",

Nearly three-quarters (158/223 [70.9%]) had taken primidone or propranolol, yet 89/158 (56.3%) had discontinued both. Among 11 patients who had undergone ET surgery, the mean number of ET medications tried was 6.0 \u00b1 2.8 (range = 3-12). Medication usage by general neurologists was less than by movement disorder specialists (p < 0.001).

Among patients seeing movement disorder specialists, the number of medications they had had to try was sizable. These data demonstrate the limitations of current pharmacological options for ET.", 
    "203": "On the basis of the consistent demonstrations that the Abeta peptide of Alzheimer's disease forms calcium permeant channels in artificial membranes, we have proposed that the intracellular calcium increase observed in cells exposed to Abeta is initiated by calcium fluxes through Abeta channels. We have found that a small four-histidine peptide, NAHis04, potently inhibits the Abeta-induced calcium channel currents in artificial lipid membranes. Here we report that NaHis04 also potently blocks the intracellular calcium increase which is observed in cells exposed to Abeta. PC12 cells loaded with Fura-2AM show a rapid increase in fluorescence and a rapid return to baseline after Abeta is added to the medium. This fluorescence change occurs even when the medium contains nitrendipine, a voltage-gated calcium channel blocker, but fails to occur when application of Abeta is preceded by addition of NAHis04. Steep dose-response curves of the percentage of responding cells and cell viability show that NAHis04 inhibits in the micromolar range in an apparently cooperative manner. We have developed numerous models of Abeta pores in which the first part of the Abeta sequence forms a large beta-barrel ending at His 13. We have modeled how up to four NAHis04 peptides may block these types of pores by binding to side chains of Abeta residues Glu 11, His 13, and His 14.",

    "209": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a neuroendocrine complex system that regulates the modulation of salt and water homeostasis, and regulation of blood pressure. Through its multiple interactions it protects the endothelium, heart, brain and kidney. In addition, the RAAS regulates the vascular response to injury and inflammation. Chronic activation/dysregulation of the RAAS leads to hypertension and perpetuates a cascade of proinflammatory, prothrombotic and atherogenic effects associated with endorgan damage (heart, brain, kidney, endothelium). Consequently, the RAAS is an important therapeutic target in these situations. This article presents an overview of physiology, pathophysiology and pharmacologic modulation of the RAAS."
