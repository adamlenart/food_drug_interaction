Two doses of each drug (10 and 20 mg/d for bisoprolol and 50 and 100 mg/d for atenolol) were given, each dose for a 3-month period, the dose to be given first being decided by random allocation of the patients. During the second 3-month period, the patient received the alternative dose. After treatment for 6 and 12 weeks with each dose, the blood pressure, heart rate, and lipoprotein concentrations were checked. Bisoprolol treatment (both 10 and 20 mg) resulted in a decrease in blood pressure in the supine position from 154/100 to 138/89 mm Hg; and atenolol treatment resulted in decreases from 161/102 to 145/90 mm Hg (50 mg/d) and 146/91 mm Hg (100 mg/d). The drugs and doses did not differ in their effect. The triglyceride content in very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) increased during treatment with bisoprolol (10 mg/d) from 1.04 to 1.31 mmol/l (p less than 0.05); during treatment with atenolol (100 mg/d) it increased from 0.90 to 1.14 mmol/l (p less than 0.05). The cholesterol content in low density lipoproteins did not change, but that in high density lipoproteins (HDL) decreased during treatment with both drugs (from 1.22 to 1.10 mmol/l with bisoprolol 20 mg/d, p less than 0.01: and from 1.21 to 1.13 mmol/l with atenolol 100 mg/d, p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "1": "The antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of bisoprolol and atenolol were compared in the Bisoprolol International Multicenter Study (BIMS). In 104 patients with essential hypertension (21 to 70 years of age and diastolic blood pressures (DBP) of 100-120 mm Hg in the sitting position), after a four-week placebo period, the active drug was given in a random double-blind crossover design (10 to 20 mg bisoprolol, 50 to 100 mg atenolol) for eight weeks each, with a 2 to 6 week placebo wash-out phase between active therapy. All blood pressures were recorded 24 h after drug intake. Of the 104 patients, 10 were withdrawn during the study because of unwanted effects, unsatisfactory blood pressure response, or intercurrent disease, leaving 94 for intraindividual comparisons. After 8 weeks active treatment with individually titrated dose, there were slightly, but significantly greater falls in blood pressure with bisoprolol (p less than or equal to 0.05). Diastolic target pressures of less than or equal to 95 mm Hg were reached in 68% with bisoprolol and 56% with atenolol (p less than or equal to 0.05; Mc Nemar). There was no between treatment group difference in the patients' self-assessed well-being. For both drugs, response rates were greater in patients below the age of 60 years than in those above 60 years. Better antihypertensive responses were observed with bisoprolol in patients regularly smoking cigarettes.",

Following a two-week placebo phase, the patients received either 5, 10, or 20 mg bisoprolol in a double-blind randomized fashion, once daily for 12 weeks. On days - 14, 0, 1, 7, 28, 56, 84, and 1 and 2 weeks after discontinuation of treatment (administration of placebo), blood pressure and heart rate were measured in the supine and sitting position, as well as during and after a 15-min exercise period on a bicycle ergometer. Simultaneously with the hemodynamic measurements, blood samples were obtained for the determination of plasma catecholamines. Blood samples for the assessment of beta-receptor density on lymphocytes and alpha 2-receptor density on thrombocytes, as well as thrombocyte aggregation sensitivity, were collected before bicycle ergometry. Five, 10, and 20 mg bisoprolol caused dose-dependent reductions of blood pressure and heart rate at rest and at peak exercise. The responder rates (diastolic BP less than or equal to 90 mm Hg) were 33%, 67%, and 100% with 5, 10, and 20 mg bisoprolol, respectively. After discontinuation of active treatment, blood pressure and heart rate gradually returned to pretreatment values within 1-2 weeks. Plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine levels in patients in the supine position remained unchanged during the whole course of treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "3": "In an initial double-blind randomized study with three parallel groups, 48 patients, mean age 49.6 years (32-65 years), with hypertension WHO I-II, were given bisoprolol in doses of 5, 10, and 20 mg. Bisoprolol is a new beta 1-selective beta-blocking agent with a plasma half-life of 10-12 h and without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA). After the initial 8 weeks, systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR) measured at rest and during exercise 24 h after last drug intake showed a significant decrease for all three parameters in all three treatment groups. There were no differences in efficacy between the 5 and 10 mg doses of bisoprolol, whereas 20 mg was significantly more effective than both 5 mg (p less than 0.01) and 10 mg (p less than 0.05). After 10 months of treatment with dose adjustments up or down, the reduction of SBP, DBP, and HR at rest and during exercise remained unchanged. One patient had an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and died during the study; another patient had a car accident in which he got asphyxial cerebral lesions and could not complete the study. Twelve patients spontaneously expressed side effects of the kind normally seen in treatment with beta-blocking agents. Three of them complained of cold hands and feet, and one of them was unable to complete the study. The rest of the adverse effects were mild, and 45 patients completed the long-term study. Laboratory safety tests were normal, and there were no significant changes in the lipoprotein patterns (cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "4": "Nine hyperthyroid patients (FT4 greater than or equal to 20 ng/L; FT3 greater than or equal to 6 ng/L) were given 1 X 10 mg bisoprolol/day p.o. for a period of 7 days. Pharmacokinetic data were derived from measurements of plasma bisoprolol concentrations after the first dose and at steady state after 7 days treatment. The thyroid hormones FT4, FT3, and rT3 were determined in the serum before and after bisoprolol treatment. In addition, subjective and objective parameters of thyroid function were recorded during the course of the therapy. The maximum bisoprolol concentrations measured after the first dose and after 7 days were 54.3 +/- 2.1 and 70.3 +/- 3.8 ng/ml, respectively, the minimum concentrations being 9.6 +/- 1.0 ng/ml and 11.9 +/- 1.7 ng/ml, respectively. This yields an accumulation factor of 1.2. At steady state, the plasma elimination half-life of bisoprolol was 9.8 +/- 0.9 h. No significant changes in serum thyroid hormones were observed during bisoprolol treatment. There was, however, an improvement in the subjective and objective clinical symptoms of hyperthyroidism. In comparison with the findings in healthy volunteers, the pharmacokinetics of bisoprolol remained unaltered in mild to moderate hyperthyroid patients. After oral application of bisoprolol, only small variations in the plasma concentration were observed inter- and also intraindividually in the course of treatment. This finding reflects the high absolute bioavailability of bisoprolol.", 
    "5": "The effect of a beta-adrenoceptor agonist on the release of the components of the vascular renin-angiotensin system was examined in vitro. Isolated rat mesenteric arteries were perfused in an open system with Krebs-Ringer solution and released immunoreactive angiotensin II (ANG IIir) into the perfusate was directly determined using a Sep-Pak C-18 cartridge connected to the perfusion system. Renin activity in the concentrated perfusate was also determined. Isoproterenol (1 nM-1 microM) increased the release of ANG IIir in a dose-dependent manner. The increase in ANG IIir release during isoproterenol (1 microM) infusion was inhibited by propranolol (1 microM) or captopril (2 microM). Isoproterenol-induced increment of ANG IIir release was blocked by the selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, ICI 118,551 (1 microM), but not by the selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, atenolol (1 microM). Renin activity in the perfusate was measurable, but did not increase in response to isoproterenol (1 microM) infusion. There was no significant difference in the response of ANG IIir release to isoproterenol between spontaneously hypertensive rats and Wistar-Kyoto rats. The present results indicate that locally generated ANG II is released by beta 2-adrenoceptor activation. The beta-adrenoceptor agonist and the vascular renin-angiotensin system may play an important role for the regulation of peripheral vascular tone.", 
    "6": "Spontaneously beating sino-atrial node (S-A node) of guinea-pig was superfused with solutions of various osmolarities. The changes in the rate of spontaneous beating and in action potentials were measured. In the solution of normal tonicity, the rate of spontaneous beating was 214 +/- 6 beats/min (mean +/- S.E.) and the maximum rate of rise was 9.7 +/- 2.5 V/s. When extracellular Na+ was reduced by 33%, isotonically replaced with sucrose, the heart rate was reduced to 177 +/- 8 beats/min and the maximum rate of rise was reduced to 7.6 +/- 1.2 V/s. Decreasing the osmolarity by 30% increased the heart rate by 6% and increasing the osmolarity to 130, 150, and 170% decreased the heart rate to 94, 89, and 73%, respectively, in low Na+ medium. The tonicity dependence of the heart rate was not affected by TTX, atropine, phentolamine, or propranolol. When the tonicity was either increased twice or decreased half, the spontaneous beating stopped. Adding either K+ or Rb+ of 6 mM to the solution which was two times as hypertonic as the normal, could activate the beating again. Substances inhibiting the potassium conductance such as tetraethylammonium (TEA), 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), and cesium chloride (CsCl) could also reactivate the spontaneity. Although lowering extracellular Ca2+ concentration could reactivate the spontaneity in the hypertonic medium, increasing Mg2+ inhibited the reactivation. The contribution of K+ current in the effects of changing osmolarity on the spontaneous beating is discussed.", 
    "7": "The results of serial electrophysiologic testing in patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation indicate that if the arrhythmia is suppressible with antiarrhythmic drugs, the prognosis is better than when arrhythmias continue to be inducible despite antiarrhythmic drug treatment. Whether electrophysiologically guided antiarrhythmic drug therapy improves outcome or merely selects groups of patients with good and bad prognosis, is not known. To answer this question, a prospective randomized trial was conducted with 166 patients (sustained ventricular tachycardia n = 84; primary ventricular fibrillation n = 46; syncope n = 36). When the arrhythmia was inducible by programmed stimulation during control, patients were allocated to receive either electrophysiologically guided antiarrhythmic drug therapy (group I), or metoprolol (daily dose up to 200 mg) without invasive testing (group II). Patients with non-inducible arrhythmias were also treated with metoprolol (group III).", 
    "8": "During a follow-up of 10 +/- 8 (SD) months, there were arrhythmia recurrences in 30 patients, and sudden cardiac death in 17. Follow-up did not differ between group I (n = 59) and group II (n = 53). There was a tendency for the outcome to be better in patients of group III (n = 54) than in those of group II (Log-rank test p = 0.057). In group I, patients whose arrhythmias became suppressed did much better during follow-up than those with still inducible arrhythmias (p less than 0.0001). Thus, while invasive testing is a good predictor of outcome, electrophysiologically guided antiarrhythmic drug therapy is not better than a beta blocker in patients with sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "9": "The efficacy of beta adrenergic blocking agents has been observed in the treatment of a variety of cardiac arrhythmias. Electrophysiological experiments demonstrated that beta receptor blocking drugs prevent catecholamine-induced alterations of the transmembrane action potential. Clinically used beta blocking agents are effective in preventing arrhythmias provoked by sympathetic stimulation such as sinus tachycardia, paroxysmal junctional tachycardia, atrial, nodal, and ventricular premature contractions. Beta receptor blocking drugs are especially useful in tachycardias based on hyperkinetic heart syndrome and in exercise-induced premature beats in patients suffering from coronary heart disease. Beta blocking agents are--at least in our hands--most useful in combination with class I antiarrhythmic drugs with the intention to reduce the dosage--i.e. the side effects--of various antiarrhythmic drugs. In hyperthyroidism beta adrenergic blocking agents are effective complementary to the specific treatment. In cases of intoxication with beta blocking drugs complicated by myocardial depression and severe bradycardia glucagon must be regarded as a very useful compound.", 
    "10": "The metabolic effects of (-)-isoprenaline or/and isobutylmethylxanthine on reticulocyte enriched suspensions of rabbit blood cells and on reticulocyte rich blood of rats were studied. There was no detectable influence of beta-agonist stimulation or/and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase inhibition on total as well as coupled oxygen consumption. However, under the same conditions more than twofold increases of lactate formation were found accompanied by great accumulation of cyclic AMP. These effects are specific and rapid. The peak of lactate production at 5 to 7.5 min was followed by a sharp decline and slow further decrease, whereas cAMP accumulation reached a plateau after 10 to 15 min. A 45% decrease of ATP concentration was found in rat, but not in rabbit reticulocytes. The increased lactate production unaccompanied by changes of oxygen consumption is probably an isolated response of the cytosolic energy producing system. The increased glycolytic rate is probably the consequence of an activation of phosphofructokinase by cAMP. In reticulocyte rich blood of rats, decrease of ATP is a contributing factor of phosphofructokinase activation. The mechanism(s) of dissociation between energy-producing and consuming processes in rat reticulocytes remains unclear.", 
    "11": "Adult cardiac myocytes are incapable of mitosis. Dead cells are replaced by connective tissue so that after myocardial infarction (MI), function can only be restored by compensatory hypertrophy of the surviving myocardium. In physiological hypertrophy in response to exercise, high altitude, or mild hypertension, additional myoplasm expands cell diameter in an orderly fashion; Z-lines are in register and the normal ratio of volume densities of contractile elements, mitochondria, and capillaries is conserved. In hypertrophy induced by aortic or pulmonary artery banding or by experimental or congenital hypertension, the borderline between physiological and pathological hypertrophy may be crossed, causing disorganization of fibers and an unfavourable contractile element to capillary ratio. There was, therefore, a need for a graded model of hypertrophy, which involves simulating an altitude of 6,000 m at sea level by supplying rabbits with appropriate nitrogen/oxygen mixtures. In this environment, 50% right ventricular hypertrophy can be achieved without alteration of left ventricular weight or hematocrit. Longer exposures produced 100% right ventricular hypertrophy, with only moderate increases in hematocrit and left ventricular weight. It is well known that adrenergic stimulation causes cardiac hypertrophy, and it has been suggested that release of a trophic factor from sympathetic nerves, either noradrenaline or a protein, might be a necessary stimulus for growth. If so, long-term treatment of post-MI patients with beta-adrenergic blocking agents could inhibit a desirable compensatory hypertrophy of the surviving myocardium. In the above model it has been found, however, that neither beta-blockade nor chemical sympathectomy with guanethidine or 6-hydroxydopamine had any effect on the hypertrophy, nor did treatment with verapamil or nifedipine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "12": "The influence of single oral doses of 200 mg celiprolol, 100 mg atenolol, and 200 mg metoprolol on airway resistance (Raw) FEV1, VC, and MEF 50 was studied in a randomized double-blind crossover trial. Eighteen patients with hypertension and asthma, 14 men and 4 women, aged 43-75 years, took part. Pulmonary function tests were performed in the morning before treatment and 2 and 5 h after each treatment in the whole-body plethysmograph. The use of bronchodilators was not allowed during the 3 days. There was no significant change in airway resistance, FEV1, and MEF 50 after celiprolol and a slight increase of vital capacity at 2 h. After atenolol there was a decrease of FEV1 and MEF 50 at 5 h. Metoprolol caused an increase in resistance at 2 and 5 h and a fall in FEV1, VC, and MEF 50 at 2 and 5 h. Two patients required bronchodilator therapy after metoprolol and were excluded from evaluation. We conclude that celiprolol appears to be a safe drug in the treatment of asthmatic patients.", 
    "13": "Celiprolol HCl is a new cardioselective beta adrenoceptor antagonist with both mild propranolol-sensitive partial agonist activity and propranolol-insensitive cardiostimulatory properties. The purpose of the present investigation was to assess the significance of this unique pharmacological profile in a study of the effects of celiprolol in anesthetized dogs with depressed myocardial function. Dogs were acutely instrumented to directly monitor myocardial contractile force (CF), arterial pressure (AP), heart rate (HR), and ECG limb lead II. Mecamylamine 1 mg/kg i.v., and verapamil, 0.5 mg/kg i.v., reduced CF (80 +/- 6 g), HR (76 +/- 4 beats/min), and AP (59 +/- 8 mm Hg). Celiprolol (3 mg/kg i.v.) did not produce any further decrement in myocardial function. There were no appreciable ECG changes. These data suggest that celiprolol may be the drug of choice in patients receiving verapamil, since it should not further compromise myocardial function.", 
    "14": "To study the role of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) in beta-blocker-induced changes of beta-adrenoceptors, the effects of administration of several beta-blockers for 9 days on lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptor density--assessed by 125iodocyanopindolol binding--were investigated in 47 normotensive volunteers. Propranolol (unselective; no ISA; 4 X 40 mg/day) increased beta 2-adrenoceptor density by 25-40%; after withdrawal beta 2-adrenoceptor density declined slowly, being still elevated for 3 days. In contrast, the unselective beta-blockers pindolol (ISA (isoprenaline = 1.0) = 0.39; 2 X 5 mg/day) and mepindolol (ISA = 0.27; 2 X 5 mg/day) decreased beta 2-adrenoceptor density by 50% and 35%, respectively, while alprenolol with weak ISA (=0.066; 4 X 100 mg/day) had no effect. Among the beta 1-selective blockers studied, celiprolol with ISA (=0.32; 1 X 200 mg/day) decreased beta 2-adrenoceptor density by 30% whereas bisoprolol without ISA (1 X 10 mg/day) had no effect. It is concluded that the ISA determines the direction and amount of beta-adrenoceptor alterations induced by beta-blockers. Furthermore, changes in human lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptors reflect subtype-selective changes in beta 2-adrenoceptors, since the beta 1-selective blocker bisoprolol without ISA--in contrast to propranolol--did not affect lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptors. Accordingly, the fact that the beta 1-selective blocker celiprolol with ISA decreased lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptors, is consistent with the hypothesis that celiprolol possesses in addition to its beta 1-antagonistic activity a beta 2-agonistic activity.", 
    "15": "Celiprolol is a new cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocking agent. A pharmacokinetic study in young healthy volunteers showed a nonlinear increase in AUC with increasing dose. As celiprolol will be used in elderly patients, it is necessary to establish the pharmacokinetic profile in this population. This study was established to address this question. The study was of three 7-day periods of medication with 14 days' washout between them. The first two periods were a randomized two-way crossover of celiprolol 200 mg and 400 mg, and in the third period all subjects received celiprolol 600 mg. Blood was taken for celiprolol plasma assays, to establish a 24-h profile on days 1 and 7, with trough levels in between. Subjects had a mean (+SD) age of 65.5 +/- 3.6 years (range 60-71). Model independent kinetics were used, as the data did not fit a conventional model. The AUC values (ng X h/ml) were 3,688, 9,092, and 15,020 for the celiprolol doses 200 mg, 400 mg, and 600 mg respectively on day 1, and 3,317, 9,729, and 16,550 respectively on day 7. This shows a nonlinear increase with increasing dose. A steady state was rapidly achieved, as shown by the trough levels. The Cmax for each celiprolol dose was unchanged from day 1 to day 7. The tmax was equivalent for all doses and unchanged from day 1 to day 7. The t1/2 increased slightly from 5 h on day 1 to 7 h on day 7.", 
    "16": "This study was initiated to assess the efficacy and safety of celiprolol in a large number of hypertensive patients. Patients received a once-daily dose of 200 mg celiprolol for the first 3 weeks. If blood pressure was not lowered satisfactorily, the investigator was asked to raise the dose to 300 mg celiprolol or add a diuretic for the next 3 weeks. The study included 2,694 patients, 2,311 of whom were evaluable over a period of 3 weeks, 1,876 over 6 weeks. On admission 10% had isolated systolic hypertension, 38% mild diastolic hypertension, 35% moderate diastolic hypertension, and 17% severe diastolic hypertension. Concomitant diseases were diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive airway disease, and peripheral arterial disease. BP was lowered in patients with hypertension of all degrees of severity. There was no obvious relation between efficacy and age or with duration of disease. Only 229 patients received 300 mg celiprolol; 223 patients additionally received a diuretic. Heart rate decreased by a mean of 8 beats/min and was lowered mostly in patients with tachycardia. In no case did heart rate fall below 50. Side effects were rare and in most cases not serious. Treatment was discontinued owing to suspected adverse effects in 58 patients (2.15%). In conclusion, celiprolol administered for up to 6 weeks appeared to be safe in the management of hypertension.", 
    "17": "The acute hemodynamic effects of intravenously administered celiprolol and propranolol were compared in 18 patients, 12 with coronary obstruction in the presence or absence of reduced LV function and six with no significant cardiac disease. The study was performed using a single blind, randomized design with celiprolol (0.07 and 0.14 mg/kg) and propranolol (0.07 mg/kg) in six patients per treatment group. The hemodynamic parameters obtained via right and left heart catheterization were measured at baseline and at 5 and 10 min after drug infusion (1.0 mg/min). Propranolol produced a significant fall in left ventricular Vmax, left ventricular dP/dt and cardiac output. In contrast, celiprolol either caused no change or significantly increased these parameters. These results indicate that celiprolol has an acute hemodynamic profile which differs significantly from that of propranolol.", 
    "18": "Beta-adrenoceptor antagonists do not directly depress myocardial contractile function. The primary pharmacological target of these drugs is to attenuate the increase in myocardial oxygen consumption resulting from sympathoadrenal stimulation of the heart. Pure beta blockade achieves this by modulating the increases in heart rate and myocardial contractility. This brings in its train the unwanted secondary and tertiary consequences of ventricular dilatation, impaired cardiac output response to exercise, and reflex increases in systemic vascular resistance and left ventricular afterload. Together these physiological effects offset much of the primary therapeutic benefit of these drugs. The ancillary pharmacological properties possessed by newer generations of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists have reduced some of the undesirable hemodynamic consequences of pure beta blockade. In this respect, positive inotropic activity and vasodilator effects, however achieved, are desirable properties in a drug with beta-blocking activity. Such additional pharmacodynamic activities afford direct support of cardiac contractile activity and reduce the undesirable increase in peripheral vasoconstriction that results from beta blockade alone. Celiprolol is a new dimension in beta-blocking therapy in that it achieves these additional hemodynamic benefits by widespread modulation of sympathoadrenal activity.", 
    "19": "We have previously shown that baroreceptor control of the cardiovascular system and the cardiopulmonary receptor control of peripheral circulation are preserved or only moderately reduced during antihypertensive treatment with acebutolol or nadolol, which indicates that treatment with beta blockers with or without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity does not impair fundamental neural mechanisms involved in circulatory homeostasis. In the present study we have investigated the reflex control of circulation before and during antihypertensive treatment with celiprolol, which, in addition to its beta-blocking action, has vasodilator properties that may stem from interference with neural cardiovascular control. In six essential hypertensive subjects we measured blood pressure (intraarterial catheter), heart rate (ECG recording), central venous pressure (right atrial catheter), and forearm blood flow and resistance (plethysmography) before and during alterations in the activity of the arterial baroreceptors obtained by means of lower body suction and passive leg raising. The study was performed before and after 5-7 days of oral administration of celiprolol at 200-400 mg once a day. Compared to the values obtained in the control, condition celiprolol caused a reduction in blood pressure, a slight change in heart rate, and an increase in forearm blood flow, which indicated the occurrence of a clear-cut forearm vasodilatation. The heart rate responses to arterial baroreceptor manipulation were unchanged by celiprolol which reset the carotid baroreflex so that its tonic restraint on blood pressure increased despite the hypotension induced by the drug. The inhibitory restraint tonically exerted by the cardiopulmonary receptors on peripheral circulation was also increased by celiprolol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "20": "Brachial artery diameter (pulsed Doppler method), forearm vascular resistance, and venous tone (plethysmographic method) were studied in 18 patients with sustained essential hypertension. Hemodynamic parameters were reevaluated after 3 months of treatment by propranolol (9 patients) or pindolol (9 patients). For the same decrease in pressure, propranolol decreased heart rate significantly while pindolol did not, indicating the role of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. After pindolol, forearm vascular resistance and venous tone significantly decreased while brachial artery cross-sectional area significantly increased. After propranolol, forearm vascular resistance and brachial artery cross-sectional area did not change significantly, while forearm venous tone increased markedly. The study shows that, in the long term, pindolol dilates small and large arteries and veins of the forearm circulation whereas Propranolol apparently does not.", 
    "21": "A review of the relevant literature indicates that the effects of beta blockers on cardiac output and plasma renin or penetration of these drugs into the brain and cerebrospinal fluid are not essential for their antihypertensive effect. Reduction in blood pressure during long-term beta-blocker therapy is always associated with reduction of total peripheral resistance. Evidence is presented suggesting that blockade of presynaptic beta receptors underlies this vasodilator effect of beta blockers.", 
    "22": "The phosphorylation hypothesis of smooth muscle contraction relates formation of cyclic AMP, resulting from beta-adrenergic stimulation, to inhibition of myosin light-chain phosphorylation and hence to bronchial relaxation. The hypothesis can therefore explain why beta-adrenergic blockade promotes bronchospasm in susceptible individuals. In the light of this molecular schema, various novel approaches to the use of beta-adrenergic blocking therapy for hypertension in the presence of asthma are discussed.", 
    "23": "The bronchopulmonary effects of celiprolol were studied in 12 male asthmatic patients who showed mean maximum changes of -24% in forced one-second expiratory volume (FEV1) and 130% in airways resistance (Raw) following a single, 80 mg dose of propranolol. Celiprolol 200 and 400 mg and placebo were administered in double-blind, random fashion. Raw and FEV1 were determined by whole body plethysmography 1, 2, and 3 h post dose. For placebo and celiprolol 200 and 400 mg, mean maximum changes in FEV1 were 0.6, 2.8, and 2.4%, and for Raw, 11.3, -0.2, and -10.9%, respectively. Pulmonary effects of the three treatments were indistinguishable but differed significantly from propranolol. Five 0.5 mg doses of terbutaline aerosol, administered at 15-min intervals starting 3 h post drug or placebo, caused less bronchodilation after propranolol than after placebo, or celiprolol 200 or 400 mg; the responses after the latter three were indistinguishable. These results suggest that celiprolol is highly bronchosparing and does not block bronchodilation following the beta 2-agonist terbutaline in propranolol-sensitive asthmatics. In contrast to classical beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, celiprolol may afford a greater margin of safety in asthmatic patients with angina or hypertension.", 
    "24": "Celiprolol HC1 is a new cardioselective beta-blocker with properties which may make it the next advance in the evolution of this class of compounds. Its cardioselectivity has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo, with an intravenous potency equivalent to atenolol. The compound is devoid of a membrane stabilizing effect which is reflected in anesthetized dogs by a lack of myocardial electrophysiological effects. The compound induces a vasodilator effect in anesthetized dogs which is partially attenuated by propranolol, suggesting a weak beta 2-agonist activity. This beta 2-agonist property is also manifested in other peripheral tissues and undergoes down-regulation with repeat exposure. In contrast to other beta-blockers, celiprolol produces a bronchodilation in anesthetized cats which is propranolol-resistant. Isolated tissue studies suggest that a weak alpha 2-blocking effect contributes to this bronchodilation, although another unknown mechanism participates as well. Celiprolol induces a cardiac stimulation in anesthetized dogs which is inhibited by propranolol. The mechanism for this effect appears to be due to adrenergic interaction. These unique properties of celiprolol convey salutary effects in the clinical use of celiprolol.", 
    "25": "A survey is given of the mutual interaction of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor mediated cardiovascular effects, with an emphasis on the effects of drugs which simultaneously block alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors. This discussion is preceded by a review of the various subtypes of adrenoceptors, including pre/postsynaptic, alpha 1/alpha 2- and beta 1/beta 2-receptors with an emphasis on their various selective agonists and antagonists and their functional aspects. For drugs which display comparable degrees of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockade the following effects may be anticipated: vasodilatation, a reduction in total peripheral resistance (TPR) and a decrease in blood pressure, as a result of postsynaptic (alpha 1 + alpha 2) adrenoceptor blockade; a fall in blood pressure as a result of beta-receptor blockade; no reflex tachycardia in spite of the vasodilatation (alpha 1 + alpha 2 blockade) owing to beta-receptor blockade. For a drug which simultaneously blocks alpha 2- and beta 1-adrenoceptors the following effects may be anticipated: all cardiac changes usually induced by beta 1-blockade (reduced heart rate, contractility and A-V conduction); vasodilatation induced by postsynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptor blockade; enhanced release of presynaptic noradrenaline, owing to presynaptic alpha 2-receptor blockade. Celiprolol is an example of a drug which combines alpha 2- and beta 1-adrenoceptor blocking properties. It should be realized, however, that the alpha 2-receptor affinity of the drug is much lower than its beta 1-receptor antagonism, which probably dominates the drug's profile.", 
    "26": "The development of radioligand-binding studies has greatly advanced our knowledge of the molecular pharmacology of beta-adrenoceptors. With this technique it is possible for the first time to directly determine the tissue concentration of beta-adrenoceptors, and by this, the responsiveness of tissues to beta-adrenergic stimulation. One major insight into the molecular pharmacology of beta-adrenoceptors to come from radioligand-binding studies was that the tissue concentration of beta-adrenoceptors is not a fixed number, but is rather dynamically regulated by a variety of drugs, hormones, physiological and pharmacological conditions. Since changes in beta-adrenoceptors assessed in circulating lymphocytes of man mirror changes in density and functional responsiveness of the corresponding myocardial beta-adrenoceptors, alterations in beta-adrenoceptor function can be also studied in human beings. In addition, by means of radioligand-binding studies the coexistence of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors has been demonstrated in numerous tissues of various species, including human heart and lung. The detailed knowledge of distribution and regulation of beta-adrenoceptors should help to improve the individual effectiveness of drug treatment.", 
    "27": "The effects of once-daily dosing with celiprolol 200 mg, celiprolol 400 mg, and atenolol 100 mg have been studied in 19 male patients with chronic stable angina pectoris. All three treatments improved angina attack rates and treadmill exercise performance equally. Celiprolol appears to be as efficacious as atenolol as an antianginal agent during long-term therapy.", 
    "28": "The therapeutic relevance of differences between beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, related to their ancillary pharmacological properties, is debated. Celiprolol is a novel cardioselective beta-blocking agent with attributed cardio-stimulating properties. Its hemodynamic profile was compared with that of atenolol (cardioselective; no ISA) in a comparative dose-response study of 24 patients with angiographically documented coronary artery disease. Following a stable control period four i.v. boluses of equivalent beta-blocking doses of atenolol (1, 1, 2, and 4 mg) or celiprolol (1, 1, 2, and 4 mg) were administered, and hemodynamics and left ventricular ejection fraction were determined. The comparative actions of the two drugs on the hemodynamics of exercise-induced angina were compared by exercise testing in the control state and following the maximum cumulative dose of each drug. At rest, atenolol reduced heart rate, cardiac index, and left ventricular ejection fraction (EF); systemic vascular resistance index increased without change in systemic arterial or pulmonary artery occluded pressures. Celiprolol increased cardiac index and ejection fraction without change in other variables. During exercise both drugs reduced cardiac index and heart rate; neither altered the exercise EF. The cardiac function curve, relating cardiac index to left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, was significantly depressed by atenolol but was elevated at rest by celiprolol. Thus these studies demonstrated hemodynamic differences between atenolol and celiprolol, presumably related to the ancillary properties of the latter. The relevance of such differences to the therapy of patients with coronary artery disease deserves further examination.",

The study consisted of a 4-week placebo run-in period, 6-week titration, 4-week maintenance, 2-week tapering and a 2-week placebo run-out period. Entry criteria were a history of stable angina with chest pain and 1 mm ST segment depression between 3 and 12 min after start of treadmill exercise stress test. Patients started with celiprolol 200 mg daily for 2 weeks; non-responders received 400 mg daily for 2 weeks and then if necessary 600 mg daily for another 2 weeks. A 20% increase over baseline in exercise stress test to onset of angina was considered a response. Ninety-two patients were evaluated, 54 in the celiprolol group and 38 in the placebo group; 63 men and 29 women, mean age 57 years. The celiprolol group was significantly different from placebo after 6 weeks. In particular, exercise time increased by 4.3 min (placebo increased by 0.3 min), ST segment depression reduced by 0.4 mm, notwithstanding the increase in exercise time (placebo increased by 0.2 mm), maximum exercise heart rate reduced by 6 beats per min (placebo increased by 3 beats per min), maximum exercise systolic BP reduced by 14 mm Hg (placebo decreased by 1 mm Hg). The therapeutic success rate based on a 20% increase of exercise time was 85% after celiprolol and zero after placebo. Reduction in weekly angina attacks and nitroglycerin consumption was from 8 to 3 after celiprolol and from 9 to 6 after placebo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The study began with a 4-week single-blind, placebo run-in, followed by 4 weeks of double-blind active treatment with celiprolol 200, 400, or 600 mg once daily or placebo, and 1 week of a placebo run-out. Patients studied had a history of chronic, stable angina pectoris and myocardial ischemia (greater than or equal to 1.0 mm ST segment depression) within 3-12 min of treadmill exercise (modified Bruce) after 3 and 4 weeks of placebo. After 2 weeks treatment, treadmill testing results indicated a mean time to myocardial ischemia for patients receiving placebo increased by 0.5 min (8%), whereas the increases for celiprolol 200, 400, and 600 mg were 0.8 min (11%), 2.1 min (33%), and 1.1 min (16%) respectively. Mean time to anginal symptoms for placebo patients was increased by 0.6 min (10%), and for celiprolol patients by 1.8 min (27%), 1.5 min (19%), and 1.0 min (14%) respectively at the 3 dose levels.

Before treatment there was no significant difference in patient characteristics or in the average systolic or diastolic blood pressures or heart rates between the two groups. Sixty-five percent of the celiprolol group and 56% of the patients randomized to propranolol achieved blood pressure control on the lowest dose of each drug. The mean reductions in the systolic and diastolic pressures at the end of the 4 week titration period were -14/-13 mm Hg for the celiprolol group and -11/-12 mm Hg for the propranolol group. Continued treatment with the same doses of celiprolol and propranolol for a further 8 weeks resulted in blood pressure reductions of -18/14 mm Hg and -8/-9 mm Hg, respectively. In 64% of patients taking celiprolol and in 54% of those taking propranolol the prospective target reduction in supine diastolic blood pressure was achieved, namely a reduction to below 90 mm Hg or a reduction lower after propranolol than after celiprolol; celiprolol reduced the heart rate by an average of 6 bt/min and propranolol by 13 bt/min after 12 weeks treatment (p 0.01).

Patients with diastolic blood pressure between 95 and 114 mm Hg were randomized to celiprolol or atenolol once daily. The dose of each agent was titrated from 50 to 100 mg atenolol or from 200 to 400 mg celiprolol if the supine diastolic blood pressure remained greater than 90 mm Hg after 2 to 4 weeks treatment at 24 h following dosing. Following titration patients were maintained at constant dosage for 12 weeks. The average reductions in blood pressure over the period of double-blind therapy were similar; for atenolol -17/-16 mm Hg and for celiprolol -14/-13 mm Hg. Therapeutic success rate (percentage of patients with diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg or reduction in diastolic blood pressure greater than 10 mm Hg), based on the mean over the maintenance period, was 71% and 59%, respectively. Adverse events were minor and similar for both therapies. Once daily atenolol and celiprolol appeared similar in efficacy and safety in mild to moderate hypertension.", 
    "33": "This study evaluated the 24-h antihypertensive effect of single daily doses of celiprolol, a beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonist. Patients with supine diastolic BP between 95 and 114 mm Hg started on placebo or celiprolol 200 mg daily for 2 weeks; non-responders received 400 mg daily for 2 weeks and then 600 mg daily for another 2 weeks. Response was defined as a reduction of diastolic BP to 90 mm Hg or below. One hundred ninety patients were evaluated for efficacy, 114 in the celiprolol group and 76 in the placebo group, 84 men and 106 women, mean age 52 years. Blood pressure after 6 weeks fell from 165/103 to 149/92 on celiprolol and from 162/103 to 157/97 on placebo. The fall in systolic and diastolic BP after celiprolol is statistically different (p less than 0.001) from that after placebo. The pulse rate was reduced to a similar extent by the two treatments. The percent of patients with supine diastolic BP either reduced by at least 10 mm Hg or to 90 mm Hg or below, was 66% after celiprolol and 38% after placebo (p less than 0.001). The incidence of adverse reactions was comparable in the two groups: 31% during celiprolol, 25% during placebo. The most frequent reactions observed in both groups were gastrointestinal symptoms, dizziness, fatigue, headache. In conclusion, celiprolol proved to be a safe and effective beta-blocker in the treatment of mild and moderate hypertension.", 
    "34": "The objective of the study was to evaluate the acute effect of intravenous celiprolol on the electrophysiologic properties of the cardiac conduction system in man and to assess potential problems in terms of its causing heart block or sinus bradycardia. Eight patients with controlled coronary artery disease and hypertension but without conduction system disease were studied. All cardiac drugs e.g., digoxin, sympathomimetics and other beta blockers were discontinued prior to entering the study. Surface ECG leads I, AVF, and Vi were applied to each patient, and the ECG was continuously displayed on an oscilloscope. A quadripolar stimulating electrode (7F) was inserted percutaneously and positioned in the high right atrium and a tripolar or bipolar His bundle recording catheter was positioned cross the tricuspid valve. The atrial and His bundle electrograms were recorded on a direct writing recorder. After completion of the baseline electrophysiologic (EP) measurements, in an open fashion, celiprolol (0.1 mg/kg) was administered intravenously at the rate of 1 mg/min into each of the five patients. The complete battery of the EP measurements were repeated immediately following completion of the infusion. Preliminary data in eight patients demonstrated no significant effect of celiprolol on the cardiac conduction system.", 
    "35": "The heart rate increase induced by dynamic exercise in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation is competitively attenuated by beta-blockade. The influence of oral celiprolol on exercise induced tachycardia was evaluated in 23 patients with chronic stable atrial fibrillation in a dose-titration study. This was succeeded by a placebo-controlled double-blind, crossover multi-center trial. During the dose-titration phase each patient underwent a single-blind three week dose escalation period-taking celiprolol 200 mg once daily for one week, celiprolol 400 mg once daily for the third week. After a one week placebo washout, patients then entered a double-blind crossover phase, consisting of one week each of placebo or celiprolol according to a pre-determined randomization. After one week of placebo washout, each patient was crossed-over. In 21 patients celiprolol reduces exercise-induced increased heart rate by approximately 35% when compared with placebo. These results indicate that celiprolol should be effective in controlling the exercise-induced increase in heart rate in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation. In addition, results of 24 h ambulatory ECG monitoring (Holtor monitoring) indicate that celiprolol reduces the ventricular premature contractions.", 
    "36": "Sixteen normotensive asthmatic patients received single doses of 400 and 600 mg of celiprolol and 100 mg of atenolol in this placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study. Pulmonary function was assessed by spirometry. Changes in forced one-second expiratory volume (FEV1) and mid-maximal expiratory flow (MMEF) following both doses of celiprolol were indistinguishable from the effects of placebo, whereas atenolol caused a significant reduction in both measurements of pulmonary function. Graded doses of albuterol, a beta 2-selective sympathomimetic administered at 15-min intervals starting 3 h after each treatment, as expected, caused bronchodilation. The overall bronchodilatory effects of this combined, beta-blocker plus albuterol treatment on pulmonary function were greatest after celiprolol 600 mg, followed in order by celiprolol 400 mg, placebo, and atenolol. Celiprolol 400 mg and 600 mg neither caused bronchoconstriction nor antagonized albuterol in this acute study. Because of its bronchosparing properties, even at high doses, celiprolol may offer an advantage over other, similar agents in the treatment of hypertension and angina in asthmatics.", 
    "37": "Celiprolol, a new beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, blocks serotonin- and methacholine-mediated bronchoconstriction in animals, even in the presence of propranolol. In two, randomized, placebo-controlled, 5-way crossover trials, the pulmonary effects of celiprolol 200 and 400 mg, propranolol 40 mg and atenolol 100 mg were compared in 34 asthmatic patients. Pulmonary function was measured after single doses of each agent, and again following subsequent, graded doses of albuterol or isoproterenol aerosol. Changes in one-second forced expiratory volume (FEV1) and maximal midexpiratory flow rate (FEF25-75) prior to albuterol or isoproterenol were positive after placebo and both doses of celiprolol. Propranolol, and to a lesser extent, atenolol, caused significant reductions in both measures of pulmonary function. Overall changes in FEV1 following each drug plus isoproterenol or albuterol were positive, in the rank order, celiprolol approximately placebo greater than atenolol greater than propranolol. Propranolol pretreatment caused a significant reduction in the effect of bronchodilator. Unlike atenolol and propranolol, celiprolol was highly bronchosparing and did not antagonize sympathomimetic bronchodilators.", 
    "38": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of celiprolol, a new beta-blocking drug, on the clinical condition and pulmonary function of hypertensive patients with reversible bronchial obstruction. Celiprolol was compared with chlorthalidone, an antihypertensive drug without known effect on bronchial tone. The study consisted of a 4-week placebo run-in period and a 12-week titration period in which the dose of both drugs was increased at 4-week intervals if blood pressure was not reduced adequately. The doses of celiprolol were 200, 400, or 600 mg once daily; those for chlorthalidone 12.5, 25, or 37.5 mg once daily. Entry criteria were a diastolic blood pressure between 90 and 115 mg Hg, and FEV-1 between 40% and 80% of predicted value, increasing by 15% or more after salbutamol, and a need for occasional bronchodilator therapy. Prophylactic medication for asthma was given in constant dosage for a month before the study and throughout the study. Preliminary results on 66 patients demonstrate that neither drug had a clinically significant effect on FEV-1, FEF 25-75, or FVC. Clinical variables were not significantly changed by either drug: the average monthly asthma attacks fell from 18 to 13 with celiprolol and from 11 to 7 with chlorthalidone. FEF was reduced by more than 50% in two patients on celiprolol and three on chlorthalidone. Monthly asthma attacks increased by more than 100% in five patients on celiprolol and four on chlorthalidone. Thus, preliminary results are unable to demonstrate adverse effects from celiprolol in patients with asthma and hypertension.", 
    "39": "Beta adrenoceptor blocking drugs are all competitive inhibitors of the beta receptor although they may or may not possess, beta 1-(cardio)selectivity, intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) or partial agonist activity, alpha-blocking properties, while membrane stabilizing activity is now thought not to be important. Drugs with ISA give less of a reduction in resting and maximal exercising heart rate and consequently in cardiac output, than those without ISA. The possession of alpha-blocking activity also leads to less fall in cardiac output. Overall evidence suggests that peripheral resistance and peripheral blood flow is less reduced by ISA drugs. Post-beta blockade hypersensitivity which may be important in patients with ischemic heart disease if beta blocking drugs are suddenly stopped, is absent after beta-blocking drugs with ISA as they result in down regulation of beta receptors. Beta 1-selective drugs may result in less of a rise in blood pressure in response to isometric exercise, insulin hypoglycemia or smoking. There do not appear to be important differences in the effect on coronary flow. While presently available drugs can produce asthma in susceptible subjects there seems little doubt that beta 1 selective agents have less effect than other beta-blocking drugs, and give less inhibition of sympathomimetic bronchodilators. Nonselective, non ISA, beta-blocking drugs elevate triglycerides, cardioselective drugs possibly less so. Those with ISA may elevate HDL unlike those beta-blocking agents without this property. Beta adrenergic blocking drugs without ISA do not lower resting plasma noradrenaline, evidence suggests an increase; whereas those agents with marked ISA, suggests an increase; whereas those agents with marked ISA, e.g., pindolol, reduce it. Renin levels are lowered, but less so with ISA possessing agents. Some agents, e.g. atenolol, nadolol, sotalol, are hydrophilic, show poor brain penetration, are long-acting, are not liver metabolized, but are excreted by the kidneys unchanged. Others are lipophilic, e.g., metoprolol, propranolol, penetrate the brain, and are liver metabolized. Pindolol is metabolized about 50% by each route. Similarities between beta blocking drugs are dominant but differences are often clinically relevant.", 
    "40": "Although the cardiovascular effects of glucagon are understood, its mechanism(s) of action remains unclear. We studied the effects of increasing doses of glucagon (0.001, 0.01, 0.1 mg/kg) on cardiovascular responses in dogs relative to concurrent measurements of circulating glucagon, cyclic AMP, glucose, norepinephrine, epinephrine, triiodothyronine, thyroxine, and cortisol levels. Glucagon-induced increases in plasma cyclic AMP, glucose, and catecholamine concentrations paralleled the heart rate response to glucagon administration. Further studies were conducted to evaluate the role of beta-adrenergic function as well as calcium in mediating glucagon's actions. The tachycardic effects of glucagon (0.01 mg/kg) were unaltered by prior beta-adrenergic receptor blockade with propranolol (3.5 mg/kg total dose). The calcium antagonist verapamil (0.2 mg/kg bolus then 7.5 micrograms/kg/min/infusion) prevented glucagon-induced increases in heart rate. However, the coadministration of glucagon (0.01 mg/kg) with calcium (1.0, 5.0, 10.0, or 50.0 mg/kg) did not alter glucagon's cardiovascular effects. These data indicate that glucagon is a potent tachycardiac agent that also elevates circulating endocrine-related substances. The antagonism of glucagon's tachycardiac effects by verapamil suggests that glucagon's action may be via glucagon-induced calcium movement through calcium channels, although extracellular calcium changes do not alter glucagon's effect. Furthermore, the persistence of glucagon's cardiovascular actions following beta-adrenergic blockade indicates the potential clinical utility of glucagon in reversing the adverse effects of beta-blocker overdoses, and its potential usefulness in treating circulatory shock in \"beta-blocked\" patients.", 
    "41": "The effects of the cholinergic and adrenergic nerve stimulations on amylase release from the segment isolated from the rat parotid gland were investigated, employing the combined techniques of electrical field stimulation (FS) and tyramine application with automated fluorescence method for measuring amylase. The maximum amylase release in response to FS for a short period (1 min) was attained at 16 Hz frequency, 2 ms pulse width and 8 V strength stimulation in the absence of any autonomic antagonist. Periodic short-lasting FS using these parameters at intervals of about 15 min could reproduce similar sizes of amylase release for about 2 h. Continuous long-lasting FS (3 V, 2 ms, 16 Hz) caused a transient sharp increase in amylase release followed by a sustained one. The FS-evoked amylase release was completely abolished by tetrodotoxin (TTX) (10(-7) g/ml) and markedly reduced by atropine (7 X 10(-6) M) or by propranolol (10(-5) M), while it was scarcely affected by hexamethonium (3 X 10(-4) M) and phentolamine (10(-5) M). The maximum stimulus frequency of short-lasting FS for amylase release in the presence of propranolol was similar to that (16 Hz) in the control, but it was higher (32 Hz) in the presence of atropine. Reduced response in amylase release to FS by propranolol was completely restored by the superimposed addition of dibutyryl cyclic AMP (10(-4) M). Application of tyramine (5 X 10(-4) M) evoked amylase release in the presence of atropine, which was blocked mostly by propranolol and partly by phentolamine, while tyramine was ineffective in the tissue segment from rats pretreated with 6-hydroxydopamine. From these results the following were suggested; that the intrinsic cholinergic neurotransmitter activates a muscarinic receptor of the acinar cell, while the adrenergic neurotransmitter stimulates mainly a beta-adrenergic and partly an alpha-adrenergic receptor, resulting in amylase release.", 
    "42": "The pathogenesis of electrical instability of tissue in the earliest phase of ischaemia is well known. Convincing results in the prevention of ventricular fibrillation at this stage have been obtained only by agents inhibiting sympathetic activation of the heart, or by agents significantly prolonging the refractory period of heart cells. On the other hand, it was documented that sodium channel inhibitors are not suitable for prevention of electrical instability in the early phase of ischaemia and can, on the contrary, aggravate it. A question which is still unresolved and deserves further research is the effect of calcium channel inhibitors and of agents acting directly on the metabolism of ischaemic tissue.", 
    "43": "The frog sinus venosus shows spontaneous regular pacemaker activity, even in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. When an alpha-adrenergic blocking agent (phentolamine) is applied, the rate of pacemaker activity, height of action potential, rate of slow diastolic depolarization, and the maximum diastolic potential become strongly dependent upon the extracellular Ca2+ concentration.", 
    "44": "Sotalol, a beta adrenergic antagonist that prolongs action potential duration and refractoriness, was administered to ten patients with chronic, symptomatic ventricular ectopic activity. Eight patients had ischaemic heart disease, one patient congestive cardiomyopathy, and one patient atypical chest pain and no structural abnormality. Twenty-four hour Holter ECG tapes were analyzed during a drug-free period, and after three and six months of continuous Sotalol therapy. Satisfactory control of ventricular premature contractions was initially achieved in nine patients. Longer follow-up confirmed maintenance of antiarrhythmic efficacy in five (50%) patients. Sotalol was especially effective in reducing high grade arrhythmias (couplets, \"R on T\" VPCs). That efficacy and the low frequency of side-effects make Sotalol an agent of notable value in suppressing ventricular arrhythmias, especially in patients who require antianginal therapy.",

Among K+-channel inhibitors tested, apamin (0.1 mumol l-1) and procaine (5 mmol l-1) did not modify the relaxant action of nicorandil. In contrast, tetraethylammonium (TEA, 8 mmol l-1) caused five fold antagonism. Trachealis exposed to K+-rich (120 mmol l-1) Krebs solution developed near-maximal tension. Nicorandil relaxed the K+-depolarized tissue though its concentration-effect curve was shifted markedly to the right. In tissues in which tone was induced by histamine, methylene blue (100 mumol l-1) antagonized nicorandil and sodium nitroprusside but did not modify the relaxant action of aminophylline. Intracellular electrophysiological recording showed that nicorandil (1 mumol l-1) could evoke some relaxation in the absence of electrical changes. Higher concentrations (10-1000 mumol l-1) reduced the amplitude and frequency of spontaneous electrical slow waves. Nicorandil also caused concentration-dependent hyperpolarization and relaxation. When the hyperpolarization was sufficiently pronounced slow wave activity was abolished. TEA (8 mmol l-1) induced slow waves which were surmounted by a spike potential. TEA slightly reduced the maximal hyperpolarization induced by nicorandil and increased the time required for nicorandil to abolish slow wave discharge. Procaine (5 mmol l-1) induced slow waves of relatively low frequency. Sometimes these were surmounted by a spike potential Procaine markedly reduced the hyperpolarization induced by nicorandil and increased the time required for abolition of slow waves. In studies of the efflux of 86Rb+ from muscle-rich strips of trachea, nicorandil (1000 mumol l-1) increased the efflux rate constant, whereas isoprenaline (1 mumol l-1) was without effect. It is concluded that nicorandil-induced relaxation does not involve the activation of beta-adrenoceptors but is partly attributable to the formation of nitric oxide from the nitrate moiety in its molecular structure. Nicorandil can evoke relaxation in the absence of membrane potential change but towards the upper end of its effective concentration range, nicorandil increases membrane K+ conductance and thereby evokes hyperpolarization of trachealis cells. The K+ channels opened by nicorandil are permeable to 86Rb, insensitive to apamin and TEA but may be inhibited by procaine.", 
    "49": "The antihypertensive effect of pafenolol, a new beta 1-selective adrenoceptor blocker without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and three times more selective than metoprolol, was evaluated. Twenty-three patients with essential hypertension, mean age 49 years (range 21-62), were randomized after a 4-week placebo run-in period (double-blind) to 4 weeks of either placebo, pafenolol 50 mg or 100 mg once daily. A submaximal exercise test was performed before and at the end of the treatment period. Pafenolol 50 mg and 100 mg significantly reduced recumbent and standing blood pressure compared with baseline with a mean reduction of 17/14 and 10/12 mm Hg on pafenolol 50 mg and 15/10 and 14/10 mm Hg on pafenolol 100 mg, respectively. Heart rate, both at rest and during exercise, was significantly reduced (p less than 0.05) on pafenolol 100 mg compared with placebo. The reduction in exercise heart rate (percent) was dose dependent and significantly correlated to the log plasma concentration of pafenolol (r = 0.60; p less than 0.05). It can be concluded that pafenolol had a clinically relevant antihypertensive effect when given once daily. No difference between 50 and 100 mg could be demonstrated, thus suggesting that 50 mg may be the preferred dose for antihypertensive treatment.", 
    "50": "The effects of a long-acting formulation of pinacidil (P1134), a new arteriolar vasodilator, have been investigated in normal humans. We observed the effects of pinacidil 37.5 mg when given alone, and when given in combination with propranolol 40 mg. The reflex tachycardia observed in the supine and standing positions after pinacidil was reduced by concurrent administration of propranolol. Combined treatment reduced systolic arterial pressure in the standing position from 117.0 +/- 2.5 to 98.3 +/- 3.5 mm Hg at 4 h after drug administration (p less than 0.01), which was greater than the hypotensive effect produced by either drug alone. These results indicate that the combination of pinacidil and a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist may be of value in the treatment of arterial hypertension.", 
    "51": "In intact cats, cumulative doses (0.1-10 mg/kg i.v.) of labetalol produced dose-dependent decreases in heart rate and arterial blood pressure and dose-dependently reduced i.v. phenylephrine induced pressor responses. In spinal cats devoid of resting sympathetic tone, labetalol (1 mg/kg i.v.) produced a sustained elevation of heart rate and a transient fall in arterial blood pressure. In reserpine-pretreated, adrenalectomized cats, labetalol produced quantitatively the same effects as in spinal cats, indicating that the cardiovascular effects observed in cats with no resting sympathetic tone are due to a direct action of labetalol rather than via catecholamine release. The elevated heart rate due to labetalol in spinal cats was reduced by subsequent administration of the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, propranolol. Further, pretreatment with propranolol prevented the tachycardic and depressor effects of labetalol in spinal cats. In a separate group of spinal cats, labetalol administered in cumulative doses of up to 1 mg/kg i.v., produced graded increases in heart rate and also dose dependently reduced i.v. isoproterenol-induced tachycardic responses. Pindolol, a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist with partial beta-agonist activity, produced similar effects in spinal cats at cumulative doses of 1-30 micrograms/kg. These results indicate that the alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, labetalol possesses partial beta-adrenergic receptor agonist activity. This intrinsic sympathomimetic action of labetalol appears to be more sustained on cardiac than on vascular beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "52": "The effects of selected drugs on the sustained atrial flutter induced in conscious dogs with surgically produced right atrial enlargement (TI dogs) were evaluated. This was done to better understand the electrophysiologic mechanism of the tachyarrhythmias. Agents known to cause a slowing of atrioventricular (AV) nodal conduction--verapamil, methacholine, and phenylephrine--did not significantly decrease the rate of the induced flutter, whereas beta-adrenergic stimulation with an infusion of isoproterenol increased the rate of the flutter in all trials. Propranolol and atropine had little effect on the atrial flutter rate. Agents known to increase atrial refractoriness, such as procainamide, n-acetylprocainamide, bretylium, and clofilium, all increased the cycle length of the induced flutter and, in some cases, terminated the arrhythmia. These results suggest then that the perpetuation of the sustained atrial flutter in the conscious TI dog is not due to a delayed afterdepolarization mechanism but is more likely due to reentrant excitation. Furthermore, it is unlikely that the flutter is due to reentry over a pathway involving the AV node; rather, the arrhythmia seems to be caused by reentrant excitation of the leading circle type.", 
    "53": "The rat ventral prostate and the human hyperplastic prostate contain adenylyl cyclases which can be activated by a variety of neurotransmittors, including vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), beta 2 adrenergic agonists, and dopamine. In both species the response to VIP was predominantly localized to the epithelial fraction. In the human tissue activation of the enzyme could also be achieved with prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) and an alpha 2 adrenergic agonist both associated with the stromal compartment. Castration in the rat caused a marked reduction in the basal activity of the enzyme and the maximal level of the hormone-stimulated response per cell (per mg DNA), but had only minor effects on the pattern of activation when expressed per mg membrane protein. Androgen treatment (dihydrotestosterone propionate, 2.5 mg/day) prevented the castration effects. Estrogen treatment (estradiol benzoate, 125 micrograms/day) could not prevent the castrational changes but maintained enzyme activity at a level above that of the castrate. There were no major qualitative differences in the pattern of activation of the cyclase between the different lobes of the rat prostate and the seminal vesicle.", 
    "54": "Cardiac arrhythmias arise from abnormalities of impulse initiation or impulse conduction or both. A review of the electrophysiological mechanisms of the genesis of cardiac arrhythmias and of the electrophysiological principles of the treatment of the cardiac arrhythmias leads to: categorization of antiarrhythmic drugs into five classes based on their dominant cardiac electrophysiological actions; a series of categories of their effects on impulse initiation and impulse conduction in different types of cardiac cells; and a systematic approach to pharmacological management of cardiac arrhythmias.", 
    "55": "The present study was designed to clarify the role of serum angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) in the occurrence and maintenance of hypertension in essential hypertension (EH). For this purpose, following experiments were carried out: 1) Correlations between serum ACE activity and renin activity (PRA), aldosterone concentration (PAC) and bradykinin concentration (PBC) in plasma, and blood pressure (BP) as well as serum creatinine levels. 2) Circadian rhythm of serum ACE activity. and 3) Effect of furosemide, upright posture, both furosemide and upright posture, propranolol, indomethacin, 9 alpha-fluorocortisol or angiotensin II (A-II) on the serum ACE activity, PRA, PAC and circulating plasma volume (CPV). The following results were obtained: The serum ACE activity was 30.2 +/- 5.0 U/ml (means +/- SD) in EH as a group, which was significantly higher than that (27.3 +/- 3.9 U/ml) in age matched normotensive subjects (NT) (p less than 0.001). While there was no significant difference in the enzyme activity between low-renin EH (LREH) and NT, a significant difference was found between normal- (NREH) or high-renin EH (NREH) and NT (p less than 0.05 for NREH, p less than 0.01 for HREH). A negative correlation was observed between enzyme activity and age in EH (r = -0.221, 0.05 less than p less than 0.10) as well as in NT (r = -0.306, p less than 0.05). No significant relationships were observed between enzyme activity and BP in either EH or NT. There was a significant positive correlation between enzyme activity and PRA in NT. (r = 0.501, p less than 0.001), NREH (r = 0.658, p less than 0.001) and HREH (r = 0.695, p less than 0.001). However, no significant relationship was found between them in LREH. The enzyme activity was significantly correlated to PAC in NT (r = 0.368, p less than 0.01), NREH (r = 0.567, p less than 0.001) and HREH (r = 0.529, p less than 0.01), but not in LREH. Although no significant correlation was observed between enzyme activity and PBC in NT, NREH and HREH, a significant relationship was found in LREH (r = -0.460, 0.05 less than p less than 0.10). The enzyme activity was not related to serum creatinine levels in EH as well as in NT. In NT, the serum levels of ACE activity reached a maximum values at 6:00 a.m. or 9:00 a.m., and gradually decreased between 6:00 p.m. and 3:00 a.m. An almost similar circadian rhythm of enzyme activity was found in EH.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "56": "Nocturnal deterioration of pulmonary function in asthmatic patients is a well-recognized and well-documented phenomenon. The mechanism of this \"morning dip,\" however, remains uncertain. Although the circadian rhythms of body temperature, corticosteroid, catecholamine, histamine, and opiate peptide levels, and even sleep itself have been shown to be in phase with the diurnal variation in asthma, a causal relationship has yet to be established. Increased nighttime bronchial reactivity to histamine, acetylcholine, and house dust allergen have been demonstrated. In general, continuous treatment with theophylline, beta-adrenergic agonists, or corticosteroids attenuates the degree of morning dip but does not completely eliminate the circadian rhythm of asthma. The significance of nocturnal asthma is emphasized by the observation that asthma deaths occur more frequently during nighttime hours and are often preceded by large daily swings in peak expiratory flow. Further studies examining the etiology and treatment of nocturnal asthma are needed.", 
    "57": "Enalapril is an inhibitor of the converting enzyme which transforms angiotensin I into angiotensin II, an octapeptide with pharmacological properties uniformly tending to increase blood pressure. The enalapril molecule is not active until it has been hydrolyzed into enalaprilic acid in the liver. This acid induces a very strong (85-95%), very early (maximum at 2 hours) and long lasting (20% at 72 hours) blockade of the angiotensin-converting enzyme, resulting in a paralleled fall in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The fall begins with a 2.5 mg dose of the drug, is maximum with 10 mg and is not increased by higher doses. No tachyphylaxis has been observed with prolonged administration. The fall in blood pressure is due to reduction of peripheral resistance, without changes in heart rate and cardiac output. There is no sodium retention. The two main pharmacokinetic features of the drug are its very long half-life and the 100% urinary excretion of the active metabolite. The drug can be taken as a single dose at any moment of the day. The only known interaction is with propranolol, which reduces by one-third the bioavailability of enalapril. Side-effects are uncommon and mild.", 
    "58": "The treatment of arterial hypertension in diabetic patients still raises numerous problems. In this type of patients, the most commonly prescribed drugs (beta-blockers, diuretics, antihypertensive agents acting on the central nervous system) have troublesome and potentially detrimental effects (e.g. effects on lipids). The new categories of antihypertensive drugs recently introduced (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium antagonists) are likely to be most useful in these patients. In an open trial in non-insulin-dependent diabetics with arterial hypertension followed-up for 1 year, enalapril administered alone has proved effective and devoid of clinical and biochemical side-effects. If these results are confirmed, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors will rank high as first-choice treatment of arterial hypertension in diabetics.", 
    "59": "The mechanism of action of B-HT 933 (azepexole) was studied on the rat vas deferens and myenteric plexus-longitudinal muscle (MP-LM) of the guinea-pig ileum. The drug caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of the twitch response in both preparations. The maximal inhibition in both preparations was 80-90%. B-HT 933 did not affect the cumulative dose-response curves of the vas deferens and of MP-LM to noradrenaline (NA) and acetylcholine (Ach) respectively. Yohimbine antagonized in a competitive way the twitch inhibitory effect of B-HT 933 on vas deferens and on MP-LM; the pA2 values were 8.62 and 8.5, respectively. The twitch inhibitory effects of B-HT 933 were not antagonized by propranolol. The results suggest that the action of B-HT 933 is mediated by stimulation of presynaptic alpha 2-receptors.", 
    "60": "Exposure of islets to high levels of glucose at a critical time leads to enhanced insulin release when later stimulated by glucose. Newly synthesized insulin is preferentially released with subsequent stimulation, implying the creation or enlargement of a separately regulated pool of insulin in response to the initial stimulus. Epinephrine via beta adrenergic receptors can trigger the discharge of the enhanced insulin pool via a beta adrenergic receptor response. Raising intracellular cAMP levels or stimulation by arginine also discharge the marked pool. The enhanced pool is accessible by several independent mechanisms.", 
    "61": "To investigate pre-synaptic influence of the descending noradrenergic system on the primary afferents containing substance P (SP), effects of noradrenergic manipulations on the in situ release of immunoreactive SP (iSP) from the dorsal horn were examined in the thalamic rabbit. Local application of noradrenaline (10 microM) to the dorsal horn produced complete inhibition of the noxious mechanical stimuli-evoked release of iSP. This effect was reversed by yohimbine (the more selective alpha 2-blocker, 10 microM) and partially antagonized by prazosin (the more selective alpha 1-blocker, 10 microM). The resting release of iSP was not affected by noradrenaline. The noxious mechanical stimuli-evoked release of iSP was significantly increased by acute spinal transection and local application of yohimbine (10 microM) alone to the dorsal horn. Prazosin (10 microM) slightly increased the evoked iSP release, and a beta-blocker metoprolol did not affect it. These results suggest that the nociceptive primary afferents containing SP are tonically inhibited by the descending noradrenergic system linked to alpha-adrenoceptors, and that such alpha-adrenoceptors located on the primary afferent terminals may be one of the sites of action of noradrenaline spinal analgesia. In contrast to the evoked iSP release, the resting iSP release was increased only by acute spinal transection and not by yohimbine, prazosin and metoprolol. All these observations suggest that tonic inhibition in propriospinal neurons containing SP is mediated by a non-noradrenergic system.", 
    "62": "The widespread use of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists against hypertension, angina pectoris and migraine or as a preventive treatment after myocardial infarction has encouraged us to investigate the effects of these drugs on platelet function. The aim of this study was to examine whether beta-blocking drugs interfere with platelet beta- adrenoceptors and whether this dependency is related to their selectivity for beta-adrenoceptor subtypes. Beta-adrenoceptor stimulation of human platelets with isoprenaline increased cyclic AMP (cAMP), which is known to inhibit platelet aggregation. Furthermore, our studies showed that cAMP formation in vitro was stimulated by non-selective and beta 2-selective agonists, but not by the predominant beta 1-agonist prenalterol. Isoprenaline- stimulated cAMP formation was blocked by the non- selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists propranolol, timolol, and alprenolol, while the beta 1-selective antagonists atenolol and metoprolol had no influence on an isoprenaline-induced cAMP formation. Receptor binding studies using (3H)-dihydroalprenolol revealed an IC50 value for propranolol of 85 nM, while metoprolol only displaced the bound (3H)-dihydroalprenolol at far higher concentrations (IC50, 20 microM). We conclude that the human platelet beta-adrenoceptors are mainly of the beta 2- subtype and that beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, especially the non-selective antagonists interfere with platelet function assessed as platelet cAMP formation.", 
    "63": "Beta-adrenergic-associated cyclic AMP accumulation was studied in intact lymphocytes before and after transformation with Epstein-Barr virus into immortal cell lines. Although a marked reduction in isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic AMP synthesis was observed in transformed cells, forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation was preserved. A parallel loss of 125-iodocyanopindolol binding sites suggests that the reduction in beta-adrenergic-stimulated AMP synthesis is due to receptor down-regulation.", 
    "64": "beta-Adrenergic receptors, the GTP-binding regulatory protein that stimulates adenylate cyclase (Gs), and adenylate cyclase were each purified and reconstituted into unilamellar vesicles composed of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine (3:2, w/w). The molar ratio of receptor:Gs:adenylate cyclase was estimated to be about 1:10:1. Adenylate cyclase activity in the vesicles was stimulated up to 2.6-fold by beta-adrenergic agonists. Stimulation was dependent on the presence of guanine nucleotide, displayed appropriate beta-adrenergic selectivity and stereoselectivity for agonists, and was blocked appropriately by beta-adrenergic antagonists. Therefore, while additional proteins may modulate adenylate cyclase activity in native membranes, these results show that these three proteins are sufficient for the expression of hormone-stimulated adenylate cyclase.", 
    "65": "The catecholamine derivatives aminomenthylnorepinephrine (compound 1) and bromoacetylaminomenthylnorepinephrine (compound 2) were synthesized and their interaction with the rat lung beta-adrenoreceptor was characterized. Compared to (-)-isoproterenol, compounds 1 and 2 were 10 and 280 times less potent, respectively, at inhibiting (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol binding. At pH 7.4, all 3 compounds induced a loss of receptors (40-60%) which could be recovered by treatment with guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p). However, at pH 8.1 Gpp(NH)p treatment did not recover those receptors lost by compound 2 only. The compound 2-induced receptor loss at pH 8.1 was time-dependent, prevented by propranolol but unaffected by Gpp(NH)p or after membrane heating at 50 degrees C which prevented the formation of the agonist high affinity binding state. Although, the maximal receptor loss as measured by [3H]dihydroalprenolol was 40-60%, more than 80% of the receptors were lost when measured by direct agonist binding, and the receptors left showed little agonist high affinity binding state formation. In rat reticulocyte membranes, compounds 1 and 2 stimulated adenylate cyclase activity with intrinsic activities of 0.55 and 0.31, respectively. However, at pH 8.1, compound 2 initially stimulated the enzyme followed by a blockade. These data indicated that both compounds 1 and 2 were partial beta-adrenoreceptor agonists and, at pH 8.1, compound 2 appeared to bind irreversibly only to those lung receptors able to form the agonist high affinity binding state. Furthermore, after irreversible binding, compound 2 appeared to act as an antagonist.", 
    "66": "In a double-masked randomized prospective study, 19 adult white subjects with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were treated twice daily with drops of 0.25% betaxolol (a relatively selective beta 1-adenoceptor antagonist) or placebo for six weeks. The nine betaxolol-treated subjects demonstrated a statistically significant average decrease in intraocular pressure of 3.8 +/- 5 mm Hg, evident after one week and persisting throughout the entire six-week treatment period. The ten placebo-treated subjects exhibited a statistically nonsignificant increase in intraocular pressure of 0.4 +/- 2.4 mm Hg. Mean systemic arterial blood pressure, pulse rate, corneal sensitivity, pupil diameter, and basal tear secretion remained unchanged in both groups. Transient stinging upon instillation of the eyedrops was the only side effect in the betaxolol-treated subjects but in no case did it necessitate cessation of therapy.", 
    "67": "In the context of a controlled antihypertensive drug trial, blood pressure readings obtained by the physician in his office were compared with ambulatory blood pressures recorded with the semi-automatic Remler device. The beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent timolol or methyldopa were administered in double-blind fashion to 30 patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension. All exhibited a diastolic office blood pressure of greater than 95 mm Hg at the end of a 4-week placebo period. All patients then received a combination of hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg/d) and amiloride (2.5 mg/d). After 4 weeks of diuretic therapy, timolol (10 mg/d, n = 14) or methyldopa (250 mg/d, n = 16) were added randomly for 6 weeks. The dose of all antihypertensive agents was doubled after 2 weeks of therapy with diuretics combined with timolol (n = 7) or methyldopa (n = 16) because of the persistence of diastolic blood pressure levels of greater than 90 mm Hg at the office. When assessed in the office, the antihypertensive effect of timolol and methyldopa was similar. During ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, however, pressure levels tended to be lower in the patients given timolol (p less than 0.05 for the diastolic). These data show that ambulatory blood pressure monitoring may be very useful in comparing the antihypertensive efficacy of different drugs.", 
    "68": "A high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the quantitative assay of oxprenolol in human plasma is described. After addition of alprenolol as internal standard, the compounds are extracted from plasma at alkaline pH into an organic phase and back-extracted into an acidic aqueous phase. Separation of the plasma components and metabolites was achieved on a reversed-phase column. Concentrations down to 66 nmol/l (20 ng/ml) can be determined with UV detection at 222 nm. This technique compares favourably with gas chromatographic and gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric methods.", 
    "69": "We have reported that the divalent cation ionophore A23187, like the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol, increased the force of contraction and rate of relaxation and shortened the duration of contraction of papillary muscles isolated from guinea pigs. A23187 produced a fall in resting tension and decreased the contracture tension of K +/- depolarized muscles, as did isoproterenol. In the present studies, isoproterenol produced a concentration-dependent, rapid, and sustained increase in the cyclic AMP (cAMP) content of papillary muscle. In contrast, A23187 had no detectable effect on cAMP levels, even in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, papaverine. Neither drug, at concentrations maximal for contractile effects, altered cyclic GMP (cGMP). Isoproterenol increased the cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity ratio, whereas A23187 did not change the activity of this enzyme. However, both A23187 and isoproterenol produced a concentration-dependent increase in phosphorylase activity. Concentrations of A23187 or isoproterenol that enhanced contractility maximally increased the alkali-labile phosphate (by ca. 35%) but were without effect on the acid-labile, alkali-stable phosphate in the total acid precipitable protein. Contractile effects of isoproterenol, which reflect activated Ca2+ uptake, and the increase in phosphorylase activity produced by this agent are believed to be due to an increase in cAMP with subsequent activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinases and phosphorylation of proteins. A23187 may produce similar contractile effects without an increase in cAMP or cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity by activating other protein kinases and/or inhibiting phosphoprotein phosphatases, most likely by its effects on intracellular calcium.", 
    "70": "A method for the determination of alprenolol and its 4-hydroxy metabolite has been developed. The urine sample is made alkaline with buffer (pH 12) and derivatized with 60 microliter of 2 M phosgene in toluene with vigorous shaking. In the presence of 2.5% methanol, an oxazolidineone methyl carbonate is formed from 4-hydroxy alprenolol. The now neutral derivatives are extracted with an equal volume of dichloromethane. After evaporation of the organic phase, the residue is taken up in a small volume of ethyl acetate and subjected to capillary column gas chromatography with CP-Sil 8 as the stationary phase. The precision was 2.1% at the 3.3 micrograms/ml level of the metabolite in urine (n = 8). The isopentylamino analogue was used as the internal standard.", 
    "71": "We examined effects of treatment with cardiac glycosides, in combination with noradrenergic stimulation or depletion, on (Na+,K+)-ATPase activity in rat cerebral cortex, heart, and kidney. Treatment with digitoxin increased the apparent number of (Na+,K+)-ATPase sites in heart, cerebral cortex, and kidney. Ouabain, which crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly, did not affect enzyme in brain but was otherwise similar. Norepinephrine depletion prevented the increase in heart but not in cerebral cortex. Noradrenergic stimulation increased the number of sites in cerebral cortex and in heart. In rats treated with digitoxin, noradrenergic stimulation increased enzyme activity further in heart but not in cerebral cortex. Examination of effects on noradrenergic receptor binding and on norepinephrine metabolite concentrations suggested that, while in heart cardiac glycosides appeared to increase norepinephrine release, in brain there was no effect on release but there may have been appreciable inhibition of norepinephrine reuptake under stimulated conditions.", 
    "72": "The present investigation has assessed the influence of assay buffer (Tris versus Krebs) on the abilities of several beta-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists to displace the radioligand (-)-[125I]iodocyanopindolol [( 125I]CYP) from beta 1-(left atrial) and beta 2- (uterine) adrenoceptor sites. Saturation studies indicated that the dissociation constant (KD) for [125I]CYP at both beta-receptor sites was approximately 2-fold greater in Krebs as opposed to Tris buffer, and that the maximal density of binding sites (Bmax) in atria (but not uterus) was also reduced 2-fold. In general, the KD values for beta-adrenoceptor agonists were more influenced by the type of buffer used than were KD values for antagonists. Agonist KD values at beta 2-adrenoceptor sites were higher in Krebs than in Tris buffer, while at beta 1-adrenoceptor sites, variable changes resulted. The selective affinity of agonists at beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor sites was therefore markedly influenced by the buffer used and could not be predicted from the established beta 1-/beta 2-adrenoceptor selectivity of the agonists as found in organ bath studies.", 
    "73": "The distribution and characteristics of beta-adrenoceptors in postmortem human brain was studied using quantitative autoradiographic techniques. 125I-Cyanopindolol was used as a ligand. High densities of beta-adrenoceptors were found in the caudate, putamen, different cortical areas and layers and the hippocampal formation. Low densities were present in other areas such as the thalamus, hypothalamus, midbrain and cerebellar cortex. Specific beta 1 and beta 2 antagonists were used to visualize and quantify separately the two subtypes of beta-adrenoceptors. Computer analysis of the competition curves obtained revealed that the putamen was enriched in beta 1 sites while the cerebellum contained predominantly beta 2 adrenoceptors. The regional distribution of beta-adrenoceptor subtypes was found to be similar to that seen in the rat brain.", 
    "74": "As a result of concern about the safety and long-term toxicity of diuretics, there is a growing trend toward the use of alternative agents as initial therapy in essential hypertension. Worldwide, beta blockers and vasodilators, especially the calcium-channel blockers, are the most commonly used alternative agents. Several studies comparing these 2 classes of medications are reviewed. These studies indicate that verapamil, nifedipine and diltiazem are all comparable in efficacy to beta blockers. When combined, calcium-channel blockers and beta blockers produce additive responses. These agents may differ in the relation between the magnitude of their antihypertensive effect and patients' pretreatment plasma renin activity and age. Younger persons and those with high plasma renin activity tend to respond better to beta blockers; older subjects and those with low plasma renin activity are more consistently responsive to calcium-channel blockers. The choice of agent should be individualized, based upon accompanying illnesses, adverse-effect profile and demographic factors.", 
    "75": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system regulates blood pressure and volume homeostasis in addition to sodium and potassium metabolism, and may be linked to divalent cation metabolism as well as hypertensive disease. In essential hypertension, circulating serum magnesium and Ca++, and the calcium regulating hormones, parathyroid hormone, calcitonin and 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin (1,25D) are different in the various renin subgroups. Elevated blood pressure induced by such maneuvers as dietary salt loading is associated with exacerbations of these calcium metabolic deviations, and appears related to salt-induced changes in serum Ca++ or 1,25D levels. Short- or longer-term lowering of blood pressure with the calcium-channel blocker, nifedipine, or with calcium or magnesium supplementation is associated with a shift of renin system activity and calcium metabolic indexes back to average normotensive values in those subjects most susceptible to these hypotensive agents. These observations suggest that deviations in calcium metabolism in essential hypertension may be related to the pathophysiology of the hypertensive process. Further, renin system activity and calcium metabolic indexes such as serum Ca++ levels may help target specific subgroups of hypertensive populations most susceptible to various dietary or drug maneuvers, and thus may provide a basis to better understand and treat clinical hypertension.", 
    "76": "Whether or not the kidney is involved in the genesis of hypertension in an individual patient, it becomes a major determinant of the response to antihypertensive therapy once a treatment strategy is adopted. The major mechanisms through which the kidney influences blood pressure are renin release and sodium retention, either together or separately, but additional mechanisms may also contribute. When sodium intake is restricted or a diuretic is used, the reactive increase in plasma renin activity makes a substantial contribution to limiting the blood pressure fall. When vasodilators or agents that block the sympathetic nervous system are used, sodium retention plays an important role. Among newer agents, the effectiveness of calcium channel blockers, converting enzyme inhibitors and perhaps dopamine analogs reflects, for reasons that differ from 1 class of agent to another, a special action on the kidney that limits the reactive renal response to the reduction in blood pressure. Treatment strategies that address the problem of the renal response are more likely to be effective than approaches that avoid or ignore it.", 
    "77": "There is considerable rationale for the use of the calcium entry-blocking drugs for the treatment of hypertension and prevention of recurrent episodes of angina pectoris in patients with systemic hypertension and significant coronary artery disease--the 2 entities commonly occurring together. Calcium entry-blocking drugs improve myocardial blood flow while decreasing myocardial oxygen demand. These agents can be given to most patients with ischemic heart disease and its complications, and are associated with a relatively low incidence of serious adverse effects and toxicity during long-term therapy. They reduce the frequency of anginal attacks, prolong exercise time to ST-segment depression or angina and improve exercise capacity. With long-term therapy, tolerance does not develop as it does in many patients with the \"long-acting\" nitrates. Calcium entry-blocking drugs reduce systolic blood pressure in patients with hypertension by a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance and a uniform improvement in blood flow affecting the myocardium, kidney and brain. There are no central nervous system adverse effects and hypokalemia does not occur. Unlike therapy with the beta-blocking drugs, chronic treatment with the calcium entry blockers does not reduce the serum level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol nor increase serum triglyceride concentration. The calcium blockers decrease the arterial blood pressure without increasing intravascular plasma volume and are associated with only a slight increase in reflex-mediated sympathetic activity and heart rate, the latter occurring predominantly with nifedipine. Calcium entry-blocking drugs provide alternative or preferred therapy to beta-blocking agents in patients with a combination of hypertension and angina pectoris.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "78": "beta-Adrenoceptor blocking drugs interfere with adenosine diphosphate-stimulated platelet aggregation. Alprenolol, exaprolol, K\u00f6 1124 and propranolol inhibited the aggregation, metipranolol decreased the extent and rate of aggregation significantly. Atenolol potentiated the aggregation measured by amplitude significantly. The interaction of beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs with aggregation correlated with the displacement of calcium ions from binding sites in isolated platelets and the fluidization of the whole platelets and isolated platelet membrane as measured with electron spin resonance of the spin probe. The most potent were highly liposoluble drugs alprenolol, exaprolol, metipranolol and propranolol which increased the calcium displacement and membrane fluidity, the least active was atenolol decreasing these phenomena. The inhibition by beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs of stimulated platelet aggregation is rather a result of unspecific than specific receptor interaction.", 
    "79": "The binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA), [3H]prazosin and [3H]clonidine was assayed in whole brain and various brain regions of audiogenic seizure (AS) susceptible DBA/2J (D2) mice aged 10, 24 and 50 days (i.e. before, during and after their period of AS susceptibility, respectively) and in age-matched C57BL/6J (B6) controls. In whole brain, at 24 days, [3H]DHA binding was similar in the two strains, while the binding of [3H]prazosin and [3H]clonidine was significantly lowered in D2 mice. No difference could be detected in 10 and 50 day old mice with any of the ligands. Regional studies indicated an involvement of the cerebral cortex, the olfactory bulbs and the brain-stem. alpha- (but not beta-)adrenoceptor changes were concomitant with the AS susceptibility period. These changes were unevenly distributed in the brain of D2 mice; they suggest that alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor subtypes might play different roles in the AS of the D2 mouse strain.", 
    "80": "Phosphorylation induced by cAMP-dependent protein kinase was examined in a plasma membrane-enriched fraction from control and beta-adrenergic-stimulated rat aortic myocytes. Phosphorylation of a 16 kDa protein which copurified with the plasma membrane marker (Na+ + K+)-ATPase was most prominent. It was decreased by pretreatment of the myocytes with isoproterenol and the effect of isoproterenol was inhibited by propranolol. Both phosphorylation induced by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and its inhibition by isoproterenol pretreatment declined in preparations exposed to endogenous phosphatase. These results provide strong evidence that beta-adrenergic stimulation of aortic myocytes induces in situ phosphorylation of a 16 kDa plasma membrane protein.", 
    "81": "Abrupt cessation of antihypertensive drug therapy is potentially hazardous, especially when beta blocker drugs are suddenly withdrawn from patients with ischemic heart disease, when unstable angina, myocardial infarction and sudden death may result. A milder 'discontinuation syndrome' may follow abrupt cessation of many drugs commonly used to treat hypertension. The syndrome consists of symptoms and signs suggesting sympathetic nervous system overactivity, with or without an accompanying rise in blood pressure. If this rise occurs, pre-treatment levels may be reached or even exceeded. Treatment of this condition is simple once it is recognized. Reintroduction of the drug or drugs in question, perhaps in reduced dosage, is effective management and guidelines are suggested for the safe withdrawal of antihypertensive drug therapy where it is medically indicated. Nadolol (Corgard) has not previously been reported as a cause of the discontinuation syndrome. A case is described where abrupt cessation of nadolol provoked unusually prolonged and severe signs of sympathetic overactivity on two occasions in the same patient.", 
    "82": "The spectrum of agonist activity for three new homologs of histamine (cis- and trans-imidazolylallylamine and imidazolylpropargylamine) was evaluated in the isolated guinea pig ileum and right atrium. The homologs were about three log units less potent than histamine in stimulating contractions of the longitudinal muscles of the ileum, but they were histamine-like, pharmacologically, because they were sensitive to blockade by pyrilamine and resistant to blockade by atropine. In the right atrium, these weak agonists were partially sensitive to blockade by cimetidine. The agonist activity of the cis-isomer in particular was completely blocked by a combination of cimetidine and propranolol, but resistant to reserpine treatment (neuronal catecholamine depletion). Therefore, these homologs of histamine have the ability to stimulate H1- and H2-histamine receptors and beta-adrenoreceptors in vitro.", 
    "83": "The mechanism of propranolol induced bronchoconstriction in asthma is uncertain, as airway beta adrenoceptors are not innervated by sympathetic nerves and circulating adrenaline concentrations are not raised. Propranolol 10 mg was infused over 27 minutes in 14 subjects with mild asthma. Peak expiratory flow (PEF) decreased by 80-235 l/min (17-51% of baseline) in nine subjects, who were called \"responders,\" and by less than 50 l/min (12% of baseline) in five \"non-responders\". These two groups did not differ in baseline ventilatory function or in any clinical characteristic. In \"responders\" mean PEF had decreased significantly from 440 to 390 l/min after infusion of propranolol 2.1 mg, though the maximum fall in PEF occurred during or within five minutes of the end of the infusion. In nine of the subjects (six \"responders\" and three \"non-responders\") the possibility that propranolol induced bronchoconstriction is due to blockade of mast cell beta receptors leading to increased mediator release was examined by measurement of plasma histamine concentration as an index of mast cell degranulation. There was no consistent change in plasma histamine concentration in either group. No evidence of increased mast cell mediator release has been found in association with propranolol induced bronchoconstriction."
