    "0": "1. By substituting one anti-hypertensive drug for the other in a panel of hypertensive patients equipotent doses have been determined. 2. Thus 40 mg of propranolol is equivalent to 4-5 mg of pindolol, 98 mg of practolol, 128 mg of alprenolol, 49 mg of metoprolol, 42 mg of tolamolol and 4-4 mg of timolol. 3. Bendorfluazide (10 mg) is eqivalent to 1-6 mg of bumetanide, 20 mg of chlorthalidone, 35 mg of mefruside and 3-5 mg of amiloride together with 35 mg of hydrochlorthiazide. 4. Methyldopa (250 mg) is equivalent to 6-0 mg of debrisoquine and 0-5 mg of St 600 (Boehringer), which is a clonidine-like substituted imidazoline.", 
    "1": "1. Immediate and long-term blood pressure-lowering activity of five beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists with different ancillary pharmacological properties were compared in a randomized double-blind placebo controlled factorial trial in twenty-five previously untreated patients with stable uncomplicated essential hypertension. 2. In doses which produced similar reductions in exercise tachycardia, all drugs exerted similar anti-hypertensive activity, which was greater on systolic than diastolic pressure and greatest during exercise. 3. These effects were maximum within an hour and lasted for over 8 h after a single oral dose. 4. Blood pressure-lowering activity, particularly the reduction in exercise systolic pressure, was significantly related to the logarithm of the dose of each drug. 5. Anti-hypertensive activity was maximally enhanced after 4 weeks of sustained treatment at any given dose. There was no short-term habituation to treatment and substitution with placebo resulted in a return of the blood pressure to pretreatment values within 4 weeks without subsequent overshoot. 6. The blood pressure-lowering activity of these drugs was predominantly related to their common property of competitive antagonism of cardiac beta-adrenoreceptors; their ancillary pharmacological properties, with the exception of intrinsic vasodilator activity, played little part in this response.", 
    "2": "1. Oxygen consumption and central haemodynamics were recorded at rest and during exercise in fifty-one men with essential hypertension (W.H.O. stage I) and repeated after 1 year on a single drug: alprenolol (n equals 10), atenolol (13) metoprolol (12) and timolol (16). 2. Mean arterial pressure was significantly reduced in all groups at rest (11-18%) and during exercise (5-11%). Heart rate was significantly reduced in all groups (20-28%) at rest and (17-26%) during exercise. Owing to increase in supine resting and exercise stroke volume in the alprenolol and atenolol group, cardiac index decreased less than heart rate---in contrast to the timolol group where cardiac index was decreased 26-32%. The calculated post-treatment total peripheral resistance was significantly increased at rest and during exercise in the timolol group. In the other groups the total peripheral resistance was significantly increased at rest when sitting, but not at rest when supine and during exercise. 3. It is concluded that the major haemodynamic changes induced in subjects with moderate and mild essential hypertension by these different beta-receptor blockers are the same, but that minor differences exist with respect to effect upon stroke volume and total peripheral resistance.", 
    "3": "1. Beta-Recptor-blocking drugs are rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration. Systemic availability is nevertheless incomplete for propranolol, alprenolol and oxprenolol, owing to \"first-pass' extraction by the liver. 2. Plasma half-life is between 2 and 4 h, except for sotalol (10-12 h). Plasma elimination of propranolol is reduced with decreased liver blood flow observed in congestive heart failure or during chronic propranolol therapy itself. 3. beta-Receptor blockade is usually achieved in these concentration ranges: propranolol and alprenolol, 50-100 ng/ml; oxprenolol, 500-1000 ng/ml; pindolol, 10-30 ng/ml; sotalol, 2-6 microng/ml. Higher concentrations are often found with high doses administered to hypertensive patients.", 
    "4": "1. The presynaptic mechanisms appear to be involved in the regulation of noradrenaline release during nerve stimulation. The first one. mediated by beta-adrenoceptors, operates at low frequencies of nerve stimulation, leading to an increase in transmitter release. The second one, mediated through alpha-adrenoceptors, is triggered when higher concentrations of the transmitter are reached in the synaptic cleft, leading to inhibition of transmitter release, probably through a restriction in the availability of calcium for the secretory process. 2. It is postulated that part of the anti-hypertensive effects of drugs like clonidine, alpha-methyldopa and beta-receptor-blocking agents may be related to their long-term effects on presynaptic adrenoceptors.", 
    "5": "1. A Valsalva-like manoeuvre was used to elicit graded rises in total peripheral resistance (TPR) in conscious rabbits. The rises were reflex and mediated through sympathetic constrictors. Propranolol infused at different rates reaching plasma concentrations up to 240 (SEM 33) ng/ml had no effect on this reflex but reduced mean arterial pressure. However, the response was attenuated by clonidine in a dose-dependent manner. 2. Valsalva manoeuvres were used to elicit graded sympathetically mediated rises in TPR index in twenty-nine subjects with mean arterial pressure ranging from 75 to 165 mmHg. Absolute sensitivity of the constrictor response increased with rising resting TPR index, resulting in some enhancement of constrictor responses in the hypertensive subjects. It seems likely that non-autonomic factors (e.g. vessel structure) rather than hyperactive neural constrictor effects are involved in the enhanced constrictor responses in essential hypertension.", 
    "6": "Effects of bufetolol and propranolol, adrenergic beta-receptor blocking and anti-arrhythmic drugs, on active and passive membrane properties of the dog papillary muscle were investigated with microelectrode and sucrose-gap methods. Bufetolol (10(-5) to 10(-4) g/ml) and propranolol (10(-6) g/ml) significantly decreased the maximum rate of rise of the action potential. The maximum responsive frequency to driving stimulus was decreased in the presence of bufetolol (3 X 10(-5) g/ml) and propranolol (10(-5 g/ml), whereas the effective refractory period was not affected. The critical threshold potential was shifted to more positive potential in the presence of the drugs. The passive membrane property, the space constant (lambda), the time constant (tau) and the current-voltage relations of the muscle membrane were not significantly altered by the drugs. It is concluded that bufetolol and propranolol suppress the excitability of the muscle membrane and this action may be ascribed to the decrease in the sodium conductance (gNa) and to the rise of gNa onset potential without alteration in the passive membrane property.", 
    "7": "The studies were undertaken to determine whether isoflurance inhalation is associated with a degree of beta-adrenergic action that is potentially important in clinical situations, and to compare the circulatory tolerance to isoflurane and halothane in dogs following beta blockade. We measured arterial and pulmonary artery pressure, left and right ventricular filling pressure, heart rate and cardiac output, and derived stroke volume and systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances in 13 mongrel dogs. The haemodynamic response to 1 MAC and 2 MAC isoflurane was studied in seven dogs and was similar before and after propranolol 0.1mg/kg i.v. In six dogs, propranolol 0.5mg/kg caused no significant changes in the circulatory response to 1 MAC and 2 MAC isoflurane or 1 MAC halothane. However, in three dogs, administration of 2 MAC halothane after propranolol 0.5mg/kg resulted in such profound circulatory depression as to preclude further study. These data suggest that (a) isoflurane possesses no clinically important beta-adrenergic stimulating activity; (b) there is no adverse drug interaction upon the circulation with the combination of isoflurane and propranolol; (c) in the presence of moderated profound beta-adrenergic blockade, 2 MAC isoflurane may be tolerated better than 2 MAC halothane.", 
    "8": "An analysis is made to help decide on the best form of treatment for atherosclerotic coronary disease. Available data on surgical treatment are reviewed with emphasis on prognosis and management of the patient with stable angina.", 
    "9": "The effect is critically reviewed of chronic administration of beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists on morbidity and mortality in angina pectoris and myocardial infarction. There is inconclusive evidence that the abrupt cessation of therapy with these agents may increase morbidity and mortality in angina pectoris. The type of anginal patient in which this may occur is not yet defined and neither is the mechanism. There is no evidence that beta-antagonists prolong the life of anginal patients. In the acute phase of experimental myocardial infarction, these drugs reduce mortality but do not do so in man. There is increasing evidence that they prolong life if administered to patients surviving the acute phase of myocardial infarction. The need for further studies is discussed.", 
    "10": "The use of beta-blocking agents against hypertension and their rapid extension in daily practice we have to consider the problem of anesthesia of a patient undergoing such treatment. Continuation of the treatment increases the operative risk, discontinuation long before the operation leaves the hypertension to reappear and discontinuation 48 hours before may lead to a coronary or arrhythmic accident. Therefore, except in case of emergency, treatment may be maintained until the day before the operation, and in case or emergency extensive atropinisation is desirable. Finally prescription of selective beta-blocking agents decreases the risks.", 
    "11": "Seventeen amateur bowlers taking part in local bowling competitions were given either 40 mg of oxprenolol or placebo before the competitions, so that each subject played two competitions on oxprenolol and two on placebo in random order. All the bowlers had a relative tachycardia 15 min before the competition which was abolished by oxprenolol. A similar reduction in the heart rate during and after the compeptition was likewise seen after oxprenolol. The drug caused only minor changes in the systolic blood pressure in comparision with placebo. On the whole, the total scores of placebo and oxprenolol competitions did not differ significantly from each other, nor was there any difference between the scores of the trial competitions and the average results during previous season. However, when the bowlers were divided into subgroups according to the effect exerted by oxprenolol on performance, about one third of the bowlers did benefit from the oxprenolol treatment while 50% had worse results. The bowlers whose bowling performance was improved by oxprenolol exhibited significantly higher heart rates before, during and after the competition as compared with the subgroups not responding beneficially to the active drug. The effect of oxprenolol was most pronounced during the very first series and the harmful effect of the drug was mainly seen in the last series of the competition. One reason for the impairment of the general performance could conceivably be an \"overrelaxed\" state as indicated by the greater number of misses made by the bowlers when treated with oxprenolol.", 
    "12": "The use of an injectable combination of a local anaesthetic (Xylestesin) and a beta-receptor-blocker (Betadrenol) during maxillo-facial surgery is described in this paper. The statistical analysis of pulse and blood pressure recordings of 30 patients demonstrated no significant blood pressure changes; there was a significant decrease of the cardiac rate, however. It was noted that the negative chronotropic effect was the greater the higher the rate rate was before injection. The local anaesthetic described is of great therapeutic value, in particular for apprehensive patients and patients with tachycardia.", 
    "13": "The primary aim during anesthetic management of the patient with coronary artery disease is prevention of imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand. Since oxygen supply is limited by restriction of coronary blood flow, prevention of increases in demand plus maintenance of supply, rather than increases in supply, will achieve this aim. The major determinants of myocardial oxygen demand are mechanical, i.e. (a) left ventricular wall tension, dependent in turn upon systolic pressure and ventricular volumn, (b) velocity of contraction, and (c) heart rate. Systolic pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and heart rate monitoring will alert the anesthetist to increases associated with an enhanced oxygen demand. Decreased arterial diastolic and increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure are associated with decreased supply. By appropriate manipulation of these variables and avoidance of episodes of myocardial ischemia, the perioperative morbidity and mortality rates associated with coronary artery disease may be decreased.", 
    "14": "In order to develop a better dopamine receptor radioligand, [3H[apomorphine was prepared and tested for dopamine-like binding properties in both calf and human brain tissues. Specific binding of [3H]apomorphine was defined as that binding which occurred in the presence of 1 muM (-)-butaclamol (an inactive neuroleptic) minus that occurring in the presence of 1 muM (+)-butaclamol (active neuroleptic). The specific binding was saturable, the number of sites being double that of specific [3H]dopamine binding, and occurred primarily in dopamine-rich regions of postmortem human brains. The binding had a dissociation constant of 0.9 nM for human caudate (2 nM for calf caudate) and was blocked by dopamine and norepinephrine, but not by isoproterenol or (-)-propranolol, distinguishing it from a beta-adrenergic receptor. Since there was little desorption of [3H]apomorphine, the ligand permits extensive washing during routine assays for dopamine receptors, and facilitates biochemical purification of the receptor.", 
    "15": "A segment of the facial vein of the rabbit, that opposite the buccal cavity, responds to norepinephrine (NE) and opposite the buccal cavity, responds to norepinephrine (NE) and transmural nerve stimulation (TNS) by a brisk biphasic dilation. The dilation in response to both procedures is reveresed by prior exposure to propranolol (10(-6)M). Pretreatment with phenoxybenzamine (10(-5)M) increases the size of the neurogenic response and displaces the NE dose-relaxation curve to the left. Histamine causes a constrictor response exclusively. Sympathetic stimulation of a segment of the facial vein proximal to this buccal segment, and also of the external jugular vein, results in constriction. Light microscopy showed no fequtres which can account for the dilation, and fluorescence histochemistry using a modified Flack technique showed a dense adrenergic nerve plexus extending throughout the thickness of the media. We found that frequency-response characteristics and neuronal uptake of 3H-NE were consistent with findings for a blood vessel with a heavy medial innervation. Also, monoamine oxidase and catechol O-methyltransferase activities were similar to those found in other rabbit veins. Furthermore, these results are consistent with an adrenergic neuroeffector organization in which there is a predominance of beta- over alpha-adrenergic receptors. In conclusion, the presence of a dilator response in this buccal segment of the facial vein may be related to its location in the wall of the cheek, where it may be subjected to considerable stretch.", 
    "16": "Dopamine (30 and 45 mug) administered intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) to a group of 10 conscious normotensive cats caused dose-related increases in blood pressure and heart rate. In 4 of these animals the initial cardiovascular stimulant effects of i.c.v. dopamine were followed by hypotension and bradycardia. 2 alpha-Methyldopamine (30 and 45 mug i.c.v.) produced qualitatively similar responses to dopamine except that the cardiovascular stimulant effects were smaller and the secondary depressant effects somewhat more prolonged. 3 Both stimulant and depressant effects of i.c.v. dopamine and alpha-methyldopamine were greatly inhibited by autonomic ganglion blockade or by adrenergic neurone blockade. 4 The cardiovascular stimulant effects of both i.c.v. dopamine and i.c.v. alpha-methyldopamine were selectively inhibited by beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents whilst the cardiovascular depressant effects of these substances were abolished by the alpha-adrenoceptor blocker phentolamine or by the dopamine-beta-hydroxylase inhibitor disulfiram. 5 Haloperidol by either i.c.v. or the intravenous route abolished both cardiovascular stimulant and depressant effects of i.c.v. dopamine, whilst pimozide by either route inhibited only the cardiovascular stimulant effects. 6 In 2 cats, injection of dopamine into the cisterna magna produced predominantly depressant effects on the cardiovascular system except with a higher dose which induced biphasic responses.", 
    "17": "The mechanisms of action, clinical use and untoward reactions of the beta-adrenergic blocking drugs, with particular attention to the role of these agents in the treatment of hypertension, are reviewed. Specific topics covered include the effect of beta-adrenergic blockade on the heart, renin secretion and the central nervous system; the efficacy and pharmacokinetics of beta-blocking agents; combinations with other drugs; patient acceptance and advantages; and toxicity and side effects. It is concluded that, with proper dosage titration, most hypertensive patients could probably be controlled on beta blockers alone or in combination with a diuretic.", 
    "18": "There are selective blocking agents (antagonists) for alpha receptors and beta receptors. These blocking agents prevent the response to injected agonists and neurogenically released norepinephrine. The principal cardiovascular response to alpha blockade is postural hypotension with reflexly induced cardiac stimulation. If neurogenic vasoconstriction is present, this will be removed. The principal cardiovascular response to beta blockade is bradycardia. If fast arrhythmias are present, these will be slowed. Beta blockade tends to increase peripheral resistance. Unless circulation is previously impaired this vasoconstrictive effect is insignificant.", 
    "19": "Phosphorylase activity was found to increase 2-fold as compared with the control value (79% and 39% respectively) within the first 2-3 s of the vasomotor effect elicited in the skeletal muscle by sympathetic stimulation. Phosphorylase activity was still high during the period of maximum blood flow, although to a lesser extent (54% and 45%). During the phase of restoration of the initial rate of blood flow the values of phosphorylase activity were the same in the experimental and the control sample. The AMP content did not increase with the initiation of the vasomotor effect, and this fact suggests that the increase in phosphorylase activity is due to an increase in phosphorylase \"a\" rather than to the activation of phosphorylase \"b\" by AMP. Atropine blocks both the dilator effect and phosphorylase activation elicited by sympathetic stimulation. Acetylcholine, injected intraarterially or added to a muscle homogenate, increases phosphorylase activity. It is concluded that acetylcholine, released by sympathetic nerve endings, performs a second mediator function, that of activating anaerobic metabolism in the skeletal muscle. The two mediator functions of acetylcholine seem to be spatially delimited.", 
    "20": "The effects of bupranolol, a new beta-blocker, on platelet functions were investigated in vitro in rabbits and humans as compared with propranolol, a well-known beta-blocker. At first, the effect of adrenaline on ADP-induced rabbit platelet aggregation was studied because adrenaline alone induces little or no aggregation of rabbit platelets. Enhancement of ADP-induced rabbit platelet aggregation by adrenaline was confirmed, as previously reported by Sinakos and Caen (1967). In addition the degree of the enhancement was proved to be markedly affected by the concentration of ADP and to increase with decreasing concentration of ADP, although the maximum aggregation (percent) was decreased. Bupranolol and propranolol inhibited the (adrenaline-ADP-)induced aggregation of rabbit platelets, bupranolol being approximately 2.4-3.2 times as effective as propranolol. Bupranolol stimulated the disaggregation of platelet aggregates induced by a combination of adrenaline and ADP, but propranolol did not. Platelet adhesion in rabbit was also inhibited by the beta-blockers and bupranolol was more active than propranolol. With human platelets, aggregation induced by adrenaline was inhibited by bupranolol about 2.8-3.3 times as effectively as propranolol. From these findings. We would suggest that bupranolol might be useful for prevention or treatment of thrombosis.", 
    "21": "The effects of 5 mg pindolol and 100 mg propranolol on the airway resistance were compared with a placebo in an inter-individual double blind trial in eight patients with chronic obstructive lung disease. Six hours after drug administration the patients inhaled two puffs of fenoterol (0.4 mg) from a metered aerosol to test the reversibility of the bronchoconstrictive effect. Airway resistance and intrathoracic gas volume were measured by body plethysmography. Propranolol increased the airway resistance significantly (P less than 0.01). The highest increase with a mean of 44% was measured two hours after ingestion. After six hours the mean increase was still 18%. Pindolol showed a barely detectable, statistically insignificant bronchoconstrictive effect in comparison with the placebo. With regard to the circulatory effects 5 mg pindolol and 100 mg propranolol were aequipotent, propranolol had a more pronounced effect in lowering the pulse rate, pindolol in lowering the blood pressure. Fenoterol can reduce airway resistance even after beta-blockade, but the effect was more profound after the placebo than after the beta-blocker.", 
    "22": "The records of 185 consecutive patients having myocardial revascularization were reviewed with regard to preoperative administration of propranolol and intraoperative or postoperative complications. Tachycardia and hypertension before cardiopulmonary bypass were slightly more common in patients never taking propranolol or those who had discontinued it for more than 48 hours before operation. There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of postbypass hypotension among patients who took propranolol within 24 hours of operation, those who discontinued it more than 24 hours before operation, and those who never took the drug. Operative mortality was not significantly different among patients who received propranolol within 48 hours of operation (3%), those who never took it and those who discontinued it more than 48 hours before operation (4%). Early in the series, five patients had an acute myocardial infarction within 48 hours after routine preoperative withdrawal of propranolol. Because complete withdrawal of propranolol in patients with unstable angina pectoris may lead to acute myocardial infarction, we recommend gradual withdrawal of the drug during 48 hours before operation. If this is not possible because anginal pain recurs or intensifies, then reduced doses may be given safely up to 10 hours before revascularization, provided that the patient is a satisfactory candidate for bypass and that adequate myocardial revascularization can be accomplished.", 
    "23": "The effect of intravenous administration of propranolol (3 to 10 mg) was studied in 12 patients with acute anterior transmural myocardial infarction within the first 8 hours from the onset of pain. Criteria for inclusion in the study were persistence of ischemic pain, S-T segment elevation of 0.3 or more mg in at least two standard precordial leads, heart rate of 80 or more beats/min, mean arterial pressure of 75 or more mm Hg and cardiac index of 2.5 or more liters/min per m2. Within 30 minutes of administration of propranolol, the sum of S-T segment elevations from leads V1 through V6 (sigmaST6) and the average S-T segment elevation over the left precordium recorded from multiple unipolar leads (ST) decreased significantly by 40 and 39%, respectively. At the same time, there was a significant reduction in heart rate (from 100+/-3 [standard error of the mean] to 79+/-4 beats/min), mean arterial pressure (from 112+/-6 to 95+/-5 mm Hg) and cardiac output (from 6.1+/-0.3 to 4.1+/-0.3 liters/min). Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure remained unaltered. Four hours later the hemodynamic variables had returned to control level, but the beneficial effect on myocardial injury persisted. These electrocardiographic changes were accompanied by resolution of ischemic pain and cessation of ventricular arrhythmias. The effects of propranolol were more pronounced in patients with angiographically demonstrable flow to the affected area of myocardium. Thus, administration of propranolol in the early hours of myocardial infarction can significantly reduce the signs of myocardial ischemic injury without excessively depressing myocardial function.", 
    "24": "In a double-blind study in six subjects propranolol significantly reduced the respiratory sensitivity to carbon dioxide rebreathing. This effect seems to have been due to beta-adrenergic blockade, since it was not seen with D-propranolol. In two subjects increasing doses of propranolol caused progressive reductions in respiratory sensitivity to values below normal and similar to those of patients with ventilatory failure. These changes are probably due to a central action of propranolol.", 
    "25": "On the basis of a personal case, the clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic problems of variants of dissecting aneurysm of the aorta with benign course are discussed. The usefulness of cardio-aortic angioscintigraphy in the interests of early diagnosis of aneurysm and aortography by catheterism for specifying its location and extent, is pointed out. Spontaneous benign development would seem to be tied up with the affected area of the aorta, the modalities of dissection, and above all with the establishment of a distal return breach for blood flow into the aortic lumen. The predominant role of cystic medionecrosis in determining dissection is stressed and the usefulness of intensive pharmacological therapy based essentially on hypotensive and beta-blocking substances confirmed.", 
    "26": "15 patients (4 females, 11 males, 21 to 55-year old) with mild to moderate essential hypertension (EH) were treated with placebo for two weeks and thereafter with increasing doses of prindolol (15 to 38 mg/day in the mean) and kept on a mean maintenance dosage of 32 mg/day for an average of 16 weeks in all. Blood pressure (BP), heart rate und plasma noradrenaline (PNA) concentrations were measured under standardized conditions (supine, standing, walking) at the end of two weeks on placebo and after the experimental treatment period. The results were compared to those of a group of 15 normotensive untreated control subjects (NS): after an average of 16 weeks on prindolol BP fell from 163/113 mm Hg to 129/91 mm Hg in the mean. PNA levels in EH before prindolol were significantly higher than in NS (supine: 272 +/- 22.0 ng/l (mean +/- SEM) vs. 135 +/- 15.1 ng/l, standing: 448 +/- 31.9 ng/l vs. 359 +/- 18.4 ng/l, walking: 388 +/- 22.5 ng/l vs. 234 +/- 22.1 ng/l). In EH chronic administration of prindolol led to a significant decrease in PNA concentrations under all the three test conditions to levels which did not differ significantly any more from those derived from NS. The adrenergic response to upright posture reflected in the percentage increase in PNA was significantly less in EH before prindolol when compared to the percentage increase in NS. On prindolol the adrenergic response was not abolidhed, yet it tended to approach the values found in NS. Before prindolol under resting conditions diastolic BP correlated closely with the corresponding PNA levels (p less than 0.01, r = 0.66, n = 15). This correlation could not be reestablished after prindolol treatment. The decrease in PNA after long-term treatment with prindolol was not correlated to the fall in blood pressure. The decrease in PNA indicates a lower activity of the sympathetic nervous system which may contribute to the antihypertensive effect of prindolol.", 
    "27": "Under standardised conditions Prindolol-therapy (3 X 5 mg/die) was carried out in patients with renal hypertension in addition to the preexisting anti-hypertensive treatment during a period of 8 weeks. After administration of Prindolol for 4 and 8 weeks a significant (p less than 0.05) reduction of blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) was observed. 3 weeks after discontinuing the Prindolol-therapy blood pressure rose again, but it clearly remained below pretreatment level. Peak values of blood pressure during the day were markedly lowered. Antihypertensive efficacy was age-related. Lowering of blood pressure occurred in 70% of our patients. There existed no relation between plasma-renin-level and reactivity of the patients to the antihypertensive effect of Prindolol. Renal function (creatine-clearance) did not alter significantly by Prindolol-treatment.", 
    "28": "The influence of amitryptiline, theophylline and furosemide on the concentration of cyclic-AMP and plasma renin activity (PRA) was investigated in renal vein plasma. Additionally, the stimulating effect of furosemide on the PRA after application of the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists propranolol and practolol and the cyclic AMP concentration in the plasma were measured. All drugs were given intravenously. After amitryptiline cyclic-AMP concentration increased about 1.5-fold compared with the basal value,PRA was not altered. After theophylline cyclic-AMP concentration increased about 1.2-fold, PRA 2.0-fold compared with the basal value, PRA was not altered. After theophylline cyclic-AMP concentration increased about 1.2-fold, PRA 2.0-fold coa increased within 7 min and no further increase was observed till the 15th min. After practolol cyclic-AMP concentration and PRA decreased about 20% compared with the basal value within 10 min. The stimulating effect of subsequently applied furosemide on PRA was not altered, but the cyclic-AMP concentration was not changed in this time by furosemide. After propranolol cyclic-AMP concentration and PRA decreased about 20% compared with the basal value. The cyclic-AMP concentration was not influenced by the following furosemide application, in agreement with the findings after practolol, however, PRA could be stimulated only in 36% of these patients under beta-receptor blockade. Our results show that changes of the concentrations of cyclic-AMP and of PRA are independent of each other. An elevated intracellular cyclic-AMP level due to the inhibition of phosphodiesterase is as a single factor unable to stimulate renin release. Our results give no evidence of a direct involvement of the adenylcyclase-system in the mechanism of renin release. The effect of propranolol and practolol on the basal value of PRA and cyclic-AMP is equal. The different influence of 10 mg propranolol and 20 mg practolol on the stimulating effect of 40 mg furosemide on the PRA can be interpreted as a dosage problem.", 
    "29": "A new fluorescent beta-blocker, 9-amino-acridin propranolol (9-AAP), was administered i.v. to rats. Multiple fluorescent 9-AAP binding sites were observed on cardiac muscle cells in frozen sections. Intensity and density of cardiac 9-AAP fluorescence were markedly reduced following pretreatment with (+/-)- and (-)-propranolol but not with (+)-propranolol. Our findings suggest that 9-AAP may label beta-adrenergic receptor sites in rat myocardium.", 
    "30": "Adenylate cyclase activity (AC) of homogenates of monkey frontal cortex was stimulated by catecholamines (dopamine, norepinephrine and isoproterenol), apomorphine, clonidine, NaF and GPP(NH)P. The increment in activity due to dopamine was enhanced in the presence of GPP(NH)P. The AC was also stimulated by 0.2-0.4 mM Ca2+ in the presence of 0.2 mM EGTA; at 0.8 mM Ca2+ had little or no influence on basal or NaF-stimulated activity. However, as Ca2+ concentration was increased from 0.2 to 0.8 mM stimulation by dopamine or GPP(NH)P was progressively inhibited. These results suggest a possible function of Ca2+ in modulating neurotransmitter stimulation of AC in the monkey frontal cortex. The AC exhibited higher sensitivity to dopamine than to norepinephrine or isoproterenol; however dopamine and norepinephrine caused the same maximum stimulation of the enzyme, a stimulation womewhat greater than that produced by isoproterenol. An additivity in stimulating AC was observed for dopamine and isoproterenol but not for dopamine and norepinephrine. Norepinephrine- or dopamine-stimulated AC was effectively blocked by fluphenazine and other dopamine-receptor blocking agents (relative potency for blockade; fluphenazine, haloperidol greater than clozapine, thioridazine greater than pimozide) but not by propranolol, a beta-receptor blocker. In contrast, isoproterenol-stimulated AC was antagonized by propranolol or alprenolol but not by fluphenazine. On the basis of these results, at least two distinct receptors appear to be associated with AC of monkey frontal cortex: (1) a beta-receptor stimulated by isoproterenol and (2) a new type of dopamine or dopamine-norepinephrine receptor, stimulated by either dopamine or norepinephrine. This latter system differs from more typical dopamine receptors found in caudate, retina and limbic cortex in that (a) it is not stimulated by 1-(3,4-dihydroxybenzyl)-4-(2-pyrimidinyl) piperazine (S584); (b) it is stimulated significantly by the putative alpha-receptor agonist, clonidine; (c) it is more sensitive to blockade by clozapine than primate retina or caudate; also the sensitivity to haloperidol is greater than has been reported for non-primate caudate; (d) it is very sensitive to stimulation by norepinephrine and to blockade by phentolamine (an alpha-receptor blocker).", 
    "31": "Sixty-two patients with moderately severe anxiety symptoms were treated in a double bline 3-week trial with either oxprenolol, diazepam or placebo. The Hamilton Anxiety Scale and a Target symptom improvement score were the main measures of change used. All treatment groups significantly improved in the three weeks of the trial. However in the third week of treatment improvement was greater in the diazepam and oxprenolol groups. Observer preferences significantly favoured the diazepam group. The implications of the study were discussed.", 
    "32": "The effect of the new beta-receptor-blocking drug metoprolol on hemodynamics and plasma renin activity was studied at rest and during exercise. 5 patients with essential hypertension were investigated before, 4 weeks after and 8 weeks after oral treatment (3 X 50 mg day). The results were compared to data of 5 patients under propranolol matched according to age, arterial blood pressure, and renin concentration. Metoprolol leads to a significant fall in renin and heart rate, whereas cardiac index is depressed only during exercise. Peripheral resistance remains unchanged and left ventricular filling pressure rises slightly. This results in a slight fall in arterial blood pressure. In comparison with propranolol the hemodynamic and renin patterns under metoprolol are similar, the only difference being the slighter fall in blood pressure due to a less depressed cardiac index.", 
    "33": "In a double-blind crossover study 12 patients with essential tremor were treated with propranolol and a placebo; 8 improved with propranolol and 3 with the placebo; the degree of improvement with propranolol was greater. In a similar study with diazepam 5 of 12 improved with diazepam and 4 of 12 with the placebo; the degree of improvement was less than that achieved with propranolol. Response in 21 patients to treatment with propranolol for 2 to 4 years was excellent in 4, good in 4 and fair in 10; the condition of 1 was unchanged and that of 2, worse. Excellent response was maintained for as long as 4 years, but response tended to deteriorate with time if initially it was less than excellent. Response decreased with increasing age. No patient 60 years of age or older had an excellent response, and the four with an excellent response were under age 55, three being under age 35; all four had had their tremor less than 12 years. Patients with essential tremor should be given a 3-month trial of propranolol at 120 mg/d; if no significant response is seen the dose should be decreased, then the drug discontinued.", 
    "34": "In rats, a 3-day stay at an altitude of 3454 m (paO2 approximately 55 mm Hg) provokes a 50% increase in pulmonary pressure and a 20% increase in right ventricular weight, edema of both ventricles, particularly the right, and marked alterations in energy metabolism. Propranolol (4 mg/kg/day), administered 1 day before the transfer to high altitude and during the days of stay, prevents the increase in pulmonary pressure and in right ventricular weight and decreases myocardial edema, but has no effect on the metabolic alterations.", 
    "35": "Patients with and without adverse reactions on practolol therapy showed altered immune responses. There was cutaneous anergy to Candida albicans and streptokinase/streptodornase antigens and depression of lymphocyte function in vitro. Anticomplementary activity and a wide range of autoantibodies were found in patients who had received practolol.", 
    "36": "Beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs have been found to be effective antihypertensive agents of similar efficacy to sympathetic inhibitory drugs and methyldopa. They have the advantage of not causing postural or exercise hypotension. While the antihypertensive effect is a function of beta-receptor blockade, the precise mode of action is unknown.", 
    "37": "The intraventricular administration of 6-hydroxydopamine, a procedure which destroys noradrenergic nerve terminals in the central nervous system, caused an increase in the density of beta-adrenergic receptors in rat cerebral cortex, without affecting their affinity for isoproterenol. The results suggest that changes in the density of adrenergic receptors are involved in 6-hydroxydopamine-induced supersensitivity at central noradrenergic synapses.", 
    "38": "Two infants with the classical involuntary movements of polymyoclonia and opsoclonus were treated with propanolol in a dosage of 2 mg/kg/24 hr. There was a marked improvement in the abnormal movements in both children. No side effects of treatment were encountered.", 
    "39": "A bipolar electrode was stereotaxically implanted in the substantia nigra of male albino Wistar-Imamichi rats. Effects of l-norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), injected into the lateral ventricle, on the substantia nigral self-stimulation (SS) behavior, and the effect of alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists on the facilitation induced by NE were investigated. NE but not DA facilitated the SS behavior and GABA showed no constant effects on the behavior. Facilitation by NE of SS behavior was inhibited by phentolamine, but not by propranolol. These results suggest that the noradrenergic system in the brain may play a more significant role in the positive reinforcement of the substantia nigral SS behavior than does the dopaminergic or GABA-ergic system, and that the action of NE may be facilitated through alpha-receptors rather than through beta-receptors.", 
    "40": "A bipolar electrode was stereotaxically implanted in or near the medial forebrain bundle at the level of the posterior lateral hypothalamus of male albino Wistar-Imamichi rats. The relationship between the adrenergic system and the lateral hypothalamic self-stimulation (SS) behavior was investigated by intraventricular injection (by the use of the modelled hypodermic needle) of catecholamines. l-Epinephrine(Ep), l-norepinephrine (NE) facilitated the SS behavior dose-dependently. On the other hand, l-isoproterenol and dopamine revealed no detectable effects. Phentolamine inhibited the SS behavior, but propranolol had no marked effects. Facilitation by NE for the SS behavior was not induced when the current was cut off at the time of the injection of NE. These results suggest the following: a) the adrenergic or the noradrenergic system in the brain may play a more important role in the positive reinforcement of the lateral hypothalamic SS behavior than does the dopaminergic system. b) The action of Ep or NE may be facilitated through alpha-receptors rather than through beta-receptors. c) Facilitation by NE for the lateral hypothalamic SS behavior may not be due to the non-specific facilitation of lever pressing, but rather may be related to intracranial stimulation.", 
    "41": "The association of a prolonged Q-T interval, congenital deafness, and syncopal attacks due to ventricular fibrillation following emotional or physical stress is known as the Jervell-Lange-Nielsen syndrome. Absence of the congenital deafness characterizes the otherwise identical Romano-Ward syndrome. Both conditions have a high mortality rate and are recognized as contributing to sudden death in children. Although the pathogenetic factors are not yet completely elucidated, the condition is well enough understood to permit effective treatment. The authors performed a left stellate ganglion block in a 12-year-old girl with a mild form of the Romano-Ward syndrome, shortening the Q-T interval and eliminating the ventricular tachyarrhythmia. The left stellete ganglion block should be considered by anesthesiologists as an emergency measure, effective in interrupting the attack.", 
    "42": "Tests conducted on dogs established that glutaminic and aspargic acids introduced into the blood by the drip method call forth inhibition of the gastric secretion stimulated by other amino acids (alanine, glycine, proline). The dicarboxylic amino acids inhibit also the reflex phase of the gastric secretion provoked by injection of histamine. It is only against the background of a repeated introduction of histamine for many hours that they produce a sharply marked inhibitory effect. This manifests itself chiefly in dogs with denervated isolated pouches, while with intact innervation of gastric glands this effect is very poorly pronounced. Introduction of beta-adrenolytic-obsidan is attended by a drastic reduction of this effect.", 
    "43": "Studies were carried out to determine the antihypertensive effects of the 5-hydroxy derivative (ORF 12,592) of propranolol. Acute administration of ORF 12,592 produced a reduction in mean systolic blood pressure in desoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) rats and in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Propranolol was not effective in DOCA rats and produced a significant blood pressure reduction in SHR 48 hr after acute administration. These results demonstrated antihypertensive activity of an analog of propranolol and support the concept that the antihypertensive effects of propranolol may be mediated through a metabolite.", 
    "44": "A case of catecholamine-secreting chemodectoma of the neck in a 47-year-old male who also had temporal lobe epilepsy is described. Details of presentation, diagnosis and successful treatment are given. He was fully alpha blocked with phenoxybenzamine and given neuroleptic drugs but his blood pressure rose to dangerous levels when the tumour was handled and did not respond to intravenous phentolamine. Sodium nitroprusside was successfully used to achieve blood pressure control.", 
    "45": "A patient with muscular weakness demonstrating pathological lipid accumulation and abnormal mitochondria in skeletal muscle has been studied. The lipid accumulation and mitochondrial changes are thought to be related to the established deficiency of carnitine in this patient's muscle. The symptoms of muscular weakness associated with lipid accumulation in the skeletal muscle in the absence of complaint of muscle cramps or myglobinuria are thought to be diagnostic of carnitine deficiency. The failure of the sarcoplasmic reticulum to accumulate Ca2+ is discussed. The patient's strength responded dramatically when propranolol was added to his steroid therapy.", 
    "46": "1. The effects of five antiarrhythmic drugs (quinidine, procainamide, lignocaine, phenytoin and propranolol) were studied on pacemaker activity in the sinoatrial node and on contractility in twenty-three isolated, blood-perfused atrium preparations of dogs. Each drug was administered directly into the cannulated sinus node artery of an isolated atrium over a period of 4 s. 2. Quinidine produced negative chronotropic and inotropic effects. Occasionally, higher doses induced a biphasic inotropic effect, an initial negative phase being followed by an increase in contractility. 3. Three response patterns to procainamide were observed: negative chronotropic and inotropic effects; biphasic effects, initially negative chronotropic and inotropic effects being followed by positive effects; a biphasic inotropic effect and a negative chronotropic effect. The third pattern was most frequently produced by relatively high doses. 4. Lignocaine, phenytoin and propranolol induced dose-related negative chronotropic and inotropic effects. 5. All five of the antiarrhythmic drugs used caused sinus arrest in high doses. 6. Procainamide-induced positive chronotropic and inotropic effects were significantly inhibited by treatment with alprenolol or nadolol, but not by tetrodotoxin or desipramine. 7. These results indicate that procainamide-induced positive chronotropic and inotropic effects may involve an adrenergic mechanism.", 
    "47": "1. The effect of chronic administration of propranolol on the development and maintenance of severe renal hypertension in rats subjected to unilateral renal artery constriction was studied in relation to possible changes in peripheral PRA and the blood and tissue levels of propranolol. Propranolol was administered s.c. twice daily in doses of 1, 10 and 25 mg/kg, starting 2 days before operation. 2. Contrary to expectations, not only did the initial rise in systolic blood pressure become accelerated, but the established level of hypertension attained in the propranolol treated rats was of the same severity as that attained in placebo treated rats. Moreover, the progressive rise in peripheral plasma renin activity following unilateral renal artery constriction was not affected by propranolol administration. 3. The same doses of propranolol were also administered daily for 8 days to rats with established severe hypertension. A slight further rise in blood pressure occurred initially, followed by a moderate decrease of 15-25 mmHg. Propranolol failed to exert this minor hypotensive effect in hypertensive rats treated concomitantly with furosemide. No suppressive effect on the markedly increased levels of plasma renin activity was observed in these severely hypertensive rats in the presence or absence of furosemide administration. 4. These results indicate that in severely renal hypertensive rats propranolol has only a minor hypotensive effect and no blocking action on renin release under the conditions of study.", 
    "48": "The intracellular concentrations of serotonin (5-HT) in enterochromaffin cells (EC) in the cat small intestine have been studied by a cytofluorimetric method before and after long-lasting efferent vagal nerve stimulation in the neck. Such stimulation induces a decrease of 5-HT in EC of the gut as observed previously. Pretreatment with atropine could not block this decrease, suggesting a noncholinergic mechanism. Pretreatment with a beta-blocking agent, propranolol, or bilateral removal of the superior cervical ganglia could, however, block this 5-HT decrease. Pretreatment with an alpha-blocking agent, phenoxybenzamine, caused an increase in the 5-HT content of EC both with and without nerve stimulation; the reason for this is obscure. The results indicate, that vagal nerve stimulation induces a neurogenic 5-HT release from EC in the gut, and that adrenergic fibres, originating in the superior cervical ganglia, mediate this release probably via a beta-receptor mechanism. Whether or not an alpha-receptor mechanism is also involved cannot be judged at present."
