    "1": "Apparent insensitivity to pain, ritualistic patterns of behavior, and improvement in symptoms after administration of opiate receptor blockers implicated the endogenous opioid system in the initiation and maintenance of SIB. This study was designed to determine whether plasma levels of proopiomelanocortin (POMC)-derived peptides, beta-endorphin-like activity (beta E), ACTH, and adrenal cortisol immediately after an episode of SIB predicted subsequent response to an opiate blocker. Blood samples were collected from 10 patients with mental retardation within minutes of a self-injuring act and during an SIB-free control period. On another day, morning and afternoon samples were collected at least one week apart from the other samples. Effects on SIB of naltrexone hydrochloride (NTX) were examined in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. After an SIB episode, beta E, but not ACTH, was elevated compared with morning levels, p < .003. Patients with increased plasma levels of beta E after SIB had the most positive response to 2 mg/kg NTX, p < .03. Results suggest that changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis after SIB may predict differences in individual patient response to opiate blockers.", 
    "2": "S-(-)- Timolol maleate was oxidized, using the modified Pfitzner-Mofatt method, to the corresponding keto analog, which was then coupled with either hydroxylamine or methoxyamine in the same reaction medium. The products separated, timolone oxime (TO) or timolone methoxime (TMO), were found to be a mixture of both E and Z isomers with the Z isomer in higher concentration. Both isomers could be separated on silica column. No isomerization of any of the isomers could be detected whether in buffers or biological fluids. TMO salts were found to be stable in slightly acidic buffer. The Z isomer of TMO is more stable than the E isomer. Both TO and TMO showed pronounced reduction of the intraocular pressure (IOP) in normotensive rabbits, when instilled into the conjunctival sac. Reduction of IOP caused by either TO or TMO was higher than the reduction produced with the same dose of timolol maleate. Equal doses of any of the TMO isomers or the mixture of isomers gave almost the same percent reduction of IOP. TMO and TO did not show cardiovascular effects when administered intravenously to rabbits or rats. Both are good candidates to be used for topical management of glaucoma without producing systemic side effects.", 
    "3": "In hypertensive disease, the extent of target organ damage determines the prognosis. We conducted a 6-month, double-blind randomized study to compare the effects of an alpha1-adrenoreceptor blocker (bunazosin) with those of a beta1-adrenoreceptor blocker (metoprolol) on early hypertensive target organ damage at a similar level of blood pressure reduction. The study consisted of 43 patients (29 men and 14 women) of varying ages (mean age 52 +/- 9 years) with essential hypertension World Health Organization stage I-II. Both the alpha- and the beta-blocker lowered blood pressure to a similar extent measured by 24-h blood pressure monitoring. The left ventricular mass was comparably reduced in both cohorts (alpha-blocker 284 +/- 80 v 259 +/- 67 g, P < .05, beta-blocker 282 +/- 74 v 254 +/- 70 g, P < .05). Treatment with the alpha-blocker led to reduced total peripheral resistance (22.9 +/- 8.0 v 19.9 +/- 5.3 U, P < .05), whereas therapy with the beta-blocker resulted in an elevated total peripheral resistance (25.5 +/- 8.4 v 28.5 +/- 9.3 U, P < .10; P < .05 for the difference in both groups). Renal plasma flow remained constant in the alpha-blocker treated group but decreased in the beta-blocker treated group (508 +/- 141 v 477 +/- 134 mL/min/1.73 m2, P < .05). Glomerular filtration rate as measured by inulin clearance tended to increase after treatment with the alpha-blocker (112 +/- 20 v 115 +/- 18 mL/min/1.73 m2, P < .10) in accordance with a decrease of serum creatinine (1.00 +/- 0.14 v 0.93 +/- 0.12 mg/dL, P < .001). Plasma cholesterol and LDL cholesterol was lowered after treatment with the alpha-blocker (238 +/- 48 v 312 +/- 37 mg/dL; P < .001, and 153 +/- 32 v 130 +/- 25 mg/dL; P < .05) while remaining unchanged in group treated with the beta-blocker. Left ventricular hypertrophy was similarily reduced with alpha- and with beta-blockade at a comparable reduction of 24-h blood pressure. Alpha-blockers effected a more favorable renal and systemic hemodynamic profile than beta-blockers, but only long-term prospective studies will answer the question whether these hemodynamic effects result into a better cardiovascular prognosis.",

    "6": "After 12 weeks, carteolol 1% reduced the mean +/- SE intraocular pressure from 25.0 +/- 0.3 to 19.5 +/- 0.3 mm Hg; timolol maleate 0.5% reduced the mean intraocular pressure from 25.2 +/- 0.3 to 19.6 +/- 0.3 mm Hg. The mean difference in trough intraocular pressure between carteolol and timolol maleate of -0.14 mm Hg was not significantly (P = .745) different (95% confidence limits, -0.97 to 0.70 mm Hg). Trough pulse and blood pressure also showed no consistent statistically significant differences between groups. The 2-hour postdose pulse, however, demonstrated a greater decrease in the timolol maleate than in the carteolol group (P < .001). Systemic and ocular signs and symptoms were similar between the groups except that the number of treatment-emergent reports of bradycardia was greater in the timolol maleate group (P = .039), and the carteolol group reported fewer ocular symptoms than the timolol maleate group did (P < .01).",

    "14": "We applied the principles of molecular-size-restricted diffusion within a negative electrostatic field of force to follow the changes in the aqueous pore radius of tight junctions (TJs) induced by perturbants and the accompanying influence on the permeation of neutral (urea and mannitol), cationic (methylamine and atenolol), and anionic (formate and lactate) compounds that vary in size. The perturbants included palmitoyl-DL-carnitine (PC), which opens TJs by an unknown Ca++-independent mechanism, and ethyleneglycol-bis-(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), a Ca++ chelator. Mass transfer resistances of the collagen-coated filter support and the aqueous boundary layers were factored out to yield paracellular permeability coefficients (P[P]). As viewed from the P(P) values of urea and mannitol, EGTA exhibited insignificant effects on pore size at low concentrations compared with control, and then caused a dramatic opening of the TJs over a narrow concentration range (1.35-1.4 mM). The P(P) values for urea and mannitol remained constant at >1.4 mM EGTA. However, PC produced dose-dependent responses from O to 0.15 mM that plateaued at >0.15 mM. In general, cations permeated the cellular TJs faster and anions slower than their neutral images. The effects of changes in pore size (4.6 to 14.6 A in effective radius) on the ability of these solutes to permeate the TJs were analyzed by the Renkin molecular sieving function. These studies established an experimental, theoretical, and quantitative template to assess perturbants of the TJ and define the limits, short of detrimental effects, at which the TJs may be sufficiently perturbed for maximal enhancement of permeation of solutes varying in size and charge.", 
    "15": "A number of beta-adrenergic blockers, including timolol and propranolol, are administered in eyedrops for the treatment of glaucoma, but their therapeutic value is limited by a relatively high incidence of cardiovascular and respiratory side effects. Because of poor ocular bioavailability, many ocular drugs are applied in high concentrations, which give rise to both ocular and systemic side effects. Methods to increase ocular bioavailability include (a) the development of drug delivery devices designed to release drugs at controlled rates, (b) the use of various vehicles that retard precorneal drug loss, and (c) the conversion of drugs to biologically reversible derivatives (prodrugs) with increased corneal penetration properties, from which the active drugs are released by enzymatic hydrolysis. A homologous series of aliphatic esters of oxprenolol were synthesized and investigated as potential prodrugs for ocular use. The stability of each O-acyl derivative was investigated in aqueous solutions over the pH range 2.2-9.0 at 37 degrees C. The observed rate constants (k[obs]), shelf-lives (t90), lipophilicities, and Arrhenius parameters were determined for each ester. A study of the relationship between the structure and physicochemical parameters of the homologous series of oxprenolol esters at various pH values and temperatures was made.", 
    "16": "Our aim was to study the attenuation of the hemodynamic response to microlaryngeal surgery by beta-blocking agents used as support drugs to the anesthetic technique.

    "21": "Hypoxemia interferes with hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV). We investigated the respective roles of the autonomic nervous system and the mixed venous PO2 (PVO2) in the attenuation of HPV by hypoxemia. Pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs had their lungs separately ventilated with a dual-lumen endotracheal tube. Left (Ql) and total (Qt) pulmonary blood flows were determined using electromagnetic flow probes. HPV was initiated by ventilating the left lung with nitrogen for 5-10 min while the right lung received 100% oxygen. The animals were subsequently made hypoxemic by switching the right lung to room air ventilation (5-10 min). Two different protocol groups received either intravenous atropine during hypoxemia (group I) or intravenous propranolol prior to protocol initiation (group II). A third group of dogs (group III) had their mixed venous PO2S maintained above 30 torr during hypoxemia. In response to left lung hypoxia, Ql/Qt decreased from 44 +/- 5, 48 +/- 3 and 46 +/- 2% to 25 +/- 4, 28 +/- 2 and 26 +/- 3% in the three groups, respectively. During hypoxemia Ql/Qt increased to 50 +/- 7 and 47 +/- 3% in groups I and II. In group III dogs, Ql/Qt remained significantly decreased at 31 +/- 3%. Subsequent administration of atropine in group I had no effect on Ql/Qt. We conclude that the loss of flow diversion from a hypoxic lung during hypoxemia may be mediated primarily by a decreased in mixed venous PO2 when PVO2 is allowed to decrease to 15-20 torr.", 
    "22": "[carbonyl-11C]WAY-100635 is a new radioligand which can be used with positron emission tomography (PET) to provide high contrast delineation of human brain regions that are rich in 5-HT1A receptors. In the present PET study, the binding of [carbonyl-11C]WAY-100635 was characterized in the cynomolgus monkey brain. Pretreatment with each of the two reference compounds, WAY-100635 and 8-OH-DPAT, as well as the drugs buspirone and pindolo, induced a marked inhibition of [carbonyl-11C]WAY-100635 binding in the neocortex and the raphe nuclei. A preliminary Scatchard analysis yielded 5-HT1A receptor density values of the same order as those that have been reported in vitro. The study shows that [carbonyl-11C]WAY-100635 binds specifically to 5-HT1A receptors in the primate brain and has potential for determination of 5-HT1A receptor occupancy and density in psychiatric patients.", 
    "23": "Cardiovascular reflex mechanisms by topical laryngeal instillation of capsaicin (CAPS) or distilled water were evaluated in anesthetized chronic tracheostomized dogs. Both CAPS (10 micrograms/ml) and water instillation into the isolated upper airway caused a significant decrease in heart rate (P < 0.05) and a significant increase in blood pressure (P < 0.05) from the values before instillation under both spontaneous and controlled ventilation. The bradycardia was significantly reduced by atropine pretreatment (P < 0.05) and the hypertension was significantly decreased by phentolamine and propranolol pretreatments (P < 0.01). A higher concentration of CAPS (100 micrograms/ml) instillation considerably reduced the response to subsequent CAPS (100 micrograms/ml) instillation, whereas the response to water was sustained, indicating the desensitization of laryngeal CAPS-sensitive endings. All the reflex responses to CAPS and water were eliminated by topical anesthesia with lidocaine. It was concluded that the laryngeal cardiovascular reflex responses were mediated by the afferents such as the laryngeal CAPS-sensitive presumably C-fiber endings or water-responsive receptors and by both the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems as efferents.",

    "28": "Aortic stenosis confers an increased risk of complications during procedures with general anesthesia. There are no previously reported cases of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in patients with this valvular defect. Two cases are described of patients with moderate to severe aortic stenosis confirmed by echocardiography in whom courses of ECT resulted in clinical improvement without untoward cardiac complications. It is concluded that ECT can be safely given to patients with aortic stenosis in whom left ventricular function is normal.", 
    "29": "Intravenous beta-blockers are an effective means of controlling heart rate and blood pressure during electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), but have been shown to decrease seizure duration. While the importance of seizure duration to the antidepressant response of ECT grows less certain, there is growing evidence that seizure morphology predicts the antidepressant effect of ECT. This study examined the impact of esmolol pretreatment on seizure morphology. Eighteen depressed patients (6 men, 12 women; 69 +/- 12.8 years old) received ECT with and without esmolol pretreatment in a randomized, blinded crossover design. The seizures were blindly rated for duration of motor convulsion, duration of electroencephalogram (EEG) seizure, degree of seizure regularity, and degree of postictal EEG suppression. Esmolol shortened the duration of the motor convulsion and degraded the quality of the ictal regularity. Routine administration of intravenous esmolol before ECT may cause a decrease in ictal regularity. Careful consideration should be given to the potential benefits of esmolol versus the deleterious effect on the electrophysiologic process. Esmolol may still be indicated on a case-by-case basis for extreme tachycardia or hypertension associated with ECT, and presumably poses no problem for the therapeutic effect of ECT if given after the seizure is over.", 
    "30": "Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) induces sympathetically mediated hemodynamic alterations that can be associated with myocardial ischemia and arrhythmia generation. Esmolol, a short-acting beta-blocker, blunts the hypertension and tachycardia seen with ECT. The purpose of this study is to determine whether esmolol use during ECT reduces the incidence of myocardial ischemia or arrhythmias after ECT. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled protocol, with each patient acting as his/her own control, the effects of esmolol on the incidence of myocardial ischemia and arrhythmias were studied using two-lead Holter monitoring for at least 2 h post-ECT. Nineteen patients underwent 71 ECT treatments (34 placebo, 37 esmolol), recording 746 h of Holter data. The esmolol group had significantly reduced heart rate and mean arterial pressure immediately after ECT. There was no difference in the incidence of ECG defined ischemia post-ECT between groups, with 7 of 19 (36.8%) patients in the esmolol group showing ST-segment depression compared with 5 of 19 (26.3%) in the placebo group. There was no difference between groups in arrhythmia detection. This experiment demonstrates that (a) ECT is associated with a significant incidence of ST-segment depression, (b) esmolol blunts the sympathetic discharge during ECT, and (c) esmolol does not reduce the incidence of post-ECT ischemia or arrhythmia.", 
    "31": "A seventy one year old woman had a coronary artery bypass grafting. No touch technique to her ascending aorta was applied due to the severely atherosclerotic aorta. Cardiac arrest was induced by a large dose of short acting beta-blocker (Esmolol) without cross-clamping the aorta under the normothermic cardio-pulmonary bypass. The heart was flaccid and rotated easily while the coronary anastomoses were performed. Both of the internal thoracic arteries were grafted individually to the anterior descending artery and to the circumflex artery. The cardiac beats were resumed with the ordinary inotropic support and then the cardio-pulmonary bypass was weaned off. Her postoperative course was uneventful and the cardiac enzyme level was not elevated. Both of the grafts were revealed patent by the postoperative angiography. Esmolol had played an important roll to perform excellent anastomoses and to protect the myocardium. It was concluded that this technique could be one of the suitable modality for patients with diseased aorta and further studies should be pursued concerning Esmolol as an alternative to the conventional cardioplegia.", 
    "32": "It was first reported by our group in 1975 that heart failure due to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) could be improved by long term treatment with a beta-blocker, starting at a low dose and continuing with a stepwise up-titration. Since then, many studies have been performed in patients with heart failure of various aetiologies and the beneficial effects of long term beta-blockade have been confirmed. About 3000 patients have been included in randomised studies in which beta-blockade, given for more than 2 months, mostly elicited significant improvements in functional class, exercise capacity, cardiac function, quality of life and/or morbidity. When started at a very low dose (one-tenth to one-twentieth of the doses generally used in angina or hypertension), the treatment is well tolerated in most patients. In these studies, various types of beta-blockers were used, including beta1-selective blockers and nonselective blockers with additional properties (vasodilator and antioxidative) such as metoprolol, bisoprolol, bucindolol and carvedilol. Several large studies have also reported benefits on mortality and morbidity. In the Metoprolol in Dilated Cardiomyopathy (MDC) trial, metoprolol treatment in patients with IDC resulted in a 34% reduction of the primary combined endpoint, total number of deaths and need for cardiac transplantation. In the Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study (CIBIS), in patients with idiopathic as well as ischaemic cardiomyopathy, there was a nonsignificant 20% reduction in mortality. In the US carvedilol studies (n = 1094), also in patients with ischaemic and idiopathic cardiomyopathy, carvedilol reduced mortality by 65%, which was highly significant. A nonsignificant reduction in mortality was observed in the Australia-New Zealand (ANZ) Heart Failure Study with carvedilol. In all these studies there was a reduction in hospitalisations, with all drugs being generally well tolerated. It can thus be concluded that the beneficial effects of beta-blockers on cardiac function and morbidity have been documented in a large number of studies in selected groups of patients. The treatment has been accepted in some countries by the regulatory authorities. Larger, placebo-controlled studies are needed to convincingly demonstrate a reduction in total mortality as observed in the pooling of the 4 US carvedilol studies. Such studies are in progress for various beta-blockers, which may lead to acceptance of their routine clinical use in patients with congestive heart failure.", 
    "33": "We describe three cases of dynamic outflow obstruction complicating acute anterior myocardial infarction. Serial echocardiography suggests the intraventricular gradient results from basal hyperkinesis, the latter being a reciprocal response to the apical wall motion abnormality.", 
    "34": "In many patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, an abrupt mid-systolic drop in left ventricular ejection velocity can be detected. We analyzed 27 patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who had 43 echocardiographic examinations (mean gradient 53 +/- 6 mm Hg). Exams showing a mid-systolic drop had higher mean outflow tract pressure gradients (90 +/- 6 compared with 29 +/- 4 mm Hg, p < 0.001). After medical elimination of obstruction, the mid-systolic drop was no longer seen. We measured 105 pulsed-wave Doppler tracings in the left ventricular cavity and compared them with 90 continuous-wave tracings through the outflow tract. There was a close temporal correlation between the nadir of the left ventricular velocity drop and the peak continuous-wave left ventricular outflow tract velocity (r = 0.99). There was also a close temporal correlation between the onset of the fall in pulsed velocity and the onset of M-mode mitral-septal contact (r = 0.95).", 
    "35": "The mid-systolic drop in left ventricular velocity is due to impedance to ejection and provides evidence of true obstruction. As left ventricular ejection velocity falls to its mid-systolic nadir because of impedance of ejection, velocity downstream in the left ventricular outflow tract actually rises to its peak. This disparity in the two velocities, deceleration in the left ventricular cavity and acceleration in the left ventricular outflow tract, indicates that the outflow orifice is progressively narrowed over time as the mitral valve is forced into the septum by the rising pressure difference. The obstruction phase is best described as a time-dependent, amplifying feedback loop. The orifice narrows over time because of the rising pressure difference; the pressure difference rises over time because of the narrowing orifice.", 
    "36": "A procedure for analysis of metoprolol-utilizing extraction followed by derivatization with pentafluoropropionic anhydride and analysis on a gas chromatograph equipped with a fused silica capillary column, an electron-capture detector and a printer/integrator is described. Propranolol was carried through the procedure as internal standard. The pentafluoropropionyl derivative of metoprolol yields a sharp peak on the gas chromatograph, and the structure of the derivative was confirmed using combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The analytical method is linear, sensitive and reproducible and has been applied to analysis of metoprolol in brain and heart from rats treated with metoprolol intraperitoneally. Pretreatment of the rats with the antidepressant desipramine prior to metoprolol administration resulted in a marked increase in levels of metoprolol in both brain and heart, indicating a pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction between desipramine and metoprolol.", 
    "37": "Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is characterized by prolongation of the QT interval associated with a high risk for syncope and sudden death. Jervell and Lange-Nielsen initially described LQTS in association with congenital sensorineural deafness. We have investigated the prevalence of this syndrome in a school for deaf children, evaluating by ECG 350 congenitally deaf children with an age range of 6-19 years. The corrected QT interval (QTc) was calculated by Bazett's formula. Eight children with a QTc interval >440 ms were further studied by cardiac examination, repeat ECGs (three times), Holter monitoring, echocardiography, and exercise testing. The families were assessed for a history of syncope and deafness and underwent ECG evaluations regarding lengthened QTc interval. Among these eight children only two girls aged 14 and 15 years were diagnosed as having LQTS according to Schwartz's criteria (0.57% of the 350 deaf children; 95% confidence intervals 0, </= p </= 0.013). The first patient had two major criteria (QTc 483 ms and a history of syncopal attack) and one minor criteron (congenital deafness); the second also had two major criteria (QTc 613 ms and family members with LQTS) and one minor criterion (congenital deafness). Prophylactic beta-blocker therapy was started in these two patients to prevent sudden death. In conclusion, this syndrome should be sought in children with syncope or a family history of it, especially those with congenital deafness.",

    "46": "Although there are numerous reports of antiarrhythmic use in children, very few large studies are designed to evaluate an individual antiarrhythmic agent for a specific arrhythmia. Controlled, comparison trials of antiarrhythmic agents in children are virtually nonexistent. Ideally, controlled clinical trials are used to develop clinical guidelines; however, in this situation, most data and information must be obtained from case series of children treated. Although the results from these type of studies may be useful in developing guidelines for the optimal use of these agents, controlled trials are required for establishing standard treatment guidelines for all patients.", 
    "47": "Despite limited scientific evaluation of conventional agents in the treatment of WPW and AVNRT in children, they continue to be used as standard of care. Most information regarding the use of conventional agents in children has been extrapolated from the adult literature. Little justification for the use of agents or dosing in children is available. Controlled trials regarding the use of new antiarrhythmic agents (propafenone, amiodarone, flecainide) are available; however, the variance in dosing schemes, presence of structural heart disease, and patient age make the development of recommendations difficult.", 
    "48": "Because of greater clinical experience with these conventional antiarrhythmic agents, they continue to be first-line therapy in the management of most supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) in children. The management of SVT in children with WPW syndrome should begin with the use of a beta-blocker with the addition of digoxin or procainamide for treatment failures. The use of digoxin monotherapy, although frequently used by many practitioners in infants and children with WPW, cannot be recommended. For failures to conventional agents, flecainide is the preferred agent, while therapy with propafenone, amiodarone, and sotalol remains to be elucidated. The management of AVRNT is similar to that of WPW; however, digoxin is the agent of first choice. Trials of beta-blockers and procainamide should follow for treatment failures with flecainide again being the preferred \"newer\" antiarrhythmic for use in resistant cases. Additional well-designed, controlled trials are needed to further evaluate the comparative efficacy of antiarrhythmics in the management of WPW and AVNRT in children, as well as to evaluate dosing and toxicity in various age groups.", 
    "49": "The vasodilator effect of beta-adrenergic agonists has traditionally been ascribed solely to a direct effect on vascular smooth muscle. Experimental studies, however, have suggested a role of endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO) in beta-adrenergic-mediated vasodilation. The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether NO contributes to the vasodilator effect of beta-adrenergic stimulation in humans. We analyzed the forearm blood flow response to increasing doses of isoproterenol (50, 100, and 200 ng/min), a beta-adrenoceptor agonist, during the concomitant infusion of saline or N(G)-monomethylL-arginine (L-NMMA; 4 micromol/min), a blocker of NO synthesis, in 23 normal subjects (9 men and 14 women, aged 48 +/- 7 years). The effect of L-NMMA was also assessed during infusion of sodium nitroprusside (0.8, 1.6, and 3.2 microg/min), an exogenous NO donor. Drugs were infused into the brachial artery, and forearm blood flow was measured by plethysmography. The vasodilator effect of isoproterenol was significantly blunted during the administration of L-NMMA compared with saline (maximum flow, 7.7 +/- 4 versus 11.2 +/- 5 mL x min(-1) x dL(-1), respectively; P<.001). In contrast, the vasodilator response to sodium nitroprusside was not significantly affected by the infusion of L-NMMA (maximum flow, 8.8 +/- 3.7 mL x min(-1) x dL(-1) during L-NMMA versus 8.9 +/- 3.2 mL x min(-1) x dL(-1) during saline; P=.25). These findings indicate that NO inhibition blunts the vasodilator effect of beta-adrenergic agonists in the human forearm and suggest that an abnormal response to adrenergic stimulation may occur in conditions associated with impaired NO activity.", 
    "50": "Beta-endorphin and naloxone bind to Jurkat cell membrane preparations and can mutually displace each other from membrane binding sites. Tetraethylammonium ion, a potassium channel blocker, competitively displaces beta-endorphin and naloxone from membrane binding sites. Mitogen stimulated calcium ion flux is inhibited by tetraethyl ammonium and this inhibition is relieved by naloxone. With data derived from whole cell calcium ion flux studies, we accurately calculated the competitive displacement of beta-endorphin and naloxone from membrane preparations by tetraethylammonium thus showing that the action of these agents on potassium channels does not require second messengers. Using the resuspension induced ion flux technique, we find that beta-endorphin competes against naloxone for binding to Jurkat cells and naloxone competes against charybdotoxin, a potassium channel inhibitor, which like tetraethylammonium, is known to bind to the outer vestibule of the channel. Patch clamp electrophysiological studies show that beta-endorphin and naloxone exert complex actions on potassium channels in the presence or absence of mitogens. We conclude that one molecule of beta-endorphin or naloxone, but not both at the same time, bind to an area near the charybdotoxin/tetraethylammonium binding locus of Jurkat potassium channels.", 
    "51": "1. In rat soleus muscle, high frequency electrical stimulation produced a rapid increase in intracellular Na+ (Na+i) content. This was considerably larger in muscles contracting without developing tension than in muscles contracting isometrically. During subsequent rest a net extrusion of Na+ took place at rates which, depending on the frequency and duration of stimulation, approached the maximum transport capacity of the Na(+)-K+ pumps present in the muscle. 2. In isometrically contracting muscles, the net extrusion of Na+ continued for up to 10 min after stimulation, reducing Na+i to values 30% below the resting level (P < 0.001). This undershoot in Na+i, seen in both soleus and extensor digitorum longus muscles, could be maintained for up to 30 min and was blocked by ouabain or cooling to 0 degree C. 3. The undershoot in Na+i could be elicited by direct stimulation as well as by tubocurarine-suppressible stimulation via the motor endplate. It could not be attributed to a decrease in Na+ influx, to effects of noradrenaline or calcitonin gene-related peptide released from nerve endings, to an increase in extracellular K+ or the formation of nitric oxide. 4. The results indicate that excitation rapidly activates the Na(+)-K+ pump, partly via a change in its transport characteristics and partly via an increase in intracellular Na+ concentration. This activation allows an approximately 20-fold increase in the rate of Na+ efflux to take place within 10 s. 5. The excitation-induced activation of the Na(+)-K+ pump may represent a feed-forward mechanism that protects the Na(+)-K+ gradients and the membrane potential in working muscle. Contrary to previous assumptions, the Na(+)-K+ pump seems to play a dynamic role in maintenance of excitability during contractile activity.", 
    "52": "To further evaluate the mechanism of beta-blocker-induced benefits in heart failure, the relationships between bisoprolol-induced hemodynamic effects and survival were studied during the Cardiac Insufficiency BIsoprolol Study (CIBIS).", 
    "53": "In 557 patients studied, bisoprolol significantly reduced heart rate (-16.3+/-15.3 versus -1.6+/-13.4 bpm, respectively; P<.001) compared with placebo at 2 months after inclusion in the study. Heart rate change over time had the highest predictive value for survival (P<.01). Left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS) significantly increased in the bisoprolol group compared with the placebo group 5 months after inclusion (+0.04+/-0.06 versus -0.001+/-0.05, respectively; P<.001; n=160). LVFS change over time was also significantly correlated with further survival (P<.02 by Cox analysis). Using a nonparametric approach, we demonstrated a significant interaction between study treatment group and LVFS over time. Patients who demonstrated improvement of LVFS over time (82% and 51% of patients in the bisoprolol and the placebo groups, respectively; P<.02) were at lower risk, but the hazard did not further decrease with a further increase of fractional shortening, and there was no significant difference between study treatment groups. Finally, it could be demonstrated that each of the three factors (heart rate change over time, LVFS change over time, and bisoprolol treatment) made a specific contribution to mortality rate.", 
    "54": "Preservation of left ventricular function appears to play a key role in the bisoprolol-induced beneficial effects on prognosis in heart failure. Short-term beta-blocker-induced cardiac effects could provide a means to identify those patients who will experience improved survival over the long term.", 
    "55": "Antihypertensive drugs have differing effects on renal hemodynamics and morphology. We analyzed whether the use of a new beta adrenoceptor antagonist and vasodilator, carvedilol (CVD), slows the progression of nephrosclerosis and whether the renoprotective effect as well as reduction in cardiac hypertrophy is dependent on the degree of blood pressure reduction. Fifty-four adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were distributed among five groups: group I served as untreated controls with 5/6 nephrectomy (Nx); group II, sham (no renal ablation or drug treatment); group III, CVD 5 (5/6 Nx and treatment with oral CVD at 5 mg/kg/day); group IV, CVD 10 (5/6 Nx and treatment with oral CVD at 10 mg/kg/day); and group V, CVD 20 (5/6 Nx and treatment with oral CVD at 20 mg/kg/day). Tail-cuff blood pressure and 24-hr urine samples were obtained before and at 3, 5 and 11 weeks of treatment with CVD. At the end of the study period, blood was taken to measure serum creatinine, plasma renin activity and CVD levels, as well as the remnant kidney and heart for morphological studies. There was a significant reduction in 24-hr U(ProtV) in all the CVD-treated groups, and it was increasingly evident with the highest dose used. However, only rats receiving doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg/day of CVD exhibited significant decreases in blood pressure. Elevated serum creatinine levels seen in untreated controls were significantly decreased by CVD in treated rats (P < .01), indicating that glomerular filtration rate was improved by this drug. This was associated with a significant increase in U(NaV). Concomitant and significant (P < .01) decreases in plasma renin activity were observed in sham and CVD-treated rats. CVD-treated animals had considerably reduced renal damage (P < .01) and cardiac hypertrophy (P < .01) compared with untreated controls. These data indicate that CVD is effective in delaying progression of renal damage and provides beneficial effects in the remnant kidney and cardiac hypertrophy, even at nonhypotensive doses.", 
    "56": "Indapamide is a diuretic agent with direct electrophysiological effects on ionic currents involved in cardiac repolarization. In particular, indapamide blocks the slow component of delayed rectifier potassium current. In contrast, most class III antiarrhythmic agents, such as dl-sotalol, block the rapid component of delayed rectifier potassium current. Computer simulations have suggested potentiation of drug effects on cardiac repolarization by the combined block of the rapid component of delayed rectifier potassium current and the slow component of delayed rectifier potassium current. Therefore, the objective of our study was to evaluate the modulation of cardiac electrophysiological effects of dl-sotalol by indapamide. Two indices of cardiac repolarization, monophasic action potential duration at 90% repolarization and effective refractory period, at two basic cycle lengths (800 and 400 msec) were determined in 24 anesthetized open-chest dogs. In two treatment groups (n = 6/group), data were obtained at base line and every 2 min during steadily increasing concentrations of dl-sotalol (0-40 microg/ml) either alone or in the presence of indapamide (500 ng/ml). Data were also obtained in dogs receiving either a low-dose (500 ng/ml) or a high-dose (up to 7.5 microg/ml) infusion regimen of indapamide alone. Administration of dl-sotalol was associated with concentration-dependent increases in monophasic action potential duration at 90% repolarization and effective refractory period, whereas repolarization was only slightly altered by the administration of indapamide alone. However, concentration-response curves of dl-sotalol were shifted to the left in dogs treated with the combination of dl-sotalol and indapamide, and the EC50 values of dl-sotalol estimated for the prolongation of monophasic action potential duration at 90% repolarization and effective refractory period were decreased 3-fold during the coadministration of both drugs (P < .05 vs. dl-sotalol alone). Thus, under conditions of normal K+ levels, clinically relevant concentrations of indapamide modulate dl-sotalol effects on cardiac repolarization. Additional block of cardiac K+ currents, especially the rapid component of delayed rectifier potassium current and the slow component of delayed rectifier potassium current could explain these observations.", 
    "57": "When propafenone is given with digoxin, digoxin serum concentrations increase. Although the digoxin-propafenone interaction is well known clinically, the mechanism by which propafenone interferes with digoxin elimination is unclear. To test the hypothesis that propafenone or one or both of its two major metabolites, 5-hydroxypropafenone (5-OHP) and N-depropylpropafenone (NDPP), inhibit the P-glycoprotein-mediated net renal tubular secretion of digoxin, we examined the transport of digoxin and the well-studied P-glycoprotein substrate vinblastine across confluent Madin-Darby canine kidney cell monolayers in the absence and presence of propafenone, 5-OHP and NDPP. Propafenone and its two major metabolites significantly inhibit the secretory flux of digoxin and vinblastine (propafenone > 5-OHP > NDPP). Despite decreases in net transport, cellular digoxin accumulation did not decrease, suggesting that neither propafenone nor its metabolites prohibited digoxin from entering the cells at the basolateral side. NDPP, but not 5-OHP, was detected after 48 hr of incubation of the cells with propafenone alone. When the cells were incubated with propafenone or 5-OHP, apical accumulation of 5-OHP, but neither propafenone nor NDPP, against a concentration gradient was observed. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the digoxin-propafenone interaction results from the inhibition of the renal tubular transport of digoxin by propafenone and its metabolites. Our data suggest that propafenone is an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein, whereas 5-OHP is a possible substrate.", 
    "58": "Neuroleptic-induced defecation in rats in a well-habituated environment has been proposed as a model of the subjective component of akathisia. In this study, we examined the effects of two lipophilic beta-adrenoceptor antagonists - the non-selective drug propranolol and the relatively beta1-selective metoprolol - and one non-selective hydrophilic drug nadolol in this model. Young male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to one of eight groups (n = 12 in each group) and treated with haloperidol or vehicle, with or without one of the beta-antagonists. Haloperidol-treated rats had higher bolus counts than vehicle-treated rats, and this increase was significantly reversed by the lipophilic but not the hydrophilic beta-antagonists. This finding is consistent with the reported anti-akathisia effects of these drugs in humans, suggesting that this effect is central in origin and achievable with relatively selective beta1-antagonism. The B-antagonist drugs significantly reduced the cataleptic effect of haloperidol and this effect warrants further examination.", 
    "59": "Experiments were carried out using rats to investigate whether 5-HT1A neural mechanisms are involved in lithium-induced conditioned taste aversion (CTA). We found that the 5-HT1A antagonists p-MPPI and pindolol caused CTA similar to that produced by LiCl. The 5-HT1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT counteracted lithium-induced CTA. Pindolol dose-dependently abolished effects of 8-OH-DPAT on LiCl-induced CTA. These findings support the notion that lithium has antagonistic actions on 5-HT1A receptors. Inhibition of 5-HT synthesis by PCPA failed, however, to prevent lithium-induced CTA. Evidently, mechanisms other than those governed solely by 5-HT are also involved in lithium-induced CTA.", 
    "60": "In the present study, effect of cholecystokinin (CCK) agonists and on dependence to morphine in mice has been investigated. The influence of dopaminergic, adrenergic, cholinergic and serotonergic on attenuation of naloxone-induced jumping in morphine-dependent mice by CCK agonists were also considered. Mice were treated subcutaneously with morphine (50, 50 and 75 mg/kg) three times daily (10 a.m. 1 p.m. and 4 p.m.) for 3 days, and a last dose of morphine (50 mg/kg) was administered on the 4th day. Withdrawal syndrome (jumping) was precipitated by naloxone (5 mg/kg) which was administered intraperitoneally 2 hr after the last dose of morphine. To study effects of CCK receptor agonists, 10 injection of morphine (3 administrations each day) for dependence and a dose of 5 mg/kg of naloxone for withdrawal induction were employed. The CCK agonists CCK-8 (0.001-0.1 mg/kg), unsulfated CCK-8 (CCK-8U; 0.001-0.1 mg/kg) and caerulein (0.00001-0.01 mg/kg) were able to prevent withdrawal signs precipitated by naloxone (5 mg/kg). Sulpiride and pimozide increased response induced by CCK-8 agonists. The dopamine antagonists also attenuates jumping by themselves. SCH 23390 did not alter the CCK-8 effect, but decreased the jumping by itself. Phenoxybenzamine, propranolol, methysergide and atropine did not change the caerulein effect significantly. However, single administration of atropine increased and methysergide decreased jumping. It is concluded that CCK mechanism(s) may be involved in morphine dependence, and dopaminergic mechanism(s) may interact with CCK in attenuation of naloxone-induced jumping.", 
    "61": "The present study was undertaken in anaesthetised pigs to determine the primary reflex effects of distension of the uterus on the peripheral circulation. Experiments were performed in seven pigs anaesthetised with alpha-chloralose and artificially ventilated. Blood flow in the superior mesenteric, left renal and left external iliac arteries was assessed using electromagnetic flowmeters. Distension of the uterus was performed whilst preventing changes in heart rate and aortic blood pressure by injecting 20 ml of warm Ringer solution in a balloon positioned within the viscus (mean transmural pressure of about 18 mmHg). In each pig, distension of the uterus caused decreases in all measured blood flows. In four pigs, these decreases were graded by step increments of distension. In the seven pigs, the responses of decrease in mesenteric, renal and iliac blood flows were not affected by blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors with propranolol, but were abolished by the subsequent blockade of alpha-adrenergic receptors with phentolamine. The present study showed that distension of the uterus in anaesthetised pigs primarily caused reflex vasoconstriction in the mesenteric, renal and iliac vascular beds. This reflex response was mediated by sympathetic mechanisms which involved alpha vascular adrenergic receptors.", 
    "62": "We provided direct evidence for the existence of purinergic innervation in the rat urinary bladder.", 
    "63": "The non-adrenergic non-cholinergic (NANC) innervation was studied in 4-month-old Wistar rats. Electric-field stimulation (EFS) of the detrusor muscle strips in the presence of four autonomic blockers (atropine 10(-6) M, guanethidine 10(-6) M, phentolamine 10(-6) M and propranolol 10(-6) M) showed NANC contractions accounted for about 50% of the maximum contractile response. The adenyl purines released from nerves by EFS were detected by HPLC after conversion to ethenopurines. The amount of total purine released was frequency-dependent and could be totally suppressed by tetradotoxin (10(-6) M). The amount of ATP released was significantly greater than those for ADP, AMP and adenosine (p < 0.05, n = 4). Desensitization induced by alpha, beta-MeATP (10(-6) to 10(-4) M), a P2x receptor agonist, reduced the NANC contraction. In addition, the NANC contraction was also abolished by P2 receptor blocker suramin (10(-4) to 10(-3) M) and P2x receptor blocker PPADS (10(-5) to 10(-4) M.).", 
    "64": "The results of the present study give evidence to support purinergic nerve-mediated bladder smooth muscle contractions in the rat. Among the purine nucleotides, ATP is the dominant purinergic neurotransmitter released and P2x receptor activation is responsible for the NANC contractile response.", 
    "65": "We evaluated the opioid antinociceptive mechanism of the calcium channel blocker flunarizine. Flunarizine produced a dose-dependent analgesia in the hot plate test which was antagonized by general (naloxone) and mu [beta-fualtrexamine (beta-FNA)]-opioid antagonists, indicating a role for mu receptors in flunarizine analgesia. Naltrindole (delta1 antagonist) did not affect flunarizine analgesia. A fixed subthreshold dose of flunarizine augmented mu (morphine) analgesia and blocked delta1 [enkephalin, [D-Pen2,5] (DPDPE)] analgesia. Apparently, flunarizine has mu agonistic activity and delta1 antagonist or mixed agonistic-antagonistic activity.", 
    "66": "We analyzed the uptake of RU 64004 by human neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes [PMNs]) relative to those of azithromycin and roxithromycin. RU 64004 was strongly and rapidly accumulated by PMNs, with a cellular concentration/extracellular concentration ratio (C/E) of greater than 200 in the first 5 min, and this was followed by a plateau at 120 to 180 min, with a C/E of 461 +/- 14.8 (10 experiments) at 180 min. RU 64004 uptake was moderately sensitive to external pH, and activation energy was also moderate (63 +/- 3.8 kJ/mol). RU 64004 was mainly located in PMN granules (about 70%) and egressed slowly from loaded cells, owing to avid reuptake. The possibility that PMN uptake of RU 64004 and other macrolides occurs through a carrier-mediated system was suggested by three key results. First, there existed a strong interindividual variability in uptake kinetics, suggesting variability in the numbers or activity of a transport protein. Second, macrolide uptake displayed saturation kinetics characteristic of that of a carrier-mediated transport system: RU 64004 had the highest Vmax value (3,846 ng/2.5 x 10(6) PMNs/5 min) and the lowest Km value (about 28 microM), indicating a high affinity for the transporter. Third, as observed previously with other erythromycin A derivatives, Ni2+ (a blocker of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger which mediates Ca2+ influx in resting neutrophils) impaired RU 64004 uptake by PMNs, with a 50% inhibitory concentration of about 3.5 mM. In addition, we found that an active process is also involved in macrolide efflux, because verapamil significantly potentiated the release of all three macrolides tested. This effect of verapamil does not seem to be related to an inhibition of Ca2+ influx, because neither EGTA [ethylene glycol-bis (beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid] nor Ni2+ modified macrolide efflux. The nature and characteristics of the entry- and efflux-mediating carrier systems are under investigation.", 
    "67": "Phasically active neurosecretory neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of urethane-anesthetized rats displayed orthodromic excitation, inhibition or no response following electrical stimulation of the anteroventral third ventricle (AV3V) region, and exhibited orthodromic excitation or no response following electrical stimulation of the A1 noradrenergic region of the ventrolateral medulla. Of the 14 neurons that responded to both the stimuli, A1 region stimulation at the subthreshold current significantly enhanced the excitation induced by AV3V region stimulation, and the enhancement was abolished by iontophoretically applied phentolamine, an alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist, but not by timolol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist. These results suggest that A1 noradrenergic projections may act to potentiate the excitatory inputs from the AV3V region to vasopressinergic PVN neurons through alpha-adrenoceptor mechanisms.", 
    "68": "We have previously shown that hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), one form of synaptic plasticity that may underlie learning and memory, is attenuated by blocking neuron activity of the basolateral amygdala (BLA). In the present study we investigated the amygdala noradrenergic or cholinergic contribution to hippocampal LTP formation. When propranolol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, was injected into the BLA 10 min before tetanus, the formation of LTP in the perforant path-dentate granule cell synapses was significantly impaired. Scopolamine, a muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist, did not affect the formation of LTP. These results suggest that amygdala beta-noradrenergic activity plays a critical role in modulation of hippocampal LTP.", 
    "69": "We conducted this study to investigate the mechanisms of action of growth hormone-releasing peptide-2 (D-Ala-D-beta Nal-Ala-Trp-D-Phe-Lys-NH2; GHRP-2) in bovine anterior pituitary primary cell culture. Doses of GHRP-2 from 10(-13) to 10(-7) M) increased (P < .05) GH secretion. The GHRP-2 (10(-7) M) and GH-releasing factor (GRF; 10(-7) M) administered together had an additive effect on the release of GH (P < .05). Somatostatin (1 microM) decreased GH secretion in response to GHRP-2 and(or) GRF (P < .05). Secretion of GH in response to GHRP-2 was blocked (P < .01) by a GRF receptor antagonist (.1 microM). Nifedipine (10 microM), a voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel blocker, inhibited (P < .01) GHRP-2-stimulated GH release. The GH release in response to GHRP-2 and 4 beta-phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (10(-7) M), a protein kinase C activator, was additive (P < .01). Forskolin (30 microM), a cAMP elevating agent, further stimulated (P < .01) the GH release in response to GHRP-2. Bovine GH concentrations in culture media were assayed by indirect competitive enzyme immunoassay. These results showed that GHRP-2 1) stimulates GH secretion from bovine pituitary cells, 2) may partially act via GRF receptor, 3) has GH secretion activity caused by Ca2+ influx via Ca2+ channels, and 4) may increase GH secretion via protein kinase C and cAMP pathways.", 
    "70": "The effects of enalaprilate on duodenal mucosal alkaline secretion (in situ titration) and mean arterial blood pressure were investigated in chloralose-anesthetized male rats. A bolus injection of enalaprilate (0.7 mg/kg intravenously) increased alkaline secretion by about 60%, and this response was resistant to guanethidine (5 mg/kg intravenously), splanchnicotomy, and vagotomy. Furthermore, angiotensin II infusion (0.25-2.5 microg/kg/hr intravenously) following the administration of enalaprilate failed to influence this response. Bradykinin (10(-6)-10(-4) M) applied topically to the serosal surface of the duodenal segment under study increased dose-dependently the duodenal mucosal alkaline secretion, an effect that could be blocked by the selective bradykinin receptor subtype-2 antagonist HOE140 (100 nmol/kg intravenously). HOE140 also antagonized the response to enalaprilate. These data suggest that enalaprilate increases duodenal mucosal alkaline secretion via a local bradykinin pathway involving receptors of the bradykinin receptor subtype-2 antagonist, rather than by blockade of endogenous angiotensin II or by central autonomic neural regulation.", 
    "71": "Many patients remain markedly symptomatic despite optimal current therapy for heart failure. Beta-blockers have often been viewed as contraindicated in this group because of their potential adverse short-term effects on cardiac function.", 
    "72": "One hundred thirty-one patients with severe congestive heart failure were enrolled into a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the vasodilating beta-blocker carvedilol. All patients had symptomatic, advanced heart failure while on standard triple therapy, as evidenced by a mean ejection fraction of 0.22, marked reduction in distance traveled in a 6-minute corridor walk test, and severe impairment in quality of life measured by the Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire. After a 2-week, open-label test of 6.25 mg twice daily carvedilol, 105 patients were randomized (2:1) to receive either carvedilol (up to 25 mg twice daily, n = 70) or matching placebo (n = 35) for 6 months while background therapy with digoxin, diuretics, and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor remained constant. Ten patients (8%) did not complete the open-label period because of adverse events and 11.4% in both the carvedilol and placebo groups dropped out in the double-blind phase. The study was terminated early by the Data Safety and Monitoring Board and follow-up evaluation was therefore aborted before the projected number of patients and follow-up time was achieved. Quality of life, which was the primary endpoint, improved similarly in the carvedilol and placebo groups, whereas the global assessment by the physicians and the patient exhibited a better response to carvedilol (P < .05). Hospitalization and mortality rate were too low to evaluate a difference, and exercise time and New York Heart Association classification did not change significantly in response to the drug. Left ventricular ejection fraction rose significantly (+0.09) in the carvedilol group compared with the placebo group (+0.02, P = .004).", 
    "73": "The beta-blocker carvedilol can be safely employed in patients with severe heart failure. Improved left ventricular function with a trend for some improvement in symptoms combined with the experience with the drug in the larger population of less severe patients in this multicenter trial suggests that carvedilol may have a favorable long-term effect in heart failure of diverse severity.", 
    "74": "Perforant path long-term potentiation (LTP) in intact mouse hippocampal dentate gyrus increased the neuron-specific, growth-associated protein GAP-43 mRNA in hilar cells 3 days after tetanus, but surprisingly not in granule cells, the perforant path target. This increase was positively correlated with level of enhancement and restricted to central hilar cells on the side of stimulation. Blockade of LTP by puffing DL-aminophosphonovalerate (APV), an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blocker into the molecular layer, eliminated LTP-induced GAP-43 mRNA elevation in hilar cells. To determine whether the mRNA elevation was mediated by transcription, LTP was studied in transgenic mice bearing a GAP-43 promoter-lacZ reporter gene. Promoter activity as indexed by Transgene expression (PATE) increased as indicated by blue staining of the lacZ gene product, beta-galactosidase. Potentiation induced a blue band bilaterally in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus along the entire septotemporal axis. Because mossy cells are the only neurons in the central hilar zone that project to the inner molecular layer bilaterally along the entire septotemporal axis and LTP-induced activation of PATE in this zone was confined to the side of stimulation, we concluded that mossy cells were unilaterally activated, increasing synthesis of beta-galactosidase, which was transported bilaterally. Neither granule cells nor pyramidal cells demonstrated increased PATE or increased GAP-43 mRNA levels.

    "76": "A transmural ECG and transmembrane action potentials from epicardial, M, and endocardial or Purkinje cells were simultaneously recorded in an arterially perfused wedge of canine left ventricle. d-Sotalol was used to mimic LQT2, whereas ATX-II mimicked LQT3. d-Sotalol caused a preferential prolongation of the M cell action potential duration (APD90, 291+/-14 to 354+/-35 ms), giving rise to broad and sometimes low-amplitude bifurcated T waves and an increased transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR, 51+/-15 to 72+/-17 ms). QT interval increased from 320+/-13 to 385+/-37 ms. ATX-II produced a preferential prolongation of the M cell APD90 (280+/-25 to 609+/-49 ms) and caused a marked delay in the onset of the T wave and a sharp rise in TDR (40+/-5 to 168+/-40 ms). QT-, APD90-, and dispersion-rate relations were much steeper in the ATX-II than in the d-sotalol model. Mexiletine (2 to 20 micromol/L) dose-dependently abbreviated the QT interval and APD90 of all cell types, more in the ATX-II than in the d-sotalol model, but decreased TDR equally in the two models. Mexiletine 2 to 5 micromol/L totally suppressed spontaneous torsade de pointes (TdP) and reduced the vulnerable window during which single extrastimuli could induce TdP in both models. Higher concentrations of mexiletine (10 to 20 micromol/L) totally suppressed stimulation-induced TdP.", 
    "77": "Our results suggest that although pacing and sodium channel block are very effective in abbreviating the QT interval and TDR in LQT3, these therapeutic approaches may also be valuable in reducing the incidence of arrhythmogenesis in LQT2.", 
    "78": "The ventricular myocardium contains functional beta2-adrenergic receptors that when activated increase intracellular Ca2+ transients. Because elevated Ca2+ has been implicated in the induction of ventricular fibrillation (VF), it is possible that the activation of these receptors may also provoke malignant arrhythmias.", 
    "79": "To test this hypothesis, a 2-minute occlusion of the left circumflex coronary artery was made during the last minute of exercise in 28 dogs with healed anterior myocardial infarctions: 17 had VF (susceptible) and 11 did not (resistant). On a subsequent day, this test was repeated after administration of the beta2-adrenergic receptor antagonist ICI 118,551 (0.2 mg/kg). This drug did not alter the hemodynamic response to the coronary occlusion, yet it prevented VF in 10 of 11 animals tested (P<.001). However, heart rate was reduced in 6 animals. Therefore, the ICI 118,551 exercise-plus-ischemia test was repeated with heart rate held constant by ventricular pacing (n=3). ICI 118,551 still prevented VF when heart rate was maintained. Next, the effects of increasing doses of the beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist zinterol on Ca2+ transient amplitudes were examined in ventricular myocytes. Zinterol elicited significantly greater increases in Ca2+ transient amplitudes at all doses tested (10(-9) to 10(-6) mol/L) in myocytes prepared from susceptible versus resistant animals. The cardiomyocyte response to isoproterenol (10(-7) mol/L) in the presence or absence of the selective beta1- (CGP-20712A, 300 nmol/L) or beta2- (ICI 118,551, 100 nmol/L) adrenergic receptor antagonist was also examined. Isoproterenol elicited larger Ca2+ transient increases in the susceptible myocytes, which were eliminated by ICI but not by CGP.", 
    "80": "When considered together, these data demonstrate that canine myocytes contain functional beta2-adrenergic receptors that are activated to a greater extent in the susceptible animals. The resulting cytosolic Ca2+ transient increases may lead to afterpotentials that ultimately trigger VF in these animals.", 
    "81": "The present study examines the hypothesis that the hormones have direct vasodilatory effects and attempts to determine whether the effects are endothelium-dependent. Rat skeletal muscle resistance arteries of approximately 100 microns were dissected, and vessel diameter changes were monitored using a videodetection system. After equilibration at 37 degrees C, each vessel was preconstricted with the thromboxane analog U46619 1 microM, and the percentage of dilation was measured after exposure to increasing concentrations of triiodothyronine (T3) or levothyroxine (T4) (10(-10) to 10(-7) M). Dilation in response to T3 was also measured after endothelial denudation and pretreatment with the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA) 10 microM, the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin 10 microM, the adenosine triphosphate-sensitive K+ channel blocker glibenclamide 1 microM, or the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol 1 microM. Both T3 and T4 demonstrated concentration-dependent dilation of the U46619-preconstricted vessels (P < 0.001 each), with T3 having a greater effect than T4 (P < 0.05) (36% +/- 9% [mean +/- SD] dilation at 10(-7) M T3 vs 24% +/- 6% dilation at 10(-7) M T4). In comparison, isoproterenol 10(-7) M produced 56% +/- 6% dilation. T3-mediated vasodilation was attenuated but not abolished by endothelial denudation (18% +/- 3% dilation at 10(-7) M T3) (P < 0.01), L-NNA (15% +/- 7% dilation at 10(-7) M T3) (P < 0.01), indomethacin (20% +/- 9% dilation at 10(-7) M T3) (P < 0.05), and glibenclamide (22% +/- 7% dilation at 10(-7) M T3) (P < 0.01), but it was not affected by propranolol (37% +/- 20% dilation at 10(-7) M T3) (P = 0.99). We conclude that thyroid hormones possess direct vasodilatory effects with both endothelium-independent and endothelium-dependent components.", 
    "82": "Thyroid hormones may have modest direct vasodilatory effects. This may partially account for the cardiovascular actions of the hormones in hyperthyroidism or when administered pharmacologically in cardiac surgery.", 
    "83": "Two studies were performed to determine whether the attenuation of baroreflex control of heart rate during late pregnancy in conscious rabbits is due to changes in parasympathetic (Para) or sympathetic (Sym) control of the heart. In the first, baroreflex relationships between arterial pressure and heart rate were generated before and after treatment with propranolol (Pro) to block Sym or with methscopolamine (Meth) to block Para. Each rabbit was studied in both the pregnant and nonpregnant state. Pregnancy decreased maximum baroreflex gain from 14.9 +/- 4.0 to 4.8 +/- 0.9 beats.min-1.mmHg-1 (P < 0.01) and decreased heart rate range from 177 +/- 6 to 143 +/- 10 beats/min (P < 0.01), primarily by increasing minimum heart rate (114 +/- 6 to 134 +/- 8 beats/min; P < 0.01). The difference between pregnant and nonpregnant rabbits in baroreflex gain was not altered by Meth but was abolished by Pro, suggesting that it is due to decreased Sym control of the heart. The elevated minimum heart rate of pregnancy persisted after Pro, but was abolished by Meth, suggesting that it is mediated by decreased Para control of the heart. In the second study, isolated buffer-perfused hearts from pregnant and nonpregnant rabbits were treated with increasing doses of isoproterenol (0.3-300 mM) or acetylcholine (0.3-10,000 microM), and the heart rate responses were determined. Hearts from pregnant rabbits were more sensitive to isoproterenol (P < 0.05), but less responsive to acetylcholine (P < 0.05). In conclusion, pregnancy-induced decreases in cardiac reflex gain and range appear to be mediated by alterations in Sym and Para, respectively. The change in Sym occurs proximal to the heart, whereas the decreased contribution of Para may be due, at least in part, to decreased sensitivity of the heart to acetylcholine.", 
    "84": "Autonomic and sensory nerves frequently contact mast cells contained in rabbit leptomeningeal arteries. We have previously shown that parasympathetic and peptidergic neurotransmitters can stimulate mast cell granule exocytosis and serotonin (5-HT) release. In the present study, we examined ex vivo the possible action of the main sympathetic neurotransmitter, norepinephrine (NE), on this exocytotic process. NE, which had no effect on mast cell 5-HT content per se, totally inhibited carbachol-induced 5-HT release and partially reduced neuropeptide-induced 5-HT release. Pretreatment with the alpha 1-adrenergic blocker did not affect the inhibitory effect of NE. Pretreatment with specific beta 1- or beta 2-adrenergic blockers antagonized this action, but the beta 2-blocker exerts a more specific dose-dependent antagonism. Together with our previous data, these results indicate that the equilibrium between autonomic and sensory nerves may determine the release of 5-HT from mast cells (parasympathetic and sensory nerves can trigger exocytosis while the sympathetics can inhibit it). Such a mechanism could be implicated in pathophysiological events in which autonomic dysfunction is likely to be involved, such as vascular headache or other phenomena involving inflammation.", 
    "85": "Recent studies have shown that beta 2-adrenergic receptor (beta 2-AR)-stimulated increases in the intracellular Ca2+ (Cai) transient and contraction in cardiac myocytes are dissociated from the increase in adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) level and are not accompanied by an increase in phospholamban phosphorylation, an acceleration in relaxation, or a reduction in myofilament Ca2+ response. Thus we hypothesized that the beta 2-AR modulation of cardiac excitation-contraction (EC) coupling may be mediated by either a cAMP-independent mechanism or a compartmentalized cAMP pathway. To directly distinguish between these two possibilities, the responses of the L-type Ca2+ current (ICa), Cai transient, and contraction to beta 2-AR as well as to beta 1-AR stimulation were examined in rat ventricular myocytes in the presence or absence of specific inhibitory cAMP analogs, Rp diastereomers of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphothioate (Rp-cAMPS) and 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP (Rp-CPT-cAMPS). As expected, the positive inotropic effect induced by an adenylyl cyclase activator, forskolin (2 x 10(-7) M), or a beta 1-AR agonist, norepinephrine (5 x 10(-8) M) plus prazosin (10(-6) M), was completely blocked by Rp-CPT-cAMPS. More importantly, the responses of ICa, Cai transient, and contraction to beta 2-AR stimulation by zinterol (10(-5) M) or isoproterenol plus a selective beta 1-AR antagonist, CGP-20712A, were also entirely abolished by Rp-cAMPS (in the patch-pipette solution) or Rp-CPT-cAMPS (in the bath solution). In pertussis toxin-treated cells, although the response of cAMP was not altered, the beta 2-AR-stimulated increase in contraction amplitude was markedly enhanced and accompanied by a hastened relaxation, resulting in a tight association between cAMP and contraction. These results indicate that beta 2-AR modulation of cardiac excitation-contraction coupling requires cAMP. The dissociation of beta 2-AR-stimulated cAMP production and regulation of myofilament and sarcoplasmic reticulum functions is attributable to a functional compartmentation of the cAMP-dependent signaling due to an activation of beta 2-AR-coupled Gi and/or G(o).", 
    "86": "Oxygen-derived free radicals (ODFR) contribute to delayed recovery of myocardial function after brief ischemia. We examined the effect of ODFR scavengers on ischemia-induced dysfunction of cardiac sympathetic nerves. Mongrel dogs were anesthetized and instrumented for recording heart rate, arterial pressure, systolic wall thickening, and left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) and left circumflex coronary artery (LCX) flow velocities. Bilateral stellate stimulation was performed, measuring changes in an index of coronary vascular resistance (% delta CVR) before and after 15 min of LAD occlusion. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were infused intravenously for 30 min beginning 10 min before occlusion. With vehicle (n = 13), % delta CVR was significantly attenuated in LAD after ischemia and 30-min reperfusion [39 +/- 3 to 13 +/- 2%, P < 0.05; for LCX, 42 +/- 4 to 45 +/- 7%, P = not significant (NS)]; however, no attenuation was seen in dogs in which SOD and CAT were infused (n = 10; for LAD, 39 +/- 5 to 41 +/- 5%; for LCX, 46 +/- 7 to 47 +/- 6%; P = NS). Baseline and stimulated changes in hemodynamics were similar between groups. The % delta CVR in the LCX (control) bed was not affected by SOD and CAT. Recovery of myocardial function (percent of baseline) was greater in SOD and CAT after reperfusion (26 +/- 16% vs. -30 +/- 11% at 90 min of reperfusion, P < 0.05). We conclude that ODFR contribute not only to myocardial stunning but also to neural stunning of sympathetic cardiac innervation after brief ischemia.", 
    "87": "Cardiac preparations from the right ventricular wall of rats were exposed to ATP-containing solutions of different Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]) and Ca2+ buffering capacity to determine whether such treatments affected the Ca2+ handling properties of the cardiac muscle. Exposure to 8 mM extracellular ATP (ATP0) elicited sustained, near-maximal contractures that were due to Ca2+ entry from the extracellular environment and severely diminished cardiac excitability in a partially reversible manner. At 1 mM ATP0, there was a sustained rise in diastolic force and intracellular [Ca2+] and a marked, partially reversible change in the stimulation-induced Ca2+ transients measured with fura 2. A large, transient contracture was also observed when the intact ventricular preparations were transferred from the normal physiological solution to an ATP-containing (8 mM) relaxing solution (ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid < or = 0.2 mM, < 10 nM Ca2+) with or without saponin (50 micrograms/ml). The ATP0-induced contractures were dependent on the prevalent conditions with respect to [Ca2+] and Ca2+ buffering capacity of the solutions and were associated with heavy Ca2+ loading of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and mitochondria, a less leaky SR, and a reduced SR sensitivity to the SR Ca2+ pump blocker 2,5-di-tert-butyl hydroquinone. The results indicate that the Ca2+ handling properties and the electrical excitability of ventricular preparations can be markedly modified by exposure to ATP0 and that conditions prevalent during skinning with saponin are important in determining the properties of the intracellular Ca2+ stores.", 
    "88": "Bradycardia is one of the inevitable and undesirable responses when the muscle weakness induced by nondepolarizing muscle relaxants is reversed by AChE inhibitors. The current study was designed to compare the bradycardiac effects of the two AChE inhibitors used widely in clinical anesthesia, neostigmine and edrophonium. Isolated, spontaneously beating guinea pig right atrial preparations were used as the experimental model, and in some cases, electrical field stimulation was utilized to stimulate parasympathetic nerve terminals within the atria. Neostigmine decreased the spontaneously beating rate in a concentration-dependent manner at concentrations up to 10 microM. At higher concentrations, the agent restored the beating rate to the predrug control level. Atropine abolished the biphasic response of the atrium to neostigmine. In contrast, edrophonium had no effect on the spontaneous beating rate. However, edrophonium (3 microM) potentiated the field stimulation-induced negative chronotropic effect. Tetrodotoxin did not inhibit the chronotropic effect of neostigmine. Both neostigmine and edrophonium at higher concentrations inhibited the negative chronotropic effect of carbachol. In conclusion, neostigmine possesses potential dual effects on cardiac muscarinic ACh receptors. Low concentrations of neostigmine may stimulate the receptors directly, and at higher concentrations neostigmine may act as an antimuscarinic agent. On the other hand, edrophonium may inhibit the cardiac muscarinic ACh receptors exclusively without stimulating the receptors. These results could at least partially explain the difference between the bradycardiac effects of the agents observed clinically.", 
    "89": "We investigated the mechanisms underlying bradykinin (BK)-induced rise in intracellular Ca++ concentration [Ca++]i and insulin secretion using clonal beta cell line RINm5F. Incubation with a range of concentrations of BK increased in concentration-dependent manners both insulin secretion (BK of 10 nM to 10 microM) and [Ca++]i (BK of 100 nM to 100 microM). In Ca++-containing medium, BK (1 microM) induced a biphasic [Ca++]i rise, which was characterized by a Ca++ peak and a sustained Ca++ phase. In the Ca++-free medium, BK failed to increase insulin secretion and induced only a Ca++ peak without the sustained Ca++ phase. Thapsigargin (1 microM), an inhibitor of the Ca++ pump in the endoplasmic reticulum, abolished the Ca++ peak and the sustained phase. Nimodipine (1 microM), a voltage-dependent Ca++ channel blocker, abolished the BK-induced sustained Ca++ phase and inhibited BK-induced insulin release. The BK1 receptor agonist des-Arg9-BK (1 microM) did not change either [Ca++]i or insulin secretion. Both the BK-induced insulin secretion and rise in [Ca++]i were inhibited by a selective BK2 receptor antagonist, HOE 140 (3.3-100 nM), in concentration-dependent manners but were not by a BK1 receptor antagonist des-Arg9,Leu8-BK (1 microM). Pretreatment with pertussis toxin (0.1 microg/ml) did not block the BK-induced insulin secretion or increase in [Ca++]i. U-73122 (4, 6 and 8 microM), a phospholipase C inhibitor, antagonized both the BK-induced insulin secretion and the increase in [Ca++]i in a concentration-dependent and parallel manner. BK increased intracellular concentrations of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). Neither (p-amylcinnamoyl)anthranilic acid (100 microM), a phospholipase A2 inhibitor, nor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methylester (100 microM), a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, inhibited these effects of BK. Taken together, these findings suggested that in beta cells, BK activates BK2 receptors, which, in turn, activate a pertussis toxin-insensitive G protein. The G protein couples to phospholipase C, which promotes the formation of IP3 and diacylglycerol. IP3 releases [Ca++]i from the intracellular Ca++ store, probably the endoplasmic reticulum, which triggers Ca++ influx via voltage-dependent Ca++ channels and thus increases insulin secretion.", 
    "90": "We investigated whether or not beta and alpha adrenergic agonists could affect proliferation of adult rat hepatocytes induced by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) during the early and late phases of primary culture. Adult rat hepatocytes underwent significant DNA synthesis after culture with 5 ng/ml HGF for 3 h at a low cell density (3.3 x 10(4) cells/cm2). Under these culture conditions, the number of nuclei increased significantly during a subsequent 4-h culture period. Hepatocyte DNA synthesis and proliferation induced by 5 ng/ml HGF was reduced at high cell densities near confluence. A beta adrenergic agonist, metaproterenol (10(-7) M), and dibutyryl cAMP significantly potentiated hepatocyte DNA synthesis and proliferation at a concentration as low as 10(-7) M when cultured in combination with 5 ng/ml HGF. Similarly, an alpha-1 adrenergic agonist, phenylephrine (10(-6)-10(-4) M) markedly potentiated HGF-induced hepatocyte DNA synthesis and proliferation. The phenylephrine effect was mimicked by a phorbol ester (10(-6) M), but not by ionomycin (10(-6) M). The mitogenic effects of HGF were almost completely blocked by simultaneous treatment of hepatocytes with genistein (5 x 10(-6) M), U-73122 (10(-6) M), wortmannin (10(-7) M), sphingosine (3 x 10(-6) M) and rapamycin (10 ng/ml). These results demonstrate that HGF can rapidly induce proliferation of adult rat hepatocytes in primary culture. However, this effect is dependent on the initial plating density. The co-mitogenic effects of metaproterenol and phenylephrine may involve both protein kinase A and protein kinase C activation, respectively. The results also suggest that following stimulation with HGF, activation of tyrosine kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, phospholipase C and p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase is essential for hepatocyte proliferation.",

Restoration of the number of down-regulated beta-adrenoceptors has been suggested to be one mechanism of beta-blocker effectiveness. However, the reversal of postreceptor events, namely, an increase in inhibitory G-protein alpha-subunit concentrations, could also play a role.", 
    "93": "Fifteen patients with heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy (left ventricular ejection fraction 24.6 +/- 1.5% [mean +/- SD], New York Heart Association functional class II or III) were treated with metoprolol (maximal dose 50 mg three times daily) for 6 months. Before and after metoprolol treatment, inotropic responses to milrinone (5 to 10 micrograms/kg body weight per min) were measured echocardiographically. For comparison, responses to milrinone were determined under control conditions and after accelerated application of 150 mg of metoprolol to inactivate beta-adrenoceptors in subjects with normal left ventricular function.", 
    "94": "In subjects with normal left ventricular function, treatment with metoprolol did not alter the increase in fractional shortening or pressure/dimension ratio of circumferential fiber shortening after application of milrinone. In patients with heart failure, treatment with metoprolol significantly increased left ventricular ejection fraction, fractional shortening and submaximal exercise tolerance and reduced heart rate, plasma norepinephrine concentrations and functional class. After metoprolol treatment, milrinone increased fractional shortening but had no effect before beta-blocker treatment.", 
    "95": "Milrinone increases inotropic performance independently of beta-adrenoceptors in vivo. Metoprolol treatment restores the blunted inotropic response to milrinone in patients with heart failure, indicating that postreceptor events (e.g., increase in inhibitory G-protein) are favorably influenced.

During patch-off hours, angina frequency increased with TD-NTG (1.1 +/- 2.1) compared with placebo (0.7 +/- 1.6) (p = 0.03). Similar trends for an increase in ischemia after TD-NTG were also observed from AECG analyses. Specifically, ischemia frequency tended to be lower during patch-off hours for placebo than with TD-NTG (0.05 +/- 0.09 vs. 0.08 +/- 0.20 episodes/h, respectively, p = 0.08), even though frequency of ischemia tended to be higher during patch-on hours for placebo than with TD-NTG (0.12 +/- 0.19 vs. 0.07 +/- 0.15 episodes/h, respectively, p = 0.11).

Accordingly, it might be useful to study the effects of behavioral interventions, such as mental relaxation, that might be capable of blunting excitatory autonomic responses. It would also be preferable to study healthy subjects in whom autonomic control is not modified by the presence of disease, and to use noninvasive approaches to minimize the possible emotional impact produced by invasive recordings.",

After a washout period of 10 days, 27 inpatients with major depression were treated with trazodone 100 mg/day (orally). One week later (T0), fluoxetine 20 mg/day, placebo, or pindolol 7.5 mg/day was added. Plasma concentrations of mCPP and trazodone were determined at T0 and 2 and 4 weeks later. Although placebo pindolol had no significant effect on the plasma concentrations of mCPP and trazodone, there was a significant increase of the concentrations of these compounds associated with the combination of trazodone + fluoxetine. The results suggest that fluoxetine-induced increases in plasma mCPP and trazodone concentrations contribute to the clinical efficacy of the combination of fluoxetine + trazodone. It is suggested that desensitization of 5-HT2C receptor function by mCPP as well as fluoxetine may contribute to the antidepressant effects of this combination.",

In this study, we investigated the effect of bFGF on interleukin-6 (IL-6) synthesis in these cells. bFGF stimulated the IL-6 synthesis dose-dependently in the range between 1 and 30 ng/ml. The depletion of extracellular Ca2+ by EGTA suppressed the bFGF-induced IL-6 synthesis. TMB-8, an inhibitor of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, also inhibited the IL-6 synthesis by bFGF. bFGF stimulated the Ca2+ influx from extracellular space. Genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, suppressed the bFGF-induced Ca2+ influx. Staurosporine, an inhibitor for protein kinases, enhanced the bFGF-induced IL-6 synthesis. Calphostin C, a highly potent and specific inhibitor for protein kinase C (PKC), also enhanced the IL-6 synthesis by bFGF. The bFGF-induced IL-6 synthesis was amplified in PKC down-regulated cells. U-73122, a phospholipase C inhibitor, enhanced the bFGF-induced IL-6 synthesis. Propranolol, a phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase inhibitor, also enhanced the IL-6 synthesis by bFGF. These results strongly suggest that bFGF stimulates IL-6 synthesis, which depends on intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in osteoblastlike cells, and that the IL-6 synthesis by bFGF is autoregulated due to PKC activation.",

Thirty-eight (2 x 19) patients scheduled for endoscopic cholangiopancreatography received either metoprolol 100 mg or placebo two hours before endoscopy. During endoscopy, arterial oxygen saturation was measured by continuous pulse oximetry, and the electrocardiogram was monitored continuously with a Holter tape recorder. Myocardial ischaemia was defined as an ST segment deviation > 1 mV from baseline. Heart rate during endoscopy was significantly lower in the metoprolol group compared with the placebo group (p = 0.0002). Twenty-one patients (16 placebo versus five metoprolol, p = 0.0008) developed tachycardia (heart rate > 100/min) during the procedure. A total of eleven patients (ten placebo versus one metoprolol, p = 0.003) developed myocardial ischaemia during the procedure, and myocardial ischaemia was always related to increases in heart rate. In conclusion, metoprolol prevented myocardial ischaemia during endoscopic cholangiopancreatography, probably through a heart rate lowering effect. Thus, tachycardia seems to be a key pathogenic factor in the development of myocardial ischaemia during endoscopy.",

However it has also become apparent that less dramatic falls in blood pressure, while not sufficient to cause full syncope, may produce symptoms such as near syncope, vertigo, dizziness, and TIA-like episodes. We have identified a subgroup of individuals with a mild form of autonomic dysfunction with symptoms of postural tachycardia and lightheadedness, disabling fatigue, exercise intolerance, dizziness, and near syncope. During baseline tilt table testing these patients demonstrated a heart rate increase of > or = 30 beats/min (or a maximum heart rate of 120 beats/min) within the first 10 minutes upright (unassociated with profound hypotension), which reproduced their symptom complex. In addition these patients exhibit an exaggerated response to isoproterenol infusions. Similar observations have been made by others who have dubbed this entity the Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS). We conclude that POTS represents a mild (and potentially treatable) from of autonomic dysfunction that can be readily diagnosed during head upright tilt table testing.",

The purpose of our study was to examine whether the nonselective beta-blocker propranolol causes hypertriglyceridemia in the rat and whether its action is mediated by the modulation of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) messenger RNA (mRNA) accumulation or activity. LPL activity was assayed in fresh tissue by incubation with tritiated triglycerides. LPL mRNA was quantified in total RNA by slot-blot analysis using a mouse LPL complementary DNA probe. We have conducted three series of experiments in unanaesthetized rats in order to study the effects of different single doses of propranolol (1.5 to 6 mg i.p.) and different durations of treatment (15 min to 4 wk). We measured triglyceride and cholesterol levels in plasma as well as the LPL activity and mRNA levels in the heart and adipose tissue before and after propranolol administration. In these experiments we did not find any significant decrease in either the activity or the amount of mRNA of lipoprotein lipase nor was there any change in plasma lipids following treatment. Our results lead us to the conclusion that the nonselective beta-blocker propranolol affects neither the activity nor the mRNA level of LPL in the rat.",

We sought to assess, in a nonacademic primary care environment, pharmacotherapeutic treatment patterns for CHF with respect to consistency with clinical trial evidence and published treatment guideline recommendations. Over an 18-month period, we examined CHF pharmacotherapy using a computerized, integrated clinical diagnoses and prescription database from an outpatient community healthcare center without academic affiliations. We identified adult patients meeting contact criteria and with diagnosis of CHF by International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9-CM) coding and assessed prescribed therapy as well as select comorbid conditions. Drugs of interest included those with known or suspected benefit or detriment and those with unproven benefit. An eligible group of 14,983 patients was identified, from which a cohort of 148 patients with CHF was selected. Forty-one percent of these 148 patients were prescribed an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, 34% digoxin, 12% diuretic, 12% hydralazine + nitrate, 20% inhaled beta-agonists, and 66% warfarin. Only 5% of patients were prescribed the combination of an ACE inhibitor, digoxin, and diuretic. Thirty-one percent had a comorbid diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, of whom 44% were prescribed digoxin, 22% diltiazem, 15% beta-blockers, 15% digoxin and diltiazem, 7% digoxin and a beta-blocker, and 33% warfarin. In general, recommended therapies for CHF appeared underutilized in this cohort, whereas those of unclear benefit and potential detriment appeared overutilized. Although these results may not be readily generalized to the entire healthcare system, they do suggest a need for additional analysis and potential intervention.",

The average annual amount spent on these patients was calculated for eight cardiovascular drug groups defined in the British National Formulary (BNF), hospitalizations for ischaemic heart disease, and revascularization and angiography procedures. The proportion of the study population with the potential to benefit from treatment with statins was then determined by identifying individuals with the characteristics of participants who benefited in any one of three published clinical trials. Identification of these individuals was assisted by the use of population-specific morbidity data and serum cholesterol levels reported in published surveys.", 
    "140": "The actual average annual expenditure on statins (pound 774 per 1000 patients registered) was lower than that on ACE inhibitors, beta-adrenoceptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics and nitrates and was less than one-tenth of the combined annual cost of all coronary hospitalizations examined. In the patient population studied it was estimated that 7547 (1.7%) individuals would be eligible for secondary prevention with statins whilst 20406 (4.5%) would be eligible for primary prevention. After adjusting for possible non-adherence, the estimated annual cost of statin treatment for all such individuals was calculated to be between pound 22 599 and pound 28 413 per 1000 of the study population. Application of these figures to the registered population of the health authority would add approximately pound 11.8 million to a pound 60 million primary and secondary care drugs budget. It is proposed that statin treatment will have to be prioritized for those at highest risk, whilst maintaining a population-based strategy of promoting lifestyle advice to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.",

Metoprolol and amlodipine reduced the total duration of ischaemic episodes from 86.0 min to 15-1 and 48.3 min with a mean episode duration of 1.1 and 2.6 min, respectively. Twenty patients on metoprolol (42.6%) and four on amlodipine (8.4%) showed no ST-segment depression at the end of treatment. Baseline heart rate of 80 b.p.m. decreased by 11.1 b.p.m. after metoprolol and increased by 4b.p.m. after amlodipine. Anginal attacks were reduced from 14.8 attacks per week at baseline to 2.4 attacks on metoprolol and 4.4 attacks on amlodipine treatment. For all variables the observed changes from baseline were significant after either treatment (P<0.005) with a significantly more pronounced effect in favour of metoprolol (P<0.0001).

    "145": "The role of 5-hydroxytryptamine and its receptor subtypes in the development of acute inflammation was investigated using the rat paw formalin test as a model for pain (measured by flinching behavior) and edema formation (measured by plethysmometry). The role of endogenously released 5-hydroxytryptamine was assessed using 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor subtype-selective antagonists co-injected with 2.5% formalin, while the receptor subtypes involved in the inflammatory process were further defined by co-injection of 5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor subtype-selective agonists with 0.5% formalin in anticipation of an augmented response. When co-administered with 2.5% formalin, propranolol, tropisetron or GR113808A, but not ketanserin, effectively blocked nociceptive behavior. In the presence of 0.5% formalin, 5-carboxamidotryptamine, 1-(m-chlorophenyl) biguanide or 5-methoxytryptamine, but not (+/-)-1-4-(4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-aminopropane, augmented the flinching response. These data suggest involvement of 5-hydroxytryptamine1, 5-hydroxytryptamine3 and 5-hydroxytryptamine4 receptors in peripheral nociception. There may be some dissociation of nociception and edema formation, since no single 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor antagonist inhibited edema formation with 2.5% formalin; however, with 0.5% formalin, edema formation was enhanced by co-administration of 5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-carboxamidotryptamine, (+/-)-1-4-(4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-aminopropane or 5-methoxytryptamine, but not 1-(m-chlorophenyl) biguanide. These data suggest involvement of 5-hydroxytryptamine1, 5-hydroxytryptamine2 and possibly 5-hydroxytryptamine4 receptors in edema formation. These results confirm the involvement of 5-hydroxytryptamine1 and 5-hydroxytryptamine3 receptor subtypes in peripheral nociception associated with acute inflammation and further suggest an involvement of the more recently characterized 5-hydroxytryptamine4 receptor in this process. There appears to be a dissociation in 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors involved in peripheral nociception and edema formation.",

We report a case of autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura associated with hyperthyroidism in which the patient's thrombocytopenia and thyrotoxicosis resolved concomitantly. We recommend testing for hyperthyroidism in all patients with unexplained thrombocytopenia and that family members of patients be evaluated, screened, and observed for thrombocytopenia and hyperthyroidism.",

In the first of a series of experiments designed to address this issue, the effects of mixed 5-HT1A and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists pindolol enantiomers and pindobind 5-HT1A and of metoprolol and ICI 118,551 (selective beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptor antagonists, respectively) were assessed in the mouse elevated plus-maze using ethological techniques. Results showed that, at lower doses, (-)pindolol (0.1-1.6 mg/kg) and pindobind 5-HT1A (0.1-0.5 mg/kg) produced changes in both conventional and ethological measures (increased percentage of open arm time and reduced risk assessment) indicative of anxiety reduction. However, these anxiolyticlike actions were less evident at higher doses. In contrast, (+)pindolol (0.1-6.4 mg/kg), metoprolol (2.0-18.0 mg/kg) and ICI 118,551 (1.0-9.0 mg/kg) were behaviourally inert under present test conditions. These data suggest that antagonist actions at 5-HT1A receptors (but not beta-adrenoceptors) are involved in the anxiolyticlike effects of (-)pindolol and pindobind 5-HT1A in the murine elevated plus-maze test.", 
    "148": "In this study we examined the effects of long-term treatment of 19 patients with primary hypertension with the beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol on norepinephrine and epinephrine kinetics, at rest and during sympathoadrenal stimulation by lower body negative pressure. Norepinephrine and epinephrine kinetics were measured by using the radioisotope-dilution technique by steady-state infusion of tritiated norepinephrine and epinephrine. The patients were studied before and at the end of 3 months of treatment with atenolol (50 or 100 mg daily). A control group of four normotensive subjects was studied before and after 3 months without any drug treatment. In this group, only arterial blood samples were collected without infusion of the tritiated catecholamines. Atenolol decreased blood pressure and heart rate, but forearm vascular resistance was not affected by atenolol. During atenolol, baseline arterial plasma epinephrine decreased from 0.23 +/- 0.02 to 0.17 +/- 0.01 nM (p < 0.05), and this was accompanied by a decrease in total body epinephrine spillover from 0.50 +/- 0.05 to 0.35 +/- 0.04 nmol/min (p < 0.05). In the control group, arterial plasma epinephrine had not decreased after 3 months. In addition, the increment of arterial plasma epinephrine during lower body negative pressure at -40 mm Hg was attenuated during atenolol. Atenolol had no effect on total body and forearm norepinephrine spillover rates, either at rest or during lower body negative pressure. Clearance rates of epinephrine and norepinephrine were not significantly affected by atenolol. These results suggest that treatment of patients with primary hypertension with the beta 1-adrenoceptor blocker atenolol inhibits the adrenomedullary secretion of epinephrine, but it does not affect the biochemical indices of sympathoneural activity. It remains speculative whether this selective effect of atenolol on epinephrine secretion contributes to its hypotensive action and to its cardioprotective effects in the long term.",

    "151": "Four tachykinin-related peptides, locustatachykinin 1-4 (LomTK 1-4) are distributed in interneurons throughout the central nervous system of the locust Locusta migratoria and may have important roles as neurotransmitters or neuromodulators. In search of the central actions of LomTKs, we analyzed the response of the efferent dorsal unpaired median (DUM) neurons in the locust metathoracic ganglion. Immunocytochemistry, using an antiserum against LomTK 1, combined with intracellular filling of efferent DUM neurons with Lucifer yellow, revealed that LomTK-immunoreactive fibers are in close proximity to dendritic arborizations of the DUM neurons. Hence, LomTKs may act on DUM neurons by releasing locally in the metathoracic ganglion. Intracellular recordings were made from somata of DUM neurons, and LomTKs were either bath-applied to an isolated metathoracic ganglion or pressure-ejected onto the DUM neuron soma. LomTK 1 at concentrations of 0.1 mM-0.1 microM caused a relatively slow, reversible depolarization with a subsequent increase in the frequency of action potential firing. Amino-terminally truncated forms of LomTK 1 were applied to DUM neurons. The heptapeptide [3-9]-LomTK 1 had a substantially reduced activity, and bioactivity was lost after further truncation. Spantide 1, an antagonist of mammalian tachykinin receptors, reversibly blocked the effect of LomTK 1. The effect of LomTK 1 was clearly reduced in the presence of GDP-beta-S, a stable analog of GDP that inactivates G-proteins. The action of LomTK 1 was potentiated by both IBMX and theophylline, two cyclic AMP (cAMP) phosphodiesterase inhibitors. The action of LomTK 1 was mimicked by pressure-ejecting 8-bromo-cAMP, a membrane permeable analog of cAMP, and by forskolin, an adenylate cyclase activator. Furthermore, cAMPS, a blocker of protein kinase A activity, reduced the effect of LomTK 1. These findings indicate that cAMP is involved in mediating DUM neuron depolarization.", 
    "152": "This study assesses differences in blood pressure (BP) levels prospectively between office (manual) measurement and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in 70 treated, essential, hypertensive patients. The objective was to determine whether ABPM is superior to office measurement for assessing adequacy of therapy. Twenty-four patients received monotherapy and 46 received multiple therapy. Thirty-five patients were administered medication in the morning only, whereas 33 were administered medication in the morning and evening both. Mean systolic BP by manual method was identical to that obtained by ABPM (141.98 +/- 14.98 mm Hg versus 141.46 +/- 16.33 mm Hg, respectively). However, mean diastolic BP by manual method was significantly higher than that obtained by ABPM. (90.38 +/- 9.01 mm Hg versus 86.69 +/- 10.65 mm Hg, respectively; P < 0.001). Significant correlations (P < 0.01) were found between the BP levels measured by these two methods, although individual readings differed by 10 mm Hg or more systolic and by 5 mm or more diastolic in many subjects. No significant differences were noted in BP levels measured by either method for patients treated by monotherapy or multiple therapy, and none were noted whether they were taking medication in the morning or in both the morning and evening. In addition, no differences were noted in BP levels using either method for race. Thus, this study shows that the office measurement is grossly similar to ABPM for assessment of adequacy of therapy in treated hypertensive patients whose blood pressure is controlled adequately. However, ABPM is found to be superior to office measurement in identifying hypertensive patients whose blood pressure is not controlled adequately or is uncontrolled.",

    "154": "Interleukin 12 (IL-12) plays a central role in the immune system by skewing the immune response towards T helper 1 (Th1) type responses which are characterized by high interferon-gamma and low IL-4 production. In this report we present evidence that beta2-agonists inhibit IL-12 production by both human monocytes in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and dendritic cells stimulated via CD40. Inhibition of IL-12 production is selective, as other cytokines produced by monocytes are unaffected. IL-12 inhibition is dependent on beta2-adrenoceptor stimulation and correlates with increased levels of intracellular cAMP. In conjunction with their ability to suppress IL-12 production, when beta2-agonists are added at priming of neonatal T lymphocytes, they inhibit the development of Th1-type cells, while promoting T helper 2 (Th2) cell differentiation. Further, the in vivo administration of a therapeutic dose of salbutamol results in the selective inhibition of IL-12 production by whole blood lymphocytes stimulated in vitro with LPS. These findings provide new insight into the immunological consequences of the clinical use of beta2-agonists and may suggest new approaches for the treatment of Th1-mediated diseases.", 
    "155": "Proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) is a G protein-coupled receptor that is cleaved and activated by trypsin-like enzymes. PAR-2 is highly expressed by small intestinal enterocytes where it is activated by luminal trypsin. The location, mechanism of activation, and biological functions of PAR-2 in the colon, however, are unknown. We localized PAR-2 to the muscularis externa of the rat colon by immunofluorescence. Myocytes in primary culture also expressed PAR-2, assessed by immunofluorescence and RT-PCR. Trypsin, SLIGRL-NH2 (corresponding to the PAR-2 tethered ligand), mast cell tryptase, and a filtrate of degranulated mast cells stimulated a prompt increase in [Ca2+]i in myocytes. The response to tryptase and the mast cell filtrate was inhibited by the tryptase inhibitor BABIM, and abolished by desensitization of PAR-2 with trypsin. PAR-2 activation inhibited the amplitude of rhythmic contractions of strips of rat colon. This response was unaffected by indomethacin, l-NG-nitroarginine methyl ester, a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist and tetrodotoxin. Thus, PAR-2 is highly expressed by colonic myocytes where it may be cleaved and activated by mast cell tryptase. This may contribute to motility disturbances of the colon during conditions associated with mast cell degranulation.", 
    "156": "Survival of patients with heart failure has improved over the past decade due to advances in medical therapy. Sudden death continues to cause 20 to 50% of deaths. Ventricular arrhythmias are common in patients with heart failure. Ventricular hypertrophy, scars from prior myocardial infarction, sympathetic activation, and electrolyte abnormalities contribute. Some sudden deaths are due to bradyarrhythmias and electromechanical dissociation rather than ventricular arrhythmias. The risks and benefits of antiarrhythmic therapies continue to be defined. Class I antiarrhythmic drugs should be avoided due to proarrhythmic and negative inotropic effects that may increase mortality. For patients resuscitated from sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) amiodarone or an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) should be considered. ICDs markedly reduce sudden death in VT/VF survivors, but in advanced heart failure, this may not markedly extend survival. Catheter or surgical ablation can be considered for selected patients with bundle branch reentry VT or difficult to control monomorphic VT. For patients who have not had sustained VT/VF antiarrhythmic therapy should generally be avoided, but may benefit some high risk patients. Amiodarone may be beneficial in patients with advanced heart failure and rapid resting heart rates. ICDs may improve survival in selected survivors of myocardial infarction who have inducible VT.",

We performed risk stratification at electrophysiologic (EP) study in 111 consecutive unselected patients with nonsustained VT and coronary artery disease and randomized them to drug or device therapy. Follow-up on selected therapy was 1-71 (mean 27 +/- 20) months. Of 111 patients, 39 patients (35%) had inducible sustained VT at baseline EP study and were stratified to a \"higher\" risk group (group 1) for sudden death. In 9 of these patients (group 1A), sustained VT was suppressed with class IA antiarrhythmic drugs; in the remaining 30 patients (group 1B) sustained VT was not suppressed with class IA antiarrhythmic drugs. The other 72 of 111 patients (65%) had no inducible sustained VT at EP study and were stratified to a \"lower\"-risk group (group 2) for sudden death. Mean LVEF in group 1 was 30 +/- 10% versus 37 +/- 9% in group 2 (p = 0.001). Selected therapy in group 1 was an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (16 patients) or guided drug therapy (electrophysiologically guided class I antiarrhythmic drugs = 7 patients; Holter-guided class III antiarrhythmic drugs = 16 patients). In group 2, empiric drug therapy included beta blockers in 29 patients or Holter-guided class III antiarrhythmic drugs in 17 patients, with no antiarrhythmic drug therapy being administered in 26 patients. Mean LVEF tended to be lower in patients receiving class III antiarrhythmic drug therapy (34 +/- 12%) than in patients receiving beta blockers (40 +/- 10%, p = 0.06). Three-year total survival was comparable in group 1 (70%) and in group 2 (81%), but sudden cardiac death mortality tended to be lower in group 1 versus group 2 (0 vs 9%, p = 0.09). Patients receiving class III antiarrhythmic therapy had significantly higher 3-year all cause (40%, p = 0.04) and sudden death (25%, p = 0.06) mortality than patients receiving beta blockers (17% and 8% respectively) or no antiarrhythmic drug therapy (4% and 0%, respectively). The following conclusions can be drawn from this analysis: (1) Electrophysiologically guided drug therapy and implantable defibrillators can minimize the risk of sudden cardiac death in patients with coronary artery disease and inducible sustained VT stratified to higher risk of sudden death. A comparable outcome with respect to sudden death prevention in drug-suppressed or drug-refractory patients suggests limited prognostic benefit of class IA drug testing. (2) Lower-risk patients with severely depressed LVEF and minimal or no symptoms do not have a favorable outcome with respect to sudden and all-cause mortality on Holter-guided class III drug therapy. However, asymptomatic patients with mildly depressed left ventricular function have low sudden death event rates on beta blocker or no antiarrhythmic drug therapy.", 
    "158": "We present a case of combined verapamil and propranolol ingestion in a young woman with a DDD pacer from whom hemodynamic, echocardiographic, and toxicologic data were obtained simultaneously. Analysis of the data from these combined sources suggests a progression of (1) recovery of myocardial contractility, (2) return of systemic vascular resistance, and (3) return of intrinsic electrical activity of the heart. That contractility returns before intrinsic electrical activity strongly for the early use of transvenous temporary pacing wires. Furthermore, our patient's complete recovery after a prolonged electromechanical dissociation arrest would again argue for very aggressive resuscitation efforts in this setting.", 
    "159": "This study investigated the effects of chronic beta-blockade on the pathophysiology of heart failure following induction of aortic regurgitation (AR). Nine rabbits with AR were administered propranolol continuously for 7 days (AR+P), 8 rabbits with AR received vehicle for the same period (AR+C), and 7 rabbits underwent sham operation. Cardiac output was lower and the left-ventricular end-diastolic pressure was higher in AR+C than in sham-operated rabbits, but there was no difference in the right-ventricular end-diastolic pressure between the two groups. Down-regulation of beta-adrenoceptors was observed in the left ventricle, but not in the right ventricle. All of these variables were reversed in AR+P. In left-ventricular failure produced by AR, (1) the augmentation of adrenergic drive occurred selectively in the left ventricle, and (2) propranolol blunted adrenergic drive and played a protective role against myocardial damage.", 
    "160": "A cyclic AMP-responsive reporter cell line has been established through the stable expression of a luciferase reporter plasmid in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Reporter cells showed a dose-dependent expression of luciferase in response to incubation with forskolin. These CHO cells were screened for endogenous G protein-coupled receptors capable of stimulating or inhibiting adenylyl cyclase, by monitoring changes in luciferase expression. Serotonin (5-HT) receptor agonist ligands caused an inhibition of forskolin-stimulated luciferase expression in the rank order 5-carboxamidotryptamine > 5-HT > sumatriptan > 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin. The response to 5-HT was reversed by the 5-HT1 receptor antagonists cyanopindolol and pindolol, but not the 5-HT2 receptor antagonist ketanserin. Calcitonin was more potent than calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) at stimulating luciferase expression in this cell line, and these responses were insensitive to the CGRP receptor antagonist, CGRP (8-37). These results were consistent with the presence of 5-HT(1B-like) and calcitonin (C1a-like) receptors in CHO cells, with the responses to 5-HT and CGRP being pertussis and cholera toxin-sensitive, respectively. This reporter gene assay gave the expected pharmacological profile for these receptors when compared with cyclic AMP accumulation assays, confirming its value as a functional assay for G protein-coupled receptors linked to adenylyl cyclase."
